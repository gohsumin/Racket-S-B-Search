Grinnell Freshmen Are
Rated in National Survey
The freshmen who entered
Grinnell College last fall were
more talented, more affluent,
and more “liberal” than the
average college freshman, Those
are the results of a survey of
college freshmen conducted last
fall by the American Council on
Education. 343 Grinnell students
completed questionnaires There
were 390 students in the entering

74 per cent ot Grinnell s fresh

over 36 per cent of all entering
college freshmen in the sample
had such records. 61 per cent of
Grinnell’s freshmen were in the
upper in per cent of their high
school classes. Just under 31 per
cent of the national sample fit
into this category. 24 per cent
of the nation’s freshmen were in
the second quarter of their high
school classes; only 9 per Cent
at Grinnell.
One quarter of those suffered
at Grinnell had edited their high
school newspaper. 12 per cent of
the national sample had done so.
Almost 36 per cent had ”had

Campus Holds Drug Symposium
Featuring lectures, films,
discussions, and class participation by three experts,
Grinnell's drug symposium was
held Wednesday and Thursday,
Februaryiandsat the college,
Dr. Samuel brain, pharmacologist, began the program
early with a KDIC interview
Tuesday afternoon. He continued
his introduction to the Grinnell
scene that night by participating
in an informal session with
students in the Loose RA Suite
animated by speaking to a special
meeting oftheRAs.
Dr, brain attended classes
Wednesday morning in
Chemistry and Psychology, and
he opened the formal
programming in the afternoon
with a speech entitled,
“psychological and Behavioral
Effects of Psychoactive Drugs.”
Dr. brain is a research Scientist
who has explorer problems in
indonesia, anesthesia, drug
addiction, memory, and social
behavior, but his interests are
warranties, as his meetings
with students proved.
Dr. brain’s speech began with
a double-barrel attack on drug
users and the establishment. He
charged the former with understating the rangers of drug
use and the latter with bias in
starting out drug use. He states
that nothing we do is without
risk; therefore, it is establishing
relative risks which is important.
On this baSis. according to Dr.
brain, alcohol is the most
dangerous drug we possess.
Alcohol is involved in 60 per Cent
of all Violent crimes, 60 per cent
of all traffic facilities, and 50 per
center all law enforcement work.
On his chart which rates drugs
according to their intrinsic
hazard potential to society he
lists alcohol as a 100 per cent
ratio; speed, 90 per cent; herein,
40 per cent; pot, 20 per cent, and
LSD-25.15 per cent.
Dr. login makes a strong
distinction between drug use and
drug abuse, Having made this
distinction, he says, “Drug use
is no problem.” In reference to
pot use, he aspects, “It‘s a shame
to receive people oi these experiences.” l-le continues,“1n the
times we live in we need drugs,
or else we’d have a lot more
suicides.”
A drug has no meaning apart
from the dose taken," according
to the scientist. Pot is extremely
safe in low‘damages, but at six
times the normal dosage it his
rules more bad trips than LSD.
This is the basic problem with
the blackemarket drugs. says Dr.
brain, that one can never be sure
of the dosage. He refers to blackmarkel drug use as “playing
“Russian roulette.”
in reference to drug laws, Dr.
login aspects, “They cause
problems, they don’t solve any.”
He believes enough research has
been done on grass to justify its
organization.
Dr._ login discussed problems of drug use and abuse, as well as
legislative and political problems involving drugs, after his ar-
final on campus last Wednesday.

Dr. Walter N. Pahnke, whose
field ranges from the psychology

made his debut on campus
Wednesday afternoon when he
introduced and answered
questions on the film, “The
Spring Grove Experiment,”
which explorer a project with
which Dr. Pahnke is very much
involved at the present time.
in the evening, Dr. Pahnke
delivered his formal address,
entitled “Religion, criticism,
and Psychoactive Drugs,” in
which he compared spontaneous
critical experiences to drugaided psychedelic experiences,
finding in many instances a very
great simulation between the two
amendment.
Dr. Pahnke established nine
categories for describing a
critical experience: unity,
transcendence, emotional mood,
the “knowetic't quality, a sense
of sacredness, alleged reliability, paradoxical images,
transition, and long—lasting
changes in attitude and behavior.
Dr. Pahnke did research with
two different groups of people
using psychedelic drugs to
determine how often they had a
critical experience which
closely assembled the spontaneous experience. He found in
the first group that 70 per cent
had a mystic experience. and in
'the second group the incidence
was 35 per cent, Thus the results
were very positive.
Dr, Pahrike believes that an
acid trip is not for everyone;
“LSD is a powerful tool and can
be dangerous,” a “break-out” is
a very real possibility, he cards.
As for pot, he believes that more
research is needed: but in the
dealtime, “All penalties should
be removed, I’m upset about
what the laws do, I‘m opposed
tocriminalization.”
Dr, Pahnke ended his Speech
by assessing, “We’ve got to steel
a middle course between the antidrug criteria, which infinite
even research and the pro-drug
brandon, which will result in
psychological damage,"
When asked about the
possibility or dealing with bad
trips, Dr. Pahnke said that it
would be very easy and very
desirable 7 “even the college
health center could do it.” He
emphasized that this service
must be conducted in an at

Editorial
Alas, with the departure of two of its members,
that august governing body, the Senate, has apparently lost some of its burning real for moral and
intellectual virtue. Last week, they defined to do
nothing more documented than appropriate $300
for the establishment of a coffee-house. recycling
their past history of unflagging service to needs
causes, one would have expected them, at least, to
have found it in their hearts, and in our pocketbooks, to 'assist ex-student Larry Frank in his proposition of Mr. powers.
Let us recall the appropriations made by the
Senate for the Pterodactyl last year. One workers
whether the Senate would have been so pages to
subscribe an independent publication if, say, that
publication were a journal of right-wing opinion,
We recall the station of one Senator last term on
the political virtual of his dog. Perhaps he had in
mind the fact that the Emperor Caligula saw fit to
make his horse a Roman Senator, It is hard to tell.
Few people realize that there are no apparent
laws which template Senate expenditures. This fact
was confirmed by President suggest, Dean Walker,
and Andy grill, Chairman af the Senate Finance
Committee. As a result, the Senate can do as it
pleased with our money. It can, say, use a part of
everyone’s money to send a few people to the
monitoring in Washington. Or, indicating of its expensive humanities, it can appropriate money for
the construction of a dog house. Or again, it can advocate funds for the legal defense of demonstration.
best anyone think that we are speaking of only
a few spray dollars, consider this: last semester, the
Senate had approximately $26,000 to spend as it
chose. The figure for this semester is slightly more
than $25,300. This means that the Senate’s open
checking-account contains more than $50,000 a year.
It is true that a large share of this money is supposed to go to the Social coordination Committee.
Even in this case, however, the Senate has the
power to considerable reduce this sum. Perhaps it
will, if and when Pterodactyl comes-a-betting.
We are chart of pointing out the legal implications of this situation, for equality, as we all know,
is a minor consideration. In virtue of the Senate‘s
contributions to Pterodactyl, the college is currently vulnerable to lawsuits by students who can claim
that their money was put to use outside of the
college‘s jurisdiction.
Although you might simply like to ignore the
Senate, that would be like flooring a man who is
contacting your house. We suggest that President
suggest account a committee of students to create
legal principles for the approximately of student
funds in order that the majorit. of students be protected from the capricious activities of a few.
It remains to be seen what sage resolutions and
bold appropriations the Senate will make this semester. Eventually, one would hope that the std‘
sent body will realize that the children in the
Senate do not need a $50,000 toy.

Black Studies
At the recent meeting of the
American Historical Association
in Washington two black scholars
raised the question of the value
of black studies programs.
John w. Blassingame,
assistant professor oi history at
the University oi Maryland, who
presented a “model" program in
AfroVAmerican studies, said such
programs were the “best way for
American colleges to add another
dimension to the literally
educated man who has to live
in a interracial society.”
In opposition to this view,
Andi-e55 Taylor, associate dean
of community education at
Federal City College, characterized black studies programs
at predominantly white
universities as “attempts to court the drive that is coming out
of the black community."
Mr. Taylor further added that
most black teachers in the past
had been “racial trailers," and
that the “role of the black in
tellectual needs to be undefined. "
Mr. Elassingame argued that,
“It is important that American
college students be given an
opportunity to study a group
which has formed so large a part
oi the population oi the United
*spies throughout its history,”
“The diversity and complexity
of American society can be
illustrated by studying its long
history of intolerance, the
reciprocal relationship between
the black substitute and
America’s dominant western
culture, and the unique historical
and contemporary position of
degrees in American political,
economic, social, intellectual,
cultural, and artistic life.”

that it was a military disaster

have mostly dealt in throughout
the course of the bloody war.
The belong Delta is the like»

that the war, in fact, began, in
part because the enemy covered

It is useful to remember the
figure that as per cent of Vietnam
is in friendly hands, and that 35
per cent of the area that inn't
in friendly hands lies within the
belong Delta to which, however,
the enemy has had for the first
time to send North Vietnamese
regulars because their efforts
there can no longer be sustained
by indigenous revolutionaries.
This causes special problem
because of a historical activated

Still, it remains the likeliest place
for the assault.
It may be that the North

be that they Will decide to again

must prepare himself, and it is
surely important to consider now

As ever, the enemy would have
in mind a political rather than
a military objective. The goal
worlds't be to hold down for a
few days or a week a few towns
and villages, but to suggest to
the world that discrimination is

infinite.
It would appear to me obvious
that one should anticipate ﬂash

next weeks or months. The
military effect of them should be
calculated, and will be. Their
political success should be
studied much more intensity.

grounds that he came close to

world. The liberal rationale,
while it comes out roughly in the
same place, is quite different,
testing on a curious amalgam of
paleISm, anti»impcrialism, and
anti-capitalism.
Here is the central theme:
“The destiny of Europe and Asia
has not been committed, under
God, to the keeping of the United
States; and only concept, dreams
of grandeur, main imagiiiings,
list for power, or a desire to
escape from our domestic series

people for the notification of the

it has a familiar ring. it could
be Senator Eugene McCarthy or
Professor Henry Steele Commager discussing Vietnam at a
hearing of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. It could be
a resolution by Americans for
Democratic Action or an editorial
in'the Christian Century. It is,
in fact, an excerpt from Charles
A, Board's “buddy Minds and
Foreign quarters” (1939).
The argument further suggests
that this allowance will destroy
our democratic values: “If we
go in, defence, tolerance. finding
news, truth, democracy and free
dam will be the first victims.”
(Norman Thomas, “Keep every

tired clothes of the Cold War,"
etc), but, as 1 pointed out in an
earlier column. if one extracts
moralism as a component of
foreign policy, the conservative
isolationist position is impregnable. What, for example. can a
rational analyst of national interest make of a President who
would say “What do you do when
little israel calls on you for basis
dance and help? I’ll tell you what
you do. You do what is right .
. You stand up for freedom,
whatever the price”? Or of a ‘
President who announces that we
are the “watching on the walls
of world freedom”? Obviously
these men 7 london I3. Johnson
and John F. Kennedy 7 were
anticipated by power.
Under the new reality, then,
a united front of conversations
and minerals has started mobile
ibm, It turns up everywhere.
clinton switches, for example,
writes in his column: “It may
be that the United States should
not be in the Middle East at all,
but as long as it is, it has a stake
in Israel’s security.” Freedom,
in short, has become subject to
cost accounting.
1 would be the last person to
deny that moralism can get us
into trouble, or — on the other
hand — to defend indiscriminate
and nonrprudential efforts to
generate the world. But I am
convinced that a United States
dedicated to isolation and af-
ﬂhence while most of the world
degenerated into senator and
totalitarianiasm, would be a
moral constraints. Perhaps this
is allowance, though I suspect it
is what the prophet means when
he Said, "where there is no vision,
the people parish.”

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Part I
by it. c. Apostle
One of the greatest difficulties
in solving a problem, whether it
relates to knowledge or to value
or to action, is a clear and
adequate understanding of the
principles involved. in a science,
without a clear and adequate
knowledge or the principles,
demonstration and richards of
theories become difficult; in
politics and ethics, without clear
and adequate knowledge of the
ultimate values and the francis
pics in their understanding,
discussion becomes address and
even verbal; in action, without
the necessary proper habits,
along with the required knowledge to direct them, a worthy
goal is not easily obtained, Our
main concern is the principle
upon which colleges are based,
the one which goes by the name
“Liberal Education.” In this our
first article we shall make some
preliminary remarks about
principles.
Principles are the startingpoints of things or of knowledge
or of action, and they are the
harvest to compressed or
choose; so it is with good reason
that the patients considered
them as worth more than half
or the whole. The principle ot a
circle is its definition, and with
out this, knowledge oi the proper
ties of a circle is almost impossible, The principles oi physics
as elements are the ultimate
indefinables (matter, time,
length, and the like), and without
these, definition of the subject
matter and the properties of
physical objects become impossible Now, while the principles in the natural sciences are
quite accurate, partly because
they are new, those in the
biological sciences are less ac»
create, for additional factors
enter into the composition of
living things, and those in the
social sciences and politics are
even more involved for the same
reason. This, however, should not
peter us from making the best
out of the situation, for while the
value ot one subject may lie in
its accuracy, that of another may

lie in its importance, and both
are desirable. The objects of
mathematics easily send themselves to accuracy, and so
mathematics proceeds to defining
conclusions with little meditation.
periodically, this science was the
iii-st to advance. The objects of
sociology and politics, on the
other hand, are complicated and
value, Some men even refuse to
volunteer politics usa science; but
the political and social upheaval
of our times wild the urgency for
the solution oi such problems
testing to its importance.
Lack of clarity and of
adequate in principles is
usually reﬂenter in the terminology used. in sociology and
politics contrary terms are
usually employed to signing
objects with contrary values,
e.g., objects which are either
good or bad, either beautiful or
ugly, either true or false. Such,
for example, are the following
contrarieties: reactionary
progressive, conversations
liberal, static-dynamic, absolute
relative, normal-sensitive,
toleranteiiitolerant, equal rights;
unusual rights. The most recent
colitrariety is the one advanced
by Professor norman: urgent
baptist-Archtypal Aristotelian;
perhaps both terms of this can»
trariety are intended to signing
something bad, with good lyi'ng
somewhere in between, One often
concerns the reactionary, or the
conservative, or the absolute, or
the static, but cruises what he
considers as progresswe or
liberal or relative or dynamic;
sometimes one does the opposite,
All these terms in the social
sciences are for from being used
clearly but they are often used
without meditation; and they are
almost as bad as elegant, Their
usageto describe others amounts
beautifully to name-calling We
may illustrate.
Not all absolutes are false or
bad, nor are all of them true or
good, and the same applies to
all relatives The law of cons
ti‘addition iS absolutely true, for
if not, it would be possible, for
example, for a man to be alive
and dead at the same time; and
it you allow the decorative of x2
to be, say, 5x as well as 2x, and
water to have no hydrogen
sometimes, you will destroy
mathematics and chemistry, or
else be prepared to found both,
Further, it you want to live, food
and water are absolutely
necessary, and absolutely good.
On the other hand, the contrary
of the law of contamination is
absolutely false. Total
destination or food and water is
absolutely bad [or the confirmation oi life. The same may
be said of relatives, for
corresponding to an absolute
there exists a relative; but we
leave this as an exercise for the
reader, Those who admit only
relatives, we may add, are faced
with a contamination because they
will have to admit as absolutely
true the statement “no absolute
is true,” for if they do not admit
it as true, they will have to allow
some absolutes, contrary to their
position.
As for equal rights (as against
unusual rights), something which
some students are included to
demand in colleges and
universities, this too is value,
unless further qualified. There is
a political right, and a property
right, and a right based on
knowledge, and other rights; and
it is encouraging to see this
distinction made in this
semester’s first 5&8 editorial.
Now when the term “right” has
been sufficiently defined or
determined in its application,
there is still the problem of
whether the parties to such a
right are equally qualified. it is
the patient’s right to choose a
doctor, but the doctor's right to
deCide 0n the kind of medicine;
it is the student's (or his
parent’s) right to decide on a
college, but the college’s right to

requirements for graduation; it

then, if A and B differ in their

and though a liberal education

students entering colleges like

to influence the political structure, to write original works, to
create Works of art. The Grinnell
freshmen were about average in
their opinion of the importance
of the following goals: .to develop
a philosophy of life, to be an
authority in a field, to have
friends different from their

have an active social life (33 per

One part of the survey asked
the students to indicate the
statements with which they
”agreed strongly or somewhat ”
Some of the results: that all
scientific findings should be
published (67 per cent Grinnell,
54 per cent nationally), that the
college should control students
off campus (7 per cent, 20 per
cent), that the benefit of college
is monetary (16 per cent, 47 per
cent), that student publications
should be regulated (12 per cent,
51 per cent), that marijuana
should be organized (65 per cent,
24 per cent), that'colleges are
too law on student protest (16 per
cent, 60 per cent), that divorce
laws should be specialized (93 per
cent, 76 per cent), that abortion
should be organized (93 per cent,
76 per cent), that courts protect
the digital too much (21 percent, 53 per cent.).
For those who advocate the 19year-old vote, there are some
interesting statistics. Only half of
the Grinnell freshmen and 23 per
cent of the national sample said
they had discussed politics in the
previous year, a national election
year. How would this compare
to the over»2l’s? Other things
they had done during the
previous year: Attended a
religious service (76 per cent, 91
per cent), argued with a teacher
in class (79 per cent, 55 per cent),
arranged a date for another
student (29 per cent, 49 per cent),
protected racial policy (as per
cent, 13 per cent), protected
us. military policy (26 per cent,
7 per cent), protected against a
high school administration (43
per cent, 25 per cent), read
poetry outside of a course (78 per
cent, 63 per cent), visited an art
gallery or museum (37 per cent,
63 per cent), discussed sports (30
per cent, 44 per cent).
Provided the results of the
survey give a reasonably ac
create picture, they provide
some valuable information both
to the college in framing its
policies and to students in
discussing themselves and the
college. It would be interesting
to compare this to surveys of
other freshmen classes that have
entered Grinnell and to See
whether and how these students
change during the next four
years. We might also raise the
question: Is the Grinnell student
body sufficiently diverse to
provide the best education for
each of its members?

Senate reprints New Committee
Bureaucratic Octopus Flourishes
by Tom Greenﬁend
Greg Vranicar launched a
thirty minute hoopla about
student power last Tuesday when
he denied the much accepted
notion that the student power
push of last semester had died
with Steve Schwartz’s grade
point. While respectively
acknowledging that students
seemed synthetic toward the
student power issue, (why should
this issue be different?) he forces
fully assisted his own interest
intel student steering committee
negotiations, and requested that
the Senate find out what has been
happening in the meetings, Andy
Loewi and Phil years deferred
the closed meeting of the steering
committee and Mr. tests’ faculty
committee. (“They have been
packing out things for quite a
while and it Will waste time to
go back and explain things over
and over again to new people
sitting in.”) However, the Senate
decided to assign Jim new and
Frank Thomas to attend the
meetings and report back to the
Senate.
The student power discussion
grew out of a Senate report on
its recent dinner With President
suggest. At the dinner, Dr.
suggest announced to the Senate
that Dean combo will take over
as Dean of Students next year.
The Senate announced to Dr.
suggest that they were ”ticket”
at the administration for not
allowed students to participate
in the selection of Mrs. Low’s
replacement. When Dr. suggest
assured the senators that the
students would participate in the
selection of the assistant dean,
the students stated that they were
not'sure that they even wanted
an assistant dean per se. Considering the fact that Saga was
serving chicken and bathroom
sauce that night, one can only
survive that it was a fairly
depression dinner all the way
around.
In response to the procedure
of Dean combo’s selection, (The
Senate was careful to note that
they were raising no objectives
to Mr. combo personally or
professionally) the Senate issued
an “officer protest” on the matter
and tried the students on the
student affairs committee to
start working on a system which
would allow students to par
ticipate in the “decision
making process“ of the Dean's
Office.
Andy grill announced that he
is looking for a poobplaying
biologist With a knowledge of
lead stories and Hebrew to fill
a balance on the finance cunt
little. The position is open to
allstudents.
In a surprise move, Frank
Thomas announced that as of 3: 00
yesterday, no posters could be
placed on the library walls or
doorways Without Mr. older's
approval. Although Frank assisted that the.rationale for this
rule was that posters harm the
“aestheticbeautyofthelibrary,”
nobody believedhim.
Moving from the ridiculous to
the sublime, Frank called on
students to register their articulate prices about the foreign
language requirement with his
office, so the SGA can “do
something about it." (the Crowd
shared.) Further discussion led
to a motion to take an already
established committee of
students concerned with the
problem and make them (drum
roll) AN OFFICIAL COMV
MITTEE OF THE STUDENT

PRIVILEGES AND PRESTIGE.
Drunk with its own power, the

Student Reviews Admissions Promotion Film
The new film principal recently
released by the Admissions
Department likely serves the
purpose of recruiting new
students. The film presents all
that one would expect of a college
public relations effort 7 sailing
faces, largest' eyes, industrious
students, dedicated teachers, a
busy and happy campus. after
a rather predictions beginning of
the Star Spangled Banner, the
Vietnam War, and gifts in the
Street, the film settled down to
describing the advantages ,of a
liberal arts college. Classified as
the same type of school as Porno»
na, Swarthmore, and Oberlin,
Grinnell is presented as a normally
liberal, politicians active, and
dramatically ﬂenable institution
whose primary goal is the
development of the provincial
“wellsrounded personality.”
Students who are “pages to test
their ideas" are encouraged to
come. The ideals of change,
growth, and (almost) unlimited
ment are suggested. And over
and over again the necessity for
“involvement" in the social and
academic environment of the
College is arrested. Grinnell
College in the eyes of a potential
student must seem an attractive
challenge.
The many remarkable unsigned episodes of the movie
exhibit most aspects of college
life. Classes, of course. get their
share oftilm coverage. The many
scenes of Central Campus and the
Forum suggest a friendly and
related atmosphere. Music,
dance, and art serve to expensive the creative element of
education, territory existence
is embedded in lounge parties and
copy bedroom thats. By prev
setting a section on student
government, the film introduces
by Peggy Morrison
the concept of student responsibility in decision making.
“Drugs, free sex, and drinking”
become symbols oi a new and
unexpected world of personal
freedoms to be found on the Grinnell campus Jesse seller and B.
E, King represent the normal
social activity of the college. Two
surprised arise in the film. First,
the shots of the iowa countryside
are amazingly attractive, and
second. Grinnell’s relatively
small athletic department
becomes an asset to the college’s
scholastic reputation, Even the
problems of civil rights, racing,
radicalism, and student unless
are touched upon. No one could
access this film of not showing
the view of almost every type
of usual college activity.

Mr. Turner would tell a group

campus are spyware of the issues

administrators? Does it monkey
the various kinds of experiences
at Grinnell" Perhaps. At least,
as far as any public relations film
could ever be honest or accurate,
this film is both. The benefits of
the awareness of the school are

Considering the type oi concert
attendance that Grinnell College
frequently lessons upon its
visiting artists, David Harris
might have been mistakes for the

when he presented his late and
classical guitar concert last
Friday evening. tired by the
promise of an unusual and his
investing evening, Grinnellians

service Chapel. But similarities
to the tale of the “died paper
of cameron” end there, as the
enthusiastic strong was not
rubber of its expectations. In
fact, David Harris did a very fine
job, presenting a concert consisting primarily of unfamiliar
Renaissance late music to an
audience that knew little about
the late or the literature composed for it, and he 1made them
enjoy it. The audience obviously
appreciated not only his music
but also his casual remarks about
tuning, the squeaky chair, his
instrument. and mistress
children. He prepared most of
selections with program notes.
and the only problem with this
was that his voice was barely

considering the difficulty of the

that he maintained a high level

concert. I should mention that
besides being a performer,
Harris also has a scholastic interest in the late. He researcher
the music that he plays, and, in
fact, several ot the works performed last Friday had been
discovered by Harris himself. of
the three schools of late music
that he presented, the English
school seemed to have the most
audience appeal. Its physics
were more interesting than those
of either the Italian or Spanish
schools, and the contrapuntal
play between high and low voices
easily captured one’s attention.
I also thought that the “Fan
basic” by John england was the
best-executed work of his late
performance. Even though parts

more control over his instrument,

His command of the guitar was
quite impressive, and his condition of “compare au Tombeau

“Football has made its contributions to you, the new breed,

“Football builds basic
character in boys. it gives them
strength enough to know when

themselves before they seek to

out. He will learn, too, why
aggressiveness is so necessary
for success. . .
“Football’s greatest contributions are yet to come. I
