interpreted after the election,
Bill Thomas listed some of the
projects he has been working on
and which he will continue to
work on as C. of HP. president.
They include: (1) establishment
of a student»run Crisis clinic for
both drug and emotional proc.
less; (2) change in the counseling service; (3) forms that are
fully cold; (4) better organization for payment at hall deals;
and (5) better managementof the
TV fund.
In addition, Thomas said, “I’d
like to see hall treatments take
a more creative role in the
changes on social affairs. C. of
l-I.P. is the one group with code
facts all over campus. it is in
touch with people of all lifestyles;
therefore, it can come up with
programs which have the most
widespread support. It hash’t
taken advantage of this at all this
year."
As for counseling, Thomas had
the following to say: “I link the
student advisor system should be
retained, although the training
program for S.A.’S could be
improved. I think much more
consideration should be given to
student opinion in the hiring of
R.A.’s and their suppliers. An
academic advisor should be
assigned to the same group of
students as a student advisor
because some academic corn:
selling must be done by students
A good thing might be to have
a professor affiliated with each
form
0n form life; “I’m going to
work for home rule for the former
movies. Each hall should consist
of a group of students who rent
that hall from the college.” 0n
Grinnell in general: “In 1964,
Grinnell was a leader not only
in the Midwest but across the
country in social policy. Today.
supposedly more conservative
colleges are moving ahead or us.
The students here are generally
complement about their living
situation.” _
Mary Brooncr was more
reserved in her interview, but she
allocated that the A.W.S. and
'c of HP. be given more power
in the area oi social regulations.
“The Senate has too many come
matters, and many of the mem-
’iers of this year’s A,W,S. Board
well frustrated because they
have no power."
In her campaign statement,
she said: “Resources for both
professional and personal advisor arc. at most, minimal and
do not meet the needs of Women
students. The A.W.S. Board
should make it its business to
investigate this area of advisory
and to ‘make strong recommendations to the College where
necessary. Further demands also
need to be made concerning the
health needs of Grinnell women.”

Student Power Pro post]
In this issue appears the proposal of the student
power committee for the establishment of a committee
on curriculum and academic affairs. This proposal,
we are told, is the result of many long and difficult
hours of labor by both students and faculty. The pro—
local is totally for its relative federation as compared
to the freenswinging, profile student manifesto of last
semester. The reason for this may be that the com—
little was, in part, composed of‘ faculty members.
Or it may be the case that time sends to make conversations of us all. Unfortunately, regardless of how moderators we apply a bad principle, we get bad results.
And the principle of student power in academic and
curriculum affairs is very had, indeed.
The committee has carefully made its proposal according to a democratic principle. They apparently
believe that because a representative democracy is
» desirable in national government, it is equally desirable
in education. It is not effectively obvious to us, at least,
that the two situations are identical. The reasoning
behind the committee’s noble infections leaves a great
deal to be desired. .
The proposal, if accepted, would give students an
equal voice in determining, for example, graduation
and departmental requirements. We would have then
the elderly assure situation of students who have not
completed their education voting on what would be
needed to complete that education. Let us note that
the proposal does not even exclude freshmen from
voting on the committees.
The faculty will debate and vote on the proposal
lifetime after spring vacation. If they vote to accept
it, we believe that they will have taken just one more
step toward the device of excellent education at Grin»
well College.

Letters . . .
To Tlle Editors:
In the interest of somewhat
greater accuracy, 1 would like
to make the following two course
tions of statements which appeared in the article concerning
huntington College two issues
ago.
(1) The organization Societies
did purchase land from tribal
peoples early in the nineteenth
century, but it was for the purpose of establishing their settle»
meets. huntington College is 120
miles in the interior, and its land
was purchased drum tribal
peoples in the midrlsso's, as part
at the extensive allocation of land
from tribal peoples which began
at that time with the extension
of roadsinto the interior.
(2) The students of tribal background at huntington College
were often educated at missions,
but that does not mean that they
were educated by dictionaries,-
Peace Corps Volunteers, Liberian citizens, materials from other
African nations, EX-PCV'S, and
sometimes ACM graduates, My
point was to indicate that college
students are not requested from
the government schools for the

most part.
Sincerely yours,
Ronald J. Kurtz
Associated Professor of
Anthropology
To The Editors:
Since l take paint to express
myself clearly, l seldom reply to
criticisms of my arguments
unless new evidence appears or
new countenarguments are
brought forward. But my century
of Mr. master’s review has
houses considerable are, some of
it from men whom I know and
respect and whose good opinion
I would not willingly iorego.
Hence this review,
'I observe first that not one of
those persons who has called me
such appropriate names undertaken to say one good word
in behalf of Mr. master's review.
Apparently all believe that it is
enough merely to discredit me.
Such a view contractors their own
principle 7 that a man‘s views
are irrelevant to his conference.
Second, their method for
discrediling me is exactly that
of which they access me:
“personal attack” and
“character investigation." If I
were guilty ct what they assets,
it would be timer in intent or
in fact or both. Well, since only
i can know my infections, let me

say, automatically and unequivocally, that my century or
Mr. master’s review was in no
way whatsoever intended to be
a reﬂaction on his person or his
character. My argument, in fact,
is this: those who submit to a
body of drama are to that degree
concluded from having
character, for character is formed by the sustained and
renewal cabin of decision; and
he who sublime to drama abanr
does his powers at decision.
It would seem that there
are three reasons for the are
accused: (l) I used the word
“communist” as being,
possibly a more accurate
description of Mr. master’dt
position than “societies”; (2) my
statement that Mr. master’s
peculiar mixture of “-isms”
disabilities him for teaching at
a liberal arts college seemed to
be attending civic or legal action
to just him; (a) the general tone
at my letter was offensive.
To the first charge 1 reply that
the Plot of either term 7
“communist" or “societies" 7
was of minor insurance to my
argument, which tested on the
meaning of the surfaces “risks”
and “list,” If I have caused Mr.
master or other faculty members
under pain by making a distinction between “communist”and
“societies,” I degree it, although
I would argue that the distinction
is a legitimate one. Still, if it will
please Mr. Klein and others for
whom he speaks, I will withdraw
the word ”communist" provided
that Mr. master’s own term
“societies" be understood to
include advocacy of violence and
revolution, in the manner of the
present governments of Russia
and China: such is what his
review indicates. Until he denied
this interpretation, it seems
legitimate tu make it.

Theater Dance Group Presents
substantially Unified Performance
By RONNIE FULTON
Last Friday and Saturday night
iii Roberts Theater, the' Grinnell
community was treated to an
evening ot excellent dance and
some very good bibliography by
the Theater Dance Group, for
energy known as Orchesis. The
varied program provided an excitingshow for theaudience,
The Theater Dance Group. as
compared with last year‘s group,
has learned to work and dance
as a group. A college dance group
with only a few good banners
could not have proceed such a
diversified program, The prev
once of so many new males in
-the performance, noted with
great pleasure, is one factor responsible for a more cohesive
group,
The first half of the program
was choreographed primarily by
students, “Organic,“ choreographed by Giti Zarnegar, was
one of the best attempts. The out
standing piece of student
bibliography was ”Street people,” cancer to music by holland. and choreographed by Dick
party, early obviously has potter
dial as a choreographer, In this
number he managed to create
numerous character switches of
street vendors and young you-
plus. He knows how to shift the
audience‘s attention from you-
pda, to individuals, to the group.
The simplified of the dramatic
elements in this piece made the
story easily understood. Another
student piece, “Character Studies From Theater,“ would have
provided from a less complicated
plot.
l-large’ other example of
bibliography was his solo,
“David at Gilboa.” This short,
simple number suspended in
creating a mood of mobility. party
began the piece with very simple
movements which he later developed The shadow of his figure
playing on the back wall added
an excellent touch.
small the pieces choreographed
by Mrs. Voertman, “Gnossiena
new," “Full Circle,” and “The
Last Flower” were most successful “The Last Flower” contained
more acting than dance; how
ever, the audience seemed to
enjoy the humor of the group's
portraits of such things as hobbies and surveys. In “Full Circle,” the story of the jealousies
of two women and a man, Mrs.
Voertman displayed her ability
to combine the serious and the
comic. Nina Seidenman was an
<t‘ser's political
excellent choice for the female
role opposite Mrs. Voertman. The
contrast in the shapes of their
bodies and their facial features
supplemental the theme of the
struggle between the two women.
“Gnussiennes,” cancer by Jenny
further, Elly Dayton, and Sue
needed, was one of the most
beautiful numbers in the
program, In this piece Mrs.
Voertmari created a simplified of
movement, tastefully begun and
resolved. The gracefulness of the
dance was recruitment of the
style of Martha Graham.
The audience thoroughly enjoyed the performance. This reviewer hopes to See the Theater
Dance Group retain its cohesive
character, and to see Dick party
continue with his additions
bibliography. Mrs Voertman is
to be commented for her bibliographic ability and her ability to
teach banners to change thought
into the movement of one body.

Mr. master directed his own
headline: The Battle of players:

Klein, fighting on my side for the
moment, effectively showed that
Mr. master was guilty of
fallacious historical parallels —
a charge admitted by Mr. master
in his subsequent letter, where
he connected that his language
had been ”religious.” We know
what“religious” means in such

Such was the only “substantial
