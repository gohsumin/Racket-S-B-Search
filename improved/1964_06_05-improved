Miscellany and regression
President Howard R. women
in an address in the fall of 1962
Much has received much attention in the field of education
attacked the reliance of the
American educational system
on grades and test scores as the
standard for the lodging of a
student’s ability or progress.
in a more recent talk this
spring women expanded on this
thesis suggesting some innovations which might be introduced
BI. Grlnuell to raise the level of
Grinnell education.
These suggestions included
such innovations as the revision of the course trading system, replacing letter grades
with a three-level high pass,
pass, and failure trading system. The letters grades would
be used in the evaluation of independent projects and comprehensives which would probably
include the junior liberal arts
examination. Independent work
and comprehensives would be
considered as one quarter of
the student's total work at
Gl'illness.
l have neither the intelligence nor the educational experience to match Dr. women.
However, I have for the last
four years been a full price
ticilig college student. While
this in no way established the
presence of a high level of intelligence in the author, it does
indicate a basic running that is
required to percentage such a
longstanding fraud, More im»
contact, perhaps, this recent
experience as a student gives
me a perspective which an intelligent college administrator
cannon possibly hope to obtain.
From this perspective I must
take exception to several of Dr.
women’s suggestions. While I
would agree that often too
much attention is given to
scores of nationwide, standardized, objective examinations
such as the if), College Board,
and Graduate Record examinations, the answer does not lie
in the total selection of these
tests in favor of all-operating
subjective essay examinations.
Tile standardized objective test
have many businesses. They
Often test the students’ knowledge of isolated facts. Little if
anything can be determined
about how well the student can
evaluate and interview facts or
evidence and place them with
in a meaningful context.
The Junior Liberal Arts test
and senior comprehensive usually utilize both objective and
subjective tests to determine
both the student's knowledge of
facts and his analytical and in:
respective ability. In theory,
such a combination should be
ideal.
 
However, the subjective portions of the test usually can be
customized for the failures that
are apparent in the objective
tests. There is no correlation
between the two sections of the
test. It is as if one were attempting to deny the constant
interaction between objective
and subjective thought.
The most common reason for
this failure to allow the interaction of objective and subjective thought is that the essays
are too broad to permit
reporting of the comprehensives and trading them by
strict letter grades would tend
to expensive the results of
these unreliable and often uninformative tests. The validity of
the results of these tests is
questionable, and their value as
a step in the learning process
of a studio‘t has yet to be
proved.
I would suggest that the Junior Liberal Arts test be shared
more to an understanding of
the contemporary and how the
work of the various disciplines
interact and‘influence each other in the search for knowledge
to help light our progress to
the future. The interim session
would be devoted to a program
of independent study selected
by the student in a field outside
of his major study.
To further expensive independent study and at the same
time eliminate the businesses
interest in attempting to determine the conference of a
Student in a field of study
through several hours of testing
which seldom require or permit a student to utilize the
tools of his discipline in the organization and presentation of
facts, concepts. and hypothesis,
I would replace senior Comprehensives with a required senior project to be done by each
student.
In his senior year the student
would select a topic for a pa
per. This paper Would be more
than a research paper. It
would also require by the std»
sent an understanding of the
procedures basic to his discipline. To facilitate work on this
project the student would take
a reduced course load, perhaps
two courses in the semester or
computers in which the projects
are being done.
This, rather than a reliance
on several hours of testing with
curious validity would prove
more valuable to the student
in terms of co-indicating the
knowledge he has gathered in
his major field. It would also
provide a more accurate and
reasonable standard by which
the student’s progress in his
major could be charged.

Ghana is making a phenomenon progress in the field of
education which is considered
the major tool for elimination
tyranny, players, and inequality. Last year the U. N, station
tips showed that Ghana speeds
a greater fraction of her revenue on education than any
other country in the world.
This means a lot since Ghana
his perhaps the wealthiest state
in Africa (excluding apartment
South Africa). By 1970 Ghana
will be the first country in Africa and one of the few in the
world to have entirely free education at all levels. It is only
for technical and secondary
school sectors of education in
Ghana that fees are charged.
Before 1951 opportunities for
basic education were restricted
to the urban minority but are
now rapidly expanding to all
parts of the country. In Ghana
the coastal South was far more
advanced than the island
North. Virtually all the schools
were located in the South. By
1952, primary, secondary, and
university education was made
free for the poor northern
children while the southern
children still had to pay for
their education. This themes-
.does educational opportunity
makes it possible for all areas
now to participate freely in all
aspects of Ghanaian life. After
a few years of self government, Ghana was rich enough
to institute universal compulsory free primary education.
In 1954 mass adult education
was started, timing to teach
basic literacy and skills to they
rural population and above all
to mobility their energy for
rural self-help projects. This
program contributed greatly towards the transformation of the
italian countryside,
In secondary education, the
emphasis is placed on scientific and mathematical subjects
in substance of the Government’s policy of producing as
fast as possible enough qualified men for the scientific and
technological revolution. The
secondary school population
grew in ten years from 3500 to
19,000, and the rate of secondary school graduation ins
created seven-fold since independence in 1957. However, the
government is not satisfied with
this charitable accomplishment.
A few months ago an eighteenmember commission was appointed to study pre-university
educationiit included one expert from the United States and
one from the Soviet Union—to
find means of improvement.
it is perhaps in the field of
university e d u c a t i o n that
Ghana's achievement is most
significant. After about a century of colonial nomination,
Ghana had only one university
in 1951 with 200 students. There
are at present about 13.000 students in the three universities
of Ghana and about twenty junior colleges. In addition Ghana
has Over 3.000 students in the
Western countries. The Eastern atmosphere has generously offered 3,000 scholarships to
italian students to study
mainly medicine, agriculture,
and engineering.
Ghana's educational progress
 
has always greatly impressed

On July 6th, 1964, the British
government will issue an official
declaration of independence for swaziland. With effect from that
date, the map name, swaziland.
will be framed, and the original
name, Malawi, will be printed in
its place.
On that day Malawi will occurs
her rightful place in the world community of nations. It will be a
day of reporting and prayer not
only among Africans but among
all freedom loving people who
‘value the density of man and the
right of a people to shape their
own destiny,
The war for political independence has come to a close, but
the relations are not so drive
as to think all is over; they know
that there remains greater and
more formidable enemies; and
those enemies are illiteracy, poverty, disease, and hunger. The
relations are. resolved to syndicate all these terminals enemiesr
They know they will never fail;
 
African Country Gains
Freedom; Malawi Now
 
they are used to rating Wars
against enemies and they have always won their wars. So there is
no doubt they will win the
struggle against the terminals en»
emily. Unfortunately, they can’t do
all this alone, but with the help
of those nations which have more
or less conducted sellers of banking, the relations are very hope»
fun.
And so on that independence day,
wherever you may be, echo back
to the heating drums of Africa
celebration the generation of Mala—
wi from the chains of colonial rule.
To some people it will be a day
accompanied with brief when they
remember their brothers W110 shed
their blood in the struggle for
human freedom. We as relations
won't ask other nations to share
our inner brief; all we ask from
them on that day is to share with
us our joy, and further more we
will ask them to pray that those
people who have been chosen by
the people to lead Malawi will act
 
with wisdom and justice.
Anku Discusses Education
in last Article On Ghana
visitors to the country. A few
months ago. Dr. calcium Adis‘
eshiah, Deputy Director-geneva] of UNESCO, spoke highly
of Ghana‘s educational program. He remained that “universal primary education, the
high level of secondary education, and the rapid growth of
universities in Ghana are signs
of Ghana’s determination to become one of the least advanced
countries in education in the
world.
“On the countryside, Ghana
is doing one of the most important works on African jul<
sure, history, drama, music,
and dancing." he added.
The showed enemies of
Ghana brush aside all these
praiseworthy accomplishments
of Nkrumah and his people and
constantly, th hugh gallery,
charge Nkrumah with absolute
dictatorship. Experience has
shown quite well that players
and absolute directors cannon

I believe that champions‘ have

extremely dedicated leader.
who is previously direction the
course of their history. This is
the leader some “estate" western disorders call ”the black<
man's burden.” Yes, indeed,
but the lighting and most com«
portable burden the black men
have ever force.
in my concerning remarks, I
quote an excerpt from a Niger.
ian radio commentary on January 4, 1964. “The most important point, however, is that,
whatever one thinks of President Nkrumah’s policy, few
will dispute the fact that it will
take Ghana a long time to get:
another Nkrumah. Both the
people of Ghana and Africa in
general will certainly need
Nkrumah for many rnorl

Retrospective/y Speaking"
'those, Were The Days]!
By Susan Taylor
When we returned to the campus
in the fall there was a great hole
in the ground where the new union
was supposed to be under construction.
But small worried had to be expressed in order to take care of
the needs of the ever»present freshmen, and after they got through
with registration, we began to settle down to a fairly normal academic year.
Dr. women introduced us to the
place of women in the world in
his corporation address; we were
made well aware of the new liquorby-the-room ordinance; and the
first weekend concert was a performance by members, Hendricks,
and japan. Well received.
The new thing for the year
seemed to be the Seminar on Order. It went on in a somewhat
ordered manner throughout the
year. See your own notes for its
content.
The first big social event was
Homecoming. We lost the football
game by one point, All of the
traditional destination went on, i
guess. I don’t remember — i
went home for the four day weekend.
An ex-President placed the
campus and put us in the national
magazines when he fell down the
steps at Grinnell House and was
initiated to West morris I-call. Ken
Richards never knew he would become world famous when he won
that election last spring.
Truman made a little speech and
gave a big press conference. He
made an unmistakable but undo<
finance impression on the campus. And soon the always - non harrison PPPE was accounting
that lee and jamie would besour
guests in the Spring of ’65.
The new college chaplain, brought
a fresh personality to the campus
religious life and also brought well:
remembered persons: “J a s u s
roses,” "The update of the People,” “Will Success april Joe college?" /
The C of HP and the Dean of
Men had their traditional run—ins
and agreed to limit the number
of ice boxes in the balls.
The fall semester was placed by
the WUS Carnival, Dance 1M5<
which were totally for their birth
day reservations, the election of
senior class officers, the symposium.
On the daily Friday afternoon
of November 22, we stood by television and radio in fisheries of the
news from Dallas. No matter what
our political bent, we printed for
the assassinated President and We
lived with history. The flag at half
last until Christmas vacation reminder us of our feeling of happiness and our bewilderment at who
we should do. ' \
But as the Government went on
-—if changed—so did the educationlil process at Grinnell. We went
about the tests and papers and
daily classroom assignments different, seller people.
Before Christmas Vacation, we
turned the midnight oil, lined at
‘thermal” winners and cancer and
listings to watches and his trusted.
cohen we got back from vacation the new Union was more like
 
a giant concrete cave than the
hole in the ground which had
created us in September.
0n into finals and then the Interim. JLA —- a movie a day —
Stanley coleman, womenﬁend lectures — sleeping — forward bus—
sell canyon, Kenneth Burke —
comes — beer —- etc. -« etc. —
etc.
And with registration and the
campus motor cycle club we shared
into the second semester. '
Women's Week, grades, concerts,
civil rights, performances, papers,
letters to the editor tests, coffee
hours, speeches, etc., this was the
second semester. This is any semester.
What stands out? homes?
They’re over. Politics? The worst
is yet to come. The class of ’64?
They are so much a part of the
campus that we must see it as a
whole. »
Seniors and other interested students began early to frequent the
placement office. Just how many
have jobs for next year is anyone’s guess, but we will all remember the conferences with
Zeke.
The Beatles had no less effect
on this campus than they did
across the nation, but there were
still some of us who could proudly
say that we did not watch them
on TV.
There was the interdisciplinary
Seminar on Mr. yahoo, the visit
of the investors, better Sing—
but I guess We already had my
say on that.
“ratings Brought to Mary,"
“Major Barbara," “The World of
Shalom Aleichem." And to end it
all the music department finally
did something light and removable
—“Anything Goes." Will we ever
forget Reno Sweeny?
There was the Orchesis Show.
But the tradition was not followed
— Langan, for the most part.
showed up power.
The Basketball team came
through with a 1240 record, even
if the last home games were discouraging. Mifflin and S un d all
were voted to the all conference
team.
The SGA Convention was dom—
united by 1”: and J’s. Elected
were Johnson, request, Read,
party—apps? Johnson, Read, request and party. The new regime
took over from the old, and with
the change of personality went a
change in style.
The rock Political Conventions
were PPPE’s biggest show in four
years. Characterized by all the january and some of the worst copy
the S d: B has ever printed—Abe
campaigns were carried on for
months. Hatfield and McGee keyboard. The GOP nominated Lodge-
 
Hatfield and the Demo ballot was
formed by JohnsonrHumphrey. The
Republicans triumphed in the all
campus vote.
President women announced his
designation -— or rather the news
leader out—and we learned that he
will be in Iowa City next year.
There were a few camp eyes at
the convention the next morning.
We will miss the powers; the college is lucky to have had them
for 3 years. -
'Spring Riot and Spring Day
managed to occur in different
weeks. The weather for the root
was wonderful—as were the legal
2:00 hours; but we can’t say so
much for Spring Day —with all
due abilities to the Social Coordinator.
Then there were finals and
comes . . . and now its mostly
over. But the memories and the
friendships will last.
I guess it’s best to close a story
that really has no end with a
salute to the Class of ’64. You will
be remembered.
And the concrete and steel
framework which may holiday be
