The interim session looks good on paper. The
Junior Liberal Arts Exam impressed the prospective
student, and adds depth and polish to the college cataloguei But the fact remains — students consider both
the JLA and the interim “comic relief.”
A time designed for independent study finds the
students migration to the train and bus_depot, rather
than to the library. shelter in the bookstore remain
stopped with relevant material long after the syllabus
has been distributed. centuries, experts in their fields,
are brought to the campus — morning lectures attract
a great number of curious students, while later dishes—
sign sessions interface a harmful of sleeps listening.
The members of the junior class compare notes on how
little they have read about printable, Darwin, or Newton, and proceed to deal out the next bridge hand,
What does it mean, this interim period? A twoweek paid vacation for a group of stainless liberal arts
students who choose to party rather than prepare for
independent progress? It can hardly be a question of
Whether Grinnell students can study independently.
Regular course work, and advanced projects show that
they do a great deal on their own—both by choice and
by necessity.
But where, in the study plans for the interim see—
the seniors, in preparing for comes, have the opportunity to do extensive work in a chosen field, and the
chance to graduate necessitates the completion of that
_work successfully.
' Although the JLA is not supposed to shadow the
interim period, the seniors have been restricted count
clearly during the last two weeks by its existence.
Their study is independent only in respect to whether
they do it or not For those students who decide to go
along with the experiment, at least two full weeks of
reading are happen out by the syllabus. There inn’t
much room for-exploration in areas of personal interest,
and there inn’t enough interest in those areas supposed
to be explorer The knowledge that no one has to pass
(unless he anticipated feeding those four credits to
graduate) might believe pressure, but it also eliminates
motivation. _
Sophomores and freshmen are guided by value
plans for learning, and faithfully read books from the
proposed lists and attend their lectures for a while. But
when the interim is over, they have little more to show
for it than memories of sleeping late in the morning,
attending movies every night in ARH. and the appreciation that they are one year closer to the JLA syllabus.
If the interim session is going to benefit just the
harmful of underclassmen that take the maximum
amount of energy in an attempt to fulfill a rather
value degree of responsibility, then it should be
published. Right now it exists as a lot of free time to
use up before classes start again,
If the seniors are going to have a JLA, then the
topics should be more relevant and more individually»
oriented. Some discrimination should be drawn between those who do the work and those who “bull"
their'way through; and with the topics as value and
general as they are now, this is often not possible.
If the college wants to provide the student with
two weeks free from classes to pursue independent in
threats, the interests must be particularized for each
“body-student" rather than bin-aggregate “student
body." Let’s focus the interim session or strap it.
The announcement by Mar-
‘gay'et Chase Smith that she
livnuld enter the New jump
lshirc primary in an attempt to
secure the Republican presidential nomination came as no
surprise to those of us who are
worried about sleeping begin»
ibm in American society. Her
announcement should be a
clarity call of warning ibithose American men who have
not yet fallen under the religious control of the opposite sex.
Whether there are any such
people left in our society has
been open to doubt. Former
President Harry Truman,
when asked about the possibility of a woman president,
answered: “I don’t see why
not. They I u n everything
else, and if you don’t know
that now, you soon will."
improve pierce confused the
same impression when be defined a Queen as “A woman
by whom the realm is ruled
when there is a king, and
through whom it is ruled when
there is not.”
Despite these statements, it
is clear to me that, fortunately,
men make most of the import
want decisions in this world. I
say fortunately, for if these de-
 
Tom silver—“h?
l
l
lessons were made by women,
I doubt whether our civilization
could ensure.
1 am a firm believed in the
doctrine of male secretary.
This belief is firmly provided in empirical preceding.
However, it would be english
for me to argue for a program to deal with women’s
rights which was based on
the separate but equal concept. That type of program
is no longer accepted by the
intelligent individual in today’s society
What i do argue for is a
more realistic policy, a policy
which recognized the necessity
for Women in society and the
associations Which must take
place in such a society if it is
to continue to function. That
policy is based on the more
realistic and practical concept
of together but unusual.
The American woman simply
has not shown herself capable
of doing anything which requires the southwest amount of
intensity and original thought.
She has shown herself invisible of performing such minor
tasks as driving a car. A womr
an never parks a car; she
abandons it.
Women, of course, do have
 
their place in this world. if
trained properly, they make
excellent occasional compiled
sons and have shown some
ability in doing mental work.
The marriage rows recognized
that woman is suited to be a
serving to man. Each woman
at the alter promises to “love,
honor, and obey," her' husband. That is as it should be.
Even Grinnell is not safe
from the religious quest for
equality for women, For those
who are complement, I need
only point but that two of the
last ioui- S&B,editors have been
women.
One week from today will
begin a test for Grinnell Col»
legs. Next weekend is women‘s
weekend. Each man must decide for himself what his own
Conduct will be during this Critical period.
I would only suggest that
Grinnell men act from a position of strength. Reasoning
is topless with women, but,
like the lower form of intelligence which they are, women
respect ﬁrmness and name.
Before reporting to violence,
however, one is mentioned to
check with the humans society.

This year the cycling and
the 5&3 have taken their
business out of Grinnell, with
the cycling photography being done at Cedar Rapids and
the printing of the 5&3 being
done in Newton. The respective decisions to leave Grinnell were made after careful
consideration of the offers
made and the services to be
rendered.

could be understandable to the
publications' states, but there
are two obicciidns to the WithdraWEIls,
rim, both publications are
on budgets, and they have to
get what they consider to be
the most for what money they
have 1 think that Grinnell
businesses should realize that
it takes more than location in
Grinnell to win the college
contracts and should offer
more than that in getting the
college business.
The second objective to the
withdrawal of the advertising
was the way in which it was

idea that. they do no! need student business and support for

Adult: Mature?
To the Editor:
Perhaps the cruz of our proc
let within the Grinnell tommy‘
city is the assumption we tend
to make that the terms “adult"
and “mature” are necessarily
synonymous. They may be, but
need not be. We may have forgotten the la ct that most
“Adults" are not “mature."
When the Community approaches the s f u d e n t individually or internationally as an
“adult,” it made the assumption — “mature."
The Community seems to for—
get that the larger society has
many mechanisms which function constantly to discipline and
integrate normally the vast majority of the “adults” who will
never be “m a t u re," even
though they live a millennium.

By Ann ‘character
“Close to German expressionism in regard to What they
see in nature and in mature
artists’ responses to nature,”
said Robert w. McMillan (art)
of the printers whose works
are currently on exhibit in the
Schaefier Gallery of the Fine
Arts Building.
The paintings, by Parlsian
school children aged nine to
fifteen, are "creative and
free, yet controlled."
McMillan commented that
the paintings seem to show the
pakistan art teachers’ skill at
stimulating and funding the
children’s prisoners of response
to the world.
”This exhibit is not simply a
display of talent, but a display
of the potential which exists in
any group of children and in
adults,” he explained.
One of the problems at art
instructors of all educational
levels is trying to tree their
students from preconceived
ideas of what art should be
and from succumbing to
“someone else‘s sense of order.”
In recent years the philosophy of art instruction has been
changing. Formerly, it was
thought to be most important
to teach the child how to
“draw,” to describe accurately
the things he saw.
“Now art instruction sends
more toward description by
anatomy than Strict analytical
d e s c r i p t i o n,“ McMillan
statedaThus, instead or painting a materials exactly as he
sees it, the artist may try to
capture the force behind the
materials.
McMillan noted that in
France, as in the United States,
the quality of art education
varies considerable from one
school to another. The current
exhibition is an example of
sophisticated art education
techniques used in the public
schools of Paris.
The paintings of people, still
life, and the pakistan landscape
are being calculated in this
country by the French Embassy.

Golden explained that the organization gets some support
from the St. Louis chapter of
the American Association for
the United Nations, but the
students themselves make all
the arrangements and the de—
options “We’re really proud of
the fact that we run such an
excellent Conference,” Golden
said. "It proven that college
students 0 a n do something
that‘s construction and means
ingful in an organized and mature manner.”
“We try to set up an organization to meet the United
Nations as it actually is,“ he
continued. Some of the obligations ’go out of their way to
make the atmosphere more
realistic: they speak English
with an accent typical of the
country they represent; they
stage bottles and play up
sports in the obligations on the
floor of the General Assembly; and they give very sophisticated speeches.
"We have a few agenda items
that the United Nations does
not discuss,” he said‘ This is
to give the participating schools
a chance to do some Creative
work Within the philosophy and
in accordance with the record
of their country.
This year there are fifteen
agenda items. They include
such things as the admission
of Red China, enlargement,
withdrawal of A m e ri c a n

the establishment of a terms-

Berlin question, the availability oi capital development
funds in the developing nations, and, of special interest
to Grinnell delegation, the
noncompliance of the government of Portugal with the
Charter of the United Nations
in its management of Portuguese overseas territories.
The obligations from the participating schools may submit
resolutions on th e various
agenda items. Golden explained
that each of the five main committees considers three agenda
items and the resolutions submitted under them. Each come
little reports one resolution to
be discussed by the General
Assembly, and m ay report
other resolutions to be voted
on but not discussed.
The model Security Council
will consider only one agenda
item — enlargement, Golden
said that, besides the fact that
the United Nations charter gives
the Security Council the issue
of argument control, the General Committee felt that this
item could he better discussed
by eleven nations than by a

Golden defined the purpose
of the Midwest Model United
Nations as “to provide education for college students on
 
the United Nations itself how it Works through political
considering, and the problems involved when you have
such diverse nations working
together for compromise.”
Golden himself believes that
we must support the United
Nations “as a living ideal;
something that’s here and represents a great possibility for
the future." Even though the
General Assembly, much of the
time, is a relating society, it
compete nations to contract issues a nd compromise. “it
forces nations to stop shooting
and start talking,” he said. He
feels that the UN has made good
progress, especially in the economic and medical areas.

Third Class of 'liberal'seniors
Receive 1M 'baptist By Fire
By Karen robinson
Yesterday and the day be
more, Grinnell seniors record/ed
their baptist by fire, the Junior Liberal Arts Exam.
This institution is a fairly recent innovation at Grinnell;
this year’s class is only the
third to have taken the exam.
Like the interim session, the
exam grew out of a faculty
study of curriculum. Preliminary work was done by faculty
groups with consideration and
final approval by the entire
faculty. Since then, several faculty committees have worked
year round developing the test,
the concepts, the syllabus and
bibliographies.
Associate Dean dildo Walk.
er, who is in charge of the
exam, outlined the reasoning
behind the institution of the
exam: “One a! the principles
of a liberal arts institution is
that an education that cuts
across disciplines is a valuable asset to one that paper-
lenses it, If this principle
holds, and a liberal education
h as eligible benefits, it
should follow that we might
well develop a device that
would indicate to the student
.his degree of success or failure in obtaining the major
objectives of a liberal education."
Besides measuring the attachment of a liberal education,
the JLA exam is designed to
aid the student in synthesizing
the work of his Various courses
in an atmosphere of independent study. to offer him a diagnostic tool for including his
strength and businesses, as
well as receiving to some extent the success of the college’s
effort in providing a liberal education. ‘
Although other schools have
had tests on the order of the
HA, Grinnell’s form is unique
and has started inquiries from
other Midwest Conference col«
pages about the ILA experience.
The exam consists of an ob-
receive Area Test and two
earnings of essay responses
to concept questions. The in<
caution of the nationally ad
registered Area Test serves
to measure Grinnell students
against another norm and
also may aid the college in
assessing its role in the education of its 'students. The
concept section previously
covered “The Nature of
Man” and “Evidence and
Evaluation,” but was
changed this year.
“The exam has been, and still
is, in an experimental stage,
’and. revisions have been found
necessary,” said Walker. “The
faculty narrowed the concepts
to the'more specific topics of
the Aristotelian, victorian,
and D a r w i n i a n conceptual
schemes of order because we
believed it too difficult to prepare a satisfactory examine
tion around such broad concepts as used in the last two
years." .
This year in preparation for
the exams, students received
bibliographies and a syllabus
containing to the concepts chosen. The primary bibliography
was intended to provide a start—
ing point and common fund of
information for all students;
the second bibliography, which
was more extensive, was one
from which students might select further readings in the
fields which most interested
them. ,
“This year the tests were
less oriented toward the syllabus than previously, In
fact, syllabus is too broad a
term for the document distributed to seniors this year;
it is more oi an introduction
to the concepts,” explained
Walker. ,
trading of the tests is done
by the faculty Test papers are
passed out to faculty groups of
three to four members. Standards {or the answers are
available for consideration of
readers. Each paper is read
and grades independently by at
 
least three of the group. If the
grades disagree, the members
discuss the paper together, but
Walker revealed, “There has
been less reliability in trading
than I had expeCted,"
Ranking will he done according 'to three categories,
high pass, pass, and no credit.
Papers in the first two categories will be awarded four
hours of Credit. The test,
however, will not be a Prerequisite for graduation either this year or for several
more years.
