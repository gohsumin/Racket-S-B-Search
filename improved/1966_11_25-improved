A number of factors were involved in the student leaders’

Makes Proposal
To the Edito .
The following is a short piece
submitted to the Executive
Cabinet at the all-students meeting, November 22.
l have a proposal to make.
First of all, I am assuming that
we want action on the long
range issues of open forms,
evolution of the faculty committee on student affairs, and
increased student participation
in college policy. in accordance
with this assumption I disagree
with the proposed method of
action, namely the executive
cabinet sit-ill. lt is a very draw
pic step to take. We are playing
all our cards at once and we
are breaking a rule. if our
move fails our lawlessness will
be customized by everyone. And
because there is little organization of the student body as a
whole, our move will he likely
to fail. Because this action has
seemed virtually spontaneous lo
the student body, many will
hold back for [ear of “pushing
into things" and “going too
for.” Certainly the faculty will
be awarded. The advantages of
organization in this case outreach the advantages of press
ing for our demands during a
period when matter sympathy
runs high.
Therefore, I propose a step
by step process organized and,
lawful and rational. By decorating our methods of protest one
step at a time we validity student unity and we give the administration time to think the
issue over. We give them an
opportunity to save face and
agree with us. Right now we
are backing them into a corner.
I propose the following sensitive step by step plan:
. Petition
. Resolution by the Senate
. Personal appeal by the
Senate to the President
. Executive cabinet within
. Campus sit-in
. designation by
officers
We can decide to make the
steps different. That can be
decided in registration later.
My main point is that we ought
to organize our movement realm
ist‘really with some chance of
success.
This proposal was made Wednesday night. Now that the action has been taken, however,
I find that as a student I must
support the executive cabinet
and senate in their goals and
activities. Nevertheless I urge
that concrete plans he calculated with long range goals in
mind.

Last Friday night, a professor told me that I

about it, I did, and I finally had to agree with
him. someone if, I an. assumed. The grammar
was terrible wash’t it? The paragraphs didn’t
flow easily, did they? Yes, i am assumed that
it was badly written. But I’m not assumed because I wrote it. As a matter of fact, far from
being assumed for my column, I am assumed
for my school. I am assumed that I have been
here so long and not become assumed of this
school until now. Yes, by God, I’m assumed.
So, now, “Why", you ask. Happy to online, of
course. There have been a great many things
said about the administration, what it’s doing,
what it’s not doing, and What it should do. My
question is now, “Has the school been acting in
conference?” I wonder if this school has any
conference at all. You continue to kick out the
most worthwhile and keep the most northwest
people; you maintain standards that are integrated and expect the student to remain quiet and
go slightly about his business; you push onto

Students interested in participating in the exchange next semester with cologne College,

Contact Richard centers (Associate Dean of the College) by

In a recent 8&3 survey, students who have already participated in the program and campus administrators who have
been involved in its planning answered questions about what a
Grinnell student should expect
in going to LeMoyne for a semester and mode suggestions as
to desirable attributes for the

was also included in this survey, but its response was too
slight to be considered real‘e»

Responses to the survey indicated dissatisfaction with the
selection process in the past.

that not enough students apply
for the exchange to allow for
competitive selection. Last year
he had to detroit students up to

The appointment of Tracy B,
Perry as a Grinnell College admissions connector has been

Perry, who joined the Grin.

will work principally in laws
and Illinois.

School in Buffalo, N.Y., and
llebron Academy in Hebron,
Me., Perry received a B.A. degree from Middlebury College
in 1961. He has done graduate

Buffalo and has also Studied at

Perry has held a position in

year.
tried and only one was sent to
LeMoyne with four women.
These students felt it bad policy
to send only one male.
it was also suggested in the
survey response that Grinnell is
only sending its “safe” students
— that less emphasis should be
put on accepting students with
good grades and more on those
who stand out normally, in ex.
tracurricular a C t i V l t i e s or
through a special talent.
Although one participant felt
that a special talent might
cause those around him to stand
in are, and, therefore, create
barriers to friendship, the others
considered a talent quite useful.
One respondent suggested,
“Why don’t they send someone
controversial who would be
missed? Send someone who is
public in his way of life. He
should be one who is actively
e god in extracurricular ac<
f as on campus — in the
newspaper, drama, art, for ex;
apple. If he is the type of person who stimulates those around
him here, he may do so also at
Lelvtoyne and at Grinnell again
when he comes back. More
people will gain from his experience."
The respondents generally
agreed that grades should be
either a secondary considered
tion in accepting exchange students or should be judges only
on a par with social attributes.
The ability to meet and get
along with people was greatly
emphasized.
One student proposed that an
applicant with less than a ‘0”
average should he considered if
other worthwhile activities were
programming him from obtaining
higher grades.
The qualities of fingering,
majority and motivation were
usually the first to be recommended by those questioned.
One Student stated, “Dissatis
fiction with Grinnell should not
he the major motivation.”
It was also the preliminary
opinion that primary motion<
tion for applying should be the
desire for a different cultural
experience and for the under—
standing that grows out of it.
Dale Terry (Registrar), who
helped [0 put the LeMoyne press
gray into effect several years
ago, mentioned that a semester
at LeMoyne should particularly concern those students interested in or majority In the social sciences.
There was a difference of
opinion as to whether the exchange program should necessarily affect the wider campus
community or whether its purpose should be limited to that of
individual experience and gain.
One participant Said, “The important and unique thing about
the program is that it is a student exchange, and Gzinnell
students go there as student:
and friends, not as recorders,
centuries, considers.” This response went on to state, "I personally felt that I received more
than I gave to the program."
Another approach was that
the exchange “wanted opportunity” when the available “diversity of background and epson'once is not shared on an ‘institutional level'.” F u r t h e r
(from a different response), the
opinion was held that exchange
students should be involved in
the larger Memphis community.
This former exchange student
listed groups on the LeMoyno
Campus itself which provide threads into such involvement.
Those who were of the opinion
that the exchange should have
a broader, rather man merely
individual, effect generally did
not feel this had been accomplished as the program now
stands.
Although one respondent said
that the exchange presents students from taking courses created at Gn'shell that they specifically want, the others emphasized that the experience itself is much more important
than classroom he might take
that semester.
When asked how graduate
schools View a student’s semester away from Grinnell on the
LeMoyne program, Mr, Terry
Said they don’t consider it fundamental to be involved in such
a program even though it means

The Real Problem
The recent suggestions of three students for
limitation: violations raise a number of important
problems for the college community. Steve Kent
dealt able with many of these in his speech
Wednesday evening in ARH auditorium. Such
roberts as the proposed change in women’s
ours, the need for a registration of the limitations policy, and the wellness of the college’s
counseling program require urgent attention.
But we think one problem above all others
services the whole situation and makes rational
consideration of these other concerns all but impossible This problem has to do with the old and
much caused concept of “in logo parental."
President suggest told the 5&8 in September
of 1965, "I don’t believe in the ‘in logo parental‘
concept. The time is gone when the administration
of a college can template student mobility; besides,
I look too young to be anyone’s father.”
Obviously, President suggest has either
changed his View or else he is consequently not
letting it affect his administration of the college.
There can be no doubt that the matter of the suggestions of the three students is a clearing case of
organizing students for failure to confirm to a set
moral code, determined by college officials.
The only real point to the regulation which
the students isolated and which makes it an offense for any off-campus men to have women in
their apartments is to forced students an opportunity for sexual activity.
The question, then, is whether the college has
any business operating a code of sexual conduct to
its students. The role of the residential liberal arts
college in developing the "total person" does reply
a responsibility of the college to help students form
habits of personal behavior which will contribute
to the fulfillment of their lives. Still, a responsible»
its to help is hardly a responsibility to picture as
{is presently being done in matters of sexual con~
act.
Surely, there are problems, perhaps grave
problems, in our whole society’s outlook on sex.
here problems cannon be solved by briefly ate
teaching to prevent any kind of intimate sexual
contact between students. in the first place, such
prevention is simply an impossible task. Sexual
activity goes on despite regulations and will continue to go on no matter how the rules are altered. ,
But more importantly, prevention, even if effective, does nothing to alter the basic misconceptions and unhealthy attitudes which people have
about sex. If they do anything at all, prevention
regulations are apt to add to built feelings and
compound our sexual problems. Such regulations
do nothing to execute students about the implied»
trans and consequences of sexual activity.
It seems to us that the college’s role should
be one of education not enlarge. if nothing else,
the college might aim toward the minimum goal
of enabling students, administrators and faculty
members to francis discuss sexual problems with»
out flashing. The intensity of even this simple
task should give some indication of the gravity of
the problems relating to the sexual conduct of
russell students.

that the penalty as later amended by Dean James Stauss to allow the students to get academic credit for this semester
and be suspended second semester was “in my opinion still too
severe a penalty, and a long
way from what i feel would be
a reasonable and available policy and penalty."
Beyond the particular cases
of the three students, Kent
felt that a number of other issues had been raised in recent Weeks which detailed
an expression of student concern. Kent said, “We feel
several oi the implications
need to be dealt with in the
very near future." ‘
Kent pointed first to the issue oi a change in women's
hours which he said seemed to
be getting “caught up in the
bureaucratic process oi discussion.” The student Senate has
already passed a resolution
calling for virtual evolution oi
women's hours and the resolution is now being considered by
the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs. Student leaders
asked the Committee and other
administration officials for ac»
lion which would put the hours
change into effect by the beginning oi the second semester.
The Committee and the Officials
have replied that nothing can
he done that fast,
Kent pointed also to the need
for discussion of a change in
the present limitation policy
which allows men and women
[0 Visit each other in their
rooms only on Sunday afternoon. Administrative officials
so far have virtually ruled out
the possibility or a change in
this policy and have refused to
discuss the problem normally.
Kent said he felt the problem
was or “great enough content
that it. requires the whole college community to go into it in
some depth with an eye toward
changing the policy.” _
A third area to which Kent
hoped Wednesday night's demonstration would draw attention
was the need for a registration of the college's counseling
program. Kent said, “We've
felt the need for this for a long
time." He Said that such a re
evaluation needed a “higher
priority” and that probably major changes would be needed in
the present program
The suspension oi the three
students had particular implications for die counseling pro<
gray because the violation
of which they were convicted
come lo light as a result of
the psychological problems of
a fourth student.
Kent next pointed to the
“dual almost contradictory
role” or the faculty committee
on student affairs which has an
important part to play in policy
decisions and must also serve
as an independent musicians in
lodging violations of policy.
Kent recommended that the
faculty committee on student
Affairs be displayed and replaced by a community court
system with both students and
faculty participating and that
another Committee on Student
Affairs composed of students.
faculty and means be formed to
handle policy considerations.
Kent concluded that Wednesday nights' demonstration was
intended to “make visit” the
students concern and to “force
a particular policy decision,”
and to “express upon people
the necessity of a registration.” Kent said he felt the violation was in “the best tradition of the present student got-
element." and thus reflected a
reasonable and rational ap«
breach to the problems at hand.
“After all,“ he said, “we are
certainly not accounting com—
plate anatomy."
Kent's speech was followed
by questions from the students
present. Most of the questioners
seemed eau ally concerned
about the questions of policy
Kent had raised, but some expressed the feeling that opened
violation the rule was too extreme a step. Jeff Burnhan-i
suggested, “It seems to me the
demonstration is procedure,"
and another student questioned
Whether the student leaders
might be jeopardizing their role
as negotiation.
The violation itself included
all but two of the AWS Board
members and all but four of
the CofHP members, as well as
four members of the Executive
Cabinet. One of the containing
AWS Board Members was out
of town and one of the containing soil-1P members shared he
might jeopardize his financial
scholarship if he participated.
The other four felt the violation
was too extreme a step to take.
The fifth Executive Cabinet
member, Bob Johnston, didn't
participate because it was felt
that as social coordinator, he
was not an enforcement official.
The need for some kind of
demonstration of the student
leaders’ concern became apparent to the five members of the
Executive Cabinet earlier in the
week. The five include. besides
Kent, Bob quote, CofnP press—
sent, Karen Lauterbach, AWS
Board President. Bond Faulwellv
Speaker of the Senate, and Bob
Johnston, Social Coordinator.
In discussions among them
serves und with other students
and friendly faculty members.
the Executive Cabinet finally
decided late Tuesday upon a
violation of the limitations rule
by the AWS Board and CDIHP.
The possibility of a mass student violation was rejected as
irresponsible and uncontrollable. The Executive Cabinet felt
that the smaller demonstration
would be more likely to have
construction effects as an evidence of student concern.
The students participating
in the violation met Wednesday night shortly before Midnight in sales Hill. According to college regulations it
was actually illegal for the
women to be in the hall after
10:30 pm so they were, in
effect, guilty of an offense
simply for stopping in the
door.
About 12:30, the student:
split into three groups, one going to the Clark Hall President's suite and the third remaining in Gates. They spent
the night sleeping on coaches
and in sleeping bags on the
ﬂfor. The women left early
Thursday morning to return to
South Campus.
All of the women had signed
out in accordance with college
regulations, giving north Campus as their destination. Thus,
they are not technically guilty
of a violation of women’s hours
or oi illegal absence.
There has not yet been any
official college reaction to the
violation. College offices were
closed yesterday for the
Thanksgiving Holiday, and
President Glenn suggest has
been out of town until today.

Knowlton was seen with the
girl who is now home on medical leave in the Forum on the
night of November 12. Both he
and the girl were slightly drunk
at the time and there was some
trouble with Forum officials but
they were not asked to leave the
Forum as has been removed.
That night Knowlton and the
girl went to the of! campus
apartment on Sixth Avenue
where both Knowlton and Hanenberg live.

known on campus as “Mimi,"
was also spending the night at
the apartment. Kenneth Adel.

very recently dated the girl who
was with Knowlton, became
aware that she was at the apartment, and Bi about 2:30 arm.

the apartment with a friend or
his, Nordahl true, senior, in an
attempt to get the girl to re—
turn to her form. The girl did
not want to leave and a heated
discussion followed between her
and sherman. She told the 5&3
that some physical force was
used on her by sherman in the
attempt to make her leave the
apartment. She said she might
have agreed to return to her
form ii sherman had “not been
so pussy” and were it not for
her tear or being caught trying
to enter the form through a
Window. She said that Knowlton
did not try to make her stay;
he left the decision up to her.
During the disturbance Anderson was seen by both true and
sherman, although sherman
told the 5&3 he did not know
who she was or that she was
even a student at Grinnell. He
said that he was simply not
concerned with the then universities girl. true, who did know
Anderson, said that he did not
union—m Adelinan at her identity
until Monday morning.
sherman told the 5&3 that he
had been concerned about the
welfare of his former girlfriend
recently because she was behavior in a way much different
than she usually does. sherman
had Called the girl's father several times that weekend in an
attempt to get him to do something to help. Her father asked
her sister. it student in another
Midwest college, to come to
Grinnell to vi 't the girl. The
sister came during the weekend and checked on the girl but
returned to college Sunday.
sherman, still concerned about
the fact that nothing was being done to help the girl, talked
to Henrerork cleaner, English,
Monday in the early afternoon.
cleaner, a personal friend oi
sherman’s, told the 5&3 he
thought something should be
done and he went to see Dean
of Women Alice Law that afternoon. cleaner told the 5&3 that
Adelmsn had mentioned the
presence of “another air" but
that he did not know whether
she was a town girl or a student. cleaner said he passed this
information on to Dean Low and
Dean ot Men S. Eugene Thompson.
cleaner said the other two
people (l-lanenberg and Anderson) were Significant to Adel»
man because they would do
nothing to help. sherman told
the 5&3 that he “was not and
is not now” concerned about
Hanenberg and Anderson.
When cleaner was asked by
the 5&3 ii he thought the then
unknown girl would be in
trouble if she was found out he
said, "I assumed that it she
was a student and they did find
out there would be trouble —this was only a passing config«
italian on my part. it you get
caught you get caught."
cleaner went on to say, "The
issue is not whether students
can experiment with sex — only
how they go about it. For all
practical purposes their crime
(referring to l-lsnenberg and
Anderson) was getting caught. 1
think' for purposes at rationale,
in teen-lab! the committee decision, their crime was that
they did not take some measures to help these people (referring tn sherman and the
girl). I don't think the committee was upgrading a moral
structure. 1 think they were removing {rom campus people
who are not contributing to the
campus or who are not geneﬁking from the campus."
cleaner explained. “I haven’t
the southwest idea if suspension
will do these individuals any
good H only time will tell. i
don't think the loss of these
two people (Hanenberg and Anderson) will do the college any
ham.”
He added, “The major consequence, ! suppose, [mm the
committee’s point at view, is
that the college is willing and
able to maintain the integrity
of its rule structure. The college is not in u position to
provide an environment that
gets in the way of its primary
function, education. Unlimited limitation, limitation from
1:00 A.M. 3:00 A.M., computational llvmg arrangements,
are not in the best interests of
education. The college is revised as primarily an institution of education — not learning how in live. i think we
can provide boys and girls
with better ways of learning
about each other, but not by
letting them play house."
When asked it he would turn
other violations in to the means,
cleaner Said, “If I {tel that a
person is doing himself damage, others damage, or the col
legs damage. I will report him."
The Stu! has defining knowledge
that cleaner is personally aware
of at least three other visits-
tions and/or hours violations
that took place recently.
Early this week cleaner was
invited to explain his part in the
case to the members of James
Hall. Some of the girls present
expressed tear or talked to a
faculty member or admi senator in a supposed “controlling
situation” about another student
in trouble, even if the student is
"obviously psychotic," w h e n
there are other people involved
that may become implicated.
The students said the chance of
suspension for innocent bystanders is too much of a price to
pay-

I don’t really think I am focusing the means; i don’t

involved.“
At this interview cleaner told
the 5&3, “The means knew

a price that I‘m still willing

The girl on “medical leave”
was taken out of class Monday
by Dean Low and Dean Thompson and taken to a hospital in
Newton for “observation.” Her
father later came and took her
home. At this point it is thought
that Dean Thompson did not
know of the identity Elf Anderson, but there has been calculation that Dean Low found out
while taking the girl to Newton. The 5&3 has not yet been
able to verify this.

MacAlpine said that Thompson

When asked by the 58:3 about
Hanenberg and Anderson, MacAlpine said, “[ console elierything they have done, because

talk to sherman in his room in
Cowles Monday evening. Dllr<
ing the conversation that followed the name ‘Mimi” was
overheard by a member or
Cowles, but he told the 5&3
that he "didn't tell anyone

Hanenberg later told the 5&3

Thornton explorer Relationship
Between Psychology and Religion
Psychological insights into the
nature oi religion were explorer
by G. l... Thornton, psychology,
in a lecture and discussion last
Sunday night.
Thornton cited four essential
components or religion. These
are recognition of a superior,
controlling force; the perception or man as subject to this
power; a need to understand
and explain man's position relative to this force; and appeals
to this supernatural force for
assistance. support and guidance.
He then travel the role of
psychology in explaining religion, beginning with John Watson, who denied the psychological value of consciousness, thus
separation psychology (mm religion. The acceptance ol evolution eliminated psychology, as
well as biologyi as a way to
understand man as a religious
being, proud treated religion as
neurosis, an explanation not
very well accepted in theoretical circles.
Thornton indicated that his
thoughts would be those of a behaviorist psychologist, saying
that “methods. logic, techniques
and skills that have proved effective in explaining and under
standing many areas of human
behavior can also be applied
with no abilities to the area
or religious behavior." The pay—
checklist attempts to understand and predict human beta—
vior which the individual perceived as being religious, taking
as an essential promise the fact
that all religious behavior is
learned and that there is no interactive religious improve.
Religious experience, worship
and prayer were the three areas
of religious behavior discussed.
In the first case, Thornton cited
instances of a supernatural be«
ing communication with man,
or oi man experiencing options
or, more approximately, communications. paul’s experience of encountering an monthly minutes<
nation of the supernatural force
can he explained in terms oi the
physical stresses produced by a
period oi extreme heat which
has been known to cause perception discussions. It is noted
that options are always culturally relevant. What is participated is some fool of what is
already known to the person.
For instance, the most devout
Hindu mystic has never confused up a vision or the Blessed
Virgin. Thornton also mentioned
the use of LSD and other drugs
as producing psychologically
and physiologically similar results.
“Worship as an every documentation of religion provides the
individual with the feeling that
he is instrumental in‘ some
small way in controlling a now-
ertiil force which is seen as
both destruction and benevolent," said Thornton. “The
signs and greetings or his religious group are powertully reiniorcing in that they provide
a source of identity. The acts of
his religion reinlorce and
strengthen his commitment to
his particular religious group.”
Such acts initially were a re
spouse to [ear and anxiety. A
cause and effect relation was
established between the performing of a certain act and
the termination at a hearing phenomenon, such as a hurricane.
Prayer operates in the same
way. “Petitiunary prayers perl
list, not because they are ‘answered,’ but because they have
value as a psychological device
to reduce anxiety, provide security, and give the individual
the impression he is doing
something.”
