Richard winter‘s.
The penalties, as issued by the faculty
committee on student affairs, were originally to have included the discussed of the

residents of the basement that Thompson

North Campus Problem
Assessment Underway
By BOB HODIERNE
Discussion continues about the
“North Campus Problem" whether it exists and, if it does, what
to do about it.
Grinnell’s President Glenn suggest said in an interview last
week that “Dean centers and I
both are personnel that the residence hull system is working well
in some calls and not so well in
others."
“The ‘North Campus Problem’
has a variety of causes, some ol
which have no relation to the residence hall system," said Dr. suggest, Some of the causes he list
ed included a small town location, the level or academic pressure, nonexistent supervision except by students, students having
been reader in a permission atmosphere, and pressure from
the general state of the world,
especially the threat that the war
in diet Nam presents to college
men.
When asked if he was dlSSEtlSe
died With the way the Student
Government Association had enhanced rules, Dr. suggest said,
“Yes, In some cases. But what I
don’t know is if it's the system
or opportunity leaders."
The Executive Council of the
faculty, which has been discussing
the problem “very informally”
for about a month now, feels that
“anti-intellectualism is pretty president on north campus," according w Dr. suggest. “There is
excessive moral bestiality in the
residence hall system," he added.
Calling himself an “idealist."
Dr. suggest said the calls ought
 
to “satisfy two needs-one practical, one idealistic."
The practical needs, said Dr.
suggest, include being “quiet enough for study, ordered and tiny
enough to be clean, and well
enough regulated ill- respect for
privacy, possibilities, and proper,”
The idealistic needs of the calls
as outlined by Dr. suggest included a reflection at the “ongoing
academic and educational pmgram, The transition from class,
library and lectures to hall life
should be natural. It should not be
from one life to another."
The president went on to say,
in the same idealistic vein, that
“there Should be a feeling of a
community of young scholars."
He also arrested that he is
“pages not to be represented as
a man who has a ‘thing' about
the residents nail system.“
Several o! the proposals that
have been discussed by the Exec
drive Council at one time or another included financing the calls
by class. One suggestion was to
put all the freshmen together in
several calls With upperclass advisors. A second suggestion would
have had the seniors living to
seller with related housing regulations. "I haven't heard much
about lihese proposals recently,"
said Dr. suggest.
Dr. suggest commented that
whatever change is selected—
and it seems certain that some
change will be made—the “Validity of the program should relate
to how it improved the education<
al atmosphere and not be just a
group of ‘don'ts‘ for students."

To the Editor:
The Student Senate three weeks
ago rejected by a vote of 14-7 8
proposal to give $15 to the Des
points Project. The primary argument for not giving money was
that money allocated for social
purposes shouldn’t be used ice anything other than social events. because of the Senate‘s record in
consistently voting money to the
National 5 t u d e n ts Association,
which certainly dress’t provide
social opportunities for more than
one or two Gl‘innell students, Ind
the restriction implications it has
for the jurisdiction ot the senate,
found this argument intensive.
Upon further discussion alter the
meeting, one senator indicated he
used this argument or social funds
only for social purposes merely as
. front, and he opposed the prev:
eat for another reason. He didn't
think the project was being run
efficiently and involved expenditures of money with few or no subItan '3], positive results. It is this
criticism of the structure and eiiectiverless of the Des points
project on which I focused fly ab
mention and traveler to Des points
in hopes of learning more about
the program.
I spent about four hours in Des
points with Billy King, who is on
handling the Des points Project.
using this time we took pictures
of a house that had faulty wiring
and poor routing. The occupied
was going on rent~5tribe until the
house was required and wanted a
record of the complaints. We
spent the rest of the day visiting
people in the neighborhood. Many
of the people were Billy's friends
and the calls were little more than
social ones. But in the afternoon
we called on strengths, telling
them at the project and visiting
their participation.
The project was far enough
along so that meetings or neighborhood people were held to discuss their mutual problems and
possible solutions. Discussion topics ranked 1mm neighborhood recreational sites they would like _to
start in order to keep their children on the streets to regulations
on pets. 50 tar Billy has been the
main force behind organizing and
direction these committee meetings. He is presently trying to find
someone from the neighborhood
willing to assume championship of
the committee. because oi the
community’s historical failure or
participation in the democratic,
selfrgovernment process, this assumption of the chair by one of
the community is very important.
it means that the committee and
neighborhood improvement can
continue well after Billy's departul'e.
On first glance the personal visa»

where Grinnell students do odd
jobs filing houses, etc, and even
the neighborhood meetings may
appear insignificant and even misdirected in lighting poverty. But
there is a theory behind all these

community development, which is
used exclusively by the Peace
Corps in fighting poverty abroad.
