Social Budget Independence fixed
As Senate Meets for last Time
By ANN KIRSCHNER
Meeting {or the last time in its
current form Wednesday, the senate discussed a recommendation

from that of the student government.
President .kerry forward said
that the proposal was “not in the
interests of the Grinnell student
community,“ although he felt that
the committee’s other recommendations were “thoughtful and excellent and nobody the social ideas
we would like to see on this campus.”
forward said that the Senate is
in a good position to reflect where
the emphasis in programming
should be, because it votes on the
budget. Acceptance of the social
com in i the e's recommendation
would mean that it would be on a
fixed fee exempt from the budgetry process and safe from budget reductions. The means of apartment would be transferred from
the Senate in the administration.
forward said, “The students
should have control through their
elected representatives as to how
their money is spent."

The ‘Ad doc' Committee
sensitive appointments to President suggest’s Ad doc,
Committee on Hall Reorganization were made this week. The ,
appointments now again suggest’s approval. The three faculty members named to the committee by chairman of the
committee, associate dean Richard centers, are Luther ericsson (chemistry). R. women Norton (history). and Henry-York
cleaner (English) The students named to the committee bye
Jerry forward, SGA president, are Steve Kent, SGA presidentelect, Karen Lauterbach, AWS Board presidentelect, and
Bob quote, CofHP president-elect.
As soon as this committee is approved and meets it will
receive from the Executive Council of the faculty a series of
proposed changes in the housing system. it is upon these
proposals that the committee will act. From these proposals
they will make recommendations to President suggest. The
nature of these proposals will be of great interest to the entire campus and when they are released it is hoped that the
student representatives on the Ad doc committee Will make
a real effort to consult with the students as a whole about
the recommendations.
The working of this Ad doc committee should, by all in-
locations, be a very difficult
task. President suggest, who
called the committee together, has committed himself to
some sort of change in the housing system. He has gone on
the record as saying that “there is excessive moral bestiality
in the residence hall system” and that it packs the “flexibility
it needs. suggest has also indicated that the Executive Council, which is making the proposals that will be the Ad doc committee’s raw material, feels that ”anti-intellectualisin is pretty
president on south Campus."
0n the other hand, the student members are just as firmly committed to the opposite stands In a letter to the_editor
on October 8, 1965, SGA president-elect StevegKent said that
“Personally I have no prices with the present hall’systems and
I think there is much to recommend it.” quote, i_n asimilar
way, feels that the present system should be maintained ~‘
and said so while campaigning for CofHP president.
How this conflict is resolved should be interesting. i
think the Ad joe committee should keep the student body
posted on the progress it is making. This, after all, is a problem with which we’re all concerned.
To Study City During Break
”The Inner City Project is not
I social workers‘ convention," asrcrls Dennis Spencer, cochairman
oi the social action committee of
the Board of Religion.
“The students who participate
in the project are not on a mission
to clean up the sluts. They will
be going in order to become acquainted with the poveriyslricken
sections at large cities."
The program will take place' in
Chicago, Sr. Louis, and New York
over spring break, and Spencer indicated thai people who are interested in the program should contact him or Charlene Ellis by
Tuesday.
Spencer emphasized that students will have an opportunity to
go out on their own in who: he
called the “neighborhood lounge."
"They will have a chance to
really calls with the people and understand their problems. With all
the talk about the ‘regular city'
there is a growing concern about
the urban situation, The Inner City
Project provides the opportunity
 
lot students to leave their ivory
tower and gain an understanding
and appreciation of the problems
that face our society.”
In the ”neighborhood lounge”
students can go out on the streets
and just talk to people, or get a
job for a day as a labeled and
work next lo the people they are
trying to know. Spencer told of
how two Gi'infections, posing as a
married couple, went from door to
door last year telling handhelds
they were looking for an apartv
merit and talking to the people in
me buildings about living wonder
tions and their outlook on life in
general.
One church in each city arranged
for living accommodations. and
while the students Work in a fairly
loose framework, there are planned
events such as a welfare tour, visits to slim schools, and meetings
w i t h community organizations.
Spencer said that students are expected to provide their own trailsporiarion to die cities and should
bring about $25 spending money.

night. Each card will contain only
the name of the personality most
like the owner of the card. There
will be no opposite named since it
would be too hard ﬁusing one‘l
opposite among the 655 other participants. Instead, names of two other individuals most nearly matched
with a student will be placed in
the mailboxes several days later.
Twenty-three students were not
matched up because oi improved
scoring, no name on the sheet or
a missing sheet, or because they
did not tablilale their results.
The program procedure for the
matching was handled by the University of Iowa. Since the computer Could only handle 300 possibilities at once, the 686 names were
divided into three nearly equal
groups; the division was made by
height so that usually the boy will

crime/lion Describes Peace [0 5 Experiences
ED. NOTE: This year ls the
Peace Corps’ smith anniversary and
tomorrow the Peace Corps place-
‘ment exam will be administered
on Campus. reply Wilhelm, a
sophomore and co-editor of the
cycling, was a volunteer. He
joined the Peace Corps after graduation from high school and served
a year in Bolivia before he was
injured in a jeep accident. Below
‘is an interview between Wilhelm
and John Wolf about Wilhelm’s
year in the Peace Corps.
By JOHN WOLF
Q: Where did you work and
what was your job there?
A: I worked on a organization
project (ﬁcancer by the us. Agen<
cy for international Development)
that responded tin owners and others
from the highlight of Bolivia to
previously uninhabited areas which
are potentially very productive agriculturaily. This new area was located in the singles in the eastern
zoophilia ot the under, My job was
that of a “Community developer,"
which is the Peace Corps’ term
for a person who goes into a community, leaves to understand it,
. and then tries to work with the
people in any way that he thinks
may benefit them. This may be
helping build roads — as We did
— teaching in schools, helping the
people organize politicians, and in
some Cases, even working in coaching or recreation programs. although there is some doubt about
how much real good this type of
activity does.
Q: Exactly what did this retail for you?
n: i was sent there to help in-
.small electrical systems in the villages, since i had had several summary’ experience in that line, But
upon training, it was quickly apparent that there was not going
to be electricity in this area
for years to come, This just
as well because they would proc-
. able have had very little use for it
anyway. So alter a integrating
month of trying to figure out what
to do, I turned my attention to
helping people earn more money
from their Crops. This included
various activities such as introducing tomatoes as a cash crop,
setting up a tomato-box cooperative, and experimenting with var-

kinds were best for that region,
and helping build roads.
Q: What did the solutions
think of you and your fellow
workers?
A: Most of them had previously
had little if any Contact with Americans. Generally, though, they did
have some ideas about them. such
as “All Americans are rich”
(which they are, relatively speak.
ing), “President Kennedy and
Jackie are good people." and
"America has racial problems."
Initially the vibrators were some

soon got used to us and we to them. _
For the most part they were sim- 2

papers' help we built about eight
miles of much-needed road. The
first road was named John F. Kennedy Avenue by the vibrators. The
vibrators three uS a huge, drunken
brand when the first road was finished, and the chief of one of the
villages offered his Wife to one of
the volunteers for the night. He
didn't accept — it Wouldn’t have
been the strategic thing to do.
Q: Some people say the Peace
Corps is just a tool for batteries
the U.S. image abroad. How do
you reach to this?
A: I’d say in many cases that's
ward than most Americans. Most ‘ ,
of the minor Bolivian government
officials that we worked with were,
however, often not so nice, We role
answers had numerous disagreements with them, and one volunteer, who, by the way, is now
Peace Corps administrator in Ed
civil, got in such a heated argument with his village government
chief that the government man
said he would quit if the volunteer
didn't leave. He didn’t leave, and
the man quit. The volunteer was
then appointed village chief.
Q: What were some other interesting incidents?
A: when the farmers began
growing more tomatoes than they
could carry out on their banks, it
became apparent that they needed
some roads built. Therefore, another volunteer and I set out trying to get a bulldozer. We asked
U.S.-A.T.D. in LaPaz for the loan ”
of a bulldozer, but they women‘t
very hot on the idea or on us. one
of the AID. men later Said that
his group was angry that the Peace
Corps was getting all the publicity
from the press while his group
was having a hard time getting
money from Congress for what he
considered more important work.
About a month later, still without a bulldozer, I got mad and sent
a letter to largest deliver asking
for help. However. the letter never
got out of Bolivia because our project administrator interpreted it.
He said it didn’t reflect well on the
group. We had a lot of trouble with
him; however, he was eventually
"cal d to Washington for consultation" and never seen again.
Meanwhile. the American ambassador heard about our flight
and instructor U.S.-A.I.D. to send
us a bulldozer. We didn't know how
to operate it other than how to
make it go in a straight line, out
we soon learned. With the via-

films for entertainment. These
films, more often than not, were
pubmed-in American items showing
the better aspects of Us. life, or
at least the wealthier aspects.
Q: What did you think of the
training program for the Peace
Corps?
A: For my Bolivian group, the
training program was probably
less a training program than it
was a selection process. Eventually, we lost 40 per cent of our
group, mainly for psychological
reasons, They didn't try to teach
us any specific skill; instead most
«out
of the time was spent learning
Spanish and some general things
about Bolivia, the 11.5., and health
problems we would encounter in
Bolivia. These health hazards include directory, snakebites, montreal disease, and insert-home
diseases — including Chagas disease, which is contractor from
beatles rating the victim on the lip
while asleep causing sudden death
from heart paralysis some years
later.
We also had several anthro ins
structure, who ”told us about Bolivian people." They were so con—
corner with the addition of the culture, social you-systems, history oi.
the people that even the people
didn’t know about, and the like,
that we ended up with a very dis-
 
l
 
sorted picture that the Bolivian
people were really different from
us; they women‘t. These days. the
Peace Corps is putting less stress
on anthropological training. This
is not to say that a detailed knowledge of the culture is not helpful,
only that things must be kept in
proper perspective.
Q: What did you like about the
Peace Corps?
Al For a young person, the
Peace Corps is probably an under—
alleged opportunity to be out on
your own in an out-times difficult
situation. it is a chance to really
apply yourself in a practical way,
dealing with practical problems
and working with real people in a
real world. For someone who has
been in a college such as Grinnell,
it may at first be somewhat of a
_ shock to be totally responsible for
* yourself and what you do, and for
the people with whom you work:
much may he at stake.
Several years from now, when
a Bolivian is carrying tomatoes to
market on the road from his village, he may not remember much
about you or the US, but his family will be better fed because you
were there, and you will probably
be better off, too.
