The Executive cabinet has per:
vcrtcd the foundations of student

our right and have decided that
student government is not for

trans have ignored the requests
and rights of the students in
their quest for selfraggi‘independent.
WHEN QUESTIONED about
the Missisippi resolution, 104

its anonymous approval of such

Now rm going to approach
this seriously. My friends often
tell me that communist is

That it provides noble common

And that. by its control of the

said that from the inner city
one can see what is happening
in the entire world.
genetics listed three main
revolutionary iorecs which are

which can he seen brown the

Ralph Kirkpatrick, regarded
by some as “the world's greatest
harpsichordist," will open this
year’s concert series with performances Friday and Saturday
next week at a p.m. in Roberts
theater. .
Kirkpatrick's early - reputation
as an “authority,” established
by his relatively tcp writings
and editions, has been followed
by his general recognition as a
performer oi the ﬁrss rank
He has- long been known to
music lovers ol this country. but
recently has expanded his ea—
rear to the extent that his para
torinanees abroad now output—
her those in the United States.
in addition to determining‘at
the Vienna, Berlin, Edinburgh.
Lucerne and Allsbach festivals,
Kirkpatrick has been welcomed
by numerous countries as an
interpreted of their own music.
He has been engaged to play
charlotte in Italy. Mozart and
Haydn in Vienna, English music
in London and French music at
Versailles.
Besides making harpsichord
recordings, Kirkpatrick has recorded his clavichord playing
and has performed on the eight
acnllrcentury piano and the
modern piano. ,
Reservations for the Kirkpatrick harpsichord concert must
be made in advance at the student union from lo a.m to l2
noon or from 2:30 to 4:30 pm.

Young is quick to expensive
that describing tricks is not at

merely a demonstration oi the

THE SPORT of kaiatc is similar to boxing with the addition
