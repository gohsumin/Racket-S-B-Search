Faulwell Named Speaker;
Senate endorsed Interim
By MARTHA BERKEY
Senior Bond Faulwell was
unanimously elected to fill the
designed sponsorship of Dan
Bucks at the Senate meeting
Nov. 2, He was nominated by
SGA president Steve Kent and
ran unopposed. in a Statement
distributed to senators prior to
‘ the meeting. Kent cited paul-
well’s "extensive experience in
student government as a member of the Senate and as a
house president? in making his
formal nomination.
This year Faulwell has
served as a discussion leader
at engagement, is a member at the Senate Committee
on academic Life and has
participated in the planning
[or an interim session at the
beginning or next semester.
After his election he told the
5&1? that he would be concerned immediately primarily
with reviewing the Senate. He
said he (on that the ground
work for action had been laid
and now was the time In em
act ideas.
In the absence ot a speaker,
SGA president Steve Kent provided. He opened the meeting
with an address on the Senate
and its function in SGA in
which he expressed hope that
the Senate could “usually" be
a place where student opinion
may be expressed. It would
deal with problems on an additions scale at the committee
level. He stated that at this
time the solution to problem
does not lie in the creation of
more committees, as the existing structure is already “awfully additions." Kent called for
a “clear definition or objectives" as the next step in com<
little functioning, replacing
that “implementation is ninetenths of the battle once they
get an idea."
In other action Wednesday
night, the Senate unanimously
endorsed the proposed interim
session to precise the beginning of second semester. Chairman pic McDowell presented a
sensitive outline schedule of

four election seminars, each of
which would meet three times,
plus mother types or discussions
and activities. The period would
run from Sunday, Jan. 8,
through Sunday, Jan. 15. This
would mean a return to campus three days early for participating Students. Prior to
warning the Senate‘s support,
the interim proposal had been

Editorial . . .
SGA President Steve Kent’s nomination of Bond
Faulwell to tile Senate speaker'sl‘zip was a praisewortliy
choice, The Senate badly needs steady, businesslike leadership at this crucial junction in the college’s life.
Seldom have so many important matters been before
the Senate as at the present time, badly, seldom, too,
has tale organizational control of that august body been
so shake. Faolwell shows the stainless signs of any of tale
candidates of being able to strengthen out the mess.
It is to be hoped that action on the women‘s hours
rules will pass the Senate in the next week or two and
that action will be taken shortly on several of the other
areas discussed in the October 11 “Extra" edition of the
8&8.
These measures should be weights carefully, but if
they are to escape the nurse of the magnitude of conscious
planning committees of past years, action must be taken
soon.
The 53:13 wishes Faulwell the best of luck in his coming tasks. We reserve the right to be less kind later, however, if construction proposals, like last week‘s interim
proposal, for instance, are not soon forthcoming.
Applications are now being accepted for the son Editorship. The new term will run from second semester thru first
Semester, 1966. Applications, which should include a statement oi purpose and suggestions for changes in the son, are
to be sent to H. Y. cleaner, English. Applications are due

A Review
"Gospel" Coming of Strand
By JON MEGIBOW
It seems that there is a very
simple promise upon which all
biblical spectacles are produced: expenses of money and
special effects are directed
professionals to overall business and religious intensity.
The outstanding products of this
genre are C. B. vehicle’s
“King oi Kings" and George
Stevens‘ “The Greatest Story
Ever Told.” Movies of this
genre begin with a minimal him<
bus and end with a Mardi Gras
cruciiixion, leaving the viewer
With a feeling that the Bible
was originally ti Broadway musical. The certification for this
method is that through the ef—
facts and spectacles the viewer is given a contemporaneous
representation that he can more
easily assimilate. With Jesus
played by an state Kirk Douglas
and Salome played by a nearnude AnnrMargaret the picture’s intention becomes clear.
Among the many feelings of
this genre the worst seems to
be that neither the director nor
the producer has any faith in
the document upon which the
movie is based.
In radical contrast to these
Hollywood fairy tales is a simple film, The Gospel record-
ing to St. Matthew,” which will
be shown at the Strand Theater
November 13716. The director,
tier carlo gasoline, was limited by a very tight budget but
has turned this to his asian<
page. There are no professional
actors and ice setting, southern
Italy, is completely natural.
The most obvious advantage is
that there is no contamination
between the actor's personality
and acting role. Beyond the
fact that Christ is played by a
Spanish student, antique lrazoqui, the whole film has an air of
complete, interventions S|m<
ability. gasoline uses this to his
advantage by concentration on
the faces of the actors, showing
very little consideration for importance of role. The extras,
generally farmers and workers,
have faces that, in their crude
news and simplified, span the
time barrier that separated the
viewer from the action. This
naturalism is reinforced by the
setting. gasoline uses ancient
sluts and near-rules for the
action, but brands these with
the characters, giving them a
strange beauty. The opening sequence has Mary framed in the
ancient archive of her house
and the resulting effect gives
an impression of a indicate
medieval nothing. The Last

No Problem Seen
{according/ii monitored at left
By HAROLD FUSON
“In the University or college
we have a need for art that
leads ~ art that is a little ahead
oi the moresiii we always do
what the public wants, we will
never progress.” This is how
one University oi Iowa pi-ones—
for views the role at the arts in
academic life.
Dr. Samuel seeker, Professor of Speech and Dramatic Art
and Director of TV, Radio and
Films, was more vocal than
some oi the University or iowa
faculty and students the 5&3
talked to last week, but his
views were typical.
Because of the recent sensor-
copper is in a common tavern
where the discusses eat step
and sit on the dirt floor.
The only dialogue is that at
the Bible, without the supervisors interpretations of a scenario The directory between
Christ, the son, oi God, and
Christ, the man, is handled in
an unusual way. Christ‘s actions
and speeches are those of the
son or God, but the setting and
physical appearance or the ac<
for produces the opposite, hu<
minister, effect. As Christ approaches his crucifixion he becomes more and more shorttempered with everyone around
him. The only kindness and
love are for the children. The
miracles are performed without
the typical january and multicolored lights. They are under.
tones by the simplified oi the
language and by the start, almost warren cinematography.
The question of music is difficult to analyze. gasoline uses
each, Pmkotiev, Odetta, and
the Congolese “visa Luha."
The only piece that is really out
of place is Odetta's “Some
times I Feel Like a Motherless
Child." But this is because an
Italian audience would not be
involved with the words, only
the Voice. The searching effect
of the “visa cuba,” and the
music in general, add quite a
bit to the movie.
The deficiencies are amazing
in their pettlness. 0n the whole
the cinematography is quite
good, except for the excessive
use of the telephone lens. Yet,
there are points where shots
are just floppy — the camera
shipped a face and then re—
turned quickly, like an unconscious comic duubledake. This
is also true of the editing, almost always superb, but wireless at points. Another playback is not the fault of the
ﬁlm. Inevitably when a movie
is pubmed rather than presented
with sub-titles something is lost.
This is especially true in a film
whose action is so slow-faced
and mechanical, where there is
little dialogue.
This film was shown two
weeks ago to religious leaders
team both college and town
communities. Their opinion
was generally favorites but
don’t use that as an excuse for
not seeing this film. It is worthwhile to anyone who is sick or

ship of a Grillnell student publication oi Eugene Ionesco’s
play, The Chairs, the son has
been exploring the problem oi
membership in all areas of academic life.
in general, we found students
at Iowa had little [ear that any
of their serious work might be
centered by University officials.
The faculty indicated that limits
on students' work were consistency with practice in the pl‘oieS<
signal world of art, drama and
photography.
Gate deeper Needed
Asked about the Grinnell incident, Dr. seeker said, “All oi
us are against the principle or
membership.” However, he added,
“Somebody has to be a kind of
gatekeeper,” He said the main
criteria such a gatekeeper must
act upon is taste. He added,
“I mean artistic not moral
taste."
Dl'. seeker said it would be
difficult to say just who the
gatekeeper should be, but “i
don’t think a university president can put himself in the position oi sensor. The president
must hire faculty with artistic
judgment.”
Ii the president is too often
at odds with his faculty, Dr.
seeker said, ”He has to get
rid of them and get somebody
else. How can a president who
is not an artist, who is not a
theater man, judge what is
good and bad."
Asked about the impact of
questionable works of art on the
college's image in the outside
world, Dr. seeker said, "Anyone
in an administrative position has
to be extremely careful about
lodging a work for the wrong
reasons. it a production is dramatically honest, even if it inn't
the best public relations, the
administration must go along
with it.
“I think obviously an adding
operator risks a great deal in
providing this sort of freedom.
It takes a lot of gets to do it. It
has always been recognized that
this land or policy gets you in
trouble sometimes. oil! in the
truly great colleges and universities this policy has been
upheld."
Part of Leadership
Dr. seeker indicated that this
risk was part of the college’s
role as a leader. He said "Part
oi the administrator’s job is to
execute the public about what a
college or university is, what
kind of environment it takes to
culture creativity.”
To its own students the college has a similar responsibility, Dr. seeker added. The college must challenge and broader the student's master. He said.
“At a place like Grinnell, Iowa,
and Iowa City, Iowa, it is very
important to jar students into
thinking about things they never
thought about. We’ve got to
create an environment that
makes it virtually impossible to
have the same atmosphere that
they had back home.”
All of the persons we talked
to in Iowa City expressed gerierat approval of their own ad-
registration’s attitude .toward
artistic freedom. Dr. seeker
said, “I think there is as great
a ireetlom here as l‘ve seen,
anti that is one reason the arts
flooring here. This freedom is
very important.”
Dr. DaVld School, Professor
of TeradiorFilm, consolidated
clips view of the University of
Iowa. “This is the most liberal
school I’ve taught at,” he said.
ln general, he continued, “the
administration has had a clear
attitude toward membership. They
put their confidence in the
Staff.”
Students Satisfied
Students working in the University art studios also indicated membership was no proc
let at Iowa, They after surprised that anyone was even
concerned about me problem.
Most of them did recall, however, incidents in which artistic
displays oi questionable moral
implications were removed from
public showing. in all cases,
however, the displays were taken down only temporarily at
times when a great number of
considers were on campus. One
graduate assistant said no
thought this was “silly”, but he
seemed unconcerned about it.
To give an idea of the limits
of the artistic freedom at Iowa,
John Schulze, Professor of
Art (Photography), told the 88:3,
“We don’t usually permit hu‘
man generally to be shown in
public photographic displays
but there have been exception
to this.” He added, “We do
things now we coupon’t have
done two years ago.”
Both photography and art students use nude female models
and nearly nude male models.
The models are paid up to $2.50
per hour and are drawn from
both undergraduate and graduate students
Confidence Important
In setting the limits Dr. neck.
er again arrested the importance
of the administration’s confidence in its facility.
He said, ”I think If is very
opportunity ii a faculty member acts on beliefs other than
his own — that is from outside
influences. Then you are really
in trouble."
Dr. seeker feels a kind of
"mutual respect between faculty, studentsI and administration”
is necessary for a college or
university to operate well.
Dr. seeker arrested artistic
integrity on the part oi the student in presenting this mutual
respect. He said, “I feel that
any honest work the students
want to do, they are free to
do at Iowa."
In respect to producing works
which go strongly against the
standard moves, Dr. seeker
said, tonight students are obviously more trouble than stupid
students. It is much easier if
you have students who accept
anything — but how dreadful!”
Perhaps, Dr. Schaal suggested,
“the street way to cause trouble is to sensor something." It
is when students get upset with
what they feel is affair membership that newspaper stories begin to appear.

“it was a good experience for
all involved; there Should definitely he many more exchanges
between Grinnell and LeMoyne
— exchanges or great Variety.“
“It was like a taste or professional theater — outside the ia—
miller college context."
These were the reactions of
student director Dennis Rich
and his assistant, trends Thomas, about their recent tour to
LeMoyne College, Memphis,
Tennessee, with the Grinnell
student theater production of
William wesley’s play “Slow
Dance on the Killing Ground."
Dave Duiiy and Bill Raiterty
(technical crew) and early human and Dale Dreyluss (cast)
also went to LeMoyne for the
three—day round of perform—
angel and discussions.
The third cast member, aaron powers, was one of tour
LeMoyne exchange students at
Grinnell last semester. (LeMoyne is a private, nonresiden-
dial, metro college oi about 650
students.)
“Slow Dance” was first
stated by these Students at
Grinuell last spring while angry was in attendance here.
The idea for the LeMoyne production was concerned at that
time,
Funds Denied
Rich first tried to get: final—

the exhibition but he was refused. “We don’t have funds set
aside for such projects,” was
the reason given by Associate
Dean Richard H. centers. In
the past, another theater pro
auction, “The Bourgeoisie" by
raymond Belts, history, asked
for support to go on the road
and was also refused for ”lack
Di funds."
After Rich was times down
by Grinnell, he contacted LeMoyne which decided to sponsor the tour itself.
The “Slow Dance” groups,
accompanied by this 5&3 re-
porter, embedded on its electrical experiment with an illlariuus 14»holly drive. Temporarily breed from academic
pressure, animated hy notification of a unique experience and
reiniorced by a commonly—
shared spirit for the dramatic,
the group outdid itself with theatrics along the way.
After an entire day of jokemaking the cast was sufficient»
ly "warned up” to perform by
the time they arrived in Memphis, Tuesday night, October
25.
‘Slow Dance" was performed
the next day in a classroom in
the Basement or the College
library. Working conditions {or
the technical crew were very
difficult because of the lack of
stage equipment. Unfortunately, LeMoyne has no drama de—
partners although one faculty

of “Slow Dance” and the

the performances.

favors Bishop, a LeMoyne
student who spent a semester
at Grinnell, said in one of the
post — performance discussions
that this particular play was a
good choice for LeMoyne due
to its ”providence to the mod

The play is a product oi
Broadway and a sophisticated
specifically - oriented society.
The cast felt that the general
reaction of LeMoyne students
to the play was related to their
distance from this society. Le.

fine arts facilities, and the College has had little opportunity
to export its students to drama,
including drama of a modern
social nature.
Because of this limited background in the theater the cast
said the LeMoyne audience took
the play very personally and
“hard." They indicated that
“some people walked out mesmerized by it."
One LeMoyne professor had
opportunity to talk to a few at
his students after the performances and all had been enthusiastic, “though they found the
play rough." He indicated that
students reached this way due
to “narrow religious backgrounds,” but he added, This
exposure (to the content the
play) was good for them."

and action in the play are raw,

play.
