part ot President women’s plan
is that it will allow students
more time to do independent research on subjects of interest to
them.

are prepared for this degree of

proposals are very good. but it
will take several years to put

Paul Coilrtright: I agree with
him in general about the emphasis on comprehensive education. By living in a technical
age where the emphasis is or

need for students with a broad
philosophical background to
have an understanding for the
problems of our age and to
solve them. I like the idea otshilting responsibility more on

they are great ideas and i hope
they can be put into effect

The xerox quarter will

THE QUARTET chose the
Beethoven pieces because of
their consistently fine quality
and also because they will be

as much variation within individual concerts as an all Beethoven program would allow, they

Perhaps the reason the

due to their introduction to

made its debut. The faculty

“We have been impressed so

Bill Winter, St. Olaf’s all-Conference football player.
last year on both offense and defense, has written another
chapter in the long- history of smalchollege players making
good in professional football. . i
WINTER CAME to the New York Giants this year on?
a tryrout contract: as their 18th draft choice. Quickly he.
established himself as a formidable defensive player and has;
started ever since in a corner linebacker slot. 1
But even though he was a starter in the fall practice‘
games, Winter had to really struggle in the pre-season proc-i
time to make himself noticed. i
It was during these early fall work cuts that I spoke .
with Winter. At this point Winter was anything but con- i
silent about making the squad, much less the starting 1
team. He had this to say, “Either you have what they i
want, or you don’t—you can’t tell. There was a guy who ‘
was on last year’s taxi; he looked real good to me, but he
was out the first see .” i
Probably the most surprising comment Winter had to‘
make was that he felt that New York’s training program
was easier than he had experienced at St. Olaf. This was
because the Oles coupon’t accomplish in several hours \Vllilt‘
