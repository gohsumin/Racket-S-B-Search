MANAGING colrou
The north campus social chairman and soutll campus
:ocean chairman asked house council and baffleboard members
or a pledge to efforts open room policy last Sunday. Their
reasons were treat they could not take responsibility for an
unenforced open room program this semester and that the
college was in serious danger of losing the program if such
a pledge were not made.
Yesterday, the two chairman met with the social planning
board to decide the fate of open rooms this semester. The
rogram of open rooms was extended to all but the four
cialis—barnes, South counter, liable, and Langan—which
failed to guarantee enforcement.
The action has had some opportunity aspects. First,
there was no claim from the administration that college officials were any more seriously concerned with enforcement
procedures recently than in past computers.
Second, there was no pressure from the administration
for a statement of this nature if open rooms were to be
presented; the possibility that a new dean of men might review
the program next fall and the fact that no opens were scheduled during the interim session (nor have there been any
during past interior) were the only “threats.”
Third, the action was hourly times. House councils were
even only a few days to decide whether to sign the pledge.
ad a similar proposal been raised later in the semester,
after open roolns for this semester had been scheduled and
assured, there would have been time to discuss and which
the alternatives.
Fourth, the purpose of the proposal was not explained
accurately. The result was widespread uncertainty in many
balls. Many house council members simply didn’t want to
lodge themselves to be ubiquitous petroleum. Others felt
hat the pledge implied previous laxity ill enforcement Others
didn‘t feel a pledge by this year’s house councils would
guarantee a confirmation of enforcement next year.
The Board of Trustees, however, has never skilled out
what steps would be requiring to making the present expert»
mental program permanent. Perhaps the reason for the under'
senate present situation is that no one knows the exact mature
qualities we are supposed to be displaying. ls student responsibility to be measured by student ability to strictly efforts present rules? Should we efforts less strictly and see
that rumors of the “irresponsible minority” area’t spread? Or
are there other qualities the administration and the Board
of Trustees would like us to manifest?
Most students want open rooms to continue; at present
no one is sure of what we are supposed to do to ensure their
confirmation. J
W
Students tend to be very short-fighter when they look
[or the answer to Grinnell’s open form policy. Although they
can say a great deal concerning the situation, the attitude
previous that the less done about it the better.
The head social chairman of North and South campus
must be explained for what appears to be outstanding courage
along with an impressive amount of insight. They were not
afraid to admit that their program would most likely fail
to function properly under existing conditions. Neither did
they hide the fact. that responsible action involved positive
student enforcement. chairs was a lonely action of selfrespollsihility. ‘
Students were checked, at first, that they were being
called upon to act. Many had failed to acquaint themselves
with the concept that positions of leadership detailed more
than the acceptance of pUSlt10n#f01‘ in the past year there
have been many accepting positions, and few giving leadership.
The idea of students affecting that they would take that
responsibility of enhancing open forms caused a lot of static
across campus. But, by the end of the week the majority
of students had indicated that they were willing to take the
responsibility for their positions in a new effort to efforts the
open form policy. If such action can be carried out, it will
add to the value of the policy itself and will undoubtedly
solve some of its problems. Perhaps in time it will lead to
an expanded and improved program.
Those who refused to afford a position of enforcement
and gave no reason for this refused were able to lose themselves in booty phrases about the demands of the proposition,
or about self made theories on rules in general. (This does
not include those calls which didn’t sign the o iginal statement out drew up corporations of their own indicating their
desire to continue enforcement.) But those reducing to sign
any document could not hide the simple facts. Their refused
illustrated that these individuals were not willing to direct,
themselves toward the responsible action that their positions
represented.

Letters to the Editor
Abernathy Relates Editorial on Interim Session and 11A
T0 the Editor:
The editorial in the last 8&3
seemed to carry its christ
along two main lines: (1) The
underclassmen (freshmen and
sophomores) feel little incentive or necessity to study our<
ing the interim session, since
there are no individually client—
ed interests; (2) the possible
interests of the seniors are con»
selected by the requirements
of the JLA exam. In both cases
the result is a wanted interim
because of a lack of individual
focus in the session itself. I
would suggest rather that there
may be a lack of individual
focus in the individual himself.
Dr. Kuntz’s letter last week
offers the answer to point l~
“The job of learning to be your
own boss. . . . is difficult,” College is the place to learn both
the good and the bad of wanted
time; we should stress the
promise of the interim.
With respect to point 2, 1
think the editorial has gone
away. The JLA syllabus does
not restrict interests; indeed,
its value lies precisely in its
wide accessibility, its possibility, its openings. In terms of
the purposes of the examination, this year’s syllabus was,
in my opinion, very good.

Miscellany and regression
This past week the North and
South Campus Social chairman have proposed a new approach to rule enforcement
which could set a president
for not only the Grinnell can-l,»
put but perhaps for all societies which experience problems
in rule enforcement. The social
chairman have run up against
the impossbility of the confirmation of the operators program in the light of the failure
of students to live by and efforts the rules under which the
program was set up.
As a last dutch effort to save
the operators program, they
have distributed a pledge to be
signed by the members of the
house councils and baffleboards
of each hall. By signing the
pledge these students would
agree to accept their responsibility for enhancing the opendorm rules as listed in the std»
sent handbook.
Thus all problems concerning
enforcement would be solved
by the signing of a pledge
which would commit 'the
signals to Carry out the jobs
which they have previously
been selected to fulfill. Tile possibilities for this type or ap
breach are almost unlimited.
I would suggest that, as a
three schemes of order could
be answered in two or three
days' reading; the lectures hiv»
on were adequate to cement the
ideas and to suggest the possibilities interest in the ideas.
The bulk of the preparation
task detailed Creative and
imagination understanding of
previously learned knowledge
as related to new categories of
historical importance. The task
not only permitted but also de
handed some individually initiated focus. A student with
ideas about his major academic
interests and their relation to
the currency in intellectual history should have been well pre
based. The interim session provided the opportunity and the
incentive for an imagination
ordering of personal interests.
it is important that there
were no correct answers to the
exam; students with a sense of
intellectual continuity should
have completed the test easily.
if the junior student desired to
he literally educated, then the
interim and exam were opportunities:
It seems that academic desire is present in students with
a sense of their own individual
focus. The focus and corner-
the pending desire must come from

distributed to these same per
pre which would pledge them to
upload their obligations to efforts the regulations of the
open-form program.
If this plan proceeds in saving the open form program it
might also be used whenever
students feel enforcement of
other rules might be desirable.
bridges might be distributed
which deal with fireworks,
liquid, or quiet hours which
would pledge the house count
oils and baffleboards to efforts
these or any other rules which
appear in the handbook.
A more radical step would be
to have all students sign

break specific rules listed in
the handbook. This Would mean
that agencies for student enforcement could be done away

lack of student enforcement
would not be a radical change
at all.

could have in solving problems

The further issue (explicit in
the editorial) is how can the
student acquire individual focus
and a desire for a liberal education? I have no answer. I

then the interim is valuable.
It is invalid to undercut the
worth of the interim by porno

solution to a lack of this kind of

than changing or scripting the

Students Suggest
Leaders, Citizens
Respond By Doing
To the Editor:
The AWS Board and the
CofHP were this week asked to
Sign a pledge stating that they
would, from now on, efforts
the open forms policy. when
this statement was passed out,
it was asked how it could be permitted so it would “ring better" with the administration. It
was also made clear that the
signature of the president on
this document does not in any "
way navigate him to consider
enforcement of any other rules.
Maybe the time to stuff ‘ln‘
boxes is over and the time to
act is average. The concepts
of citizen and leaders have
gone from our community and
need to be revised.
The informed policy of the
Grinnell community is L0 let
anything occur so long as it
does not visible and directly injury another persons. The concepts of Grinnell College, acer
comic community, and society
do not enter our minds any
more. Let us try to be citizens
in the largest sense, ie. preserve and protect the ideals.
which include the rules, of the
community.
“As a starter it is suggested
that all known vibrators be reported and dealt with in the
institutionalized manner. further, it is suggested that the
members of the community
carry out their responsibility '

Helping
‘k
Students Discover Future
*
Is Objective of Placement Ofﬁce
By Karen robinson
“We’re in the business of selling opportunities." said Zeke
Bequeira, director of Grinnell’s
Placement Office.
The Placement Office is designed to aid students in making vocational plans. It was set
up as a separate office just
over a year ago with Sequeira
as director.
One of Sequeira’s innovations
has been the Placement Office
bulletin distributed every week.
It contains summer employment information, dates of tests
and visits of industrial recruiting, and graduate fellowship
news.
He said, “We had no idea
this would flooring as it has.
We published a special bulletin
about the Peace Corps senior
program which was distributed
only to seniors and within an
hour after its distribution we
had other students calling and
coming in to ask for copies of
their own."
The Placement Office, according to Sequeira, acts as a
connector, advisor, and “brown
en" It brings together recruiting and job seekers, but more
than that it “seeks to find
means by which students can
translate their educational experiences into productive and
exciting locations,”
”Most students seem to ignore vocational planning during their understand years, and
by their senior year it is sometimes too late. How many students, for example, choose a
major with a thoroughly investigated location in mind, or
perhaps more important, how
often do they select their work
in supporting disciplines with
a direction in View? Often the
related course work can do
much to enhance a person’s lap
for value,” said Sequeira.
He continued, “This is like
buying the most beautiful Cadillac you can find and then letting it sit because you won’t
spend anything on gasoline,
service, and licensing. Students
and their families often sacrifice a great deal for a BA, but
area’t willing to invest a little
time and energy in investigation what they want of the world
and what the World wants of
them."
information is available in
quantity at the Placement office. Industry actively reprints
college graduates and puts vocational information at the disposal of colleges. The federal
 
scene Theatre Renewal is Complete
The modern atmosphere of
the recently recovered arena
theatre located on the ground
floor-of ARH' will provide the
background for many future
lectures and seminars, according to Evan H. garden, director of the physical plant.
The new lecture room,
opened to classes on Feb. 10.
had served as a theatre arena
workshop before the continue
tion of the Fine Arts Center.
Because of the need for more
classrooms, it was decided to
put the workshop area to better
ala.
The remodeling. in the plan-
king stage for two and a half
years, actually began just before Christmas vacation of last
semester. Although the project
is technically finished, drives
and permanent chairs will be
added along with a large table
for seminar discussions.
For the present the seminar
and lecture room has been
fully scheduled for classes
varying from humanities to
speech correction. Next year,
however, the use of the “old
arena” will be limited to groups
more appropriate to that type
of classroom, such as large
English and history seminars.
 
 
government, through not only
the individual personnel departments but also the Department of Labor and Civil Service Commission, is another
source. Individual research organizations also offer a good
deal of data as do professional
and vocational associations like
the American Medical Association.

Relation Movements In further
By Cynthia trust
formation problems, “the relations or order to value," were
discussed Tuesday evening by
Dr. Monroe Beardsley, His
speech, “Order and Disorder
in Art," was the elements of the
"Order Seminar” Series
Dr. Beardsley arrested that
order itself is not necessarily
a valuerconcept, but “. . . in
some fields, order is taken to
be a ground of cordless;
Something desirable for itself,
. . ." He cited such ancient
thinking as plate, platinum, and
St. christine as early percent—
era of this connection in the
field of aesthetics. .
Their connection was based
on two essential principles;
“what makes a work of art
good is its beauty,” and “what
distinguished beautiful things.
. . . is a high degree of some
kind of order.” This forms a
tradition which “. s the oldest synthetic tr tion in the
West." This synthetic theory included organization, unity, and
proportion in its definition of
order.
The major part of Dr.
Beardsley's lecture was spent
evaluating two modern movements which he feels “. . . have
raised this old problem again
in an. especially challenging
way. . . .” These movements
are “. . . the increasing use of
chance, or accident, in the creation of art,” and the information Theory of athletics.
“realistic art” is the term
of Dr. Beardsley uses to describe “art produced by accident. . .” Although new methods of “computing” were included, the discussion was limited mainly to the field of
“paint'ng,” as this is the area
where realistic art is most
common and. most easily
assessed. According to Dr.
Beardsley, “The counting of
accident has been present to
some degree in all abstract
art.” He sees the current interest in “junk art" to be a natural outgrowth of this fashion—
tion, for “nothing is left to the
salaries of fate more elderly
 
than what man costs away. . ."

Moving to contemporary music, Dr. Beardsley described
and analyzed the Information
Theory. This he called “The
most significant attempt to
provide a precise description of
order in art. . .” This theory is
a mathematical one, based on
a series of signals and the “information” they give, which
depends upon the unpredictability of each signal. A random
arrangement would give more
information than one following
a pattern, which would be “defendant” or predictions

There appears to be a “. . .

or order. . . The best memories
lie somewhere . . . between
complete ’randomness and a
very tight control.”
When we judge a work of art
to be good," Beardsley cotton<
red, “it is relevant to support
this judgment by pointing out
that the work is highly unified.
Again, , . .
He concluded with the observatiOn that “. . . Intensity of

Mrs. Fernandez, refused from Cuba's Communist Regime
Arrives at Grinnell to Work as Cook for Food Service
By Susan Taylor
A charming young mother
has found her way from Cas<
two’s Cuba to Grinnell’s Saga
Food Service since September,
1962. She is Mrsl Marie german-
dec, who, with her husband and-
child, left a good home and a
law practice in Cuba to escape
the Communist government of
the island.
Mrs. Fernandez is a cook for
Saga at the Quadrangle kitchen. She said that they are very
happy to be in the United States
and in Grinnell, even though it
means that she must work now.
She expressed her institute for
the opportunity to be in the
United States and to raise her
children here
Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez
spent their first year in the
United States in‘ Miami where
their second child was born six
months ago “We miss very
much Cuba," Mrs. Fernandez
said, using the word order of
her native Spanish, "but we
have our children here, and we
are grateful to the government
and the people of the United
States to be here,”
Mrs. Fernandez explained
that the family had made plans
to settle in Indiana, but they
decided to come to Grinnell because of the trying of Mr. Fernandez’s life-long friend, Vincent Range], who teaches Spanish at Grinnell High School.
Fernandez and daniel grew
up together and both became
attorneys in paraguay, Cuba.
The rangers were brought to
Grinnell through the efforts of
the school system and the Jay-

Certainly it is about time that
a returned and intelligent sun-
“»section to the solving of our
enforcement problems such as
the planning program be proposed It has been obvious for
 
states (wives of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce members). The rangers were so
pleased with the community
that they tried the Fernandez
family to come here.
Mrs. Fernandez visible details the day the family came
to Grinnell. It was the day of
President Kennedy’s investigation, November 22, 1963, The
young refused reports having
learned of the national tragedy
in Chicago, en route to Iowa.
Mrs. Fernandez explained
the one and one-half year per
less she and her husband went
through in preparation for immigration to the United States.
They left shortly before the
October crisis in 1962, when
there were still two flights a
day from banana to Miami.
They were allowed to bring
only one set of clothing along
with the clothes they were
wearing All of their property
had to be turned over to Castro’s government before they
left the country, ‘
Upon their arrival in the
United States, the family’s first
concern was to find milk for
their year-old son. The human
officials had complicated a
start of milk which she had
taken to the airport for her
child.
Mrs. Fernandez left her parents and her sister and family
behind in Cuba. They had originally planned to come to the
United States, but the means
of transportation was cut off
before they were able to leave.
Cuba was once a country of
middle class people, according
to Mrs. Fernandez, and the
quite some time that a group
of college students with above
average intelligence such as we
have at Grinnell cannon be expected to take seriously the
rules printed in the student
handbook of rules. It is an result to the intelligence, and
more importantly, the individuality of the Grinnell student to
expect him to aside by and
efforts these rules.

But the older people do not

The girls, Grinnell’s opponents tonight, are in the lower
third of the Midwest Conference standings, but are begin»
italy on the listing, as shown
by their 9542 trouncirlg of C08
College Kohawks last Weekend.
In their trip to Northfield,
the Pioneers beat the girls,
96-82, in a game which Coach
deutsch turned as “the bést
game we have played this
year." At that time, however, Grinnell was led by the
performance of Gordon line
read, who has since left
school.
The Carleton team is led by
an all—conference guard Jack
trade, whose lack of height,
5.9, is offset by his thickness
and excellent shooting eye, and
Center Mike journey, a junior
who was 6th man on last year’s
squad, Few fans who were at
last year’s game between these
teams at Grinnell will forget it.
With third place in the Conference at stake, the girls edges
out the Pioneers in a doubleovertime thriller.

of the season was expected to
be the reader of the Northfield
teams, was quite a there in the

LBurma and Wall Discuss Rights Bill
The main features and the
political problems of the Civil
Rights package' bill which was
passed by the House of Representatives Monday were out
lined and discussed in a coffee
hour Tuesday afternoon in
counter L o u n g e. Featured
speakers about the bill were
Dr. John l-L karma (Sociology)
and Dr. Joseph F. wall (History).
karma started the discussion
with a virtual report on the bill
as passed by the House, He
listed the major areas covered
by the bill and their promotional
l) DESEGREGATION OF
SCHOOLS: The bill proposed a
fact finding committee to determine the actual situation,
the possibility of the federal
government ﬁline suit in cases
where individuals are not potentially able to do so, and federal
funds being granted to into<
stated schools from which
state governments have withdrawn funds on the basis of
their integration.
2) VOTING RIGHTS: The bill
proposed a bar on discrimination in registration and voting
in federal elections, specifically
in the tests given as a prerequisite for registration and lit-
913 Broad
 
tracy tests; it also makes a
provision for three judges in
cases brought to the courts
This would prevent local prejudices of one judge and tend to
move the case faster. ‘
3) PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS: The bill would prohibit
discrimination in those accommodations tied to interstate
transportation—hotels, motels,
restaurants, and probably filling stations, theaters, and retail stores,
4) PUBLIC FACILITIES:
(facilities maintained by a government unit) The bill would
permit the attorney general to
interface and take the financial
burden in court action,
5) FEDERAL AGENCIES:
The bill. would permit the use
of agency funds, with presidential approval, for attempts
to end discrimination.
6) EMPLOYMENT: The bill
would in essence establish a
federal fair employment practices commission. lt,would also
outlet employment instrumentation because of “race, religion,
national origin, or sex," thus establishing a legislative base for
equal opportunities for women.
karma further explained that
the bill would establish a community relations agency, a fact
 
finding and technical assistance service. It would also extend the Civil Rights Commission for another four years.
Dr. Wall, in discussing the
problems the bill faces in the
Senate, said, “I'm not nearly
so pessimistic about the bill's
chances as I was a few weeks
ago. Even so, it’s going to be
very tough, and I don’t want to
paint an overly optimistic picture."
“There are two factors working for us in forming a favorites Senate vote," Wall said:
1) “The erotic and arabic
death of President Kennedy has
undoubtedly contributed to the
success of the measure" by
changing the political alignment of some Republicans with
the liberal Democrats.
2! The conversations made a
critical error in incoming closure in the liberal milfhunter last
year on the American Telephone and paragraph Company
satellite bill. Wall explained
that pressure to vote [or closure can be brought on those
conservative senators who
voted for it at that time,
He said that there is “no
question at all that President
Johnson will be happy to sign

they organized professionally and toured the continent, singing at
churches, concert calls, colleges, and music festivals.
Two years ago the charles fingers were selected ”New Star"
vocal group in Down Beat magazine‘s International Jazz Critics
Poll, the first time a Gospel group has received this award.
The group has not tried to disease the old spiritual and hymn
singing styles in an attempt to give their singing a more modern
sound, as have a number of others in Gospel music. Instead, the
charles have chosen to ignore present trends, relying on the permanent appeal of traditional metro folk music — songs of life,
hardship and happiness, songs of the common man and his faith
in himself, his people and his God.
