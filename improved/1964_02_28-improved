Concerning Senate ‘Change . . .
One of the basic policies endorsed by the newly-elected
SGA president is.that of structural change within the Senate.
The idea of election part of the Senate body from student
elections at large is directed at getting more interested and
competent people in Senate seats.
There has been increased dissatisfaction among student
leaders this year concerning the apache of many senators.
The present speaker has laid most of the blame at the door
of south campus. In the 5&3 last fall he stated that the women
senators were uninformed, practice, and too securely restricted by their calls. ‘
If the focus of senate problems is on south campus, we
would suggest that reform he done iii this area rather than
on a campus wide basis. The problem should be attacked directly rather than by an indirect route which would only
a-create more problems.
visiting the senate into two sections consisting of hall
representation, as it is now, and of a group elected at large
would only tend to decentralize the method and purpose
of the senate action. Likewise, election senators at large on
a campus wide basis would create a group of audio ' treatments
of SGA if campaign methods remain as they have in the past.
Tile magic concern is with the women senators. This is
the problem that should be solved.
The lnaiii wellness in the south campus senate system
is the conditions under which the senators are chosen. House
council elections are held at the beginning of each‘year.
The women change their references every year, so that the
-indiVidual communities election their representative have
a constant population flux. At the beginning of the year,
many of the people don’t know each other’s names, let alone
their interests and abilities Senate elections often result in
popularity contests or simple elimination events. A girl really
Interested in senate work might be detected because she has
no backing, while a less competent member is elected because
the group is generally aware that she has served as senator
before.
' We would propose that women senators should be
elected in the spring, when galleries are aware of their interests and abilities. While campaigns and voting should be
limited to individual calls, the representation would be shipped around after room drawings. In a sense, the south campus
senate representation would be elected at home, but would be
lervmg at large.
Freshmen senators remain a problem because they must
represent their calls, but the circumstances surrounding their
election are completely inadequate. If the forms are integrated, however, there would be no longer a need for fresh-
en women to serve as senators, for each hall would still
have the chance for representation.
It would seem that representing each individual hall on
south campus is not nearly as important, under the shipping
living conditions, as adequate and competent representation
of the women students as a whole. Therefore, we see an im-
message need for revision the manner in which women send-
toys are chosen.

Letters to the Editor
Students Want To Know What The Grinnell Image Is
To the Editor:
Question: Is the Grinnell
education considered exceptional by graduate and other
undergraduate institutions?
This ”question was assembled
in a discussion we had with an
interested and informed faculty»administration member, to
whom we are grateful for his
fingering and help. We feel,
however, that some questions
remain that must be answered
if Grinnell College is to be honest with itself and with the portions of its student members.
These questions relate to the
student’s image of Grinnell as
perpetuated by the administration and perpetuated by himself.
”As a private college of
high standing Grinnell. . .3’
“As a high-quality college
it (Grinnell) has distinction
characteristics which are
especially conducted to the
education of listed young
people.” .
“Selection makes possible
high academic standards and
keen academic competition,"
(From College Bulletin l9631964)
This is the college we think
we are attending. Is this the
college the graduate schools
think we are attending?
 
How high is Grinnell ranked
and by whom?
What is the significance and
effect of this rank?
Are the demands of Grinnell
more rigorous than, for exam»
pre,’those of joe, Riporl, Cornell, Beloit, I. S. ll, S. U. 1.?
Would Grinnell students get
better grades at other schools?
How do Grinnell graduates
fare in competition for graduate admission with students
from the above schools: Does
a 2.8 from Grinnell allow you
actively to compete with 3 M]
from “lower ranked" schools?
Are the grades given at Grinnell commensurate with an educational program "designed
especially for students of sur
period ability and talent?"
How do Grinnell graduates
perform in graduate school
compared with graduates from
other schools?
How does Grinnell measure
these various ratings, quantitatively?
Finally, how can Grinnell students, faculty, and administrar
tion work together to raise the
rank and reputation of their college?
We would suggest that a
place to begin would be with
quantitative answers to the
above questions. We believe

‘l'llicit' Press Item
To the Editor:
The recent historical oulpourings of that integrated
federation, sublime, reminder
me somewhat of a sample of
deficit press sent lo me by a
friend at Colorado College. I
am submitting it to the see,
not so much to show surplus

Dear Al,
Since you have required as to
how 1 am achieving CC’s final solution to the student problem.
First, the student body must be
suspected to a lot of silly regulations. At cc, of course, we have
realized the difference between
boys and girls, and have therefore
established different regulations
for each. Once each week we make
every male student, in his brown
shirt and green BVD’s, start
around with a topless stick which
he is laid is the ultimate weapon
in modern \village. We do better
with the girls; we give them 24
hour protection. By day we check
their dress, and by night we check
their address.
This unthinking submission
makes it easier lo apply control on
more important matters. We look
the girls up as much as possible.
After 211, boys will be boys, and if
we don't do something about ii,
girls will be mothers. We can
every this control only because no
force all the girls in live on campus.
Over the years i have found that
student reaction is best overcome
by giving the students topless
tasks which they feel are impor.
want. Among those front ol'situations, a pepper student government
is a must. “Student leaders” must
be elected democratically as role
ing is the American Way. or
course, students must be encouraged to establish committees on
administrative matters. Never fear,
this policy is foolproof, for if these
committee ever do anything, you
can easily dissolve them.
it is good to candidate the solid,
conventional members of the campus community to serve as your
stories. Just provide them with
plenty of status — that’s all it
takes. They believe in “freedom
with responsibility” (use that
phrase, it’s catchy!) and as they
have no responsibility, they ask
for no freedom. The students will
want publications. Unfortunately,
freedom of the press is the Amer'
can Way. However. subtle pressure on the editors can achieve
your ends. At all costs, never can501' any publication. it one offers:

Faculty Invited To

Members of the Grinnell faculty and administration will air
their views of Grinnell life and
will attempt to clarity the 001legs’s ideas of the ends and
means of a liberal arts educa»
tion in the Faculty Chapel series which began today.
The program, which this
week featured Joseph D. Danforth (chem.) and William A.
speaker (German), is held in
service Chapel Friday moments at II.
“We hope the students will
not feel that we are running
the topic into the ground," said
Ann Klein, chairman of the
Church and Chapel Committee,
which is planning the series.
She continued, saying that,
though students and “faculty
have both discussed the topic
in one guide or another, her
committee felt that short talks
by Faculty and administration
could give a whole new plant
and open a new area of investigation.
The goal of the series is to
deeper, strengthen, and advance the current discussion of
student behavior and studentfaculty relations by means of
a series of talks about the ultimate goals of liberal arts education,

of flux. Only' the hall Council
and the elected hall leader, the
hall president, know the atmosphere of their respective
hall; these are best able to
judge situations and make
choices. They must, however,
bear in mind the limitations and
intimate of north campus life.
Flexibility holds primary importance because of the dual
purpose of the CofHP—that our<
pose being problem solving and
representation.
 
The purpose is best achieved
 
through a re-establishment of
support among students, student leaders, administration
and faculty. Through individual
and joint action with the std—
cents and other divisions of
student government, the soil-[P
Should strike to install mutual
trust with the administration
and our follows. The dual our<
posts of CofHP are superintendent, and support must be
established to trade any destinations.
Grinnell College is unique in
several instances which are, at
this time, best controlled in a
realistic manner, First, the students are isolated both phase<
rally and in their ideals. Sec
and, the distinct men’s residence hall system is such that
each hell is autonomous and
actually responsible to the
Whole. Third, the advert of a
new, unknown Dean of Men
provides an opportunity to re
establish satisfactory relation—
ships. The CofHP Ought to be
organized to meet the unique
news of the total situation.

Read sites Need for CotltP Progress in Two Areas;
Student-Faculty Discussions and Enforcement of Rules
I feel that progress within the
CofHP must occur in two
areas: student-faculty discussion and rule enforcement, The
events and art‘
t‘uses of this
past year have
discussed o u r
w e a k n e uses.
The gift between students
And faculty in,
regard to the
discussion and
establishment of
social and academic policies

practical. The alternate of the
Boar‘s Head Dinner revealed
that many faculty members
are interested in our problems
and can offer permanent suggestions. Mainly they are willing to sit down and talk with
us. Meeting in small informal
groups, students and faculty
can consider a wide range of
subjects, perhaps entirely generated to immediate college
problems. Though with no par-
Republicans Name
Convention Heads
Young Republican President
Bob Savage has announced the
names of those students who
are chairman of the candidate
campaigns for the rock political convention to be held in
April.
They are Robin universe,
polyester: P e t e r coleman,
powerseller; carb B e n d a,
Lodge; Laurie Houdek, Scranton; John TePaske, simon; Ken
‘sherman, Romney; Larry Huttgren, Margaret Chase Smith.
Savage also announced the
appointment of Jim Stoddart as
head of publicity and general
effects for the convention.
similar action in mind, these
discussions can result in proposals for the improvement of
our academic and social life.
I propose the i 'union of std-
’ sent-faculty discussions on a
fairly regular but highly flexible schedule. Each individual
hall would decide the time,
topic, and participating faculty
of these discussions. Evaluation
and synthesis of these discussions would‘occur within the
CofHP.
This year we have witnesses
a decline in the respect for
rules, Too easily many of us,
if we have disturbed with a
rule, have isolated it. Those
charged with responsibility
have too frequently looked the
other way, Grinnell is a society
Whose rules reflect the concerns not only of students but
also the College President,
T r u Ste e 5. Administration,
Alumni, Faculty and our parents. If a majority of students
disagree with a regulation or
heritage to efforts it, then they
must work with these other in»
threats to effect a new policy.
Yet the very essence of law and
student government depends upon the enforcement of existed
rulesi '
I believe that the majority
of students now realize the need
for rule enforcement but at the
same time racknowledge the
presence of certain policies
which exhibit proper enforcement. I propose that individual
calls be allowed to impose penalties for many violations now
under the jurisdiction of the
Men's Primary Court. This pro
centre can facilitate the enforcement of certain rules, in
particular open rooms and ill
legal limitations, and has proven effective in some calls this
year. Until this method is legal~
 
ized, I expect that each hall
would efforts present rules,
 
thus ensuring a sound basis for
future liberalizetions.
If it is to be a year of change,
let us have it prepared with responsibility and discussion,
Some changes are certain and
I hope an largest evaluation of
our attitudes toward rules, toward the larger goals of Grinnell life, and toward the improvement of our community
will be among them. To these
ends I pledge my stainless effort.

McKlveen for Rules Changes
To Suit the Students' lclecils
Responsibility is not defined
solely as upgrading the laws of
a system, although this is certainly necessary for maintain-
ing the stability of a system,
and for achiev»'
ing the goals for which the
system is established lesson»
mobility ,
may be defined
as recognition
the necessity
for c h a n g e 5
Within the exist-
ing s ys t e m. McKLVEEN
reflect of this second aspect
of responsibility is just as serious as reflect of the first.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While at Grinnell it is expected that we take every advantage of the academic opportunities; it is also desirable for the
individual to recognize and accept his social responsible' ’es,
usually the social responses i»
ties of the student, like that of
the citizen, are to act in a manner which will promote Community harmony and cause no
discomfort or harm to others.
At Grinnell the ideal system of
rules could be limited to those
which prevent delivering harm to
others. One rule would he suffi»
event to ensure that ideal, a rule
containing to disorderly conduct,
including a quiet hour provision.
The purpose of the legislative body
at Grinnell is to translate only
those rules which the student body
wants, Again usually, the system of
rules should accommodate the
beliefs which the student body
holds; moreover, the student body
should not be forced to sphere
to laws in which it dress‘t believe.
it is to be realized that there will
be a time law between the evolue
tion of student social practices and
the passage of laws consistent with
these practices.

is to determine ﬂie ideals of the
men of North Campus. He
should attempt to influence the
administration and the Senate
to associate a system of laws
consistent with the ideals which
the student body holds. I believe that we need only two immediate rule changelog extension of car privileges, and
opendorms on Friday nights
and Sunday afterwards placed
on a permanent basis. If the
opportunity presents itself, I
will support evolution of the
rule programming cold drinking
in openrdorms.
It is also the duty of the President of the C of HP to Communicate directly with the
Trustees of ﬁne College and the
Board of Overseers. If elected,
i would feel it my duty to remain on campus after announcement to provide the Oh
rivers of the College with a seller understanding of student
opinion and social practices.>I
would also encourage the House
treatments to stay for the same
purpose.
Under the existing hall systems, we find that different calls
have different identifies. These
differences of hall personality
make uniform rule enforcement
difficult. This inconsistency is
charitable within the hall system, although it should not be
encouraged. Different social
practices exist in the calls and
different values are held by the
house president and the house
Council. The President of the
C of HP can not force house
treatments to adopt identical
enforcement policies, but he
can encourage them to be sensitive to the social ideals of his
particular hall. Until a consensus exists, this is the most reasonable and accepted policy to
follow in the enforcement of
rules. Once the student body
holds a common idea about a.
law, as the liquid law in the
past, it is not a difficult procedure to get the law passed by
the Senate and accepted by the
administration.
The court system may be made
more effective by revision the penalties, making them more realistic.
The courts would then become the
practical mechanism of legal consistency, rather than a theoretical
one as they now seem to be. An
example 3f an unrealistic penalty
is the posts city of extension for
two late violations of open forms
By enhancing the effectiveness of
the court system, treasures on the
house council will be diminished.
The courts, were created to judge
vibrators, and they should judge.
Ultimately, we must secure
laws consistent with the ideals
and practices of the Student
body.

MncGregor lands Congressional Output;
Strout weight procedures Inadequncies
By Glen Ashmon
Robert Strout, Washington
corresponding for the Christian
Science monitor, delivered
the first formal
lecture in the
Student Symposium session
dealing with
The Legislative
last Thursday
evening in service Chapel. His
t a l k, “What's
W r0 n g with
Congress," smoke
dealt primarily with the procedures inadequacies of the National Legislature.
Strout pointed out that “safety (checks and balanced) was
built into the Congress, not efficiency." He singles out the
authority rule for choosing congressional committee chairman
and the Senate milfhunter rule
for critical examination.
“America is the only state
that recognized longevity rather
than ability in choosing its
legislative leaders. The average age of committee chairman
is 76 years. Besides this, committee chairman are often opposed to the legislation they are
to consider; as a result, a
single man can prevent a major
presidential bill from ever be»
ing considered.”
According to Strout, the Senate milfhunter rule ranks high
among congressional inefficiencies. Because of this rule
there is a danger that the government cannon modern. Strout
said that‘southerners and senators from small states read the
most advantage from the rule.
Consequently, it is usually im»
possible to obtain a two—things
majority to envoke closure.
Strout further customized Congress on the following points:
1. Congress has opposed exec<
erotic voting which would considerable speedup legislative
procedure in the two chat»
bars.
2. Congress has failed to act
on redistricting, though repeatedly asked to do so. This burden, therefore, has fallen on the
courts. _
3. Congress has allowed many
of its powers to be proved by
courts and the White House because of reaction.
4. Congress has allowed new
representatives too little time
p to adjust. Consequently, the
term of office for a compression should be extended to four
years.
5. Congress has never come
up with an adequate system of
budget control.
Strout suggested the need to
reasonable and centralize the
powers of various compression—
al committees. He further allocated the adoption of a pro—
centre that will at least assure
voting on top" priority press»

“What’s right with congress
car outweighs What’s wrong
with Congress," .
C o n g russian
Clark MacGreg<
or (R - Minn.)
said in a speech
Friday morning
in H e r r'i c k g,
Speaking on the topic
“What’s Wrong
With Congress,"
he wa s the .
of s p e a k era Mueenrson
brought to the campus by the
Student Symposium, “The
Democratic Process in an Era
of Crisis.”
He assisted that the truth
about Congress lies somewhere
between the expressed belief of
President Johnson in the ability
of Congress, and the statement
of Representative Richard rolling (D—Mo.) that Congress is
not visible under its present
structure. This truth, MacGregor said, “can best be found
through an analysis of party responsibility.”
He listed some things that he
said were right about the first
session oi the 88th Congress:
the passage of the “tricks and
portal provision" for higher
education and other education
measures, which were followed
by appropriations to carry
them out; "the willingness of
Congress to remain in session
111/; months”; the hard work
the Congress djdveven though
it might not have been evident
since much of it was done in
committee.
As an example of the last
point, he travel the develop
ment of the Civil Rights bill in
the House—especially in the
musicians committee, of which
he is a member. “In the field
of civil rights,’ this Congress
can hold its head high so far,”
he said. '
MacGregor cited the work
done by individual members of
Congress in circulation proposals to improve the legislative body. This kind of thinking, he said, was also right
about Congress, l-l listed some
proposals or indi dual member's of the House:
1. that the Rules Committee
be limited to 21 days in consideration of a bill coming to it
from a legislative Committee.
2. that a joint committee on
the budget be established.
it that a committee to recommend specific reorganizational structural changes be
established.
4. the publication of public
funds extended by members
of Congress.
5. some members have taken
the lead in discussing their own
personal holdings so that any
conﬂict of interests can be
seen.
Criticism. he said. must be
informed and responsible, and
it must consider the responsibilities of the parties. “No
legislative body in a free government anywhere in th e
world," he said, allows the average citizen to have his presence felt as does the Congress
of the United States."

Grinnell’s Pioneers return

break out of the sleep that has
cost the Scarlets six of their
last seven games. Tonight at
7:30 p.m. the camera meet the
Lawrence ratings in party
symposium and tomorrow air
version at 1:30 p.m. face
league-leading simon.
Coach John deutsch's main
problem is still the question
of finding someone to back
up his 1-2 punch of Jim Mifflin and Jeff grants. Since the
departure of sophomore
guard words Kinkead at computers, deutsch has been unable to find a third Pioneer
who can consistently hit in
double figures.
Last week Mifflin scored 51_
points to boost his average to
21.2, among the leaders in the
Midwest Conference. grants
responded from an overnight at
Beloit to pour in 27 points
against joe and keep his over.
age right around the 17 point
mark. But aparrirom these two.
no other Pioneers can be found5
among the top is showers.
However, John russell, chiefr
ly known for his responding,
had one of his best offensive
nights of the year in the 91.90‘
loss to the Kohawks with 19
points. mounting out the linear
tonight will probably be slide
Smith and Dave Sellergren, although Randy Morgan, Dick Ul»
rich and Ted sister are all
stated for action.
Tonight's opponent, Law.
hence, is currently in sixth
place in the conference, one
slot'behind Grinnell. The ratings played only one game last
Week and looked good although
shopping a rather one-sides
game to neighboring simon.
The big gun for the Blue and

headed for a second consecutive basketball crown. Currently sporting a 13-1 record,

determination science and philosophy ensure.
Hume, want, Spinoza and
Leibniz were all determinists;
it was not until the nineteenth
century that some less reported philosophers began to
credit the idea of chance.
Peirce, an American, developed
the theory of Tychism named

“Whose reality Peirce not only
informed, but with penetration
reason accepted as a universal
aspect of all nature.”
In working with Darwin’s
theory of natural selection,
Mendcl’s laws of inheritance.
Gibbs' phase law in chemistry,
and the laws of quantum mechanics, ”a unable determining seems out of the question.”
Hartshorne believes we are
entering a new intellectual
phase in which ”terms like
chance, randomness, probability, possibility are no longer to
be discussed a ‘word of our insurance.’ ”
Hume and want tried to make
“religious sense out of the
victorian world machine."
“The resulting religious determining led to a dual‘concept of
freedom. God's decisions are
free in that there are no conditions determining them. We,
however, are free to make decisions in a totally different
sense, for our acts are precise—

determine them to be.

“The reasonable view of education is . . . that caused conditions limit the then-and-there
possible outcomes, but do not
in advance completely define or
determine a unique outcome."
This self-determination of outcome is 'freedom in the metaphysical or universal sensor"
He pointed out that “though
the particular event is by
chance, the‘laws or regularities

these we need to know in advance, not the' precise events
