As Low TurnoulL Shows Apathy
by Jon klein
On October 6 after considerable discussion and modifie
nation the proposals for increasing student involvement
in the College’s decision-mar
king process were submitted
to the student body. The proposals were largely the work
of three ad how committees
and concerned the areas of
social policies and regulations and counseling. Theproe
totals were reviewed and refined by committee A (the
executive cabinet of S.G.A.,
the means, and the Chairman
of the Faculty), and are likely
to be approved by the prefix
sent in the near future.
IN SHARP CONTRAST TO

Several groups on campus

sent Coordinator, who has
been in charge of most of the
preparation for Community
Day, said that about 70 Slud‘
ends have volunteered to work
so far, and the response from
toWn organizations has been
good. Townspeople and town
organizations and businesses
will contribute tools, equipment, and paint, and townspeople and students will work
together cleaning up roadways, clearing vacant lots,
and painting houses of select
ted citizens who are unable
to do it themselves.
Community Day is thought of
by its planners as an activity
that will be made india yearly

is good. William Deminoff,

said he believes it is valuable
as a natural way for people

to a ”free enterprise educational system." He appears to
see such a freesenterprise,
"enterpreneurial" systemas
a natural development in the
absence off core curriculum.
What he proposed in template
off strict core curriculum,is
a modified form of additional
requirement. All of the position papers noted above favor
a additional requirement of
one sort or another, thoughall
but ericsson’s put in a word
for one or another sort of re
’quoted freshman humanities
course.
Kurz’s paper emphasizes the
values and costs of freedom
and innovation. The educational value of student freedom of
choice is largely that once
students are allowed to vote
with their feet, courses are
alleged to be innovative and
attractive if they are to be
attended. At its extreme this
innovativeness becomes fadd
illness, and the concept off
liberal education (and with it,
unfashionable courses and departments) is lost in the share
fee. Therefore, the paper allocated freedom “within the
solution of recordings”. What
this comes to is a subscribe
time additional‘ requirement
modelling 40 hours. Except for
a 4 hour Humanities course,
there are no specific course
requirements.
Mr. cleaner’s paper allows
itself to be a “reserved endorsement" of Kurz’s power
tion. He does so, but adds to
this press for general education (“reliability of skills”),
asking: "Is anybody who knows
less than everything green”.
He nOtes, and quite highway,
that the no-requirements proposal requires improved ads
rising, and that the case for
that proposal rest "heavily"
on the assumption the admin*
ing system is presently inadequate. He then please that
"For those of usesmost of
us '— who have watched the
. marking offer lines subscribe
blvd full ofmiscellaneous cold
legs chorus by the end of two
or three years here, SXhOrEa’
tions cause alternate daughter
and tears.”
But the question of advisory
remains central to the whole
argument. In Mr. Clotfelter's
original proposal, a distinction is made between freshmanesophomore and major
advisory. It is with the former
that he finds most fault, pro—
family because "the elaborr
ate system of requirements
seems to both the advisor and
the advised to believe them of
the necessity of talking about
anything important". He then
proposed, 1) more and better
curriculum information to be
given to the student before he
arrives as a freshman: 2)
longer new student days, more
conducted to the formation of
a sound advisorradvisee relationship, and 3) freedom, for
the student to changeadvisors
so as to ensure a close support between student and ad»
visit.
The question is, which best
serves the student; an improved freshman requires curtis
culum which will introduce
the student to many different
"ways men have revised to
order the confusion around
them", or a close, near‘but
trial freshman advisory system, which would bring the
questions of generaleduaition
to the student, even before the
start of his first semester?
Nearly all of the position-papers advocate the continually
of the humanities requirement, with some improvement
of freshman advisory. Well,
back to business.
As we go to press, the slots
filter Proposal appears dead
to all patents and purposes.
Its 4542 defeat was not pubs
finally challenged, although
there appear from the running
head count based on previous
balloon of that meeting, to
have been more votes than
there were faculty members
present to vote. ‘

the health service, student
placement, and general menus programs. The member
ship would include the Dean

Mary browser, A.W.S. president, trained the makeup of
the Committee on Counseling
for being ﬂenable and ”not

lyrics”. The main duty of the
committee would be to re
view and evaluate the existing
counseling program, as well
» as make changes. browser'
noted that the students do not
hold any thing close to equal
representation on the commons
tee and also expressed double
about how the committee would
receive information or come
planets from the students.
The meeting ended in a predictions fashion: students
locked in the old ”edition
or apache?" debate. A few
spoke out against the fact
that the senate accounts or is
included small the committees;
however Loewi stuffed at the
criticism and complaints that
any other system for selecting
student representatives would
be too "time computing”.
Perhaps the best summary of
the interest spirit of the re
port came from the audience
when someone observed that
"this dress’t appear to be
much off studentpowermove»
ment; it seems more like a
student government power
movement". True, true, but
the question often week seems
to be whether or not our
student leaders realize, or
even care. So much for apache.
its Physical Education profit
signs. Another proposaljoint»
1y sponsored by Mr. Jones
and Barry vegas was distri—
based to the faculty at the code
'caution of the Oct. competing.
Mr. Jones' proposal could be
thought of as a sort of imagination compromise between
the positions of maintaining
Humanities and outstanding it
with improved freshman add
rising. His motion would be:
“Each student is required to
complete the Freshman Tutorial Program." This would
be described as a "creditfail, non-classroom learning
experience to be completed in
the first semester of the fr—
eshman year". The tumor
would act as the freshman's
advisor, and would work
closely with the student in his
preparation off series of 85’
says and acquisition of under
pendant study and writing skills.
This program, and its rationale, should comedy dishes

yes performs slowly, but it
remains the best show in town.
All students are encouraged

emphasized that mass meets

As well as the two town c0m*

Bucks Jones Plan
As the Great Faculty Requirements Debate heads into its
sixth (or is it seventh?) week the casual observer is ata
loss as to what to expect next. Two variations of the major
proposals have been detected and some are beginning to
wonder if a majority of the faculty can be formed behind
any proposal. At the close of Monday‘s meeting (in which
the faculty spent an hour and a half discussions constitutional proposal that no one proved to be interested in).
Professor Alan R. Jones stopped into the void with an amendment to the Clotfelter (the so—miles ”no-requirements")
proposal tl-at seems to answer the major objectives to that
document.
Arguments against the Clotfelterproposalincludedallegations
that it was negative in tone, that it presented freshmen students with no guidelines for choosing a program, and that it
was based on the shake promise that the understand advisory
system would be greatly improved. The Jones amendment
answers each of these objectives although it cannon counter
those who disagree with the basic philosophy of "no requirements" (23 out of 90 in a strap vote four weeks ago) and
who argue that there is a certain deﬁtable body of knowledge
that all liberal arts students should be exposed to before
graduation.
The Jones amendment calls for the institution off required
Freshman Tutorial program which he describes as follows:
"The Freshman Tutorial Program is a credit-fail
non-classroom learning experience to be completed
in the first semester of the freshman year. Each
student will work closely with his faculty tumor in
preparing a series of essays during the semester,
'and the aim of the program is to introduce entering
students into a new learning experience emphasizing
independent study and writing skills. Satisfactory
completion of» the program will carry four credits.
The tumor will also act as the student‘s understand
academic advisor. "
The proposal gets to the heart of the advisory problem and
also provides the writing skills course that many processors
feel is necessary for freshmen. It is far superior to the Humanities requirement (standing alone) in that it emphasizes
skills over facts, an emphasis that many feel liberal arts
in general should echo. In addition Grinnell has long needed
a program to enable its students to make the transition from
traditional high school fare to Grinnell’s emphasis on independent study. None of the current requirements even approaches this need. .
The Jones amendment to the revised Clotfelter proposal
adds a strong positive note to a proposal which enables Grinnell to come closer to the ideal we seeing strong personal
liberal arts education. . -

Hits Initiative Fund
by J.c. Labowltz
The Initiative Fund has come
up with a new set ofguidelines
that they are using to give away
our money, and they are a lot
of fun. it seems thatDougMendenhall and the gang have decided to expensive "creative
and innovative activities" in
their allocation of our social
funds, which are part of the
$47 student activities fee that
we all pay and from which all
good things flow (SGA, con<
cents, etc.). What exactly is
meant by "creative and innovative” is rather value, but
as I understand it, the emphasis will be away from the traditional form of social activities that have been funded in
the past.
Part of the impacts behind
this is the defining policy set
down by "collegeauthorities"
that no alcohol be purchased
by the college, directly or in*
directly, due to the leyl imtL
situations of such an act. This
will also mean seattle college
will not honor such practices
of the past as turning in receives for $59 and charming
that this was for potato chips
1 certainly have no quarters
over this issue of alcohol. (I
did have lots of quarters with
it, but it was presently pointed
out to me that I was fighting
the Iowa Criminal Code so i
no longer have any quarters.)
‘ What I raise questions about
is the idea that social activities have to be "creative and
innovative" in order to be
worthy of being funded. I have
already' heard of one instance
'where Gary like thread party
for iupeople (an old-mentioned
type party which at least 41
people here seem to enjoy)
and when he applied for initiative funds, was told phantom
few people attended to warrant
money. Now my roommate,
smaller Miller (Grand island,
Nebraska. bath right, throws
right) saw the Red Balloon on
Sunday, and is fired up to buy
a an of medium and some millions and pass them around.
Lois of fun, and definitely creative. Al Jones' Utopia class
is going to the Amanas for
lunch which is filling if not
copyright creative and innovative.
My point is that social concerns and activities of a great
many members of the campus
community are being determined by a non-election body
that may not have been devil‘
new to do that, and that “illegitimate social activities",
traditional, conservative, or
highly imagination, may be re?
tested and refused funding.
And, on the other hand, activities that may not warrant
the use of student fees maybe
funded simply because they
are unique.
What I seem to be saying to
the Initiative Fund is thaithey
should use more criteria than
effectiveness and creativity
in determining allocation of
social funds. I realize seattle
same guidelines that l speak
of also make this same point,
but [would not like to see the
president set in the beginning
of a single criterion used in
allocation money. Each request for money should be
analyzed individually for its
social value and benefits,with
the idea being tiny the students’ money should be spent
legitimately.

Group pages particular Reform;
Debate Centers 0n Requirements
This summer a specialcommittee of 11 faculty and ad
ministrators studied several
plans for curriculum reform,
concentration on a11~college
requirements, with the intent
of representing specific
proposals for curriculum reform to the faculty this fall.
The study group was unable to
reach a consensus on a gen'
oral plan formal requirements,
but it did suggestseverai specsﬁc changes in the present
structure which were adopted
by the faculty to be effective
immediately.
The .committee grew from
the desire of faculty mem—
bars and students lastsemester to reevaluate the present
curriculum as it concerned
allrcollege requirements-and
to make changes where they
were guarantee. Discussions
last semester, among students and faculty and within
departments and divisions,
had divided most people among three major positions on
reform: 1) those favorite the
Clotfelter “no-breasts" re
apartments proposal, 2) those
favorite distribution requirements, and #3) those favorite
the present, structured requirements. The study Commit
tee, which had been appointed
by the Dean at the end of last '
semester, had hoped to reach
agreement on one of these
proposals or a modification
and submit that to the faculty.
However, even after the std-
dy group did research on the ‘
changing thinking about requirements that has been going
on at colleges and universities throughout the country, it
was unable to reaching better
consensus than when it sorted. The final recommendation
to the faculty on majorreform
was a nine page report obtaining the threeproposals (including two different distribution
requirement schemes) and the
nationally for each of them.
The summer study committee
tried the faculty to make it
their first business this semester to debate each of these
proposals in turn. and make a
final decision this semester.
The faculty is in the process
of doing that now.
On a more concrete level, the
committee agreed. with little
or no disagreement, to recommend to the faculty four
changes in the present carry—
culum. These proposals were
adopted by the faculty at their
first meeting this semester.
The first change was theatre
donation of the upperclass general education requirement,
or minor. It was considered
overly restriction. and sometimes ridiculous in the way it
was administered.
. rings unless
The committee also agreed
that it should be possible to
make the science and social
science requirements any
time before the end of the junior year. This was a records—
tion of an already content policy of the Committee on rca-
comic funding toward grant- .
ing delays, as well as a move
to put more flexibility into the
curriculum. Also, two Physics
courses were added to the list
of courses which satisfy the
physical science requirement.
The third proposal of the
summer study committee was
for formal recognition offered
types of motors: departmental, interdisciplinary, and
independent. All of thesemaj-
org had already existed, but :3.
by making them more formal, '
the faculty opened the way for
more independent motors,and 5"
the expansion of such motors L,
as Religious studies and pos- c
silly Urban Studies into inter» k,
disciplinary motors.
Finally, a fourth recommendation was incorporated into ‘.
the committee’s report to the ‘
faculty at the suggestion of
the SGA cabinet, with which
the study committee and the
Trustees met for severaldays a"
at the end often summer. This .
student-backed proposal was .,

SGA Asks references
On JudicialBroposal
by John partner
The Senate has recentlybeen
working on new proposals for
hall judicial councils and for
a campus judicial council.
Their proposals will be combined in a studentrbody references to be distributed
50011.
The present ideas for reorganizing the judicial councils' warnings have been revised from a set of proposals which failed references
passage last semester by a
little less than two percent
(58.7% out of a needed 60%).
Greg Vranicar, Student Coordinator, says that the failure of the proposals was
partly due to the definition
of "open hearings" that was
made, partly due to the large
absorption vote. (conventions
had been defined not to include empty balloon.) These
earlier references proposals, however, have much in
common with the current ones.
Both are shared toward set»
king up hearings for students
who are accused of violation
college or form rules, or
who indicate cases against
forms for violation of their
rights under the Student Bill
of Rights. There are three
basic changes:
first, the definition of "open
hearings" has been changed
from an audience of twenty
people (the first twenty who
show up at the hearing) to
about 72 people (the capacity
of Fine Arts 104). The basic
idea for even this limitation
is to preserve a fairly ordered atmosphere in which
the defendant please his case;
also. peoplewill not developed
to speak at campus~wide her»
they are witnesses.
Second, the Senate has reorganized the composition of
the judicial council to include
three students and two focus‘ ,
ty members, instead of three '\
students and three faculty 5.
members. This change is de- .'
signed to prevent hung votes ,
and also to support a totally»peers concept while uncle»
king faculty viewpoint. ‘
Third, the review power of f;
the campus judicial council
has been more clearly defined.
The judicial council will have '
power to rule on the validity ‘
of any regulation where the '
regulation conﬂacts with one
of three basic documents ‘the SGA constitution, the Student Bill of Rights or any
statute of civil law. This proposed definition would give a
student the power, for example, of appearing to the judicial council if a hall was violation his right, under the ,7
student Bill of Rights, tosieep ’in his room at any time. 9’When the council determines
that a rule has been broken or
that the Bill of Rights is being
increased in some case, the
next step isa recommendation
to the President, on the facts
of the situationandany punishment to be meter out.

they want the responsibility
for the child after it is born.
The pregnancy turns out to be
a sort ofmaturingexperience,
_ Modernired Bookstore Opens,
, ‘ Gets‘McBee As New Manager
Grinnell's new bookstore opened August 30 with a new
manager, Mr. Thomas McBee.
McBee, who inheriteda rather
difficult situation last June,
has ambitiously set about improving the bookstore. He
feels very strongly that the
bookstore should serve the
students and be respective to
their criticisms and ideas. He
also feels that communications between the bookstore
and the administration, faculty, and students is extremely important.
The main problem of college
tookstores today, says McBee,
is the lack of progressive and
competent management. Too
many bookstores are now as
they were twenty years ago.
Because the need for an adequate bookstore is so import
ant to the college, great efforts should be made to see
that Grinnell has a good bookstore.
Its new manager says thathe
would like to see Grinnell have
a bookstore "as good as any
in the country for a college
this size."
The annex to the bookstore
was designed to blend without
Skidmore, things and Merril designs of the Forum and
library. A Des points code
SlI'LlCliOn company built the structure's shell and Grinnell's
physical plant employees did
most of the remaining work.
This included much of the inn
terror and fixtures which McBee estimates saved at least
a half of the building’s potential cost. Work did not start
in largest until June, mothers
was considerable pressure to
be done by the opening date of
Aug. 30. The store did open
on time but work is still con-
‘ finding on the interior fixtures
and the set up and display of
books, as well as on the exterior.
Mr. McBee feels thattheprimary function of a bookstore
is to sell texts. Supplies and
sweatshirts are secondary. He
also wishes to add more complimentary texts and broader
the available selection.
McBee, who has worked in
several college bookstores
and a private store, wishes to
try new ideas here at Grinnell and is always willing to
meet with people and listen to
any of the criticisms of the
store.
Theater Season To Begin Sunday
by Ann fastest
The theater department he
can its performing program
on Sunday, October 4, with
the play The Death of cause,
directed by red Donahoe. The
theatre will continue its pr0*
gray of plays witch restoration comedy by William Wycherley, The Country Wife,
under the direction of Mrs.
Voertman on October 22, 23,
and 24.
The Country Wife was written in 1675 and is a comment
on English societyatthattime.
The story concerns a man who
tires a quick doctor to spread
the humor that he has had a
social disease and has been
rendered innocent. He feels
that if he can continue all the
husbands of the society ladies
that his story is true, they
will have no qualms about letting him near their lovely
wives. His feeling proven to
be correct and he proceeds
to reduce and have affairs
with many ladies who, before
though obviously not one we
would want programmes into
everyone's life."
In an undefined pregnancy,
_the alternatives are complex
tion or abortion. Both were
discussed by Dr. Evalyn gender in the first session of this
year's Sex Education Conference on October 8. Approximately fifty students and resident advisors gathered in
South Lounge for the informal
lecture-queStion and answer
presentation. Dr. gender's
impressive conventions include a position with the Division of material and Child
(like of the Kansas State Board of Health, an assistant
clinical professionals in prevention medicine at the University of Kansas, and association with SIECUS, the national organization for sex
education.
Informative and exciting, the
session cleared up several
bytes about pregnancy, abor‘
tion, and adoption. Dr. gender
consolidated particularly on
the social implications of the
newly specialized abortion
this time, he had found unapproachable.
Even today this situation could be the basis for hazardous
optics. Imagine the fun they
had with it back in 1675. As
Steven H. robin (who?) says
in the introduction to the play,
"It is at once ﬂagrantly ronald
and advertise, and unconven»
tionally but differently more
al,” or if you prefer it in
Mrs. Voertman’s words, "It's
a dirty play."
A few observations about the
Grinnell production of The
Country Wife are in order.
The surgery was designed by
sophomore Mark Shanstrom
and special music is ‘being
composed by David worldwide
of Grinnell’s music report
ment. A large percentage of
the cast is freshmen; only
four members of the cast,
Larry crime, Jim Spell,Mary Brown, and Greg barnes,
have ever been seen on the
Grinnell stage before. All the
rest are notices, including
the leading character who is
being played by Don works,

america additions are performed for womenwho already
have one child. Since most of
these women are not widows
or disorders, Dr. gender be-

Student-faculty
Ratio Increased
Definitely noticeable in the
housing church, the size of
the freshman class, and the
reduction in the number of
faculty, the student-faculty
ratio at Grinnell this year has
been raised significantly. At
the end of last year the student-faculty ratio was down to
9.2, but this fall was raised
to 11.3.
Although Dean Wall, in 8 speech before the faculty, gave
evidence off growinginterest
on the part of students in the
Social Sciences. three Social
Science departments lost members this year. economics
and History dropped by one,
while Political Science dropped by two. French and Spanish both dropped by one, and
the English department experienced the biggest reduction
of all, losing four members.
The biology department gained one professor, while the
rest of the Science departments and the Fine Arts departments remained the same.
Small liberal arts colleges
are feeling an depending fin<
social crisis and realize that
this may not be solved by
specially raising the tuition
rates. Thus, the studentfaculty ratio albany collegesacross the country is being raised. The administration of
Grinnell ls accomplishing this

Academic Improvement Plan
Recipient 0! $200,000 Grant
GRINNELL, IA. ‘- Grinnell
College is the recipient of a
$200,000 grant from the Andrew W. yellow Foundation of
New York City, President
Glenn suggest announced tee
day.
The yellow grant, which re»
suited from a proposal prepared by the Grinnell Office
of Development, will help
support the program of education in the humanities included in the college‘s Academic Improvement Masterplan (AIM).
The grant continues support
of Grinnell’s educational program initiated by a prefer-
a new member of Grinnell's
theatre department.
The theatre department's
next presentation will be an
experimental children's theatre production directions Don
works. The production dates
are November 13 and 14 in
the Arena Theatre and per
companies are planned for
the elementary schools in the
Grinnell area.
The play is based on the
story of Snow White and the
Seven awards, but the script
is being written entirely by
the actors as they research
and improving. The success
of the play depends entirely
on the actors’ intensity and
creativity. Right now they are
trying to understand how a
child's mind works (which shouldn't be hard for Grinnell
students) by playing children's
games andstudyingtheactions
of children. The process is
entirely experimental and is ‘
designed to teach the actors,
as well as the audience, about
what is really involved in
theatre.
error of the yellow Foundation, Dr. suggest noted. The
Old position Foundation,wh<
ice was merger with the eva?
ion Foundation into the Andrew W. yellow Foundation
in 1969, gave Grinnell $50,
000 for the upgrading of ﬁsculty salaries in 1965 and awarded the college an additional $100,000 in ‘1967 for the
expansion of faculty study and
research opportunities in the
humanities and fine arts.
voting that Grinnell is one
of 15 liberal arts colleges in»
closed in the yellow Foundation's current program of aid
to higher education, Dr. suggest said, "This grant underlying Grinnell's nationwide
reputation as a college offering educational opportunities
of the highest quality. competitive response by the yellow
Foundation to our request for
support is in keepingwithprevious efforts of the Old position and Avalon foundations
to Strengthen the country's
independent colleges."
AIM, which was illustrated
at Grinnell in 1967, is a comprehensive program designed
to meet both the immediate
and long—range needs of the
college.
The five-year $10 million
first phase provides for the
acceleration of academic offerings in all disciplines through‘new teaching projects,
expanded research opportunities for both Students and
faculty, the purchase of more
sophistimted science equipment, and the expansion of
library holdings.
Higher faculty salaries and
an accelerated program of
student financial aid are also
being funded by AIM, as are
new construction projects and
the reservation of older campus buildings.

pieces that the courts division
face the question: "What are
the rights of a father when
the mother wants to he adopted but the man wants the
child?"
Of course, liberal abortion
laws will solve more problems
than they create. The chief
geneﬁt expected is destruction of the criminal abortion
business. Besides classic
tales of infection and memory
rage, Dr. gender revealed that
many additions are performed
on women who are not really
pregnant. Criminal abortionists are net concerned with
details. As Dr, gender said,
“Criminal abortion is a reef
get. It'saboutmakingmoney.“
Since the demand for about
tions will not just go away, a
realistic society should pro
text women from such abuse.
Dr. gender contents that lib—
realized laws stem from this
recognition. They attempt to

and - n0t between male and
female , but rather a discrepancy between:
“women with money who'
could always have a good,
clean abortion and the poor
who were exposed to degree
nation or even death when
seeking an abortion. "
Liberal abortion laws are
some improvement, but usually- Dr. gender and others
of her profession want "to
see all abortion laws revealed
because it's not a legal issue;
it is a medical issue between
patient and doctor."
Despite tremendous rain, the
Conference’s second session,
"international Relations,"
drew a large crowd. Dr. Gena
del's responses to questions
were based on her bSIIEf that
"there is a sexual system apart from the reproductive sys*

have been separated in recent
times." To deal creativity
with this new freedom, Dr.
gender tried an emphasis on
"the mortality of roles and
the wireless of the sites."
Sex must become generally

defence to a sexual relationship, Dr. gender arrested the
need for constant communication between partners. Since
old stereotypes are gone, in
their place people have great
opportunities for individual
development if they only communicate.
Dr. gender saw no evidence
of an increase in sexual activity because of the muchrdis
closed “sexual revolution."
Instead, she noted a new willingness to discuss sexuality
and a new tolerance regarding
sexual standards; As support,
she cited changing reactions
to the famous Masters and
Johnson sexuality studies.
Five years ago, the first

in a good position to defend
their work by explaining just
what they wanted to learn and
how they actually went about
it. The gathering conclusions

"We talk a 10t about human

The Extended Priority is

Men in this group will be eligible to receive induction orders up until April 1 of the

clubs Visit Campus
, To Trade One-owners
by Jim Alt
The returning-Campus program, September 12-13, was
designed to keep "open lines
of communication" between
alumni and the campus. After
the first day of conferences,
panels, and a cocktail party
the alumni had informalvisits
with students at the various
RA'S suites. The maps which
developed were, if nothing
else, highly removable:
“Do you believe in nuclear
war7"—r(class of thirty).
"I think you all study more
than we did, but you take it
all so seriously."h(class of
fifty).
“Did you lcnow that goldfish
are really understood care?"
"(class of sixth).
Along with suchheavies were
casual inquiries concerning
the closing of the college last
May and the extent ofdruguse
on campus. We did prettywell
(the alumni seemed to think) in
qualifying our actions of last
spring. It seems seattle emotions which flower so freely
at the time can be quickly re—
called to the defense of that
episode.
Orr efforts were somewhat
less effective in "explaining
the drug situation." Some are
umni were diseases to hear
the belief that "marijuana
dress't really lead straight
to herein," and that "marijuana use dress’t necessarily
mean a drug problem." Per
maps of greater interest is the
observation that the alumni
always referred to the weed
as "pot” or “grass,” while
we previously used the term
“marijuana." So who’s cool?
Meanwhile, we were insights
eyed with stories ofGrinnell‘s
past. Like ”Spring gifts" (an
acceptable jan back in the good

"There are a lot of people

Group Stays Summer
With the early closing ofthis
college last May, a critical
view of the contemporaryedu»

taken. One of the results of
this analysis was the forms
tion of the Grinnell Freedom
School this pastsummeri This
school was formed by a small
group of Students concerned
with the goals and the means
of the educational process.
According to one of the participants, the purpose of the
school was to study the concepts of radical politics, to
crystalize‘these concepts by
an investigation of materials
of interest to radicals, and
ultimately to develop the abiv
city to communicate these ideas to the populace at large.
Approximately fighters SIU’
cents participated on a full
time basis with a few faculty
members intermittently being
involved. The basic means of
achieving the specified goals
was through the formation of
a collective. With this struct
sure, the group was able to
place a special emphasis on
elimination the conditional
behavior installed into individuals by contemporary Ame

the emphasis was placed on
the position of the woman in
today’s world, and her function in relation to the collect

Exploring The Nature Of Space
GRINNELL, IA. ,_ Dr. Beryl
E. Clotfelter, professor of
physics at Grinnell College, is
the author of knew book, "see
defence Systems and Inertia
" The Nature of Space," just
published by the Iowa State
University Press.
The volume is a study of experimental results bearing on
the two questions: Does an

absolute space exist7and What
is the origin of inertia?
Prof. Clotfelter discusses
many experimental attempts
to verify the existence of ab
volume space. He points out that
although these attempts have
been uniformly unsuccessful,
the concept itself is important
for an understanding of the
science of mechanics, which
deals with the motion of ob
tests.
An unanswered question in
the study of motion iswhether
a football, for instance, is
really moving when thrown or
whether it only appears to be
moving. In the observer's
view, the football's motion is
noted only in relation to the
status or location of other objects.
If on the other hand, the food
ball could be proved to be mon
king in and of it itself and not
merely in relation to other ob*
tests, this would be "also»
late" button which would
mean that there is anabsolute
space through which such mo
tion takes place.
The question continues to be
significant because attempts
to build logicaldcscriptions of
mechanics without the use of
the concept of absolute space
have so far been unsatisfactory.
A related question which the
book discusses has to do with
inertia, the property which
buses matter to resist a change in its motion. inertia
makes an object hard to start
moving, and makes it try to
continue moving once it is
started. The question is the—
they inertia is a bulletin property of matter or whether it
is a result of interactions of
one piece of matter with the
other matter in the universe.
if, for instance, the total
mass in the universe were
reduced by half, would a football be easier to kick than it
is now? Many of the sensitive
experiments carried out in
attempts to resolve the question of inertia are described
in the book.
According to the prepare, the
book makes available to stud
cents with a minimal background in physics andmathemae
tips an introduction to current
work and modern thinking on
these concepts which are important to the ultimate question of the large-scale structure of the universe. Thus,the
book alsodiscusses Einstein's
general theory of relatively
and its relation to the concepts of absolute space and
inertia.
A member of the Grinnell
College faculty since 1963,
Prof. Clotfelter is currently
Chairman of the Faculty. His
graduate work was done atthe
Ohio State University and the
University of Oklahoma. He
received his Ph.D. degree at
the latter institution in 1953.
He is a member often American Physical Society and the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science. ‘
