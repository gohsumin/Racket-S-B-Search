Temporary union plans he yea/e ;
history of present building given
The latest in a long line of “temporary"
student unions at Grinnell will begin operation
on March it in the newly recovered basement
of Main Hall, permits c, Ludwig (vice president)
announced today. Main basement will be the
campus social center pending completion in last
of the new Grinnell College Forum on which
country 'on will start this spring. ‘
Activities in the old union building will be
displayed to new locations by the end ot Febe

to 1022 Park SL: the food service office will

offices of Georgia Dental (activities connector).
the accident auditor, and social and SGA. com—
matters will be moved to ARH. anne . and the
union triple and lounge will be moved to Main
basement
Most of the moving will take place during
the last week in February. “Although we will
try to keep the triple one king as long as possible," Ludwig c id, “it. will probably be never
mary to certain, il not suspect, some activities in
the building that week,”
The college is contracting for removal ot the
old building during March. Dismantling will
probably start soon after March it.
The present building is the only real student
union building the college ever had. Ludwig said.
It is the suitcassor at several smaller social ce
tcrs once operating in such places as the “Y’
building (now cleaner Hall). the White House,
and the residence at 1206 Broad St., now the
home of John Kleinschmidt (modern foreign
language), Union operations in these locations
were pretty much limited to requirements and
maybe some checkout and ping long, Ludwig
commented.
Dismantled and called by truck some 235
miles from the linux City Air Base, the prev—
ent building was a war surplus structure given
to Grinnell by the government along with
several other bargains buildings used to ac»
commodity the post—ww n student population.
The building was normally opened, complete
with ribbon—cutting, on Nov. 15'. 1947, Only
the first floor was used for socialepurposes;
classrooms and faculty options were on the see
and floor.
In a student contest to name the building,
“Pioneer Pub” won out. but the name didn't
Stick. However, “allow Room.” the name given
to the back portion of tlic triple is still used by
some students and faculty.
At the grand opening of the union much at.
mention was given to a new concern machine,
and a unique bonus making machine s 'd to turn
out up to 75 dozen counts per hour.
“Everyone has always thought of the students
union as it ’ternpcrary' building,” Ludwig coin
center. “Student generations since 1947 have
been telling visitors somewhat apologetically
that Grinnell is going to build a new social cells
her soon, and no one expected the old building
to remain almost it: years’

Furnishings from the present Union lounge

The college expects to continue use of the prix
