Last week we were approaches by a student
requesting the support of the newspaper in attempts
which were in progress to gain greater student control over the management of the Forum. A certain
amount of concern was expressed over the fact that
operation of the Cafe del Foro had been an uphill
battle. Forum personnel had allegedly been making
life difficult for the students who were responsible
for running the coffee house,
We were various to do whatever we could in
the way of casting light on yesterday needs or listing a clarity call to action in support of a demonstration of a student sense of responsibility. We also
suggested a few possible amended of approach to the
problem of security greater freedom in operation
of the Cafe del Foro as well as other Forum services,
We think coffee and a place to relax are good
things at three o'clock in the morning as well as
any other time of the day. There are, however, certain logistical problems involved in keeping the
Forum open late, and we comment the students who
were seeking this goal for their copyright and patients in looking into these matters. patients ran
out a little early, however, and the ugly special of
“configuration policies" once more reader its head
on the Grin all campus.
After visits with a few, but not all, of the administrators on this campus who have some say
about the way the Forum is operated proved stainless, it was decided that a demonstration of student
responsibility would have to take place unilaterally.
Accordingly, last Saturday night, when the Forum
was scheduled to close, the students did not leave.
Some of them kept dancing in North Lounge. Some
stayed to watch a movie in South Lounge. Others
just walked around picking up cigarette butts, conclusively provide to the administration that they
were responsible adults.
When we asked the students responsible for this
demonstration why it had taken place, they complaints with wilderness about the lack of immediate response on the part of the administration to
their demands for longer Forum hours. On asking
questions here and there, we discovered that at no
time had President suggest been contacted by these
students about their feelings. Since he neither locks
his door nor respondents his telephone when he sees
students coming, and since he is, after all, the president of this college, whose influence would do much
to change the mind of even the most recalcitrant of
administrators, we cannon help but feel that the
students left a few stones returned when they took
their participate action.
Above and beyond the question of whether or
not the action of the students was carefully thought
out is a deeper problem which is far too often completely ignored in the heat of a desire for concerned
action. The end does not justify the means. This, at
least, we should be able to learn from a liberal education,
In the future, if students wish to demonstrate
their responsibility as adults, it would perhaps be
better if they devon to try reason before meeting
their screen, Otherwise, we would be forced to conclude that printable was right when he said, “, .
the young are not fit to be students of political SCIence. For they have no experience of life and conduct, and it is these that supply the premises and
subject matter of this branch of philosophy. And
moreover they are led by their feelings; so that they
will study the subject to no purpose or advantage,
since the end of this science is not knowledge but
action.”

Letters to the Editor . . .
To The Editors:
M the editorials you have
written, I have noticed two which
were about subjects with which
I am well acquainted. The pattern in both was (a) to assets
“tools" which were unique, and
which could easily have been
checked for accuracy, and (b)
to base opinion on these unlrulhs.
The first was some weeks ago
when you assisted that Miss
Edwards' group independent
project, under American Studies
public, excluded males. The
opinion based on this “fact" was
that students should not be excluded from independent projects
because of sex, i suppose that
you know by now that your [acts
were wrong, though I have seen
no attraction.
Your lead editorial on April 3
is based on two untrutlls rather
than one, First, you say that Mr,
Hancock was invited by CBS to
“come to Grinnell to help come
membrane Black carter’s Day ”
That, actually, is a compound
untruih, He was not invited by
CBS, nor was he award of Black
carter's Day. Then you say,
surrounding untruth again, that
“Dean Wall, in presenting the
motion, said that the proposal
had been brought to him by
CBS.” He said that some students
had suggested the degree. In fact,
cas did not, nor were they aware
that such a proposal had been
presented -— at least the people
in CBS with whom I have talked
were not aware of it. These usr
lrulhs, however, are convenient
to your insertion that the faculty
was “wondering” to a minority
group
I also find your opinion, in this
later editorial, open to question
7 even if it had been based on
sucks. Did you object to the
degrees gIVCH to the very young
pliinler and the very young editor
during the same weekend when
Dr. King got his? (There is a
very substantial question about
whether their contributions to me
culture are as important as Mr.
Hancock’s, automatic yet another
matter.) The level of accomplishment oi Grinnell alumni
who have been awarded contrary
degrees is probably somewhat
lower than that oi considers; even
so, can you think oi any Grinnell
student since Hallie Flanagan
who has made so substantial a
contribution to the creative field?
Can you think of any alumni who
have been judges best in the ﬁend
by a national jury, other than Mr.
Hancock?
Taste is yet another matter, i

The History of Henry Wilhelm and Krystyna
german at Grinnell College
By MARK SABLEMAN
Pan Two
If Henry Wilhelm were any
other former Grinnell student,
he would have left Grinnell
after the textbook problem
was finally settled. The whole
controversy about the 1966
textbook would have been
gradually framed from the
minds of the people at print
well, and no one would really
remember Henry Wilhelm for
very long. But Henry Wilhelm
was not just any other former
student. His father, who had
been a Political Science professor here more than fifteen
years ago, still owned a house
in Grinnell, and Henry had
moved into 1408 East Street in
the summer of 1966.
Furthermore, he had no der
site to leave Grinnell: Krystyna
german and most of me rest
of his friends were here, and
he knew this community as
well as any other. He was born
in Grinnell, and spent his
early childhood here during the
days his father was on the faculty. He attended kindergarten
and first grade at Cooper
School, across from Quad. (He
receivers it as ”impressive,"
but details no controversy over
freedom of expression, the is-
‘sue that has planned him so
much recently.
Thus, when Henry Wilhelm
and Krystyna german picketed
the 1967 announcement in protest of the "membership" of
Wilhelm’s textbook, two of the
men who were there and saw
them — Glenn suggest, press—
sent of the College; and Bill
meters, Grinnell Chief of P0»
like — knew that it was not the
last they would see of Henry
Wilhelm and Krystyna german. Those men — and, more
importantly, the institutions or
groups they represented: print
well College and the town of
Grinnell — would have to content with Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna german even after
they were no longer students
at Grinnell College.
Perhaps the one most controversial issue that has come
up repeatedly since the year
book is the publication of the
underground newspaper Pterodactyl, and the involvement of
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna leu»
man, and others at the East
Street Gallery with it, Pterodactyl was begun in the fall

During 1969 four issues of
Pterodzctyl were published,
and Henry Wilhelm and Krystyna german, as well as others who lived at East Street,

each of these issues, Wilhelm's
philosophy of allowing anyone
to publish anything that he
wanted was followed. Under
this system, one staff member
could have something printed
in the paper even if the other
staff members disturbed with
it. Only this, Wilhelm felt.
could be true freedom of ex
pressing, In fact, he said, many
of the things which did appear
in Pterodactyl under this freedom of expression" rule were
things that he personally did
disagree with.
Such a newspaper with “complete freedom of expression"
may have been the ideal for
Wilhelm; others did not see it
that way. Iowa Attorney Gen-
oral Richard Turner, who had
been gathered by what he considered observe content in
earlier Pteros, arranged to
have the March 13, 1969 issue

Larry Frank took the proof

Junction, Iowa. Immediately
after the leisure, which they
thought was illegal, Wilhelm
and Frank filed suit against
Turner in U.S district court in
Des points. They asked for
return of their pictures and
copy and $1,000 compensation
and 310.000 positive damages.
The judge allowed their first
motion, for return of the paper,
but disallowed the damages on
the grounds that Turner had
judicial humanity. The second

Comment on Black
Theater Presentation
Hy Nada Mungialclli
II' a drama is derived either
ii-om the author's imagination or
from actual, real events, then the
black theater presentation
directed by actor-intelligence
error Jones contained no drama,
11 acting is the trained education
ill emotions and actions of emotional character, then the
presentation also contained no
acting in other words, this was
not theater.
lt is, therefore, inappropriate
to criticism the presentation as
theater. What is important and
add able is that this nontlicatrical presentation strongly
held the audience‘s attention and
got them thinking. The material,
writings oi great black leaders,
was not emotional but instead very
real. The presentation or these
readings was also real. because
the actors were not preventing
to be someone else involved in
a hypothetical situation, feeling
hypothetical emotions. They
were in tlte situation and actually
did feel the emotions. They got
Ilieirmessage across.

Henry Wiemun, Famous American Theologian
Now Living in Grinnell, interpreted by S& B
By Slow Grow
One ol Grinnell's distinguished
residents is Henry Nelson
Wiemaii, a WellvkliDWn 20th
century American theologian.
Mr. Wieman taught at the
University or Chicago until his
retirement twenty years ago.
Since then he has
taught ten years at the
University of Southern Illinois,
several at the University of
Oregon, and at the University of
llouston, and for one year at
Grinnell College, Grinneli
College awarded him an
contrary degree in 1964, Mr.
Wieman is the author of several
books on the philosophy of
religion including Man’s
Ulliinnlc Commitment and The
Source of Human Good. His books
deal with the problem of defining
a new faith which is available
to modern industrial civilization.
Martin Luther King wrote his
doctoral presentation on the
works of Mr. vietnam and those
of Paul million. In an interview
with the 8&5, Mr. Wleman
discussed his views On religion
and on certain problems in
modern society.
Wieman noted that traditional
religions which look ,to another
his and rely on a personal god
are receiving in influence, largely
because ”there is no adequate
evidence” that such a god exists.
church attendance may continue’
but these religions do not effectively influence the decisions
sharing the course of our
civilization. Mr, Wieman allocated a religious philosophy of
“Creative Interchange." “This is
a creativity always present in
human lite to some degree and
at some level, it is the way every
new born infant acquired a
human mind. It Creates and
contains human existence and, to
the degree this creativity

Religion Discussion planned
By Failure in Definition
ByJaiietsinith
The Board of Religion this
week brought to the campus
tliree nominations, holding
basically different theoretical
views, Sunday, April 5 the topic
of discussion was “theology and
the Community". Allan
Wallerstadt, the moderator,
currently attempted to suggest
the necessity for a working
definition of community. The
issue was never resolved and
planned the sessions (attended
by less than 30 students) both
earnings
Each participant presented a
short talk on their personal
religious views and relations to
their community. James Moore
of Trinity Evangelical Divinity
School, sheffield, illinois, supported the “classical protecting
pathology, prepared in the 19th
century evangelical arrivals”,
feeling confident that his conviction spoke for his school, a
tight-knit community. He was
especially concerned about the
allocation of today‘s youth and
saw a need for a new faith, the
faith “[0qu by Luther." He
maintained “For modern man
attempting to female himself
and his world, the Christian
answer holds great promise:
when you cannon overcome your
condition, God can."
Ted Means of United-files
ologicai seminars of the Twin
Cities arrested the diversity of
views held at United and 8organized the capacity of his own
position. Presently, he was
functioning the G. o. F. values
he grew up with and reinforced
by his near “domestic” undergraduate years at Cornell
College, He does not accept the
density of Christ but considered
him a model after which to
pattern his life, a statement'
which caused several to question
his “Christianity,"
Monday evening the program
was entitled ”Theology and
College”, All in some way ad—
located structural changes
within the university and saw
major adults in .the Grinnell
community. Jim suggested the
college provide students with
“defined local centers of learning
among which they must choose
and arrange their experiences”.
These would be “can-universities
and neo-securities 7 each having
its funding philosophy, its
curriculum, and its student7
faculty steering committee." Ted
designated the characteristics of
a community, emphasizing ups
unless and trust and circulation
of decisions by the community
as a whole. Grinnell is not a come
munich in that itis a hierarchical
structure, and dress’t allow
adequate individual freedom.
Stephen Mallingcr of Hebrew

Jews, streaming the accessibility
of losing one's Jewishness. “Once
a new, always a new", if only
hy Virtue of circumcision. He‘
acknowledged that it is a little
more difficult to join the Jewish
community, for a convert must
be accepted by the entire community. '
Well, the theologians got down
off their parental and the
discussion rapidly degenerated
into a bull session. Personal
prices and dissatisfactions about
the educational processes and
Grinnell community were tired,
The words God and' theology
disappeared for the rest of the
evening.
The program’s purposes may
have been accomplished by
existing the nominations to
Grinnell College and the Griniiellians to students with a
theoretical background, through
individual meetings, Theology,
however. was not examined
during the panels. One participant evaluated the panels as
"additions, automatically
speaking." I am included to
agree.

of the year came out Septemr
her 18, 1969, and it did not gen
state any oi the controversy
that the previous issue had, or
the next would. The publication
at the final issue of Pterodactyl
on November 11, 1969 resulted
In more legal action. Four
people who were selling Ptero<

Krystyna german, Kit order,

makes it a belong to sell material that is deemed observe,
Those four people were are

lies this year it was thought
that the charges might be
dropped; however, a second arrangement was held on March
30, and a trial date was set for
Krystyna Neul-can and Kit
order for May 31, l970, and
for Margolan and the other defendant at a later date. Krystyna german and Kit order
are apparently being singles
out for an earlier trial,‘ but it
is not known why.
In February of this year,
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna leu»
man, and other East Street Gale
very residents announced that
they were leaving Pterodactyl
for the present because other
staff members a they mentioned Bruce listen and Sally
Hamann — had imposed majority rule, as opposed to the
”freedom of expression" principle, as the rule for peterson
ing what material should go
into item. Wilhelm, Krystyna
german and the others cons
closed their statement with the
words “We will return from our
while."
Shortly alter the Playboy
demonstration of F e b r u a r y,
1969. two students, Neil kitchen and Gregg Schmidt, wrote
an editorial and read it over
KDIC radio which implied that
the demonstration was stated
by Wilhelm, with the idea that
he would be able to profit from
the sale of photographs of it.
After this editorial was broadcast, Mrs. Ruth Prescott of the
College at Information service
obtained the text of it and has
copies made, which she sent to
the area news media under a
cover letter explaining, “We

On August 28, 1969, Wilhelm
filed a label suit in Poweshiek
County District Court in Montezuma allowing that because oi
distribution of that letter and
editorial, he was “exposed to
public sacred, contents, and
ridicule" and suffered “irreparable damage to l’IIS reputation
as a photographer," He named
Mrs. Prescott, President biggest, Dean wall, Chairman oi
the Board of Trustees Robert
joyce, Vice Chairman Ellen
Pray Maytag, and Treasurer
and Business Manager Donald
W, zambia as dependence, and
asked for $20,000 general and
315,000 special damages. Late
last year, Wilhelm withdrew
the suit because of financial
problems in remaining legal
counsel; however, he intense to
active it as soon as he is able.
In November or last year
Wilhelm was charged with Violation of a Grinnell zoning are
finance which prohibited businesses in substantially zones
areas, such as the section of
East Street where he lives. He
was tried and found guilty of
the charge in the court of Grin
well Justice of the Peace admin Lincoln.
In that trial, the stars’s eVl
dance convicted of testimony by
Chief of Police Bill meters and
Grinnell photographer Charles
number, who had bought a photo
washer from Wilhelm, and a
picture of Wilhelm’s house
showing a sign with the words
“East Street Gallery” (having
a sign of a certain size or
larger constitutes a violation ol
the zoning ordinance). The (Ice
sense was represented by Law
hence Frank, who continued that
Wilhelm was not in violation ol
the sense of the zoning ordinance, since none of his neighbors were gathered, Frank said
in his closing statement
which Judge Lincoln later
called “a gem” — that the
charge ol violation of the zen
ing law constitutes “a audio
cross attempt on the part oi
citizens to harris Henry wnhelm‘.”
Nevertheless, Wilhelm was
[fund guilty on the basis ol the
evidence, and he was fixed $25.
Wilhelm intended to appeal the
case to district court in Monte:
Your Favorite
Beverage and
black Items
zuma. but was unable to raise
the $200 necessary for an appeal bond; therefore, he chose
to pay the penalty by going to
i ' where each day counts as
$3.33 towards the line. There
are those who think that
complaint against Wilhelm on
the basis ol the zoning law cons
statutes harassment by city
lens 7 is possibly sustained.
Several people who are ac
quainted with the case indicated
to the 5&3 that pressure was
put on the Grinnell city council
to take action against Wilhelm
by citizens associated with a
beauty shop operator who had
been found guilty of the same
zoning 0 rd in a n c e several
months before Wilhelm’s case.
Furthermore. two sources, one
which is extremely reliable, ins
located that originally pressure
was put on the council to
charge the beauty shop operator
With violation of the ordinance
by one or more college processors who lived near the beauty
shop. It is, however, impossible
to ascertain with any degree oi
certainly what treasures, ii
any, were involved in the brings
ing of the charge against file
help.
Last fall, after arena Tepiel,
a former Grinnell student who
lived at the East Street Gallery,
was fired by the owner or a
cafe south of town, she and
Krystyna german went to tall
to her former employer, Mr.
Gene McCurry. While McCurry
and arena pepper were talking,
Krystyna german attempted to
take their picture. When he saw
this, according to Krystyna german, McCurry went towards her
and he and an assistant granted
her camera. Subsequently. she
filed a complaint against Mc»
sorry asking that he be charged
with assault and battery. ice
sorry died not guilty, and a
trial was held in Judge Line
cold's court.
After the first two witnesses
were called, however, Krystyna
german withdrew her complaint because she felt that the
county attorney, Michael which,
was not objective to questions
from McCurry's attorney which
were irrelevant to the case r
for example, questions about
where she lived. She feels that
which's less than vigorous handling of her case — which was
verified by the reports of others
— was the “greatest example oi
town justice" she has yet encountered. which told the 58:3
that he tried to do his best on
that case, as he does with all
cases. He said that he recommended that she not file the
case, but that "it might have
been for their own particular
purposes,”
When asked by the 5&3 to
explain why he used the word
“they” when referring to Krystyna german and the case he
had with her, County Attorney

writes continue to dominant
blacks is that “blacks in high
positions had to prove theme

of Massachusetts as a nexample. “Senator brooks‘s cons

“Integration of textbooks,

Sunday morning, the Rover
and Joseph H. Williams, guest
speaker, presented a person
on "Empty Seats ~ Missing
Brothers.” The Chicago Gospel Ensemble provided music.
The Rev. Williams addressed
himself first to the black matters: ”A matter is one who
would die rather than set aside
his connections.” He presented
a long list of black matters of
all skin colors. assessing that

”The black community ought
to be concerned with black
matters because we are the
matters. Anyone who stands up
for humanities people in this
society becomes a matter.
When Martin Luther King, Jr.
started talking about power for
poor people, about ending the
war in Vietnam, he had to go."
"Racism is a darkness that
services America today. There
will be no generation of black
folks until the middle~class
white folks are generated. To
them, things are more import
want than people:"
Then the Rev. Williams discussed his main point -— the
role black people should take
in their generation movement:
“I'm tired of the statement
‘l'm ready to die.‘ There's too
much to be done. Those people
in the trademark are no threat
to anyone. If you die while
working to help the community, that’s different — you
don't have any control over
that."
The Rev. Williams directed
his conclusion to the black
members of the conservation.
“People don't have to worry
about two kinds of people —
those with no tools and those
who won’t use them. If you
don‘t go back to your communities and do more than you
could have without your education, then you’re waiting
your time.”

It should be the task of
government and of all men to
provide conditions most
favorites for Creative In»
merchants. “It we cannon solve
the problem oi enabling men to
live together with the power oi
modern technology in a world oi
diverse cultures, we shall anIiihilatethehuman race."
Does Mr, Wieman see any signs
that Creative interactive is
developing? “There are several
hopetul signs, but we can have
no assurance that these will lead
to more Creative Interchange.”
Wieman cited increased concerning the poor, the growing ten»
dance of nations to terrain from
war (largely because of the big
nations' recognition of each
other": power), increasing
recognition of the need {or
economic, political, and other
interactive with the Communist
world, growing discussion be
green blacks and writes over
recognition of the status of metro
Americans, and the recognition
that students should participate
more in the process of their
education. These signs indicate
to Wieman that “either we are
looked or headed for something
better than the past." They are
neither all bad nor all good, “but
they hold the potentiality for both
good and bad results.” The mere
recognition of such problems and
differences is a step in the right
direction, according to Wieman.
What can the United States do
now to help create a good at»
mosphere for Creative Interchange’! “First, we Should get
out of Vietnam. All we are
warning by our involvement there
is a false notion of practice;
we could Withdraw much more
quickly than we are." Another
step would be to open communication with Communist
Cuba. Wieman believes that the
present policy is only driving
Cuba closer to the Communist
black. “There is an inside hate
and [ear or communist. Surely
it is a bad system, but the only
way to correct it is to open
Communication." nationally the
United States has done a fairly
good job in Wieman‘s opinion.
“For one thing we are
recognition the need to execute
all men, I don’t think integration
is going to solve the problem oi
education metro Americans.
Blacks would like to join the
society as equals, not as his
serious, so the first task should
be to improve their school
systems.”
“The United States needs to
recognize that its problem is not

the creative energy which will
promote Creative Interchange,"
wieman noted that many experiments are now going on in
American Education One of the
great problems is how to execute
those Students With low IQ'S. Mr.
Wieman believes they can be
taught, but just what and how
he is not sure. “Education should
quickly a student‘s mind so that
he can think [or himself and
develop as an individual."
What is Wieman‘s opinion of
the current student power
movement? “Students should he
encouraged to express their
views to the faculty, but I think
they should not picture the course
of their education.” Mr, Wieman
believes that the reason for all
the turmoil on college computer
today is that the old traditions
and habits necessary for
governance of a college have
been to some extent left behind,
but that new traditions and habits
necessary for governance of a
college with more student participation have not yet developed.
When such traditions develop
Wieman expects more
probability,
wiemaii referred ti-recently to
a practitioner state, which he
believes American Society is
experiencing, This is generally
characterized by a decrease in
respect for a man‘s status, In his
opinion this could lead to a better
situation it, in place of such respect, more respect for personality were develops. “Of
course in order for a society to
continue there will always need
to be some recognition and
respectioraman’estates.“
“Many in our time turn from
God to the universe as the major
concern of religion. There is a
arabic error. The universe as
known to the human mind is a
transition vision. A thousand
years ago it was very different
from what it is today. A thousand
years from now it still be very
different from what it is today
The universe ls known to the
human mind as being continuously created by expanding
the range of data and creating
more comprehensive theories.
Thus a knowable universe
entries from out of the wellness
of being. This infinite wellness of
being is an unfathomable
mystery forever beyond our
understanding. To call it God is
to claim to know something about
what is unknowahle, But
religious commitment to
Creative Interchange will expand
to the almost what we can know,
can value, can control and will
resolve the conﬂacts that threaded
our existence."
ML Wieman has not written
any books for two or three years
although he has often been asked,
He sites time as the culprit and
feels he no longer has the
necessary energy. In the future

there are a couple of connections
that lthiiik can be made
I think that there must have
bccn a time which ball players
understood that Baseballwas hke
lite or that lite was like
baseball. And this was all right.The trouble must have started
when the metaphor started to
take the place of the reality; that
is, when the people in the game
started to decide that baseball
was lite. There are people in the
game like that, , ,it seems to me
when you conduct retailers

,\l.\l :ldidn'l want to call him
"nuts," but I think that he partners or a certain happiness, and
there are others like him in the

example. And there have always
been people in the game like that,
but I don‘t think the game was
nominated by your people who
(’llllltl not make th distinction
lit-green baseball and life.
Now when you start to think
ol’ baseball and hit: as the same
thing. then it's only a quick little
jump from the idea that it has
to be played to win at any price
7 that's one correctly 7 and the
other is that the game must be
made to pay oil, 7Grcediness,
Since you live by material in the
vol'ld..,baseball is no longer a
game for this kind oi mortality.
“'5 no longer like having a
stable of ﬂold horses. You not
only have to have a stable at good
horses, but the horses have to
win, and they have to bring in
alot oi tough
Mr britney hash't played the
game that way, But that crowd
out in center field don't seem to
know that. They would seem to
belong to a different baseball
mortality that's completely lost
sight of the idea of baseball as
like life. To them baseball seems
to Dollie.
Now, when can you begin to
see the decline'7 Probably,
periodically — and this is a kind
front 7 Babe Ruth is probably
the beginning of the trouble, That
is, when you start to build the
team around the idea oi a guy
blocking the ball over the since.
And you start moving the lenses
a bit, so the guy can get the ball
over the fence And you start to
back the price at admissions up
a bit, so they can come to see
the guy hit the ball over the since
that‘s been moved in a bit. And
you pay the guy a hundred
thousand dollars a year to hit the
ball over the icncc; the game's
all tscrcwedi up.
5&B: The idea is that Babe

ByJ. c. Labowitz
The 123rd llc'softball season opened on Monday, and from all
medications this season should be the highest point in softball history
since J,B. Grinncll intended the game to see how far west he had
come,
Be that as it may, the season opening saw Cleveland take Loose
6rd, and liable shuttle barnes 370, despite Dave Brown’s 15 strikeouts
for Homes, which must Set some kind of record. Dave MacKenzie
wash't that good for Cleveland, but he had some hitting, which is
somewhat essential. Great consideration was {get in IM circles (or
diamonds) about the refinance of matching 7 only 13 runs in 2 games!
Such worried were displayed and IMS returned to form by
Tuesday, as Cowles beat East by something like 28-8, and Read and
ali~samples bad a kitchen's fuel that ended 23725, Read. Go had
some players from very tar
off-campus, like Park Elementary,
and Read needed a home run from an outfielder named Labowitz
to win. West morris is not competing in softball, and the franchise
is being moved to the Faculty. Steve Johnson is financing the Faculty
players and schedule, since press are not supposed to cut classes
for [M games. But then again, neither are students.
Grinnell’s track team made an inauspicious start shopping the first meet of the season to works.
Grinnell took two events in the quad meet. morris
Stubbs (above) took the triple jump with a 45-0 refinance, And Bill Schooler took the javelin with a loss of 151-10.

are gradually proceeding The
game is automatically the same
They haven't even changed the
rules in any important way,
which is a good thing.
Although. .they have
monkeyed around with the game
a great deal. They've monkeyed
with the ball, they've monkeyed
with the lenses, they've
monkeyed with the height of the
