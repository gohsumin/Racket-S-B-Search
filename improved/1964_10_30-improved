Mrs. Goodbroil Takes Administrative
Post to Work with Tradition, Rules
By Nancy Gromko
-“The sole function of the newly created Quadrangle Office
is to answer questions which
bear upon tradition and college
rule," states Mrs. married
Goodbrod, assistant dean of women.
“Due to the increase in college growth, the administration felt a need for an office
devoted to Quadrangle interests
alone,” the assistant dean
stated. "This Will leave Dean
Slocum free to concentrate on
counseling and far-range planning.”
The new office, concerned
with routine affairs, serves to
relate regulations and responsibilities to the individual girl.
“Our purpose,” Mrsr Goodbrod continued, “is to help the
Grinnell women confirm to the
established pattern of college
life.”
“Any institution which accepts money for the care of an
individual,” she explained,
“must know at all times where
the individual‘is. Thus one of
our biggest responsibilities is
to template the daily checking
in and out of students.”
This ‘»”co-indicating office"
works closely with the quad so»
dial chairman to plan activities
for girls, such as houseparties
and dirty‘games.
Mrs. Goodbrod, a graduate of
 
the University of Nebraska, has
MRS. GOODBROD
been teaching in the education
department at Grinnell since
1960. For the past three years
she has supervisor student
teachers in elementary education.
Asked her reaction to the current effectiveness of the new
office, Mrs. Goodbrod replied,
“What has impressed me most
is how long there must have
been a need for such an office.”
Mrs. savings and Mrs. Main,
housemothers of years and
Main, will also be assuming responsibilities in the new Quadrangle office.

The Speaker of the Senate made it clear to us this
week that he feels the editor of the charles and Black is
shipping her duties by not. reporting the activities of
Student Government officials. Such an occupation irri—
rates a there in our journalistic side that has been pretty well solved for several months by a general aura of
good will and a lack of specific problem. Now the Stu—
sent Government has what it considers a specific problem—lack of communication with the members of the
student body. And we have again noticed that there in
our side—the idea among some on campus that the $813
should be a house organ for SGA.
At the beginning ofrthe semester the President of
the Student Government Association and the Speaker
of the Senate were approaches by the S&B and asked
to Write a column on a regular~basis that would pre«
sent the problems and procedures of Student Government officials as they went about their business. The
answer, returned by phone several days later, was that
the potential columnists didn't have time to write such
a piece and that it might tend to show that they “were
blowing their own horny." .
In an effort to keep students up on the activities
of SGA, the S&B made multiple inquiries into the Open
House question — contacting SGA officials as well as
administration members. Each time we were told to
wait. We have made similar inquiries into the warnings
of the senate and into the various complexities of the
Forum. Each time we hit a dead-end that says — wait
until we are ready to say it. A few brave advances on
our own — the question of student administration cooperation and the problem of printers — have been
met by comments front SGA officials of “why did you
say that now, just when things were going so well?"
It seems that for the 5&3 to be responsible it must
cover SGA. But we will not serve as a house organ that
dishes before the student readers what has been spoonfed to us by our leaders at what they consider the most
appropriate time.
To print the news on SGA available to us now
would limit our coverage to an insignificdnt article
about how each member of the executive cabinet
speeds nearly 26 hours a week in meetings. Or we
could substitute in the band and blow their horny for
them. We refuse to do either.
When SGA is ready to invite us into their realm
so that we can examine all areas of inquiry and present
at our own discretion what we deep of interest to the
student and Grinnell, then we can function in a “news”
capacity rather than as a propaganda sheet. And when
SGA officials are ready to put themselves bcl'are the
student body without their usual pump and circumstance they might find the lines of communication
more open. LD

Grinnell Graduafefxpresses Concern Over Developments
To the Editor:
1 graduated from Giinneli
College many years ago. and I
have spent most of my time
easily formatting yesterdays,
but for some reason I’m finding
renewal interest in Gn‘shell.
Perhaps it is because my boys
are reaching college age now
I’ve been doing some reading
and talking about the old place.
What I've concluded, I’ve concluded constantly. Perhaps the

might be to direct my remarks
to one specific, playing incident.
A letter in last Week‘s “Scarla! and Black” by an state student, who painted his room voluntarily, skilled out the words
that I could only mouth.
Since time began, orders have
looked down and spoken the
followed magic, “If we did it
for one, we’d have [0 do it for
all,” a statement that has i3
valid expression only before a
mass of a thousand gambling
and gambling motors. It seems
that if Grinnell is to continue
 
selling itself as an institution
kept proposals small, with an
Openrminded, related ' atmosphere, an understanding faculty
and administration offering personal attention and guaranteeing the freedom of student
query and challenge, it cannon
allow this kind of blind reaction
to become typical.

room is cordless punishment.
Punishment? Punishment for

Student Questions Validity of
trading System. Counseling
To the Editor;
Much has been said by Dean
Stauss concerning the responsibility and role of the student
at Grinnell; now, I think the
role and responsibility of the
administration Should be dis—
closed. I am particularly concerned about the apparent lack
of concern of the administration in an area most vital to
the student body—the future at»
for Grinnell.
Two factors are involved—the
present trading system and
the dutch in adequate counseling about future education: Why
is a system continued that does
not believe grade pressure but
extends the scale to the disadvantage of the student? I appreciate the desire to maintain
high academic standards, but
if the student body and the
college has the reputation supported by the administration.
why inn't a trading system established which favors (or, at
least, dress’t discover) the flu»
sent; or is this reputation a
arcade?
I recall from my expressions
as a prospective the theme of
capable, knowledgeable counseling. 1 find this strikingly
packing in graduate school guidance. Faculty committees, now
responsible for clips function,
are inudequnie. Sometimes they
are variety familiar with the
personality of the students involved and frequently arc uni,
familiar hills schools Outsidel
of a limited new. If the college‘
can maintain an extensive department dealing wuh students considering entering Grillncll, why inn’t there a dcparb
merit dealing with one of the,
 
most critical concerns of the
majority of students in Grin»
well?
I feel the students’ supposed
interference about Grinnell’s
future is almost matched by
the administration's apparent
interference about the future of
Grinnell students.

achieve this end, we abuse the

Taylor Wants Senate to ‘entire';
feels It Is No Longer Necessary
The Student Senate has called
for its own death In its august life of four years, it has
occupied well over 2000 man
hours a year in meetings alone
(plus all the other bunc that
Went on behind the scenes). it
has proved that no matter how
wonderful a representative legislative body may seem in political theory, it is not only inefficient, but also entirely unnecessary on this particular
college campus.
Let us be realistic. Grinnell
College is in the business of
education, Grinnell students
are in the business of learning. But Grinnell College is not
In the business of providing
an outlet for pseudo—political
activities.
I do believe, however—after
too many years of experience
with this octopodal monster—
that student government has a
function on this campus—an
important function.
Those members of the college community who have
worked on it seem in agree—
ment, as am I, that student
government has two function
to carry out those responding »
items assigned to the students
by the college, and to consult
with officials of the college
when student opinion is de-
, sized, _
If one must use political
theory. or its carbon, the Grinnell student body is not governing, Thus it does not possess governing power. We, as
students, have volunteered for,
and are assigned certain her
sponsibilities by the college. It
is the function of student got»
element to carry them out.
These are properly the du»
ties of house treatments and
their assistance, and of the appointed committees,
Student leaders then, are students who are willing to implement these functions, to do
the nasty chorus and go in the
meetings, in return for the
benefits of friendship and personal satisfaction which these
positions offer.
Getting back to the Student
Senate, let us be realistic again.
It's a big hunt of extra bag»
gage; it's logging the monster
down. The following, with very
 
little exaggeration
goes on now.
I-call events two senators, Forty senators elect speaker. Senate meets. Executive Cabinet,
ass Board, soil-11> present
proposals for Senate to rubber
stamp. House council already
knows through house president.
Rest of hall is not at house
meeting, dress’t care, or
dress’t know who hall senator
is
is what
And, really, how could anyone consult with a body such
as this?
The situation varies, of
course, from hall to hall, but
the point is that the house
treatments and the executive
cabinet have actually worked
out everything the Senate has
passed for four years. It’s used
all that time and energy doing
nothing—except getting in everyone else’s way.
No one is trying to users its
power—just to get a job done.
There's no power to users.
I submit that we should politics kill the Student Senate
and busy it with all the due
pump and circumstance it has
lived among.
Let the AWS and the CDIHP
translate in the first place. Then
they would only have to do it
once. Let them consult with
the administration. They actually know what is going on.
They would be much more effective. Let them have the trust
they deserve,
There need be no separation
of powers in a system that has
no governments. We need a
portable, efficient system to
do a lot of chorus—not A model
of the federal system. _
Since we expand so much
time and energy doing beautifully nothing except chorus
anyway, let us rid ourselves
of this part of the monster, and
allow those students who will
take on our responsibilities the
freedom of an efficient system
in which to work.
Let us realize, also, that we
are students: Let's free ourselves of topless meetings. .
and spend our time with books.

Shades Of Gray—w
Once Upon a Time. .
A True
By Carl Otis Gray
In years to come when I am
very old and my little brown
skilled children come and sit
upon my trees and ask for the
honest facts about black and
white, I shall sign and account
for them amazing facts about
how they got to be what they
are. I shall tell them the following story about their Daddy.
Once upon a time when I was
young and still in college, I
met a Black Muslims At mat
time I was young and idealistic and I stopped to set this
gentleman straight about the
hats of life,
“Sir,” said 1, giving due re»
spent to his age, ”don’t you
realize that you are using extremely tactics by handling this
hate fingering propaganda?”
“Man, you have been brain
washer by those so - called
White minerals" was his countries reply.
"Your position is just as had
as that of the Ku flux plan,"
I reminder him.
“Yes, man you have been
brain washer,” he continued.
”You know of course, that
all leading anthropologists re—
cute any concept of racial supervision," Again, I had to rev
fresh his memory.
“Tell me what good has the
white man done in this world?”
”Well, really, that‘s a fairly
obvious question to answer.
Look around you. Most of the
consequences of the modern
world do happen to be a pro
dust of Western civilization,
which of course has most of
its heritage in the course of
European and Middle Eastern
development."
“Oh really?" he seemed interested now.
“Yes. and you see as Americans we necessarily are years
to this heritage . . ."
“As Americans?"
“Yes, as Americans," I had
to be patient with him, ”You
see the fourteenah and fifteenth
amendments say . . ."
”The fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments to what?”:he was
relatively dense,
“The American Constitution.
Plus there is this new Civil
Rights Bill that proven without
a doubt . . .”
“Wait a moment,” he interpreted, “what are you a citizen
of?"
“America, the United States.
U.S.A.”
"What is your n alive
tongue?” he asked,
“English."
“Ho; ho!” he thought he had
me, “were your parents english?"
“No. they were American."

Suddenly there came the

you‘re not a metro or an
American, you’re a psuedo African!" He seemed so sure.
Well! Never had anything .

He meant to tell me that my

that they won’t understand its

Sir penis and lady Brogan Enio y
Grinnell's forward], related Tone
 
By Susan Taylor
“My wife and 1 are only courtesy hundred years apart,” Sir
penis Brogan observed as we
: sat around his office. His way
humor was showing again, but
he was altogether serious, tool
Both he and his wife have written books on France; here ending in the fifth century; and his,
during th e Third Republic
(1870-1940).
Sir and Lady Brogan are both
visiting processors at Grinnell
this semester. Sir penis holds
the Rosenneld professionals in
American studies, and he is
teaching a senior seminar.
Lady Brogan teaches two his—
tony classes: ancient civilization and methodology.
It is, then, their academic interests that are courtesy hundred years apart. Their fresh
outlook and charm are very
contemporary
Though they normally beside
in Cambridge, Where Sir penis
is a member of the faculty of
greenhouse, a college of about
two hundred students, they
travel to the geographic area
of their main interests each
year. Lady Brogan goes to the
Mediterranean area for a couple of months, while Sir penis
comes to America. “We have a
SIR DENIS
 
rendezvous in England from
time to time,” he said.
This is the ﬁrss time they
have spent an extended period
at a small American college.
The C o n pl e find Grinnell
“powerful and ‘friendly," but
they said that it is too early in
the year to know enough about
Grinnell students. I asked if
they had heard any rumors
about “North Campus.” Sir
penis said that he has served
a concern, but does not really
know much about the problem.
He said lie would ask some s'tlL
cents what was going on.
They like the related atmosphere on campus. “You don‘t
seem to be married and passed
and to think only of your
marks." Lady Brogan said, She
explained that at Grinnell there
dress't seem to be the competition to get in things and to do
things that she had observed at
larger American universities.
They were also glad to note
that “nobody had heart failure
at football games.”
While at Grinnell, Sir penis,
a corresponding of long standing, is doing some articles for
the London Observer. He recently completed an article on
Cole Porter for the Cambridge
Review. Always busy at his

In addition to their busy academic life, the orleans find
time to enjoy both the college
community and the town of
Grinnell. “We enjoy being able
to walk where we want to go,”
Lady Brogan said. i‘In Cambridge I get around on a bicycle. Here I do all my shop

Brogan enjoys the grocery
store in town as much as she
does the college. a professor
told me. She shops at one of
the large supermarkets, but
asked whether it might be affair to print its name.
She failed as she said that
they enjoy the “lovely rows of

couple before Christmas vacation. “1 have to be home to
cook Christmas dinner,” Lady
Brogan told one of her classes. Sir penis explained that the
English have caught on to the
American custom of turkey dinner for Christmas. They have
quite a turkey business. He
told me that just before the
holiday season there is a great
deal of financing of surveys, es—
pecialiy around London. “It’s
the nearest thing we have to a
wild west,” he said refused,
“except, of course, train countries.”
I asked Lady Brogan just
'what she teaches an methodology claSs in the middle of
Iowa. “1 tell them about interesting archaeological rights in
the Mediterranean,” she said.
Her first trip to syria, where
she has done a great deal of
work, was in 1948, when she
was among the first group of
British archaeologists allowed
in North Africa after World
War 11.
Though he is mainly known
as a victorian and so regards
himself. Sir penis now devoted
considerable time to screening
contemporary life in Great
Britain, France, and the United
States. Though he is perhaps
more in touch with U. S. here
in Grinnell, I rendered if he
felt less in touch with the world
here than in London. He admitted that this was the case, but
said that as far as news is concerned, one is better off in
Grinnell than in North lyric
When Lady Brogan is _
Noﬂh Africa, she is sometimes
several days away from the
news. She explained that she
only learned of the assassinatian of President Kennedy the
following day beCause she
changed to meet a man who
knew of it.
Sir penis told of his experience in England in corner-
 
* ‘k *
(ion with the Kennedy investigation. He was at the London
airport when he received a
call to report immediately to
a Television Company. The
President died while he was
en route downtown. Brogan
went on the air that night with
a commentary.
He explained that, much to
its continued entertainment,
BBC was the only network in
the world which played situation remedies for some time
after the President’s death.
This happened because all the
top men were at a party and
nobody was available with the
authority to change the programming,
Sir penis Brogan was also
featured in a BBC commentary the next day. “1 said about
the same thing both times,” he
told me, "but,” he watched, "1
got paid twice for it.”
I concluded then that he was
EEC's “expert on American affairs.” Sir penis failed and
said “My son does more of
that."
“Why, penis, you are!" his
wife corrected.
“X‘m paid for it," he replied
forestry, and failed.
There is a majority of women
in the American studies seminar which he teaches, so I
asked how he liked teaching
them. Sir penis said that women in the classroom don’t both»
er him; indeed, one might think
he rather enjoys it. He feels
strongly that women should go
to college, and explained that
though it is harder for them to
get in most colleges at. Cambridge, the university is about
one-sixth female. Oxford draws
about onerfourth of its students
from the father sex.
Last week when the seminar
met, Sir Brogan made a plea
that the male students, in particular, come to see him regarding paper topics. He said that
since he got his office, he has
 
* ‘k *
had many female gallery, but
no men. Perhaps this is a comment on the Grinnell social situation
The orleans are getting to
know more students as the
semester programmes. They en-
jones the color of the Homecoming weekend and commented particularly about the floors
and the intensity of them. They
even attended the football
game, which they also enjoyed
——especially since the right
team won.
Both visiting processors are
purchasing their contact with
students at weekly dinner meetings with'small groups of students
room.
If you chance to meet a white
failed gentleman with a red—
dy completion, and probably a
red shirt or best, accompanied
by his most charming wife, rest
assured that this time the encoding red»costs are welcome
and friendly. Take a few minutes to get to know them. You’ll
be glad you did.

A Fired-up crew of Beloit Burk

filing up a 17-0 half-time lead
and coaching to their 4th victory
in 5 starts. The Pioneers are

The game started well for
Grinnell, the Pioneers intervention a spray Buccaneer aerial
and movie to the Beloit in.
But at this point, the attack
started and Beloit moved the
length of the field to go ahead,
adding a field goal later in the
first quarter to lead 9-0.
After the half, Dave Synhotst,
Grinnell halfback, put the Pioneers briefly back into convention with a touchdown hunt return covering 46 yards; but BeloiL applied again to put the
game on ice. The final Pioneer
score came on an ll yard Barry Anderson to boston powers
pass late in the final period.
The delicious ground defense
of Beloit, which had planned
many a midwest conference opponent, was instrumental in the
Victory. The Pioneers could
only net 15 yards on the ground,
and 34 via the air; and 5 first

game was marked by seven

The action started fast after

And before the quarter was half

By Paul bring
Two years ago in their football preview, Sports
Illustrated referred to the Midwest Conference as fratracidal, referring, among other things, that only an ignoramus would attempt any predictions on the games
or the run for the championship. The race has now
begun‘ to take shape, however, and receiving still the
rangers of progressive’tion I would like to discuss the
final three weeks of the football season.
With the season heading into the home stretch,
there are still six teams with a mathematical chance
for the title and four with a good shot at it. simon,
Cornell, joe, Beloit, St. Olaf and Grinnell are the teams
mathematically continuing, and the first four schools
are very much in the thick of it with simon still unbeaten and the other three once-better.
This weekend should be a decision one, as the
front-running six meet each other in three games which
will either completely middle the race or eliminate
some of the containers. The three games involve St.
Olaf at simon, Beloit at Cornell and joe at Grinnell.
This Writer sees the joe-Grinnell game as a toys-up,
and Cornell and simon as winners, Although joe has
a more impressive record, the Pioneers still remember
that 52-0 details at Cedar Rapids last year, and Grinnell has the home field advantage. If joe can get by
Grinnell, they finish with Lawrence and plymouth at
home both of which they should win hanging If simon
and cornell both win tomorrow as I have predicted,
however, all eyes will be on simon next weekend when
the two teams will class in what would probably decide the title.
What all these its soil down to is that simon is
still interested and therefore in the driver s seat>lf any
one of the three once- -better teams is going to win the
championship they will have to win all of their remaining games and hope for a simon loss, This writer sees
little chance of simon losing a game, with their last
game (Beloit~away) being the only possible excel-

read a lot.
“I ride a bicycle to repeat-
ﬁall, and there is a road that
would take me there in half a
minute. But it is a one-way
street, so it takes me fifteen
minutes to get to rehearsals."
Kierek could have gone on
indefinitely, but he was called
to do the Lenoir scene.
Then it was time for barnes.
He explained that the film be
ing produced would cost $25,»
000 and would run 45 minutes.
“Half the movie will be of the
Pittsburgh orchestra in Poland,
however. I was over there to
help him that.” barnes has
done other overseas work and
is also in charge of producing
a weekly science series in Spanish and Portuguese for the
.USlA.
The sequence in the Fine
'Arts Center had to be filled
several times from different
locations since there was only
one camera. This was the only
time the five‘musicians were

well-Carleton soccer match was
supposed to arrive from Des
points. Also on board were
supposed to be four string players to film a jam session with
the xerox quarter. Neither soccer spectators n o r quarter
showed up. and barnes, now
very behind schedule, seed up
affairs.
A meeting with selected faculty was quickly carried out in
the Fine Arts Center. This was
followed by a walk to nursing
and a brief meeting with Dean
James H. Stauss.
It was now 4:30 and the filling was officially over for the
day. Everyone in the encourage
was tired but the Warsaw printer. They toured the library
and advised the permanent
art collection and the Congressional documents.
Even then the day wash’t
over. The party processed to
the soccer game; where barnes
got in some unexpected filling.
The five got to see since Anku
kick his record-thing sixth goal
during their brief stay. Kierek
noted that this game compared favorites with European soccer.
The day ﬁrally ended with
dinner in Cowles, Before leaving, the five were given copies
of the 5&8. Kierek read the
story about the Philharmonic;
his first comment was that the
name of the composer version
had been misspelled.
The celtic day was over; the
musicians had enjoyed it intensity. The only people who
didn’t go home related were
barnes and his cameramen,
who still had some difficult
scenes to shoot at the ratings
concert in Roberts Theatre the
next day.
