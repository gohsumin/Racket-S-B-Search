students to write background papc on all sub-topics
In this manner student interest \\‘Ill be awakened long
before the normal program is presented on our turn

cooperation of the faculty.
1. PURPOSE
The goal of the symposium is to provide the Gl'iii‘
well College student body and faculty. and the
mounting community with a siiiiitilatliisv evaluation
of the democratic pi‘one in this country Stress Will
be placed on how the process won ks and how well
it works. .
Both or these questions are valid once ice config-
union. As our government continues to expand in
.2e and ptnvcr, it cpnrurrcntlv seems to grow more
distant from the individual There is a shopping luck
ct' understanding as to how our democracy functions.
it is our hope that our.symposium can help all this
void ot knowledge But perhaps more important we
must :rv to answer the questions as to how well the
process is functioning. Democracy is ndcr ‘attack from
nu areas. Thc c at as labeled akaliist it come from

is lcrttlnale to have a Program in Practical Political
Education which year'lv provides a varied pl'escntur
tion of practical political Events This program and
the student involvement in it provides zi constant
stimuli which the symposium program will be able
to utilize.
Also. it is important to nolc that in llc [all or
tool. the college sponsored u conference on Latin
American Alia Although we do not plan to strain
tuic the symposium exactly as this conference was
structured. it has provided experience in relating
such a program to the student body, Many of. the

by students, which were cmrcmely successful then
will be used in the symposium Diagram

At that time, also, the State Department was
keeping a careful watch over Chiumc. In the

the position or Minister or Education and Social
Development of the soonstosbe independent
British protectorate oi swaziland.
There is one qualification for membership
in the “power elite” of a new African nation
assisted Chiulne: “identification with the colonial
struggle." As African states finally brandon
their colonial status. the previous requirements
of an Oxford or Harvard degree become “not
all that important.” Personal experience with
colonial publication serve as a royalty oathsins
action to eliminate those ”shipments" that would
“desert their block in a storm.”
One or Mr. Chiume’s iii-st projects upon his
appointment as Minister of Education was to
embark on a ten-fold men use in secondary
school enrollment. He is also interested i increased college opportunities [or the M' uri.
During the California portion oi his tour. Chiui e
hopes to observe “Disneyland and the California
Junior College system.”
Although he expects new insights from the
former. the latter interests him as a means to
broader the base or Malawi citizens with hiohci
education. Operating in an area in which “newest
site is often the matter of invention." Chiumc
feels that the introduction at an appreciated
college experience could prove an important
educational innovation.

the accessories of life (including new bicycles
and translator radios) which seemed very
