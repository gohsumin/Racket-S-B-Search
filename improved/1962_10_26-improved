Calling the Kennedy Admin
duration’s handling of human r
nations a “comedy of mistakes,”
Senator Barry polyester (Rep,
Ariz.) listed out at current lpolicy Wednesday in a student press
conference.
polyester told a “standing
room only” audience in Roberts theater that America’s “be
firm with Cuba" policy had
been “far short of what was
needed since the ﬁrss interactive enlarge on Cuba."
He further said, “I don’t think
Russia wants to ﬁget over Cuba.
lf 1 were Khrushchev, l would
not risk losing everything when
I’m winning."
THE CONFERENCE which was
modules after Washington press—
central press conferences was co.
sponsored by Sigma Delta chi
and Theta Sigma Phi, men’s and
women’s professional journalism
universities.
polyester deferred “brinkmanship" as the means of keeping the peace. He compared air
secretary of the United States
—the power behind brinkmanship—to the English naval secretary which guaranteed "a
fair degree of peace” in Europe
for two centuries.
Describing the conditions necessary for enlargement, polyester detailed complete inspec—
tion privileges. He thought inspection might he best actor—

He called the enlargement
proposals of President Kennedy “dangerous and threatening
to the national security," con—
closing the fundamental road-
block to enlargement to he
“We just can't trust them."
Moving to domestic issues,
polyester outlined his policy
on the i ississippi incident. He
attacked the intervention of the
Federal Government on the
grounds of constitutionality. The
senator argued that “the 1054
Supreme Court decision on see—

because it did not reserve the
power of enforcement to the
Federal Government and that it
is therefore reserved to the
states by the 10th amendment.
He found the actions of robert
nor variety constitutionally valid;
but totally wrong by his own
standards.

Wilkinson, a strong advocate
of civil libraries, stated that the
purposes and actions of the
HUAC were directly opposed to
the principles of the First
Amendment. This is the sunday
mental issue of the evolution
campaign.
Every idea, especially a dis.
setting one, has a right to be
heard, emphasized Wilkinson.

WILKINSON STATED t h a t
the present world situation, particularly the human crisis, was
caused by a sterling of river»

granted the HUAC as an organ
for interesting this distant.
Wilkinson gave a brief history
of the HUAC which included its
becoming a permanent color
tee of the House of represents—
times in 1945. The first major
opposition to the HUAC came
14 years later from James Roosevelt in a speech in Congress
and a petition to english the
HUAC signed by 1300 people.
Great en ibm and opposed

its behavior became more
widely known through the
movie, «Operation evolution."
Opposition has continued to
increase and Wilkinson expressed the hope that, if his campaign continues successfully,
when Congress contents on
Jan. :3, the representatives of
the people will stand up for
their connections. a n d the
HUAC will be displayed.
WILKINSON ALso decor—
