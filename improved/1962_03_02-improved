We support Al Boston as a candidate for the Student

But, despite tale fact that Al is the y alternative

In this case, we feel that the quality of the candidate

And, if it’ ally corporation to Al, we might point ollt
that his quilt nations for office might have been part of
the reason why no one connected him. No one likes to lose.
Al is all extremely capable fellow —— an excellent
speaker and a man with. we think, a practical philosophy
of student government. He has good idea and the qualities
of leadership necessary to see them carried to the students
of Glinnell. Again, we support Al Boston,

about the fact that there will be
not to be passed over lighter.
“Don Perlimplin" presents
many interesting and exciting
problems both to the internet—
her and the audience. Many of
the problems arise from the
fact that the play is more of
a multiwoiced poem than it
is a clearly defined drama.
The effect and power that the
play attacks come more from its
visit surgery and the sheer
beauty of its words than from
the inclusion of the usual dramatic functions—character, plot,
and action, it is constructed with
the sort of precision and economy that is more often asomatr

forms.
The problem for the actor be.

one of abandoning preconcepr

operate on its own grounds. in

were successfully solved.
Miss Petersllie's play presents
‘other‘ problems. She has written
a brunette which might be securely critical if judges as a
drama taken, however, as the
dramatic presentation of simple
experience—2i moment searched
from time and held for examination—it can hold a good deal
.of charm. The play has little or
no action. The production of it
must therefore rest on shortly
defined and sunﬁcountry detailed characterization.
It is the simple story or two
particular people who are
thrown into a particular cir—
substance. To ask more of the
script would be a mistake,
especially since it proceeds so
well in its own right.
“The Stronger” seems to be
the least praiseworthy of the
plays which were chosen for
production. Although it is an in.
existing piece for the student
of Strindberg and a worth—while
exercise for the actor. the tale
it has to tell is an old one and
its style is a bit staff for modern
addresses.
