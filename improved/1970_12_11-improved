VOL. LXXIX
Faculty Ends PE Requirement By 51-32 Vote
NO. 7
By John Pepper
and Tim judges
Monday’s vote to english the
Physical Education requirement for graduation demonstrated to the satisfaction of
most that the woodworkaround
here is at least as full ofAbolitionists as of the various relationships which the heritage
wisdom of campus politics
implies.
The vote reserved the faculty
vote of two weeks previous to
maintain the requirement in a
designed form. That meeting
was hourly attended, in part
because many liberal faculty
members hadassumedthatthe
requirement wouldbeabolishr
ed as a matter of course and
logic pursuant to the JonesClotfelter academic reforms.
Hence, they didn‘t bother to
show up, and the requirement
was retained by a 36-31 vote.
Two weeks of intensive lobbyr
ing followed, with the result
that a few votes changed and
about twenty abolitionists were moved toattend, pushing the
evolution motion to a 51-32
victory.
It was necessary for the rec
consideration of the vote that
one person who had originally
voted with the majority pro
pose anewvote. Charles Clear
ver got up and spoke in this
role, saying that he had chi
angel his mind in the matter.
He said that his original vote
had been a reaction against
what he turned“Puritanism"
which candidates mind at the
expense of body. He said that
his mind had been changed
because he felt all good things
need not be registered with the
threat of witholding the B.A.
A brief debate followed, with
sporadic gathering-s of ”quest
tion" from the delivery of the
DECEMBER 11, I970
auditorium. Debate behaviour
later previous discussion,
with Phillip mint-new saying
that the retention of this single
requirement would make a
society of the work the faculty had done on academicreform. Coach deutsch said that
the PE Department did not
want sympathy votes, and that
the issue must be decided on
its series alone. But he also
added that it implied “affairs
news", in sports at least, to
lose and then demand another
game “just to see if you can’t
win this time."
Nonetheless, the vote was
taken (by secret balloon, no
less) and the proposal to english was carried by theaforementioned margin.
Henceforth, no student will
be denied a diploma due to
his non— completion of the Phys
sicalrEducation requirement,
seniors included. TWO hours of
credit will be, given to those
who complete the syllabus of
the reported requirement
passed at the previous meeting.
Perhaps the most significant
segment of the meeting was
President suggest‘s address
to the faculty, which will probably have wide rcpercusr
signs.
discrimination, he said, is
not about to be an acrobat
the-board phenomenon. The
administration must attempt
to control the ﬂow of students
from previously‘ required ar
was into others. This will be
done by the advisory system
and by close control of class
sizes. This means, among
other things, that students
must expect to find more and
earlier closing-out of class
sections.
Given the priority system of
putting seniors and motors in
GRINNE LL, IOWA 501 12
to courses before lower classics, etc., we can probably
expect increased freshman
dissatisfaction, unless more
and better freshman courses
are designed. suggest did not
mention this problem: and it
probably will be the responsibility of the Freshman Year
Committee, which is now being formed. As the semester's
debate draws to a else, the
problems ofamdemicreform,
far from being settled, have
really scarcely begun.
loewi sources SGA 'I'oWithhold
Funds To Victims In Pakistan
by Don Dagenuis
On Thursday, Dec. 3. the Senate once again gathered token
they for one of those dinner
meetings to discuss the pressing issues of the day over
those delicious SAGA military
delivers. The only major action was to designers the proceeds from tonight's SAGA
fast to the Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund.
The Senate had earlier occur
did, in Andy Loewi’sequence,
to give the proceeds to the
Pakistan Relief Fund. Under
pressure from Loewi, how—
ever, they changed their
minds. The incident brought
to question the ability of the
Senate to make intelligent decisions in the absence of Mr.
Loewi, or, perhaps, whether
Mr. Loewi feels the Senate
can make rational decisions
in his absence.
Most SGA activity since that
time has been behind the scenes: the selection of sublime
matters for the Student Services committee (it's always
good to increase the threads
crazy whenever possible), and
selection of student members
for the Freshman Year com‘
little, which will determine
the nature of the Freshman
Tutorial program.
The Housing Committee has
been about the onlyactivearm
of the bureaucracy lately. Chairman pic MacDowell re»
ports that the committee has
been discussing the possibilities of (I) having the room
draw before House President
elections, then havingthe treatments elected by individual
forms; (2) making liable and
Smith angeles into blocks of
rooms which could be drawn
by groups of students; (3) 31.
losing seniors to live offcampus, and (4) expanding the
number ofco-ed forms, including forms bored by rooms
rather than by ﬂoops. The re
suits of the recently districts
ted questionnaire are now being regulated by MacDowell at
night, into the weehours often
morning. He hopes to complete
the job before Christmas br'
eat. Little action has been
taken by the committee in the
way of official recommended
tions. Such activity will probably wait until next semester.
Other than that, SGA, like
everyone else these days, is
carrying about suchminiscule
matters as last-minute papers
and final examinations. It
seems that even political 3C,
tickets are receiving that the
most important priority is the
small matter of making your
grades.

And John In Music, Philosophy

”It is not just that George has
surprised all the individual
disks issued to date by Paul,
John and final. Both music—
ally and philosophically, he
has produced one of the outside rock albums in years."
(Time, Nov. 30) This is quite
a statement, but what is more
amazing is that is true] George Harrison‘s new triple 31,

George sat recently within the

one expected that George had

(The events that follow, are
true, and only the names have
been changed to protect the

I was sitting in my room last
Friday, meditation as to the
situation in the world today.
when I decided to go'on over
to the post office and pick up
my copy of the charles and

North Campus, event past an
elm tree that was burning but
specially was not being consumer. I thought that this was
somewhat strange, but I married on to the p.o. When I get
there, I found install the mailboxes except mine were
cleared with what appeared
to be lamb’s blood. I again
found this strange. I then one
eyed my mailing and found a
piece of division judge and a
copy of the S and B. Thepaper
seemed to be growing like a
coal from great heat, yet I
was able to hold onto it without being turned. As I headed
up the states, Inoticeda receipt that had fallen on the
floor, a receipt that was for
thirty pieces of silver paid to
someone named “knock Snokey".
After reading the paper, I
realized that I was, in a sit
nation that required a little
help from my friends. 501
called together 12 of my f-r’
sends for dinner that night,
and we talked about what was
happening to me.Theyadvised
me to “hang loose".
The next morning I discovered that my mother had are
river unexpectedly during the
night. I also had a headline
that was like a weight bearing
down on my head. Igota phone
call from a few of the ROTC
cadets, who assisted that I
come over and play cards or
shoot dice or something. As
I was preparing to leave, I
noticed that the sky was getting very dark, and stores,
so I took along an umbrella.
Before I left, I wrote this
column so I worlds't forget
about it and have to have one
of my friends write it for me.
I did want to add one more
thing - I am looking forward
to next semester when I hope
to rise again to new journalistic heights.

that have been circulation
about campus recently,
means dildo Walker and
Joseph Wall had an identical reaction: ”no comment.”
Dean Wall explained that

though faculty members

Dean Walker pointed out
that five faculty members

First of all, I fail to see how
these students, with therapist
thirteenrweek experience of

have given it a fair trial and
found it wanting. The corresponding project off lé-crew
did independent on death and
humanity somehow does not
strike me as a liable alternative to the type of education
which Grinnell is offering.
Few reasons for the proposed radical change are offered. romantic phrases like "a
more accurate representation
of society based upon mutual
dependence between students"
prove little more than therapy
that the writers are certainly
not resident in using their irrelevant education to get across a radical point. I see
little certification for the pros

In our society, there are al»
narrative directions one can
choose for his life to take. One
of those is getting an education by going to a small libero

choice these students have
made; if it does not fit their
plans, then i would suggest
that the college environment
is not where they belong.
At the risk of standing like
a died-inrwool conservative,
it seems to me that the present Grinnell education can be
a relevant learning experience
if the student himself wishes
to make it that. These freshmen, Iposit, area't willing to
meet it holiday. In fact, they
really haven't had time to try
it at all.
Perhaps the most increase

that if the college were not

The article could perhaps be

To the Editor:
I would like to take this op.

The IM chairman’s duties
concerning volleyball are to
1), see that the netsareput up
on time 2), supply the volleyballs 3), be sure that cards to
record the results of the
games are available. Either
Craig Gordon, or Dick Pipe,
or both were negligent in all
three of the above duties to
some degree. We feel that the

They have attached that
agreement, and if they do not

they should design from the
job of IM Chairman, andallow

So what’s all thismean? That
our older and wider teachers
are more physically fit than
we are? i don’t think so. The
cross come out for the fun of
playing, not just to win games.
There seems to be something
packing in the hallrbased syS‘
tel of intramural competition
when there are as many for
units as this year's volleyball
season has seen. Only three
calls were able to complete
the entire season without a
perfect.
There has been some talk {1*
rating around the elite IM circles about conducting an ex
horizontal interestgroup league for basketball. What this
means is that the hall teams
would be scrapped and any
group of 6* 10 guys could organize their own independent
team. This would allow for
such teams as Saga Cowles,
the Clark press, Black stud-
The partners from UNI gathered the Grinnell Aqua‘cocks
as they took home the team
trophy at the First Annual
Pioneer delays. They (UNI)
proved to be too deep in capable swingers, in that print
well took first place in five of
the nine delays and did notion
the meet.
The final parties were UN!
58, tranny 52, C06 14, works
2. Grinnell winners were in
the 400 yd. wesley delays(grammar, C.D. Meyer, Dale,
and collins); the 180 yd. sprint
relay, (Ward, Swacky, and
collins); the Diving, (control,
and Burton); the 300 yd.
Breast-stroke relay, (Mark
Williams, Thomas millions,
and C.D. Meyer); and the 400
yd. free relay, (Mike sales,
Swacky, Ward, and collins).
The meet was not all draw,
as Grinnell introduced some
new exists to its Grinnell try-
ends, History favors, Cleveland Hall breaks, etc. Instead
of playing with the guys you
happen to live with, you could
play with the guys you do
things with, the guys you would
like to get out on the baskets
ball court and jan with. Any
hall could still organized team
if it liked, but there would be
more freedom, which is what
everybody seems toward these
days.
I think this is basically a
sound idea. Sure, itwouldpresent lots of problems, like
some teams are going to be a
lot more skillful and comes»
active than others, and the tier
rehabilitation of power is going to necessarily a lot more
work organizing the sport; but
the IM Directors seem willing
to give it a which. It may just
be the best thing that has hit
Grinnell intramurals since the
days of the Smith Machine.

went to Loose and watched the
football game on the tube.

But Still Has Hopes
It's getting so thateither this
writer should stop making
predictions, or Grinnell‘s
teams should stop pussyfooting around and start living up
to their potential. My record
as a prophet has now gone to
0’3 (1 don‘t think i could beat
the Bear) since the Grinnell
disorders at Millikin University and at Central. Ian-l told
that l underestimated the Milr
login five (that‘s what happens
when one operates without an
effective sporting staff). indeed, now I'm told that Grinnell simply is not in the same
class as Millikin and that,
were the Millikinites in the
Midwest Conference, lheyWOr
old dominant year after year.
It is somewhat qualifying to
know that one has been crushr
ed by class.
The Central game was an—
other matter. Perhaps the via
offers were just ”down”from
their destination by Millikin.
At any rate, even the players
admit they had a bad night (as
was born out by the box scor
res: Grinnell had nobody scoring in double figures, while
Central had three people sci—
ring 20 or more),andthatthey
should have won. Unfortun‘
lately, even losses that should
have been wins go down in the
record book as losses.
The next event on the loops
stars' itinerary is the Holiday
Tournament at Colorado. As T
said last week, the only come
petition here, aside fromaltirude, is Knox. Thus, I shall
stick my neck out one more
time and renew my prediction
of a Grinnell victory. The
Pioneers should knock Knox
for the championship.
In suite of the disorders at
Millikin and Central, thereare
several factors which justify
my continued faith in the plays
era of Grinnell. Among these
are “grant" grant, Greg
"the neck" decimal,clinton
“Super—Q" Phea. and
” “ batteries. Th—
are is no doubt thatGrinnell’s
performance against Millikin
was impaired by the absence
of batteries, out with the
SAGA flu, and of Fhea, who
was unable to attend another
of early practices. Both were
back for the game against
Central and performed holiday, with Super-Q finding up
as one of the high showers for
Grinnell. As they play more,
they will improve consider”
able and be of invaluable service to the Pioneers. The
grant and Beclcman were high
showers for Grinnell against
Millikin with 25 and reprints,
respectively, and both came
back against Central to give
strong performances despite
of the 83* 50 loss. Grinnell can
still win it all, if they start
playing the way they should.
