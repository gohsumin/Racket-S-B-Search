SNC C Gets NSA Support
The Student consistent coordination Committee is an organization of Southern student}
devoted to the elimination of all forms of racial
discrimination. SNCC (pronounced “snic") pursuit this goal through non—violent but direct
action. its primary activities have been in the
area of votes registration, where the group has
done containing and educational work, and, when
necessary, has organized concentrations. sncc
also works against discrimination in educated ,
job opportunities, the equal use of public fncili.
ties, and all of the other areas which the noble
and numerous white man has decided are not
to be shared with anyone but his fellow
W.A.S.P,’s (White AnglerSaxon Protestants).
The United States National Student estonia—
tion has for a long time recognized a common
interest with SNCC. The basic policies of USNSA,
set by the National Student Congress during the
summer of each year, have consistently taken
a firm stand in the area of civil rights, including
full support both of the goals and of the consistent means of SNCC. USNSA has been further
concerned with this particular organization because the people involved are students. SNCC
is a student-run, student-stuffed, and students
finances organization. This sets it apart from
many of the civil rights groups now working in
the South, and this peculiar make-up demands
the careful attention of the student community.
USNSA has not had the funds to support
SNCC necessarily, but it has left its full
weight in policy statements, and organizational
assistance wherever possible. The 1963 National
Student Congress, attended by Jim harrison,
dance Opperman, Dan Friedlander, and me, vol:ed renewal support for SNCC, and then passed
a special resolution on the situation in americas,
Georgia, where on August a; of this year three

metro) were arrested while leading a helpful
demonstration. They were better repeatedly by

By Nancy McCannon
police, failed, charged with “excitement to intersection” a a crime which carries the death
penalty in Georgia a and are being held in
lies of $360,000 peace bond until the grand jury
can meet some time in October.
This incident is not rare one. SNCC workers have been better, j led, and thrown out of
towns, dedicated, threatened, and last spring a
young metro man, Jimmy Travis, was suffered
in Mississippi while working on s chi voteiregistration program.
Life is not pleasant for the 150 or so young
men and women who make up the full-time staff
of SNCC. They are paid about $10 a week for
consistency, and usually have to find a part»time
job in order to eat. Transportation is as often as
not by foot or by male. violence and mortality
are constantly waiting if they push too far. Progress is heartbreakingly slow. Yet these young
men and women remain at work because they
share a common goal _ a goal which most of
us will freely agree with, fat and happy here in
Iowa where such ideas are not very dangerous.
SNCC’s biggest problem is a lack of funds.
The Freedom fingers who song in A,R.H. last
spring were on n tour trying to raise funds for
SNCC. The organization is very largely dependent on contributions from computer across the
country, but these computer have not in the
past been overwhelmingly respective. At least
Grinnell is safely with the majority in this score.
it would be a dark good idea if someone
actually tried to run a fund-raising campaign for
mac around here, At Grinnell I mean — here.
We probably would not lose any money for
SNcc, we might optimistically raise a nickel
or two, and it would be interesting to See if the
noble principles so freely endorsed by all pro.
perry-liberallyzeducated students go far enough
below their skin to reach their pocketbooks.

Arts Exam land Curriculum sims
up the results of the Encampa
ment in general. But villas were
the specific problems, ideas, in.
formation and suggestions discussed?
The Committee on the AMA
Exam and Curriculum, headed
by Jack Spence, covered three
main topics during its two days
of meetings—the JLA Exam, the
trading system. and the nu.
families and Historical Studies
program. The following arc cxcerpts from a report issued by
this committee obtaining its dis.
session.
“We initiated this discussion
by trying to achieve a clear
description of the theoretical
purposes and benefits of the
exam. The theory underlying
the idea of a Junior Liberal
Arts Exam holds that if there
is such a concept as a Liberal ,
Arts Education and this is a
circumscribalile, finite thing,
then there should be a testing
instrument which can be used
to Show if a student has
achieved excellence in this
education.
“Assuming the theory is invisible, it clearly indicates that
one 'purpose of the exam is to
measure a student’s mystery of
a Liberal Arts Education. How»
ever, we felt that this test and
the preparation for it also
should serve an educational
function, It should give the std—
sent a chance to synthesize his
knowledge, to recognize and
know methods and theories
which are useful in many disciplines, and to find similarities
and differences between disciplines.
'T‘either, it should give the
student an opportunity to take
the responsibility of independ—
entry studying a broad topic. In
the future when the exam bet
comes a more reliable listings
instrument, it is hoped that its
still be able to indicate bridge-
time broad proposed and additions goals are lbeset with problems

“If featuring the essence
and the mobility of a Liberal
Arts Education is the ideal,
all concerned with the exam
should realize that this is impossible.
there are certain concepts and
,methods which a literally educated student should know and
be tested on his ability to

“of course, another problem
involved the type of exact
that should be given. Several
different types were discussed, including the following:
a) A problem type exam
which would require the student to analyze the validity of

theory . . . b) A take-home
