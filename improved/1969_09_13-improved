During the first two weeks of the new semester, two students

was dealing in illegal drugs “voluntarily withdrew" brown the
college at the request of the administration. .
who means displayed poor judgment in their handling or the
ﬁrss two incidents. According to the Student Handbook, the col<
legs recognized “the serious possibility oi damage to the mental
and physical health of (drug) users” By disciplinary students who
visit the Health center with problems sterling from the use or
drugs, the means are discouraging students from seeking medical
attention when their lives may depend upon it.
In the case of the student who took an overcome of messaging,
undefined fellow-students —- rather than seeking immediate medical
attention — administered drugs that seriously endangered the students life, presumably because they shared disciplinary reserves
lions, it should be obvious to the means that disciplinary handling
ol medical problems will only increase the rangers of drug in-
,agreement at Grinnell.
Although professional ethics may require that the details of
rsonal cases handled by the means remain Confidential, the
rely surrounding the promotion incidents is independence. All
engineers of the College community are entitled to know when,
and why, the means discipline students. The college has recognized
similar rights in the past by requiring the disclosure of judicial
council proceedings
in the case of the student dealing In messaging, the means lib
decided better judgment. A student who is so instantly indiscrere
that the means are aware of his drug involvement is a danger not
only to himself, but to the entire community, and it is perhaps
best for all concerned that he withdrew from the college.
The mistakes made during the past two weeks point out the
urgent need for the creation of an adequate drug education program at Grinnell. Such a program will be northwest if it consists
ol nothing more than the governing propaganda plans previously
used to share students away from drugs,
Grindeil needs a drug education program that forestry approaches the psychological, psychological, social, and legal consequences of instrumentation with drugs. It must examine not only
the rangers of drugs, but also their positive potential.
A statement clarllying the college drug policy is expected from
the President next week. He can no longer ignore the many dell«
Gate questions integral to the solution of the drug problem,
Is the college reporting to an in logo parental policy in its
handling of drug cases? Will continued disciplinary actions dis<
courage students from seeking needed medical care? is the drug
policy consistent with other college regulations oi student conduct?
These are only a few of the difficult questions that call for lm<
message answers,
Poor judgment in the past has participated the current drug
problem at Grinnell. Necessity demands a realistic reappraisal of

other American soldiers are
being used around the world to

to protect the economic interests oi the giant corporations

I refuse to be infected into

Off-Campus students seek says option; Vote probably
By MOLLY MCGUIRE
l Off-campus seniors may be
able to forest their board fees
this year, thus giving up their
"privilege" to eat SAGA food
in the dining calls, If an allItudent references proposed
Tuesday by the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) indicates support for the measure.
The references will determine
it the majority of the student
body is willing to pay a flight
increase in board fees that
would enable their offrcampus
peers to say goodbye to SAGA
and find for themselvesi
The recent action by the SAC
is only the latest in a series of
measures taken to explore the
possibilities of giving students
options to the present policy of
mandatory board fees. At the
present time, all students must
pay for board except married
students and those originally
mm the city of Grinnell.
Last spring, alter complaints
by future off-campus seniors
and in light of the response to
the SAGA committee’s questionnaire (where students indicated a desire to be able to
forest the blanket board fee),
the SAC issued a list of suggestions to the administration,
asking them to find specific information about various possible options. About a month
later, on May la, the committee issued a recommendation
to President suggest for a temporary plan for the tall games—
her: they asked that “students
not in college housing be given
the option of not paying the
board fee, and thus not eating
in the campus dining hall."
this proposal was for the loss—
70 school year only, until a
more satisfactory plan could be
worked out, The committee
managed that there “may be
some problems in the implementation of the recommendation. ”
Problems there were. Because of the late date of the
suggestion and the illness of
one of the key personnel involved, nothing was done about
answering nr improving the
proposal until this 1811. Meanwhile, about seven offrcampus
seniors decided to refuse to pay
their board fees at registration,
hoping to put pressure on the
administration to do something
immediately about the recommendation. After being sent to
talk to six different adminisr
station officials, the students
were given an estimated to
pay their board fees by Mona ,
day, Sept 8th, or they would
not be considered students at
the college. (All have paid;
students they still are.) They
were also told that the means
were currently considering the
recommendation.
Considering it they were. On
September 5, following official
procedure, President suggest
sent Professor Edgar collins,
chairman of the SAC, a response to the suggestion of last
spring. in it he stated that he
saw problems in the implementation of the request, and that
he had asked the means to take
certain measures to “begin the
necessary analyses that would
provide us with descriptions of
liable options for long- range
food service arrangements for
all students. ”
suggest cited the possibility
of a rise in board charges next
semester and thereafter for
those focused to make up for
those executed from paying
board (the fewer students paying, the higher the individual
board cost will be), and the
possible need of a checking
system In the dining calls, He
felt that because of these possibilities, every student should
be informed and be able to
have a say in the issue.

One of suggest's requests to

advantage of the option now
under consideration, so that the
business office and the SAGA
business manager could fight¢
out the difference this would

thus compute the possible hisé

in accordance with this, Data

names to a statement saying
that, if they had the chance
they would choose to forest that;

tion went into effect they
would be required their board

that they had already (presumably) water detected.
With some 20 students (mar.
signed the list later)‘ not paying board, the fees per student
would go up about $5.00 a set
master, it was reported at the
SAC meeting. The administration would absorb the cost this
semester, but since next semester the board fees of those
not focused would be affected,
the committee believed the|
students should be able to have
a say in themes the option it
institutes or not. The matter
of checking procedures in the
dining calls might also be u
problem that would affect the
rest of the students, who might
be asked to show an ldenilﬁrv

“What a Drag”
‘cross Views Orientation
by Edward device
Having known eight hours to get to Grinnell, I had hoped to
ﬁnd a rather dynamic New student Days program. Alas, whats
drugs I could [ind no receiving characteristics. The faculty-student colieehour on opening day was not unlike that opportunity
occurrence in college life. the mixer.
The next two days contained some of the more horrible experiences in my young like. Most or my time was spent either standing in lines or listening to very standard historic on such topics
as race and drugs. The college seems to think that ireshmen come
to the campus innocent and spyware. So the people running New
student Days have medicare speakers address the students, as
coming that this' will satisfy the “press”.
But the biggest crime committed by New student Days is that
it does not correctly device like at Grinnell. Lite is not ordered
and directed on this campus, yet time during New Student Days
is taken up by scheduled activities. As one sophomore pointed out,
some ireshmen are scared to go to the john because that activity
Is not on the New Student Days calendar.
The solutions to these problems are not simple. One answer
might be the midsummer orientation many colleges have initiated.
If this is not possible, at least the high schoolrlllte atmosphere
which now services New Student Days should be eliminated
'Presently the only way for a treshman to benefit from New Stu-
sent Days is to throw away the New Student Days calendar.

with the student attendance

“This means very little. it is
up for discussion, amendment,

followed a discussion or ROTC

The president continued:
“It is my own belief, which’i
