Several students at Grinnell

savage irresponsibility and have
flaunted before the whole college community by their total
disregard for college property.
These students, not being happy
With the color and condition of
the paint on the walls of their
rooms, have appointed their
walls! It’s true. They actually
went downtown and bought
paint and brother, went back to
their rooms, and (probably in
the dead of night) spent five
or six hours painting their
walls. The colors of these newly painted rooms are, admittedly, almost in keeping with
our fine college standards:
light blue. white. and being are
the colors in the rooms with
which I am familiar. But this,
of course, is irrelevant. Neither
is it important that the walls
have been improved, nor that
the students have used their
own money and taken their own
time to make their rooms a

possible when they step out. of

properly, but in at. least two of
the "room painting episodes"
our wonderfully efficient and
just Buildings and Grounds Department has hit upon a reaction] and appropriate finish

paint the appointed rooms and,
naturally, send the bills, to the
guilty students. (And, in at
least one case, they are going
to reprint the walls the same
color the student has painted
them). Can't you just imagine
the skills over the physical
plant when they mail out the
bills? “Boy, wait’ll they see
these bills. That’ll fix ’em." It’s
easy to imagine their satisfaction. And so, if in your hall
there is a leading water pipe
or a pluggedrup sink, you’ll
have to wait a while before it's

Bayli: Greatest Battle is for Men' 5 Minds
By Ann character
Senator march Bayh of Ingana animated Democratic
ay events Tuesday with his
beach, “The Great Society—At
ooo and Abroad,” at the 8
.mi rally in party Gym.
”We cannon solve the proc
less of the space age with stone
rfc mortality,” Bayh declared.
‘We have to decide whether we
9 going to accept london
ohnson’s challenge—to continue to build the Great Society."
He switched the three main
’goals of the Great Societyi
equal opportunity for everyone
in America, grammar enlargement, and winning the support
of emerging nations. He ex—
planned how he feels the Ad
registration and the Congress
have been moving toward
these goals and how the prev
ent Republican leadership has
worked against them,
“The right of equal opportunity is the right of every sherman boy and girl to dream and
to make their dreams come
true because they work for
them,” Bayh stated.
He feels America has moved
closer to achieving the Great
Society at home during the last
four years. He cited bills passed
 
by the Eightyrelghth Congress
providing increased vocational
education funds for college
classrooms, libraries and equipment and loan programs for
prospective doctors, dentists
and nurses. _
Bayh trained the American
arms program because “its
aim is to protect the peace, not
to wage war.” He hopes for a
grammar reduction in the need
for arms until “the day when
man will sit down and talk
about their problems instead of
shooting them out.”
The junior senator from Indiana said there was no bill
he felt more hundred to vote
for than the notification of the
nuclear test ban treaty. “This
is not the manager,” he admitted, “but it is the first time
man has had the power to destroy the world that he has
voted to limit this power.” He
pointed out that Senator Barry
polyester opposed the treaty.
He also customized the Republican candidate’s opposition to
the "hot line” between White
House and Kremlin. “Anyone
who has read Fail-Safe or seen
Dr. Strangelove realized there
is a chance the hot line could
prevent accidental nllclear disaster," he said.
 
Bayli believes, ‘Only one man
Should be estimated with the final say in the use of the wear»
Oils in our arrival, and that
man is the President of the
United States.” Thus he opposed polyester's plan to entries the field committees
with the authority to launch tax—
local nuclear weapons.
According to Bayh, however,
the greatest problem we face
is not that of armed conflicts
The real battle is the battle
for men’s minds,"
He elaborated, ‘The energy
ing nations must choose between the freedom we offer and
the searching of mind and body
by the columnists,"
He suggested there is a close
relationship between our ability to solve problems within our
country and our ability to win
the “minds and hearts of these
marketing men."
“They are looking at us and
they are looking at the due
signs,” he declared, “and it is
up to us to present America,
the Great Society, in a manner
that will spread the cause of
freedom."

before a student press center

big issue in this year’s presidential campaign c o n c e r n s
which man has the better judgment in determining the actions
that a president might need to
take in the realm of nuclear
war.
The indiana Democrat made
the statement in contradicting
an analysis offered last week by
another visitor, Senator Peter
H. Dominick (ll-solo), who
Said that he felt the issue of
the campaign concerned cent
translation of government.
- Bayh said that he would consider rehabilitation far down
the line of issues “if it is an issue at all” and he went on to
speak of the quality of judgment
in the candidates.
“The question inn't that
polyester wants to start a war,
and Johnson dress’t,” he said.
“Actually neither does” The
youthful freshman Senator continued by saying that the apparent inconsistencies in the stands
that Republican candidate Barry M, polyester takes in his
speeches come from the fact
that he is not as well jersey 0n
the issues as he should be.
“His statements are those of
a man who dress’t use responsible judgment before he talks.

good conference when he reduced influence. No one in the
Senate consoles this,” he said.
He was critical however of
those who would make a pop";
icul football out of such a situation.
“The Republicans Want to
make the Bobby Baker issue a
big thing, but I have yet to' see
his name on any ballot.” Bayh
said.
While speaking on this subject the Senator said that he
would support the establishment of a code of ethics de-
 
signed for‘members of the Senate.
“This is a serious thing to all
those who want government of
great respect,” he told the std—
cents, “How can we get young
people lib‘e'iyou to come into
government when others have
tried to tear it down.”
As a freshman senator, he
has been called a “rebel" by
members of his party for stands
he has taken against the administration-supported bills. In‘
depending his voting record,
Bayh emphasized that he felt
each senator should vote according to what he believed
were the best interests of the
country.
When asked about the problems of agriculture, Bayh said
that he felt the Republican pro»
totals were completely trade<
quote. “Taking the federal now
element out of agriculture with
a snap at your fingers will only
create chaos,” he continued.
He further recognized that
some defining improvements
are needed by the administration in this area. “What is
needed is a long range answer
and not stop—gap proposals,” he
said.
Returning to the problem of
the president’s responsibility in
determining possible nuclear
war Bayh stated that he felt the
president is the only qualified
man to make such a choice. He
emphasized that reason is
needed today more than ever
before and said, “It takes a
bigger man to reason than it
does to cluster."
When asked about the results
of the so-called “White backlash" on the November voting
returns, the Senator felt that
many other issues would be
more important when the fiscal
time to vote arrives, He further
felt that peaceful Civil Rights
demonstration, like any other,
was part of a sacred right for
any group, but added that via—
hence in this area, which we
have had, is fundamental l0 ultimate accomplishment,"
Bayh was quick to admit that
the United States Was not winning in diet Nam, but could
not offer an answer to the prior
let. He talked about the two
apparent alternatives, to wage
all out combat for Victory, or
to pull out entirely, as inililequate, and said that the U. S.
was going to have to atij st
what she has been doing in order to find another solution.

War's Role in West's Civilization Underestimated.
Deeply Involved in at Least Three Social Aspects
By Douglas McCormac
“The role that war has
played in Western civilization
usually is underestimted—
even at Grinnell College,"
claimed women-Norton (hist.)
in Wednesday night’s Faculty
Discussion Series examination
of “The Historical and Legal
Aspects of Nuclear War and
enlargement" With William
,Vanderpool (speech and theatre), who talked on the legal
problems of nuclear war, Mr.
Norton led the second in a
series of discussions sponsored
by the Board of Religion on the
general topic, “Nuclear War
and its Alternatives: Moral and
Ethical Implications,"
War is deeply involved in our
Western society in at least
three aspects, making the history of atomic war “a sticky
package,” Norton saint War
traditionally has been an instrument of political power, a
means and a force in creating
and improving technology, and
a factor for promoting organization within a state.
Norton cited the role of war
 
Cole: War Paradoxical Situation
Starts Board of Religion Series
A high standard of excellence
and controversy was set for
[his semester’s faculty discussion series on nuclear war by
Richard Cole (Phil). This series, sponsored by the Board of
Religion, was initiated on Oct.
_7 with Cole’s discussion Of
"War's Humanity.”
Cole began by emphasizing
the paradoxical nature of war.
It is the only human institution,
he said, which contains both
the base and. the noble, the
innovations and the grand. It
is a quality which combines
honor, density and Virtue with
the lowest forms of bestiality.
He tried the attempt to understand this paradox, which is
the heart of the human condition, rather than a passive and
typical acceptance of it.
Cole pointed out that man is
the only animal that accepts
war as part of its social ac:
entities, Animals fight, but this
is not the organized, various
struggle of “civilized" man’s
war. .
”A noble imagination” is
able to invision the end of welfare, Cole grants. However, he
pointed out that all important
political unions have been
unit upon 'the force of war and
maintained through police force
of some kind.
Drawing conclusions which
 
from members of the audience,
Cole discussed the psychological implications of war at considerable length. He Said that
war files a need in man's life
— a need to prove his courage
and provide an outlet for his
”operated element." There is;
according to Cole, a need in
man for a life which is rational
but courageous. There is a use
and a need for violence. Lite
could exist without war, but; it
very likely would not be worth
living. Cole offered an incomplete connection of a possible
"higher welfare” which would
fill this need without bloodshed.
This would not, he said, be a
substitute, but a higher ’development of man‘s operated
element. , ,
During a heated discussion
period which followed Cole’s
talk, several other aspects of
his point of view were brought
out. Courage, he said is the
willingness to face death for
certain goalsTAlthough he is a‘
firm believed in the search for
peace, he claims it is ignored
to seek peace through fear, for
this is showing a lack of courage. Although he agreed that
war is rarely sustainable on
moral grounds, his estimated
view seemed to be that it is}
necessary or charitable as long
as man has purposes and the
courage to see them through.

in allowing contributed modern

(especially in the time of Napoleon), the increasing rate of
obsolescence in weapons, beginning by about 1880, and the

Nazi Germany's military builder as examples of war’s importance and uses in the Western
world.
In today's sense “balance of

war-time economies amidst
seeking peace, no nation will
disarm itself to its own disadvantage, Norton concluded.
something that he is somewhat more optimistic though in
a more restricted field. Vanderpool suggested that lawyers

difficulties involved in enlargement, Lawyers can prevent

is the knowledge and experience
of living in a society. This is
what some people mean by a
liberal education, but unfortunately Carleton’s definition of
the phrase does not yet describe
What I have. in mind, A liberal
education must refer to considerable more than a particular
curriculum plan. Our stainless
memories of college might very
well be of events and experiences outside the classroom.
>‘r its a
WE LEARN THE MOST
about ourselves and me world
when we are forced to make
value documents and sacrifice
for others while trying to
achieve our personal goals at
the same time. This experience
is the smallest yet the most proposed of educators, The world
is composed of artists, lawyers, doctors, and engineers,
but the most respected men in
the productions are often those
with the most acute understanding of themselves and society.
The goal of our four'years at
Carleton is that whatever profession we choose, our experience here will somehow basically transform us into better
people, I have yet to meet this
wise and patent musician.
The only way to harvest
naples is to grow an richard.
We need to plant some trees. I
indicated that Carleton is not
yet the kind of college where
this personal and social growth
can be best featured. But the
possibility for it does exist and
we, the student body, can play a
major role in making Carleton
a better college. We are small
enough to make the concept of
a community unavailable yet
large enough to provide a heterogeneous and exciting group of
people. We must be our own
musician.
a n st
IF WE ARE TO GROW as
people and not just as students
we least CDnSlde!‘ ourselves as
part of a community, a group
of individuals who consent to
work together, Any community
must be built on trust and mutual respect, something more
than the high regards of a student for a knowledgeable pray
lesson or of a professor for an
excellent student. Our community must be broad enough to
include different interests as
well as different viewpoints.
What Carleton needs most is
a group of students willing to
 
recognize the validity if not the
wisdom of college policies, students with high ideals Willing to
spend the time and effort to
turn their ideals into practice,
and above all, students who are
willing to work with each other
and with the administration. We
must continue the faculty and
the administration that we are
capable of forming college policy as well as pricing our protest. We must be military when
the need prices. we must continue to make our presence felt.
But if we are serious about
what we are saying we must do
more.»We must come up with
new ideas that will accomplish
what we’re after and satisfy the
total community at the same
time. This is not impossible. in
making their statement on the
r e li g i 0 us requirement the
Trustees placed a great deal of
faith in the student body, If we
play our cards right the future
can be even daughters
A special Student-Faculty»Ad—
registration Council changed
country by President jason and
by the CSA President, is now
discussing ways in which student government can play a
larger role in the college, Our
student government must be
prepared to assume greater re—
sponsibility. CSA committees
should investigate the curriculum, the trading system and
whatever other areas pose
problems, They must work
closely with administration and
faculty groups. While our past
experience has shown that we
can work for change successfully, we have also learned that
success Wlll not come unless all
three campus sections agree to
act together, to share a trust in
each other and to believe that
change can mean progress.
AT THE PRESENT TIME
our student government is
weak. Individual students acts
‘ ing through CSA have been able
to accomplish a surprising
amount but the student government itself is almost powerless.
The big decisions on the campus
are made Without its participation. There are several things
we can do on our own within
CSA to make it better but our
main task will be to prove to
the administration that we are
capable of making a greater
and more Vital contribution to
the maintenance and develop»
ment of the college. This year
more than ever before our such
census and failures will indicate
the role we will play in college
government.

By Dick lovely
The final score was Clark 76, West 6, When these
results were announced, reactions spread around the
campus with amazing validity. Many comments echoed
the theme that Clark Hall was point-hungry, artistic
and had lost sight of the purpose of intramural football.
It is interesting that most of the remarks came from
people who hadn‘t even seen, let alone played in, the
game. Other occupations turned at the Clark team were
largely front the West team itself. These were, in ef-
fact, that Clark has some guys who play too rough. The1cruz of the whole series of anathemas being cast upon
the Clark team, and the hall itself is that they areﬁ‘too
children” and that they want to “win at all cost.”
As a participant in the details, I would like first
of all to give an explanation of some of the factors
which contributed to the score. First the Clark team
was hot — everything we did turned out right at first
We received all the breaks and built up a specializing
lead early in the game. Then came a series of incidents
which participated our extra effort during the rest of
the game. First, West disputes a reserve‘s decision and
announced that they were protecting the game. (score
at the time: 25-0). Still angry and frustratedhthey repeatedly “placed-up” in anger over reserve’s decisions,
hard blocks, and anything else they could think of.
When they did score, it was set up by a trick play
exactly similar to one for which Navy coach Wayne
garden was publicly recommended last year, because it
was turned unsportsmanlike. With this added incentive, Clark “childishly” played as hard as possible until maritime.
From this point on, I think the final result Was as
much West’s doing as Clark’s. Not content with losing
the ball on towns in the second half, West began returning kickoffs by deliberately licking the ball back
to us without even running one scrimmage play. Question: It is more children to give up or to continue playing your best?
With Clark’s bench long since cleared early in
the last quarter, a,West senior at least three inches seller and ten pounds heather than his Clark opponent
(who was a substitute freshman) drew back to punch
him after a shuttle, When another Clark man restricted him by holding him, he was threatened by
more West players.
Clark could have settled things through fisticuffs,
delivering injuries, writing, or writing. We chose the
”children” way, though —— scoring touchdowns;

0n Testing Drugs
By nudity Wallace
Mr. oakland Reed of the
Food and Drug Administration
outlined the procedures and
problems of testing new drugs
in an address to the Grinnell
Chapter of the American Chemical Society Wednesday night.
”The greatest surge" of new
’drugs has come in the past few
years, according to url Reed.
,This has contributed greatly to
man’s benefit: — but has also
opened new possibilities of
harm. The increasing complexity of drugs has made their
testing more difficult, he said.
The Pure Food and Drug Acts
have prohibited the adulteration or mislabeling of drugs.
In 1962 the Kefauver-Harris
Amendments added the requirement that a drug be effective
as claimed when used as prescribed, as well as safe.
With the knew application
forms, the FDA requires submission of full reports on all investigations, quantitative listing
of the drug’s components, and
full reports on methods and
controls in the manufacture and
storage of the drug. Samples
and the proposed label are also
called for.
The responsibility tests with
the drug’s makers to prove it
safe and effective to the satin—
section of the FDA, Inadequate
testing, lack of evidence of ef<
fectiveness and false or his—
leading handling are grounds
for reducing certification.
After the drug has been
targeted the FDA’s interest in
it continues. Under previous
legislation, the manufacturer
had no responsibility to save or
forward reports of adverse effects caused by their drug.
Now, they are required to file
complete reports of further
testing and of reactions to the
drug. The FDA judges decide
whether the drug should con—
since without change, requires
a change in handling, or should
be withdrawn from the market Failure to report is sufficient for the drug’s withdrawal,
The Kefauver amendments
also'set up an extended time
limit by which the FDA must
act on the drug Formerly, if
no action had been taken at the
end of so days. the drug was
automatically considered approved. Now the FDA must act,
although the manufacturer is
given the right to appeal their
decision to a federal court.
D e s p i t e the formidable
amount of testing required even
before a drug ls cleared for
testing on humans, it is almost
impossible to determine all of
a drug’s potential effects. Reactions vary widely with the
