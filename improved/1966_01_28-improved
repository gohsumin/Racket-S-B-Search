Students
Grinnell upperclassmen found
the going rough at tile end of the
semester, but on the whole preferred ending the fall semester
before Christmas vacation, a recent survey by the 5&3 revealed.
Of the 250 survey forms returned. 69.5 per cent covered the
new semester exam schedule,
with an additional 5.25 per cent
favorite the early exams. but a
showtimes Christmas vacation.
Some suggested a longer mid«
term break in the tall and more
breathing space at the end of the
semester for written work and exam preparation. Only 18 per cent
allocated a return to the old system, with exams following Christe
mas vacation. Seven and a quarter per cent indicated interference
on the questionnaire.
Pressure Greater
Comparing last fall with preVious fall computers at Gi‘initial, 41
per cent indicated that they found
the treasures on them toward the
end much greater. Another 31 per
cent said the treasures seemed
slightly greater. Twenty per cent
of the Students found end-of-the
semester treasures exchanges,
 
while only 3 per cent indicated
that they seemed less than usual.
The healthy Christmas break provided 60 per cent of those questioned to do more unrequited
reading than during previous vacations. Twentyrsix per cent said
they did the same amount of unrequired reading, while 14 per
cent indicated less. A number of
students in these two categories
indicated that they were seniors
who spent the time studying for
comes.
Work Load Up
Fifyrsix and a half per cent of
the students said their work load
increased this semester, 37.5 per
cent found lt exchanges and 6
per cent found it lighter. They
rated their own performance as improved in 42 per cent at the cases,
exchanges in 33 per cent, and declined in 25 per cent.
Starting school on Labor Day
caused major inconveniences to 12
per cent of those questioned. On
the other hand, a few students
and faculty members suggested
starting the semester late in August to avoid such tight finals

Move to english Student Senate
programmes in Wednesday Session
By LIBBY PANNWITF
Wednesday night, after a week
ot deliberating on the subject of
reorganizing the present student
government system. the Student
senate came to a vote of 1277 in
favor of putting the proposed
changes into amendment form.
As it stood last week, the major
changes involved tale appointment
of the Senate, and the establish
ment of a Council of House treatments by combining the AWS
Board and the soil-1P.
SGA President Jerry forward
opened the evening’s discussion to
general functioning from the senators and members of the committee formed last week to draft the
final proposal,
The discussion covered the following general areas:
1) Will the proposed system encourage enough participation of
students not actively involved in
SSA?
2) At present the administration
dress't discuss its actions enough
with the Senate. This is not the
fault of the Senate and Should not
be used as a point of criticism.
3) Will the coordination of the
AWS Board and the CofHP be a
more efficient system and Still
representative of the students?
4) Karen Lauterbach said those
in favor of publishing the Senate
were those who were never active
in the Senate, and that the Senate
was effective as a political training ground and accomplished a
great deal.
5) in the past the Senate has
been given more of a chance to
be an effective part of the student
government, some senators said.
This year it has not been given
the chance and has been Worked
around in general, these senators
continued.
“The important thing," forward
Said, “is what each [if uS considers student government to be. I
think that the SGA functions to do
a job—to modern effectively and
also to talk with college officials.”

credit-Fails
plants Logic of Editorial ,
To the Editor:
The editor last week accused
the newly adopted credit-fail pro»
local or being a “half-way” measure and implied that a couiplete
pass~fail system would have been
prescribed. 1 disagree,
There are several client objectives to a complete passsfail sys
tel. For one thing, oi itself, a
complete passsfail system fails to
provide a means for distinguishing excellence and makes selfrassessment ot performance on the
part ot the student difficult, it
not impossible. in sure many
Grinnell students would find the
complete removal ot all measures
of relative achievement to be 0177
iectiooable. in addition, students'
grade points are a mayor consideration ct employers and graduate schools. To english them completely might seriously hammer
the chances oi a Grinnell graduate
obtaining employment or admission to graduate study according
to his or her series
Perhaps holiday it will be post
bible to eliminate letter grades
completely and to replace them
with a system of short, individual
essays oi evaluation and with let
term or recommendation sufficiently residential with graduate
schools as to ensure our students’
acceptance at period places or
study. Until the time when such
a system can he successfully institutes at Grinnell, or at any li
oral arts college for that matter
I see no alternative to the retention oi a system of letter grades,
at least in part. :
However, while i feel that a to» '
tax pass~fail system would be both
unicasible and unavailable for
Grinnell now and in the forever»
able future, 1 also believe that
there are limitations interest inn
a trading system based complete-f
ly on letter grades oi sufficient'
import to justify the faculty's‘
adoption of the limited, voluntary,
one course per semester “creditiail" measure. Within particular
courses the stress on grades too
often encourages students to work
for the wrong reasons or in click
wrong manner. The emphasis is
placed on the grade achieved
rather than on the knowledgei
gained or the intellectual skills‘
developed. The importance at-l
tactics both at (rl'innell and after‘;
Grillnell to a single number. the‘
cumulative grade point, reflections
grades in courses that vary cost
specially in significance and in'
didﬁmulti, can send to grave dis
es and to the punishment o
i intellectually advertisers.‘
This cmpliasis on the cumulati c
grade point has frequently led std: l
cents to select courses in whichi
they can get the best grades path- l
er than those best suited to tried
educational needs or most satin
‘ ' g to their intellectual carlos
ll-
lay removing this emphasis oi
era s to a limited extent. the
faculty has permitted the studentsi,
greater trccdoui or choice in they
NY—
selection oi courses. At the same
time, by remaining letter grades in
part, or entirely if the student so
desired, the faculty has provided
both the students and themselves
with adequate means to gauge the
individuals overall academic proc»
ms and has insured that Grinnell
students will not be implemented at
the hands of graduate schools and
employers.
As to the rest at last week's
editorial, I shall only comment
briefly, though probably more
than it reserves. Perhaps some
students will let their work slide
in their elected pass-fail course.
Not a new let work slide in one
or more courses now Still, it the
student is properly motivated and
has elected to study a subject
which increases him, 1 see no
reason to tear “floppy, halfrway
work.” The average semester
download is well within the capacity oi almost all Grinnell students.
it the student is insutticiently mo
treated, whether he takes a course
on a “creditrfail” basis or not will
make little difference.
The logic of the editorial as a
whole appears to me to be injudicious as well as rebound. The
rather peculiar position taken by
the editor was hardly calculated
to create the impression ot a ma.
sure student body among an already identical faculty and admin»
isolation.

Over in past new years i have

first in this, my treshman, year.
Among the many galleries and
textbooks i read was one in par
similar which i would like to
quote at some length, because it
embedded everything i always
dropped of in a college:
“The policy at [this college] is
to impose as new rules as possible.
Our students are considered to be
responsible adults and are treated
in this manner.
“The college will interface as
little as possible in the personal
lives ot students, but all members
at the college community are ex.
posted to maintain its excellent
reputation, civic as well as acer

“In such an [independent] atmosphere all members oi the community have the opportunityiand
the responsibility * to test the
merit of ideas in the light oi
ll'utc. assured of I'aspect for their
honest inquiry from all other
members of the community."
I went on to read the objective:
at the college: _
"[This college] exists for the
purpose oi sharing the character
oi each ot its students 7 to make
each student a different and a
better human being.” ~
Does anyone recognize this
haven of intellectual and personal
liberty? I don't blame you, fellow
Pioneers, but I would like to point
out that the aforementioned selections come from the Grinnell
College Bulletin, and the Student
Handbook, 196566.
The atmosphere that services
this campus is one oi general district by the administration toward
the students. The only reason this
attitude is allowed, possibly even
encouraged, to exist is that the
corresponding attitude of the slut
cents here is one of extreme
apache. is it that Grinnellions
would rather switch than right »
that is, stibiugate their personal
goals to the apparently over-rid
ing authority ot the administra»
tion — or is it that the college's
“excellent reputation, civic as
well as academic” attempts a her—
main carrier oi person __ perhaps
a superior student. but a midi»
one individual? However, all is
not lost, it only the administration would assume that perhaps
the student is not too far gone for
salvation and that it is the admin»
infection's duty to take the first
steps

Bishop, a junior biology major,
is living in Smith. Bishop says he
finds Grinnell very different so-

half Grinnell's enrollment, 'and
they all come from the same area.
a. Bishop sees advantages and draw-
banks to Grinnell’s size and the
wide differences among its students. “At genuine the students
often come to have closer relationships,” he says.
sorry is a sociology major. He
is a sophomore and will spend his
Grinnell semester in East morris.
Also a sociology major is sophomore Miss sorry. She and Miss
Wilson, a chemistry major, both
live in Loose. This is the first directory experience for the two
girls and both find it “marvel
