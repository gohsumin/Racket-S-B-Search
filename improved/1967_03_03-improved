New AWS Pres. Stresses
Initiative. Communication Representative
By Mary calcium
Leida Schoggen, newly elected president or the AWS board, is
anything but a veteran of campus politics. A transfer brown Park
College. St. Louis, in 1965, and a participant in the Washington
semester last tall, Leida processes an unusual enthusiasm and
optimize about Grinnell Virtually undiminished by the two computers she has spent on campus.
While uninitiated in Grinnell
campus politics, Miss Schoggen's experiences as a political
science major, a student or
resistant last semester in
Washington, a worker with preschool oulturaiiy received std<
cents last summer and female
departments the previous summer, indicates her ability to
deal with people and their proc«
less.
As AWS board president,
Miss Schoggen is concerned with
“process.” She indicated the
most important concern for next
year's student leaders will be
to continue and expand the process of communication and student initiative begun by the
Kent administration.
With reference to working out
a satisfactory hall residents
system on South Campus she
said, “It’s going to work, because we're going to make it
Work,"
Miss Schoggen’s enthusiasm
for Grinnell derived partly
from comparison with American University, location or the
Washington semester. She
found that Grinnell in general
takes itself less seriously, is
more related and more refer
tlve to different ways or feeling,
thinking and behavior. “When
I came back here I could re—
law, and it wash't that I didn’t
love Washington and the pro—
gray," she said. “At principal
you feel tree to express how
you think and teen about things."

College Seeks NSF Grant
By Pat Smith
Grinnell has applied to
the College Science improvement Program at the National
Science Foundation for a $193,000
grant for expansion within the
natural and social science departments.
The application specsﬁes that
the grant would establish a
researchestudy fund, a sat»
optical assistance fund, a faculty seminar program and field
studies in anthropology and biology.
Stated objectives for expansion within the biology, Chemistry, physics, mathematics, anthropology, economics, political
science, and sociology report<
series include: (1) “improved
conditions of scholarship con.

finance of a faculty of high
professional quality." (2) “up

subject matter areas,” (3) “upgrading ot student scientific
confidence and entertainment
oi related pedagogical instrumentation in science education,"
and (4) ”expanded opportunities for field studies in biological and social sciences."
The live specsﬁc obligations
ot the grant are designed to
luliiil the objectives. The re-
search-study fund would enable
faculty members to participate
in summer study projects and
summer research projects.
The sabbatical assistance fund
would increase the salary of a

professor from one semester's
pay to a full year's pay full

(Currently, a professor is given
a semester's salary for an absence of either a semester or
a year.)

Curriculum Suggestion —
Since its beginning, the metro’s struggle for civil
and human rights has arrested his privileges as an
American citizen as well as his rights as a human being.
For, the metro in the United States is not only part of
a distinct racial progress, but also part of the total development of American society. The metro’s role in
American history has, however, been almost completely
ignored in conventional classroom. Although certain Grinnell courses mention some facts of metro history in an
incidental manner, no direct and detailed formal investigation of the subject is offered.
metro history is usually excluded from course offerings because it is supposedly too specialized an area of
study for a small liberal arts college, Certainly Grinnell
should expensive broad, integrated, rather than narrow,
restricted course work. But the inclusion of metro history
as merely an addition to already existing courses would
totally not give it the importance and stress that metro
llistory reserves. Until metro history is given its proper
emphasis in American history from grade school on,
a separate, comprehensive course is necessary to company
site for the reflect. Two areas that could merit special
attention are the Reconstruction period and the civil
rights efforts of recent years,
At Grinnell there may be difficulty in finding someone who feels qualified to teach the subject. The college
could, however, seek outside resources. Response to last
semester’s questionnaire about the LeMoyne program
located interest in a faculty exchange program. Since
euro history is an area in which LeMoyne, which already offers the course, could contribute to Grinnell, inn’t
this a natural opportunity for initiative the suggested exchange? Any arrangement of this kind would require pa
event effort and persistent enthusiasm, but the benefits
for both colleges would be great.
At a time when much of American life is nominated
by the battle for racial equality and density, Grinnell cannon continue to ignore the importance of acquisition its
white students with a knowledge of their fellow Americans and its metro students with a sense of their own historical identity. “Black and white together” has meaning
only if we know who the “black" is and what he has accomplished for and with the “white." P

Apartments for Women —
Women students were presented with a pleasant surprise yesterday. Dean Alice Low notified junior women
that the college effectively plans to allow a limited number of them to live off-campus in private apartments in
their senior year, 1967-68. This new freedom, coupled
with the recent proposal to english women’s lighting
hours restrictions, recognized for the first time women
students’ rights to equal social responsibilities.
Mrs. Low does seem to consider the new possibility
in women’s housing a temporary one, however. Mrs. Low
and a committee are studying the question of building a
new women’s form that may potentially bring students
back on-campus. But hopefully this committee will give
considerable weight to the opinions expressed by a significant segment of the student body in the 5&1! article last
week “Students andorra Apartments".
Students have a wide variety of spelling needs.
Possibilities for different types of living ﬂ forms and
apartments, co-op and cold forms — should exist side
by side.

A Student Opinion
ill Defense of Selective Servio
By Steve thunder
in suite of the fact that current fashion among
Certain senators from Massachusetts and label"
allyroriented college students pictures the con«
deviation ol the present Selective Service western, much remains to be said in its defense.
While Senator Kennedy‘s plan for a national lottery and the NSA position on the draft are to be
commented for their noble examination seems
meets, it should be recognized that they ignore
a hard reality bl mid-20m century society, and
thus observe the real issues at stake.
To employ a hackneyed clicks. our present
era is one of increasing complexity on all prints.
In foreign affairs, national security planning, education, and urban planning — in name only a few
ﬁends m the demand of American society for
highly educated, technically competent individuals is steadily increasing. There are few people
who would deny that without such individuals
our potential culture functioning in a predomis
’namely promotion, agrarian world would be se-
proudly impaired. in short, the objective Candis
tions of the present epoch require, more than
ever, the existence of an intellectual-technical
elite corps for national survival.
The present Selective Service System was designed in full compliance ni this hard fact oi life.
It was created and institutes to ensure the conservation of a valuable natural resource — intellectual conference and technical Skill _. ll an
era of limited welfare. The major crit ibm of
current characters of the system is that it is unfairly missed against certain ethnic communities
and lower-income groups in general, Their answer to the problem lies in the constitution of
some sort of arbitrary system of construction for
the present system. By being arbitrary, the new
draft system would necessarily be more just. Yet
an interest problem Di a "just", arbitrary sys—
tel lies in tile fact that it is also blind, and it
thickness may be critical to our real national
interests. For who can really measure the long.
run societal costs of a search for blind justice
‘which results in the lightning off or some of our
most important intellectual resources to the
battlefields of Vietnam, or Thailand, or Cambodia, or wherever our current maria for “prevention welfare" threatens to take us. As long as
we can afford it (that is, as long as we can avoid
involvement in an armed conflict on the scale of
World War H) We must make some attempt to
be selective. It is far better to rationalize unfairness in a manner which ministers the long-run
costs to society, in terms of intellectual resources,
than to cast our fate to the winds of a national
lottery at universal military service.
All of this is not 10 deny that certain gmup.
in our society are bearing an industry disproportionafe share of the military burden. Yet the insurance comes not from the present Selective services System, but from the fact that our society
penalties certain individuals for circumstances
of birth and environment which are beyond their
control. The criteria for the present system of se«
section is intellectual capacity as caused by attendance at an institution All higher education. It
thus reflects the insurance of society because it
has a bulletin bias against individuals who, because of racial origins, early educational destinations, and economic hardship — rather than because of the lack of intellectual capacity — have
been unable to gain assistance to one of the
country’s several thousand ivory towers. While
making out draft law more arbitrary will serve
to prevent it from marketing the real insurance of
society, it will not serve to section that insurance.
Indeed, by providing an added drain on our intellectual resources, it will only serve to make 1!
more difficult for us lo solve the underlying problems which make the present Selective Service
System so unavailable.

The True Grinnell
To the Editor:
The recent election has clear
ly shown the true spirit of the
liberal Grinnell student body.
When faced with a choice between action or being modified,
between progress or promise,
the majority chose, in the true
spirit ol rural America, to be
content with what they have
and to be looked by a arcade of
“charitable” discussions with
the administration,
The majority ni Grinnell is,
has been, and probably always
will be looked. They were not
looked by the candidates, not
by the administration, but they
are looked by themselves. They
fool themselves into beginning
that they are a new generation
full of new thoughts and are
willing to accept the ideas of
the previous generation. They
fool themselves into beginning
that Grinnell promotes indian»
quality and new thoughts.
In reality the majority of
Grinnell consists of small town
Victorian people and thoughts,
In reality Grinnell teaches that
consortium is the best way,
and we are invisible bl our
own worthwhile thought. There
is a lot of talk about progress,
just as there is a lot of talk
about sex, and I lot of talk
about drugs: there is just u lot
of talk. Grinnell is a stronghold
of conservative America, protected from any new ideas by
miles of cornfields.
I do not say that this is
wrong. I only say that those
people who are cooling themselves should recognize that.
Grinnell is basically conservative, and they should realize
that they will end up living a
nice middle class life, agreeing
in several years with such famous investments century photo—
mothers as Glenn segment and
John project. Recognize that
you are quite willing to be con-
and realize that such events as
spring root are only a reward
by Papa Legget for being nice
little boys and girls all year.
Once you realize this, perhaps
you will also realize why the
majority of those students not
willing to be founded by Grin»
well’s compromise consortium
either transfer 01‘ are removed
by the administration,

Dear Mrs. Hawk:
Since you did not have the
common courtesy to finish our

voice my objectives.
First, why is South Lounge

an extension of the library,
then chain coaches could have
easily been placed in Bin-line.
I fail to see the crime involved
if 1 choose to use South Lounge
to relax, yet i am planned with
the continued guidance of someone mapping on my shoulder,
second, 1 asked you what you
proposed as an alternative to
South Lounge (If you recall
this is the point at which you
walked away while 1 was talking. Will you please answer
this question? When I complete
of the lack of privacy at Grinnell, 1 up told that "statements other than open forms

again I ask, where am I to ﬁnd

Third, under what authority
do you continually history me?
My understanding is that the

Young’s Crazy People
To the Editor:
The search of “crazy people"
which Mr. Young noted in his
essay in last week’s son has
more to do with an apparently
revised admissions policy, I believe, then it does with the college itself. Quite francis, there
hash’t been a highly enjoyed
(with “crazy people") class ad,
fitted since the characters
who were seniors my freshman
year reported. True. this is sad,
but it inn’t the college entire—
ment that is preventing awareness from ﬂfinishing.
Mr. Young suggests that
Grinnell might to do more to
“accommodate, even encourage,
the exceptional" and he sun»
tests as a reason for our lack
of crazy people “that we make
it too difficult to be crazy
here.”
I don’t think that the Grin»
well atmosphere, itself, can be
held responsible for the lack
of crazy people. No one is
forced to such‘nice his colorado
accessibility for a serious, productive, highly-motivated way—
of-life. A true crazy person!

Gyherneiies Forces Values networking l
By bank Balikov
Man makes his destiny be
cause of and with the tools that
he makes. This was the theme
of Dr. Emmanuel Mesthene
during reservation Weekend,
Feb. 2425.
Dr. Mesthene, Executive Director oi the Harvard University Program on Technology
and Society, said man acts out
his role as maker in a variety
or ways; When he understands
nature; when he improved po—
optical relationships; or when he
appreciated art and knows God.
in technologically active times
(such as the present) institutions cannon hold values or so»
dial moves. In technologically
less active times, activity is
centered on social preoccupa<
thin and readjustment. But a
common reaction to changes
brought by the cybernetic ago
is to hold tight to familiar
meetings or basic tennis. This
at present sends to introduce a
Schism between science and
values.
Man can now be an artist
with technology as his art. He
acts both by knowing and by
entering his environment. when
entering nature he is directly
using tools to make an object
for a purpose according to a
preconceived idea. This prior
connection and material replication are essential, and are
the basis of art. But it is also
useful to distinction between
art and science according to
their purposes. Art looks to the
thing in itself, the object for
Its own sake. Science uses the
object as intermediate, from
which the making gives knowledge. In the past it has been
possible to keep these ideas in
separate categories; one would
be the distinction between basic
and applied science. But research science is relatively new
and though it concerns the
basic relationship of artist on
material, the material (his
tool) by its power is forming a
wedding of technology and Science.
Science Affects Culture
Science has had great effects
on culture for the past few
Centuries but it was not undertaken for these side-effects.
Technology too had its cultural
effects in the industrialization
that followed invention. Technology is now seen as a means
to further Valuable ends.
Once science is pursuit for
its goals, it is drawn into the
area or social impose. Our tools
are so sophisticated that they
have expanded science beyond
the lab so that parts of science
require the world as laboratory.
Science is ﬁusing out what
nature is like and is both changing to meet it and changing
nature. Because science has
grown so large it must be the
public who has the right to say
what changes can be made in
the world, Knowing nature and
entering nature have become a
single process.
We have learned too much to
empire to the complicated sys<
topic philosophy oi the 19th
century but we must realize
that the opposite is just as bad.
The tools we now use have
needed together in art the
transformation and the cognitive, New tools require social
representation if their potential
is to be realized, Philosophy of
the new technology cannon law

serves invisible or making the

The cybernetic age has also
brought a new distinction be

large amount oi research, new

existence) is now finances by
the government and directed by
government policy.
Increased Government Role
There is an increased demand for those public goods

areas or need. American Gyp.

good reason for building the

The next part oi the question is whether or not the

it may be interesting in this
light to make a comparison
with another school which has
faced the same problem. Carleton completed a new men’s
PE. complex in 1964. They
have also recently completed a
woman's P. complex containing some titles which are
superior to the ones we have
now for all campus use. While

about the same things as we
are as reported by the site
with the exception that no one
there is worried about an overempliasis on athletics. I hope
that the 5&3 can confirm this
after intervention the Carleton student leaders.
with these considerations in
mind it is very difficult for me
to see that there is a problem
oi emphasis and degree with
regard to the new complex except possibly in some peoples’
minds.

The first mistake was in

good standard for lodging subsequent performances, But
again. too, this is not a professional theater. Perhaps the re

I hope the students will be

tradition of sensitivity to the
needs of the student in a
rapidly changing society.
Mr, suggest tells me that
the students at Grinnell are
too implement. Although I have
forsaken the warmth and shelter of Grinnell and now exhibit
the cold, creek world, I still
find myself sympathizing with
the students’ experience. From
my vintage point in the outside world, I find that the living conditions at Grinnell
seem more insulin than ever.
Perhaps Mr. suggest would
he a little more implement if
he were forced to live the life
of a Grinnell student for a few
days or weeks. Living in a
form, eating in a dining hall,
and making love in public
places are somehow not quite
as satisfying as living in a
home, eating with one’s intimate friends, and making love
in private.
It living conditions at Grinneli were a bit more conducted
to the healthy development of
the individual into it self-governing and responsible human
being, perhaps there would be
no need for expanded mental
health facilities.

Religion Needs Explaining
Religion and the divine must
now be explained, not explained
away. Mesthene says religious
experience is too persistent a
fact of history and human nature to discuss. While the content of truth changes as the
World does. the function does
not. Value changes, talking does
not. Religion satinﬁes man’s
ability to see, act and unity.
it is a common vision oi what
man could be if he were so
human that he would be no
longer physical. God is maker
and ultimate purpose. Man is
pure artist. God is what man
has made him with his tools
and because of man’s use oi
these tools, it is his best work.
In a subsequent interview
With the 5&3, Dr, Mesthene
commented on those jobholders
that will be displayed by the
