Court Rules Guilty
3 Get Conduct Pro
By HENRY WILHELM
In the first court case of the
year, two girls and one boy
were sentences to one semester
of conduct promotion for a “limitation violation" by a joint see—
sign of the Men’s and Women's
Primary courts. The boy was
caught “about holiday through
the window” of barnes Hall late
last Friday evening by the
w a t c h m a 11. He voluntarily
turned himself in to CofHP
President Bob quote the next
morning. The girls involved
turned themselves in to AWS
Board President Karen Lauterbach.
The dependence pleased guilty
to the charges against them
but asked that the penalty be
limited to conduct promotion.
Karen Lauterbach had original
1y suggested to the court that
in addition to conduct promotion open form privileges for
the dependence should be suspended for a semester, but this
was dropped after registration.
The boy told the court that he
thought conduct promotion would
be sufficient to peter him from
doing such a thing again. He
noted that the stated function
of the court is to be “presentation rather than positive." its
added that in this case restriction open forms would be “kind
of silly."
Lauterbach told the court that
this case was “just a matter or
illegal entry” and that there
were no integrating circumstances. Karen told the session,
which was attended by Dean of
Men, Eugene Thompson, and
Dean of Women, Alice Low,
that the dependence “showed a
remarkable lack or judgment
and responsibility" in their actions. None of the dependence

Questions Editorial
To The Editor:
1 was much struck by the edt»
normal in the last issue, in which
is repeated several times the
notion that rules should reflect
reality.
The notion strikes me as both
dangerous and fallacious. It
human conduct were simply
and merely natural, like natural
laws, then rules, i.e.. scienceﬁc
laws, would be no more than reflections of reality, But if human conduct is a matter of
choice, of free will, then your
editorial’s thesis will be that
laws ought to correspond to
whatever human beings choose
to do. If the majority should
choose to be creek, intolerant,
various, then the laws should,
by reflection these, function
such attitudes and their consistent acts.
Man’s nature is, it seems to
me, unlike nature’s nature; and
no man’s rules precise the results of his conduct. Otherwise
there would be no use in having
rules and laws.

Invalid congratulations
As a young fish 1 used to wonder what going
to a liberal arts school would be like, so i decided
to go to Grinnell College.
I adjusted my scales, spam into the opaque
bowl where the school was located, and was surprised tb see all of the students attached to the
sides of the bowl by tape over their find. As soon
as I was discovered, I, too, was tapes down. It
was really terrible, because I coupon’t see out
and whenever I looked in, all I saw were still<

the center of the bowl.
Looking a little closer, even though I was
bound by the tape. I saw several older fish talking
heatedly about something I coupon’t understand.
They never quit talking, and badly enough, never
moved, never changed their position, and, as far
as I could tell, had probably always been that
way. As long as I was there, I never did know
who they were, or what they were doing.
I stayed at Grinnell for my whole college
career, and tested two things:

A final evaluation of the Des

and those who might consider a

i think that most people are
aware of the achievements of
the Des points Project. It:
started three block groups, co-
operated with three rent strikes.
and distributed information on
welfare, the poverty program,
city government, etc. throughout the community in which it
operated. To the Grinnell student who has had no experience
with community organizing. I
can suppose that the achieve.
series seem minimal. But community organizing only intend
to build the groundwork for

involves undramatic, person-anderson encourages; improved

Grinnellians Describe leMoyne life
‘Pride and Prejudice' planned

ED. NOTE: The following
story was prepared by the ilve
Grinnell students who participated in the GrinneIi-LeMoyne
exchange program last semester. ,
The five participants were
.janet Poland, Amy russian,
Pat Stern, honda Thumen and
Rich Lance.
After a summer oi readjusting ourselves to life in the White
Power Structure, the five of us
who attended LeMoyne College
last semester have returned to
our coupons at Grinllell. To
those of you who noticed our
absence and have been asking,
“How was it?” we would like to
present some of our expressions in a bit more detail than
“Great!” which is true. but
somewhat oversimplified.
LeMoyne is an all-metro college in Memphis, Tennessee.
Under the LeMoyne-Grinneli exchange program, which began
two years ago, Grinnell sends
four or five students to live and
study at LeMoyne second se»
master, and LeMoyne sends
about the same number here.
LeMlJyne is situated deep in
the segregated metro area of
the city, and most oi its students consequently have very
little contact with writes. especially Nortllerners. Since most
White Grinnell students live in
eq rally segregated environments. the program aims to
promote interracial understand

With this rather value assignment in the banks or our
minds, the live oi us invited

four months we went through a

If a student heads for Mississippi to trustee for Human Rights,
he has an identity as a consider.
But our role was simply “stud
sent." Our sole specialty was
in Memphis
that we were highly visible in
clouds.
We settled down in two somewhat tickets houses near the
campus. Two girls shared one
house with a senior LeMoyne
girl: two of us lived with our
most amazon “housemother,”
who coupled as a Russian and
French teachers She looked
about selection, seemed to
know everyone in Memphis, and
shared our belief that Grinnell
girls are old enough to take
care of themselves. Rich Lance
and another LeMoyne student
lived nearby in the basement at
a large, mysterious house owned
by an old, eccentric width

LeMoyne's neighborhood must
be described as lower economic
level. Across the street from
our house was a Vast Federal
Housing Project and one of
Memphis’ innumerable trademarks. The cover (Mississippi
and Walker), nominated "chicken Corner” by Grinnell's red
Donahoe when he taught at LeMoyne, was described in a book
or local history as the toughest
corner in Tennessee in the
lEGO’s.
To the five of us fresh from
white suburban, the neighborhood was exciting. Perhaps ii

With the beginning of classes
came the deluxe of people to

found most of the students very
friendly and as pages to get to
know us as we were to meet
them. Our welcome was warm.
One day a group of girls approaches Amy and asked, “Are
you one oi the Grinnell students?"
“Yeah," she said slightly.
“How could you tell?"

Duck, and the Boogaloo.
At that- gathering and at subsequent parties we served a
quality that suffered from the

Grinnell, social life implies
something scheduled and selfconscious. At LeMoyne, social
lite means having a good time.
People dance and drink because
they feel like it. not for any
hidden purpose.
We realize that the social def<

Cornell meet to indicate how
his team will shape up in the
conference. Running against

A new rule has been added
to the conference this year that
will help Obermiller's evaluation.
Every team will now be required to send results of all their
meets to the other nine teams
in the conference.
Pleased with the freshmen
results in their meet against
brake, Obermiller remains optimistic. Although they last, he
noted, they operated a gain of
