Facull'y Poll on S’rules'l'
Representatives oi the charles
and Black have conducted an
opinion poll among the faculty
of the college to ascertain the
reaction to the proposal oi the
Committee on Curriculum and
Academic Affairs, the text or
which appeared in the last issue
of the newspaper. These opinions
are presented here without
comment for the information of
the Griiinell College community:
Gerald V. balance, Classical
Languages: “Basically it will be
a debate of who is going to run
the school, 1,] for one, still Credit
die‘phlioso’why underlying the
constitution of this College, and
any number of other institutions,
in delegation power on the basis
of certain conventions and ex
presence, Consequently I am
opposed to any measure which
will heaven or alter the present
status oi the faculty in the
legislative process of the College.
One of the responsibilities of the
faculty in legislation curriculum
and academic affairs is to
provide the most efficient
possible channels for student
opinion and to give this opinion
very serious consideration.
originally, the references before
the faculty proposed to achieve
this support by accounting the
very legislative power on which
this responsibility is promised.
But the proposal as i see it, with
the mutual veto power of students
and faculty, and the possibility
ot a breach in the cooperative
relationship oi the faculty and the
President, is potentially less
efficient and more discipline
than the present state of affairs,
Fortunately, these are not the
only alternatives, The proposal
in question has a number of
comfortable points which could
be maintained satisiactorily by
the amendments to be proposed
by Mr. soldiers i trust that this
will be theoutcome.”
Robert Grey. Political Science:
law in essential agreement with
the proposal of the tests come
little My support entries
from the proposition that
academic decisions should
reflect both the interests of the
educated and whatever special
conference exists in the come
trinity as to what these interests
are and how they may best he
realized Although there are
difficulties in drawing boundaries between areas in which
various groups have conference
and areas in which they do not,
and comparable difficulties in
entertaining who has most
conference in an area, I find the
butts committee’s destinations
between departmental and allr
college curriculum matters the
most satisfactory, albert value,
boundary line, Faculty members
have received substantial
training, done substantial
thinking, and conducted research
in their disciplines. This
background gives them a competitive in departmental matters
which should be reﬂenter in
decisions at that level. They have
no comparable background, and
thus no special conference, on
all campus curriculum matters.
Since our motorola oi decisionmaking at this level is unjustified
by special conference, and I
know of no other completing
multiﬁnation, I support student
participation in these decisions.

contrary Degree
newbie Hancock is a former Grinnell student
and, though still a young man, one of the most noted
Jazz musicians in the country. He has accepted an
invitation from CBS to come to Grinnell to help
communicate Black parties’ Day. '
At their last meeting before spring vacation,
the faculty overwhelmingly voted to give Hancock
an contrary corporate. There were only two distant—

ing votes. Dean Wall, in presenting the motion."
said that the proposal had been brought to him by
CBS. It remains only for the proposal to be presented to the trustees. .
The faculty vote leads us to question the value
of the contrary degree given by Grinnell College.
We do not dispute Hancock’s considerable accomplishments and parents in the field of music, Hancock, however, is barely thirty years old. Furthermore, though he spent four years at Grinnell, he
never earned a degree. Tile contrary corporate
should be a noble token of praise given to a man for
a lifetime of service and excellence in a particular
field. The apparent real with which the faculty voted
to give Hancock the degree indicates to us that they
were perhaps more interested in wondering to the
desired of a minority than maintaining the high
standards of the contrary degree.
In the past, the College has given contrary degrees to treatments, compression, and distinguished
scholars. Several years ago, we also awarded an
contrary degree to the last great black matter, the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. To give Hancock the
same honor as King is to either upgrade the greater
man or exact the lesser. Either alternative speaks
ill of the memory of King and the density of Grinnell
College.
Milovctn Djilos
We note with considerable interest the silence
on campus concerning the matter of Milovan Djilas’
cancelled visit. Djilas was unable to deliver the Rosenfield Lectures at Grinnell because the Yugoslav»
ian government, which has twice imprisoned Djilas,
has removed his passport. This outrageous action has
as yet occasional no official projects and no letters
to the 58:8.
The Committee on international Studies, the
sponsors oi the lectures, issued a brand statement in
which they said Djilas “is unable to come to this
country from Belgrade at this time.” The secretary
of the committee has stated that he was not officially
approved of the reason for cancellation when the notice was sent out. He said, however, that the committee had no plans to protest the actions of the
legislation government.
We explore the impressive policies of the legislation government. And we cannon help but wonder at the notices of those who concern totalitarianism on the right, while they rationalize or ignore
its existence on the left,
Editors’ Note: At the last moment we received a letter
from President suggest to the legislation embassy which

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Par’r 4 )Moiiyrs
The Development of die Mind is Discussed
in the development of the mind
we have included a Career, the
development oi the excellent, and
the appreciation oi the arts Each
oi these requires a discussion;
first, let us consider a career.
Some careers are surely
technical and require knowledge
and-or skill mainly within a given
field, e,g,, surgery, physical
education, and the teaching oi
mathematics, or of a language
(not including literature). Others
require an added knowledge oi
a variety of related fields for
their completion, e.g., drama,
economics, politics, law,
philosophy; for a good dramatist
must have strong insights into
human nature and be somewhat
oi a christopher; a good
economics must be sufficiently
informed of political theory,
practice, and currencies; and a
good lawyer needs logic,
psychology, and knowledge of
human nature. In general, the
more a career becomes comprehensive, the more it requires
a form or a proper ordering or
its various elements for its
completeness; and as it becomes
more complete, it becomes more
successful and so adds more
equipment to its activity, '
A career is a dominant or the
dominant part ot a man’s activity; and since interest in a
career contributed a great deal
to one’s happiness, the proper
choice of it becomes a matter
of importance. Some students
decide early on a career and do
not change their minds. Others,
due to a variety oi interests or
a change or mind, need time to
get acquainted with a number oi
fields before making the proper
choice; and an institution which
allows them this time and encourages them to be exposed to
a number of ﬁends is more likely
to contribute to that choice.
There are also those who do not
know what they want, and with
time these too may find what they
want. The decision on a career,
then, should not be happened by
publishing requirements early;
and while most students decide
by the end or the second year
in college, a new need more time
and should not be left to those
who know less (eg, to the
student), but should be determined by those who know more
(i.e., by the experts in each
field). Such historical phrases as
“relating or specializing the
requirements," “the student
knows what is best for him,”
“keeping up with theories,““it's
time for change," are elegant or
conditions and not arguments. So
while colleges may find it ad-
visible to make changes for
practical reasons, such changes
must be critical and not
strategic, Strategic changes
must be made mainly because
of theoretical considerations As
for the argument that
requirements should be designed
to make a liberal education
possible for a greater proportion
oistudents entering colleges, and
that the better students will
choose or be advised to choose
what is best for them anyway,
this constitutes chance and
mediocrity for excellence and
may portions what is needed,
thus creating the able student.
So While some colleges with low
standards need this argument for
survival or for batteries the
education of disadvantaged
students, the better colleges
should avoid it altogether if a
liberal education is to be such
as already defined.
The problem of whether a
Career should be part of a liberal
education or not, is also resolved
by what has been said; for the
more a career requires elements
from other fields for its per»
section and proper effectiveness,
the more its own technical
aspects become only matter for
a higher form. But the aim oi
a liberal education is happiness,
which includes an ordering of
treasures, and one oi these is a
dominant or the dominant and
is present in a career. Hence a
career, especially when it
requires elements from other
fields, should be a part of a
liberal education.
The next problem is the
development or the student’s
excellent, or of his general intelligence, if you wish, and it is
concerned in a general way with
our present civilization, what it
is, how it has come to be, and
where it sends to be going and
should be going; and one might
call this “the history cl our
present civilization.” Man is a
political animal, to be sure, acid
his “human vector” has (a) a
starting point: the distant past
(1)) a quantity’ the ordered skin
total oi his development up to
the present, and (c) a direction:
an ideal goal or its promise in
the future, and to understand
himself and where he is going,
in general he should have some
knowledge oi these parts, The
two parts of our present
civilization are its being and its
becoming. Its becoming is the
historical movement and the
ordered accomplishments up to
the present, with some invitation
of the future; that of its being
includes the general principles

and trucks which we regard as
constitution the nature oi our
present civilization. The terms
“static“ and “dynamic,” or
“permancncc” and “change”
have often been used for “being”
and “becoming.”
Knowing nothing about the past
is to some extent like starting
over again and making the same
mistakes; and trying to learn
everything about it leaves no
time [or progress. So there should
be a sense oi proportion and a
golden mean, limited to what is
outstanding (truth, cordless and
beauty) and studied in a general
way and not effectively Man’s
becoming, then, is man's history
since the dawn of civilization, and
it should include its main
aspects: political, economic,
intellectual, artistic, and
religious; and the study oi this
should be part of a liberal
education, Part of the material
for this should be direct sources,
for works oi great men cannon
be achieved with the same
adequate and accuracy by lesser
men The integration (ti-historical
sources, on the other hand,
always remains a problem, and
one may use what seems the best
available; for example, Ranr
call’s “The Making of the Modern
Mind” was Successfully used for
this purpose for a liumbcr of
years,
As [or the other part, the being
or our present civilization, it is
concerned with art, science, and
method, regarded as permanent
contributions or almost so, being
also to some extent good for
everyone to know. Every
scientist or artist should have
some training in the general
prerequisites of his special
science or art; and all others,
businessmen and lawyers and
banners and the rest, would
device some geneﬁts from such
prerequisites or “logical"
training Such a course may be
called ”methodology,” and it is
concerned with the principles of
any science (the nature oi
science, or logic and scientific
methods) and those oi any art
A scientist, for example, should
have a defining idea of the nature
oi his particular science, and

who pursuit their studies and
other interests not too differently
from other students, Henry was
a second semester freshman

in March of 1965 to cover Dr.
Martin Luther King’s civil rights

well, shared with Henry an in '
latest in publications and a decision to liberal and radical causes;
in fact, she was to take the next
year off from school in order to
work with the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Chicago,
Yet all was not really so calm
in that spring term of 1965 as
it might have seemed then. For
when the FacultyStudent Board
of Publications selected John
Phillips and Henry Wilhelm as
the editors for the 1966 cycling,
the stage was set for a serious
conflict between Wilhelm and the
College, a conflict that would last
much longer than either would
have expected or hoped for,
That 1966 textbook, as most
Grinnell students and faculty
know, was never published, are
though Wilhelm put in a year and
a half of work into it, and founded
out of school in the process. The
college refused to publish it,
because it was afraid some of
the pictures and copy in the book
7 for example, pictures at a property a might leave the college
open to label suits.
Wilhelm did not leave Grinnell
after he flunkecl out of school and
after the college gave him back
the proof pages of the textbook,
he stayed and opened up the East
Street Gallery of Photography in
his father's old house at 1408 East
Street. in 1957 Krystyna german
joined him and they have been
living together there since then.
In the past new years, Henry

friends — music Kaeser, Richard
Schneirov, Steve saint, John
Phillips, Bob Hodierne, Larry
Frank, Kit order, and Ken business 7 who have lived at me

have been involved in various
ways with the college and the

hence of the general nature of
a science, If a science is defined
as “universal knowledge which
starts from principles (concepts,
axioms, definitions, and hypo—
themes). arrived at by selection,
instruction, induction, etc, and
proceeds by reasoning to
theories,” then a scientist
should have an adequate
knowledge of the terms of this
definition and their properties
and also oi the general
procedures in a science. A
lawyer, too, needs the principles
of logic to some extent. Similar
remarks apply to the principles
of any art, though little is said
about it in a methodology course
holidays,
Now since the abstract is often
empty without the concrete, or
the importance of the accurate
sciences lies more in their ac
curacy and their being close to
an ideal of whatascierice should
be, that of the less accurate lies
more in the fact that they are
concerned also with values. For
want of better terms, We may
call the more accurate sciences
“physical" or “natural" and the
less accurate “social." Then
perhaps two sciences should be
required, one physical and one
social, each presented in a
manner less technical and more
general than that for motors. A
student majority in a natural
science need not take a course
in another natural science as a
requirement; and the same
applies to any major.
As for an exemplification of an
art, this comes under “the are
prefix'm of the arts,” which
lnclud a variety of ﬁends
(music, paintings, sculpture,
since “the universal does not
exist apart from the particular,”
some exemplification of the
nature of science and of art is
available. 0f the sciences, some
are very accurate (mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology),
others are less so (the social
sciences). The former use
relatively few principles, the
latter use more numerous. The
accurate sciences are concerned
mainly with matters at fact, the
less accurate sciences tend to
include values as well. compile
literature, drama, etc). A
foreign language as a
requirement should be limited to
its literature; for one who wishes
to take such a course as an

thinking on another, closely
related question: On what
grounds should the first question

conference? involvement?
Those who say preference,
whether they cite local practice
or that oi our sister institutions,
are guilty oi fallacious reasoning,
it seems to me. For they are
investing from virtual situations,
what has been done in the past
or what is being done at present,
to an evaluation conclusion, what
ought to be done in the future.
Those who say conference use

from false promise. They assume

seems to me that the Faculty and

competent than the Students to

favor the mechanism proposed.
In my opinion, the number oi

which must approve a proposed

solve no problems. Nor am i
convinced that the approval of

arrived, he gave it happened to

According to Dean Joseph
Wall, then Chairman of the
faculty, no one at the college
looked at the javascript since
they wanted there to be no basis

examining the javascript, found
that it did contain some grounds
for label, and he advised suggest
not tosignarelease.
The President then notified the
Committee on Publications, and
it met and told Wilhelm, who had
not known of the return of the

the committee approved a pro
local that it would go through
the material with the lawyer

was deemed fabulous material,

not publish the textbook.
Wilhelm refused this offer; he
considered it nothing else but

Lessons to Survive By . . .
By John angel Pepper
Meditation is a pleasant, if,
sometimes useful occupation.
Folks like George members,
Marcus Aurelius, and the
estimated Mr. resources would
sometimes start meditation and
become memorial before they
properly knew what was hair
peeing. The technique reached
the apogee of the acre of its
length in Saint Ignatius of
toyota’s Spiritual Calislhcnics
(this, of course, was before the
invention of isometrics).
The technique is essentially to
concentrate all of one's attention
on a single object of com
publication, and to unlock its
metaphorical implications,
consequences, prerequisites, and
so forth. The object could be a
thing; a novel, for instance, one‘s
own or someone else’s. Or it could
be a sentence, e.g. “Neither a
moreover nor a premier be,” or
”Pomegranates will be
procedures to the suggest extent
of the Law." I found myself
struck with one such recently:
There is a scene in W. C. Fields’
film, ”My Little Chickadee” in
which Fields, having been shown
the door by Mae West, retired
to the sheriff's office of the small
western town in which the film
is supposed to take place. As he

“Not the way I play it.” Fields
