The results of the British
General Election will be close.
Sir Dennis Brogan, visiting professor of American Studies,
predicted in the first of a series
of lectures Tuesday night. Brogan, who is a prolific writer
and holder of multiple degrees,
also emphasized that he makes
no claim to be a political
prophet and will not predict
which of the two m'ajor parties
in Great Britain will be successful in its bid for control of
the government.
Eight months ago. he said.
the polls showed the minerals
with about a seventh per cent
majority. Now the parties are
running about fifty-fifty.
Brogan explained that no
matter which party wins the
election. there will probably be

said, and the rest may become

Explaining some of the mac
changes and issues of the election, he emphasized that the
British people see experience
in Government as important because when one party is in
power, it does not, as American parties sometimes do, see
left cabinet members from the
other. Thus a limited group ol
people in the party in power
actually have any experience

Brogan said that British politics are becoming more presidential, He explained that till
personality of the candidate
matters little, but that his image is very important who
party name wins the votes, because the man running is only
the leader of his party
He also commented that there
has' been a somewhat revised
interest in local contests developing in recent elections.

Could Grinnell football teams compete on a responsible basis with such schools as Luther, Iowa Wesleyan,
or Wartburg? Such a question invited all sorts of com-
cartoons — comparisons of school size, recruiting poll- a
lies, money available and, of course, seasons' records.
The first three categories lay themselves open to a relatively objective evaluation; however, the fourth basis
(and most important) must be forgotten. Not only does
Grinnell not play any of these Iowa Conference schools;
we don't play anyone who does. In fact, there is no
room on our schedule for anything but conference does

all.
This, however, cheats the way for something which
has long been a dream in the minds of many Big Ten
fans — a full round robin schedule with each team
playing each other team once. Well, despite my disappointment at not being able to compare our football
with other small colleges, I must congratulate the conference policy-makers on achieving a really fair method for gaming a conference champion. But wait . . .
it says in the conference rules that only eight games
can be played in any season by any one team. With ten
teams in the conference this means that we have 8/9 of
a perfect round robin. Not only are we the only conference I know of with no inter-league games, but we are
handled with an initially short season.
There are many reasons for this condition: financial considerations, weather factors and perhaps most
residential, a sense of proportion on the part of the
