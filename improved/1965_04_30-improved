Walker said, "usually executed

The student was charged with
violation of the general conduct

Defense counsel Gerald forward
revealed that Thompson had told
the student he “did not consider
it a serious offense." Thompson
said, “However, I worlds’t want
anybody to go away thinking that
it is a contamination that the student was brought to court.” He
said the student was not behavior

College, as admissions oﬂitems are find of

it straight line at right angels to a piece at paper
to plan the current issue of the 553. We generally
‘ have printed forms for that purpose — terms that
we import trim a world where right angels and
straight lines are not alien.
"John," I said to my editor. “John. where is

“T-square7" he said lncredlllously. “We don’t
have a T~square. What do you need a T—square for?"
"For page layout,"
“Oh, my God, are we cut or those printed terms
that we import from a world where right angels

directed me to the art building.
I found one of the art processors standing blisstully in north light carefully studying a painting

Well, of course I pushed forward, hand extended.

stage I managed to squeeze in . . .
“Do you have a T-sellers, a right angle?"
He looked really hurt. "A T-square, a right
angle? You jerk. The Grinnell art department dress't
use T—studies or right angels. Those are for straight
lines and careers and nothing like that appears
here."
As I left, distributed, he was lovingly studying
the strap or canvas 1 had wired my hands on.
My next stop was the science buildings “Sure,"

Pass-Fail
We would like to suggest that the faculty, administration, and students of Grinnell College do something
original and work toward establishment of a wide«
ranging pass~fail trading system.
The system is self explanation; a student would be
given one of two grades — pass or fail. This would be
the penultimate in trading plans and would supplies
the many varieties of number and letter systems. The
final step, of course, would be no grades, but it seems
that you just don’t get your $2,600 worth if you don’t
get a card with some grade rotation on it.
Carleton has recently extended a pass-fail system
to “courses for which the conventional trading system
might be deemed inappropriate.” This would include
courses like creative writing, studio art, and advanced
seminars.
Earlier, Carleton had given (and still gives) its
students the option of taking one course per semester
on the pass-fail plan. This system is designed to allow
students to take courses outside their motors without
fear of hunting their grade-point operates.
When Carleton institutes the pass-fail system,
concerned people there saw growing out of the normal
letter trading system, a “social infringement which
. resulted from the excessive competition for grades
in course work," One faculty member felt that the
new system was potentially of special benefit to “a
small, somewhat geographically isolated, residential
college like Carleton (which can‘t be more isolated
than Grinnell) in reviewing that “social estrangementr”
While it may be argued that Grinnell needs’t follow Carleton in every step it takes, it is not pleasant
that a school which purposes to be a leading liberal
arts college in the country generally wants for other
schools to do the experimenting in matters of higher
import than liberal arts examinations for seniors.
Carleton is not the only school experimenting
with pass-fail, Washington University in St. Louis is
studying the possibilities of such a plan San Jose State
in California offers its freshmen a modified rio-grade
tutorial system. The California Institute of Technology
has established a pass-fail system for freshmen to ease
freshman transition into college life.
We would like to suggest that the established system of grade-giving is provide a big playback in every
area except, perhaps, in a student’s major. Retention of
the standard trading system for studentsY areas of coilcentration should satisfy those who argue that the new
system might engineer admission into graduate school,
since a student’s major grades are presumably the most
important part of his transcript.
It has been mentioned, too, that a pass-fail system
might lesson motivation, Unfortunately, the present
system stresses motivation for grade-training rather
than for learning a subject well because it is a subject
the students want to learn,
As a Carleton professor noted, with the establishment of a pass-fail trading system, “the pressure to
obtain the reward of a better grade might well be replaced by the challenge of an opportunity to master or
to sample as much of the knowable as one is able, while
pricing, as a genuine community of scholars, more
.deeply and more widely into unknown areas. This
would be a requesting environment in which to live,"
The drawbacks of the present system become more
apparent as mounting instruments throughout the corn»
try cause increased competition that may not be ap—
parent to administrators in their booty positions or to
l the students who have no choice but ’to accept the competition cr lose the status that their hard-fought-for
700 plus board scores gave them.
Our proposal, then, would be for Grinnell to set up
a pass-fail trading system for all subjects except those
in a student's major. We understand that informal di
session among faculty members on the matter of trading systems is potential; we would urge formal dis—
emissions by faculty, administration, and students.
It is time to work out a realistic means of image-
;meeting a pass-fail trading system, and there is no
reason why Grinnell shouldn’t. be a leader in this area.

german Sees Intellectual Potential
In More Faculty-Student Contact
To the Editor:
Just today a list canon into my
hands that was compiled earlier
in the year by the Board ot precision. For some reason it was
never distributed to the student
body, at least to my knowledge.
I don’t know how the list was
compiled or what the circumstances were that motivated those
who undertake making it up, but
i do know that in the idea behind
its being drawn up is the remedy
for a problem that exists now on
the Grinnell campus.
Quite simply the list consists of
members of the faculty who would
\he willing to interface students. or
just talk and discuss with them
outside of the classroom. Beside
many of the names are listed interests that these people have,
ranging from Indians of the Southwest to astronomy.
Freshmen training on campus
must really feel created to find
the sad state or affairs that student-faculty relations are in out:
side of the classroom. For the
most part, the contact students
have with their instructors is
limited to the three or four hours
they spend in class with him or
her each week. Somewhere there
is a ritt that keeps any further
Contact from even‘ developing.
Even in the new Forum one
notices immediately two segregated groups of coffee printers 7
inc ltd and students. The recent
series of student-few v courses
un Thursday and Friday after
books which were designed to
break down this barrier have been
[or the most part total flows in
this respect. Only two or three
faculty members ever show up
at all (despite the fact that simultaneously, large groups of them
are paying for their coffee and
secretariat themselves in a corner ot the grill). Even the few
brave souls who do come rarely
return.
students don’t help bridge
this gap either. Too often anyone
who is seen talking to a professor
is accused of “all'owmnosmg” or
trying to pad his gradepoint. In
typical society of his peers it
can‘t be understood that he or

and have a genuine interest in
his opinions on a subject. We have

Brogan Views Quaint Grinnell
“Grinnell r . . is set in the little
town of Grinnell and is, in fact,
the main and almost only economic certification for the exist»
once of the town." so said Sir
penis Brogan (now returned to
civilization) about his home for
three months last year.
Brogan gathered an article about
(.vl'innell town and college which
was featured in the Feb. 13 issue
of a Glasgow, Scotland, newspaper and which round itself appear
ing in the Grinnell Herald Register
(a “parochial” newspaper, but demanding Brogan of the “authors
glen informed” of his youth) on
April 15.
The article concluded by claim»
ing that “either Main Street was
not as bad as Sinclair Lewis pre»
tender or it has easily improved in
the last 40 years.
in reading the feature, the Grinnellian is often led to wonder why
Brogan feels there has been any
 
progress, but can only conclude
that what might be taken as write—
costs by iowa printers are actually endear-meets to the buddy gentleman from the Old World
Brogan noted that his proposed
stay in the bathrooms probably
caused a star in the civilized world
and that “sophisticated friends in
Washington or San Francisco or
New York would have been no
more surprised if we had gone to
the Congo than to rural Iowa."
Brogan did have some sympathy
with the college’s promotion ascii»
cultural makeup. “The campus
contains buildings of every style,
from the must delicious Victorian
bonus Romanesque to extremely
elegant modern Bauhaus conversations."
But-line library‘s.stock (not the
colonial kind) was Considered good,
“by our (British) standards."
According to Brogan, the college has integrated customs regarding the sites. He observed.

The town itself “is in What the
Americans would call ‘a blind' "
because of the business loss caused
by Interstate 30. Further, “it is
not surprising that they (townspeople) are the main supporters of
Goldwaterism."
And as a tender, understanding
note, Brogan mentioned that “there
were rather teaching examples of
the desire to build up the local
‘merchant’ class. Every shop and
store had a label on the door reading either ‘Push for Grinnell’ or
‘Pull for Grinnell,’ depending on
how the doors opened and shut."
Even the terrorism hash’t been
removed from the frontier. To be
sure, “there was crime in various
parts of the state, if not in price
well, a good deal or embezzlement,
a good deal of drunkenness ending
in violence and sometimes in
death, a certain amount of financing, and even something or the
vice which Macauley optimistically said ‘nature classes to name.’ ”
But Brogan held some hope for
the Midwestern wilderness. The
people, he says, are friendly, the
Dutch Elm disease hash’t gotten

Lion and East Anglia, the settings

Production of ‘Tea & Sympathy'
Demonstrates Director's parents
By Don scratch
Bruce McConachie is a talented young man. The president oi the Grinnell Players
has previously proved his ability as an actor, and alter this
week's production of Robert
Anderson's Tea and Sympathy
has shown a left capacity for
direction.
The most remarkable aspect
of McConachie’s effort was his
handling of the set. The bi-level
structure was corporate, yet
tastefully appropriate, and
made the suggest possible use of
the limited space in Arena Theatre. But for a few seats on
the side, which were partially
cut oil by a large table lamp.
there were no bad places to sit
within the semicircular arrangement of the audience.
In the roles of Bill and Laura
Reynolds, movie earned and
Georgia ticket worked well
together, The irreconcilable
conflict between the two was
clear—named as the underlying schoolmaster, afraid that
the “queerness” he thought he
saw in one of his students might
be part of his own nature, and
Miss ticket as the sympathec
ic Wife who understood her husband, but who was unable to
celebrate the shell he had
drawn over himself. Perhaps
 
earned could have varied the
delivery of his lines some, and
have come out a little less onedimensiunal, and Miss ticket
might have tried letting her
arms leave her sides occasion—
ally, but in general the two
were strong, and periodically
dramatic.
As the industry accused Ton-i
Lee, Dan Burns came across
as the sensitive, misunderstood
student. Though there may have
been some difficulty in determining how much of the obvious nervousness was turns',
and how much was part of the
characterization, he did sun—
need in creating a feeling of
general sympathy with his
problems.
The two most consistent and
effective characters in the play
were billy years, played by
Judy Ginsberg, and Al, played
by Dan Mason. Miss Ginsberg
made the most other small part
as the tastefully vacations shirt,
and Mason was perfect as the
rocky, understanding roommate.
There were a few lines
“dropped," a few “thrown
away,” and several technical
fluffs, but overall, the play
was very removable And the
producing and direction job by
McConachie was truly noteworthy.

From MAMA,

It has came to my attention that
some people are in discover with
my article of last week. which is
all right in itself. but most of them
have misinterpreted the point of
the article, or, more specifically,
one paragraph.
The purpose of this column is
not indiscriminately to criticism
Grinnell athletes and is certainly
not to criticism individual Grinnell
athletes. Its real purpose is to
point out businesses in the Grinnell sports system. The views 1
take are originally surely my
own, but I have found a great majority agree with me.
In my experience with college
baseball and other baseball of
similar culture, it has always
seemed advantageous for the many
ages or one of his assistance to
coach third base. For from third
base he can keep a tight control
on the game with the signs he
gives to the battery, his signals to
the baserunners, and so forth.
So Morgan Michel was actually
a victim of circumstances. He
happened to be the third base
coach when I was watching the
game. What I said in the article
was that no one but coach deutsch
or another coach should be on
third.
From the baseball team I have
heard Morgan is now an assistant
coach and so is capable of taking
the responsibilities of the third
base coach. I send my congratulations,
Now if some people question other parts of the article, they can
bring up their questions with me,
and, if necessary, ! may spend the
last month of the school year explaining my ideas.
As for this week's article, I am
sure glad that Morgan himself has
a cooler head than some other
people, especially two of his
friends who visited me last Friday
night, or i would probably be in
no shape to write this article now.
in a better letter I received Wednesday, signed by The Baseball
Team — although i highly doubt
everyone had a part in this — it
was suggested among other things
that I should perhaps transfer to
plymouth or maybe become a
coach next year.
Unfortunately I have already
paid my $50 and am planning to
draw for a room next Monday.
And I am sure the sports budget
would not allow another coach,
