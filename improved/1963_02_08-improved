What is wrong with Grinnell?’

When Stephen Wood, clean or

of House treatments why things
are full at Grinnell, he touched
off a discussion that might
have been called “What is
' Wrong with Grinnell?"
One suggestion was that in-1

may have called easy going
persons li-om among Grinnell
students. In short Grinnell has
lost its “laws."
An opposite idea was the
thought that living has become
too easy and that since the
only struggle we race is the
unpleasant task oi periodically
attending classes, there is not
enough challenge to the student.

Another suggestion was that a

"By now, most of the published dutch'its arising from
President women’s November pronouncement that there
will be no rule changes this year have died down. Perhaps
with the subscribe of sessions we can better see what the
lasting effect of that decision will be.
In reality its real importance is not that we won’t
have discrimination of the drinking rule or women’s hours
this year, nor that the decision was made by administrative

seems to many of us that if this is the effect the Ford

Before the Ford drive began, it was thought that one
of the aims of the college was to provide an atmosphere of
intellectual freedom, where a student could pursue anal
idea to its logical conclusion, no matter how unpopularl
that idea might be with the public. i
But now the students are presented from pursuant the‘
idea of li examination of rules to the logical end of presenting specific proposals, because the administration fears
that it will discounted the public from contributing to the
college’s fund drive.
Before the possibility of a Ford grant was considered,
Grinnell distinguished itself from most of the colleges in
the country by its attitude toward intellectual freedom. It
didﬁfired from those colleges that brown upon religious unorthodoxy; it suffered from colleges like Beloit which re—

What, after all, are we “literally educated” scudcnisl
Not only do some students fail
to respond “enthusiastically" to
an interim session for “independent study," but some fail to
respond in that manner to any
study. Witness the English students making only female attempts in science, and the science students doing likewise in
literature. As if this were not

but of no real concept of what
a student is. This is certainly
not a characteristic of the intellectually curious student. Why
even come to school?
This whole attitude toward
study shows a false concept of
education, for study becomes the
means by which one acquired a
grade, and the grade is the
means into graduate school, and
so forth up the ladder of “success." This, perhaps, is the rev-
over the ideas we discuss here because they may alienate
those who donate to the college. When that happens, Grinnell College will probably be rich, but certainly not distinguished.
Let’s brandon the policy that has driven since then
of trying to stable discussion of embarrassing ideas in order to protect the college’s reputation. Let’s return to the
goal of intellectual freedom, return to the goal of becoming,
one of the great intellectual institutions of the country, a
goal which the Ford Foundation, in 1961 at least, thought‘
we had the potential to achieve.

By Karen Adkilson
8&3 Feature Writer
“In appreciation a picture in
the Schaeﬁer Gallery, the intellectual and emotional aspects
oi the picture often observe the
physical factors. After carrying
a hundred paintings upstairs for
an exhibit though, the physical
aspect takes on more importance," Mr. Robert McMillan
(art) commented.
in financing a show the pictures are operated in the receiving room, carefully trans.
posted to the Schaeffer Gallery
and leader against the walls.
Then a process of “musical pictures" begins as the show is
settled into a cleaning and logical arrangement.
“We look for sympathetic
relationships of size, color,
content, dimensional movement
within the painting and so
north when we hang the
works. Some items obviously
are in a series and typically

delicious sharing oi a particularly institute painting will
keep it isolated from flashing

the group," Mr. McMillan explainsﬂi ”Panels of colored

l Developing the exhibit schedule begins a year in advance
when information about loan
exhibitions is collected from
public and private galleries. Although the particular shows for
the coming year are selected
sight unseen, reviews, description material and general knowledge of artists and styles helps
the art departure to know
what the exhibit will be like,
and contracts are arranged in
the spring,
A variety both in materials
and styles between specific
shows is emphasized in order to
put Grinnell students in contact
with many significant works of
art. Home grown shows such as
the Grinnell Alumni
of last year or the upcoming

their intrinsic interest and to
