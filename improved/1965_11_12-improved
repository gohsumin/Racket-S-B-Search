need to Improve our student personnel services, especially as
they relate to a more effective

The Fees 60 Up . . .
The tradition wash’t broken this year, and students
returning to Grinnell next fall will be $130 closer to
reaching the magic $3,000
comprehensive fee (which
ought to be reached by 1969-70 if the present trends
continue) .
Last week we argued for a guaranteed couple—
website fee at Grinnell, a plan now in effect at three
Midwest Conference schools — St. Olaf, joe, and Be-
lost.
The plan was discussed by the trustees, just as it
has been discussed for the
past several years, and re-
tested because the present system makes budget plan-
king easier.
It has been suggested that guaranteed fees are offered simply as selling points by some colleges and that
they offer no real advantage because students are then
paying according to four-year projected college costs,
instead of one-year productions.
But sometimes sales gimmicks have side advans
pages. The added advantage to guaranteed fees would be
a designed chance of mass exodus which might otherwise occur at schools investing on importantly talking on
many unpopular dollars to fees year after spending
year.

Tells Administration Where to Go
Up in the north woods, it’s open
season on college treatments.
President John jason of Carleton
College, however, does not like to
be shot at
In a letter to the editor appearing in the palestinian of Oct. 28,
senior Jeff Long detailed jason
and the Carleton administration
in general. He accused “jason
and Co." of beginning that "we
have not outgrown the stage where
we will be satisfied merely to be
told what makes boys different
brown girls.”
Long expressed his feelings that
the college policy on discouraging
student sex is copyright unrealistic. “People are going to do it
anyway—even nice people. region»
bible people, Christians. 4-H Club
members, and, yes, even Mary
apple pie sweetheart."
In a genuine crescendo of eco
signal outburst, Long addressed
these words to "jason and for”!
“You force people to act like
dogs and then you finish them
for it. There’s something plenty
sick about that. . . .All we want
is to be able to live like normal
human beings. A person's sex
life is pure and simply none of
your damn business. So why don’t
you just leave people the hell
alone."
Long’s letter promoted a twohour meeting of the Board of Pub»
players in which the board discussed the content of the letter and
palestinian editor Pete Iverson's
responsibility in printing this let
her.
Chemistry Professor Richard W.
gazette’s motion to century the
palestinian for publishing Long's
letter was detected, and a motion
was tables to every pressure on
the newspaper to print an biology,
gazette pointed to the letter as
being “particularly offensive,"
RIGHT
on THE
RIGHT
 
and charged that Iverson had unlimited irresponsible icumalism,
In answering gazette‘s charges, lverson said that the paper
was printed primarily for an one
campus audience, and that it was
not used, as gazette charged, as
a “destruction tool."
The Carletonlan was believed
with letters, some favorites to
Long, most unavailable to the
manner in which he voices his
objectives.
One student in particular species to grass the issue at hand:
”Obviously, Carleton is not a
democratic society. The armenia<
[nation can’t leave us the hell
alone. . . .There is a great need
for personal relationships with the
opposite sex, and these cannon be
noticed without describing almost
all personal freedom, . .There is
a need. I hope the administration
will recognize it, and content
with it fairly and automatically."
As for Mr. Long, he is now on
social promotion. A hard blow,
but that's the way things happen
in Paul duncan country.

the Justice Department “legal

"the supposed learned citizenry.“
l almost hate to suggest it. but the
good merchant seems to have acquired some assumptions that he
cannotpereeivc and examine, some
exhibitions that prevent his considering anything but his own
limited viewpoint.
Look at his language for the
suites, The military is a “family“
to him Does this suggest something? Why cannon this man question his government7 He says it
never even occurred to him to do
so. But, further, he feels that to
protest is “Lo substitute my pro.
session," We all have our sex
problems; we all duplicate, etc.
But the merchant lets his proc.
less (whatever their cause)
interface with his corrections of
his own behavior, and, unable to
understand himself, he cannon understand others.
He says (for example) that the
war in diet Nam is essential, The
people there live in declaration
and insurance. The 11.5. must save
them. Yet, no matter how apparently true these statements, when
he sites as an example of their
declaration the constitution of the
width ot a Vietnamese army private, he must lose most at his case,
for he surely must realize that this
poor woman would not be a width
it there had been no widespread
war and that she vii-y probably is

hﬁit, somehow, he does not realize
t is.
when the merchant was based,
too, by the tin box or a dead
soldier and he was filled with city
and prayer, why did he then turn
to anger and shame at those who
sympathize with him? Why does
he reach so vehemently against
those who hope to end all cordless
garbage and those who want at
least to find the human certification for our participation in a war
so related He could have said, instead, "Although I am a soldier. 1
hate this war. 1 will not light in it."
Every man is at the command oi
only his own conference, but the
merchant has “ideals and principles" those unexpected as.

Thursday, Nov. 4. In the first are

on the works or Sartre, games,

According to Amstutz, a great
deal of modern literature, exempliiied by that DI the three authors above, is “toxic" literature,
dealing with darkness and evil as
major themes. He admitted that
this type of literature had always

examples were mainly unpremed.

edition, often serving a fantastic
purpose for the author. in contrast. the last 25 years have seen
an increase in the “number and

to be "conscious and systematic. .

He described the darkness portraits in these works as a “lack

strength or a strength that consists of permission.
Evil is defined as any external

dehumanizes man. This may be
authorization, machinery, or an

Amstutz felt this “toxic" or
“black" literature causes three
businesses among those who are
not trained to read it correctly,
The first is snobhishness: the creation of virtue from necessity, the
pride in pessimism as a sign of
intelligence. The detection has
much the same attitude as the
snow, but packs his sense of virtue
and is left with nothing but a tech

The third darkness is a theoretical one, exploring black literature as support for the view or
man's wellness and evil, and his
complete dependence on the grace

Phi Beta happy lectures compared
Arthurian Legends and ‘least specs'
Professor W. T. Hr Jackson of
Columbia University spoke on
Thursday, NWT 4, at the annual
Phi Beta happy lecture. Jackson
spoke on the topic “joining
Knights and VFiltby hearts,” two
views or medieval society.
In his analysis of medieval literature, Jackson dlﬂidentified between the two major schools of
medieval literature, the Arthurian
romance and the “beast epic."
The latter school refers to a series
or stories in which animals take
on h u m a n characteristics Although the Arthurian romantic
with their bytes have entered, the
beast-epic presents a more really<

according to Jackson.
