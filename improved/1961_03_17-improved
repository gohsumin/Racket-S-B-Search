Let Us See For Ourselves
Last night a state department interpreted. in an anti,

lecture, “If you’d go to Cuba, you’d see that things were
bad."
This week a petition printed by the Fair Play For
Cillia Committee, but not officially api rated with that
group, which has no chapter on campus, is being calculated among students and faculty.
The petition directed at President Kennedy pages
a re sign in tile state department policy of mortality for
ward Cuba. It suggests that diplomatic and t kde relations
be restored and that the human people be permitted to determine their own destiny without interference from any
outside sources. More important, but continuing upon its
other prev signs, the petition suggests that the 1; \\'Cl ban
on (‘nba be listed.
The petition does not encourage an Ollt‘mill-Ollt sand-.
tion of Castro practices and policies; rather, it slide; s
that it is to was ' to draw wrong conclusions from an arm
chair hundreds of miles away from the area of convention.
relying only upon ”interpreters" and our “sometimes l'l'ee
pre s.”
if the state department is so convinced that “Castroland” is “bad,” Interested students at Grinnell and throughout the U.S. are only asking ”Won't you let us be truly
American? Won’t you let us see for ourselves?”
