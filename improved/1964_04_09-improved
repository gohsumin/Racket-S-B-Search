The two rock Conventions being held this week
have involved the work of many students. This issue of
the S & B is an example. Initial planning for the issue
took place in January, assignments for copy were distributed in February and March, and the bulk of the
copy was in before Spring Vacation. Almost all of the
work has been done by Young Republicans and Young
Democrats who are in charge of some phase of prepare-
-tion for the convention. A special not of thanks must
go to Tom builder who was over-all supervisor of all
the material going into this
convention issue The date
of publication was advanced so that the paper would
reach the students just prior to the start of the convention. We would like to congratulate Mr. Gilmour, the
PPPE, and all of the students who have put so much
time and effort into the rock Political Conventions,
and we would hope that all
students, whether they are
generates or just disorders, would take advantage of
this practical political experience.
 
Approval of early platforms
Included in rock Conventions
By Jack Spence
The Democratic platform
should receive attention un—
preferences in Grinnell rock
Political Conventions. The absence of a raceJor the Presidential nomination in the Democratic rock Convention will
permit more time for serious
consideration and debate on
the various plants of the platform.
The Democratic platform
committee expects likely debate on issues such as admin
sign of Red China to the United Nations, Civil Rights. aid to
parochial schools, and diet
Nam.
Several contradictory goals
make the job of Writing a platform for the rock Convention
as difficult one. One goal is educational. The various sublime
matters do extensive research
and write plants over broad
‘- areas. But these plants must
also be limited by the time limit considerations at the convention. Also, they must brandon,
to a certain extent, the similarly approach in favor of a
more colorado presentation at
the convention, a presentation
which will Create interest, could'oversy, and debate.
The goals of the PPPE and
the rock Convention indicate
that the process of relating the
platform and containing for
votes on various positions are
easily as important a function
as the educational function of.
researchers and writing that
platform.
The Democratic platform will
be presented to the convention

Formed behind the slovak,
"Republicans Act.” the platform for the Republican rock
Convention will be presented at
the Republican platform session tomorrow afternoon The
document begins by reaffirming
acceptance to the basic pain»
cities of Republicanism: (l)
the importance of the individual, (2) equal rights and opportunities for all, (3) limited government, and (4) fiscal responsibility.
With regard to areas of specific application, the platform
promises a much stronger and
more directed foreign policy
Republicans believe that the
practice of tile United States
has fallen badly in the last
four years. They feel that indication and confusion can be
held mainly responsible for this
decline.
In the area fo civil rights.
Republicans point with pride to
the fact that all of the major
elements of the civil rights bill
passed in the House had been
first proposed in Republican
legislation. recognition the
need for even stronger action,
the Republican p arts has
pleased to move ahead in sec
during equal rights and opporr
tunitles for all.
Action in domestic affairs
will center around a return to
fiscal responsibility and limited
government. It is a long-held
Republican View that the government’s initial responsibility
is to assure an economic email'r
moment conducted to the growth
and strengthening of the free

AGOP Comments on Issues; Wants
Equal Chance for Success for All
. By Phil Johnson
No man's freedom is secure
until all men are free. The goal
of the members of the republic
can Party is to bring equal opportunity to every man. Not
every man jul succeed in all
of his limitations in life, but
his success Or failure should
be the result of his personal
facilities as a man, not of a
impressive social system, of
legal restrictions, of a lack of
educational opportunities, or of
object poverty. ~
Civil rights is the most urgent
issue in our domestic life. All
forms of racial discrimination
must be destroyed. Each indi»
visual Is entitled to equal treaty
ment by all other Americans,
whether by government officials or by other citizens. He
should be able to vote, live
where he choices, worklwherr
ever he is qualified, and use
any public facility on the same
basis as any other citizen.
The circle of poverty and
insurance which kinds so many
fellow Americans must be broken, Educational opportunities
must be provided to the capable but poor, Training and
placement aid must be extended
to those who do not presently
have the skills to participate
in modern industry. expressed
areas must be helped back on
their feet, to enable them to
make positive contributions to
the nation.
Wherever possible, these matters should be dealt with by
local or state governments,
since the federal government is
notoriously inefficient and incredible in operation. However
some states have refused to assume th e i r responsibilities.
Some have themselves actively
isolated the principles of equality which are the strength of our
society. In these cases, there is
no alternative but federal ace
lion,
 
 
In foreign policy, similar
principles apply. The developing nations should be added in
reaching economic and political
growth and stability, to the
end that they will become
sound and autonomous citizens
of the world community.
communist, as it Is price
tired by the Soviet blog, is a
direct hypothesis of all principles of freedom, both for individuals and for nations. It
must be register actively on all
prints.
Government itself must be
turned of the corruption re
sealed by the standard of this
administration. The relationships and obstructionists now
controlling the Democratic
Congressional machine should
be replaced by men various to
serve the nation and the principles of equality which give it
strength.
It is to this end that the Republican Party is dedicated in
1964.
 
Aim of Democrats to Continue.
And Expand illustrated Policy
By Marilyn Alt
At this time, the analysis of
campaign issues is difficult
and must be incomplete It
seems most wise to touch on
those issues which are our»
gently receiving the attention
of the Democratic Party. The
aims of the Democratic pro»
gray are a confirmation and
expansion of policies illustrated during the past four
years.
The arabic death of President
Kennedy in November was a
blow not only to Democrats,
but to the country and the
world. His youthful leadership
had brought a minor to American politics which had not been
seen for many years. However,
the accent of london Johnson
has brought few major
changes. President Johnson
has already demonstrated his
love for and ability in the game
of politics, his commitment to
the programs of President Kenr
nedy, and his willingness to
present policy changes of his
own.

In addition, President Johnson
has moved to cut expenditures
in many other secretary areas.
These are only examples of
continuing Democratic progress in the economic sphere.
The field of CiVil rights is
one of the most pressing law»

Under strong Democratic leads

area. At present the sleeping
civil rights bill is on the verse
of passage and will be passed
before the Congress adjourns
this summer, Passage of this
bill is only a beginning. and
Democrats pledge their continuing support to the fight for
equal rights for all citizens.
Of equal importance is the
current educational crisis. The
number of students pursuant a
higher education is increasing
each year. As the popular ‘baby

problem Will become even
more acute. The federal government first be willing to
meet lhls challenge. The last

higher educational facilities,
and an increase in funds available for Student loans. We
pledge our continuing supply
to these and similar programs.
In the field of foreign affairs,
the Democratic Party pleased
its full support to the maintenance of our position as leader
of the free world. In an age

such as ours, foreign policy
must be one of strength with

reached in the road to peace
with the negotiation and notification of the Test Ban Treaty

Peace Corps during the last

major step.
There are many other areas
which are of major concern to

polyester Speaks
By Mark terminals
The votes cannon expect to
agree with a candidate's total
philosophy, only with his monitor
cal philosophy. Moreover, a
vote for a candidate does not
necessarily enlarge his entire
political position, only his basic
political principles, Principles
are important, for it is only in
terms of principles that a candidate can offer us a program
and indicate his future course,
not by floating instructions and
contradictory promises about
a miscellaneous Collection of
concrete, short-term issues.
Views on whether the United
States should or should not
withdraw from the United Nations are not principles; views
on whether a nation should or
should not protect its governments are printer1e5#principles that cover many issues
besides the U, N.
Thus, a principle is an instruction which subsumes a
great number of completed. It
is only by means oi principles
that men can judge the alternatives contracting them and project their future. If a candidate does not integrate pieces
meal goals into conceptual
terms, but rather products his
campaign in terms of completed, he requests the voters
to hand him a blank check for
power. If a candidate grades,
equivocates and sides his stand
under a junkrheap oi random
completed, it is impossible to
predict his future course of action.
With this as a standard, it is
easy to see why Senator Barry ,
polyester is the best candidate
in the field today. The major
difference between
and his opponents is this: They
believe that some elements of
freedom are compatible with
government controls; he be
pieces that some government
controls are compatible with -’
freedom, In the conference of a

choice and creativity. I stand

campaign. His direction is
right.
He considers a Civil right “a
right that is assisted and is
therefore protected by some
Valid law," and adds, “There
may be some rights that should
 
also be civil rights. But if we
desire to give such rights the
protection of the law, our resource is to a legislature or to
the amendment procedure of
the Constitution. In the dealtime, we must recognize the
States’ jurisdiction in certain
areas. The definition of States'
Rights is clear in the Constitution. ”The powers not generated
to the United States by the
Constitution nor prohibited by
it to the States are reserved to
the States respectively, or to
the people.” Throughout the
present “civil rights“ controversy, for example, States'
Rights implies ”That the States
have a right to act, or not to
act, as they see fit."
Underlying these legal pre<
cents is the notion that “esserb
really local problems are best
dealt with by the people most
directly concerned” polyester has repeatedly said: “We
can’t pass a law that will make
you like me or me like you.
This has to be done between
us." He makes a sharp distinction between the civil rights
that are guaranteed under the
Constitution and the rights of

moral issues and cannon be
solved simply by passing unenforceable laws.

FDR Influences Senate Service.
Helps Shape Background of [B].
Dems' Only Presidential Candidate
Four years ago the Grinnell
charles and Black ran an article on each of the hopefuls for
President. Side by side were
printed articles about John F.
Kennedy and london B, John
son, two men whose backgrounds were easily different.
yet whose futures were to be
inextricably interpreted.
Johnson processed those
"bubble beginnings” which
are supposed such an asset in
JOHNSON
political life. Born the oldest
child of a frontier Texas translator in 1908, Johnson spent his
boyhood in a land of poverty.
He was quick to sense the necessity of hard work and education and worked his way
through Southwest Texas State
Teachers College by holding
down sometimes as many as
{our jobs. In college he ma»
world in government and history, was student body president and a campus leader.
Johnson’s Washington career
began in the opening days of
the New Deal when he became
employed there as an assistant to a Texas compression.
During his stay in Washington,
where he became known as
one of the best assistance on
Capitol Hill, he met two people
who were to have a proposed
affect on his life: Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Claudia Taylor,
known since childhood as
"Lady Bird.”
At the age of 25 Johnson temporarily left Washington to
take over the state directorship
of the National Youth Admins
operation. In this capacity he
helped many students make
their way through school in de»
pressing years and set the pre-]
c e d e n t of establishing an:
N. Y. A. program for metro
months in Texas. It was from
this post that he designed to ,re«
turn to Washington in 1937 following his first successful campaign for Congress.
His friend of earlier Washing
ton days, Roosevelt, did not
forget him and in 1940 when
Democratic control of me
House was threatened, it was
to Johnson that F, D. R. commented the national campaign
to retain a Democratic major-
 
its, Johnson suspended so well
in his task that not only was
the House held in Democratic
control, but the majority was
increased as Well,
Johnson Continued to be a
vigorous New Deal supported
and in 1941 he was la key administration leader in th e
House right for a two-ocean
Navy. It was in this same year
that he announced, from the
White House steps, his candidate for the United States Senate,
When war came in 1941. John»
son Voted for and became the
first member of Congress to
enlist in the war. He won the
Silver Star for gallantry in action while in the South Pacific
and was generated by General
MacArthur. _
With his return to Congress
in 1948 Johnson soon showed
the ability which made him in
1960 the most powerful man in
the Ui S. Senate. The tremendous influence he exercises on
such committees as the Naval
Affairs committee in the House,
Armed Services committees of
both House and Senate, the
Joint Congressional Committee
on Atomic Energy and the Senate Committee on Space and
Astronautices as well as the
fact that downloaded Democrats won overwhelmingly in
1952, '54, and ’56 are russian»
dial proof of his power.
The Johnson appeal of re—
sponsibility, preparedness and
leadership enabled him to win'
every showdown voting test as
majority leader.
The supreme test of his "responsibility, preparedness and
leadership” came on November 22, 1963 when tragedy
called for a man of both personal and political strength and
Johnson was capable of giving
such strength. The strength
which held a country together
for those few dark days has in
no way diminished in recent
months as Johnson has pressed
to secure the goals of our late
President as well as forward»
ing many of his own ideals.

conscious Vice President ti Dangerous luxury for Present,
robert Humphrey Offers Necessary Experience, treatment
By Dennis Murphy
Neither the Republicans nor
the Democrats can longer afford the luxury of nomination
for Vice President conscious
candidates whose sole purpose
is to balance the ticket geoA
graphically, automatically, or
religiously. The man nominated
for Democratic VicevPresidential Candidate must possess all
the ability, experience, and confidence required by the office
of President — and he must
show promise of becoming a
truly great President. It is our
concern belief that Senator Hu—
best Humphrey of Minnesota
shows that promise.
Senator Humphrey holds no
claim to striking good looks;
he does not represent a fabulous northeastern State, Humphrey is, instead, one of the
most residential men in Washington; he is a Liberal without
reservations whose record of
progressive legislation dates
back to his first election office,
“I believe in the liberalism of
advocacy and action," related
Humphrey in an article for the
Phi Beta happy Journal. Liberalism should be related with
“Man’s striking for Civilization
and density." It is a . . philosophy willing to use the state
to achieve freedom."
Few modern political figures
have a record of accomplishments to compare with that of
Senator Humphrey. As Mayor

With the help of Vice-press—

attach the Corps to the foreign aid bill, and to associate
it with the United States Diplo»

To Provide Contrast to Present Administration's minor
Nelson A. powerseller, Governor of New York, is far and

experienced candidate. Turning to an extremely candidate
would not be to the advantage
of the party; the American

Governor powerseller, is the
most qualified person for the
office of president. Six years as
executive head of New York
has certainly given him great
experience in dealing with
problems that an executive
must face, His re-election in
1962, when the Democrats nominated the New York Senate
and House races, showed the
confidence the people of New
York have in him and indicated
their approval of the job he has
done.
Since the problems of the
United 'States—ever-increasing
organization with strong rural
interests—are present in miniature in New York, Governor
powerseller has in the past 6
years been dealing with problems similar to those which
would face him if elected president.
powerseller‘s a o c o investments as governor of N. Y. are
too numerous to mention, but
some of the more outstanding
are: (1) He wired out a $700,000,000 deficit inherited from
the Democratic Administration; (1) By 1962, per Capita
income in the state reached a
new high, about 25% over the
 
national average; (3) School
aid from the state to local
districts nearly coupled from
1958‘t0 1562; (4) accomplished
a more than ten-fold increase
in the housing program for
middle-income families.
powerseller has served as an
side to 3 previous treatments
of the United States, Only 32
years old in 1940, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of
State for Latin American affairs by F, D. R. Later he
played an instrumental part in
planning Truman’s Point Four
foreign aid program, which
many people in Washington re
garden as a powerseller crew
union. Under Eisenhower, he
drew up a blueprint for the
first dept of Health, Education and Welfare, served as its
first vicepresident, planned a
representation of the Defense
Dept. and became assistant in
charge of cold war strategy
powerseller’s political and
administrative experience ‘is
quite diversified. having served
in 2 Democratic and l Republican administrations and 6
years as governor of a politicians let-organized states His
initial job as Assistant Secretary of State has given him
experience in and a knowledge

Stevenson’s only official government association was his
investment in the navy. But in
1933 his service title the Agriculture Adjustment Administration in Washington inaugura

in his post with the Agriculture committee, Stevenson
helped President Roosevelt
construct a program to believe

In 1935, Stevenson left the

Stevenson had proved so valuable that personal politics,
which often covered decisions

not affect his position. Stevenson’s importance would be dramatized during the Eisenhower
administration, when the Re
publicity asked him to serve
with the government. They
called upon Stevenson to act
as an advisor to the Secretary

However, in 1948 Mr, Stevenson left his official post to serve
his party by running for Governor of Illinois. Illinois voters chose Stevenson by the
largest mortality in the traditionally-Republican state's history, and Stevenson repair
their trust in him by bidding the
state’s government of the core

Welfare, in the cabinet of Pres—
event John F. Kennedy.
As Secretary of HEW, Ribi-
conf was responsible for some
of the most ferreaching innovations in the history of the
nation’s health, education, and
welfare.
An entirely new approach to
Welfare operations was institutes by Ribicoff, placing create
er emphasis on prevention and
rehabilitation.
The Social Security system
was improved by Congress’s
._ adoption of Ribicoff’s proposals
RIBICOFF
 
for covering the retirement age
for men as well as for women
to 62, raising men‘recent benefits for widows, and increasing
minimum Social Security pay—
meets more than 20 per cent.
Ribicoff initiated the act
which now provides aid to dependent children whose parents are the victims of unemployment.
Ribicoff was the first HEW
secretary to urge the striking
of the “separate but equal"
 
classes from the Hill-Burton
Hospital Construction Act and
statutes governing Federal assistance to land grant colleges.
In March, 1562, Ribicoff,
through administrative action,
made the historic decision that
children whose parents live or
work at Government installations would no longer be required to attend local public
schools in the Fall of 1963 if
those schools remained store»
rated, but, instead could attend
desegregated schools on the
Federal bases,
Ribicoff designed from the
Kennedy cabinet in 1962 to run
for the Senate. His election was
an indication of the great
amount of respect he commands in Connecticut. At the
age of 53, Ribicoff’s background in politics and modern»
ment at all levels make him
the ideal Democratic Vice
Presidential candidate.

nov. Romney Is Candidate lo Cope
With Problems. rangers of 60's
By Ken coleman
The Republican Party must
choose as its Presidential candidate for 1964 a man who has
proved that he has the ability
to cope with the problems of
the 1960's, and a man Who
recognized the rangers which
are interest in big government,
big business, and big unions.
Such a man is George Romney,
the Governor of Michigan.
In 1962 Romney ended a 14
year Democratic dynamic on
the Michigan state-house by depending the Democratic incorrect by over 78,000 votes. After
only one year in office Romney
had wired out the state’s massive 85.6 million deficit.
Earlier he had shown the
same carrier of ability in industry. When he was selected
as President of American
Motors Corporation, that firm
was on the verse of collapse.
When he left American Motors
to run for Governor in 1962
that firm had become established as one of the most vital
and stable in the automotive
industry.
It was Romney who introduced both the concept and
term of “compact” cars to the
American automotive industry.
Romney firmly believes that
there should he more citizen
participation in government. As
Governor .he has set aside
Thursday earnings to allow
any citizen to come in and discuss problems. Romney has
said that America respiratory
needs a party that is respective
to the people.
On Civil Rights Romney has
stated time and again his opposition to “discrimination of
any kind." He has ,customized
President Johnson’s tax pro-
IOMNEY
gray as a trick saying the deficit will continue at the same '
level.
Romney says that American
foreign policy must adopt a
new outlook. He says that the
policy of the present administration has led to the position
where freedom is in retreat all
over the world.
The Republicans can do no
less than navigate the person
who Margaret Chase Smith has
described as the man who is
“probably the most ideal candy—
date in the party." That man
is Governor George Romney
of Michigan.

About twenty-five Grinnell College students treated out to
the Grinnell High School gym Monday night to see what
could probably be called one of the most exciting, or at least
most “starvstudded” basketball games of the 1963-64 season.
The benefit game saw the Iowa All»Stars, led by brake
star McCoy McLemore down the Iowa Hawkeye seniors by
a score of 81-68. The game was played before a crowd of
about 400 spectators who were able to see some of the state's
best basketball players in action.
The contest, sponsored by the Grinnell watches, was a
money raising project for the Dr. Robert Norton Fund. Dr.
Norton, son of Grinnell Professor women Norton, operates a
hospital in the Me Kong Delta of diet Nam, only a few miles
from much of the guerrilla welfare.
The Grinnell Chamber of Commerce, along with the Grinnell Ministerial Association has undertaken this project to
raise $7,500 to help pay for much needed equipment and slip»
pages for Dr. Norton’s hospital.
The linear for the All-Stars included Grinnell‘s co-contains Jim Mifflin and John russell, McLelnore, Billy Foster,
and Ray Quinn (ex-brake) of brake University, and John

flip and russell both were chosen to the All-Conference first
team the Midwest Conference, and McLemore was named
to the All-Conference first team this year in the tough Missouri Valley Conference.

of Dave coach, Joe wellington, Paul clause, Bill Skea, Terry
Lyon, and John Raffensberger. All but clause and happens—

With red showtimes in his white basketball shoes, linked the
ball a little too hard and broke the glass snowboard. The game
finally got underway after a half an hour delay to replace the
snowboard.
The first half found the two teams fairly events
matched, neither team hitting too well from the floor, and the
half ended with the score at 34-34.
_Early in the second half the Alletars took over the lead
behind the hot shooting of McLemore and the long jump
shots, and the fancy ball handling of brake’s Billy Foster. The
final gun founded with the All-Stars well in front, 81-68.

Scronion's 'action Noi' Words'
Promises GOP
Just who is William Warren
Scranton, Governor of Pennsylvania, and why has he doc»
peter to the evident position
of a potential Republican Presidential candidate? Why do men
like robert Humphrey view
'Scranton as the toughest possible candidate for the Democrats_to defeat in November?
SCRANTON
How did Scranton manage to
achieve such outstanding political recognition in just; three
years of government service?
The answers to these questions can be calculated: Because in Scranton’s unassailable position as a man whose
public and private notices are
one and the some, he has managed, in one short year, as
Pennsylvania’s governor, to
lead his state in the direction
of amazing political and eco»
nonlic recovery, His progress
has received national acknowledgment and approval, Pennsylvania, like the U. S. is controlled with the political problem of the twentieth century—
how to adjust human communities to the violent hosting of industrial change.
In 1962 Scranton, fresh from
a tremendous international
mortality of 486,000 votes, faced
Pennsylvania‘s problems head—
on. in an aggressive yet sense—'
bee message to the General As—
simply he presented his interesting, progress~making program, In less than a year he
had 90% of his program passed
by the legislature. With a ”don’t
tell ’em, show ’em attitude, he
had become more than a talking governor. His dynamic administrative ability and genuine
public interest awarded Pennsylvania with a new helpful
climate, ‘
When Scranton’s outstanding
achievements were recognized
and loaded, his abilities were
projected on a nation-wide level. Americans began to wonder if he could do for his country, what he did for his state,
projected to such demanding
scrutiny, Scranton denied any
serious thoughts of becoming
a Republican presidential candidate. although he adults it
would be his “duty" to accept
an honest draft, Meanwhile, he
has become the most active
non-candidate in t h e field.
Scranton has developed the com
'honest Drofi'
play as effectively as any major politician in recent history.
The more he says “no," the
more interest he stars up.
The 46 year old governor was
born and raised ten miles
north of Scranton, Pennsylvania, the city that bears the name
of his early ironrsmelting investors, He graduated from
Yale University in 1939 with a
a, A. in history. After marriage and service in World War
ll as an Air Force pilot, he
returned to Yale and received
a law degree in 1946. As a
young businessman he built up
a reputation as a trouble shorter for filing industries. For 13
years he served on every level
of local activity,
Then in 1060 he was elected
to the U. S. Congress from
Pennsylvania's 10th District by
16,915 votes, while Presiden—
dial candidate Kennedy won the
same district by 14,963. In 1982
Scranton was elected governor
over Richard Dillworth — for
whom Kennedy campaigned—
by 486,000 votes. The Demo»
'craps had a 210,000 registration
lead in the state at the time.
In both elections, Scranton was
granted by the party leadership. Even though he main<
gains a detailed attitude toward politics, he has shown
himself to be a superb combat
commander. He is designated
by politics and once committed
to action or a race, becomes a
careful, progressive leader. He
believes that duty, not politics,
persons him and this gives him
the variable position of selfconfidence; Scranton's personality is something special. He
has an easy manner with per»
pre, yet manager to remain
what he is, an aristocrat of
wealth and parts.
Scranton has expressed his
views on a variety of current
issues,
CIVIL RIGHTS: approved of
the objectives of the civil rights
bill before Congress. Believes
the Federal Government should
take positive action on public
accommodations.
BUDGET: He is a balanced
budget man and dress’t believe
in deficit spending He is not a
wednesday theories.
MEDICARE: Feels a need
for additional federal legislab
tion, but opposed medicare finances by Social Security reductions, proposed financing
health care out of general tax
revenues.
FOREIGN AID: Supports foreign aid but is war 'ed about
Latin American distribution
Thinks the US should be able
to cut down on foreign aid
since there is an enormous
backing in accompanied appropriations.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Feels
that the U. S, must have a
strong foreign policy, Whenever columnists threaded the
free world, a strong stand must
be taken, even though there
may be danger.
William Scranton is a man
with the earmarks of a great
President. Neither list for now»
er, announcement with leadership or an inner self—doubt stars
this governor's mind as much
 
as the nature of duty. He be-

tions, that convinced the late
John F. Kennedy to name
Lodge ambassador to South
diet Nam in June of 1963. During his centre in diet Nam,
Lodge has managed to make
himself more than the hopedfor non-Democratic buffer between the Administration’s
Southeast Asian policy and the
forthcoming election. In fact, he
has not let political considerations interface title pushing
American efforts, He has shown
skill and southwest in everything a co-indicating hand over a

tender to work at cross purposes with each other and the
State Department under previous ambassadors,
His position on United States
policy is this: stand up or get
out. Yet standing up, for
Lodge, does not necessarily
carry with it an appeal to
arms, Rather. to stand up is to
fight reaction. “It is not enough
for us to be so strong that the
Communist countries are afraid
to attack us or approach further on the rest of the world.
We are already strong enough
for that. We must do more; we
must lead the world to a last-
pieces in public, not pop lcal
office,
As a possible Presidential
candidate William Scranton has
a poWerful factor on his side—
his patent ability to units the
warning Republican P a r t y.
Among the middle of the road
Republicans there is an active
enthusiasm while right wing—
era feel no mortality, Scranton's
unblemished record as a lead—
and a vote-better is an indication of his ability to lead the
Republican Party to a victory
in 1964,
 
ing peace where true enlargement will be possible.” Clearly
Lodge is most capable in the
area of international relations.
While Lodge's popular appeal has been based largely upon his diplomatic ability, he
has not been one to reflect the
internal affairs of the nation,
As a senator, he was far less
hosting than most Republicans
to the New Deal, and he went
on record for the Wagner Act,
the Wages and Hours Act, and
in 1939 he sought to amend the
Social Security Act to increase
old age payments. His support
of the New Deal programs
along with his opposition to the
industry-wide. compulsory containing clause of the TaftHartley Act has made labor
more than usually reception to
a Republican candidate, although his official record on
labor problems ends in 1952
with his appointment to_the
UN.
Lodge has not been a John—
ny-come-lately to the questions
and problems of racial store»
nation. In 1950, in an article
for the Atlantic Monthly,
Lodge proposed to end racial
legislation in the armed
forces and in housing projects
and educational projects finances by the Federal government. In addition to numerous statements made during
the 1960 campaign streaming
the need for a strong civil rights
platform, Lodge made known
his desire to include a qualified
metro in the cabinet. should the
Republicans be elected.
Lodge, in a speech made at
the end of his 1960 campaign
indicated support for an active
federal role. He said, “We can
overcome the preceding and de<
tests in understanding which
still stand between some of our
citizens and full opportunity.
We can provide the schools,
the medical care, the hospitals,
where these are needed.”
His awareness of pressing
constitutional issues has been
in the forefront, In 1950 he cosponsored the Lodge-basket
Amendment, passed by the
Senate but turned down by the
House, which sought to do
away with the “integrated"
electoral college.
In short, the aura of experience which has surrounded
Henry labor Lodge, Jr., has
created a tradition of ability
both in diplomacy and in=poll-tips, a tradition which won him
the support of Republicans in
New Hampshire.
