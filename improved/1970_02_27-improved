included nearly everyone in
Germany. The Republic itself
was said (gallery) to have been
responsible for the “star in the
back" at Versailles.
The government never had
control over the army. In fact,
the army became an independent
right wing force opposed to the
democracy. coleman Cited the
failure to husband the army alter
the war and to build a new
democratic military force as a
mistake.
Germany was also controlled
with a split in her working class.
No one took it too seriously at
the time, expertise that the split
would real, but it did not real.
The differences were too fun
parental. There were as many
political parties in Germany as
there were points of view, and
the coalition governments that
were formed were input and
portable, for the German
politicians did not believe in
compromise. During the whole ol
the Weimar Republic no great
leader got the power in Germany.
Professor coleman was quick
to add that conditions in Weimar
Germany were not unique, since
other European countries had
suffered great damage and
manpower loss during the war.
The great depression, which
caused “nightmarish inflation"
in Germany, also affected Britain
and the United States, but the
Weimar Republic was unable to
meet the crisis.
coleman would not compare
Germany of 1913 to Russia at
1917, but instead to France in
1370. There had been a military
defeat, there was little one
thusiasm for the Republic, there
had been territories losses, and
there were many radical political
groups. There were, however,
some differences: The FrancoPrusslan War was a short one
and had not done nearly so much
damage. France had a
revolutionary tradition, whereas
Germany did not, The French
Third Republic had had time to
recover from the war; Germany
was hit by the depression almost
immediately.
What is the place of the Weimar
Republic in German history?
Was it merely a include to
either” coleman maintained that
either’s rise was not charitable.
There were many turning points
during the Republic when the
course of German history could
have been changed: for example,
a democratic army could have
been formed.
The Weimar Republic was a
very creative period for Germany, as German scientists and
artists made great contributions
to [he world. Professor coleman

Gives Lectures Here on Ecology
Dr. James Drew of the
University of Nebraska spoke on
ecology here Wednesday. He
gave two lectures, one to over
200 students including the Science
1 class, and held a question and
answer session.
The first lecture, “Ecological
Implications of the Alaskan Oil
Development," never got deeply
into the subject before the period
ended. Drew has spent some time
in the Arctic slope region of
northern Alaska where oil has
recently been discovered.
Problems caused by permafrost
and earth slippages which
prevent die construction of roads
and headlines were discussed at
length.
”infrared sending of Soil and
Range Conditions" was the topic
of Drew’s second lecture, which
was attended mostly by faculty
members. This concerned a

coleman does not accept the
comparison of Germany of 1930
to America of 1970. There are
important differences: Vietnam
is a limited war, and Americans
were divided at its beginning;
America is basically a none
military society.
The second event in the
Symposium was a lecture—
discussion by Professor Henry
Klein of the Grinnell Art faculty
about Seigfried Kracauer’s book

technique, though expensive, can
be used to detect plant diseases,
such as Dutch Elm, long before

can be taken to prevent spread
of the disease.
When asked about pollution,
Dr. Drew said that he is in

of pollution rather than
developing specific technical
solutions to the problem. I link
that we need to look at the basic
things first than to develop
technical solutions.”

similar material could have been
edited in a way that emphasized
the underlying humanity. The

cited “Berlin, Symphony of a

although shots of real people in

in place of scenes stated by

It becomes more and more apparent to us that the goal of the
radical students at Grinnell and
other colleges is the creation of
student controlled comments. If
the Administration continues to
take a laissez—large attitude
except for the issue of violence,
and continues to access to
student power demands, this goal
should be a wait accompli in the
very near future. Perhaps such
a college comment should be
tried. From recent remarks of

first established by Elly Peterson, then state Chairman of
Michigan Republican Party, in
Detroit as a program intended
to make party headquarters in
that city functional and valuable
to the citizens during non~election
years.
Elly Peterson is now assistant
chairman of the Republican National Committee and has taken
her experience and ideas to the
national level. As a result, Action
Now has become a dealtime community action effort encouraged
by the Republican Party.
College Republicans in Iowa
have picked up this concept plan
to institute it on Iowa college
computer with co-medication on
the statewide level. The conference on March 7 is designed to
help execute college Republicans
and anyone else interested in
construction problem solving and
organized community action.
The conference will include
panels on drugs, pollution, the
perspective of the black student,
and a summary ,and general
procedures panel with which to
close the day’s activities In—
closed in the program will be
Elly Peterson, the Action Now
catalogue; Jack Criw‘old,
special assistant for community
affairs to the Republican National Chairman; and several
other people ultimately con
nested with this community
action program on the national
level.
Either Governor Robert Ray
or Lt. Governor Jepsen will
moderate the general panel, and
Senator Jack Miller will speak
atlanta.
Other resource people will be:
Dr. Philip device of brake
University, head of the modern
nor’s drug commission; and Max
Milo Mills, head of the governor's
Crime Commission. Both men
will participate on the drug
panel. L. B. buddy, Secretary of
Agriculture, St. Representative
Andrew harley, expert in Iowa's
pollution problems; and Earl
harris of the pokemon’s done
salvation Commission will
participate in the panel on pollution.
Concerning the concept of
Action Now in Iowa, Phil basics
of Grinnell College, and Director
of Action Now for Iowa, stated:
“Let me expensive that Action
Now is a non-theoretical
program. It is, indeed, sponsored
by the Republican Party and
College Republicans of Iowa, but
it deremphastzes almost to ex»
caution the traditional party
functions of voteegetting and
political gaming. Rather, it is a
project designed for participation
by all people, regardless of
political affiliation, and is
directed at solving or helping to
solve any community problem
regardless of its role in the party
policy structure, In sum, we hope
to tap the human resource with
the aim or batteries the human
condition in somesmall way.”
He then Commented on the
March 7th Conference itself. “We
hope that by bringing together
resource people with expertise in
fields related to local projects
college students might undertake, we can execute Conference
participants in the concepts and
possibilities of community action
programs, Thus. just as the
Action Now program is none
theoretical, our Conference will
be directed toward education and
as non-political as possible."
basics also arrested that the
Conference is open to all students
and that he hopes Grinnell
students and their skepticism
about party politics will be evident enough to keep proceedings
nonrpolitical and in line with the
above-mentioned goals.

Thomas and the Senate
Last week, the Senate, in its countries liberality,
saw fit to give Tom Thomas a gift of $50. They did this
immediately after the Student Auditor had informed
them that they were flat broke. But let that pass. One
should be prepared to fighter one’s belt when such
a worthy collector appears. At ﬂ'le time, the Senate
simply gave Thomas the money without either requiring
him to produce evidence of need or requesting him
to report the net profit on his journalistic venture.
Two weeks have passed, and we may note several
interesting facts. Thomas’ paper has been a great
success: approximately 600 copies sold each week. At
25 cents a copy, this means that the gross take came
to about $300 (plus the $50 gift). Now Thomas has stated
that the cost of printing each issue was between $80
and $100. Adding expenses and individuals to that,
Thomas estimated the cost of producing each issue
at about $125 or about $250 for both. That leaves Mr.
Thomas and friends with a net profit of about $100,
which makes them pretty successful specialists indeed.
We master to note that we are not applying that
Mr. Thomas would keep that $50 for himself. No doubt
he will return it to the Senate. The interesting question
concerns how he will return the money.
It seems that Mr. Thomas still ones SGA a considerable amount of money from a loan made to pay
for his published report on the Chicago roots. That
loan, still in part outstanding, was supposed to have
need paid last semester. Now when that loan is called
in, Thomas is in the interesting position of being able
to pay off the loan with the $50 gift the Senate gave
him. No matter how he choices to pay off the loan,
the question may be raised as to why he does not return
the gift which, presumably, was given for a non-profit
making venture. At any rate, the Senate has, once
again, demonstrated its specially infinite capacity for
thoughtless and drive actions.
The SGA will hold its election for President next
Monday. More precisely, copper Room is going to
have a new play leader. The gentleman who are running
for this office are normally alike in their views. They
speak of student power, activity (apparently a disease
of a malfunctioning voluntary grand), good controlling,
responsibility, revolution, etc. etc. etc. We may mention
that the theater of the assure candidate, Mark pass,
at least had the sense of shame to run under an assumed
name ~ Jim Panzee. The other candidates are Andy
Loewi, Phil years, and Frank Thomas.
We believe that the range of candidates is something
less than spectacular. The editors of the 5&3 have
been informed that their endorsement of one or another
of the candidates is the kiss of death for that candidate’s
political additions. best we be thought to be unduly
artistic, we shall terrain from any real endorsement.
Rather, in the tradition of great minerals like Jefferson
and Madison, we counsel resistance. We encourage
the students to boycott this election.
We do not intend to impugn the characters of any
of the candidates. Nor do we believe that activity
is necessarily reprehensible, although we do believe
that vocational activity is loathsome. Now the present
SGA President apparently operates on the principle
that if you do nothing, you do nothing wrong. That
is not wholly bad principle. But alan, he does nothing
so hourly.
If we support one or another of the candidates
we are simply giving him a license to proceed in the
irresponsible and children manner of the present Senate.
It seems that it would be wider to show the ad
registration, faculty, and the candidates themselves
that we would like something better than what we
presently have. An effective boycott would, we think,
demonstrate this.

Letters to the Editor . . .
To The Editors:
Carleton College, which
Grinneil prices itself in operating
whenever it can, has six forms
which are computational by
rooms.
Colorado College (the newest
member of the ACM Conference)
has published grades.
joe College, where the administration often out
of responsibility in drug cases by
indicating it to the police,
recently reviewed its
curriculum, doing away with all
requirements,

problems. Instead, say 7 change
the curriculum only when you
can prove without a doubt that
present courses are highly usr
desk'able and proposed changes
for superior. . .say, if people are
stupid enough to take drugs when
they don't even know what
they’re getting, they shouldn’t
ask the college to help them out.
What does it take to make a
college excellent? What does it
take to make Grinnell exciting?
Such a minute part of our time
here is spent in the similarly
pursuant of academic. What,
then, becomes of the rest of that
time? One of the last voices in
the new admissions film said.
“Grinnell can be a beautiful
place," and yet you could almost
hear where the conditional clause
had been removed. If we would
be willing to experiment, ii we
would be willing to challenge
students, if we would be willing
lo respond to people's desire to
learn, then. . .“Grinnell can be
a beautiful place."
For instance, most freshman.
coming into a college situation,
expect a challenging academic
environment. They are ready to
explore their theoretical which,
various to find out who they are
and what they are becoming.
How do we capitalize on this?
By a freshman orientation of two
days, designed to [it the
newcomer into Grinnell's day-today operation as quickly and
smoothly as possible? By a
Humanities course as right in
reading material as it is in its
application to the student’s
personal questions, which cent
let'ed around his life and his
society raise the most proposed
questions that any discussion of
Humanities could raise?
We could do better at Grinnell.
II we expect to call ourselves a
truly outstanding liberal arts
college and have the phrase
mean anything —— then we must
do better. And if the faculty who
control the institution by virtue
of their corporation-like standing
of rank and experience will not
challenge themselves to attempt
change and instrumentation,
perhaps students must The
tyranny of prerequisites,
sequence of courses, and the deaf

To The Editors;
Mr. Klein’s comments upon my
review of The Battle of players
are well taken. it was not,
however, my intention to suggest
that the film provides a paradise
for an American urban
revolution. My point was that a
member or the establishment
sources both here and abroad
(Time, the French government)
perceived the film to have
revolutionary potential. Whether
or not their corrections were
certified was not my concern;
that they perceived the film in
the paranoid fashion they did
seems to me to he of some
sociological interest. The
lnispcrccptionsoftherulmgclass
are often as instruction as its
vcrldical corrections. Nevertheless, my article \vhs air
figures on this point, and 1 am
grateful to Mr. chip for the
certification.
Mr, brussels chose not to
examine a single one of my
substantial conventions. instead
he offered an unprecedented and
generous exercise in character
investigation. A public debate
between me and Mr. prospect
would seem to be paintings, as
there is no reason to think that
his public style would differ
significantly from his written.
The real tragedy of prospect’s
letter lies Tn the irreparable
damage that its autobiographical
regulations have done to his
reputation and flexibility among
students, faculty, and ad»

grounds that the Senate cannon

The Senate wants to talk to the

Michigan State University Offers Summer
SCARLET AND BLACK
Courses In Europe and Asia This Year
Michigan State University is
offering credit courses in
England, Spain, France, Austria,
Norway, and Japan during the
summer of 1970, the MSU Ofﬁce
of Overseas Study announced
Editorial
appointed From The New York Times
The seriousness of New York City’s drug abuse problem and
the other inadequacy of the governmental response to it have been
demonstrated by a series of developments within the past several
days.
A 17-year-old harvard College freshman died after enabling an
overcome of herein over the weekend. A 17-year-old Brooklyn boy,
an 18»year-old front girl, and a “3-year-old states Island boy died
from drug abuse in the city‘s five boroughs last year.
Drug abuse has become more permalink among the city’s very
young. A deeply admitted 12-learned girl was found in a narrative
date last week and returned to her expensive East Side home. An
11-year-old girl was admitted into the primarily run Odyssey Home
rehabilitation program, and an ll-learned boy was arrested with
his two conditions. ages 13 and 15, on charges of selling herein.
It is hard to understand why city officials tried for a time to block
the release of statistics switching the vast dimensions of the drug
abuse problem, or why they have failed to launch a prevention or
rehabilitation program on the scope clearly required. They have,
instead, sought to close down the front Odyssey House, the only
facility in me country devoted solely to the rehabilitation of teen-age
address. They supposed Dr. audience lenses-member, director of
the program,bingo criminal court on charges of violation a building
code provision against overcrowding. She faces a jail term.
Neither the city nor the state has made available presently united
buildings which could be turned into treatment centers to the Odyssey
program or to other private organizations trying respiratory to fill
the void created by official reaction. Such action is friendly needed.
The city and state ought to launch educational programs on drugs
to reach youngsters in the lowest school grades. There are probably
100.000 herein address in the city, an estimated one-fourth of them
transfers. Additional thousands of other youngsters are ex
residential with herein and other dangerous drugs. prevention
programs require immediate searching. Rehabilitation centers need
to be opened quickly. The Federal Government should help enterprise
city and state efforts in these areas
Mayor Lindsay has so far remained strengths along. He provides
for new rehabilitation centers in his capital budget. Governor
powerseller recommends further study. For the state to propose
the treatment of 150 transfers in a pilot project that might get under
way in six months, as Assembly Speaker Duryea proposed last weeks
is for it to continue flooring the urgency and the dimensions of the
problem.
How many youngsters must die before Government becomes
awarded? HOW many families of all economic and social strain must
know heartache? Is there within the remote bureaucracy no one
who owns a sense of honest outside?

Dr. Ronald Kurtz Returns From Liberia
To Discuss conditions all burlington
huntington College' IS a private
church related, liberal arts
college located 120 miles island
from the capital of Liberia. Built
on tribal land purchased a century ago by one of the American
organization Societies who were
returning states to Africa,
huntington is thought to be the
only American-style liberal arts
college in sub-bahamas Africa.
About one fourth oF its 250 students come from African countries outside Liberia.
since 199-3 the Associated Colleges of the Midwest has been
sponsoring a program to give its
graduates the opportunity to
serve as teaching assistance at
huntington and to give its faculty
members the chance to serve
on the huntington facility. huntington students can study at
ACM colleges in preparation for
American graduate schools.
The college has always had
limited financial resources, partly because the Liberian government and USAID give only
limited support to the church»
related school. The college
receives a few donations, but the
bulk of its support comes from
the principal church, w. s. aid
agencies, and the ACM program,
which has been supported pro
family by the word Foundation,
the powerseller Foundation, and
by faculty grants under the Fulv
bright-days Act. Although many
large American universities have
associations with larger African
Universities, none had gathered
with huntington.
Dr. Ronald Kurtz, Associate
Professor of anthropology at
Grinnell, spent the last two
academic years at huntington
under a teaching and research
program sponsored by the ACM.
During the first year he taught
at the college, but he devoted the
second year entirely to field re—
search.
Kurt: said that it was surprisingly easy to adjust to living
and teaching at huntington. The

'727 Broad — crime"
housing was excellent, and the
college‘s facilities were good. He
was quick to point out that the
college community was somewhat isolated from the surrounding peoples, a bit like a colonial
compound. This was the difficulty in resulting. The social
structure expects a certain kind
of relationship between faculty
mernbers, most of whom are
white, and the nations of the area.
Mr, Kurtz thought this a little
forward. For example, “everyone was expected to hire local
help in the household and not to
pay more than a certain amount
of money for the services."
“A man can, however, obtain
something of great value in a
context he may not like. I thought
that huntington was a very good
college." One of the great satin-
[actions for Kurtz was the op—
community to deal with such a wide
range of students. There were
Children of tribesmen and of
some of the elite families of
Africa all attending the same
college. Many tribesmen were
doing excellent college-level
work, partly because of the good
training they had received from
dictionaries before coming to
huntington. All the students were
very challenging, freely
functioning many Western ideas
about politics and education. Mr.
Kurtz added that huntington is
doing the best it can to make
its college education relevant to
Africans 7 more African and
fewer European History courses,
a greater emphasis on African
writers in literature courses, and
in general a greater emphasis on
African culture and African
problems. This is a much different approach from some of the
European type schools on the
continent, which maintain usr
allowed European curriculums.
huntington is not affected by the
kind of corruption, e.g. grade
buying. which the University of
Liberia in mongolia is just beginning to overcome;
Many of the foreign students
who attend huntington are receiving aid from the United
States government under a
program which allows them to
attend school in another African
country. The Africans generally
prefer this to sending students
to Europe or America to be
trained, because often the best
talent never returns from overseas to developing Africa where
it is badly needed.
One of the biggest problems
huntington College faces is
related to the sparsity of trained
men in Africa. Although the chief
administrators at huntington are
materials, the faculty is approximately white and temporary. The
faculty therefore has little stability. The college recognized that
the long-run solution is to detroit
Africans to the faculty, but since
there are many challenging careers available to a college
trained man in Africa, this is

Early German Films Are Presented To
control Culture of Weimar Republic
in conjunction with the Symr
sodium on Weimar Culture
(February 24th-March let), five
films are being presented — The
Cabinet of Doctor Caligari”
(1920). “Metropolis" (1927),
“Berlin, Symphony of a Great
City” (1927), “Blue Angel" (1930)
and “Triumph of the Will" (1936).
Though each is of automatic
importance, it was with a view
towards their cultural signifir
dance that their selection was
made. They extract the
duration of Republican Germany, and collectibles document
predispositions in German
Culture which help to account for
the Republic's collapse.
This point of View, i.e.. film
as a sort of cultural parameter,
has been given form by Siegfried
Kracauer 7 From Caligari to
either, A Psychological History
of the German Film his premises
are simple: 1) film, in the period
undo. consideration, is unique in
its mass audience, 2) being a
commercial venture, it must
satisfy some need of that mass
audience, and 3) the degree to
which a film satisfied such a
mass need can be assessed both
at the box office and by the
reputation of its movies as a for
mula of success in other films.
The four Republican Films

qualify on both counts. “Triumph
of me Will," a product of the Nazi
Propaganda Ministry, is particularly telling. In it, currencies
which are convertible in the
Republican Films blowjob into
a humanitarian nightmare.
Principal amongst these
currencies is the “ornamental
use of humanity.” a des»
creation used by Kracauer
indicate the reduction of the
human content of a film to a
formal, even decorative, visual
pattern. This sentence, in films
like “Berlin, Symphony of a
Great City". extends itself
until the whole of reality is record
atively demonstrated. The net
result is that the intrinsic activity
of the candle shot for unsigned
reality is submitted in the abstract editing of the whole.
A comparison with postrevolution Russian Films seeds
light on this point. Where editing
in the Russian Films emphasizes
the social content of the shots,
the German Films observe that
content by editing solely on the
basis of the plastic content of the
shots. This decorative sentence
reaches its apogee in the
newsreels and war documentation of Nazi Germany. in them,
war itself is reduced to a
decorative panoply, a florists
argument in which no men die
and reality is the handmaiden of
an incredible Third which.
in the Weimar Years this
decorative principle motivated

of people are choreographed into

much as the participants in the
Nurnberg Party Convention of
1934, the subject of “Triumph of
the Will." But in “Metropolis"
we encounter a second major
sentence of the Republican
Cinema, i.e,. a pattern of
reception and subsequent submission to priority.
Kracauer notes that in the
German Films, the alternative to
authority is always portraits as
chaos and never democracy.
Hence reception resolved itself
into ultimate resubmissiun to
authority. So with “Caligari,” so
with “Metropolis" and so with
the Weimar Republic. The authorization psychology of
Weimar Germany as opposed to
the democratic form of its
political institutions is made!

dividend humanity. In Germany
there was the danger of an intel»
lecture re-marketing, the realm»
nation at home that people are
killed, featured, and destroyed
even by the most florists of
wars.
Two themes were common in
successful German films. One
involves a reception and then a
submission to authority. A good
example of this type of film is
“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”.
The German press thought that
it was a great film at the time
or its release; they did not consider it opposed to freedom. The
other preliminary theme is antiintellectualism. The film “Blue
Angel” is a good example.
Professor Klein went on to
outline Kracauer’s philosophy of
film, which appears as if it could
be partly a result of district of
the German films. He opposed
formal editing. Rather, the film
should try to capture the “unsigned reality”, the explained.
This principle, says Klein, writes
out many kinds of film making,
and he turned it “rather onesided”. Scenes should not be
stated with actors, and there
should be a sense of endlessness
to the plot of the film. Kracauer
is apparently opposed to strip—
tired themes that run their
course within the film. The film
should stress that life is indeters
minute, that the film~maker
cannon control everything. In
short, Kracauer prefers a pacific
treatment of subjects involving
life itself.
Carl Kracauer’s method of
examining film be applied to the
American cinema to give us cuts
to the psychology of America?
Klein said yes, with reservations.
In America there are many other
mass media, and many different
kinds of potentially successful
films. These factors made Klein
heritage to draw conclusions, but
he did point out certain themes
that dominant television and
movies. Family life, for one, is
a common theme. The concept
of authority which sees that both
the criminal and the political
use Similar tactics is another.
Finally, there is a group of
escapist films (like “The
Graduate”) which use many
visual effects and contain little
social content. Klein then broke
off his formal remarks and
opened up the floor for questions.

McCarthy's The Year of the People Selected As
P.P.P.E. Book; Gilmour Recommends Reading
The Year of the People, by
Senator Eugene McCarthy, has
been selected as the February 7
March Political Bookroi~theMonth, the Program in Practical
Political Education announced
thisweek.
This timely book is an account
of the tumultous and qualifying
events associated with the 1968
presidential campaign by the
man who, perhaps more than any
other, changed the course of that
campaign.
Clearly decided by the usual
ghostwriter, Senator McCarthy
writes as he spoke in 1968 7
directly, frequently, at times
with pointed humor, at other
times with real wilderness, He
speaks to a number of the central
questions raised about his per»
local quest for the Democratic
nomination: Did he expect to win
the nomination (he hoped to drive
President Johnson into return-
ment, but he had no hope of ob—.
warning the nomination)? Was
there a feed between him and
the Kennedys (he denied this, but
reveals his experience and distance for the style, the use of
money, the corporate and often
arrogant staff, and the emphasis
on political pragmatism of the
Kennedy brothers)? Why was his
campaign so replaced, lowkeyed, and certified (McCarthy
makes clear that politics to him
is a serious, rational, and moral
profession, above betty appeals
to edition, special interest
groups, or party traditions and
heroes)?
But the volume leaves other
questions ignored or
inadequately answered: Why did
McCarthy recent losing, when he
assisted he has no hopes of
winning? Why did he withhold his
hall-started endorsement of
romance Humphrey until the last
minute? Why did he relinquish
his seat on me Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, after his
strong drive and demand korea
change in the U. 5. Foreign
policy? Why did he resource his
Senate seat in 1972 and any desire
to lead his Party toward the
reforms be diseases?
“This book, although too often
incomplete and disappointing
reserves wide reading and
reflection," remained C. admin
(:‘rilmour (Political Science),
Director of the PPPE. “For it
helps Americans to understand
a graphic and critical period of
our current pop cal history."

To the Editors:
No weeks ago, my roommate
and l were planning to work on
this semester’s S 5r B. Accordingly, we attended a staff meeting held on Sunday night. We
were diseases to find that your
political and editorial philosophies suffered basically — ii 1
may use that word — from our
own, but we wanted to work on
the newspaper, anyway. 'tuesday
we came to help proofread but_
left in discuss after one hour. it
is impossible to proofread stories
that first need to be permitted!
This week's paper concerns my
judgment, and l will use the issue
to explain what I think is wrong
its mg. sea.
Let me start with the basics.
First of all, they Rt his a ”news”paper: therefore anyone would
typically assume that news
predominates throughout.
Almost hall this issue is ad copy!
Page three has ad copy and two
columns written by people who
have no connection with Grinnell
College. Yes, current events are
news wherever they happen, but
it’s a city you use 21/: columns
of space in an a page college
newspaper for columns about the
evans of marijuana ~ write, to put
it middle — and the fate of the
Democratic National Committee.
The rest of the copy included
one thoughtless editorial; one
full article on the humanities
experiment; a reprint of a court
statement; a full review of an
exciting folk concert; an ex—
collect feature on “Battle”
placed as lead news story on the,
front page; a long, full feature
on the sports page and several
long letters to the editor. Doesn't
sound like too much news, does
it?
recently, the S a B is a college
newspaper. Hopefully, a college
newspaper reflects the various
opinion of the student body ~ not
so, however, in our 5&3. Week
after week, you continue I"
produce smug editorials that
damn student movements or
students — and these editorials
are supposed to represent the
student body! 0n the last paper
I worked the author at each editorial had his initials printed at
the end of his editorial. An
editorial is, after all, personal
opinion.
From these basics I turn to
more specific errors. Overall, the
S a: B is guilty of bad journalistic
practice. The copy is generally
hourly written and‘or’full. with
the exception of ad copy, the
layout is delicious. Someone had
better learn how to write and
space headlines.
You may use “lack of news”

travelers problem In Double
Dual Meet By Carleton, class
By John angel Pepper
Saturday's double dual meet
fitted Grinnell against Carleton,
and Cornell against Carleton and
St. Olaf. Although the Grinnell
wrestling lost twice, there were
many outstanding individual performances.
Our first meet against the girls
of Carleton started with Chuck
Farr winning on a perfect,

known isa transfer student, Mike
wrestled a brilliant exhibition
match, His aggressiveness and
ability led to his winning his
opponent early in the match.
Mike Brown is sure to be a book
to next year’steam.
Then both Derek Feilbert and
Henry Corona were signed in the
early part of their matches. Next
came shipped’s exciting match.
After almost getting signed and
almost winning his opponent,
Mason lost by one point. Even
though Dave delta fought age
gressively, he was signed by the
Carleton wrestler.
Jim lesser’s match followed.
Marked by very cartoons
wrestling, lesser managed to tie
his opponent. Then came
Washington boston’s fantastic
contest. Overpowering his opponent, Washington signed him
in the last period, using a sales
nelson, Washington signed his
advertise to the mat. Counting
the three Grinnell forfeits, the
final score of the meet with
Carleton was 35 to 12, Carleton
winning.
The second meet, about a half
hour later, fitted Grinnell
against St. Olaf. The meet was
marked by many close decisions
with Grinnell at the short end.
In the 116 pound weight class,
Farr lost to an while wrestler,
o to 2. Later Farr pubmed, “They
were just in better shape.”
Brown lost 3 to 4, in a close and
very hardrought match. Derek
Feilbert put out a great effort,
but was finally signed in_the last
period. Then came that “Miami
Flash," plenty Corona. Henry
fought well and decided the pin,
but lost7t<i o.
The next Wrestler was Mason
Klippell, the dean of the Grinnell
wrestling. Almost sustai ng an
injury, Mason still nominated his
match and outepointed his ups
parent. After shipped was Dave
delta’s close match. Although he
lost by 4 to 2, Dave showed a
lot of class against a powerful
advertise. Only a couple of
seconds riding time made the
difference, but Jim lesser lost
to the St. Olaf wrestler by 2 to
I. To say the least, lesser was
contained.
Since St. Olaf had no wrestlel
at 191, they corrected that
division. Washington boston, our
191, wrestled an Olaf
lightweight. In his own charitable style, Washington controlled
the match with power, speed, and
ability. The score of his match
was 5 to 1, and imagine - he’s
only a freshman! When all of the
Grinnell forfeits were applied, the
score stood 36 to B in St, Olaf's
favor.
With the Conference meet
coming up in two weeks, Grinnell
has some wrestling who could
score points, Coach Hunt picks
Farr, shipped, lesser, and boston
as wrestling who should place in
the tournament. Hunt also thinks
one of the other Grinnell matter
may provide some surprised at
the Conference meet. The meet
is scheduled for the 5th and 6th
of March at Galesburg, the home
of Knox College. Good luck to
those hearts Grinnell wrestling.
