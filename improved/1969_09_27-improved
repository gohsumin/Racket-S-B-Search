in part to student complaints
Mrs. Hall has been serving as

New Day Cdre Center Opens
By holly~ acquire
Since a woman's place cannon always
be in the home, a day care center has
been opened to provide Grinnell preIehoolers with a place to stay while their
mothers are out on such undomestic current as working or going back to school.
The Grinnell Community Day Caro
Center, in operation [or only two weeks,
l5 located in the basement of the First
United Presbyterian Church at 1015 birth
Avenue, Having a capacity oi twenty
children, from three to six years old, the
center is open six days a week, it is relying heavily on student, volunteer help,
and more is needed. ‘
The idea of a day care center was
first promoted by the United Church
'Women, a. general council of Grinnell
women. After a survey of the town last
year. they found that there was a defining need for this type of service. Many
women who wanted to work or return to
- school found lt didﬁcult to afford a baby-
titten‘ for'their preschool children.
After receiving the need for a center,
a board consisting of members of the
community at large was formed. The
project then went out of the hands of the
Church Women and became a community project, with people from all walks or
life contributing to the replication of the
center.

“I think it may be an institutional responsibility to discipline student drug users in

According to the figures presented to the Student Affairs

$5.40 for the year. (When the
number of builders decreased,
the decrease in Saga expenses

per remaining boulder must:
increase for the college to meet
its contract with Saga.) The
college would absorb the cost
for this semester, but next semester each student would be
paying $2.70 more in board.
In addition. some sort of
checking procedure would have
to be informed. The SAC is
working on other alternatives,
but so far the proposed system would be to issue each
student a photo ID card indi‘
eating his board status and require him to present it at each
meal. The cost of the card per
student would be about $1.50
(or maybe less), and the cost
or improving checkout would
be about 5.95 per student.
Therefore, the board cost next
semester would jump about
