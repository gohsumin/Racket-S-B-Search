You can’t learn much about the problem of integer
tion rs. legislation by talking to people from Dubuque
and Minneapolis.
That's why I went Monday to the campus of the
University of Mississippi. There I was successful ill obtaining some watches-Hulltsvllle-B’mobile viewpoints. Here
is something of what I learned about the Mississippi fri s
and the general Southern attitude toward the question of
equality of races ill education:
THE GENERAL attitude of the students and faculty
is one of embarassment over the violence alld a feeling of
department of Northern interference into “our problem."
Any other attempts to describe tale attitude of the Oxford
campus community need to be prepared title “some students,” or ”some faculty.”
Some students I applied with were obviously pro-sega
legationist and were proud of Others were largely inn
different expression only concern at the intervention of
their studies and social life.
ANY I’RO-INTEGRATIONIS’I‘ views were kept well
hidden. Mississipppi is not the kind of school you go to
if you are all absent pro-l'lltegrationist.
I asked the editor of the Daily Mississipian float edit
social stand she was taking ill regard to the whole situation. She said she is ill 'log students to eschew Violence. I
(queries her on her personal stand on integration and she
declined to answer.
The amendment. most difficult for me to understand and, I suppose. for most other Northern std<
cents, is the apparent ease and nonchalance with
which many Southerners rationalize seeing-alien. It’s
as if there never really were any question about it:
“Meredith is a metro and he’s entitled to his education but I’d just as soon he got it elsewhere.” That‘s
the quite matter f-fact thing you'd hear from many
honest and star ghtvtllinking Southerners.
Integration will come to Missi sippi because it is the
law of the land. It will havehard traveling because, unfortunately, laws often don’t respect local attitudes.
In all reflects, the best thing we at Grinnell can do
is try to understand — and wait.
. . . leadership
One person can be held largely responsible for the
\‘iolellce at Oxford: nov. loss variety. V
He could himself have carried out the Federal Court
ruling that metro James Meredith be enrolled at Ole
Miss, Had he dolls this—perhaps appearing the decision if
Ile felt so included—but, ill al case, seeing that the ruling
was carried out perfectly, there would have been no need
for US. marshall or troops.
variety could have handled possible animation
arising from Meredith‘s involving with state brothers—but he didn’t. Instead, in an obviously politicians
motivated move, he stood against the ruling thus ring local and regional racing blood.
What was done by the Federal Government had to
he done. The Justice Department after with great consideration and discretion. Call it Northern interference or
whatever, the move was necessary because integration will
not come of itself ill Mississippi — not as long as there
are leaders like variety.

It is a well establishing fact.
that, due in publishing problems,
the newspaper used by the s &B
is of interior quality and follows quickly with age. There
certainly seems to be little need
to aggregate this condition with
bad editorial policy. Granted a
newspaper is dedicated to take
a stand on Certain controversial
issues. The type of intense personnel campaign witnesses in last
week's continue on prcppmg is
much more than taking a stand.

willing to serum it on. falling to
present their views in lies of
academic pressure or general

it would seem that a newspaper
ought to present both sides art
if it choices to approach an issue from only one slandpoint.
as is so often the case with our

present its case in a scrupulous
manner. The gross misrepresentatlon apparent in last week’s

We must remember that this
is THE GRINNELL COLLEGE

little effect other than to antagonize our editor further, and
who knows what lhnl would

For the geneﬁt‘ of the some

read the 5&3 each week, l
would like to give a virtual re‘

the majority of our editors is

far cry from the truth. While
the majority of our editors are
not in favor of wrapping, it is
a fact that each wrapping “start"
is discussed at house meetings
or in house council and voted
on.
lN EACH case a majority is
required for passage, which
means that a majority or the
Grinnell students are in favor
of the events or the past few
