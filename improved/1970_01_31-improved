Anderson Leads
Christian Symposium
Between Sunday and Tuesday
of this week, Dr, Francis Ann
screen was the featured speaker
in a symposium, the Future oi
Christianity in the Poserhristian
Era, Copies of Dr. anderson’s
speeches will be available soon
from the Grinnell College Christian Fellowship.
Dr. anderson, a native Aus.
italian, is Professor of Old Testamerit Literature at the Church
Divinity School of the Pacific in
Berkeley and Visiting Professor
of Ugaritic at the University of
California. He holds seven
degrees, including an MA in
Physical Chemistry, an MA. in
Russian language and literature
and a PhD. in Oriental
languages from John Hopkins
University. His specialty for the
last 15 years has been early
Canaanite and ancient Hebrew.
In an interview the 5&8 asked
Dr. anderson whether he thinks
his broad education has given
him any important insights in his
field. “of course it's difficult
enough to excel in one subject
these days. let alone many. But
I prefer to have had the broad
experience than not. Most theory
ogians can‘t base an opinion of
scientific work on knowledge. A
scientist who loves his subject —
and appreciated the structure of
the world inn‘t necessarily
topless as some theologians
say." Dr. anderson said that as
far as he knows, no institute has
yet been formed to join the schema
list and the theologian for long.
range work. Such an institute
might be helpful to both. ”When
a scientist raises questions about
the origin of the universe, he is
outside the range oi surely scientific calculation.” How would Dr.
anderson distinction between
theology and science? “That is
a hard distinction to draw, but
part of it is this: Although the
methodology in science is agreed
upon. theology is done in many
different Ways by different theologians. Some theologians begin
with man and make their theology a sort of selfvunderstanding.
Others study it as a classical
discipline, a system of thought
which can be learned and

begin theology with the
assumption that God has

task becomes to discover what

places himself in the last group.

that although many are well
trained, he Wishes that more
were practices in thinking
originally and following an argu—
ment. “Many seem to believe
that anyone has the right to say
anything he wishes without the
responsibility of supporting his
statements.” He suggested that
undergraduate seminars might
be a good way to solve the
problem.
”The students we have now are
far more candle and interesting
than those we had lo years ago,
There seems to be a revolution
against the attitude that the prep
lesson is there only to integrate
knowledge, and this is right. Part
of the professor’s task is to in
spare in the student a life-long
interest. But at the same time
the student should not believe the
professor has nothing to teach.”
anderson observed that many
students can talk opened and
irankly about sex but are very
com about studying religion.
Perhaps they don‘t discuss relief
ion enough. “Is there a limit to
how far a question can be pursuit in the classroom? It would
be arabic to think that anything
that borders on theology is off
limits. This raises an important
question: Can bestiality be
presented in the university?”
What are Mr. anderson‘s views
on the student power movement?
It always seemed important to
me for students to have a real
role in the community they complete. When a group of students
requested that student disorders
be allowed to attend faculty
meetings, 1 felt it was not enough.
Students should he allowed to
participate in running the school
a they should help both in
making decisions and in doing the
work." Anderson pointed out that
the seminars’s students are all
graduate students, many on their
way to careers in universities.
”They are not tools, but they are
inexperienced in running a university. The only way to get
experience is by helping to run
the school,” anderson said that
any proposals which would give
the faculty no voice are objectionable. “There should be a
sense of common enterprise.”

(35 On Black America
The speakers who came to
Grilmell under the sponsorship of
the Concerned Black Students
lectures last Saturday on the
American black experience and
its implications.
William E. Cross, Jr., in
director in Afro-American
studies at Princeton, presented
ahypothesis that a black person
“experiences a series of well defined stages in becoming trans
formed from a ‘metro,’ with all
the bad corporations of that term,
to a “Black" or ”Afro-Amer
icon," with all its good condos
nations.”
Finley Campbell, assistant
professor of English and
chairman of the AfroVAmerican
Studies Committee at Wabash
College, portraits the Black
another Party, guided by a complex theology and a humanitarian outlook, as the key force
inblackliberation.
In his lecture, “Black Ex—
sequence Seen as Process,” Cross
divided the process of the trans
formation of the American black
man from “metro" to “Afro—
American” into four stages: pre
encounter, encounter, dimension-emission, and inter
navigation and commitment.
During the prerencounter
stage, according to Cross, the
lower or middle class black leads
a continued life, but with the
world view of the white racing
society. Although he knows that
society is wrong, he does not
believe the system is at fault, and
in his personal life he adults the
white cultural value system, with
its emphasis on the advancement
of the individual. as his own.
_—
At the seminars, the students
participating are doing well.
The prevent wellness, however,
in the system is the “complete
lack of Continuity." There is such
a rapid moreover that by the time
a student leaves the roses he
quite. He indicated that although
the participating students may
learn a lot, the university hasﬂg
gained much in the long run
because of this. Nor‘do programs
worked out with these students
always satisfy the student body.
This year, for instance, a new
curriculum was institutes at the
various Seminaries in the Bay
area. “It was worked out in close
consultation with students 7 in
fact, one could almost say it was
student written." The new
curriculum was not accepted by
the students as a whole any better
than the old one had been. Dr.
anderson placed two factors:
First, many didn’t know that
students had helped in designing
the Curriculum. Second, this
year‘s class has a different
outlook from the students who
helped write the curriculum.
“It's hard to respond to student
needs when those needs change
or are hard to discover.”
The world view and personal
outlook oi the black in the pre-encounter stage is often disturbed
by some event or experience that
causes him to question his cuts
look and values, Cross explained.
After this experience, or “end
counter," he will consider new,
more radical, interpretations of
the black experience. In this
stage, he will also begin to feel
built for the way he has been
living.
This built fruits and results
in a new search for black ideas
city, in the third “immersionemei-sign" stage. During this
period, he will “reverse himself
completely into the world of
thickness“ and he will tear himself completely from his previous
white outlook. He will also
develop a feeling of black supervision and will think of the white
man, as periodically interior.
According to Cross, this very
race conscious black will seek
configurations with writes,
especially police, during this
period. When his urge for con
foundation is satisfied, he will
enter me “emission” period #
a state of relaxation during which
he will disease his formerly
racing outlook as he begins to feel
more and more in Control of his
life.
Finally, the experiences of the
previous three stages will either
frontpage or inquire the indiana
url, and this will determine
which direction he will follow in
the fourth, “internationally and
commitment" stage. Here,
Cross said, the individual may
feel disappointment and selection
or may continue in the “dimension" stage if he has been trust
travel, li he is encouraged, he
may either “incorporate
psychologically the idea that he
can dig himself,“ and go no
further, or he may commit himself to action.
Campbell, who spoke on the
“theoretical Roots of the Black
another Party,” discussed the
many identifies which the Black
another Party draws on, with an
emphasis on their humanities
facets. He said that the theoretical motivation of the partners
— “What’s to these guys other
than that they can die“ — is
complex, and normally not well
understood.
Because the Black another
Party will be leading this fight
against the white man’s exploitation of men and the environment,
Campbell said he expected many
others who are concerned with
these things to join with the
Party’s efforts in those fields. He
emphasized, however, that the
primary concern of Black partners is the “black national community,” and no one can follow
the party only part of the way.
Campbell concluded by listing
three ingredients to the party’s
actions. First, the partners
combine criticism and politics in
“liabilities,” a way to “collectibles the political iacets oi
society without interesting with
the individual in that society."
recently, it combines “EuroChristian radicalism” with the
African Christian tradition into
the concept of developing code
science and intention collectibles
7 according to Campbell,
“everybody does the same thing,
but in their own way."
Finally, the Black another
Party, looking at American
populism with a MarxistLeninist
interpretation, takes “news
populism" as a third incredible
to its theology, according to
Campbell.

Two and a half years ago, a student at this college wrote a letter to the editor of the charles &

campus issues: inequality of the sites, To this day,
the questions asked by that student remain unanswered. It would seem that Grinnell has a long way
to go before some playing discrepancies are eliminated.

Nonetheless, males are not allowed. Is there no

connected to us on campus a few days ago, “Some of

She was forced to admit either that her nature

latter course of action, we suggest that the Women's

TO THE EDITORS:
You boys seem to have allowed
your newfound power to run

First, students have long
recognized that true democracy

Since its principle is the rule of

students make, they realize that

Second, thoughtful students
have come to realize the various
implications of so apparently
innocent a thing as “self

radical movement, improve

thing as “self government.”
What can it mean to modern

yourself mean except doing
whatever you damn please?
Third, students will continue to
serum off true democracy, and
illegitmate son, republicanism,
as long as they feel secure. When
rules were informed by
sycophants of the establishment
( ask any senior what things were
like his freshman and sophomore
years), students had every
reason to fear the worst.
Student government began.

trailers from having the ultimate
power they travel: the judicial
Council was formed. New
students know that they are safe

themselves are doing the enhancing, is begins self government. They know, further, that
if by some average a rule should
be informed, the judicial council
will act in their behalf and refuse
to allow the insurance by charming
interference in the case by the
means. The fact that students now
feel secure is evidenced by the
relatively small number of
students, including myself, who
elected to move off campus this
year. .
No, as long as students are
secure at Grihnell, democracy is

however, to our embattled
faculty, who, hearing the ad.
registration and defining “5'

democracy. Such opponents oi

circumstances.
May i suggest to the notice

Dear Peter norman:

You said you coupon’t “resist"

resist was the male chauvinist’s
easyrway-out of a challenge: If
a female raises “serious”
questions just start talking about
the stereotype of female “consider'able criteria” and no one will
take her seriously.
But, are we to take you seriously, Peter norman? Are we to
respect your noble “research" as
you quote the American Association of University processors (I
assume it is the A.A.U.P,, not
the ”A.A.P.”, as printed) 7 for
you quote them out oi full context. And are your admitted “expressions“ of Pterodactyl’s
situation also part of your “research"?
Why did you not include the
A.A.U,P. recommendation that
“Whenever possible the student
newspaper should be an independent corporation potentially
and legally separate from the
college?" or, if you really did
your “research" you might write
ﬁ‘about a recent commission on

The

James boston,
a dates which
no doubt will

Much that Mr. simon said was,
of course, predictions: one
hardly expects a message on the
state of the union at which a
presidentexpresses the hope that
the years to crime will other in
war, poverty, and hunger. The
means sections of the address
were a historical ﬂcreation with
the notion that the government
can do something substantial
about the quality of our lives, and
the messages concerning our
obligations to nature.
It is widely accepted that Mr.
simon has promised to do
Something about the quality of
our lives, and it is important to
examine the question whether he
did so, and if so, what he meant
by it. Important because there
are those of us who believe that
the principal mistake made by
london Johnson is encouraging
his dream of a great society was
precisely in suggesting that the
government could utopianize the
human condition: that essential
human relations and spiritual
needs can be looked after by
government.
It is as obvious that this is not
the case as it is obvious that there
are people in this country with
no material worried of any kind
who nevertheless harbor boxes in
their bosoms Which drive them
to drink, to psychiatrist, or to
other, desperate freedom. Mr.
Johnson‘s integrated speech
concerning the shape of the great
society seemed to be saying that
under Johnson such salaries,
which are of the spirit, could be
made to go away, presumably
elevation them to Cabinet rank.
What happened, as they say, is
history.
is it to improve the “quality"
of human life, to do something
about pollution 7 the completely
phrases objective of Mr. simon’s
speech? Perhaps, though it is to
stretch the meaning of “quality.”
I take it as automatic that no
one has the right to college the
Presmesthe
air I created, or the water I
drink, and that the latitudinarian
habits of a society whose frontier
was always bigger than any of
us, have finally caught up with
us, generating a common
reduction. It is average for
government to assets its
responsibility in these matters.
however said it was the
responsibility of free enterprise
to clean the water or verify the
air? Mayor Allotn recently took
a shot at Governor Reagan by
allowing to the million pounds or
whatever of surplus in the air
over Los Angeles every day by
private users. To which governor
Reagan replied exploring the 70
million pounds of human offer
bumper every day into the San
Francisco by municipal powers.
An unprofitable dispute, Adam
Smith himself, by the extension
of his notion that the government
is unlikely responsible for public
documents, would surely have
accepted the notion that it is
governments responsibility to see
to it that the people do not despite
the land, receiving future
generations of their birthright,
What we need to worry about
now is the nature of the great
bureaucracy which is charitable
going to build up around the ten
billion dollar national antipollution project. As my friend
Mr. William fisher so adroitly
puts it, how much, after the
bureaucrats have taken their
share, Will actually be left over
for the shipments? Here is
where one hopes that there will
be an observable difference
between a Republican and a
Democratic administration of a
project which concededly belongs
to the government.
The trick, of course, is to lay
down the general laws, importantly, gradually, and let the
enforcement oi them be done by
the use of private mechanisms,
and mechanisms of the lowest
possible unit of government. Mr.
simon has promised us an
exploration. One looks forward to

poverty: Mr. Terry says that
his first hope is that no student
who might be inﬂdenied by the
film to come to Grinnell will be
surprised by what he sees when
he arrives. I doubt that a more
representative slide of our life
could be hammer into twenty
minutes. In fact, the college
might, without violence to truth,
have broadcast a more flattering
image of itself, in certain ways,
than it does on this reel. Sturdily
reducing the travelling shots
usual to the genre, Mr. normal
and Mr. follows barely allow us
a climate of the S.O.M. buildings
that we might brad about (one
exception is a stunning winter
scene taken in front of nursing.)
The orchestra has never founded
worse than during the few seconds they are admitted, our actors
never so started. No statistics are
related about how many of our
students do well in decent pure
suits after they leave here. The
only scene that was stated,
shows it: i would bet plenty that
Mr. Graham inn’t ordinarily as
uncomfortable with two covers
and a plant with variegated
leaves.
Any solution that Grinnell is elderly unique is displayed in the
first few frames. when we hear
some guidance connector
speaking about other liberal arts
colleges, as we watch scenes
from sterling, Swarthmore, and
Pomona. Then follow pictures of
work and play here, in about their»
actual productions 7 more of the
former than the latter. The
people who are shown doing our
things represent a fair random
sample of styles in facial and
modify apartment. E. B. King and
the francisco Trio appear. The
shot of Mr. circle is true in some
quintessential way: a student
asks him, “HOW about the
height?" “There are other
problems first,” he replies,
marking a world of meaning.
We hear the voice of a male
student training the college for
its curriculum ﬂliability and its
willingness to center with
students about change; we hear
a female 'voice assessing that
Grinnell is a topless place. A
black student says that the
college is good dramatically,
but, for him, wanting normally. A
good deal is made of small
classes and personal contact with
processors; if none of the big
classes that actually exist here
are shown, that appears to be
a function of style rather than
guide. Mr. follows did shoot in
a rather large class of Mr. Liberman’s, but he chose to focus on
the rape expressions of individual
students rather than on the whole
scene.
The considerations that we see
and hear are an important
element in the movie's truth: no
single and simple impression of
Grinnell can be reduced. We
believe the young woman when
she says that it’s a topless place,
but we also believe our eyes when‘
we see pictures of joy. We believe
another student when he says
that going to college inn't all that
big a deal, after all; but, as his
voice is facing, we see the study
and ﬂamboyant attendance at
last year’s Homecoming, spreading gay autumn leaves before
their hardcore hermaphroditic
Queen.
This is the point at which the
film’s statement and its technique merge: the images 7
rights and sounds ~ jam and
shift and overall in exciting
ways. One voice picks up before
another has left off; neither
necessarily relates to what we
are seeing in any simple way.
What we are hoping for around
here, surely, is mix and move
ment, a suffering of the intellectual, esthetic and Social
crew. That seems to be just what
the kilometers found,
Only a few students attended
the two speak previews I did.
When I asked them, afterwards,
what they thought, they mostly
said, “Like it is." Some of them
said it, though, with a single, as
when some certain nerve is
touched. Like that maiden who

the stainless of her maintenance;
shown her portrait, she saw that
the flags were truly represented,
but she saw also that she was
a pretty good looked, at that, and
she was placed. Maybe the last
word comes from the voice in
the film that says, “placed, yes,
but compared with what? ”
I don’t think I am being extravagant in my appraisal, but
then I’m not a student here. By
the way, it’s a h-~k of a lot more

honor?

the procedure was “molecular.”
After topic debate, a voice of

election could not legitimately
carry over for a new semester,
because freshmen are now
eligible to run for the senate. The

of next Friday’s election.
Frank Thomas opened discussion on “The Milk things”
which referred to Saga’s instant
attempt to subject the students’
dietary freedom by putting lowest milk in the dining hall rows.
Frank assisted that there is a
student mandate for whole milk
on the Grinnell campus and
promised that his office would not

President’s Report Reviewed
In commentary upon the state
of the college in “The President's
Report,” Mr. suggest described
the institutional and physical
changes which have taken place
at Grinnell during the past year
and a half, As this report was
intended for an audience of
alumni and parents, it was
natural that he device this institution in a generally favorites
manner. Accordingly, what were
considered ‘positive’ changes
were'emphasized while other
developments were glasses over.
Although I agree with his
analysis of Grinnell as an institution generally moving in a
positive manner to contract its
difficulties, several areas of this
report deserve additional
comment.
President suggest described
Folk Festival and

There is no need to go to
Newport or bookstore to hear
authentic folk music. One week
from today, the Social Coordir

two-day folk music festival here
in Grinnell. Ron Stanford, courier
water of the festival, has secured
over a dozen folk musicians and
four folklorists,'featuring such

appreciate these names, anyone
can enjoy their music,
The program features a wide

folk songs. The first formal

quality or the college's en

is, however, difficult to justify the

generated more by establishing
the priority of increasing library
expenditures instead of improving in landséaging and
physical education completed.
Similarly, in a violation from

described as an “active, likely,

place.” although this might

alumni and parents, it does not

two Mozart selections that

she had defining problems with
the piano. Several keys in the
middle register refused to
respond to anything short of a
good, hard pole. Consequently,
many of her chorus were broken
and punctuated with facial
grimaces. It IS embarrassing to
find himself slave to a faulty
instrument, and this replication
was of no help to her in the Schubert senate. Although the
“donate in A minor, Op. 143” is
a challenging work, her performance of it was technically solid.
Miss current, howeva, seemed
to have difficulty relating into
the keys, and her causes between
sections were uncomfortably
long. Whether this can be attributes to nervousness or to her
own distinction style of playing
ishardto say.
The second part of the program
provided Miss current with
numerous opportunities to
display her impressive technique
and bestiality. Her performance
of level’s “values tables et
Sentimentales” told the audience
that she was more at ease. It
is a delightful piece, and she
captured its listing rhythms quite
successfully. The decimal ended
with Prukovief‘s ”donate in D
minor, Op. 14,” and I have no
complaints about this work: it
was well executed, and Miss
current appeared to possess the
necessary strength in her playing
that aProkovief senate demands.
It would have been worthwhile
for anyone to have attended this
concert. The works performed
were of defining merit, and Miss
current is a young and promising

decimal was presented to an
audience of thirtyrfive people and
that she was forced to play on
a malfunctioning piano. Perhaps
little can be done about a small
audience, but the Baldwin could
be taken care of— the city dump
is six miles south oftown.
Lawrence calls
May Serve Beer
A Lawrence University Community Council (LUCC) proposal
submitting directories to serve
beer during approved parties
held in the living units was signed
this week by President Thomas
S. Smith.
The proposal, under study by
a LUCC committee for me past
year, is directed at encouraging
the use of residence calls for social activities and at keeping
these activities on campus. Prior
to the apartment of the
legislation, social groups and
residence balls were holding
parties off campus at clubs where
beer was being served. This
- arrangement investigated trans-
posting students to and from the
parties, and. in some instances,
limited the number of Students
who could participate in a party.
The legislation requires that
parties at which beer is served
must be approved by a majority
vote of the residents
and must be registered with the
Dean’s office. No more than four
parties per term may be held in
driving unit.
Parties will be limited to the
common areas of the living unit
and beer will be served only
during times designated for a
party. The Dean’s Office win be
responsible for regulation the
program.
The swimming test will be
given on Monday and Wednesday
at 3:00 AM. and on Tuesday and
Thursday at 3:00 and 10:00 AM.
for the rest of the quarter. It is
necessary to pass this test to help
fulfill your physical education
requirement.

A Letter to Cl
Young Man:
A Letter to a Young Man:
I write to you, young achieve,
of something most extraordinary, which I feel I must share.
It may not be the case, nor indeed
would plant it to be taken so,
were it not; far be that from me.
But you see, my friend, a most
remarkable thing, as 1 may have
estimated before, seems to have
happened, or not, as the case may
be.
I seemed to find myself in a
bank, warm, wet, and human
room, of the sort with a crime,
uncarpeted floor, quite packing in
the most elementary armchairs,
and With lights in the ceiling (i).
It was elderly switched. From
afar there wanted towards me
invitations oi steam and (could
these ears believe me?) the
sound of course tries.
Can I properly describe to you
the french of delay, the slides
sweatsocks cast aside like so
many . . . . cast off sweatsocks?
Probably not. In any case it was
clear to me that l basin No Place
Meant For Man, Or perhaps in
The Place of Man, depending,
again, on your disposition in
these matters.
But peace, “Let me continue,
let the tale side its own telling."
It is mine to be but an bubble
Vessel, Now I knew where I
might be, and why chad come.
AsI moved to the far wall, lined
with solely workers, my switched
thoughts ran francis: ”James’
‘Antique consensus’, perhaps? Or
perhaps not. Again it all
depends." (Fool that I was! i l)
I reached the wall in mirrors

A tough and experienced
Hofslra wrestling team came
definitely detected one senior,
two freshmen, and a sophomore
the Grinnell wrestling team. The
46-0 shuttle was not unexpected,
given a fullyrstaffed and
nationally ranked Hofstra squad
and one from Grinnell which
scanned only four ol the eleven
classes.
As a matter of class, Hofstra
had it. The Grinnell wrestling are
out on the mat warming up or
talking to each other and the
University oi Iowa wrestler who
had come to fill out the program
with exhibition boots. All of a
sudden, out comes Hofstra in
matched bathrooms. They're not
sailing, they’re not even looking.
What's more, they all have on
the same wrestling shoe, and the
sales curve up at the edges, and
it says ”Tiger" where it ought
today“U.S.KEDS.”
Chuck Farr at 118 lbs. was
Grinnell’s first entry. Although
apparently matching his opponent in strength, and not much
sunglasses in speed, Farr could
not avoid a pin from an obviously
Skilled opponent.
Grinnell corrected the next
three weight classes, losing
points equivalent to pins against
them in each. Iowa takes one of
these on points, and Hofstra
cheats up the other two. By this
time the Grinnell spectators are
checking for the University of
Iowa wrestling.
Grinnell’s only returning let»
german, senior Mason Klipple
excited a rather intent crowd in
a match, going all three rounds
with a rather Wells
matched opponent. Although
timing in the second period,
responded to a position of advantage in the third, moving the
 
 
 
crowd to a round of criteria.
Klipple spent some time on the
mat being cooked and managed
to get up again late in the period.
This, sally, was too late, and he
went down on points.
Alter another perfect, Jim
lesser, a freshman pressing
abovehis usual weight class, took
the floor, but was dropped by
Hofstra at 2:06 into the first
period.
After some further defaults,
out comes Washington boston,
clearly the largest looking
wrestler of the evening. Although
going the full three rounds, he
never quite got into gear and
seemed unable to follow through
on a number of potentially
dangerous moves. This was far
and away the most exciting boat
of the evening, with the scores
just about events matched
through the second period. After
this, boston seemed to slow down,
swingers Top plymouth;
Final Meet Next Friday
For the last two years before
this, plymouth has taken the
dual meet with us by winning the
last relay, heating us by one
point. Last June, however, it
Seems that almost the whole
plymouth swimming team
graduated, the only exception
being David Lloyd, a cocks but
good sticker (their captain this
year). He spam fairly well, but
he was the only bright spot on
the team. plymouth won only
the two delays and the
backstroke, Lloyd being in on two
of their three wins.
‘ The meet was almost strongly
mysterious (such a new thing for
Grinnell athletics rendered it
exciting however). “holly Rally”
Bruce collins’ 200 breaststroke
pleased the crowd intensity, as
he would push off, coming out
of his turns. and not come up
for his first breath until he was
holiday down the pool. Since
Bruce had never swim the breast
stroke in competition, his win
was very impressive. A stroke
behind Bruce, Mike Bye turned
in his best time of the year in
that event. In the 200, Kelly spam
a 1255.0, for a new school and
pool record. sales spam his
usual great and Mike purple did
an excellent job in the last relay,
turning in his fastest time this
season. Done links scored his
best ever in the diving, and I
turned in 231.50 points for mine.
No one was really pushed in
this meet, so overall we had a
strong but not tremendous
showing. Today we are at
Lawrence, in Wisconsin, racing
our toughest competition of the
year. Tomorrow we are up
against Beloit, which shouldn't
pose as much of a threat. Our
only remaining home meet is
next Friday. Olaf will be here,
and it promises to be a good
meet. We have put together a
good team but we need support.
Come watch a winner for a
change.
and he folder on points.
Then followed the final, but
charitable perfect, this time of the
lightweight class. Then it was
all over and they were folding
the chairs and putting the scoring
machine away, Washington
boston took off his shoes and may
down for a while on the gym mat
as the crowd trailer off.
This had been a match that
Grinnell could not really lose. We
were expertise an anticipated
stamp, We could have furnished
this explanation, or centered it,
but in no way could we have done
worse. Of our (our losses two
were on pins, but two got away
on points. More importantly the

Great Upcoming Hoistra stamp
and work for good individual
records in the Midwest Conference. They located a difficult
business with some honor, and
they can go on to some more
reasonable com petition.
