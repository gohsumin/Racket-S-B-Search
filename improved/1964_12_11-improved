headers to the Editor
Prof proposed Periodic Assembly of College Community
To the Editor:
There are some great events
here at Grinnell that are known
only to a few. More members
of the college community
should have been told in advance last week to spare an
hour for Dr. Li of the University of Iowa and for Mr. David
mainland of Carleton College.
I have heard many lectures in
art history, but never one so
good as Li's on “lung Landscape Painting.” I have heard
many talks on question and.
answer, on hearing and listen
ing and responding. but never
one so good as maryland’s “On
Listening.” Robert McMillan
and Roger Eldridge are models
men. They didn’t short at you
when their guests came. But
these men had something very
important to say, said their
messages well. Many students
who didn’t miss these events
were deeply impressed and expressed degree at the small attendance.
I have often missed a good
lecture or concert or play. I
used never to miss a good mo»
die. Why? Because I had two
friends who followed the reviews and who elected me
Weeks in advance so that I
could budget my time. I miss
these friends very much; oh, I
still have one who knows mo»
view and I turn to him for advice. Why can’t someone provide information about speak—
era and artists and scientists
who are to appear? Surely the
Grinnell Information Service
can get the ordinary census
vitamin, the who's who stuff.
But this needs to be supplemental by someone who knows
the guest personally and can
relate his interests to ours. I
would like here to express a
 
word of appreciation to Mr.
Eldridge and to his secretary
for having provided copies of
Samuel Miller’s most recent
articles. I found them in the
R. A. R. and scanned each of
them. They helped me to understand what the Gates features‘ was driving at. And indeed I picked up a book of
Dean Miller after he reported
and followed up the theme of
metaphor in my philosophy
Classes. May I add that I find
every public event a great stem»
plus to work in my field and
never. well, or almost never, a
destruction.
Perhaps students think of
Grllinell College as a place for
lectures, plays, and concerts
but not a place for persons,
The persons are indeed integrated related to the worship of
God and one may say that
there is no God, or that whatever commit force there is never asks in he played to or to
be trained in song. Or at least
doubtless he never told you that
one day in seven was sacred
and that you should go to His
house to listen to His prophet
proclaim the Word, You may
add that this version of meta—
physics is promotion arld out<
model and that you hate to
aid in the confirmation of intersection. relatively'you may
say that the spiritual life can
be better calculated through
the illustrations of the xerox
quarter, and our moral server better shared into the Civil
Rights Movement. Music and
determination, you may argue,
are the religion of the modern
intellectual, along with fine
sexual relations.
I should like to answer these
difficulties not from my own
experience but from testimony
of sir Julian Huxley. Huxley
is not only a great biologist but
 
Berry Discusses Forum Uses.
response to 'related Sectors'
To the Editor:
The Forum has just opened
and already indignant projects
of “betrayal” can be heard
among certain decided sectors
of the student body. “They're
trying to civilian us” runs the
due and cry among certain
young justice. My own response to these catholic whom»
pets is “Get off it, Jack, you're
just. yellow!" because I think
these people misunderstand
the infections of the Forum’s
creature.
For my money the Forum
represents a recognition by the
powers that be that we students
have had a legitimate vacation
with the former darkness of
Grinnell. In fact we must have
made our case awfully well by
the looks of things, because the.

Forum is not going to be of<
funded. The Forum is so completely passed, encountered,
berugged, hedraped, patient,
formerly etc. that a great deal
of auctions and cacapho‘ny are
not going to upset its composite.
As a matter of fact, I think
the planners oi the Forum will
be disappointed if students
don't tear up the per patch and

I should like also to add a

when Beloit complicated its
Chapel. I believe his points

our community and of the relation of other fields to the ideas
there presented are true,

well pleased with their calculations to launch the betty Ross
Flag and Banner Company to produce these unique creations
Mainly because the first banners were the products of
"pop” and “hard edge” artists associated With the Graham
galleries. the banner in this stage of American history is
largely thought of as a vehicle for express1on of the most
modernistic trends in American art.
The banners are being produced by a group of New
.York’s seventh avenue seamstresses, normally in the ﬂbreaking business, under the close supervision of Mr. Graham’s
avantgarde artists, from whose “cart ons” or designs for the
basic pattern of the banner is seen the final product in
groups of twenty with the artist’s name monogrammed on
the rear of each.
The banners have been made in various materials (nylon,
plastic, silk) and sizes, but are most commonly featured in a
felt wool combination and have dimensions of five feet by
seven t'get. The banner is a revolutionary art concept in that
its polished aluminum ross allow it to be hung easily without
frame or glass casino and its durable texture allows it to be
rolled up correctly and even regularly dry»cleaner. Most
importantly, the large size and moderate cost of the banner
(produced so far for $300-$600) answer an immediate need of
the architect and designer for publishing his structures with
attractive and practical art objects.
The banners hanging on a permanent basis in the
Forum are entitled, “The New Old Glory" and “Black and
Red,” and are the works of Robert Indiana, and Jack Younger
man respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Touch of cameron decades Forum;
Wall rankings Echo Old Tradition
By Wayne Stengel
With all the administration’s pride in both the attractive
utility and unique qualities of our new Forum, it should come
as a surprise to no Grinnellian to learn that the union grill
is furnished complete with a touch of cameron. This
architectural. link with the Middle Ages is not furnished
with statute of chain mail or a large round table, but rather
what Canadian Art Magazine has called “the first vital development s1ice photography,” the banner.
Much like the periodic banners visible reporting families’
costs of arms dating from thirteenth century Europe in form,
this art form is the direct product of the long 1962»63 New
York newspaper strike, which compiled those entertainment
med1a depending largely on advertising for business Such
was the case with Manhattan 5 Graham Art value1y, owned by
Robert graham, which was exhibition a collection of the um ks
of absti act1exist alfred lenses when the strike began.
In an effort to publicity lenses 5 work as best he could
Graham suggested that the artist paint a huge flag to fly outside the gallery. Graham 5 plan worked perfectly and lenses's
abstract, brilliantly- colored flag attempted so much attention
in its own right from Manhattan's art students and some wells
respected art critics, that it promoted Graham and his associates to first explore the possibilities of the transition from

Gala Social Evening~ Opens Forum:
Students lniiiale powerful Building
By Cynthia trust
Santa class based an early visit to Grinneil last Friday,
bringing with him the Ford Foundation’s gift to the campus
—- the College forums Wrapped in shine glass, with concrete
reasons and wooden buildings, this is easily the biggest and
most corporate toy any Grinnellian has ever received.
The Forum’s official opening was a 4-hour gale featuring
the adequate but not spectacular entertainment of the Rivieras
and Miss marine Sellers But the Forum itself was definitely
the star. Just wondering through the building in the afternoon was much more fun — gaming at the first permanent
student center at Griiineli and peoplerwatching. “It’s beautiful!" almost everyone even the most blade, agreed. But there
was also a feeling that this was something too rich for the
Grinnell campus blood; that no»one would ever be able to feel
at home in‘this glass palace.
By the end of that first evening, most of the lyrics had
had their say, and even the seniors managed to talk about
the Forum without mouthful references for the “log cabin"
of the past. _The carpet in the “too staff and formal” South
Lounge was buddy and sand had been skilled from an ash

Forum will be just another way to tell a “prospective.”
Some ideas about the future of the Forum were very
apparent even at the end of its first evening. The smallest of
the Private dining rooms are going to be very popular, and
the girls of the Quad may well be forced to drop their anti- \
domestic france for the romantic business of these tiny citizens and dining rooms. The music room might just surprise
everyone by being too small from the very start,’ especially
since coming attractions are made known to the whole campus.

almost sinful extravagance of the building, as well as its delightful “so different from the rest of the campus" atnios

going to go out of style at Grinnell,

5 Tonight the 1964-65 Grinnell college home basket—
ball season gets underway, and it could be one of the
those exciting ones ever. The team has already played
two games on the road, losing to Augustana 79-66 and
selecting pre-season Midwest Conference title favorite
. own‘all 99-82. 7
The emphasis this year will be on speed and conditioning as there is very little height. At 6‘5”, sophomore center Jim phones is the only man on the squad
over 6’3”, However, Augustana and Cornell are two of
the biggest, and supposedly best, teams that we will
face all year, and the Pioneers seem to have held their
Own. Also, a gathering man to man press kept the Cornell giants off-balance all night.
An interesting highlight at Cornell occurred before the game when Ram coach Paul Maaske led his
movies onto the court and handled Coach deutsch with
in hearing distance of most of our players, “I hate to
say it in front of your boys coach, but you’ve got a
bunch of rules here.” Coach deutsch, never at a locator
words, was not heard, but must have said something to
the effect of, “You're a real card Paul a you need to
be dealt with”; at which deutsch‘s team did
just that, leaving Maaske, I am sure, somewhat registered. All of this goes to show, I guess, that it’s a
620 over a 570 on those SAT‘s rather than brown which
matters in basketball, Anyway, it was a tremendous effort on a hot night (Grinnell shot 61% from the floor
‘and 82% from the foul line), and the only crimeﬁis that
more Grinnellians women’t able to see it,
