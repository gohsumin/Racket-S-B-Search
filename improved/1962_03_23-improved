I was in the Union Sunday
at about noon having a cup of
coffee, when Terry vision walks
ed in with a friend of his, who
was just passing through, a
man by the name of classes S.
beaver. He drives a l933 pros—
let station wagon and travels
around the country buying programs and feature articles for
Boy’s Life.
When I met him, he had just
made it from NYC to Grinnell
in 15 hours by driving very
fast. It’s easy to describe him.
He’s short and ugly and was
wearing to white golf cap and
a print shirt which made it look
like palm trees were growing
out of his belt. The two of us
were introduced and ‘he handed
me ”his card,” which had printed. in the right hand corner:
“Hi, neighbor! It’s a wonderful
world.”
We sat and talked for awhile,
but he didn’t strike me as being particularly intelligent. I
tried to express him by choir
ing how much‘ I know about
modern poetry and Kenneth
Koch. 1 said. “The shelter of
the Kingdom of Poetry is held
by the deaf, the dumb, the
blind and the freely. There
are too many slide people con—
nested with poetry. i am not

each other and organize to ﬁget
them but simply that lightning
should strike them.”
But Mr. cover didn’t have
enough formal according to fully
appreciate what I was saying.

though: “Poetry’s good, i guess.
But I haven’t lime to read
much and i haven’t much taste.
Mostly I just like beautiful
things.
Seeing that we didn't have
anything in common, I turned
the conversation away from
that subject. It wash't very
long, though before Mr. Weevcr asked us to show him
where the nearest supcrmnrkct
was so he could buy some
galleries for the rest of his
trip. 1 rejected to going near
one of “those electronic serum

way.
As it turned out, iv . Weevel‘
didn’t want to buy rings as
much as he just wanted to look.
He walked around Mciinliy's as
though in a trance, pointing out
how beautiful everything was.
I had come with him to result
him on his taste but ended by
following him up and down the
titles reading titles on soup
cars and dog circuit boxes and
studying their designs.
We spent most of the day in

to Mr. check taking Gold

that he was saving them so he
could get a clock radio for an

Later, he told us that we'd
been so nice to him that he
wanted to take us for a “spin"
in his car. On our way back to
the college to get his car, a
freight train was passing.
“Look,” Mr. \server said. He
was pointing and jumping
around very excitedly, I looked,
but all I could see was s train.
“Look at that! Look st it! It’s

We got in the ear and tried

SCARLET AND BLACK
Metaphysics of too/mapping,
Friday. March 23. I926
'Elms' story are letter topics -
To the Editor:
Thank you for publishing Pctc
Miller's article’ concerning the
case of the missing books. cards
ly a week goes by without my
looking over at our latest set of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
The missing volumes are 8, 13,
14. 18, 22, that is, EDWA to
EXTRACT, JEREZ to LlBE.
mm to MARY, PLANTS to
RAYM, TEXTILE to VASC.
It's very inconvenient not to
have those volumes, and 1 keep
hoping they will “turn up."
(Sure. Mac, just put them in
my mail box, or leave them, with
other library books still with the
call cards on the Union junk
table),
But what happened to them?
If we knew the cause, we might
subscribe a cure.
Perhaps Volume 3 was taken
because Mr. E. was using an
article in writing a paper. He
was late in his work, the libs
mary was closing, and that paper had to be in the next morning. So he fucked the book
under his arm and took it to
watson Hall. He got his paper
in; but could he take the E. B.
volume back? It was “hot.” So
he kitchen it, wrapped in last
Sunday’s Times. Little did he
know that our librarians do
make exceptions to the rules.
Sometimes reference books are
loaded. But he wash't taking the
risk of not having that article.
is there a cure, if this is the
cause? _
Perhaps Volume 13 was taken
because Miss T. reserved the increased tuition. She wanted to
get back at the college for taking her money in running a
country»club in addition to a cold
legs. She had her little revenge,
and got a $100 worth of satisfaction out of hearing up that
volume. is there a cure, if this
is the cause?
Perhaps Volume 14 had an
article in it recommended by
Professor P, Now Mr. F. had
not been doing the kind of work
that Professor P. loved in an
A‘iso sort of way. Mr. F. knows
a number of students in F001osophy cw who do less work,
put in less time, and really
laugh at Professor P. for living
their papers so well. They have
figured out what tickets him,
and they tackle him. Mr. F, is
frustrated, He's going to help
out those not covered by ProProfcssor P. How does the url
derdog set things right? He sends
volume l4 to the dump. Buildings and Grounds soon has the
EB. 14 with old red books and
while the leaves char around the
edges. and shell like an accordance, the professor and his map»
cupclishers arc in a slow burn
too, “Who could have done such
a thing? The sticker!" “Well,”
thinks Mr. E, “they’re so smart.
area’t they? Not smart enough
to catch me or go to the dump
for EB. 14.”
Perhaps Volume 15 was put
in Miss Exs book bag as a trick.
Miss E. never had even taken
out a book, absentrminded, professor-like; not Miss E! She
was always responsible. Just so
much of that, and it dress’t
have to be even uttcrcd in
monosyllables, let alone horse
isaac present or First Principles
of All Good Boys and Girls, and
things happen to people like
that Miss E, found herself in
warning cottage with EB. 18.
How did it get there? She’d take
no nonsense. She promptly put
it in her l'command’s wasllrbag."

18? Oh. yes, it was a sudden
mess. And all l'oomy’s things,
coventhings, undonthings, so
the
done,

Britannica. Justice was
wash’t it?
Perhaps Volume 22 was needed for a report, and Mr. TT.
had a horse of books. He‘dlSr
covered that if you want books
for yourself, you put them behind
the Congressional Records. Those
books are the distinct, because
no one reads them. Just hide
the books behind a few octavo
volumes. There they sit. Rarely
are they apparent, The professor was started with papers.
and cancelled the project that
made an article from 22 relevant. And there 22 remains,
further and further. remaining
until some dietary required finds
it behind his sources on house
Bill 39462X.
What do i suggest as a cure?
1, A application method,
such as specs, Xerox, persian,
available, as in many libraries,
at cost —— usually 10¢: a page,
as at SUI and Northwestern.
2. Some ways, as these
pages, for getting rid of departments without the sync
topic vandalism oi sporting
books,
3. Better preparation of Stu»
cents, and wider use of many
sources by processors,‘so that
nobody tools frustrated, and
everyone is contributing some
thing unique to every course.
4. Humor, that is, numerous
enough to know when inn‘s
fun, and where to stop .
5. it you do take a too to
your study desk, your cases,
than let there be I way ‘0 let
the others kmrw where your
horse is.
A person to check books by
a furniture is not a device to be
encouraged, It would cost thousands of dollars a you, enough
in a year to make any department’s holdings altogether stud»
king. And who can't beat the
game, if he is challenged by it,
and results being suspected?
1 want to understand the situation ﬁrss. How close do my
ﬁve theories come to covering
the kinds of motivation? Am I
at least right in holding that,
as in most areas of philosophy,
no one theory is adequate?
gui-c, Mac, if you know where
volumes 8, 13, H, 18 and 22 are;
really arcewonlt you tell me? I’ll
preston’t you tell me? all
really get them. And, by the
way, I ruled but sterling books
for sole, because 5 volumes out
of 24 area’t worth the paper
they’re printed on. And i know
another theory that's not fit to
print,

To the Editor:
This letter is directed not at
the writer of the lead story in
last wcck's 5&3 which told
told about the moral insurance
done to s metro student, but is
directed toward the paper's editor, upon whom must rest the
responsibility for such stories.
The headline to the story read:
“panama asks boycott of local
raceAbiased cafe.”
Even though many of us believe that The Three Elms did
show racial bias in the incident
involved, this is opinion and not
fact. The use of “race-missed” in
this headline is interactive and
borders on label, because there
is no legal proof and little nonlegal proof that the Elms was .
or is refurbished, even if the
term itself can be deﬁnew satisfsctorily,
Those familiar with my View 3
about racial preceding know that
1 am not merely interested by
it but am interested in doing all
1 can to eliminate it. The most
effective way for a reports to .
combat discrimination is to report examples of it effectively,
since a pro-integration report
alienntcs that part of the leadership which most needs to he '
reached.
Many of us felt last week's
5&3 editorial about the Elms
aﬂair was quite continuing. We
degree that the editor did not
think it was and so allowed his
news columns to mattress the
editorial.
