WHEN RUMORS RUN WILD ,
NEWS LEAK KILLS BOYCOTT
By NEIL FISCHER
(Editor‘s Note: In an attempt to gift through the boycott situation that modules
itself together all this week.
the 5&3 Staff conducted over
sixth Interviews and spent
over fifty man-hours. Two
scanners — Joshua facts and
David forward — deserve
credit for a good part oi the
following news analysis
which represents, the sol;
feels, an accurate account of
the events which locked the
campus for the last few
days.)
By the time the Forum opened a little after 2 pm. Sunday,
a very entering humor had
reached the 58:3 offices. TWO
or three different sources said
that Max Helfgott had gotten
very up-light some time over
the weekend at road Hall —
an oil»campus house at 1525
6th Ave. — during a discussion
of the Town vs. metro Student
problem.
They added that Hellgott
was trying to organize a consult of the tablet of Grinnell
by the entire student body of
the College.
That was a humor that reserved some checking.
But more wash’t any time to
do any checking.
On his way back to campus
Saturday, Helfgott — an olicampus senior —- showed D.
layer, owner of the East End
Grocery, a copy ot the plans
and asked him what he thought
0! the boycott idea.
LEFTOVER ON THE
MEAT COUNTER
The meat counter was a little
busy that day, and power
said he didn’t have time to
look at the photographer
paper Heltgott gave him.
Hellgott went. off to class,
and power left the document
out on the counter for all the.
town to read,
Prof. Alan Jones (History) —
also a member of the Grinnell
City Council — happened to see
it there above the raw camcorder.
The photographer sheet at
East End was, Helfgott said
later. “the only one then in existence — the only poster posted.”
Some townspeople found out
about it and got very up—tight.
The CuiHP found out about. it
and discussed it, according to
President Ron Cogswell, for
about live hours Sunday night;
they got very up—light. And, in
their turn, the metro continuing
on campus found out Heligott
was serious about the boycottt,
and they got very, very tonight.
But by then the football of
humor was going all down hill,
and everybody seemed involving to Stop it.
LARGE GROUPS
DISCUSSING
Monday large discussion
groups Could be found scattered all around campus * in
Main lounge, in the Forum
grill, in off-campus apartments, in North counter
rooms.
Some groups were continuing
plans for a weeklong, ”token
boycott" of the town.
Some were discussing the
necessity for and sustainability
of boycotts in general. Some
were making up new, wild humans.
Others — totally groups of
metro students »— were wondering if boycotts might not be
the wrong answer after all.
Meanwhile Helfgott and his
group were trying to get intervention to the student body

But while Helfgott’s predomhrantly White planning group
was mounting with the College
administration and Service Bureau, a group of about sixth
students — almost all degrees

The group did not decide on

even the lime {or another meeting.
It did decide on a president

Forbes, representing “around
lets of us," told the 5&3
that the group did not support
Helfgott‘s boycott and would
have nothing to do with a layout in the lawn of Grinnell.
He told l-leligott the same
thing Tuesday.
But replication notwithstanding, Helfgott went down to
Grinnell Office Supply and ran
off “a few" copies of the Collegersuppressed document, put
them on posters reading
“THINK ABOUT IT . . .
THERE ARE ELEMENTS ON
THIS CAMPUS WHICH BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION
IS TOO CONTROVERSIAL
AND SHOULD NOT BE DISTRIBUTED T0 STUDENTS,”
and posted them in the college
postoiiice, the Quad dinner
line, and the bulletin board at
Cowles.
“There have been many instances of laboratory names allen g (‘bigger,' ‘Jigaboo,’
etc.) from high school kids,"
the poster read, “who are not

Helfgott‘s profiles were just

One oi the students present
at the TriOrBully configuration
at Wayne's greenhouse (“the

rather vehemently —— to remove her name from the pos.
term.

Helfgott found himself “table

entire mess to “everyone on

Heligott spent the next few

By JOSHUA SACHS
The meetings which have taken place in the last week are
a ﬁrss response to the harris
ment of metro students brown
the college by some elements of
the town of Grinnell.
The students feel that the atmosphere in the town is hosting
to them. “Whenever you're
downtown," said Junior Howard
Ward, “You get entered at.”
He added, though, that the merchants are friendly and that
the trouble comes mostly from
high school students.
Resident advisor delta Crawford received being called ”bigger” while out on dates in the
town. He also said that someone tried to start a fight with
him one night at the Pizza Pub.
He reported neither incident,
saying, “What can you do? You
can't pin it down to anyone."
Crawford added that he did not
know or a single metro student
here who has not been suspected
to some harassment,
GET IT EVERY DAY
Professor penis de Coteau
echoed Crawford‘s statement.
He said that he had had two
incidents in October, nothing
since then, but that be understood that “metro students get
it every day." De Coteau agreed with Word that the bmw
bee is mostly from some high
school students doing "what
they think is fun.”
Senior Mike Dejole agreed
that by and large his relations
DEAN RICHARD WINTERS
with the town have been friendly. He said his only trouble has
been with town resident Jim
Slebiska.
SLEBISKA-KELLEY
Slebiska has been implicated
in several unpleasantries, the
most noteworthy being a light
last year with Lou seller. According to seller, he (seller)
had been at the "sex” one night
when a fight broke out outside
between Slebiska and student
David Price. Lﬂu said he went
out to watch and that Slebiska,
shooting “i hate fingers worse
than anything," left Price to go
after seller. Lou tried to get
away but was presented by a
ring of towards watching the
fight. He at last located and
got back to his hall, where
Slebiska appeared a few min-
uses later and attacked him
again. The police arrived and
led Slebiska away. What happened afternoon is undertake.
seller Said that neither the
police not the college at»
reached him to see if he would
press charges. President suggest
and Dean Thompson both assured the 8&3 that the college
is willing to procedure but that
no students Could be found to
testing. The whole matter is
confused.
Slebiska told sophomore
trade Murdock several days
ago that Chief meters told him
that he was not to be in any
establishment in Grinnell at the
same time as a metro. trade
feels that Slebiska is inﬂsending
ﬂ'le conduct of the students from
the high school towards the metro students, but Slebiska said
that he dress't like the high

school people and wants nothing
to do with them.
TOWN UNAWARE
Most incidents of harassment
do not seem to have been reported to the college or the
police. However, President suggest said that he called the
meeting last Sunday at Grinnell
House because several metro
students had reported differences. This meeting was at—
tender by suggest, several pro
moment townspeople, including
Chief meters and Rev. John merger, and metro students Lou
seller, trade Murdock and Roy
Walker. Most of the people in
solved in this meeting felt that
its value lay in union-using the
townspeople that the problem
exists.
Most people in the town seem
to have been spyware of the
problem. Prof. de Coteau re<
rates how “after Martin Luther
King spoke, one of the owners
of usually's came to me saying, ‘That man King sure is
fantastic. Thank God we don’t
have anything like that in this
town.’ I told him an hour and
a half of incidents that I had
heard about and by the time I
was done he was nearly trying.
He had no idea that things like
that were going on."
Rev. merger of the St. Paul’s
principal Church, and director
of its student center, told the
San that most of the township
at the meeting were spyware
that incidents against metro students were frequent and that
fraction and department were
growing. He fell: this was partly
because metro students and pro«
lessons had been understandably
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
REVEREND JOHN HEDGER
resistant to discuss these sms
addressing differences.
The metro students tender to
explain the lack ot reports differently. They express the opinion that many incidents contained conduct ugly and alien.
site, but not illegal. When
asked whether reports had been
held back for fear of reservation
from some town residents,
trade Murdock replied, “Hell,
no."
Lou seller agreed that ”a lot
of people in the town were
made aware of things that they
hadn't known before.” He felt
the townspeople were sincerely
innocent of the situation, not
just covering up.
In a meeting held last weeks
by Chief meters. and the affiliate police, meters said that
most incidents had never been
reported. He tried that any
harassment, however initial, be
reported at once to the police.
BEING BLIND
Other people were not so con.
viewed. Professor tie Cnteau
thought meters bad a sentence
to play down everything that
has happened as unimportant.
"is he waiting for something to
really happen?” he asked.
trade Murdock said "I’m sort
of identical that they were talked entirely by surprise. The
meeting helped to direct consciousness." Sophomore Frank
Thomas said, "quite often when
incidents occur there is a education present. This is not a
matter of being spyware, but of
being blind.“
Already, attempts are being
made to alternate the tension.
President suggest considered his
meeting a beginning and expressed the hope that subsequent
events, such as a humor that
the college would boycott the
town would not make things
more difficult.
Rev, merger obviously Concerned over the incidents, inn
formed the 5&3 that he had
prepared about the problem

[ went to the Pizza Pub Mom
day night to talk to Jim precise
kn. Everyone on campus knows
big name: he’s “the big tough
from town who beat up Lou
seller twice one night last
Spring. and has been marketing
degrees in town all year” —
or so the story goes. His name
is always the first mentioned
when town . college problems
are discussed, and I wanted to
find out why.
when I walked Into the Pub,
Jim was at the bar ~ drinking

bar that he was going to a back
room where they coupon’t hear

months, We each had a code
Before 1 could ask a question,
Jim started.
“I known why you’re here.
Whenever there’s any trouble,
my name comes up. There's
one reason (or that — Lou seller. We handled one night. He’s
supposed to be the tough college kid, and I’m the town bad

Was the fight a racial issue?

women't around. So I asked
some other kids Where the degrees were They said ‘down at
the other end (oi the Ioggia)’
so i went down there. We got to
lighting again, and then the
law came and broke it up,
“lifetime latter. three Negmes and one white guy came
and told me seller wanted to

Anne Taylor’s weekly CAMPUS NOTES column on
page eight carries a head set in ST. CLAIR type face.
ST. CLAIR _ sometimes known as “circus type”
_ became popular in the Midwestern United States
around 1875 and is usually used only for headlines; it
“has a grey direct in mass use,” according lo a typographers’ handbook or the period.
The new head this week on PERSONALS (also
page eight) is set in KISMET, designed by Boston
printer John jumping in 1879. Horace Gi‘kelly’s New

He Says What He Thinks
When it comes to seeking candle comments,
you’re a hell of lot better off talking to Big colin Slebiska in town than talking to metro students on this
campus.
At least Big Jim will tell you what he thinks.
Based on the evidence volunteered —- the instances of verbal or physical aggressive against metro students actually reported by them — there
would seem to be no problem in the town of Grinnell, Iowa.
But there is.
After intervention almost everyone involved,
only a harmful of incidents were agreed on by degrees at the College.
But ask the same students — so resistant to report their own individual configurations with the
towards —— if there is incident racial violence in
Grinnell, and you'll find their teachers highly run-
ﬂed.
By now it should be obvious to everyone that
students don’t have to go to Chicago or Des points
to find incidents of racial sacred.
A lot of people ought to be failed up for the
‘trouble they’ve caused.
Everyone from Grinnell Chief of Police Bill
meters to Boycott-planner Max Helfgott agrees that
the College could have and should have pressed
charges against townie aggressive in a number of
instances.
Most people agree that the Police could have
and should have after more quickly in potentiallydangerous and often physically-managing configurations between town replies and metro college students.
And a good number of people rightfully think
that the Grllinell College White majority should be
totally infected for apache in the face of danger
to their Black follows.
But you can’t nail up anybody without evidence
and support.
And until metro students become willing to report what happened . . . until both White and metro students realize that quiet, lazy discussions
area’t the only solutions to which they can commit themselves . . . until the College demonstration
is posted by tragedy to act first and think about
town-down support later. 1 . until the activists learn
to plan before jumping to guns and boycotts . it
seems pretty unlikely the trouble will decline.
Max Helfgott after too soon. He adults it, and
there's no sense qualifying him for an error of judgment in the form of an information lead.
The College and the Police haven't after quickly enough, and maybe they can learn their lesson
before the real —— now potential — trouble starts,
The degrees haven't been candle enough in the
face of actual investigation. They remain covers and
self-threaded in mistress, mysteriousrless, and
secrets.
And Big Jim —— stereotyped the town fully ——
has simply got to be congratulated God help him,
he thinks he’s acting for the town of Grinncll.
But at least he says what he thinks.

As usual, when the Administration is corresponding a
basic change the students have
been kept in the dark as to
what the change will involve or
who it will effect,
More often than not the reason for this “lack of comment
station” has been that the Ad»
registration itself dress‘t know
what is going on.
This vacuum of knowledge at
or from the top has caused
rumors m be thrown at the un.
mary student with such validity that it is sometimes diiiiclllt
to separate the rumors from
the divine charles. But sims
ideas do stand in the background as actually being pr0<
totals.
The most certain of these
proposals is the principle ct
alternative forms or at least
computational computer, not to
be confused with computational
forms.
Dear Mrs. Low: Why on
earth would you want to co
execute, or rather integrate,

suit the same designation between surely male domain and
female? I refer to the south
campus wall system. What difference is there to men remain.
ing solely on North Campus
than to being placed at the
southern extremely of South
Campus?
1 can think of few things
that might help the social situation at Grinnell better than
alternative forms, Yes. alternate, like years: moments
Main: men; Cleveland: women.
This would keep men and women out or each: other's calls,
but would still give the atmosphere of one uniﬁed campus
and not two separate and distinct ones, How about making
Meal-s and Main the same sex
as East and West? Now it's I
long walk for a guy late on
Saturday night returning from
his chivalrous according of his
date to her "door".
The second most obvious proposal, it not now a fact, comes
to us as the allacampus mom
draw. In my opinion the status
gun is far superior.
Men, being what they are,
prefer rather set groups oi
friends, at least to live with.
When u freshman is placed in
a hall, he must mold himself
to his new environment, as he
will have in do under ”its new
system. But as it stands now
that male will remain in his
group of rather intimate friends
unless he wishes to leave his
hall, which he is tree to do.
Okay, I put in my plug for
the old system. Well at least
someone has come ollt into the
open and deferred a View, 1‘5cordless of its merit.

After midnight on July 14,
1967, l and my conditions
were driving in my station Wa'
inn, talking and listening to the
radio. As we reached the corner of South Orange Ave, which
was on our direct route home,
we were stopped by at least two
cartoons of white-selected police with shotguns and several
objectives. They advanced on
our van; we thought that at
most they would check us out,
ask ibm identiﬁnations, etc,
then let us go.
We were told to come out of
the car. When i opened the
door and stopped down, one detective, whom i recognized as
having once attended Harrigget High School while i was
there, reached up to me,
streaming that "we were the
bastards" who had been shooting at them. “Yes," he said.
“a blue panel truck." (My
station wagon is an olive-green
career bus.) I said that we
had not been shooting at anyone. I told the officer that I
thought i remembered him
from high school — whereupon
he hit me in the face and three
me up against the side of the
truck. (The others had also
been taken from the truck.)
The detective then began to
tab me as hard as he could
with his postal in my stomach,
asking, “Where are the guns?"
I told him there were no guns.
Suddenly it seemed that five
or six of the officers surrounded me and began to beat me.
i was hit perhaps live times
on top of my head by nightsticks, and when I tell, some of
the officers Went about periodically trying to break my
hands, allows and providers.
One officer tried to kick me in
the grown — and there were
many patches thrown. As they
beat, they kept calling me,
"Animal,” and asking me,
“Where are the guns?” Inside
the wagon, the heating continued. They took us from the
wagon and as I was pushed
up the states at Police Headquarters, an officer called out,
"Wait a minute,” then reached
me in the pit of the stomach.
I fell to the ground switching
my stomach.
Inside the station, Mr. Spfna
(the Police Director) was
standing behind the desk. I
asked him had he ordered me
better. He replied, “They got
you, didn't they?” — sailing.
An officer then granted me,
asked me to take off my belt.
He ran his hand in my pocket,
pulling out my wallet . . . later
I discovered that the officer
had taken about $65.00 and I
guestbook out of the wallet.
We were taken to City los
vital; i was changed in and
handcuffed in a wheelchair.
The “doctors" put in eight or
nine switches. (At no time were
we allowed to make a phone
call. At no time were we read
our rights.)
We were then taken to police
headquarters on Franklin St.,
iingerpdnted and brought into
the countries and arraigned.
The protection asked for $25.000 mail for me, which the judge
allowed. I was taken to Essex
County jail and put into military
requirement, where i remained
until I was released. (All options for covering the mail were
denied.)

Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.
You will have noticed that Mr. Clark Clifford, our forthcoming
Secretary of Defense, has been com on the question whether he in
a hawk or ii love, containing, as he put it, “such ornithological
categories." But the wisemen in Washington tell us that he is Com
viewed of the lightning of the Vietnam war, and indeed it is on:
likely that President Johnson would have appointed to sit at all
left hand someone who substantially disturbed with him on so important a question. It has even been whispered that Mr. Clifford
will pursue the objectives of victory in Vietnam more wholeheartedly than Mr. McNamara did, about whom the insider: tell of
great providing over the entire matter, an providing which cannon compare with the providing of American soldiers as they hear
skills drop over them which were manufactured in the Soviet
Union and found their way to the war front because Mr. McNamara — and Mr. Johnson -— agnnlze over world opinion.
But let us assume that the conduct of the Vietnam war will
proceed more or less at the pace or the last year or two, and hope
that the cumulative treasures on North Vietnam will begin to tell.
and that before long the military creating and training will state.
What then? What; will we see after it is over in Vietnam? A period
of peace in the Southeast Asian part of the world we are entitled to
expect.
But history teaches us the unlikelihood that there will be peace
everywhere in the world. And all the less likely considering the
techniques of the modern revolutionists, who have learned to cause
so much disturbance with so few men.
The qty-called wars of generation are certain to prove to be lit.
military Model A Ford of the 20th Century — cheap, durable, and
ubiquitous. All It takes is a couple of thousand guerrillas. I pipeline to the soviet union, a local the Guevara, and you are in
business. Inasmuch as the United States is primarily charged with
the responsibilities of counteraction, it is we who need to think beyond the Vietnam war and ask ourselves whether we are willing
again in pay so laugh - price as we will have paid in Vietnam in
order to contain other national generation prints in other parts of
the world.
Mr. Clifford should turn his attention to the problem, and surely the place to start would be by accounting a future commitment
to the volunteer army. If you like, to the secretary army. The
arguments in favor of it have been frequently rehearsed, as recently as in 1964 by both the presidential candidates. As is so often
the case with election year promises, nothing has been done, nothing in this case to phase out the draft. Perhaps the reason why is
the great manpower demands of the Vietnam war. But that is no
reason for putting off a public discussion of the volunteer military,
and it is always appropriate to bigthink about strategic matters
upon taking the path of notice.
The conventional arguments are that, e) a professional force
readers professional services. As things now stand, an American
technician becomes highly qualified, highly useful. by let us say
June, and in September his tour of duty is over. b) The extra cost
or during men into a professional military force is not likely to
exceed the great cost of continually training the millions of young
men whose services are used over so short a period. To which conventional argument should he added, {1) the great condition
caused by a draft, and the influence Of that condition on the
circulation of an effective foreign policy backed up by a mobile
armed force. ii the United States is going to help out next year in
Brazil, the year after in the Sudan, and the year after that in Nigeria, surely we do nor want to really the pensions of the existing
war? it is bad enough to concentrate another haltrcentury of financing resistance to the columnists throughout the world, but it
is more than flesh and blood can bear to concentrate a Slyyear
old weight Macdonald relating ills 25th consecutive invitation to
the White House.
The influence of American youth and their episode. the inlelieciuais, the academicians, the opinion-makers, the noisemakers,
on foreign policy is considerable, and in some ways healthy. Their
investigation to go and fight in these chubby wars in chubby parts
of life \world is altogether understandable. But until we simply
give up on the rest of the world, we have got to help out. And the
way to do that is primarily by making arms available, and also
small, professional forces which will absorb the Shock until such
moment as the locale are trained to attend to their own defense.
Perhaps someone in Washington will be good enough to question Mr. Clifford on the matter at his next press conference.

The total number of responses to the question extends

people thought that the decision should be a result of conversations from several element.

registered opposition to obstructionist tactics oi demonstration,
arising for the necessity of protecting. the right or students

Other comments concerned
the question of “who should decide what recruiting to allow
on campus A junior suggested
a “policy committee." The same
student was in favor of all military and industry recruitment
being held oil-campus — a south
ment repeated also in comments
by other respondents. A freshman thought that students
alone should decide ”since we're
paying for the facilities here."
The “comments" section also
showed a typical collection at
the currently popular campus
destinations about war, Dow
and recruitment. A senior to
epondent opened, “No college
or university has In obligation
to provide recruitment societies
for borders (sic) and modern<
meat spies.”
A sophomore denied the for-
losing conglomerate. “I do not
believe that an educational institution should allow military
recruitment on its campus. I
believe that in doing so it in
computing with an adjust war.
It is not the place of a free
thinking institution to take political france. it is an insteadﬂon

Another student expressed his
reaction to this type of reasoning. “it is beyond my understanding why the so-called Lih.
oral reasons are so dedicated
to tree association, but are so
hosting to the practice of that

NEWTON, can, Jan. 31
(ACP) — You could put your
price in the student govemmellt's suggestion box or write
a letter to the editor of the
college paper. Or you could tell
it to the world from a toolbox.
But at Bethel College in Newton, Kansas, the norwegian reports, you go to an old storage
room in the southeast corner oi

It's an “mortality room,"
where students release their

The mortality room was the

—'i‘iii Presidential commission

says the commission’s administrative state compressed much

,the researchers round in one

AS IS says that faced with
these reports, the Administrative ata.“ oi the commission,
in consultation with the White
House, decided Il'lat this information had to be compressed because:
It “would embarrass too many
people in an election year,"
—“There would be too new
kind words for local police, or
for local political leaders."
H'the report “could only sun‘

while the President is cutting

which is used by many government agencies for “think

proved that the entire center

THE EVENING STAR re

and on Sept. 19, it publicly
authorized for its two articles
based on signs’ information,
assessing that Airlie is entirely finances by independent
sources. But in a letter to
THE STAR written subsequently, signs pointed out
that THE STAR had examined only the tax and revenue data from Airlie‘s 1968
records, and reasserted that
it is the present control, and
not the present ﬁdancing, of
the center that determines
its legitimate.
Airlie House is suddenly In
the news this week, a the
International Association of

It as their meeting place.

have remained a completely

Mrs. Willie party, Washington ghetto mother androrganizer, Went to currently
to contract the police but

Meanwhile, signs has completed this account of the
history and control of what
probably is the most important conference center operating in this country.)
I: THE CIA IN
DOMESTIC POLITICS
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 22
(LNS) — in the wake of the
Ramparts magazine export of
the CIA’s relations with the
National Student Association
(Feb, 1967), the executive
branch of the U.S. government
— of necessity deeply involved
in the shenanigans — moved
shortly to contain the extent of
the revelation breach.
The President appointed on
February 15 a special committee changed by Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzen—
back, with NEW Secretary
John partner and CIA Director Richard terms as the other
two members. The committee
was instructor, in Katzenbach’s
words, “to corporate a policy
that will provide necessary
guidance for government agencies in their relationship to the
international a c t i V i t i e s of
American educational organize»
tions."
Five weeks later the special
committee delivered its report
to LBJ. It contained a basic
statement oi policy:
No Federal Agency shall provide my cover! ﬁspecial u-

distance or support, direct or
indirect, to any of the Nation‘s
educational or private voluntary organizations. This policy
specifically applies to all foreign activities of such organizations and it platforms prev
ent policy with respect to their
domestic activities.
Just to nail the matter down
the committee added a footnote:
If the Statement of Policy is
to be effective, it must be rigorously informed.
it is clear from the policy
statement that all covers final—
dial aid — from any agency of
the federal government — is to
be promptly ended. Such was
the popular interpretation of
the treatments’ immediately
ordering the policy statement
into effect.
As part of its containment
policy, the CIA drew the foreign versus domestic line: the
Agency only dealt with foreign
matters, of. in the case of the
NSA, with an organization that
was engaged in activity in the
foreign ﬁend. The spy report
ment steadfastly maintained
that it had gotten into domestic affairs.
The truth of the matter, however, is that the CIA, the State
and Defense Departments, and
the nation’s intelligence system has been ultimately and
recently involved in the guidlag and pulse-taking of domestic thought and politics.
The instrument of this com«
prevention program is a littleknown conference center about
40 miles west south west of
Washington, just off US. highway 50, called Airlie House.
The operator of Airiie is Dr.
Murdock Head, a manager-aiiseasons Who holds professional
degrees in chemistry (Louis
villa), medicine (Vermont). and
law (G e o r g e Washington).
Born in Trinity, Texas, about
1923, Head remains a rather
mysterious figure, even though
the Saturday Evening Post,
Newsweek, and other magazines have had feature articles
concerning his work at Airlie.
According to an Airlie brochure, the center is run by Air«
lie Foundation, a non-profit
Virginia corporation. Airlie’s
source oi funds, however, is to
say the least religious In its
June 23, 1562 article. the Saturday Evening Post referred to
Airlie as “a $2,000,000 set-up
finances by Head and private
contractors.”
In Newsweek of March 16,
1964, is the Comment: “Head
launched Airlie House seven
years ago with a small person<
al inheritance and bluntless enIhusiasm. following additional
money from insurance companies and banks. he essay»
listed the non-profit Airlie
Foundation, now Worth $2 to $3
million.”
in an interview with Head in
the Sunday Magazine section
of the Washington Star of Aug»
use 11, 1963, reference is made
PART ONE
to the wealth of Heads wife’s
parents from Louisville, Ky,
together with extensive borrowings drum banks and insurance
Companies.
Airlie is situated in the beautiful rolling hunt. country of
northern Virginia. The gambling conference center operators a scenic pond and is only
part or a remarkable complete
complex of private clinic, radio station, cattle barn, sound
baths, game lodge, enables,
swimming pool, guest houses,
and private airport.
In essence, Airlie House is
an ideal conference center. As
the brochure truthfully states:

Airlie is a frequent location

5&3 staff Writer
Mike Schafier, an interests
log sophomore, has brought a
new sound to the Grinnell campus. No, he’s not the organizer
of a band, but of a hockey club.
The sound is of a shop shot responding off the boards of career Plaza Ice Arena.
The sign on the side of the
link cards: “No games of ally
kind", but Mike has Changed
that. He has made arrangements
for the hockey club to practice,
bought equipment, scheduled
, games, secured funds and is
teaching people to play hockey.
There are now twenty-two
, members who practice two
nights a week.
They played three games last
- semester and have played again
this semester. s.
Last year Mike and Steve
Gausebeck got the idea of getting some interested students
together a couple of times a
week to play hockey. They se-
cited permission from Miss
King to use the link two nights
a week from 10 to 12 pink, and
Sunday morning.
At that time there were about
eight or ten people who played.
The only problem they encountered was that B&G men
kept licking them Off the link,
explaining they had not heard
anything about hockey being
permitted.
This year about twice as many
people have been playing.
At an organizational meeting
the group decided to join the
US. Amateur Hockey Association as the Grinnell Blades.
The meeting also elected
Schsfier captain - coach.
When Schaiier told President
suggest about the club's plans
to play teams from other schools,
suggest was so enthusiastic he
volunteered free use of the college wagons and box watches
for team trips.
Schafier then went to local
merchants to secure money.

The American economy is, perhaps. the only economy in the
World which has informed Itself the luxury of flooring its chess
market with “indescribably bad" chess literature. As is the case
with Contract Bridge literature, publishers are content to saturday
bookstores with garbage. satisfied with the knowledge that according to recent sales trends the public opposite is up, and certified
by the Conviction that their actions are good for the GNP. In adds«
tion to the twothirds of the world population that goes to sleep
hungry every night may be added the chess playing public.
It is a sad but often true fact that the beginning chess player
must attack a certain preliminary in the game before he is able to
disciplinary between the wealth of refuse until for human Consumption and the few genuine works written for the serious player
by masters with legitimate conventions. In response to this proc
let, Zugzwang papers the following bibliography for the expert as
well as the uninitiated. the beginner as well as the casual player.
The best beginning books have been written by the occupational grandmasters: master’s manual of Chess, by channel master,

Reuben Fine’s The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings and Prootloal Chess Openings rank under the compendium, month Edition

Insight into the brilliant chess‘minds or the past century may
be gained by an investigation of Znosko—Borovsky’s The Art of
