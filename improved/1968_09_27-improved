from buying enough books to
really save money. unfortunately there is little hope of
doing anything to reduce the
price of books. The moreover is
just not large enough to sell
books at discount prices.
The prices of cosmetics and
drugs are set by the wholesale
supplier. According to zambia,
prices are deliberately high.
The reason is to avoid any
competition with Grinnell her<
charts. Even if this policy were
abandoned, the volume of drugs
and cosmetics sold is too small
to allow the store to purchase
sufficient quantities which
would be necessary to reduce
prices.
Those sticky price tags can
be removed. Wassom said that
a sublime will do the trick. I!
you are pussy you will have to
make your books, The sticky
tags prevent price switching in
the store and they are convenient for the alerts during
the book rush at the beginning
of each semester.
The most important function
of the bookstore is to supply
students with the appropriate
texts. This function is not always luliilled. As a result many
students are without texts for
as long as three weeks. This is
inexcusable. Enough b o o k 3
should be ordered in advance.
Wassom argued that “It’s
hard to guess exactly how
many books will be needed."
He does not have to guess. Free
registration lists indicate approximately how many students
will be taking each course.
Wassom uses this list when he
orders books. However, many
more students sign up {or a
course than is indicated through
pro-registration. Surplus books
can be sent back. More than
enough books should be ordered
to ensure that every student
will have one. some publishers
have statement regulations re
warning the return of books and
not all books can be returned.
in these subsequent cases, the
college should absorb the loss
(which should not be too great).
Wassom contents that there
is not enough room to allow ordering more books than ap<
years necessary. He added that
lack or adequate space is the
most serious problem concern<
ing the bookstore. Not enough
books can be displayed and the
volumes on the shelter are
created together. This makes
finding a particular title very
difficult. The shelter are also
too close together, making it
almost impossible for two
people to look in the same sec<
tion at the same time. IT wassum is concerned about this
problem, I think a solution
could be found.
Last year the Library Committee was presented with a
mandate from the faculty to investigate the problem of space
in the bookstore. The back or
the store is now used {or storage. This could he transfer-med
into a display area if another
location were found to serve as
a storage space. While the faculty committee did not have
sufficient time to investigate all
the possibilities (the mandate
is still before the committee),
some suggestions were proposed. The college building
downtown is equipped with a
service operator. P e r h a p s
available room there could be
used for storage space. Another
suggestion was to use a small
section of the service building
for storage. Wassom, however,
was reported to be “complete
ly involving to indicate.”
Another possibility would be
to convert the women’s gym
Into a bookstore. Lamhie said
that he was in favor of such a
suggestion, although other uses
for the building have also been
proposed.
if more space were used,
many of the serious problems
could be solved. Enough room
would then be available to stock
a equipment number of textbooks. Also, perhaps a greater
number of books (other than
texts) could be purchased at
one time. This would result in
lower prices. l-hopefully the Li-

In Controversial Court Case

The case of the United States

subject to such taxation.
The test case goes Io court
In November. Mr. D0 II I 1 l1

“It used to be thought that

Other evidence of this new

there was a provision to tax
the travel of those doing business for nonprofit institutions
which had formerly been exempt learn such taxation. Mr.
zambia said the passage of

KDlC, Grinnell's own radio
station, has begun broadcasting
alter two years of preparation,
The idea {or the station ﬁrss
began two years ago when Babak Armajeni, '68, organized
the first board of the radio station, It convicted of A station
manager, a personnel director,
all audio purchasing agent, a
news director, a program director. a chief engineer, a publicity director, and a secretary.
Because Grinnell’s previous
nation (started in 1948) had
gotten in trouble with the FCC
and had consequently lost its
license, the new station had difficulty in getting its new license. After this obstacle was
overcome, the broadcasting was
further closed when the area
housing the station was not
completed, Limited broadcasting did eventually take place
last spring during graduation
week.
Financing for 1(ch comes
from SSA funds. Most oi the
equipment in the station itself

The Newberry Library Seminar in the Humanities is an

The semester is typically divided into tWO periods. The first
six weeks Consists of seminar
sessions in English and History
which the students prepare and
lead themselves. The remaining
two months are devoted to independent and comprehensive
research. Students may choose
any area or study containing to

Their final academic responsibility is the completion or a paper based upon their research.
These papers are corrected and
published by the Newoerry Library every year. The program

The Wallace Ad
During this past week a debate arise on the
very integrate issue of advertising ethics The debate
was centered on whether or not to publish an advertisement for George Wallace which we received
from the National Educational Advertising Service.
There were some who thought that such a publication would constitute an endorsement of the candidate, in the same way as when an ad appears in
the Good Housekeeping Magazine, an endorsement
of the advertiser product is understood Some argued that publication of the ad might aid the campaign of Wallace, and since we ought to do nothing
to help him, we should not publish it. Some also
thought that the ads appearance in the S&B would
offers a large number of our readers.
If an advertisement for simon or Humphrey had
arrived first, there probably would have been no
difficulty, for these men, while not model candidates, do not star such deep feelings of sacred as
Wallace. We thought that if one of these ads had
arrived we would have published it, Not to publish
the Wallace ad would have been a kind of political
membership. Not having published the ad would set
a dangerous president for a free newspaper — that
only those whose views are compatible with those
of the editorial staff he represented in the paper in
advertising copy.
The notion that the publication of an advertisement for a candidate constitutes an endorsement is
assure. Never would this paper enlarge a man who
threatens to run over demonstration. A newspaper
published political advertisements because these ads
are a part of the forum on which ideas of the candidates are expressed. The publication of such an ad
is not an endorsement, but is a recognition of the
man’s existence as a candidate.
if we were to run the ad, Wallace might well include Grinnell College in a list of “liberal" colleges where his ad appeared, and this might help
his campaign. Or it might hurt it. Yet if we were to
refuse to run his ad, he might include Grinnell in
a list of colleges who refused to run his ad, and this
also might either aid or hurt his campaign, It is also
undertake whether the ad itself will be of any help
to him.
We worked strenuously this week to silicon advertisements from the other major candidates so
that we would not offers the possibilities of a large
group by publishing the Wallace ad alone. We respect those possibilities Henceforth, however, it
will be the policy of this newspaper to publish political ads.
“It’s not a bargain if you don’t need it"
A new gym has been on the priority list of needed conversations ever since the old women's gym
turned down in the late 1930’s. party symposium
was originally built to be a temporary structure, to
tide the college over the war years when a new gym
would be built, The Fine Arts Building, the library,
the Forum and the two service buildings all displayed the gym on the list of priorities
According to President suggest, the innovation
of buildings is not an activity which must again the
completion of new structures. In an interview he in<
located that cleaner and ARH are on the agenda to
be generated this coming summer.
Nevertheless, the planned gym is an excess, It
would fill the needs of a college twice Grinnell’s
size. Only if the college were planning a great in‘
create in the enrollment would the new gym be certified, But the college plans no such increase, and
widely, for a large increase in the number of students would significantly change the euros of the
school.
Could not the college settle for something
humbler? Is the gym a result of pressure from
trustees who see the size of a college’s gym as being directly professional to that institution’s worth,
just as in the futures one’s status is measured by
the size of his swimming pool?
To save some money the college is not going to
put bleachers in the new gym immediately, so party will continue to be used for variety sports. Would
it not be less extravagant to convert party into a
women‘s gym and build a new gym for the men
smaller than the planned complex?
Even if there be good reason for the new gym,
there is no sense in its size.
Corrections

on the election or" Lee april. There was confusion
between the SGA office and the S&B office, probably because of their providing. Anyway, the correct figures follow:

Grinnell's Image: The Catalogue
Among the many useful and
entertaining publications oi
oi Grinnell College—the Student Handbook, the annual
class schedule, the Slim—the
most important and represem
native, at least in design and
scope, is the college catalogue.
The 1968-9 edition contains
both the words ”catalog" (sic)
and "bulletin,” Were we to
speak strictly -- a thing infectious by the college’s own
standard at “interventions
banners“ (p. ll)—wa should
call the publication neither I
catalogue nor a bulletin, for it
contains much more than a
listing 01 items and it has no
such function as a paper bull.
To justify the two titles, however one might support "catalog" by pointing to the list
of the courses offered—still the
largest section of the book—
on pp. 99—160 and their support
"bulletin” by receiving the
extensive use made of the new
started seal, recruitment or the
president’s metallica.
Catalogues do not, by definition, other qualifications of
their existence; at college catalogue always offers such certification ~ and in categories put out by such schools
as forward College, for example, the entire catalogue is devoted to certification, since no
courses are offered, in good
philosophical f a s h l o n, the
Grinnell college catalogue begins with “The Objectives of
the College" (1). 11). The cds
using sentence, despite its illiterate use of "than," is worth
hunting:
"Grilmell College exists to
help shape the character and
quality of each or its students,

he might have been had it not
been for his years in the community of Grinnell colleges”
There is a certain wellness—
worthy of a commercial advertisement—in opening and
closing the sentence with the
words “Grinnell College”, One
might wish for some mention
of the mind, but the reverse
hendiadys “character and
quality” allows the reader to
assume its presence. Less happy is the phrase “a different
and better human being”;;
myself, l object to the assume
tion that difference necessarily implies wilderness. Despite
the general gaucheness of our
students, the culture of Amer.
lcd, its “character and quality", seem to me something to
be built on and developed rather than something to be made
different.
The means used by the college in achieving this aim is
described as "creating and
maintaining a likely environment of construction tradition
and interventions m a n n e r s."
Grinnell may have shed its
normal ties with Christianity
but its Christian heritage or
being all things to all men
shows forth bright and clear
in this sentence, which is more
sophisticated than the sort of
prove which used to grace the
catalogue oi persons College
but which is not especially
different. Given that general
statement of means, Grinnell,
too, ought to have a “tradition
committee".
All this, however, is proc-
able no more than the usual
awkwardness we all feel in
speaking normally. By the end
of the first paragraph we are
reading prove which demands
us that Grinnell, for all its
shortcomings, is a place worth
knowing:
"Above all, the college tries to
expensive the force of ideals,
the relationship between private and public responsibility,
the saving qualities of art and
daughter, and the sense that
knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come from an n.wireless of others and not
just one/s sell.”
validity of change—a characteristic of Grinnell that often
sellers from the defects of its
qualities — has always made
putting out a catalogue at
Grinnell a tricks job. in the
past, when the catalogue came
out almost as late as the textbook, it described what the
College had done rather than
what it was going to do; hence,
when it was accurate, it was
out of date. This year, with
incredible energy, the administration has published the catalogue at the beginning of the
year; as a result, though it is
up to date, it is not always
accurate. l omit such cavils as
the encryption oi professor
Kleinschrnidt to the German
Department, for such errors
are one of the ills that mind
is hair to: somewhat more de
pressing, however, is the de
scripting oi the Humanities
course (p. 23) as containing
"masterpieces of. . .history”.
When the old and ill-rated
“Historical Studies” course
was metamorphosed into “Social Studies", the Humanities
staff dropped its one historical
work—Thucydides—on the assumption that it was to be
picked up by the new course
in social studies. Alas, Thucydides disappeared into the pro
special limits ot the Department
or History oi Classical Languages to be replaced by investigations into the life of Trobruk calendars and other Cultures “presenting western man
in successful periods of his history.”
Even though the College has
cancelled its error in judgment—that Grinnell freshmen
are too good to need orthodox
courses in freshman composition — by adding a “Writing
Lab,” it takes no more than a
casual reading or upperclass
papers to see that the “rigorous training in the writing of
the English language", mentioned on p. 24, is a virus hope
rather than a legitimate
claim.
in a section entitled “Perspective on Liberal Education” (1:. 30), the catalogue is
initially frank in stating that

, SELECTIVE SERVICE: WAYS AND MEANS
By DON HECKER
(Author‘s Note: I wish in express my institute to Wendy
nation for her help in the pro.
vacation 0f till! article. Without
her aid, this article would not
have been possible.)
The Selective Service System
’(55) of the United States is
one of the most peculiar institutions ever to occur in a free
society. The debate over the
mobility of construction aside,
the Selective Service System
itself cannon be said to encourage freedom of action
In fact, the stated aim oi the
system is to “channel” (source)
men into activities that are in
“the national interest" (according to the opinion of the
SS, not necessarily according
to your own).
Perhaps it is because most
systems of formation degenerate into small<scale director<
ships that Americans have traditionally reserved efforts to be
granted into wars.
This is a particularly interesting point to those of us who
have grown up in the shadow
of the Selective Service, for we
have tender to classics it in
the “fact of life" category.
Yet in the 200 years of U5.
history, draft calls have been in
effect fewer than do years, and
the longest draft by far has
been the one that is operating
presently.
Resistance
The recent outbreak of draft
card earnings, mass replies,
and general resistance is probably one of the least exclusive
American reactions to a draft.
The first United States draft,
in 1863, was met by listing so
severe that federal troops had
to be dispatched from petersburg to bring New York City
back under the control of the
oil/il authorities.
The second draft, during
World War I, was responsible
for an action of protest known
as the “starting Ear selection," which was somewhat less
dramatic than its name implies,
but which does indicate the
depth of antagonistic feeling
toward construction.
The important point of these
historical notes is that it is
traditional for Americans to despite construction. and for
them to resist it in every
partner, Including violence.
The deep-stated nutrition of
construction has proven, at
least in the case of the present
draft, to he well-founded.
counseling Manpower
According to the U.S. Constitution, Congress is given the
right to “raise armies.” The
Selective SerVice System, unauthorized under the Military
Selective Service Act oI 1967, is
the agent through which Con
press raises these armies.
However, the Selective SerV<
ice System, without any specii<
ic or general authorization, has
quickly expanded its activities
to include the basic philosophy
of creating men into certain oc—
citations which it has dECldEd
are desirable,
The term that the 35 system
uses to describe this activity is
“counseling manpower,"
In the System's own words,
“manpower counseling" is “the
process of counseling by not
making men from certain activities who are otherwise liable
for service, or by giving determines to qualified men in certain occupations, is actual pros
comment hy investment of
manpower for civilian activities which are manchester ln till
national interest."
The effect of this, again in
the system's own words, is that:
“In the less panasonic and
more spanish individual (that
may easily be read as anyone
who disorders with the policy
of construction — and they may
mean you) it engineers a sense
of fear, uncertainty and dissatisiactlon which motivated him,
mvenhelass, in the some direction (that Ihc SS wishes hi
to be motivated in).
“He would wpmiale ti certain future with no prospect of
military service or civilian m
tributloll, but he computer."
The SS system is also added
in making these rather sweet
ing value documents as to
what is good and bad for the
country and its individual city‘
lens by certain boards that
deal with specific areas, In
iowa, for example, a scientific
advisory board suggests to the
State Selective Service which
industrial occupations are es
central.
Theory and background is
useful to 18-35 year-odds only in
helping them to better understand the general direction of
the SS system. The operational
facts are more important.
The present Selective Service
System was authorized by Congress in 1951 — only two years
alter the World War II draft
was revealed,
Technically, the base of power ol the SS is the 3-5 men who
make up each local board.
These men are appointed by the
President, on the recommends<
tion of the State Director at
Selective Service, Each Local
Board serves approximately a
one-county area. Three board
members are required for a
,quorum, and many boards have
only a total of three members,
Actually, the power of the local board besides not so much
with those as men, who are
unpaid volunteers, as it does
with the‘ Executive secretariat
of the Boards.
These persons, salaries pro
isssionals, and generally women (badly, often middle-aged
and unmarried) handle the dayto»day paperback of the SS,
They are required to sit in on
the bi-monthly meetings (week
inns are held more often, if it
is necessary to process the restaurants) where they “recommend” action to the Board.
These “recommendations" are
then almost continent followed.
An extremely important point
to bear in mind about the politics of the SS is Ihnt the word
“recommendation” carries 00W
generally more weight than the
dictionary‘s definition. “Recommendations" are virtually al.
ways followed, and the likelihood that is “recommendation"
will not be followed is about the
same as Gen. Hershey’s attending the philosophy of oortscrip
lion.
In many cases a good impression on the local board's
Executive Secretary is almost
equal to determine, and a bad
impression is equal to an in.
auction notice.
The Local Boards, individually, are one of the few political
entities that direct their own
fate without outside pressure.
Policies are continued impact
because each Local Board
“recommends" informally to
the State Director who should
be chosen to fill any balance,
and the State Director, in turn,
“recommends" to the President who should be appointed.
Membership in either the sets
trans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
or the American region seems
to be the chief prerequisite for
being appointed to ii Local
Board.
APPEALS AGENTS
Each Local Board has a med
lcal advisor, and a Govemmerit Appeals Agent. Both an
unpaid volunteers.
The medical advisor reviews
restaurants‘ files when asked,
and makes “recommendations"
to the Local Board.
The Government Appeal:
Agent, however, is In 0 r a
important. Each registered has the right to ho countries by his Appeals Agent
whenever the registered be<
pieces he has been unfairly
classifieds
The Agent is required to help
the registered prepare a case
for presentation to the Local
Board. He also reforms the restaurant of his rights in the
process of appeal, and continues
to help him with his case until
some conclusion is reached.
unpaid volunteers like the
Appeals Agents are unlikely to
be generous with their time,
and in this case, such poison.
one may favor the registered.
The appeals Agents is required,
not merely to consider the In—
threats ot the registered, but to
consider equally the interests
of the registered and the Local
Board.
The result is obviously not
good for the interests of the
registered. In other words, if
you are considering something
outside the ss laws, don’t tell
the Appeals Agent.
The decisions of the Local
Board can be appeared to State
Boards of Review, which have
the right to overturn local des
options.
restaurants should always
keep in mind this appeals process Beinre taking any action,
and certainly before accepting
as final decisions of a Local
Board, restaurants should contact a qualified Draft Counselor (other than the Appeals
Agent).
There is one today period
during which the registered can
appeal to any higher source
within the system until he
reaches the President,

'OIES ROII. 28-0;
CORNELI. NEX'I
; By REGGIE GRAHAM
' The football team lost to St.
blah last Saturday, 28-0. “They
were just a better ball club,"
according to Coach powers. The
“Oles”, with twenty-two returnIng batteries, were picked to
Win the Midwest Conference
championship by a poll or the
conference coaches. Grinnell
hash’t put up a foo all team to
match the upper division teams
in a couple oi years, and no one
seriously expected this year to
show any difference. The true
goal of this year‘s team is to
have a responsible season, winning at least half. This will be
a difficult task, considering the
two bad seasons we just came
through.
One of our biggest problems
this year will be lock or experience. The sophomores have added some size and potential, as
well as spirit, but just haven't
played any variety football. As
one or them put it, ‘We all real<
ly want to win, but we just don't
know how" John Czerwinski
played a good game as defensive
ﬁnd, as did Bruce collins
‘(whose injury could put him out
for as much as two weeks).
'Another sophomore, Roy Lewis,
looked good except for the fact
that no one was able to make
a hole for him to go through.
POI) cialis did a line job, and Al
Cloud was great (13 tickets».
John russell is coming along,
but the fact that he was away
from football for a year still
parts his game. Don Kraitsik
looked good, matching a few
passes for short yards. Overall,
the team did almost as well as
could be expected against an.
person size and experience.
Tomorrow’s game will be the
real test, and pass defense will
be particularly important. in
the past. Cornell has thrown
70% of in plays. pic Vranek,
probably the quickest man in
our pass defense, should have a
busy day. Another big factor
will be our defensive line, which
must put lots of pressure on the
passed.
Cornell beat us in the last two
years by a total of seven points
(2124, 23-24). The year before
last, they won in the local thirty
seconds, last year, the last quarter. These memories, as well as
the finally between the two
schools, should add some tire to
our desire for victory. A win
would do workers for our team’s
mobile (and the students’), We
must also face the fact that a
win tomorrow could make the
difference between a responsible middle standing and another year at the bottom or the
conference list. The team needs
your support. Go to the game
tomorrow at 1:30. Fat log says
we’re going to win [or super

Though off to a shake start,

control and worked up a so lead

on a penalty kick by contrary

and a goal by Carl printer, who

Cornell fought back after the

the game out of reach.
The Pioneers badﬂed Cornell
