The candidates
A complete committee on our part to any of tile CoIHP
presidential candidates at this stage, we admit, would be
based only on personal preludlces.
Such factors are the only means by which ally person
can which the candidates forestry now because they have
done little (and ha I had little opportunity) to put thai
job philosophy before south campus. They’ll get their
chance to do it personally Sunday in Yolinkcr lounge at
6:30 pm.
But today they were given space in the charles and
Black (page f ‘e) to have their say. Perhaps, if we canyon. feel right iii supporting one candidate completely at
this time, we can anal} e the three platforms.
Steve powell sites a change in the attitude of the
00pr ill tale last two years. le says tale Council members are less ”imposed ” of policy now than ill the past;
that the trend is to\ arts assuming the task of ”providers"
of Well-founded social programs for the calls and painted»
once of “freedom witllill the framework of academic and
il order."
This latter is achieved, he says, by proposal of legislation to the Senate which will ensure such freedom; by provision of information to hall members about operating procedures of the Courts. powell, we assume. would strike to
continue and improve this role of the not’HP as “providers."
car Smith's platform calls for complete compliance with
college and student rules, a point which series argument.
However, his point that rules should be c ' aged merely be
cause they are inconsistent with one’s ability or installation
to sphere to them seems obtained to us. Sunday 5 Youllker
session will dolibtlessly give Smith a chance to explain since
self on this point.
One additional thing stick. on olir draw, that being
his request for a “positive orientation pl'og'l in.” Many a
intel' word has been w still ill this paper by this editor
and past in argument ag inst what others have called a
"positive orientation program.” But perhaps we‘re not being
. Sunday will 1)‘ lee him with the opportunity
to state his case more speed rally.
Tom grant7, presents a platform with more steel in
it than the other two, we think. His indicated determination to‘ see the drinking rule modified seems to be an hour
cst attempt to see a bad situation remedies. The present
rule is hypothetical and, we think. must be published.
grants asks for lllore autonomy ill the hall system.
This we are willing to see tried. It h been oiir experience
that when groups make their owll rules, they are infinite
ly more careful of their own responsibilities as well as their
rights. /
All three men would make capable leaders, we feel. They
all have indicated executive potential ill positions of leadership on campus. We think the question which should now
decide our votes is what they would do with their abilities.
Perhaps this will be indicated more clear y Sunday.

panama reviews SGA's year
by Bill Halamn
(1961 SGA President)
The leaders of student government have endangered in the
past year to provide the unllyr
aug concept of “awareness" for
the work of the\SGA It was
our wish that from this concept
individual issues would dcrivc
they‘ meaning. Clearly, ii is the
responsibility of the Student
Government Association to provide a wholesale balance be
green concern for campus issues
and an informed, intelligent
concern for national and international issues, and further, to
foster awareness in both areas,
Campus affairs
The primary task facing inc
SGA officers last spring was the
aciualimtion of the new consideration and its satisfactory iniplelncntation In so doing, a sub
starting amount of time was den
voted to the budget and to the
handbook.
An increased activity fee al—
lower for more comprehensive
social programming and place

344,000. Not only was the bridges. unified for the first time,
but put on a program basis, it
allows us to think in terms
of its actual effects. To improve season and lo provide
for more efficient execution

Also. the three textbooks
were combined info one. Unfortuilately, an coordinate amount Di
marriage made the handbook
longer and less movement than
it should have been. Presently.
the constitution is being somewhat showtimes and house rules

Judicial and social byrlaws

more precisely the powers proc
centres, and responsibilities or

To facilitate the \work of the
Senate a special committee,
which concerns itself with budgets, nominations and contributions, was established.

program will attract outstanding high school students to arm.

fully. For this is a right interest
in the structure of ii democratic
society.
Considerable attention was
given to the HouserUn-Amcl‘v
icon Activities Committee and
to the question of civil libraries 'in general. Both “opera-.
lion evolution" and “Operation
Correction" were shown on
campus and in debate was held
between button Lewis III and
Michael washington. All of
these were presented in con—
junction Wilh the Program in
Practical Political Education.
Such programs in conjunction
with other campus organizations ought to continue and to
be expanded if possible.
Grinnell reaffiliated with the
National Student Association this
year and through the work of a
senate committee, we were able
to maintain close Contact with
the national office.
In addition, the IowarNebi‘as»
ka region of the National Stildent Association is regarding
on a program designed to study
and to deal with Iowa‘s social
and economic problems. We will
work on the problem of warrant
laborers within the overall PI'OV
grain. However, due mainly to
poor leadership, the region is
still rather document. Since our
primary Contact with NSA is on
the regional level, Grinnell
might Well device significant
ciforf to providing dynamic
leadership in the region and
hence to becoming a real force
within NSA.
International affairs
The Senate Committee on international affairs has assumed
control of the campus fox"
gen-
student program and of cm
Forclgii Student Leadership
Project within NSA. The SGA
has donated full scholarship
for a foreign student this year,
has provided personal expense
money for two others, and h
provided lodging and employ—
built for them during vacation
periods. Also, the debt which
the SGA has inherited from past
foreign student programs will
be liquidated by the end of the
year.
Finally, this committee is developing a summer program for
American students travelling
abroad.
Personal observations: ,
The position of SGA president
is both a challenging and a regarding aiic. At times it be
comes difficuh on an active
campus such as both to film
persons Willing to assist in the
implementation of worthwhile
programs and projects.
Nevertheless, the president
must have a realistic grip on
every sites’ ii and must attempt, sometimes ngiiirisf great
odds, to implement programs
which are potentially mean<
painful. At all times, one must
keep his goals in mind and
must pursue them with a re—
lentless passion.
In order to lighter the burden
on major campus officers, more
office help is necessary. A maritime non-student secretary is
solely needed, as is a full—time
(and preference trained) extra‘
curriculum activities: counseling
This person should be made
available to all persons in still
sent government, to. club-press»
cents, etc.
Unresolved implies
There are a magnitude of these
and 1 could not begin to article
late all of them in a brief sum»
mary of this nature. Particularly outstanding however, is the
matter of achieving proper coordination among the various
branches of government .
The lack of such coordina»
tion can burden officers unnecessarily and can make leadership positions unavailable to
potential office-seekers. We
must constantly remember
that student government governor not .1 nation but 1100
students and it is these 1100
students whom we serve.
As mentioned above, our re
internship with NSA on the regional level must be improved
and the leadership position them
strengthened. Finally. a solid
tion to the book sterling iron
blem in the library must he
found.
1 would like to take this apr
community to wish the in-coming
officers or the SGA, and garlic

by Tom gravity
My platform includes:
. Strengthened. portable hall
system.
.increased hall autonomy
. responsible, effective (:0th
leadership.
. Strong, representative, North
campus voice in the Execus
tire Cabinet and Student
Senate.
5. Realistsic modification oi the
drinking rule.
The about urgent necessity on
North campus is to strengthen
and preserve a portable re, —
dance hall system on the
grounds that it is one oi the
most important and beneficial
aspects of Grinnell College tile.
The minor of the Grlnnell Stu—l
sent body is changing. We are
something more intelligent std.
cents and as a general rule the
desire for individuality sc ms to
increase in proportion to intelligence. The trying need on
North campus now is to develop‘
la hall‘ system that will telling'
the needs and devil s ol’ thai
enhancing student body. it is inn»
operating that we do this to pr
'sent a disasterous decline et out“
owii calls into idle directories.
Residence balls on North
campus are made up oi vary
ing kinds ot men with varying ideas and traditions. As
there are many individuals
within each hall. so each hall
is an individual within the
framework or ciriimell student
government,
Because of these differences
between calls, it is sheer holly
to impose specific rules and mg l
stations which apply to all oi‘
.North campus regardless ot the
desired of the men in
dividend calls,
Therefore, I feel that there
 
should be certain minimum den i
cl‘oil rules to which all Nollhl
campus must sphere cal 1
