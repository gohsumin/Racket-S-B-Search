Senators Cohen and Ward
Speak on Campus Affairs
Following their recent election
to the Senate, Alan Cohen and
romania Ward were interpreted
by the 5&3 to determine why
they ran. what they thought of
the Senate, and where they
thought the Senate should be
. heading,
Alan Cohen: ”I originally ran
because I thought the Senate had
been handling only small administrative matters. Students
would ask what the Senate has
done, and the answer would be
nothing, All they had done was
give out money and pass a few
resolutions.
“i want the Senate to address
itself to the things that are
gathering students, I believe that
students are worried about the
academic situation: requirements. the possibility oi optional
grades, relevance of courses, and
so on, Last week three new
Senate committees were formed
anti live more became Senate
committees. They cover such
areas as requirements, ireshman
year, and the directories. The
Senate must act on the recommendations of these committees."
”Another problem is communication between Senators
and calls, Each senator is
responsible to two or three calls.
but they rarely meet with these
calls, Senators should provide
leadership to mobility student
support for issues. They also
shouldsolicilStudentopinions."
”l uni-win! not the Student
Position Paper 7 I’m definitely
in favor of it,” Alan finished his
interview with a marsh blast at
the S&B's anti»Senate editorial
(See last Week’s “Letters to the
Editors" for other Senate opinion
on the editorial).
romania Ward: “Before this
year i heard more about the
Senate than lines about it, Last
year people didn‘t think it was
doing anything or could do
anything. having sat in on the
Student Position Paper. I've
found out that the Senate is the
best place for student opinion to
be heard.”
“I’d like to see the Senate attempt to activity the student
body and keep it informed — like
about the Senate Position Paper.
One of the biggest adults of the
Senate in die past is it lack of
communication with students. If
they don’t know what‘s going on.
they can’t be interested! ”
“I'd like to see the entire
student body 7 Senate, Council
of House treatments, Association
of Women Students 7 work on
developing this fine report we’re
supposed to have with the
faculty.”
“1 support the Student Position
Paper. but there’s a lot oi faculty
opposition to it. it's an idealistic
paper. To get what we want, we
have to spend a lot of time to
fill positions accurately.”
“I think the drug issue 7 the
school's policy on drugs 7 is one
of the most important issues on
tail"i)\l$
College, for which he expressed
great direction, respect and
royalty. He also expressed his
friendship with, and well wishes
and respect for, the College
administration and all the
members oi his Department.
“Tile College has been good to
us. especially in the friendships
we have established. and we will
never target it or them." Mrs.
timothy karma was formerly
Chairman of the Women's
Physical Education Department.
Acting Dean of Women one year,

E. C. Smith discussed the history of the Black another Party,

We note the appearance of High and Mighty with
a certain amount of activation. It is no easy matter
to produce a newspaper», especially when you are forced
to begin at the beginning. We hope that you choose
to continue what must he a difficult effort.
Clearly, there is room for more than one newspaper
on this campus. We are pleased that you have chosen
a territory which is, by nature, out of our range. The
establishment press, as you might call us, has certain
local responsibilities. And, in our more buoyant moments, we feel that the students at Grinnell deserve
something in addition to our much designed editorial
conservation.
We hear that you have requested a loan (or is it a
gift?) from the Senate. It would be sad if you chose
to give up a completely independent publication and
placed yourself in a precarious legal position, in exchange for a little security. If you did get money from
the Senate, would you be willing to aside by the regulations of the Student Publications Committee? The
58:13 cannon be independent for technical reasons, which
you, no doubt, understand.
It is obvious to everyone that, to say the least, our
political and editorial principles are very far from
yours. But inn’t there some common ground between
us? You have apparently decided, unlike the editors
of Pterodactyl, that there are more important things
to do than to shock people or to make them change.
Are we wrong in this assumption?
We have no solutions about a consultation or coalition
between us. That would only serve to compromise your
principles as well as ours. We think, though, that it
is possible for us to treat each other with respect, and,
recognition that we are flexible men, still to act ‘generally and recently. For the present, we fight with words.
It may be the case, however, that, according to t!“
logic of human associations, rational discounts will
give way to impassioned historic which will lead to
peaceful action, We fear the day when we shall face
each other, fighting for opposite principle, with weapons
more deadly than words. Until that day comes, write
on, proﬂaers.

To the Editor:
In what is rapidly becoming a
tradition, I find it necessary to
correct some stated “fact”, instructions, and innuendos in last
week’s 5&3.
The “tradition” to which I am
referring is that of correction the
numerous mistakes, half-trucks,
and outright misconceptions contained in this semester's 5&3, It
seems the “Letters to the Editor”
columns have had to fulfill this
function, and not a week passes
without the previous week’s 5&3
being substantially corrected.
I quote a letter to the editor
in lastweek's issue:
"‘We'd like to begin by re
marking about the general‘ responsibility of the editorial policy
of the 8&8 Since it has changed
hands. Your first editorial was
written without [actual knowledge oi the position paper and
the progress the steering com
little had made in negotiation
with the faculty. As far as we
are able to ascertain, neither of
the editors has ever attended a
women's generation meeting as
was demonstrated by the lack oi
insight in your second editorial.
Your third editorial .7 and here
again we have never noticed your
faces at a senate meeting —— is
also a credit to your irresponsible
journalism. To put it country, you
don't know what you're talking
about."
The writer of your fourth
editorial had even less idea of
what he was talking about. The
editorial states, “Bruce listen
has said that he and his friends
are ‘working for a society that’s
above freedom 01 speech.’ “ This
statement is an outright lie I
have never made that statement;
I’m not even sure what it could
mean, and I certainly am not its
author Messrs, button and
person are to be changed for their
s|rcnuous efforts to check with
either me or l-henry Wilhelm
about the velocity of this socalled “quote.” Even Henry (who
apparently thought the ”quote"
up), admitted that it wash’t a
genuine quote. However, he felt -
it cimveyed the intention or the
spirit oi my position, so it appeared on his Plerodactyl with»
drawal. I watched when I Saw
the “quotes" attributes to me in
Henry and Krys' statement;
Henry and Krys have good
implications, and most people
read a islamic as just that: a
islamic. However, when this
“quote" becomes unified through
repeated exposure in the EM}
when this “quote" becomes the
basis for a (second) personal attack upon me, the matter is less
laughable.
The editorial proceeds, “Presumably after Mr. listen’s rev action . . ,the culture and politics
of the majority will be used to
determine what other changes
must be made in me Bill of
Rights Perhaps his society will
be above other freedoms.” It
concluded by voting that my
friends and I are” , . beautifully
indistinguishable from their
brothers on the extreme right."
The reference clearly is that I
enlarge a facing mode of government and politics.
Notice that all of these potentially fabulous statements rest on
a misquote. This failure to check
the accuracy of your “facts” is
extreme negligence by almost
any standards oi journalistic
integrity,
The politics of this issue is not
the central point, “Collective vs,
individual rights" is a tough
political question, and I would be
happy to discuss my views on
the subject with anyone. I have
a feeling i am a stronger believed
in individual rights than either
editor of the SEA}. However, it
is largely irrelevant to the most
important point to be made here.
The main issue is that of editorial
and journalistic responsibility.
This computers’ 5&5, since it
dress’t bother to check its
“facts,”taresbadlyon this issue.
Perhaps it will require improvement proceedings against
the editors or a label suit against
the 5&8 and the College to reverse this semester's trend
to journalistic irresponsibility.

listen’s letter by making an

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Port 2
The Problem of Definition is Raised
A definition of a liberal
education is our next concern.
Let us examine the essential
points of the goals or definitions
of such an education as given by
five well-known colleges:
Amherst: A broad education,
knowledge of some field in depth,
intellectual conference, and
awareness of problems and
methods.
Carleton: Excellence of in
tellectual training, breasts of"
to require these; and as for the
development of character, in
eluded in the liberal education
by most colleges, very little is
done about it as a requirement.
Again, requirements change
from time to time, most Of them
with respect to detail, but some
of them more beautifully.
The difficulties may result
from (a) the fact that the subject
of education is so complex that
t is automatically and beautifully
understanding, personal and? nadvisable to frame a single
social responsibility, com- '
comment to goals which extend
beyond the sell.
Oberlin: Academic excellence,
Search for truth, a sense of social
responsibility, moral integrity,
social justice, service to others.
Williams: Development of
those qualities of the mind and
of character which encourage
creative, independent, and
responsible thought, and a taste
ufintellectual adventure.
Grinnell: Aims (a) to help
shape the character of the
student and make him a better
human being so he can achieve
a personally satisfying and
worthwhile life, (b) to guide him
toward intelligent and responsible citizenship, and (c) to
prepare him for a useful career.
above colleges
process to have as their aim a
liberal education, but we find
variation in emphasis from one
definition to another; and
although there is something
which is common in the above
definitions, there are differences
also. So since me various
definitions given cannon be
refused (except on logical
grounds), their diversity may
result from something else,
namely, to the differences in
what is considered to be a good
education for a student.
Moreover, what the definitions
say is one thing, what the colleges
require is another. For example,
nothing is mentioned in the aims
about physical education, very
little about the appreciation or
fine arts, and only two of them
include preparation for a career;
yet all the above colleges seem

definition. or from (b) nuclear
thinking; and if (a) is the case.
then the expression “liberal
education" had better be left
religious or undefined. 0n the
other hand, terms should be clear
and have defining meetings;
otherwise communication
becomes difficult, What is more.
it is the processed function of
college educators to enable
students to think clearly and
definitely; and if students cannon
find clarity and definiteness in
the definition of a liberal
education, which is the first
principle and serves as a guide
to their various educational
activities, where else would they
find it?
So there are arguments in
favor of and arguments against
a single definition, Specifically,
the following arguments seem to
show that a single definition is
not available.
l. Students go to colleges for
different reasons, some to
become engineers, others
lawyers, other banners, others
teachers and so on. So why have
a single begin' ion of a liberal
education for all?
2, The material, intellectual.
and spiritual strength and
richards of a nation depend on
individuals With a variety of
goals. The same education would
encourage university and even
mediocrity; and such an
education is the mark of a doctor
worship rather than of a demo
race.
3. Those affected by a liberal
education are the students, and
it is they (or their parents) who
pay the bill; so it is they who
should decide what to learn. If
their aims and desired differ, so
should their education,
4. The so~called “require
meets" for a liberal education
are determined by a majority
vote in faculty meetings, and the
changes in those requirements
are result from changing faculty
pennem

groups and changing special
interests and not to any objective
standards. So the student is customized by power strengths and
campus politics among the
faculty, and his educational
needs are not determined by an
objective standard. It so, there
should be no requirements, but
freedom of choice.
5 Usually, each professor is a
specialist in one field and has no
integrated knowledge of all the
fields. So even if we assume that
there is such a thing as a single
education which would be the
best thing for all, still no man
exists who knows enough to reveal it to us. In the absence of
such a man, then, it would be
better to leave the decision up
to the student.
6, Most of the colleges include
under one of their two principal
aims the development of character, moral integrity, and social
responsibility, or the like. But
what mobility should be, drivers
from religion to religion, from
nation to nation, from individual
to individual; and to force upon
students a single mobility goes
contrary to their religion or their
conference. So it appears that it
is not the colleges' business to
teach mobility. The student
should be left free to follow the
pictures of his conference.
7. Man is a changing being, and
as his knowledge changes and increases, so do his goals. To
demand a single definition is to
stop progress and the quest for
higher aims and values.
over arguments besides the
above may be added, but these
are sufficient for our needs. We
may now turn to the corresponding arguments in favor of
a single definition,
1. A liberal education Should
not be like a chameleon,
changing colors from place to
place, from time to time, from
person to person. It it is some»
thing to be priced, it must stand
for something defining; otherwise
it has no claim to supervision over
any other kind of learning, such
as one gets in a trade school.
Such education is general in
nature, not specific; and its
nature does not conﬂict with the
specific goals; on the contrary,
it adds Something beyond those
goals
2. Variety has its place, but it
is a bad substitute for excellence.
What makes a dictatorship an
evil is not just university, but
had university. A good education
for two students is better than
a good education for one of them
and a had education for the other,
if art has principles and does not

Grinnell student is entitled to
something more than that. A letter is not the place to detail the
errors oi Mr. master‘s'harangue:
but I give you my word mat I
am prepared to do so.
Well, an “-ist”, of course.
expenses something that- is categorized as an “risk” m in Mr.
master’s case, i suppose that he
would have to admit to “mechanism." The suffer “-ibm“ devoted
one oi three things: (1) a practice
or action — e.g., plagiarism or

— e,g , terrorism or accomplish;

Angllc gsm, etc. Since one can
private air. word to any one oi
three kinds -’ curious status
merely by adding “ibm”, the
notion of a “body of dogmas' need
not reply very much rational
thought. The highest set of
vocational impulses can be
converted into an ”-ibm" by
anyone with even a low talent
[or pathology. Mr, master’s
phrase”Counterrevolutionary
lnterventionism" as a label for
die foreign policy of popular
America is a fine specific of
the Idiot ease with which
‘-ibm‘s' are generated. The phrase
achieved the paradoxical ends of
being inaccurately consortium
and flattering at the same time:
To concept any post-war ad
registration of the United States
credit for a policy based on
drama is to overestimate
closely the intelligence oi both
Republican and Del organic
leaders. Europeans are always
getting into trouble by thinking
(a) that political leaders in the
United States think the same way
they do: (b) that they think at
all. “Intellectualism” is not an
“-ibm” which Ameii- is either
sphere to or practice very much
The beauty of Mr. master's
peculiar brand of “-ibm” (shall
we call it “Nasserism”7) is that
it exemplifir-s all three destinations oi the suffer “-ibm”
simultaneously It is a practice,
like plagiarism or baptist, and
Mr. master, like a baptist,
proselytizes with overall ser»
genuine evangelism. It is also a
state or condition, like terrorism
or accomplish; and Mr. master,
like the alcoholic, finds himself
under commission to see
everything in terms of his
-‘-isbn.” And it is a body of drama
and submission (hereunto, like
communist and calcium; and
Mr. master. like both soma
artists and Fascists, sees himself as riding the crest of “the
wave of the future,” triumphant»
ly specializing (it i dare use that
very of him) on what is really
a previously selected and self
computing sense of historical
inevitabllty 7 as ii men could
device any sense ot virtue from
being nominated and enclosed by

SCARLET AND BLACK
Well, probably no great harm
has been done, for we may rely
on the native and dense integrity
of the human mind to survive
even the most radical impact and
improve; and there may even be
some good to be derived from
Mr. master. Field trips are now
a regular part of education, and
hence we take the student to see
a slim, a done advice, and inside
asylum. Mr. master’s presence
believes us from the need for
making certain kinds of field
trips; he is to us what C. S, Lewis
was to readers a Paradise Lost
— a living opponent oi a body
of drama so alien that we ought
to feel grateful for having a ”real
live" example at our allow. As
we wonder the ”ibm” which Mr.
master claims to represent and
expense, we ought to keep him
firmly in mind. Nothing is more
military to a teacher man a good
example, even if one “good”
example he oisomething bad.

To The Editors:
With regard to Mr. master's
“The Battle of players"
Anatomy of a Revolution, I find
myself in record with his enthusiasm for the film, but compressed
by his complete acceptance of
Time's paranoid assessment of
the film as a “blueprint for
revolutionists.” “The Battle of
players” is most dramatically
not a blueprint for revolutionists
and most particularly not a blue
print for urban resolutions If
there is a lesson to be learned
from the film it is that revolution
based on even a well organized
terrorist activity operating out of
an urban ghetto can and will be
compressed by established
authority.

and a good education is an art.
like the art of currently and
architecture and engineering,
then it must, like any other art,
have defining principles; and if
so, then it must have a unique
goal and therefore a unique refer
nation.
3, By definition, students are
learners, not teachers, and to
allow them to decide on what
their general education should be
is to assume that they already
know what it is; it is like allowing
a sick man to decide on what
medicine to take or whether he
should be operated on or not.
Such education does not prevent
them from choosing specific
goals; in fact, it often helps them
to better survey the various
alternatives,
4. In general, processors are
competent in special fields, but,
having received a liberal education. which is general in nature,
they have as a group some knowledge oi the advantages of such
education 7 certainly more than
students do. Differences
among them as to what that
education should be exist, but
they agree on most issues. The
lack oi a single definition does
not deny its possible existence;
it merely suggests that we should
make a greater effort to come
close to it.

liberal education which is
common to all Therefore a
liberal education should have a
single definition.
6. The sentence in the last few
decades on the part of colleges
to pay less attention to the
development oi character m
students is partly responsible for
the increase in lack of com»
medication between students and
administration and in campus
disorders, Freedom for one who
knows what the good 15 and
follows it is good; but, for one
who is irresponsible and follows
his edition, it is evil. There exist
such things as proper habits for
all, e.g., responsibility, gender
unity. and respect for others, and
these should be part of a liberal
education for all students,
7. Man’s nature does not
change; he is still rational
(capable of making general
statements, communication,
reasoning, etc.) So as long as he
remains a man, his generic
potentialities remain the same.
if he adds to his knowledge, such
change is one of degree, Now a
liberal education is Concerned
with what is best for him
generically. as a man; so such
education should have a single
definition.
The arguments here given {or
and against a single definition of
a liberal education are statistical
in character, Our next concern
is to indicate some preliminary
principles of education and then
proceed to a definition.

Wyly’s colleague Presents Renaissance Music
service Chapel was once again
filled with sounds of Renaissance
music last Friday evening when
Grinnell's colleague musical
presented its ﬁrss concert at the
semester This Renaissance
concert did not attract the crowd
that David Harris, the lutenist,
did, and [or understandable
reasons: the passes do not love
a dilellante and Grinnell music
organizations are full of them.
I am by no means delivering all
those amateur musicians who
keep the Grlnnell music report
merit in existence and who put
in one helluva lot of hours for
every concert in which they
perform. But i do believe that
there are a number oi things that
could be done to make their
performances appear livelier and
more professional,
The funding principle or the
colleague musical is an admirv
able one. The majority of their
concerts represent experiments
in the reconstruction of 16th or
17th century securities. That is
to say, they attempt to use
combinations of instruments and
voices which most closely resume
bee those that were popular when
the music was written. The
opening and closing works on the
program most visible demonstrate what I am trying to say.
In ”mandate Dominum” by Ciao
diet Merulo the instrumentation
included a soprano tourist, a recorder quarter, a vocal quarter,
one Violin and villa, two prostores, one late, and harpsichord
and cells continue. To the their
teeth-century concert-goes
this seems like an odd congress
state of instruments, and one can
hardly imagine the five locations
being heard at all, Similar instrumentation was used in
Giovanni Gabrieli‘s “Magnificat
anime sea.” However, in this
polyphonic work the locations and
recorder quarter remained up
trout and on opposite sides oi the
stage and the strings and winds
were put further back and
directly in front oi the alter, in
short, the choice and arrange
ment of instruments and voices
is an important part oi reconstruction 16th century securities.

suffered in both the Merulo and
Gabrieliworks.
The concert also included
several Montcvcrdi materials,
These were presented by the six

companies by professor James
Wyly on the harpsichord, Al
though their innovation problems
were somewhat discussing, l
consider a spiritless condition the
greater transcription. Madrigals
can be sun to sing and just as
much run to listen to, yet except
for a few moments, I felt as
though the fingers were training
themselves through the pieces
and not relating enough to give
Monteverdi a chance. At the risk
oi being defendant, I must make
similar comments about the
instrumental groups that played
tour carroll by Frescobaldi.
Pitch. ensemble and style left
much to be desired.
Floyd Slotterback's performance of “Five Songs" by
John holland was definitely the
highlighted the program. Accoms
wanted by Timi Townsend on the
late. Floyd successfully captured
the spirit oi each song. His innovation and tone are consistently
good, and he is to be explained
iorhisstage noise.
Perhaps making comments
about stage presence is going to
make the appear all the more
stuiisshirtcd and bourgeois, but
there is something that really
pictures me about musicians who
do not know how to reach to applause. Too many Grinnellians
shuttle their left and look
anywhere but at the audience.
You would think they were sms

to communicate that to those who
come to listen to you.

New Church Service
By Nada Maniginletti
In an experiment to reverse the
diminishing size of me college
conservation, Reverend Haas
has turned over Sunday worship
service to the Students.
The first “self-service service," last Sunday, replaced the
weekly floral concert with informal, group folk singing. Oh
fine, I thought, Nothing is more
valid than a hip, within, sugarcoated, Christian service, But
when a heated discussion on the
meaning of community replaced
the usual, soporific person, I
began to have second thoughts.
Some people emphasized the
worship of Christ in community,
while others arrested the “good
feeling” at union and upgrades
ship among the conservation.
Still others denied any directory
between the two. With the
problem yet unresolved, the majority of the conservation song
their way up to the alter to take
community. For me, who order

as tar as possible, this com—
motion was a unique religious

As their 5-6 conference record
indicates and last week‘s games
demonstrate, it has been an up
and down season for the
Pioneers. This reporter believes
that it is going to be “up” for
the rest oi the schedule, and
wants to pay tribute to a team
that has broken with the too-longstanding tradition of Grinnell
losing basketball games.
To what do we attribute this
referral of tradition? Coach
switch’s strategy? New, ”pro
emotional" performs? Gatorade
on the bench? None of these is
too likely. The answer is among
the players, and in their newlyiound aggressiveness and confidence in their ability to play
ball with any team in the center

fighting.
