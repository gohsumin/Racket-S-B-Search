Actualizing’ a new, l'al' from perfect constitution is
no easy task. inevitably the bulk ol' the burden fell upon
the providers of Bill balance and Cameron llendersliot.
With the help of tale other Executive Cabinet members
the two managed to get the new nashville running, despite
l‘v‘mechanical confusion and constitutional awareness
Early in the first year smooth operation was at times
inherited by tile open gift between the Student Body
President and the Speaker of the Senate, Over time the
personality and poLicy gap closed and effective cooperation followed.
While leadership helped to fulfill the new covered
.event’s need for constitutional and procedures self-discipline, Halahla provided the equally important demand
for spontaneity and flexibility.
Agreement between the two was strong- regarding the
proper role of student government. Both held that students ought to concern themselves with crucial public issues ol' the day. Not only did this policy contract the
campus with major social issues, but it also unlimited the
sentence of campus government to console itself on
“domestic” trivia.
The new SGA President and Speaker have much to
live up to. Both panama and leadership have demonstrated remarkable political courage. At times each has
taken unpopular stands and faced the consequences. The
lndny hours both gave certified to the fact that each took
his responsibilities seriously. Both have often worked
twenty-five to thirty ho'url a week to accurately meet
their obligations.
It the new leaders assume their responsibilities with
the same degree of commitment as the panama-leadership team and show the same strength of conviction, SGA
should accomplish much iii its second year.

Our Code Too
In July of 1961, a code of ethics of the student press
was recommended by the 10th International Student Press
Conference in Rome. The charles and Black subscriber to
that code which is appointed below:
“This International Student Press Conference, belief—
ing that all student publications throughout the world
should respect the basic principles of human rights and
that they should maintain good quality workmanship and
a. high stands'd of conduct, recommends the following
Code 01' Ethics for governance by student journalists:
Tile student journalist should strike continuously to
be untitled and accurate in his reports and should
equal himself accurately with facts to support his
published statements. He should fully realize his pe social responsibility for everything he sublime for
publication.
The student journalist should reveal his identity as
a represented 'e of the student press bet‘are details
ing’any interview for publication.
The editor should not exclude a student point of
view solely because it is contrary to the editorial
policy,
The editor should apply 'ze in print at the first
available opportunity for all mistakes.
A accident journalist should defend freedom through
the honest collection and publication of news and
facts and through the right of fair comment and
criticism.
A student journalist should respect all conferences
regarding sources of information wild private documents. He should not falling information of focus

Student journalists should be familiar with the laws

“Foreign policy has its expression in the judgment oi facts 7

Terry Parssiiien, the student
senate adopted some agenda
meets to the women’s house
rules (pages 47—52 in the 196162 student handbook). The rule
changes were sponsored by Jill
wellington, relating AWS board
president. As amended, the first
paragraph oi article HI section
A reads as follow,
“The logged and years doors
are locked at 10:30 pm. Sunday through Thursday nights
The lights in the logged will be
blocked ﬁve minutes before it
is locked and a warning bell

two minutes before final closing
hours, which will be determined
by the Main Hall clock, Lack

be considered a legal excuse for
darkness.” The last sentence was
added because it was pointed
out that the time signals are
only a convenience and might
not be exactly on time, or on
rare occasions might be entirely
written.
Article in section A—Z.a. has
been permitted to provide a
change in darkness penalties.
“Main hall entrance will be

entrance after the logged and
Mom doors have been locked

This change was connected
by the representative from
James on the ground that since
the library closes at 11:30 and
women's hours are 12 put, any
