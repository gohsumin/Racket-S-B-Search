A preliminary report on campus civil defense planning was,
Issued this week by McI‘rltt C.‘
Ludwig, vicerpresldenl
“OIYicizIs of the college do not‘
believe a nuclear attack upon
our country is probably, but we
must concept that it is possible,"
Ludwig said i
“Therefore, in funﬁclient ati
they‘accessibility We feel toward
our resident students, the col.‘

for their protection in the event,
this community should be
threatened by heavy interactive
follows.” ,
Emphasizing that detailed
planning is Inc from complete,
Ludwig said :1 Study of the
protective quality or campus ,
buildings has been made, and t
a decision reached to else the I
basement of the Fine Arts
Center as the campus shelter. I
The area is large enough to
accommodate the entire Student body plus essential operating personnel, and the
building Strucun‘e aﬂodds excellent spreading.
“The objective of our plans
is to provide ‘balloon shelter for
resident students and the shelter": essential operating personnel [or a period of up to 14
days," Ludwwig stated. “We are
assuming that non—resident std.
cents and college employees will
take responsibility for proved

The Courlrighl Cartoon:
A Misrepresentation?

i
Tlle cartoon submitted by Paul B. Courtrigllt, wllicll ‘-
appears in the Letters to the Editor column, devel es some
note, and some careful determination. Much as we ﬂpal'ecir
ate Courtrlght's artistic abilities it appears to los to be
something of a misrepresentation. The young loan picks
ed ill the Collrtright cartoon is represented as a very unsavory character. We are not about to deal here with the
problems of consortium or nonconfornlity, which we feel _
to be strictly the business of individuals What is important .
is that the group which went to Washington took every
prevention against just such misinterpretation.
In all effort to show that they were not merely nonconiornlists, campus beats or float have you, haircuts,
suits, wllite shirts, shoe polish and the like were the order »
of the day. The group did not forget for one minute that
they would be viewed as students of Grinnell College, and
that their best purposes would be suited by a conscious attempt to avoid such questions of personal appearance as
Courtright’s cartoon would suggest.
Furthermore, the appearance of the eminem of the Student Peace, Union is not accurate as containing to the group
as a whole. The courtesy were careful to avoid in all pubs
limits releases, and all personal statements, any connection
between the group and national organizations. Many of
the people wllo went to Washington have no alliance with
the Grinnell Students for Peace, except a sympathy for
some of their causes. Such cartoons as the one Courtrigllt
has submitted may be dangerously displaying allen not
qualified by accurate information.

A Fast of Support
It has been most encouraging to see the response to
the Washington trip. Whether for or against the methods
the group is accounting, the response of members of the
faculty, administration, press and the officials in Washington has been police, relevant, and ill almost all cases respective.
Several people, however, have been confused by the
stand the group is taking. The group is not engineering a
protest against the United States Government. The group
is supporting the present presidential resistance to test
nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Their action, we feel,
is a positive one, and a good sign of serious student feeling for the matter.
Nancy Plogel
The'Edgren Resolution
Among the significant topics of conversation spa' d
by the recent flurry of activity over the Senate's “testing
resolution” and the pilgrimage to Washington by 14 of its
more \‘ocalrsupporters is tlli Does the Senate have the
right to pass a resolution which expressed an opinion concerning affairs not relating specifically and solely to this
campus'.7 We think that the Senate, as a group of students,
expression alld representing their own opinions, certainly
has this right. And most students, we feel, would agree.
The majority of current disagreement seems to lie in
whether or not the Senate, as a group charged with the
responsibility of representing the campus in a common
forum, has the right to hand down resolutions relating to
other than campus affairs, resolutions which would and
are naturally taken to be indicating of a majority of cam—
put feeling because they are the product of an elected
senate.
We could not give away the Senate’s right to
make resolutions concerning any affairs, campus or other—
wise, on the composition that the senate does not represent
the feeling of the campus. If it dress’t then the fault lies
with those who elected the “poor representatives,” Representative government would not, as many have argued, be
representative government if it did not involve the trans—
for of decisiolhmaking powers from a majority to an elect—
.ed minority.
However, we would not deny the right of any students
to make clear their stand on any resolution passed by the
Senate; we would not_deny them the right to demand that
their qualification or their collaboration of any resolution
be attached to it.
’ A motion which established a procedure for the exact-
 
. . . A broken record Who the hell dress’t?

Des points Register Speaks
In Favor 0f Washingh’an Trip
(Ed. Note — The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's
getﬁpoints Register under the headline “Grinnellinns Speaking
1) :
Thirteen Grinnell College students are on their way to
the White House where they plan a three~day “sit and fast"
demonstration against assumption of U. S. nuclear testing
in the atmosphere They go with permission (neither approval nor disapproval, they say) of the college administration, and with the implied pressing of the Student modern—
ment Association.
The student senate last week approved by 29 to 17 a
resolution against renewal U. S. testing The “Students
casting for Peace" group got together shortly afternoon.
The president of the Grinnell student government said that
the demonstration will speak for themselves and are not
sponsored by the student organization. However, the student
senate implied its approval by giving the 13 permission to
distribute the Grinnell antictest'ing resolution in Washing
ton, D. C.
During the 1950's touch was written about a supposed
political and philosophical apache among college students.
They were said to have been bored with any cause beyond
$10,000 year and a good pension program. We are glad to
see that the students of Grinnell College, at least, are thinking now about other concerns and are speaking out. If the
“sit and fast” exhibition has some aspects of a happy—go—
lucky student adventure, it also shows a concern with world
affa .
Tile 13 demonstration may be commented for having
the courage of their connections, the student body for considering and taking a stand on a serious national issue.
and the college administration for maintaining a relevant
attitude toward a rather unconventional enterprise. ‘
It is to be hoped, however, that other college students
will raise questions about the wisdom of the U S, not
advertising nuclear weapons tests in the air, so long as the
Soviet Union continues testing and will not agree to international controls to expertise a test ban.
 
event of just such a l get will come before the Senate
next week. Submitted by Gates hall representative John
Edgren, the motion requests that “For any resolution passed by the Grinnell College Student Senate of significance
beyond the college (as one dealing with national or inter»
national affairs) there shall be held a referendumto the
student body on precisely the same question upon receipt
of a petition signed by ten per cent of, the student body or,.
at the direction of the Executive Cabinet. In any publicity
the results of this references shall according the Senate's
resolution."
We think the motion is a good one, and reserves careful consideration.

To the Editor:
VVlth tllc asset or the decade
of the nineteen fifteen, a new
attitude has sweet American
computer This is manchester in
the form of conservative partially. We seem to have cast aside
the traditional role of the disscntcr, whether of the right or
the left. Ecchusc of the relative
lack of l'csponslbilltv of the student to persons and institutions
save himself and his ideals, he
has the opportunity and the obligation to act definitely and
unequivocally upon his beliefs.
Unlike the liberal, who must
constantly review and compromise his ends in attempting to
recognize them with “reality,”
the radical may, and must, act‘
solely on the basis of his ideals,
regardless of their political fe
ability or social repcccussich..
His goals become the ballot
which ehuces and stimulates
society on to new directions and
greater achievements. This is
the rule the student must as—
some.
The students fisting in Washington deserve our highest
praise, not necessarily for the
position they expense, but run
their courageous action. Our criticism should be directed at the
letharglc students who fail either
to support their colleagues, or to
organize a counter-action.
Apathy is totally wrong.

To the Editor:
1 would like to congratulate
Coach powers and the football
team for one ofvtlle best seasons
Grinnell College has ever had.
Many of us don’t realize the
hard work that these coaches
and players do. It takes many
hours oi hard practice total—
below a team such as the one
we had this year. More than
this, it takes a lot of desire on
the part or every individual. All
year, this team showed the results ot this hard work and
great team desire. Time and a.
gain, the last part ot the season, our team came from be»
find to win, And when they
lost, it was not because or lack
ot desire.
We no longer have to make
focuses for our football team
We don't have to say “Well.
We’re an intellectual school. not‘
a football school " Now We can
proudly say that We are both.
Along with being one ot the
most outstanding schools of
learning, we have good athletes
too. At Grinnell there is no
sucks thing as a “dumb football
player," and l think we can all
be proud of this, We combine
_ athletics with studies and come
out ahead in both. This is one
oi the many things that makes
Grinnell the great school it is.
The fact that Coach powers
inherited a team with a very
poor record and in. two years
built a championship team is
next to amazing. And he does
this without athletic scholar
ships!
Let's forget the big bomb and
the world situation {or a minute
and pay tribute to a good foot
ball team and a good coach.
Congratulations, coach and team
and let's get ’em again
next year.

has been the working oi the

Monday, November late. Everyone i think should be against
atmospheric testing it proved
unnecessary and dangerous to
our health. But there was nothmg in the resolution that said
or listed that it could be nice
essays, the application being that
it was automatically dangerous
and unhealthrui The retereir
due in my opinion was already
_sell.led before It was even voted
upon, The even more ridiculous
part oi the resolution asked if
you were in favor oi the U,S.S.R.
continuing its testing. That is
like asking the reviews to be.
have themselves as beginning

I am glad to know that these

the world's problems if given
half a chance to do it their way.

He said the ﬁrss signsﬁcant
increase occurred Nov, 1, several‘
days after the Soviet 50-mega~',
ton nuclear explosion. A reading or 450 micromicrocuries cvs

or 1300 mac’s was taken. l
Asecond substantial increase
was noted after last Monday’s l

Dr. william mailman (physical, advisor for the monitoring
program, made this comment on
the signsﬁdance of the increases:
“The increased radiation Counts
taken here are not significant
in that they forecast no immediate effects which might Cause
biological damage. As to the
objects of increased radioactivity
