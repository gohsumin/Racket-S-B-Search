Earlier in that month, May 2,
1934, Wayne horse, then dean oi
the University of Oregon law
school, addressed Grinnell residents in a speech at service Chap
el. His analysis of the five types
of college students, though heavily linked with the social respondent ol the 30’s, is amazingly applicable to Grinnell students of the
1960’s:
“Five types of students enter
the calls or learning. The first type
includes the student who is just
plain independent. He goes to college without knowing why; his
folks foot the bill. He seldom questions what his processors put forth.
“The constitutional conservative
calls into the second group. he

why should he argue and dream

“Third in the list is the hedonist, unconsciously so, for he
does not know hedonism is s philosophy. He knows “pleasure and
pain” as the leading notices or
life. He seeks the me and avoids
the other. It is he who gives the
administration occasional trouble
and must be'recommended or sent
to another environment.
"The fourth group is the idealist and consider. He is the most
peaceful of college students. He is
the leader of leather and protest
movements. l-le emirates the
cause of freedom and justice.
"And easily, there is the critical
reality. He is the counter and
skeptic, the eternal other ot questions. He has die courage .to disagree, the energy and mental discipline necessary for practical affairs."
 
Kent ensure of ’North Campus problem,’
Asks Whether Hull System Is at Fault
To the Editor:
I find the whole recent debate wondering the hall system discussing. it is discussing because all discussion has been based on
assumptions which have neither been clearly assisted not proved to
be tale.
The assumptions are (I) that there is a “North Campus problem"
and (2) that it is the result of the present hall system.
I cannon say
that there inn’t a “North Campus problem". Nor can I say that if
there is one it inn’t posted in the present hill setup. 1 don’t know and
i don't think anyone else really knows either. therefore, before pro
posing any more solutions to the “North Campus problem" let us ask
first if such a problem actually exists. Then, if we ﬁnd that_lt does,
let us dating it clearly Ind publicly and, while we are at it, let's also
attempt to define just what both usually and automatically we wish our
residence system to accomplish,
Personally I have no particular prices with the
recent hall sys~
tel and think there is much to recommend it. But 1 at is irrelevant.
The residence situation, at best, is only partially related in the real
campus problems of irresponsible
conduct and academic apache on
the part of a significant portion of the student body. imagination suggestions are Certainly in order but let's not conﬁne them to the hall
system which may or may not be ll part ol larger problems.

and PhD. from U.Cr at Berkeley,
spent the summerquatter, 1934,
at Antioch and last year at Bar
kelly.
“I did specifically look (or a
small school,” german said “I
enjoyed the excitement oi the en
cents (at Berkeley) but the things
which alter implied about the university were not so good.
“They (the events) signihed a
large, impersonal university where
students don't see their prices
sort; and students and processors
from different departments don't
have much to say to each other.”
At Grinnell, german pointed out
“people get used to seeing their
processors around. They know they
can see them; whereas Berkeley
is large and most or the processors
discounted student visits. The students recognize this and get into
the cabin of not seeing them.”
Antioch represents a totally did»

“The way Antioch is Structured,
the school encourages the student

him to be: “Should a school offer
a student a great number of nonacademic activities and encourage
his participation, or should a
school offer a student an academic liberal arts education and let
the student seek out for himself
nonacademic activities if he
wishes?“

Egyptians formalized these categories into set dramatic returns

los who ﬁrss made the costumes
more individual. The tasks were
enhanced and the actor's height
and shape were changed by the
costumes. When womens took over
the Greek theatre, the only change
they made was to standardize
color as symbolic oi character.
The theatre of the Middle Ages
saw the return oi the religious
drama. Costumes became grotesque and actually symbolic. The
devil was clothes in Skins with a

the cast-OHS of the rich and often
complete with levels. Special
costumes were appreciated for
Oriental or Eastern characters,
Roman and Greek characters, and
characters outside those of the
stock comedy-tragedy iheatricals.
It has been brought to our
attention recently that white

King of the Rocket Men Becomes Fetish of Youth
By ANNE FARRER
Using the term closely, print
well's fall social season has gotten
underway and has, or hopes to,
bring an array or diverse events
to supplement the ordinary stimuIating atmosphere or the Grinnell
campus.
La pulse Vita and Cannonball
elderly have come and gone with
Homecoming and Dance IM's soon
to make their annual appearance.
However, the highlight to date has
been that classic oi the silver
Screen, King of the Rocket Men.
But Jetf King has a certain
ooompli that Cannonball seemed to
lack#a snappy dresses, bottles of
evil (complicated by the fact that
his processors sport black suits in-

he is an exemption hero for to

King, it seems evident that as an
idol he should be ranked with
such create as Captain Midnight,
Superman, and Captain Video, or
if not heights as dizzying as this,
at least the Popeye and Spin and

Football Team Travels To Knox;
numbers Away simon cam , 27-0
Still searching for a more patent offense, the Pioneer football
team will travel to Galesburg tomorrow to take on the winners
SlWaShel‘s at Knox in their third
Midwest Conference game, The
Pioneers are now 1-1 after shopping a 274) contest to simon last
Saturday.
The Pioneers got off to a horrible start at simon by gambling
on the second play from script
page. After the Pioneers had
picked up seven yards on the first
play, they gave the ball to simon
near the 20. The Pioneer defense
due in though, and the Redmen
had to settle for a 24-yard field
goal. About live minutes later, Rt
non interpreted a pass on the Pioneer 40 and processed to drive in
for the score. simon also enabled
once in the drive but recovered it
themselves. The final eight yards
was covered on a pass to give the
Redmen a 10-0 lead alter the first
quarter.
The next time the Pioneers got
moving, they were thwarted by an
intervention again. A pass was
good to the Pioneer receiver, but
it shipped through his ﬁusers and
simon picked it up. The Redmen
then wanted no time in scoring
again, Quarterback Dick Kuehl
posted the ball to Bob Pelllgrino
who juggled the ball for about
three steps, then output the Pioneer secondary for the forward
touchdown.
Late in the second quarter the
Pioneers had their best chance to
 
get on the scoreboard allen John
watson created the simon quarterback, who enabled, and the
ball was recovered on the six
yard line. The Pioneers were then
pushed back to the 12 where they
again gave up the ball. A pass
was again picked off by simon af»
her the ball had shipped through
Grinnell’s hands.
Near the end of the third quad—
her the Redmen picked off another
Pioneer pass and returned it to
the five yard line, But the de—
sense held and simon picked another field goal, In the fourth
quarter the Redmen picked another Pioneer female on the Grinnell
25 and in two plays went in for the
final score Late in the fourth
quarter the Pioneers had their only sustained drive of the game
which took them to the simon five
where they processed to lose it on
another intervention.
Coach powers thought the Flu
near defensive line and line back»
era did a good job. Also the Pioneer fairfield allowed simon to
complete only seven of 27 passes,
but unfortunately three of them
were touchdowns. powers also
noted that the game would have
been very boring to the important
specialty as the game convicted
of only pants and an occasional
Pioneer mistake late in thEir territory. powers noted that simon
never got a long drive together for
a score but were always given the
ball very near the goal before
they scored,
 
To improve the offense, powers
said Grinnell must have better
dual'terbacking, blocking, and running from the halfbacks. In an
effort to beef up the offense this
week, powers plans much expert
creating. Sophomores Kent Thomson and Rich Weeks will be given
a shot at the quarterback spot.
John threshold will remain at the
halfback spot With Dick Lamb.
Bob Watt, Dave Synhorst, and
Jim Ceai-nfl in the running for
the other one, AI Peterson will
remain at one slot, but the other
will be connected for by Jim wilson, Jeff Franiz, and Tom Hill,
On defense, guard trick mail
and back John jersey will likely
miss the Knox game with InjurIesi Rick Anderson and John sitemap have also been filing but are
expected to play
Knox, which dropped its first
two games to simon 3&7, and Beloit, 41-7, currently stands north
in the league on offense and last
on defense.
The freshman grid team Will
open its schedule by meeting the
Cornell headlines Friday at Mt.
Vernon,
probably quarters, according to
Coach John deutsch, are Brian
Barnes and Dave kathy, ends;
Bob Campell and Bob cialis, tickets; AI Cloud and Grant Crandall,
guards; Randy state, center; Tom

Friday, October a. ms
that
By STEVE CASEY
The Pioneers this year have lost soccer, 3 sport which
was considered by many people, including me, to be one of
the most exciting sports of the whole year. It was especially
exciting since Coach Irv Simone was able to build strong
teams that gave staff challenges to such small college powers
as theatre and Lake Forest. Unfortunately Simone is on
leave this semester, so the sport was dropped as an official
college sport. A few of the veterans from last year’s team
have formed a soccer club, under the direction of kirk Baay
(German), This is a good idea but it will never replace the
regular teams for excitement because it was sometimes as
much fun to watch Simone as the game.
Anyway, when Simone returns, let’s hope the sport will
be resumes. The thrill of seeing the Pioneers score a goal
or seeing someone like little Fred Miller battle for the ball
among people that look twice as big as he is something which
Grinnell sports fans, especially ones who have never seen a
soccer game in person, should see. For this particular excitement can never be matched by seeing a touchdown scored or
a runner finish first in a cross-country race.
The crosscountry team was disappointed in not winning
the Les Duke occupational. But this is a good team and it would
be wrong to think otherwise, The barriers have two first-class
winners in Jeri Langham and John charge. There are also
five other good winners: Steve paintball, Doug gray, Bob
Grant, pic MacDowell, and Spencer Clark.
A person who should know, the Carleton coach whose
team is seeking its fourth straight league title, considers the
Pioneers a co»favorite along with his team to take the crown
this year. Unfortunately, Carleton has got tremendous help
from sophomores who are new four of the top five winners
on the team.
There are at least three more tough teams (Beloit, St.
Olaf, and Cornell) in the Midwest Conference this year. But
the Pioneers country detected both Cornell and Beloit in
the Les Duke occupational. So it is not unlikely that Coach
Young’s team will finish near the top as they usually do.
