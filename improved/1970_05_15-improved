The Minority Speaks Out Le++er From
On Tuesday, May 5th. 1970, at
a special faculty meeting, a
majority of the faculty passed a
resolution concerning what it
turned “official depression" in
the disaster at Kent state and
linking this with the military
action in Cambodia and the
policies ot the present national
administration. The motion was
substantially the same as that
brought to the faculty by some
Students, who claimed to
represent a majority oi those
attending a meeting in South
Lounge. The number of students
was, we were told, somewhere
between 300 and 400.
Despite these figures, the
resolution claimed to represent
“the majority of the faculty and
students.” Furthermore, the
faculty extended this claim to
represent ”Grinnell College as an
institution.”
The joint iacultystudent
resolution, then, claims to be
representative in two ways, and
both ways are, in the judgment
of the underground, ill founded.
But it is the second claim —- to
being representative of “Grinnell
College as an institution” 7 that
series century, and we are are
‘dealing to you. the trustees, to
make that century We argue as
follows:
1. Although the meeting was
well attended by faculty and
s:
administration, there were no
representatives of the trustees,
the parents, or the alumni.
2. The claim by one part oi
the institution to represent the
whole institution necessarily
involves those who distant; and
such a claim is especially unfai'i
when many members of the ins
selection had no voice at all in
the proceedings
3. The majority resolution is
highly political in nature 7 an
unprecedented and, in our view,
an improved kind oi resolution
for a college to make.
4. By suspension classes as a
part or the resolution, the faculty
placed those who wishes to
distant in an impossible position
totally and, perhaps, legally.
5. By linking together diverse
issues, and by failing to review
die extreme language oi the
resolution, the majority
presented a rational conclusion
from being reached.
We would further point out that
the member oi the meeting was
highly emotional, so much so that
the majority opened isolated a
long-standing tradition oi the
College; to respect the rights of
the individual conference,
We therefore wish to dissociate
ourselves from the resolution,
and we request that the trustees
make a similar statement
available to public notice.

A symbolic announcement was held on Central campus May 13. Five students — Susan powder. Jonathan

SGA President’s Statement
Because oi my role as chair
man in the various meetings that
have taken place recently I have
not been in a position to state
my views on the issues before
us. However, in my role as 5.0.
a. President i feel it my responsibility to state those views,
We have reached a critical
point in our history. Decisions are
being made and will continue to
be made in the near future which
will determine what path our
nation will follow ~ self-determination or intervention abroad.
liberty or authority at home,
indeed, freedom or depression in
all our actions. These are the
Choices.
In light of these events it is
necessary now that Grinnell College leave the ivory tower oi
academic and engage itself in the
struggle at hand. This departure
from formal academic endeavor
will necessarily sacrifice by all
members of this institution. But
these sacriiices pale when com.
based with the sacrifices exactly
by our nation oi the young, the
president. and people oi color all
overtheworld,
For these reasons I wholeheartedly support the Thomas
proposal.

Facul’ry Head
On Closing
To tiic President:
To common, to order, to
eliminate the events, the factors,
the elements which led, over a
period oi iivc days, to the
decision of Grinnell College on
8 May to terminals its academic
year on 13 May, fifteen days
before its scheduled commander
ment, would be a healthy and demanding task. Many and varied
and complex were the events, the
factors, the notices, the states
or mind which ted, or con»
designed, or informed the act.
But in my own Case, the concern which rose, so to speak, to
the top as l approaches the meet
ing of the Faculty on 8 May was
that which I there anticipated:
" . , . The College cannon permit
itself as a college to be so
politicians, nor indeed appear in
the public eye to be so politicians,
that its arising purposes are
qualified and its effective functioning as a focus or tree inquiry
is concluded or impaired The
College cannon today convert
itself into a political ground, be
it a real political battleground or
a mere political background, and
expect tomorrow to resume its
france of disinterested Search, of
measured registration, of
hospitality to the oldest range
of ideas alld opinions and to their
written and spoken expression.
“1 have come, over the last two
days, slowly and importantly to
the conclusion that circumstances without and within the
College, the events of the last few
days here, and the present
member and temperature oi the
student body, as l assess them.
so seriously limit our freedom oi
moreover and action that the
College must close its doors to
protect the very existence or its
educational house. True, in so
doing it cannon continue to fulfill
completely its contract with
students for instruction and in
query under conditions consensus
to instruction and learning (and
this . . . I explore and profoundly
degree), but in not so doing, 1
fear that the College forecloses,
or may ioreclose, the possibility
oi writing any future contracts
it can perform with honor and
effectiveness.
“I support the recommendation of the President and
the Trustees and I urge upon the
Faculty its acceptance."
Today, 7 days later, I remain
convinced that the action of a
May was the proper one. As I
see it, the move may well have
saved the College; in any event,
it saved the chance to save the
College,

President's
Statement 1
To Parents
As you have probably heard,
either directly from your son or
daughter or indirectly through
news reports, we are closing the
College officially at 5-00 PM. on
Wednesday, May 13, This is two
days before the formal ending of
classes, as previously scheduled,
so that only the period ot final
examinations and com
placement activities could have
remained. The copy of my normal
statement to faculty and students
on this matter is enclosed. The
faculty voted 91-4 to support it
in a separate meeting. At a
general faculty and student
assembly held Friday aiteriioon,
the student vote to support the
statement was virtually
anonymous.
The reasoning behind my
statement is essentially as
follows: No matter hoiv one may
regard the attitude oi students
both here and throughout this
nation, toward the Cambodian
affair and the Kent State in
cidcnt, it is a fact that almost
all students, from dcctrinaire
radicals to conversations, have
suddenly become so politicians
involved that they are no longer
able to give proper concentration
to their academic studies. On this
campus, as on many others, their
attention over the past two weeks
has been almost completely
directed into discussions and
activities about the political
crisis. In some educational institutions, as you know, this
activity has taken Violent forms.
Though there have been some
threats of such violent activity
here, it has not yet happened;
concentrations here have been
discipline in only a minor way.
But the important fact, as I say
in the statement I include. is that
the existing atmosphere and
member make it impossible to
continue the normal and
traditional functions of the
educational institution. her
currently, I believe it is best to
close ﬂ'le school and permit
students to carry on their
political activity elsewhere than
on this campus, not under what
might be interpreted as the
authority, formal or informal, of
the College itself.
it 1 were talking here about
something less than the great
majority of Grinnell students, I
would have recommended to the
faculty and students that
alternative ways be initiated oi
approaching the problem of
completing the school year, so
that those students who wishes
to complete their school year in
a regular fashion could do so. But
I think that the present environment does not allow for such
an option, rational and proper as
the case for it may appear to
those who believe the College
ought to be able to manage it.
No. IS
President's
Statement 2
To Faculty and Students
recognition the grave political
and educational crisis which this
nation and this college presently
face. I believe that the College
cannon continue to carry on its
thermal and traditional functions
in the next two weeks. I recognize
the desire and the need of inn
dividend members of the Come
munich to participate in consistent and informational
political activities, and by sun»
pending normal activity {or the
remainder of the current
academic year we allow individual members of the come
munich to engage in such activities,
After consultation with the
Chairman of the Board of
systems and other members of
the Board, I am therefore decor»
sending to the Faculty that
classes be suspended for the re
manager oi the academic year
and that the campus be officially
closed at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, May 13.
This means that: 1) there will
be no final examination period
this year 2) there will be no
announcement activities this
year 3) that by the period be
green now and May 13th students
will have the opportunity to meet
with their instructors to work out
arrangements for the conclusion
of their academic responsibilities
under conditions which Dean
Wall will discuss 4) that indicator
al Grinnell students will have the
opportunity to engage in
educational and informational
activities of their own choosing
until the date oi closing.
Regrettably, the College cannon
manage it without using a means
of pressure or enforcement that
it neither can use nor maintenance using.
In the live days between the
suspension of classes (that is,
from Friday, May a, through
Wednesday, May is), our major
efforts are being directed toward
interviews with faculty and
students about academic
decisions involving individual
students. As the enclosed
statement indicates, we intend to
do everything possible to see that
available arrangements in.
solving all aspects of student
welfare, academic and otherwise. are completed.
I ask for your understanding
in this time of great mistress for
the College and its Constituencies.
sincerely.

Last Friday as we returned from Newton with what
we had hoped was to be the antepenultimate issue
of the charles and Black, the campus was in turmoil.
Students were blocking to the rolling months outside
the lunch lines, and the overwhelming majority was
voting to close down the school. We carefully went
and voted for what we felt was right: preservation
of the academic status que.
No corner was the student references ended than
a faculty meeting began, during which the issue of
closing down the school was to be discussed. As the
faculty members filed into the room, they were handed
positions for five different ways to do this by five diff
recent sections of the faculty and students. Everyone
was apprehensive and uneasily preparing for a fourhour debate on the details.
When President suggest arrived to chair the
meeting, he did a very thread thing. He presented
a proposal to the faculty for closing the school, but
one which most of the faculty felt combined the best
features of all the other proposals. Most, indeed! The
faculty voted 91 to 4 to enlarge it,
Thereupon Mr. Morris presented a resolution to
the faculty for commitment itself as a body to
a particular political france. In suite of the protest
of Mr. myers and Miss Noble and a few others, the
proposal passed. In other words, the minority individual
conference was firmly and vigorously rated. But the
faculty was in a harry to get over to party symposium
and collect its standing station from the students.
Now, some seven days later, some members of the
community are having secondsﬁrights. The procedures
which have been history signed to preserve some substance of an academic commitment to the students
amidst the shemales of this semester are so comply—
rated and inadequate that even those who wanted to
close the school are promoting among themselves. A
very dangerous president has been set that will
ultimately remove all need for argument when
questions such as credit-fail in requirements and motors
come up, when students want to close down the school
in the fall for elections, when the majority wants to
subscribe the name of the college to a political
movement.
Earlier this year, in a report to the faculty by Mrs.
Helena consent, Spanish, on the Midwest copyright Conference on Higher Education held at the University
of Iowa, June 1969, these words were spoken: “Institutionsof higher learning operated under several contracting funding principles cannon survive. It is not so much
any more ‘a house divided cannon stand’ as ‘an institution without clear goals cannon exist’." No one listening
The visitors would like to express their institute to all those who
have helped with the paper, this semester and a special vote oi thanks
goes to professor n. o. Apostle, who shared with us his invcsllg
into the nature oi a liberal education, something dear to us all.

To the Editor:
It is an observation

pleasure the current stresses on
mind and body and soul by lbs

seven years at the College, to
adopt a moral position. In fact,
Dean Wall reforms me that the

faculty had no idea of what more

was kept on automatic grounds. 1
was unable to get the floor to

The Nature of a Liberal Education: A Definition
By H. o. Apostle
Let us now summaries the
results oi the preceding Parts
and discuss some items related
loaliberal education asawhole.
Man, it was stated, is a complex being with a variety oi
needs; hence he is capable of
a variety of treasures. But the
fulfillment of just one or a few
kinds of needs, and so of
treasures, is not sufficient for a
life of richards, and such lack
of sufficiently also brings paint,
Hence a learned should become
aware oi a variety oi interests
and should acquire the
corresponding iiabits. vcr
cordiiigly, two things are
necessary knowledge and art
according to knowledge in a
variety of fields. The exercise of
knowledge alone can yield only
treasures of the mind; that at
art according to knowledge can
yield treasures also of action, for
many human activities and
disciplines (politics, medicine,
etc) require both kinds; and the
two kinds are not accurately
furnished without health. Of
course, one cannon afford to
become interested in all
disciplines, and so there must be
a selection, But one defects from
what he knows there is to select,
and the greater the number of
things to select from, the better
the selection. The kind of
education called “liberal,” then,
is designed (a) to make the
student aware of what there is
to select and (b) to develop in
him the proper habits, in
tellectual, artistic, and ethical,
which make happiness probably
(happiness being a sort of hard
many ot treasures and available
oi paint), for treasures from
improved habits bring also paint,
like‘the paint which follow the
treasures oi herein, and the
result is history and unhappiness. Now there are treasures
of the mind and treasures of the
lenses; and under a developed
mind are included a career, a
good excellent in a general sense,
and the appreciation oi the arts,
while under a developed
character come a variety of
treasures. including those of the
lenses. The definition of a
literally educated person,
therefore, follows from what has
been said,
DEFINITION: A literally
educated person is one who has
acquired sufficiently (l) a
developed mind, which includes
la) a good excellent in a general
way, (1)) ii sense oi appreciation
for the arts, and to) good training
form career; (2) a good character
through the required knowledge
and the exercise of the
corresponding proper habits; and
t3) knowledge and the
corresponding habits necessary
to maintain and promote a
healthy body, all oi these for the
sake of a continuous life of
happiness.
Under “a developed mind” we
include coiirscs on the following
topics- the history of our present
civilization, methodology lthe
nature of a science and an arlli
a natural science (mathematics
or physics or chemistry or
biology) treated in a general or
in a technical manner, and a
social science Under “the appreciation of arts” we include one
or two courses from various
helps (music, painting, English
or foreign literature, sculpture,
etc ) Under “development of
character” we include a
discussion course in ethics; and
under ”health," physical
education and a course on health.
These courses should constitute
the minimum requirement, for
various careers require additional courses, which should be
the concern of the individual
departments.
Most required courses should
be taken in the first two years,
but there should be some
flexibility. The course of
methodology should be given in
the junior or senior year, for
some preparation in the sciences
and the arts is available, and
some majority is required to
understand the abstract concepts
common to the sciences and the
arts. A career, we stated, is oi
major importance, so the
preparation of it should not be

delayed by overburdening the
student with requirements in his
first two years ii the student has
already decided on a career.
Creativity and discovery in the
special helps are best developed
in early years, and specialization
in the various fields suggests an
early start, so if the student's
interest has already been
accused in a given field, it should
not bchandicapped at the start
Concerning that part oi the
development of the mind and of
character which has to do with
art in certain human affairs
(responsibility, government,
decision~making in practical affairs in general), it should cerr
rapidly be promoted, especially in
those students whose careers
require much action. But by
definition a student is a learned
and does not have the knowledge
and the majority to make acer
quote decisions concerning the
larger issues, such as those air
listing the general interests oi
the state or of the nation or of
the world, or even oi tiic college
But for tiic sake oi learning,
students should be allowed and
encouraged to make decisions on
lesser issues, where any harm
that may come will not be
significant, as in running their
own affairs in the directories,
provided that such decisions do
not run contrary to the basic
rights of all students, But to allow
students to participate in decisions on faculty centre, faculty
promotions, admissions policy,
selection or a president, and other
matters which affect the general
interest oi the college, would be
unlike indeed, for this runs
contrary to the very idea that
students are still learners. They
may discuss such issues among
themselves and with the faculty
and the administration, and they
may make suggestions; in fact,
such discussions and suggestions
should be encouraged,
Since part oi the means oi
happiness is the formation oi the
proper habits, both armenia»
factors and faculty should see to
it that this part is neither isolated
nor reflected. Flagrant violation
of college rules by students leads
to similar violations of the laws
of the land when such students
leave the college community.
Now just as bad laws are better
than no laws at all, so bad rules
are better than no rules at all;
and, as stated earlier, students
should be free to make their
thoughts and wishes known to the
administration, if they consider
certain. rules bad. But william
violation and configuration
should never be allowed, for this
leads to lack of respect,
disregard of reason and experience, and the constitution of
edition as a means. All these
defeat the way of learning and
the purpose oi a liberal education
as usually understood and as
defined here.
The argument that violence
(we may also include vandalism,
building moreover, delivering
interference in education, etc.)
on or oil campus by students is
holidays certified because it
forces educational or political
authorities to change existing ills
is closely miss’pulled. Some ills
do exist, always existed, and will
always exist, and an ideal society
Page Three
 
 
 
 
Yale Has Nothing On Us
is only a dream, and the effort
to correct existing ills must always be welcome. But students
in our nation today never had it
so good for many reasons: they
are potentially well off, they are
given the opportunity to study,
they are given the freedom of
choice, their future is well
assured, and their processors and
administrators are not authoritarians. Comparison with
students in other nations should
continue anyone of our
educational supervision in these
reflects, Again, the students'
aim should be education, not the
prevention of it by violence; and
the consumption by some of them
to superior knowledge in
mobility, politics, and other such
great issues is ridiculous. Fur»
lher, such students tend to defeat
the very independence of educa
tion ii-om political interference;
for if students have the right to
interface with national
authorities through violence,
politicians have a similar right
to interface with the students'
education, and the victor will not
be the students. So let politicians
take care oi politics, and
educators (not students) take
care of education. students’ right
to act politicians through their
elected representatives has
never been denied, and individually they are free to protest and
parade peaceiully without pre
meeting education. As for change,
the most probably change
through a period of violence or
chaos is not reform but directories moreover, like that by the
army in Greece in 1967 ‘ a bad
alternative. Finally, it is only a
small minority of students who
advocate and resort to violence;
and they do so at the expense
of the majority
It's a sad commentary on those
administrators who, in the name
of "tolerance” or some other
such misconception, allow the
irresponsible actions at an creature, determined, revolutionary, arrogant, and discussed
minority to interface with the
education oi a good and serious
mayor-its As already stated in a
previous Part. the serious
violations holidays differ in
kind, not in degree; hence, they
require a treatment which like
wise drivers in kind, not in degree,
For a student who ears and ad;
hits his action as an error. the
penalty should be one oi
correction, But for a student who
opened series the rules or resorts
to violence, the answer is not a
penalty oi correction but reference from the college, The
effort to try to change the mind
of such a student (and the
correction returns are negligible)
can better be used for better
purposes elsewhere; and the
damage by organizing him lighter
results in encouraging others to
do likewise, Such penalty, we
may add, should apply especially
lo pi-oiessors, whose character
and ideas are less subject to
change, it they advocate
violence. Recent over-sentence
has failed, and explanation oi a
cure is based on shake principles.
Prevention would have been
better.
Ultimately, the responsibility
tests with the Trustees, for
ultimate direction of the lack of
it issues from them; and it is
a grave responsibility, for higher
learning is a national responsibility. not limited to Just the
college in which it is imported.
Perhaps some change in the
distribution of power is needed
in many colleges, and perhaps
authority should be assigned to
persons who are both responsible
and knowledgeable in the field
where authority is exercises.
Authority to impose penalties for
violation oi college rules, for
example, dos not belong to students, and an authorization body
which includes them (like our
Judicial Council; free students,
three processors) is likely to lead
to ineiiiciency, ineiiectivencss,
arbitration, and even insurance.
The recent events at the University or Northern iowa illustrated
the point, and President tracker

If we must sacrifice to show our

why must we always sacrifice

Women performed better
dramatically during the first
semester than men of
computation at Yale University.
A breakdown of grades at four
levels revealed: “Honors"
women 27.5 per cent, men 23,9 per
cent; “high pass” e women 46
per cent, men 39.6 per cent;
”pass" a women 18.6 per cent,
men 23.4 per cent; "fail” —
women 0.9 per cent, men 1.4 per
Cent.
The percentages represented
the grades of 3,254 men and 566
women at the university.
for the college atmosphere for
proper habits was strong enough
to discounted improved habits
But that atmosphere is dis
appearing now, and there is
nothing left to replace it, except
“personal conference," a police
term for individual carried,
which is nothing more than a set
of contradictory thoughts and
actions. What is needed today.
then, is the reinstatement of
proper conduct through the
awareness of the principles
which justify that conduct; for
to change just the habits is
neither easy nor intellectually
continuing.
Finally, although experience of
opinion should be allowed, it does
not follow that every opinion
which is different should be given
an equal hearing. There are also
opinions which are obviously bad
or obviously harmful or obviously
destruction, and to honor them
as if they were equal alternatives
or equally controversial is
ridiculous and unlike. If men
with different opinions have truth
as their aim, they should be like
friends trying to determine which
of the opinions are true; so there
the terms “Controversial" and
”experience of opinion.” So since
the pursuit of important trucks
is good, and this is one of the
aims of a liberal education,
administrators and faculty and
students should be like friends
trying to discover and impact
that which is true. Friendship,
even more than justice, is a basis
in any community which is
formed for the sake of some good.
As printable says, ”friendship
seems to hold a state together,
and daughters care more for
friendship than for Justice; for
when men are friends,
justice is not wanting, but when
they are just, they still need
friendship, and the action which
is most just is considered to be
the one which is done in a friendly
man." If so, then, friendship is
even more important in an
educational community, for here
truth and cordless and beauty
are pursuit to the highest
degree. The lack of this quality
in the educational institutions of
a nation is a strong sign of a
grave failure, for if thﬁe institutions cannon promote this quality,
no others can, and the whole
nation sellers.

of a total disregard for the student Whose work it is. This chief
is a paradise who sets himself
so far, above his fellow students

Open Letter;
Tonight I am sick with the
events of this day. Isee this institution as a number of people,
some who have after in good
faith for a cause in which they
believe. But I see many others,
students and faculty alike, who,
through the emotional intensity
of the moment, have been adopted into a movement and an
action which will destroy this
school.
It’s all in your priorities, you
say, and 1 agree. But my priori
theatre different. Anyone who
really knows who I am knows
that I favor the political views
of the people who want this
place closed. But I
have watched these people
take both the student body
and the Iacultyof this college and
here them like sheep into an
action that sets a very dangerous
president for future activities on
the campus. What are you going
to do the next time something
like Kent or Cambodia happens?
Where are you going to draw the
line the next time?
What really parts is to see how
so many people, who normally
offer lots of debate to any proposal on this campus, can accept
with so little question a badly
thoughtout, radical proposal,
illustrated by a basically impressive campus. Who is going
to answer to my friends who are
seniors, who will miss the combination of their college
careers? Who will answer to my
friends who came to his place
to learn to think? Who will answer to people who don’t know
what they are going to do with
the sudden burden of three empty
weeks, some who have no place
to live until June, many who must
try to recently without the benefit
of much»needs'd student employment checks for the month of
May? Who will answer to the
students who see the action as
irrelevant to die larger issues
that face our nation, yet must
explain to their parents what is
happening here'! But most important, who will answer to the

What purposeful measures can
