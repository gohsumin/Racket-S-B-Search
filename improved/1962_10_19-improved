“The need to communicate,”
said service, “has in all men
at all times been strong. years
ly to the point of commission.
For the artist, the problem oi l
communication is relatively .
simple as long as he uses hair~ 1

”In such a case, it is possible

the conventional can appeal to

however, that many artists to,
day constitutes avoid the used
ot familiar object and ordinary

medication is considerable more
difficult and quite often it sim-l

the public. “It is the responsibility oi every’sensitive Observ-i
er,” he said, “to bring with:
him a certain degree oi ilexei
ability." l
As viewers, we are apt to‘
make communication betwccni
ourselves and the artist impose‘
bible by our very attempts to
intellectualize the content oi a
painting, he said. The way to_
abstract art is not, service
said, through our excellent or
through an understanding oi
the historical background of a
painting. although both oi these
may occasionally be of
help.
soiiic‘
"The way to abstract art is
through an emotional reaction between the painting and
the disorders» In defense oi
this emotional reaction, CCr- ‘
reno observed that ”edition

where, even without ii logical .
proof, we are willing to believed”
service then came to the res
cut oi So~called Action Painting,
which derived its name from
the “‘moritevigol‘oussthan-u s u a 1

he said, ”that should be approved, not the technique." He went

I. CLASSIFICATION OF CASES
Because the W'open's Primary Court deals with Cases of two
distinct types, there are two different pi'oeedui realized, The
two types of cases might be labelled “final and "major,"
based upon the relative reporting of the expenses involve , but
the chief distinguishing feature is the nature of the evidence
available.
Minor cases are those involving “prime fncic" evidence,
that which inconlcsiablv established llc guih of the defendant.
(c. g. lalcncss cases, whereas a card signed upon late entry is
the available evidence). The question in these cases is one of
the circumstances behind the late enli-y, for example, and a
hearing is held to determine the degree of responsibility of the
defendant within the equation, In these cases (he protection is
not necessary. However. witnesses may be produced by the de»
pendant. Cases falling into this category are late entries and
sign-in or signvout violations. those witch continuing inc orci»
checking majority of the Court's transactions.
Major Cases are those where there is a question of the
built of the defendant, where there is no such incontestablc
evidence as a form signed by the defendant. In these cases
a protection presents evidence on behalf of the Executive
Branch in the effort to establish built and ordinary trial precious'e is followed as it is outlined below.

D. The Court Secretary notified the Prosecutor of the plea
in order that she may prepare for a hearing if the plea is
“guilty" or a trial if the plea is “not guilty".
