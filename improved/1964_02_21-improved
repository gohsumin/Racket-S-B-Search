tags and seniors Converge Upon Convention
The current week has teenage of political concentration
on campus issues and consideration toward a future campus
leader, Tomorrow’s convention
will demand the serious attention of the student body for the
purpose of selecting the final
candidates for SGA president.
But a convention would be
both long and full without the
fully produced by the “not-solutions” mind. For this reason
Grinnell students welcome the
.platforms and the optics of the
jan candidates.
Perhaps the most serious jan
candidate of them all was
~"links" Barnes, who was running in 1943. Barnes was a serious continued for president until it was disCovered that he

The year 1957 had a bumper
crop of jan candidates, 16 in

The final selection of
an SGA president will de-
send more on possibilities than on issues, because the
candidates don‘t differ a great deal on the issues.
It is not particularly interesting to see that the candidates are crossing the middle of the road. Grinnell
students have certainly had their share of empty promises, and the fact that all three candidates can see a
common goal adds to the validity of that goal.
Generally speaking, the goal is one of attitude
change. We would agree with the candidates that the
last year has been one of conﬂict and misunderstanding. Unfortunately, the conflict was necessary because
of the preventing attitude that students and administration cannotthink alike or serve each other.
We look forward to an SGA president who not
only reflects his position as a student, but who reflects
the positions of those who work in administrative posts
above him. We look forward to an SGA president who
will concern himself with rule enforcement before rule
creation. We look forward to a year of accomplishment
rather than waste.

Meyer Sees Interim Projects Offering Four Advantages
To the Editor:
There has been a great deal
of criticism, these past few
weeks, of the interim session.
Lack of student incentive,’ the
waiting of time, and so on are
the general complaints. Maybe
we are not using our lime to the
best advantage (although I
don’t feel that matching up on
reading the news, sleep, and
just talking are such a criminal
waste of time). Perhaps we
don't have much incentive—but
is whether or not we study
such a gross lack of intellectualDoes all this really add up to
such a gross lack of intellectuallsm and interests?
Let me answer by making
a proposal. I suggest that in
future interim sessions each
student be required to register with the college a particularvindependent project he intense to carry out during in-
 
terms. This project can he on
any topic, may or may not result in a final product, and may
he as absolutely free and independent as the student
wishes. The purpose of begin
tl‘union is two fold: first, the
student is more likely to Carry
out his project if he has actually registered it and it is
not merely a value idea in his
head, and recently, this would
provide lists of students and
the general areas in which they
are studying. These lists could
be both posted, that the std»
cents could make Contact with
others interested in the same
area, and given to faculty, so
that students could seek help
and guidance from them,
should they so desire.
There are four major advantages to this kind of interim
session. First, it gives the
freshmen and sophomores a
 
friedlander Says Grant From Ford
Curtails Administration's flexibility
To the Editor:
Let us induced in some simple arithmetic. Most of us desire to attend Grinnell for four
years. For this privilege we
must , contribute $2,400 per
year, with an annual increase
of $150, so the equipment
which must progress one direction or the other, is not totally
reported. Meanwhile the administration, brave souls, launch
into a campaign, soon to be
completed, to silicon (did your
parents contribute?) four million dollars |n less than three
years. That is about four theirsand for each and every student, l.;l thousand dollars per
year per student. (We will not
here discuss to whose benefit
this \money is used but Will
Submit that the administration
is carefully various ro continue
the flow.)
But maybe this is not really
so bad. Are not the curtailment
of student government and the
arbitrary actions of the admin
isolation the necessary price to
attack the free two million
dollars which the Ford promo
uses us. Imagine, $500 for ev»
my student! ! Yes, we may
get hardcore buildings and
reasonable {BM machines, but
let us never forget that the
Ford has kindly. Offered us the
option on another matching
fund. The administration will,
without doubt, accept in our
name. No lower tuition, no re'
taxation, since each new million will be harder to court.
Now who really creates these
impressive Sums? The admin»
isolation would argue for its
fine corps of busmessmen and
our fine president who expand
immeasurable examines of
brain energy to entire the likely With the old “cornell students run the college” bit. Up
on reflection, however, it may
be readily seen, that it is we,
the students, who please the
wheel that makes the cart collect.
 
 
What would the administration do without students?
Die/l 1! It is true that they
would probably, at first, indicate, with the money saved
from expenditures on students,
a tremendous fund~raising specs
popular—“the student does not
even feel he is going to a college" bit—but we may rest assured that some innocent cons
tribunal will finally notice the
disappearance of all buildings
but nursing Library with its
basement.
And what would happen to
the students if the administrav
tion disappeared tomorrow? We
would, quite naturally, go to
another college. (At first. it is
true, we might try it alone; but
who would be Dean of Men,
a necessary dollar for any libera] institution.) it may be
argued that the administration
would also find new jobs but
where, may we ask, could a
busmessman find such a secure job. So upon nursery examination, it may be seen that
it is we, the students, not the
administration, who make the
college. We are the ones who
study. while on the basis of
our accomplishments they
speak of their achievements.
So let the dollars and sense
be recognized. The students
and administration have a mud
dual dependence. Should we
also not have mutual online»
tions and rights? Ii this is not
the case, and it most certainly
is not, the dollar sign may be
seen behind it.
(All this may sound too simple, and it is, so we must wars
anyone whose are is unduly ever
rated to work it Off at 651: an
hour for Saga and contribute
the sum to the Ford. Work
only 4,405,881 hours and the
president will shake your hand
and know your name, too.) God
bless the faculty, may we communicate.

weight involve. It gives seniors
and seniors a chance to study
Outside of their major ﬁend.
Second, this kind of interim
program should provide guidance for those who need and
Want it. I think that part of this
lack of interest of incentive so
often mentioned in connection
with interim is caused by a
lack of self-discipline coupled
with a lack of knowledge about
how to do independent study.
One of the main complaints of
students is that the faculty
don’t seem interested enough in
students. The faculty reply that
they don’t have the time.
Third, in this kind of interim.
the faculty would have no
classroom responsibility and
would have more time to give
to the students. I cannon think
of a more perfect way of
getting to know a professor, or
students interested in one’l
field than through a good informal discussion over coffee
during interim. Another complaint often voices is the lack
of intellectual d i a o u 55 i o n l
among students on campus.
This kind of interim would provide an excellent opportunity
to meet and talk to people who
are interested in the Sam.
kinds of things as you are.
Under this plan the basic interim would not have changed.
There would be no one to check
up on you to see what you had
accomplished; there would be
no outside pressure to accomplish anything final. It would
be a time of relation and of
study. There would still be
movies, lectures, the JLA,
comes, etc. The essential difference would be that there
would be guidance for those
who wanted it. With this sort
ol interim program. 1 think you
would find that most of the socalled Student apache, lack of
incentive, and lack of internet<
dual authority would disappear.

Miscellany and regression l
“Student government must
reorganize itself beautifully. It
must no longer care whether
or not it is placed with administration function and legitimate.” With these words
which appeared in a diamond
statement distributed lastgweek
and signed “sublime,” the
source of tlte‘problems of the
trim-tell College community
could be seen.
For in the statement by sublime is the type of reasoning
which has created the problems which are manifest on the
Grinnell campus. The thoughts
of sublime, however he, she or
they may be, are the product of
a selflisl‘l, unrealistic, and totally irresponsible philosophy
which has developed on the
Grinnell campus.
Behind this philosophy seems
to lie a belief in some sort of
divine right of students. Freedom and the sanctity of the individual appear to be cornerstones of this philosophy. But
missing is any connection the
regulations and response ties
which must be present in any
society to ensure freedom and
sanctity of the individual for
everybody.
This philosophy assumes that
the students possess the definition knowledge and judgment
concerning social beliefs and
practices. Thus, whatever the
students want, they should receive. The right of the faculty,
administration, and even the
Board of Trustees to have any
control over student regulations is denied.
Perhaps sublime is right
when he says there should be
a representation of student
government. However, the failures of the present system are
 
not the ones he pictures. The
current problems in student
government certainly cannon be
placed on an overemphasis on
rule enforcement.
Perhaps student government
has failed because it has been
guided by the same philosophy
which guides sublime. Perhaps
the administration views std<
sent government with contents
(a claim made by sublime) because student government has
viewed the administra 'on with
contents.
Basically the process of student government is anonymous
to a game. But one cannon succeed at a game unless one understands and follows the rules
of that game.
Maybe more could be accomplished with a student government which understands and
willingly observed the rules of
the game. For the rules of the
game are not going to be
changed simply to suit the
which of a group of students
who will spend only four years
on the campus. And if those
who are attempting to destroy
the game succeed, they will
have destroyed their only road
to accomplishment.

Weyrauch contacts Menu for Good Student Government
Mainlngredient—Appetizing Fare of death Leadership
Lately, people have been
coming up and talking to me on
central campus about the unsavory student government at
Grinnell. The consensus seems
to be that there is an unsatisfied hunger for government that
is not in bad taste.
I have applied a great deal
of thought to this problem, and
it has joined down to the fact '
that the only way to bring good ‘
taste back into student government is for me to run for SGA
president as SAGA’S favorite
Son.
After carefully studying the '
Various candidates and their
platforms, I sincerely feel that
I am the only man with the
right recipe to Vitaminize the
illustration which is so 'despairingly evident at Grinnell,
I feel that the piece de resistance in the present selection of student life is the SGA
providence. This is THE indeed-
 
sent that needs to be spaces
up! As a very flavorful leader,
I am sure that in no time I can
 
"SKIP-IT"
find where the taste seasonings
have been finland. With this
knowledge in my hands, any calendars of my menu will be
viewed in their own juice.
with these more lipssmacking
measures, the first steps will be
taken towards the creation of
a new receive board for Grinnell
students, which in turn will
lead to a more military atmosphere in which the college, a la
case, will be fed a fare of
means leadership that they can
really link their shops over.
Everyone who has water
SAGA food knows how SAGA
reaches the heart with burning
assistance. Let me, with my
recipe for student government,
get to the heart of the probe
less at Grinnell. If I am SGA
president, the trouble makers
in unappetizing government offices will soon find their houses
cooked.
Arthur (Skip) Weyrauch
 
Hannah favorites Sinlessness via following Puritanism:
Help Stamp Out Sex Alcohol, and Pseudo-lntellectualism
Before any responsible student government is possible
there must be REVIVAL—removal of the individual as a porno removal of the balanced individual, campus, and government association. I maintain
that the only possible way to
save ourselves, and our followed school, is to recent of the
evil and wilderness to which
we have sold ourselves and
adopt the policy of following
Puritanism. As earlier assurance for this office I also am
against Puritanism that merely
cheers. Concern for Puritanism must not be admitted to a
Faculty - Student committee
where it will be
around for a year or two,
dropped in discuss and arbitration, and then forgotten as
the committee members leave
Grinnell. following Puritanism
must be inspired Within each
heart so that as capable individuals we may act in a reasonable and responsible way.
On this campus there are
four major video that have
claimed the hearts, minds, and
souls of many of the brethren.
Sex, alcohol, over or pseudo-
b altered‘
 
intellectuallsm, and the desire
for the powers of government
and legislation over fellow students. Sin, yes my brothers I
said SIN, is the selling of the
mobility of the Whole person,
spirit, mind, body, and desired
to one of these evans. The only
way that it is possible for you
to wide this evil and sin from
your hearts, minds, and actions is to adopt following
Purltanism completely and
practice it until once again,
with Hannah’s help, you are
able to see in perspective the
full human possibility.
That government is best
which covered, and does not
lose itself in filing and publishing the machine. As president Of the SGA I intend to put
this principle into practice.
Open rooms at all times that
when the brothers feel the spirit they may gather for hymn
songs. Weekly trips, via Covered Wagon, into various sinful Grinnell futures that those
who have sold themselves into
intellectualism may remember
that try as they might they
are still in and of this world.
One half hour compulsory re-
vital services held before
classes that we may go forth
with the joy of salvation in our
hearts and some common relief
ious ground on which to build
a student life and government.
Oh yes Brethren, REPENT!
porsche the ways of Main’s
passion pit and daily lit Una
ion. surge himself of the evans
of alcohol, rescue himself from
the fate of an individual trades
in for a beaver of crew. Leave
off concern for your next meal
for it is merely sustainable for
the true living experience. .
Pledge yourself to spend at
least two hours a day away
from the evans of losing your
sell in the pursuit of words,
pages, and grades. Remember
that it does not take twenty
sets of senate committees and
courts to interview a simple one
sentence rule that we accepted
when we joined ourselves to
Grinnell and that exists simply
that there may be some order
in the chaos of existence (abilities to PGK).
REPENT! porsche unworthy
estimates! Follow Hannah to
the true way! Hallelujah!
 
Hallelujah Hannah

information— not negative—
is to be the key for the year’s
activities. informative action—not negative response—should
be our goal.
The Grinnell College Community is bound together in the
search for knowledge. Yet, it is
this question of community
which has split this campus.
We have become involved in a
various circle of power tests—
not completely unlike the situation in the world with nuclear
testing. With three integral
parts to the machine, any one
of them has the ability to seriously compile the machine. This
thesis cannon be tested much
further. The machine is on the
verse of breaking down. What
is needed is a shift in attitude
on the parts of all three portions involved in the machine.
 
We must all begin thinking and
acting in the best interests of
the Grinnell College common-
its.
If our efforts are to be successful, it will involve give
and take for all segments of
are community. Rules change,
individual action, and the
structure of student government must all be considered
against the yardstick of the
communityAhy any group considering any type of action.
If ﬂie activities within the
community are functioning
smoothly, no one need worry
about the image of this college.
Student government must begin working with longer range
goals. Change does not come
about in a community of this
type overnight. if one area of
interest is temporarily blogger
not talk with them, games than
passing resolutions and threatening concentrations. There
are problems common to all of
us, and these things should be
worked on somewhere With metabolism constantly present this
year, this has been difficult,
and usually impossible. Next
year will be different.
In addition to its attitude,
student government has been
planned with some structural
problems. The biggest weak<
news in student government is
the interference and disinterest of large numbers of student
senators. Policy is passed with
little intelligent discussion, with
little information, and with a
poor understanding of the issues involved. This could be
improved by (1) attraction
more interested and competent
people into Senate seats, and
(2) forming senators to take a
 
 
more active role in all sectors
of SGA, rather than merely at»
sending meetings on Wednes—
day nights.
This could be done by (1)
election half of the senators
in an lit-large race before
House Council and AWS Board
elections begin, and by (1) designing each senator to work
as an ex'officer member of
one other branch of SGA. Space
here does not allow for a full
discussion of this proposal, but
I hope to be talking with each
of you during this week.
other than a change in attitude and a structural reform,
one more major change is
necessary. This year student
government has been observed
with rules. Virtually all of the
activities of the Senate were
consolidated in this one area.
Rules and regulations are certainly an important concern of
 
student government, and they
will continue to be, but other
things are also of concern. Student government should bee
come actively involved in the
Southern exchange program~<
so far generally ignored. Grinnell should be worked into the
new NSA Student Hostel Pro<
gray. A course evaluation sys<
tel should be initiated. Under
such an arrangement, each std<
sent makes an objective ejaculation of each of his courses
and processors at the end of
each semester. All of these
things are legitimate matters
for student government action.
A change in attitude, a
change in structure, and a shift
in focus —these are major
changes, but they are necessary if SGA is to fulfill its role
as an effective and construction part of the Grinnell come
munich.

Has informative Action as Goal .
in the process, we must shift
our attention to other areas.
 
PARKISON
 
One good place to start would
be the Arbor Lakeproject—
the construction of a college retreat reader to the campus.
An eye must be kept on the
national scene for activities affecting us in our roles as students. There was such an op—
community this year with the
tax bill and its clause concerning an increased reduction for
parents with dependence in college. This clause was detected
in the Senate by three votes.
There is no way of entertaining
what influence letters—either
from us, from our parents, or
both—could have had on that
vote. It was an opportunity
passed by.
At this time, i feel little cancer for the structure of stud
sent government, per se. I
should like to see the soil-[P
and AWS Board used more, as
informal legislative bodies to
work with the Executive Cabinet in circulation policies and
programs to be presented to
the Student Senate. However,
this does not pressure the pos<
mobility of change; it circumstances should so warrant during the year. '
We have learned much this
year; our efforts should not be
to reflect what has occurred,
but rather to realize the full
import of what has happened.
Then we must proceed with a
new approach towards achieving our objectives. The first
and most immediately necessary step is the re-establishment of mutual respect between
the student body, the faculty,
and the administration.

Enforcement .tlie Crux of 56A Dilemma insert: Pi
We must decide now whether we Want ‘Student government, or Whether we are going
to allow it to draft into religion. Government by students
is continually requested by all.
Yet once we received the power to modern ourselves, We declined to accept the responsibility to do so.
The availability of student
government from our standpoint is that it gives us a care
main degree of freedom within
our community and allows us to
experience the problems interest in any democracy. lt trains
us in the responsibilities each
member of a community must
accept and in this way further
prepared us for our adult life.
From the viewpoint of the ad—
registration and faculty, government by students is part of
the constant motivation process. It'is desirable to become
accustomed to governing and
being governor by our peers.
Naturally, the framework of
student government does not
establish itself as the ultimate
authority. The framework contains»a system of checks and
balanced which in our case
take the form of higher authorities. But this does not mean
government by students is a
manage. We are generated specific areas in which we can act,
and within set limits, we can
act as we wish.
The open rooms question has
become the example of a std»
sent government to many people. it has been established as
a type of controlled experiment.
We have generally declined to
accept the responsibility given
to us, and the repercussions
have been many, up to and including suggesting disposition
of student government. Unfortunately. this is not an isolated
example of student failure, but
rather, it services most areas
of student life.
Student government is worth
saving, if for no other reason
than‘that the alternativegadministrative action—is unavailable. We must rid ourselves of
irresponsible government, accept and efforts the rules and
restrictions as they exist today,
and change those aspects we
disease in the future. Until
changes occur in our policies,
we ‘must accept the response»
bility of enhancing them.
The i textile is ours to take.
We wanted government by std-
cents. If We still want it, we
must face the reality of the
present situation and do some—
thing about it. I want student ‘
government to continue, and I
intend to assure its continue<
tion in its present form. This
involves enabling responsible
government by students and
then attempting to change it to
meet our desired. This I pledge
to do.

Their last saint hopes of o

week ago, cornell’s variety
basketball squad now terms in
on the thick of a three-team
race for second place with a
two-day road trip to Beloit and
joe. The Pioneers take on the
Bucs tonight and move on to
Cedar Rapids for another night
game against joe tomorrow.
P lo n e e r mentor John
deutsch indicated earlier this
week that he plans to continue
to experiment to try and find
a winning combination, John
russell, the league‘s leading
remainder, appears fit again
after a boat of illness which
limited him to 21 total re-'
sounds in the last two games
— about half his average.
.Tim Mifflln, the team’s leading scores with a 20.4 mark, and
Jeff grants, who nested 47
points against the invaders
from Northficld to up his average to 17.0, appeal- to be certain quarters. deutsch was also
pleased with the work of reserve Ted sister and tabs RisV
ser for more action this week
end.
Beloit, tonight’s opponent,
is currently tied for fifth in
the Midwest Conference and
a win over the Pioneers could
move Coach Bill hampton’s
crew into fourth, The Bucs
are started by forward Bob
Rudolph and guard Dave men-
Odricks, both with 16 point
operates. Belait also has a
revenge mobile working for
them since Grinnell cooler
off the hot-shooting Wisconsin team earlier this year by
an 83-76 count.
joe, although mixed in north
place with a 4.9 record, processes perhaps the most patent
172 punch in the league this
season .in dylan kitty (19.4
points per game) and Skip
Swan (19.3 points per game).
Moreover, the Kuhawks have
good depth Pioneer fans can
latest to this after the Grinnell
team held title to eight points
in their 73-71 cliffhanger win
last month, only to have guard
Bob decimal toys in 20 points
to almost pull the game 0th of
the fire for the Kohawks.
Optimistically, Coach deutsch
sees a good chance for a double
victory this trip. The Pioneers .
have joined both teams before
and. badly enough, are playing
better ball on the road so far
this year than at home.

Berg,'Frank Relate Experiences
Al Argonne National Laboratory
By John Wolf
Grinnell seniors Fred Berg
and James Frank have recently returned from a semester of
study at the Argonne Nation-
1 Laboratory near Chicago.
swing their stay at Argonne,
ey had the opportunity of being part of a research community.
”Its almost impossible”.
Berg commented ”to do real research in physics at a small college becauserthe needed equivalent is so expensive. At Ar-
onnc I was able to do rewards
aug research in physics; al~
though of course, our freedom
in using the equipment was him~
Ited because it was so excel-
’ site and because we locked the
necessary training. "
“We had three obligations
ﬁusing our stay at krgonne,”
Frank noted. ”First, each stukIent selected a project and
? supervisor from among the
all-time Argonne researchers.
’A paper concerning the project
had to be'written at the end
pf the semester.
“Second, we had to attend
periodic seminars in our major
held—either biology. chemistry,
or physics. In my biology seminar, all seven students gave
england-one-half hours talks on
a series of general topics which
were researcher in Argonne’s
.xcellent‘ libraries.
/ ‘jFinally, there were weekly
interdisciplinary seminars during which we were exposed to
the different facets of the lab,
within the limits of our background.”
Frank’s project was the determination ot the changes of
effective density of diOXyribonucleic acid (DNA) at varying
pH levels. He received that,
”one machine, a $26 000 ultra—
contribute, gave me some trouble. ”
Berg 5 paper was titled “The
Nuclear german Effect in
NbiiSnllQ.”
“I was trying to determine
the superconducting regions in
niobium tin, If they existed. The
experiment involved using the
Mossbauer Effect.”
Berg also assisted his advisor
in other experiments.
“We had to complete one sixweek experiment in two weeks
because they were closing down
one of the realtors for repair.
To add to the rush, the radio«
active material we were using
had a short half~life. So, each
time we needed the interactive material, I had to rush
over in a special cart, get the
material from the realtor, and
rush back. We even had people
holding open doors "
“There was generally very
little pressure on us from our
supervisors," F r a n k said.
“That dress’t mean that we
 
had time on our hands, how-

Students participating in the
Argonne Semester live on the
grounds of the laboratory. Students from all schools in the
Associated Colleges of the Midwest are eligible; those selected pay tuition to their home
school and pay room and board
to Argonne. Participants receive up to 15 hours of credit
toward their _graduation requirement. Each student receives $40 a week for a 20-hour
work week.

did mention, however, that

there were spot checks of employees’ cars.
Both returning felt that their
experiences at Argonne have
given them a first-hand under
standing of the demands of research. Both advised any student at all interested in research to look into the program.
