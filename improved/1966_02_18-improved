Senate Discusses Women's Late Penalties;
Proposal Would Allow 75 'Grace Minutes'
A rider attached to the AWS bill turned out to be more con-
Discussion of an AWS Board proposal for a change in late
minutes penalties for women was the main topic oi Wednesday's
Senate meeting The Senate announced without taking a vote when
a quorum count was called.
The nhs “grace minutes" proposal allows all women students
a maximum of 15 late minutes a semester without occurring penalties. After these minutes have been expressed, a woman must
serve the normal one night of hall conﬁcement for every five
late minutes.
Under the AWS proposal, each additional late arrival after the
l5 minutes have been used up will be penalties by three nights at
requirement plus one night for every five minutes at darkness
ass Board president Chris Peterson explained the proposal,
pointing out that “most of the businesses which occur during the
week occur during the first five minutes after the doors are
locked." The idea or the proposal is “to give each woman student
15 minutes as a butter period to account for these accidental latenessest"
provincial than the bill itself. Attached to the proposal as a ”final
comment” it suggests that all but tour of the logged doors be
locked early on weekends. so that they can all he looked promptly
at hours. It also pages the night watching to start his rounds so
that the Main door he the last one looked and be locked exactly
at hours, ‘
According to the AWS Board “such a proposal will reduce excessive paperback for the nightcheck girls and the Women's Primary Court, and will eliminate in more uniform and statement
penalties for darkness.”
The procedure provides for a tile box in the quadrangle office
containing a card for each woman student. The student will sign
in upon late arrival and the nightcheck girl will compression.
Each time a woman is late, She will be told how many or her
15 minutes remain, The night girl will be responsible for this
computation,
focused darkness will not be included in the 15 “grace minutes.”
Death of Father
Brings Withdrawal
The fourth candidate for Student
Government president. Dan Bucks,
announced his withdrawal from the
race yesterday. The withdrawal
was caused by the accidental death
of Bucks' father. Bucks' father died
in a farming accident Thursday

After Bucks' withdrawal, th.

various courses. At one point it

In case you missed it in your waste to turn to the:

one,
If this proposal is being presented in any seriousness I think it is one of the most ill-concerned and outer-step actions that the AWS Board could possibly present. I refer not to the body of the proposal but rather
the ”final comment,” the rider to the bill.
While everyone else who is concerned about women’s hours talks in terms of specializing them, extending them, or even (God save us) elimination them, the
AWS Board seems to be camping bookmarks in an attempt to make a bad rule worse. The AWS Board is
right when it says that its little rule will “eliminate in
more uniform and statement penalties for darkness.”
I suggest that right now is the time for students
who give passing service to the cause of more liberal
women’s hours to go to their Senator’s room and have
a short chat with him. A
very short chat: Vote no
against the AWS Board’s rider. Vote yes for the 15!

Amherst Drops Junior
Who Didn't Take PE
Amherst College has discussed a
junior, Andrew Plnkowilz. for iaii

requirement. The administration
decided upon this action alter Pilikotvitz told the dean that he had
no intention oi fiiliilling his gym
obligation.
Pinkowiiz had already been discussed alter his freshman year
for mailing four subjects, but he
had been restricted after studying
a year in a New York college.
When he returned as a sophomore
for the second term of last year,
he was placed on academic promotion. Pinkowitz had three Se
wesley's of gym left to iiiltili a
that diane, and he received credit
for one of those computers that
spring.
In the first hall ot his junior'
year Pinkowltz did not attend
gym classes and consequently received a letter from the dean involving him that he might be suspended for negligence, He signed
up for gym the next semester but-
after attending a week found that
it cut into his studies too miles'L
(Pinkowitz had raised his accumulative average from 53 to 83,)
Since he was not attending gym
classes, Pinkowilz was discussed
from Amherst. The administration gave as the reason for dis-

that Gi‘iunell students, like our
competitors across the country,

Grinnell we do not experience
real life because we are registered

in this production.

To the Editor:
An educational institution (in

to CREATE that environment
which is most conducted to the
student's intellectual and social
motivation. The critical question
is: What is the nature of that email'onllient? Ann oil' lines (ill her
letter to the editor ill the January
28 issue of the 3&3) expressed
her new that the position which
the college takes. as expressed in
the college catalogue, is a hypo
critical stand; that in reality the
college has not created that environment which is most conducted
to the stated aims of the college
with respect to the development
of what one might call a selfrztctualiZliig personality (see A. H.
Maslow, Motivation and PersonaL

I heartily agree with her stand

her).
There is no doubt that Gl'inneli

over their problems.
Summer research programs are
effectively planned on the War on
Poverty, board oi education, and
city government structure. King

the research, but “it will be up

CIA Has Seen Better concentrations
By BOB HODIERNE
The story was being read by
wire editors of newspapers from
princeton, New Jersey, to l-games,
Oregon, before Grinnell students
even realized that their campus
was “embroiled” in a “protest”
against the U.S.'s “super-spy organization.” the CIA
A harmful of Grinnell’s sometimes active chapter or Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
were sitting on the floor of ARH
while a representative of the CIA
interpreted seven Grinnellians for
prospective jobs The students
held a few signs protecting the
CIA’s intervention in foreign countries
And then the Associated Press
found out.
And then the phone calls started
coming to the College officials,
The Associated Press told the
Sari} they felt at first they were
getting the "rurharound" by the
college when nobody knew anything about the “demonstration.”
 
Soon they realized that new here
were aware of a protest. But pretty soon people found out and the
stories started going out.
Stories went to the AP and
United Press International.
Stories went out to radio sea- ,
tions KIOA, WHO, KRNT, WDI,
and, not least of all, KGRNI
College officials were quickly
hoping that the story would be
used one day in Iowa papers and
on radio stations and forgotten
But behind the power of the wire
services:
A radio
picked it up.
So did one on the East Coast.
And so did a television station
in California.
And then NBC radio used it on
their six o’clock radio “news on
the hour."
And finally the CIA in Washington felt dedicated to make a
statement. In effect they said, sowhat—we’ve seen better demonstrationsr

with campus problems will lead

like the SCSI to develop into a
political party to keep the campus

subsequently arise, future son
elections could be more crucial.
The faculty and administration
should be considered the friends

“Rule changes don’t come merge
1y because a student leader himself expressed a desire for them.
It must he made evident to the
administration that student monitor is serious This will foster
serious communication, and it is
in this new atmosphere that rule
changes can best be expected,"
Among the issues that can be
 
raised are more open rooms. an
generation of women's hours, and
greater automobile privileges.
An example of how he believes
an issue can be raised and presented to the administration is in
regard to more open rooms. thunder would present such a request
in the context of the privacy issue,
with more open rooms as proved
ing the chance for small groups
of students to meet and talk on
tuesday aiternoons. Thus the emphasis would not be on open bedrooms, where it has so often been
displayed.
“We can stay quiet and satisfied and there won’t be any real
noise on campus, but we have to
show the administration that we
want to talk, and they will listen
it serious student support is
shown."
Leadership and personality are
the key characteristics of a good
president, according to thunder.
“The president needs a willingness to get others involved, and
must be the kind of person that
others are willing to work for.
“I welcome ideas from other
people, I don’t have all the answers~nobody does. The more
people get together, the more ideas

has taken the too-many-cookie
