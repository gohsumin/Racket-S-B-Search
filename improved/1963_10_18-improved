degrees and Grinnell
For years Grinnell has been the School of the white
liberal at which Students and faculty have discussed fare
away legislation problems with a detailed air. There
have always been a few metro Students at Gl'shell —
enough to act as a Symbol to Grinnell's libertility.
The lebanon there tire few degrees at Gl‘lllllell is twofolt‘ 1) Few 'errors are well enough prepared to attend
G illness, and 2) few degrees are actually interested in
attending Grilinell.
demonstration Gl'install’s active interest in the civil
rights problem, President Howard R. women center try cuts
lined two proposals to a group of students. The success of
one proposal does not depend upon the other.
The first proposal is for principal to become affiliated with tt Southern leg ~i college and to become closely
connected with the operation of that college. This pros
pitsal is already in the negotiation: stage, and the following possibilities are offered by such it bacterial agreement:
—A program to excluding'e‘students for a semester.
7A program to exchange faculty members for
a year.
—Exclizinge of faculty centuries.
—minimal joint faculty conference.
—initial Joint student conference.
iCLlltlll'all exchanges of student plays, recitals etc.
—Leci.are series conducted by processors of
one school over telephone lines.
—lntercollegiate athletic Competition between
the schools \‘itll each trip being a three or
four day of air. ,
iFlltli year students going into the South to
teach in much the Same fashion Gi'innell’s
Fifth Year Abroad system works.
This proposal started from a recent study President
women made for the United Church of Christ, 2m organization to which Griiinell belongs. As chairman of a summit
tee studying what could be done to help with the education problem in the South, the President worked with the
President of ti Southern leg‘ro college who was various to
indicate Such an agreement with Gl'innell. _
The advantages of such an agreement to the Southern
College would be great, its Grinnell's valuable facilities
would become available to this School. All advantage for
both schools would be that this program would give suites
and degrees the opportunity of forming friendships, of
learning of the cultural differences, and of warning ti
genuine Social education.
President women's second proposal is that criminal
join with three or four other liberal arts colleges of zipprinxinlately equal standing and through a country operated admission. i'et liiliuent office bring degrees and other
priorities to [it e college . The object of the program
it ltd be to bring members of minority groups, some of
whom are not up to the Standards for regular admission
to the college, into the liberal arts college.
The program could be implemented in the following
l1 miller: l) value selected students and give them a Spe-
‘dial summer Session to try to bring their education level
lap to that of the incoming freshmen who have come from
the better high schools; 2) Give these selected freshmen
special controlling and perhaps have them take a light
icolil'se load until they can adjust to the Grinnell Standard.
i In this way Gl’innell would admit perhaps :30 students,
‘mziiiy of whom could not 0 'iginally meet Grinnell‘s entrance
{requirements Through this extra guidance and controlling
(and perhaps through-2m extra year of college), however,
,tliese intelligent but culturally received students could directive an education. Neither for the college nor for the
lspeciztlly admitted students would this be easy, but it would
'b a defining and convertible step in the linked'privilege‘ed’s
‘1 gift for equality.
, Two other colleges have tilieddy joined criminal in lay»
‘lllg‘ the foundation for the Second proposal.
'l‘lit: thinking" behind both these programs is that
Grinnell ‘llollld do its perl to help the metro and all oth«
er minority groups gift for equality. The only weapon
Grililiell has to offer is an ediiczttioli. President women
has discovered. uiioreo or, that Grinuell can not sit and
wait for the few qimli led students come to us—that we
must {:0 out and help train students who can take advantage of the academic excellence Gt niiell has to offer,
that we must go olil‘ and associate with leg 0 colleges
and close the educational ,gap which lies before the
N‘Qg'l'all who is login to gain his rights as a citizen.
We pledge our wllule~liearted support to this two—
wrong’ed program which would make Grinnell a vital in—
document in everything: racial barriers which have long
been the,limited states' domestic eye-more. For months we,
have pleased for a chance to play a part in drama which
has involved in the U. S. over the past few yeti Now

The gas laser and its possible‘
uses in the fields of medicine
and communications were the
subjects ot a lecture and designs‘

brother, Ji~., last Friday evening

in Roberts Theatre. i .
brother is chairman oi Lhci
board of General Telephone and
Electronic: Laboratories, Inc.
In the demonstration, brother
used a heliumencon laser in|
which the elections of the her'
um items are excited by a light'
beam. when these elections return to a lower energy level
they girl up quanta of energy,
whioii in turn calculate the‘
elections or the neon items to
higher energy levels When
these elections fall back, they>
give off quanta or light which'
are in phase and therefore at
higher intensity than the source
The parallel laser rays are
capable ot producing teams oi
highly consolidated l i g h t
which can be used in medical
work. The laser is presently
used in medical surgery and i
for the treatment oi certain
skin comments.
To illustrate the use of the
laser in communications, prot»:
her broadcast a tape recording:
on a laser beam to a receiverand ainpiiiier. When the laser
beam was blocked. the anipir
tier received no signals and the
sound stopped.
brother explained that to have
intelligence superimposed on a
beam, the light must be ordered; the laser produces a con
current, ordered beam. turtle..t
since the amount of information‘
a beam can carry varies r'ircetiy with the frequency o: the,
