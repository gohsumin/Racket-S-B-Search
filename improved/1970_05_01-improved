Students Vo+e To Reject
Judicial Council Proposal
By Greg further
Students rejected an agents
merit to the SGA Constitution
concerning the Judicial Council
Article by a narrow margin
Monday noon in the lunch lines. A
positive vote of so per cent was
needed for approval; but out of
512 balloon, 302 (59 per Cent) Voted
in favor, eight short of the
number necessary for approval.
Only 123 students (25 per cent of
those voting) opposed the
proposal, but the 75 assumptions
and seven unmarked balloon
provided the margin of defeat.
The voting followed a KDIC
editorial opposite the amend
event and trying the defeat of the
proposal. The editorial attacked
seven aspects of the proposal: (1)
the limit of 20 persons at open
hearings, (2) a section of the bill
of rights which allows entrance
into student rooms, (a) hall
judicial councils remaining
essentially the same as before,
(4) one section which left
dependence open to “double
jeopardy,” (5) the President‘s
veto power over judicial
decisions, (6) one section of the
amendment (had-ll which are
years to be contradictory, and t7)
the sloppiness and redundancy of
the entire amendment.
Tuesday night, the Senate,
which had previously approved
the amendment, deleted the
section limiting attendance at
open hearings and voted to
republic the proposal to
references. A motion to delete
the section allowing double
jeopardy was detected
unanimously on the grounds that
no parallel could be made be
green judicial councils and the
U.S. court system and that
therefore the objectives were
invalid,
Bill Thomas and Greg Vranicar
deferred the amendment against
the other KDIC attacks. Dealing
with the second objective above,
they said that entrance into
student rooms is already college
procedure and that at times it is

Dean’s Office And Senate Committee
Reveal Plans For Residence calls
Several major changes have
been made in the residence calls
for next year, resulting in a wider
number of options for students,
particularly with respect to cold balls, The changes were made
by the Student means office in
cooperation with the Housing
Committee of the Student Senate
in response to the results of a
questionnaire distributed by the
Committee to residents of Loose
and counter and all other stud
cents except seniors.
Next year, Loose Hall, which
has been co-ed by floors this year,
will be cold by rooms The
rooms will not be exactly albert
rating, but there will be approach
lately the same number of men
and women on each floor, spread
throughout the entire floor,
Cleveland and Langan calls
will both be made card by floor.
Basement and second floor in
Cleveland will be women and
first and third men, In Langan,
first and second will be women
and Basement and third men.
These arrangements were made
to keep the number of bed spaces
available and the number of
singles available equal {or both
men and women
In addition to me above
changes, counter Hall will re
main could by wings, and Smith
will become a men’s hall and
liable womens,
Mrs, Alice Low, Dean of
Students, told the SKIS that the
changes were made in record
once with the belief that “it is
very important to maintain a
variety of living styles on cam
put." and the questionnaire
calculated by the Student
Housing Committee indicated
that there was a desire for more
Co~ed calls.
Freshmen will be assigned to
all calls on campus; they will be
sent a letter explaining the are
tcrnatives, and they will have a
chance to indicate their preferences.
For returning upperclassmen,
number drawings were held
Thursday night, and room select
tions will be made Saturday.
Mrs. Low said that the forms»
tony arrangement planned for
next year was not planned as a
permanent one, and that she
thinks that ”the 1' ng situation
and use of directories should be
evaluated each year."

Requirements
Fast on the feels of the so-called “tests proposal"
comes the proposal to english individual course requirements. The question is currently at the additional level,
and, no doubt, will be presented to the faculty before
long. It seems almost charitable that the most universal
requirement, the Humanities course, will be widely
related. We present that the arguments for or against
requirements in principle may be mostly argued in the
specific case of the Humanities course. Let us then,
set forth some of the arguments against a required
Humanities course. .
The Humanities course requires a large faculty, some
of whom recent teaching a course in which they are
not primarily interested. For this reason some faculty
teach the course half-quarterly, thus hourly. Students
who are required to take a course which does not interest them waste time which might be more profitably
spent. On the other hand, if anyone were interested
in Humanities he would not need to be required to take
the course. He would do so voluntarily. The combination
of a disinterested teacher and a number of disinterested
students makes for a very poor course.
Further, the administration does not know the needs
and interests of each student and so is not a proper
judge of what courses any student might need to pursue
his educational goal. Hence, a required Humanities
course is indiscriminately adjust. A good controlling
system would direct students to courses which fit their
needs. Thus, a Humanities course may be recommended or it may not depending on the individual.
These arguments, we think, must be forestry met
by anyone depending the Humanities course requirement. They may be answered as follows:
It is true that some faculty would prefer not to teach
a Humanities course. It is also true that some faculty
would prefer not to teach introductory courses, other
lower level courses, and courses in which they are
not currently interested. They may still teach these
courses well. In short, a faculty members personal
preferences are important, but not essential to his doing
a good job. Good teachers will teach the Humanities
course well, bad teachers will teach it hourly.
it is also true that a number of students are not interested in Humanities when they enter the course and
are not interested in Humanities when they leave the
course. We have, however, on too many occasions
taken courses where almost everyone in the course
was there voluntarily. And in these courses we have
seen interest that was something less than overwhelming. We admit that there are a certain few students,
the very great ones and the very poor oneTt'or whom
requirements are topless, They do not need them. For
the most part. however, this College deals with students
who are neither very great nor very poor, And it is
precisely these people who can learn most from good
teachers and benefit most from required courses.
The administration certainly does not claim to know
each student’s personal needs. They are, though, justin
find in assuming some simulation in the students. After
all, the liberal arts college presents to offer a fairly
specific kind of education, different from, say, a
technical school. Anyone who has had any contact with
a technical school knows the large number of required
courses these institutions demand of their students.
It is true that a technical school is more “fact oriented”
than a liberal arts college, but if a liberal arts education
is a goal which means anything at all, then it would »
seem to be the case that there are certain desirable
means to thatgoal.
A good controlling system, is. of course, highly desire
Friday. May i. i970
 
able. And as one well respected faculty member says,
“if you can get a good student and a good teacher together, you don’t need requirements." Now, no one
seems to know how to develop a good controlling system
among the faculty nor exactly how to bring the good
student and the good teacher together. By excluding
the Humanities requirement we reduce the number
of students taking Humanities, and so limit the contact
which the greatest number of students will have with
the greatest diversity of courses. Thus, we lesson the
possibilities for contrast between good students and
good teachers.
It is not enough simply to refuse the arguments
against the Humanities requirement. One must, it
seems, have positive reasons for keeping what we
already have. There is a very old argument, but still
a very good one, for this,
The liberal arts college is primarily concerned with
teaching students a method or a number of methods
for learning. The most important thing the college can
do is to give the student the best tools for learning,
such as the techniques of analysis, synthesis, etc. However, the method must have matter on which to work,
or else it will be like a wheel turning nothing. Now
presumably the matter on which we work is contained
largely in the texts taught in the courses. We think
it fairly obvious that it is wise, both pedagogically
and philosophically, to use the best matter available.
One of the purposes of the Humanities course is to
teach the method by means of the literature which
has been recognized as best by a large number of men
over a long period of time. If we require that the best
methods be taught, it seems that we should require
the best material be taught, specifically in the case
of Humanities.
If the proposal to eliminate requirements is adopted,
we do not anticipate the device of excellent education
at Grinnell College. We expect only its definition.
It seems to us, though, that we ought to try to make
the College better rather than create the conditions
in which it will become worse, For these reasons, we
believe that the required Humanities course, and by
extension, requirements in general, ought to be retained.

involved with this proposal
since its exception, plans to fill
no more than approximately
forty of the 106 spaces in Younlter title black students. Dean'
combo said that black students
will be scattered throughout all
the floors in counter.
The plan is optional for all
black students. It is the outgrowth of an earlier proposal
by the Concerned Black Students (CBS) for an all-black
floor, and the final plan was
decided on just last Monday.
The original proposal by
CBS, an all~black floor, was
sent to the Student Housing
Committee appointed by the
Student Senate last month, It
contained a number of reasons
for the need for a living situation which would provide an
“atmosphere that would promote better adjustment to Grinnell by black freshmen."
The Housing Committee her
forced the proposal, with their
approval, to the Student means
office. Last Saturday. Dean

Both suggest and combo felt
that the request for an all-black

reasons given for the need for
some kind of special orientation for black students were.

lee Saturday tilternoon, Dean
combo met with groups of
black students and they discussed alternative proposals.
Tile plan was the major topic
of discussion at o CBS meeting
Sunday night at the Black Cut
titrat llousc, a meeting which
listed almost seven hours. It
was at this meeting that CBS
recorded on the plan as it now
stands,
Dean combo, who was at
that meeting, said that a number of alternatives was discussed, including simply in
creating the current cluster
arrangements, but that the proposal which was eventually decided on — the counter proposal —— seemed to best meet
the goal of helping freshmen
black students adjust academy
icaily and normally to the col»
legs.
Preslclent suggest made the
decision to accept this proposal
Monday because he ten it was
the best of the alternatives.
scan combo met with the Student Affairs Committee Monday afternoon and informed
them of the decision.
Those who were involved in
circulation it hope that the
counters Plan will deal effectively with what President suggest called “the Very special
problems in social and academy
IC orientation" on the part or
black students. According to
Dean combo, it is :l cultural
shock for black students who
have grown up in an all black
community to come into an all
white community and college
and be able to function as
students immediately, and the
counter Plan will be important
in helping incoming black freshmen ”make lt” in their first
semester.
Dean combo Said that much
thought went into the proposal
on the part of all those involved in making it, especially
the Concerned Black Students.
”it is not a capricious type
or proposal," he said.
president chgett feels that
the plan is in line with the policy the Trustees decided on
alter their special meeting
with black students in May or
last year in Chicago. Thc opening sentence of the policy
statement that came out of that
meeting reads, “Grinncll Cole

“And that the faculty im»

modification of the advisory
system to make it appropriate for
its new importance.
"Proposal B: That the creditiail option be extended to all
students with the provision that
two courses may be taken each
semester on this basis, but with
credltrfall not allowed in the
major ﬁend except in such special
cases as have been previously
approved."
According to Mr, slots'enter
there is a very good reason for
doing something about the
present requirements. “It is most
difficult for a student to eur
resident with courses in enough
areas early in his career so that
he can try out subjects in which
he might want to major,” said
Clotfelter. Mr, Clotfelter also
listed three reasons why he
thought his proposal would be a
good step for the College to take.
First, the rationale - for
requiring certain courses was to
be sure that all students had an
introduction to many different
Residence
current
areas of learning. Clotielter
pointed out that most Students
now come from high school with a
good introduction to most of the
areas in which Courses are
presently required,
The proposed change would
likely improve the attitude of
students toward their courses,
because they would be taking
courses they felt they ought to
take rather allan courses they
had to take. it would be the task
of the advisor to pursuant his
advisors to take this or that
course
Finally, the advisory system
would be improved. Advisor and
student would have to carefully
work out the program of study for
each individual student; hence,
there would be more Contact be
green advisor and advised.
The proposal was referred by
the Executive Council to the Educational Policy Committees of
the three Divisions. Their recommendations were to be discussed
and after upon by the Divisions.
According to Mr. harley,
Philosophy. the Social Studies
Division agrees overwhelmingly
that the Clotielter proposal would
not damage any- or the report
meets in the Division if it were
enabled. Mr, harley believes
that most oi the departments in
the division favor a reduction in
the requirements, although the
question was not put at the

SCARLET AND BLACK
meeting There is a consensus
that if such a proposal is enabled,
faculty members will have to do a
much better job oi advisory
students than they are doing at
the present time. harley felt that
the proposal is not likely to go
through this year, partly because
the staff has already been hired
for next year based upon an
expected demand for courses,
and partly because many
questions still remain. in
harley’s opinion, “the key
question is: What are the re
apartments for a good
education?”
The science Division has
decided not to consider the slot»
filter proposal this year, according to Mr. belong, Biology.
belong also said that it would be
Very difficult to estimate the
effect that the appointment of requirements would have on the
Biology Department. He did say
that many students who would
not have taken the course if it had
not been required have nevertheless said they felt it was a worthwhile course. Mr. Clotfelter said
that he believed there would be
little ctlec't on the total enrollr
ment in the science division. He
said that certain changes could
be made in the present Science ff
course (for instance, two sections
could be offered, one with lab and
one without) to make the courses
more attractive to students and
to commerce faculty time. Stur
cents could be personnel to take

reasons for trying to get a broad
education. Said Clotfelter, ”I
believe that most Grinnell
students are mature enough that
they would want to take difficult
courses, even in subjects outside
the area of their immediate ins
tercst.”
Mr. Foster, English, believes
that the Humanities Division is
overwhelmingly opposed to the
proposal as it now stands. He felt
that the language departments
and perhaps some oi the fine arts
departments would be decreased
in size. The EPC did recommend
a compromise proposal by Miss
Noble, Spanish, which would require a certain distribution of
courses. According to Foster, the
Division is now considering two
questions: 1. whether or not to
recommend the Noble proposal to
the Executive Council and 2.
whether to refer the decision on
this matter until next year, when
the Divisions can more carefully
consider all the alternatives.
The proposal offered by Miss
Noble would set the following requireinents:
”1. Completion of 124 credits
with an overall cumulative
grade point average of 2.0.
“2. Completion of at least 32 but
not more than 48 credits in a
major field.
“3. Completion of a distribution
requirement oi at least 28 credits

restrictions are placed on this
procedure in the Constitution,
students will have no protection
at all from illegal instances. In
answer to the third point, they
said that the main christ of the
proposal was to provide “code
sistellcy and coordination"
between hall judicial councils.
Previously, these councils had
never been officially defined
campusewide.
The birth point is a common
objective to student government
proposals; but Bill Thomas
pointed out that because the
trustees have declared that the
president has the final say in all
college affairs, students have no
say in the matter. Finally, Bill
and Greg stated that the apparent inconsistency in section ASH does not exist upon close
examination. As for sloppiness
and redundancy in the proposal,
each student will have to decide
for himself how valid and how
important that criticism is.

it is quite another thing to drag

Much less the breaks, for a

There are, in fact many different

I saw it in left field (and the bench after commitment two errors)
it looked like Read was out—reached by the redoubtable Dave Brown
and the Homes crew, with the Machine striking out and making
errors.
barnes got 12 runs, and Read
struggled for a or 4, which
should give barnes a win. How
ever, it seems that Al raymond was illegal (which inn't
a very nice thing to say about
him), so Read has filed a protest. At last report, both sides
had presented non-negotiable
demands, and barnes has lined
up Dave forward to talk to
Read for them. No details of
a settlement will be released
for some time, so until further
notice, Clark is in first place.
Both Read and barnes followed
that game with losses, Read
