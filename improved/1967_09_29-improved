ALTERNATING DORMS. N0 OPENS, SAYS LEGGETT
By ANDY ISAACS
' President Leggeti s u n d a y
night asked the college community to consider the possibility
of a south campus of understand men and Women and a
similar north campus of upperclass men and women, and of
giving upperclass students the
choice between living on campus, subject to college social
regulations, or living on campus under the jurisdiction of
their landlord and the city.
The president invited “ordered study and response to my
suggestions for possible
change” and called for other
proposals from both students
and faculty. He expressed hope
that he could present ﬁnfl recommendations to the trustees
by early Spring, and begin a
new arrangement by next Fall.
suggest noted three patient
difficulties with the present
system:
(1) There is no provision for
a progressive withdrawal oi
college authority as students
advance through their undergraduate years.
(2) The separation of men
and Women onto different computer exhibits natural and easy
meeting oi the sites.
(3) Most students are forced
into one incredible style of living.
He suggested that, should his
proposal be adopted, the college recognize irankly that understand residence calls would
have more supervision than upperclass calls, and that lt follow
a conscious policy of submitting
more upperclass students to
live off campus.
suggest noted of his suggestion “These are only nations,
but they may introduce us to
ways we can create an environment that 1 its the Col«
legs’s responsibility to what it
can actually be responsible for
and gives students not simply
the option of staying here or
leaving but the several options
oi living in differently organized residence calls under var—
ious college regulations or off
the campus and away from institutional social functions completely."
The president made clear
that he opposed the extension of
open rooms now as strongly as
ever, ”I do not believe in the
extension of ‘open rooms,’ and
some of the reasons for my be
lies are in line with my dissatlsiaction with the hall system
in general. A program of computational use of directory rooms
emphasizes the single way of
living already imposed unfortunately here on most students.
At the same time it gives rise
to social expectations and configurations that not all student!
are prepared to meet and seriously interfaces with the College's responsibilities for the
mental health of all students.
“institutional restrictions of
computational use of directory
rooms are designed to help preserve the emotional possibilities
of all Students, not to district
individual students in what
choices they should make in
their out-ofecollege life. In suite
of the dissatisfaction of the pro—
parents of ‘sexual freedom,’
(quotes his) the College is in
no position to console such expression of freedom in the context of directory living, and it
sees no hypocrisy in saying so."
Further expression his dissatisfaction with Grinnell’s style of
living. “This is a very unsimpls
subject; it is really a cluster
oi problems, chief among which
are two Circumstances I think
all of us find profoundly integrating: first, a hall governmental system whose elected
officials are often caught in the

for the small option ot offecampus living) any real choice

‘ CAMP-IN BRAVES GOLD
Last Saturday night, Grinnell
had a non - social - calendar
event. The event was filled as
A “Camp-Out," and students
are attempted by such signs as
‘Bring your own bolt". The idea
was originally by Gates sophomore Tom Th 0 m a 5, who
thought that the idea was collectible at the time.
The idea came to the attend
tion at the treatments oi Gates
and watson, Steve MacDuwell
and Mel Thompson, wllo
thought it might be a good
Idea.
They brought it to the attention of Miss center, program
director of the College, who also thought it was a good idea.
The C. of HP. agreed, although
some members of the Council
primarily expressed the opinion
that it might cause trouble.
Machwell and Thompson realized that the event would
have to occur within a very
short time, before the weather
became cold. After involving
Dean Thompson and receiving
no objective from him, the two
treatments processed w i t h
plans.
About a week before the
“Camp - Out," announcements
appeared, which Gates President Thompson, looking back,
described as “gross."
Shortly before the “CampOut,” the two treatments
were informed that the
College could not place the e«

nor could it support the event
in any way with College equal«

By PAUL NACHMAN
Ray Horn's presentation oi a
concrete proposal for an open

for freshman highlighted Wed<
nasdaq’s Senate meeting.
Drawn up by an artificial
committee in watson that has
been meeting regularly for a
week, the paper calls for noon
to midnight opens on Sunday
through Friday and noon to 1
am. on Saturday.
The committee further sun-
planned that the College would
never have allowed the “CampOut" to occur, had it realized
exactly what was planned. He
admitted the administration
was to blame in not determining corner what was planned.
He said the College “can’t support all night activities", further stating that to some people, it “had an everyone of so—
dial rules involvement."
Other objectives were noise
from the band, and the involvement or all of North Campus, whether other calls wishes
to participate or not.
According to Dean Thompson, the same type of event will
not occur again,
The occasion was attended
by a maximum of about two
hundred people at its high point
at twelve o’clock.
From then on, despite a reading confirm in the middle of
Mac Field, and movies which
showed until two in the morning, the cold drove most of the
participants away.

ended, only five couples were
left to gather around the dying

with the compilation that at
least 3 hours per day be retained."
Criticized for the limited
scope of the committee’s proposal, Horn responded, “We re<
alfred we women't covering all
the problems, but nobody else
on campus did anything on
this We did It’s something.”
”This is the first concrete
proposal regarding open forms
to go through student governmental channels since 1962,”
he explained “Once it has been
sent out to the student body,
we’ll have some facts and figures to talk about. We’ll get
some real numbers for a
change."
Actual figures, Horn noted,
will force the administration to
be more specific than they
have been previously about no
sections they may have to increased opens. In the past, he
explained, the means have cited
other schools' unhappy experiences with specialized rules but
have produced no specific,
written evidence to support
their conventions.

LEGGETT’S SPEECH
We wanted for two years for President suggest to make a
definition statement on student like. Sunday at the open Senate
meeting the president ended the waiting with a healthy and broadbased commentary on campus living.
Immediate student reaction must be favorites. Students who
are willing to work within established channels to discuss the prior
items oi Grinnell will know the president’s position on Various
matters. Students who real that the college is moving too slowly
toward rule discrimination can make reaction to the president’s
more conservative ideas a relating cry for resolutions And students
who are merely curious to know What our Chief administrator has
to say about campus life are regarded with a colorado speech.
The prospect of having men and women on both computer
meets with our approval. It would be a first step in the association
of the exhibitions on this campus about informal computational ac»
tivity, and would further more related relationships between the
sites.
The idea of separation students by class, however, is iii~con«
ceivedi Although class forms would keep upperclassmen from choosing sophomoric and anti-intellectual customs on Ireshmen, they
would also prohibit the natural contact between customers and
more experienced students that leads to academic and social
guidance and inspiration,
Living in a freshman form with upperclass advisors could be
limited to New Student Days, when entering students, although
glad to have ii new days of their own on campus, and group leaders
to help them get settled, are various to see what college life is
really like. Granted, upperclnssmen might be the advisors. but
the student taking the job will, by Virtue of his position, be dinercnt from other upperclassmeu. The naturalness of relationships
between the sites which is sought in mixing the computer would
be lost between the classes with separate class dormsi
Our greatest dissatisfaction is with President suggest’s position
on open forms. Restrictions imposed by the car rule and by iowa
weather leave the directory room as the only place for computational privacy, or course, the study rooms and dining rooms of
the Forum are available, but the “transparent” contains and stories decor make them unappealing. And dining rooms must be reserved in advance, describing the spontaneity and casualness that
is supposedly being sought in campus social life.
It seems that most of the damage to the “ national possibilities" or students processing “broken illegal vi king” is a result
of the conflict between reasonable action and college rules, rather
than the functioning of the action. If open form hours were extended greatly (granted there must be limits imposed by our present residence hall pattern of two students per room), it is our convention that visiting would become more natural and informal,
that it would involve groups rather than just couples, that the
clandestine sexual ringtones would be diminished, and that its
acceptance by non-participating hall members would be without.
reasonable objectives
Hopefully, the president’s speech will also remind pepople that
changes need not be forever in the planning stages. suggest wants
to implement some DI the changes next Fall. II we Want to have
a voice in these changes, we must act now. engagement would be

EQUALITY
OF THE SEXES
To the Editor:
A certain amount of flexibility is desirable, but inconsistencies in a legal system ought
to be decided. The school has
partially eliminated the double
standard by its withdrawal of
women’s hours, but one Can<
not say that tit school has
adopted as its wifi a] policy the
equality oi the sites.
The greatest inequality of
which I am aware is in the
p h y sic a1 education require
meets. Men are required to
take both intramural competition and a qualifying course in
physical fitness, requirements
that do not exist for female
students.
if Grinneil College wishes to
appear as a truly just institution, it will have to disciplines
this inconsistency either by the
elimination of the requirements
for men. their opposition upon
the women, or the reinstltutlon
of women’s hours.

THE MGlIllTAIN OR
THE llALE
By PAUL JONES
There is a great deal of difference between being called wrong
and being proved wrong. This is the conclusion to which I came
after studying Ron Steinhorn's student opinion in last week’s
son. Rather than merely call him wrong in tue, 1 am willing to
continue the needed discussion by attempting to prove his analysis
of ‘rule philosophy’ to be packing in many reflects, and unjustifiable in others
At the same time that I may not be cognitive of the multiﬁnation and objectives of social reform, steinhorn and many others
are also not cognitive oi the means, i.e., the means from justltica<
tion to objectives. And it one does not know how to get where he
wishes to go, how can he know exactly where he will end up?
The fact or the matter is that my point of view was directed
primarily at means, not certification or objectives. If i did not
reel that there were both certification and proper objectives, I
would say so i, too, admit that the administration has not pm
dated a po on based on returned right, but, proudly, one on
authorization right.
But again, let us not bypass the chance to extract this read
money right it at all possible. And the proper objectives are obvious: to achieve a returned balance of thought and action among
all of the par . oi the community. Is there not, then, a difference
between having the private to ask for and want, and having the
private to expect, a statement of policy? For there are many,
instances when reason has been mistakes for private.
Again, there seems to be little emphasis placed on developing
returned means; which is it to be: principles before rules or rules
before principles? That the administration's 'actions seem to be
excellent’ on the basis oi ‘sporadic and inconsistent’ rule en.
agreement is not proof that the administration cannon effectively
efforts rules, or indeed, that they do not have the right to one
force miles; but, rather, this proven only that their actions do not
seem to be based on principles. it is not that these actions are
necessarily removal or identical, but that they seem to be floral
0r non-ethical.
It is a instant error to estate Rousseau’s concept or ‘government’ with the ‘academic community’. it is one extreme to
Say that Grinnell is not the real world, for it certainly is real; but
it is another and just as variable extreme to say that the makeup
of this community is identical with every other type or comment.
ty including Rousseau’s ideal community based on social contract.
The academic community is different; it requires a type of
hierarchy, an academic hierarchy, but not the political structures
or which Rousseau speaks, This being the case, it is a miseappliu
nation of principles to use Rousseau’s philosophy in respect to
‘rule philosophy' at Grinnell. And again, there were three river.
ent uses of 'community' evidenced in the article, all in reference
to Grinnell College, but at the same time, all conﬂacting images.
It is necessary and good to realize that Grinnell is primarily an
academic community, and that there is a difference between an
academic, social, or political community.
Perhaps, ultimately, the students are the ‘only ones able to
legitimately exercise such a governing power over themselves'.
But the ability to handle such responsibilities detailed in 50foreign power is also a criterion of legitimate in an academic community. To make this point clear and also to conclude, I also will
quote from Rousseau, and perhaps with a bit more relevance:
As soon as a man attacks the age of reason he becomes
his own master, because he alone can judge of What will
best assure him his continued existence (Chapter 1, Book
II).
Remember the ‘as soon as‘ and how it is relevant to the meaning oi ‘academic community’.
 
even understand the vocabulary
oi their assumed profession.
And yet it is their catholic
vault that they are capable of
making their own rules. One is
reminder or the poster put up
last week in the campus post
office, in which the GSM asks
“Who decided principles?” As
it principles were decided!

I’d like to enter another complaint . . . on the books.
Remembering a line from one of John Ciardi’s pl]
it easy to draw a parallel with and for my “rendered

“Sir," said the spectacled skeletal lady back at the

You lead from my shelter or not at all.
Go look for themselves: there are no bookstores. . . '
At least there are no other bookstores, and rm getting just a
little tired of a trusts monopolistic force being exercises on my
choice of reading — and for that matter writing — material.
And so, this week. I’m not sure whether l'm taking a sideswipe at the bookstore, the library, or the faculty. But i hope however is responsible for the problem will get the idea.
Let's be more specific. Okay, you — a Grinnell sophomore or
junior or whatever e have had a book recommended to you by
your Physical Anthropology professor, namely African Genesis by
Robert orders, a popular, anthropomorphic, almost-empirical seminovel on Australoplthicine manrapes.
You go over to Carnegie basement. Yes, they have one (but
only one) copy of the book — Price, 31.95.
The same book, unexpurgeted and unabridged, is also out for
95 cents. Why does the bookstore stock the more expensive copy?
Why does it stock only higher grade. ,higher priced typing
paper?
Okay, you say, but you don't have to buy African Genesis; it’s
only recommended reading. And besides, if you are the lucky one
to get to the library first — before the other 35 in your third anthm
class 7 you're all right,
tonight, you are taking 19th Century Russian Literature.
logos's Dead souls is required reading a Price $2.45 in a Modern
Library edition, The same book — in the same translation and unabridged and, of course, unexpurguted ~— is available for 75 cents
In, I believe, a signed Classic edition.
So why do we get stuck for $1.70 more than we might have
paid?
Why does a III-cent box of cleaner cost 39 cents in namibia
basement?
of course, ii materialist bookstore is not all to blame, Al
Sam Wassom, head of the bookstore, is the first to point out: “I
only order what the processors tell me.”
But some faculty members, it seems, don‘t know much about
books or student ﬁcancer.
A seminar in Press AS A Social Instrument course this semester has a $5.95 history of mass media as a required text. Reading
the entire book was the first assignment,
But after the class finished it, the good professor emphasized
it was “merely interesting as history and not very important"
and that the class would have no further use for in
So why buy it? Couldn‘t the four members of the class have
followed one subtle-placed reserve copy at the nursing desk? Sir,
I don't have six dollars to throw around.
Grinnell literature, history, and historical studies courses are
tutorials for requiring authorities well over two hundred pages
in length and then designing a single twenty-page article and
nothing else from them all semester.
Couple these didﬁculture with a linda whose collections in
almost every area are constantly being on red as inadequate by
faculty members; a faculty that hash’t noticed that students are
not all Diamond Jim grades; and a privatelyowned bookstom
with no competition in the town, and you have a problem.
And, studies. you have another problem.
But it's not my problem, is it? i just point out what i see
.very week and get my picks watching you when you never do
anything about it.
Of course, there is something you can do about it. Your student

and you might serve on it . . . if you're not too busy earning cash

by AL CLOUD,

We are not pleased with the
content oi the speech President
suggest delivered to the open
Senate meeting on S u n d a y,
September 24. We appreciate
his stated intention of pmvnk—
ing student thought and action
on life at Grinnell College in
general. and the nature of the
residence calls in particular.
However, several of his suggestions for change will, in our
opinion, regard the development
of an intellectually and continually mature student body.
Mr. suggest suggests a
“South Campus of understand
men and women, and a North
Campus 01 upperclass men and
women in a similar arrangement." This is perhaps the
single most nbhorent idea of
the speech. To quote the report
of the Ad doc Committee,
“Recommendations containing
to the residence calls,” presented to President suggest on
May 12, 1966:
“That freshmen entering
Grinnell College under the
above stated plan, not be
delayed a full year in segregated freshmen housing,
but become subject to the
influences of the far greater variety of persons and
academic disciplines than
could be informed through
any selective process of
junior . senior bestsellers.
We believe that the more
realistic approach to fresh
men is through the counsel<
line of freshmen when ex<
based to those influences in
the present system. We consider that it is unrealistic
to believe that negative in<
sciences can be decided for
freshmen by placing them
in separate references."
Though Mr. suggest now
finds it necessary to discount
the findings of this committee,
we would like to point But that

the drugs used and caused by
college students" and to “express the attitude of Grinnell

in addition, the statement old

A STUDENT O’PINION
HELP! THE PARANOIDS ARE AFTER ME
By JIM RUDOLPH
(I write this with the hope of
continuing discussion of a proc
let raised by Paul Jones in
“The containers of the Long
Distance Runner.")
The rumors so widely calculated last Tuesday night concerning the existence of ﬁve
(six, twenty, who knows how
many) names men on the Grin—
well campus gave birth to profile activity by a large portion
at the college community.
The switzerland was easier
than on any past Thanksgiving,
make-shift Paul several were
running ibm house to house to
inform the students of these
m 05 t enhanced guests, and
these students were ranking
their trains for new and better
riding places. (Let's face it,
the students, the means, and the
march know that there is a lot
at grass on this, as well as every other campus in the nation
this year.)
Paranoia seems to be a common state of mind on the Grinnell campus this year (eg.
ie a rs of administrative compression of student involvement
in corporation, tears that one
of the new resident advisors is
making his living by being no
informed to the means, etc).
What is the cause at this state
of paranoia which seems to
prague Grinneli College students?
Living on the west coast this
summer, I encountered a similar phenomenon among the
new baptist and nipple “move
meets." This fear was not
merely the natural year, that
at being posted, but spread tar
and wide into almost every aspect of politics and human re«
nations.
Paranoia is the but oi the
“don’t trust anyone over this<
teen" ethic, the Communications Company publications oi
the fingers, and of other publications such as Ramparts,
whose editors think that their
child's youth rellovvship group
is being subsidiary by the CIA,
Paranoia is evidenced in the
Dean's Office latest marketplace, Student Use at Drugs,
when the drug phenomenon is
referred to as a “problem” by
its authors.
The problem i wish to discuss
is a common enough one to
Grinnell people, but its components by no means powers
its importance it is communication. What is the cause of
this paranoia, ultimately, but a
misunderstanding due to a lack
of communication?
What is the cause oi the
many-sides paranoia involved
in the drug Scene but a misinformed body of lawmakers
writing archive and adjust
marijuana laws, the undertake
extent of the enforcement of
these laws, and the magnitude
of rumors concerning the effects oi grass which rise out of
misinformed
sources?
I congratulate the means on
their statement concerning
their elllorcelrlent ot drug laws
on campus, yet was approved at
their insurance concerning the
actual effects at these drugs.
Their knowledge is skin to that
oi the producers of the incredible gross, sensationalist click,
The Weird World of LSD—Ii
movie which portrait every
trip as a summer during which
man sees his interest deathwish as real.
If this communication, lie.
the dean’s statement, is to receive national attention, 1
should think that the means
would want to do more than
reveal their insurance on the
subject oi drug clients, (Maybe communication here involves burlington the means?)
What are these fears concerning American rehabilitation turning into a police state,
controlled by our gestapo, the
CIA, except a lack oi communication between governmental institutions and the people they supposedly represent?
Wllo knows what the CIA is
doing? Who knows what is has<
peeing in diet Nam? who controls mass communication in
this country?
Perhaps the reason students
today are doing their damnedest
to avoid the limit ill not that

conduct dangerous and harmful to himself and others and
therefore subject to separation
from the college.
It is undeniable that certain
drugs are dangerous. Some
relatives, stimulants and hallucigens are cited as examples.
But it is widely agreed by students that these do not constitute the “drug problem" at
Grinnell. in any case, it would
seem a rather intimate policy

it is the use or marijuana, I

the means’ concern, and therefore it is somewhat displaying
to deal with this drug in the

consider the “facts” presented
about marijuana:

(2) it is cheap and demand

(3) it has a characteristic

that individuals will not turn to

The means are at another
opinion. Students, they suggest,

oi drama, excitement or myth"
about pot. “Drug instrumentation or use or abuse is sometimes undertaken as a means

GRAY MATTER
By BILL GRAY
Fall is now facing from Grinnell but since it is difficult to contents 55 football games in the two weeks nature allows us for
autumn, l. M. sports continue in the cold, draw days which precise
true winter.
Last week was the first in which the form chart took a beat.
ingr East beat South, West beat East (in the annual Goldfish
Bowl), watson beat West and South beat Smith. All of this
proven nothing, of course, except that if one follows this typically,
. M. football turns out to be nothing more than a syllngistic flat
In the minds of North Campus athletes.
An I, M. board meeting was held this week and it was decided
to keep flag football, raise the penalty for failing to reserve assigned games to 20 points, eliminate any sort of cheats in the
football games and think about constitution I. M. Wrestling.
None of this is likely to make the New York "times but it’s the
best I can do in a rather mandate week of sports (besides, it's
hard to make things exciting when you don't get to have an artist
draw for you or you‘re forced to remain within the sounds of
defence).
In order to take advantage of the fall weather, the South
Campus (to think that next year that term will be meaningless,
high) l. M. program is deeply embroiled in acid softball wars.
Assuming the sun comes out again, i will attend one of the
affairs and bring back a stirringly description report (i wonder if
it’s anything like the sweatshirt relay?).
SCARLET AND BLACK

BUT FIERCE
By JEFF SCHECK‘I‘ER
As the variety Pioneers are
fighting for victorian. the freshmen football team is getting
ready for their first game. in
a recent interview. Coach John
deutsch said that he had a
strong and highly enthusiastic
squad.
Several s e r i o u 5 problems,
however, market the outlook
for a successful season. Coach
deutsch acknowledged that a
lack of depth will prove to be
a major problem. With only
twenty players on the squad,
many team members will be
forced to play offense and defense. Another serious problem
is the independence of the fairfield, Only quarterback cal-y
Johnson, who played for Grinnell High School. has adequate
game experience.
Coach deutsch continues to
hold high hopes for the team.
The line is particularly well
certified and is answered by two
220 pound tickets. Another positive factor for the team is the
running of iuilbacir Roy Lewis,
The freshmen play against
Cornell, Knox and cos. Their
first game will be on October
12 at Cornell.

Last Saturday was the ocean«
ion of a double defeat for the
Pioneers and one can be added
since. The football team lost to
st. Olaf 28-20 and the cross
country team lost to the Oles
2629 last Saturday. This tuesday the barriers lost to the diversity of Northern iowa, 1712.
The first selection minutes
of the sixth minute gridiron
battle were decision for the top
ranked ones, During this period
,they ran the score to 2m. pioneer quarterback Kent Thomson had two passes interpreted
to start the first and third scoring drives.
The Pioneers finally started
rolling in the second half and
ran the score to within eight
points. With 2:27 left in the
game they recovered an inside kick. But the saint hope of
a tie was shattered three plays
water when smaller or St, Olaf
picked off a Tom Lower pass.
The game was filled with er<
Tors. St. Olaf lost the ball by
gambling six times and had
one pass interpreted. Grinnell
had a sure lingerie fairfield
and didn't lose the ball once by
gambling. But they made up for
this by having six passes interpreted. This is two less than
the total for all of last year!
It is interesting to note that
twice Grinnell recovered Ole
females only to have a pass in
perceived in the next play.
After doing an enormous amount of research I have compiled the following passing star
tactics: The Pioneers attempted
22 passes; six were interpreted,
nine were completed, and seven
ate grass. This means a shopping 68 percent of the passes
Were caught. (Unfortunately

Pioneer split end Mike Schwerh streams toward six
points of Grinnell gain with a completed pass.
 
the printer frequently had the
wrong color jersey.)
The total gain from the nine
collections was 51 yards. But
of the nine, three were for
scores. One was for a two point
conversion and the other two
were touchdown passes. That's
a charitable 52 yardsl
Less can be said about a
crossscountry meet. Naturally
coach Ray obermiller was disappointed about the two losses
and feels they were due to a
lack oi conditioning and failure
of the squad to run in a pack.
He is planning to quickly remedy those defects.
The order in which they finished against St. Olaf:
1. Doug gray (2 .125)
3. Bob Asbille

THE KIBITZER
By JOHN RAZ
An important emission in last week’s table of responses is that
when responded holds second round control in the asked suit and
an Ace outside, he bids the Ace.
In responding to the first asking bid, responded often will have
a void or words which were not covered by the table. For these ln<
stanley, there are three rules to modern responded's bid: 1. When
respondent hand has a void but no Ace, treat the gold as though
it were an Ace; 2. When responded’s hand has a void and an Ace
in outside suits. and second round control in the asked suit, Show
the Ace, disregard the void: 3. With an Ace in the asked suit and
a void outside, bid the voice with void in the asked suit and all
Ace outside, bid the Ace.
In general, the first asking bid and its responses reveal either
first or second round control in the asked suit and all first round
controls in the outside suits. The second asking bid discusses inform
nation about all second round controls which have not been ro<
sealed.

Hand 1. (a) spaces are the agreed trust suit. (b) it: is the

first nor second round control, he therefore signs off by returning
to the agreed trust suit at the lowest possible level.
Hand 2, (3) Hearts have been bid and raised, there is no
reason for South to bid clubs other than to make an asking bid
since game in hearts is the obvious target of the bidding. it: must
be an asking bid, (b) North has second round control in clubs and
the Ace of trust, he therefore pumps trust, (c) From his knowledge of the Controls and constitutional information in the bidding

bid and raised. (1)) 4C is the first asking bid, clubs is the asked

outside you bid the Ace, therefore North bids 4]] showing the
Ace. (d) South still needs to know about North’s Kings, so he
makes a second asking bid. It is important to note that South could
have made his second asking bid in any suit but trust, but some
suits will reveal more information than others, therefore he is
careful to choose hearts as his second asking bid. He needs to know
if his partner has the King of Hearts. (e) Nonh has the King of
hearts and the King of spaces he therefore pumps trust. (0

and for the sake of revenge my
prediction is 27—23 in favor of
the Pioneers.
The barriers beat powell 25-
ders, Last year Cornell squeaked by with a 27-23 football victory. The printers will be out
to revenge that defeat.
A prediction for that game
would be a shot in the dark but
I will attempt it. Cornell has a
lot of depth this year having
lost only five men to graduation. They will be playing for
the home fans. Grinnell comes
to them after almost thing the
conference charts of last
year. There is bound to be a
let down and their performance
d e p e n d s on their ability to
source back. I think they can
and will win if they show the
spirit they had against the
Oles. It should he a close game
