Rabbi potential went on to
illustrate the relationship between religious and psychiatry.
“Bath See that love deals,” he
said, “And that hate parts.”
The need to love others as expressed in the words, “Thou
shall love thy neighbor as thereof” is now a form of psychiat—
pic medicine. ”Love is a topic,
while hate is a poison," Dr.
potential said, “a poison that
farms the water more than the

Dr. potential’s second speech

subject, “The New Religious
Dialogue and our Political
Scene." The talk centered around
a recent visit to Germany which
he made with several other
American clergymen at the re
quest of the Bonn government.
Dr. potential spoke of the

The final meeting contents
a few minutes after l am. at
which time the chair felt that
a quorum had struggled into the
lauditorium. On every hand, dell—

which they planned to propose.
On one hand could be counted

of‘ a constitutional convention,
only to trail off into interactive—

Thurston then asked that
generates give their entire attention to the problem before
them, and the five and one

lredundant first article was

Changes in working were made

of the legislative article, the
meetings and procedure section,

Other substantial changes under the legislative article set

To the Editor:
Mr. Morris’ letter of last week‘
concerning the “Grinnsll Re.
view” reserves, I think, an an
swer by someone who is more
aware of the problems which
contract such a student public
nation and of the recent history
of the “Review" than Mr. for-l
his appears to be. since its in-‘
section in the spring of 1959,‘
the “Review" has made no pro
sense of being an exclusively}
literary journal. it ‘has printed
two articles dealing with his
typical topics, one with biology,i
and a group of pseudo»philosophical analyses Each of these‘
seemed to be met with a good
deal of interest by our sub—,
scanners
l The reason for such diversity
is obvious The job of editing,
such a magazine is primarily al
selective, not a productive one.
In other words, a lack of good
fiction is a lack on the part of
the Grinnell students rather
than the editorial staff.
On a campus which has only
one class concerned with wait—
ing creative prove, where still
sent posts (and we have some
remarkable good ones) have to
work entirely on their own with-
shown in some of these articles
we feel is complicated for by a
unique breath of point of view
and their pertainacity to the
Grinnell student.
Another reason that the "Grid
well Review” feels free to use
material from a variety of fields
is because unlike “NOUS” it is
neither sponsored nor subsidiary
by any department or students
fund to whose purposes it would
bc alleged to limit itself. It is
potentially dependent, therefore.
on advertisements and students
subscriptions to cover its operat
ing expenses, and we have di
covered that both these sources
tend to vary rather too unpr
dictably for comfort. 1 persons
ally doubt that a student publication of the nature of the
”Review" can exist for long and
Serve a meaningful role on campus without some more dependence means of financial support.
These are the reasons for the
appreciated length (you needs’t
count the pages, they‘re numr
bored) and the only partially
literary contents of the later
issue of the “Grinnell Review”.

The Beloit analysis proved a favorites one for the

is Something more than the are-
 
influence felt,
The “pro" side of the NSA questions is filled with
the fine record shown by the organization during the royalty path problem The NSA is a recognized lobby group
which has made itself felt in Washington on several occasions and often on matters in wllich Grinnell students
have shown some interest or sympathy. Among its other
activities are included a continuing liberal stand on the
sit-in movements, support of the Peace corps and a lobby
concerned with the curious practices of the House and
Senate investigation committees.
In addition to its national voice, NSA at Grinnell,
locally, might provide some of the “continued" needed to
preserve the interest in national affairs encouraged by
plane Krohnke and company, Such “continued" may come
in handy next year when the student council leadership
leaves their hands. The pressure provided by an outside
group dedicated to reflection and encouraging “the broader low ” among students, may well be the very thing
which will keep the work of this last year’s Student Colin—
oil from falling by the website, as just another wave in
the Grinnell interest cycle.
As has been shown, membership will involve some
problems; leaving national AWS may not be the answer
to the monetary question; the Women’s Association should
certainly not be dropped without a thorough investigation
and report Aside from the money, however there seem to
be few insurmountable installed, and arguments for NSA
membership look too good to be overlooked
