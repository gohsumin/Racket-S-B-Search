Of tackliori‘ Talk
Professor William Lockhart,
Dean oi the University oi since—
soma’s Law School, addressed the
Gl'innell PrenLaw Club October 19,
on the subject of ”photography
and the Law."
After a special dinner attended
by club members, Locknart spoke
in the Forum’s South Lounge on
tale problem or membership oi the
observe and how the Supreme
Court has hoped with the issue
in the past twelve years.
Obscenity and Sex
Lockhart emphasized that obscenity and sex are not the same
and that “sex affects all banking.“ Many problems have been
reflected upon society because
man has ground in the dark be.
cause of sex tables, according to
Lockhart. These tables are being
challenged by law "where the exact subject matter makes freedom
of expression essential."
Lockhart rarely angeles to the
belief that a democratic society
must be free to pet-left itself. in
light oi legal approval or Lady
quarterly’s Lover in movie form
in 1959, he emphasized that there
is a “constitutional right to advo—
date adapters under certain circumstances.”
Protected from nudist
Nevertheless, Lockllarl still
maintains that society should be
protected from “nudist to parade
on the streets of Grinnell” or
"tree love allocation on campus"
or even signatures accounting
sexual interactive.
However, there is nothing wrong,
according to him, with reading
about such things, because an in
dividend does not have to read
anything—it is simply his privilege to do so.
He adds, "There are all kinds of
stimuli in our society which calculate sex desired.” He then mentioned a past study conducted on
a large computational campus on
which the women were asked what
the greatest sexual stimulant was
The general reply was simply
“send" Thus, Lockhart believes
that one cannon eliminate sex from
the world. it is ‘a part of society
—a part of life."

Concern Over diet Nam
Suddenly the demonstration have made us, the
Grinnell students, realize the concern over diet Nam
more clearly.
They’re real students now, not just unseen critics.
VAnd they are students who have shared America with
us for about 20 years and who share our “conditioning"
to the problem of war.
Supposedly, we 20-year-odds have been led to realize that many of the traditional views of war don't
fit the modern situation. Why, with the advances in
weaponry, are we fighting a “traditional” war? Why,
with advances in communications between nations, are
we fighting any war?
Supposedly, we 20-year-odds have been taught to
be open linked, and so we respect the views of people
who have lived through traditional wars, people who
think that concentrations against the government's
stand in time of war is wrong.
Supposedly, we 20-year-odds ought to be responsible to our government. It would be english to want to
try to determine a system that allows the opportunity
to demonstrate as students are now doing.
Supposedly, also, we 20-year»odds have a commitment to tell others how we feel a situation like diet
Nam ought or ought not be handled. And why should
we let the rest of the country forget our feelings when
the deck on has been made against our favor?
Many students are demonstration from a non-traditional, open-linked, unified, and idealistic standpoint.
But they are being called towards and columnists.
They are detected and arrested. They burn draft cards
and get no understanding. They criticism and lower the
mobile of our troops.
Is the student demonstrated being treated the right
way? By the time he is better by the angry survivors
of other wars, by the time he is called communist by
his government leaders, by the time he is fixed for
burning an insightﬁcant piece of paper, he will probably come to have double not only about the diet Nam
situation but also about the intrinsic worth of a species
that knows what it is doing is wrong but that keeps it
up while beginning the lack of alternatives.

Student Evaluation of Faculty
Given Official Status at Yale
By PAUL BRADLEY
Yale University has taken the
ill-st step in giving its students an
official voice in the appointment
of faculty members to centre positions. The university has invited
dramatically high-ranking students to submit written appraisals
oi their educational experience in
lectures, discussions, and semi<
real-s.
The move is part of the review
of Yale’s faculty appointment system and is an effort to turn the
threat that faculty members must
"publish or parish” into an admonilion to “publish and teach or
parish." The review was ordered
alter heated controversy last
spring when Richard Bernstein,
associate professor oi philosophy,
was not promoted to the centre
position at iuil professor. Students
had then demonstrated against
what they thought was a gross

er.

students last year, uses frank
language to describe the faculty.
of the 133 faculty members, 33
are considered outstanding and 60
are rated above average. After
computing the questionnaires, the
review assigned grades from ex4

upon what the review said oi

Searching For women, S 8 B News Team journals West
By Bob Hodierne
John Phillips
Henry Wilhelm
John Wolf
There was a kind of sense quiet
around the 5&3 workshop Wednesday night as the paper was being put together. No one wanted
no say it, but everyone knew why:
The paper didn’t have The Big
Feature. Nothing to set it apart.
Nothing to make it stick out in
Ono’s mind.
It was mentioned offhandedly,
m passing. it was to he the private
est comes of the century and would
be visible that night.
“Why not," someone suggested,
'do a photo feature on the comes?”
It would rush the printer a bit not
getting the pictures until Thursday
afternoon, but for something this
big . . .
It was decided that the four of us
would get up at color o’clock Thur
day morning, drive out into the
country, and take pictures. The
comes, it was reported, would be
most spectacular just before and
right at dawn.
From here on out the story of
the search for the comes is best
handled in straight technology.
12:00 — it was still raising in
Grinnell and of course tale cloud
cover would prevent comes photos
graphics. We called the Des
points weather bureau. They said
It would clear up by 3:00 or 4:00
that morning We finished up with
the rest of the paper.
 
2:00 — We called Des points
again — just to he sure. They had
changed their minds. it was clear
in Omaha-Council Bluffs, they said,
but it was still raising in Des
points. At dawn all they would
promise would be clear skins about
30—40 miles west of Des points.
Their advice was if you want
comes pictures Go West Young
Man. The advice had a familiar
ring, we considered it brieﬂy, and
decided.
2:15 — After a stop to gather
supplies We were off. Essentially it
was the same team that had nov-
fred delta last spring. We were
getting used to leaving on a moment's notice to get the story. We
had four cameras, nine different
lenses, two friends, looked glass,
lens discuss and film. We took a
special film with us, film ordered
directly from Kodak. it is the
World’s most light sensitive film
made especially for taking pic»
turns of things like stars —- and
covers. We were ready.
3:30 — it was raising quite hard
when we reached Des points, But
after all, the weatherman had said
30-40 miles west of Des points
and, besides, the country and
western disc hockey on WHO said
that the day would dawn clear and
with those two on your side . . .
5:00 -— At Atlantic, Iowa, we
were showed to a near trail it was
raising so hard. grid (lawn was fast
opproaching. We kept heading for
the west and for the promised
clear skins.
6:30—We reached Council Bluffs
at dawn and, thank God, the skins
had started to clear. We found, approximately, a stuff from which we
could watch and photograph the
brightest col-net of the century.
"oven THERE . . . no, over there . . . no . . seemed to be the session at the sea news
team as they stood yesterday morning on a stuff outside Council Bluffs. They are ii. to r.)
Phillips. Wilhelm. Wolf. and Hodierne.
 
The wind on the stuff was co‘dv
earned cold, but we put our
cameras in place, took the light
readings, and were ready for our
photo feature — if only those
clouds right along the eastern
horizon would lift, We had read
that the comes would be visible
three directors of the sun below

It deals with war. peace, life,

In this tour or back stage we
have arrived at the person responsible really, basically responsible for the whole show. It is he
who choices the play, finds the
actors, generates the authority for
the technical jobs, overseas both
the from stage and back stage
work and finally worried himself
sick on opening night. who is this
father-figure. this supreme au«

The director, or course.
The Grinnell theatre is extreme.
1y lucky to have available two
ﬁne directors; Mr. Edward (red)
Donahoe and Mr. Richard (Dick)
Meyer. Donahue is presently on
leave. so Meyer has assumed the
schedule. iii overseas not one play
but many; acting as supervisors
director for student directed works
shops, financing Roberts instruments and the budget, and direction the major productions.
It all started with drama as an
extra-curriculum activity in high
school. At truly College in springfield, Mo, Meyer managed in English and art. But during this time
he was active in college drama,
and directed the Springfield complexity Theatre. One summer vacation he after and directed in a
television play which appeared on
the Eddy Arnold Show. Next, with
liberal arts degree in hand, he
went to Northwestern University.
where he got his master’s in theatre, Arkansas State College
shipped him up. He headed their
drama department for tour years.
Notre Dame next had the good
torture to have him as professor
of radio and television media in
their theatre department. But the
call of the small liberal arts college proved too much. Meyer left
Notre Dame to come to Grinnell
in 1957.
On his last leave, Meyer was
assistant to Whitehead and japan.
Arthur Miller's newest play after
the Fall was being produced at
Lincoln Center in New York and
japan and Whitehead were producing it for Miller. Meyer said at
japan: “He is one of the {ow
creative ventures around. He is a
quiet-spoken man but there is a
feeling of dynamic energy surrounding him." Other words Meyer used were “no-nonsense” and
“magnetic." and there was much
respect in his voice.
When he returned from Lincoln
Center, Meyer wrote a hook on
his experiences in New York. He
has also had some academic papers published.
Since he has returned to the active duty at Grinnell, Meyer has
produced and directed serious
sex (last fall term) and The
Knock (last week-end).
When he was asked what he
hopes for the future oi the drama
department, he spoke of integrating the theatre with the campus.
"The theatre is a part or life, it
is more than entertainment. It
should generate in campus theatre
a kind of academic enthusiasm al—
so." He also wishes to continue
the weekrinrNew York trips.
