'7 . Recreation Unlimited;
_ by Dale turkish
in a Grinnell college community- ali c one ot‘the Sttldciits’
biggest prices is, “There’s nothing to do," the physical education
departments are trying to do something about it. A program
which was started this (all by the construction of a dual ilCQ‘
link and ,the acquisition or skin, toboggans and a ski slope, _is
now searching out into other projects, with specially unlimited potential for providing the Grinnellian with something to do
with himself. _ - _
Although the weather has handicapped the skiing and seat—
ing programs two ski trips have. been possible‘ yet, and only
one skating link is unable), there are other, more certain actions.es planned for the future by Coach lrv Simone, who is admin—
i.bring the program. » _ ‘ ,
Sunday in the projection room in our-line library’s basement,
there will be tour lialbhotli' meetings starting with sk ng at
7.30 pm. 7 covering skiing, canon » s, sailing, and ice fight g
possibilities. Harry better, of Grinnell, an experienced ice fisher—
man who lives on Rock-Creek lake, and several at his friends
have connected la ‘l‘iClp start this activity. _
Bus trips to Town city to see Big Ten athletic contests,
with- a dinner in omaha on the way, are in the skiing. Three
dolls for basketball games are already effectively set. Slmone‘
pointed out that similar trips to uLhCr clubs to see spot'ilng‘
events, to take advantage of a big name band's presence or to.
attend a play are also possible. . _ _
Plans for alter spring location include a one and a half day’
canon trip every weekend on the iowa river for some 20 per-,1
pie. This trip would cover the 30 miles between santa and Mar»
shalltown and would involve a night of camping out. The trips‘
u-our be cold, but' before students could go they would haveeto

- Watch for a “recreational area" on the post office bulletin,

over the radio station and in thaQuad dining room. ‘t
All the possibilities are too numerous to discuss at length,

So there you have it. Simone and the athletic department
have worked hard setting their program up, and there is a great
deal in it that showing appeal to Gi-innell students—Certainly
something for all interesisveven sophisticated who might staff
at riding on a bus, The opportunities for dating and mail functions are there in a scope that has been packing at this school.
As Simone further points, "We’ll consider any reasonable r ,
quest iron-i any group that has a good idea but needs a means
of transportation and someone to make the arrangements, The
tools are all there. There's no reason to stop here—a spring vacation to Sun Valley for skiing ~01‘ a Christmas trip to Florida
