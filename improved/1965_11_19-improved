"precious" by the college prefix

The petition sought more student
voice in possible decisions about

“We don’t think we're being included in the decision~making
about hall representation." was
the way Jerry forward, Student
Government president, opened
comments to the residence calls
Tuesday night. forward went

recently been discussing the ‘possibility of reorganizing the hall
system. He further still that as
things stand now the Executive
Council would make recorded
Actions to President suggest who
would make the final decision.
. suggest said that the Executive
Council oi the faculty was discussions the problem but that the committee was “Very informal" and
that “we're a long way from a
decision.”
The student petition complaints
that the student “rule is going to
be one of objects oi consultation”
and that “students should have a
substantial participating rule beyond occasional consultation in
 
any decision on the organizing oi
the residence calls.”
forward then suggested that a
joint student - faculty e armenia
station committee be formed to
discuss the problem or to discuss
it indeed there is a problem at alli
The petition went on to suggest
the joint committee, and further
stated that “this proposal involves
no preconceptions about what

themselves are not agreed on this
problem We only ask that the
different opinions be allowed to

“Without these changes, it is
doubtiul if any Great Society bills
would have been reported to the
ﬂfor of the House." Albert stated
dramatically.
He explained that even though
the membership of the House
changed considerable after the
1964 elections, the membership on
the Rules and the Ways and Means
Committees would have been identical with previous years — ii the
changes hadn’t been made.
Albert noted that the Congress
passed 73 major bills, or 88 per
cent of the President's Great So:
dirty program, and that “these
reforms in Januarywere the most
important thing we did all year,"
Albert devoted the second part
of his speech to the misconception that “Congress is invisible of
initiative or producing major
bills."

He pointed out that the legislative
process in a democratic country is
necessarily a slow one, often spank

But “legislation is not the exclusive province of elected leaders" and “the public often Con<

He cited the Area Redevelopment Act, the mass-transit bill,
the immigration act, Medicare, and
the tax reduction bill as examples
oi legislation originally concerned
and prepared by the Congress, and
later identified with the White
House.
Albert concluded by describing
the 89th Congress as ”the session

Carl Albert, House Majority
Leader since 1962, willingly answered questions before a small
crowd at the student press conference Wednesday. The out-spa—
ken harrison said that "we are
the alternative party; we are the
party of action!"
He Was asked twice about Congressional versus executive initiative of legislation. He stood
strongly for Congress and said
that in the last session Congress
did indicate most of the legislation and that Congress is the
only one who can put issues on
the statute books, Congress still
does the legislation; it always has,
and it always will.”
He said that in the next session
a District at Columbia home rule

Smith lectures 0n Kierkegaard,
analyses substantial Perspective
By IAN BAHL
Defining the substantial approach to the problem of God,
Dr. John admin Smith says
the first task of the modern they—
logian is to force a determination or positivist metaphysics.
Smith, chairman of the philosophy department at Yale University, was the 1965 Gates lectures,
and spoke in service Chapel Monday night in the second of three
lectures on “The Problem of GM.”
“We have to lounge in with all
the risk involved.” he said, ”and
force a determination of some of
the dedicated theories of reality
in which the problem of God never gets off the ground, and in
which the problem of God is already settled in a negative way."
Smith dealt specifically with the
Kierkegaardian approach to realm
its, which begins With a presupposition oi God's reality and sees
the meaning of existence In the
individual human purpose. This
purpose must be realized “through
knowledge of one's own being."
According to Smith, this is “the
shock oi being there without being in an the decision.”
recognition Kierkegaard's congress for driving the individual to
an awareness of the university
present in his own particular case,
and to an awareness that man
may be speaking about himself
when applying university to other
 
men, Smith said, “Most Individu—
all tend to move In the direction
of the universal value rather
than to their own particular eye.”
In order to progress to a subjec»
time state in which the individual
eye focuses on the university,
people must be driven to (arm
their answers by drawing them
from their own questions.
Thus, according to Smith, becoming substantial means decor—
living ”man's nature as a responsible moral being who must act
and choose, and who can’t avoid
the responsibility or this free
dom.”
Smith cited Kierkegaard‘s realistic of life styles—a way of conducting himself on the basis of one
major principle There are three
basic life styl the esthetic, the
immediate satisfaction oi the prev.
ent; the ethical. a call of duty or
personal commandment; and the
religious, based on faith and trust,
“God appears on the scene as
a solution to the problems or the
first two life styles,” Smith Said.
The surely esthetic or ethical life
is inadequate, he believes, because “an attempt to live a life
of satisfaction of the present mo—
ment impels treatment at other
beings as objects, until the man
himself becomes an object who
can't please himself at all, and
an ethical call of duty is too
enormous a responsibility for man
 
to bear." Man Is protected into
a religious lite style because oi
his awareness that he can’t live
the others
Smith saw the reality of God In
Kierkegaard’s approach as “not the
same as the problem of existence Dr non-existence of a ﬁsite
object. The reality of God is bound
up with the extent to which the
individual recognized a change
within himself and his deliverance
from the esthetic and ethical life
styles.” If existence is to be re
served for sense objects, and God
is not a possible object, then
"God does not ‘exist’; he Is eternal." Smith addedﬂ‘GeiHs real,
and exists in the individual, instead as God furnished a ground for
his subjective being."
The difficulties of Kierkegaard’s
View come because “combining the
problem to man’s existence runs
the risk of losing its relationship
to the rest of the world and the
Community of individuals," stated
Smith. Also, he said, “It is an accepted view that when I think
about something, it must be made
into an objects There is nothing
interest in thinking itself that
makes what is being thought about
an object. We need to have not
only the truth of participation, but
also the truth of distance. Man

must get out of the throws of the
problem and think about I! in order to see the point."
The greatest difficulty that
Smith found in Kierkegaard's view
was his acceptance of the doctrine
that existence “means only what
it means for sense objects; God.
emotions, human relations do not
‘exist'.” This View of nature of
reality “excluded God at the outlet, not just at the end. God has
to be dead if he does not exist,
and does not exist at the outlet.”
Smith asked, "What is the jul»
tificatiim for the View that God
does not exist, but is real?"
“You Can’t begin with an intellectual commitment [D reality by
excluding God at the outlet and
expertise to bring him back
through front at the end," he continued. therefore, this theory must
be questioned in open up a whole
new discussion to get into new
metaphysical problems,

During Lecture
Ky PAUL G. KUNTZ
John E. Smith delivered the
Gates Lectures on “The Problem
of God." The problem is the reality of God. That. is, considering all
that is, what ground is there for
the whole system? All religion, according to Smith, hands on the answer.
The earlier approaches led up to
the "Metaphysical Approach” in
the third lecture, smith advised
his audience that his method was
statistical as a Socratic search for
definition, moving from the inadequate to the adequate.
Biblical revelation discusses God
in and with events told in historical order. God never appears except in circumstances in which
men act. Hence a beastiality oi
Biblical theology: it reveals the
mighty acts archived to God, but
does not argue. Herein is the weak-
on Metaphysics
news or such a theology- it must
interview, yet it processes to be
wholly objective.
Smith moved on from the post»
tion of pure effectively m the position of pure connectivity — that
is, to Existentialism. The classical
existentialist, Soeren Kierkegaard,
wrote to shock us into awareness
of our unique privacy. The religious
existentialisi has a relation between two subjects, the human self
and the divine self. In this rely»
township, there is no world, in the
sense of nature or of society. The
Kierkegaardian drops the world
out of his scheme. in its way, this
is as inadequate as the Biblical
approach in its way.
In a subtle manner, the third approach, the metaphysical, pulled
the objective and the subjective
aspects of reality together. But the
third lecture was not a synthesis
of two earlier stages. Smith’s ar-

moment tests on taking the sen as
the model of reality. Only in the
self do we know the one and the
many together. Then by anatomy
we move from the sell that has a
body to God that has the world.
This is no proof, said Smith, for a
proper hypothesis can be only
tested by absence Lil a condition
But God as ground of being is such
that it must be always present.
What is there that leads men to
recognize the presence of an une
limited answer? The Search for
knowledge in human experience
such as the history of science is a
search for an infinite goal. The
scientific quest can never attack
perfect title, it can only approximate to a complete body of correct
answers. Hence human experience
of a world presupposes God, for
men mean by God an ultimate
consciousness, related to all, which
310118 is what Could be called the
consciousness ot perfect truth.
Smith, when charged with having assumed God from the believe
king, accepted this analysis as
correct, But then he responded.
why he like Sartre, who excluded
God from the beginning? Sartre
can't be Sartre if God is real. The
test between a [hEISllC and an title»
isaac position is the adequate to
all that we know. If you want to
try humanities existentialism, go
ahead, said Smith, try to work it
out without me formation such
as in a Biblical approach or the
conditions and inadequacies of the
Kierkegaardian approach.
