“I don’t believe in the ‘ln Loco
parental’ concepts The time iii
gone when the administration of a
college can template student mobility; besides. I look too young to
be anyone's father," said 47-learned Dr. Glenn suggest during an
interview Monday.
Grinnell’s new president thinks
that freshmen need to be guided
through their first year; “then
regulatory controls should be red
based."
No specific proposals will be
coming from the president's office
for a while. Dr. suggest says he
still needs some time up look the
situation over. He wash’t code
wanted about the credit’ rental
late in May.
He was offered me post un July
9 and officially accepted on July
12. Dr. suggest's appointment was
effective Sept. 1, but he won't be
on campus permanently until Sept.
16‘ or 17r
To get to know Grinpell better.
Drr suggest will start talking with
the college constitution about in
promises and problems.
"My concern is mainly with the
academic environment. I want to
arrive at a definition of the act<
comic environment at Grinnell.
Our definition will, however. need
constant registration to prevent a
pregnant environment."
‘Dr. suggest was protest of the
University of Washington in Seattle
since 1963. He had been director'
of freshman English, special assistant to the president, and vice protest.
He has a BA. from Middlebury
College and an MA and Ph. D.
from Ohio State University. He
taught at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Ohio State be.
more going to Washington.
In other comments, Dr. suggest
said, "I’m not an ‘either-ar' man
in the field of education. I believe
in public education, but l recognize
the special integrity and response<
bility of a small liberal arts
school."
Also, Dr. suggest sees faculty
salaries, the residence hall sites<
tion and monetary support for the
college as some of the big issue!
that must he faced this year a!

Dr. suggest said he has observed
a healthy feeling of respect and
pride for Grinnell among all segments of the Grinneil community
without reaching the proportion:
of selfrglory found at some schools.
Dr. suggest explained, "when
you reach a certain age. you want
to be in a situation where you are

To the Editor:
By Vii-sure of age and most inn'
pop-taut, education, the student and
attached stand on different planes.
They have often been described as
being polenuciilly opposed: better
that they should be in juxtaposition. l am not accounting the impossible, a state of intellectual
support, but most certainly there
can and should be a point of great
or understanding. This understanding is not to be reached by a blind
and uiireasoning tolerance benefit
gently restored by one group upon.
time other. but it may well be ar-
.river at through the process ot
education itself.
Great is the professor who
through the work ot a Voltaire iiir
products his students to the write
.inns ol a Marx as well. Greater
still is he who not only introduces.
but teaches opposite human concepts, It is the great and constant
danger to the classroom that the

percent upon the catalogue and
the student alike—a evaluation
fred by narrowness of mind and
stainless intellectual calesilienics.
g There is a beauty to be discovered in the study of the Hegelian
realistic; a wonder to be restored
up on the student or an Einstein or
terms: a thrill to be experienced
by the reader or a De louisville
or Whitehead. unfortunately. the
beauty, the wonder, and the thrill
are often related with a infection

The fault, dear reader. tests not
upon the providers of the processors alone any more than it fails
4 upon the student. The responsibility should be shared equally by
both, The teacher must offer the
challenge and guidance—the student must have the furniture and
desire to accept the challenge.
The citizens oi learning can
often- one a blanket of false security for a now years if one is a

One day a man can be would by

the first step only.
Both professor and puppy must
percent the stainless of ideas and

question must be asked: Does what
we are studying have a place in
the society in which we are living?
