Grinnell College Closes Doors in Protest
Memorial Service
Held On Wednesday
By Greg further
President Glenn Leggctt, SGA
President Andrew Loewi, and
Dean Joseph Wall addressed a
liaslilyrcalled all—College corporation Wednesday on Central
Campus
Following announcements by
Loewi and an innovation by Rev.
Dennis l-laws, President suggest
spoke about the week's events
and the College community‘s
response:
”Yesterday was a terrible day
[or all oi us individually . . .but
the College as an institution also
had’a terrible day. I do not
personally believe that the
cancellation of classes as a form
of protest was the digest course
[or us to follow.
“We should be committed to
doing as much as we can to make
society better than it is, But i
think we have got to do this from
the holiday established home base
oi the college and device a series
oi construction proposals, oi
which this memorial service and
the visit oi faculty, students, and
administrators to Congress, are
solid instances. otherwise, i
believe we will continue to go
from one ad-how determination to
another, and that arbitration and
depression will continue to ac-
complete until this precious little
college comes apart at the
seems.”
Loewi followed President
suggest's speech with a short,
verse address He said in part:
“It has become clear that We
are beginning to witness the
same kind of vocational
depression that occurred in Nazi
Germany. . .Yesterday for the
first time this institution took a
stand on a political issue, It is a
big first step, but it is not enough.
it this institution is going to
survive as a place [or rational
inquiry, it must in the times
ahead commit itself to political
action on all prints . , .I don’t
consider this service to be a
memorial to those. who have died
7 it may be a memorial to
America, those we can work to
Ensure that it is note"
Dean Wall gave the final
speech, in which he tried to place
the recent events in historical
perspective, rating a healthy
passage from Henry David
whereas Some oi his remarks
were as follows:
“These are arabic days for us
as a College, for us as Black men
and white men, for us as
Americans, {or us as inhabitants
oi this small planet, which is
being followed by industrialism
and defined by war. . .We concern and we week in our despite
and arbitration. conservation
certainly is important but
despite is selidcstructivc."

As members of an institution
committed to reason and
mobility and to the relationship
between private and public
responsibility, we, the majority
oi Faculty and Students oi
Grinnell College, joined by other
Citizens of the city of Grinnell,
vigorously concern the recently
interpreted aggressive action of
the United States in Cambodia
and Vietnam and the acts of
official depression so obvious in
recent days at Kent State and
other universities These removal and vocational acts and
others similar to them threaded
the life of this institution and
other institutions of higher
education; they discuss the
process oi learning, increase the
organization of society, and
society’s potential for violence.
These acts must be concerned,
and we concern them,
We urge all academic institutions and all citizens to take
a similar position and to join us in
making their voices heard in
centers of state and national
decisionrmaking, We are sending
official obligations to the
Governor of Iowa, the President
of the United States, and the
Congress. .We encourage others
to do likewise.

Students Fast, Occupy
Chapel for contamination
Tuesday afternoon Jim
Demopulos, Grinnell sophomore,
moved into service Chapel for a
period oi three days oi testing
and thought. He was later joined
by others, who resolved to share
his time of living on bread and
water and searching the soul, and
by Wednesday morning the group
had grown to tour: Mike
O'Connor, Dave Walker, and
Anne Bendheim, all sophomores.
It was apparent to those who
dropped in to talk to them that
they saw their action as an
alternative to what was going on
at the ROTC building. When
approaches for comment they
were quite resistant to grant
anything like an interview, since
it was not their stated intention to
set an example.
Jim pointed out that the chicken started out as his own “ago
trip,” an attempt to get away
from the road outside and think
by himself. All four felt that
getting away from the group
mortality ,was a good thing,
getting away to a place Where it
is possible to think things out and
make personal decisions.
Mike said he wanted to do some
thinking about where he was
going, what he was going to be
live years, ten years from now.
He also had decided to get away
from what he referred to as nasty
action and “do a little thinking in
this nice, big, quiet place."
Anne emphasized their in»
mention to be themselves and not
an example to others. She ad
fitted the practical accessibility
oi this, but tell the action
nonetheless more important than
the example. She said, “The
people around here who think
don‘t know what to do. The people
who don’t think don‘t know
either, but they do it anyway.”
When pressed for a statement,
they quoted a song by the goods

“2. That students meet tomorr

Theatre to draw up a specific
proposal to be presented to the
students for references vote and

Andy lnewi called the meeting
loordcr at aboutB:30; whereupon
a collection was taken to help delray the cost or sending ,d'omega
tion from Grinnell College to
Washington, D. C.
Tom Thomas, just back from
Ohio, where he had talked to a
new people connected with the
Kent State incident, gave a brief
outline oi the facts, as he knew
them, about Kent State, about
Cambodia, and about the actions
oi other colleges across the
nation. He then argued that the
present situation required the
commitment of the institution to
“non-violent action” in order to
“put pressure on the simon administration to change its
policies.”
Much debate followed, on both
sides oi the question. Various
suggestions were made: that
Grinnell close completely for the
duration oi the year, that classes
he allowed to continue on an op»
signal basis for those students
who wishes to continue their
work, that classes be cancelled
completely and workshops in
solving townspeople be held on
the campus about the present situation at Kent State and in
Cambodia, and that the school
remain open for the rest or the
term, those students who wish to
participate in the concentrations

Earlier in the day. the Senate
and a group oi about three
hundred other students met in the
South Lounge to draft and discuss

amendment to the resolution was
proposed which would have included a demand to tree all

Bobby Scale. The amendment
was voted down by a narrow
margin,
President suggest was present
at this meeting to suggest
possible changes in the resolution
which would make it more acceptable to the faculty, The

resolution.
Minutes later the faculty

resolutions A number or amendments were offered, including
one which would have

“When Logic and Proportion
Have Fallen mostly Dead”
Tuesday at noon the faculty of this college contents in a special meeting to pass a resolution. That
is just what they did. They did not meet to consider the possibility of passing a resolution, and those
of them who thought so were quickly corrected by
Andy Loewi when he told them that unless they
passed the resolution as the student senate had
granted it, the students would not enlarge it, but
would have their own separate resolution.
At no time was the idea of individual conference, so monthly mounted during the decision not to
meet classes for the duration of the monitoring and
the B & G strike, seriously considered, except in a
single speech by John prospect, Classical Languages.
He was quickly discussed as a toward by a small
here of individuals relying heavily on each others
support.
Dean Wall informed the faculty, after they
suspended with long arguments in remaining their
commitment to the word ”mobility” in their resolution, that it would be a moral obligation for every
faculty member to obey this directive from his colleagues. The question of the equality of the action
was raised, but also quickly showed aside in the
harry to appears the student senate. After the resolution carried on a vote of 71-6 with strong trying

from Dean Walker, who informed the faculty that
they had no right to defeat a resolution on which
the students had so greatly complicated themselves, a simple phone call to the college lawyer
confirmed that the action, indeed, was quite probably illegall We are aware, of course, that any individual who risks up alone to sue the college will be
a toward.
Shortly after the faculty gave the student senate what it detailed, there began a meeting on
central campus to discuss the issues involved. After
a couple of hours it developed that these issues were
not the real ones, or at least not important enough to
involve action, so everyone sponsored over to the
ROTC building for that apartment of sports, a building
moreover.
After the building had been stuffed with smug
revolutionaries, and Mr. myers, Grinnell’s first political refused, had been driven out by fear of jason,
mayhem, or worse involving his home, which happened to be in back of the building, students gathered on the front north and lawn to smile partly
and chart “We shall not be moved." The festival
atmosphere received a real shot in the arm when
Chief meters came by and left his car, which he
consequently marked in front of the building, to the
students as a stood, and then tracked a few jokes
with students. When President suggest and the
means showed up, the party was complete, and the
remainder of the afternoon was a protest so powerful as to put a smile on the face of anyone. Except a
thunder.
Earlier that morning, several bidding young
florists had decided that something had to be done
in response to the deaths of the five students at Kent
State. After selecting mounting or an appeal to the
statements of their classified, they decided not to
give their classified a chance to express their feelings at all or even to think, but rather to sit down
in front of the library to keep everyone from entering. This upset quite a few students and faculty, and
it is only due to the sentence to non-action on the
part of all Grinnellians that these young musicians
of our basic freedoms were not unceremoniously
bumper over the rail of the library. Possibly also
because they chose to leave the side entrance previously unguarded, there was a little traffic in and
out of the library in the morning. As soon as the faculty decision to appears the student body by shooting the college down came into effect, that stopped
too.
In the past Grinnell has been a place where
little thought or reason was devoted to the process of
making decisions. There have, however, been few
days noted for the wholesale environment of reason
as last Tuesday.
__
The variations have occupied the AFROTC
building. The administration has gone to Washington to message its collective conference. And nothing
is being done.
There exists a regular procedure to deal with
receivers of College buildings, The procedure includes obtaining a court inspection to event the students from the building, The procedure does not in-
)crude the administration’s running away from the
' problem.
As long as the variations occurs the building
and go unpunished, and as long as a cowardly administration acquiesces in this behavior, Grinnell
College remains an affront to the idea of a free academic institution. We deserve better.

Letters
To The Editor:
This is the first time that [have
felt constraints to write a letter
to the editor to express my deep
concern over an issue in my nine
years at Grinnell College. I feel
that the action of the “majority at
the faculty and students" of
Grinnell College sets a most
dangerous president, As I understand this action it in effect
puts any minority constitution ot
the institution in the position of
supporting views with which they
might disagree. This is a instant
arrangement of the conventional
principle of an academic institution as expressed in the
concept of “academic freedom"
which holds that each person is
entitled to his own opinions and
has the right to express them.
Let it be clearly understood
that I abhore war wherever it is
fought and T likewise am
sickened by violence of any kind.
1 am not speaking for or against
the issues raised in the resolution
adopted by the faculty at the
special meeting of May 5, but
rather to the delivering and
conscious intention to speak as an
institution rather than as a
majority of that institution. This
action was most surprising in
view of similar actions recently
taken by a majority of the faculty
such as the various resolutions
concerning monitoring days. in
these resolutions great care was
taken to preserve the right of the
individual messenger who found
himself in the minority to do his
own thing and not to be labeled
with the majority with which he
disturbed. This careful action to
respect the indmdual’s con
science and freedom made me
proud to be a part of such an
institution.
However, it seemed to me that
emotions were allowed to
overcome reason in the debate of
May 5. This is a most dangerous
situation since we often degree
later what has been done under
the treasures of a difficult
emotional situation, The most
charming feature of this action is
that it took place not in some job
street scene, but in the
deliberative calls of the faculty of
an academic institution
dedicated to academic freedom,
ii the strongholds of our freedom
such as our colleges and
universities are phone to
the compression of individual freedom then what
of individual freedom then what
hope is there for the country at
large. It seems in me that the
same tactics of nomination by the
majority which are being
declared in the actions of our
government which claims to
speak for the “silent majority”
are being employed by the
majority of the faculty and
students at Grinnell College. Two
brings never make a right.
nomination of the majority
whether silent or vocal over [he
minority is not right or humans.
