The new age of political ad»

brought V\'l|.i‘i it tribal consciousness in the sense that these

politicians into thinking that
they exist not only for social

to play a leading part in national politics.
To achieve this end. politicians
organized their tribal unions in.

which later became part of a
political party led by a combination of political and tribal

These so-called national par
ties, very often with minority
members of Parliament in
them, go on to advocate tribal
states within the national

The worst cheats, according to
older, occurred two ye ago.
shortly after the library put»
closed a new set of the encyclopedia Britannica. when see—
oral of the Volumesrdisappeared
and have not been found.
while it is true. older said,
that often a student or professor
will absent-mindedly forget to
check a book out, these books
are almost invariably returned
and even so, the number of
-books to turn up missing is too
threat to believe that they were
:all taken internationally.
it
’i older expressed a degree oi
isurprisc about the whole situae
allow because, as he 'aicl, book

Even if inns big books could
be replaced, “I r is quite
often impossible as many of
the books are out of print, they
can never be replaced in time
for a needed purpose, not to
- speak of the great cost of time
and money such replacement
requires. “For every book we
are forced to replace," older
said, “we must contract
money front our budget which
could have been used to buy a
new lliluk."
What then, can be done to p

Bookstore manager Wassom,
asked the same question about
the problem of book caring, said
that in the bookstores case sterling was not a ma, problem.

Of course sterling, when it
occurs, is not combined solely E0
books but also to other objects
such as pens, etcr Small objects
are most likely to be stolen. The
reason for the lack of mar

evolution of current South
African attitudes was the
meeting of native tribesmen,
Bantus, with the Dutch far.mar
The mobility of the nations,
moving further and further
away from the settled farmer
- by hometown, helped create
two separate societies early in
South African history.
According to Balhngcr, the
,Trek Boer was a “law unto himself' with an intense belief in
stainless land. the use of Afrigaanse as native language. and
the desire to avoid governmental

never touched by the enlightenrncnt, liberalism, or industrial
revolution evident in 18th and
19th century Europe.
The Cape Province people,
developing from the original
mixture of Hotentot, delay and
white blood, provided the urban
population which was greatly
affected by the British occupation beginning in 1806.
Further switching the development of British influence
in South Africa, wallpaper relay»

concerning the historical summary, he discussed the people's
opositlfm to participation in the A
World Wars as a denial of governments and the convention of
South Africa which set up each
state as a province with its own
franchise.

African states in 1948, Bailin.

developments affecting the territory — 1) the industrial revolution, 2) the urban revolution \which was accentuated by
