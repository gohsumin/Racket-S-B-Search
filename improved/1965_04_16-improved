karma Speaks at Fourth Race Dinner,
Claims Preiudice Normal, Not informal
By Pam Clay
Discrimination and preceding
are normal rather than informal patterns, said John karma
(sociology) at Tuesday night's
dinner sponsored by the Board
of Religion. The dinner was
the fourth in a series designed
to execute participants on various aspects of the race problem.
“We usually do not get our
negative attitude by bad experiences with a group," karma
said. “We learn our attitudes
and values as a child, by the
tones of voice, features, and
just by how things are said."
He explained that one cause
of discrimination and preceding
in the South is that one naturally fits into the normal cultural
pattern of the society of which
he is a part. A Southern child
is surrounded by only one set
of attitudes, values and behaviour. He is given no choice.
He necessarily accepts what is
available.

upper-class women was passed.
The council also covered keep-

A motion was passed providing that no picture contracts

Also discussed was a suggestion by word true to look into
the purchase of a new bus for
c a m p u s organizations, residence calls, athletic teams, and
long distance trips during vacations. Such an arrangement,
it was thought. would free the
college wagons for more extensive use by individual students.
SGA President Jerry forward
reported that a proposal by the
executive cabinet which would
have eliminated payment of
damage bills from the hall social funds was turned down by
Acting President James Stauss.
The proposal provided that
when a hall was charged for
damages which it could not attribute to an individual, it
would ”pass the hat.” If this
method of collection failed,
after thirty days the bill would
be taken to the treasurer’s office. where each member of
the hall would be assessed his
equal share. forward said that

and a drive this spring for the
return of followed books to

Siauss: Prof
For Russian
An assistant professor oi
Russian has been hired by the
college to bring the Russian department back to full strength
in September, Acting President
James Stauss announced this
week.
Richard R. Sheldon of the
University of Michigan will
teach at least first year
courses. Second year offering:
will depend on enrollment.
The college did not hire a
Russian language professor this
year. In other years, Beth
Noble (Spanish) has taught
first year Russian, but this year
she has taught only Russian
literature courses,
In the some interview Stauss
discussed the proposed new
women’s directory. “The de-_
sign and location of a new residence hall for women is under
consideration, and the probe<
bility is that the building will
be approved. If it is approved
the explanation is that it will
be open for occupancy in Sep«

Stouss noted that the question
of continuing the Junior Liberal Arts examination was
brought up in this week‘s faculty meeting and will be discussed further at next week's
meeting.
He also said that the faculty

Asks Contributions for New Pool
.To the Editor:
Jim sherman was absolutely
correct in his letter to the charles and Black in which he
pointed out that there is a great
contrast between the distributed, totally inadequate swim»
king pool and the rest of the
campus. The pool is too short,
too narrow, and does not have
enough lanes. The locked rooms
are small and chubby, the air
is hot and rugby, and provisions for addresses are poor
in every sense oi the word. We
have, without the southwest
doubt, the worst pool and pool
building in the Midwest Conference. The present pool is inadequate for competitive swimming, Red Cross instruction,
White Caps synchronized swimming, and recreational swimming.
The administration and Board
of Trustees are well aware of
the existing need for a new pool.
The administration has had
some sensitive plans drawn up
for a swimming pool—recreation
building complex. Mr. Stauss
has told me that another capital fund drive will be launched
in three or four years with the
construction of this building
definitely in mind.
I was happy to learn that the
administration and Trustees are
going to do something about
our swimming pool diploma.
However, I think We. the std
cents, should also take an active interest in the problem, We
ought to try to continue our
families and other people i arrested and potentially interested in Grinnell

spent in the construction oi the
proposed swimming poolrrecreation building. Now is the time
to begin helping Grinnell build
a capital reserve for the project. A little contribution of time
and effort in this direction by
each or us will help to prove
that we feel dedicated to play a
responsible part in the improve
ment or Grinnell College.

it seems that during this pe

cars are not willing to accept
countries and governments
that do not confirm to the

press and other opinion-forming
agencies to support or destroy
the governments or African
leaders that. do not confirm to
the leaders they desire. In the
creation or this image certain
press correspondence are motor»
sons for their authority toward
certain countries and leaders.
Almost invariably, the leaders
that they hate are those who
seem determined to follow a
policy oi their own choosing.
The role of correspondence in
describing these leaders follows
a defining pattern. Although the
pattern has over and over
proved inaccurate or designated,
the practice still continues up
to this minute. For example, at
an earlier time master was detected as a "Communist."
When this did not stand up, he
was detected as a tool for the

Individualism. Responsibility
Re-examined by Miss Smith
To the Editor
In Miss Yenawine‘s letter of‘
last week the Grinnell sludentsl
were accused of an egocentric in-l
dlvidualism which packs the (18-:
free oi personal responsibility
which is, according to her, devil-‘
able. Surely personal responding its cannon be stuffed at — and law ‘
students would I believe, deny that .
it. is describe but Miss Yenawinel
has used it internationally vital
responsibility for others, and a distinction, I think. must be made.
The governance that the new
breed of individualism which has
dropped up in the last several‘
years packs an element oi region-l
mobility to others is somewhat wellfounded. There is, among many
students, an unwillingness to take:
responsibility for the behavior or
others or to be responsible to others for their own behavior. Per?
local responsibility implies a will»
illness to take responsibility iori
one’s own actions, is it possible to
have both? I doubt it. I can be re—
sponsored for my own behavior
only if i am tree to do so (note,
please, the “positive” use of the
word “free"), and I cannon be free
to do so if I am being constantly
targeted by others who reel equally called upon to be my guardian.
The only way in which the two
kinds of responsibility can be can
existing to the same degree is it
every individual evaluated his be
having in the same way as do his
peers. Gl'innell. thank God, is still
far from that situation.
Concern for fellow students' welfare is another of Miss Yenawme's
press. Welfare. it seems to me, refers to the Creation of Cami ons

“Leave him alone, Warren the clock, We're in

Memphis ‘liberal Cily' Say LeMoyne GrinneIIians
(Ed Note: The following is the
confirmation or a report from LeMoyiio College by Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens, Grinnell students
who are studying at the Memphis
college this semester.)
In suite of its providing to the
intake oi Mississippi, Memphis
is a liberal city and most of its
citizens are proud of the progress which has been made
here. We have experienced only
a new examples of an absent
segregationist belief.
Our first encounter was with
a white taxi driver of the stats
are of Ichabod trade, who we
asked Without thinking to take
us to LeMoyne College. His img
message reaction, which is still
quite clear in mind, was:
"What do y'all want to go to a
bigger school like that for?“
When coming back to Le
wayne late one night, we
changed to catch a bus on
which we were the only two
passengers, The bus driver’s
comments on civil rights ran
like this: “You probably don't
know any figures. (He decor»
sized our northern accent.)
They're violent people. How’d
.you like to have one for your
boss?"
What do these people have in
common? Fear of a violent, in.
sense people. Pride in a leather
culture. which means simply a
higher standard of living because of better economic opportunities. Belief in the convention that the metro is by nature crude, brutal, dirty. base.
discovery, interior.
We asked the question, which
to us has an obvious answer:
“But inn't the turbulence 0f the
metro a product oi his environ
ment? If he had equal employment opportunities, worlds’t it
be different?"
But the obviouit is denied.
Other questions are answered
as if they were being read off
the segregationist ﬂash cards.
 
Throughout the conversation
there is a carefully apparent
lack of reliance upon reason
and fact other than personal
experience. The only defense
offered for legislation is an
vocational emotional appeal and
a value reference to a cabin of
life.
There are other sequences of
legislation in Memphis, however, Two weeks ago one of the
largest churches in the city, the
Second Presbyterian Church,
with a membership of 3,600 in
healthy east Memphis, opened
its doors for the first time to a
metro. The papers reported the
event in the following manner:
“No one seemed to pay any attention to the lone metro who
was in the harmony." However,
as a direct result of this event,
200 members quit the congress-
tion to form a fundamentalist
Bible group. It is still to be determined Whether a mixed
group will be allowed to enter
the church. As in this church,

way necessary — in problems
of a personal, financial, or
cultural nature."
risk explained that foreign
students come to Grinnell under the auspices of many di recent programs, and it is the
duty of the FSB to keep in
touch with them and their
needs.
“Our goal is to have each
foreign student make himself
sufficient In our society,” risk
 
said. “If they are self»sun‘ancient when they got here," he
continued, "we do not have a
great deal of concern With
them”
The_ FSB does not plan activities for the foreign students.
Rather, it works with them under a policy which calls for the
board to make itself available,
and encourage foreign students
to arrange their own activities.
it frequently assists foreign
students, however, with financial and cultural problems. All
of its activities are handled on
a personal and confidential baSlSr
An interesting part of the
work, which the maintenance
of the Pepsi machines involves,
is that the “supply boys” who
work with risk find it their
duty to check the pop machines
in Loose hall basement, to see,
of course, that they are properly filled. When questioned.
these students, lenders Webb

"I’m sorry. we don't serve

and out of place in this situation.
One white Mississippiau said
that all the degrees he knew

James Meredith for forming the
situation the way he did. A
white middle class couple told
us of a social structure in which
a good name was the most important thing. This is the aristocracy and the good name is
its tradition. Here the place of
the metro is in the homes the
