‘ Generally, on this campus, speakers come and go.
Too many make too little impact on the student body.
They don’t spend enough time here or the students
'don’t take time to see them or their appearance inn’t
publicized because of lack of funds and initiative or
people just don’t care. In the case of Sunday chapel
speakers in particular, the time is short and often interactive. The guest speeds one hour before‘students,
and queries to catch the next flight out of Des points.
The students have a name on the calendar and a person title on the announcement board in front of Her—
rick. Regular attending go to chapel as usual, others
attend downtown churches, and too many others stay
in bed. Thus, another Sunday person is by the boards.
i This week, however, someone cards, Van Spurgeon,
young dynamic campus minister from Oklahoma State
is coming—not only for Sunday chapel services, but
for a two-day campus visit, Students care. Those who
have met Van are excited about their friends, meeting
and hearing him. They know that there will be controversy about what he says, and they look forward
to the discussion that interested students can bring
about. They have kept in contact with Van during the
past weeks. Telling him that their main interest in the
trip lies in international relations, they have scheduled
a picnic, a function, a panel, and several informal discussions where students and guest can meet and feel
at ease. They are pages for everyone to hear the Sunday person so that they might be prepared to meet Van
on a more personal basis later.
Van, too, cards. He wants to meet the students and
to know them. For several weeks he has been receiving
copies of the S & B so that he can familiarize himself
somewhat with Grinnell and her people. To fashion his
service as one completely for the students that he is
seeking to reach, he has made changes in the regular
run of the chapel program. (Three homes will be song
by the conservation instead of two, and more respective reading.) He will be living in a residence hall in
order to make himself available to students at all times
during his visit.
This is hardly a plea to get everyone to attend
chapel this Sunday or any other. Let it serve more as
a notice that people do care about this speaker and that
the speaker cards about Grinnell. Rather than a onestand performance, the visit of Van Spurgeon should
he a worthwhile experience for all students.
It seems remarkable for students to say that they
can’t afford the time to hear speakers on Sunday morning, and then to spend that time sleeping or haphazardly gaming at a book. Perhaps students should learn how
to make time rather than waste it. This weekend you
can afford the time to care.

Miscellany and regression
By Tom builder
The step taken by the college
last Week to join the city in
switching to “fast” or “daylight savings” time must be
viewed with mixed emotions.
It is heartwarming to have
proof that some college offer
girls are aware that there is a
world outside of, the college.
Nevertheless, it is readily apparent that this recent decision by the college was made in
a highly nasty manner without
proper consideration of the

First of all, there is the surely practical consideration oi the
changing of the clocks. automatically, before the switch
Grinnell was (in Central stand

standard about time at Grillhell was that at any given instant no two Grinnell College
clocks showed the same time.

ago.

ify which Clock he was using as
a basis. The United States has

Well over 30.
But the problem of synchror
living the clocks pages to insignificance when compared to
 
other problems created by the
switch which may well have
proposed effects on the sociological lives of the cornell students. .
For example, those couples
who have been dating regularly
are upset because there will be
an hour less of darkness before women’s hours. They
would have preferred a south
to “daylight waiting" or ‘slow”
time.
But perhaps the most significant influence the change Will
have will be in the area of
study habits. And here the ei—
fact could be disastrous. For I
venture to say that the normal

try hour of straight for purposes of recreation rather than
study. As a result, the quality
of Work will decrease and the
reputation of the college Willsuffer. i
It is still not too late for the
college to reverse its decision.

Anku on Ghana Economy
By since Anku
This week I am dealing with
Ghana’s economic policy which
is alleged by some pseudo-excel-ts to be communities, Next
Week We shall examine Ghana's
foreign policy.
There are five sectors in
Ghana's economy: " 1) In the
state’s sector enterprises are
entirely state-owned. This includes such industries as a soap
factory and a june bag factory.
The railways and airfare are
government owned. in addition
to the food produced by small
private farmers, the government produces food on 105 state
farms using modern lauderdale. technological methods.
Four of these are run by soviet experts and three, by iso‘all. The lesbians and Israelis are not to be the only foreignr
era to help implement Ghana’s
agricultural revolution—a revolution which is supposed to take
place on the individual farms
as much as on state farms or
corporations. The U. S. recently sent over 250 tons oi agricultural supplies, under the U. 5.
technical assistance program,
to be used at ﬁve new training
centers for farmers,
2) The joint State - private
sector is managed by an agree-
ment between the government
and private investors of copy ‘
tax. Ghana's biggest single in- ‘
district project is the $197 million delta hydroelectric project, The new dam is being changed on a littyeiiity basis by
Ghania‘and following sources:
the World Bank, the United '
States and Britain.
“The following information is
continued from The New York
Times, January 20, 1964, page
67.
3) In the cooperative sector '
the organizations are affiliated
with the National Cooperative
Council. This is more or less
like American farmers' corporations. Government subscribe
are available it groups want
them. Some batteries and part
oi the internal transportation
system are owned on such a ,
basis.
4) The private enterprise sector is a segment of the economy open to private investors.
Many hotels and huge reports
ment stores are in this category. Another good example is
the delta Aluminum Company‘s
shelter at Tema, the most
modern and well-equipped harbor on the West African coast.

the program strong support.”
After passing the proposal for
a social increase, Senators be»
can the serious task of reviewing organizations' proposed
budgets for the coming financial year, Jim harrison, Speaker of the Senate, had the difficult job of providing the Senate
with a sense of direction during this long secretary meet—
ing, harrison and the Senate
performed available; some or
the more important results of
the meeting follow:
1. The Senate agreed with
the Executive Cabinet that
the Social Coordinator should
receive a salary of $200. The
Social Coordinator worked
without pay last year, but it
was felt that he reserved a
salary since he is responsible
for a budget of over $40,000
and is responsible for the occurrence of social events
every week of the school year.
2, The Senate deleted 3l,0|)0
from the proposed Gadabouts
budget. This money was to be
spent on a dance, but the Senate felt that the College could
either do With one less dance
or without a "name" band.
.3. Five hundred dollars was
added to the proposed budget
of the Informal Social Committee. This money will be
spent to provide more bowling
and pool and to repair the
cabin at Lake Acre.
4. Four hundred dollars was
added to proposed residence
hall obligations.
5. Although the proposed
5,6 A. budget was passed, in
two weeks the Senate will de-
code whether it wishes to
spend two hundred and sevelityriive dollars to remain in
 
the National Student estonia-
tion,
At 9:30. marilyn Alt moved
that the Senate appropriate ten
dollars and buy pizza for the
body, There was some debate
as to whether the pizza should
be bathroom or massage; however, a “special deal” was
made {or massage pizza and the
august body was without hunger
by ten o’clock.
Oh yes, a car rule resolution
was also passed:
THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
STUDENT SENATE,
NOTING that the student
body has always understood
that the car-scholarship rule
was a conduct regulation, and
that violations of it would be
finished in the same way as
any other conduct rule, and
NOTlNG that college officials
have handled a recent Violation
of this rule as a ﬁspecial regu—
nation, violation of which is
cause for a loss of scholarship
aid, and
NOTING that considerable
confusion still exists within the
student body as to the intent of
the rule and the consequences
of its violation,
REQUESTS thorough review
of the rule itself, in the light of
this first year’s experience, and
REQUESTS that the present
rule be clearly defined, with attention to:
a. The consequences of a
violation of the rule.
b, The offices responsible
for the administration of the
rule,
c. The procedures to be
used in handling any violation
or request for exemption, and
REQUESTS that all other college regulations be reviewed
for areas of ambiguity and Confusion, and that they be fully
qualified, and

the metro people new hope and
a renewal faith in America.
streaming the important factor
of “Now" in this struggle, Law
is declared that the metro
people refuse to be patient, and
will not wait until a new election takes place. The degrees,
he pointed out, are much more
concerned with who is elected
Sheriff and appointed Chief of
Police than with who lives in
the White House.
“This movement started with
demands for camcorders and
theatre tickets," he reminder
his audience. “Now we are, demanding the right to vote and
have a decent job." He deClared that the days of a “tea
and cookie" relationship between White and metro
where an articulate, well-educated member of the metro society met with white leaders to
exchange restaurants: of their
“good" relationships are
past. The passes are involved
now, he emphasized, not just
the welledressed, articulate see
gm.
Lewis spoke bitterly or ratings to maintain law and order.
”We’ve had order and no law,"
 
he said. ”That order was ‘be
patient.’ We have a mandate
from history, from our forefathers and from God Almighty
to deliberately history this or«
der. . . . We must continue to
private."
trying participation by both
degrees and suites, Lewis cler
placed that “we struggle not
against people, but a system.
This is not a war of hate between blacks and writes, It
must be nonvviolenl." He forestry a community of brotherhood and love as the goal.
“The only real and true integration we have in America today is within the movement it»
self. These people are making
life worth living," Lewis declared. He spoke of the Mississippi Project attending poverty
and destination as a major part
of this ”long, hot and disappointed summer oi decision." He
talked about this project of
1000-3000 students as a ”consistent army," and a combination between a “domestic Peace
Corps and guerilla war-fare."
This project is sponsored country by tour Civil Rights Groups

Literary criticism has become so complex in scope that
critics of critics, as well as
“mere" critics, have become a
common phenomenon. Such a
phenomenon, Professor Murray trigger, suffered the critical scene before the Annual
Writers’ Conference last Friday
and Saturday afternoon.
in his first lecture, entitled
"Newer and Older critical,"
Mr. trigger studied the thirty
diploma contracting the student of literature; must he
choose between the older "historical“ and the newer “conceptual” approaches to litera.

In his second lecture, entitled
”The Poetic Context and the
substantial C O n t e X t," MI.
trigger proposed a solution to
the historical-conceptual diploma; he explained the audi.

this method of dealing with literature in the last Chapters or
his newest book, entitled “A
Window to Criticism: Shake<

Mr. trigger has style in his
approach to featuring. but especially writing. We need only
quote from his impressive
book, “The arabic Vision," to
demonstrate that style. Finishing his survey of modern literature, he remarks: ”. , . a rich

which I hope you will be able to
help us solve." However, his
biggest problem is lines. Only
collaborative beds have sheets,
and surgical drives must be caused. “Our male and female civilian cards have no lines at
all. . . . The lots each have
from two to five patients on
them. . . . I do hope something
does come of this (the fund
drive) but I realize how large
an advertising this is.”
The Norton Fund sponsored
by the Grinnell Ministerial Association with the Jr. Chamber
of Commerce has a goal of
$7500 to meet the acute need,
which also includes automatic
masters and orders to aid in
the difficult job of cleaning
lines in such a human climate.
The Board of Religion and IRC

Norton said to Look, “Some
people back in the States do
nothing but want about communist. In a way, we’re lucky
here. We can do something
about it.”

The shelter will be built and

interests. The New York
Times, January 20, 1964) In
suite of this obvious evidence
of private investment, the
January 9, 1964 issue of the Des
points Register accused Ghana
of rating “total war“ on capitalism. It should be noted in
answer to this attack that according to the recent Capital
Investment Act, Ghana makes
generous conclusions to private
investors. It has recently passed
legislation encouraging private
investment. Act 172 of the Benefits Laws to Foreign Industries includes a tax “holiday"
of up to ten years and generous capital appliances for use
after the tax “holiday." The
Act includes reductions from
capable income for scientific
research. It also provides‘ exemption from indirect taxes for
certain projects such as those
which produce domestic goods
for export to replace imports.
It projects investments from
expropriation and allows the

free transfer abroad of the profits after tax liabilities have
been satisfied. The government
recently published the law requiring reinvestment of sixth
percent of all profits in Ghana.
This is the trend Which the Des
points Register of January 9,
1964, called the irreversible
trend toward a largest state.
6) Small-scale private capital
is included under the workers
sector of Ghana’s economy.
This segment includes private
ownership of small businesses
by shop owners, crop farmers,
factors, and cloth servers. A
Communist government would
not allow its subjects to participate so freely in a mixed economy. The above sectors constitute the economic aspects of
African mechanism.
An eye-witness, St. ClairDrake of Chicago, made the
following remarks about African mechanism:
". . . African mechanism in
Ghana is .what Nitrumah says
it is, not what Khrushchev or
Tito or sao or Castro say it is.
There is no communist party
in Ghana and the Convention
Peoples’ Party is not one of the
81 parties which make up the
international Communist movement.
 
All Soviet satellites have his
dissoluable economic b o n d s
which tie them to the dominant:
country. Ghana has no such ties
with either the U. S. S. R. or
China. Less man 10 per cent of
her exports and imports involve columnists, and the
bulk of Ghana’s valuable color
crop is sold in the West.
Since 1960 Ghana has tried
to free herself from the risk of
chronic price playstation in the
West and a possibility of suffering from future depression by
publication trade ties with the
East to balance off those with‘

For those who are competition about the student-faculty
relations, the states of the econon-pics and political science departments have taken a step in
the right direction The marcus
Room in Carnegie has been the
scene of nickel coffee and informal conversations between
students and processors every
class day morning from 9:30 to
10:30 since last falls Each of
the processors seems to view
the conversations a little bit differently, but most agree they
have been a success for those
who have participated.
The purpose of the coffee
hour is to provide an informal
gemogether for political science
and economics motors and the
processors of those departments
to discuss anything of common
interest. The topics range from
current national and international news to campus gripesr
Paul Smith (poll, sci.) sees the
coffee hours as a means of giving political science motors
more of a feeling of community
and awareness of their field on
a non-professional basis; he 31»
streets the discussions should
be used for course evaluation.
Robert coleman (icon) prefer the coffee hour because he
dress't like to walk all the way
to the union; besides, “You
know, it‘s niger when you can
talk to someone." in a more
serious vein, however, both
coleman and James pages
(pci. sci.) feel that it is up to
the students to take advantage
of this opportunity. Few students have ever given the pro»
gray a try.
pages sees many possibilities
for the program but'is some

The coffee hour is supposed
to be self-supporting, but i-saver
man noted that “total cost ex—
needs total revenue" pages
added, “fighting unit cost, total
costs and that sort of thing is
the job of the economics department."
As far as suggestions for improvement go, coleman suggested Charging Go a Cup so that
 
a subscription to the New York
Times could be sent to the marcus Room as a base for more of
the discussions, He feels that
the subjects talked about are

Smith suggested that more
women attend.
Student comments had much
greater range. David Burkholdor said that he thinks the eco»

the coffee hour Is a contributing
factor. Andy Goldstein said,
“The coffee master like mud,

the competition They opened
the show since North counter
had the “honors,” after relating
the traveling trophy last year.
While this chorus may have not
been equal to the Cleveland»
Cowles effort in such things as
audience appeal and eligibility, they were certainly equal,
If not better, in their arrangements, difficulty, and performance of the numbers they se»
tested,
Third place was captured by
ﬂages and watson calls with
the theme “Spectrum of Song."
Their selections included
"Black is the Color," “Cherry

by “Piglet." ,
A highlight of the performance of these second readers
