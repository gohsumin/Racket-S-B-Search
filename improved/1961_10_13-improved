Men 0r Marmalade?
Men have always loved to label. allen have labelled
with equal real everything from plus presented and packs
ages to races, religions and beliefs. We have little argument
with the plus preserve people. Where this sort of thing
can become dangerous however, is outside of tale kitchen
or the posteoffice, in history books, the arguments of care
less delivers and on the college campus.
, Jiidx‘ ”null. sum FM“
One such wireless form of modelling seems to be occur—
ring presently at Grinnell. Some people are delivering iii
pointing fingers and closely designing" tale titles of ”Conservative” and “liberal” to almost everything and everyone
\in sight. It seems to us that these are rather strange lines
of description on a campus dedicated to liberal education,
a campus where so many shades of belief ex t.
Furthermore, nobody seems to be very sure just what
these labels mean. The best we have been able to get from
the average Grinnellian who is freely using these terms are
personal references. “So and So is a conservative” ”So and
So is a liberal.”
, Last week‘s “Forum for present” suggests a specific
instance of dﬁigerous modelling in the college community.
modelling processors according to supposed political beliefs
can lead to the worst sort of academic capacity. Would it
not be contrary to everything this college stands for if
processors were hired on the basis of their political art"uses rather than their abilities in various fields? The
extremes of tapeerecorders iii the classroom, compression of
opinion and eventually loss of academic freedom are only
steps away from this kind of thinking.
It is interesting to see how wireless sorts of modelling
fall down in practice. An example of this was seen at a recent coffee hour when two processors, supposed ”minerals”,
took almost opposite positions on the Berlin crisis. One believed that negotiation must go on, and that we might in
fact have to withdraw from Berlin; one felt that nigeria—
tion was no longer possible.
We have never encountered a professor who made an
editorial remark iii class that he did not identify as just
tliati The problem among some of our population seems to
be a lack of perception in distinguishing the editorial re—
mark from the intervention remark. Such problems as the
“Forum" sections arise, not from increased editorializing
on the part of the professor, it would seem, but earlier, from
the business of the student who does not carefully investigate the permanent classroom material. We must remember
that few significant faculty changes have been made in the
last four years to warrant the strange reaction \vliicliisnow
occurring. Furthermore, never in all our four years at print
hell, have we rilii into a classroom situation wllere all views
were not given “equal time". We have seen papers pure
posting positions on the right and positions on the left receive D‘s and we have seen both kinds of papers receive A's.
It is true, of course, that there are those students and
faculty with political views which might be easily located,
either to the left or right of center, and we are by no
means suggesting that people become wisliyewashy or silent
about their beliefs. What we object to are those few wireless critics who refuse to remember that there are countries
pigeonholes within the pigeonlioles acid beliefs within beliefs, and that there are Vast unexpected areas of thought
which can hardly be announced for by only one or two
names which we have hardly begun to define.
What lies behind this sentence to label is the apparent
need to escape the couple. ties of our 20th Century exit—
hence, by seeing everything as either black or white, and
examining our world as a place where good guys and bad
guys are the only inhabitants. We cannon escape reality so
easily without doing ourselves grave harm. The world
is not that simple, and we must face its challenges forestry,
and carefully. We must re-consider‘ our labels and accused
tions. People are just not plus presented.

Ed. Note: For those of you
who are new to the Grinnell
campus, Howard it, Biirklc,
professor of philosophy and
religion, is presently on leave
from (ii-iiiiicll, spending time
at International Christian University in Tokyo. What follows
is a recent letter from Burklc
giving some of his observe—
tions and insights into the environment of the Japanese
university.
by Howard gui-llc
We thought that it might be
of some interest to Grinncll
students to hear something
about their couiilci-parts in this
Japanese university, particularly
ascii- thinking on recent index»
national events.
Since the Japanese school
begins iii the spring. the fall
term is only a confirmation of
the current school year and
therefore packs the quality of
prisoners which compounds the
opening of school in the USA.
Here the books have already
been bought, the courses long
ago registered for and the
series of this year‘s freshman
class (the best in history . . .
only those from the upper lcd
per cent of their classes, etc.)
have been song. Out of phase,
we Americans came upon ilic

Yet there is something new
in the pic. The Russian decision to resume nuclear testing and the American decision
to follow suit struck shortly

these never for a moment let
you forget that they alone
have experienced the destruction of nuclear explosion.
All political pop-ties are united
in their open and explicit op.
position to the manufacture,
testing or use of nuclear weapons. Even the Communist party,
which is a tiny minority usual
ly locally improving whatever
tllc Soviet Union is doing, felt
completed to express degree at
this Soviet decision. All of‘ this
keeps the Japanese public aglr

not- widely accused, but they
are. as one communist i~country

Thus, the statement against

All of this provides the background for lCU’s particular code
