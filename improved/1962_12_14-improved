This Concerned student sites

are effort of “A Concerned
Student," (in the Dec. 7 soon),
we agree with that humanities
professor who said that he
“looks for too many angels."
1T 15 TRUE that nearly everyone has legitimate prices
about “intro” courses and hu—
families, or about a few processors in his first two years.
lBut why concern the whole

processors?
We also disagree with “Coucernerl’s“ r e complications.
We do not think that the students in general—and “Concerned" in particular are qualified to determine such a
serious matter as a professor’s salary.
"Concerned" also asks that
processors “do research on their
ow n time." Each professor
teaches about three courses, for
which he must grade papers
and exams, prepare lectures or
at least guidelines for discussion, and read every bit as
much as the students, simply
in the access of teaching his
course,
Also, he will probably have
committee and faculty meets
inns, give extra lectures, and
have conferences or discussions with students now
much time are processors ex—
posted to give us?
At the risk of being called
members of the “mutual activation society,” we would
like to suggest that “Concerned” get off this writing kick
and help the President and processors make Grinnell the outstanding college it can be.

After shopping two away code
tests, to Lawrence and simon,
,Knox trusted both highly rated
iCoe and Beloit last weekend,
THE SIWASHEns rely main—
ly on a fast break, passing offense, and employ a zone and
sense.
Grinnell coach John deutsch
expects to run up against a zone
defense tonight, since the Pin»
needs were unable to father
simIlar releases used by Carleton and Cornell.
PFITSCH FEELS that the
Knox game will be a real challenge. Having taken only one of
,the first four contests has led
to a mobile problem on the team,
and a victory now is necessary
if the boys are to snap out of it
He said the squad recognized
the “need to come back", and
declared “We’re not throwing
in the spouse. People will
know about us before where
through this year."
Following the game tonight
the team WIIl get a short vaca—
part in a holiday tournament to
be held in Grinnell December
23 29 The Pioneers won the
tournament last year, heating out
’Knox, Chicago, and Colorado

entrance.
On January 3 the Pioneers
,will play at Beloit.
