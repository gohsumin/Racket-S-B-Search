When President Monroe sent

for future organization by any
European power . . . we should
consider any attempt on their
part to extend their system to
any portion or this atmosphere
as dangerous to our peace and
safety . . . "
Thc Monroe Doctrine was a
statement promoted by concern
for the security at the US, not
by concern for the fate oi the
newly independent Latin Ameri—
can countries; the statement
was directed at European, not
,at Latin American ears. The
US would be much saver with
small independent nations as
neighbors than with large
European colonial. Following
the presentation oi the Doc.
tribe, the relative "peace and
sa.y in the western atmosphere was actually guaranteed
by British control of the seas.
in the 19th century, two important and lasting attitudes
toward the Monroe Doctrine
evolved in the us. The first,
influenced by the moral over—
tones oi the doctrine: the big
brother attitude; the second,

In Latin America there were
also two general attitudes its—
tired by us actions and the
Monroe Doctrine. There was a
certain tear of European inter-

appreciation attitude, an acceptance oi the original statement
of the Doctrine. The other anti—

US to help her in a dispute
with Britain, but she was certainly also destruction or how
Pres. Cleveland might l-winter‘r

the case, even though the
British typically proved that due
ing so was stretching the point

Teddy Roosevelt's correlation
and the era ol Dollar Diplo—
many.
Roosevelt's correlation added
to the Doctrine the right oi the
US to exercise police power in

that deals were paid, modern:

President Wilson introduced a

or de jury recognition had the

Largely as a result oi his I

Latin America (the first by

an active interest in Latin

It is easy to see why Dr. pass

ing the are of his fellow humans‘
by receiving to the history of
US»ciiban relations, participation
the plant Amendment. The point,
must be made clear that in sucks
cases the imperialism ot the US
was almost entirely economic,
not political, Although there
were several chances, and ab;
ways pressure to do so. the US:
did not annex Cuba, The case:
as many similar ones, has proved
.that this type ot tie is far ski'ongg
er than political ties.
The common Latin American
future oi the US as the coin»
sciously imperialistic Colossus
or the North is as false as the i
common Us picture of Latin
America as a barely civilized
jungle.
The history oi' the diplomatic
relations between the US and
the Latin American countries his‘
much more a story or reflect
than of conscious imperialism
en the part of the US. a story
of coming with diplomatic proc—
less caused by short-range pop—
acres directed by immediate selfinterest, a story of mutual insurance and misunderstanding o:
the social, cconornic, and political
conditions which have giving' e‘
to the historical. political pr :specs in the US and in Latin
America.

join-i, top inn nomination and

up. But because ot its (actual,
relative calm approach, “Anais
only" is by far the better of
the two as a study aid for the
Latin American conference,
Both books show an optimize
toward the progress or the
human revolution. Mills and
tubes‘man and SW y hold
great hopes for the admittedly
undertake future In suite of
this, "Anatomy” implies a fathers disheartening likelihood. If
consolidation and naiionallzationl
continue in Latin America, there:
is, according to “Anatomy,”
little hope that ilic United States
will take Cuba as a "lesson” in
bad policy and go on to lead
the rest of Latin America to
political democracy and economic independence. ‘
“Big business interests
which are already suffering
losses as a result of the
human revolution and stand
to lose so much more from its
spread to Latin America . . .
will not strange to use any
and all methods to attack its

In other words. it. as both}
books inside, United States policy:
is strongly influenced or event
determined by the interests or
big business it seems that the‘
ideals and principles of demand}
race have taken a back seat‘
to the possibilities of profit, This‘
is a started opinion but that'

enough to give these views full‘
