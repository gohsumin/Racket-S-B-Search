Where is the counselingpros
gray at Grinnell headed? Ac
working to Grinnell's Dean of
Students, monkey M. combo,
the movement within the pro
gray now is toward providing
as much variety as possible
in the forms of counseling
, available, in order moment the
needs of individuals in a heterogeneous campus community. This is the first inn series
of articles examining these
services and focusing on the
current developments which
will shape counseling at print
well in the future.
Much of the current counsel»
ing activity is related to the
offices of the means of study
ends. Dean combo, Associate
Dean Jean kinds, and ASSlSt’
ant Dean pic MacDowell are
all available to any student
who desired counseling providence, although each does
work in separate as well as
incorporated areas.
combo, a teacher for ten
years in the Gary, Indiana
public school system and our
gently enrolled in a doctoral
program inadministration and
higher 611than at the Unis
version of Iowa, is actively
involved in the development of
a variety of counseling server
yes at Grinnell. He believes
it is necessary to have different kinds of counseling be‘
cause a personality conflict
may not allow a student to
get the help he needs from a
particular connector.
The resident-advisory sysr
tel, under the guidance often
means of Students, exemplifies the emphasis on variety.
Concerning selection of the
resident advisors for this
year, combo says thats dear
white effort was made to get a
well‘qualified but varied
group of young, interested
people able to work with students and relate to their needs.
They are to try, with the SEU'
cents, to improve the living
situations within the calls, not
through disciplinary tactics,
but through a loiowledge ofgroup living. Mr. combo sees
life within the calls and the
R.A.'s role as primary areas
for consideration andimproc
cement in the counseling program.

which is admitted bytes wins
once Committee to a number
of campus funds which cover
the activities just mentioned
plus many,more. During the
Senate meetings of October 5
and 6 the Senate, largely usr
noticed by the rest often cam—
put, approved a budget which
allocated $55,335 ofyour money to the various funds.
Well over half the budget
(some $32,800) went into the
hands of the Social Coordinar
king Committee, a group of
' seven salaries students (headed by Peter Keepnews)whose
job it is to decide what sort of
entertainment will be brought
to campus this year. Besides
$900 for salaries, money was
admitted for movies ($6050),
the Forum Coffee House
($300), small concerts
($4000), informal recreation
($400), and a general Social
coordination Fund ($1100).
The largest single chuck($20,
000) went into the Concerts
fund, headed by Concerts chairman RonaldStanford, tours
ing to campus such entertaining as the East River author
logo and Big Mama Thornton.
The second largest area of
the budget was Publications
and Radio. KDIC received
$3300, $1800 of which is al»
posted for the salaries of the
six members of the executive
board. The charles and Black
received an approximately of
$5500. $1000 of the charles
and Black money is spent for
the salaries of the Editor and
Business Manager.
A total of $900 was appropriated for the Student nudity
or's office ($500 for the say-
- are of Student AudltOI’Rle
Deyo), and $2000 each for the
Speaker's Fund and the newly
created Senate Fund, a "last
chance" fund to which student
groups can apply for money if
their particular request does
not fit under the definition of
any of the other campus funds.
One of the major issues face
ing the Finance Committee
this year was the question of
whether or not the college
should allow student funds to
go for the purchasing ofliquor.
Last year virtually oneethird
of the Initiative Fund money
was spent for alcoholic bed’
images. After considering the
legal and practical aspects of
the problem, the Finance
Committee voted lhatmoney it
appropriated would not be
spent for any alcoholic beverages, this decision to be
informed by the Student audio
for, who will carefully scrutinize purchase receives. With
this in mind, the Committee
admitted $4000 for the Initia~
,time Fund, to be administered
by the Initiative Fund com*
little under previously'set
guidelines.
The nature of the Hall A1107
nation fund was changed this
year. Rather than being used
for the purchase ofhallnewsr
paper subscriptions, repairs
of hall damages, and new equr
moment, the fund is now intended to be onlya source ofmoney,
for group hall activities, such
as hall parties, cancer, etc.
$1800 was appropriated to be
divided among the various
calls. To cover the previously mentioned hall extended
turns, a joint Council offense
treatments , Associated WoV
men Students fund was created, to be administered by
both organizations. The total
was set at $1500.
$2535 was also admitted to
the Student Government Association itself, the 1urge part
of it ($2050) for salaries often
various SGA officers. For several years the traditional
salaries of SGA officers had
been: $300 for SGA President;
$250 each for C of HP Presir
sent, AWS President, and Student Coordinator; $200 for the
SGA Secretary; and $100 each
for two Student Coordinator
assistance. This year the Finance Committee felt that such
salaries were too low in view
of the level of some of the
other salariesaround campus,
specifically those of the SStB
Editor and Business Manager,
the Student Auditor, and the
executive board of the radio
station. The Finance Commit‘
tee recommended includes
in SGA salaries to the follows
ing levels: $500 each for SGA
President and Student door-'

A step in the right direction
in the fight against local pop—
action is Grinnell's iniZEIdlS’
ciplinary effort, the LEAP
program. This is a core grr
our of 29 students and five
faculty from several departments who hope to develop a
package program to combat
pollution which could be offered to other communities
similar to Grinnell.
The LEAP group was organized last springbutactivedata

and faculty worked on general

developed plans for itsactivi‘

also compiled.
This semester is mainly cons

gathering, initial testing, and
analysis. Some ideas for re
cycling and pollution solutions
are according considered. The
second semester will be oriented more towards solving
some of the problems defined
during this fall's investing-

tions. Action will be taken that
will include experimental recycling and other plans. During the second semester es
sexually widespread campus
involvement will be essential
for the program's success.
Student interest and cooperation so far have been very
good and its continually will
be increasingly vital.
LEAP is composed of several main groups each headed
by a faculty member and has

core. These groups are: the
solid wanted group headed by
Kenneth christopher of the
biology department; the chef
local waste group headed by
Gene hobbies of the chemistry department; the ICE (in

it had little chance of passage, and that the faculty should be looking for something

Chairman Joseph Wall spoke

modification in debate endangered by a platform of faculty

depression: Canada . . .
announced acid the remarkable apache that has threaded
Grinnell students to an unusual degree (even for them) this fall
has been a major event on the internationalscene that has grave
content for civil libraries andsocial change in the United States.
I speak of the extraordinary innovation of the War Measures
Act by Premier Pierre Trudeau of Canada in order to deal with
the terrorism (and the two recent kidnapings) by Le Front de
generation de Quebec (FLQ) and the complete equanimity with
which that action was received by the Canadian people.
The War Measures Act, previously used only during WWI&II,
allows the government to arrest anyone without a warrant and
to hold them without charge for up to 21 days. Trudeau, in
accounting the new powers (which did not require parliament
mary,approval for institution), saidthatarrests boulder limited
to FLQ members and "sympathizers." However, the highest
estimates of active FLQ membership have been about 120;
more than 430 persons have been arrested (of which number
more than 175 have been released, leaving at least 250 still
imprisoned). There are anticipated2,000 "practice"members
of FLQ.
The War Measures Act has been used so far to justify more
than 1,600 rates on private homes, compression of any state
meets of support for the FLQ, proposition of the publishing in
Canadian newspapers of any FLQ statements, arrest of anyone
suspected of any association whatever with the FLQ. Students,
reporters, workers, politicians (two candidates for mayor of
Montreal were arrested) all have been arrested and face up to
five years in prison unless THEY um DISPROV'E even a remote
connection with or support for the FLQ.
The War Measures Act in Canada villages many of the basic
civil libraries that Americans (and vacations) have long taken
for granted. However, what little opposition thatwas expressed
to Trudeau's move was skilled after the murder of one of the
cottages, an'act that wasprovokedat least in part by the unduly
marsh measures invited by the government. Trudeau won a
confidence vote in parliament 190* 16, with the only opposition
' coming from a small minority of dentists who said the government was "using a sledgehammer to crack a planet."
For those who say.“ cannon happen beast-think twice. The
government is already doing its best to eliminate the Black
partners, and the public's extreme concern with law—recorder following this year's cash of bookings still tampa the
fees to take strong measures soon. The lack off backlash to
the suspension of civil libraries in (‘anadawill tampa American
politics leaders even more. Expressions of support that the
government has sent to Canada recently do not make me feel
any better.
In 1968 when 10 Mexican students were killed in listing in
Mexico City just before the Olympics, I required that sucks
tragedy could not happen here. It happened. Let Canada be a
better lesson for us all.

' Speaking of depression and allowing to Kent State, recent developments in Ohio immediately come to mind. As most of you
know, 25 students and faculty members have been infected by
grand jury and the National Guard has been whitewashed by the
same group. While scanner express surprise,my disney cannon
be mitchell. Will the beds allow the state to continue? Will the
Scranton Commission's institutes remain just that? Will the
newly- remained apache of college students allow the forces of
selective law and order to continue to makes society of their
own slovak? Remembering the Fred Hampton case in chicago
and watching the same pattern being repeated atJackson State,
I am afraid my questions become merely historical. it makes
renew's words sound like extreme understatements when he
says "Americans prefer repressiontoanarchy." Recent events
make one wonder if Americans area't ready to take which
promo's "Escape from Freedom." The burden seems too
great for them to bear.
Bill Thomas Explains Position
Dear Sir:
Last week in your paper an
article appeared indicating
that I might be a indicate for
the renewable ofﬁce of president of the Student Government Association. Much as I
am flattered by the thought
that I would be worthy of that
position, I feel that I must
make clear, as my response—
bility to the people of this fine
college, my position in regard
to the upcoming race,
I disable, firmly and unique
ivomlly, the statement thats
will probably run for SGA president. Although this would be
a wonderful opportunity for
me, and although I would certainly enjoy the experience of
serving our community, my
present assessment of opposition in the Grinnell political
sphere and my present projected commitments for the
forthcoming college year draw
me to the conclusion that l
would be unable to harvest
myself to the buddy of Student
Government.
The office of SGA president
is a grave response elite, one
not to be taken lighter, and
certainly one calling for the
highest degree of fact, notification, and plain old horse
sense. He that as it may, I
must report to the voters that
I am definitely not' currently
in the running.
yours for the people,“

LEAP, many of them by teaching garbage, reading odometers or gathering otherda‘
ta.
For this year at least, LEAP
is concentration on the called
ge's pollution problems. The
solid wanted group has completed one three week measuring period and plans to
start another after mid-semester break and a third in
December. This group is trying to determine ways of listening the considerable amount of solid wanted we produce at Grinnell. The possibility of trading paper and
selling it exists and bottles
and cars may be received.
All recycling plans, however,
are sensitive at this point.
There really is not enough information now to allow forany
extensive planning of solutions.
A survey of the forms willow
made after the mid- see break
by the chemical wanted group
to try to determine chemical
pollution and energy uses of
students. Hopefully, after learning how We became LEAP
will offer suggestions as to
how we can make our behavior less managing to the ecology.
Eventually LEAP hopes to
involve the town in its program and corporate with it in
developing a program for other small communities similar to Grinnell to combat their
pollution problems.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK
October 29, 1970
GriddersContinue To Roll, 22-21
The Big Red apparently likes
to play the close england give
everybody boundaries. Or
maybe the Pioneers like to
prove that they can win in the
church, that they can come up
with the Big Play whenever
they have to. Last week they
did it against nonrconference
for Beloit (non~ conference be
cause, contrary to concerns—
ce rules, Beloit is playing are
carmen on the variety football squad this year due to a
lack of variety bodies), by the
miniature margin ofonepoint,
22-21.
It looked as though Grinnell
would blow this game apart
early, as warning Bill Dicks
picked off a pass from tel‘
out's Jim Nitz on the fourth
play of the game. Shortly thereafter, Gorgeous Gary Johnson found maria Jim Firolr
li in the endzone witch secondary strike. When player kick—
er Twinkle-does Roy Lewis
missed the extra point, the
score was 6-0, Pioneers.Twinkle-does, in making right
his wrong, then put the kickoff into the end zone, where
Beloit's receivers tried a
handbook and reverse. HowV

The Freshman Football team

in their season's finals, 404).
This was definitely a moral
victory after last week’s
fiasco of a 76-0 root by the
Knox press. An unblemished
win column was not all this
announced squad is the professor of. It also is unblemished in their number of
points scored in one season,
0. A defensive record was set
also in that 149 points were
scored against them. This
breaks the record of 121
points,‘ set by the laSt 0-3
prep squad of 1966.
accordingly, there are some
good players on this team.
Especially the lincoln, who
will add greatly to nextyear's
team, according to Coach B07

ever, the reverse was failed
when the Big Red Machine's
kick~off team displayed rare
speed and packard Beloit's return man in the end-zone for
a safety, to run the score to
870. Grinnell then took the
listing free kick and drove in
for another score, with the big
play being a 37-yard bomb
from G.G. to Henry “the F1ash" Corona in the end zone.
This time, the PAT was good
and the Homecoming speakers were on top 15-0.
In the second quarter, Beloit
was driving, only to have ref—
fee Dick pick off a Nitz pass
on the Grinnell eight and luther all the way for a TD. her
lost, however, mae nightmare
to score, Nitz throwing 29
yards to Dick Bartolomei for
the home team's second tour
thrown. The first half ended
with Grinnell up 22-15.
The fourth quarter was somewhat silver, as Grinnell's
offense failed to score anymore, but Beloit’s did not.
With 6:21 left in the game,
their QB started over from
the one. Beloit then went for
all the parties and a two
point conversion. This time,
however, they were stopped
short and the score remained
22*21, Grinnell. Grinnell then
killed four and a halfminutes,
but Beloit wash’t through yet.
They mounted their finaldrive
of the day, and had victory in
their grass, when the phone
her’s great defense came up
with their fourth Big Play:
maria Jim picked off a Nitz
pass in the end zone with 21
seconds left.

meets the Redmen of simon.
Last year, Grinnell stungRipon with a relatively easy vic—
tony. It willow’erbe sosimple
this time around. However,
with the Pioneers' merchant
for pursuant the close ones,
and winning them, they won't
exactly be brown off the field,
either. Grinnell is fully mp“
able of making the Big Play.
The Pioneers should pull it
