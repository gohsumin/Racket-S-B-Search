air his views on the Moratorium. "I did not want to participate in the Moratorium, and
I’m not going to,” he said. “I’m
going to leave as soon as I
say this. . . .It’s good for us
to come up here and give good

“Don’t: we know already that

people have to address themselves to is to tactics. Going

"war had been brought home
to them.” Their former

brought face to face with con-
ﬂict, and changed or developed
in the process. They were surrounded by an atmosphere or
medication and urgency where

Many of them ended up staying at an SDS movement center where the military teachers

a raid, she spent twelve hours
in jail with Weathermen. She
discovered that she was free
only to have the “correct
thoughts.” “The Weathermen
are totally humanitarian — there
is no right to distant. Try to
discuss and you’re shorter
down." She said. “They’re the
most fastest organization I‘ve
ever come in contact with"
in contrast to the Weathermen's policies were the tactics oi another group, Revolutionary Youth Movement ll

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Freshman Describes Chicago Arrest
(The following letter was
written at the request of the
Sim editor.)
To the Editor:
On Thursday. Oct. 9, 1965, I
began my crinriiial lite. On
that day, the Chicago police ar—
tested me, gave me a ride in
a daddy wagon, sent me to a
Juvenile home, and for-red are
to return to Griunell.
Bciore describing my arrest,
I'll explain why I was in Chia
eago. As most students pi‘obnr
buy know by now, 505 called
itor massive anti—war and anti.
Conspiracy trial demonstra—
tions from Oct. 8-11. I drove
to Chicago with 9 other Grin—
ucll students to observe what
would happen and to parties—
page in what I hoped would be
peaceful demonstration.
We reached Chicago at about
2 o’clock Thursday morning,
and went to the church where
our group had been instructor
to report to by the military
Weatherman fiction oi 5135.
(Although we wanted to‘facilitate in some activities at
RYM-II, the more peaceful tax—
tion oi SDS, they had sent us
no information.) We then decided to go to McCormick Semi—
mary, where all-night dishes—
signs were supposedly being
held. The discussions were re—
portable about the significance
pt that night’s street fighting
between a now hundred Weathorinen and the Chicago copy;
item tactics were also supposed
to he discussed at McCormick.
When we reached actor—
pick. we found approximately
100 Weathermen in the gym—
valium; there were no organized discussions. Finally, after
about thirty minutes, a death—
el'man who had been in the
street ﬁrating came over and
explained to us what had happened. Ills explanation evolved
into a discussion, then an argue
ment, between a couple other
Weathermen and our group
about identifies and tactics,
This was the closest I ever
came to any lighting in chicago; it I had to take sides, 1
would have fought against the
Weathermen.
At six in the morning we all
want to sleep. The women were
supposed to get up at 7:30 to
participate in a raid on an
Army induction center, to des—
troy the center and the per.

another bulletin at a radio

the bulletin, but we headed

Chuck stopped, and the copy

found a make pack. and told me
I'd have to go inside.
Chuck told the cop that his
rather, a political, had given
him the make for protection
when he was hitchhiking, and
he had forgotten it was in the
car. at course. the cop didn’t
believe him; he knew Chuck
had brought the make to use
against the Chicago pics. though
he (the cop) never admitted
this. The cop asked me how
old I was; I‘sa‘id 17. He asked
it my parents knew I was in

They aim made me wash my

pair with the words “Andy
Home” on them. I’m keeping
these undertaken as a slovenia.
Until seven o’clock, i sat in
the small room with the other
girls (I was feeling something
like Arlo on the Group
bench), talked, and watched
TV, I wanted to study my
Aeschylus, but we women't :11lower to d. Aeschylus is too
dangerous, 1 guess. Many of the
girls there were runaways

The longteriu cases (a low

policewoman took me to the
bus station in a car. I had to
buy my own ticket; ii I hadn’t;
had the money, they would
have wanted for money from

was on the bus back to Grin—

morning.
Compared to the other Crinnell students arrested, I am the
luckiest, since 1 don’t face any

me later. But the reason I was

said they would probably
church her with negligence.
Everyone talks about the risks
at our s dirty becoming a
police state. But this should
make it clear that the police
already have more power over
an individual than one's par
ends do. The fact that I was
truly a political prisoner for
a few hours, the fact that I was
forced out of Chicago for no
valid reason. and the fact that
Chuck and Bill were also hr»
tested for ridiculous reasons,
are much more significant for
me than the other differences
of that day.
I‘m glad I went to Chicago.
In a few hours, I learned about
Weatherman. about the police,
and about myself. I would have

e.g , the drug statement, and the
faculty decision to not call out

from the students revealed
which issue was more important

Two further points were that
in the U.S., institutions have 0optical power. not individual;
and that it is power. not reason,

These points reply to me that
the time for selicentered opposition has long passed (handhelds

President's Statement on Student Decision-Making
' Publish” below are Presliient Glenn suggest’s remarks
about involving students In curriculum decision making; he
delivered them at a special
faculty meeting Sept. to. The
president said he delayed publication the statement because
he “didn’t want to raise students’ expectations before the
facultyi reached to the proposal."
In response to suggest’s statement, the faculty voted last
week to admit four studio re«

a) the relationship between student EPC representatives and
additional EPC committees.)
i want to talk for several
minutes about the ways»andmeans question of student participation in determining the
educational policy of the College We know there is and has
been for a long time a great
deal of indirect participation.
Students team quickly that the
best teachers teach the best
courses, and a successful career for any teacher at an institution such as Grinnell is
very much determined by his
ability to attract and continue
to interest good students His
reputation is created and decreased with every generation
of students. But what we have
come to mean over the past
few years by student participation is a more formal thing,
what we might call a strip<
tired device for seeing that
the student voice in college
government is constitutes rep
reserved. Such a structure.
though important and under
going continued revision, now
exists in many aspects of student affairs: in matters relating to student life in the re dance calls, in student discs

and management of public
events.
Student participation on additional EPC committees offers
some promise as a way of examining suggestions from students
on additional curriculum mittzero, but I think we should consider a more thoroughly developed structure for representing
student voice in college wide
educational policy. One reason
is our own mixture of feelings
as a faculty about the degree
of participation we want. Allother is our difficulty in discovering what degree of participation students themselves
actually want. Still another is
that the structure of student
government does not appear to
be designed to deal effective
ly with the congratulations of
educational policy determination. Consciollsly or not, the
structure of student government is partially designed to
deal with faculty and administration as accessories, not
as colleagues To see the point
i am trying to make we have
only to compare the structure
of faculty governance and its
relationship to the means, president, and trustees with that of
the structure of student placement and its relationships
to faculty, means, and president. Over the years the faculty has developed a structure
to represent its best interests
and obligations in a cooperative, construction deliberative
way; and serious couimnta<
tions between it and the interests and obligations of the trustees and the president are a
rarely.
Now we need to help the std.
cents develop a similar structure for representing their best
interests and obligations. automatically speaking, such a
structure will reduce the noise
level and let us get on more
calmly and effectively with our
teaching and Scholarship. Pedagogically speaking, the task of
creating and using such a
structure will give students
part of the education we one
them; it: will also provide us
with helpful advice and suggestions about educational pole
ice. The problem is where and
how to begin. At one time, I
thought it best to proceed as
we obviously were: adding students to faculty and administrative committees here and
there, trying to settle, at least

effectively, the question of student representation at faculty
meetings; und, all in all, meeting treasures as independently
as we could while we were
trying to decide the shape of
the structure that appeared to
be wyoming under our feet.
indeed, llntil we came to the
difficult question of student
representation at faculty meetings, I think we had done
rather well. We had met with
some success the problems of
representing students on publications and radio matters, on
admissions policies, and on student affairs. The matters of
EPC representation and audi.
dial council operation still pre.
sent ranging questions, but
they are due mostly to bad
luck and the lack of preference.
But in proceeding in this
general automatic way. we
have now helped straight into

and l contest that my instructions to the Faculty Organization Committee to come up
with an answer were press.
sure. It was asking too much.
As soon as I realized this point
and was driven back to more
basic considerations, 1 began
to think that what might be
desirable is a group which
could be called something like
The Facultysmdent Commission on Determination of Silk
sent Participation in Educational Policy, with members
chosen by appropriate means,
and with a mandate to report
by some deadline with recommendations to both faculty and
students. But this device, however refined, is not only too
cumbersome; it also assumes
too many things, among them
the nations that matters can
be held at the status que while
the committee is working and
that agreement on the principle
of how much participation can
be achieved within a reasonable time.
i think now a middle course
is more available and I wish
to propose it to the Faculty
organization Committee for
consideration, in hopes that it
will report its illustrations and
recommendations about the
matter first to the Executive
Council and then through the
Council to the faculty 81 I
whole.
This is my proposal:
That the Faculty OrganizaUon Committee meet with the
Student Senate, which includes
the Executive Cabinet of flu-

all too group to consider the
following:
(1) How the various student
groups involved in curriculum
studies, including the student
representatives on EPC constitutes, might be consolidated into a single, manageablesized group charged with
(A) Developing an election
or selection process for
choosing more effectively
and quickly than now student membership on various faculty and administrative committees.
(a) Developing a system
for notification between the
members of the Student
Senate and students serving on additional EPU
committees.
'(C) After point B has been
accomplished, developing a
way in which the faculty
EPC chairman and the std<
sent EPC representatives
can meet together and decide how best to present
their recommendations to
the F a c \l l t y Executive
Council, When that latter
group is ready to present
its recommendations to the
faculty as a whole, representative members of the
Student Senate might be invited to the faculty meet‘
ing to speak to the recommendations.
(2) While engaging in these
illustrations, the Id how
group might consider representing to the faculty at its
next meeting that the faculty
invite to all its regular meetings a representative from
the student newspaper and a
representative from the student radio, whose functions
will he repertorlal only.
(That there will be particularly sharp and logical differences on this latter recommendation I am aware, and
you are invited as individuals
to send them on to members
of the Faculty organization
Committee. My argument is
simply that faculty meetings
are going to be reported one
way or another, and the presence of student reporters
might be self correction and
perhaps give more accurate
results.)
As I see them, the ways-audmeans assumptions behind this
proposal are:

involved in the students' present and future role in the college.
RA SYSTEM CRITICIZED
Senior Mike Penzner, Loose
Hall House President, speaking
for the Committee on counsel
ing, customized the present counseling system for being involvement and grateful. He pointed
but that 70 thousand dollars is
spent annually for resident ad.
visits who generally have no
professional qualifications as
counseling. Furthermore, many
students have no contact with‘
their R A’s because the R A's
are either involvement or physically too»far removed, benz<

Penzner admitted trial some

but assisted that in general
students are getting poor
service for what they are swing.
He also pointed out that
twelve thousand dollars is being spent on student advisors
who are usually less competent
than R A's. Perhaps the most
important point of Penzner’o
speech was that the counseling service was designed by
the administration and the
counseling were chosen by the
administration, and that std<
cents must have a future voice
in determining counseling policies. He also emphasized that
resident advisors now play a
dual role as counseling and administrators, and this impacts
their function as counseling.

. CITES HAWN'S ATTITUDE
' Sophomore Steve Schwom,
assistant Student Coordinator»
spoke about student social services, including BEtG, mails,
bookstore, library, health can«
car, Forum and SAGA.
chwartz pointed out that stud
ent complaints concerning the

and the present room-cleaning
service have gone intended by
Physical Plant Director Dale
dawn. He also received the
work of last year‘s bookstore
committee and the petition that
over 600 students signed regarding the applicable state of
- the bookstore, all apparently to
no email. Schwartz noted that
the Forum, our student union
bf sorts, is completely run by
Mrs. powell Hawk, with std.
events having no say concerning
its budget, policy, or hours.
While committees on SAGA,
the library, building innovation, as well as the Student
Affairs Committee already have
s o m a student representation,
more work needs to be done in
these areas to institutionalize
the student’s decision-making
function, Schwartz maintained.
Sophomore Marshall career,
speaking on social regulations,
questioned whether the administration had any right to picture rules to students without
meaningful student participation in the circulation of those
rules. More specifically, Barr
her observed that the Student
Bill of Rights passed last year
provides protection for students, and makes the flour
opens policy all the more or.
library and unjustifiable. He
also questioned the administration’s right to require students
to liVe in directories and to
decide who may live off campus.
Finally, career stated that
the college ought to examine
whether it should efforts laws
that are legally the response‘
bility of state and local or fed
oral officials. if the college
finds that it must respond to
these laws, students must have
a role in defining what action
the college will take in these
matters.
CALLS FOR
CURRICULAR VOICE
Senior Jon Royal, after relations some housing parallel
starring the one and only
Mama Alice (Dean Alice Low).
stated that Student particular
Lion in academic decisions is
minimal and should be expanded. He noted that while in
some departments (totally Political Science) students had
an equal role in decision-making, in general students had
little power in their report<
meets. There are only two students on additional EPC’s, and
no students participate, in fax<
ulty and trustee approval of
academic innovations. Royal
questioned whether the present
trading system is beneficial, as
well as whether the present requirements were appropriate.
He pointed out that students
should have a voice in the sea
section of new processors, and
should also have a meaningful
course evaluation system to determine ways to improve the
curriculum and faculty. inter»
disciplinary options might be
created, he said, as well as 8.

when julﬂﬁed, and students
should also be able to indicate
courses more easily than they
can now. Royal concluded by
saying that the important
thing was to acquire a voice
in the decisions concerning
academic matters rather than
to effect specific changes.
TELLS
ADMINISTRATION’S POWER

then presented an effective
understatement 0f the fact that
when one examines the power
of the faculty and administra<
tion, he finds the ultimate and
final power in virtually all as.

curriculum, requirements for
graduation, and social rules
Silvermun outlined the [l'BnleiF
does power of the faculty's
Executive Council, which has
no student members. The council has overnight of the curriculum, advised the president
on faculty appointments and
centre, building construction
and innovation, and additional
and departmental organization,
Furthermore, it acts as the
board of review for the committee on academic standing.
This, Silverman pointed out, is
a far cry from “trial by your
peers.” No students sit on the
Committee on Academic
Standing, or on the Board of
Trustees, and all of these bodies
hold closed meetings.
TRUSTEES UNDEMOCRATIC
The Board of Trustees at
Grinneii is a self-perpetuating
body that files vacancies and
makes new appointments without any regard for a democratic
process that could involve
alumni, administration. faculty.
and students. The board has
complete financial control of
the College, and has the final
say on the approval of new
faculty, Silverman concluded by
saying that students and faculty
clearly deserve an institutionalized role in these administrative bodies.
8 e n l o r pick Schaalnian
finished the formal speeches by
telling the students that any
move to institutionalize student
power at Grinneil would fail
without strong student support.
He tried students not to be
displayed by past failures, and
to get together and work so
that the student body as a
whole can take a proposal to
the administration and the
faculty and demand action.
The meeting was then opened
up to the floor. Sophomore J ooo
Mai-colin expressed a pussy~
'nilstlc View, and rendered what
the students would do if they
met staff opposition. Sophomore
Dave i-leather quoted some
incomplete but receiving
statistics that he compiled that
indicated that a vast majority
of the Grinneii student topic
nation covered at least an
equal role for students in all
facets of the deCiSanrmaklng
process. Several students called
for a show of strength and unity
when the final proposals are
Submitted to the college.
I personally urge all students
to take part in circulation a
student philosophy and statement of position, one that can
be backed by a majority of
students. For the first time i’ve
seen the possibility of mass
student action to provide the
students with an official role
in college decisions, a role that
can be realized by the present
and future students of Grinnell
College, '
GDIC FUNDING REQUESTED
In a special 9 o‘clock meeting
Tuesday night the senate
wrapped up its usual business
