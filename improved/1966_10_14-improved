question, “Do girls consider

In the academic area, I

raised when the question was
asked, “How many of yoga
would attend a voluntary lnle im session the last week or s
of Christmas vacation?" A go
deal of interest was also
accused in the idea of holding
interdisciplinary seminars.
Several students expressed
the feeling that the general
lack of responsibility integrated by the rule system led
to irresponsibiilty in the social
and academic areas as well.
As one girl said about the present academic structure, there
is a “general feeling of n lack
of responsibility to what golf

Another said, “People are less

SCARLET AND BLACK
 
The membership of “The Chairs" once again raised the sticky
problem oi membership oi the arts, literature, and the press at Grinnell, While “The Chairs" incident is confusion, it did point out some
oi the serious problems we lace unless membership is automatically
eliminated on this campus,
“The Chairs” is not an isolated incident of membership or attempted membership here, and the son has knowledge of several
student projects that will appear this year which may be subject to
membership under the current policy. We should not wait for the
issue to come up again, with the resulting confusion, hard feelings, educational losses, and bad press coverage before we correct
the unsatisfactory situation.
There are many positive reasons for elimination the concept of
absolute membership, We will bring up some oi the most important
here:
The practice of membership is poor educationally. The college
should not teach, by example or otherwise, that artistic or press
membership is permissions merely because some people will become
upset. Last year President suggest made a serious attempt to
have a student photographic exhibit containing nude pictures removed on the grounds that “we are only trying to avoid trouble.”
The college should not teach that the proper way to handle controversial issues is to "blog them out.” This attitude is very much
opposed to the liberal arts concept of education by exposure, dis-
session and learning
Obscenity in the arts and literature is a relevant issue in the
real world, Due to our upbringing, it is a difficult subject for many
people to talk about intellectually. Students want and need guidance in this area, reporting to membership when something com
provincial occurs teaches nothing, and may easily have a negative
affect. We would point But that a coffee hour discussion was held
alter the performance of “The Chairs” and that no one, not even
Meyer, said anything about the now controversial scene.
when the faculty seems unable to discuss such things in the
open, what are students to think? Students are given little help in
learning to think intellectually about controversial matters related
to obscenity when a faculty member is the first to well "lead and
gross." Due to the membership, it will he difficult for a student here
in ever see “The Chairs" with effectively.
Openly discussing problems or obscenity would be worthwhile,

Our purpose here is not to discuss the specific
case of Dennis Rich and his production or “The
Chairs,” but rather to try to make some "valid
congratulations" about the responsibilities the
student director, his instructors, and the liberal
arts college administration have to the college
community and to one another, The peculiarities
and complexities of this particular case tend to
lead us astray and make us target that we are
dealing within a certain context — the college
community —— and with a spec' c population —the Students, faculty, and administration 0! that,
college,
The student director is in a didﬁcult situation.
He is an artistic agent —— a representative of the
playwright — and has n responses‘ 'ty to monkey,
with “artistic integrity," the aims and goals at
the playwright us he (the director) sees them
to be. But he has another rule -— that of student.
As a student, and as a student who is earning
academic credits for his work, his responsibilities
are not only to the playwright, but to his instructors and, more generally, to the learning experience. In this learning situation then he is not a
free agent, nor should he be. The student production in an art form, but the student is an appreciate to his art. Whether he is to call the instructions and comments he receives from his instructors “censorships” or “construction criticism”
and how he is to reach to such comment and in»
selection depends largely on his own attitude not
only toward the art to which he is appreciated,
but to the learning process in which he is involved,
His situation is further complicated by the responsibilities he ones to the college administration. His work is sponsored by the administration
oi the college both ﬁnaturally and physically (in
terms of the space recorded the director for his
production) In a less specific (but by no means
less important) sense, the student director becomes a part of the college administration when
he presents a production which is open to the pub
lie. The importance 0! "public relations” for the
Student is a much more didﬁcult matter to assess
than it is for the Broadway dimcwr who must be
assured a favorites box office response in order
to present his production In the college situation
the student must be sensitive to the kind or audience to which his performance is shared'—- an extremely difficult and very important feeling to
establish.
The third responsibility is, then, to the college
community as a whole, not only to the audience
but to the possibilities of the community and the
attitudes which prepaid among the student body,
in the “outside world," and among the faculty as
well. We grant that this kind at notification and
clairvoyance is a difficult task for an expert, let
alone for an amateur. But we also feel that special care must be taken in this area,
The aims at Grinnell as a liberal am instance
tion hopefully are not solely shared for the std.
cents, or faculty, or administration, but for all
three. This necessitates the establishment of a
true academic community in which all parties
are active, interested, and aware of the responsibilities each has for the others. The purpose oi
independent study is to allow the student to develop his i-esponsniilities in a mature and thought.
jul way. It is up to the administration and the inc.
alloy, as well as the student, to be aware of both
the problems and rewards of such a program
and to approach both in a responsible fashion.

Cicero learned
To the Editor:
This college proudly maintains a great insurance to one or
the great showers of intellectual
thought in Western civilization,
namely to Cicero. Around the
top oi the former library, Car»
begin small, are the names or
those who led us to our present state of intellectual development. Noticeaiiiy absent
from these is the name,
"Cicero". This would not he so
had were there a proper substitute, but the closest we get to
“Cicero" is “Caesar”, certainly
not a comparable shaped oi in—
reflects.
This, though, is only an i
inﬂict! in words, and ever
odd would agree that an insurance in need is tar more
serious. The insurance in need
is also present at Grinnell,
though in a for further way.
One of Cicero's finest beliefs
is that. meals should not occur
merely for the everything or
the body. but that “condition”
should be present in them. The
actual eating should be subordinate to the pleasure of the
company.
In Grihnell the opposite
view is held, as is exemplified
by the strict, cold, marsh rule
that one who does not have
n ﬂout hour class may not eat
with a friend who does. There
are, allegedly, reasons for this,
but i believe the upgrading or
the rinciple of condition is
work the minor generations
necessary for it.
Grinnell ought not to inﬂict
such a hard punishment as it
does (as it did to me), a heavy
fine, to those who accept this
idea of Cicero. Rather should
Grinnell change this unholy
Policy.

responsibility
To the Editor:
Having lived on this campus
for over two years and having
seen and had personal experiences with what i will call, for
lack or a better term, nonresponsiblluy on the part of so
many of my yellow students, I
find myself in a state of superconsciousness and edition at the
proposals resulting from this
year’s engagement.
As a ireshman i expected to
find college men and women
people who would be willing
and able to carry responsibility.
1 found instead a growth ot people who, for the most part, were
able, but involving to be responsible, Perhaps I ought to be
more specsﬁc about what 1 mean
by the term "responsibility." 1
mean sincerely interested in
events and things going on a
round them and not accepting
them partially; wanting to give
at themselves to help others or
to do anything at all, but having some drives other than just
seeking good times; being selfreliant and not feeding superimposed sign posts telling them
what to do and when to do it;
and generally being able to
conduct themselves in an adult
and mature manner.
I feel the proposals presents
ed by the executive cabinet, by
creating an atmosphere of
“freedom” would lot-co students
to accept responsibilities which
they did not have to deal with
previously. And from this would
develop my higher concept oi
the “responsible student."
I don’t tool that 1 am being
too idealistic about this, lodging
from the very positive reactions
of so many of the students and
the general aura of excitement
which is providing the campus.
And this is not the excitement
of “on BOY! i No women’s
course A iiltyeighl hour visitor

movement of students who com<
present the reasons for these
changes and see the vast potential which these proposals
have for making something
more of this campus than a
place to go to classes and live
find are caught up in a desire to be at art of this in some
way, even i only sitting down
and talking it over with others
who are also caught up in this
“feeling.”
1 only hope that students who
feel this mood, as I feel it, will
not let it outside as the novelty
years off but will certain these
trends and carry them over to
other facets of campus life,
making Grinnell a more library,
alive, interested, and responsible community.

Grade population
To the Editor:
That the {equity chose

grade change indicates Just how
much the faculty regarded still
sent opinion on the matter.
That we now have a 3.5 grade
indicates the faculty’s jerusalem
examine automatically and typically the anachronism of grades.
It indicates a departure from
the progressive, partial pass-tail
system introduced publicly last
spain . Perhaps by taking one
step stimuli, the faculty believes it can take two steps forward. But playing this kind of
calypso movement could well
clip the value 0‘ a Gl'lonely education.
Another grade means not only
more emphasis on grades but,
lcd many students, simply another grade to grab for. Now if
grades accurately reflected the
value the student obtained
from the course, then grades
could be certified. That they
don't, that they often encourage
super quality and competitive
density, hardly needs explanation here, But what does need
explanation is why the faculty
is processing grade estimation.
Perhaps the faculty believes
that increasing the grade prev

— which might embarrass the
faculty. Why not, for example,
a 3.25 grade, This would be the
difference between “very good"
work and “Sllpel'jul‘”_work; we
could call it “procedure” work.
. . . one can hope the faculty
will determine its policy on
grades and invest the student
with a little more academic responsibility in has junior and
senior years. Specifically, l propose:
1. That grades be retained for
freshmen and sophomore courses, and for upper level courses
outside orie’s major, _
2. That in junior and senior
courses within _ one’s major.
grades be published. instead,
the professor shall submit an
explicitly written evaluation of
the student's work in the course.
The evaluation would be sent to
graduate schools, which would
thus be able to evaluate not
only the student‘s work more
precisely but also the professor’s ability. Certainly, all this
involves more paperback and a
burden on the professor. But
(a) the evaluation would . be
more precise than. a numerical
grade, and (b) it would encourage the professor to pay
more than a police interests
his student as the latter begins
to concentrate in the former's
field. And perhaps the quality
of boat would improve.
3. That if this method of evaluation is too burdensome on the
professor, it would be conﬁnew
to the senior year. That year,
after all, is the most important
in terms of the student's work
and the professor’s guidance.

Dear Mary,
This afternoon I drove to
Grinneil to take a friend to the
Rock island station. We decided to drop in at the Fine Arts
Building to see the exhibit of
hay Frederick‘s work. Our short
stay on the campus was so pleasant that I want to tell you
about it.
As we stood on the south side
at Highway No. 5, waiting for
a chance to cross, a friendly
student on a bicycle called out
to us, “Press the button there
beside you and stop the traffic."
How stupid we level We hadn’t

Costa Rica: Student Research Opportunities

(The 4-5 clubs are somewhat

second, on which she college

“Educational Attitudes and positions of Mothers for Their

took a sample item the “tugurios” (sluts) and compared it to

to be because people in the
rural areas think they will ﬁnd

are, however, instances of urban-rural migration. Costa Rica
does not have as consolidated
a slim area as other parts of
Latin America, in which it
ranks about 7th in rights. it is
the highest in Central America.
Stable Democracy
Costa Rica maintains a stable,
democratic political system.
President Trejos is pro-American. The last political disturblance occurred in 1947 and since
then democratic elections have
continued normally. The Grinnellians were in San Jose for
the national election last year

MacGregor also mentioned
the possibility for passage

MacGregor claimed that some

He thought it practical to have
some limitations on the bill, i.e.
in cases of headlines. friends or
religious groups wanting to buy
or rent a house together.

In discussion, MacGregor
denied that he had failed to
publicly state the bill’s dis.
function between realtors and
private home owners. penis
deCoteau, music, stated that
legislature gave in to pressure
by realtors not to clarity this
distinction so that they would
have control over private sellers.
MacGregor said that he received no pressure (mm the
realtors and that he had always taken the politicians un-
popular position of opposite
the real estate lobby. Des
Coteau then claimed that
realtors did not try to press u r e compression directly
but, according to personal experience in San Francisco,
they created opposition to the
open housing clause by de.

against one another.
Ezra Mendelsohn (history)
told MacGregor that civil rights

The compression drew the
line, however, at “horrible

He recently voted against nursing children in a school integration bill below his mmmlttee because he believes
“forming integration“ is not

Asked how he thought the

sure yesterday. told the Shit:
“Bringing these things out in
the open would be beneficial to
everyone involved, My only
rear would be that this might
garden african priorities, and
then. perhaps, nothing would be
gained.”
Many responsible people, including the reviewer for the
5&3, do not agree with Meyer’s
convention that the controversial scene in “The Chairs" so
seriously affected the audience
that they went away thinking
nothing else about the play. He
is entitled to his views, but he
must also allow for other opinions. In measuring the play he
closed the door on rational discussion.
We think a good additional
opportunity was lost when “The
Chairs" was centered. it the
matter had been approaches in
an intellectual manner students
could have examined the issues
involved and learn a great deal.
Student directors could gain a
better idea how their audience
hearts on totally questionable
matters. The (equity could offer
needed guidance. and could also
learn more about “student at.
minutes." Discussion would
also help everyone keep a clear
separation between the student
actor as a character on stage
and as a student they know personally. We do not believe that
students will be hurt by seeing
something controversial like
"The Chairs."
By elimination membership,
faculty and administration
would he shared oi the very
embarrassing and typically did<
ficult situation into which key<
er and SomerVille put each
other. M a n y knowledgeable
people think Meyer went to the
extreme or everything another
faculty member because, as
his experience with “The
black” indicated, he had to
support the indeiinite but decision administration position
on obscenity. This is a applicable situation and one that lessons stutlent respect for all inVolved.
Some faculty members have
told the 5&3 that they are
"automatically opposed to any
membership on campus." One
can only calculate what would
happen it a faculty member
who takes [his stand becomes
involved in a situation like that
of “The Chairs."
We are of the opinion that the
basis oi the problem, and perhaps the only reason that membership still goes on here, is administration and faculty cancer for the “totally correct
and nonrcontroversial" image
oi Grinnell College.
Much oi the confusion and
contamination of past dis
session on membership has
resulted team attempting to
bypass not only the question oi
what is the “good image” but
how submitting supposedly removal works of art to exist here
effects that image.
These are questions that need
thought and discussion. We do
not think it would be very difficult to sell the ideas of “artistic freedom” and “freedom of
the press" to the outside world
oi alumni, money rivers, trustees, parents, etc. We would
point to the administration’s
handling or the “drug issue" as
the type of construction approach needed.
lt membership on moral
grounds is eliminated the college need not fear a deluxe of
observe student art. We think
Grinnell students are sensitive
people. And when questionable
matters do arise, student and
faculty criticism would act as
effective recordings. As Meyer
told the 5&Bl “I believe that If
we had no membership there
would be problems, but. this
would not matter in the long

plymouth Pioneers’ Next grey
The Pioneer football team,
winners in its ﬁrss three games,
will try to escape the collar
this week when they play at
plymouth. Last week the Plolleers fell to an inspired Knox
team 14-7 in what was supposed
to have been a fairly easy game.
Again this week the Pioneers
will be facing what should be
an easy game. plymouth has
also lost all three of its games
and ranks last in the league in
both team offense and defense
They have been outscored 12828 in those three games including a 47—0 loss to simon last
Week.
Meanwhile the Pioneers are
not looking so delicious either.
Although they do not have statistics as bad as plymouth's,
their play has kept them near

Coach add powers was na<
but-ally disappointed at the result and pointed at several key
areas that needed improvement.
First of all is team attitude. The
Knox bench was able to show
more desire than tile Pioneers'
all day.
On the field the Pioneers need
mainly to improve their blocking, hunting, and passing.
The Pioneers were able to
complete only two passes
against Knox. one in each half.
in the three games the Pioneers
have completed only l6 for 149
yards.
The hunting was had also The
Pioneers were able to average
only 29 yards a hunt and a couple were under 20.
All three oi the touchdowns in
the game were scored after the
team recovered a female. On the
third play or the game Knox
enabled and Bob cialis picked it
up on the Knox 30. After being
helped by a penalty, the city
need's drove for the score, in the
second period Knox picked up
a Pioneer female on the Pioneer
45 and drove for the score, but
missed the extra point and were
training 7-6 at half. 0n the third
play of the third quarter Knox
picked up a female on the Grinneil in Six plays later they scored and made a two point conversion.
