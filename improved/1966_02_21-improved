What's Expected
Today Steve Kent was elected SGA president. He
was elected by a huge margin,
Throughout the campaign Kent and the other candidates have spoken of lack of student involvement. It
became the key word of the election.
New Kent is faced with the problem of taking this
”Catch phrase” and turning it into some kind of work—
ing reality. His first step will be a questionnaire to find
out where the students interest is. Beyond this, what
Kent can do is a question with which we are all concerned.
The lack of student involvement, according to
Kent during the election, was in part the fault of the
forward administration. This is a strong criticism and
we think it is important that as Kent takes office he
keeps it in mind.
It is the duty and responsibility of the SGA press—
sent to smoke student response. He cannon find safety
in saying I can’t do anything because the student body
is synthetic. During the next few months we shall
watch and hope that Kent has some method of stimulating Grinnell students, of listing them from their
state of proposed apache. If he can’t do this then the
words of his own campaign will most assurance come
back to count him — from both forward, who knows
how difficult a task that is, and from the 5&8, who
dress’t know it for sure but Who subjects it strongly.

a grosspolitician in support oi

Finally Ray Horn spoke on the
task of Student government for “if

student body that it can get results, only when will the students
really become involved in campus
issues." Horn ended the Kent
nominations with, “Only effective
student leadership can give ellen—

FOR STEVE KENT! !”
During the early part or the
following, hopes in the convention
were not very high for Kent,
especially when he only received
ﬁgreen votes on the ﬁrss ballot,
the lowest of the three candidates. As corporations were being made by Kent’s floor campaigners for the second roll call,
the estimate for his strength
was around so generates. However, as me second roll call
programmes and every hall gave
their votes it soon became apparent that Kent and Witlgraf
were on their way to an easy
Victory.
 
When it became apparent that
cultural and Kent were the lu'u
victory, Steve shelter, the third
candidate, appeared on the platform to concept victory, thunder changed his workers for ties

Afterwards Kent said that he
was very happy about the con—

thankful for thunder‘s support,

Kent made one final request,
“Send people to me C of HP,

Wiilgraf charges from Conflict
Wilh law of level-Headed reality
By MARTHA BERKEY
George Wittgrai came out oi the
convention with solid support and
enough votes for nomination on
roll call of [he first serious ballot.
Wittgraf’s sound platform oi
student — faculty cooperation was
echoed in his nomination and recording speeches. In his speech or
nomination. Dick benchmark
called for "a carefully returned
program oi student action.”
benchmark characterized Wittgraf‘s program as not only containing “21 series or specsﬁc, automatic goals applicable in the
immediate future," but also having
“the further merit of introducing
student opinion as a vital motor
in determining the policies oi the
college.”
recording speeches were made
by Anne Hogansun, Jan Streiii,
and David Lighthourne.
Miss robinson arrested Wilt<
gray's record oi achievement and
his “realistic, practical steps to a
possible goal,” While Miss cardiff
tried students to support Wiltgrai
(or a “government With students
rather than above students."
Lightboume drew a laugh brown
the crowd as he said, “My destination with personality politics
and SGA gamesmanship risks to
active disenchantment only when
it manager to escape proposed
another"
 
Lighthourne saw that—whatever
the future course of SGA—“our
one prime consideration” must be
[0 choose “that candidate who can
carry on level-headed relations
with the administration on a daily
basis." He therefore supported
Wittgraf as “a candidate With the
intelligence and imagination to
concerns oi SGA in an entirely
new way. a candidate with the
impacts to broader the base at
student participation in this community."
As the voting came in, Wittgrat
carried three calls completely and
had a substantial majority in
three more. Kent carried one hall
and had good support from others;
thunder Carried two calls. Then
vote switching began. Cowles
changed from 100 per Cent backing oi E. grow to substantially
Kent support thunder lost his two
calls, and was obviously on the
way out.
Rather than be previously voted
out, however, thunder got up to ,
throw support to Kent and a little
mud to Wittgrai. His unexpected
method or integrating put a
peculiar twist on the job enthusi—
ask and a peculiar end to the
convention. Later. integral said,
"it's too bad. Personal antagonisms will build up over this which
will last for months; and in the
dealtime, people will forget all
about SGA within a week.”
