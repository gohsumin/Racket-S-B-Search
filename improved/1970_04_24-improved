A collection or about 0,000
books valued at between $80,000
and $100,000 has been bequeathed

F, since, dermatologist, who
died last December at the age oi

The gift, announced by Grinnell ,
College President Glenn suggest,
consists charity at a great variety
of first editions in addition not
volumes with a special emphasis
on history. The latest item,t
valued at $3,000, is a first edition
oi Thomas DeQuincy‘s “done
sessions oi an English Opium
water.”
Grinnell will receive all the
volumes in the collection except
for the relatively small number
oi medical books which Dr. since
requested to the library or the
university oi Nebraska College
at Medicine at Omaha.
Henry older, Grinnell librarian
who first became acquainted
with Dr. since and this
remarkable library some live
years ago, says he expects the
collection will not be fully
catalogued before this tall.
However, he plans an exhibition
at some oi the best items during
the announcement-Alumni
Reunion Weekend activities here
May 23-31. A group oi the
volumes is to be estimated at the
Omaha Public Library in May.
Among the rare first editions
are John cocks’s “Essay on

While the annually valuable

students.
unusual lecture at this show was
the manual slide change. Mr.
Brown changed the slides to

The music that accompanied
the shows was or fairly uniformly good quality, mostly

that only a small part of each

Environmental Teach-[n
This week marks the beginning of the First National Environmental Teach—In. All over the country
students, teachers, scientists, politicians, and just
plain citizens are gathering at economic, social, and
academic institutions to focus their attention and the
attention of their nation on the problems presented
by the ecological crisis. There is hope that this
week’s events will be the beginning of a popular
movement that will express in needs and not merely
words a concern for the safety of our environment.
If this happens, it will not be the first such movement. Among other organizations, the Sierra Club
has for years been actively working on a limited
scale for the preservation of the nudity of our wilderness areas. The wonderful and sensitive photographs of intel Adams and Eliot Porter as published in the Sierra Club’s books have convinced
many of the need for active concern in these matters.
These are days, however, when even such presented as the Boundary Waters range Area are
threatened by introducing industry. Pollution of
our environment has, in urban, rural, and wilderness areas, reached a level at which it cannon be
ignored. We are marketing to the need for action
at an alarm which we can only hope did not come
too late. We are no longer willing for our environment “to be handed over to awareness, unthinking
development by those who think only of what it
could yield to them today,” in the words of current
De Bell.
Everyone adults that it is “awareness, unthinking
development” that has got us into this situation, but
we disagree as to charity do about it. Suggestions
for action range on all sides from the active and
rational concern of the conservation organizations to
the cash, if concern, actions of students who confidentiality collect tin cars from the headlines to
empty on the floors of soft drink and beer distributors. We suggest that this is a time when, more than
at any other, reason is needed, list we move from
“awareness, unthinking development” to awareness,
unthinking activity.
Man, the only rational animal, has often after
before thinking. If we work together to reverse this
trend, we can more effectively work together to
change our treatment of the environment.

Most college categories in

requirement on character is
something one hardly sections,
especially in non~Catholic
colleges. Perhaps there are
reasonsforthis,historicalaswell

the desire to aVOld religious publication taught Americans to
respect each other‘s faith, and
'since ethical values are
somewhat died up with religion
or are analogues, these too
became somewhat a personal

automatically speaking, the
principles oi moral behavior
became personal and “narrative” rather than matters oi

practical point oi view one's

Moreover, in recent centuries,

By early Coiiey
Those of you who missed
the concert Friday, April 10th
missed one of the most removable
contemporary concern oi the
year, filled as “The Quiet
Concert," the hour of clarinet
music was performed in the
Arena Theatre, which turned out
to be an automatically flattering
decimal hall The performing
were Paul Zonn, three at his
clarinet students, Micaei
Humphrey, cherry payment and
Karen these-and maritime tourist
Floyd Slotterback,
The concert began with a
clarinetsolo written by germany
and performed by Mr. Zonn. The
piece, entitled "Mosaik," was an
excellent work with which to
begin the performance, as it was
one oi the first works to explore
new sounds in clarinet technique;
sounds such as multiple stops and
cluster tonguing. “Mosaik” was
followed by Stravinsky’s “In
memorial J F.K,” This serial
work for clarinet trio and
maritime tourist listed a mere
tribute. Since the performing felt
that during rehearsals they had
liked it better each time it was
played, me work was repeated
three times during the evening
with the quality oi performance
improving with each reputation,
The next work on the program
was a composition entitled
“streaming workers” by
Stephen covered. Since it is often
very difficult to concentrate on
electronic music with nothing on
stage to focus one’s attention
upon, Mr. Zonn passed out
reasons to the members oi the
audience and asked them to draw
their reactions to what they
heard on the back of their
programs, cordless to say, this
proved to be the highlight oi
expressiveness for the members
of the audience.
The next piece on the program
” resolutions” was followed by a
warning piece “Graphic Mobile."
This composition is of the breast
type oi music. There are no
notes, The performed-s are given
only ideas and features and
shapes, probably much like some
of the ideas which were drawn
out on the back of the programs
during the covered piece. This
performance, therefore, was only
one oi a infinite number oi pen
companies of the same work. In
this case, Mr. Zonn stood on one
side of the stage and three
clarinetists stood on the other.
The contrast between the group
and the solo created what might
be considered a contemporary
concerts effect. Some beautifully
dissonant varieties came out of
the chance cuts to the group,
while Mr. Zonn unified the work
by playing a steady solo line.
The sixth piece on the program
was an old work at Mr, Zunn's,
written in 1956 for Clarinet
quarter. His style of composition

years, but certain characteristics

Two weeks age fifteen people

was to center attention on the
continuing Vietnam War and the
national priorities that have
presented The group spent the
second night oi the thursday
march in Mitcliellville, a rural
community oi fewer than 2000
people,
Two oi the churches in site
chelvillc decided not to other the
group a place to spend the night,
but the united Church oi christ
had voted unanimously to accept
the students. This decision
required no small amount of
courage on the part oi the church
members, for their contact with
college students was very slight
and their Contact with real live

members at the other churches in

Nevertheless, the density oi a
discipline lies in accuracy as well
as in the importance oi the
subject matter; and what ethics
packs in accuracy, it makes up
in importance. Moreover, we do
honor or praise certain men in
high positions, not for what they
have done by accident or in a
matter of minutes or hours, but
for needs which arise out of
certain qualities, qualities which
are habits acquired through
repeated acts ot defining types
and stabilized in a predictions
manner. We expect just acts
from a man who has been called
“just", and courageous acts from
a man who is known to be
courageous. And it such men are
trained or hundred for many
qualities oi this sort, they are
generally considered as leading
a earlier life than the rest of
banking, for, if it is not for a
earlier like, for what other
reason would they choose to act
as they do or be trained and
hundred? ls it because they
benefit banking? But that is part
of the function of such qualities,
for, not only do they benefit the
professor oi them, but also those
to whom the publication acts may
be directed, A generous man
gives with pleasure and not with
pain, and the receiver benefits
by the act of generation, and
further, the given is trained or
hundred. as if getting a bonus in
addition to his pleasure oi giving;
and such is generally the nature
of an act which proceeds from
certain habits called “virtual"
Now since happiness is
relatively assured by the possession oi a number oi virtual, and
since there is a way oi requiring
virtual, there must be a science
as well as an art leading to the
possession of virtual. The science
of virtual is a matter at
knowledge and of fact, namely,
knowledge or the fact that such
acid such a virtue is acquired in
such and such a manner, and
the art has to do with the specific
acts listing [l'om such knowledge
and ending in possession oi
the virtual. This art is anonymous
to any other art. A student of
medicine first leaves the facts of
m8dlClI’lB_ and then he becomes
an insert to get the skill oi acting
effectively in accordance with
that knowledge, and an architect
or engineer- does likewise.
Accordingly, we may switching
define ethics as the science of
virtual which lead to happiness,
follow-ed hy the art oi requiring
these virtual Titc science is a
matter of knowledge acquired
through discussion in class. the
art is a matter of acting on the

periodically, the administered
tions at colleges in this country
were more particular about the
conduct oi students in earlier
years than in recent years, The
pattern oi conduct was more or
less set, and variations were
r’bali with in such a manner as
not to history the pattern. The
penalty for students, especially
those of academic or some other
excellence, was minor, as long
as the deviation was not too
serious Alter all, there was not
much danger about the pattern
of conduct, and a certain amount
oi forward initiative on the port
or the student was focused,
sometimes even welcomed. A
successful businessman
preferred a son with best and
initiative, and thanks were focused since his son would finally
settle down, and administrations
of colleges understood this
Besides, such a son would not
try to justify his act, he took the
light punishment with slight
rcgrct. The situation now has
changed. We no longer have
isolated acts ot deviation, but
ratings organized acts; and
further, students who deviant are
determined to do so and to justify
their acts in the name of “social
justice” oi “the new society,” or
“a tree mobility" or other such
elegant.
In other words, what is at stake
now is the pattern or conduct
itself or the “establishment";
and it appears that this point is
not quite understood by many administrators or trustees, who are
not aware that the problem now
is no longer one of degree, but
one of kind; or else, ads
ministrators or trustees are not
quite equipped, in one way or
another, to deal With the problem
effectively This is to be ex
posted. One who introduces a
great idea or system usually has
reasons for it and can justify it
with arguments. Such were the
fathers at our constitution, whose
certification may be read in the
It‘cdcralisl Papers. Once the
pattern is set and stabilized, that
great idea or system sends to be
perpetuated more by cabin and
loss through knowledge oi the
arguments behind it So we
find present administrators less
equipped to defend the pattern
at conduct with arguments and
effective measures, and this
makes rcbellioiis students more
convinced of'the certification oi‘
their acts and border in their
actions, And naturally, such
students pay more attention to
the businesses of their suppliers
than to their oivn, young as the
arc. and they are not likely to
raise questions concerning the

iii they have one at alli, once
such system is introduced But
then, such students see things as
being relatively simple, and this
is because their thinking is
relatively simple.
As for the argument that
students are more honest and
that older men are, more hypothetical, even II we admit this is
a fact, and perhaps it is, would
this change human nature by
changing the establishment? For
one thing, older men are more
aware of their businesses or
video than younger men are; and
younger men are more irresponr
bible than older men, It young
men are more honest and more
idealistic, they can afford to be
so, for. necessity has not yet
blocked at the door. They are
assured of a likelihood and an
education, while older men have
had to provide the means. But
in providing the means one is
faced with competition, and when
there is competition, there we
find the reputation to be less
idealistic and less honest and
more practical. Now these very
idealistic and honest young men.
as experience has shown, do not
heritage to forget their idealism
and poverty it it is they, and not
their parents, who have to earn
a likelihood and assure their
children a good living and an
education. More poverty and
idealism in younger men, then,
even if admitted as a fact, does
not prevent the change when the
same young men begin to assume
the burden of earning a livecam
hood, whatever the system or
establishment. Evidence of this
is to be seen in a system built
by young and idealistic men the

These statements are not
unusual or enlightening in
themselves, unless they are
remarkable in concerning so
exactly to the stereotype of rural
people‘s, but the fingering,
poverty, and deep feeling with
which the statements were made
unusual. By the end oi the
evening, alter several hours of
talking about everything from
war to religion to drugs, people oi
Mitchellville were convinced of
one thing at least: despite the
clothes the partners were and
the length oi their hair, they were
“regular folks” 7' and they were
not going to tear down the
church.
A day later the fifteen arrived
in Des points and added their
voices to a large demonstration
in front of Veterans’ Memorial
Auditorium. Many members of
the group felt that the changing
and the posters at the demonstration made it a success,
serving to one some people out of
their synthetic or complement
attitudes, while others felt the
noise had authorized people
more can it had opened their
minds. The partners agreed,
however, that their conversations :
with, therefore oi Mitchellville
had been extremely worthwhile,
and that such dialogue is
probably more valuable than
even the biggest demonstration.

courses are acknowledged, but a
beginning is better than no
beginningatall.
One theoretical difficulty is due
to the varieties of assumptions
concerning lite, Happiness for an
attempt is limited to this life, but
a believed will-have to define
happiness in terms oi eternity;
and there are differences even
among hclicvers. Nevertheless,
all or them have something in
common: for example, all agree
on being just, on promoting
the intellectual and social values,
and, in general, on treating individualsras ends in themselves
rather than as instruments to be
used for one‘s own ends. And if
differences exist, pr prices are
more likely to dim iso if the
various assumptions are made
known and discussed, for some
respect and tolerance for site
recent assumptions is likely to
follow.
