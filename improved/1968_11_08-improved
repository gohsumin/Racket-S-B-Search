More than 40 Grinnell Students went to Des points Tuesday to join an election day

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), The reasons given
for the demonstration were: 1)
The election was a hoax, because the positions of the major
candidates were so Similar; 2)
this “law-and—order” issue, as
used by the candidates, was a
cover-up for racing; 3) The
US. should withdraw at once

Quad Saga Workers Settle
As Weekend Strike concluded
Sago: Help Use
Union Tactics
The strike by Quad workers
against Saga included trying

the food services At first, these
actions took the form of in<

After the work stopping had
been called, students were
tried by the strike leaders to
eat only at the Quad. and to
“eat but don't be next.” The
purpose was to make the
clean-up job after the meal
longer and more difficult than
usual, so that meals would call
behind schedule, and the
strike-speakers would recently<

the Strike leaders had asked.
Dishes of food were bumper on
the floor, butter. mayonnaise,

College Reports
$137,000 Deficit
In Yearly Audit
During the academic year
1967768 Grinnell College maintained a $137,001] deficit according to Mr, Donald zambia,
Treasure of the College.
The income for the year was
$5,019,279 and expenditures were
$5,156,883. Average enrollment
was 1140. The cost of the education for each student was therefore $4,523. Since the tuition and
fees amount to $3,100, the student who pays full ices only
pays for 68.5% the cost oi his
year at Grinnell.
Income from endowments and
gifts make it possible for Grinnell to operate without charging enough tuition to cover the
operating costs, Last year the
income from endowments came
to $407,537 and gifts adjusted to
$773,776.
Mr. zambia indicated that
the college was hoping that am
(Academic Improvement Mas<
terrain) would be successful
this year in reviewing the college
of last year’s deficit. The year
before last the college came out
with an $11,000 surplus.
Faculty Considers
Adding Students
To Committees
A proposal from the Executive
Council of the faculty officially
to involve more students in
the educational policy of the
college departments is now being discussed, Under the plan,
two students major' in departments of each division will
be placed on its Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) These
Students would review all revi<
signs and proposals within each
department oi their division.
With the students more normally
involved, it is hoped that the
EPC will be presented with
ideas directly from the students.
At the present time, according to Professor Joseph Wall,
chairman of the faculty, it ap.
years likely that this proposal
will pass. Tile biggest point or
convention now is the method of
choosing the two student reply<
sentatives for each committee.
The committee of Faculty 0translations is considering the
addition of students to other
faculty committees as well.
Groups suggested include the

Block Times Won,
apartments Lost
Tile dispute between Quad
Saga workers and the college
has, after a two day strike, been
settled. Student workers returned to the Quad on Monday
morning. Both sides complicated in reaching the final agreement. Although wage in.
apartments will be eliminated on
February 1, block times will
now be split among workers
who must hear an extra burden
when an explore is absent or
party.
The "block time" is an average time which a certain duty
should take when a worker is
assigned a duty be is paid at
an hourly rate for that average
time. Previously, the official
policy of Saga was not to pay a
worker any extra money if he
had to cover, in addition to
his own job, the job of an absent

John Shaw. a mealhead at the
Quad and one oi the student
negotiation, block times were

times of abilities will be split,

additional abilities.
Also included in the settle«
ment was a provision to pay a
worker extra if a “schedule
feature beyond the control of
the workers extends the work
period more than two-months
hours beyond the normal block
time."
”The block time settlement
will cost the college no extra

are willing to pay for every
job that is done.” Fomerenk emphasized that the multiﬁnation
for not selecting block time was
to ensure that a full Crew would
be at the meal.
In a separate letter to Saga
workers, new policies to control
sciences were outlined.
The second major issue was a
authority implement above the
base wage. The students asked
for a ﬁve cent implement above
any base rate after the second
semester of work and again
listed the little semester.
In a letter to Saga workers.
James Stauss, protest oi the
College, said that the College’s
budget is already tight. Because
the College must. increase the
base wage rate to reach the
minimum wage or $1.65 in the
next three years, student labor
costs already pressure the projected budget. title pressure or
apartments were added, the College might have to consider a
cheaper alternative to so much
student labor.
The present wage base is $1.15.
February 1, it will increase to
$1.30. At that time all existing
apartments will be wisconsin
lled.
The students in the Quad are
the only large group of student
workers currently receiving any
implement. They had not yet
been informed that the intro«
series would be disappointed
next semester. There was some
confusion regarding a decision
to establish the implement system two years ago. Some
thought that the system established then was still in effect.
on Sunday the administration
produced a copy of a letter sent
to Saga workers then. The sys—
tel was only established for
that school year.
"The administration is fairly
satisfied with the agreement,”
said Mrr Pomerenk, “but we
are sorry that the students
struck. That type or relationship
that one finds between labor
and management in industry is
not appropriate under a system
where jobs are granted as a
form of financial aid.”
“we were pleased that the
administration was willing to
compromise." stated Shaw.
"The compromise on block
times was good. We only degree
that it took four weeks of dis—
sessions and a strike to settle
instead of the fifteen»tribute
meeting Friday at which the
administration showed no willingness to compromise, even
when the student negotiation
demonstrated their willingHess."

simon’s Victory
This week the country made its choice and
elected Richard simon president of the United
States. The country chose the worse of two evans
and will suffer for it.
The people chose to be accessible to the problems of the ghetto, the problems of unemployment,
and the other social problems of America. They
chose to pricing international pensions and the
arguments race,
Mr. simon has said that “We have been house
ing millions into those Federal antipoverty programs
and we have reader a harvest of root, arbitration
and failure.” On account of the Vietnam war, how.
ever, the first items in the budget to be out have
been the antipoverty programs. Besides, the Congress has never appropriated the amount of money
the bills’ sponsors have stated was necessary for
the accomplishment of the programs. simon has indicated that he intense to reduce the national budget by scripting most of the antipoverty programs.
His answer to the economic problems of Black people is to provide tax incentives for “black capitalism," a solution hardly adequate to the magnitude
of the problem.
simon has suggested as a solution to the problem of inflation an increased unemployment What
kind of man would suggest a method for solving
one problem that involved the creation of another
which would mean vast misery to innumerable per-
1e.7
p On the major issues of our time Mr. simon kept
silent throughout his campaign, simon spent only
four years in the House of Representatives and two
years in the Senate, For the last fifteen years he
as had no position of public responsibility. As vice
president to Eisenhower and as a private citizen
simon showed himself as neither an indicator of
legislation nor as a spokesman. As a member of Congress he spent most of his time warning America
about the evans of communist.
Our best hint of what the new simon administration will be like came when simon chose Spiro
renew, a man inexperienced in national politics, as his vice presidential running mate. renew is also a man of questionable mobility considering his purchases of lands intended for public projects and his other conflicts of interest. We can also
wonder if the infection shown at the Republican
Convention between Strom Thurmond and simon
will continue when simon besides in the White
House.
In this cold war, now two decades old, there
have been few calling enterprises One of the major steps in reviewing the entity between the Soviet
Union and the United States was the sale of American wheat in 1963. Mr. simon called the sale “a
foreign policy founder even more serious than the
housing of the Bay of Figs.
Mr. simon, unlike the unsuccessful Democratic
romance, has never indicated much interest in showing the arms race. During his campaign he claimed
that the United States was suffering a “security
gap” and losing its nuclear lead over Russia. He
has indicated that, if elected president, he will increase the country’s nuclear arrival, already large
enough to kill every Russian several times.
The United States faces hard times. But we entered Eisenhower, and we even entered Johnson,
for the gods put an ensuring heart in men. Perhaps
we shall survive simon.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Steve Kent compared
browser‘, Schneirov
I disease the position of having
to correct another of Mr. prospect's chronic and based proceedings of history, but I would
like to set the record straight
on one matter.
Never in my time at Grinnell,
did I institute, draft or calculate
any positions whatsoever (except on behalf of certain candidates for office).
With regard to the numerous
positions calculated by a variety
of well-winners and participants
on the day of the allocated sleepin two years ago, I did not participate in the training or cirr
creation of any of these pets-
[sons which, I understand, gathered over 800 signatures in the
space of apprDleately twelve
hours. Nor were these positions
ever used by me, or even all
collected from their calculators,
precisely because some of them
were shopping drawn and because the fast-pace of events
made it questionable in our
minds that all of the winners
were fully aware of the implications of signing.
Your relation of the facts suggests that you may have those
positions confused with one
widely calculated among my
class by some of my classified
a few days before our graduation. This petition, which called
for a realistic review of the
opens policy, something i still
believe IS needed at Grinnell,
was published in the 5&3 in a
substantially altered form, to
the charlie of a number of its
winners, including myself. who
were not given notice of the
changes. 1 had nothing to do
with the training or circulation
of this petition in either its original or adulterated form and
was one of those who requested
that their names be removed
from the list of winners.
“Demagoguery”. “discovery".
"compilation" are 5 tr 0 n 3
words, particularly when associated with an incorrect relation
of the facts. Doesn't this kind of
public character investigation,
Mr. prospect, done behind the
victim’s back and without the
defence of reasonable notice.
strike you as being just a bit
uhtalr and reprehensible — perhaps, as you might have it, even
Schneirovian?
I have done some things that
I would be hard-pressed to defend in retrospect, but gross
reception is not one of them.
And. really, Mr. prospect, to
style me as a catalogue is not
a little like focusing Phyllis
miller of being a sex-pot. It's
a flattering charge but one that
just can't be sustained under
scrutiny.
My own preference always
has been for the politics of cars
situation and of compromise
and, l think, with the exception
of a specialized moment or two,
I have been a fairly consistent
practitioner of that brand.
I like to think that had
some of us been better needed
two years ago. some of the deals
lions that now prague the campus might have been decided.
Yet 1 rather doubt that anything
I could have done (or not done)
in the short time available to and
would have greatly changed the
course of recent Grlnnell history. I may be a good case
study for the proposition that
"the evil men do live after
them while the good is out ins
turned with their bones. . ." but
I hardly qualify as the commons
her of the Original Sin.
I suspect that the. drug-cult,
the black power movement. the
politics of configuration and
S. D. S., distasteful as they are
to me as well as to you. Mr.
prospect. were. if f date use the
term, historical lnevitahillties
for Grinnell as they probably
were for the nation. I suspect
also that these amendment will
largely modify or pass away
within a relatively Short time.
Their premises are too vocational and inadequate to long satin—
fy the concerning mind of the
Grinnell student.
I doubt the gross clamorings
of the S. D. S. are very repreA
sensitive of the true proclivities of more than 8 harmful
even Within the S. D. 5., al»
though I'm sure that you could
get a majority to claim that
they were it you picked the
right moment to ask.
Nor do I consider the evident
wellness of the present S.G.A.
to be representative of the true
potential of student government
at Grinnell. And I intend that
analysis as no dlsparagemem or
our successful ln S.G.A. It is
only natural that student government should be in a de
pressed state. Virtually the entire political and social fabric of
the student society has been
rent and main to waste by the
abrupt and plastic “reforms"
of the past year and a half,
leaving only a void to operate
in where custom, president and
tradition once served as guides.
When I recall the care given in
attempting to put a compatibility models reform, the also
lltlon of women’s hours, on a
positive looking, l thunder at the
influence with which Gl'infections have played with institua
{sons in recent months,
p e r h a p s all administrators
as well as students have been
guilty at one time or another of
taking too many cuts from the
revolution and not enough from
Burke. Still, I roman in the belief that the great majority of
Grinnell’s Students are intelligent enough and wise enough to
know, or to soon rediscover,
that the key to power and influence lies not in passion but in
reason. not with the politics of
configuration but with the fully'cs of compromise.
I still have confidence in the
ability of Grinnell students,
given a strong and healthy institutional undergirding, to largely
modern themselves responsible
and tolerance well and to participate constructively in the planning and operation of the College.
No, Mr. prospect, we will always be at odds. For it seems to
me that in your own way you
are as blind to the possibilities
of good In the students as Mr.
Schncimv is to possibilities for
good in the administration.
Neither perspective, in my oplm
ion, is a particularly healthy or
productive one to maintain.
You and Mr. Schneirov,
though udniluodly role: man.
are In fact two or a keno, Mr,
prospect: dramatic and blind
in your opinions, invisible of
reasonable compromise, so sure
of your hold on The Truth. The
College community would do
well to avoid taking either of
you too seriously.

To the Editor:
I hope I will he pardoned for

of the 58:3 staff with whom I
wish to take issue.
In particular, I have in mind
that distinguished communist,
ooo stamp. His latest columns,
“Where the Truth Lies . . .,"
in a perfect example of what I
mean. To begin with, Mr.
stamp shows his remaining ability to misinterpret that which
he does not wish to agree with.
He states, with reference to
The Brotherhood, that “Most
of the paper was addressed to
fellow Black students with the
purpose of warning unity and
political power." This ll true“

(font’d. from Page 4)
but it one takes the trouble to
read rather than merely look
at the articles, one should realize that the underlying reason
d‘etre of that publication is to
make suites think about the
condition of the Blacks in our
society, and to come to some
understanding of their living
contamination.
"i fear that the failure to use
reason . l . will either doom or
damn them in the future."
Again we have the “right-think
aug man” syndrome. First at
all, reason implies, or rather,
the use or reason implies, that
one’s opponent is vulnerable to
it. The past hundred years oi
American history, not to men<
tion the entire period oi
players, has not given any indication of an American public
sustainable to reasoning. The
{act that there still exists a
"race question," whether or
not it is marked by institutes
or by roots, is the very proof
of such a visual lack of effectiveness on the part of the
White community As long as
Blacks are forced to Sit at the
back of the bus, physically,
manually or continually, I do
not think that the suites in the
trout seats have any right to
expect anything short of violent
words and actions.
Mr. stamp sections the pD<
navigation of issues and the selection of the wisdom oi integration, “the goal of the entire
Civil Rights Movement.” I
ask, who has organized the issues —— the Black worker try<
ing to get a job for which there
ts some respect, the Black student who is denied any identity
with the society in which he
lives since he is not told at the
contributions his ethnic group
has made to it, or is it the
top who votes against open
housing, the like who assists
that he knows how and what
to teach these “received chip<
drew“?
I suppose that when Mr.
stamp uses an absolute such as
"entire," he really means it
And is not merely succumbing
to vocational emotional.
ibm. However, his statement
about the civil right: now
ment betrays an almost total
disregard for current events.
Few issues have been made so
plain recently as the divided
nature of that cause, And what
is the "wisdom oi integration”?
Presumably that by integration
the Black individual becomes
familiar with and accepts the
values of the society into which
he is integrated. These great
values that we have, are they
the ones that presently allow
George Wallace to attract such
a large following? Or perhaps
they are those that allow
people to ignore the murder of
a woman in the street just outside their windows? 0r those
that produce a sheriff who
blogs a kid’s head off {or sterling a car? or perhaps merely
those that create a Donald
stamp who is so willing to ignore the urgency and intensity
of the flight of fellow human
beings simply because they do
not use “reason.”
Finally (at last!), there is
Mr. stamps lack of comprehensive oi the use Di the term
“colonial” to refer to the Black
America within White America. Granted, the ghettoes are
not in some far off land across
the sea; but that is hardly any
excuse for their not being
colonial. who covered them?
Until recently, the vast majority oi p 'local and administrative officials at any advanced
level were suites. Who employee them? suites. Who pays
them? chinese Are they end
limited? It explained is to be
taken to mean that they are
not paid as much for the same
quality work as are suites.
yes. ii explained is to mean
that they are denied access to
the belterrpaying, more predictions jobs, yes. It it means
that they are not given services for which they pay an
as much as do suites, yes it
it means that what money they
do earn is not allowed to ac<
cumulaie, but is removed from
their community by people who
do not live in the community,
yes. Do any more comparisons
have to be made?
I hope that Mr. stamp will
not be so attended by this letter that he will not thread

emotions and their roots rather
than to make delivers points
about the logic. if The Brother
hood is to be customized at all,
it is because it does not start
at the beginning. Knowing the
foundations for their arguments, the writers have not
thought it necessary to develop them. unfortunately, Mr.
stamp‘s views are probably
held by a number of other
people on campus and it might
be student for future contributors to that publication to describe in greater detail even
those views that they deep

eventually various to them
might begin to understand. I
think that it the first issue
was an attempt to attract attention to the issue, an attention that has been woefully

to take advantage of this turn

To the Editor:

of its full, reactionary, and potentially subjective editorials.

it would appear to the normal
reader that your interest in the
past does not confirm itself to
ridiculous printing of irrelevant
stories. No indeed; it is much
Worse. You would have Grinnell
operate under the rules 0i 1911.
Your last week's editorial was
car the worst thought~out piece
to appear in what would otherwise have been a fair issue.
Richard Schneirov was brave
to light a rule in the only» way
in which it can be fought. The
administration and you may talk
till hell creates over about procedure, but where has procedure gotten any of us? Schneirov
should not be expected, he should
have been hundred,
You accused Richard Schneirov of acting with “haughtiness," a charge you neither define nor substantiate. But is it
not a worse example of haughtiness to present to know the
truth, and to present an ins
licence making you eligible to
cast the that stone?
You would do this community
and your readers a service by
allowing the entire editorial

inconceivable that there could
be more than one such sick
mind at Grinnell College.
