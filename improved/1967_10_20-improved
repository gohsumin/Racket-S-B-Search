TOWN AND COLLEGE
Relations between the young people of Grinnell and the students 0t Grinnell College are at a very low point. The mortality
can be travel back to the objectionable behavmr of a few persons
on each side: "towards" who steal from college rooms and younger
and vandalize college property, and “college queens” whose actions downtown are resulting to the possibilities of local residents.
Fear on each side that the respective ways of life are in
danger, and the subsequent rumors and illustrations, have led
to mortality toward all members of the opposite group.
College students have two responsibilities: we must be relevant
of the “titles” and we must make sure they are relevant at us.
“cookies” who steal and vandalize must be caught and turned
over to the police. “cookies” who normally and physically abuse
metro students must be identified, and complaints filed with the
police immediately.
Police Chief meters is firmly dedicated to the maintaining of
law and order in Grinnell, but he is handicapped by the residence of students to press charges and produce witnesses. We
must be willing to lace the problem and deal with it directly.
The 5&3 pages President suggest to work to establish a towncollege commission to examine the difficulties between college
students and young townspeople. The problem wants study; it
must be eliminated soon.
ANTI-WAR PETITION
The 5&3 pages all members of the Grinnell community to
llgn the anti-war petition being calculated by GSM. watches and
draft card burning have their places, but the political implications of positions calculated among college students are far reaching.
The most obvious response by the Johnson Administration is
to discuss such positions as the work of idle college noise-makers.
The coming majority of many students and the rapidly approachIng election year should, however, member this view. A series of
such positions on college computer around the country would
certainly help to push the peace question into the forefront in this
coming election year.
Let those of us who have been active in the peace movement
be the first to sign this important document. And let those of us
.who are just marketing to our responsibilities as citizens and
yeaccloving people make signing the petition our first commons
merit. Let us show President Johnson that the new voters of the
United States are opposed to his war.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR
lllllliillllllillllliillllllillllllillllllillllllllHillilllllillllllllll
To the Editor:
Due to some of the response
to the letters posted around
campus accounting a “drug
discussion and aid service” be
ing implemented, we would like
to clarity a few points:
1. The major project to he
carried out is a regular seminar to be held at ali-Loco, Several students are working together to plan it, and the first
meeting is effectively scheduled for Wednesday, November
I.
2. The “old" service, if begun, can be no more than an
information service. No HaightAshbury “main switzerland" is
being planned, and there is no
Intention of playing with illegality. Nevertheless, as dnlg
use threads, people may want
advice. No such service now
exists, and if anyone has suggestions or advice. put a note
in Box 513.
3. Perhap most importantly
the seminar will not be promoting drugs. Hopefully, it will
air opinions and facts. Pot and
most hallucinogenics are illegal,
and that is a fact that no one
should forget. But, they exist,
and need to be examined, because they are so widespread
and reﬂact the society in which
they are used. The seminar is
not being addressed to the
“head" on campus, but to
everybody.
We hope this letter cheats up
n new oi the fears and objectives that have been expressed.

I usually disease the drama
or newlymimeugraphed documents, but when I opened my
copy of the coleman report
Wednesday night I generally
hoped for something.
What I hoped for—roughly
examined and paraphrased—was just a paragraph some
thing like this:
“The Special committee on
Educational Policy and Curriculum recommends that every
Grinnell student have the op
tion of taking a semester of
out-campus work. Such students
would be placed in jobs in
large cities by the college of-
ﬁce of placement.”
What I hoped for, alan, was
Antioch. l . or maybe Beloit.
. . ,but never, I guess, Grinnell.
The paragraph wash’t there,
but a little autobiography, 1
think, is necessary here.
Last week I took a little
mindrsobering solomon to Boston
for six days. I didn't go to visit
there: I went to live there.
And I lived with some people
from Beloit engaged, as it
were, in just the kind of program 1 want to talk about
(or talk around.)
They—excuse me, we—shared
an apartment. It’s really a very
fun thing to separate an apartment and live and cook for
yourself.
They went to work at typically workaday jobs — at the
Harvard Co-op or insurance
companies—every morning.
And i went to work every
morning. . . following them.
I’m not sure What it is I
want to tell you, because actually the column this week is
nothing more than one healthy
high.
But they were learning how
to live away from Grinnell and
—for six days—so was i.

Dr. village biology I would appeal to the intellectual that
links in all of us somewhere
between nursing and the North
Lounge. I want to examine the
medical problem at Grinnell
and do What most critics actor

The main problem with Grin<
hell's medical help is that the
college has little or no control
over‘it. If the student is opportunity enough to contract
more than a cold, he is referred by the health center to
any one of several town doctors who somehow have been
appreciated a share in the student business. That doctor may
or may not be competent but
in any event he examines the
student and then applies to the
insurance company that carries
the college health insurance and
receives from it a standard
fee. (In one case two years
ago the fee was eight dollars
for two minutes' time; the time
was issueﬁevent.)
The student receives a receipt from the insurance coming and the case is closed.
n other words. the town doctor, always busy with his town
patients who provide the bulk
of his business and are an unfortunately important part of
his income, can nevertheless
in a year’s time accrue a
healthy—is that the word?—
parliamentary income from his
student patients. And with that

Grinnell is a doctor‘s market.
A throwing practice is possible
if the doctor concentrates on
faithfully caring for town patients. His time is understand
able created; his town patients
are important. So he can afford
to look at the transport student,
that adolescent hypochondriac
planned with problems of love
and gradepoint, with a certain
disease. He can expect to hear
certain common complaints from
students who wonder into his
office when he is so busy. He
can learn to ignore those complaints. He can learn to ask
the simple questions that her<

have a test tomorrow?" is one.
or “Aren't you just worried
about your grades?" Or he
might ask the ultimate question

“Are you having emotional
problems? Perhaps you need a
psychiatrist." He can then dis<
miss the student assured of his
eight dollars or whatever and
look after his town patient
whose future business with him
is not quite as assured as the
student."
And what of the student?
Usually his illness inn't serious
enough that such medical interference will cause permanent
damage A few days and one
is generally well. But in those
rare cases where damage does
occur, permanent or temporary,
how does one prove interference? It is difficult to do so
legally; it is quite pussy 1e»
rally. But more than that, it
is simply difficult to know sometimes whether the damage incurred could have been average.
It is sometimes impossible to
know In cases of sudden injury or illness the student has
no resource but to place his
faith in the conference oi nearby physicians. And if that faith
is unjustified, then What?
But. someone will ask. is it
really as bad as all that in
the town of Grinnell? Well, see
for yourself. That question and
answer, however, is really irrelevant. The fact is the college has little control over that
answers it runs a competent
health service—but only that.
But how is the college going
to assure its students that they
will always have a competent
physician? Or is medical uncertainty a basic part of a
Grinnell liberal arts education?
One possible solution to the
pmblem is simple but—as simple solutions may be~expensive.
The college could hire its own
physician on a dealtime basis
with an apple salary. The physician would care exclusively
for all students, for the faculty
and their families, and also
expertise the present health
center. The physician would thus
be assured a large enough chi<
entire—and the students would
always be assured competent
medical help in any emergency.
or course, there is a great difficulty in this proposal—finding
such a physician. The admin<
isolation recognized the medical problem at Grinnell and in
now considering this and other
suggestions.
Considering the problem. however, is not necessarily going
to solve it. Something must be
done. The inadequate medical
service in Grinnell has long
been acknowledged beautifully,
jokingly. by faculty and students
alike. A college that is raising
money for a PE complex can
certainly afford to do something
about its medical service. The
question is whether it has the
will to do it—to give the medIcal problem a lu'thorough
priority that it can be solved
soon. One can only hope it will
be solved before we memorialize an unwelcome matter.

COUNCIL EXPLAINS ROLE
By CRAIG ALLIN
Inst week, Grinnell’s new
student-faculty Judicial Council
contents to talk informally
about its role. The Council is
composed of processors Joseph
Danforth (Chemistry), Harold
Fletcher (Political Science), and
Arnold Adelberg (Mathematics)
whom the council has chosen
chairman. Sue postal, Larry
Frank, and Russell Heuckendorf represent the student body.
The faculty members were
appointed by President suggest,
on the recommendation of the
Chairman of the Faculty, Joseph Wall. The student members were chosen by a joint
committee of the AWS Board
and the Council of House treatments after intervention applicants. Their appointments were
confirmed by the Senate.
Members of the council talked
exclusively about their role in
the community and it was apparent that the campus is in
for a major change in the
handling of medical cases.
postal arrested the structural
differences between the Judicial
Council and the old court system. The old judicial structure,
with three student courts, the
'means and the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, was
characterized as documented and
legalistic. D o s t a 1 pointed
out that jurisdictional disputes
were common in the past in
suite of the corporate jurisdie
signal guidelines set down in
the Student Handbook.
The Judicial Council's charter gives it original jurisdiction
in all cases where jurisdiction
is not with the house councils.
it has satellite jurisdiction in
all cases. Council members em.
realized that any member of
the campus community could
bring cases before the council
but suggested that they might
return some cases to the house
councils, where the houses have
jurisdiction.

which has been accomplished.
The old Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs, which now deals
exclusively with policy making,
has been recovered and now
consists of three represents<
files each of the faculty, administration, and student body.
This separation allows the Judicial Council to deal with judicial matters exclusively.
It was evident that all the
council members were pages to
fulfill the highest expectations
of the creature of the new council. There was general agreement that a consistent council
policy was essential. This does
not mean however. Fletcher arrested, that cases will
not be judges in context, teaching all relevant facts. “The
stress," F l e l. c h e r continued,
“must be on problem solving,‘
not on the mating out of investments."
While council members were
not spyware of their differences, there was a defining sense
of unity. Fletcher suggested that
the faculty members were just
that, and were not the reply«
sensitive of the administration.
To this Heuckendorf added that
it was their hope to escape student or‘ faculty parochial interests and speak for the whole
community. it was evident that
the council member hoped to
achieve liability in most of
their decisions.
Several members emphasized

ed consistency based on entertaining which Fletcher pointed out would allow for the
rational appraisal of the consequences of certain violations
based on court decisions. The
council appears to be trying to
friend itself as much as possible toward a problem solving
approach to its work.
The council was understandably silent about some crucial
specifics of rule notification.
it seems probably that only
preliminary discussions have
been held in this area. The following things, however. became
clear during the discussion.
First, the council recognized the
seriousness of using separation
from the college as a punishment, though the possibility of
its use in particularly serious
cases was not discounted. second, the council is cognitive oi
the unsatisfactory and opportunity allocation of penalties
which occurred under the old
structures. postal made it
clear th at she fell, “past

Doug link and Mike dchwarts
were clearly the heroes oi the
game. With the apparent device of the warranty—Seymour
combination, link and Schwarts
appear to be the new midwest
passing situations. Schwartl
caught seven passes and set
Grinneli record for total yards
gained by a receiver (106) and
most touchdown passes caught
in one game (A). link narrowly missed setting a third
aerial mark in completing 10 of
17 passes for 156 yards and no
interventions.
Saturday’s game provided
many traveling moments for the
half-capacity crowd. After a
awareness first quarter. during

to play football and scored
twice; once on a quarterback

again on a 13 yard pass from
Clark to Jim wallace. Only one
PAT try was successful and the
game ended with Grinnoli winning 40-20.
The Knox game pointed out
many of the Pioneer strengths
and businesses. The team demonstrated that they could certain successful drives (27, 38,
so, 49, or and 49 yards) and
perform with a balanced ah
back (288 yards pushing and
175 passing). Defense proved to
be a problem for the Pioneers
in the last minutes of each
half. All of the Knox points
occurred within six minutes oi
the end of the half. This perhaps more than anything also
illustrated how the lack of new]:
is hunting the Pioneer hopes.

THE iiiBlTZEii ,
By JOHN R“
The Standard American bidding system places right limitations on only one opening bid, the bid of One NoTrump. opened
must have between fifteen and fighters high card points, and no
suit reader than Qx or xxx. Because of the clarity of definition in
this bid, responded can exercise several choices in his responses.
if he has no preference for play in a suit, he will bid directly
the following NoTrump contracts:
2 NoTrump, with 8 or 9 points or 7 and a good five card suit.
8 No’l‘jump. with 10 to 14 points
4 NoTrump. with 15 to 16 points (if opened has maximum
he bids 6)
6 NOTlump, with 17 or 18 points
working old then a NoTrump, with two points (if opened has
maximum he bids 7)
1 No'l‘jump, with 21 points.
If he has spam infections he may jump directly into the 4d
member Convention. 4C-Partner. how many ages? (dB-zero or three.
iii-one, ds-two.)
If he has a preference for e suit contract and has a weak or
very strong hand he may use Jacoby Transfer Bids. These are
used in order to keep the strong hand concerned.
relay principle:
They use the
2D, relay bid 0-8 points, opened must bid 2H.
2H, relay bid same as above but opened must bid 25.
25, relay bid same as above but opened must bid INT; suspended signs off at 3c Dl‘ 5D.
if after opened has bid, responded needs;
this shows a strong
hand with invitation to spam. The precise requirements should be
decided by the partnership; for example. 14 or more points and a
strong constitutional hand would be reasonable.
If responded has between B and 12 or 13
points and a good
d—card major suit(e) he will want to know if opened has Hard
support for a game in that major. He uses then the italian Conn
mention by bidding 2C. This bid can be game forming or non-fucking. in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer Bids it should be
game forming. opened’s bids are then:
2H or ZS, shows Hard major; bid 2H with both
2D, denial of l-card major; min. Nonmp hand
2N, denial of i-card major; max. NoTrump hand
responded then intense to raise partner’s Zn or 25 bid to
game; otherwise he rapids his suit consequently or raises NT in
game.
if responded has a long semisolid suit which can lose no more
than one trick and a possible outside entry. or if he has I readymade suit (like AKQJxx); he can show that suit by directly bidding it at the three level: 3C, 3D, 3H, 35.
it he has a long topless major suit with d or 6 playing tricks
and a weak hand with no more than 10 points, he can show it by
using the Texas Transfer Bids which also operate on the relay
principle:
41), relay bid opened must bid 4H. responded passes.
in, relay bid opened must bid 45
There is probably a good play for game.
The {our level can also be reserved for the first Culbertson
Asking Bid (see The Kibitzer, Sept. 22). And. of course. if Ro<
sponsor has a weak hand and a preference to play the next one.
he may pass.
