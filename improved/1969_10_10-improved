Complete Text of President’s
Letter on Financial Problem
To: The Faculty promo Glenn suggest
At their meeting last week in Des points the Executive Committee of the Trustees asked the means and me to make the following kind of statement to the faculty:
The Trustees are proud of the academic reputation of Grinnell
and know that the similarly promises and accomplishments of its
students are a direct reflection of the conference and energy of
a superior faculty. The Trustees are committed to maintaining
such a faculty and they realize that such a commitment involves
a steady improvement of faculty salaries, of research funds and
facilities, of Sabbatical leave arrangements, and other “fridge"
benefits. The Trustees are aware that the general physical and
emotional environment in which faculty work and live is crucial
to recruiting and keeping a productive faculty.
At the same time, the Trustees wish the faculty to be especially cognitive that the immediate future posts the same great
financial problems for Grinnell as it does for all institutions
of higher education. Costs in salaries and Wages, in financial
aids for students, in construction and remodeling, in Student aud administrative services are rising much more rapidly
than revenues. A expressed market, anxiety about the outcome
of proposed tax legislation affecting foundations and charitable
gifts, and yet the continuing general inflationary trend all contribute and will probably continue to contribute to the increasing
difference between projected income and projected expenditures.
The Trustees are concerned, not awarded. The equipment
portfolio or the college has been steadily increasing in value over
the past few years, and it IS quite probably, assuming the same
rate of growth, that at some time in the future earnings root-n equipment will play a greater share than they do now in helping
to bring projected income and expenditures closer together. At
this moment, however, and in the near future, earnings from equipment do not provide sufficient funds to ease substantially the
amount of gifts required each year to balance the operating but—
get. The giti requirements each year. accordingly, have steadily
increased; and, though the college has been more successful than
almost any of its competitors in security gifts, the gap between
required and realized gift income is increasing too last.
Accordingly, the Trustees wish to request the faculty to give
careful consideration to the following possible ways of alternative
the financial problem:
(1) Increasing the faculty-student ratio by a reduction
in faculty numbers.
(2) increasing enrollment without increasing the number of faculty.
(3) Increasing the proportion of fund! which studentFINANCIAL TEXT— _ (Continued on Pop I. Col. 0

Rally Call for Student Power
"Every student on this campus needs at determining role
in making college decisions,"
student senator Bill Thomas
told some 200 students at a
rally In front of the Forum last
Friday (Octr 3).
"Committees w i t h student
representatives don’t deal with
the basic, central decisions
that affect the college, but with
the smaller betty things,"
Thomas assisted. “Students
have to get together, with the
goal of more student decisionmaking power.
“Nothing is going to be done
it the majority of students allow only the activists and radi-
£215 to take action,” he continued, “The need for unity is
parameter."
The rally was originally call<
ed to discuss Dean Alice Low’s
re-definition oi the resident ad—
video role in the college drug
click. However, because Dean
ow responded the policy several hours before the rally,
speakers shipped the focus of
their remarks to the matter of
the students’ role in college decision-mailing.
“Grinnell students are sati5<
tied, ordered, mobile, happy,
and conventional," Instructor
Alan G. master (Philosophy)
told the crowd.
“There is a myth on the East
Coast that Grinnell College is
full of students who are normally aware and politicians conscious," master said, “but this
place inn’t anything filme its
reputation for being alive and
Vital.
“It is possible for students
to be aware of their powerlessness, but you people are not
aware." N a s s e r continued.
“Students here seem to acquiesce in the fact that they have
no power to participate in the
decisions that affect them.”
master also said that trade—
tlonaily the faculty has amended
the greatest power at Grinnell.
“It's my perception that they
set policy,” he commented.
“You should get together and
make a formal decision as to
whether or not you want to participate in the power structure
here,” master told the students.
"I would hope that a Con»
schools group would energy
from the student body and
start talking, concerning, and
acting on the basis at reflection
on matters such as these,"
master Concluded.
Senior Tom Thomas told the
crowd that students are presently involved in “a tokenistic
system of decision-making.” He
tried students to organize and
every pressure on faculty and
administration for equal student representation in decisionmaking.
“You must let them know
that you don’t recognize the
present decision-making proc—
rss as valid," he said.
Junior student senator Bill
stranger told those at the
rally that "Grinnell College institutionalizes evanescence.”

The Moratorium motion, which

on Oct. 15. The support or the
Moratorium did not include a

by the faculty, however, and
such a policy statement did not
come up for general debate.
“This is a declaration of both

The most interesting occurrence at Tuesday's meeting
was a move by Grinneli Women’s Lib ion to eliminate
the institution of the HomecomIng Queen. Sally l-lamann told
the Senate that the idea behind
the Homecoming Queen is resulting and upgrading to com<
en. She pointed out that the
queen is judges by how she
looks, not what kind of woman
she is. The woman is viewed
as an object rather than as a
person. Furthermore, nominations are made only by males,
and the queen usually ends up
n education because of our
culture's artificial standard of
what. is beautiful.
She pointed out that the landscape victory of Dick "The
Kid" mexican for Homecoming
Queen last year is an indication that the students do not
want a Homecoming Queen.
However, there was some feelIng expressed by some students
at the meeting that The Kid
was elected as a jan end that
a majority or students might
want a Homecoming Queen.
After 45 minutes of debate and
discussion, the Senate officially
recommended to the Student
Affairs Committee and President suggest sbolishment or the
institution of Ho rn e c om in g
Queen at Grinneli College. A

Will be held later this semester.
The Senate approved student
representatives on the Library
and Admissions committees,
and also approved sophomore
Jon klein as the new Social
Coordinator, to fill the balance
created by senior Lee chambers's designation.
Senator Bill Thomas asked
the senate to approve a motion calling for telephone votes
to approve remaining committee positions as fast as possible. This motion passed, the
senate receiving that these
committees should have been

Student coordinator Frank
Thomas brought to the Senate
a proposal by Dean Connie
Kimbro dealing with “the parking problem” on campus. It
called for the registration ot
all cars with the means, who
would issue parking stickers to
authorized students, according
to the motor vehicle rules
stated in the Student Handbook.

wanted to take over this fund<

questioned the need for this
whole procedure, and wanted
to talk to combo about whether
the “problem” was severe
enough to merit the rather
strict measure.
The student Coordinator’s office has received numerous
complaints about line cutting at
the dining calls. Line letters
are subject to $1 times as they
were in the past, with house
treatments and senators enhancing the rule and collecting the
times. which go to SGA.
Finally, I have been asked
to inform the student body that

at 9:30 in Roberts Theater.

threatens to follow the lead of
many cities and perhaps the
country as a whole in becoming

unified without a sacrifice in
autonomy for anyone, but rather with the increase in freedom
and power that accompanied the
evolution from independence to
interdependence.
As with the American society,
dog use at Grinnell has become
the preeminent simpson of a
deeper conflict, and as such is
eventually the most textile area
in which to begin a resolution
of that conflict. The following
suggestions should be considered
as a star-king point in formulat—
ing a portable and non-emotional policy toward drugs and drug
use at Grinneli:
(1) organize the students already helping other students
who suffer adverse drug reactions or need information about
drugs into a network so that

New SAGA Checking System Causes Controversy
By holly McGuIru
Has the Grinnell student ii<
rally been reduced to a cum-
her? Is the new checking systems in the dining calls really
necessary? Or will it even do
the job it has been set up to
do —- namely, keeping the
fighters students newly-executed from board less out of
the dining calls?
These were just a new at the
questions raised as the new
checking method went into affect last Monday at Cowles and
the Quad. The system, in at:
oordailce with a provision of the
references of last week allowing the fighters exemption, re
guides each river to give his
meal card number to a checked at each meal before eating.
Although this honor . number
system is not as strict as a
meal card presentation system,
it nevertheless is a change from
the previous related policy or
allowing entrance to the dining
calls without any term oi identification.
According to Business Manager Ralph Poinerenk, both the
business office of the college
and Saga saw the need for some
way or checking who ate in the
dining calls, ii any option were
to be put into operation. “When
you have options or paying
board or not,” Pometznk said,
“you have to have more than
the honor system iii the dining
calls. Saga can't need everyone
that Comes to the door, and the
college can't administer the
program (of options) unless
there is some system of checking who cats. We can’t actors

Pomerenk said that he had
originally recommended to the
Student Affairs Committee that

would eliminate many problems created by the number
checking method. But the committee “worked him down" to
the present “journal honor and

Student Coordinator Frank
Thomas, the SAC decided that
the number system would he
the most efficient, yet minimal,
method the college would accept.
The checking system was
fully described in the referred

approval. But there are come

students who either didn’t vote

once it is causing by forming
students to remember their one,
two or three-digit number and
tell it to a checked in the line.
One state student voices the
complaint that he “didn’t cum
to Grinnell to be a number" and
that now Grinneli has joined
the "number cult" along with
big universities, Those sharing
this view, in order not to be
forced to go against their moral
principles, are allowed to show
the checked their meal card,
and thus bypass identifying
themselves by a number. (actually, every student is not only
a meal card number, but also a
computer number to the college.)
Questions have been raised as
to the effectiveness of the new
system in keeping out nonboarders since numbers could
be duplicated at both dining
calls and anyone can use any
number as long as it hash't
been used already at a party-
'color meal. Fomerenk realized
that the system has "potential
leads," but none of these businesses were unanticipated. The
success or the system depends
upon the cooperation or the
builders, or, as (Saga) Chuck
Hand, Food Service Director,
said, “the system will work as
well as the students want it to
work."
Several dissatisfied students
have suggested that instead or
checking all the owners, pictures
or the 18 be posted in each dining hall, with perhaps a line imposed if they should show their
race in either place. The storementioned distributed student
explained, “other all, we’re not
a vast, wireless mass, and it
inn’t fair to be inconveniencing
1100 people to be convenient ion
18.”
clips proposed “mug shot"
system would not be enough,
according to 'Tomerenk and
Hand, because there would be
no assurance that the non<
builders would be recognized
and identified it they should
show up for a free meal.
Since the checking system has
been in direct only live days,
all has not been said or realized
about it. Pomerenk feels that It
is “sharing down reasonably
well, and will probably gain
more acceptance as checked:
gain more speed.” Hand be<
pieces that like any new system.

and Others, at least one of
these hints may help to speed
you on your way.
Planning The Trip — Unless
you are extremely familiar
with the area you will be travelling, pick up a map. You
may not wind up going exactly
the way you planned. Try to
stay on heavily traveller
routes. The best way to get
stranger is to be let nut on a
county road. Stay away from
holidays and turnpikes. Lots or
handles from copy there. Avoid
going through cities unless you
plan to stay in one. Once you
are into a city it is often very
difficult to get out. Plan to average between 30-54) mph for
any distance over four hours
normal driving distance.
corporations — Take the
phone numbers of as many
people as possible who live be
green your origin and destination. Take some addresses, tool
Make sure you have enough
cash. Twenty dollars is a good
amount. Have it in small bills
and keep it in several tliiierent

Very new members carry signs.
Dress — Look wholesale. Not
very many people will pick up
nipples. if you have long hair,
get a stopping cap. Boots are
good (under your pants). If it’s
cold, make sure you dress
warm enough. You can always
take something on. Layers or

The Beatles controversy continues to rage, but their music
seems to suffer not at all.
Rumors on campus persian that
a secret island or part or an
island exists; to there, devout
groupies (of any sex) with sufficient information about the
"mystery," are chicken.
The Beatles' new album,
Abbey Road is allegedly named
for a London street also called
Abbey Lane. Since Abbey Lane
is the exrwﬂe of human bandleader easier sugar, this has
been seen as a reference to
Cuba. It is also pointed Out

But, I don’t believe any of
that shit. In this tight new record composed 01 16 brief
tracks, Paul (even if his shoes
are off on the jacket) and the
others are very much alive and
making beautiful music. As always, the Beatles provide us
with the main event of the
musical season. it goes without
saying that George Martin
(who some say dress't exist)
has done a fine job of moms
trading and financing, the
lyrics are great, etc. . . . And
the music gets better, it possible a bingo is starting to

something to say to everyone

“once there was a way to get

it's too late, and we'll have I!)

[1' A Cup Stops You — You
are a student. ship out your

Where To Get Out — Get out

It’s often better to get out at
a turnroll to a big city than at
Pndunk two miles down the
road. it a driver is going to Nowhere, always get out at the

Short rides are generally a
waste unless you think it will
get you to a better place to

The most important thing to
successful matching is to think
before you go. Good travelling.
