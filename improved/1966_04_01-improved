In Series of Hall firewire Meetings
By DICK CHADY
“The ad how Committee on Residence calls” was explained to Stu»
cents through a series of “firewire
thats" by SGA President Steve
Kent on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday oi this week, Kent, accompanied by Associate Dean
Richard centers and by the CofHF
and AWS Board treatments on
their respective computer, explained the reasons for the committee. its membership, and the
procedure it will follow
Kent explained that his Visits to
the calls had two purposes: "(1)
to disney any possible apprehensions about the recommendations
of'tale Executive Council, and (2)
to let students know that we are
interested in their opinions, and
that they should take the time to
write out their views for the committee."
Kent explained that the committee would give equal consideration
to the opinions or students or
groups of students and to the Executive Council proposals. lie
added that “There is no commit
ment on anybody’s part to any
particular change or to a change
in itself,”
He said that he and centers had
accepted their jobs as co-chairman
with the understanding that they
were not committed to recommend
any change unless they felt it necessary,
centers commented that the
committee was beginning its work
"without commitment to any proposals" and that it would not; necessarily limit itself to the residence
hall system, but would welcome
student opinions on “any part of
student life beyond the classroom.”
In addition to Kent and centers
as co—chairman, the ad how com»
little is composed oi Bob state,
Karen Lauterbacll, Dave Shellenbarger, women Norton (history),

Two Girls ‘Wit-hdraw' Before Break
After General Conduct Violations
By BOB HODIERNE
Two sophomore girls, a
Main Hall resident and 3
Cleveland Hall resident, were
asked to withdraw from school
on March 12, the day before
spring vacation .
The pair had' originally
been discussed from school
but an appeal on their part
allowed them to withdraw.
The office of the means
states that the official reason
the two were asked to withdraw came under the terms
of the general conduct clause
in the Student Handbook. The
clause says, in effect, that the
school may ask a student to
leave if hi5701' her‘general
conduct inn’t beginning that of
a member of the college com»
munich.
At the same time, however,
the means say there were
specific reasons for the discussed.
The Main Hall resident had
recently been reported absent
from the Quad after hours.
She was reported by an an-
 
olympus phone call to Dean
of Women Jean Sloccum.
The girl felt, however, that
this “particular charge was
not the reason l was asked to
leave, It just brought me to
their attention.”
The second girl, the Cleveland resident,-certified to the
means that the Main Hall girl-L3
spent the night in question in
Cleveland Hall studying,
It was out of this incident,
say the means, that the re
created withdrawal grew.
The means report that they
were convinced that the Main
girl was absent from the
Quad. Further, say the means,
an coordinate number of students — both student officers
and non~student officers -—
were convinced that the girl
was out of the Quad overnight.
The means felt, therefore.
that the Cleveland girl had
died to protect the Main girl.
The Cleveland girl was already on conduct promotion
for a variety of expenses in-

Kuntz Accepts Offer at story U.
After fighters Years at Grinnell,
By PAUL R. JONES
Paul G. Kuntz (philosophy and
religion) is leaving in 1966 to take
over the position at head or the
philosophy department at story
University His departure comes
alter fighters years in varied positions from assistant professor in
1948 to Noble Professor in 196}.
Before coming to Grinnell, Pro
lesson Kuntz held the jobs or assistant to the dean at Harvard
University, and served as a minister in constitutional and nondenomiriational churches in Vermont and Massachusetts. He has
had a rigorous education as an un»
dergraduate at Haveriord and as
a graduate student at Harvard Uni- .
version where he received three degrees including his PhD.
Dantorth Fellow
Last January, Kuntz was awarded a Daniorth Cross-disciplinary
Fellowship out at 130 applications
from throughout the United States.
This fellowship involves study at
a united ‘ in a field out of the

chose religion as his other field,
and story University offered him
the post oi head or the philosophy
department to facility his study
When asked why he was leaving
Grinnell after fighters years, he
mentioned the availability of the
offer, but he also stated that the
position involved a little more than
that. ”As tar as my relationship
with Grinnell is concerned,” he
said, “there are many closely but
no skeletons.”
Less Tension
He said that at story there
would be less tension since he
would be teaching only one course
per semester; he added that he
would be involved in more admin—

would be in a position to be of

has started. These include several
books and innumerable essays on

Those Proposals
This week the longawaited recommendations by
the Executive Council on residence hall organization
were made public (see page 9). The proposals were of
such a nature that student government leaders and the
means were promoted to visit the calls on campus and
remind the students that the recommendations were
just that, recommendations (page 9). The SGA officials and the means made the visits and offered the expectations list anyone should read the proposals with
out this knowledge in the front of his mind and, as a
result, storm nursing basement.
The recommendations are terrible. We don’t feel
they represent a very accurate picture of life on North
Campus. It is assumed that anti-intellectualism runs
company now on North Campus. If the Executive Council thinks that their proposals are going to make healthy, normal twentyayear old men more intellectual than
they are now they are displaying a remarkable naivte.
What the faculty calls a problem on North Campus is
simply the normal behavior of any group like that #
and even at that it’s not as bad as the pictures painted
by its critics.
One particular proposal that we want to discuss
here is their proposal for the establishment of freshmen
directories on North Campus. We could spend all of
this April tools’ Day discussing all of the proposals but
time and space prohibit this. ,
At the start of 1964435 freshmen directories on
South Campus were eliminated. Recently the AWS
Board conducted a survey to see what feeling existed
now on South Campus about freshmen forms. The re—
suits were overwhelmingly in favor of filing freshmen
forms in the college archives and formatting a ho ut
them.
Not so with the Executive Council. They would
aggregate the freshmen from uperclassmen on North
Campus. No more humanities and historical studies
seminars, no more help on scheduling, no more help in
getting into the swing of Grinnell‘s social life,
Further, I think it would create a new concept of
freshmen in the minds of upperclassmen. Under the
current system freshmen make friends not only with
other freshmen but with upperclassmen. They make
friends by constant, day-today contact in the hall. The
chance of friendships being created between freshmen
and upperclassmen under the Executive Council’s system is slim indeed. Rather, freshmen, by being treated
differently by the school. will be treated differently by
the students. Now, after the first few weeks, they are
treated as equals. Under the new proposed system we
think it is charitable that freshmen will be treated as
investors.
The rest of the proposals are certain to receive
widespread attention in the next few weeks. We are
'presented in what the students feel about the proposals ‘
and the so~called North Campus problem. Next week
we will distribute a survey about the problem and solutions. We will appreciate it if you will take time to
fill it out and return it to us.

Most people are merely schizophrenic, but Marshall easier had at least three possibilities. This
condition in itself would not have gathered Marshall,
but for the life of him he could not decide which
one he pl-even-ed.
Sometimes Marshall was a Quaker. Then he was
very quiet and serious, and everyone entered at
him. The buyers made him feel important. superior,
and persecuted, and so he was very happy.
Sometimes he was a Catholic. This stage occurred every Friday. when Marshall ate plate alter
plate of white perth at Billy‘s river (all you can
eat for $1.35). He even ate the bones.
At other times he was a editorial. He store at
the minister and played golf on Sunday earnings
and felt very unholy and free.
Actually, the Quaker liked the Catholic best, but
the Catholic had a congress for the editorial. Of
course, the editorial stored the Quaker.
Like Joe Christmas, Marshall also could not decide to which race he believed. Sometimes, when
he looked Into a mirror at his wan only white skin,
he knew that he could not be That ugly und so
thought he was a metro. Other times he was proud
that he did not have to buy skinrwhiteners and that
he was a pure education. But, when speaking
through the dark streets and back always to Billy’s
river, he felt all the swimming and superhuman
subtlety or an Oriental.
The Catholic disabled the Oriental. though. and
often would not go to dinner with him. He liked
the education. The editorial liked the metro in him
self, but he advised the friends] in the Quaker.
The Quaker leather the Caucasmn in himself but
did not mind it in the editorial. In fact. he almost
liked it there.
The Catholic Oriental usually was a good Demu<
oral and voted for Mayor sales (he had lorgoueu
the guy's real first name» soul- straight times. although he joined the polyester enthusxasts in 1964.
The editorial education Democrat almost killed
him for that, (or he believed in eternal party royalty, but the Catholic metro Republican said, “Hogwash," and let it go at that.
Marshall made the mistake of carrying in 1959,
which was a bad year In other ways. Marshall had
revealed only his Quaker education Republican sell
to petite and lovely holly, and since each of these
designed the others, he had a tough go oi it. Then,
one night in 1961. he weekends as he was falling
asleep and became l editorial metro Democrat
just as holly rolled over and looked at him.
holly was discussed and went home to her mother, Eventually. she regarding a premier, who was
a permanent Hungarian Baptist Conservative.
Marshall was deeply upset by this failure, and
in 1965 he ran off to thesaurus in hope of ﬁusing
recommendation with himself. He became the star of
the sideshow and changed possibilities on the hour
to the sound of a huge long. and for a while he
was content.
But Marshall master fell in love with the lady
snake charter, who detailed that he become 3
Jewish Socialist. In his herein attempt to satisfy his
lover, Marshall burst a blood vessel in his brain and
passed shortly away. His body was prepared, and
the asked were scattered to where the four winds
blow.

In his speech. JeiTy forward
correctly attacked efforts to effect
change “by starring the students
to an vocational ireuzy or by playing political ipolsy with the college administration.” Unlike many
people on this campus, he is can
able of receiving that “the parents, the alumni. the trustees, the
faculty" exist as well as the ﬂu
cents.
However, the son is right about
one thing: forward did maintain
the status que (without depending
it) and for a defining reason. His
aim was clearly in establish “a
year of relative calm in studentadministration relations" (unlike
the son, 1 shall quote in context).
I can only calculate on his rear
sons for seeking this calm, but
perhaps one reason is that Grinnell does have a new president, a
president who might appreciate
not being bumper on with wild «let
months d ring his first year here.
Another reason might be that good
government consists in part of
showing down, of occasionally
integrating [mm the sound and
the jury.
The son Said that forward is
proud of the job he has done this
year, and he should be. for he has
done what he set out to do 7 and
on his own publiclysiaied terms
he has not failed. Perhaps his
terms are not satisfactory to the

Perhaps the most perception ob-

front church where a chart reported that attendance the week
before had been 38 and the collection $5.73, To make “the young
people" feel at home they asked
the students to sing a hymn in

own personal witness to Christ —
and they did, “The Battle Hymn

cleaner effects 'Glass Menagerie’,
Comments on Method and Hopes
BY MARY MALCOLM
"Interest in drama is basic to
interest in literature,” according
to Henry-York cleaner (English),
who makes his debut in direction
with the opening ol The Glass Menagerie next week.
cleaner’s production will be
presented next Tuesday, madness
day, and Thursday at s p.m. in
the Arena Theatre. Cast members
are karen Zimmerman, newbie robot. Ken picks and Chuck Burns.
cleaner chose The Glass Menngerie because at its combined literary valtte, poetry tone, and
small cast. He said he felt a small
cast would be easier to work with
for an uninitiated director.
'because \Villiains’ play is none
realistic. cleaner (eels that de
sign drops, costumes and lighting
are left to the imagination of the
director. “when you read a play,
you turkish the costumes, drops,
and set with your imagination," he
commented. “One gets the basic
training in imagination through the
study of literature.”
“I think that l have directed the
play in the way an English professor‘ would and not someone trained
in drama,” Stener said, “l‘ve
paid little or no conscious attention
to what i assume is taught to and
learned by professional directors.
rm doing it in terms or training
in a literary approach to drama.”
Also relatively new to the theatre
is cleaner's technical director,
lreshman Kit order. The members
of the cast are all veterans, however. Miss Zimmerman appeared
in The Bourgeousie, while Miss Abhott had roles in Virginia Wolf and
See How They Run. picks was also
in See How They Run, as well as
Antigone. Burns was in serious
sex and Tea and Sympathy.
cleaner decided to direct the
play at the suggestion oi Richard
Meyer (speech and theatre), whom
cleaner described as “helpful and
very careful” in the actual direction oi The Glass Menagerie.
“Mr. Meyer was there and would
 
help it I needed him, but I wanted
to do it myself,” cleaner said.
He feels that his set design, use
of music, and stage position are
“natural.” He added. “I’ve tried
to direct the play to confirm to

“It it is a success—it people
lose themselves in it and are convinced by it, it the fact that they
are sitting in a theatre disappears
—the credit belongs entirely to the
way in which the actors present

“The director is a mediator between the playwright and the ac—

Exec. (pencil proposed Frosli rules,
Room Brown 5, Rule Enforcement
Ed. Note: Following is the list of proposals
that the Executive Council handed over to the
ad hub committee on hall representation, The
recommendations are only suggestions and will
not necessarily go into effect. Joseph Wall
(history), a member of the executive council.
pointed out that the ad how Committee will
carefully scrutinize the list of proposals and
is under no obligation to adopt them.
L The Setting Up of Freshman calls,
We recommend that freshman calls be organized on both North and South Campus.
Each freshman hall would be under the supervision of an adult resident who would be
a representative of the student dean. seniors
and seniors, selected by the college, would
live in the freshman calls and act as Coun<
colors; each iipperclasmen given that function would be responsible for 8 to in students,
and Wmlld be romanérated for his work.
The upper-class counseling, under the super‘vision of the adult residents, would be i
sponsored [or rule enforcement. One can
below in each hall would be selected by the
student dean to act as pi‘student of the hall;
this connector would sit on the CofI-lP or
the AWS Board. and would appomt other
counseling to hall offices
2. Assignment to upper-class calls
Students would be assigned to upper-class
calls by the student means at the end of the
fieshman year. The student means would endeavor to honor requests at groups (oi front
Z to 8 students each) who wish to enter the
some upperclass hall, to the degree to which
circumstances permit.
3. structure at Upperclass calls.
Tile Council suggests two possible alternative plans, both of which have met with support:
Version A:
The present mail system would configure,
both on North and South Campus. Greater
mobility would be encouraged, though not informed, on North Campus. Some provisions
would be made to allow groups of from 2 to
3 upperclassmen who wish to join together in
one hall to do so, subject to the approval or
the student dean.
The following changes are recommended
for North Campus hall government: The governing committee of each hall would consist
of a President and Vice President plus a
number nf members named by the hall pi'est
(left (in the manner of South Campus “Baf-
ﬂeboartl”). This committee would be responsible for rule enforcement, and would
meet regularly with the adult resident of the
hall for Consultation and advice,
Other officers may be elected by the ball
(as for example a social chairman and ilitra<
metals chairman), but would not form part
of this committee. Adult head residents living in the ’calls would endeavor to make
themselvesavatlable to advise the governing
body of the hall and to give it needed support.
Version B:
Room drawings would be held each year
on North and South Campus. Students would
thus estate among the calls; hall treatments
would be elected at: large on both computer
Other hall Officers would be named and elect<
ed in record with the procedures now president on South Campus
Men's calls would be governor by committees such as those described ln version A.
Some provisions would be made to allow
groups of students to join together and be
placed in the same hall; these groups would
not exceed 3 students each, and their place
merit would be made subject to the availability of accommodations and to the approval
of the student means.
4. Provisions for Certain Upperclass students.
The Council hopes that some special provisions may be made for senior and junior
students who wish to form interest groups.
or have in mind worthwhile residence arrangements which either from the present
residence hall structure. Such provisions
initial include housing of groups of men or
groups of women in college houses (such as
1127 Park and the White House), the use of
wings oi directories for interest groups, or
the use of off-campus housing. it would be
understood, or course. that any such plans
would be subject to limitations based on the
availability oi space and the need of using
available space; they may also require the
moving of some other students in order to accommodate interest groups.
it is also hoped that the provisions allowing groups oi up to 3 students to enter the
same hall (No 2) or to stay together (No. 313),
will encourage the formation of interest
"groups.” Any specific and right attempt to
plan for “interest groups” seems unfeaSible
at the present time, given the uncertainty as
it) how much desire there exists for this kind
of arrangement. This issue, however, should
be given continued attention: it is hoped that
moves in the direction of “interest groups"
will lead to an improvement in the internet—
dual climate of the campus.
5 Student government
We recommend that the functions of the
student senate as presently defined in iesi»
device small government be taken over by the
AWS Board and soil-lP, sitting country.
The AWS Board and the CofHP, sitting
as committees and displaying with the present trial procedure used in the pro ‘
courts, should take over the responses
of the present primary courts. '
The present Student High Court. the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, and the
Dean's Committee would function as at prev—
ent. Some pmVlslon should be made for the
automatic review by the Dean’s Committee
of all cases handled by student Courts.
Gl Other Matters
Every effort should be made to provide
increased study and recreational space in the
residence calls. Adult head residents should
be employed for upper-class calls; their role
would be advisory rather than disciplinary,
but they would make themselves available to
hall treatments and committees and aid in
rule enforcement when called upon.
The role of faculty advisors to freshmen
and sophomores needs to be studied and defined. in particular, more effort and stress
needs to be placed on the advisory of sopho—
moves, who are all too often forgotten at the
time at which they are making crucial der
options. (Presence ot dramatically interested
adult head residents in the calls may to some
degree alternate the problem.)

The house convicted of two rooms
with a small leaders built on to
the back ot the house. The lean-to

contained the kitchen. Here the
women of the house prepared the
meals on top oi open iii-es.
Tile other room Was the living

Rest After Trip
When we reached the Walnan
home, we._all sat down on the
floor oi the all - purpose living
room to rest ourselves from the
bicycle journey. Soon the women
had cooked something for us to
eat.
The him they prepared was her—
mainly delicious, but even as much
as I liked It, I was unable to eat
hall the amount the male managers of the family ate. I had
warned the family before i came
to cut down on the amount OI
spaces in the good they served to
me, and l was careitti to use magazine tablets in my water. Othetv
Wise, I was able to eat the same
things as everybody else: change
his, rice. day, share, and the many
other varieties of Indittn good that
were served.
Sat brass-logged
We sat cross - logged on the
planners. and metal books of food
were placed in from oi us. No silverware was used; the fingers
work better for eating anyway. Of
course, only men ate with me. According to Hindu custom, women
are not permitted to eat in front
 
of men, so the women of the
house had to eat later at a secure
ate meal.
Alter the meal, we sat in front
at the house relaxtrtg together. A
manage was lit to keep away the
approaching darkness. The naighboring relatives came over to sit
With us. Not much conversation
took place, but I could tell that
they enjoyed each other's come

English except the two college
boys acid myself. I had a lot or
chances to use the few Marathi
phrases that I had learned. How»
ever. despite the handicap oi not
being able to talk directly with
these people, i was able to have
a lot oi inn with them, especially
the younger children,
‘Til Sankrat’
This night was the time oi never
bl‘allow of “all Snnkrat,” one of
the many family holidays or the
Hindus. Small sheets, called
“til.” were passed out by the members oi the family. The younger
members knelt down In front of
their orders and touched their heads
to the older person's feet, as they
said “God bold,” which means
“Speak greatly” or “Forget any
quarters we have had this past
years", At the same time the
younger person gives some sheets
to the person he is handling. The
elder person in return blessed the
younger one by wishing trim the
best for the coming year.
Played Hearts
After the sheets had been
passed out, we decided to play a
game of hearts with the playing
cards I had brought from the college. The two college boys, two
village farmers, and l participated in the game. We were not able
to hold a conversation with each
 
other. but we could emoy each
others company while playing a
simple game. All oi us had a good
time.

AIIEK the game was over, we
all settled down for a welconle‘

STANDARD
SERVICE
 
F
By Steve Casey
The Pioneer athletic scene has been struck by a
critical controversy over the listing of letters Do people deserve letters by merely participating or must
they meet some standards of performance? This is
something which can be easily overemphasized, but is
a guidance that must be cleared up Coach Terry Moore
of the wrestling team happened to be the center of the
dispute, but it really could have happened to any of
the coaches.
When Moore was the wrestling coach at Grinnell
for two years after he graduated, the letters were
awarded on the basis of points the wrestler scored He
had to win a certain number to get his letter However, this was not incredible: for instance, a senior who
had wrestled for three years with a good attitude
would probably still get a letter even if he was short
of his quote of points, but was straight-forwards
Moore then went to the Peace Corps and came
back after two years to resume his coaching at Grinnelll In the dealtime Coach powers had been the
wrestling coach and had started knew, systemnHe de:
cited to award letters to anyone who stayed with the
team and filled a weight class for the whole year.
When Moore came back he sustainable felt the
wrestling were still on the same point system that he
had always known at Grinnell. So when the letters
were issued he set the standard at a certain amount of
points and three of the members did not make it so
were not issued letters. After these boys, who were
used to powers‘ system, complaints, Terry talked with
Coach powers and found out what had been happening.
Although not entirely pleased by the powers' system, he did not want to make a big issue of it since
he will not be the coach next year. So he awarded the
three letters,
What will happen next year when there will be
another coach? Will it go back to Coach Moore’s system or remain as it is? De we want to have fewer but
more first-rate batteries or more that include people
not so good?
This is something the coaches must decide — and
tell the athletes about. With two new coaches coming
next year to Grinnell, it becomes even more important Let us hope We never see such misunderstanding
between the coach and players again.

Three Pioneer wrestling, Gary Wilson, Ken Stubler, and John charge, ran into some tough luck when

Although the Pioneers had paid their entry fees,
they could not greatly. Even when President suggest

made a mistake and the Pioneers were not trying to

it was too late to do anything,
