bible for the historic friendship, between us, once again to
find its reflection in normal,
relations oi every Sort. meanwhile, our sympathy goes out
to the people oi Cuba now
suffering under the joke oi
a director."
I for one, can not detect in
Mr, Eisenhower's statement a
“policy oi mortality toward Cuba," to the human people. On
Jan. 16, 1961, the Department
oi state announced “that in
view of the u, s. governments‘s'
liability. following the break in
diplomatic relations between the
United states and Cuba, to extend initial protective services
to americans visiting Cuba, Us,
citizens defining to go to

plate iii- such travel. . .excel—
tions to these regulations will
be granted to persons whose
travel may regarded as being in the best interests or the
United States, such as newsmen
or businessmen with previously
established business interests. . ,
“These actions have been.
taken in coniorinity with the
department’s normal practice
oi limiting travel to those
countries with which th e
United states does not maine
twin diplomatic relations."
Notice that during several
months preceding the instance
of what amounts to a “limited
travel ban," such as was Impose
ed on the travel or United
States citizens to Nazi Germany
when similar conditions had an
given there. U, S. citizens in
Cuba had been sentences to
heavy prison penalties by “Revolutionary Tribunals" without
having been granted an opportunity to center with the (line

be. But, it the humarcollntry
oi the alien can claim “denial
of justice" or “efficiency in
the administration or the judge
dial or remedies process," it
is entitled to submit the issue
to governmental negotiation.
In the human case, such dipr
romania settlement has become
nearly impossible, as the lions
disputes by arbitration or re
course to the world court (now
the International Court oi JllSv
time).
Consequently, the U S. got-1
element is controlled with the‘
choice oi warrllkc measures in

for one reason or another. have
been subject to “denial ot ju
