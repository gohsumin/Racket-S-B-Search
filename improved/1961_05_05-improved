Don’t push the panic button. In suite of reports that
more than thirty students have been let't without deals after
i'tlttm drawings, Dean Evelyn partner reports that plans
are being bizarre to house everyone.
in suite of the plans, however, there remains, it seems,
a l)2l.lC question which has not been {novel-ed Why are
lhcl‘e going to lie so many people here in the fi ‘t place”!
Apparently the college is either are knitting contrary
to their belief that a small classroom situations in 2i small
college atmosphere is conducted toithe bet liintl of learned or our image is all \t'long’.
A Student Senate committee is presently inre.
the situation. This paper looks postcard to the
and some necessary answer.

We might, therefore. picture

lncvitubly then, a Russian sure

merely to detonate present

survive a single thermonuclear

evident that World War all, if

is it even possible then to
believe that Russia would embark on n surprise attack,
knowing that every exhibits

What maria is it then that
drives us to producing more and
