Major remodeling of Main Hall basement is
now underway. The recovered space will be
used as a temporary social center during con»
selection of the new Grinnell College Forum.
Later, the space will serve as a bouquet and
party room.
The college hopes to begin construction
oi the Forum in early spring, according to
Grinncll Vice—president permits C. Ludwig,
necessitating resolution or the old Union
building. Occupancy of the new Forum is
planned for September of 1994.
Principal work in Main basement will involve the “Little theater” where the floor is to
be labeled, and adjacent rooms reconstructed to
provide rest rooms and a coat check room. The
entire basement, including the Private Dining
room, will be air—conditional. The east outside
stairway approach to the basement will also be
reconstructed. .
During construction, Ludwig said, there
will be inconvenience in reaching the Port,
but it will continue to be available for student and faculty use. The remodeling project is planned for completion about March
1 with the noisiest and distinct part at the
job being carried out during Christmas re.

estimated at $60,000 to 370,000.

as a general lounge area, and as a place for
dancing. The stage, though reduced in depth,

Arrangements for triple food services in the

cause of lack of space to prepare and serve
food, some items may have to be offered by
sending machines located in the institute now
leading to the Private Dining,Room.
THE PDn itself will function as the triple
seating area during hours when the Union is
open, but will also be available at meal hours
for private dining, according to present plans.
Hours of operation for the temporary union
