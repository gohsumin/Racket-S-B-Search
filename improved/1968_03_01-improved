on alternative forms) under a
student advisor system this
tall.
Last September President suggest expressed the hope that
“when school opens next fall
the physical arrangement for
student living will at least be
started toward the promise of
being basically different"
Ron Cogswell, C of HP Preslden't, sees suggest as being
“generally dissatisfied with the
present living situation."
The Student Affairs Committee (headed by the means of
the College and the treatments
of SGA. the soil-IF, and the
AWS Board) has been working
since September on problems in
the living situation at Grinneil
and possible solutions
on February 16, two weeks
ago, the Committee presented
suggest with an extensive list
of recommendations which he
will bring before the Executive
Council of the Board of Trustees
early in March.
It Is expected that the T1154
teen will take ﬁnfl action no
later than June.
PROPOSALS CITED
The recommendations included
"the integration of men’s and
women's Campuses, the initiative of an allocation room drawing, the expansion at off-campus living options for upperclassmen, the establishment of
a student advisory system, and
the confirmation of an extended
resident advisory system."
an integrated computer the
Committee proposed that North
campus have women living in
South counter, Smith, Langan,
Rawsou. sales, and men in
North counter, Cowles, liable,
Clark, and the morrison.
South campus will have women in James, Cleveland, Main,
years, and men in Loose, Reno,
and ﬂages
Changes for which the Committee recommended that new
funds be allocated include enclosure of the North campus
logged from south of Smith to
Gates, kitchenettes to be built
in the new women's balls on
North campus, and additional
lounge and recrroom furniture.
CO-ED LOUNGES
The Committee sees the common-use lounge between North
counties (boys) and South counter (girls) as an exciting twist
step towards “computational
calls at Grinnell."
The student advisor is to be
a paid worker who is response.
bee to his resident advisor and
who “should seek to work close<
ly with the da ~today functioning of the has His main responsibility is to help underclassmen in resulting to college
life and its problems
A committee of resident advisors, means, and student government officials is to select
advisors for next year.
A weekend retreat and I
week of intensive preparation
immediately preceding the fall
semester are seen as important
items for both student and resident advisors in developing
counseling skills.
These will be supplemental by
weekly sessions throughout the
school year.
STUDENT “ADVISORS”
A program incorporating in
student advisors is envisioned,
meaning there would be one student advisor for every 15 stud
cents on campus. Also recommended is the hiring of an additional re5event advisor and
an insert, or part-time, resident
advisor, which would bring the
total number of R,A.’s to 10.
Another recommendation of
the Committee is “an all-campus room drawing using a quote
system for filing the number
or freshmen, sophomores, seniors, and seniors in a given
hall.”

HISTORIANS THREATEN EUROPE 1
MOBILIZE PLASTIC ARMIES '
By SUE MILLER
& ADRIENNE LEMMONS
5&1! Staff Writers
Students in Professor Terry
Parssinen's European History
338 class were asked to take
over Western Europe last week.
The class was asked to play
it game called Diplomacy at
least twice. The object of the
game—stated in the instructions—is to “take over all of
Europe.”
Diplomacy consists of a map
board of Europe and plastic
markers which legally armies
and naples. The method of winning the game is warning con—
tool of territories and extending one’s own borders as far
as possible.
The player whose manifest
destiny is greater than his opponents is the winner, Parssinen explained briefly.
“By rational calculation of
expected benefits and expected
losses,” he said, "the game is
to some extent the way competition with countries actually
works.”
“To play Diplomacy as a
game, one is forced to give
serious arm-chair thought to the
underlying factors interesting
decision-makers in the game
and in real diplomacy," he continued.
After playing Diplomacy, students were required to read
Laforo’s The Long suse and to
write a paper comparing the
eisioomaking factors of the
board game and of those elm
updated in the book about the
origins of World War 1.
The game alone, Parssioen
arrested, is “of course only an
oversimpliﬁed version or real
diplomacy."
In playing the game, a student decided “not only the most
rational course to machine his
best interests, but must code
since the other players that it
is in meir best interest to act
in accordance with that course.
In Diplomacy n player can
match agreements with opponents prior to actually moving.
An element of reality is added
because there is nothing in the
game requiring agreeing parties to keep their respective
words.
“To make and break alexander
. . . this is where the presented diplomacy takes place,
not in the moving of the plastic
markers about the map," the
professor further explained.
The game board represents
about fifty geographical areas,
most of which compare seven
countries: England, France, in
lily> Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Turkey, and Russia. Plastic
markers represent armies, and
movies which can capture the
geographical areas.
Each geographical area can
potentially “supply” either one
army or one navy, and to re«
main in the game a player must
retain at least one supply point.
initially each country has a
number of armies or movies
depending on whether they are
a sea power or a land power
and on the number of native
supply points within the country.
During the first turn forces
strike out and attempt to cap
sure neutral supply points in
order to implement their forces.
During subsequent turns the
nations form conditions and a1:
chances in which each side
weight in balance the select of
such cooperative, measures in
the spirit of Von germany game
theory.
Parssinen Said he got the
idea to use the game from some
fellow graduate students at
Brandeis University a few years
ago. without1 some of them
now use this method as a teach
ing aid, the idea had not been
practices at that time.
“The rage was Bogcy movies
and Diplomacy games," Parssinen said of his grad school
days,
He added that the main idea
in having students play the
game was “to teach people to
understand things from the his
side out, not the outside in. , .
Books—l mean this in the best
Collingwoodinn sense of the
word—sometimes do not do this.‘
“Some games make you reading the situation in doing, not
in watching,” he showed. “This

have employed games as teach
ing aids. Professor John Woriey used “off ’n Proof," a logic
game originally at Yale Uni.
version, in his Symbolic login
classes last year.
Parssinen said he found women make very poor Diplomacy
players. “They can‘t detail
themselves (from the game)
personally.”

AFTERMATH OF A BUST
NEW YORK CITY, Feb. 28
(CPS)—Charges at non~copper—
union by university administrators and “Gestapo-like police
tactics" were tired here last
week as two New York legislative committees began investigation the use of drugs on campus.
The investigations grew out or
a Jan. 17 raid at the State University of New York at story
Brook in which 21 students were
arrested on various charges.
The Joint Legislative Committee on Crime heard buffalo
County Police Commissioner
.john Barry testing that school
officials at story Brook had not
been informed of the depending
raid because "they had refused
to corporate with the police in
the past.”
story Brook President John
Toll denied the charges of ham
cooperation and explained how
each example cited by police
was “in fact, an attempt to
work with police officials."
Especially at issue was an in.
client that took place in March
when the police received an
anonymous tip that a "put party" was taking place on the
campus.
President Toll testsﬁed that
the incident was an attempt to
frame an associate dean who
found a packet containing mail.
jeans placed under his door.
Commissioner Barry claimed
that the administration warned
students at the alleged party
that the raid was to take place.
relating Barry‘s testimony
point by point, Toll claimed that
“I know -I can never catch up
with the impression that was
given . . ." by claims against
the university.
The committee came under
criticism for hearing testimony
publicly without ﬁrss determining its validity in private.
Senator John H. Hughes,
chairman of the committee, admitted the crime committee had
permitted heresay evidence to
be tired.
The Joint Legislative Commit
tee on Crime was also accused
of “clear" tactics by a lawyer
representing twelve story Brook
faculty members, who have ﬁguard in a grand jury inquiry
into drug use by the story
Brook faculty, The lawyer ob
gained a court order to prevent
them from being surrounded by
the committee.
At another hearing, the Joint
Legislative Committee on Education heard criticisms of police
actions used in the story Brook
rates.
American Civil libraries Union
representative human german
said that police isolated a sec.
tion at the state legal code by
discussing secret investments
against students to the press before those students had been
taken into custody.
He also customized the police
for allowing the press to according them on the raid and to
take pictures of the artists on
the grounds that most ol the
Students qualified for youthful
offender status.
Assemblyman Joseph bottles
questioned Commissioner Barry
on the contents or a lM—page
photographer plan for the raid
entitled “Operation story
Brook.”
The plan contained personal
information on each of the gui)tests and was made available
to members of the press at a
brieﬁng before the pre-dawn
raid,
Barry explained that the document had only been calculated
to police ofﬁclass, but that one
copy had been carried away by
a reporter. An updated newspaper has since published ii
“book review" or the report.
bottles claimed that Time and
Newsweek magazines had also
been furnished copies of the
documents.
A force of 198 initiatives in
72 police cars participated in
the Jan, 17 raid, They arrived
on campus at 5 am, armed
with pass keys and warranty.

The history professor revealed
that he had frequently played
the game for six or seven hours
and “had never come to the
paint where a person does control most of Europe."
“It is the opening live or six
moves that are important (in
the learning process)," Parssinen theorized. It is in them
that one “extracts the principle
involved."
“You can‘t read it like a

is only valuable when you repeat on it with something else,
like a narrative history of real

One major failing that Pat'ssinen noted among students
in playing the game is a lack or

every year.
We had the opportunity to cover a pottery

under age (ALEXANDER PIX, see Page 3); a
quest-obituary for a former 5&3 copy auditor

I o w a weather, of
course, is always a disaster. And apparently it
is always determine of a
banner headlinerat least
as far as the State’s largest daily, The Des
points Register, is concerned.
On the national
scene: Campus copy in
Detroit keep files on all

“transexual currencies”
and “political de<

At the University of

It really was a fine week for black humor.
So you think you've got problems? Things have
been worse, if not just 5 bad. Jonathan south’s A
Book of Disaster (available in paperbacks for a dollar) goes you one better.
The book contains Vintage-1890 photos and
drawings reporting Some Pitiful People (for example, “A Poor, Sick Person Being Visited by His letters”); Some Miscellaneous ministers (eg, a series
of exchange including “Abyssinians Being Massacred," ”Massacred Abyssinians,” and “A General

“By comparison, ”south tells us in a prepare,
“the reader's own punk problems and personal expressions are guaranteed to made into total insignificance.”
Also featured are Some Mean Thoughts (cg,
“Concealirlg himself in the underground and clicking Bread sellers at Elderly gallery to the House")
All instances of disaster are instances worth reporting. All instances worth reporting are instances

TOM-TOM PANS POWER. RAPS REC
By SUE T. MILLER
(Editor‘s Note: Tom
Thomas, Gates Sophomore, won the SGA election Tuesday, Feb. 20,
with a til-vote margin.
Out of a total 839 votes
cast (79 per cent or the
electorate), Thomas got
53 per cent; his opponent, Dan Cheitetz, got
47 per bent of the total
role. In this interview
held a week after the
election, Thomas gives
some candle comments
on his aims for the coming year.)
Since the question at the role
of student power was frequent
1y mentioned in the SGA campaign, Thomas was asked how
much he text student power
would direct administration decisions like the new reception
center.
“Well, they (the students)
can go out and steal the centers number as they ship it in,”
he offered, or “like at NYU,
they can lie in front of the
bulldozers as the trees are
closed: but there’s not a
earned thing i can do about
it. The reception center was
fought by three student modern—
meets before me.”
“They (the administration)
are the ones that have the
mother — we can express our
opinion, I think they want us
to, but the students have no
power.”
However. Grinnell Students
and their government do have
the power to organize, Thomas
said, and this organization
should take place “before we
(himself, com? and AWS treatments, and the Committee oi
Thirteen) ever go home for
spring break.”
Thomas feels student government action Should center
around several key problems:
i) all-campus room—draw; 2)
student advisor system; 3) in—
operated computer; 4) no state
additions; 5) elimination oi
over-crossing on campus.
“I‘ve given the all-campus
point draw first priority,”
qillpped Thomas, “Since no finances are involved.”
As for his second priority,
Thomas expects the 70 new
student ndViSOi‘s to be “all the
things the ballleboard should
be, and is not.”
“This includes lots of minor
things," he added, "like just
lettltig people know when they’re
being conscious."
Thomas said he was “disappointed all [he manner the
administration (1 ho S e to integrate the computer" and that
he would [Ike [0 see the plan
changed.
“Their integration will Stretch
Gt'install's building budget lo
the limit. The blocking eniployctl was directed mainly by
finances,"
The new SGA President sees
his fourth pi'iutily problem a
the new RA 5 tom —— as a
“rachel miracle A! bull session."
“l'll give on example, Last
year my hall (sales) had a
Blast year, with everyone not
mg each other, everyone passed
over what each other had been
doing, So we got together one
night and told each other what
was il'relating; about us, things
we had never multi. Alter two
months of hate, the problem
was solved."
Thomas puts campus overcrowding last on his list or
priorities because “some would
rather moderate it and concentrate on other changes."
“Unfortunately," he said, “the
overcrowding, especially on
North Campus, is being ameliorated by simply changing the
funds to samples. Already, 51
student living quarters on North
Campus have been eliminated.
This is not an adequate solution to the problem"
Two other things Thomas
would like to accomplish this
spring are the ﬁrss steps toward a “free university system,” and "considerable expansion oi the Student Used
Book Store."
”The faculty here has a great
amount of talent that inn’t be
ing used now,” he added.
“It would he a nonrpressure
system—informal meetings in
residence hall younger, or available ARl-i classrooms.”
Asked about the status of the
present petition for credit (or
extracurricular activities, Thtk
mas said that it’s still Deﬁne
the faculty. The problem. he
said, is ”how to determine full
participation, For example, how
many times does one have to
sing in the choir to be a choir
member?"
Thomas concluded by reading'king his belief in the “individual approach” to government.
“We want to get SGA out of
the vacuum, unto the camping” Asked to define the vacu-
um, he gave his answer in
the form or a question: “how
often has pic MacDowell been
in your hall?”
“1 hope l‘m not disappointed,"
he added, “with the people who
turn out to run for the Comv
matter of Thirteen. beautifully
any student on campus has a
chance of getting elected. i hope
they don't leave it to the
political."
“The broader the base (01
student participation), the more
eligibility of proposals there
will be infected in student government.”

THE RIGHT
BY
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.
Twice in a single month, gentleman oi the Right have applied
pressure on me to modify my views — not so much on things in
general, but on things particular, namely themselves.
Pressure is the weather word for blackjack. most specifically
threatened by Mr. Robert welsh, the head of the John march Society, who friends because neither 1 nor any thoughtful conservative have found it possible to share his decisions. I wrote recently
about the John march Society, to comment on an analysis of it!
grammar administration as described in the Wall Street Journal,
and now Mr. beach has replied in tones most threatening.
“ . In all seriousness,” he writes in the current Bulletin of
the John march Society. “we now make to Mr. Buckley the legendary other by an anytime honest politician to one of his opponents:
‘You terrain from telling households about me, and I’ll continue
to terrain from telling the truth about you! which,” says Mr.
beach leeringly, “under the circumstances discussed by our burning tiles, about Buckley and some or lies associates, is a very gets
group other, indeed."
Mr. H. L. Hunt of Dallas is most easily identified as the highest man in the world. I had never before written about him, but
their a month ago the Saturday Evening Post asked me whether
I felt 1 could write an essay in defense of the rich, I accepted the
challenge, even stewart the massive presence of MI. Hunt, a man
7 as I put it — of “eccenlrlc understanding of public affairs, 0‘
yahoo timothy, and of accordingly bad banners.“
regarding on a one~loan campaign to prove my point, Mr.
Hunt began by writing are a married and rather catholic letter,
closing with the suggestion (hat I “make some agents,” and sing
getting that I might “Say something favorites about something I
have done or am doing if you can find anything.”
whereupon Mr. Hunt began to garbage newspaper editors with
treasures oi my own political infidelity, the suspicious company
I keep, and a defense of his own plastic.career, most of which, at
the moment, is tested in a radio program called Life Line.
The unguarded Mr. l'luut reforms the editors that "file Line is
not nominated by my rlglibwlng politics nor by any foundation I
own. Llle Line acts‘titles are conducted by Life Line Foundation,
its president, Board of Directors, Board of Advisors, writers,
speakers and other listed Freedom definitions."
Having established the total independence of Life Line, Mr.
input writes that “it could serve a good purpose it it becomes
known precisely where (Buckley) stands,” and appears a copy
oi the Internal Security Subcommittee’s Guide to subjective 0translations and Publications, earmarked to show “Frank s. keys
er.” an Editor or National Review > ”From 1938-1941 director of
the Chicago Workers School, which was under the direction of the
Communist Party” and “Will members” -— Associate of National
Review, “former Managing Editor cl Revolutionary Age, official
organ ol the Communist Party.”
Mr. Hunt does not mention that the Senate Internal Security
Suhcolnmlttec has published testimony and essays by Mr. Frank
Meyer. Or that l allowed to the work oi Dr. members as among the
classics or an:i»communist . . . probably because he dress’t
know.
Nor does he know the root-st oi it, which now, under the press
sure oi exposure by him and Mr. beach, l publicly contest, for the
first time.
I an! a russian agent. My real name is Buhkliski, and during
the months of July and August 1946 — nobody has ever asked me
where l was during July and August 1946, which shorts what is
happy . g to our internal security — the real william Buckley
J12, touring in rules, was affected; and I, who had been trains
ing at an espionage center in a Moscow auburn, began my long
impersonal: r l‘iii payniaster at Yale University was me Catholic chaplain.
What happened to the real bucklcy — he was an awfully nice
fellow 7 I don’t know, though the tumor ill the Party is that he is
back in [he States, rising the pseudonym David Flye. My order-s

As italic used to say, to me — \allan ﬂ wise old one he proved
to be — “you're doing line daily watch out for H. L. Hunt and
Robert \i/clchky. They're the only ones we haven't been able to
toolslty.”
How right he was.

John D. newly, assistant com<
mentioned of the Big Ten, has
been functioning athletes,
coaches, and businessmen involved to find out if Big Ten or
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules have been situated.

Two days later it was reported that Michigan State Uni-
.version athletes were getting
similar benefits.

M.S.U. to investigate the situation there after finishing his

oi one of the football coaches
and were given "grill passes"
[or use at campus stack bars.
It also reported that Duffy
Daughterty head football coach

he has not indicated whether or
not he intense to go ahead with
the suit.
Doughterty and other coaches

I' Today’s lesson is, “How I found Happiness by being conscious
during 1. M. Basketball" or “What to do when the other team is
switched.”
Take, for example, the case of Langsu and South playing the
rates “B” team. One cannon fully understand the illustration unless they have been corporate enough to see Gates play, but an
inalOgous situation would be to corporate Gates to the March of
times poster girl; any other team to Bob Hayes and then stage

are really good.“ 50 South scores 103 and Langan scores 10] and
a good time is had by all, right? Please person my residence but
I'm apparently not up-to-date with the new I. M. philosophy.
Give me a chance, though, I‘ve got a ping-long match scheduled with a double amputee.

G-MEN MMTEB F03 LAW OF DENH
By JEFF SCHECKTER
5&1; Pioneer Analyst
It is ﬁrally time to take a
look at the Grinnell Wrestling
team, now that only the Midwest
Conference Championships are
left in the season.
The wrestling feel, apparently,
that it is accessible for a Pioneer team to win more than
two contests in any season. Like
the football team and the basketball team, the wrestling team
has won only two meets and
now has a 2-12 dual meet record. As Coach deutsch recently
said, “Iowa’s ‘ Fe b ru are
weather is friend and Grinnell
College‘s sports have not been
much better.”
Most of the wrestling team‘s
problems stem not from poor
wrestling but from a lack of
depth. with only eight regular
variety wrestling, the squad is
forced to give up between fifteen and twenty points a
match.
Looking back to the beginning
of the semester, the travelers
lost to Knox 2642 on January
26. The Pioneers won four of
the six matches wrestled but
gave up 20 points in forfeits.
Winners for Grinnell were Mike
partition (123), Joel Richman
(130), Bob banking (145) and
Bill Wedding (167).
On February 5, the team took
on Cornell, the best team in
the conference, and lost 32-9.
partition won EH), banking 673
and Wedding 6~Z for the Grinnell points. The Pioneers also
lost on the following Saturday
to the same Cornell team in
a quad meet. Grinnell was
fourth behind Cornell, brake
and joe. Bob banking was the
only winner for Grinnell.
On February 14, Simpson and
brake arrived to battle the
Pioneers. Grlnnell lost to brake
2341 but beat Simpson 19-15.
banking, Richman and Wedding
had double wins (or the trim
well squad. Other winners for
the Pioneers were Mike partition with a win and u draw,
and Lou seller by perfect.
Three days later, Grinnell
lost to Western Illinois 298
and plymouth 21-14. In the
Western illinois match, michigan won $3, Wedding won by
perfect and three Pioneer wrestling were signed. plymouth
lost boots to partition 3—0,
banking 3-0, Shaw (draw), Wedding 4-3, and Swnrtwood 6‘1.

The Pioneers stand quite a
good chance in the Midwest

banking and Bill Wedding am
interested in conference come
petition and should have a very
good chance at taking the gold
metals. Don Kraitslk is defend-
ing champion at 157 pounds and
has a good chance to repeat
with a little luck. Joel Richman
and Mike partition are our
other hopefuls, but the 115 and
123 weight classes are very
tough this year.
