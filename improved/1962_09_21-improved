The President’s suggestions will not be received with
open arms by all. There are students who rely on a weekly
dosage of grades for security and there are faculty mere

Others will feel that the suggested changes would still
fail to ensure a completely free atmosphere for learning
7 an atmosphere free from all false sub-goals which any
system of evaluation is bound to foster to a certain extent.
However. I find Dr. women's sue strong an intelligent means of accomplishing one of the secondary but
nevertheless essential roles at a college ~— that of working out good Students from poor ~ while assuming the
opportunity of each student to gain a liberal education
with as much freedom from the “tyranny of number "

The only question I have to ask “when will the

’10 the Editor:
Now that we Grinncll students
are once again ﬁusing ourselves
ph» iiuy “settled," we must
qui :ly turn to the responsibili—
tl ~ which have been mounted
aside during these last several
days.
All of the organizations on
campus will Soon be activated
and once more serving the students of Grinnell. forecast a7
long these organizations is the
Student Government Association. I term tl‘it‘ SGA forecast
among siudcm organizations because of its ability to support
merit or alter most facets oi
campus liic To those oi you7
especially the lrcshmenrwho are
not familiar with the operations
of the son I would simply rec
mark that the budget of this
student government totals over
$45,000.
THIS FACT is especially relevant to the women of Grinnell
in that they die ip elect their
representatives to the Student
Senate this Coming Monday ever
king. It is parameter that these
representatives be extremely
perception and patient, and pos
5055 a sense 01' responsibility
which provides a basis for sci-la
ice The Speaker or the Senate,
kelly Parssinen, and the Execuuve Cabinet all look lol‘\\'zu'(l
to meeting the‘newly c’l ambien
Senate this coming week.
The work oi the BSA in general and the Student Senate in
particular will undoubtedly inc
slide at ﬁrss simple organizational measures. Senate committees must be re-established and
resumes: SGA appointments
must be made to certain faculty
committees. and. pi course, class
officers must be elected.
Once these problems have
been removed, the student go'
el‘event can turn its attention
to more weights matters The
idea of a student represents
time to the family, bringing to
them student opinion concerning
curriculum, is one which many
of us would like to see funﬁlled. ’
I feel that it will only take a
mature demonstration of Grinnell students' concern m such
matters and we will be given
this opportunity ot' curriculum
expression.
As the upperclassmcn will remember, last spring the Grinnell
Siudcni Senate decided to have
the Grinnell Student government Association remain in the
National Student Association. 11
was iclt that this organization
never ed for than one year to
make its {no cs meaningful to
Our campus.
THE NATIONAL Allan's Coinmittee. changed by NSA representative incl» sherman, really is meeting to determine
how best to assimilate the NSA
into our campus his. I have
hopes that a i-aimed- broad pro
gray, integrating the programs
or many private organizations,
can be developed for the geneﬁt
oi a single interest group,
A further project of prime
importance will be the Executive Cabinet's task of evaluating' the present budget of the
SGA. We must give time to
organizations now to demonstrate their need for SGA aid,
instead of mailing until the
celtic spring period when one
ﬁads barely enough time to
pass cvcn a budget which is
almost identical to that. or the
providing year. If major changes or re-emphasis are needed,
this winter is the lime to dis
cuts them.
