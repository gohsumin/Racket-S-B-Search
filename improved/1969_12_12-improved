be no leasing of business as usual

The Grinnell Moratorium
Committee, although reportedly
disappointed by student‘s recent
lack oi enthusiasm in planning
this month’s events, have
scheduled the sale of Christmas
cards both today and tomorrow
as the major activity on campus,
The cards, designed by the
Moratorium Committee, picture

. ’ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Continue!
Dear Michael.
Over four years ago, while l
was 8&3 editor, “shit" first hit
the pages of Grlniicll's student
newspaper,
Thcn the shit hit the fan.
A former Grinncll trustee,
Murray beach, apparently
threatened to cut off some money
to the college, and acting
president games Stauss quickly
arranged for the Board of
Publications to pass a rule that
“scatologlcal” language would
never again be used in the 5&B. I
was passed by the whole affair.
especially when every faculty
member on the Board tthe
faculty held a 5-4 advantages took
the line that I should have used a
better word 7 like “faces" or
even ”crap “ trading thus
personalized the Situation, they
aimed a collective kick in the ass
at the student press by passing
Stauss's suggested rule. Herb
Prescott, overseas of campus
journalism, had warned me
highway that Stauss could act like
a tiger when college funds were
endangered, But newbie didn‘t do
a damn thing to support the
student press: a reduction of
funds to the college would have
hurt him, too.
Now there are similar
problems — only the sensor has
changed. Actually, the college
seems to have forgotten its anti »
sociology rule long ago tperhaps
beach picked off?) — otherwise
nearly every one of the eight 5&3
editors since me would have been
posted. Strangely, all the
“illegal" sociology since 1965 has
been printed in Newton — by E.
K. Shaw and his Newton Daily
News. Now Shaw has decided
[hill [air 7 letter words can no
longer be printed at “his shop."
Slia e a good iicpuhlican. l'm
sure 7 is acting “he one of the
“silent majority" which ricky

visitors reaction against “the

Shaw probably believes, too,
that renew is right about the
“iinpati'iutlc press” 730 E, K is

outlet for their garbage [or as
long as it did. But his spirits
doubtless brighton when remembering that Grilinell’s garbage
has meant over $50,000 in
business during the last five
years. .
Shaw told you that holiday
you’ll understand why “that
word" is dirty. Similarly, after
my run-in over shit, Ruth
Prescott of the high . powered PR
department assured me that i
would be sorry about my large ol
good taste, I’m not sorry about
my so - called taste . large, but I
am sorry about Ruth Prescott.
Murray beach, James Stauss, the
faculty on the Board or

E. K Shaw, They're too secure.

CONTINUE TO
STOPTANTEOMS!
Dear Mr. Brandon:
i have just read your charles 5.
Black Special. There is little
reason in it.
First, Mr Shaw of the Newton
Daily News is a businessman, As
Such, it is his right to refuse to do
business with anyone. if he
choices to lose revenue by
reducing to publish the S 5: B. that
is his right. If he wishes to deny
access to his place of business. . .
his private property. . . to you r
anyone else, that too is his right.
PRlSON BREAK...
Show me any law to the contrary.
Do you have the right to refuse to
publish this letter in the S 5. B7.
You bet you do, and will
undoubtedly exercise it.
Second, Mr. Shaw, as a businessman, has a large investment
in equipment, labor and
properly, and he is subject to the
same marketing risk as any other Q
businessman, His likelihood and
that of his employees depends
upon his success as a vegetable
publisher II he upgrades his
business to the level of a shut
toddler, he takes the very real
risk of loss of good will (a
valuable commodity) in his
business community and a
possible loss oi other business.
Third, freedom of speech has *
nothing to do with Mr. Shaw’s
refused to print the s s; B, or Mr.
Pomerenk's refused to print the s
at E Special in the Service
Bureau. Both men left you
perfectly free to find another
printer There was no denial of
your right to print what you want
to, provided that you can find a
shut shop to do the work. I feel
that Mr. Shaw was wrong in
measuring your copy without your
knowledge, He should have
designated his contract to print
the S at B, and so informed you, in
the first instance.
Fourth, whole optimization you
and the ”dedicated" staff of the s
it B? optimization implies a
threat, and the only threat you
received was to be thrown out of
Mr. Shaw’s place of business. He
has every right to ask you to
leave his property and to elect
you possibly if you fail to comply,
just as you would have the right
to elect me from your office if I
came there and involved in a
pentium. .
Fifth, I would be truly
interested to know why you tool
the use of butter language is
“free" speech. it indicates,
rather, a search of vocabulary on
the part of the user and a
definitely low level ot intent
licence. Your “Stop The War"
editorial would have been much
more effective with a stronger
objective than the one which was
centered. The word you used,
a warm him top
“Which themes with fucking,”
projects a delicious and housing
either, which desktops the serious
impact of the thought behind the
words, That word, dear boy,
stocks no one who has achieved
the age lit reason. Weve heard it
before.
I also wonder why you feel you
must graphically detail the
satisfaction appearing in the
Peterodactyl. Those who have
the stomach for it can buy their
own copies: those whose
visiting threshhold is normal
have the right not to be
controlled with it in the college
newspaper. I wonder if you.
personally, are so affiliated with
this new - to - you awareness that
you don't realize it is beneath the
notice of anyone not suffering the
pants of poverty.
i believe it would be to the ad»
vintage of you and your
dedicated staff to learn the power
of the English language when it is
used in a craftsmanlike manner,
It would also believe you to
realize that people other than
college students also have rights.
and to stop having tantrums
when you get a no-no from a
responsible adult.

RlGHT on!
Dear Mike.
Right on, brother! Iowa
printers will try to mess over you
(look what happened to
Pierodactyl), but don’t give in!
And let no one mistake, either,
that the Iowa printer is the only
roadblock to the Grinnell
Student’s freedom of expression;
the college itself will mess over
you in a much greater way!
Both those American
specialists and “intellectualsH

instead) will try to use then'

Right now, a question everyone
should be asking is where was the
Grinnell College Board of
Publications 7 including those
great “free thinking” Charles
cleaner and newbie Prescott 5:
Co. — when your newspaper
faced membership, Did the Board
raise a single cry of protest when
E, K. Shaw refused to print the
ash with controversial words in]
it? No, of course not, because.
exactly as in the case of the '55
textbook, the Board of
Publications represented not the
interest of students’ free
expression but rather that of die
college’s status que image.
In the Spring of ’67. as editor of
the 5&3 at that time (then called
The Grinnell Reporter) I closed
publication in protest when the
textbook was banned. In doing
so, I suggested representation of
Grinnell's system of publications
in order that it be student
controlled rather than nominated
by the faculty ~ administration
block. Consideration of change
was completely ignored,
however, and, since that time,
the situation, as reported to me,
has even incorporated. In my day,
one at the worst forms of membership occurred simply by means of
selection of editors: Students
whose opinions seemed to
confirm to status que Grinnell
standards could be chosen over
those who questioned the establishment. But now, as i ‘
understand it. publishing the
position of editor is further
limited by a statement each
applicant must sign stating he or
she will comply with Board of
Publications definitions of good
taste. What to print, etc. in other
words, who becomes the editor of
the Student paper» the student
applicant or the Board?
Obviously the campaign for restructuring of Grinnell
publications must be represented, At this time I would
Suggest, briefly. 1, Investigation
of the formation of an
independent student corporation
which would be responsible for
all student publications Students
would thereby enjoy freedom of
:piece and the administration
:ould relax legally. Students‘
questions about legal and
inancial matters could be
powered by experts in these
needs, possibly from Des points.

We certainly expect that an

RESPONSlBleES!
Dear Mr. Brandon:
You have not been centered so
much as you have been reminder
of your responsibilities!
For instance, in your editorial
of November 21, you state that
Mr. Shaw could not answer, to
your satisfaction, “what is dirty
about “that word?” Your choice
of “that word” to describe a
terrible war puts the region»
mobility securely on you, as
editor, to answer that same
question. You are guilty of
following the many who have
been equation a commonly used
sex term with the mirrors and
dirt of war. Those of uS who are
now parents or college students
learned long ago to accept ”luck"
as a crude but honest enough
word, and have round it used
quite legitimately in literature
and life, It has been around as a
shock term forever, but now it's
being followed out at context
once again by those oi you who
consider themselves “sex »
encountered", for heaven's sake‘
You have been served fairly
and well by Grlnllell College in
being allowed to print the
explanation sheet. The college
need not and should not water to
you beyond this point.
Grinnell has its Pterodactyl
which is printed and distributed
with surprising regulation
despite its problems, The campus
does not need another outlet for
this kind of experimental
journalism. It needs, instead, a
newspaper to tackle the tar more
difficult job of seeking solutions
through a courageous approach
that eliminates the church of
stupidly offensive terms For
instance, alter reading the news
item about time Pterodactyl in the
so 13, we were ready to rush out
to buy it because it tantalized our
prurient interests. Your

If you are indeed interested in
what may be a very real threat oi
membership. look to the Open

Dear Mr. Brandon.
As a kindergarten teacher,

With the “naughty” words little

allow the use of such words under
the assumption that as a now

their language may become
slightly more refined, i find I
must question my methods. Can
you tell me, did your
kindergarten teacher south you
when you wanted to well “shit,
shit, shit,” (as a little boy did this
very day) 7 Did that depression
lead to this delayed concern you
have for such words? Or did she
allow you to do it, thus
establishing a cabin of juvenile

Michael —
i have been following the flight
of principal , based publications
with great interest the past new
months. Having known Mr, Shaw
for several years and having
always advised him as an easy
man with whom to work i was
surprised at his recent
attractions his-a-his the
vegetable 5ch I would imagine
but have no way at knowing that
there were treasures from other
directions on Mr, Shaw. ii you
would, try to be kind and patient
and try to understand Mr Shaw
He has had a goal or a set of goals
for which he has been working
hard iowa long time These goals
may be unarticulated or maybe
pro . conscious but they are very
real nonetheless. He has been
seeking taking other things of
course) a paid up mortgage,
respect train the pastor, friendly
node from the neighbors when he
meets them on the streets, that
all around warm, secure feeling
ot being part oi a pleasant iowa
village. These goals, which we
may not advice but with which
we really should not be too light,
may have been threatened by
printing pick and similar words -
You know his neighbors may
have started talking about him
and looking surely on the streets.
in worse yet not nothing at all.
Perhaps the pastor threatened to
breach a person about him at the
daily news. Worse yet, his
mortgage payments may have
been th catering when the larger
adverse era in town listed partly
that ads for their pure January
white sale could not be printed on
a press that had been beiouled by
fucking. Or perhaps. more kindly
and not impossible, Mr. Shaw
really does feel those words are
evil and dirty and as an act oi
principle he is giving up all the
money the son pays him to print
the paper rather than village use
principle he has about those and
similar words, So try to
understand iihe wants to keep his
press printing and animal Don’t
attack Mr. Shaw personally. He’s
really a fine guy, good to dogs
and children. You can’t expect
much more than that these days.
or course, I worlds‘t want my
daughter educated by him but
then I worlds‘t care if my son had
a beer with him.

To the 55:8:
I can sympathize with Mike
Brandon‘s exasperation in his
search for a printer who would
print the 85:13 without measuring
it. However, I am disturbed that,
in filing the blame for his
difficulties, he should conclude
that, “As far as freedom of the
press is concerned, America is a
gap." (8&8 Special, Decr5)
Freedom oi the press, as i
understand it, guarantees the
right of the individual to publish
whatever he wishes to publish, as
long as in doing so he does not
break any other laws Freedom
to publish presumably implies
freedom not to publish, also.
Mr, Brandon obviously
disorders with Mr Shaw and Mr.
Sutherland on matters of social
propriety. But the printers were
free not to publish Mr. Brandon’s
material, and Mr. Brandon was
free to take his business
elsewhere, as he did. Freedom oi
use press does not mean, and
certainly ought not to mean, that
a printer must enter into a
private business contract against
his wishes. Mr. Brandon may
think little of the printers'
reasons for reducing to print, but
nowhere in this personal conflict
is freedom oi the press at stake
in fact, it would seem that
everything freedom oi the press is
one professional principle which
Messrs. Brandon, Shaw, and
Sutlicrlandhave in common, The
fact that they all were free, under
law, to make public what they
thought appropriate for
publication, is testimony that, as
Mr as freedom oi the press s
concerned, America is not a gap,
Mr. Brandon’s inconvenience and
irrigation notwithstanding

To the Editor:
These words are promoted both
by Sally Moore's article on the
“newwoman” two weeks ago and
Robert Finley‘s reply last week.
I suspect it was Mrs. Moore’s
intention to excuse wider dishes»

“demands” of the generated
woman and, more important, its
documentation style is alien to
many of the issues its raises.
As a movement, women’s generation has widely adopted the
successful philosophy oi the
Black revolution. Just as self pride and racial consciousness
have become a monitoring force
for Black people. so military
women, considering themselves
as a group another of society’s
“fingers”, have set about to
change their image, both in their
own eyes and the eyes oi men.
The anatomy is not wholly inappropriate: Mr Finley's cartoon
stereotypes at women (including
the positive stereotype or woman
as building, happy homemaker,
“baking wholesale bread" 7
and screening wholesale
topless?) have infected the minds
of women as well, limiting their
perception at alternative like styles to right categories- One is
either a good mother or a career

l have greatly oversimplified
many complex problems, but
there is one final matter that
concerns me. Women are in
many cases their own worst
enemies. It is not easy to be a
career woman and a wife and
mother simultaneously. Time is
short and the emotional demands
are great. Most women, Wltll a
now degrees, quit their jobs when
they harry or have babies, and
employers are understandably
suspicious, particularly of young
women. Again, a woman looking
for part , time work, who is
concerned primarily with getting
out ot the house or earning a little
extra money, cannon expect an
according position or a
competitive salary.
The double pull is always there
A woman cannon deny her

women, but she must not deny
her emotional and intellectual
individuality. It is not a new
woman who is being born, but a
woman who understands herself

To the Editor:
While 1 e ‘eyed professor
master‘s pe -active and superior
written review oi “Midnight
Cowboy." I am sorry to have to
call attention to all error in
elementary logic committed by a
christopher This is the use or
two word as though they had the
same mailing; “liberal" and
”ruling class " The name of this
gallery is “notification”
professor master uses it to big
the question.
There are minerals in the ruling
class tKennedy, McCarthy,
Rockclellcl', Lindsayt; there are
minerals out of it (me). But there
are also people who are not
minerals in the ruling class
(simon, Thurmond, calendar,
polyester), and these people,
whom we call “conversations,"
slow and abstract the liberal
revolution because they do not
want it to happen.
Professor master speaks of the
diselilranchised, who are also the
Concern of the liberal, The goal
of thelibcral revolution since1932
has been to clllranchise the
disenlrallchtsed, but to do it
through permission, Because or

slow. but [hat it has also been
rcdl. substantial, and durable, I
call on any candle and important
observer to judge
[I l’rnlcssnr master has any
quarter with the minerals, it least
llc either in their arms or their
methods. One always has the
nutrition about the New Left that
its interests seek not so much to
remedy insurance as to couple the
mg order so that in the
resulting scramble they may
[arm a new one with themselves
at the top What do you want to
do [or the disenfranchised,
professor master?
Or, it Professor master does
not object to enfranchising the
disenlranchlsed. his objective
must lie in the liberal
methodology, which essentially is
that ot performing opponents and
the recommended to the necessity
of get'orin Perhaps we have
round the real objective here, for
Professor master writes “that
some species oi revolutionary
action Is the only solution to
their lthc disenfranchised's)
flight.” The language here is
much like that which powell
complaint about in “Politics and
and the English Language,”
are you talking about when you
say “revolutionary action,”
professor master? Do you mean
“shooting people,” or what? You
must remember that you are
talking about a revolution of
about twenty percent or the
population against about mighty,
and you must realize that any
solution which brings such forces
into Violent contamination must
needs leave the diselitranchised
tar worse out than they are now.
My own personal vision is or a
world in which all men are
brothers and each is tree to
achieve his own happiness in his
own way, so long only as he does
not re net the happiness oi
other . That is i believe a
liberal vision l invite you to join
