Those Who related home
from the “hall gathering” at
Lake Acre cabin Saturday have undoubtedly recovered by
now i even the had who received a covering experience
at the local Community hospital.
Damage to property and injury to bodies was nil,
though this fails to express those who believe Lady Luck
has a merchant for drinks and tools.
One result of such
Acre cabin and supported
activities
(those held at Lake
beforehand to be a pic—
pic, ski or skating party or whatever) is that all Grinnell-
fans are now held suspect in
their attempts to reserve the
building for truly “dry" functions. And, to go a bit further,
after such as Saturday’s display, one could hardly blame the
administration for reducing to allow students to use the
cabin at all without strict supervision,
But perhaps the real point of the whole thing is this:
Tile incident and every one like it is, unfortunately, a blow
to the argument of those who feel that our present drinking
regulations can, and should be modified.

by John Ward
Yes, Virginia, there is a col.
legs radio station. It's called
lKGRW and its religious tones
echo once again through the
wires of the heating winners,
bringing sound and jury to the
radio sets of a few fans.
The station was started back
in the years when sets were at—
sending Grinnell. They’ decided
that a college station would be
a good thing, so they built one.
Managers came, went on academic pm. The staff varied between 20 and 70 people, de‘
pending on the number of egoA
ists on the campus at the time.
The story goes that they even
ran a wire to the railroad
crossing and used the tracks as
an antenna so people could
listen to KG cm the golf course.
Unfortunately, one day a
little black panel truck value
down the road and out
stopped a man from the Federal Communications Cominissio‘n,
He said, “Congratulations, you
are coming in loud and clear
in northern Wisconsin." The station closed for three years. The
Personal journals of the time
differ on the details.
holidays, there seems to be
a problem with regard to a
listening audience. Some people
must know that there is a radio station since the Show scheme
His is well publicized. People
just don’t seem to bother about
listening.
This is sad. The staff at ‘KG
has been cut down to interested people, about 12 to 15 members. These are people who
know music and want to learn
good radio. From 7 to 10 pm.
daily, classical and light classical music is the main fare, This
is good music for studying pcrc
hope, with well-spaces come
century on the music and the
music men.
From 10 until midnight the
MUSHCAL
SUPPLlES
menu is a little more varied. It
ranges from jazz to folk music
to rock 'n’ roll, again interspersed with comments on the
music. It is indeed sad that the
listening audience is a minority,
but new habits have to be
learned and slowly the student
body is learning that KG does
exist.
The subject of the existence
of the radio station has
been related several times,
the most recent occasion being the san budget meeting
of last year. At that time the
station was off the air. The
question was raised whether
anyone actually cited whether or not the station was defence.
The answer, of course, is ob—
virus. It makes a big diﬁfrance
to the serious people trying to
learn something about the inner
warnings of radio, and it makes
a difference to the healthy minority who listen and enjoy
listening to KG.
The station was oﬁ the air
once this year. The problem
again was equipment failure.
The basic problem is that there
is no commercially made transmission equipment for the system we now use, All of KGRW’s
electronic gets must be hands
built by the students.
The only people available for
the building of such equipment
are physics motors, who as a
rule are more interested in
atom-selecting than wircAsoldcring, or else amateur radio for
notice who know as much about
continuous operation broadcast
equipment as i do.
The problem is not insoluable, however. i would recommend that the people in
charge (them must be some
people in thongs!) investigate
the possibility of the creation

To the Editor:
In this day of Organization
Men, we would like to get into
the act and propose the formation of a deﬁnative all-campus
organization.
We must acknowledge our
debt to those perception political
scientists, Gilbert and Sullivan,
who ﬁrss observed that “every
child born in this world alive—
is either a little liberal or a
little conservative." We suggest
that most of us are a little of
both and that we ﬁnd much in
man’s history to commerce and
much in man’s condition to literature,
Therefore, we propose the
formation of the Conservative»
‘liberal Club. (We decided on
this listing because: (1) it is
alphabetical, and (2) CL C
sounds better than LC 0 which
might be mistakes for some
sort of landing or searching
craft.)
The 07L 0 will have: no
meetings, no does, no sponsorship lists, no officers and
no meetings, The sole requirement for membership is that
the member decide to answer
lxll inquiries about his political affiliation or position with
the statement, “1 man conservativerlibcral."
Once the faculty and students
are all members and are, there-
‘more, self-labeled conservativeliberol, we can forever certain
economies of time and effort.
No one will have to waste
time trying to determine the
political completed of either
faculty or students. conservative parents will be recovered
by knowing the campus is 100
percent CONSERVATIVE-libera1, and liberal parents can be
happy that the campus is 100
percent conservative-LIBERAL.
People generally, who are con,
corner about the college, can
turn their attention to ﬁnew
points such as:

set-up for elections than do the
other countries of the Soviet
block. That is, there are more
candidates on the ballot than
positions to be filled, and the
votes has the privilege of crossing out those he does not favor.
Also, candidates represent 3 variety of parties, and persons without party affiliation can also run.
However, the candidates are
arranged on the ballet in order
of accessibility by the “United
Front,” a coalition of political
groups under the influence of
the party leaders. Voters are en—
compared to vote without conversations, qualifying they approve
the program of the ”United

I would like to see him lose

His name is sixth on the voting order, and the first seven
pro elected. still, it seems like
very serious business, and probably about 95 per cent of those
eligible will tnkc port in bring—
ing to power the new regime.
Why is it that such a high percentage of voters go to the polls,
if the results are all but predetermined? The main reason
seems to be the same which continues students to Volunteer for
work brigades. It goes on one’S
record and might cause loss of
certain privileges or even might
make it difficult to get a good
job.
With the unique system of rating, it is also evident whether
one votes without conversations,
which is most politicians desirable, or if one goes to the effort of concerning. Several students told me they voted without conversations just to keep
their record clean, applying that
other action might be noted on
their record. Such are the demo—

Amendment Causes
Debate In Senate
After many long and years
minutes of debate, the Senate
passed an amendment to Article
1, Section 02 of the Student
Government Association constitution Wednesday night.
The amendment, which is con—
corner with the election of
women senators. is as follows:
“The representatives or the
women's residence calls shall be
elected no later than the third
Monday- and no earlier than the
second Monday after the start
of classes in the fall. The exact
date of election shall be set by
the Executive Cabinet.” ,
After passage of an amendment by the Senate, it must
be rateﬁed by (in per cent of
the student body and then approved by the president of the
college and by the faculty before it can become part of the
connection.
The better debate which provided the amendments passage
was set off not so much by the
amendment itself as by the
question of just when and how
amendments shall be presenting
to the student body for rateﬁca<
tion. While suggestions were
made, no steps were taken at
this meeting.

by Tom grants
, The Pioneer fans who made the trip to joe last_ week
lwel‘e shown a perfect example of the actions of an immatlll'e college community. As the Grinnell workers lined up on
style field to welcome their team bitch onto the gridiron at the
islam‘l. of the second half, a large portion of the joe students
informed out of their seats, across the field and forced the
Pioneers back onto the track next to the stands, They then
needed and followed to brown out the cheers of the Pioneer
cheerleaders.
Let us hope that we at Grinnell will continue to treat
the opposite teams and their routing sections with the re—
‘spent that good sportsmanship demands.
