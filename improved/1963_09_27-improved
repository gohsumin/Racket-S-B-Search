The ambassador feels that a

Widely dubai /.ed through all the l‘l‘old‘
west news media, this is the type of while
dolls action that has an immediate and last,
ing’ effect on treat fabulous force turned
the “Grinnell image.”
However, is this the type of activity
that we would like to present as chargers
latin oi‘ the Grinnell student body?
Given the supposed above average in—
telligence acid majority ol‘ the Grinnell stud ’
sent, do we want the “public to see and
come in contact with this pa similar small
group of students and ti such them color
to belize treat here is a true representation ,
ol‘ the ivllole college”?
Our answer a responding YES! ’l‘li'
is exactly the l lid of responsible action,
intelligent organ tion, and active concern
for the rights at small that we would like
to see become automatically asset aged with
Grinnell and its student body whenever
they receive public mention,
We applied the Grinnellians who w 'e
active participants ill this defense action
of sympathy and respect for human beings
and their rights and hope that the p: 'popular faces of the “Grinnell Image” which
they have helped to develop will continue
to grow and actually become the core of
Grinnell College and all it represents
D. A. B.
Problems 01‘ Jrhe 'ln Loco Parern’rs' Theory
Oberlin, Carleton, and Grinnell. These
v'are three ol the schools whose students
took deep, pricing locks last year at their
respective college rules.
At Carleton the students related open
rooms, women’s hours, chapel requirements,
and minute of the student press. At Ober-
'l the emphasis was on open forms. At
Grinnell women's you open forms, the
school ip represent rule, the car rule.
'sexual misconduct, alld the liquid rule were
all related.
While the iii'similar rules discussed at
these schools varied, the underlying theme
was a delivering student challenge of the
age old college operating- theory of “in logo
parental."
Is the college responsible for the shipments in the absence oi" the parents? It' so,
to what degree are they responsible? These
Questions are difficult til answer. While
we'd like to jump in and say, “01" course
‘time college shouldn't be responsible for the
actions of each student,” we can’t. We
realize all too well that pressure has been
elected upon President women to take the
parental responsibilitle. il‘or many students
i.t Grinnelliespecially in the case of parents who send their children to Grinnell
with the understanding. that this institution
will provide a home-like atmosphere and
discipline '
However, there are others. There are
the parents who say, “You’re on your own
now, my boy (or daughters” And then
these parents send their children off to
Grinnell wllere they are far from on their
own.
Thus the school of thought which prev
scripts to “in logo parental” is incompatible
with the “student independence" school.
Statingr the problem is easier than still-J
ing‘ the resolution. Some of the most vocal
groups on the Grinnell campus believe that
their individual freedoms are being denied
by the present rules, while on the other
hand the most vocal group of parents and
alumni recall to think Grinnell is turning
into some kind of haven for seattle
removal winners.
This “hole discussion of‘ the incompatibil y of the two schools of thought, ill logo
talented as opposed to complete student in
dependence, has based a threat to the whole
theory of a residence college. Currently,
Grinnell has students from more than half)
the states and several foreign counties.
If campus discussions are any indication,
these students have failed to .well illto a
homogeneous society in which the student
from the normally liberal home lives happens
along‘ side his more conservative neighbor.
We feel that if Grinnell is going to attack the spirit of the college community
which archives to, it is 'king to have to
continue its baskets that immorality dress't
start with a couple alone in a student’s
tools, and that it will have to make more
of a provision [or individual freedom.
