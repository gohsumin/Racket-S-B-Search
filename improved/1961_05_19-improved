“Group at Grinnell" '
A recent story in the Des points Register discussing the Fair Play for Cuba committee, under the subject ”Group at Grinnell,” revealed that the Grinnell Silldent Council was on the Fair Play For Cuba Committee’s
mailing list.
What the story did not go on to clairify is that there
never has been, nor is tllere presently, a Grinnell chapter
of the Fair Play for Cuba committee.
We are getting sick of trying to continue the world
that though Grinnell students were interested in all sides
of the human question, the position of the committee

was one with which even sympathetic Grinnellians couldl
not completely agree. '
The sub-head “Group at Grinnell” is either so religious as to be displaying or an out and out misrepresentation of fact. How many times must we clarity our
position?
The Davis-McManus seller
Just before the American Revolution several “faithless” colonial respondents, disagreeing with English foreign
policy, wrote the Declaration of Independence It was not
much later that groups of cordless, unshaven, hairy men
fought for such things as Hunt Davis’s and Craig McManlls’s light to write letters such as the one which appeared in this week’s Des points Register.
They watched at long-failed Einstein, and Stevenson
was called an egg-head because he coupon’t find time to
have his shoes required. vessels Davis and McManus's
letter is certainly not unprecedented in the good one’ safe
consortium tradition.
As much as we may recent one group’s attempting
to represent themselves as all of Grinnnell College, we
likewise deeply recent the Davis—McManus use of “all
Grinnell" figures that are as unverifiable as their implied definition of ”beat."
Before the gentleman from Smith go on another
letter»writing bingo we would suggest that they remember that they represent a school supporting the so—college
liberal picture. In this light, the sort of narrow-linked
news which their letter reflected is p publicity of a far more,
fundamental sort than anything which has come out of that
group of “belittlers of foreign policy."
To the editor:

administrations. Stevenson, Rusk
