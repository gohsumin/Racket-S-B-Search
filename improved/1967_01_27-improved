$2 Million Physical Education Complex
By Jean Vandervoort
negative plans for a two mil.

complex were submitted Wednesday to the Higher Education
Facilities Commission of the
state of Iowa.
The physical education complex has been granted priority
over other needed facilities such
as classroom innovation.
The building itself will
cost about $1,600,000; equipment, architect less, land-
' costs, etc., make up the
big expense. The plans
anticipate two large buildings,
one to house a swimming pool
and the other a symposium.
The two will be connected by
smaller buildings which will be
used as classrooms, offices, and

Plans for physical education
facilities have been on the college’s building agenda since
1961. President suggest says
that the building at the library,

pushed aside the construction of
new “RE.” facilities. Dr. Leg<
gets said he is continuing with
building according to the 1961
priority list.
The present swimming pool

One View is that other needs

But the college is more likely to
receive federal funds for the
”p.e." complex than for class.
room innovation, President suggest contents, because Grinnell
compared favorites with other
schools as far as classroom
space per student while its
“p. " facilities are worse than
those of other schools.
The physical education build—
inns will be adequate for a student body three times as large
as the present one, according
to deutsch. President suggest
says Grinnell does not anticapate
a radical enrollment increase in
the near future. The question
had been raised as to the necessity of such a large and mostly
sports building lot a college the
size of Grinnell.
Several similar proposals
were considered by the architects. One involved an addition
to party, but this presented
several problems. Building expenses would be higher due to
:l water table at this site. Furthermore, this area seems to be
the covered location for central
dining facilities, A “p.e." complex here would crowd out dining facilities,
The proposed plan seems to
be more ecological than many
other alternatives. Mr. zambia,
business manager at the college, says that the complex
should be adequate low‘ the like

greater part of the “pa.” program must take place inside.
Now, intercollegiate sports he
entities must take preference

groups.
The course offerings of the
"p.e.” department are limited
because there are only four possible teaching stations on campus. The new buildings will allow the department to other a
greater selection of classes, and

The Faculty Committee on
Student Alialrs will offer its
recommendation on the women’s
hours proposal this Monday,
January 30. The proposal calls
for the elimination of hours for
all women except first semester

The Senate approved the proposal last November 16. The
Faculty Committee was unable
to make the recommendation
within the 30 day limit because
of its involvement in the suspension case of last December.

Qualifications of New advisors
By Paul mailman
“We hope they will supplement hall programs without
usnrping responsibilities from
established student government
structures,” noted AWS Board
President Karen Lauterbach about new resident advisors for
South Campus.
The resident advisor program,
stated to replace the existing
structure, was a topic of discussion at the AWS Board’s Tuesday meeting with Dean oi for
men Alice Low. Miss Lauterbach
indicated that few concrete
activities guidelines have been
set (or the advisors.
Dean Low and Miss Lauterbach agree that the new advisors would best suit the Grinnell environment it they are
dramatically oriented. To this
end, the college is searching

with masters’ degrees.
Dean Low described the role
oi the residents as twofold in
the non-academic sphere: counseling on a personal level and
advisors for social activities.
They will ease the load on the
individual hall treatments by
taking over many minor administrative duties. Dean Low
added that current responsibilities shortly decrease the treatments' study time, and they are
not qualified as counseling.
depending rules changes will
make the switch to resident
advisors more meaningful.

Sex Education —
As Bob never of Iowa’s Planned Parenthood Association said
ring the best attended Interim coffee hour, “Sex is here to stay,"
file this pronouncement is hardly a revelation, it is an un-
duestionabls fact which is too often ignored. An upcoming Sex Ed-
“nation Seminar, planned by Grinnell’s Sex Education Committee,
plans to deal with the subject of sex on a laudably realistic basis
The seminar will include lectures by University of Iowa postal gynecologist Kerschmar and Iowa sociologist fri L. swiss,
other of “Premarital Sex Standards in America." (melissa Ward
reviews his book in this issue.) Kerschmar, experienced in dishes-
ing the psychological aspects of sex‘ will include slides, basic innovation and the medical philosophy of sex in his talk while
iteiss plans to deal with the psychosocial aspects of sex education.
Besides the two professional lectures, the seminar will offer a
Grinneli faculty panel on ethical factors of sexuality, Optional discussion groups based on the lectures will be open to student parties
pants and will be led by student volunteers.
The Sex Education Committee, according to AWS Board president Karen Lauterbach, “hopes to involve faculty members and
students in the seminar’s informal coffee hours and discussion
groups,” and is presently seeking participants for the faculty
panel and student discussion group leaders
If Grinnell Students display substantial support of the seminar,
there is a good chance it will be institutes as an annual event~ as
the committee hopes. A yearly sex seminar offering the latest ins
formation on all aspects of sexuality, like a similar extent Oberlin
seminar for freshmen, would be a valuable addition to the Grinnell education.
An achievement of which the Sex Education Committee and its
motivation force, Karen Lauterbach, can he mostly proud, the depending seminar proven that committees can accomplish ends.
t-mapping, there exists at Grinnell a liable mode of community re
spouse to student stimulus. Students have made obvious their interest in a sex education program by overview attendance at Mr.
prospect’s liability catalogue and the Interim coffee hour on premarital sex. Coming at a time both important and 'initial with
respect to the probably elimination of women's hours, the seminar's
pragamatic emphasis will be a welcome, much needed change from
previous discussions exclusively moral approach —5. G.
Student Initiative —
The student Theater Board and the Grinnell Players are to be
commented for the active interest they have shown in extending
their own education in drama and related fields. They set up a
"Theatre Interim Seminar” in which several plays that the participants had read were discussed. This semester the Board plans to
ave a series of “informal seminar type talks" led by faculty
members; those taking part include processors message, Nelson,
Foster, Farslow, cleaner, prospect and others.
The Board, which for a while published its own diego newspaper, also has a program of movie discussing; recently 23 students saW “Morgan” at the Strand Theater and then held a “coffee
hour” to talk about it. will W.
Credit Due —
Last week we commented students for their efforts in producing a successful Interim but further credit must go where
credit is due. Although students met with residence on the part of
some members of the administration, we have been informed that
this skepticism was not universal.
President Glenn suggest and Dean James Stauss helped make
Interim a reality by providing financial backing. They found
sufficient funds to keep the campus open for those extra days, to
pay said and monitor salaries and to commission SAGA.
Dru Joseph Wall, Chairman of the Faculty, is also to be
changed for adding the students and helping to obtain support from
“the faculty and administration. —K N.

Book Review
A Sociological Look at Sex
By melissa Ward
“Premarital Sexual Standards in America”
by Ira L, swiss, a sociologist at SUI, is a sociological investigation of the relative social and jul»
rural integration of American standards. This
book, unlike many books being written on sex
today, deals with sexual standards rather than
behavior. swiss feels that by studying standards
“one can see more fully the role of society and
culture in sexual behavior.” In this review X will
at pt to monkey the contents, rather than
or ze the methods and theories.
The book can be broken down into three
main sections, the first of which deals with
the sexual nature of man and America‘s sexual heritage. cells “established man‘s roots
in the animal kingdom" hy illustration phase
political similarities of men and animals and
by giving examples of parallel mating habits
and characteristics. For instance, we find the
male-nominated family system among sen
merchants and the female both is a recognizahle roulette.
Beyond these supervision similarities to our
customs, there is a major difference, that being
the concept of learned behavior, Although there
are biological and inherited aspects found
in all of man’s behavior, there is a
great deal of Variance to be found in different societies concerning sexual standards for
men and women and social customs of courtship.
“in determining specific characteristics learning
is the dominant factor, and the inherited aspect
only a minor limitation.”
swiss goes on to give examples of cultures
which do not. consider the male the aggressive
sex. For instance, “at a ceremonial dance the
Goajiro woman (on Bali) is permitted to trip a
man; and if she proceeds he is dutyrbound to
have interactive with her.” swiss also shows
us that our standards of sexual beauty are far
from universal. What appeals to men in one society does not appeal to men in other societies ——
this is learned behaviour Likewise there is no
universal standard concerning premarital and
extramarital interactive ur homosexuality. In
light of this "learned behavior” theory, the conflict between “body and soul” can be displayed
with and be better stated and understood in
terms of a conflict between “a learned desirable
way of squirting man’s partly psychological and
partly framed sexual desired, on the one hand,
and his learned ideas about right and wrong, on
the other hand”
Following this introductory explanation, swiss
discusses America’s sexual heritage; from what
cultures our present-day standards have come
and developed, For instance, the provincial
double Standard is to be found in the divorce
laws and sexual mobility oi the ancient reviews.
“Although assistance was the formal standard
(both men and women were forbidden premarital or extramarital corpus), informally the wait-
ten investments and social century was much
greater for the female than for the male.
In Greek civilization women who were
married stayed in the home and extramarital
sex was strictly forbidden However, men
were expected to have an extramarital sex
life. Demosthenes is quoted by swiss. “Man
has the Hetaerae for erotic enjoyments, concuhines for daily use and wives of equal rank Io bring up children and to be faithful housewives.” Homosexuality was also acceptable
for Greek men. Roman women had I few
more rights. They were allowed to appear in
public with their husbands. "The womens
organized their mothers and women in general. To ensure liability, the womens taught
their women from birth to think If quantity
as the highest good."
Apparently the early Christians had a very low
regard for sexual relations and marriage based
on their belief in the Second Coming of Christ.
“The early Christians felt that marriage was a
second rate choice, but if one locked self-control, he had to take a choice. 'It is better to
harry than burn'." The status of women bit the
lower deaths under Christianity — woman were
the source of sin. However, “the woman who was
not a temporary could perform a responsible rule
in Christian societyr She was given the alternative of marriage or a nursery." Women gained
a kind of equality in that abstinence was the formal standard for both sites. ”The Christian influence has given our culture an element of
built associated with all sexual behavior outside
marriage. We still have this attribute to a considerable degree at the present,”
The birth of Romantic Love in the 11th
century plays a large role in our sexual
standards today. “Out of the Christian de' 'edition of sex rose the romantic idealizatmn
of it. To the knights and troubadour, his
lady was an angel, in collection of perception." In those days love and marriage did
not go hand in hand and for awhile it was
thought that to consultant love with sexual
interactive Was to destroy it. This tradition
underwear many changes and finally the love
object became a single girl rather total a
married lady of the court, love and marriage
were needed, and parental right to choose a
mate was seriously challenged.
The final influence that swiss sites is that of
the feminist report which came along with the
industrial revolution. After 1848, women began
to go to college, earn their own living, and became order sexually, all of which began to heaven the traditional standard considerable. With
the industrial revolution the tight-knit family of
an agrarian society began to disappear and
cities provided a place for different ideas and
anonymous. In the twentieth century We have
had more rapid change than ever before. In next
week’s article i will talk of swiss’ analysis of
today‘s sexual standards and of the behavior and
consequences that are a result of the complex
and contracting standards of modern America,

The basic promise on which
our recommendation is based
is that a resident University
such as Stanford should try
to provide optimum living con.
options for those of its students
who choose or are required to
live on campus. form residents,
especially those required to
live in forms, should have free.
dom to choose, individually and
collectibles, how housing facilities will be used. We do not, of
course, mean to suggest that
each student can or should be
given absolute freedom to de
service how he or she will live
in a University residence. Some
regulations are obviously never

ought to have an informative
certification besides the fact
that it is traditional. Further,
limitations on use should be determined by form residents
rather than hv University route

in our view, the underlying
matter of principle involved in
the open house issue has already been do a by the University. Visitor of the opposite
sex are now permitted to be in
tale rooms of Stanford students
for substantial periods of‘time
each week. Consequently we
have not related the accent»
ability of open house as a matter ot principle, but instead
have consolidated on two automatic questions:
1, Should the number of
permissions open house
hours each week be expand.
ed if the students so desire?
2. Who should decide if
and to what extent open
house hours should be eitpandedi
Our answer is that, subject
to certain limitations discussed
below, open house hours should
be those Which are agreed upon by the students in each rest-
dance, except for freshmen
G
references during the autumn
quarter, to set their own open
house hours. provided that an
open house would not be per
fitted to last beyond 2:30 am.
or begin before 10:00 am.
We do not believe, on the
basis of the evidence that has
been presented to us, that most
references will in fact set open
house hours at or even near
the maximum which our imposed regulations would permit.
We propose a “basic" open
house regulation, to prepaid in
the absence of informative ace
tions by the students concerned.
The “basic” regulation would
permit open house tour days
a week from noon to midnight.
in reaching our conclusions,
we have carefully considered
the argument that open houses
inconvenience a o m a students. We realize that wlnlc
there is widespread student
support for expanded open
house hours, there may be some
students who will feel that the
privacy and information of their
residence will be impaired by a
more liberal open house policy,
The problem of financing these
competing interests is a indicate
and difficult one, but it seems
clear to us that they must be
balanced rather than he resolved wholly one way or the
other.
We have concluded that the
most practical and educational.
ly desirable way to strike the
necessary accommodation is for
the students in each residence
to balance the various connect
ing interests themselves, provided only that minority Itercsts are accurately for ’derek
and protected. With reference
to roommates, this is mostly one
of many questions which they
input resolve in actually acceptable ways.
We realize that not everyone
agrees that inconvenience and
privacy are the only relevant

considerations in determining
open house limitations, For
some it central concern to
whether a more liberal open
house policy will encourage virtual relationships among std
cents. We think this false issue
is exaggerated. students deny
ﬂint they seek more liberal
open house hours for such our
posts, and comment that a university residence is not an ideal
or even a likely place for sexual
relationships.
in representing modified
open house regulations, we expect that living conditions for
those students who choose or
are required to live on campus
will be improved. We make
this recommendation in the explanation that Stanford students will comply with the prozac-ray requirements recommended, will respect the rights,
preferences and possibilities of
all students involved, and will
observe and support the enforcement of the limitations on
open house hours which would
be established by or under—
the proposed regulations,
Should our proposal be adopted
and these expectations not be
realized, the matter of open
house policy should than, in
our opinion, be immediately reconsidered.
