On the basis of an extensive report submitted by
the SGA committee appointed to examine the autumn«
file rule section of the Council on Student Life’s 1963
report, the Student Senate, Wednesday night passed a
motor vehicle regulation which includes two key provisions: (a) “Students of Junior and Senior class status
are permitted to maintain and operate motor vehicles”
and (b) ”Students of sophomore, junior and senior
class status may drive cars maintained and operated by
other students for social purposes with the permission
of the owner.”
The ,SGA committee’s five page report included
detailed objectives to all five of the principal reasons
that were cited by the Faculty Council on Student
Life “to justify confirmation of the present rule, (Only
students who are members of the senior class are permitted to maintain and operate motor vehicles while in
attendance at Grinnell College).” -
The committee report also listed a number of
"positive advantages” that they felt would according
the discrimination of the automobile rule. Some of these
advantages are:
1. The presence of more automobiles on cam- -
put would help minimize the disadvantages of
Grinnell’s cultural isolation.
2. An automobile would establish at least one
means for a student to obtain privacy.
3. More automobiles would facilitate and
make more ecological transportation to Houseparties and other events involving the moving of
large numbers of students.
4. More automobiles at Grinnell would result
in significant decrease in the cost of transportation
to and from Grinnell for many students.
In support of the Motor Vehicle regulation as
passed by the Student Senate, we would like to make
a few additions to the SGA committee's list of “positive
Advantages” accruing to the change.
1. With the continued shift in college academic
policy toward more academic freedom for the student
through increased opportunities for independent study
in his or her major field, the greater availability of an»
sometimes would broader considerable the possible
scope of any such study. It should make readily acceptable the extensive library facilities of nearby universities (SUI, Iowa State, brake) and provide an opportunity for Grinnell students to attend lectures at these
and othervnearby schools, Other academic benefits of
a specialized car rule would include increased opportunities for personal interviews with prominent people
in the area and direct observation of educational events
by interested students
2. Due primarily to Iowa climate conditions during
the months of December through the middle of April,
student travel, even within the combines of the campus,
is securely restricted. Students tend to become semihermits, featuring out of their directory rooms, for
the most part, only when it is absolutely necessary.
The greater availability of cars throughout the winter
months would allow for greater student movement
and a healthier campus atmosphere.
We applied the work of Cal soldier’s SGA com—
little for the fine job done on its report, as well as the
Student Senate for its speeds passage of the new
Motor Vehicle regulation. We hope to be able, in the
near future, to add our autos to the popular acclaim
that would great passage of this new regulation by the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, the President.

Radicals Blur Political Picture
Extremists seem to dominant American
politics today. They have not captured all
of the votes and offices as yet, but extras—
ist groups make so much noise with their
streaming that it is sometimes difficult to
hear anything else at all. The Bircllers export half the government as “communist
rules and sympathizers", While the far left
attributes all the World’s evil to Wall Street.
The right demands a withdrawal from
“dangerous internationalism" While the left
concerns the waste and insurance of a free
enterprise economy. The Americans for
Democratic Action and the Americans for
Constitutional Action trade results. The
National Review and the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee call each other ”minister
conspiracies."
It is completing to View these radical
groups as the creations of small minds.
They are discussed as fairly innocent
groups with simplified answers, catering to the unexpected All that is needed
is a little education, and then the radi<
cal cannon stand.
Ii we accept this promise, it should follow
that a student at an institution of higher
learning should be fairly interviews to the
attraction of their next answers and com
privacy theories. automatically he has more
knowledge than the average man, and has
more tools of analysis at his disposal. And
of course, he can always ask the opinion
of has faculty, who are even higher on the
scale of entertainment and consciousness.
He should be safe.
The unpleasant fact, however, is that
radical student groups of all kinds are
rapidly spreading across the country.
There have always been student groups
with extreme political views, but never before have they managed to grow so large,
so well organized. and so well finances.
The in left is represented by many
groups. The Students For a Democratic Society, which started in June 01 1962, is pro<
clarity an Eastern group, but is rapidly
spreading across the Country The Campus
Americans For Democratic Action is much
further to the left than its parent organize»
lion, the ADA. The Young Socialist Alliance has a number of growing chapters
across the country. New York City has ”.5
own local group, Advance, which has now
been infected under the Smith Act as a
CDmmlmlSerl‘int organization.
The right wing has only one major student organization, the Young Americans
for Freedom, but it is the largest and besttlnanced of all of the racial groups, The
YAF was set up In 1960 on the private estate of William Buckley, of National Review name. It now has more than 20,000
members across the country, as well as a
state of full-time officers. seniors and sen<
loss here will remember button Lewis III,
the YAF representative who Came to GX‘m‘
hell in 1962 to depend the House UnaAmerh
can ActiVllles Committee and the film “operation evolution".
Even more discussing is the extent to
which extremely groups have been able to
capture the national conventions ot/ the
Young Republicans and Young Democrats.
Last June's YR convention in San Francisco came out with an unbelievable platform, closely parallellng the views of the
John march Society. in September in San
Diego. the Young Democrats set ionh an
ultra~liberal platform which led several
prominent Democratic leaders, including
Governor Brown, to publicly immediate the
whole affair.
There is probably a higher percentage
of students in extremely organizations toe
day than from any other age or occupational group. The question of why is largely unanswered (and largely enabled). My
own hypothesis is the following:
3. Students DO have more political
information than the man on the street,
theoretical and rather supervision.
but this information is in most cases
There is lime real political insight on
today’s campus.
11. There is a certain excitement in
challenging accepted values and ways
of doing things.
1:. There is no real responsibility for
which most student groups are held accountable, ,such as running a government. These groups are not unlike processors in this regard.
d, There is real disillusionment‘with
the present system which allows discrimination, poverty, and violence on
the scale u-lat they exist. in this country.
These students want in change the system, and find the constitution of a new
system easier than modeling through
the complexities of the one that actually
exists.

Grinnell's Social Problem
Problem solved: The cause of “the
Gl‘innell SDClal problem" is individuality.
individuality is generally expressed in two
ways at Grinneli. Most students (60 per
cent) are passive individualists while a
healthy minority (35 per cent)'al:e active
individualists, ”PaSSlve" and “active”
will be defined after considering the
treasures that lead the student to choose
between them.
Grinnell’s social and philosophical post<
tion makes individualism almost inescapable. There are no permanent social
societies, athletic isolated numbers, and
honor societies have small instruments.
The stutlent body has neither a common
ethnic, religious, intellectual, economic,
or social basis. Further, our stay is limited,
thereby indicating tradition.
Since the college offers no answers except every possible answer in that omnivorous conglomeration ot interdisciplinary
cross»qualilaction, since teachers think

somehow beginning that by surprised g
their own feelings they will cause the std<
cents to develop theory, since “Well, there’s
something to that, but then on the other
hand" never ends, our students are forced
to become indiVldualists.
Now, active individualism, in healthy per-
creative, is fine. However, most Grinnell
students become passive individualists,
which is not so fine. it happens this way;

A counter to passive individualism is active individualism. While the passive individualist seeks to protect the self, active
individualisis express the sell. This expression is social. The active individualist realized that his own position gains strength
in the convergence of like minds. So then,
many Griiineli students not making the path
ot military publicity will actively stake and
depend their beliefs. The danger of active
individualism is that some may express
themselves only because they reject the
confusion of their present situation. They
substitute cogency for doubt, preparing to
find some meaning (any meaning) rather
than wonder in a vacuum. To find meaning
they may overcompensate, following their
views, excluding alternatives.
Grinnell students. if they are to societies
must have common grounds on which
to meet. withdrawal or a narrow participation does not encourage social inter—

others, must try to field each other. There

Board of Publications Decision
Creates Demand for Reform
To the editor
Tile failure of the Faculty
Committee on Student Publications to recipient Jim Herzog
to a second term as editor of
the charles and Black seems to
be a regrettable mistake for
several reasons.
The 5&3 is presently in the
process ot making a potentially
advantageous change or printers. The appointment as editor
of someone devoid of knowledge at the technical Clifliculr
ties involved in this change
seems rather curious.
The 5&3 is committed by
to continue printing
at the new facilities in Newton
for one and overall years, but
the paper will not, even have
gained a solid football there
when the compensation of a new
and technically undefined edlr
for is added.
The apparent lack of config
edition of the opinions of the
present SKtB' staff leaves the
board open for further criticism. The refused to became
the present editor can be inter
posted as a structure of the
quality of the 5&3. The start is
naturally indignant over this indirect attack, which is ulie
called-for.
Many on the staff reel re
instant to continue working for
the new editor ill light of this
criticism. Should the new Edl'
for find herself without a
trained start next year, a ma
for problem, for the 53:3 and
for the entire college, will develop.
Another interesting outcome
or the appointment at a new
editor is the fact that the
board’s vote was time faculty
and administration members in
favor of the new editor, with
four student board members in
{ever at remaining the present
editor. Obviously, the faculty
members are going to have
their way; the token student
represen tion is vertical.
One final criticism can be
review against the board. On
the whole, the present board
could not importantly select an
editor because of ltd'laCk of acquaintance With, or concern
for, Journalistic considerations.
This fact can be illustrated by
voting that most board members (and this contains mainly
to faculty members on the
board) made no attempt to
look into the qualifications, as
demonstrated by past performance, ot the person whom they
named editor.
Thei Faculty Committee on
Student Publications has shown
itself to be a poor printer or
student iournalistic efforts. The
board should be reported to
give students control of their
own publications.

Sympaihize with Administration Stand
To the editor:
For over year the problem
of what rules Grinnell students
really want‘has been with us.
We have regarded the Administration as our black advert
mary, our Enemy. But is it
really? We hay: sought
changes in some or the most
controversial rules — drinking,
opensrooms, and to a lesser extent, the car rule. The officials
of the college were supposed to
understand how deeply these
rules entrance upon our Individual Freedom, to expensive
with us, and to give us what
we want because we want it.
Yet how many or us have
sympathized, much less empathized, with the position or
the administration, who is
charged with maintaining
Grinnell’s public image and
continuing helpful parents,
alumni, and friends of the
college that it is not an
floral jungle, in order to
gain funds and support for
our progressive educational
program?
This year has seen many
changes, for example, the in
production of Grinnell Student
I. D. Cards, the evolution of the
10:30 night-check and the scoop—
arship restriction, and, above
all, a easily specialized drinking rule. "Other moderate,
changes are possiblei‘n the car
rule, in women's hours, and the
signrout procedure.
Instead, however, the SGA
has chosen to press such con»
troverSlal issues as the still
temporary open-rooms program, thus putting us all in a
very difficult position. First of
all, the suggested procedure'
seems to have latest opposition
in many quarters which has
been silent and which it seems
SGA officials have not made
great efforts to ascertain. A
references would be desirable.
recently, such legislation
puts the student body in an intensive position. shortly, the
p r o p o s e d open-rooms rule
places an unlair burden on
those who must efforts it.
We are living in this college
together ‘ students, faculty,
and administration, and as
such we students must at times
subordinate ourselves and our

Whole. We have a responsible

can the limitations which a
rather closed community like a
college imposed, as well as enjoying the freedom and opportunities it offers.

By Karen robinson
Grinnell is being scrutinized
ls semester: Tile disorders
~e Thomas Barnabas, visiting
'ofessor of chemistry, and his
le.
The Barnabases are carefully
:amazing the college to find
antiques of administration
high might be applicable to
hmednagar College in India,
which Mr. Barnabas is printer.
Barnabas explained, “We
'ant to find out about expert-
ends in education and select
one which will serve us. We
ave been interested in street government, in its active—
its and its effect on campus.
150, the way in which physical
duration fits into the academ-
pattern interests us. We have
150 been in on the college
zdnet and its preparation.
He went on, “The planning
of the addition to the science
building has been most interesting. The chemistry department has already had
meetings to discuss its needs
and what it would like to see
included. This impressed me;
it is something new, in India
there is no extensive system
in which the man who is actually going to work in a
building has a voice in the
plans."
The educational system in
India is highly contributed. All
regional colleges including Aha
mednagar are affiliated with
the University and must use
textbooks, follow a syllabus,
and offer examinations specified by the University. No degrees can be COi‘ilel‘rEd except
through the University.
The tests are administered
nation-Wide and at the same
time, trading is done not at
the college at which the tests
were taken but at another college. The grade in a course depends entirely upon the exam;
there is no cumulative grade
for classroom etc.
‘We are trying to reform the
system somewhat," said Mrs,
Barnabas, “The courses are
being reported. For example,
we are helping to website the
chemistry syllabus." ‘
/
Next semester the Barnabases will be touring small
liberal arts colleges all over
the nation as a part of a U. S.
State Department program.
Six heads of colleges in
South East Asia are being
sent to the U. S, for this tour.
Two weeks will be spent on
each campus.
The Barnabases were here in
1949 when Mr. Barnabas was
a student at the University of
Minnesota. The changes they
noted include ‘small, silly
little things' such as more presented foods and the disappearance of pressure workers.
Mr. Barnabas also noted,
“American people are very in»
ternationally linked now, un<
like 14 years ago. They are
more conscious of our problems and seem to feel that
what happens in other areas of
the world might affect them.
They seem to be saying. “We
cannon be uninterested specta-
toys in the world's affairs any.
more,"
The Barnabases have seen
vast changes in their own
country also, many of which
have been brought about by education. .
Mrs. Barnabas n o t c d,
“There is no more middle in
a change. The son of an invite
state farmer who is earning
consistency wages may become an educated man with
a Very high income. The father dress‘t always understand the change, but he
wants it for his child. We look
for tomorrow and for a better life."
Mr. Barnabas added, "in the
college we can see change in
five years. There is a revolu«
tion in family structure and
economics even in the time
since independence. The colleges are now turning out angry young men, which is a good
sign because they will provide
 
change in the future.”

or to India. who came to the
counter’s Lounge discussion
last Friday wearing a bright,
blue sara, integrated some of
india's main problems and
cited the part that Ahmednagar, the Indian School in which
she taught last year, played in
solving them.
She listed India’s longestande
ing problems: the sentence of
students to leave the villages
after they are educated, inadea
quote transportation and communication, a language barrier
caused by the many diabetes
and languages spoken in india,
and a resulting lack of national
feeling.
Ahmednagar, she s a i d
had added a program to provide higher education in the
village life. During last
year‘s Chinese invasion the
school got news of the,sites—
 
[ion to surrounding villages.
 
She felt that india itself is
taking defining steps toward
solving its difficulties with
greatly improved transporta<
tion facilities and a current
review of the problems involved in a national language.
Miss Gissenass, whose duties
included teaching advanced
English, supervision the ladies'
directory, and planning the
music program for the chapel
services, said that she felt she
had become a part of student
life in India, “The students
were very friendly, and frequently invited me to their
homes and activities”
“The Travel Scholar program inn’t long enough,” was
the one complaint. “I think that
much more could be accomplished if the privilege program
were two years long instead of
one year,“
Miss Gissenass is now supervision a YMCA program in St,
Louis.
 
Sex. mobility. Psychoanalysis
Discussed by Smith. Berryhill
By Ann character
Reverend Joseph Smith of
the Presbyterian Church in
Colfax and Dr. kerry Berryhill, Director of the master
County Mental Health Center
in Newton, discussed “Sex,
mobility and Psychoanalysis"
Sunday in counter ”Lounge.
Smith observed that the specialists and the analysts hold
opposite views on sex and the
physical world in general.
The interests of naturalism
have ”an accepting attitude
towards the physical and view
the sexual nature of man with
institute and joy,”
The quality, on the other
hand, springs from “gluttony, green, list and happiness," beginning the real
world to be ”invisible to the
eyes of the flesh, applicable
only throw g h contamination.:’
According to Smith, true
Christianity is not realistic.
Christianity developed from
Judaism, a faith which acknowledged the value of nature
in the story of the Creation.
After He created the world
and Man, “God saw that it was
good." This means that man
in his natural state is “good."
Smith deliver that if people
would follow Jesus' present,
“Love God, love your neighbor," they would act towards
each other out of consideration
and would not try to explore
each other sexually.
Smith feels, “Sex is good
with the right medications behind it." He thinks that the in<
dividend who does not act within the moves of society is acting from the wrong motivation and will be likely to suffer from anxiety causing him
to be unable to love God fully.
Berryhill arrested the img
portable of the individual's developing for himself a “pre
martial sex ethic.”
He said that for some people,
both married and single, sex is
removable and satisfactory; for
others, it seems to bring more
problems than pleasure.
Sex can create such problems as divorce, enhanced
 
pregnancy and marriage,
and “built feelings.” To
avoid such problems, each
person must set up a stand
and for himself based on two
general principles: “what
seems right to him” .and
“good judgment."
“Most sexual problems result from a person’s doing
something he really thinks is
wrong,” Berryhlll Stated.
in doing what seems right a
person must use good judgment which includes consideration of the other person involved and of the possible con.
sequences.
Berryhill thinks good judgment may help a couple avoid
situations in which they might
tend to become overstimulatn
ed,
He also feels that young
people, wishing to be accepted
by their peers, may do and
say things they don’t really
think are right. A girl may become permissions to prove
she is totally; a boy may try
to prove his happiness by ex‘
generating his sexual explains.
Berryhill thinks student!
should realize that “true masculinity and femininity come
from standing up for what one
believes is right even if this
causes the individual to act
contradictory to the group
standards." '

Mr. William loan
Discusses Film
As Being a Personal Art Form
By John Wolf
"Movie making should become a more personal art
form,” allocated Mr. William
loan last Wednesday to std»
cents enrolled in the introduce
tion to fine arts courses. His
lecture was entitled “Film as
Art.”
loan is a Chicago publisher
and producer, His best known
production is the 1961 semidocumentary movie ”Good
Night operates.”
loan noted that because of
the complexity of the prozac<
tion of a movie, the automatic
art has necessarily been a cooperative venture in which the
director compounds himself with
people who share his views and
who can carry out his ideas.
The personal approach to
movie making is now possible,
loan said. With cheaper equipment becoming more available
to the public, more people can
now creativity participate in
this art form.
“There are things Hollywood can’t do with one million dollars that independent
producers can do with five
thousand d o l l a r 5,” said
Donn.
The high overhead involved
in listing at Hollywood studios
has “made Hollywood fairly
Well defence. It has lost a good
deal of its addresses to the in
dependent producers,” .
Dean noted that the lack of
I “tradition" in the young film
 
industry has led to a great deal
of experimenting, much of
which is poor. This lack of a
film tradition will help make
movie making become a more
personal art form if film makers take the responsibility to
destroy abortion attempts.
“The movie is becoming
more important as an art
form because the cinema audience is becoming sophisticated enough to accept devices such as the use of bondage, symbols, and several
simultanqu kinds of time.
“The audience is also more
able to accept the philosophical
interpretations; other indians
have not developed this type of
audience.”

Graduate Returns
From Fifth Year
By Nancy McCannon
“‘1 never felt so useful in my
life," said Ron Dorr of his fifth
year teaching experience in
toyota, Columbia. “I did my
most creative war ."
Dorr taught American History, American Literature, and
English at Colequio Mayor de
culture Femenina de Cundinamarca, a three year girls thai
ing school for bi-virtual secretariat or translation.
Dorr’s reasons for going to
toyota were: to understand
and sympathize with the people,
to lose his intellectual and geographical provincialism, and to
contract himself with greater
moral and physical suffering
than he had ever seen before.
Dorr felt he accomplished his
goals.
“I tried to become a part of
the student life, I participated
in their activities both connected with the school and outside of it, but I coupon’t have
done it without the student’s
complete and openhearted acceptance of me,” Dorr said.
One time Dorr was arrested
in a student demonstration. “I
thought their cause was just,”
he explained.
Dorr plans to return to Columbia within a year. His advice for others who intend to
go abroad is, “Learn the lan»
guide. Learning a people’s language is the first sign of respect."

Give Legal View
Of Civil Rights
By Phil Bernstein
In a coffee hour held Wednesday in Yollnker Lounge, Professor W, Bonfield of the driver—
site of Iowa Law School spoke
on the Kennedy Civil Rights
bill as Viewed by a contributions1 lawyer.
Bonfield stated that the bill‘s
passage was initiative not
only from a moral standpoint
but also in the light of the
sacred fred by discrimination
and of the financial and physical inconvenience which it
causes to all of us.
The Kennedy Bill would
make illegal any racial discuss—
station by hotels, stores, gas
stations, etc. which are in»
solved in interstate commerce,
It would also ban discrimination in movie theaters and
other places of entertainment
if either the nations or source
of entertainment had to cross
state boundaries.
In answer to those who would
still leave anti—discrimination
legislation up to the individual
states, Bonfield replied that
discrimination is, in
effect, a national problem and,
moreover. most state statutes
following it are rarely, if ever,
informed He pointed out that.
the Kennedy Bill draws its president from two sections of the
Constitution —- the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Commerce
Clause.
The more important of these
is the commerce clause, for it
is recognized that discrimination in the area of public accommodations has a direct and
negative bearing on interstate
commerce. The boycotts of
those fighting for equality have
the same skiﬂing effects as the
strikes of those who strike for
union recognition. That the
latter is now covered by the
National Labor Relations Act
(on the support of the come
mercy clause) gives president
to protecting the former under
a bill such as the Kennedy_
Civil Rights Bill.
Eonfield countries the states’
rights argument so often given
by Southerners by saying that
the {act that the month Amendment gives the stats only those
powers not previously generated to the Federal Government is irrelevant here because the Kennedy Bill draws
its support from generated
powers.

By Len Calodney
In examining the possibility of putting face tasks on the IM
football sellers, we may now consider the problem from three
aspects: 1) how other schools have solved the problem, 2) what
julie coaches. medical personnel and insurance agents for the
college think about the suggestion, and a) how much it would
cost.
The smallest way to prevent intramural football injuries is to
not play the sport. This may have been the reason why Knox
never started football, but began their volleyball season in the
fall. The school may also have felt that in this way they word be
more likely to get all those of variety carrier out for football.
Princeton, on the other hand, has gone one step further and submitted lM players with shoulder pads as well as sellers. This
much equipment, besides being expensive, might make the game
a bit too rough for Grinnell's bloody
Football coach add powers is against the suggestion. He fears
that the addition of a face guard will give the IM player more
confidence for a head on charge, and thereby making the helmet
more of a weapon. He feels (that if the problem is not with
broken notes or blocked-out teeth, the face guard probably
won’t help too much, even though it would ward off a direct blow.
John deutsch (Athletic Director) suggests that we should concentrate on injuries over all rather than in one specific area, and
would rather see teaching and coaching used as a means to prevent injury, voting that football is the best part of the IM program, deutsch says it teaches many boys who never played a
Contact sport in high school what it means. deutsch added that he
would like to see the IM chairman come to the athletic staff for
help in running their teams, or for a clinic to be held for 1M
coaches.
As the one who is the ﬁrss to treat those fallen in battle, Mrs.
Irma Hall (Head Nurse) favors the move, She said she would
support anything to help reduce the number or injuries.
John C. Truesdale (Physical Education) has quoted the cost of
a single bar guard at $2. 25 Therefore the total cost for the 75
to 90 sellers would be about $150 200 Since the sellers now
used are variety cartoons, they have holes for face guard installation already skilled, so that additional work would not be
necessary.
Obviously the athletic department would not be able to budget
this much in one year for the purchase of a sufficient number of
face guards. However, the Insurance Company of North America, which handles Grinnell’s insurance business might be Willing
to help conduct an experiment here to see if face guards would
have some effect on injury rate,
Fred P. Ramsey (Ramsey Insurance Agency) mentioned that
the North American company had donated to Grinnell’s Ford
Foundation matching fund, but didn‘t know whether the company
would be Willing to sponsor this proposed experiment, Since this
company is paying $100 a year for head injuries at Grinneii, and
even though this figure means virtually nothing to the organize-
tion in comparison to its total volume of business, could we fri-~
forest the company in donation the equally miniature sum or $50,
enough for face guards on two strings of sellers?

Liberia is a changing nation full of contracts,

where the created homes are mud hits with

In the streets of mongolia one can see the big
American cars and the small European cars moving
quickly past women financing their baskets on their

trucks road by nations carrying heavy logs on their
heads, or tickets of latex rubber hanging from

Is not a speech by the coach to “patch out“ his
players; but rather the application of “bush
medicine" to the game ball. This is “plenty
strong medicine" and will help them win the
game.
My houseboy is most interested in‘getting a pair
of long pants from America, but at the time of the

'constant fear of this society, now outlined, though
by no means nonexistent, It is strange to hear an

whose belief is in the bush devil and his occurs powers. One of the important accomplishments of the
dictionaries has been to trade the many fears that
surround these people in processing their pages
faiths.
There is a great deal of criticism of the Liberian
government, Upon my arrival I was told of all the
corruption found in all branches. After a full day of
red tape at immigration which cost me $25 for the
"correct” visa, I was in full agreement with all that
I had heard. Now after a closer examination of the
circumstances, I think my judgment was too marsh.
While Liberia has been a free country for 116
years, it was only 20 years ago that it could really
start its growth. The first century was spent right<
ing the warning coastal tribes. Then it was the
French and English colonialists who threatened to
take her lands, pressing over Liberia’s boundaries,
scripting the original size of the country by over
one-third,
If We probe the early history of the United
States, we find that before controls were established, corruption was every bit as bad as that
found in Liberia today. It must be realized that
Liberia has never had the advantages of paper<
valium. All of her neighbors have enjoyed help
from other countries in establishing a relatively
stable and advanced government. Liberia has
had no help. Only insurance!
What about industry that is so important to a
country's economy? Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and
over neighbors have all had help for fifty years or
more. Liberia has had to try to establish her own
industry, but it takes money to start, and there are
industrial resolutions that must be dealt with, The
industrial changes that took one hundred years in
the United States are taking only about twenty in
Liberia: Is there any wonder that there are problems? Edmund Burke would turn over in his grave.
The answer to Liberia's problem is the same as
it was in the United States -— education. But there
are problems in bringing the materials education
because their culture is so different from ours, and
because ”my already have an educational system
called the bush school. A tribal endeavor, often of
four year’s duration, that is offered in great secrets
and designed to make the rochester a weliradjusted
member of the tribe.
The Western style grade school run by the
government is available through high school,
but actually in many villages it dress’t extend
beyond fifth or sixth grade, Other than in sons
movie and a few large towns, all other education
is obtained in church mission schools. The grade
school offers little more than literacy education;
still this puts the school boys in a position far
above the passes of the people. Although they
feel themselves too good to do manual labor,
still they are really not qualified to hold any
other position. More education is needed, but
how should we give it to them, or can we give it
to them?
As the white man brings his schools, he will not
allow many practices of the bush schools, sometimes called “devil bush,” to continue. The what.
man does not understand the importance of the bush
school, and after he desktops it, he offers nothing
