The students or the United States rarely get

the present struggle for civil rights. opportunity—
ly, however, the activists in civil rights are new
and tar between. Most at us are happy to give our
opinions, but new icel concerned enough to get in.
v ilvcd in doing anything,
The most important explanation for this lack
. involvement by the US. student community is
s:reply the fact that there is no distinct student
community. In many countries oi the world, uni»
variety students are very conscious that they are
a separate classic the society. with ways at thinking and sets at valu - all oi their own.
Th is especially true in the stilHleveL
using nations. Through the process oi chem»
tion, students in these countries became aware
that there are alternatives to the way things
are happening. They become aware that democracy is an alternative to impressive government. and that social and economic prior-in is air alternative to the desirable liic oi
the great majority or their people. The result
is usually an intense experience with the
way things are being rrrn. often this missﬁts
intention blowjobs into reception,

is intense and unified political action by students, ,
and (El this action is directed toward social re.
form.
. Does this occur because other students
are more concerned about their country and
their people than are the students or the 11.5.?
I t'lou't think so. And there certainly are
enough oi us ready to rebel, given the a. use.
The big difference is the fact that there is no
widely iclt need for major rcioi-ms in this
country. except perhaps in the area oi civil
rights. We have printed along withorrt ever
doing much, because there was never very
much we needed to do.
The danger is that, alter all ot these years,
we may not rccogliide a real problem when we
see one, Many students see such an issue in the
battle for civil rights, whether this is a widely
held conviction has yet to be found out. (Maybe.
as a bare start to check on this statement. let's
count how many people are willing to part with
some oi their old books, finally needed to execute
other Americans)

The “philosophy of advisory”

The committee proposed that‘i
the ireshman write an essay for

discussing “what he would lakes
to obtain from a liberal after
education.” which would allows
him to “speak francis without
the pressure involved in the essay he writes for acceptance to

suggestions were also made‘
that the advisor meet his fresh—

them more time for consultation
