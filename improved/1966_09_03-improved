Success Story of F armor 8&8 Editor
BOB HODlERNE, gonna. 5&3 editor. interviews a resident oi
Chicago's west side. medicine is now a war photographer in
Viei Nam.
Ed. notes The following report
was written by Henry Wilhelm
'68, a close friend of manner
5&3 editor Bob Hodierne. Hi)diet-ne is now a war photographer in diet Nam.
By Henry Wilhelm
"We were walking across this
big open area (much like a valley
between mountains or jungle) and
from quite a ways up ahead two
machine guns (30 cal.) opened up
on us. The land we were on was
showing up to a players where the
machine guns were and they were
quite distant from us. So the budgets coupon’t get low enough
The above was taken from a
letter by Bob Hodierne, former
5&3 editor, who has temporarily
quit school to work as a war
photographer in diet Nam. Shortly alter the conclusion of last sea
master. supreme sold some stock
to buy a one way plane ticket,
told his parents that he was “go
mg to travel around," bought two
Nikon F cameras, and left for Saigon by way or Hong Kong.
When he arrived in Hung Kong
he found that he could not be in
diet Nam for longer than seven
days since at the time he was not
accredited by any “responsible
news organization." But he went
on anyway in the hope that he
would find someone to accredit
him other he got there.
Hodierne wrote: “1' got to kai-

New Dean Discusses Grinnell
By Ann Kirschner
Mrs. Alice Low, Grinnell's new
dean Ol’ women, is more interest-
ed in establishing a philosophy oil
living for the residence calls than
in putting emphasis on rules.
Mrs. Low teens that college still
cents should continue to assume a
great deal of responsibility within the hall system. however, she
also said in all interview last week
with an 5&3 Writer, “You cannon
put 500 girls in the Quad and not
have rules. There are some people
who might otherwise iniringe on
the freedom of others." Mrs. Low
said that a rule should be put into
effect it a situation typically requires it and if it also makes
sense in a longer-sage view.
Greater studenlrfaculty communication outside the classroom is
one of Mrs. LnW's main concerns.
Many or the faculty expressed in
forest last spring in having more
informal discussions with students.
Mrs. Low said, “This is a two-Way
street, but students must take the
initiatiVE.” She would like to see
groups of students interested in
having a particular discussion invite processors to the hall younger.
Mrs. Low feels that it is not the
number of Students involved that
would determine the success of
such a meeting, but how meaningful it was to those who participated. She hopes that the discussions
will become more informal.
Mrs. Low has taken a special int
forest in the availability at more
academic and personal counseling.
Aside from the professional services offered to students, Mrs.
Low will be meeting with the Battleboards to better prepare them
to deal with the problems they
might encounter in their capacity
of advisors.
in response to feelings expressed
last year by students about how
ing at greater say in determining
the curriculum, Mrs. Low feels
that the administration should be
‘willing to listen to suggestions and
iparticipate in charitable diSCIlS<
‘lions. She Said that the students
must realize that Wllile they will
not be able to make the final decisions, the administration should
be very interested in working
closely with them to determine the
possibility of institution courses
where interest has been shown and
also for explaining why certain
courses may not be given,
Mrs. Low was dean of women
for the past six years at Central
Washington State College, Elicnsberg, Washington. where she received her master's degree. She
was an undergraduate at Eastern
Washington State College.

The “great parking lot control

House Cleaning»-
The charles & Black is cleaning house. The dealtime of the former editor calls for a reassessment of
.he S&B role. This reassessment cannon be completed
until the Board of Student Publications names its
choice for new editor. In the dealtime, however, several things seem clear.
First, the 5&3 should continue to be a radical
voice in the Grinnell community. It should not be
afraid to step on the does of administration and faculty,
and it should also be prepared to step on student does.
The 5&3 editor and his staff members have access to
more information about all aspects of the campus than
any other group or individual. They should be prepared to use this information to export businesses
and promote strength throughout the community
Second, the S&B should become a responsible
voice in the community. decorating is sometimes
necessary, but it can only be effective if the community
has confidence in the reliability and poverty of the
8&3. Too often in the past the 58:8 has found itself in
the role of the little boy who tried wolf. To overcome
this role, the 5&3 must strike for accuracy and technical strength, not sensationalism.
Finally, the 58:3 staff should not be a social
unique. Much about the nature of the S&B’s operation
sends to foster a highway knit staff. Nevertheless, in so
far as it is technically possible the S&B should be sun-
order by a large staff of interested students. It is up
0 the S&B leadership to encourage widespread party station in the production of the paper; it is up to
the student body to be ready to spend time and effort
to make the S&B a strong voice in the community,
These three areas, radicalism, responsibility and
participation, seem from this viewpoint to be the most
vital concerns of the S&B in the semester ahead. They
have been switched only broader above. Hopefully,
circumstances will make it possible to expand on them
in the weeks to come. The first step must come Sunday
night at the first staff meeting of the year. The importance of this meeting and the evidence of student
support which the attendance will show cannon be
arrested too heavily. If you care about the future of the
charles & Black and are willing to device time and of»
fort to its success, you will be in the S&B office at 8:30
pm. tomorrow.
