one in the ceiling of another student's room.
The student had several guns in

After the incident, a meeting
was held by the members of Lan—

turn himself over to the Men's
Primary Court, or he could hope
that he would get away with the
showtimes by using a cover of silence pleased by the meeting of

Dean Thompson told the student
that the Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs would meet that af«

that the student begin packing immediately because he wanted the

for appearing in the College

Forum Director, Mrs. powell

The student went to the Forum last Week in the Company
of several other students, all of
whom apparently had been
drinking, When Mrs. Hawk had

S. Eugene Thompson, dean
of men, turned the incident

Thompson said that “there
has been some trouble with

added that the CofHP has pr0<

allowed to handle the problem
by having its members spend
time at the Forum “offering
out drinks."
“It might help the issue to
have students, rather than constraints, working on the problem," Thompson said.
Referring to the suspended
student, Thompson said, “I
don't think he planned the inch—

St. Olaf Tries Interim; Carleton

Two Antioch College seniors have
established a directory service to
provide food delivery, laundry service, and, most ambitiously, a
scheme to synchronize all the
clocks on campus. The Antioch
regard writes, “This has never
been done in the memory of mod»

Beluit College is offering upperclassmen opportunity to take a full
term of work during the summer
at the University of Guadalajara,
Mexico, The seminar studies include two courses in advanced oral
Spanish, one in Mexican art and
architecture, and an independent
study project.
A revised calendar at St. Olaf
College now provides for a tourweek interim period. Students
can choose from 96 interim
courses or independent study in
Europe or Mexico.
280 sophomores at St. Olaf will
go on dates picked for them by a
computer. Applicants filled out a
questionnaire previously used at
Iowa State University, comparing
them on 41 different points. At
Carleton College, students are
planning their second Computer
Date Night. They used a two~part
 
questionnaire with a psychological
preference test and a statistical information section.

letters to M other
Although this column is really nothing more than
a chance for my mother to hear from me once a
week, the awful treasures of society are sometimes Just so great that I'm forced to sit down and
set things straight around here. By sheer council
dance, the new Forum is an awiully good target
for a little bit of compromise intelligence.
The first thing that should be pointed out is
that Gtinnell students still don’t have a student
union, "they haven't had one since the old one was
porn down, Temporary societies were ﬁrss set up
in Main basement and then in that new building
there in front of the library. holiday, mother,
maybe some day . ..
In the dealtime, though. there's no need to make
the situation more difficult. If students Want to use
the showroom and window displays in the new
building, they ought to corporate with the administration headlines who also use the place. On
the other hand, I think it would only be police for
the students to be given proper respect.
The [list obvious problem has to do with the grace
and liability that's running company over there.
Please don't. misunderstand me; I think grace and
genrihty has its place in his, along with gold shoes,
clock bottles, and anything else. Grinnell House
is full of it, and that’s fine with me. What l want
to know is what that has to do With students? There’ll
be plenty or time for grace and liability in later
years, when we can‘t ﬁnd anything better to do.
At the moment, however we are presumably con
corner with more interesting and more important
matters.
Aside from all the betty little ways in which predictions mortality has been dropped over there—
dropped like lace handkerchiefs worked in cheap
perfume — the incident in which a Grinnell student
was suspended from college is of the most interest.
The decision of the dean cannon be customized, The
student involved directed unmistakably archive language at a lady. The dean or men characterized the
incident as “outrageous," which it was. But it was
also more outrageous than the dean of men has
apparently considered. The incident could not have
occurred in anything but an outrageous situation.
The student was asked to leave the building in a
manner which was both unprovoked and thoroughly
incentive (please ignore the front). There was
neither right nor reason for this i concerned result. It occurs to me that “delicious" might have
been a better choice or words in the dean 0! men's

Thompson told 35 members of,

question about something being
done" He continued "Ii you think
there have been arbitrary actions
before, you haven't seen anything

“If any more goes on, we just
start shooting people down," said
the Dean. One consideration he
mentioned was putting the entire
hall on promotion, with those already having probationary status
facing even more severe action.
Langan Hall, 'he said, is the
“crummiest place to live on North

the incident from several sources.
He said, “It was talked up all
around the campus. Lots of people
knew including several CoiHP
members. They knew the incident
had occurred and they knew who
had done it, but the student was
protected by the students around
im who knew of the incidents”
Dean Thompson stated, “Some
faculty members were in favor of
turning the affair over to the Grinnell police. I called the station,
without using any names, and
asked about charges and penalties.
The police cited three or tour
charges, each punishment by at
least 30 days. Had the incident OCcurred some place else in town,
such as a hotel, the student would
have been in considerable more
serious trouble.”
Dean Thompson summer up the
incident and the protection surrounding it as, “Incredible.”

Booth Views Interim naturally
By Sue Johnson
With the comment that “Interim”
is definitely a customer, professor Wayne C. Booth stated, “The
highest point of the year should
be this time when you can get free
of instructors and get down to education.”
Booth, Dean of the Undergraduate College of the University of
Chicago and coleman professor oi
English in the graduate department, made the above observe»
tions during his stay at Grinnell as
guest lectures for the freshman
lecture series. Having worked with
various types of independent study
himself, he was very much interested in Grinnell's Interim, upon
which he feels Grinnell needs to
bold. He stated that the students
should perhaps be better trained
to study independently, for many
students, unaccustomed to the lack
of supervision and direct pressure, aspect a post-graduate year read-
are invisible of using the time to
good advantage. “The trouble with
American education,” said Booth,
“is that too little attention is given
to building a love or each subject.
The aim of a course should not be
to put in as much as possible, but
to be sure that students will go on
education themselves in that
area.” Although Booth has complaints that his high school and
college education was not rigorous
enough, he acknowledged the fact
that he enjoyed and promoted from
having enough time to read and
listen to music.
Apparently Booth learned from
his undergraduate work at program Young University and his
graduate work at University or
Chicago how to make the most of
his leisure time. After completing
work on his PhD. in English, he
ing philosophy under a Ford Foundation grant and a Guggenheim
year writing literary criticisms. He
then taught ”beautifully every—
thing" for nine years at abraham
College, a liberal arts college very
similar to Grinnell, after which he
returned to the University of Chi—
cage as a processors In 1961 he
published The historic of Fiction,
which is an attempt to deal with
a reflected aspect oi criticism oi
ﬁunion. That aspect is the whole
dimension of fiction which makes
it able to communicate effectively
to an audience, rather than the objective view which sends to ignore
the audience. The book received
the Christian cause Phi Beta
happy award in 1962 for being the
most distinguished piece or literary
criticism of the year,
Despite the fact that he is still
 
teaching courses and seminars in
literary criticism, forms of the
novel, problems in the critical 0i
fiction, and English, professor
Booth’s greatest concern is travelling his duties as Dean of the
College, for undergraduate educa
tion is his basic love. Worried
about the diminishing amount of
fun in undergraduate life, he wants
to work on the problem of pregraduate treasures; as he states
it, “A liberal education should be
a time when you are generated.”

Brzezinski analyses Leadership,
Power, Groups in Soviet Union
By Dick ready
Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski began this year’s Rosenfieid lectures on contemporary Russian
affairs by discussing “The
Character of Leadership.”
Brzezinski travel the development of Soviet leadership from
begin to Kosygin and Brezhnev.
begin's rule was characterized by a “fusion of functions,”
meaning that begin accepted
the roles of party organizer,
professional revolutionary, ide<
clogue, and personal rules all
within himself. His power did
not have an institutional base.
begin intended on charisma
for his power.
Those surrounding the first
Soviet leader were all dedicated penalties, and begin expanded the determination of all.
He was able to maintain power
by everything leadership on the
can‘etc of levels mentioned,
and by his extension with personal instead of institutional
power.
italic, on the other hand, intended not so much on personal power as he did political beverage, as the party he
came the employment of what
is correct. Any charisma he ob—
gained was from the party.
The four bases for italic’s
power were the state, the party, the army, and the secret
police. He ruled by maintain<
ing the proper balanced between these bases, and by financing creation with relaxation, italic’s government then
tested on a “complex web of
cross-controls,” and none was
allowed to develop to challenge
his authority.
According to Brzezinski, italic was able to accumulate power on the basis of Commitments
to great tasks: characterization,
industrialization, the war. All
these tasks led to an expansion of the powers of the party
and its rules.
Khrushchev was seen as a
practitioner figure, under which
BRZEZINSKI—

By David Lighthourne
“We are likely to see in the Soviet Union an increasing sentence
for leadership at the top to become
more limited in time," according
to Dr. Zhigniew K. Brzezinski, director of the Research institute on
Communist Affairs at. Columbia
University.
Speaking at the second of this
year’s Rosenfield Lecture Series,
Brzezinski travel the acquisition of
power in the Soviet Union from
italic through Khrushchev, and
pointed to the similarities and differences in their emergency to
power. Brzezinski then outlined the
implications of his study with regard to future Soviet power strengths,
The pattern {or requiring power,
said Brzezinski, has been a grammar
transition in which the future leader starts as an equal among
equals, at the top of the Soviet
hierarchy, then he becomes first
among equals, and finally first
among nonequals. italic followed
this pattern, Brzezinski said, roughly from 1923 until 1934. Speaking of
the year 1934 Brzezinski noted,
“Now, terror takes on a physical
violence,” as italic was soon to
guarantee his secretary. Khrushchev, likewise, followed this pattern, rising in a much more compressed period equal among equals
in 1953 to a position above his associates in 1957, Brzezinski said.
“in both cases, italic's and in
Khrushchev’s case, we are not
dealing with a skilled organizer
who rose to power on the basis of
a slnlllul cancellation of organizational devices—which is true in
both cases, but to my mind has
been arrested too much, In both
cases we are also dealing with in4
divisions who effectively perhaps,
or constitutes, associated themselves with the right issues at the
right time. And in politics this, of
course is of the greatest importance."
italic, on the basis of certain era
ganizatianal devices, as well as
sending accurately the mood of the
emerging party utficialdom, said

By Glen Ashmon
Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, in
the final Rosenfield lecture,
shattered the longstanding
concept of Communist Russia
as a humanitarian state whose
leaders are responsible only to
the party. The lecture, “Groups
and Policy Making," listen—
twisted three kinds of groups

The least residential of these

for 40 per Cent of the popular

put in protest against unpopular official policy.
The second class of pressure
groups that Brzezinski acknowledged was the “special interest
group.” Such groups are composed of the literary segment
of Soviet society—some 150,000
scientists, 350,000 physicians,
and the Jewish minority. Spec—
ill interest groups become active when policies of the Soviet
interface with their real or
examined "rights.”
Finally, Brzezinski recognized
“policy groups” as the most
powerful of the pressure groups.
He explained that policy groups
include nearly 200,000 top g0vcrnment officials who are not
members of the Central Committee—committees of military personnel and state ministers. Brzezinski outlined the
following reasons for explain»
ing the influence of policy
groups:
a) Extreme johnston. Policy
groups are well organized
units such as the military.
b) Strategic location, Policy
groups have offices or branches
in major cities as well as in
the Kremlin itself.
c) Access to top leadership.
Policy groups maintain rely
tions with the Party Secretary
and other officials.
d) Institutional freedom for

the implementation of their
goals.
concerning his lecture, Brzez«
inski divided Russian leadership into five “Columns” ranging from extreme right wing to
extreme left. The far right column includes the central party
at large who impose any
change. They favor a contributed economy maintained by
governmental competitions and
cancellation as opposed to an
open market system. In the
second right column, Brzezinski included the industrial managers who are happy with the
economy as it stands.
accepting the center position
are groups who favor any liabilities policy. Party Secretary Leonid Brezhnev was
placed in this column.
Brzezinski included Khrushchev in the first left hand column along with students and
scientists. Finally, on the extreme left are those economists
who favor a free market system modules after the Western
system.
in summary, Brzezinski stated, “The Soviet Union is no
longer governor on the basis
of single will, single party. The
party itself is no longer a cohesive organization but is porn
by contracting goals."

the party and the Russian so»
dirty as a whole, or to “essay<
wish a sense of personal rely—
tions” between the government
and the people
And because Khrushchev became more popular with the
passes than the party elite
(whom he embarrassed) he became an anachronism. The
Khrushchev style did‘not fit the
Stalinist system,
shared to simple priorities and
not Do the jurisdictional Conflicts occurring under Khrushchev. He had come to power
by heating the reporting Malenkov. However, Khrushchev
later realized “that to make
the Soviet system more depend<
able he had to make it less
humanitarian.”
According to Brzezinski, the
new generation specifies the
first publication change in Soviet leadership in 30 years and
the close of the Stalinist period,
All the new leaders are men
younger than Khrushchev
whose “careers developed in
a wholly institutional frame»
work.”
Khrushchev had given in fluid
days of little johnston between
institutions, while the new lead—

which was.
 
It was precisely these professional party bureaucrats who
saw Khrushchev as a threat be‘
cause he reached out to society.
One event that upset the bureaucrats was an enhanced
meeting of the president to
translate priorities for consumer goods. This was an obvious
conflict with the professional
party bureaucrats, who “are interested in presenting the privacy of the party.”
The new leaders are characterized by bureaucratic professionalism; they are more parochial than the leaders of 30
years ago who were internationally linked. Because the
new elite is provincial and narrow~linked, it can understand
neither the need for sharing nor
an international spirit.
The Soviet system is now the
first to be run and headed almost entirely by bureaucrats,
while most systems allow for
the introduction of non-bureaucratic blood, even at the top.
The important question now is
”Can an automatically oriented
bureaucracy be the basis for
innovation and change?” Can
those who advance on the basis
of consortium be innovation?
Brzezinski closed by voting,
”The problem facing the Soviet leaders is establishing the
relevance of the party to a
more commercialized, instead«
tionalized, advanCed, industrialized society."

politics by the use of violence. “Afterward, terror closed to play an
important role in Soviet politics,"

commentary on the differences
between italic's era and the more
recent past, Brzezinski outlined
several important changes, ”The
range or disagreements between
the top leadership has become
much, much narrower," he said.
“The period of the herein choices
between dramatic alternatives perhaps is over." He noted that the
quality oi Soviet leadership has
declined, and that political victims.
no longer discussed in such a final sense as during italic’s judges,
sometimes recover former offices.
Brzezinski calculated on certain
alternative means for Soviet collective leadership — “which is a
pleasant euphemism for divided
power" — to solve the problem of
discussion.

hour explaining how not to do

many were wondering how one
guy could do so many things
wrong and still spend 13 years

About all fifty would take
credit for was getting other

600 home runs; fifty takes

It is with meditation that any
sports writer attempts a pro-season
basketball prediction, and we too
have our misgivings about the outa
come of the 1965 IM action. The
difficulty lies in finding a suitable
criterion on which to judge the
worth of a team. Certain writers
will maintain that 3 teams shooting
efficiency is somewhat comment

its players are with chest hair, but
this is somewhat 3 Gross Point.
Others are of the permission that
there exists a positive correlation
between senate athletic ability and
high board scores. But the authenticity or such determinants as very-
ﬁable criterion is still curious.
Thus, until this year, sports writers and general athletic supporters
alike were forced to rely on their
crystal balls and any number of
educated glasses. But at last, some
thoughtful and estate sage has pro«
video us with what would appear
to be a ioniproot scheme for accurate predictions: the number or
games a basketball team wins will
hear an inventory professional relationship to the number or install
players on that team.
Since we are left in the dark as
to why this amendment exists, we
must hypothesize on our own, Let
us assume from the outlet that the
activation syndrome of in-state
basketball players is more sensitive
to the decimal level of home crowd
enthusiasm and noise, due to certain emotional ties (God, mother,
State, etc). A physical maniiesta.

to shoot and trouble with twenty

opposition and on a careful statistical evaluation ot the geographical
distribution of the in players in
each hall, it is our prediction that
Loose Hall will walk away' with
the Basketball crown.

rainbow, like you were matching
over a shed, When the hall
came down over the plate fifty
granted it, three it up and hit
it funds~style. The amp, packing
a sense of humor, posted him
out of the game and fixed him
$100. Another time in Cleveland
it was dark and raising and
the Indians were ahead, but
they were trying to finish off
the top of the fifth ending before calling the game so Cleveland would win. fifty walked
up to the plate and lit a match,
explaining to the empire that
he just wanted to make sure
the kitchen knew where he was.
Again he got a trip to the showers which cost him a hundred.
 
We think of the fifteen and stories as the Era of the Big Bonus, but fifty must have had a
nest-egg started away from
somewhere to fall back on
every time an until "cost him

All in all, it was the start
of a good evening, sitting
around with your Honor G
