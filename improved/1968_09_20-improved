The Election
In an interview, newly elected C of HP President Lee april said he wanted to make the position
as important as the AWS Board head. Only 20%
of the male students voted and he received only
11% of the votes.
This hardly represents a mandate, and he may
find difficulties in achieving his aim. Two conclusions may be drawn, The students failed to participate in their own governmental system, and, as a
result, april will be forced, whether he wants to or
not, into representing his own views rather than
those of the electorate
A Good Change
Although it is said that the proper place of
women is with men, in the past at Grinnell men and
women have been separated. The women, through
the success which begins the gentle sex, except on
rare occasions, chose to stay on South Campus. The
men usually preferred to remain in calculate company on North Campus. In a society in which men
and women are intellectually equal, it is only civilized for them to be in the company of one another.
The nature of things pictures that women will
have a taking influence upon men. The providing
of women surely will help to remove some of the
jungle conditions that used to exist in the boys’
directories and Cowles dining room.
A Fine Action . . .
Last year one or two students saw an opportunity for a new course to be offered in the Department of Philosophy and Religion, the course in
ethics. Working seriously with the faculty and administration, and despite abundant bureaucratic
installed, they developed the curriculum of a course
which is currently being taught.
The charles and Black comments this action,
which represents student responsibility in its most
thoughtful and effective form, and it is a sign that
genuine change in the structure of the college is
possible when serious effort is made.
The Community Bicycles
Last year, through the efforts of the David M.
Gibson Memorial Newsletter and some other efforts,
eight bicycles were purchased to be used as community bicycles. These bicycles, which were to be
markedly distinguished, would be hidden by any
student who happened upon one. The rule was that
the bicycles should be left on campus. Before the
painting of the bicycles, however, two of them permanently disappeared. When the remaining six
were placed on campus, they were often minutes,
thrown around, left in town, and sometimes taken
for private use.
It was a noble experiment, one depending on
the essential cordless of human nature. Perhaps
because of Adam’s fall, perhaps because of insurance of the proper way to treat bicycles, the venture
failed. The bicycles remain now by Loose Hall united, broken. and channel.

be at odds with the express
purpose of the staff to win people over to a “radical alternatives’. The obscenity is apparent«
1y 8 part of that alternative,
and I Wonder why.
It seems to me that to per<
shade people to climb out on a
radical political lamb the best
strategy would be to humor the
peoples' possibilities and avoid
estranging them needlessly. It
is english to become involved in
quibbiing over dirty cartoons
during a serious revolution. One
might argue that the sort of
"working classes” the Herodactyi is seeking to attract will
be drawn to such stuff; but
from my own observation many
blue-collar Workers are likely
to be conservative and substantial in their master, and I do not
think the radicals would be
wise to chance depending them
(in ii mere whom.
Now it is an entirely accessible position that the staff of
the “underground" newspaper
is not wise, that the cartoons
are indeed a whom, and that a

But I prefer to give more credit

in his article entitled “The

Schnairov explains the failure
of the Grinneil Student Movement in the following way:
“The real issue was and still

up with the expressed and explained people in the country
and around the world or will
they line up with the processors

It is apparently true that on.

against it. (My revolution, right

Movement seems to be an acceptance of the propriety of having vulgar cartoons in its newspaper. If one puts himself on
the side of Mr. Schnoirov et. al.,
how can he avoid seeking to
approve of the tone of the
Plarodactyi? is he not involved
in an act of complexity in the
wilderness?
Of course, any organization of
alternatives parties people to
ignore destinations and sacrifice
their reason for a particular
drama; and perhaps in an effective revolution people must
give up their right to make individual documents about the
proper course of action and become parts in the great generating machine. But do they have
to make even such things as

A new course is included in

aged as an experiment to serve
two functions: l) to provide a
course in Ethics based on the
students’ own assumptions and
interests rather than the history
of ethics, and 2) to reason out
a series of fundamental questions for group discussions in
the resident calls.
According to Grant Crandall

with the instructors, Mr, Haas

The first eight weeks will be

questions like the existence or

will be spent in applying the

of current importance, such as
those based by Black Power,

season in the Midwest conference.
The team has largely amp r o v e d, although graduation
