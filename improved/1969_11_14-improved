‘ ‘ T h e Grinnell faculty
recognized the significance of
the Vietnam Moratorium by
emphasizing each individual
faculty member‘s and student's
option to observe the
Moratorium as he choices."
The resolution is identical to
the one passed by the faculty
in regard to the October 15
Moratorium.
According to Asst. Prof. John
H. survey, faculty secretary, it
is explicit in the resolution that
students or faculty members
who do not attend classes
during the Moratorium will not
be penalties
However, Dean Joseph Wall
issued a memoradum on the
faculty decision Monday that
said: “The college does have
a contractors relationship with
its students regarding class
instruction, and the faculty
in e m b e r should make
provisions with the students in
the classes he has missed, for
whatever reason, to cover the
work, either through special
meetings of the class or individual conferences with the
students who desire such
meetings."
in Monday’s meeting Wall
asked the faculty in taking
action to separate the cover»
her Moratorium from the Dec»
amber Moratorium. which may

examination period.
“If that happened, it would
call for a different kind of institutional consideration.” Wall
said He asked that faculty
allow the Academic Standing
Committee “to consider
alternatives" so that it can then
recommend a faculty position
on the December, and other
future Moratoriums, which are
expected to last until the War

Some 150 college students and
a smattering of high-school students and townspeople went into
town last night to talk with
people about the war. The can
passing of the toWn was the
main christ of the November
Vietnam Moratorium which
began yesterday and is continuing today.

by freshman Berry vegas,

2000 resident units into blocks

Johnson-simon policy in Vietnam continues," was adapted
from an article in LF. Stone's
Weekly, “The Con Game of

organizing hoped the learners
would facilitate discussion later
Thursday when students went
to speak to townspeople about
the war.
The emphasis of the downtown dialogue was expressed
by junior John Otto at a Thursday morning meeting of the
Moratorium Committee: “We
can’t force ourselves on them
(townspeople). We have to
speak in their language and not
use big words. We have to leave
their country alone. They must
see us as patients trying to
improve their Country."

J/Lcé‘imattc ﬂout
By Henry Scheff
At a mass‘meeting attended
by some 250'students Tuesday
night in-Roberts Theatre,
the Grinnell Student Senate
passed _.a resolution according
the basic philosophy of the
Student positions' Paper. The
students at the greeting'elected
a six»man steering committee
to sort‘ through amendments
and to unlike recommendations
at an open ’h—meeting next week.
After the senate has after on
the amendments, the Position
Paper will be submitted to the
student body for an all-campus
references.
The six members elected to
the steering committee are
Phil years, Bill -Stranger,
“Gene” Prewo (who impressed
the meeting with his infinite
criticisms), Steve Schwartz,
Bruce listen, and pick
Schaalman. Specifically, they
have the following powers:
1) They will divide the
amendments into two groups,
substantial amendments and
“not - picking” amendments.
They will make block decor»
conditions on time "nitpickers” to the Senate,
moving that they accept the
amendments that they feel appropriate and reject the others.
Then, the Senate will consider
the substantial amendments
one at a time for approval.
2) They will have immediate
negotiation and discussion
power and authority, so that
they may meet with administrators and faculty without
delay. There are many areas
of college governance that the
student body is innocent of,
and this committee can begin
to work on these matters. The
faculty and administration are
various to begin discussions
with the students.
The steering committee will
also have the duty of involving
the student body of the substance of the discussions that
ﬂkey will be carrying out with
the administration and faculty.
This madison function is crucial
to maintaining student interest
and support for the issues
raised by the Position Paper.
A number of suggestions and
amendments were made at the
beginning of the meeting, but
basically only a couple of important things were cleared
up. The preamble will be
“cleaner up” by the steering
committee because it is automatically weak. The working
of one sentence was changed,
and more will probably be
done. The essence of the pre
table is at this date exchanges.
The most important debate
of the meeting concerned the
necessity of including Section I
of the Proposals for Structural
Change, the creation of the Co
indicating Council of the College. Gene Prewo argued that
if the purpose of the paper
was to temperature or decentralize the decisionrmaking
power of the college, then the
proposed coordination Council
was inconsistent with this philosophy, and it ought to be
eliminated.
Bruce listen was sympathetic to Frewo’s argument,
but he felt that the student-
faculty-administration committee was needed at the top as
a check on President suggest,
who legally has the final now.
er in college decisions.
Tom Thomas pointed out
that the Council as proposed
did not field very much power; it could make recommendations and had veto power
which could be overturned by
a two-things vote.
The students at the meeting
felt that the advantages of having a coordination Council outweighed the disadvantages,
and voted to keep Section I
as part of the proposed document.
There were several important amendments to the section
on the All-Campus Judicial
Council, Section IV, Part C,
Number 3, '(Procedures)
classes “d" and “er” Clause
“d” was amended to state that
written records of Judicial
Council proceedings shall be
kept, and the defendant has
the option of having his name
on the record or not. The rationale for this is that the
council needs records of all
cases to establish clear procedures, but should still protect
the individual from further
harassment due to any punishment that he may have received from the Council,
Clause ”e” was amended to
clarity the fact that the
President in appeal cases does
not have the power to increase
punishment. He may upload
the Judicial Council decision,
lighter the punishment, or discuss punishment completely if
he so desired, at his own discretion.
If any student has agenda
meets to the document, submit
them immediately if not soon
er to one of the members of
the steering committee, Come
to the next couple of senate
meetings if you are interested
in what happens to the amendmentsi When the references
is announced. study the amended document carefully and
then vote. Power to the people!
The senate has gotten into
the cabin of holding sticky
meetings before the large Student Body meetings, and Tues»
day’s meeting was no exception. The senate Tuesday after
on a number of important
matters. First, the Senate admitted an additional 550 for the
Conspiracy 8. Contributions were rather poor during
John engines' Visit, modeling
maybe $100. The PPPE was
expected to kick in another
$100 to help defeat costs, but
for some reason the PPFE decided that this was not an appropriate way to use their
money.
The Senate had originally allocated $150 from the speakers
fund. With the extra $50, that
gives the Conspiracy about
$300, out of which they had
to pay engines‘ expenses. Con-
'ordering the importance of the
trial. this “supporting" was

Charges Dropped
Against Two Here
At Chicago Trial
Charges against two Grinnell
students arrested while in Chi»
cage during last month's 5135
action were dropped last Friday during a Chicago trial.
Senior Charles german had
been Charged with possession
of a concerned deadly weapon,
and freshman Scott movies had
been charged with disorderly
conduct.
german and movies were
stopped by police while driving
in Chicago Oct. 10, because of
faulty orakelights on german's
car. They then went to the police station to post bond, and
one of the officers found a
tear gas pen while searching
the car.
In court last week, the attendance’ lawyer alleged that
the search of the car was illegal, since the argentina offi—
cars had no reason to enter the
car unless they had seen
something suspicious from the
outside. Because of that allocation, and the fact that the
policemen to l d contracting
stories under path, the judge
granted a motion to supplies
the evidence found in the
s e a r ch. Consequently, there
was no case for the other
charges, and they were
dropped.
The judge also ordered the
brakelight violation to be
dropped. He said the normal
procedure for such an offense
was a warning to the driver to
fix the lights.
The case was the last of four
Grinneli students arrested and
charged in Chicago during the
concentrations. Earlier, freshman Deborah coleman was
placed under court supervision
for six months for running
away from the scene of a
broken window, Freshman Kay
Sophar was fixed $500 for resulting arrest and disorderly
conduct.

John engines: "Our culture Is on Trial"
By pda Gudema
“What‘s happening in Chi»

anti not act. Our culture is on
trial. What's really on trial is
our survival," John engines, a
member of Chicago’s “Conspiracy 8,” told approximately 200
students last Saturday after
noon in Roberts Theater.

commentary on the trial,
engines said, “What’s happening to us in the court in Chi—
cage is the same thing that
happened in the streets of Chicago last summer." He explained that statement by saying the dependence are being
brutalized legally in the countries rather than by the police
in the streets. He added,
“We're survivors, and we're
winning.”
engines said he feels the
most important part of the
trial has been events involving Bobby deals, one of the dependence, deals, N a t i o 11 a1
Chairman of the Black another
Party, was recently tagged
and shackled in the Courtroom.
He has since been sentences
to four years for Contempt of

declared for him.
engines described S e are ' s
ranging as a symbolic attempt
to gay the Black generation
Movement in America. He
said, “No matter how hard
they try, they can’t gay him,
and they can't gay the partners.” engines also accused
the news media of telling only
half the truth. He said they
expensive deals’s verbal attacks on Judge Julius coleman,
rather than his attempt to defend himself. since he has been
forced to accept a lawyer appointed by the court.
While encouraging anyone in.
arrested to come to Chicago to
see the trial, engines Warned
that anyone with long hair, a
board. or “looking like a hip.
pie” will not be admitted.
Those who are admitted are
searched several times. Once
in the countries, engines said,
any specialty who skills,

immediately expected.
Although painting a delicious picture of the trial,
engines arrested that it is no
joke. He said people tend to
see it as a burlesque. but it
inn’t. since all the dependence
expect to be found guilty and
be sent to jail. He said, “We
are wrapped in the countries.
There is no way to escape it
for us."
in order to stop the trial,
engines encouraged the audience to go to Washington this
week to participate in the
march to the “Department of
Injustice." He also tried students to send letters to the
judge or other government officials to Stop the trial.
Speaking of this week’s action in Washington, engines expressed his belief that the per—
mit would be granted for the
massive march on Saturday.
(The permit has been granted.)
He also said any violence in
Washington would be caused
by the police, not the lemon<
senators, since all of the protest
leaders, including the most
military, have announced the
use of violence. He said, “If
anyone has the paul to use violence that will hurt us, he
dress’t belong in the Move»
ment."
Other comments engines
made in his speech and during a question-and-answer period:
0n the trial m “We are in
contents of that court. We figr
like We all have about two
years (in jail)."
On the judicial system —
“There's basically no justice in
this land." He called Judge
coleman a fastest, but explained that coleman is only an
agent of Attorney General

renew — “renew is the dead
center of the simon administration, maybe even a little libs

America.
On the recent SDS Chicago
action — “The Conspiracy supports any concentrations that
support us. . . . We must look
beyond the broken windows, to
the political State. We're not
going to create violence — at
least I'm not —- but We must
understand that there is via-
hence because of Vietnam, not
because of the Weathermen."
0n society — “We want to
be free . . . to have a society
not hung up on property rights.
Society has to fit the needs of
the people in it, not an elite."
On his future — “I don’t
want to leave the country, I
want to work here. . . . After
I get out of jail, the govema

During the morning, engines

differential treatment for
the black man in America
seems to wedding to be the
natural course, and he objects
a once-common notion that the
solution to black problems
could come by the same
means as the solution to Irish,
Jewish, and Italian fraction.
The very fact of color mini<
rated against the ease of this
optimistic idea; wedding put
Blacks, Mexicans, and italiano
in roughly the same place as
far as easy optimization into
the “meeting pot” (a term
wedding also questioned).
“We must determine together,” he added, “where the
primary areas of policy concern are,” coming out strongly
in favor of “pluralism, individual optimization, and determination." The black man, he explained “wants no one out —
he wants in.”
The respect of the audience,
coupled with their apparent
lack of enthusiasm might possibly be reflected in the difference in titles between one of
wedding's books, On Being a

contemporary bigger by Dick
Gregory, Near the end of his
speech, wedding declared, “In
short, I advocate equality. Period.” Gregory. however, in
his autobiography, regards the
advocacy of equality to be so
obvious that he speeds little
time discussing it normally.
Questioned by a student on
what he thought about Afro
haircuts and cashiers, wedding
replied that he saw the value
of distinction styles in reaffirming black identity, a value
which came out, often subtle,
in all of his remarks. The compensation or presidential
treatment he saw as necessary
for the black man in America,
and which has been supported
by britney Young of the Urban League focuses, “direct»
ly," wedding said, on “400
years of mistreatment”; this
statement was one of the few
that wedding made which revealed a compressed anger beneath his systematic, practical

What does the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) stand for?

fisheries with Rubenstein
To the Editor:
1 would like to raise some
points which I feel should be
considered by other people who
attended Dr. Richard L. queen
klein’s three lectures and his
panel discussion.
Dr. Rubenstein’s talks raise
some important questions,
among them this one: Does the
God of sculpture command certain things because they are
automatically right and good,
or are things right and good
because God commands them?
People inside the video-christian tradition have taken both
positions on this issue. But Dr.
Eubenstein assumes that only
one position, the latter. exists.
That position is probably the
less accessible one. since it can
lead to the conclusion that God
might equally well have commander glen to hate one another
and Him. making sacred right.
But if the former position is
taken, then or. Rubenstein's
argument that the God of strip.
sure hills things arbitration falls
apart, as does his claim that
every man can decide for himself what is right.
it is not surprising that Dr.
Rubenstein does not [incl his
connection of the structured
God to bc a very friendly figure.
(Though His lack of appeal
would hardly provide grounds
for a man to assets His nonvexistcncc.) But, as Mr. Burklc
pointed out in the panel discussion, this tyrannical, capricious rather figure of Dr. queen.
klein's is an inadequate view
of the structural God. Does this
figure have anything in common
with the God of the Old Testament — the God who consistent»
ly responded to the reception
of His people by following them
and relating His coverage with
them, who finished only as a
last resort to lead the people to
resistance? Or with the God of
the New Testament, who loved
man so much that He became
a man Himself and died for all
men, so that they might receive
forgiveness and a fulfilling, data
playing life? Dr. Rubenstein is
attending a strap figure, a God
of his own creation.
in his insertion that one can
recognize Auschwitz with the existence of the structural God on1y by making Auschwitz the will
of that Cod, Dr. Ruhenstein is
handling the difficult problem
of evil much too simplistically.
To fix the blame for Auschwitz,
he might more fruitfully begin
with a consideration of the
Philospher he advised so much,
level. To justify the murder of
three million Russian kulaks
and the murder of six million
European Jews, 'men quoted
level. Men who undefined mobility in their own terms picked
up what level. knowingly, had
contributed; they appeared to
his belief in the charitable
triumph of the human spirit to
justify the worst crimes against
the human spirit our world has
ever seen. Yet, if we believe in
the existence of the JudenChristian God, Dr, Rubenstein
tells us we must make that God,
the God who commands men to
love even their enemies, the
author of such an act!
of course Dr. Rubenstein aspects that such a God is dead,
Where is his evidence? To ob
serve that the JudeoChristian
God has met the needs of a jul
sure does not prove that such a
God is a product of that culture’s imagination, created up
to meet those needs. The truth
that a religion interests with the
others aspects of a culture established nothing about the
truth or faculty of that religion.
And even if it could be established that many people
“create" a God to satisfy their
need for a material figure,
what would it proven People
can believe in the right things
for the wrong reasons. (If a
man becomes an imperialist because he had a engineering
father, that is, for a reason
which has nothing to do with
national pride, it does not follow that imperialism is a segment of human imagination.)
Such wishfulfillrnent reasoning
can explain anything away.
Perhaps Dr. Rubenstcin docs
not feel his arguments need any
rational certification. He offers
us instead his “but-level" re
actions to life. But how reliable
are these? Are we to decide on
the basis of a little boy's fear of
death that there is no advertise?
Or are we to conclude that the
video»Christian God is dead and
earth is the “carnival mother”
because a Jewish transmitted
has Palestinian dirt sprinkled
over her coffee? Each person’s
“but-reactions” are different
from everyone else‘s; Dr. Rubenstein might well have cited
“but-reactions" of joy and hope.
Dr. Rubenstein’s insertion that
for him the death of God was
arabic is very puzzling. He seems
to give up the audio—Christian
God with enormous ease; in»
need, he seems only too happy
to shake Him off and extract
a “arabic pessimism." Students
who are considering adoption
the death of God position might
well ask if the issue is not so
terrible important as to require
the most serious kind of thought
and then they would do well to
demand better conventions for
that position than Dr. Rubenstein has to offer.

Midnight Cowboy: “A liberal Film"
By Alan G. master
instructor of Philosophy
British director John Schlesinger (warning, Billy Liar, a Kind of Loving) has
serious reservations about the quality
of American life and culture. These reservations are detected in Midnight Cowboy with a automatic vlrtilosity that
puzzles the visual possibilities. This film
must be seen by all who understand and
appreciate the cinema for what it is.
namely, the highest and most exciting
art form of our time. But this is not to
say that Midnight Cowboy is first rate
cinema. it inn’t. For olle must distinction its philosophical basis from its
execution. 1 shall argue that although
the latter is often available skillful,
the former accounts for the film's ultimate failure, But first, a brief synopr
his of the scenario.
Joe Buck (get it?), a drive young texas disclaimer, decided to break out of
the homeless monitors of small-town
Texas life to seek the Holy trail of excitement and fulfillment in the dream
capital of the U. A., New York City.
He boards a bus and travels to the
east coast confident that the treasures
of the Good Life can be secured with
the money he will earn as the finest
stud east of the Mississippi. After all,
he has a certain undisputable charm,
he is hardcore, and what is most important, he is a terrible lay. Surely
those healthy New York women would
deadly pay luxury wages for a piece of
Joe's action.
recovered in an outlandish cowboy
output, he walks the streets of the city
in search of his first customer. After an
unsuccessful attempt or two, Joe picks
up an aging looked who, after they “do
it" (as one says here in Iowa), response so periodically to Joe’s request
for payment, that he gives her twenty
dollars. Things are not at all going as
Joe had planned. He is soon broke, and
forced to sell his services to a simply
young transexual in the harmony of a
Times Square movie theater. Then he
meets “ratio” pizza, a listing, simply slumdweller who, though unexpected,
manager to eye out a living among a
circle of pumps, stores, queens, transvestites, and doperpushers.
The initial experience with ratio is
discouraging, norman that he is, he sells
Joe an appointment with what he as
sites him is a promising ”customer”,
but who turns out to be a religious
zealot of dynamic dimension. Of course,
ratio has in the dealtime split.
While aimlessly wondering the streets,
Joe spies ratio in a river, and approaches him with anger and department. But the two need one another, and
a deep friendship begins. Joe moves
in with ratio and continues his looked
search for the mythical crotch market.
Meanwhile, the two cannon master the
means to eat, and ratio's respiratory
condition is growing steadily worse. Joe
finally realized, after a spectacular night
with a printer he meets at a nipple
party, that he will never find whatever
he is looking for in New York City. There
remains only one generally meaningful
automotive for Joe: perhaps he can real—
ice for the now originally filing ratio
the latter’s principal fantasy, to absorb
the solar. sexual, and military heroes of
Miami Beach. Joe's own dream has
proved to be an solution, but ratio's
can yet be made real. But first Joe must
get the surface.
in an accordingly brutal scene, .ice
acquired the money from a writing,
middle-aged, corporate transexual. He
boards the bus with a coaching, feverridden ratio, and they begin their journey to the eschaton, as the film moves
inexorably toward its arabic conclusion.
There is much that is comfortable in
this film, it is a polished production
whose professionalism ensures that is
is unflaggingly entertaining. In fact. it
would not be affair to describe Midnight Cowboy as a click film, perhaps
too click in its opportunities use oi, for
example, fast cutting to ensure that the
film is faced with sufficient validity
to make freedom Virtually impose. 12
The film is bound to succeed as ente
shipment, for it successfully artists
self to the best of tried and tested avantgarde techniques. And yet, for those oi
us who make a steady Visual diet of
first rate cinema, this field is routine.
For it is one thing for a filmmaker to
competition employ sophisticated techniques that have been put to far better
use by his predecessors, and it is quite
another thing for a director to make
innovative use oi techniques suggested
by others of comparable statute. Each
involves the competent employment or
interesting and automatically mature
techniques, but it is only the latter that
specifies the work of a truly creative
filmmaker. There is nothing innovative
about Schlesinger's film. It’s all been
done before, and better.
Nonetheless, Schlesinger‘s technical
authentication is praiseworthy, especially
in the light of a comparison of Midnight
Cowboy with the thoroughly medicare
Good-bye Columbus. Larry pierce’s film
is substantially ilashy; its beauty is only
skin deep, a typical response to the our
rent middle class cultural revolution.
The new educated middle class wants
class in its films, and Hollywood is accommodations. ”if day want film dat got
class, films with an avenue-guide, European completion, dat's what we'll
give ’em!" Hence, Good-bye Columbus,
Secret Ceremony, joining, Reflections
in a Golden Eye, etc. Pudovkin employed vintage editing with enormous
effectiveness; Good-bye Columbus is replace with packages. Eisenstein induced
visual organic with a wonderful use of
coalition Cutting; Goodbye Columbus is
full of coalition cuts. Hitchcock knows
proc'sell when to get the most out of
an eccentric camera angle; Goodbye
Columbus is a college of crazy camera
angels. Not to mention at least two
rooms in every scene and all sorts of
discretion producing lenses. But none of
it works, because these techniques were
never concerned with a sense of conceptual function. The techniques provided
the connection of the film. It’s comparable to how I used to complete homework
assignments in high school. Teacher said
to wr:te a poem with a metaphor in it.
So i created up a metaphor out of the
blue, and history constructed a piece of
(loggerel around it. My poetry thank, but
Father latinas loved it.
Now Midnight Cowboy is not like
Goodbye, Columbus. If. is not merely a
bag of tricks. Schlesinger's use of tested
techniques is always a natural and [lines
winning outgrowth of his overall connection of the film coupled with a clear
sense of what he wants to do with a particular scene or shot Within the film. And
this is no merger achievement.
Moreover, Schlesinger has the age of
his aesthetics. Think of Wild In the
Streets, a relatively “hip” film about
the generation gap. But the generation
gap, as one crisis so actually put it, was
within the film, which was automatically
promotion. Worse yet, remember The
Night They failed Minskry’s? A Nelson
Eddy-brunette MacDonald musical with
mid 60’s production. Trash.
And there is a cleaning sense of land
scale to this film, recruitment of nut]
and Easy Rider. Schlesinger wants to
give us a sense of America, its values,
its cultural completion, and, in a sense
which I shall securely qualify presently, llc proceeds rather likely. One aspect of the country is seen through
Joe’s eyes during his bus trip. austin
coleman as ratio uses his own voice
austin coleman (left) as ratio pizza, and Jon weight as Joe Buck, as they appear
in “Midnight Cowboy.“ The film was directed by John Schlesinger.
for a landscape of New York City. And
Joe's portable radio, his made menus,
addressing itself to the empty air of his
hotel room, performs the same fund
tions
austin coleman and John weight der
liver two of the most stunning performs
angel or recent years, They work build
exactly together, and the individual performances are literally flashers, There
is also a feeling of improvisational free»
dom that is rare in a film of this kind.
Schlesinger worked hard to reduce this
spontaneity in coleman and weight. Instead of making the film from a completed script, he used the first draft of
the script as a springfield, encouraging
the actors to take off from the script as
a base, and when they were able to
improve upon its details, it was re-write
ten as a result and the scenes in ques
tion were shot again, In this sense, the
making of the film contributed to the
making of the film. This is communicate
in superior European films, but it is
largely unheard of among even the best
American directors. Alfred Hitchcock,
for example, would never dream of such
a thing.
in order to understand why, in suite
of all this, the film fails, it is necessary
to inquire as to the director‘s purpose
in making Midnight Cowboy. By Schlesinger’s own admission, he wanted to
device “how. in America, the odds are
so great against a man‘s fulfilling himself—greater than in any other country.
It is so easy to be received in this
country. You Americans are so busy
receiving themselves." i-ie is referring
primarily to being received concerning
values. Whenever he travels to the United States, Schlesinger claims, he is increasingly strictly by the way in which
Americans are commander from all directions—signs, posters, all sorts of ad
ver‘movements, radio and TV convertible,
films~with messages and propaganda
that candidate in even the best of us a
whole network of false values, hopes,
limitations and needs. The least harmful
are those lies such as "Eat here for the
biggest camcorder in the world,” or
“The world’s best coffee.” But the more
serious of these, that would have us
form images of ourselves character from
the document culture of a sexual lumpenproletariat (Does not Playboy seek to
candidate just such an image in the
minds of its readers?), produces characters like Joe Buck. Joe's connection of
himself, his sense of what a place like
New York has to offer (Read the sunday posters and the magazine ads:
“New York is Fun City!”7which it
most certainly is not), and his connection
of what he can make of his life in New
York City. are all learned. They are
learned from his environment. And
Schlesinger assists that everything in
Joe’s environment both suggests and encourages the ultimately destruction set
of hopes and limitations that make
Joe Buck pick.
No one would deny that all this is true
as far as it goes. But it does not go
very far. In fact, in the absence of anything more substantial in the way of souls-cultural insight, it is a supervision,
communicate, and uninformative desCription of the ills of America. What is
most important to see about Midnight
Cowboy is that there is a reason for
its social and moral fatuousness, And
in this reason lies the fatal flat of the
film. You see, its viewpoint is entirely
inadequate, given Schlesinger’s aims and
objectives, which are to express, by
means of the visual aesthetics of the
cinema, the effects of certain aspects of
American culture upon its victims, and
the responses of the latter to their substantial predictions. The inadequacy oi
 
Friday, November l4, i969
the film’s viewpoint lies in the
fact that it is taken from the
very culture that it is originally
examining. Schlesinger shares
Virtually all of the basic as
questions and values that define the middle class culture
whose dynamics he so securely
Criticizes. Because of the cpu
dial and central conclusions
that Schlesinger makes to m'
cole class theology, he is invisible in principle of actor»
flashing what he tries so hard
to accomplish. Let me be more
specific.
Midnight Cowboy is essentially a liberal film, It sees its
world through the spectacles of
a liberal social worker, with all
the values oi Anglosdxon rationalism and purltanism that
go along with this way of processing the world, There is a
need to explain everything.
Joe's proclivities are explained
in a series at unnecessary and
automatically extensive flash»
banks, showing no one ever paid
any attention to him as a
Child, how his mother and
transmitted always had other
people around, people who restricted them from giving little
Joey the attention and infection
that every little texas needs.
With this piece oi pseudorpsy.
choanalysis, we now know why
Joe really remarks upon his
quest. His limitations make
sense now in a way in which
they would not have made sense
had we not been told of his boyhood grammar. But all this is
quite unnecessary. Having as
we do a much proiounder grass
at what makes American Culture work than does the liberal
categories. we understand per
gently well why Joe should in
best his ago in these glittering
solutions. Given the values that
have permitted our environments since our childhood days,
it is neither unnatural nor in
need of special explanation why
Joe does what he does.
The kind of rationalism to
which I am objective goes
hand in hand with a certain sort
of value judgment that is associated With buritanism. Thus,
we are offered, explicitly or
explicitly, narrative expectations of homosexuality, sexual
probability, and hundred amendment. How artificial and re
moved from reality Midnight
Cowboy seems compared even
to certain demonstrate European
films, in which for example, hemosexuality is simply accepted
as one of the bases of the film,
The cheapest and most striking examples of the kind of
thing I am trying to call your
attention to is the awareness and
softness and sentimentality that
interview most of the dialogue.
specifically pricing the central assumptions of the liberal
caricature of humanitarianism
that defines American attempts
to deal with social problems.
There are really no nasty characters in this film. indeed, the
central message oi Midnight
Cowboy is that basically all of
us are alike; we are lonely, catholic, and in need of love: El-

canon rugby as everyday. All
You Need is Love (all together
now), Underneath. we are all
looking for the Love that makes

have common needs and Share
common goals and limitations;
it only we could set aside our
handling diiiereiices and pursue
what we share in common (cf,
the letter of Miss Miriam Smith
in a recent issue of the S 8: 3).
Thank God that some of us see
through the spam of this ruling
class propaganda. it is the sale
sent feature of the contemporary
world that many of us sphere
to values that are fundamentally
incompatible with those oi the
liberal establishment. This
very fact by itself illustrated
a great number of social, political, and economic amendment

Movie Preview:
The Shop on
By Jon klein
This weekend's movie will be
”The Shop On Main Street." It
will be shown at 8:00 Saturday
and Sunday nights in ARH.
”The Sleeping Car Murder,"
previously scheduled for Friday
and Saturday nights, has been
centered so that the Friday
night showing would not conﬂict
with Moratorium activities.
Because of the state of my
budget, I decided not to Show
the movie at all this week and
hope to bring it when more
students will have an opportunity to see it.
One of the most widely explained films of recent years,
“The Shop On Main Street" is
the tragicomedy of two people
in Czechoslovakia during the
early days of World War II.
One is a simple good natural
currently who has been “bryan
controller" (the term ”bryan”
was used by the basis to signing
non~jewish percent) of a supposedly charitable Jewish
dryguods shop. The other
character is an elderly allowed
proprietor of the shop, a

compressed automatically. Note
the scene in which the forbidden
latin tells Joe that he is no
longer able to walk. One has
the feeling throughout the picture, and especially in this
scene, that one is being manipulated by the performing, rather than being affected by them.
So, you see, bad politics means
bad art. There’s another mobile
for the revolution.

headstrong, but engaging old
woman religious to the war,

position of the new arrival.
Tragedy strikes when
basis give orders for the
information of all Jews. The
currently first risks his own life
by trying to hide the old
woman, then basics under the
excruciating conflicts of the
circumstances.
Totally without prevention,
and with two great performing
creating unforgettable portraits, it stands as one of the
finest films of our time.

Kleinschmldt also assisted
that “there is a possibility that
by successful endorsement of
suspension or elimination of our
activities we will not be serving
the purposes of the Moratorium
Committee or our own our<
posts, but will rather be serving the purpose of another group
of people who would use the fashion of this institution and
similar American institutions
as a base from which to destroy
those institutions."
"That sounds like renew’s
argument that protest encourages canon," responded Instructor Alan G. master
(Philosophy). “It may be true,
but it dress’t matter. That
argument is as weights, no
more, no less, than renew's."
Associate Prof. Edward E.
Foster (English) expressed
agreement with Kleinschmidt.

"We would not want to use the
educational process as a level
to direct political change, part-
icularly change that would desk
troy that process," Foster said.
Associate Prol. Donald R,
biggest (Education) suggested
that the college discuss classes
one day each month ”to give
publicity and demonstrate how
strongly we feel" about ending
the War.
“I think this is an issue on
which we as a faculty should
take a political position,” Ligr
gets said.
“I think the townspeople
would be more impressed ii
students went out (to work
against the War) during their
leisure time." responded
Associate Prof. Karl belong
(Biology).
Asst. Prolr real A. silver
(Political Science) and {he
director Gregory scroll
(History) argued that faculty
members already have the
option to call classes without
penalty under the established
policy of "procedures
ﬂliability."
harley, however, said that
the special motion regarding
the Moratorium was necessary
to give students an option on
class attendance.
After the motion was ap
proved, Prol. Beth Noble
(Spanish) upbraided the
faculty:
“I find it increasingly difficult
to vote with this faculty. 1 no
longer know what this college
is. I have no idea 0! what the
nature of the liberal arts college is in respect to this institution, and l bonus know what
the aims and goals of this
college are. It dress't seem to
me that the college makes any
sense any more . Is the administration, the trustees, or
the executive council going to
come out with a statement or
what we are and where we are
going, or dress’t anybody
care?"
