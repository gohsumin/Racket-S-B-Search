Plan to build
New territory
By BENSON SMITH
A proposal to build a new
directory on South campus has
been shelter, according to
Dean Alice Low. Plans for the
building were approved two
years ago «by the Board of
Trustees and a studanaculty
committee, but the directory,
which would have houses 150
students, Will not he built.
Mrs. Low said that when she
came to Grinnell plans for a
directory had already been
completed but were not acceptable to the Board pi Trustees. Under her direction, new
plans were designed and subsequently approved.
when. questioned about the
need for the new building, Mrs.
Low arrested overcrowding,
which she maintains still exists
this year. The form had been
planned on the basis of a projection of the college's future
needs. The data for the projection was collected in a room-byroom study conducted two
years ago. Mrs. Low said that
the projection was not based on
any plan to increase enrollment
and that use of all present
directories would have continued. She also claimed that
with the new directory, more
students would be able to take
advantage of the ati»campus
living option.
Mrs. Low did not explain how
more students would have been
able to live oil-campus. Last

and numerous other meetings
which often seem to have no
real significance, one fact is not
submitted in the bureaucratic
"democracy” here at Grinnell.
student power still remains the
only logical means to bring
about the needed changes at
Grinnell.
As arbitration increases with
the present rules, student government continues to act as a
safety valve for students who
are interested in changing the
present rules. while lemon—

has the task of seeing that demands are neither reflected
nor deleted.
Student government at Grinnell continues to focus students’ attention on needed
changes, yet the failures of this
Institution are obvious. The
Senate, for example, represents
\he views of a particular part
of the student body rather than
the campus as a whole. One

The Administration’s predictions
Because of its past policies the administration of
Grinnell College is in a position where it is going to
have to yield to students’ demands for a change of
rules.
In the past, the administration has said that
one of the reasons the college did not change its
rules was that it preferred not to act before other
colleges. Grinnell chose not to be a leader in the
general laxity in rules that accompanied the wide
acceptance of the “new mobility.” Rather, it chose
the safer policy of waiting to see what happened to
the innovation, and then to change slowly and by
degrees.
Other colleges in our own conference have related their rules with respect to open directories.
Grinnell, in accordance with its “keep up with the
courses" policy, will probably change its rules, too.
Now the administration is not so obtuse as those
students mentioned in last week’s editorial,
Ex Post facts Philosophy. They are not so simple
as to think that they can change the rules and then
adopt a philosophical stand which certified the
change. They will want to change their philosophy
beforehand, or seek some provision in their old one,
a sort of loophole, which will enable them to change
in a way least managing to them. The administration has such a loophole, and there have been medications that they will take advantage of it.
The revision in the residence hall system is the
perfect time to review the old rules. You see, the
old rules might not be valid under new circumstances Hence a thoughtful discussion of the rules
is in order.
It is clear that there are only two stands the
administration can otherwise take. The one is to act
in accordance with what are probably its true
beliefs, it could refuse to change the rules on account of the underlying moral reasons. If the administration, however, choices to act in this way,
if the president choices to see that all the rules are
informed and that the rules remain as they are, he
will probably cause the same sort of discipline activities that occurred at Columbia and forced the
shutdown of that institution, An administration
simply cannon function unless it has the support of
the majority of the students and members of the
community.
The administration could refuse to take any
form of action, to let things fall where they may.
They might capitulate as completely as o t h e 1‘
schools have done. This, however, would not be a‘
{way renewable way to go about solving the proc-
em.
So probably the best the administration can do
is to undergo this period of review, to justify a
change of rules because of the revision in hall living, and thus to capitulate subtle to the demands of
the students.
Now the student government ought to take note
of the administration’s predictions. They ought to
realize that if they now go through channels, they
would be likely to obtain a large helping of what
they want, The administration Will suspended, if it
can do so generally. To force a configuration on it
will force it to take a store stands
If the student government acts with caution
and fact, they may win. If they act exclusively and
try to force a configuration, they may lose.
Resident Advisor
Rebuke: Problems
To the Editor:
I know lt's a bit early to
make sleeping congratulations
of the kind I am going to make
about Grimell, but as a newcomer whose expectations
about the place have rather
fallen short, I feel completed
to speak.
First, this campus boxes the
hell out of me. Compared to
computer I've been on during
the past three years (Northwestern and Yale), the Intellectual excitement and percent
here is almost nil. The sell job
I got before I came was largely based on how intense, bright,
and scintillating all these still
cents were going to be. Yet I
must say that after nearly six
weeks here i have yet to hear
anyone talk spontaneously about
what he is reading, either in
class or out, let alone talk about
his classes. I have yet to hear
any passionate discussion or
race, politics, religion, art, eco<
comics, transcripts, or comic
strips. In fact I have yet to
hear any passionate discussion
of anything but the opens “issue", which is little more than
narcissism in its worst form
coupled with is children exhibitionism (e.g., destinations of
home rule and publicized constitution), Whatever intensity exists here is certainly not academic, though there may be a
great deal of international intensity. (I will admit that there
is a fair amount of booking going on and I am not at all talking about those people who
haven't emerald from the
stocks for six weeks and have
developed a kind of synthetic
relationship with their barrel.
Obviously, these people cannon
make the campus a more exciting place. vcr a person to
be so designated by what he
reads that he can never fear
himself away from it seems to
me to be a contamination in
terms.)
The only issue-oriented activity on the campus which
reaches to all members of the
community is the Pterodactyl.
Here I will have to admit that
despite all its sexual hanging
and worn-out New Left marriage, the Pierudaiclyl l5 passionate. Despite all its misdirected
historic about Administration.
Establishment, and other iabrlcated targets, it is gmss, free.
opinionated, and lifetime:
funny.
I did mention international
intensity. The security of the
physical campus obscures what
seems to be a permanent and
various identity crisis in the
lives'oi many students. There
is a great amount of introspection and discussion of personal
problems here, either in ,one’s
own o‘ique or with one's friend.
But this verballzing of personal
problems seems to go on ad
infinitum ad nauseam. A various dynamic develops which
cannon offer its own solution. I
am certainly not opposed to
talking out problems. Only the
Catholic Church can deny conversion. Many times I need to
talk out problems and do so (to
wit, this letters). But it also
seems that one way to meet
(albert not solve) an identity
crisis is to get out of himself,
to turn attention forward. I am
not saying do not take yourself
seriously, but I am saying try
to take your world a little more
seriously. Yours are root the
only problems that need to be
solved; in solving others’ problems you unwittingly may solve
a few of your own.
Second, 1 don’t know why the
campus should be so boring. A
son of surface explanation is
the homogeneity and influence
of the student body, which his
ways makes for a boring come
donation. There are too many
“great kids” here and not
enough “books," The lack of
real diversity in the student
body is definitely a contributing factor. garden the sun, but
well-founded persons are terms
by definition. The curriculum is
another factor. There is more
room for instrumentation, especially in interdisciplinary

Describes Policy
To the Edllon
We feel that we must clarity
the Langan Hall policy on 24
honor forms. As was stated in
last week's sea, our policy is
based on consideration. This
term is often used, but seldom
understood or after upon in a
mature way. In previous years,
hall officials strictly informed
or ignored the rule, but did
little further discussion on the
difficulties of donations living
particularly concerning the limitation issue, We feel that our
policy is proceeding through
weekly discussions of the problems of directory living, a
weekly dinner series with faculty members, use of hall funds
for informal social events, floor
meetings, a helpful and honest
resident advisor, and an atmosphere of concern for who individual in his relation to the
college community.
We established this policy of
an open directory not as an
action of configuration, but in
the belief that the value of a
college education lies not only
in the classroom, but also outside the classroom in the levels
opmcnt of mature, responsible
individuals as they live at college. The casual social atmosphere, which has in part required from our policy, is a step
toward developing the individu-
al who makes decisions ol
knowledge and concern rather
than decisions based on feel
pressure, poor information, DI
facility.
We would be happy to dishes:
the living situation in manual
with anyone.

To the Edltol-x
Since Mr, Lawrence Franll
used his power to render ml
silent the other day, I am writing to the SM; as a way of ha:
ing allowed to express my
view. Mr. Frank, in president
over the open hearing on the
case of Richard Schnelrov’l
massive application, apparently,
thinks that the wages paid by
the college to class workers in
permanent to the case but that
the moral and intellectual chat
actor of the defendant is not.
His ruling was only one sign of
many displayed yesterda,
showing that students are n
at present able to modern themselves, though they are able to

Now the college boards n 10-!

it is necessary, however, to
turn the figure around as wells
Every teacher is outnumbere

ranks by adding those allied of

of those large universities
where the "vocational revolution" breaks out first. Quit!
clearly the biological and sociological fact of mere, raw name
here is the origin of the prev<
out struggle for power. Mn.
Schneirov certified his action
solely in these terms: students
have the power to make their
own rules and therefore they
have the right. Some 2300 year!
ago operates showed two
breaks, both allocated of rail
theory that might makes right,
that they were wrong; but truth
is powerless against vocational
power. As Milton said, truth
will always win in a fail- fight,
but Mr. Schneirov and his comp
rates do not, of course, fight
fair.
Let us examine the basic alignment advanced by Mr,
Schneirov and his supportersi]
it runs as follows; the present
law governing open forms is
unenforceable; it is unenforceable because it is being dish

which is used whenever any

admitted to me, after the

(Continued from Page A)
hearing, that neither poverty
nor rational discounts served
his purposes. Well, let’s apply
his theory to cases other than
that of application in the calls,
Now daily we read of bank
countries, car cheats, sexual
crimes against small children.
There are laws programming such
acts —- but by Mr. Schneirov’s
reasoning, these laws are "illegal” because the crimes are
committed. We simply do not
succeed either in iorestaliing
crimes nor in representing the
chemicals after the act, and our
failure is clearly a sign of the
lllegality or our law. One would
think that any 12 year old
child could see through Mr.
Schneirov's argument: but the
Grinnell students who support
ed Miss Bonnie winter’s demagogic appeal yesterday — read
in a voice so low that most of
us could not hear it, though
she came through loud and
clear on the request for a
show of hands -— these students, I submit, showed that
they lack even the intelligence
or a twelve year old. Sam
Goldwyn seems to have been
right in pending the national
level of intelligence at that
age.
I have called the SchnelrovTinker appeal for a vote from
the audience demagogic, and I
am willing to support that
term. First, the procedure was
s “hearing,” and a hearing is
not a place for s vote of any
kind. Several years ago Steve
Kent calculated three different
positions to students, worked
in varying degrees of strength.
Then Kent added all the signatures ,to the most currently
worked petition and claimed a
mandate for his famous sleepln. There was demagoguery,
and discovery cancellation,
worse than staffing ballot
boxes. Miss winter’s attempt
to indicate job rule is even
more reprehensible than Kent's
behavior. She held out before
her jury of children the candy;
sweet reputation of power and
sex; what chance would the
doctor on trial yesterday —- the
faculty — have in a case like
that. For I submit that yesterday's hearing was not a trial
of Richard Schneirov for forum<
rating but a trial of the faculty
for not teaching. Too many faculty members are like doctors
who subscribe candy.
Now sex and power are ready
study, and students appeared to
in these terms may really think
that they are voting and that
they have and are everything
powers What they do not see is
that they are being manipulated. When the dust of the
revolution is over, they will
find that they have a new set
of masters, and one far worse
than the gambling minerals who
now given them. Mr. Schneir—
ov has demonstrated, by his
language and actions — the two
means we have for lodging
men — that he is not to be
trusted: we find in him that
characters it: of the liar known
as evasiveness and that characteristic of the toward known as
intellectual dishonesty.
Though I don't think it will
do much good — since Mr.
Schneirov, like Mr, simon, is
way ahead in the public opinion polls -— I should like to take
this chance to challenge Mr.
Schneirov, and any of his
friends who care to take part,
to a public dialogue, each party
having equal time to ask ques<
tions which the other must
either answer truthfully or de<
clone to answer.
Let me add that I am writing this before the court's decision ls made public. It is quite
clear that the court's decision,
unless it is "not‘guilty," will be
irrelevant, for ML Schneirov
has stated publicly that any
other service will be unacceptable to him. The wide support given his william demagoguery makes the court’s action a society. Power is in
the middle; God help the poor
industrial truth.

Wallace Ad intended
To the Editor:
In her letter about why the
5&3 should not have printed
the Wallace ad, Kit order
seems to have missed the point
completely. Freedom of speech
is very much the issue on this
question —— the content of the
ad is not our concern.
The ad was prepared by Wa1<
lace people as part of a nationwide advertising campaign
directed at college computer.
Its purpose, like almost all political advertising, was to get
as many votes as possible for
the Candidate, It was Wallace's
decision that this style of ad,
which like most political advertising decided most of the issues, would get the most votes
for Wallace from the college
community. If a college newspaper choices to carry any po«
optical advertising, it then has
the obligation to accept all p0<
optical advertisiing. To do otherwise would be to engage in selective membership of political
views.
it every newspaper followed
its editorial policy in accepting
advertising (many papers in
the South do this in fact) we
would not have seen McCarthy
ads in most papers and we
would not see ads to stop the
booking of North Vietnam,
sponsored by long lists of college processors, which regulatory appear in the New York
Times.
One could of course say that
Wallace is a racing, fastest, unexpected, structured slow and
that he dress't merit serious attention. But that would mean
s line will have to be drawn
between “good" and “bad"
and, as in every membership
question, this is impossible to
do in the context of freedom
of thought
If there is anywhere in society
that freedom or thought and
action must be deferred, it is
on the college campus.

POST

By JOHN GORDLEY
For the interest of anyone
who has not yet been informed,
the first session of a Team of
Four tournament has taken
place in the Forum. In this type
or competition, one partner»
ship site North-South while
its templates play the same
hands East-West. Scoring is
done in IMF: (International
Match Points), in which the
number received is based on
the difference in score of a
team and its opponents on
each deal, Thus emphasis is
placed on the discrepancy in
score, as in contract bridge,
rather than on the number of
opponents outscored, as in duplicate. Team of Four matches
have the added advantage of
impartiality, because the big
hands held by one partnership
must be deferred against by
its templates.
The following hand was played in seven clubs, six hearts,
six clubs, and in three no trust
at different tables.

In the club contract, the distribution in hearts and the position of the Queen are declared’s only problems. But even it
the Queen and the three are off-v
side, the hand is cold if two
hearts are rolled, setting up
the six and two on the board.
In actual play, seven clubs

made seven, six hearts made,
and three no trust made seven. If the grand spam had been
successful, the difference with
the opposite no trust score
would have been 920 points, or
14 IMP'S. The Set gave the opponents a total score of 820
points, or 13 IMP's, a very

between the teams, The other

For two weeks the girls’ field

the way most people around
here get in shape) preparing
for the match with cleveland

two weeks of skills and scrimmages (attended by the people
who need them least) have
highlighted the typical Grinneli attitude toward sports
(etc?).
A person who could actually
enjoy working, suffering to improve himself, who could aincerely be interested in helping
others reach this goal with him,
must really be screens ups
Doesn't he know life is a joke
where you try to get away with
all you can, remembering that
it's a lot easier for one to slip
through a hole in the fence than
two. Why, when you can rationalize that getting through the
fence is just a park anyway,
then you don‘t even have to feel
inadequate or a failure, if you
don't make it through (pretty
safe!)
Well, when half a hockey
team (troops "interest

necessary for caring, they are
slowly investing the poison that

'minutes the Pioneers, worn by
nearly 180 minutes of soccer in
two days, were outdistanced as
the Hawkeycs scored a goal to
capture the victory.

Tomorrow the Pioneers host
Carleton in their final home
stand of the season. Coach
Hemingway expects a tough
game. Carleton is strong on
passing, but he feels his PIDv
needs have consistently shown
fine team work and with minimum injuries and a little rest
they will be ready.

To Lead League
By REGGIE GRAHAM
simon granted the number
one spot in the conference last
Saturday. after heating the bio<
needs 41-14, they became the
only team to coast an undo<
tested, united record. (Cornell
was detected by plymouth.)
Considering these facts (and
adding a bit of optimize), careful analysis of the statistics
show that our team didn’t do
nearly as badly as the final
score indicated. In the first
half, we made nine first towns
to their three. By removing just
three plays (hreakaways for
over seventh yards each), the
pushing and passing garbage
statistics an! equal. of course,
we can’t merely reflect those
three bad defensive plays, but
considering t h e m separately
does help explain why Coach
powers called our effort “the
best game we've played.”
The offensive line finally got
going in this game and gave
not only pass protection but also
was able to “fire out" and
open holes for ground garbage
(145 yards). key Lewis, Brian
Barnes, and Jon russell all
looked good carrying the ball.
Brian played his best game so
for both effectively and offer<
likely, and Jon, as well 54 fi-
rally getting some chances ta
carry the ball, made quite a
few key blocks. Gary Jones did
a good job matching some im.
contact passes for critical first
towns, as well as pulling in a
twenty-seven yard touchdown
pass from Gary Johnson. Tom
Lower, who played n great
game, caught Johnson's other
touchdown pass (seven yards).
The most serious problems
we had all day were the in.
series (which could also be a
factor tomorrow), The most
popular injury of the day
seemed to center around the
trees—of the five received, Al
Clouds is the most serious. He
will be out for at least a couple
of weeks. There are also ruimots of bad reserve calls
(mainly led by Steve buildings,
who was thrown out before maritime).
The most encouraging appeal
of the whole game was that the
Pioneers finally began to work'
together as a team There were
still quite a few mistakes, but
we seem to ba reading (we
didn't lose any fumblesl). Tomorrow we play a team the!
has ti record similar to but
Knox will be tough, but If Iaal
week can be seen as an indication of progress, we could win
