We call your attention to the article on the next page:
0 this issue which deals with the possible switch by cam—l
put radio station KGRW from All to FM‘ broadcasting.
We entirely support such a change
Critiscism ol' ”KG” has raised l1ea1fly upon the shall~1
(less of station managers throughout its history. Among
the plants are these: that it is often impossible to bring‘i
in programs because of electrical interference or because‘
'of mechanical failure at the station; that the station is an
expensive hanging for jazz ai'ficiandoes 1those“cool” chair
tel and Far out fare find few listening;
on campus don't have time to listen to the radio anchor.
A switch to PM would eliminate the first beef almorst entirely Such a change would allow the station to broadcast
sponsor signals 7 signals even strong enough to be pick-1
ezl up in the now “KG- less" addresses. l
According to Manager Porter, true high facility sound
could be transmitted within a 10-while radius. Such improv
ed quality and range would be an investment to the campus musical and drama departments to present radio con»l
cents and plays ,¥ thus helping to wider the variety of
programs, a task already undertaken with some success by
Porter.
And, in answer to the third criticism, we think with
the good programming and fine mechanical quality which
17M would allow, more people would find time to listen.
Of course we re; ice that FM reception requires a different type of receiver than the traditional AM varietyl
But FM receivers are no more expensive than the other
type. Many students have FM receivers now and are enjoying the excellent commercial-free programs available one
e tions in Des points and other cities.
e think the investments 7 $7500 (ma cum) by
tie college and individual investment ill FM 1active1's ’7‘
\rolled be well worth the money
And for those who don't wish to buy an FM set, we;
offer a suggestion made in our office the other day. Why
not present afterwards of selected music in Roberts theater? fixed through the wonderful sterophonic sound sys
