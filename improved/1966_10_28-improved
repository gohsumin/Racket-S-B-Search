On Fifth Year Program
Grinnellian Reports from Thailand
Ed. Note: The following report is by funny perform,
’65, who is presently teaching
English in Chiengmal, Than
land. she is a participant In
the Grlnneil fifth-year abroad
program.
I guess first in better throw
in some of the facts about my
job~here which i found rather
inaccessible when trying to discover what the program inVolved.
As i am doing. most of the
Grinnellians who come to Thailand with the Fifth Year
Abroad Program have taught in
Chiengmai, This is the second
(but by fat the second) largest
city in Thailand and is about
you miles north of Bangkok.
Some of us have taught at
Prince Royal's College (primarily a boys’ school except for the
last two years of high school)
and some have taught here at
para Academy (girls' school).
Both of these schools include
students from kindergarten age
through high school. para has
about 1,700 students. About 90
of these girls live on campus
in a form.
Both Prince Royal's and para
are mission schools — original»
1y begun by the presentations
but now under the Church of
Christ in Thailand. This naturally puts us closer to the American religious society here than
to the American military society
(which is increasing rapidly).
But there is not a great pressure toward any kind of religious activity although I can
imagine that someone who actively and lovely disorders
with the Christian religion
would find it difficult to Work
within the framework of the
school.
what I am trying to say is
that there has been trouble I.“
the past with the religious connections (or lack of) of some
Grinnell volunteers. Many or
the restrictions (such as required chapel) have not been
listed, but anyone who comes
must be aware that to work
with people most effectively
in this framework, there will
have to he at least a tolerance of such things as prayers at teachers' meeting, etc.
Beyond that nothing is re.
quoted.
As a Grinneil volunteer you
would probably live on campus,
either in a house with other
Thai teachers or perhaps in the.
form with teachers and std4
cents. i am living in a room
above the'l-home Ec room. 0n
the same floor are about four
other Thai teachers, airline
seeker, another Grinnellian, and
assisted others. The room demands me very much of a room
I had at camp other So, come
with the idea that you won’t
be living in luxury out not with
the idea that you will be living
in the winds of the jungle — as
I admit I had pictures at
times. Meals can be either Thai
or foreign — both of which are
provided at the school. The
Thai food is prepared in the
norm, the foreign food at the
home oi a dictionary who lives
on campus.
I am teaching English only 14
hours a week (15 is the normal
load) but will be teaching 18
hours when car leaves in No

SCARLET AND BLACK
 
Editorial .
Last week’s editorial pointed to the need for a "context of understanding” on the part of the alumni and parents toward the Grinnell educational experience.
One means of providing such a context is wholly
packing: that is a high quality geological alumni publication which acts as more than a class newsletter.
The present Alumni charles and Black needs to
be scrapped in favor of a publication, preference a
“click" let-monthly, which would offer not only alumni
news but would tell in words and pictures something
about the ongoing changes in Grinnell life.
Articles by faculty about their own research and
work as well as articles about all phases of student life
would be appropriate for inclusion.
Must colleges of Grinuell’s statute have such a notification, though hopefully Grinnell could improve on the
quality of the vast majority of these.
The need for such a publication seems apparent to
the administration, but showtimes of money and time
have so far held up concrete steps toward its replication.
From this viewpoint it looks as though we’ve started long
enough. As each issue of the AS&B roses itself in innocu<
our announcements, another opportunity is lost for improving the “context of understanding” and consequently
the college‘s support in the outside world.

By JAMES KISSANE, English
Three Ugly Years, by L. K.
canyon.
Like most Grimellians who
never checked it with professor ericsson, l have always re—
garden St. Olaf as the trained
and bloom Nordic Frau among
our sister colleges, high—linked
enough for anything but like as
not a touch on the stodgy side.
So I was surprised and obvious
to discover that Notthiield’s
other campus has scanned a
really corporate piece of college
humor.
I can understand that on this
particular subject no one is in a
harry tn take a college professor’s word for it. and I felt the
same way when as dean of men
(of all people) posted me on to
this collection of campus cartoons. But Thompson was right;
Three Ugly Years, by 1.. K.
canyon, for three years the
state cartoonist on the St. Olaf
student newspaper, captured in
its “highly lines and squiggly
letters" a very funny and generally distinction climate oi the
college scene.
During his ugly years at Olaf,
canyon must have made that
faculty forget all about carrying up the misspellings, statistical utilities, and expenses
against logic and human desert
cy that appeared in the college
paper. The “Uglies.” as the
comic strips collected in the
book are called, run the full
games of campus situations -—
from the corporations of peace
partners to the incoming of
clean speakers and the living
death of the Studentrlaculty coffee hour — without striking a
Single false note. Even the refs
erellces to surely local preoccupations only weighted the
authenticity and bite of canyon’s comic portraits. It is the
drawing, however, that makes
the wilderness and the accuracy oi the “Uglies” well into
a grand piece of campus nature.
canyon’s pictures are about as
promotion as virgin Partch’s or
rules neither’s, and his art' pic install is even more at a Virtue than theory. These publicity
awful drawings are the perfect
vehicle for expression the
chubby and extravagant disenchautment that makes the
"Uglies" so enchxnu'reg.
canyon's cartoons don’t give,
it hardly need be said, a public
relations man‘s view or college
life: but somebody at St. Olaf
knew what he was doing to see
to it that so fresh and many a
documentation of irreverence and
wit was called to people‘s at:
mention. Some years ago a student Showed me what supported
to be a reproduction of Alan
Jones' blackberry illustrations
through an entire history
course, accompanied by approximately engineering cartoons.
I thought they were terrible funny, and if someone had printed
them up as a hook, Grinnell
might have stolen a march on
St. Olal’s Three llgly Years.
And this takes me to Lha
question why current efforts at
humor on our campus should
be so consistently female or
gauche and why student criticism should be so packing in the
comic spirit. Maybe I just don’t
see the good stud people turn
out, but examples or the opposite kind are not far to seek.
One would get the impression
from last week’s 5&3, for instance, that our idea oi picks
here is to map classics processors and to email away at traditional and largely moribund attitudes now a rd Homecoming
with a sarcasm so input and
heavy handed as to make the
provincial lead balloon seem
like valley’s women by Comparison. I believe it Was John
Dryden who said that a slovenia purchasing is a poor excuse
for nature. What one advised
especially about canyon‘s “ago
lies” is that they do the job‘
with a ﬂair. Paradoxically,
think “humanity” would have to
be the word for the quality that
comes through the spectacular
awareness or the "Uglies"; and
that is exactly what one missed
in the printable, topless camping
that seems our style.
'three Ugly Years convinced
me that St. Olaf must have
more going for it than its own
here of march rows and some
mighty fine hymn fingers. As
for Grinnell, I have not lost
hope that its student culture
will some day serve up something a bit more pendant than
unadulterated animal and usr
leavened angel.
