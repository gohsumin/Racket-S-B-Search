dirty Grinnell students participated in a peace march in

afternoon. The group was joined
by about forty students from

group there.

march were distributed at two
Des points high schools and in
the downtown area.
The march began with a
rally at Riverside park, where
the demonstration were addressed by five speakers. More
than a dozen students from Des
points Technical High School
(one of the letﬂenter schools)
attended the rally. Several of
the students decided, while
others discussed the protest
with demonstration. Most oi the
high school students covered
the war.
During the rally. the Viceprincipal oi Tech arrived and
announced to the high school
students that they were all suspended for cutting classes.
The demonstration walked

about two o‘clock under the

march.
While the demonstration united outside the courthouse, U.S.
partial Charles Eendlage told
the group turning in their sales—
time service conventions that he
was not authorized to accept
the cards. The cards were
placed on the office counter and
the students left.
Alter the departure oi the
students, the cards were turned
over to assistant us. attorney
Jerry Williams. Neither he nor
Bendlage had any comment as
to the disposition of the material, although it was believed
that the cards would be turned
over to the F.B.l, who would
notify state draft boards and
the selective service ofﬁce in
Washington.
 
 
The demonstration w a l k e d
through downtown Des points
to Tech High School, to protest
the suspension ol the students
at the rally. it was reported
later that the Students would
not. be suspended, but would be
given detection for classes
missed, the usual penalty for
cutting.
When high school students
left the building at 3:30 pm.
they were controlled with posters and learners opposite the
war. The issue of their fellow
students who had cut classes
was confused by lack of inform
mating and the liability oi the
demonstration to communicate
with the students as fast as
they implied from the high
school.
In the handling and shooting
that followed, several posters
and learners were set on ﬁre
by high school students.
After most of the students
had left the building, and the
crowd diminished in size, several demonstration were able
to have quiet discussions smith
Tech students. The demonstration reported about tour

During the entire altemoan
there were no incidents or artists.

GRILL ELEVEN ON WATCHED POT
POLICE QUESTION STUDENTS
ON CAMPUS DRUG USE
Eleven Grinnell students received a volt Wednesday afternoon when they were questioned
by the local police concerning
drug usage.
At least fifteen students were
"iniormally asked to come down
and answer questions," the Student Senate was told at a regular meeting in ARH Wednesday
night.
Eleven were questioned, according tD Police Chief Bill meters.
“Today about 2 p.m. we started having Grinnell students take
en down to the local police and
questioned about drug usage.”
Student Government Association president pic MacDowell
told the Senate.
MacDoWell said that these
persons were “apparently suspected oi being regular man'jeans users." He added that the
local police merely warned
them and said that ”this is being done by the city. not the
State or Federal Government."
Chief meters said he “just
called down a now people to tell
them there had better not be
any people smoking marijuana
on the Grinnell campus.“ He
added that he read the law concerning marijuana to the eleven
be questioned.
Students who said they were
interpreted by the Grinnell
police told the 5&8 that. they
were asked it they smoke mark—
jeans. it they knew at other
“users." and if they knew who
was selling “put" on campus.
They were then controlled

mostly middle-aged townspeople
and little kids, came out to be

cheerleading squad. It has been
said that you shouldn't bring
your high school days with you
to Grinnell and that’s true.
Every high school basketball
game ever seen by this reporter had at least a quarter
of the student body present.
At Grinnell, if you can like

with something or other concerning themselves that very

how bad the teams are, why
not help them do something for

Asked where he got the list.
Chief meters told the 581B: “A
bird gave it to me." He refused to name the individuals
on the list.
“We are here to keep people
out of trouble," meters said,
“but if we’re pushed there’s
going to be a lot of trouble.”
meters added that the students
he questioned did not seem
“particularly impressed.”
Dean Thompson told the 5&5
late Wednesday that he had
not scheduled meetings With
either the police or with any
of the students involved, but
added ”I suppose I’ll be hearing

MacDowell told the senators
that the college was not “a guardian" when it came to drugs.
“The college cannon protect
you.” he said.
“If you know people on the
outskirts OI the drug traffic
scene at Grinnell," MacDolyeIl
told the representatives or the
student government. “please tell
 
them to keep quiet. This Is the
kind of thing that could lead
to Search and arrest on various.”
humor and appreciation was
widespread Thursday as SGA
members and students discussed
the possibility oi narrative
agents being on campus.
By noon Thursday seven
“concerned individuals" had
called the 5&3 offices. most of
them seeking to ”play down
drugs here and cool it.”
One of the gallery wanted
information as to whether students had a right to refuse to
answer questions when interpreted by the police.
