pmid one or two peers and a great deal of applause,
the Latin American Conference came to a close last Week.
peers from those few with eyes that are always “looking,
for something" who thought that the Conference was too
one—sides, applause from those of us who found the four
exciting days of discussion most interesting and informative.
The Conference as We see it, was not a series of “proCastro” meetings and discussions, Mr. shakira and certainly Mr. Alexander were not here only to advocate a proCastro stand. They presented us with a good deal of in«
formed opinion which was at times complimentary to the
present human regime, and more than occasionally suggested the many difficulties involved in complete acceptance
of the Castro government.
“The revolution in Cuba,” said Alexander, ”goes beyond Cuba and Castro and much, much deeper,"
If the Conference was at all weighted, t was weighted ‘
with clear thinking speakers who were able to back up
their opinions with experience and facts and with speakers
:who were interested in presenting many sides of the ques«
lan.
Furthermore, this conference was not concerned with
Cuba alone, Neither compensation nor panel members re
elected any pro-destination of the conference. If discussion
seemed to turn toward Cuba, it was because the human
problem is a permanent one.
Discussion often rendered back into the human did»
faculty, not through the efforts of the speakers but
through the students themselves; who, as we have suggested before, are becoming more aware of the problems
involved and more interested in learning as much as possible about this “in-the-news" area.
If the eyes that see more than is there and the ears
that hear only What they Want to hear want something
to well wolf about, we might suggest a look into their own
ferry faces. It is not the sort of talk which comes out of
the Latin American Conference but rather their own see»
dial connection of fairy-tale nonsense that reserves closer
scrutiny.

In discussing the new constitution, women said. “No one is
perhaps fully satisfied with il,

students who helped to all-own

not so much of formal conflict-l

women emphasized that llc
constitution is directed toward
the college constantly as a
whole, although specific problems and interests of individual calls and of north and

ignored.
The president went to

next year to the class of ’63

pointed our the fact that “it'
on
 
fun, it “may eventually lead to
proposed change in the educational program of the College."
Such changes would include
a reduction in the emphasis on
grades and individual courses.
and an increase in freedom of
students lo pursue their education independently.
By offering credits to students who successfully pass
the test, it is hoped that they
will be able to reduce their
regular course loud, thus lead»
