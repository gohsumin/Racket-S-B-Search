The moreover at Old oem occurred on October 17, 1968, when
36 black Students and three consultants locked themselves in
the building, They presented the
’ﬁdemonstration with a list of
live demands, which they asked
Cornell's president Samuel
tampa to promise to implement
within 48 hours. The demands
.were that a black activity center be established, that at least
10% of the corporations be presented by black speakers, that
the curriculum be revised to include courses on black history
and culture, that the college
step up hiring of black instructors, and ﬁrally, that no

the most iatvi‘machine reviews

recent years. Since the report

In the Science division, a
modification of the science requirement went into direct this

or ten hours of science before
graduation. Science I is a 4 hour

Meeting Planned
For December ll
An informal discussion among
concerned ia c ulty members
from Grinnell, C08. and Cornell will take place at Grinnell,
December ii. The general topic
for this discussion is the range
of problems which affects indicators at small liberal arts
colleges. Some problems that
may be discussed are student
unless, student treasures, curriculum reform, and social response city.
Mr. butts, along with a faculty member from Cornell, has
organized this gathering. Belts
said that in addition to the
problems affecting the Colleges,
“there is a concern about the
academic development of Such
colleges and the role they might
play in an academic world
serving on change, if not revolution."
“We processors hope to inform one another on these problems and gain some insight into
them. Of course, nothing may

Division Meeting
hourly Attended;

A meeting was called Monday for all Humanities division
processors and junior and senior motors in the division, The
purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the proposal by the
Executive Council regarding
student participation on Educational Policy Committees in
the three divisions. There were
similar meetings in the other
divisions.
About thirty students and
three processors attended the
meeting. According to Dr, Sheldon P. either, chain'can of the
division, those who came
were mainly those who agreed
with the ideas set forth in the
proposal, and they were those
who were interested in working on the Educational Policy
Committee. The discussion.
therefore, centered around the
fiber points of the proposal,
such as the number oi students
on the faculty committee and
the role of those students,
Dr. either felt that the most
significant aspect oi the meeting was the lack of interest. Ho
pointed out that if the same
number of students attended.
the meetings held in the other
divisions, the total number or
seniors and seniors interested
in the educational policies governing their academic interests
would not be more than 100,
The proposal being discussed
concerned the suggestion that
students either participate on
the faculty policy committees or
that they serve on separate student committees. It also in‘
causes suggestions for function:

The Grinnell House, Home of College treatments
(Continued from last week)
By STEPHEN GROW
Designed by the Boston Archi—
tests trainers and Leeds, the
President's Home was batteries
after the home oi the President
ol Harvard University, it contains 18 rooms and 51/2 baths
on three floors and a basement. It includes such injuries
as a central vacuum cleaning
system and a dumbwaiter.
It contains such architectural
addition as wooden letters,
sand-founded brick, and special room tile, different from the
tile used on the rooms of the
men’s directories — Smith
through liable — which were
constructed in the same year,
The house still has the original
letters and root tile, though
the tile on the directory rooms
has since been replaced. It also
has the original tricks; so do
the directories, Because press-
sent Main was so (all, 6'4”, two
organized bathtubs were in
closed,
Very little was written about
the house during the administration of President Main, but
there are some interesting facts
related to the house. Mr. L. V.
Phelps, retired former Treasurer of the College, was head of
the construction crew which
built the Grinnell House. President Main hired him in the
same year that the house was
completed, and he Worked for
the College until almost 19'
Dr. John Parish, a local physician, worked for President
Main when he was a student
at Grinnell in 1925, He chauffeurcd Mrs. Main around town
in a Hudson automobile, helped
vacuum the house, and cleaner
the numerous oriental rugs
which the gains had collected.
At the time, it was one of the
most priced jobs on campus.

She particularly receivers

in the Social Studies division,
the major innovation has been
the creation of the Social Studies course, a required 2-games-
(er course which replaced last
year‘s Historical Studies
The coleman Report has
caused the History Department
to consider the need for more
basic courses in European history. Such courses are being
planned. The department has
also dropped the required senior
seminar and increased the cum»
her of seminars open to seniors.
{this semester, seminars on
Imperialism are being offered.
Next semester the topics are
urban problems and modem
Russia. Other trends in the (department include presenting
courses with language work, and
increasing course work in AfroAmerican history.
The American Studies Department has stopped requiring that
motors take courses in an, philosophy, and sociology. instead,
American Studies motors will
take upper division general education courses in areas other
than American Studies.
Mn Nichols, a guest professor
next semester, will teach two
courses in Alrookmerican lit<
feature, which may become permanent parts of the curriculum.
The newest development in
the Anthropology Department
next semester will be the course
“Anthropology of the Soviet
Union and Satellites.”
Other changes brought about
by the coleman Report have
been more subtle. In many
courses, emphasis has been
shipped as a result of the committee's work. It has been
looked upon by many faculty
members as a mandate to
search for new ways of pre-
[meeting course material and

By JONATHAN JENKINS
The six private dining rooms
in the Forum which seat from
four to twenty people may be
reserved by campus organize
tions, committees, and other
student or faculty groups for
lunch or dinner, Monday
through Friday, and may be
used for small group meetings
as well as for dining. remaining
the dining rooms are two kitchenettes which students may reserve to prepare their own did—
here.
Mrs. Hawk, the Forum director, said that both the kitchenettes and the dining rooms were
being used more than ever this
year. The private dining rooms
are used by the Student affairs
committee, by directories that
invite faculty members and
their wives to have dinner with
them, by the ﬁdance committee, by such groups as the
Y.R.’s, the Y.D.’s, the Grinnell
College Christian Fellowship,
as well as the trials, the qatar anrd, and AWS. They are
also used for discussion groups
who wish to meet with guest
speakers or centuries, and occasionally for bridge lessons in
the evening.
Students use the kitchenettes
frequently for making winners
with dates, and for small
parties; a few use them simply
for baking. 0n the whole, they
seem to enjoy rising them and
find them very well equipped.
One of the complaints that
students have concerns the lack
or privacy in the kitchenettes.
There is a rule that when the
‘
Carleton
Labor and management are
negotiation their ﬁrss contract
at Carleton College this year.
The non-student service employees ot the college voted to
ulllanize last month, and have
presented their first demands.
The position or the college is
that it granted generous wage
increases at the start of the
year and the budget for the fiscal year is already set. The
union reportedly is seeking in»
creates in wages of up to forty
percent.

kitchenettes are in use. the our»
gains may not be pulled. Even
it they were closed, they are,
according to one student, like
a Iishrnet, so that it is possible
to see through them. Several
students brought this problem
111); one girl said that the
kitchenette: are “like small
ﬁschools which everyone can
see in.” The only other would
which was found with them was
the ﬁve dollar deposit Which is
required before students may
use the kitchenettes. One student text that there should be
some other way to get students
who have broken something to
pay.
The private dining rooms and
hitchenettes seem to be serving
a purpose in providing not only
a place where students can
meet with other students and
faculty members, but also a
place where various organizations can get together. They are
quite popular; however, it
seems that their success would
be even greater if more privacy
could be provided.

A New Government
Out of the turmoil of the past
few weeks, there have driven some
good signs. Students have shown an
interest in the community, and despite
the effectiveness of their concern for
the open limitation issue, in many
cases they have seriously worked to
understand the problems involved,
and they have tried to create a liveable situation in the forms. One of the
areas which most captured their interest and calculated their implications, and, perhaps, one of the most
educational benefits derived from the
experience was the circulation of
rules and regulations the hall would
accept, and the creation of judicial
councils to handle disputes.
Students have shown a genuine
interest in the procedures and
methods of government. The situation of Grinnell is perfect for encouraging these interests. We live in
a small community. We have here an
opportunity for instrumentation in
governmental forms that we will never have again.
There are many kinds of government. There are even many kinds in
which there can be popular elections
and degrees of freedom. The number
of students at Grinnell is small enough
so that there is no real need for a student senate — for the many to be represented by a few. There is no reason
why there cannon be general assemblies in the symposium of all the
students. In ancient Greece, or in the
town meetings of New England this
kind of direct democracy worked well.
In this way more students could become involved in the warnings of student government. Also, 5 t u d e n t 5
would not be able to complete that
they were not represented; they
would represent themselves.
Why stop here, though? We
ought to be bold innovation and
should not she away from leather ex»
residents and roller conversations
than this one, A student comes to
Grinnell College for four years. Why
not experiment with four different
kinds of government? No student
would have to live under the same
system twice, and if the issues were to
become boring, at least the diversity
would be housing, We might have a
‘direct democracy one year, an hierarchy the next year, a republican form
of government one year, and then perhaps a monarchy or tyranny,

The college has already had experience in the shipping forms of std—
sent government. The number of
members of the student senate seldom
remains the same for more than a
year. But this flux is only a small indication of Grinnell’s great potential
for variation and modifications. Let
us combine the best qualities of a
store humidity and a permission flexibility. We could have a strong and
established form of government each
year, but that form could change from
year to year. Let us cast off the chains
of full monitors; let us be free to
learn.
Students on Committees
This college is one of the most advanced in the country in providing a
curriculum stability. The faculty has
been engaged in putting students on
faculty committees for a long time.
Now that the faculty has approved the
plan at their meeting, students will
soon help to establish policy on matters of curriculum. By giving students
partial responsibility for their curriculum the college is protecting itself
from the disorders that have occurred
at such places as Berkeley, when students assisted they be given credit for
courses w h o s e significance was
mounted by college administrators.
There is a pattern to the disorders
caused by the demands of students.
First they ask for social freedom, as
they have done here at Grinnell; then
they move into other areas, such as
curriculum, By putting students on
the educational policy committees,
Grinnell will likely be shared those
disorders known to Berkeley. While
attending meetings of these committees students will feel that they are
actually interesting the curriculum.
Of course, things will not change
much, for students will easily be
personnel to the processors’ point
of View, and besides, we will probe‘
buy choose only the most responsible
students to go on the committees, and
everybody knows that responsible
people are those with the newest innovative or imagination ideas.
More good than had will result
from the college’s new policy. Students may not do much good for the
curriculum, but it will keep them off
the streets, and when students are
doing committee work, they cannon be
having illegal open forms.

Rolhsteln Reveal:
2nd stamp Abortion
To the Editor:
After having read only the
first four paragraphs of Mr.
stamp’s latest intellectual abortion, l have again been moved
to write in protest. Normally,
I would not become involved
who the question of opens, but
since our journalistic Diogenes
has reported in his arctic of
Calling in [he “university,” I
feel that the larger issues are
worth commentary upon. Slump
makes three basic assumptions
ln llls first four paragraphs, all
of which I find questionable, to
say the least.
First, he assumes that given
freedom, the students will minute it. (“How can giving culprits something widely desired
by students be anything but an
Incentive to break the rules?”)
Aside from the fact that I re
sent being considered a culprit.
I find stamp’s assumption of
basic evil as the prime combo
next of students’ souls some
what housing, After all, is not
he a student also? One can only
under that Mr. stamp knows
that he would minute what he
considers a privilege. Perhaps
he should be sent back for fourmore years of high school until he ls adult enough to handle
responsibility.
Second, stamp assumes that
If the forms were allowed to
establish their own degree of
opens, students will naturally
differentiate among them In
terms of “authentication.” It
then follows that those students
who just don’t care to live in
forms with relatively large
amounts of time for opens will
still feel presented normally into
living in them, Two obvious
points will refuse this. On the
one hand, there is presently no
mass exodus to off-campus
apartments, which are in essentially the same position as
forms with 24 hour opens. on
the other hand, limitations on
vacancies will create a perfect1y invisible excuse for not being in one of these forms —
there just wash't enough room
for everyone. Should it when be
argued that these people will
nevertheless feel forced to establish more forms with more
opens? I ask, “Should the normally responsible people on
campus be forced to live under
conditions imposed by such
outlets works, people so creature that they cannon even
stick by what they feel ls
right?”
”If Dr. suggest does not
come up with a reason why
the principle holds for social
rules and not academic policies,
the faculty ought to ask for his
head. . .” It may surprise Ml'.
stamp that there do exist col19395 that do not have any
forms. A college is not a domioils for normally backward infants, The calls are here because there Is no other housing
to accommodate the students
and because the administration had wanted to exercise
some control over students. Not
all colleges have accepted this
attitude as being interest to
the institution. C.C.N.Y. has no
forms; the University of
Hawaii has almost none; I
have been told that LeMoym
College, with which we have an
exchange program, has no
forms either. Columbia has
just done away with all limitations on limitations.
In answer to stamp’s last
question, I feel that a society
in which all truth is absolute is
a society of automation »—<
computerized processes that
can do nothing new because
everything is already prescribed. Such narrowed living
is anathema to liberal education, and vice verse. You who
are reading this letter might
well wonder whether you came
here for a liberal education or
just some more of that old
horsedung drama that you are
invisible of reason and fit only
for some little article in which
you will be protected from any
contamination that exists
“elsewhere" in society.

Iweetheart, that we Black
Americans are respondents of
Africans, not vice-verse, alld
although we Blacks have retained general modes of generic
behavior from Africans, they
are expressed all different ways
(different types of dancing),
For example, American Black

whereas authentic A l ri c a n
dance is basically social, ritualistic, and communication. So
how can Mr. coleman compare
them? Most young Blacks severe African dancing to the extent that a black who can do
African cancer is highly respected for his skill and ability.
Also, African music is becoming even more a source of inspiration for Black jazz, blues,
and rhythm and blues musicians.
With respect to their alleged
obsequiousness, how can Mr.

respondents of states who are
expressed periodically, normally, politicians and hitherto continually by a white majority?
In West Africa, remember,
Blacks are a majority, and the
buyers. They area't former

There are so many statements in Mr. coleman's article

to continue my criticism. But

To the Editor:
I trust 1 am not the only one
who, after seeing Les Danseurs

in Roberts Theatre, was announced by the approach and
tone of Mr. coleman’s review
of the performance in the November 29th issue of The charles and Black, Normally 1 con.
sides critical reviews of an art
form to be only matters of
opinion and hardly worth debate. Art for me is an individual experience; the same work,
be it drama, music or literature, can smoke different
thoughts from different people.
Some people have their
thoughts specified by appearing
in print, 1 let it go at that.
However, the review was in a
proposed sense so unusual that
other past procedures must be
set aside also, and I am responding to its
We are at a liberal arts institution. This gives us license
to exchange our lessons. I
would like Mr. coleman to take
an obviously much-needed lesson from anthropology. One of
the basic tennis of this wideranging discipline is that of
“cultural relatively." It states
that a person’s behavior and
thought are to a very great extent a product of his cultural
environment. His attitudes, beliefs, mannerisms and ways of
life are prescribed for him by
his culture. The process is
called "documentation." It. is
wrong, therefore, for a person
of one cultural heritage to write-
size the culturally conditional
behavior of a “forbidden” -— it
tracks of ethnocentrism. Mr.
coleman was not being culturally relationship. He was lodging ceremonial performances
of an African people by standards he apparently picked up
from Broadway critics. He describes the music as "wireless,"
the bibliography as “write,”
the heads as “promotion," the
bare-breast performance as
"delicious exploitation of tie
sites” H this is elderly fantasticl it really is. My first re
action was a laugh of ingredients, then a short of ingredients,
then a replication that the crisis
was serious and respiratory in
need of some criticism himself.
Related to his lack of cultural relatively was Mr. coleman's placement of all blacks
in the same cultural bag. He
failed to distinction between
the meaning of black American
and black African. 1 access
him of this because of his reference to the “Uncle Tom disposition" of the ensemble. Mr.
coleman failed to realize that
the same action performed by
a black American and a black
African wniild very probably
have different meetings and
implications. The behavior of
a black American which might
be construct as tourism is not
necessarily tourism when done
by a black African.
1 could go on but my points
would begin to sound the same,
due, i suspect, to the fact that
all the shortcomings of the re—
view were manitestatlons of the
same basic fault: a lack of un—

Orchestra Concert 'steven'
By MELISSA HAYS
Paul Zonn, conducted of the Grinnell College Orchestra, detailed more of his players last Saturday night than they were
able to handle — for the program included Bartuk’s villa Con<
serve and Brahm's Second Symphony.
The concert started with a donation by Devienne. The playing
of this piece for strings alone was, for the most part, merely
pleasant — the violent’ tone was sometimes marsh, while the
yellow were unnecessarily restricted.
Many concentration may have rendered about the selection
of the Devienne composition. This rather conscious piece was
neither difficult to perform nor to understand. Perhaps the lack
of technical problems made this a desirable piece to have on an
otherwise strengths program. Although there were no removable
moments of excitement in this number, there were enough threads
in the remainder of the concert to components for this awareness.
And certainly Zonn cannon be accused of selecting old watcherses
for performance. The opportunity to hear or to play the competitions of observe computers belongs almost exclusively to college
orchestras and their addresses.
The Bartok villa concerts is n difficult piece for both tourist
and orchestra. The violent, Paul perth, played his part flawlessly,
and the orchestra had its good moments. At times, however, the
lack of unity in the orchestra drew attention away from the
tourist (particularly in the alleged when the winds consistently
logged behind). Although the instances of various sections ot
the orchestra were sometimes wireless and haphazard, at the
moments when the dramatic tension was the highest, their attacks
were clean and precise. In much of the concerts many of the
sections of the orchestra have parts distinct from each other in
rhythm and general character, each of which must be brought
out, but not to the point where one overpowers another. That
these parts were somewhat modules cannon be strongly concerned, for achieving the perfect balance would be difficult even
for a professional orchestra. Overlooking occasional and expected
your notes, the Small 5010 parts assigned to individual wind
players were played sensitivity, picking up the tone and mood
established by the villa tourist,
I had expected the Brahms to be the nearest number on the
program, for not only is it a difficult piece of music, but there
was no brilliant tourist to give it interest. I was pleasantly surprised, then, that the symphony was the best performed number
of the concert. The tone of the strings was better than it had
been previously, and almost made up for the sometimes streaming
brass section. in the first movement, an attempt was made to
create a pushed, important mood, but the result was rather thin
and wireless. The second movement was stronger, however, and
the yellow, which throughout the concert seemed to be the most
unified section, reached their highest intensity in this movement.
The seriously parts of the third movement were played With
just the right amount of minor, and the contracting, more column
parts were played with as much sensitivity. The final movement
was an emergency close to a sometimes steven performance.

The first half showed the possibilities of a strong freshman

however, is different Christmas

Greater Size, Depfll code Well ;
For Basketball Team This Year
By JEFF contact
On December 7. the Grinneli
College Pioneers will put on the
court the best basketball team
we have had in years. The two
reasons for this year's inn
proved Pioneer squad are the
increased size of the players
and a greater depth of person
new.
For the first time in several
seasons the Pioneers will have
several players seller than as.
Accompanying Terry followed
will be 6—7 Greg decimal, 8-6
Scott person, 8-4 clinton Pheh,
and 64 Gary rules. All four
players are fine shooting and
posters, and play good defense.
Furthermore, all four are
sophomores; so we can look
forward to three years of good
basketball.
As for depth, the presence of
senior Henry fingers and
sophomores Gary Johnson and
Brian Carroll will let Coach
deutsch field two equal teams.
These two factors plus the re
turn of Thor johnson, Whitey
christopher, Don Peterson, and
three other batteries leads
Coach deutsch to believe that
the loss of Mike Swariz, the
conference's fourth leading
scores, will not be computing.
Because of the team's greater
height and depth, the Pioneers
will change their style of has-
ketball to a form of fast break
end a pressing defense. Another
result of the team: changed
completion will be more No
sounds and better shooting.
Despite these improvements,
the Pioneers will still have
trouble improving their coffee
once record because the Midwest Conference is the toughest
it has been in years. Beioit, last
year's champion, is covered to
repeat with Cornell and sons
mouth, last year's second place
teams, lighting Beloit for the
top. St. Olaf, last year’s third
place finished, and Knox are
expected to be the other top
containers. joe or Carleton il
picked to be the conference
warehouse. The experts' prev
season pick for Grinnell is last
place.
Coach deutsch nevertheless
believe: the pro-season {om
cast is wrong for several reasons. The first is that the rest
of the conference does not know
of the return of Henry vintage
or of the addition of the strong
sophomore crop. easily. Coach
deutsch has declared that the
Pioneers’ team play and em
thusiasm are much better this
year. If the team keeps im<
provide as it has, we can look
for at least a first division ﬁne
ash, and maybe higher. Regardless, we will certainly surprise
a lot of teams this year.
