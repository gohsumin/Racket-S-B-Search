Nuclear Testing
The majority may often be wrong, but proper representation should still be important to a Student Senate;
the Students’ News must be taken into consideration when

Hardly a family remains in
which losses were not suffered.
The economic destruction has
been estimated at more than 5t
billion dollars, and reconstruction has still not been completed.
With these facts in mind. it is
not surprising that they have not

War damage, which still exists
in Warsaw, is a reminder and

cups representing their constitution come
; in our college society, unfortunately, it i
may be necessary for senators to take the passes of code
shipments before making a major decision in their name.
Occasionally, however, a case prices which presents a
special problem and demands special action on the part of
the senator. Then the senator must remind himself that he :
is after all a representative in a representative government ‘
system, not a system of pure democracy. He must remind ‘v
himself that his constitution chose him (usually) because
of his superior sensitivity, experience and his fundamental 5
beliefs, and rest his decisions upon his best statements.
The point has been reached where a United States de—
vision in favor of resumes testing may be in the office.
Very recent government statements are not to be cast aside
merely as idlothrents. nor the issue itself passed off. be
cause ”testing must be right or the government worlds’t ,
consider ”
The government is under pressure from an aggressive
section of our society which feels that the only may to win
an theoretical battle is by mass destruction and listings.
it is also under a less powerful pressure from minority hurrtanitarians and peace groups which are attempting to half
testing and to fight, if fight we must. on theoretical and
economic grounds. /
It is our job as students representing an educated, informed part of society to take a stand, and to every prev
cards as well. '
We were approved to hear several of the senators
last night say that the resolution presented was not the con
corn of the senate or students. This seems strange since
‘we, as students, represent a good part of the population, and since, particularly in this matter, it is our general
tion, and the generation we hope to bear, that will be most
affected. Moreover, from our ranks should come leadership,
and as leaders we should set the pace for active interest
in national affairs.
The arguments against the assumption of nuclear
testing seem obvious in suite of a decided lack 01' agreement between Dr. minus mailing (who says that 400.000
detective children could be born in the next ten years as
a result of a bomb such as the latest Soviet horror) and
Dr. Edward seller who suggests rather grudgingly that
there may be some danger in radio-active fall-out.
There is a broad issue at hand here. Aside from the
worry of confused chromosomes, we simply cannon take
this sort of chance with human lives. A Strong desire for
life, and a respect for banking and some of its peaceful
achievements in art and science cannon exist side by side
achievements cannon exist side by side with the destruction
carelessness that calls for continued testing.
Any practice we might hope to gain by a assumption
of atmospheric testing (though gain seems impossible with
‘naturals and smaller nationsewanting a monitoring) would
be outweighed by the rangers we would be visiting at
the hands of our push buttons and our boobs. Furthermore,
the government has repeatedly acknowledged that Silcli
testing is of little actual value since boobs already tested,
‘as well as bacteriological and chemical welfare can annual»
1ate quite effi entry.
It seems of prime importance then, for students to reach to the immediate of the problem, to reach while code
cooperation is still going on among the chicks of staff and
,the President. Senators should vote yes to the proposed
resolution against testing assumption. If our voice is only
a small one we should remember that we are enjoying a
part in the governmental process; we have taken an initial
step and begun to every pressure as student leaders on the
side that speaks for respect of human life and peace.
persons
in almost every our nt news
paper and geological. references
to the war are still to he found.
A majority of Polish post
war items and the literature oi
this period express this theme.
Also, almost all discussions of
political and economic ques»
tions lead directly to this
point. The species of this war
has not yet left Poland.
Many roles told me that my
visit to Poland would not be
complete without a Visit to
Auschwi . the German concentration nomination‘l Camp located Just west oi
“Americans just can't imagine
what went on here," is a typical
point of conversation, and, 1
think, in most cases a true one.

i Today Auschwitz is a museum.

words “Ai'best yacht ii'ei”
(work gives freedom).
Those transferred to this site
were told they were simply be;
ing allocated and that they
would need all their recordings

was systematically complicated
and sorted before the updates
were sent to their work assign~
mens, or to the death chambers.
Prior to the evaluation oi
the camp, the staff set fire, to
the warehouses containing the'
endif. zted goods. However, in
the s sections which located
fire, 348,820 men’s suits, 336,255 sets at women's clothes and
a vast number at toothbrushes,
sharing brother, spectacles,
purchases and other assisted
articles were round. These col.
sections. along with displays
showing conditions oi the camp
make up the museum.
To understand more fully
what the war means to the roles,
let me direct your attention to
two books which have recently
been placed on reserve in the lie
board, “\Ve Have Not vol“ ttcn,"
and “The AuschwiizeBirkcnau
