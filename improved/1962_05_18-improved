The court problem, part two
The first publicized meeting of the charles and Black
editorial board was a success. .
Wednesday, twenty persons, including members of Grillnell’s tliree student courts and one faculty court advisor
talked into the open a number of stars in the student
applied a number of snap-s in the student judicial system
bingo the open. ’
As the S & B suggested last week, a lnajor problem lies
in the fact thatprocedllre varies between the court ; that
a schedule of procedure has never been fully established so
that even the justices themselves are not always certain as
to “what happens next." And, in addition, it was agreed
that if the justices themselves are confused, the dependence
are often completely completed.
This arbitration has resulted in hard feelings, charges‘
of insurance and a general feeling that the student court
system lies somewhere between Uncle jesus and calls;
This, of course, does not have to be the case, as the proposals suggested at the Wednesday meeting indicate.
First, it was suggested that communication between the
courts and dependence be improved. A fully description of
court procedure as it will be followed should be submitted
to each defendant with his notification to appear.
This procedure of course first first be standardized.
Perhaps, as High Court Chief Justice Jim noble suggests
in an opinion handed down this week, it is not the
responsibility of the courts to establish procedure 7
this is a legislative function.
In reducing an appeal made on the grounds that the
protection of the case was importantly appointed, noble
says that “In the absence of any alternatively prescribed
method of governing appointment of this: post, the
specific manner by which the AWSB or CofHP defects
its official protection is not open to question by the court.”
The above example is typical of the zoophilia which exist
now in court operating procedure, zoophilia which must be
proved out by a committee of the Senate with advice from
court members.
A second suggestion made Wednesday was that the once
much discussed idea. of a student december be exposed.
Thrown out originally because it was thought by many
that the student december function was not a necessary
one, that his presence would only big; down the courts in
minutes, the idea now seems to be the best way of ensuring that each defendant is fully informed of his rights
before the court and is advised as what to expect from it.
Student dependent should be appointed on a permanent
yearly basis by the Senate. Besides seeing that justice is
done — something which cannon always be insured when
looking at a case from a protection's point of View or
even the point of view of an objective judge — the presence of a " friend” in the court-room would make defense
arts feel that justice is being accomplished. And often
times this feeling is the thing which keeps 'I penalties
student from becoming overly better at his position.
The feeling here after such a meeting as \er'ednesday’s
is one of optimize, We think that the problems which
have existence Grinnell's courts can be overcome and that
an intelligent group of people justices, senators alld
other interested persons 7 will see them overcome soon
:illegal Ill 'lililllil lIlIlIiIlIllllIllllllllltllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
The Grinnell Student Court By ups as presently stated are as
follows' .
1 An official protection, appointed by the AWS or soil-IF for
