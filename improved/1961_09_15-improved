Comes a cause in the days occupation that is known
as the wrapping hour.
And we begin to we .
We have watched Gl shell grow from an all-Iowa
F, even for mama’s best earnings to a place which has finally
produced people who find discussion more entertainment' than wearing fails on their heads, or cars on their fails.
,Vi’e don’t want it to stop here.
We, who have seen change begin, wonder whether
this current all too "groups" crew can disease their
romantic dreams of college tradition, and extract instead
the struggle which comes with the new and more difficult
Grinnell iii transition.
Freshmen, won’t you set aside ollr worst fears? Won’t
you identify themselves? Identify themselves not by name
and hall on a card hung about your neck like a dog license,
-or by similar changes on the tops of your heads, but in the
classroom, acid more important outside of the classroom.
identify yourself by your very personal implications and
opinions. Use your student voice.
If you are a political radical; let us know. If a political
conservative tell us that, too. If you are a middle-of—theroader let los know why. Don‘t let your discussion half in
the classroom and be replaced in the form or union with
the old Grinnell suppliers about people instead of ideas.
Bring your individual feeling into the T.V. younger
to those still caught connected in the old Grinnell. Most
important, don’t let us tell you who you should be; make
bl. 'e we know who you are.
We. who have grown to respect the broader Grinnell,
the school unai'write of “mastercard,” unafraid to accept the
new in people, we clear with you, freshmen to remember
that it i you who can leave Grinnell half-born, or carry
Grinnell still further along ill progressive patterns set by
the forward looking- lilleral arts colleges
Think, identify themselves, discuss, speak out, don’t be
prep . allan our fears, prove themselves up to the
clearly: 'e not only of a fine tradition, but of a fiber more
exciting time of change.

The United States National
Student Association is the only
group in the country which can
claim to represent the opinion
or United States students. It was
founded in ibm by 350 schools.
Approximately 400 schools are

Constitutionally, all ultimate

is the annual National Student
Congress It is this body which
makes policy [or the coming
year in the form of basic policy

NSA can only speak out on is
sees which directly touch upon
student liic.
The Congress is first divided
into workshops and subworkshops Grinnell was represented
at the following: Federal louise
nation dealing with higher education, educational
with emerging areas, the strip-
‘mac of student government and
'tlie role of students in college
policy making.
Workshops are devoted to
an exchange oi ideas rather
than to policymaking. Actual.
exchanges

open to debate and amendment.
And again, the proposal must be
passed by a majority. However,
'a minority resolution can bc
classes on to the Congress with
la 20 per cent vote in both
groups.
This leaves the Congress with
,over a hundred resolutions to
‘consider. In the relatively brief
time during which the congress
meets it is impossible to consist
her all or even a good number of
the resolutions. So resolutions
,coming out oi committee are
