For Off-Campus Address Special Faculty Meeting
SAGA Option
By holly acquire
Nineteen offscarnpus seniors
will be able to cook their own
step for tharremainder of the
year as a result of the Saga
references held last Tuesday.
With 64% of the student body
voting (an initially large
turning for a references), the
result was 403-290 in favor of
allowing the nineteen to forest
their board fees, although it
means paying an increase of
about $3.65 per boulder next
semester.
Another sidereffect of the option will be the investigation
of a checking system in the
dining calls. Effective October
6, according to the references,
each boulder will be required
to give his meal card number
to a checked and in some Cases
identify himself upon entering
the dining room for each meal.
in another section of the references, a small majority indicated they did not want more
Saga options, presumably because more options, according
to the references, would retail showing a photo LD. card
at each meal.
But most students did vote in
favor of the college listing
ID. cards to each student to
provide dollar of identity, age,
and student status, According
to the Student Coordinator's
Office these will be issued soon.

The business of a special faculty meeting on Monday was
“special business” — presentations by the administration

No proposals could be discussed or voted on because of
the molecular nature of the
meeting, although at one point
a proposal was made for action

To the Editor:

ieee has had in producing a
textbook is truly amazing. it is
too bad that the Class ot 1970
will have no textbook to look
back to after we've left Grln<
well. 1 am not in favor ct elimis
rating the literary magazine, but
it is no substitute.
What can he done? First of
all, I believe that a textbook
could still be put out this year.
Money could be raised. issue—
ing the SGA really can't give
any, ii-om immediate advanced
sales. it might not be the best
book, but it would be some
thing for the class oi low to
look back to, to remind us ot
our time spent here. And, even
it this can't be done, l rccom
send that from now on money
be set aside each year fur
the production cl a textbook
and that no one timber with
these funds, i spent live years
at a school with a total enrollment oi 250 students and a
graduation class oi 24; yet, i
have five textbooks for these
years and l enjoy looking back.
There was never any trouble
turning these out, and they were
tree. There is no reason why a
college ot 1150 students which
must get more money than a
small secondary school, can't
produce a textbook, even it
it costs the student about $10.
Perhaps the Senate should code
since this rather than carrying
about allocation money for a

it this is all the sell. the color

perhaps we can response with

Alice In Blunderldml
Dean Alice Low this week blow the lid off Gtim’well's already
turbulent drug situation and planned the campus into total confusion about the remarkable modules college drug policy. The
clean “certified” the drug policy by instruction resident advisors
to report to the means when they are “reasonably certain" that a
student is “under the influence of an illegal drug.”
Such a policy is simply assure. it would inequitabiy discipline
students by setting up an arbitrary pressing game for the resident advisors' agreement. Perhaps the drive dean wants the
resident advisors to use birdswalching techniques — sporting and
identifying drug users by their bright red eyes and long hair.
Ii. is accounting to learn that the college seeks to discipline
students {or being “under the inﬂhence or drugs.” Even America’s
adjust drug laws, which impose marsh penalties for the possession
or sale of certain drugs, do not regard “being under the inﬂhence” as a crime.
Even more interesting is the fact that Dean Low's RA enforcement policy has virtually destroyed any conﬁdance students with
drug problems might have had in their resident advisors. For a
troubled student drug user to seek counseling from a resident advisor is now about as likely as a built-hidden mass murderer stopping in to chat with J. Edgar cooper or Richard Turner.
While Dean Low's policy was assure in itself, the higllrllanded
and illegitimate techniques she used in circulation it were blair

dean did not consult students when circulation the policy. But
the mind bottles at the replication that she did not consult the

resident advisors. Dean Law’s sudden searching of decision-making power was a kick in the crotch to students who had been led
by President suggest to believe that resident advisors would be

The Low escapade has significance car beyond the drug issue,
because it has exposed in students the real manner in which the
decisionsmaking process works at principal, Students are actually
irrelevant in the decisionmaking process that spots out the administrative policies under which they must live.
The administration shrewdly policies students by allowing
them token representation on committees, but in the final analysis: nursing Basement is the source of all power. That is why
the college drug policy calculated by last year’s Student affairs
Committee was mysteriously eliminated over the summer and.
replaced this tall by President suggest's drug policy. That is why
President suggest will decide how to deﬁne the resident advisors’
role in the drug policy. That is why three students were placed
on conduct promotion for illegal drug use.
The existing decision-making process at Grinncll can no longer
be generated. And lodging by student reaction to this week’s Low
blow, it will not be generated. AS Bob Dylan has observed, “The
order is rapidly changing." Grinnell students are finally making

Judge coleman began the
trial on Wednesday by listing
bench warranty for the, arrest
of four defense attorneys after
the protection, U. S. Attorney
Thomas A. woman called their
absence “so incredible irresponsible and unprofessional that
it would be unbelievable if one
did not take into account some
of their prior act’ons."
The warranty were issued for
Michael J r Kennedy, Michael E.
Tiger, and Dennis J. Roberts.
all of California, and Joel H.
Lefcourt of New York.
CLAIM HARASSMENT
The team of lawyers who are
depending the Conspiracy Eight
picked a trial counsel team 'to
handle the case The team consists of Charles harry, Bill
Kunstler, and Lee Weinglass. it
was felt that three rather than
seven lawyers could deal with
the case. default, one of the
four for whom warranty were is
seed called the action “an ill
gay form of harassment and optimization against political lawyers for the purpose of preventing radical clients from obtaining lawyers who will defend
their”
Tiger, a law professor at
UCLA. was flows to Chicago
In handhelds Lefcourt voluntarily surrendered and, with Tiger.
was held in the Cook County
jail. Both attorneys were subsequently released on their own
recognizance by the 7th U.S.
Court of Appeals.
The arrest warranty against
the other two attorneys were
quarter by Judge Albert Wollenburg of the U. S. District
Court in San Francisco. Wollenburg said the proceedings did
not comply with the law.
On Monday, September 29th,
Judge coleman discussed the
charges against the defense attorneys and allowed them to
withdraw from the case.
JURY SELECTED
Earlier in the trial, controversy emerald over the sc.
section of errors on Thursday.
Judge coleman refused to allow
either side to directly question
prospective errors. lists ad
lawyers were instructor to submit questions to coleman who
then decided whether or not
they should be asked.
Defense attorneys wanted to
h n o w prospective errors
opinions on the Vietnam war,
long hair, drugs, and the right
of political distant (one question
was “Can you identify basis
Joplin?). Huffman refused to
ask any questions dealing with
these areas. Following the selection of the jury, which consists of two white men and ten
women (two of them black), d9
sense counsel William Kunstler
laid, “We feel the jury has not
been asked a single relevant
Question."
POSTPONEMENT DENIED
Another blow to the defense
came on Friday when coleman
denied a request for postponement on the grounds that Chiarles harry, one of the defense
lawyers, was seriously ill in
California and could not be present in court. Bobby Scale, in
particular, claimed that harry
was his attorney and that un<
der the Sixth Amendment he
was guaranteed counsel of his
choice. The court ordered the
defense to proceed with the attempts at hand.
One light moment did occur
during trial’s proceedings.
Defendant Abbie coleman blow
a kiss to the jury when he was
officially "introduced to the
court.”
“The jury will disregard the
kiss thrown by the defendant,"
Judge coleman solemnly pro—
claimed. .
On Monday, September 29,
the defense submitted a motion
for a district. Defense counsel
Kunstler said the judge should
either declare a district or disability himself because he “has
declared, harassed and
designed defense attorneys in
the trial." Kunstlcr further
charged that Judge coleman
has tried to source the dependence to while meir constitutional rights m counsel of their
choice, has threatened defense
lawyers with contents charger
and often has interpreted the
sense lawyers during their on
moments.
consecutive attorney thomas
A. woman, arising against the
motion, accused the dependence
and their lawyers of trying the
case in the press rather than
in the countries. woman called
the conduct of the defense its
corners “incredible. . . and appearing." The motion wal
denied by the court.
Judge coleman also denied
another defense motion for a
hearing on the constitutionality
of two Chicagorordinances applying to permits for parties
and sleeping in city parks. who
defense had maintained that the
constitutionality of the laws was
the “heart and cruz of the matter in this trial."
Richard A. Schultz, assistant
US. Attorney, had earlier
told that court that several of
the dependence did not really
want the permits they had requested to sleep in Lincoln early
or march to the International
Ampitheater.
JUROR DISMISSED
The trial took an unexpected
turn Wednesday, October 1.
when the youngest member of
the jury, Kristi King, 23, was
focused from further but
Miss King stated that she
could not remain important
after being shown a letter
which her family received the
previous Monday.
The letter Said, “You are being watched," and was signed
“The Black partners.”
Miss King had not seen the
letter until it was given to her
at the order of Judge coleman.
The defense rejected to the
court's action in the matter.
“The government, in an extraordinary moreover, suspended
in contracting a member of
the jury of whom it did not approve," said defendant David
Dellingcr.
Another error, Mrs. Ruth 1..
 
October 3. I969
Peterson, received an Identical
letter, but said It would not affect her decision in the case,
The defense subsequently submitted a motion for a district
when Mrs. Peterson was not
focused, but was overruled.
As the Conspiracy trial continues, attention is beginning to
focus on the coming “second.
battle of Chicago,” massive
antique actions planned for
October 8711 by SDS, the Black
partners, and the Young words.
TWO "ACTIONS" PLANNED
There will be two separate and
different actions in Chicago,
both aimed at supporting the
Vietnamese and getting the
U.S. out of Southeast Asia.
One action, planned by the
National Office “Weatherman"
fiction 0! SDS, includes a mass
rally and march, but will primarily’ focus on mobile streetlighting, aimed at increasing
the militancy of the white
movement by showing that
writes are willing to light.
The 'other action, called
country by the black another
Party, the Young words, and
the Revolutionary Youth Movement II (RYMJI) group of
SDS, will consist of a "disc!joined mass march” through
black, white and Latin working
class communities, to be pre«
added by three days of action.
The build-up includes support
activities for the Black another
Breakfast for Children program
and the Lord's Day Care Center, a high school and junior
college hoycott and march to the
Board of Education, a rally
around the Chicago alternate0n<
ll worcester Plant, and an
action intended to protest "insulin practices of Chicago
hospitals — such as the involuntary specification of black and
Latin women."
The two sets of plans come
in the wake of the much discussed SDS "split" last sum.

National Office Controlled by

TO BUILD A “RED ARMY”
Since the summer SDS convention, Weatherman has devel»

letﬂits, and organized urban
working-class communities to
bring people to Chicago. The
Weathermen have been organizing under the theme of “Bring
the War Home." They see the
action in Chicago as an opportunity to begin building a “red
army to fight on the side of
the Vietnamese, the blacks, and
expressed people everywhere."
The superrmilltancy of
Weatherman, however, has an«

some as a masochistic survival

AS a result (if the disenchant—

formed a quick coalition with
the partners and words to draw
up alternate plans for the Chicago action. Most disorders believe the RYM-IT Panthericrd

Chairman,
Grinnell Women‘s generation
From numerous conversations
with Grinnell faculty and students i find that very few
people on campus understand
what women's generation means.
our group image varies: we
site seen as either bitchy men—
waters who recently want to be
men, or a collection of conscious doegooders, or rapid semi<
posts fighting for “female
rights." We are none or the
above. Rather, we are female
students, faculty, and wives or
faculty who are unhappy about
what being a Woman in our
society has come to mean, We
are interested in rideﬁking the
female role to include more of
tale human and less of the SHperficially medicine.
It may surprise some to
learn that our focus is not on
male expression but on sell—
compression. We are approved
when we realize how we have
been carefully trained to demand very little of ourselves.
We are not expected to be as
bright as men, to work as hard.
to be as actively involved in
issues and ideas. Many or us
h a v e unconsciously accepted
this comfortable role through
out childhood, in college and
even in graduate school. We
are trained to be passive, dec<
archive objects rather than active, thinking human beings.
Whenever we think about women's “generation" we ﬁnd that
our most difficult task is to
generate ourselves from a dehumanizing self-image which
projects and modules us, We
