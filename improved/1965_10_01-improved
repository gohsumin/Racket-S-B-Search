Freshman Theatre Workshops
performances, presented in Arena
Theatre this week, gave, on the
whole, the impression that there
is plenty or acting potential strong this year’s crop oi dramatic
hopefuls.
In all, four scenes from {our different plays were presented.
These included Murray Schisgal’s
Luv, Arthur L. topic's 0h Dad,
Poor Dad, Jean Kerr's Mary, Mary
and Who‘s Afraid of Virginia
tools? by Edward Albee. The
quality of individual performances
varied a good deal, as could be expected, although at least one out
standing performer appeared in
each scene.
The indisputable climax of the
evening came at the end, however
with the performance of Who’s
Afraid of Virginia tools? 0n the
basis of overall fine characterize»
tions, dramatic intensity. and
depth of portraits, this scene and
the people involved in it deserve
special recognition.
The scene, which required an
enormous amount of authentication
and understanding on the part oi
its cast and director. involved the
portraits of numerous challenging
emotions and the like. trends
Thomas, who had the female lead,
played the part of an alcoholic
woman driven almost mad because of her own stability. Others
in the play, Bill Downey, bobby
Abbott, and Dennis Rich, were re
quoted to create equally complex
solutions in the form of difficult
character portrayals The scene
was able directed by Dennis

also took over the role at George

The College and the Students,
Under the present system, the
only areas for related molecular
signal contact are the classrooms,
the library, and the Forum. By
integrating the computer these
areas would be enhanced to include
going back and forth to classes,
dining. and meeting informally in

Perhaps the most prospective
solution offered was that of divided the campus between lower
division (freshmen and sophos
moves) and upper division (opinions and seniors). Such a plan, it
was felt, would english the present
artificial division by sex. Separate
regulations would be established,
allowing the college to place somewhat restriction regulations on
underclassmen, but also permit:

to the upperclassmen.

Plans Going Ahead for New College;
Si. Olaf Assists Tuskegee degrees
By PAUL BRADLEY
Four processors from Amherst,
Smith, Mount l-loiyoke, and the
University of Massachusetts met in
the Summer of 1958 to draw up
the plan for is new college equidistant from the {our existing institutions. But not until Harold F.
Johnson, Amherst class of 1918,
gave six million did these college
plans come out of storage, The
new college will be known as
Hampshire College and will over—
ate as a computational liberal arts
institution. Through cooperation
oi the tour schools, Hampshire
should be completed by May of
1968.
The new institution Will serve as
a catalyst to accelerate the coordination of the tour surrounding
colleges, will experiment with educational innovations, and hopefully will substantially reduce the
cost or a college education without
improving its quality. Freshmen
would attend seminars consisting
 
of twelve students each; students
would study only three courses at
a time, making possible greater
concentration of effort; and independent and student group work
would be substantially emperor
sized.
it n o
dirty~five students from St. Olaf
spent the summer in Tuskegee,
Ala. They lived with metro fax—
clips and entered the adults. Many
oi the adults previously could not
write their own names and had
never heard classical music.
The motors worked under the
s u m in e r Education Program,
which is generally finances
through the Office of economic
Opportunity and the Office at Education. Altogether there were six
hundred motors, five hundred and
thirty of them degrees, working
in the area surrounding Tuskegee
Institute. The Summer Education
Program is spoken of as a second
front to the civil rights movement,
but the motors are forbidden to
demonstrate.

watson Studies English Economy,
observed london'siﬁalter Education
By RONALD LANE
John C, watson (economics)
spent his leave last year in London doing research on the English
financial system and receiving
English higher education He spent
much of his time at the London
School of Economics.
watson commented about the
English higher educational system
saying. “I visited classes brown
time to time to see how they op»
ei-cited. The British undergraduates in economics, especially the
seniors, are quite a bit further
along than those in the country.
They are reading the journals and
basic works of the field instead
of text books."
Graduate Level Law
“On the other hand," he went
on to say, "the graduate level education is not as well developed
[here as it is here The LDnan
School of Economics has recently
started offering a course program
for its master's degree in economics. The school does not yet care
ry normal graduate study as tar
as we do in the U.S.7IH fact this
can apply to all social studies and
not just to economics.
watson continued by saying that
"it used to be that Oxford, Cambridge, and London were the only
real centers of higher learning in
England, but now the new regional
universities are looking very good
>such as the University or Sussex,
and the University at Essex."
watson said that there are no
 
liberal arts colleges in England
“for everyone there goes to a university for a particular field or
study."
watson's research convicted of
working on the national financial
accounts for the United Kingdom—
in particular the statistics or various hairbank financial Institutions
such as insurance companies and
building societies.
His field or specialization is what
is called “llowofrfunds analysis."
He said that he “wanted to see
what the British were doing in
this field” and to use these data
in his analysis or the British economic.
He knew they were “somewhat
behind in these developments."
but he saw that they were “trim
pressing very rapidly." However,
they had not yet put together the
particular data he was seeking.
They locked a financial statement
for all the non-bank financial
institutions.
The “Old Lady"
watson contributed to the statistical work being done at the
Bank or England and observed
that the “Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street" was a “colorado institution.”
“It (the bank) is one or the
oldest central banks in the world,
much like a very inscrutable old
lady—very conservative," said
watson “The guards still wear
bright red tests, rosecoiored fails,
and black top hats. Although the
 
managing and the decision-making
in this basic were secret, the research department was very helpful."
“In the‘bank of England," commented watson, “everyone start—
ed as a clerk and worked up from
there. This is typical. Professional
economists are just starting to appear In business and government.
except for a few economic advise
era in high places.”
Enormous Cultural Life
watson also expressed his enthuv
siasni for London, voting that
”just by living there, one becomes
automatically interested in architecture, history. literature, and
the arts.”
“London has an enormous cuba
rural life," said watson. "The
theaters are numerous, excellent,
and less expensive than they are
here. London has live symphony
orchestras and the reported CovA
event Gardens ballet and opera."

He also noted that the “English
people are unfailingly police, The
class structure that used to be so
pronounced IS gradually becoming
blessed. This my possibly began
in World War it when they were
all in the bookings together. The
educational system is also become
ing more and more democratic.
although there are still some very
excluded private schools.“
Bus service Good
“Many things in London don’t
appear ultimate to Americans
who are likely to be critical of
the lack or modern household appliances,” watson posted out.
He went on to say that the "public
transportation system is very
good. You never have to wait
more than time minutes for a bus,
which is good for a spreading
city.”
“There is one conﬂict that the
British have to face from the
point of view of the national economic level," said Dawsmi, “It they

Coach add powers was pleased
with the over-all play of his team
in the opening contest, but noted
several areas where improvement
is needed. He was satisfied with
the way the sophomores played
and the way their enthusiasm was
able to help them and the upper»
classics cover up some errors.
He thought there were no spam-
‘popular tickets or defensive plays
l but that totally the play was good.
i'l‘he pass rush was effective and
the defensive fairfield play was
comfortable, although there were
a couple conscious boundary. He
felt the line play against the rush
up the middle was a little weak,
but fortunately Cornell did not explore this wellness.
