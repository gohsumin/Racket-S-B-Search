Ex-Prol Talks on Social Analysis
professor Muni Frumhartz, formerly oi the sociology and anthro
policy department here at print
Hell, and now at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, lectures
Monday night on “The Role of
Comparative Analysis in the social Sciences." There was some
confusion at the beginning as to
what was going to be discussed.
and in attempting to get it cleared
up, everyone got more confused.
Once things were straightened
out, Professor Frumhartz exp
planned the process or comparative analysis, from the viewpoint
of the social scientist, as the use
or the logic or instrumentation
Without the actual physical act. He
stated that since it is impossible
to create cultures containing a set
number of variables, one must attempt tn find existing societies, or
societies that have existed in the
past, with a large number ot similarities. In this way, the reasons
for their differences may be reduced. The major dilficlllty in
performing what the professor
called “intellectual or mental experiments" lies in finding these
alternate societies.
Professor Frumhartz went on to
note that while the United States

point or the lecture was the suggestion that differences between
the two cultures, which are at
least as numerous as the similarities, should be investigated. professor Frumhartz claimed that a
comparative analysis of these
points would help us understand
why our society has developed as
it has and provide some insight

‘Square and Circle Are Alike

Paul G Kuntz (philosophy) has
spent years now in a Search for

is over. The problem with philosor
papers is that they look for and

impossible to find in philosophy,
when they could easily be ioiinti
in other fields, This according to
Dr. Steve Armentroui of the University oi Iowa who spoke Tilesday in the science lecture room.
automatically seen, there is absolutely no difference between a
circle and a square (both are 1schemes). or for that matter be
green a sphere and a cube.
Kuntz and colleagues may are
due that the theoretical viewpoint
is a somewhat technical one. Nevertheless. when dealing with squirting and their huge philosophical
implications, it must he remote
 
bored that everything is point of

armenia’out's talk based the
question of deﬁking the anywhere,
based on an attempt to under
stand geometry and analysis in

pointed out that this problem and
attempts to verify or discrete

difficulty seems to lie entirely in
that fourth dimension, too complicated to picture, too simple to

theology is a branch of mathematics which attempts to code
late analysis and geometry. its
major contribution to the ﬁend as
