Wright Tactics Draw

by bobby midnight
The mail box blues announced: “Nathan Wright, Jr. on
‘Black Power: a Creative Force.’ " and described Wright
as "a vigorous black strategies of blackrwhite configuration.” “Vigorous" was an
understatement. Wright, wh—
one conventions include his
book about Newark, Ready to
Riot, and championship of the
AfrvAmerican Studies Department at SUNY, Albany,
was on campus November 5.
He spent much timewithblack
students and visited the American priorities class. An informal public discussion took
place in South Lounge at 4:00.
Before the discussion, Wr—

with each person in the audience, creating a kind of bond
that does not usually list

by Bill Knecht
Three updates and a super
visit from the interview see

Grinnell discussingprison life
and the American legal system.
The three men, Barry McDaniel, kevin J. cialis, Ch»

afternoon in discussion with
faculty and students, first in
Loose Hall Lounge at 2:15and
finally, in the South Lounge at
4:15.
Their discussion began with
their experiences as updates
of various correction institutions, especially interview,
where they becameacquainted
with one another. interview,
they explained, is a "buffer"
between hardrcore legal institutions and the outside
world. It provides a place for
contacts to adjust to the treasures and pensions of every»
day lifettsmall things to most
people, but forces strong ent
hugh to drive some men to re
turn to the “security" that
prison can offer. Since they
are not usually allowed to re
turn, they must commit new
crimes to be restricted.
The men expressed theirbelief that therefore greatnume

truly like to assume a normal
role in society, and who could
benefit greatly from an insert
action like interview. They
cited their own experiences in
penitentiaries, wherever were treated “like animals,"
and were not given the counseling and individual attention
they feel is necessary to establish true rehabilitation.
They explained how a contact
in a hard- core institution is
likely to draft into a “dream
world" of fantasy in which he
does not have to work for a
living, or accept the blame for
his mistakes, or seek to pro
side for his own security, or
accept any of the responsible
cities a healthy member of
society must accept in order
to adjust to that society.
They elaborated that rivers

then said that black recruiting are necessary for finding
creative black instructors who
will not serve as “window

Convincedthat he "couldnever have gotten a job at any
major university if it had not

STEPHEN, right, and two other members of’his‘heavily" sit comfortable inside their
,bus while the religious guru is interpreted by the SSiB.
ReligiousGuru maps to printer
by Mark Subleman
When a cartoon of more than
thirty slightly and seriously
generated losses and cars
and of more than two hundred
slightly and seriously dressed
people came to Grinnell last
Tuesday, many Grinnellians
rendered what it was allabout.
If they stayed to inquire or
went that night to Derby gym,
they learned that it was all
about a religious guru from
San Francisco namedStephen,
who had a philosophy that was
all about unified fields, and
telephony, and being together,
and energy of attention, and
the third eye, and drugs, and
shipping, and non violence.
Stephen, a tall, spencer man
of 35, who entered what he
miles ”the guru business"
almost five years ago, is let»
king two hundred of his most
devoted following on a trip H
with all runs intended -- ace
ross the country and back, a
trip which he hopes will bring
him and his block new paper—
lenses and insights, and bring
his message to new people as
well.
First stop on the trip, after
the cartoon left San Francisco
“with untold tons of done,"
was publicity, Oregon. After
the cartoon dressed the border, and Oregon state police
“believed" the members of
their drugs, Stephen went on
to publicity and his speaking
engagement there.
Neither he nor anyone else
in the group was arrested at
that encounter, however; and
Stephen attributes this, and
the “excellent" relations they
have had all along with local
officials to the group‘s striking for good relationships with
others. Stephen teaches his
following (0 be friendly and
strike for “good violations"
with everyone, for he believes
that in any endeavor, “you get
out of it exactly what you put
into it -- as you now, so shall
you read."
Much of Stephen's teaching
is, like this, strengths trade*
signal, or from traditionalorigins. There is, he told the
audience in party, "no excuse for being violent -- Thou
shall n0t kill. lfa lot ofpeople
just act peaceful, they can
make peace come.”
Stephen’s own theology is,
in fact, a curious blend international ideas, Western and
Eastern, regular and deliver
our, as well as a few newer
ideas of Stephen's own. He
considers his Zen master,
Suzuki Roshi, and the writings
of Aldous Huxley to be two of
the biggest inﬂlenses on him.
Christian influences arealso
apparent in Stephen: he told
his audience of almost five
hundred people in Grinnell
that ”Christianity has not
been tried and found wanting;
it has been tried and found
difficult." He attributes the
decline of Christianity and
other religions in the past to
“materialism, the profit mobile, and formal education."
But apparently materialism
and formal education have not
been entirely successful. Stephen said Tuesday afternoon
that there are now signs often
beginning of a large spiritual
removal. San Francisco, he
said, is the “guru capital of
the world," and in recent
years there has been a steady
increase in the number of
girls, and in the diversity of
their international origins.
This religious removal and
increase, Stephen believes, is
the result of a return to the
”vibrators disciplines”, or
those which deal with opening
up people’s minds, especially
telepathically. They are concerned with opening up the individual's "third eye" by was
ice he perceived other minds
and understands new insights
about the world.
Stephen believes that drugs
are very helpful in the process
"SENATOR CHARLES 'Three's-arcrowd' mercy says
he will sponsor a bill in the 92nd Congress to limit the
number of income tax exceptions for children to two,
because what with the population explosion and the

Opinions about the Velvet

get the impression that John
Gale and Lou Reed are primarily interested in sharing
sixteensyear- old girls.
However, the Velvet Underground have shown themselves to be much more interesting than that. Their first
album is held together by a
dramatic extension with deals

Woman’s Lib Slicrh‘era Labels,
Explains Chauvinism--Sexism
by Andrea grey
In talking with those involved
in Women's generation on car
mpus, l was able to response
with many of the misconceptions that had previously encouraged me to avoid the mo
cement. Any organization's
activities should include action centered on recruitment
of new members, and it is
opportunity that the comes
tions that have been attached
to Women's generation by the
American people and media
have forced us into a misinterpretation of the movement
and its goals. For this reason, many women have been
discouraged from playing themselves with the structure
altogether.
Since the asset of what the
media has labeled the New
mobility, the word ”generation" has attempted manager
url corporations. Because of
this, many people assume that
Women's Liberationwill make
women easier objects for men
to overcome sexually. Women's generation has also been
referred to alan "anticmale"
movement. Although they
voice fragrances concerning
how they feel they have been
treated by males as a group,
WL by no means allocated
a sacred for the members of
the male sex en cause.
Two words appear consists
entry in WL literature and speeches. Even though I didn‘t
know the exact definitions of
the words "chauvinist" and
“sexcam", I thought that I
was aware of their meetings
simply because I could use
them in automatically sound
sentences. The women I talked
to defined a chauviniSt as a
male accustomed, either con-
sciously or unconsciously, to
masturbating women by define
ing his own role as superior
to that of a woman. They cxe
planned sexcam as an attitude
which supports an interpretation of roles as differentiated
by sex. After understanding
the corporations of these
words, I realized that sexual
Freudianism is not what generation is about. Muchlike the
word “generation", the word
"sexcam” leads itself tomisconceptions.
The detective qualities [have
described are causes of the
medicare turning at the WL
meetings on this campus. A
few of the fifteen women free
sent at the meeting [attended
felt that the lack of mass participation was due to an liability of new members to relate
to the older ones. Women's
generation does n0t merely
retail the need for day care
centers and abortion clinics,
although these things are both
in the forefront of the Wells
publicized WL demands. Women‘s generation also means
intimate discussion of female
sexual andpsychologimlgrievances. Many of those new to
WL apparently find some of
the older members perspective to their need for an almost therapeutic exchange of
ideas. Therefore, they feel
that they can bestsatisfy their
needs elsewhere.
The movement is at present
hoping to fill these gaps. territory discussion groups are
being formed. It is hoped that
within these groups, women
new to the movement will be
able to communicate their respondent concerning their designated roles as females. The
Women's generation longer"
once will take place November
13 , 15. The campus WLgroup
has invited several women
from outside me college community who are lmowledgable
in topics relevant to Women's
generation to Stage a panel
discussion. In addition, there
are two Women's generation
group independence on campus
in which members read and
discuss books like Sexual joe
lyrics and The Second Sex.

Experimental Children’s Theatre is alive and well at
Grinnell College and plans to
come out of riding during7:00
p.m. performances November
is and 14 and during a 2:00
ratings performance the 14th
in the Arena theatre. After
making its great debut at Grinnell the theatre group will
make a once-insarlifetime
tour of area elementary Sch
0015. The totally improvised
script is entitled only Snow
White because Snow White and
the Seven awards is a copyrighted title, but is based on
that famous andbelovedstory.
No script was provided the
actors and the entire play was
written by the cast members
themselves as they went are
one, having only an idea of
the basic story to guide them.
DANCERS in the delightful plan
The success of the play, then,
depends solely on the intensity and creativity of the see

The cast is given a helping

The purpose of this type of

to familiarize the actors, as

is involved in the process of
theatre. The actors experiment with various phases of
theatre and in this way learn
more about what makes theatre “pick." Except for the old

Brown cards shot Pollution Affects Climate
green house effect is under-
On November 5, Dr. TheoV
more Brown of the University
of Illinois delivered the lace
me, "People Who Live in
Gas Houses." A mixed group
of faculty and students heard
Brown discuss three ways that
air pollution influences clip
mate. These were theaddition
of infrared absorbants and
participate matter to the atmosphere, the effect of ins
created energy consumption
and the subsequent addition of
heat to the environment.
The first area he explorer
was that of changing the at’
mosphere’s absorption of
infrared energy. The sun
smith energy of a relatively
short wavelength which readily permitted theatmosphere.
This energy is “founded off"
the earth back to the atmosphere where the principle abs
workers of it are water and
carbon provide. The amountof
carbon provide in the ﬂimOS’
there is particularly important in determining its ability
to absorb heat. This is known
as the green house effect.
The present extent of the
pain. It appears responsible
for no more than two-months
of a degree temperature m,
create at the most. However,
as we burn more fossil feels,
adding more carbon provide,
the absorption of heat will increase. By the year 2050, we
will have used most of our
known supplies of fossilfuels.
Their burning will have doug-
led the amount of carbon dice
side in the air. About 60% of
the carbon provide will be
quickly observed by the sure
face of the oceans, but the
rest will stay in the atlas~
there for as long as fourhun-
died years. This carbon door
side will‘absorb infrared rays
and prevent their radiation
into space, thus heating the
surface of the earth by about
four degrees. Theresultmight
be to meet the polar ice caps
and raise the level of the CC,
fans. Additionally, the amount
of precipitation in the northern
atmosphere will probably def
create. Othcrlesspredictable
effects might also occur.
The second area brown considered was the effect of larr
get amounts of participate
matter in the air. This matter
could decrease the solar radiation reaching the earth and
produce a drop in member
store. Again it is difficult to
interview present data, but air
are is evidence that the cool*
ing phenomenon will occur in
the future.
Finally, Brown discussed climate changes due to energy
consumption. All energy used
on earth eventually becomes
heat added to the environment.
While the heat currently pro
dated is negligible, in the
future areas of consolidated
population, using nuclear end
orgy, could put outa signing»
cant amount of heat.
Brown suggested the defining
need for increased research
in the area of energy generation. All presently known its
statements in nuclear energy
still leave the problem of thermal pollution. In the future
we may be forced to limit the
consumption of energy. Brown
concluded with the hope that
research in the near future
would qualify all his glumpres
sections for 2050.

Religion Committee Reports
Last year a Religious Activities committee was set up
by Dean Wall,under the championship of James judge, to
make recommendations to the
administration based on a review of campus religious ac
entities. The other faculty men
myers on the committee are
Dennis Haas and Al Jones.
The representatives from the
student body are Ken Labor
with, a senior, Floyd another'
back, a junior, and Lisa cents,
a sophomore.
The committee has continued
meeting this year to minimize
their planned recommendations to the administration.
There are two points onwhich
the committee is in agreement. The first is the necessity of an interdisciplinary
major in religion. This major
would include Eastern religions, the Jewish religion, and
other religions as well as the
Christian religion. This major
would be set up so as to meet
the needs of the broadestbase
of students possible, and not
just a group beginning in one
basic faith. The second point
is that of the need for some
type of religious services.
The committee has found that
there are enough students on
campus who feel a need for
chapel services to warrant
their confirmation. Dennis
Haas, the college chaplain,
has and will continue to offer
a wide variety of religious
services which are designed
to appeal to as many people
as possible. These are designed not only for the Christian,
but for those ofdifferent faiths
as well. The Religious Activities committee felt that it
was necessary to appeal to
those of other faiths because
die campus does include people small faiths. The commit-
tee has decided that some form
of religious activity is never»
mary, but has been wrestling
with the problem ofhow to best
serve all Students with these
activities.
Some time within the next
few weeks the committee plans
to present their findings to the
administration; what the ad»
registration will do with d1em
cannon be said at this time.
The committee, though, is 31.

Elton John And fly Reviewed
by Ron Medvin
This column begins what I
hope will be a weekly series
reviewing new recordalbums.
My comments will be short,
and obviously, the reviews will
not be professional. law just
trying to give my opinions of
some of the music beingmade
today.
A name which is being menu
signed more and more these
days is that of Elton John. His
second album (Elton John“
Uni73090) is being played on,
FM stations across the count
try, and he even (unfortunately) has made it to the AM airlines with his song entitled,
“Your Song." In England, ali
ton John is the biggestattraction of the year, and he should
catch on soon in the States as
more people hear his only American album.
There is no doubt about it;
his album is worth listening
to . . . many times. In songs
like “Take Me to the Pilot"
and ”BorderSong”cisco\Verr
fun voice will overwhelm you,
in suite of the concentration
which sometimes seems to try
to cover him up. “dirty Years
On" and “The King is Dead",
however, use the orchestra to
Elton‘s advantage as it provides a beautiful background
to his excellent singing. And
“Your Song" is probably the
most beautiful and poeticsong
heard In a long while. Elton's
voice easily adults to the intimate style of the song, and
die lyrics (written by Bernie
Taupin) are excellent.
Elton John reserves all the
praise he is getting. Ifyouare
wondering why, get a hold of
his album; you will be getting
one of the year's best.
An album released just a
short while ago will no doubt
sell well, and for good reason.
The album is fly it The Family Stone: Greatest Hits (Epic
KESO325) and contains every one of their great songs.
”Dance to the Music", “plant
to Take You Higher" and
“Stand" still are powerful
songs with the driving Stone
beat. fly’s vocals are of
course excellent, and the rest
of the group matches his vice
want style. The instrumental
tion is also of high qualit '
there is no resulting the music of the Family Stone. This
is definitely an album for
“fans" of fly . . . and if you
missed him in Chicago, this
album is a worthy substitute!
(He was great in New York!)
If you have any comments or
criticisms - (or if you want
me to review a specific album) , please let me know by
writing to Box 717 or write to
the 58:8 office. Also, don't
forget the appearance ofEnoch
Smokey on the 14th; they’ll
be playing at 9:00 in Derby.

agreed that more release centers such as interview should
be built. McDaniel felt that,

amazing form problems and in
developing ideas for form
activities. The discussions,
currently going on, are scheduled for completion next
week.
The SGA cabinet officers
have also been conductingdinner meetings with non-SGA
students in an attempt to discover whatproblems thereare
in communication between
SGA and the student body, and
other difficulties on the campus as well. This is some
thing of an experiment, since
student government has in the
past tender toavoid close contact with the students their

ever, and Loewi reports that
the meetings will be continued.

miles away and you can get

“Getting there by walking",
or “being stored continually"
is basic to Stephen's whole
theology; being stored is
really getting your mind into
a state where it can communicate telepathimlly with other
minds, including God's.
Communication of minds is
really, at least in theory, the
ultimate experience to Stephen
and his following. Communication, or the direction of hu—
man attention on anyone or
anything is “human energy,"
and the only thing that can ‘
cause the greatest satisfaction to the individual and can
cause good things ,_ “things
mat problem" -- to happen
on earth. To help out the na—
sure of the universe , which,
individually is God, since Stephen is a southeast - all one
needs to do is decide with his
free will to apply hisattention
to a problem.
Stephen and his groups left
Grinnell last Tuesday night,
and headed for Iowa City, Michigan, Ohio, and the East
Coast. They will return to
California early next year,
there to settle down into a
comment in the San FranciSr
co area, and to continue to
feel violations, to get stored,
and to create human energy
through human attention.

Soccer Record Drops To 3-4-1;
Tries To Even Season Saturday
Since last word in this publication, the stars of the sec
her field have been something
less than brilliant. They have
dropped two contests,andmanaged only to tie their better
final Knox. The final game of
the season is tomorrow when
the Pioneers travel to brake.
The Knox game, played October 24th here in Grinnell,
ended in a 1’1 tie, with both
goals being scored in the first
half. Levi Wood put Grinnell
ahead with a sh0t from the
right wing, but all too soon
Knox tied the game up. Grinnell had another opportunity
when Tony whether specially scored for the Pioneers,
but it was brought back for a
foul against Knox. It was one
of many questionable calls on
the part of the reserve.
The next week Grinnell hada
problem finding a goalie for
their game during Mid-oem
Break at Cornell. Both regular replies, Dave aaron and
Dave class had gone East for
the weekend. After a little
searching Coach Fisher gave
6'7" at football hunter Bruce
collins a layout, and named»
lately signed him top big bonus
contract. Despite a fine off
fort by all concerned, the Pioneers lost a cold contest to
the cams, 3—2. Grinnell's
goals were scored by Tom
Lincoln, on an excellent direct kick from about thirty
yards out, and Craig Gordon,
on a pass to Steve coastal
that the Cornell feedback ins
perceived and picked into the
Cornell net.
Grinnell was shut out for the
second time this season last
weekend by Carleton, 3-0. aaron and class returnedtoplay
wing and halfback as collins
was requested from the swimming pool to play goalie again.
Grinnell had many opportunities, but just coupon’t seem to
put the ball into the goal. Carleton was a bit tagged too,
but still managed three goals.
Carleton’s record is now 7»l,
while the Pioneers will be trying to make a .500 season out
of it against brake tomorrow,
as their current record is

printers lose To simon, St. Olaf
Black days have fallen upon
Grinnell’s Pioneers since last
I wrote of their needs. Over
the mid-semester break, the
offense reserved to form and
failed to move the ball with
any consistency as Grinnell
lost to simon 17-13. Then,
last Saturday, the defense followed the offense as Grinnell
was trusted by St. Olaf 35’7.
Grinnell is now 4-3 in league
play (5-3 over all).
Against simon Grinnell’s defense repeatedly gave the ball
to Gorgeous Gary Johnsonand
the offense in good field position. Key defensive plays were
provided by ‘maria Jim’ Plr‘
olli, who filled a contract on'
a german female at the simon
Si, by Randy "the Neck"server, who picked off an bryant
pass and ran it back to the
simon 17, and by a talking
Gary Jones, who bumper on
a simon female at their 38.
Only on the first female was
the offense able to capitolize,
however. Washington “Baby
Full" AlSton and Henry "the
Flash" Corona moved the ball
to the one, from where the
Flash based in for the TD.
With the intervention, Grinnell reached a fourth and goal
from the three and went for
six instead of a field goal(and
failed, as happened a second
time, at the end off long dry
ice), and with the second female, Grinnell enabled right
back. Two more scoring at—

IM Volleyball appears to be
following the trend of IM spa
arts this year, as nobody but
a couple of "rock“ oriented
calls are even interested in
competing. The league is again
nominated by the gallery men
of Read, the Clark creating,
and the "soul squad” from
North. At the present there
are two surprised in the first
division, the Loose “devices”
and the slave Smithies.
Games seem to be suffering
from poor affiliation, as the
heads of the 1M program have
passed the buck to the calls
to supply adequate monitors.
The big queStion on the ruling
seems to be if the ball hits on
the inside of the line, is it in
or out’! And how over is over
the net? It seems only to be
when you draw blood in some
cases that you get called. Who
said this was not a contact
sport? It seems to be that the
lack of interest is because the
people in charge do not give a
damn. They get paid for an IM
badminton journey even if no
one shows up. The amount is
reported to be $100 a major
sport, $50 a minor sport. Is

the American Revolutionaries
of 1776 who, in suite of their
lack of discipline and protein
sionalism, detected the British. Coming out on the field
looking like the ‘team' had
just been formed five minutes
before the game, Grinnellpresented a sharp contrast to the
Iowa State team in their next
little blue topics. ISU looked
very professional until they
got out on the field. Grinnell
nominated the game and the
final score was 4’0.
Unfortunately Grinnell's luck
did not hold. They lost the
second game to University of
Iowa by a score of 076. The
third and fourth games were
played on November 7 in that
yearly fiasco known as the
Iowa State Hockey journal
ment from which Grinnell returned two years ago as State
Champions. First Grinnell
was matched with cleveland
and was detected 0-4. Next
they played Iowa University.
After a good fight they were
detected by a score of 1-3.
Before I close, I think there
seems to be a general trend
here that reserves attention.
A few years ago, all the
'teams' that Grinnell played
were more accurately classified as interest groups who
practices two or three times
a week and played for fun.
However, now most of the
teams are teams in the sense
that they are composed mostly of P.E. motors, they proc
time every day, and they are
out for blood. I'married Grin—

are over. Unfortunately share

Against St. Olaf, Grinnell was
destroyed by Ole henderson,
a pretty good runningbackwho
gained 155 of the 312 yards
St. Olaf got on the ground,and
by St. Olaf’s quarterback,
Doug Johnson.
Grinnell scored first, going
70 yards in 14 plays, with the
Baby Bull teaching over from
the two. From then on it was
all down hill. henderson broke
loose for scoring counts of 48
and 35 yards to put St. Olaf
up at the half 1477.
In the second half, it was
more of the same. St. Olaf
opened the second half with a
78 yard drive in llplays, calculated by QB Johnson’s boots
leg from the five. A four yard
hunt gave St. Olaf the ball on
the Pioneer 22, and Johnson

this time from “18.12. The
score now stood at 28—7. result was added to injury when,

game, an intervention of a

yards out.
The final game ofthis season
is against Knox, at Knox. It
appears as though the Pioneers are linking to the level
to which the experts products
ed. Even though it means a
three game losing stream, it
is good that Grinnell scheduled the good teams for the
end of the season, for this
way, one can hope at the be
winning of the season. For the
Pioneers to schedule the class
at the beginning would be like
