meal of carry and rice. Although of Indian origin, this
meal is “common in Japan” a

“We had to remember that
this meal was a mass produced
one. It is hard to preserve the
Japanese flavor of many of our

dishes when served in large
quantities," he explained. “For
the metropolitan Club, the processors who have an interest in
Japan, and the Japanese students we are having a Sukiyaki

Student Wants — Increase?
Last night the Social Planning Board passed the proposed
budget set up by the Social Co-indicating Committee. The approved budget included a fee increase that will amount to
about $8 per Student. For final acceptance of Such an increase,
the budget must pass the senate appropriations committee,
be approved by the Senate, be presented by the administration,
to the trustees, and approved by the trustees. The administration has indicated that it would only consider such an increase
after wide student approval. Thus, at the moment, the burden
tests with the students.
’ It is important that students understand the rationale
behind a-social fee increase if they are to pass judgment on
one. Although it is quite natural for students to impose any
financial increase, it is unusual for a student body to have
the opportunity to voice disapproval before a decision is made.
This alone should make the students mary enough to examine
the situation rather than make an arbitrary decision. ,
’ For those students who have been dissatisfied with this
year's social program, and investigation show there are many,
it does notices as appropriate to question the quality of those
people who degree the program as it is to question the material
they have to work with.
‘ Concert prices have been going steadily up iii the last
three years. The concerts committee has been faced with the
decision of financing Several “lesser" names in an extended
program over the year, rather than throwing the whole amount
behind one big name in the fall.
x Similarly, the committee planning formal cancer reports
that student attendance for a small, relatively unknown dance
band has been very disappointing during the past several
years. They have gathered from the record that students will
patronize a formal dance only if the band is popular. Thus, for
this year. journal dance activities have been posted into two
large affairs with two big name bands.
Social activities in the new Forum next year will obviously demand more expenses than those in the make-shift basement union. There is more to separate and plan for, there is
more incentive behind it, and there is more satisfaction in it.
The Social coordination Committee must find itself in a
quality. It is forced to make decisions concerning the entertainment of the entire student body, yet must bear the print
of student dissatisfaction as well as the knowledge that they
can’t afford any better.
There will always be problems of what to choose—not
everyone can be expected to block to a weekend of folk concerts. Likewise, the influx of foreign films this year has disappointed many camps: movie fans who prefer the domestic
films for weekend entertainment, The Social Committee
should make continuing efforts to give the students what they
want. It Should be a matter of investigation rather than an
"educated" guess.
‘ The students, however, must realize the economics limits
in the cu -ent entertainment fields. They should be willing to
rally around even a financial increase that is directly pointed
at doing something for the students.

[Anku Continues Study of Ghana
By since Anku
This is the second article in
the series of general remarks I
would like to make about Ghana.
Ghana’s foreign policy, which
should indicate Where she is or
is not leading to the East, is
based on principles of positive
bestiality and Strict lion»alignmerit. This policy enables inc
government to Speak freely
about ways or making world
peace more Secure. For example, Ghana voted against the
Russian idea of the Troika,
tried Russia to agree to disc
argument with unions inspection, and in the same General
Assembly voted for China’s
admission to the United Nations.
Ghana’s domestic policy is
based on an encountered democratic system, in which men
can reasonably express their
opinions. Some American news»
men have constantly charged
Nkrumah Wltll trying to certain freedom of speech and at—
teaching to have complete
theoretical control over all
branches of the government. i
personally know that GhanaianS can freely express their
opinions without fear. One of
my o wn secondary school
teachers used to spend a quarter of the period each day bite
terry criticizing the government. He even Called the Pros
event a “tortoiserheaded fool”
on a number of occasions, but
he is not in all,
Anyone in Ghana can critical as much as he wants,
However, if he commons semi-
 
tion, lie is procedures in the
civil law courts. No one iS our
tomatically imprisoned for crit<
selling the government, Recent—
ly a commission of artists mentioned the president to seem,
state the Chief Justice after the
latter had been discussed. No
disciplinary action was taken
against them, in addition, movement public opposition forced
the President to english a ten
per cent compulsory saving
law. retention only occurs if
one is planning to assessment
the president or to overthrow
the government by force,
Nkrumah quite often acts
only when he is sure the people will back him. If they do
not, he does not push them too
hard. He often reduces his party officials for their allowance
toward the common people and
cards them that their real
power is derived from the people. If Nkrumah is encourage
ing any kind of dictatorship, as
some members of the Amerie
can press claim, perhaps it iS
the dictatorship of the passes,
This is a possibility in all West
era democratic political systems, as Tocqueville has
pointed outl Certainly, Nkrumah is not trying to establish
an absolutely state ruled by one
man.
The Ghanaian system is not
a carbon Copy of any other type
of government. It is a welfare
state modified to meet the
needs and conditions of the Air
rlcans. Both Western and Eastern systems contain desirable
elements. Ghana is free to extract these beneficial aspects
and blend them with her own

Our generation has experienced few stocks, and none has

perhaps youth felt the blow

Student Wants Better SGA.
Full-Time Interest in Politics
To the Editor:
it is Indeed opportunity that
for most student government is
something to think about only
prior to elections, I suggest
that, if the quality of student
government is to improve, and
it must, we will have to consider changes broader in scope
than those informed by the electoral process. We must begin
by asking ourselves certain
fundamental questions:
ls a structure copied from
the national system really
suited to our needs? Is the
threat of tyranny in our leaders
so great that we must seattle
the system with the corporate
checks and balanced which prevent prompt and efficient ac
tion? And is it necessary to
argument the functions of student government among so
many different cabinets, committees, councils, and boards?
Our present structure is democratic to be sure, if we judge
the democracy of a system by
its renaissance to our American national government. In
fact, we score quite well on
such a comparative test. We
have an executive with a cabinet and a veto, a court with 1‘97
view and appeal, and a senate
with representatives, committees, and all the fits and starts
so common to its national counterpart.
But perhaps this ideal democratic structure is not What is
needed at Grinnell for effective
and efficient student government. Certainly our situation is
easily different from that encountered at the national level,
Our government is faced with a
Higher Good in the form of an
administration Which can overcome and senate its action. In
addition, our leaders lack the
skill, found on the national level, of making a bad system
work well, With a few exceptions, those Involved in student
government are students first
and politicians second
 
To make matters worse, the
attempted animation is a bad
one. Difficulties in the national
system are made impaired in
ours, In place of unified enforcement under executive direction we have constitutes a
divided police force and made
them independent of the president. In place of parties we
have constitutes 3 political elite
which divided itself into two
opposite machines for each
year's election. In place of a
battle-tale press we have constitutes nothing. We hear of irregularities in student government only when one fiction
becomes intended at another,
which is seldom. And finally,
our courts have failed to are—
ate me clear and consistent
legal framework upon which effective enforcement tests.
The very consistency of these
problems suggests that they are
the result, not of involvement
leaders, but of an inadequate
governmental structure. Hence,
better government will be
achieved only by broad structural reform.
It is opportunity that such
reform must eliminate in the
senate, for it is perhaps the
most confused and innocent
branch of student government.
This presents a strange paradox: if the student senate were
effective enough to indicate the
necessary reform, much of the
reform would be unnecessary,
Determined leadership from
the executive and co-operation
by the courts would be a great
help, but the critical support
for change must come from the
student body at large. For as
long as we have a democratically styles system, the deals
must bear a large part of the
responsibility. If We are to succeed in this Herculean effort,
we must be a government of
the many for longer than one
convention session.

long history of annual better
Sing.
First Coed better Sing ts Scheduled
April 25 to Modify School Tradition
Saturday evening, April 25th,
will mark the 29th annual get—
her Sing. For the first time in
the history of this event, North
and South Campuses have
combined and the competition
will be between mixed churches.
better Sing had its beginnings in the 1939’s when, with
the help of the women’s glen
club, the women of the Quadrangle held annual singing contests. These were held on May
Day, outside of the Quadrangle,
usually on the steps of Main
Hall. John C. better, men vice
president of Grinnell, was enlhusiatic about the event and
wishing to make the program
an all-campus activity, he encouraged male participation.
He donated a trophy for the
men, which has passed from
hall to hall since then. During
the war, when the men were
away, the annual sing lost its
male voices, but was revised
after they returned. better Sing
 
evolved into a Mother's Day
program in which the town of
Grinnell and parents of students
could come to enjoy special
entertainment. More recently,
for practical considerations,
students have felt it; should not
be held so near the end of the
school year.
Since 1935, there has been
some type of intramural singing competition on the print
well campus. The main idea behind the program was to provide an opportunity for students
to enjoy singing together.
During the last four years,
better sing has been held differently each year. This year’s
senior class, as freshman, participated in an all-campus better Sing held in the afternoon
of Mother’s Day. All of the
women’s calls computed for the
South Campus trophy and the
men’s calls computed for the
North Campus trophy. in 1962
the singing competition was between women’s hallsonly, and
 
The formal, party said, was

During me initial planning
last semester for the 1964 better Sing, it was suggested that
better Sing be competition between mixed churches. This
suggestion was met with approval by both North and South
Campuses, and it was announced that better Sing would
be a cold event for the first
time in its history.
Since this is the first time
the program has been held in
this way, certain changes have
been necessary. Mr. and Mrs,
Norman Goodbrod, who have
long been associated with better Sing as judges and as interested faculty members, have
agreed to be faculty sponsors.
Not only have they helped the
better chairman plan creativity for this year’s event, but
have insured continuity by intervention the original spirit of
the event to the students.

for the social coordination committee.
At the present time, the social committees are finishing
preparation of their budgets to
be presented to the social planning board for approval before
being submitted to the Student
Senate. These budgets include
a request for an increase in
the social fee. party said the
increase, if approved, would be
used to improve the quality of
the program rather than to provide a significantly larger
number of events.
When asked about Spring
Day, the social coordinator
said, “There is really not too
much I can say about Spring
Day at this time. There will be
a Spring Day, but we want it to
be a surprise."
Prospects for next year include the grand opening of the
Grinnell Forum, now scheduled
for late October or November,
and an Inaugural ball, if a new
president of the college is
named.
“We would like to be able to
get some people off campus
each weekend to enhance the
program,” l-large explained.
There will be attempts to expand transportation facilities.

handled by the Informal committee this year. There will
also be an increase in the Informal program especially
planned for non-waters.

plans to experiment with seating arrangements in party

SCARLET AND BLACK
Roberts Theatre
By John Wolf
Remains of a stamps forest
that may have covered the
Grinnell area 130,000 years ago
were discovered by Benjamin
Graham (bid) during exhibitions for the Fine Arts Center
in June, 1960.
Last July 4, added by LaVerne turkey (him) and Michael pages, junior, Graham retrieved heat samples from be
death the stage of Roberts
Theatre shortly before cement
was laid over the site.
“Sample of continuous wood
found in the heat were readily
identified as Tamarack,” Graham remained. “There is some
mineral replacement evident,
but much of the wood is in cellulosic form. Insofar as they
are not completely specialized,
the samples are not true vessels.
“Several samples of the wood
are now being dated by the
carbon 14 method. The results
might prove inconclusive, 'however, since carbon 14 dating is
effective only if the samples are
less than 50,000 years Old.
“The samples we have found
“We can’t place the deposits
more exactly because of the
lack of local variable special
deposits from the two most recent periods of graduation. The
Illinoian graduation just touched
the southeastern corner of the
state, while the Wisconsin glad—
nation stopped about eight
miles north of Grinnell.
“Had the heat been described
during one of the other two
recent special periods, the Kansas or librarian, it would
have been fairly easy to date
because of the local sedimentav
tion, often hundreds of feet
deep, which were described
during those epochs.
”From an examination of
golden trains found in the heat,
we have been able to conclude
that the climate of Iowa was
very similar to the climate of
present<day Canada. The species of trees are good indicators
of cosmetic conditions of the
areas in which they are found.”
The heat deposit was actually two feet below the bottom of
the expiration for the Fine
Arts Center and was discovered
only when deeper springs for
bookings brought up samples of
heat. The thickness of the heat
layer is about 1.5 feet, and the
deposit is covered by nearly 16 ‘
feet of topsoil and press,
innovations for the new
Forum did not go deep enough
to reach the heat level, although “what appears to be a
shareware” Was notiCed.
“This shareware would uncle~
date that there was a lake
through the middle of the campus at one time,” Graham noted. “It is probably that this
lake became the stamps for—
est,
“It’s just a reflex action for
me to follow up exhibitions,"
Graham claimed. “standings
for the addition to the science
building could provide additional interesting samples for our
study."

By Susan Taylor
“Ours is a challenge to associate the cause of liberty and
freedom,” Governor Mark Hatfield of Oregon told a Republican audience at the Republican
rock Political Convention last
Friday night, Hatfield was the
keyword speaker at. the convention which nominated a LodgeHatfield ticket for the ’64 election campaign.
“Can we as Americans and
Republicans impose the rising
tide of materialism Within our
society, the version of liberty
and of freedom, in institutions
and beliefs?” Hatfield asked.
“We have to look beyond the
'thread-and—butter’ issues to a
declaration of faith in mesh is
ones of liberty and freedom,"
he declared.
“We as the minority party
cannon be content with being
merely against. We have to
come forth with the alternatives, with a program that presents to the American public a
ositive approach and not mercy a negative attack,” he said.
He further emphasized the
role of the minority party say—
Ing, “A determined, well-knit»
minority can overcome a complement, lazy majority." “documentation is our theme at this
moment."
“Ours is indeed the party of
human rights,” Hatfield said.
“There has 'been an version
here, We can and We should leg»
[state men’s actions to eliminate
discrimination. But we have to
serve as an example to eliminate discrimination at the
source.” He charged that the
Democratic administration has
after against its declared pole
ice. ”We have to do everything
we can to stop the distinction»
ment of those who think the
possible passage of tile civil
rights bill will bring an end to
the evil," he said.
He Called attention to an
“version in our country as to
the moral foundations in our
nation."
“Not what we hold in our
hands, necessarily, but What We
believe in our hearts is that in
which we place our trust,“ Hate
field said. “We have the Cause
and the commitment to replace for America her faith,"
he said of the Republican party.
 
Minority Role:
World Changes
By Ann character
Gale McGee, senator from
Wyoming, launched the Democratic rock Political Convention Saturday by evaluating
some of the changes that have
occurred in the world during
the last four years.
“People no longer calculate
about who will Start the third
world war," he pointed out.
Since the Cuba showdown of
1962, when Kennedy's policy
showed the United States would
risk nuclear war to preserve
freedom in this atmosphere,
“the men in Moscow no longer dare to press a stuff in the
confidence that we won’t dare
to call it." _
The United States has featured the warning of independence by many countries during the past four years. McGee
feels, “The freedom of these
nations is the greatest single
barrier against communist.”
He observed, "Not one of these
new nations has turned to Comv
munich."
“Never has our country been
stronger or order from groups
dedicated to the overthrow of
the government," he assisted.
He attacked name-callingand
handling as “constitutes for
thinking." When a new idea is
introduced, people may call it
socialistic, communities, or
unAmcrican without trying to
understand it.
“minerals wrote the Declaration of Independence, but conversations wrote the Constitu—
tion,” he stated. “Neither Side
has a motorola on trains."
He called on young people to
meet the challenge of a world
which ”looks to the youth that
is the apartment of our his
tony.”
 
linux City, he was a candidate
for State Chairman of the College YR’s. For the past two
years, he has worked closely
with the Poweshiek County Republican Party, in several campaigns and elections.
Home], Gates, is a member
of the Young Democrats, the
IRC, and the Civil Rights
Group. He is a state delegation
chairman and a campaign
chairman for the Democratic
rock Convention, and has been
active in church and civil rights
programs, on and off campus.
Johnson, West morris, is Hall
vice—president and has been a
member of his hall House Council for two years. He has been
a young Republican member
since his Freshman year, has
attended State YR Conventions,
and helped organize [or the
YR’s in the 7th Congressional
