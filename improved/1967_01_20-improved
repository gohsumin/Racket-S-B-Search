The first edition ol the rain<
targeted Interim session has
been turned a “success" by
Interim Coordinator Rick MacDowell. MacDowell, a junior,
said he felt the recent interim
session (January 9-H) was successful because it “was student
organized and student run.”
Previous Interim sessions devoted to independent student
activity have been coordinated
by the faculty and administration, The last oi these was
held in January, 1965. Lack of
student participation and interest caused discontinuation or
the program.
The program was revised this
year on a voluntary basis under
student control and for a bl’level
period of time—live days instead of two weeks. Students
headed by MacDowell handled
all the organizational work.
About 350 students returned ear1y from Christmas vacation to
participate in the Interim pro
gray.
The program centered around
the forty student-led discussion
groups. The groups each dealt
with one Of the following six
topics: the God is Dead control
verse; Population Problems;
William Faulkner; D. H, Lawrence; Joseph Conrad; and John
Updike. Five to nine students
participated in each or the discussions.
Faculty did not attend the dis.
declared interim
session group sessions except
by special invitation, According
to MacDDwell and some dishes

oi “experts” may have contributed to a more related atmosphere.

evaluation poll was desirable. or
those answering. 94 felt that the
student - led discussions were
worthwhile and effective, while
17 did not. 81 would not have
preferred faculty discussion
leaders and 20 would have.
Some discussion groups accused
such interest that they have
been continuing after Interim.
Other Interim activities includ—
ed coffee hour discussions, the
Roseniield lectures on world
population problems, and social
events.
The coffee hour discussed on
premarital sex proved highly
popular with about 160 students
crossing into the South Lounge
to hear Mrs. smith Ray, Iowa
State University; Mr. Ken passenger, consultant for FamilyLile-Education of Iowa: and Mr.
Bob never, Planned Parenthood Association of Iowa.

By getting proposed open rooms during North Campus Weekend, the means’ Committee has implied its negative position on
the limitation question. it: procedures objectives to open rooms are
automatically independence: mere prior notification is the only
preparation required [or such limitation.
The Committee‘s convention that “the program for the weekend as presented at the meeting did not require open rooms," is
capricious permission oi the intention oi the handbook’s "appropriateness” Clause rather than a certification of it. Students are not
arising lbs the necessity oi open rooms this weekend; they are
arising for an appropriateness which has been traditionally essay
listed. No social event is, strictly speaking, “required," yet any
event is the sum of its parts and open rooms are an integral part
or North Campus Weekend.
Dictatoriul proposition of open rooms is, at the least, had psychology and at worst, a violation or community integrity. Need

and eventual repeat? To deny the conventional request for open
rooms, witch require a bare minimum or planning, on procedures
grounds is to disregard limitation's praisewprlhy aim or encouraging informal socializing on a campus much in need of such opportunity.
The corporations of the means’ Committee decision are all too
clear. The Committee has played its hand # and its trust card
is a Club. If it is indeed the aim of the Committee to “keep the
issues honest" the committee must define rather than avoid the
issues. it it is the aim oi the Committee to avoid generating leg<

A Student Opinion
Perspective
By Grant Crandall
Richard Schneirov
after reading the statements attributes to
President suggest in the editorial oi the Decem
her 2 issue oi the 5&1}, we tell it necessary to reply. in a statement which we decided not to publish, we called President suggest a favourite. Wo
text that his statements on “in logo parental", map
alive, community and student government contradicted earlier statements he had made and statements found in the catalog. However, in order to
be fair to President suggest, we decided to talk
to him before publishing the article. pitch on
intensive, two hour talk on December a, we left
that our original article was an incorrect analysis
of the situation. Because or this interview we now
tool that President suggest is not a favourite, is
not trying to receive the students, but, on the
contrary, is confidentiality trying to fulfill his
duties as president of the college.
The question still remains, however, how
could Mr, suggest publicly contractor himself
so unknowingly? The answer lies in his liability to communicate effectively with the Stu»
sent body. We left our talk with the feeling
that president suggest had been using such
words as democracy, community Ind mobility
very closely and with meetings quite different train the meetings that many students give
to them. For example, to suggest a community
is simply an aggregate pl individuals living
together. He completely ignored the modern
corporation of the term applying a mutual
respect and responsibility among equals. To
Mr. suggest democracy specially has no po—
optical implications. The statement that Grinpell is democratic means to him that all std.
cents are equal and may their to the armenia.
mention about their problems at any time. This
restricted definition allowed suggest to say
that student government did not exist for any
“genuine political necessity" but only as an
“Arena for training."
Perhaps the most basic disagreement we have
with Mr. suggest is on the “in logo parental” is.
sue. Mr. suggest assists that the administration
“define the environment in which the students'
sellregulaung society is to operate." To us, however, it is obvious that however controls the one
agreement will also c o n t r o l the society. We
believe that while the administration can set
guidelines, it should do so only after consultation
and general agreement by the students.
This division on logo pay'enter" synthesis
itself most opened in the pnemarital sex issue.
in our conversation Mr. suggest restricted
that “he did not have an open mind on this
issue." He stated that by this stand he was
saving the students involved team hunting
themselves, their families and their friends. He
said he was looking out for the welfare oi creature students. We cannon agree with Mr.
suggest's judgment on this matter. We reel
that Grinnell students are mature enough to
make moral decisions for themselves. Anyone
close to the students or Grinnell will recognize
that they are making these decisions and will
on largest
continue to make them whether the college
likes it or not.
College should be a place where students are
searching, functioning, and trying out new ideas.
We believe that education is precisely learning
how to live, and that o small, liberal arts college
such as Grinneli has a unique opportunity to experiment in new approaches to living. We can
only improve society by creating a better one
agreement here in Grinnell than we have else
where. In reporting on the engagement for the
5&1} Kathy wagon stated, “An initial goal of the
liberal arts college is to alienate the student in
some degree from his society, by pointing to the
bytes of our culture and the inconsistencies or
our system of thought and behavior.” We don't
want an exact, miniature version of outside sucks
cry with its hate, preceding, and strike, We are
here at Grinneil in search for an alternative. That
is why we disagree with Mr. suggest when he
takes a right, rundcmentalist position on mobility,
and when he says, "if students do not find this
environment to their taste, then the adjustment is
theory, not the college’s.”
We reel that the college should have the ﬂliability to change, Why do so many contributions
and intelligent students choose a small college
over a large university? msn’t one or the reasons
precisely because they think that the awareness
and awareness of the liberal arts community will
enable them to inﬂhence what goes on abou
them, while in a large university they would tee
lost and insignificant? This is why suggest’s autos
primarily philosophy, which is only now being res
sealed, is so disillusicning.
Wc feel that the wide disposition that exist between the educational, social, and moral philosophies or the. members or the Grinnell com.

about which there is great need top better communication and understanding between the

as a potentially effective way
of encouraging students to take
more initiative and get more involved in learning.
The failure of the old interim
program caused many students,
faculty and administrators to be
identical of the Wisdom of the
new program when it first
came before the Senate last Fall.
The old interim program, institutes in 1963, required all
students to be on campus. consequently. many students were
not specifically interested in the
planned activities. Furthermore,
the program convicted primarily
of faculty lectures. Student involvement was by all measures
low.
in a poll taken for the 5&3 in
February, 1965, 3 s o students
agreed with the faculty decision
to drop interim from the schedule and 275 were opposed.
Efforts were made this year
to assure that only those generally interested in the program
would return. The new program
placed emphasis on student involvement in discussion rather
than lectures. This year’s poll
indicated that of those applying,
98 percent thought they generated
from this participation. The 1965
figure for a similar question
was 60 percent.
When asked about future plans,
MacDowell said, “I do not see
any reason why we should not
have an interim next year.”

Southeast doctors Project
discussed a
By BONNIE TINKER
At a conference last Saturday
students from six iowa colleges
discussed the philosophy and
operation at a new project in
Des points.
"The Southeast doctors Pro<
ject,” generated to “The Des
points Project” or S.D.S., originally last summer. Jim Dunn,
a former social worker at the
Wiiltie House in Des knives, our
managed the summer staff oi nine
who began preliminary block
organizing.
The most eligible results of
last summer’s work were several “concentrations." Granted,
the neighborhood still dress't
have a stop light, and it dress’t
have powers, but something
much more significant was at
compressed. Gradually some or
the people in the doctors began to believe that change was
possible, and that they could
help to bring it.
Although most at the small
left at the end of the summer,
the Project continued. This tall
it center a house which the
people fixed up as their “Project
House.“ They use it for regular
meetings or the neighborhood,
[or social anti ‘ties, and for a
weekly medical and psychiatric
clinic started by doctors from
the College ot Osteopathic Media
line and Surgery. A donated
photograph is used to put out
a neighborhood n e w s p a p e r,
“ACT.”
The community, of course, is
not yet “organized” but the
spirit of unity and optimize
continues to grow These people
are no longer talking about simply “improving" their neighborhood — they are no longer going
to be satinﬁed with the having
around the public water though
—they are talking about ending sluts; and they re doing
something about it
There are several immediate
needs at the neighborhood if it
is to develop One is a community co- operating and credit
union The people are consistently telecharger by local merchants, on whose credit they de»
send since they are unable to
get loans from banks and loan
companies.
Another important project is to
get the area removed in the
city’s current urban renewal
plan the doctors area is zones
industrial, although there is no
indication industry would use
the area.
A basic promise oi the End
the clubs Movement and OI
the War on Poverty is that
change must come about pro—
family through indigenous etc
ports. People from outside the
community may contribute resources not found within the
t Conference
community, but the real leadership and direction must be (lit:rated by the neighborhood. in
this context, the conference also
discussed possible involvement
of students in this and similar
projects. it seems that college
systems may function in two
basic ways: they could go to
Des points on weekends to
work, and they could raise money to help finance the projects
Student volunteer work is like
ly to be unreliable, and most of
it could be done by neighborhood volunteers or start anyway.
Financial help is likely to be
much more helpful to the community. Funds could be used,
for instance, to hire people from
the neighborhood as start men‘r
here.
Helping to ﬁdance a project
is not as exciting as running
your own courage, nor is it. as
righteonsly crime as a world
camp, but in the long run it
may be the most significant
contribution affluent societies
can make to developing areas.
There Will be a meeting in
the South Lounge, Monday at
7:00, to discuss the “Southeast
doctors Project” and possible
Grinneil involvement.

“Do you use the folk music

“Absolutely not. The only

“What do you thing are the
reasons for the relatively sudden interest in traditional
folk music?"
“l’ve had that question
asked to me, i guess at least
two hundred times in the past
three years. and I've answered
it in every kind of way but the
right way — i forestry don’t
know. I like old time country
music because to me it’s a part
of the people who, so to speak,
called the country out of a wilderness. . . . Everything they
had, they made by hand . . .
so the music was sort of hand
made. too — just like antique
furniture or an antique car —
you like it because it sorts' has
a personality — or a lot of possibilities put together, . t .
I'd say maybe that the city
folks , . t have the same feeling about the music it gets to
them — maybe they don't quite
understand why."
“What, in your opinion, is
the future of oral tradition
under contemporary commercial influence?"
“Well, that’s hard to say,
because, for instance, the re-
