Since the newspaper Is the only permanent
record of the vital issues that contract us from
week to week, we can all probably guess what
this column is going to be about.
One of the most interesting occupations to
arise from this Week’s first Spring Riot was
that it was “recreation.” Not only that but so
many people were assumed of the entire enterprise that they stated another one the next night,
presumably to make up in organization what
they lost in upon}entity,
It seems that nobody can quite decide what
they want. A ”creative" root would currently
involve something bizarre. like the theft of party
gym. On the other hand, this woiild probably
require a certain amount of coordinnicdcffort.
especially in finding workplace to put it; and
such things are contrary to the Grinnell student's
general independence in thinking for himself,
and thus never getting anything like that done.
Those who somehow managed to get away
with it without disappearing forever can coast
of the day when they not only cut out all the lights
in the library, but also channel up all the doors
and wrapped ‘ everybody inside. Of cause, the
gravity of this accomplishment may be exaggerated, because holidays such an act would im»
prison the entire student body instead of just
the students.
But that sort of thing is contrary to the whole
‘dna anyway A root is supposed to be a violent
order. and so maybe those critics of this Week's
activities can only be assumed of the lack of vi —
police. Mr. garden, on the other hand, can probably be somewhat concerned by inc amount of
violence done his window screens, and must only

The real issue here is the mysterious haiti-c
of Grinnell disorder. It seems that whatever
disorder is created during the day, suddenly
disappears at midnight. Grinncll girls are currently creatures of cabin But because this
patches holes in the earlier notion that people
around here are too independent to function as
a group, we need some kind of new theory for
all future Spring gifts.
1 don't think we ought to take the armenia
'station to heart when they claim this sort of
thing is children A proper mature sort of disorder would no doubt emulate the attitudes at
Carleton. where the editor of the newspaper
suggested a sit-in of all men in the women’s
calls and vice verse. I somehow imagine such
adult behavior would simply be too much to
content with.
So I w’ould like to propose that instead of
one root every year, We take the events of this
week to heart and have two from now on. One
could be a master plot of atlantic promotions.
involving the disappearance of something important or valuable. The authentication of this
enterprise could gradually improve to the point
where a lot of good might even get done, For
next year I suggest a plot to get Dean Wood's.
legendary tape recorder and all its used feels.
The other night of listing would include such
traditional aspects as the reduction of student
officials and the waiting of women’s hours. Only
from then on there would be no threat of disciplinary action, because the student body could
use whatever they hzid stolen the night before
with a certain containing power. lf any girl

Poor Communication Criticized
Delivering the last of a series
of lectures on “The Philosophy
of History,” and using “An Approach Through 2: Classical Education” as his subject, the noted
British victorian added:
“This education in a classical
culture and in a higher religion
has a double advantage. It does
not take one out of our human
world into the non—human
world of process and regular.
This is of great practical value,
because human beings are good
at dealing with human nature.
Therefore, we cannon afford to
reflect the humanities, To drop
these and fly off into physical
science is a form of escapism
and will bring its genesis.
”At the same time, a classical
education, while keeping one in
the human world, takes one out
of the particular contemporary
cell of it in which he happens
to have been located by the accident of birth.

break away completely from

of communication. One of the
things that sets Grinnell above
the run of the mill college is
the generally excellent comment
station between faculty and students. There are, as i see it, no
great streaming blocks in the
path of faculty-administration
c o m m u mention. Unfortunately,
there is no communication between the students and the administration.
How might a student at Grinneil communicate to the ad
registration? There seems to be
only one avenue open to such
a student, the avenue cl protest.
Since the student has virtually
nothing to say about any administrationul exist, the only
methods by which he can express his feelings
given administrations! policy are
either acceptance or protest,
in turn, there is only one
path by which the administrative
personnel of this college can talk
to the students, And that is the
initiative path, the path of
 
giving orders. As l understand students, but the students have
about any ,
 
the rules and regulations of this
institution, there is absolutely
no provision for either the std
cents or the administration to
discuss, argue, learn, debate, ex»
plain, moderate, compromise,
continue, or be convinced,
Who is to blamclef course,
both groups are at fault, but 1
am afraid that the primary burden of built must fall upon the
student body, Thc administration seems to have made several
honest attempts to open an over

failed to take advantage of these
openings,
What can be done now? Very
,little. it seems to me. The administration has apparently ace
copied the student's judgment of
himself as an eternal pocket. It
is now the student’s responsibility to modify this role. The administration, which has emerald
from this discussion in what is
probably a better light than it
