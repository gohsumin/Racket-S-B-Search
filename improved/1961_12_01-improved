As I understand 1he substance

made of [hair positive position

Not only was it narrowmiinded,
but it was completely topless
and unnecessary. Every week I
open up the 53:3 to page two
only to be created with the
maintenance of John Ward and
his column at loans settings
completely underlying a par
per of the statute of the
Seas,
From Mr. Ward‘s column,I
gather that he is for every minority and springer group on
campus and that the majority is
uninformed and disinterested. I
respectively submit that some of
Mr Ward‘s stones are matching
around in his head. The space der
voted to his thoughts could be
better realized by being left
blank so that each student could
write his own column in his own
paper.
Somehow, Mr. Ward’s pseudointellectual wit leaves me cold,
Undoubtedly Mr. Ward could
lainbast me as uninlormed and
disinterested. but i believe 1 am
in the majority in this case.
if Mr. Ward wniits the school
to go on a hunger strike Supporting the Grinnell Students

The idea of the density and

man the strength and courage
for the tremendous aecomplisliments oi the last ieiv

It is true that many have

To a great extent, yes; however, perhaps ‘to a greater ex-
To the Editor:
On Monday evening, Nov. 6,

discussion was cut short because

The loss of the 5 games is

tent, no. Too often l have sounds
the opinions bring Cxpl'

For every one student who is
generally concerned, it seems,
so described, But, you say, how‘
can 1 say this in view or the
great numbers participating in

they were actually doing.
Many who xprcssed a stand

quainted with the facts of those
issues, or even of the americas

particularly true of many who,
voted in the references.
Again, many who participated‘
following their own pictures, but
rather those of friends who on

those who are simply content to

All those cases in the above 3
paragraph are to some extent ,
beginning to how to the threat
oi our age: that man is powerless and purposclcss. Their 1
stands are more verbal than
personal. Their information is
more guess-work than fact- ,

too much on the voices dietat- ,
illg those interests. l
And this is what the voices ot
nuclear destruction would want‘

This is not to say that we do

of more importance in a liberal
