Trustees Cut Budget By
by Greg further
The days of understanding
have come to an end here, as
they have at colleges and unit
varieties across the country.
The Board of Trustees has
ordered Dean of Administration dildo S. Walker to cut
the college’s Current Fund
Budget for 1971,72 by $336,
000. The action was taken in
order to direct gift revenues
to pay part of the college's
Plant Fund deficit of about
$1,500,000.
This year’s Current Fund
Budget is $6,067,633, the re
salt off much miller answer—
its program than will be ins
statutes for next year. Despite a decrease in the number
of faculty members and a
cutback in student services,
the budget rose almost $400,
000 this year (it rose $450,
000 the year before). Walker
will have to half this inflae
library president in addition
to making actual cutbacks.
The Trustees initiated the
severe authority program because of increasing concern
about the college’s Plant Fund
deficit. They decided in their
recent meetingthatunrestricted gifts up to $600,000wi11be
applied to the Current Fund
budget, but that any funds be
bond that figure will be used
to defeat the Plant Fund dee
first. This year’s Current
DECEMBER 4,1970
Fund Budget includes $966,
000 income from investigated
gifts; hence the $366,000 budget cut.
Salary increases, expected
to total about $130,000 next
year, will be declared by the
recently-announced tuition
and room fee increases, who
ice will net the college about
$165,000. AnadditionalSU students (1250 total) will be en
rolled next year to help alternate the college's financial
problems. They will bring in
an extra $111,000; but a sub‘
starting part of that figure
will go for increased costs for
room, board, financial aidand
other services.
In facing the cutting of more
than 6% of the budget (13% of
the non-salaryportions), sale
her has controlled four pros
blem areas affecting budget
control. They are:
1) ”There has been little
organized program planning
which has taken availability
of funds into account: nor has
there been a seriously organized attempt to establish a
priority ranking of the cost
legs’s programs.
2) "Programs and budget its
sms are continually added to
the budget, even after it has
been approved by the trustees.
3) "Expenditures beyondamounts targeted occur regularr
ly in many of the administrative and academic report
meets at the college.
tools Debate PE Requirement,
Are Told 0t authority’l’rogrum
In its meeting of Monday,
November 23, the faculty
passed very little legislation
of permanent significance.
The Clotfelter proposal's
benefits were extended to Sent
iors and the phys ed requirement was needed in municipal
tion of its sheriff ill playing,
which should come this Mon-'
day. The only surprise in the
show was Andy Loewi's support of the revised require
ment. In an 5&8 interview,
eight days later, Loewi certified his position as not in
support of the requirement
per se, but rather in support
of the intercollegiate athletic
and ontcampus recreational
programs run by the phys ed
departments, which he thought
endangered in the event of the
evolution of the requirement.
He has since beenassured that
those programs are into danger and now supports theatre
action of the requirement.
The faculty met informally
November 30 in ordered listen
to Dean of Administration
dildo Walker's bad fiscal
neWs. What the bad news
comes to is that a cut of at
least $366,000 in expenditures
out of investigated income
must be formed out amongthe
various departments. They
are now to return to the Horn,
have a good cry and figure out
which bone they want to be cut
to first. better, better are the
lessons of conference.

4) “Finally, I do not believe
that all members often faculty
and administrative staff have
taken seriously our attempts
to express them with the critical nature of the financial
condition of the college."
These four major problems
are indicating of the fact that
Grinnell has never really practices budget control before.
Walker has proposed these
solutions to the above problems: l) the establishment of
a faculty Budget Priority P1ending Committee; 2) a deadline of January 15 for consideration of all programs for the
budget, plaza consistency fund
for frequencies; 3) encum‘
boring the budget on a lineitem basis (expenditures be
bond the budget then become
impossible); and 4) an educa‘
signal program to continue
faculty and staff of the seriousness of the problem. All
four suggestions have already
been put into effect.
The Budget Priority Planning
Committee consists of three
faculty members appointed by
the president, Walker and
Dean of the College Joseph
Wall. Victor genetic, Robert
Voertman, and Gene numbers
are the faculty members. There is no student representation, but Walker assists that
there is a great deal of input
of student ideas. This committee will have almost ab
volume power over budget priorities.
The faculty’s commitment to
budget control will be shown
by January 15. Walker has
asked departments to submit
two budgets - a lean budget
and a normal one - by that
date. last year's response
to authority was very disappointing, will it be any differ
ent this year.
The budget cut, though as—
toundingly large, would seem
very much average. Walker
cited a 1968-69 report pre
based by Kalamazoo College
which compared the budget
expenditures of all ACM and
GLCA (Great Lakes College
Association) colleges. print

local, student services and
general administration), second highest in directory and

counseling, extensions 601 or
602, or for in-person counseling.
The center will be operating
under some fairly strict prev
centres: no drugs are to be
allowed in the center, except
in a locked box for disposal
by Chief meters; staff members can't be using drugs
while on duty or on call; code
fidentlality must be strictly
maintained; statistics on each
person seen or talked to must
be recorded. The staff is going to attempt a follow-up on
each problem handled, and
birweekly smallrgroup meetings will be held to discuss
cases.
The student counseling are
organized into two "teams,"
one handling drugs, headed
by Mark Shanstrom and Jim
Tederman, and the other counseling, headed by John Pfeffet
and Ed being. Mike Swacke

plate the Board of Directors.
For intense physics drug
reactions, the center iswork‘
ing in cooperation with the
County Hospital. No referral
will be made either to the
school or the student‘s parents for treatment,andfriends
will be allowed to be with the
patient while he is coming
down. The Board of Directors
this week issued a statement
of purpose which reads:
The involving Door isa nonprofit corporation esmblished
to serve the needs of student
problems, be they academic
or social. It is primarily a
“contact house". By this we
mean that it is not intended
to replace other counseling
services available on menus
and in the community but to
coordinate the use of these
services by making refer-
rats to them when approx—
state. The center will counsel
and/or refer problems ranging from containers to severe
psychological stress, from
academic handles to international and sexual hang-ups to
unavailable drug reactions.
The aim of the center is to be
able to assist any student with
any problem, granted that student seeks help.
The involving Door is also
meant to fill in gaps in the
available services, the most
noticeable being the lack of
any one designated place where students may go with ice
message drug reactions. We
are set up for short-term
counseling with the aim of
having a readily available personal and non-threatening environment.
The RevolvingDoorwillwork
in conjunction with college
and controllers resources,
utilities a referral system
thereby more quiltﬁed personnel may undertake problems of a wider scope than
the involving Door staff can
personally handle. calculations and referrals will be
directed to an M.D., a clinical
psychiatrist, helpful faculty
members and administrative
officials, and other facets of
the present student yourself
ing program-"students as
well as non—students.
It is also the intent of the
involving Door to sponsor one
going training for staff members, and to present and conduct educational resources
and programs to the Grinnell
community'at-large.
The purpose of the involving
Door, as an operational crisis
center, is not to compete with
but rather to coordinate and
complement other existing
programs of this nature.
Faculty Examines construction
Plans For reporting Curriruluni
by John Pepper
and Tim forces
The new semester shouldprove to be as exciting, inn quiet
way, as the current one in matters of academic reform. The
evolution of the phys ed requirement, which may come
within the week, will exhaust
the possibilities of reformbyeabolition- -unless of course the faculty decided to english the current additional,
departmental, administrative,
trading, condition and class
room oriented education systems and starts all over from
scratch. But do not hold your
breath, kids.
The most interesting reform
is to be looked for from the
new Freshman Year Committee, and from the various inter - and A intradepartmental
means, and position papers,
in which considerable more
will be said than has been,
especially on the destruction
ing of the additional classification of departments, which
has been a live if not active
issue since September.
The committee should be set
up and working by the close of
the current semester. Six experimental freshman tutorials
have been accepted; two each
in Science, SOclal Studies and
Humanities divisions. Though
they are not tied to the advisory system in quite the same
way as envisionedby the Jones
proposal, they should give a
fair indication often problems
which the new program will
email.
The evolution of requirements should have aprofound,
if short-term, effect in the
departments most covered by
Dean Joseph Wall
the old core-curriculum sysr
tel.
A droproff of enrollment of
50% in languages and 30% in
Sciences especially at the introductory level, is thought
probably. Other colleges which have designated languages and science requirements
have experienced sucks dropped, and a corresponding increase in fine arts and social
studies courses. it is expected, however, that enrollment
in Science and language courses will, in the long term, return to the level at which they
were prior to the evolution of
requirements.
Some innovations within the
various departments in response to the freeruniversity
group independent movement
(I), the chilly wind let in by
the evolution of requirements
(more interdivisional and
interdisciplinary courses, for
instance), and the new fresh

Swift compared life
by Laura ebook
This interview is the first in
a 5&8 series about programs
available to Grinnell students
who wish to spend time in an
environment different from
their own. The possibilities
are varied, witharrangements
ranging in length from four
weeks in the summer to a full
academic year, in other schc
0015, cities, or researchareas
in the United States orabroad.
These programs enable Grinnell students to possibilities
otherwise unavailable to them
(such as the Newberry Libs
mary, or New York Arts), to
do scienceﬁc research on portion (including the silver
news Field Station in dinner
scta, and Introductory Geology ln the Rocky Mountains),
or to experience the life and
culture of a different part of
the world (Central America,
Japan, or Europe, among oth‘
era). These opportunities are
low the student to take part in
learning experiences apart
from the ordinary classroom
academics and to broader his
comprehensive of the world.
Following is a briefing crime
(ion of a talk with Dean Swift
about his year in Singapore
(sponsored by Don bigger, of
the Education Department),
and how and what he got out
of it.
Dean left for the University
of Singapore the end of May of
his sophomore year, which
was the beginningoftheiratademic year ending the next
February. He attended at the
audit Timah (long Hill) menus (2500 students) which
holds courses in English. ,
The faculty was international, with Chinese teaching
most science courses, write
ﬁitems" making up/the English
and Philosophy departments,
and Americans or American?
educated Orientals in charge
of the social sciences. Alth’
hugh Dean considered the faculty to be quite good, they
taught according to the British system, which is archive
in comparison to the Grinnell
education, and districts the
student’s intellectual development in many ways. Courses
convicted of lectures andheavy reading, with little writing
and no'discussion, all in preparation for a final complex
website examination in each
subject.
There was no contact between students and faculty outside of classes, except for
academic conferences,
cause position and age remain as communications bar
users in the friend.
Yet more important by far to
the ‘success' of his year abroad than academics was'the
experience of contact with the
Oriental culture, which Dean
sees as "dependent entirely
upon the individual."
The student body was made
up briefly of Chinese, with Indians and delays also. The
national groups tender to keep
to themselves, but since Eng“
list was their common language, Dean was able to meet
students of all nationalities.
He spent two of the three
terms in a University form
which estimated "all the one
maraderie of form life anywhere”, although one was com
stanley aware of the separation of social groups among
the students. Another obvious
difference in outlook was the
students’ acceptance of the
existing system. As a group,
"they were submission to the
establishment", and the idea
of report never occurred to
them despite limitations on
their activities which American students would probably
not moderate today (no cold
limitation of alcohol in the
residence calls).
Yet to Dean these dissimilarities were minor, and he
found the sole barrier between him and his fellow students tone theirpreconceptions
of stereotype Americans.
Nonetheless, these were eventually broken down enough‘for
him to “make some deep fri
iendships with Asians", particularly among the Indians.
Women at the Universitywere still "very week and illustrated- -the male being doe
mining normally", and there
was less mailing off" than
at Grinnell. Because of this
Dean felt that an america
woman student at the University would run into difficult—
its of adjustment that a man
would not. She would have to
fight to overcome the lack of
respect for women as integer-

Dean picked up enough "bad
zaar delay” (the universal
language in the area) to get
along with the local people,
and was able to expand his
environment to include life
outside the University. He
found the nations intolerant
of American ”breaks" (except
to boost their economy), and
that although some of the best
grass in the world comes from
Singapore, any native brokers
are social outcomes. The rural
dwellers do crew battle-nuts

the taste comparable, and coupon‘t crew enough to feel anyc

Travel also gave Dean a diff

the people most friendly, and
"the matching was good”, so

norman Says That Experimental Courses Should Be revised
by lnci norman
Recently, Iattendeda center
once on the "model university”, sponsored by the Danforth Foundation. Although th’
are were no agreements on
what a university is or should
be, the gathering was an ac
nation on which various criticisms of higher education
were brought into the open,
thus giving me a chance to
think certain issues over.
Moreover, I am aware of the
current interest at Grinnell in
using group independence as
“experimental" courses. In
some ways, I see defining advantages in incorporating
more ”experimental" court
see in the Grinnell curriculum
and I would like the members
of the college community to
consider the possibility.
It appears that many people
have given up on finding a
suitable definition form liberal
arts education. Rather, the
sentence is to regard orders
graduate education as fulfilling or trying to fulfill several functions at the same
time. Commonly, the campus
is a place Where one an get
the background necessary to
go to a graduate or prices
signal school for further specialized training. recently,
the college offers general edt-
nation in a traditional sense,
which is intended to provide
the individuals witch means of
coming with the complexities
in life and of being effective
citizens. Finally, there is what
some people call the "babysitting” function often college
for those young people who
are on the campus for various
reasons. Among this group,
one might cite those who do
not have limitations of climbing up via graduate schools
or who have turned against
middle class values, but still
interested in some kind of
educational experience.
When one views Grinnell in
terms of the above congratulations, one would likely ads
mit that the college carries
out its functions well in pre
paying students for graduate
and professional schools, and
even providing them withgeneral education in the trade»
signal sense, But what is the
college doing in meetingsome
student demands which cannon be furnished by traditional
courses? The obvious answer
is, of course, that individual
or group independence have
been institutes in order to fill
this very gap. (At this point,
many critical students admit
that Grinnell is not such a
bad place after all.) However,

P
Before discussing some ad‘
packages of “experimental"
courses, I mightpoint outwhat
is generally understood by an
"experimental" course and in
what ways it may differ from
a traditional course. However,
this is not by any means a
right description, but rather
a realistic model which may
be used as a gardening.
An "experimental" course
is intended for a group of ins
divisions with common interest in a subject matter, who
agree to study and come together to exchange ideas or
share their intellectual experience. It is expected that
each individual will contribute to the group main-ring by
coming prepared and participating in the discussions. Ads
mittedly, the loose structure
of the course makes it very
phone to corruption. In order
to avoid this, each person will
be responsible for presenting
the integrity of the group in
so far as it constitutes "a
community of learning". Thus
the faculty member may or
may not contribute more than
others. The bibliography and
the format of the course may
be determined by the students
and the faculty memberacting

meet students' educational
needs. cordless to say, there
will be no letter grades nor
any exams. Although, in general, it is expected that ex?
horizontal courses hardcover
topics net included in the our
riculum, there is no apparent
reason why some already existing courses may not be offered as experimental courses, if the faculty member
and students choose to do so.
The main advantage of "experimental" courses is the
fact that they will constitute
an alternative form of education. The student will assume
a more active role in the
learning process and will
come to trips with collective
responsibility. I do not intend
to question here the value of
techniques employed in traditional courses--1earning from
lectures, writing papers, prev
paying for exams. Such techniques may be quite appropriate for teaching certain dis‘
airlines, and obviously are
well suited for preparing star
cents for more specialized
graduate training. beverage‘
less, traditional courses gets
really give rise to compared
mentalized knowledge, andale
idea of hearings learning experience is secondary to the
purpose, if it is considered at
all. Therefore, ”experimental" courses, if carried out
satisfactorily, will provide a
different form of education-a form which may correspond better to the concept of
an ideal equation.
Moreover, wider employment of "experimental" courses in the curriculum will
make it possible for the col‘
legs to fulfill rather well
what i take to be one of its
functions; namely, education
students who are uninterested
in either “making it" in the
system or going through a
process which subjects them
to constant competition and
impacts on them some “private" knowledge. However,
the establishment ofthispoint,
whether or not the college
should accommodate such
non—consortium students, appears to be thirty as it ultimately depends on how one
defines the role of an educa-
signal institution in the society.
Let us consider, for the time
being, the conservative View
which denied that education
nonrconformist students is a
legitimate function of higher'
education. Perhaps the mm<
'put is not a place for them,
and thus "experimental" you—
uses have no role in the curriculum. If this argument were
trouble, then college should
not admit students whoare not
willing to go through a traditional process of learning.
If the college were to open
its doors only to those who
are interested in concerning
to the system, then it would
become an institution serving
the needs of the establish
ment. Closing doors to nonconformist students would in
fact be like sleeping under
the rug the problems that such
students bring to the campus,
which in turn reflectproblems
not generally seen from the
establishment point of view.
If one of the primary goals of
an educational institution is to
serve the society, then the
university must assume the
responsibility of education a
wider group of individuals with
various interests. Therefore.
the education ofnonr consortium students is as much a function of the collegeaspreparing individuals for graduate
specialization and providing
them with general education
in a traditional sense.
When we consider the scene
at Grinnell, it does notappear
to be a right institution. The
possibility of takingindependent courses and the recent
decision of the faculty to drop
the general education requirements :indicate the college's
intention to provide students
with an education ﬂenable to
their needs. Why could not we
take one more step and use
group independence as "experimental" courses? Ifmore
"experimental" courses were
to be included in the curriculum, not only would the college be responding to the educational demands ofaparticu‘
car group ofstudents, butalso,
more importantly, it would be
offering a different form of ‘
educational experience to all.

Rip-offs On The Rise;

The incidence of theft on the

ls Phys Ed Budget Unreasonable?
by holly and John Pepper
Some rather interesting conclusions arise from the Cole
Iege’s approved budget for
1971-72, which was discussed
at this Monday's facultymeet~
Keepnews: JC missed Facts
Dear Editor:
It's not so much that J. C.
' Iabowitz’s criticism of this
year’s social program was a
case of "matching after the
fact." It’s more a case of
matching without the facts.
The Social Committee is always open to criticism, but
we tend to prefer criticism
that is in some way COnSII‘UC‘
time, and that is voices to us
directly so we can reply to it
or discuss it. Labowitz’s criticism is of the markedly usr
helpful "Whatrisrthlsrshit"
variety (or the “what—is‘thisshit - and — area't - I - cute the - way , I , phrase - it"
variety), and worse than that
it is inaccurate. In addition to
a number of minor inaccurar
lies which I won’t go into now
but will be glad to relate to
anyone who asks me, there is
a major inaccuracy in J.C.'s
representation of this year's
program. I quote: “how come
last year we could get 3.3.,
Pete, Doc, the TSU Torona‘
dos, and severalNorth Lounge
concerts per semester, and
this year we have Big Mama,
knock smoke . . . and only
one or two N.L. cams?” This
year, J.C., We have had Big
Mama, knock smoke, Mike
seeker, Jackson browse, the
East River pathology, the Joe
Henderson printer, about five
North Lounge cancer, last
Wednesday’s folk concert, and
a Black Cultural Weekendwhc
ice included the Pharaohs (for
whom credit shouldgoto Lawrence Wright and to the AfroAmerican Cultural Affairs
Committee, which paid for
most of it). This weekend Fred
McDowell, who is probably
the best living folk-blues guir
christ and one of the best fingers, will be in the South
Lounge, and there will be a
jam in the N.L. Not too many
big names, granted, but bear
in mind two things: first of
all, the really “big" names
(in other words, the performs
era that J.C. Labowltz has
heard of) cost a bell off lot
of money (last year we had
the good fortune to get both
E. B. King and Pete seeker at
something like half their regular prices; nothing like that
has fallen our way this year).
Second of all, it is my belief
that you don't have to be famous to be good. Imaintain that
the above list containsawhole

next semester are the Firesign Theater, the expressions, the kevin wiley banners (who are regularly outer

that Mr. Loewi was indeed

to see the logicofthefaculty's

This means that Physical

Mendenhall:initiative Fund OK
To the Editor:
In the October 16 issue often
5&8 there appeared an article
by J. C. Labowitz concerning
the Initiative Fund. I feel J.C.
had several misconceptions
about the fund and I have fine
ally found it within myself to
respond. Die to the large me
time, it may be difficult for
a full connection between this
letter and the article to be
made, But perhaps, then, this
letter can serve as a general
certification of the Initiative
Fund which might be good to
have in itself.
The basic purpose of the hill
textile Fund has net always
been the same as it is today.
Created in the 1965- 66 school
year, its original purpose, as
I understand it, was the en—
improvement, among the students, of small ”personal"
types of social getetogethers.
Along with the fund was created a committee to approve
specific expenditures from
the fund. Guidelines werealso
developed to give the comment
tee some direction in the funding policy. Over the next couple years. the types of events
funded through the Initiative
Fund were expanded to include
such concepts as transportation to social events in the
area and so on. Its basic purpose, however, of encouraging small group social fund*
tions remained the same. The
major change for the Initiative
find came two years ago and
with that change the fund was
re~defined and given a new
direction which guides the use
of funds at present. '
The re-definition of the fund
involved an increase in its
size to about $5,500. Importantly, most of the increase
came from whathadprevious—
1y gone to individual hallallocations. The hall obligations
were decreased to the old level of the Initiative Fund, a
total of about $1,800. The re
verse] of theseamounts meant
several things. First, calls
would now have to go to the
Initiative Fund for most of
their social events, because
their hall obligations were no
longer large enough to cover
the costs. recently, the range
of events accompanied by the
Initiative Fund wouldnow have
to be expanded to include the
"traditional" types of events
calls had previously sponsored for themselves. Finally,
overall the change meant that
money for certain types official events would be contract
ized to assure better control.
The Initiative Fund Committee is appointed by S.G.A. and
is given by S.G.A. the responsibility to advocate the outdoor
a broad range ofsocialevents.
A general direction is given to
the fundingpolicybytheS.G.A.
approved guidelines. Probably
the most important aspect of
those guidelines is their em.
phases on assuming an available distribution of the funds.
The general outlook of the
present Initiative Fund Come
little can probably be authorized like this. The committee has responsibility to

THE SCARLET AND<BLACK- -«
SGA Falls Into Semester Slump
by Don Dagenais
Since last time news of Sena
ate activities have placed
these pages, the Senate has
been largely practice due to
increasing pressure of academic interests (or so they
claim). Two weeks ago the
Senate held a dinner meeting.
Although the discussion was
marked by a lack of complete
seriousness, the Senators did
show some real concern over
die possibilities of student
action involving changes in the
academic structure here.
Ad how committees to in~
institute various areas of interest were formed. Barry
vegas and Kit Gage will look
into optional trading, Al Cohen and Mike Breed will head
an examination of independent
study, Dave density will lead
the committee on the senior
year, and pda Gudema and Bill
Kilpatrick will head the group
examining calendar reform.
In the following Tuesday's
meeting Greg Vranicar offered to look into course evaluac
tion, and the possibility of
publishing a student'written
continue of various courses
and processors. So far little
action has been mken in these
areas, however-presumably
something will be done second
semester.
Despite staff competition of-
{fred by the production of
tablet on the South Lounge
TV, the November 17 meeting
received more response than
beautifully any other meeting
this year. The entire Social
coordination Committee was
on hand to discuss with stud-
ends and Senators the social
programming, this year. The
possibility of having “big
name" bands was the major
topic of discussion. Ed Lee
line, South Lounge chairman,
noted that such groups cost
at least six or seven thousand dollars, which does pre*
sent a problem of budget lime
stations. Keepnews noted that
negotiations were going on
with several groups (totally
Grateful Dead), but that prices were going up and that
such groups were generally
hard to deal with because of
their life styles (Jefferson
Airplane, for instance, is
"too high.")
One student had reportedly
suggested to the Committe
that Jefferson Airplane would
be glad to appear here again,
since they gave a concert at
Grinnell before they became
famous and ”got their start
here." buffalo ensure.
The Committee“ eventually
expressed their opinion that a
more rational social program
is one with small lesserknown groups with a scattered
variety of styles. There were
no violent objectives.
After a week's large, the
Senators were back in action
last Tuesday. In a meeting
generally marked by a pro
generation of yards, little dis
session, and less substantial
action, the Senate virtually
wanted an hour and fifteen
minutes. They didn’t even put
on a good show for the five
students who attended: even
the jokes were worse than

Holdings In Downtown location
The downtown peripherals
storage area is now open to
faculty and students from 2 to
5 p.m., Monday through eric
day. posted on the third ﬂ»
00:: of the College Office Building at 821 51h Avenue, the
collection contains the lib
mary’s personnel holdings
prior to 1955.
This action follows the investigation often Library subcommittee on security and
accessibility of the library's
collection. The subcommittee
sent a questionnaire to a ran*
dom sampling of faculty and
students, and the responses
to questions about the inaccessibility of the older peripherals clearly indicated a need
to open the area and to provide study room there. The
committee hopes that members of the college community
will be able to browse through
volumes instead of being alleged to orderperhaps ten volumes to find thatonly one code
gains information of use to
them. The move should also
facilitate business at the circulation desk.
peripherals Bank
Students who need articles
from peripherals not held by
Grinnell are tried to use the
ACM peripherals Bank.
The Bank contains the com—
lined geological collections of
the Associated Colleges often

Newberry Library in Chicago.
Students may acquire photo»
copies of articles from these
magazines at no cost.
geological Bank Holdings,
the list of resources held by
ACM, are available in Burl‘
ing, the Science Library, and
in theScience Seminar Rooms.
When a studentneeds anarticle, he should fill out an Interlibrary Loan Form which
can be obtained from the Circulation Desk. Requests are
developed immediately to Chicago, and the protocols is sent
that same day.
Students may also request
resources from Newberry Lie

material.

the fact that Eric Jahn did
bless the group with his ate
guidance, a rare occurrence
this year.
Minor action on severalminor matters was taken. The
SAGA fast this semester, it
was decided, will be held in
benefit of the Pakistan Relief
Fund. Next semester that alwaysrworthy charity, the Rev.
Martin Luther King scholars
ship Fund, will receive the
panties.
Discussion ensure re a possible future references regarding board options. It
seems that some students
(totally the breaks in Conference House) are either tired
of them good ol' SAGA bottles, or are overconfident in
their own military abilities.
At any rate, they wish to be
let out of the SAGA contract
so as to prepare their own
delicacies. This would mean,
however, that board fees for
remaining students would go
up The references, therefore, will ask students when
they or not they would mind

without taking the board of

Grinnell. 3) Most importantly,
because we would function as
a group, the social and intellectual aspects of living and
learning would become one;
whereas under the current
structure of Grinnell there is ~"
absolutely no connection between the two.
After a 35 minute conference
with markers WallandWalker,
it was made explicitly clear
to us, that while our propOsal
was legitimate ”intellectually," we were‘ rejected as a
threat which might encourage
other students to follows sim—
ilar course and transitively
jeopardize the current Grinnell structure, cancer Walker
saved cancer Wall’s day by
pointing out a rule regarding
moving off-campus, and that
was that.
cancer Wall emphasized that
as long as Grinnell College
functional under its current
economic structure, projects
such as ours were simply inc
portable. Grinnell College,
like so many educational institutions in this country, is
having rather momentous financial problems these days.
Consequently, the college
feels it is necessary to refuse
certain demands which might
upset the present structure
and result in the college 105'
ing money.
This brings forth a number
of queStions, the primary one
being the purpose of the college. It would seem, from what
we have been told syndication,
that school is where one goes
to learn things to make
her/him more capable ongoing
any number of things. It would
also seem then,seattle school
would be willing to change if
its students felt they were no
longer learning.
However, we wonder ifthis is
actually the true purpose of
Grinnell College, since it
seems more interested in
keeping itself alive than pro
riding its students within education which educated them.

then maybe J.C.'s primary

At Grinnell
(continued from page 5)
So the question is this: is it
more important for something
to survive than to have value
for the people involved with
it? (or, in other words, is the
primary purpose of Grinnell
College to stay alive or to
give its students something
worthwhile, even ifthis means
going out of business or beautifully changing its way of
life?).
The current situation is not
going to change until students
realize they are responsible
to each other and together can
make the Grinnell games bet
her one. Grinnell minor con
since to separate the finland
body or the intellectual and .
social by relying on its budget.
0f major concern to students
is Saga. If 150- 200 ofus simply
mitchell money for Saga in our
second semester checks, the
school would be forced to absorb the loss and change. The
same goes for B&G and the
library shaft.
Students who believe in integrating living and learningare
going to have to havean option
by which they can attack any
d e sir e d responsibilities.
Let’s learn from each other
and give Grinnell back to its
real trustees; the students.

Ecological Pop Machines Come To Grinnell
Remember how, once upon a
time (last year), Grinnellstudents enjoyed the precious players of soft drinks from menus pop machines? But then
came increasedvandalism and
ecological awareness, and re
member how the Senate banned
those evil machines with their
non- decomposable cars?
Well, week no longer, for
those pop machines have returned once again _, but this
time with new, handy, return‘
able bottles instead of cars.
Bottles are more economics
ally sound than cars; for cars,
in the words of LEAP Director principle Smith, “just go
into a land fill somewhere.”
bottles, however, can be received and used repeatedly.
The Foreign Student Board
will, as before, receive the
 
profits from said machines,
to be used for such things as
providing scholarships and
transcription expenses for
foreign students, as well as
funding the various activities
of the Board.
The machines are located in
six places on campus: the
Loose laundry room, in the
South Campus logged near the
reception center, partner
lounge, Cowles hall, the north
end of Langan pit, and in
counter hall. The flavor see»
actions are subject to change
pending student reaction.
There are empty bottle racks
on each floor, into which students will hopefully place all
empty bottles. Several times
a week these cases will be
implied and returned to the
floor.
The cooperation of all students is necessary in this end
dealer, for the expense of the
bottles is such that the Board
will lose money if many often
bottles are not received. If
too many bottles are lost or
not returned, the financial
burden may necessarily removal of the machines. The
Foreign Student Board until
creates, however, that no such
problems will develop, and
CocarCola and Grinnell can
live in peace and harmony.

orchestra Plans:
Concerts, Credits
The Grinnell College order
extra, this year under the direction of David Wooldridge,
has given two concerts so far
this year. Two more concerts,
featuring consists from the
francisco Trio, are planned
for next semester.
Earlier in the year the orchestra elected a six-member
committee whichhas been dis
nursing such things as posts—
bee repertoire selections for
the concerts and the possible
city of raising the amount of
credits given for particles‘
tion in the orchestra. Presently only one creditperyear
is given; the committee hopes
to have this raised to two a
semester, pending future discussions with the Administration and the Faculty. This,
Wooldridge feels, would help
alternate one of the major
problems the orchestra has
had this year -- lack of attendance at rehearsals. According to Wooldridge, ”an
orchestra must be a team 7*
and any missing member constitutes a real problem."
In a recent meeting the committee considered the various
possibilities for pieces to be
played on the remaining concerts. On February 20, the
Orchestra will feature David
Abel, violation, playing a
Beethoven violin concerts.
The April 17 concert will
feature Nathan Schwartz at
the piano. The orchestra will
also play some pieces by
Wooldridge himself on one of
those concerts, and is planning to play embassy's "cfr
version of a Faun," since a
member of the music department, who is now on leave,
dated the orchestra to play
it, charming that they could
never be capable of handling
it.

Indian classical music to the
people of other cultures. He
has found an audience in Europe, the Far East and the
United stars, and has come
to be regarded as a sort of
musical guru to American listening.
myanmar plays the classical
Indian music known as "Raga

back at least two thousand
years. The ray is a melodic
form on which the music is

THE SCAR LET AND BLACK
Multi-located Poet Presents Work

"Know your placement", the
title of one ofCaroly-n M. workers' poems, seems to be the
theme of most of her poetry,
which she read at a meeting
on Wednesday. Though faced
with violence and bitterly ana
ti-white, her works let humor
and love shine through.
Her poetry deals mainlywith
her relationships with other
people - her mother, friends,
relatives, and blacks in gen
oral. The audience of about
15!) responded most favorites
to her two love poems, as the
thickness of its skin left a
rather uneasy feeling after
some of her works.
Miss workers played some
interesting limitations of her
poetry backed by music, with
a Trinidadian steel drum, an
elephant task route, and an
African chart lending unusual
color to her works.
She read mainly from her two
volumes of poetry, Paper Soul
and Songs of a Blackbird:
(from “I Have Been Asked to
Write A Poem on Vietnam")
"No black man or metro should fight the cookies war
“Cause every time we kill a
Vietnamese
We wider the crack in our own
asset
For the honey to kick his foot
through."
(about a black cop living near
her)
"Some fairy three tar over
him
And he has been trying ever
since
To find something to pretty
black- of "
Besides her two volumes of
poetry, Miss workers has
published Two Love maps, a
followed, and has several
works in progress, one ofwhich is a book on black literary

But how to get to them . . . and
what to do once we found them.
After contamination broadmating generic, Firesigu

decided that nothing college

has a more conscious laugh
than Tiny Tim? Unfortunately
Tim's laugh (the recorded
version) lists only 20 seconds.
The only solution was to play
it over and over 150 times or
so on tape.
Sooooo . . . . .having decided
upon the ultimately assure
jan, we had to tackle the problem of how to pull it off.
A short talk with an unsuspecting psychology professor
revealed that the controls for
the speakers were in the chi—

to get to the controls in the
dead of night. After style tax»
peeing with the lock on one of
the seldom used (and seldom

we managed to get in at i am.
Having requested Paul, an
electronics break, to figure
out the technical orange, the
engineering became but a triple. We exposed the master
controls and decided happening with the lock (so not to
damage equipment as we have
explicit respect for all college property). Paul connected
the tape-recorder output to
the photograph input of the
controls while Bob worked on
a lock making access to the
control room impossible by
any but the three idiots intel‘
red. This was done by putting
a metal strap on the door and
security it with our ownhardened steel look. In the dealtime, Dave, through a series
of barricades made the out»
side entrance to the room
impossible, thus totally selling the room. After numerous
tests and failures we got the
rates going through the speak‘
era (a five minute delay was
on the tape to give us time to
get away).
The volume was up so high

trace the problem. After an
exhibition to get new buses,
we started again, this time
only at half volume so not to
destroy our new, lower coverage buses.
First to arrive on the scene,
nursing vociferously, was
Steve manchester. He shinnied up the fire escape, in
search of the source of the
hazardous daughter coming
from the speakers, only to
find all the doors to the tower
locked, as the operation was
controlled from afar. After
several other onlookers gathered, and a member of the
local constabulary arrived on
the scene, a EStG man, aimlessly walking about campus,
let the excited job into Goodnow, and then to the tower

on the scene under the guide
of innocent bystanders, engine on the group to teaching

Monday's meeting was the
first in a helpful series designed to draw support for
and to crystallize the concept
of what an Experimental Col<
legs is and what it is supposed to accomplish.
Despite the staff of electricity people seemed discussed with, a grain or two of
generation stood out overnight.
It seems that ExCol represents an extension and retirement of Grinnell's already—
existing independent-project
programs. These programs,
as they exist today, are largely one-student operations
which suffer from the lack of
progressive community spirit
and the limitations of singlestudent capabilities for re‘

program is going to be an at

structuring the idea of the independent-project into some‘
thing alive and requesting.
Although the talk is still in
the neonatal stage, ideas of
eight and twelve-credit projects were being picked around. This is a pretty heavy
concept and nothing like what
most of us are used to. Whether or not Grinnell tickets

people are talking about is

This year looks to be rather
a better one for the Pioneers'
basketball team than for the
football team. In suite of the
fact that the basketball team
had only a medicare performance last year, with a lot of
disappointments and games
lost that should have been
won, this year's team looks
good.
With at least four regulars

Greg "buzz Cuz" decimal,

Bob "Touch" current (when
he gets back from his Semester Away From Grinnell,

fine team. Adding depth to this

double duty as a ball man and

upsurge of Grinnell athletic
features, Coach Pfitchhas developed a new exercise known
as the Grinnell Swing. I'll save

The basketballseason opened
with a tuneup at Millikin Unis
version on December 1; then
Grinnell goes to Central on
the 5th. Things begin to get
serious at the Holiday hours
parent at Colorado on the
29th. Quite francis, unless
the Pioneers get upset by their
better rivers, Knox, they should come away with the car
fellowship. Grinnell’s league
season opens in the followed
combines of party symposium
against Cornell on the 9th of
january. Grinnell's firsthome
game after the spring semester starts, however, is not
until February 5, against St.
Olaf. ’ '
Grinnell is sufficiently improved over last year, with
more depth, strong backcourt
men, and a convertible t0rally
dominant corps in the more
court, that the Pioneers should
do quite well against the year
due. It is, indeed, within the
realm of possibilitythatGrinnell could finish the season on
top of the help. The players
have a high mobile, they're
up for the season, they will
win a large number of games.

stroke event. The Tree's
wesley relay was mysterious
as Flecky, bobby, bulk and
girls anticipated their opponents. The enormous Dan
swiss won the 200 and 500
free, but alan was the primary reason the Tree's 400
free relay won as he falsestarted twice. His response
was that it felt good so . . .
The crowd was tremendous
until sitedown started and
then the Tree girls left and
Mrs. Ohermlller remained
along and untitled. Thusly
interpreted, your presence
will be welcome at the swim
meet December fifty at 1:30
p.m. against joe, works,

The goal this year for the
swim team is championship
No. 2 in a row. Being last
year's only Grinnell Conference Team Champion, the
team has to overcome the
same problem this year, the
pool. Practicing in the "big
bathtub" is certainly no pleasure, but as Coach Obermillei: puts it, ”You should see
the looks on the other teams'
faces." The team, not quite
the marketing power of last
year, may have an uphill see

THE SCARLET AND BLACK
pocket, cookies Disappointing
by Ron Medvin
At the beginning of lastsummer, Joe looked got himself
a group suffering about fifty
people and came to the U.S. to
tour the country. They miles
themselves the Mad Dogs St
Englishmen and they decided
to make a live album at the
anymore East in New York.
(What group hash’t made a
live album in 19707) And they
called the album: Joe pocket
Mad Dogs &Englishmen. Wow.
For Joe'pocket fans, this album (actually, a doubleaibum) is a must. For others,
the album has its ups and
towns.
One “up" is that Leon Russell and Chris Stainton are
featured throughout the album.
Other than being a great guitarist, Russell writes much of
pocket’s material, such as
”Delta lady" and "Give
Peace a Chance." These two
songs are among the best in
the album. “Cry sea River",
"Space Captain", “The Lets
her", and “She Came in Thr»
hugh the Bathroom Window"
also show looked singing at
his powerful best. pocket probably has the most powerful
and dynamic voice in rock today. (His mapping interpretation of ”Little Help From My
Friends"~- not on this album
--is no doubt his best song
and is the one that made him
a star in the U.S.)
The rest of this album, however, does not come across,
and if you expect to be overwhelmed, you will be disappointed. Too many often songs
sound the same, and pocket
fails to put forth his best. He
is better live than in a studio,
but he just does not make it
through the entire four sides
of this record. In fact, this
album could be great if they
had left out sides two and
three. One and four are 100%
pocket. A suggestion would
be to see the movie that was
made of this tour, and if you
like it, then get the album.
Otherwise, narrow sides one
and four from a friend.

The music on this album is so

It's not fair to not mention

songs on the album, including
the title song, “Question"
Both his music and his lyrics
are worth listening to: he

he has written all the cookies' great songs. “Tuesday

which is an association which
tries to give help to those interested in eduu-itlonaltheatre
bv distribution general and
specific information about theaters. As for job opportunities, the outlook is not optimistic for actors or directors
but she held out more hope
for technical personnel who
are males. Theatre does have
its prejudices.
BARBARA RIDOUT, speaking to students considering
theater careers, was pessimistic about job important-
ties in acting and direction.

One important question posted to her by Don works often
Theatre Department waswhe—
they a student should become
a theatre major if he or she
was undertake about being
totally committed to it. Be
cause medication to the pros
session and a professional attitude are a must, she said
that she would not recommend
it as a major but endorsed the
idea of students being involved in productions, even ifthey
'are not theatre motors.
At the general meeting, open
to the public, Barbara Ridout
answered, again, the questions about acting opportunities and tried to answer some
questions about Actors’ Equity. She seemed to be of the
opinion that as young actors,
students should portions getting Equity cards until they
have more experience because
joining Equity does not as‘
sure people of jobs and may,
in fact, finder them.
In general, she gave the students the true picture offline
inns in professional theatre
as a career. Anyone interested in information about AETA
summer theaters should contact Jim needed, Rosemarie
Bank, or Don works of the
Theatre Department.
After getting over the facts
about future acting opportunities, the Acting and Direct»

And next week they shall instantly perform their managed
