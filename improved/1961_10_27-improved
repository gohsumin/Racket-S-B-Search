Another isdaimel
In August a Peace corps trained, Charles Kamcn, ins
permitted a Rotary Club meeting at which the House Un—
American Activities Film “Operation evolution” was being
shown, expressed rather opened his opposition to the film,
and provided the incident for a little known amendment
to the Peace Corps Act passed in the last days of this see—
sign of Congress .
After the incident which received wide publicity in
the American newspapers, Con 'resumes placed a ,2 eat deal
of pressure on Peace Corps Di actor R. largest Sh ver to
discuss games, but deliver refused to discuss hill on
'rounds otli than psychological tests, security investing—
tions and ab its tests to determine his reliability for Peace
Corps assignments '
Congress has,expressed its feelings on this matter in
an amendment to the Peace Corps Act, however, which has
received considerable less mention than the games incident. This amendment is a disclaimer affidavit different
‘om treat attached to the National Defense Education Act
of 1958 only in that it does not require the Peace Corps
candidate to deny membership in a long list of specific or—
generations.
Such an path is really of no value since most Conimunists would not heritage to take it. However, much
more important than this is the fact that this law extends
into the very value area of an individual’s belief in right
and wronigr and leads to rebates such as those of the House
Un-American Activities Committee. Although most of us
would object to having a Peace Co ps member who allocated the overthrow of our constitutional form of government,
we question whether opposition to the film “Operation
evolution" or the House Un-American Activities Committee
constitutes allocation of the overthrow of Constitutional
government. The history of this amendment would indicate
Ellis, however.
It is opportunity that this amendment has been attached to a bill which is in all other ways an outstanding"
piece of legislation. The first section of the bill states the
purpose of the law as two-fold: to provide technical aid by
the United States for any nation wanting it and to provide
an opportunity for Americans to better understand cultures
and problems different from their own.
Two years ago 20 colleges and universities refused to
accept funds from the National Defense Education Act on
the basis of the disclaimer affidavit attached to it, Grinnell
was one of these with Bryn Mawr, Haverford. Princeton,
Antioch, Harvard, Oberlin, Radcliffe, Reed and others
Since this is again an issue which will involve students and
an area in which the voice of students is for great importance, perhaps we should'again express our opposition to
legislation of this sort. .
recently, this shows that programs such as principal’s
“Fifth Year Abroad" to which no such calculations are
attached have not yet been replaced by the Peace Corps.
We have already learned that some countries district the
fingering of the United States government in this project,
and it is not likely that this disclaimer affidavit will trade ,
this district. Apparently the work of private organizations
in this area should be continued for some time to come.

albert horse Smith, (modern

ment is Called the “Haus angel”
01‘ house organ because its small
number or pipes and its com—
partners make it ideal for residence installation.
“The design and total qualities of the Haus Ol‘gel are
distinctly baroque, and similarly those of the small instruments
used in Europe during the time
\of each,” Smith said,
The console, or “key desk"
and the pipe case are charcoal black to match the ﬂoops
and homework of the Fine
Arts Center. The keys of the
two manuals are of English
ivory.

Ran Dorr~ (cross country)
“The daily demands of practice

“I believe it is safe to say that
