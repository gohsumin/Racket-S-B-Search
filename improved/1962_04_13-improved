The court of public religion
Last month, bus Hall and Benjamin Da\ . top Ameri—
can columnists were infected and sentences for failing to
make the iequii‘ed registration of their party under the
1950 subjective Activities Control Act. mailing‘ columnists
is» no novelty in this era, but every time the justice de~
comment singles out part members for exemption sun—
night civil libertai and use discussing questions.
Although the Supreme court last June upheld the 1950
legislation by a majo ty of one, attorney John Abt is still
actively pressing the party’s court case. The ai 'event aims
anything' like this. If party members register under the
1950 Act, they subject themselves to proposition lender the
Smith Act (1940) as allocated of “the violent overthrow
of the government.”
In effect. the deliver is forced by law to testing against himself (Fifth Amendment). The high court will
probably have another go at this appeal, but the broader
clips n of free speech guaranteed b_ the first amendment is involved in the whole network of anti—Red legislation.
Professor David Shannon’s assessment of the party
as “the willing instrument of the Soviet Union” is quite
true. especially since a mass exodus of moderator from the
[arts after the Hung ryan r solution left only a “hard
core” of wornrout merchants. Those who defend impressive
measures against these left-every feel no enemy “line”
should be allowed to certificate the air of public life.
The days of a sleeping and absolute attitude toward

at 3000). chi. is the kind of circumstance that should
lead to legal ins; the party, not describing it.
Strategic registration has been security-checked out

tzlge. All the columnists can do is talk mostly in a country
which is quite interactive to their message. every acts can
determine America's national existence but the “Worker”
or the public rostrum of Archie Brown cannon. 11‘ these
tiny Communist “advocacies” become open acts of addition,
which looks rather unlikely, the party should lose its libraries but not until then The distance between “talk and

between democracy and humanitarian store . on of thought.
01' all the Western demographic the U. 5. alone has

With all the emph'asia placed on winning, it is n wonder that no one has yet complaints that the purpose of
the intramural program at Grinnell is being destroyed
For. as Mr. John C. Trucsdole (physical education), directions IM athletics says, “it is designed for all those boys not
in intercollegiate athletics who are physically able to par»
ticipate."
We do realize that each hall has a natural desire to
win, but this certainly does not around the fact that the
spirit of HTS is stiffled in the mardi spring sport, softball.
In each of the other major sports, football, volleyball
and basketball, a simple method of free constitution is in
effect, enabling any hall to allow as many boys as they‘
wish to party page in each contest. Granted, this is more
difficult to arrange in a sport played like softball, but at
least and attempt at a solution should be made. Unfortunately, as it stands now, softball is virtually a terminal sport.
John posted, 1M chairman of Cowles, has revised a
possible, limited constitution plan that could easily be incorporated into the softball rules. However, to hear some
of the other 1M chairman talk, one would think that they
were managers of professional teams who would lose their
jobs if their team lost too many games, especially if the
losses were to the second string players of other hills who
would be given the opportunity to participate that they
would otherwise not have under the present rules.
By posted's plan, five or six athletes would be
designated as special constitutes “110 would be able to
real a starter once. The starter could return to the
‘gnu‘e t a future time. this happening only once. The still
would have to play at least one full ending. When the
starter returned to the game, he would go back to his
ml spot in the betting under to prevent affair
starting of teams in late ratings. Of course, additional
constitutes could replace other quarters who could not return to the game as is the case now.
Only two objectives were voices to the pin The first
was it fear that scoring would become too complicated, but
this problem would be unlimited because the new rule
“ould involve limited constitution.
The second selection was that the plan 'did not follow
the normal rules of baseball. This logic is completely
invalid because there is no reason why we at Grinnell must
allow it rule ncccs y to the press. ioniil sport to interface with our effort to make the 1M program what it
should be, open to all. .
Because it will broader IM’s, Trucsdalc favors the
change in the softball rules, and hopes that a solution
. to the scoring problem will be worked out.
