to Alan Simpson, dean of the

Simpson outlined these

Liberal education, said Simpson, is a matter of intellectual
tools. literary skills, some
breasts oi knowledge, some
grass ol standards, and some
sense or style. “it is the experience which equity a learned to road, write, think, count,
judge, and act _ and tn do
so in the light ot a good gen—

in district ion, in creative
imagination, in logical thought,
and in practical wisdom.”
Bemuan'ing the “version oi the
old standards," Simpson said he
“would sheer-hills saudiﬁce any

courses in the senior year for
one successful course—or expert

llc noted the need for clear
expression in “the must of

non, the melancholy masochism ‘
at Madison Avenue, and the
smog which weekends on orgasm like the New York Times
Book Review."
streaming the need for “a 1d
oral education at the college le
el," Simpson warned of the
“squeeze produced by the collcgeslevel courses in high schools
and the please‘adults courses in
college.
“Let, them (the colleges) by
all means build on better standards from below; but let them
also depend their duty to circle
both the promotions specialist and the future citizen. And
let them inside that, in the fur
turn as in the past, it will

to discharge this duty."

Beyond “exposure to the jul- l

5&1} Sports co-ctlitnr
‘ Flie 8&1} Sports staff super ts the proposed change in‘
the rule regarding athletic eligibility bit Grinnell College.
1 The 1962763 edition of the student handbook states that
anyone is eligible for inter collective athletics if his grade
‘point average for the preceding semester is 2.00 or above,
.or if his cummulatlive grade point average is at. or above
‘ﬂ specified minimum (1.70 at end of first semester; 1.80,
second semester; 1.9, third semester; 1.95 fourth semester;
2.00 from then till graduation.)
 
This requiring is just. slightly ilbove the minimum reliance that will keep a student off academic promotion.
,If n student is on academic promotion and ‘l‘oils to raise his
‘mi its by the following semester, he is discussed from
‘school,
for
, The Midwest Conference committee of facility degree
initiatives and athletic directors voted last November to
lchang’e the conference rulelregarding eligibility. The old
rule, in effect since 1955756, stated that in order to be
.elig‘iblc an achieve must currently be passing in twelve
,flowers of academic work, and that eight of these 12 credit
colours must carry an average grade of C or better. This
comes out to a 1.67 minimum grade point. The reviewed
rule, less specific but on the whole equally demanding.
states simply that anyone who is in school is eligible.
Since there are few students at Grinnell with 2i funny-
.native average of less than 1.67, the new conference rule,
is applied to Grinncll College, is. more strict than the old
one.
Next Monday the faculty of Grinnell College will consider the proposed change of the current rule to confirm
with the new conference regulation and with our nine sister schools. One possible objective to this change, an implied lower g of academic standards. is met, as noted above,
by computing the current eligibility rule with the rule for
remaining ill school.
Studies by ticket Holmes, Gl'innell sports dubai y
director, show that there is no appreciated difference between an achieve's in-season grades. and the same achieve’s.
grades when he is not out for it sport. Holmes’ statistical
data effectively met the argument that a original accident
,nlny be pushed over the point of no return by participation
in sports.
Recently the “faculty approved another new rule stating that any achieve eligible at the beginning of a sports
season would be allowed to finish that season. This affects
the winter teams, whose schedules span portions of both
computers,
In keeping- with this decision, with the conference ruling, and with the other nine conference schools, ollr faculty
,should vote "yes” on the proposed change.
