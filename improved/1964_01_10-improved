' Jay karaoke describes African Student life A
The tribal people seem to be friendly to the
forbidden. As a friend and I entered one of the native villages which was about two hours walk from
huntington. the people came out and shock our
hands and. we made a _main attempt at conversation. .
We can really divide our students at huntington
into three groups. First, there are the mongolia
’students. generally classes as america Liberian
These young people are said to be respondents of
former states, and it was their folk who ran the
country before the Tubman administration. This
term is no longer advised and is embarrassing to
those whom it describes. These students have always lived in a Western atmosphere, speak no tribal tongue, and the folk more is unknown to them. In
many ways they ensemble American degrees.
We have many tribal students who were and
are educated by various missions. These students
have all attended bush school, and know the' arts
and skills taught there. Both boys and girls have
experienced the visual ceremony of circumcision.
.When they go home for vacation, they return to
. mud hits, and to families who may speak little or
no English. These students are stopped in native
folk more and other tribal customs having been
taught by the bush devil himself.
Many of these tribal students strike for an education so they can return to their villages and raise
the standard of living. A few want to leave their
homeland and its poverty and find the excitement
and high standard of living of the Western world.
but fortunately they are a minority.
As every school. huntington has its foreign std—
cents. We have Kikuyu students from Kenya, one of
whom has served five years in a eau~eau detection camp. Most of the students come from colonial
countries, such as Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone.
Rhodesia and maryland, and they feel hosting toward foreigners ln Africa. These are the students
who are likely to be rebellious and lead student
strikes, etc. Still they do send a greater variety to
the African scene at huntington, providing a wealth
of thought that students should imbibe.
Yes, I can now say I have taught a Prince. We
have two printer, one from Nigeria, and from the
Cameroon. The latter, in particular is as country
and countries as a prince ought to be, and he is a
fine addition to my track team.
The students‘ attitude toward the United States
is constantlychanging. They feel that our policies
are hypothetical. They ask why we send Peace
Corps to Africa when we need help in our own
South. When a distinguished man like William 0.
Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
comes to huntington and tells the students that there
is no real racial problem in the United States, and
that which remains is rapidly finishing, the students know he is whitewashing the truth. This does
not build good will. '
Likewise the students’ feeling towards me fluctuates according to the New York Times report on
the racial problem. When Birmingham is in the
news, I can anticipate their reaction. But usually
they are gay and friendly. ,
The students are basically documentation. Each
paper or exam returned that inn’t grades as high as
the student is used to will bring that student for—
ward, not so much asking way, but competition
that he should have more credit. ,Grades are the
prime goal of all these students. Many times talk
becomes quite heated, but usually the next day
there are few hard feelings.
It is more difficult to gain a support with these
 
 
students than it is for a’teacher at home. I have
found that I have gained much of an insight wlm
the track. team as we prepared for the meet. and
now can exchange ideas with these students much
better. My best support has come through my
square dance group. These students feel die most
ease with me, and I feel the most at ease with them.
Students here are serious about their studies.‘
and work long hours in preparation, but their efficiency is low. Reading rates are slow and they
have not answered the art of selecting material
that is important. Their mode of study is organization, and they try to memorial everything. The cry
in class is give us a definition, their purpose being
to have something to memorial. They memorial
specific examples; however, seldom can they transfer the methods to similar problems. Calculus students can work a complex integration if it is presented in a straightforward form, but if it is a word
problem, they can not set the problem up. As for
anything requiring the logic of Western thought—
well, African thought patterns just area‘t logical.
Many of the problems stem from the fact that
75 per cent of the students are working in a second
language. Also the students enter college with a
poor background. Thus education for Liberia on the
primary and secondary levels as well as in colleges is important, and it must be obtained if the
students are going to successfully maintain a post<
tion in the world today. The problem is: how best
can Western methods and African personality be
integrated.
Ed notes This is the final half of a letter
from Travel-Scholar Jay karaoke, who is
presently teaching at huntington College, Liberia. -

Explore'Purposes of Interim Session
By Karen robinson
The end of exams, a week
from next Tuesday, signals the
beginning of the interim period,
a recent innovation at Grinnell.
The interim was one of the
results of a comprehensive curriculum study by the faculty
several years ago. This study
produced not only the term of
the present JLA system, but
also, in an generated suites
tion, the concept of a reading
period. The system as it: now
stands came out of long discussions by the entire faculty
as well as work by several
committees and the Executive
Council. ,
dildo Walker, ‘associate
dean, who is in charge of the
.interim program, commented
“The faculty felt that it was
fairly important that students
do something for themselves
with time breed from the documentation or classes. During
this free time, it was felt, students might explore aspects
of education which could not
be explorer through classroom. The timing of the interim session reveals its non-
course orientation, 5 i n o e
some schools place their
reading p e r I o d s before
exams."
The interim this year will
feature Kenneth Burke, noted
literary crisis, and Dr. forward
Russell Hansen of Yale, as well
as Rosenfield lectures, Stanley
Hoffmann,
Walker noted, “The featured
centuries were chosen from
speakers whom we had heard
were effective on other college

T0,,the editors
Because of the tire hazard
and because of insurance requirements, the Administration has repeatedly asked the
SGA to remind students that
no smoking is allowed in ARH

movies. Although this regulation is posted, some students
still persian in smoking. The
Movies Committee has been in—
formed that this must stop if
it is to continue to show films
there. Unfortunately, this requires that the noVsmoking rule
be strictly informed. In the future if anyone in the audience

In setting up the experiment to test the benefit’of
face guards for 1M football sellers, two methods
might be tried. ,
First, two calls could be given the strings of sellers with the guards to use throughout the season. In
this way it could be directly seen whether the face
guards caused a reduction in the number of facial injuries for that particular hall by comparing yearly figures. An immediate objective to this idea items from
the number of head injuries reported each year. Since
there are an average of eleven injuries a season in this
area, or an average of about one per hall per year, the
fact that one hall may or may not get its quote can
not be significant on such a small number of cases.
The second possibility would be to use the two
strings of special sellers on one field all year. In this
way, one-third of the games (or more if Mac field is
used as the standard) played will involve the use for
the face guards rather than oneafifth by the other plan.
One or two corporations must be made by the Intramural department before the experiment can go
into effect. The IM managers, students in charge of
each field during each game, would have to keep a
close record of all head and facial injuries, especially
the kind that worlds’t be reported to the nurse. The
latter category would include the minor bloody notes
or split lips that often occurs This information could
be briefly stated on a sheet listing name and nature of
injury.
recently, since the face guards do present a convenient hand-hold, referred would have to be briefly
about watching this type of offense closely. A tightening of the rules might also be coupled with this providing for removal from the game of anyone commitment
two such expenses. ,
If the tests are carried out diligently, maybe we
will find that there is a positive correlation between
face guards and fewer injuries.
