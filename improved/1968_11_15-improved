The Monroe Hotel: Fiction, Elegy, and nature
(First of two ports)
By MARK SABLEMAN and
PAUL ROTHMAN
Believe it or not, in downtown Grinnell, there is a
building containing more history and more storybook legend than one would assume
there could he in a town oi
this size. related to be “the
largest wooden structure west
oi the Mississippi” at one
time, the Monroe Hotel, south
of the College on Park Street,
is surrounded by a boutique
that would bu hard to duplicate anywhere.
The Monroe's iii‘st owner
was A Mrs. Gertrude Capron,
better known as “Old Lady
Capron." 1n the 1580’s and
1890's, just after she had come
to Grinncil from her native
New England, she bought in
building next to the railroad
tracks and made it into a ho-
tel. In 1898, she sold that hotel
and built a new one on the
east side of Park Street, between Josiah B. Grinnell's
house and the railroad tracks.
She gave this hotel her said—
en name. Monroe, In 1908 or
1909. after J. B. Grinnell's
house had been moved south
on Park street to just past the
lumberyard, she built an addition on the north of the Hotel
which nearly printed its japan.

Mutiny on the county
While Mrs. Capron owned
and managed the Monroe, it
was a very prosperous and
Well known establishment—in
more ways than one. One student who worked there as a
writer in 19136 and 1901 was
James Norman mail, the write
er and coauthor of Mutiny on
the county. In his autobiography, My Island Home, Hall
devoted a chapter to the Hotel
and his experiences there. He
describes Mrs. Capron as being “around sixtyriive at this
time . . . Her face had the
color or old placement and
was so crisscrossed with fine
wrinkles as to be quite expressionless: but her eyes
were as blue and cold as p0<
lat ice, and her smile had all
the warmth of late aileritoon
straight in Siberian snow in
the dead of winter."
“A Howdy House"
Mrs. Capron’s ownership and
management or the Hotel
must have been a very exciting and interesting period
both for the Hotel and {or the
town. In his autobiography,
Hall relates that the regular

In the allrcampiis references

Now that the vote has been
taken, the proposal will go to

official weight than any other
proposal.
Tom Thomas, SGA President,
pleased with the results or the
voting, warned, however, that
the vote will be meaningless unless the student body acts upon
it immediately. “The vote in itself is northwest,” he said, "un«
less we set up hall judicial councils, determine hours, and take
upon ourselves the responsibility
of dealing with vibrators.”
Administration reaction is expected to since upon the an.
users to two crucial questions.
First, can the students set up a
portable system of governing
themselves to replace the present, unsatisiactory system established by the administration?
Second, under the system, will
the students choose to have
twenty-tour hour opens, and if
so, can and will the administration, backed by the trustee:
and alumni, function such a situation?

theories. He wrote that he had
noticed that the staff of girls
always seemed to increase in
the weekends, but that he just
assumed they came to handle
the Increased number of tray<
using men who came in over
the weekend. The girls were
indeed employed to handle the
extra travelling men, but not
only in the dining room. As
one of Hall’s fellow students
told him, “We are waiting
tables in a buddy house." At
that lime, the hotel had a
widespread reputation (except, originally, in the town
and at the college), and travelling men would make a paint
to be In GIlnnell [or the Weekend. Mrs. Capron had these
girls do everything including
waiting on tables and screening ﬂoops in addition to their
nightlife duties, reportedly
she paid them no salary at
all.
Slingy on Food
From 1898 to I912, the year
of her death, Mrs. Capron was
the Hotel. A very thread person, Mrs. Capron would close
ly calculate the amount or
food that she would need
for the dining room each day.
.Often, the dining room would
run out of food, and in these
cases, the reprints of loud
left on the dishes oi other customers would be served again.
'A point was made or giving
the reserved mod to traveling
men rather than to college
and townspeople. Undoubtedly, it must have been something to see Mrs. common earnings at the Hotel, covered
with diamond jewelry, sailing,
in Hall’s Words, “as she
turned the frank of the cash
register."
Alter Mrs. Capron's death
in 1912, her daughter and sons
in—law took over the manage
ment or the hotel. The daughter’s husband, Mr. Gillord,
was quite a ﬂamboyant char
after and was well known as
a samples. He had previously
owned and operated a salmon
at Marshalltown, and was removed to have killed a man
out tests After the Giffords
died in the lﬂle 1920’: or early
1930’s, the College bought the
hotel and operated it until the
1940’s. During most of the
time oi the College’s ownership, the hotel was operated
by Mrr George l-laser, h susan»law DI the Giilords, and
now the husband of Associate
professor Mrs. delta pixel‘.
In the 1940‘s the College sold
the hotel to Mr, older, and he
owned it until 1959.
Josiah E. Grinnell, when he
founded the town in the 1850’s,
made a compilation on every
piece or property in town;
that it liquid were ever sold
on a piece of property, that
property would report back to
Grinneil college, or his estate.
When the college bought the
hotel, they had that compilation removed from the hotel,
and thus from all other land
in Grinnell.

The limitation Question
On October 28, some of the faculty released a letter to the students
asking for a modification to education, warning that the only hope for
banking lay in knowledge and the
ability to act upon knowledge. The
students have responded by numerous destinations of “home rule,"
-"floor rule,” and, in some cases, destinations of “room rule." The student
government has responded by pushing a proposal which asks the members of each hall to device much time
to establishing rules on limitations until the Student Affairs Committee can
make some official recommendations
to the President of the College.
Grinnell students have not before
shown so great an activity in anything as they do now on the problems
of limitation. Could it be that students,
completely uninterested in a national
election in which all the candidates
seemed maintaining, and uninterested
in the diverse problems of the world,
have consolidated all their attention
on the issue of open forms? Or could
it be that open forms is the only question that seems to have the relevance
necessary to star undergraduates to
action?
The complexities of the open
forms issue never lease to candidate
students—what must be done with the
bathrooms, should girls be allowed‘
to take showers in a boys’ directory,
,what must be done to preserve mod:
esty (though one would think, it
seems, that this assistance on poverty which has led several floors to
restrict bathroom limitations from
members of the opposite sex between
the hours of seven and ten in the
morning is nothing but a residential
bourgeois exhibition), and if the third
floor declared open limitations, but the
second floor does not, does someone
commit an offense by travelling from
the second floor to the third. The
stainless interracial google the mind.
The real of students in pursuant
increased sexual freedom does not reflect a noble liberalism and interest
in the rights of men. It reflects, rather, the spanish wish to ”be able to do
what I want," despite the implications and consequences of such actions.
The faculty letter discussed the
“break prospects” of undergraduates.

gettul of the problems of the world?
The excess idealism that youth is accused of possession seems to be efficient in Grinnell students Indeed, they
would seem to be packing in it.
There is a switched world to execute,
to serve, to save. But the children
here continuously square about the
necessity for sharing bedrooms. badly,
many students have shown their first
real enthusiasm in discussing the interracial of open forms; this “expense
of spirit in a waste of shame" does not
seem likely to end soon.
Library lines
The library exists for the benefit
of the academic community. It is not
a profit-making organization, and it
should certainly not work to impoverish students. Nevertheless, the library's merchants sites of files often
assists in the financial collapse of the
college’s best-gathered students.
The college files is student a certain sum for books which are returned
past the “due" date, and a certain
much larger amount for average
records. The student, in the zealousness with which he pursuit his
studies, sometimes, and quite excusably, formats to return a book. When
the happens fellow has received a notice from the librarians involving
him that the item is average, the student usually returns it with all possible speed.
To fine someone for forgetfulness of this sort is adjust. The library
ought to, establish s grace period of
' three days when a student is free from
files, during which time a notice will
be sent to him involving him that his
book is average. Such a policy will be
available and will help to ease the financial does of students.
New Pencil characters
There has recently been a change
for the better in ARH which is especially worthy of mention. Several
pencil characters have been placed
on every floor of the building. The
characters ought to be an aid in students’ education.
The college should continue in
this installation of needed devices by
placing additional bicycle racks outside ARH and the dining calls.

No Cheers for ‘America murray’ I
llc ELEONDRE SPIEGEL
It would have taken a better
observer than the average
playgoer — and such am I —to detect flags in the acting
of America murray; and since
much of the acting was delta-
exactly exaggerated and ups‘
real, anyone would be hard put
to determine when the actors
furnished their infections and
when they failed, At any rate,
it was the theme which accused
most student comment. But
like the student senate, l do
not consider myself It vehicle
for student opinion; and so,
though 1 heard many different
opinions, I will express my
Own.
The first scene, or act, or
whatever such an absence of
form may be called, seemed to
Show the individual fitted
against “the system.” The four
people trying to get jobs run-
mit to interviewers with plastic ,
faces and answer initial or arbitrary questions. Their despite
ate need for work and their human flight are ignored. Similarly in the other scenes, we
see people who are independent
to someone in need, and customs whichrfoster such interference. Surrounded by these
impersonal institutions and upcoming passes of men, the individual feels lost and alone.
seriously enough, however, the
individuals who are suffering
no industry seem to feel no and
get, but rather built and fear.
Those of you who find that
point puzzling will have to calculate about it by yourselvesi
the play gives no answers,
As the first scene seems to
show what the society does to
make the individual unhappy,
so the second scene seems to
Show what the individual does
to make himself unhappy. The
three main characters are
bound to their TV -—~ that is
perhaps even their job — and
their betty desired. Only their
selfishness seems announced;
lot this they tell lies, use each
other, and almost let one of
their number chose to death.
Never do they think to question
the meaning of their lives or
the importance of their actions.
In them the video of the society, present in the first scene,
are portraits in miniature.
No matter how much some of
the audience may have liked
the third scene, few would be
drive enough to think that it
did not offers, report, or shock
many of the people who saw it.
if the play was not meant for
such people, why women’t they
warned or it, so they could boycott it — surely a legitimate
procedure — and avoid being
hurt? i saw no posters saying
that the play was, quite literally, photographic, and a full,
lacklustre photography at that.
Was the play, then, intended to
shock people? Whether that
was its intention or not, that
was its result. What become:
of the play’s protest against
human interference to human
suffering, if the play itself, by
police or thoughtlessness, produces suffering in others?
One might argue that stirrering is not bad in itself, that the
play certificates something
Valuable at the cost of suffering. But, unless household can
be taught, the third scene adds
nothing to the message in the
rest of the play. Only a man dehumanized by something worse
t h a n impersonal institutions
could think that such violence,
crime, and bestiality could exist in some corner of the universe where they might go unpunished. Letting the characters tear apart the old lady
and the room she represents
and then leave the stage,
themselves informed and rm.
changed, exhibits a false view
of the universe, Yet even if
there is some message in this
scene, how many of those who
were checked by it understood
it? The author points his opinions on an unsuspecting audience in such e way that he
leaves many people confused
and intended, indicating that he
dress't care about other
people’s feelings or about successfully communication his
ideas — in short, that he himself is a plastic person ortho

Nous
Where the Truth Lies . . .
llc DONALD STUMP
This year’s first issue of Nous came out Wednesday, and I
might be described as a kind of generous hodgepodge, an intterdisciplinary tray oi synthetic horses'centres. Inside the simple
and beautiful cover are electronmicrographs, photographs, draw»
inns, poems, literary switches, journal entries, is monogram, a
verbal puzzle, and a abandoned Restoration catch, complete wifii
musical score.
Unfortunately I do not have the capacity in this column in
sample all the delivers on the tray, so i will limit my comments
to the literary contributions. 0n the whole they show more joel
craftsmanship than i remember seeing in most of the issues at
former years. Present in many of the works were two virtue:
which have been, I think, more rare in the past: the attention
given to details of structure in the poetry and the use of well
considered surgery.
It has been the practice in much recent student poetry to d.
spray the integrity of the individual line, either by spiatterln‘
words out on the page I ll Ferlinghettl'ii “money Island of the
Mind No, ii," or else by writing what is essentially prove and
dividend it somewhat arbitration into run-on files. About half o!
the poems in this issue of Nous still follow one or the other of
these two techniques, which are competition represented in Robin Chambers' poem “i stand in the timelocked shadows" and
Sean McCormally's “Throughout the Day." But the other half
of Nous‘ content of poetry is written in more conventional lines
ones divided from each other to form statistical or conceptual
units. For example, Lynn Adams' poem “Anna" begins,
A lady that I know about
Stands on a black railroad platform
Holding the fails of a toy train ——
The sections buried like a bouquet
In her milk—clean hand. (shipped) . . .
It is good to see some thought in the division of poetry lines“
there is a delight in seeing a poet work skillfully within the lamb
nations of a form, if for no other reason than it takes a great"
wilderness than unbridled methods of expression.
A second sign of the craftsmanship in some of the poetry
is the use of the structure to call attention to key words. I am
thinking particularly of Brian harris’ poem “(for Robert powell)" in which certain words are marked by their isolation in 1
line by themselves. For example, powell‘s examined comment on
the relation between form and content is written,
I hate to see it when they do not

The same technique of warning intellectual punch by isolation
words or phrases in used effectively in Lynn Adams' poem “Sam.
one here is steadily breathing," in Charles R. rural' work
“Imagine, it you will, a vision," and in several others. The ulttil-nuts use of the technique is the monogram of the optimal
name, God, which is given an entire page of the magazine. ’
On the' matter of surgery in Nous, r was impressed by the
number of magical moments in which the image served the work
as n whole at the same time that it called attention to itselfa
Take for example a phrase which grades Kit order's lifetime;
protein and forward “Diary":
. . . I have not felt so close to the raw skin of
poverty as i do today.
Or consider holly Wolf's words
"Sheepdogs":
Now close, two streams of due and warm»white fur
speaker to the earth and swift as stores, they chase
invisible sheep, birds, sun and one another . . .
it is unfortunately true that not all of the surgery is so harmonious and well chosen. Some of it is impressionistic, like the
baroque chair which has a value and sleeping role in John partner‘s graphic switch called "The Change is Not New." Other
poems eur on the side at searching the reader with too many
images and thus detroit from the pleasure any one of them might
have produced alone. holly Wolf’s “Storm" sellers from this
mistake. Still other works use widely imagination retailers that
are out of proportion to the thing being described and hence become ridiculous. i fear that Charles R. Burns' interesting synaesthetic “Vision” which is “ring" throughout the universe il
a bit too extravagant to express brief at separation from a lover.
It might be more poetry, and pacific, to miss her less.

Bressler served ‘Good interpreted’
By MELISSA HAYS
Friday evening, a sensitive
artist, Charles Bressler, gave
a concert in which he proved
to be equally at home with
baroque oratorio, German
leader, and English talk song.
He began the concert with
two songs by Purcellt He gave
an emergency condition of the
first, and song the second in a
more hundred tone.
The chamber treat reserved
and received the most enters-
iastio applause
was an area from
daniel's oratorio,
Jephtha. The rec.
items was travis and powerful,
and Bressler handled beautifully the abrupt change to
the tender mood oi the
area. He exercises perfect
control over the long, rising
lines, suggesting the accent to
heaven. A second area by daniel was jubilant and bold,
calling for a wellness of voice
that pressing did not have.
But he song smoothly the long
li lies with difficult leads,
showing again his good const'nl.
Of the three embassy songs,
Bressler‘s performance of the
last, ”Chevaux de Ellis," was
most noteworthy. Underlying
the superﬁdial festivals or this
piece is an obvious tone
which is created by the dark,
automatic messages for the piano and is taken up by the
frontier song about the awareness turning of a carousel.
If the daniel area was the
best periornred single selection, the five Schubert leader
were the best group on the
program There was much variety, some of the songs being
players and capricious. others
being severe and typical. The
serenade could easily have become saccharine, but Bressler
'decided this pitfall. In the
transmit, religious sections of
the piece Where a poster vo<
christ might have been excel<
simply continental, Bressler
song with a simplified that

a word in praise of the accompanied, David harvey, is

the embassy pieces, and he
did, in fact, play them sense
timely. But it was in the Schubert that he was most remarkable, i-lo achieved a perfect
balance with the tourist and
played with vitamins a potentially monotonous accompaniment.
or the three folk songs arranged by Benjamin written,
“Sweet holly Oliver" was this
most difficult, but Bressler
performed it with apparent
ease, This piece was political
—that is, while the tourist was
in one key, the accompanied
was in another. The resulting
problems are obvious, but
transfer‘s innovation was accurate throughout the song,
Last on the program were
two songs by Samuel career.
The first was quiet and peaceful; the second was sometimes
tumultuous and every, sometimes mysterious and super
natural. As usual, Bressler
made the changes suggested
by the text without over—sms
phases,
In all the songs he performed, Bressler's articles<
lion, innovation, attention to
text and sensitivity in dynamics are to be trained. I
heard several complaints that
the minor did not have enough
power to shake the walls. I
feel that what he locked in
volume, he made up for in
control and ability. It seems
to me no more taking to belt
out a song than to sing quickly
in the sustained, continually
charged manner that Bressler
has answered,

POST MORTEM
By JOHN GORDLEY
The unusual nurtrump over<
call is used primarily as a defensive bid to prevent or discuss an enemy contract. It is
traditionally made by a player
holding at least ten cards in
clubs and diamonds, although
it can be used, under special
circumstances, for any two
suits. There are four, and only
four situations in which a no
trust bid can be considered
"unusual”:
l) a direct no-trust overcome
by a passed hand. For example, in the auction: Pass l space - Pass - 2 Hearts . 2
NT. The last bid indicates
length in clubs and diamonds.
2) a jump overcome to two
no-trust: Pass < l space - 2
NT.
3) a not-trust overcome over
an opposite no-trust bid: Pass
- 1 NT - 2 NT.
4) a no-trust overcome after

indicating bids: 2 Clubs - Pas]
- 2 Hearts . Pass - 2 spaces 3 NT.
The unusual no~trust should

situations or it may be inter.

error which results in the most

GRAY MATTER
By BILL GRAY
it is said that absence makes the heart grow wonder, so, consequently, since my column was typically absent last week i
suppose everyone is elderly training its arrival. '
The most popular sport so far appears to be a new game
which is called musical opens. it is very similar to the game we
all played in kindergarten called musical chairs with the sole exception being that musical chairs had rules. While I am, admittedly, on the outside looking in, i think the object of the game is u:
have each floor in each hall determine its own rules for the game
in order to prove conclusively that people are different Such being
the case it is, of course, impossible to have any overall rules since
they would interface with personal freedom . . . or something like
that. I obviously don't seem to have the hang of the game but
you can be sure i am making every effort to learn the rules, or
anti-rules as the case may be_ The most interesting outcome of
this new passive came about when it was decided that each room
should have the final say in the question, A double was divided
into two rather extreme sections with one rating for 24-hour opens
and tile other for no opens. The listing discussion degenerated into
a street fight type of affair which, international enough, also has
no rules.
Returning to the more familiar sports, Read captured LM1
swimming by a narrow margin over liable. or all the sports,
this one seems to have one of the smaller followings as printed
by the fact that liable took second with a massive three-man
continuing.
I. M. volleyball is in full swing and, true to my prediction
the games are characterized by enthusiasm, desire, and totally
switched playing. At least it has the advantage of being a sport
where physical injuries are kept to a minimum unless, of course
you are rapid enough to become entangled in die net.
I hear that I. M. wrestling is in the office again this year.
Mr_ monkey M. combo has previously connected to teach all those
interested some of the fiber points of this most greeting of spam,
What is most necessary for the success of the sport is, however,
not training but paper bags. The winners can use them to deposit
their cookies in after the match and the 1. M. chairman can use
them to carry home lovers in after their match.
Cindy’s Cinderellos Capture Trophy

At noon Saturday, two little
