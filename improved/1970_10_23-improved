Faculty Debate dogs;

and Tim forces
Debate continued through the
last two faculty meetings on
proposals for academic res
form. In successful weekly
meetings, the faculty has vote
ed down first the Clotfelter
Proposal, then the Noble-Err
ickson Proposal, and most
recently the first off series
of “amended versions" of the
Clotfelter Proposal.
The controversial Clotfelter
proposal to eliminate course
requirements for graduation
was narrowly detected two
weeks ago.
The NoblerErickson scheme
for a requirement based dn
additional distribution necessary for graduation failed largely on the strength of Miss
Noble's referral of her prev
virus position on theproposol.
She argued that the proposal,
if implemented under the current curriculum, would favor
students in the physical sciences over those in the hums
another and the social sciences. This is due to the much
greater number of courses of
fired without prerequisites in
the latter divisions as compared tothephysicalsciences,
a ratio of about 3: .
The first order of business
in the faculty's October 19
meeting was the consideration
of the proposal offered for
consideration on October 12
by Alan Jones (history. The
proposal was: (“Each student
is required to complete the
Freshman Tutorial cross
ram.") appointed to this was
a possible Catalogue describe
tion of the proposed program,
by way of certification:
”The freshman tutorial prO'

in preparing a series of es,
says during the selectér,and
the aim of the program is to
introduce entering students
into a new learning experience
emphasizing independent stud
dy and writing skills. ratios
factory completion of the program will carry four credits.
The tumor Will also act as the
student’s undorclass grades
mic advisor."
This proposal (which shares
much with the partner position paper in emphasizing a
greatly strengthened advise
ing program as a prerequisite to curriculum reform)was
strongly attacked by Morris
Parslow of the French De—
partners who imposed to the
rationale value and midlands
ing language which he processed to quote to the tune of
three or four carefully select
ted phrases.
Jones replied that he found
it hard to believe that,he had
actually said those things,and
mounted in fact that he had.
Investigation showed that he
indeed had not said them.
Jones then said he would prev
some that none of version's
other criticisms had any but
metaphorical substance.
Nevertheless, the proposal
was set aside, and the faculty
returned to consideration of
“modified Clolfeltet proposals" which provide for special requests by the demands
ties division. Proposed were
(1) a "norrcquiremenis"curriculum with a one semester
humanities requirement, and

Why was such a proposition
tested by the Faculty Executive Council and President

several and widespread. The
convention was that opening
the school for an estimated
270 people at this time would
be too mostly and that clearly
opening prior to second semester would involve problems
in housing, food, social, and
educational facilities. Also,
their decision was partially
based on the poor turning at

that four prospective content

Bill Thomas, in an attempt
to extend the Thomas dynamic, is approaching the prev

the greatest political experts

overwhelm his opponents with
his conference. His open po-

against him. He will appeal to
the various radicalrmoderate

He must gain some freshman

Al raymond, machiavellian

more he is known, the less

a show of fingering and power
he is trying to build‘a former

launch himself. He is a black,
and will win the black vote
only if he is the sole black
candidate. But he definitely
will appeal to the pseudodiberal freshmen. Al must work
on his Bill bobby quotations.
Jon klein, politicians indeed

you remember the heartburn,
was Mexican night (one, or

Decisions Come Down
In order to alternate what
they called the “uncontrollr
able” line-cutting problem,
an AdrHoc Senate committee
has calculated the following
rules and procedures:
Only four categories of students are allowed to cutSAGA
lines:
a.) SAGA workers who are
working the meal for which
they accounting. Workers are
encouraged if at all possible
to eat the early SAGA meal
instead of cutting the cafeteria
line. SAGA workers who are
nOt working a specific meal
can cut, but are alleged to
substitute if necessary. Cuts
can only be taken in the cafeteria at which the worker
works.
lb.) “cocks" who have just
completed practice. Athletes
are permitted to cutonlyafter
their practice, and they are
permitted to but only during
the season of the sport in \th
ice they participate. rock cuts
are permittedonlyatthe evening meal Monday through Frir
day.
c.) Those people who have
classes that adjourn at 11:50
or later and who also have a
class or lab that begins at
12:30 or 12:45. Those people
are permitted to cut if, in
their agreement, it would be
impossible for them to wait
in line and get to their class
Political Activity At A low
by Laurie McCallum
With the enrolled “Election
break" approaching, it is
erotic donate the politicalapa‘
thy that is resulting Grinnell.
There appears to be little or
no interest on campus involve
local campaigning as printed
by the problems facing the
Blobaum-forCongress mon
cement now underway. This is,
in fact, the only such move
ment on campus.
‘ Circulars, posters,andreas
rings accused the support and
active participation of around
20 people in the Blobaum mm’
paint for Democratic compression from this district . . .
20 people out of an enrollment
of 1265 Students.
This is certainly a radical
drop in the level of political
involvement from that sure
mounting last year’s monitors
cum and this year's Cambodian crisis. David Landecker,
president of the Student Democratic Coalition, sites sevr
oral reasons for this.
Basically, he says, students
were "turned off" by the six-
(Continued to page 7)
or lab on time after a reasonably related meal.
d.) A person who has a bond
file class or activity which
he will be unable to attend on
time unless he cuts. Such a
student, if at all possible, she
ould make arrangements logo
to the cafeteriaatatimewhich
will allow him to get to his
activity on time without
cutting.
It is illegal for a friend to
according a person taking an
otherwise legal cut. It is isle»
gay to hold a place in line for
a person unless he entered the
line at the same time as the
holder and had to leave mom'
entirely.
Abuse of cutting rules and
privileges is one of the biggest reasons why the cutting
problem is so great. If only
these four categories of people cut the lines, most of the
difficulty would be solved. It
is everyone's responsibility
to be aware of the cutting rules and to efforts the rules
on themselves, and if some
refuse to control themselves
to efforts the rules on others.
Whenever anyone cuts into
the cafeteria line, it» is his
responsibility to state to the
people directly behind him
briefly and politics why he is
cutting. The people who are
directly behind those who cut
should probablyaskwhyaper»
son is cuttingifthe butter does
not volunteer the information.
If students will corporate
with theabove-statedpolicies,
the lineecutting problem can
be solved. Grinnell students
who claim they are adult enough to live together with a
minimum of creation have a
chance to prove it. Let’s see
if we really are adult enough
to modern ourselves.
The a‘b‘one statementwaswritten by Greg Vranimr and
amended and approved by Peter Palmisano, Chris Anderr
son, Kathy Ogle and Barry

policy upon publication‘in Vranicar's episode scheduled for
distribution early next week.
Grinnell EducationCanChange
, by Henry Scheff
Grinnell has had a Free Uni»
version on and off for a few
years. It has always been plan
gued by lack of enthusiasm
manchester in the small number of course offerings, the
small number of students who
participated, and the rate of
failure of the courses. The
present Free University
seems to have fallen into the
some but.
However, this cannon be taken
as evidence that students are
satisfied with the academic
environment here. Manystudents who feel that academics
at Grinnell are inadequate
take independent projects and
group seminars. This consumer much of their time, and
they get credit for these efforts, so why participate in a
Free University? It seems
clear that students who are
dissatisfied are still into going
to college, working for credit,
and getting a degree. Thus,
any meaningful alternative to
the educational process at
Grinnell must work in part
through the institution in order
to win the function often college.
A feasablc plan for an alternative is within easy reach of
students who are committed
enough to make it work. At
present, possibilities existing
groups of students to get cold
legs credit for Group Inde-
pendant Projects. The plan is
simply to bring students her
gather soon to begin planning
a whole series of these group
independence. since old limit
nations on the amount of independent study a student could
take were published at the
beginning of the semester, a
student could continually take
all his work in independent
study. The possibility also
exists for students to get more
than four credits for a single
project if they can justify the
additional credits. Thus, fifteen-credit group independence are not out of the question, especially if they are
interdisciplinary in nature.
What can an emission in
Group Independent Study do
for a Student7 It has the potential of giving him a voice
in every aspect of the academic situation, including designing the course, picking
the processors, picking the
methods, materials, methods
of evaluation, class process

to participate in a timely collective educational expert?
ice. Students may be encour
aged to interact with other
students for criticism and information rather than relying
on the professor for all of
these things.
It is not hard to imagine
what effect this might have on
the college if many students
became interested in this sort
of work. processors might
have to drop courses to free
time for consultation on these
projects, and departments
might have to change offerings
to attract students who could
otherwise do independence.
The end result could bed dry‘
magic change in Grinnell College.
This, of course, is pure calculation. However, at worst,
this experiment will certainly
make next semester more in? ‘
investing. If you are entered»
ted in this sort of educational
experience (and, if success
fun, these projects may be
roughly thannormal courses),
put your name, box number,
and phone number in the box
marked EXPERIMENTAL
COLLEGE in the post office,
and expect to begin to work
HARD after missed break to
plan these projects and make
it work.

Diplomat Visits Campus,
wishes Foreign Service
by Mark Sablemon
aaron Koenig, retired Dean
of the Foreign Service lnStl’
cute of the State Department,
was here Monday to speak on
“The State Department and
the Academic Community."
Mr. Koenig addressed himself to the "gap of misunderstanding" between the Department and the universities
and said that the gap is near
they new nor easily bridges.
Much of the gap is historical ,_ it was not, for example, until 1946 that singles
created the Foreign Service
Institute (FSI) with relation to
the State Department analog
goes to the relationship between the military institutes
such as West Point and Anna
polls and the Defense reports
merit.
The military institutes, Koen
big explained, “train men to
win a conflict when it breaks
out; the function of the SF
ate Department and its train-
‘ ing institute, the F51, is “to
try and pressure that conflict
from breaking out in the first
place.‘I
Koenig emphasized the importance of the Foreign Service Institute by telling of a
visit by President Kennedy
in 1963. The President, on
this rare visit to a relatively
small part of the government,
complimented the staff on the
fine job they were doing to
prepare foreign service offer
cars to understand the countries they were assigned to.

As one step toward bridge
ing the gap, the State report»
ment is giving its foreign

a university, usually with the

Here, Koenig said, the dialog

One such exploration-Residence was john Guthrie,prev

the entire atmosphere was
different.
Defense and headlines
At the university, the Pomona professor said, work is
directed towards the writing
of a paper as an end. /\t the
State Department, however,
it is only a beginning: the
paper must be deferred to all
sorts of experts and committees, and strict dead
lines are in force threshold Men,
the decision- making process.
These headlines,Koenigproposed, constitute one of the
most important reasons for
the perhaps irreconcible gap
between the Department of
State and the academic community. At State, headlines
are opposed by events, and
quick policy making is initiative. The foreign ser
vice officer, who must make
a decision and take responsibility for it, man not take
the time to think it through
as the academics can.
The professor, Koenig said,
is free to say what he thinks,

That gap, then, between the

intelligentsia. Since Russia
has only one politics party,
the intelligentsia is the near
est thing to an opposition. lt
ins what wellington called
“moral authority” in Russian
society. Connected with this,
he made a case‘ for seeing
artistic leaders like Solzhenllsyn as "saints who givemorill nudity" to the intelligent
asia. They can give this quad
llty particularly because most
iii the “saints" have suffered
in government camps. This
turned them of “fear and retailers" and left them come
clearly ready to challenge the
government. In turn, because‘
these people are considered
“saints," the governmentﬂads it almost impossible to
seriously harris them.
This is true because the new
artists have the scientists’and
engineers’ support. wellington claimed that there is a
real threat of dangerously a1relating the technological if
the artists are attacked. Since
the Soviet economy, so dependent on these people, isnow in
poor shape, the government
cannon risk a further SIOWr
down by any action to upset
the technical community. Th—
explore, wellington suggested
that the government will not
prevent Solzhenitsyn from
going to Stockholm for the
Novel Prize. His opinion was
that the Party would disapr
prove but then “look the other
way and take the flat." What—
ever the government's action,
it will give the WeSt a clear
indication of where the Party
now stands on distant.
Besides considering the
"saints" as focal points for
protest, wellington discussed
various other methods of diet
sent. One which he found par
regularly signsﬂint was the
change in the civil rights mon
cement from distribution and
nonymous tracks to sending
signed letters to Pravda and
Izvestia. Such action is less
dramatic but may be moreeffective. The writers cannon
be accused ofattemptingmar»
tyrdom.

n0t undergraduate the power
and survival ability of the Communist leaders;" they came
out on top of a Revolution and
have been there forhalfa century. Still, wellington saw der
finite positive value in what
the intelligentsia has accomplished thus far. He compared
the intellectual to “a gathered
defensive sitemap on a team
that has been constantly detected. Suddenly he series ahead, and while he maynoteveu
score, the spectators are thriller at having something to

wellington quoted one Russian
who said: ”I feel .much closer

Apparently, the intelligentsia

'Kill A break Week’
One of the fraternity houses
overlooking Cornell's football

this as their leading sheer

Homecoming destination; by
those Marxists from Grinnell,
the football Pioneers. The fit
nfl score was windows 28,
Cornell 24.
Things looked break early in
the game for the hairy tion'
ears as Cornell raised the
ball down our threats for two
quick field goals and a 6’0
lead. “Gorgeous" Gary Johnson finally got Grinnell’s offense going with a Screenpass
to “Hurricane" Henry Corona
for long garbage. The polish
quarterback then fired a bomb
to "Jimmy Jet" Pirolli for
a TD and Grinnell was on top
7-6.
After both teams failed to
move for awhile, Cornell find
ally got a drive going and set
fred to go back up 13-7. Late
in the first half, however,
Cornell got miles for interference in the end zone, and
“Gorgeous" mary tookadvarr
rage of this award to ease the
ball in by hanging to Closeline
boston for a touchdown and a
14-13 lead for the nipples.
Cornell then came right back
with what appeared to be a
scoring drive in the rating
seconds of the half, only to
have Nick “the Conservative" pussy interface quarterback Steger's pass in the
endzone. “
At the start of the second
half, the nipples from print
well threatened to blow the
game apart as they scored in
their first drive on a ‘flex-
ﬂpoker’ from ”6.0." to "Hurricane" with ”Right: on" Ed
Hirsch at the pilot. The anarchists made it 28-13 on another bomb from Johnson to
"Jimmy Jet".
Cornell was not to be better
so easily, however. The cams
came back with a touchdown
of their own and added a twopoint conversion to run the
count to 28-21. A fourth quarter field goal by Cornell put
the configuration’s outcome
in doubt at 28-24. However,
in the final moments of the
game, after letting Cornell
off the hook twice on fourth

Soccer Stars Stumble, 7-l Here
Coming off the worst defeat
in recent history at the hands
of Beloit last Saturday, the
Grinnell soccer team will try
to put it back together tomorr
row against Knox. The game
will be played on the month
Street soccer fieldat 1:30pm.
Knox beat the Pioneers at Knox
four weeks ago, 1’0. The game
was played at Knox on a small
and rough football field. Gtitr
well's larger regulation field
may give the phone rs the
necessary room to outmaneur
ver their better rivers. In last
year's game with Knox in Cr
innell, the Pioneers were mysterious 41.
Last week's game turned out
to be an original Grinnell disaster at the hands of Beloit
College. The home fans had
something to sheer about in
the first quarter when Grinnell went ahead on transport
don's first goal of the season.
It took a great fake (he fell
down) before Gordon could
shake loose from the Beloit
feedback and put a shot into the
far corner of the goal.
A goal can often provide a
great lift to get an offense
moving; unfortunately, it was
the Beloit offense that scored
two goals in the next movement
uses, not Grinnell. Beloit led
4-1 at maritime, and Grinnell
looked tired and tagged throughout most of the last half.
The final score was Belolt 7,
Grinnell 1. It was the first
Pioneer defeat at home since
