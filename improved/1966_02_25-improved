Fast Date changed
To narrative Meal
The evening meal last originally
scheduled for today has been contained until March 10, according to
Des points Project Chairman Bill
Downey.
annex said the reason for
changing the last was to save
SAGA a more expensive meal
and obtain more money from the
fast for the project.
Downey Said he was satisfied
with present financial arrangements, but declined to give any
details. He Said SAGA’S Fred logging did not want the exact ﬁgames publicized because of possible
changes. Downey added that the
project is receiving nearly twice the
original amount SAGA altered for
the fast.
The fast, in which over 700
Grinneii students have pleased to
participate, accused some controversy because SAGA agreed to
pay only 40 cents per student, considerable less than it was removed
to have paid for the Civil Rights
Club last last year. Apparently
the discrepancy was due to the differences in load cost of various
meals.

Residence Hall System
the Next Step
1 The next step in the move toward hall georgia—
station was taken yesterday. President suggest sent the
letter that is published below to Jerry forward, Student
Government President.
>i< >i<
Dear Mr. forward:
i Very shortly, I expect to receive from the faculty
its proposal on the residence-hall system, and when I
do, I should like it to be carefully considered by a com—
little of faculty and students, a committee which, in
turn, would make recommendations to me about the
ﬁremoval. Such a committee, which We can call the Ad
0c Committee on the Residence Hall System, is to be
changed by Dean centers, with yourself as ,co-chairman
and to consist of three faculty persons nominated by
Dean centers and three students nominated by you.
Will you, accordingly, give me your nominations, which
you can select in any way you think appropriate?
' I expect that means Slocum and Thompson will be
asked to meet with the committee frequently, and I
think you may want to ask the AWS president, Miss
Chris Peterson, and the Chairman of the House treatments, Mr. Nick songs, to serve in a similar capacity
‘ Hopefully, the Ad doc Committee will be able to
give me its recommendations Within six or eight weeks,
so that a decision can be announced before the semester is over. Work on the committee will require a good
deal of medication and perception, as well as good will
and understanding. I know you agree with me that it is
_very important to the College that the task be done

At a question and answer period
for the two candidates Tuesday
afternoon. Miss Lauterbach was
asked about the possibility of having sophomores as Baffleboard.
She replied that “I worlds’t like
to see the position changed in this
way. Rather, I’d like to see one
good junior battlefield per floor
than two sophomores if there area't
enough seniors available.” _
Another question from the floor
concerned the power oasis of student government. 'The questioner
said that during the campaign for
SGA providence it was pointed out
that the power basis, for student
government was the power to quit
enhancing rules. Lauterbach was
asked what issues were important
enough to merit the use of this
power, l-her answer was that the
step was "plastic” and she “hoped
it won't be used.”

Will Be Williams' ‘Glass Menagerie’
Henry - York cleaner is direction
an independent theatre project this
semester, The Glass Menagerie.
Th'i'e cast is karen Zimmerman as
Amanda sheffield; Ken picks and
newbie Abbott as Amanda’s children Tom and Laura; and Chuck
Burns as Jim, the gentleman called.
The play is set in St. Louis, now
and the past. Tennessee Williams
describes his characters in the
following way:
Amanda - “A little woman oi
great but confused vitamins changing beautifully to another time
and place.”
Laura - “Laura's separation
(from reality) increases till she is
like a piece or her own glass col-
section, too exclusively profile to
move from the shelf.”
Tom - ”A poet with a job in a
warehouse. His nature is not.re-‘
ourselves, but to escape from I
trap he has to act without city."
Jim - “A nice, ordinary, young
man.”
The action centers around Amanda's desperate attempts to
hold on to the past, She tries to
remove her life as a vacations belle
through her she. compiled daughter, telling her that she is not really
compiled, but only has a “slight
determine". She asks, “So what
are we going to do the rest of our
lives? Stay home and watch the
parties go by? house ourselves
