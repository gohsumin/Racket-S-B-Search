The effect of the faculty’s
action on presently enrolled

the possible exception of seniors, will be able to choose
which set advertisements they
would like to complete. In ad
action, it is unlikely that any

Andy Loewi, SGA president,
opened the meeting within effective speech on the “grave

crisis" he perceived at Grinnell. He said that many fraser
men were considering leaving
because the education being
offered was not meaningful to
them. He quoted from a book
that failed curriculum debate
by societies a “great indoor
sport" with little meaning for
students. He tried the imme
diane adoption of the galleries- Clotfelter proposal, but
with tutorials for the first
semester only. It was later
agreed that that issue could
be resolved at a later date.

Trustees Hear prices, Suggestions
by Jim Alt
The Grinnell Board of Trustees met on campus last Saturday and Sunday to handle
routine business and to meet
with administrators, faculty,
and student leaders. Two of
their meetings were informal
gatherings open to the student
body at large.
Chairman Lawrence Keeney
contents the first closedmeeting in nursing viewing room
at 1:45 Saturday afternoon.
The executive council of the
faculty, executive cabinet of
SGA, President suggest and
other administrators attended
in addition to about 20 trustees.
After the innovation, a number of routine votes were ta—
ken. Appointments of partner
SGA PRESIDENT Andy
button, George brake, and
Theodore poverty as trustees
were formalized, as was the
promotion of delta river
(communications) to full professor and printing of centre
to Louis circle (art). The [r’
ustees also approved printing
an contrary degree to Norman Borlaug, recent hotel
peace prize recipient.
President suggest next pre
center a report on the
college's year to date. He
spoke of the overcrowding in
housing this year and noted
that the formula used to esti‘
mate enrollment had proven
inaccurate. He observed,
“The students were reasonably good-natural about it,"
but that “this is really more

fundamental about housing."
suggest outlined the [Owl'r
down movement and toldabout
Community Day. Speaking of
the first meeting, he commented, "It did clear the air ...”
He told the trustees that the
public newspaper account of
the meeting was less than favorites, saying that "It was
written in a rather steering
tone . . . which was more or
less the point of the whole
article." He said that, on the
whole, community‘reaction to
the [OWl'rgOWn meetings was
good.
suggest also mentioned the
class agents' return to campus in September, saying that
"In some ways items the most
successful meeting of alumni
I've ever seen on a campus."
He described Guru Steve's
recent visit to campus, and
said seattle Women's Lib conference lastweekendwas "rather spectacularlywell orgasm
ized."
The president touched onaih’
lyrics, and said that the foot
ball team "ms much more
successful than anyone thought
it would be." He noted that
average attendance was up to
1500.
suggest spoke on Dean Wall’s
new book on Andrew Carnegie, calling its favorites reception "in some lenses the
most educational news of the
fall." He read a review from
the current New worker and
commented that Wall may be
considered for certain literary awards. Wall was absent
from the meeting, watching
his son's last football game
at Cornell.
suggest then remained on the
academic representation plan
which he has been training. He
said that he feels the present
faculty organization is not as
efficient as it might be and
that the executive council is
overworked. He added, "I’ve
been thinking for the pastyear
that some way has to be found
to bring students into the decision~ making process."
He is presently talking with
faculty and SGA executives
and plans to bring general faculty members and students

the tutorial program onanonr
required experimental basis
for one year before defining
whether to require it for all
freshmen.
He mentioned two major unresolved questions about tutorials which presented him
from supporting the program
without a trial period. They
were that he dress't lmow
precisely what tutorials are,
and he dress’t lcnow whether
they are possible. Dean Joseph Wall had said at an early
her meeting that 31 or 32 faculty members had indicated a
willingness to teach tutorials.
Kleinschmidt continued that
that was not a sufficient pool
from which to draw a staff of
about 35 motors. (Wall later
replied that he anticlpatedthat
many more would volunteer
for the program.)
William C. belle, professor
of chemistry; brain soldiers,
professor of sociology; Luther E. ericsson, professor of
chemistry; and Gene G. numbers, assistant professor of
chemistry, all spoke in favor
of the Kleinschmidt proposal.
Alan R. Jones, professor of
history, arise to speak with
out having decided whether to
support the proposal. Event-
rally, he convinced himself to.
impose it, saying, “All of hi-
other education is full of une
answered questions; to wait
for answers is to something."
Beryl E. Clotfelter also convinced him self during the course of thediscussiontooppose
the proposal because he felt
that the proper information on
tutorials could not be gained
unless the program were re
quoted. Robert D. Grey, assistant professor of political
science, recorded Clotfelter's
statements; and Howard R.
purple, professor of photos—
ophy and religious studies.
also spoke against Kleinschmidt's proposal.
Robert F. Voertman,profile
for of economics, soldiers,
Joseph D. Danforth, professor of chemistry, and Gregory Guroff, assistant professor of history, all spokeabout
the meaninglessness of the
debate; Danforth and Guroff
both promised to support either the Kleinschmidt or the
Wall proposal if the faculty
would end the debate.
soldiers summer up many
persons’ feelings when he
said, "It is obvious, regard- .
less of our vote, that the fax
ulty is importantly movingforward to something. They will
be voting to end the debate;
not because of any great commitment to tutorials." Guroff
expressed the hope that the
faculty would get on to some
really important topic--such
as the curriculum as a whole
"upon ending these 11 weeks
of debate.
Black Cultural Weekend Starts
Today: "Time Of community”
by Lawrence Wright
Black Cultural Weekend is
dedicated to those lifestyles
that are unique to Black peer
pre. It is dedicated to the en
agreement of Black people in
Black people or, to say itphi‘
losophically, it is dedicated
to our ever greater selfrreae
location of our situation in the
world today. We as a people
live in a time so mad that one
of the primary decisions on
which this country selectedits
President was that he keep us
in our place. Such medication
to anti-humanities policies
will some day doom this planet to its destruction.
We Black people herebyproclaim this weekend, November 20. 21, 22, to thoseforces
within us that expand our humanities currencies and make
us the people we feel we need
to be in this inside world. It
is our primary purpose that
this not only be a time ofcommunion, but also a time ofre—
medication to those principles
which will make our Grinnell
operations relevant to our own
natural environments. So in
essence we are dealing with
our own life styles and the
forces that mold them. And
beyond this we intend to deal
with the nature of structures
which can be elected to deal
with them from our own defined perspective.
Our program will be started
Friday night at 8:00, with a
lecture in the South Lounge of
the Forum by Robert L. Wilv
links. Williams is the direct
for of the Black Studies Program, at Washington driver
site. He is a professor ofpsychology at this institution a]so. He is noted for his numerous contributions to psyche
ologiml literature. He has
dealt exclusively with the black psychological mechanism
and is a prominent of a new
approach to the psychological
problems of Black people. He
will be on menus two days and
will participate in an interracial workshop Saturday,
also to be held in the South
Lounge.
The next thing on the agenda
for Black cultural weekend is
an informal discussion, BlackeWhite workshops. This
situation will be structured
by our next speaker and Prof.
Williams. Leonard working,
who is Dean of Student Services at pursue University,

$175 Jump
In Tuition
A Grinnell education will
cost each student $175 more
next year, Dean dildo Walker has announced. The completed ’ve fee will be $3,700
for tuition, room and board,
compared to last year's
$3,525.
The increase includes $30 for
full board at SAGA, $10 in
room fees, and $135 in tuition
charges. The total will probably make Grinnell the third
most expensive of the 12 ACM
schools, although the increase
is less than the average $196
expected for ACM schools.
The tuition increase comes
in suite of a statement answer:
its program resulting in a
serious reduction of the cold
legs's operating budget for
next year. Expenditures per
student are about $5,200 this
year and are expected to be
$5,000 next year, reflection
a drop in the overall budget
of at leaSt $200,000. Student ’
contributions to this total will
rise from 67% to 74% under
the new budget.

into the discussions. He said,
"I believe that by the mid—
winter meeting of the Trust
yes I will have something to
present that will represent a
consensus of faculty and student feeling." He added that
he hopes to have the plan in
effect by September of 1971.
Because of Wall's absence,
Beryl Clotfelter postponedhis
report on the faculty’s progress in curriculum reform.
suggest, trying to be tactfulin
speaking of the faculty's resistance to act, said, “This is
a year that the faculty is according its right to think otherwise . . . At this point, there
hash't really been anaffirmative vote taken on anything.”
Following suggest's com—
meets, Dean dildo Walker
spoke about financial and phys
final plant plans. He noted that
the college has begins "slight
authority program” and that
faculty, students, andadministrators have reached “available." He hoped that this
year’s budget would come cl»
one to the balance point.
Walker then outlined proposed relocation of administrative offices. Due to the libs
mary's expansion ofmaterials,
the Dean of Students’ offices
are to be moved to thepresent
Reception Center on SouthCa—
mpus. The remaining admin»
narrative offices will be in the
White House, presently used
for student housing. Because
of this change and because of
already wrapped student housing, Walker said that he is
considering concerning at
least two collegeeowned faculty houses to student use.
When a trustee asked what
reaction difficulty nightmare
to this plan, Walker replied,
“The market for faculty me.
myers is now a buyers' market. We now don't have [OPIO’
side these services to get ia‘
multi. You have to be humanitarian, but also a hard-eyed
analyst." He also said that it
is desirable to have administrative offices as close to
campus as possible, rather
than downtown.
the trustee asked where a
new administrative building
would usually be located, if
funds were available. suggest,
in one of his better replies of
the weekend, said, "usually,
an administration building joe
old be over on career Plaza
"on stylish"
Vice President for Business
Don zambia presented a brief
review of the college's cash
resources. A discussion of
funderai'sing plans followed,
during which suggest reveals
ed that “We've sent copies of
Wall's Carnegie book to the
Carnegie and Richard yellow
Foundations, after entertaining that yellow and Andrew
Carnegie were good friends."
A pointed discussion followed on increases over planned
building costs for the PE complex and other buildings. The
conclusion reached was that
building costs have, indeed,
given.

back from an alumni meeting
in Chicago Friday, then spoke
at length. His comments included:
"I think that we've witnesses
on this campus,andnationally,
a phenomenon that is difficult
to analyze . . . Students have
been turning toward. Few students participate in elections
or campus activities (and) fewer are getting into and
emacs."
Loewi postposted that such
student reactions are due in
part to the national mood, but
that on Grinnell campus many
changes could be made to reinvolve students. He said that
students coming from progressive high schools are placed
in Grinnell's highly traditional programs and "are quickly
turned of ."
Speaking of the faculty's work
on curriculum revision, Loewi
said, “Last week, a very innovative proposal (first semester freshman tutorials) was
sort of disastrously undermie
new . . . Frankly, the faculty
has been slow in dealing with
the problem and hash‘t been
aware of the crisis in the std»
sent body." later in the meeting, Clotfelter countries this
statement, telling the Board,
“It hash't been as entirely
one-sides as Andy has made
it sound . . . A lot of faculty
are in favor of tutorials."
‘ Loewi also mentioned pr’stress made towardstudentparticipation in decision making
in some schemes. He added,
"But in the academic sphere
we really haven't gotten to
first base." He said that he
was “initially quite express
see” with suggest’s academic
representation suggestions,
but mentioned that any changes
'0 improvements will not Be
immediate.
Board members then quest»
money Loewi, Bill Thomas,
Greg Vranicar, and Mary browser. Most of their questions
centered around tutorials, re—
apartments, student evaluation of teachers, group independence, and composition of
the faculty.
The afternoon meeting fine
asked with reports by Chris
Nelson and Mary G. Jones on
alumni activities, and by Bill
Deminoff on internal and eye
serial college communications and relations.
Saturday evening
Saturday evening at 8the are
ustees met informally with
students in counters Lounge.
At 8:45 Loewi caught every
one's attention, starting "We
have a list of nonenegotiable
demands . . ." After the eau<
after died down, board mem-
worship and fundrraisingwere
discussed by the group of trustees and about 50 students.
One student asked just what
the Board's role is. A trustee
replied, "Picking the President is maybe the most im,
contact thing," toshiba merge
est truly added: "And getting
rid of html"
Loewi explained theoretical
that one senior be elected by
his class to serve a [W0*y66r
board term after graduation.
He said that such a member
"could provide part of the in
put on priority decisions”and
that his perspective as a re
c'ent‘student could be benefit
dial to the Board.
The Trustees 'seemedrecep»
time to having younger mere
here on the Board, but ObJéC‘
tions were raised about having new board members elected byandperhaps responsible
to a specific consequence. are
usage Warren Buffett, toolbar member of the Board,
noted that in the short [WO’
year term proposed the board
member couldhardly learn the
financial and legal interracial
involved.
Many trustees also felt that
someone speakingto the Board
from outside, as Loewi had
done that afternoon, was in a
position of greater strength.
As one trustee said, “Andy,
we sure worlds’t listen to
another board member talk
for an hour!"
Euffett brought up lack of
financial support from alumni,
saying that only 15% of Grinnell graduates contribute at
all, He compared this with Ivy
League schools where the ave
image is 50 to 60%. Various
reasons for Grinnell's proc
let were suggested, as were
possible solutions. More such
discussions are likely to follow in the months ahead.
At 9:50 the meeting broke up
into small groups again, where
discussions continued for
some time.
Sunday
Sunday morning at 9:00 the
committee on trustees (a selection committee) and the ins
resident committee met in
closed session. Trustees not
on those committees met with
the executive cabinet of SGA
and means combo, MacDOV‘k
all, and Wall to discuss the
revised judicial council proposal which will go to student
references shortly.
Greg Vranicar outlined the
proposal, saying that it “tries
to give the judicial councils

of the students." He potential

truStees asked about the small
number of cases heard, espn

nation of student feeling: "If
you take someone to the judicial council, you’re a find!"
Discussion then turned to three areas outside the judicial
council’s jurisdiction: acadee
mic dishonesty, drug cases,
and the “discussion clause"
recently incorporated into the
trustees' by-laws.
After Wall described price*
rules for cases of academic
creating and combo discussed
organization and progress of
the recentlykestablished drug
hearing board, the group ex—
joined the new discussion C1,
suse. Under the clause, the
president may take emergency action which is later
subject to review by a board
composed of three faculty
members appointed by the chairman of the faculty.
Loewi and Vranicar questioned the “value” definitions
of emergency and the wisdom
of having only faculty maybe

sent might take under such
conditions.
Loewi suggested including
students on the review board,
saying, "In an emergencysituation, I could hardly expect

The Board metprivately with

"I think that we've witnesses on this campus, and nationally,

turning toward. Few students participate inspections or campus
activities and fewer are getting intoacademics."Sosaid Chan?
seller Loewi to the trustees, echoinga statement that has been
expressed time and again across the Grinnell campus.
Some have compared the atmosphere on campus to the fifteen
(you'll be happy to know thats universities Hartford couple set
a record for the longest kiss, andy Minnesota fraternity set a
distance record for beer key rolling), and another student said
that the campus demands him of an vintage hOl'HE"af[6r an
active life of protest and involvement, we're sitting back be
cause we‘ve demonstrated that our effort is future,
The list of what students area't doing this semester is end
least-they're not campaigning, demonstration, protecting, occurring buildings, presenting demands in short, nothing political. This year's social atmosphere also seems much worse
than last year‘s; people seem more withdrawn, less friendly,
less active, less happy. The obvious answer to all this lack of
activity is that students have reported to their books as good
students should, but there are few who seriously content that
such is the case here.
Many national compensation say that Nixonhas presented the
war as an issue, causingthe drop‘offinstudent political action.
Even if one accepts thatexcuse,why the complete lack of inter
est in local campus issues? There nasa brief flurry of protest
over grades, but that quickly died out; proposals for course
evaluation have main idle; proposals for group independence
have not gained really vocal support. The faculty has not set
the best example of excitement in dealingwithacademic reform;
the eleven weeks of debate on the requirements issue may have
effectively presented discussion of other academic issues.
Many have other reasons for playing the faculty for the
campusrwide apache. Loewi told the trusteeSthathe feels many
students are turned off by their classes because they do not
appeal to student interests. He and many others are encourage
ing a regarding of the curriculum to raise student interest and
involvement in their courses--group independence, students
initiated courses might be some of the routes to those goals.
Robert F. Voertman, professor in economics, is interested in
adaptive pedagogy to take better advantage of students interests and class sizes. I hope there will be more discussion of
these issues, both on campus and in the ShE.
The problems with campus social life appear to be very real,
and I’m told that many freshmen have been particularly reset
with problems in this area. Probably one of the major causes
of this problem is shareware inn practitioners period in social
moves. Many guys appear to be afraid to ask girls out for fear
of being considered male chauvinists, but no alternative dating
style has been worked out. Consequently, many students are
sitting home weekends, since they don't seem to have overcome
the entertainment of being wireless on a Saturday night.
Answers to this problem are also unlimited' -especially' from a
few of the Womens Lib people on campus.
Others would place the blame for the receiving social life on
the social Coordinator's office, drugs and the drug culture. or
the hall system. I’d like to agenda few sentences on that last
subject. It seems fairly obvious that the new hall system has
many serious defects. calls used to be the center of campus
lifewespecially the social life. Now the calls->1 believe Loose
is currently the only exception--are considered primarily
places to sleep and take showers. A first approach might be to
increase the number of cold calls-blast year's room draw
proved fairly conclusively that there is a tremendous demand
for the cold calls. ijortunities should be created for group
room draws and project floors. More emphasis should be
placed on form activities-discussion groups, informal meetings with press, parties, informal activities.
Q16 last paragraph—please bear with me. It continues to
image me that there is such a lack of informal intellectual
activity on campusﬁthe good ol' bull session. Also the failure
of Free University to attract more interest surprised me. It
seems like the younger should be used for some semirplanned,
informal discussion groups almost every evening of the week.
I understand that SGA has sponsored some informal winners
in an effort to spare some movement to overcome the apache;
and pic MacDowell appears to be interested in the problem as
well. The Grinnell Experience you save may be your own.

Three Works
The Grinnell College Orth

second concert at 8p.m. Wednesday in Roberts Theater.
David Wooldridge will conduct
the following three works: Ow
future to a Roman Carnival
by version, Mozart's Piano
concerts in Bb K 595 (Rich
and Howe, tourist), and Tchaikowsky‘s Symphony #5 in
E minor.
He chose the music largely
to give the orchestra an opportunity to perfect various
areas of their technique: the
version for tone quality in the
first part and compliance in the
second; the Mozart to develop
subtlety and retirement ofdetail (he made it clear that
"although Mozart has a reputation of being easy, he is not.
I want the orchestra to see
that his music is worth doing
well"); and the Tchaikowsky
as a change, and “to test the
orchestra's staying."
Academic Counseling Studied
by Marilyn antenna
(second in a series concerning developments in various
areas of counseling at Grinnell)
What one word character?
yes the academic advisory
system at Grinnell directed
by Mr. Raymond Obermiller
and Mr. Charles Sellers? Flexibility. The two men work
together and with all the other
counseling resources to shape
a ﬂenable program capable of
meeting the varied needs of
Grinnell students as individuals. receiving that academic
problems are often just symptoms of more complex difficulties, the academic advisors do not attempt to narrowly define their concern toacademic problems alone, but
with a student’s total experience at Grinnell. Because the
necessity is seen for continue
ing evaluation and improvement of the program, especially with the decrease or
complete evolution of academic requirements, proposals
are now under consideration
which may significantly affect
the quality of academicadvising in the future.

his fifth year at Grinnell as

Greg further, the Perry
White of Grinnell journalism,
called me in this week to discuss my contribution to this
issue of the Oldest College
Newspaper West of the Misissippi River, that is to say,
the charles and Black. He
asked me to write a penetrar
king analysis of the social site
nation (if any) at Grinnell,and
of the contribution (if any) of
the Social Coordinator to such
a situation.
I toilet long and seriously,
and even attempted to dosage

I found that there is l) a sort

such a massive amount of
sound equipment?) and 4) it
is pretty difficult to write a
straight column without misrepresenting something or
someone. I do have a models
example here, both of serious
labor and probably messenger
selection.
The performance of knock
smoke here Saturday night
came as something off surprise to a number of Grinnell
College students since they
were under the impression
that the social activities pro—

of football games, Florence

and faculty and Student Sen-
ate meetings. ’l‘has evidence
that some of the $47 each one
of us contributed to the social

we have enjoyed in the past.

involved in the effort to im,
prove the faculty-advisory
system, which he considers
central to academic advisory
as a whole. He feels that the
first weeks of the freshmen
year are crucial in theadjustrnent of the student and that
the faculty advisor shoulder
an initial source of reforms»
tion during that period. However, he encourages to seek
out help from other resources available such as press
errors, Other counseling,etc.
in order to get many opinions
to consider when making a
decision.
CHARLES SE LLE RS
A change took place in the
facultyradvising system this
year as new faculty were realized as faculty advisors for
the first time, reducing the
advised load for all advisors
from 10-15 each to 678 each.
Hopefully, this will facilitate
a greater amount of help on
an individual basis.
There are severalideas currently under consideration to
change the faculty~advisory
system in the future, but all
since on the action taken concerning the Freshmen Tutorial program. Under the Tutr
trial program, the advisor
would not be in the field of
interest indicatedby freshmen
on the pre-registration form
filled out in the summer as
is the case now. Instead, the
advisor would be the instructor of the required Tutorial
group which would be made up
of 10712 freshmen students.
This would possibly help the
advisor maintains closercontact with the student than un*
der the current system where
an advisor often does not have
the student for class.
It has been proposed that the
faculty advisor be assisted by
an upperclass studentwho won
old also be responsible for
adding the freshmen advisors
who were assignedtothatpalr’
similar advisor. This would
provide a more specific form
of help in academicareas than
is currently provided by the
SA. program.
Mr. partner has proposals
program in which a student
could meet together with his
processors, advisor, and possibly the Committee on sci'
comic landing to discuss problems or plans for the future.
This type of meeting could be
held by request of the stud»
ent, a professor, or the faculty advisor. This had been
done in isolated insmnces already but could be useful on a
much wider scale in assistant
a student in evaluatinghisacademic program as a whole.
Academic advisory is certainly not combined to freshman
year, but is a continuing program. Efforts are now being
made to provide students with
a wider variety ofinformation
concerning graduate schools
and job opportunities. At re
quest, Mr. Obermiller distributed strong interest tests to
students and compromise many
other forms of career guidance as well.
Mr. Sellers, at Grinnell
since 1966 and Registrar since
the summer of 1970, specifically handles questions con?
warning leaves of absence,
shopping courses, and related
questions as well as general
academic advisory while also

For-ranging Discussions clark Wl Conference
simon: US Women’s Lib Scared
MILITANT Women's LiberationiSt airline simon, on
campus last weekend for the WL Conference, spoke
about the WL movement and the Quebec separation
movement. (Photo by party facts)
administrative Their Position
Saturday the WL Conference
continued with the workshops
listed in last week‘s 5&8. Approximately half the huge
workshop attendance was from
Grinnell. Outside participants
included a surprising number
of married adult women inspection to the expected college
students. While some workshops admitted men, most did
not in order to encourage free
exchange. Women were able
to ask questions and exchange
opinions about such subjects
as day (are centers, lesbian»
ibm, and comments living.
Discussions were led by sociologist Barbara thesis,
Shannon, the Iowa City WLF,
and the activists.
lodging from participant response, the workshop ”Mari
ridge and Sexual Intercourse," led by the New York
based activists, was proc
able the most interesting and
controversial. It exposed a
split between old style liberal
and radical WL groups on the
subject of whether or howto
men should relate to men. The
activists began by stating
their position as the first are
cup in the country to demand
the evolution of marriage.
They saw it as an institution
which benefits men entirely
at Women's expense. While the
activists did not rule out
forever all malerfemale rec
lationships, they declared:
"For right now we're more
interested in women relating
to women. For the present,
relationships with men can be
very destruction. They take up
a lot of time and energy, if
nothing else." The Feminist
aim is not "telling women
how to achieve a happy life,
but telling them to struggle
to achieve freedom.”
The activists raised themteresting question: ”Why sh—
ould it ever be a good thing to
have a relationship between
two people (marriage) that
cannon be broken except by
permission of the state?"
They also detailed that men
and women share equally in
the job of reading children.
In the second half of the workshop, participants fired their
questions and approval or (1115’
agreement at the activists.
A bigger dinner of step and
bread in partner Lounge and
informal discussions filled
Saturday evening.
Sunday morning a large grr
our considered ”WL: A Basis
for Radical Social Change."
A representative from Gle
men explained What she believed wives and daughters of
military men could do to improve living conditions for entitled men and their families.
She said: 'close people area‘t
afraid to fight if there‘s a
chance of winning. And if you
know how to organize against
the army, you can win in sig
nificant areas. Like officers
can be courtrmarshalled for
interesting men, so somebody should see thatthisis done.
Struggles that WL leads are
not just for women but can
benefit all people. A struggle
against the army is a perfect
illustration of this."
NeXt Bonnie winter, an American student familiar with
the Mexican student movement, discussed Latin american attitudes towardWL. Ti ,
her said that Latin women dis-.
trust WL because they see it
as ”a frivolous something for
the healthy American guinea.
They don't see how it relates
to their strengths for landing
food. WL has to find a way to
turn on to the very registrar—
gle in which these people are
engaged." A participant expressed concern that taking

session by explaining how that
community tries to overcome

airline simon presented her
prospective views, which set
the tone for the rest of the
evening.
simon, a sociologist now at
McGlll University in Monte
real, expressed serious dissatisfaction with WL in this
country. She said: "I don’t
think the movement's about
generation . . . [used to think
the female capacity for eur
paths was so great that it we
walked to women about their
own expression, they would . . .
reach across class and race
lines to work for generation of

WL ismade up ofmiddlevclass
women, it has too much at
stake in the seems que toward

college women in the audience,
simon charged, "You don't
WL to Latin America was a
form of “cultural imperialism." winter agreed mat cultural differences and North
American afﬂhence make the
situation sensitive: “it's very
hard for a North American to
go to Latin America and not
be an explained."
Before breaking into smaller
units for more specific cons
variation, opinions were exchanges about the general success of the Conference. Most
women agreed that it gave
them “an overwhelming feeling of sisterhood." suffered—
yes in philosophy and tactics
were apparent, and no absolute answers were found. Still,
it was encouraging to note the
large number of recommended
women who came to the Conference to listen and learn.
At least the Conference suspended in providing thought on
several important questions
that WL faces.
simon Claims
While attending the WL C0“,
defence, airline simon also
addressed the general college
community about the situation
in Quebec. At a Sunday after
noon gathering in counter Lounge, she presented the background for recent terrorist
and separation activities. Di»
non arrested the importance
of viewing Quebec as a colony
explained by both Anglor Canadian and American investors.
”There is," she said, ”A kind
of racing in Canada that Americans are not accustomed
to » the cultural racing periodically practices by the An
glow vacations against the
French vacations."
For many years the Catholic
Church was used to control
the people of Quebec. This

eyes to translate academic
thoughts into useful actions

of abortion laws, for birth control, etc., is not to serve the
poor and the black. They need
more ~ like nationalizedmedicine or the end of the AMA.”
The panel opened for questions, directedchieflyat simon.
She was asked to clarity her
statement that exploitation of
women was interest to capitalism. Greatly continued, her
reply is that when batteries
took away women’s economic
importance in suchhome tasks
as leaving or running food,
capitalism made middle- class
women into mere arguments.
Meanwhile, poor women were
periodically explained either
as factory workers or as
housewives in city sluts. Di—
non argued that such expression is as much part of capitalism as, for example, the
permanent choice between in~
station andunemployment. lie»
during to tag scapegoats, she
said, ”The white male supremists in Washington are im—
pulled by the humanity of the
system. There’s nothing they
can do within it. But is there
anything that says you have to
have capitalism , anything
written on a stone by the hand
of God?”
Asked to name remedies for
what she called “the inhumanr
its of the U.S. industrial cesspool,” simon suggested, “You
have to deal with specific issues in the community. Der

A dynamic speaker, simon's

theme of the conference WL's responsibility associate
and exactly what forms that
responsibility should take.
Men’s lib defects Stereotypes
by Bill Knecht
"Men are leading only half
a life," was the tone of last
Saturday’s Men‘s Lib meeting
at 1:00 in Gannaway House.
“Men have the capacity to
act in passive and intimate
ways," went the general adventure of thought, "although
they are generally taught by
our society to adopt aggressive and egocentric modes of
behavior."
Saturday’s discussion centered on the different roles of
men and women in the White
angle-canon society. It was
generally agreed that both
sites had facilities for a
broad spectrum of behaviour
and emotions, although our
society tender to push males
to one side and females to
the other.
Males were Viewed as being
caught to assume aggressive,
dominant, egocentric, indexed
event roles, and to view the
World as a battleground with
pierce competition for the best
jobs, the most power, and the
best women. At the other extreme, women were viewedas
being proselytized to be sub
massive, understanding, emotional, and selective ~ to
strike to become ripe fruits
waiting to be picked by hand
some princess.
Neither the "ripefruit" code
cent nor the “hardcore prince" theory seemed acceptable to the Men’s Lib'era.
They thought it time to disney
these nations and to begin
viewing both sites as 'equal
members of the human race.
Although they lines that men
would have to relinquish their
motorola on power to effect
sexual equality, most of those
present agreed that this nasa
reasonable price to pay for
each sex’s development of the
”other half" of its human potential.
Men's Lib is not a new phenomenon at Grinnell. Two
other attempts have been made
in recent years to found similar organizations. Bothfailed
due to lack ofinterestand fail‘
are of heads to "come tower
they", due to different political objectives.
As it stands today, Men's
Lib has the potential to be a
going concern. Its members
include some of the mostprominent people on campus.
They do not present, however,
to push for campusrwide pure
limits ornotoriety. Characteristicaliy, meeting times are
spread by word of mouth, potential members being invited
to sit in on a rap session and
relate their personal experiences to the others.
Men’s Lib is neither factors
ical nor political. It is personal. lt presents no goals
other than those of the selffulfillment of individual dis
session and entertainment. As
such, it will never beat massparticipation endeavor, but it
will be a going concern.
Cultural Racism Exists In Canada
control took the form of church schools. Eventually better enjoyed government schools in the rest of Canada left
French students behind in the
competition for higher education and technical jobs. In re
cent years, complaints from
the people caused the Quebec
province government to open
technical schools and make
colleges more accessible to
the French. According to six»
on, this liberal notification
proved to be a "dragon."
Students were prepared for
professional openings that did
n0t exist in Quebec, and their
education helped them under"
stand the causes for the proVince’s economic problems.
A student movement develops

ployment, inﬂunion, underlying welfare rolls drove labor
to military strikes. Because
the frustrated students were
the children of striking WOI‘k’
era, the two movements unit
ted as student- labor movements rarely do.
Emphasizing the importance
of American investment in
Quebec, simon noted that five
years ago a U.S. Department
of Defense study found Quee
dec to be one of severalareas
in the world where U.S. count
her-los urgency tactics were
needed. Thus, simon argued
that U.S. interests saw theme

the actual separation movement started.

Following three standings
room-only performances in

production of "Snow White"
took to the road for eight
additional performances in
the Grinnelerewburg ever
century schools. The cast
received a warm welcome from the students.
The young addresses article

in prison or by individually
sharing their comments. Such
an instance occurred when the
wicked witch, portraits by
jackie Lofquist, said, “Snow

What shall I do?" The imme

"Commit suicide."
Other children had choice
pieces of advice to give the
cast. A certain boy tried to
continue Snow White (Jamie

his better judgment,SnowWhite bit into the apple and died.
When Doc, a award played by
Karen outreach, announced
the death of Snow White, the
boy said, "I told you so."
The high level of enthusiasm
processed by the cast helped
bring the imaginary setting to
life, and create an active atmosphere between the cast
and audience. The wicked q“,

that one child tried to annie
relate her during access by
throwing a rock at her. Nor
did anyone want to play with
the wicked queen’s mirror,
Deborah garden. who was left
to play all alone on the sw;
inns.
The mood of the play, however, was not only created by
the characters. The banners,
Elizabeth homeland, Marilyn
sussex and Maria toronto,
interface within the action to
tie the plot together. The due
siemens, Jim Spell and Greg
barnes, with their original
score, guitar, and electric
organ also added to the spirit
of the play. Jim Spell’s intro—
factory songs, die theme song,
and tunes relating individual
characters excited the young
audience.
The children’s emotionalrer
spouse to the play could be
seen after each performance
as they pushed to dance with
the hardcore prince, charlie
derived by Richard Smith: the
King, played by Ronald Ai; or

showed their enthusiasm by
running for details and para

other members of the cast.
Other reactions to the play
were reﬂenter in drawings by
the children. Such works of
art included Snow White, the
syndrome Prince and his
sword, the wicked Queen and
her mirror, the seven awards,
and Jim Spell's guitar. In
short, the response was very
enthusiastic.

Amerlmn and angle-vacations will be driven out. Even
if Quebec dress't nationalize,
it will certainly vote in social
democracy. The increasedtaxes to pay forpublicmedicine,

provinces in the federation.
Returning to the American

Tie Closes Soccer Season
The soccer types completed
their first season under Coach
Keith Fisher and undernewlyr
established variety status by
thing brake University at l- l.
The final game of the 1970
campaign featured many often
aspects that made this a frus'
trading season for Keith and
the team‘rfailure to capitalize on breaks and an liability
to score while generally controlling midfield and playing
aggressive defense. This last
game was removable however,
as the team played well des—
site blowing snow and (BU-def
free temperatures and a poor
set of directions which got
most of the team to the game
45 minutes late.
The game was barely a minute old when a brake attacked
«(in a gold stopping mp) broke
through the asset—unorganized Grinnell defense to put
one in. it looked like another
long afternoon for the charles
and Black, but Dave aaron
scored the first goal of his
Grinnell career within a your
pie of minutes of brake’s,
thing the score for the rest of
the afternoon as it turned out.
The Grinnell defense quickly
got it together and shut out the
brake attack effectively.

Grinnell showing in this yme,
as he made many fine saves
against experienced brake
attorneys.
The soccer team closed at
37472, which was not as good
a showing as was hoped for
when the team assembled in
September. The loss of Steve
Hirshorn hurt, as did a general letdown which appeared
midway through the season.
In any case, the team lost or
tied its last five games after
a fast start. Keith can look
forward to next season and
the return of his scoringstars
Tom Lincoln and Steve more

of Hirshorn. Saturday's game

Knox shares Grinnell
Grinneil’s Pioneers continued their losing spain at Knox
in the final game of the season. Both teams,going into the
game, had identical league
records of 4-3 and were tied
for fourth place, but Knox
walked away the better, 28’25.
Grinnell drew firstblood one
19 yard field goal by Twinkle
does Roy Lewis, but from then
on, the game was nominated
by Knox, as they struck for
TDs in each of the four start
term. Mike Eslick broke for
77 yards and a touchdown in
the first quarter, and Kelly
Cahoon scored from 13 yards
out in the second quarter to
leave Knox on top 14—3 at the
half.
in the third quarter, Bob
toilet scored on a one yard
drive, and early in the final
frame, John rubber planned
over, also from the one. Thus
Knox led 28-3 in the fourth
quarter before Grinnell could
get started.
The Pioneers never fully
ave up, however, despite the
met that theballgame hadbeen
rendered meaningless by their
previous two losses. Grinnell
finally got an offense going
following rubber’s score, as
they drove 56 yards with Wa-

Re: Article by the C. Kid
First let me say this is not
the article that I had written
after reading the article on
lM’s. My initial impression
was that of fire write, but
that has since been displayed
through conversation with the
anonymous writer. [had read
the article gettingthe impression that it was a personalattack upon the directors of the
[M program, as I think others
also assumed.
But upon the conversation of
tonight I realized that thearticle was not intended to be so,
but was rather intended to help
us and to get other Students to
help us in the restructuring
program of lM’s, a task which has met much difficulty
and won’t get off the ground
unless the students homeland
it. The 1M program this year
has been far from satisfac—
tony, in fact it has been one
of the greatest on record,
save for some Sterling per‘
companies in the past couple
of years. This has been the
result of the restructuring of
the old hall system, and the
shift in interests of the student body from the archive
"win for the old hall” spirit.
I’m not saying this inn’t good,
but too many people feel they
must win no matter how they
do it, and this detracts from
the equipment that should be
derived. it has also led to
many people not wanting to
participate, as they have no
desire to be stopped on by
Jollie Rollie and the rest of
the gang of Clark, but would
rather go out and have fun
and enjoy themselves. buttons
again is not the basis of the
problem contracting IM’s.
The crisis can be solved by
adequate and upset-date year
worship. Craig and myself
seem to be willing to give it,
but the powers that be back
from the shore. It is no sets
get that the system needs overhauling. We need a system
base on interest groups as
was suggested in the article,
not one based on the hall sys*
tel. There is not enough ins
forest within most calls to
conduct a worthwhile 1M pro
gray:
'this idea is not new. Idiscussed it this summer with
the powers, but the idea was
cast aside. Perhaps this was
my fault for not emphasizing
its emphasis, perhaps the blame should lie with thepowers
for wanting to stick with a
promoting empire. That matters not. What matters is that
something needs to get done.
it needs to be done rather
soon before the program disc
appears entirely. Our hands
are tied. We must deal with
our suppliers, and transfers
to be out of date.

I'm not saying it reserves a
major; i do think it involves
enough for a minor, but they
will only give, and this has
not been approved, one team
sport towards the team sport
requirement. This was not
enough incentive for anyone
to volunteer.
If you have a complaint or
suggestion, come to Craig or
myself with it. We know what
is happening with theprogram
and can accommodate the suggestion. Otherwise your suggestion or complaint becomes
part of a verbal attack upon
us as to why we're not doing
our job. They area’t processed to assess the value of
them. They are used as weapons. Come to us. We can
help and are willing to. We

We want to change it so itwiil
work. But with our hands tied,
we become part of the upper
echelon who defects and
dress't listen. Think about the
program, not about who is
writing this and why he might
seem better.
Perhaps the C. Kid is right.
By remaining anonymouspeople will think about what he
says, and won't try to rationalize it by looking who wrote
it. The program is for the
students, and it needs help. it
is up to the students to save it.

, going over from the two. The
pass for the two point center—
sign failed. Followinga fumr
bee recovery, the Baby Bull
scored from Knox’s 16, then
ran for two points. A poor
hunt set up Grinnell’s final
score as the Pioneers took
over on Knox’s 44. Gorgeous
Gary Johnson hit Henry ”the
Flash” Corona with a 16 yard
scoring Strike, and " act"
Robinson ran for the twopoint
conversion to run the count
to 28—25, Knox. However, there were just 16 seconds left
in the game, and Knox killed
the clock.
The game was, thus, a case
of too little, too late. Grinnell
proved in the fourth quarter
they could score, yet they did
so too late to mean anything.
The Pioneers just didn't get
accused over this meaningless
game until the fourth quarter.
An important factor is that
Grinnell had to play without
two quarters, Jim Pirolli and
Randy server. Both suffered
angle injuries againstSt. Olaf.
All in all, however, the season
wash't a total loss, as the
team stayed at .500 and per
formed as the experts predict
ted they would.
