ADDRESS HERII

Campus incest
At the 48th annual meeting oi the American:
Council on Education last week in Washington, DC,
the main topic of concern was the proper role of std-i
cents in the formation of university policy.
Two years ago on the Grinnell campus the main
topic of concern was the proper role of students in the
formation of college policy.
College administrators at the ACE meeting were
divided as to how much say the students ought to have.
One college president, for example, felt that students
ought to have a direct role in the selection of current‘
cum, while the dean of another school thought that students had enough control of their curriculum just by
what they discussed in class.
The discussion at the ACE gathering spring from
concern over student results at Berkeley and other uni—
varieties during the last year.
alternatively, the error over rule changes subsided
at Grinnell about the time the Berkeley upheaval began. Nor has there been an upsurge in concern at
Grinnell recently.
‘ Perhaps the college worked out its turmoils satisfactorily during its apparently procedure display of
student unless, Perhaps problems such as the possible
change in the residence hall system can now be con—
ordered with mutual respect for the opinions of all segments of the campus.
At any rate, President Glenn suggest and Dean
James Stauss, who attended the ACE meeting from
Grinnell, must have found the discussion of student report in unusual contrast to the situation at their school.
Forum Windows
College administrators sometimes ask, in all sin-y
verify, why it is that students are always typical about
administration actions
Perhaps it is for little reasons, like not having the
windows of the Forum washer until a few days before
Homecoming and Parents’ Weekend despite the fact
they needed cleaning since the beginning of the school
year.

To the Editor:
Note: Barry Ancona, prev‘ out
of the Grinnell Religious Lil: ills,
was quoted last week as saying
at their meeting, “This is u liberal
campus only six days a week."
Dear Bari-y,
What precisely is illiberlll
about the seventh day around
here? I don't want to engage in
an “I‘m more liberal than you"
contest, but I do know as well as
you what liberalism ill religion
amounts to, and l can only regard
the statement attributes to you as
out of touch or reckless or both.
calling such B remark as a stimulus {or thought and discussion has
its appeal, but its inaccuracy makes
it self~depending even as a stimulus. The cause of liberalism in
religion is not advanced when the
apostles of liberalism make english statements, even if those state-
~{events sound liberal Ind iconoclaslc.

Have you taken time to study the
format of the service, which has
been rather distinguished “specialized’” It may not all be as
liberal as you personally would
like ii, but i great number of other‘ people attending don't want it
as liberal as you do, and l have
believed that one of he bookmarks

Report Describes Des points project
Ed. note: The following is a
description of the “Des ltloines
Project," which will be supported by several iowa colleges,
including Grinnell. Fifteen Grinncll students have been in Des
ltloines to help on the project at
various times since September.
The traditional approach to the
problems of an periodically (let
prince area,ignored the basic right
of people to have a voice in the
decisions which affect them.
First, the approach often fails to
ascertain either the needs of the
people or the type of program
which will work most effectively in
the area.
recently, because the community
has not bccn given a part in the
original formation of the program.
it results or districts the purposes
of those who are trying to start the
program. .
Finally, this approach may attack
results rather than causes, or one
aspect rather than the whole basis
of that which causes a slim.
Another approach, started in the
last tcp years by a series of did
: feront groups ranging from Stun
E cents for a Democratic Society to
the inner-city church groups is
"cammuniLyrselfsurganization.” In
this approach fullrtime organizing
living in the area work to draw
people together into a community
group. Their ultimate objective is
to start a working group which will
provide continuing leadership for
the area by the community people
themselves.
The difference between the community-seeﬂorganization and the
traditional approach is that the
former brings about a basic change
in the periodically received area
both politicians and psychologically.
Tile slim usually has very few
ways open to it for helping itself
due to the lack of political paper»
hence and influence found there.
 
The community organization, by
establishing the machinery and
knowledge for problemsolving by
the people themselves. modified
their dependence on outside agencies.
The community organization provides the means of self help and
communication with other conimunitics and groups which is so
respiratory needed in these areas.
The communitysorganizing approach is the one which the Des
points Study Group hopes will be
put into eitcct in the Walnut Hill
area of Des illoinos. The program
will combine three working groups.
The first will be a full time or.
manager potentially supported by
eastern and central iowa colleges.
The person who is now working in
this capacity is Billy King. who has
been living in the Walnut Hill are-a
and doing research on the proc»
less, oi community organizing
there for one month.
recently, King will corporate
with Youth for Freedom, a com.
winning organization in the area.
shortly, campus groups will take
part in the project when they are
asked to do so by the community
group. Youth for Freedom, or
King. Their participation may involve research. work camps or our
or activity that the community
groups deep necessary.
The project has both academic
and cultural implications for college students, receiving and, at
times, participating in the problemssolving processes of the walnut Hill area can be extremely
valuable, They can gain both
practical political and sociological
experience. Furthermore. Contact
with a different cultural and icon
omic group can he personally. as
well as intellectually. beneficial.
However, student participation in
the project will occur only for the
benefit and at the request of those
in the area.

committee this year would not
handle such matters as whether
women students should be allowed

considers a technical detail.
“On the other hand, we would
be concerned with a possible
change in the hall system pop.
ice." karma said.
karma noted that the FCSA
has met only two times so far
this year and that no cases oi
student misconduct have been considered as yet.
The committee this year coniprises eight voting members, They
are karma, penis de Coteau

cum (dean of women). S. Eugene
Thompson (clean at man). and
Richard centers (associate dean).
in addition to the eight voting
members, President Glenn Leggctt and Dean James Stauss are
ex ontario members of the com—
little.
The FCSA drew attention to its
salt last school year during a
jurisdictional feed involving the
student courts and the college administration.
The committee, which was es
published last year by acting
President James Stauss, advised
the president on policies in the
area of student conduct, particle
pages in the process of changing
the basic rules and penalties. and
considers certain cases or student
misconduct.

All of it." “porn, you really must

we’re formatting the laundry and
I’m down to my last pair of

boys really had it hard, and many
letters home may have contained
express like these.
What was the problem? Well,
rehabilitation — that omnipresent
phenomenon—was modelling up the
works again. Somebody had der
cited that it would be convenient
to have the laundry, cleaning, and
parcel post agencies located in one
building—the heating plant. Many
others decided that it worlds't be
convenient at all. Thus. the Iuss.
On October 3, 1952, the 5&3
wrote that “the Grlhnell Student
Council unanimously approved a
resolution for a collectible boys
cool of the college laundry and
dry-cleaning agency. . . .Reasoiis
ordered by council members Im‘
the unprecedented boycott are that
the present location or the cleaning, laundry, and parcel post ages.
lies is inconvenient and relatively
inaccessible during the buddy
months; that the new rehabilitation or these serVices is receiving
students or Jobs; that the lack oi
adequate space and facilities in
the heating plant creates a battlefield during the lunch hours;
and that heat of the building has
led to the spoilage oi good pan
Eels." One can Imagine hundreds
or students struggling through rain
and Wind and sheet and hall to
retrieve packages lmm home and
laundry and candles oi dry»cleaning—only to drop every bit of it
 
in the mud. They did have a real
complaint. one must admit.
Tile editorial staff of the 5&3
determined to present both sides
of the issue. however, They wrote,
“When the decision- was made to
combine. services at the heating
plant, there seemed to be advantages for both the students and the
housekeeping department. For the
students, it would mean a chance
to pick up packages any time during the working day. At the same
time, it would eliminate unnecessary handling, meeting trained
laundry personnel from timecorisuming tasks.” On the other hand,
“it is a fact, too, that the heat of
the laundry plant has tested candy mailed to students." Clearly,
this was a hot issue.
However, two weeks passed and
the boycott (which, the editorials, “has nothing to do with boys
or lots although the confusion is
quote understandable at this time
or the year") wash’t put into ei—
Iect. The 5&3 queries, "Since the
Council vote was anonymous, it
appears that representative student opinion is likewise anonymous. Why, then, are students
still introducing the college agencies which they have just registered against?" Maybe that agreement high file oi shirts was just
too much to tight.
