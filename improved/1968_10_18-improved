Social Studies Grade Called
“Experiment on Experiment”
By BENSON SMITH
An appeal to the faculty at
large to use credit-fail trading
for Social Studies was passed
by a narrow margin. The decision applies only to the first
semester and only to this year.
According to Bernard merger,
Social Studies Department
Chairman, the
impacts for
the proposal
came 1 r D m
the staff. Only
eight of the 13 staff members,
however, were originally in favor of the suggestion. The proposal was written up by Robert
Voertman (Social Studies Division Chairman), Gary magic
(Philosophy). and Gregory
Guroii (History).
The resolution refers to the
course as experimental. Guroff
said “the objectives of the
course are not quite clear,"
and “there was a general spelling that hints that what they
were trying to do was happened by grades." Tile resolution states that “standards {or
evaluation or performance is an
unavailable constraint on instrumentation" and that “setting standards should be treated
as a sexual to more basic aspects of the instrumentation."
What we are trying to do,
said Guroii, is to get students
News
Analysis
to investigate areas on their
own and to bring up relevant
questions. With a trading system. he Continued, “students
typically try to come in and
figure out where a proc stands.
and then to follow that rather.
than find out where he (the
student) stands." According to
the resolution, “We can learn
more about what students may
learn from these materials if
we reduce their concern to
have us (the faculty) specify
what they should be learning in
order to score"
The fact that the request to
change to credit-fail came after
the semester was underway is
explained by the fact that
“eight of the thirteen members
of the staff were not involved
in planning or discussing the
course prior to the start ot the
Semester." Gurnff added that
many members or the state
were not quite sure how to
handle the material. This is nut:
surprising considering that over
half of the staff did not participate in planning the Course.
This is perhaps accidentally
beneficial. Because the staff is
uniamilial’ with the material,
the opportunity for initiative on
the part of the students is
greater. when the instructors

Travel Industry Provides Varied
. l Services & Prices for Students
By JOHN GARDNER
Student off-campus travel varies from a mid-semester trip to
chicago to a year spent abroad. This travel, in all its forms, has
even rise to charitable industries which water to student travelers.
, hey provide published rates and programs for a variety of trips.
They give information to students as to how to save money
and how to visit parts of countries not usually looked for by
consists. Thus the services of this type oi: travel agency may
range from a carefully organized Mediterranmn Cruise to a prozac for part-time work and part-time study in Madrid. Students
affected represent 3% of the student population, in contrast with
the 3% of the adult population which travels to Europe yearly.
U.S. Travel
The airline domestic fares in the United States generally include the stanley youth take for those in the 12 to 22 age bracket.
In this plan, a student pays only half fare for a one-way ticket
for any seat which is unlimited at building time. in view or the
increased numbers of regular travelers, some airlines do not have
stanley rates at certain times of the year, such as Christmas,
when many people travel.
. Braniff, Delta, and Eastern Airlines now have a reserved
utc rare. For‘two-things or the regular price of a seat any person
iso to 22, and those in the military, may reserve a seat. A roundtrip exclusion called the “Discover America” allows travelers to
pay 1/, return fare. The airlines’ youth and "Discover America"
[area do have is few restrictions, such as a time limitation for
return, and they do not include [lights leaving on Friday earnings.

‘ “It's cheap, because there‘s no entry fee to the Luxembourg airport. The food's bad, and the accomodations are house,” says
David Ruhe (’71) about the [light brown New York to Luxembourg
on one of the least expensive transatlantic airlines, Icelandic
'Airlines. The round-trip costs $389 in the summer season and $319
in the winter season.
Bahamas Airways is a new comparison for low rates; NaslaurLuxembourngassau costs was all year long.
There are certain group rates and charter rates on overseas
travel which sometimes are very low for individuals, Often included is a sum oi money inn tour arrangements (such as train
trips into the country, guide expenses). To charter a plane an
organization must have lower than a certain number or members.
For example, the National Student Association, which has hundreds
of thousands of members is exempt, but Grinnell College, with
only two thousand members, would be eligible. A Charter load on a
jet is 150-180 persons, and a group can be [mm 14 persons on.
Ship Travel
Ship travel sends to be more expensive than plane travel. A
typical one way take begins at 5275 on regular passenger lines.
Many people travel by sea because or the greater opportunities
to meet people while traveling. This seems to be a less attractive
selling point to students than to nonrstudenrs, however.
In the subjective, there are usually several low Cost ships
traveling the Atlantic with fares as low 88 $170 to $200 for the
one way journey. Another low cost way to travel by sea is by
rreighter. They take no more than 12 passengers, and space i!
difficult to get, even as much as one year in advance.
programs
A February 1968 list of organizations specializing in student
travel lists 150 entries. Some, such as the American Institute for
Foreign Study, are planned for the whole year and include special
study arrangements, choice or processors and courses, housing,
extra-curriculum amenities, and so on. Others last for the summer
or for a few weeks during the summer. Together with organizations that provide educational and work arrangements, organize«

the meeting was in record with
a student Senate resolution,

the idea of “home rule.”
According to Miss winter,
the Thursday meeting was not:
an attempt to bypass present
discussion going on through
"established channels" or the
student Affairs Committee, but
was intended to encourage independent description of what
attitudes exist in the calls on
the issues of computational use
of hall rooms and the choices
imposed by the principle or selfdetermination.
Thomas J. Thomas, ’70, made
the following comment on Miss
winter's motion: “A lot of it

A consensus of those at the
meeting seemed to indicate that
more people believed in the
possible success of instrumentation in “self-determination"
for calls, and floors, than in
passing a mandatory rule for

Duties of means
Are sustainable
By CONNIE ERICSON
Although the duties of the ltih
sent means and the protest and
dean of the college are clean
enough to the means themselveii
and satisfactorily constitutes
by some at the students. the
actual functions oi the three
are indeflnable—if not inexpllcable—and unfamiliar to most
students.
Dean Alice 0. Low, in charge
of references, and Dean S, Eugene Thompson, ln charge of
uilderclass advisory, function ’
"almost like it central coordla
rating office.” said Dean Low.
Despite the overall of the ace:
comic and social areas of .3,
student's life and the importantly of one to the other, the
student means expensive the
non-academic side of student
life through their counseling and
active participation in student
affairs.
Because Grinnell has the problems of a residential college
and a college in which important policy changes are calculated by arbitration rather than
by administrative authoritarianism, the so-called “power"
of the means is complicated and
the “desirable" functions value.
Their daily agenda is varied and
the pressing issues unpredictable. Problems of directory
living are worked on constantly,
according to Dean Low. as an
a few other issues, but all-came
put issues such as the current
debate on home rule and open
forms change from year to
year. The resolution, however.
of such problems is never complete but “problems are not
discussed or considered unreal
just because they cannon be re<
solved," explained Dean Thompson.
The case for student sense
determination is not only recognized by the upper echelons
of the college but is being
worked toward particularly by
the institution of the resident
advisor system, stated Dean
Low. "We ate trying to find
a better way of establishing
student responsibility so that as
changes are made they are
made with a grassroots kind of
structure."
Student responsibility, student
majority, and student power
are battiecries The real question is who is responsible to
whom, why, and who is powerful to what ends," Deau Thomp.
son said.
The position of the protest and
dean, SCI-Called because Dean
James H. Stausa administers in
financial as well as traditional
academic planning areas, is
varied but easier to define. He
has overall supervision for the
budget for current operations,
academic planning and development, faculty affairs relating
to hiring, and certain offices
and activities, e.g., Library,
Admissions, Registrar, Placement and Student Aid, worcester Services, Service Bureau,
academic advisory, and educae

initiative will be unlimited.
The proposal seems to be
aimed at creating a better atlnnsphere for instrumentation
by reducing the exhibitions std.
cents have concerning class
participation The role of a
trading system as significant
in indicating student participation and discussion is, however, questionable. William Poliak and John cialis both commented that the size o! the
classes (over 25 students per
class) is too large to accommodate discussions easily. This ll

kypcaily small and the material which they cover is more
narrowly defined, In such 6' substances, discussions thrivo
and are geneﬁdial. in large
classes with less defined interest areas and no concrete, substantial objectives, discussion
is understandably less successfill.
in brief, several factors exist
which appear to hammer the
Social Studies experiment. The
size of the classes, the lack of
concrete objectives, and the uncertainty among the staff wondering how the material should
be presented are three problems
which are vital to the experiment. How the credit-fail systems will help in elimination

Set for cycling
cycling 196869, the Giinnell
College textbook, will appear
in May. Only one issue of the
cycling ls being published this
year. Stephanie greater, cycling editor, is confident that
the cycling can be a publication that all the students will
appreciate.
The staff is attempting to
strike some sort of medium between 3 middle - of - the - mad
textbook and a photographic
essay, instead of using a
“theme," the mood of the campus will be portraits by an
essay and candle photographs
of campus life. Although it is
virtually impossible for the cycling tn be completely objective, according to the editor,
the enhanced staff of 28 will afford a greater cross-section of
campus opinion.
This year the Cyclones is operating under a new financial
arrangement with the college.
At this point all funds are
coming from the sale of advertisements and subscriptions. If
not subscriptions at $6.00 each
are not sold, the cycling will
receive funds from SGA. Miss
greater said that she is fairly
certain that the quote will be
reached and passed.
Miss Kxeuger says that the
textbook must serve four functions. A textbook is an artistic
creation which must be journalistically responsible. it must be
a marketable item which an

cycling serves as training for

Editor greater thinks that
there is a defining need for a
textbook. The textbook should
not duplicate the "Sell Grinnell"
approach of the catalogue. In
purchasing the “Grinnell understand,” the cycling given
the students a capture of the
goods and emotions of a par«
similar time in their lives.
The staff, pleased with the
response thus far from the std-
‘cents and administration, hopes
to avoid the mistakes of the
past by remaining potentially

Saturday night at 8:00 in ARH.

when very different ranges of

“a tried and true piece" after
over 100 performances in New

some messages, “Snlo Piece” is
a good introduction to content

composer to composer, and are
constantly added to.
Mr. Zonn comments that computers of innovative music with
new techniques are sending a
considerable amount cl music
to Grinncll “since they know at
it as a center for new music."
This reputation, which has been
built in the last year, was
added to by a Broadcast Music

Two Grinneii Farmers: A Profile
By STEVEN GROW
How much does the Grinnell College student know about the
Midwestern farmer? Last week, the 58d} pulled a missed sample of
students represented the seven major priorities on the campus.
of the groups pulled, only the cross country team was 100% certain
that there are tar-ms within walking distance of this campus, But
what of the farmers themselves? What kind of work does farming
involve? What do local farmers think about Grinneli College? To
ﬁnd out, the Sim interpreted two local farmers.
“Farming is a big business," according to Mr. packard gallery. Mr. battery {arms low acres southeast of Grinnell. He raised
com, soybeans, and dairy cattle. According to Mr. variety. the
typical farmer does most or the work himself. He not only flows
fields, but also purchases supplies, bargains with buyers, and re«
pairs his own equipment. He also has a current knowledge of hybrid seeds, chemicals {or weed control, and fertilizers. Farmers
often know much about veterinary medicine and keep informed
about livestock breeding and market trends. in other words, the
farmer usually aims every part of his business.
Farming is not all riding teachers and sharing coast What
kind of training do farmers have? Both of the men interpreted
have college degrees. Both men are also sons oi farmers. According to Mr. Raymond Harris, who farms 430 acres north of Grinneli,
this is common. The best way to learn the business is to grow up
With it. Another reason is that a large investment is necessary to
start a farm.
A 300 acre farm with equipment, seed, and livestock would
cost at least $130,000, according to figures supplied by Mr. Harris.
For this investment the average manner has a net income of only
about $5,000 a year. "This is an average," said Mr. Harris, “it is
a little higher in iowa.”
i asked Mr. variety why a man with his training is content to
make so little money for his time. He has a degree in mathematics

Lewis Book Helps Find Paradise Lost
By ELEONORE SPIEGEL
Revolution and reception seem
to be the watching‘ds oi the
Western world these days, even
in a part of it so isolated from
“reality" as Grinnell is said to
be. since i wish to encourage
progress, including revolution,
though revolution seems circular rather than progressive,
1 thought I would do my civic
duty — which Mr. Arieti, in his
usual, charitable manner, helped
me see -— and point out that the
greatest rebel in history is japan
and that we might do better if
we followed such an illustrated
model. Milton has given us one
of the best literary treatments
of japan: and there will he several courses next semester
teaching Milton, to help us become ever better levels, no
doubt. but for those people who
are too implement to wait till
next semester or feel the pressing need now to be the best
levels we can, i highly recommend C.S. Lewis' short book A
surface to Paradise lost.
Lewis' chapter on japan begins by demanding us that the
pro-Victorian logistics thought
Milton made him a great and
florists figure. And we must
certainly cancer with their view,
though it seems curious, I know
to say that progress can be
made by returning to precision
ian ideas. but, then, progress
works in mysterious ways —dress't it?
At any rate, Lewis points out
that japan, in the beginning ol
Paradise LNK, really is an im-
pressure figure. He is like “the
Sun new his‘n" (1.594); he stood
“In shape and feature proudly
. like a now'r” (1590-1): and
he was the emperor of “medline
shapes and forms/excellent
human” (1358-9). Besides be
ing florists in his person. japan
is florists in his cause. He has
been treated industry ~ or literally, as we say today — and
so he prefers "to align in Hell,
than serve in Heaven" (1.263).
Though japan prefers Hell to
Heaven, he is not happy there.
He cannon take over Heaven,
he knows; but, like a great rear

Adam and Eve. His light now
inn't quite as florists as his
light for liberty and equality
(v.790-2); but he is still lighting,
and that, surely is What really
counts.
Lewis points out that japan
shows an almost human side or
his character in the Garden or
Eden. spring on Adam and Eve,
he overhead: their tender talk
and sees them kissing; and he
turns aside “with serious beer

him lighting for the cause in
that description, but inn’t it
good to know that such a fine
rebel wash’t without normal
sexual impulses, even though he
was an angel?
Lewis also points out that japan inn't comfortable anywhere.
We have seen him as the emperor of Hall, as the general patient in defeat, and as the busty
spy, but he inn’t happy in any
at those roles. He dress't ever

there are many more—and his

only in academics and not in

Justice Abe portal begins his
final chapter to his Concerning
present and Civil Disobedience
with the following sentence:
The story of man is the history, first, of the acceptance
and opposition of recordings
necessary to permit comments life; and, second, of the
emancipation of the individual within that system of necessary recordings.
it is not an original observe-
tion certainly, but it is an es
sexually important one now,
when the concepts of individual
liberty and comments order are
getting so organized that rational consideration cl different points of view is extraordinarily difficult. Justice Forias
is telling us with a nice matter—
oHaCt precision that the issue
is not personal rights or comments rights but rather per
local rights and comments
rights, not either-or but nothing.
g I wish we could make Justice
portal‘ statement our text. for
the potential debate in our
academic community over who
is violation whose rights, who
is visiting whose powers or
not using them properly, and
who is counting the votes in
whose participation democracy.
it we could use the statement
as a text, we might be able to
recognize that our academic
community is really a pluralism of communities made up
of different kinds of people.
Most of them would like to dis<
charge both their obligations to
themselves and to others previously enough to allow us to
say that we have at Grinnell at
least the spirit of a single community,
Why not? briefly, I suppose,
because all 1400 of us students,
faculty. and staff live so closely together here that at times
we appear to deal with each
other with our nerveendings
rather than our best and most
communication Voices. Speaking for myself, I think my
chief obligation is to preserve
and enhance the reputation of
.the College as an institution
worthy of support and infection,
not only from students and faculty but from alumni and
friends to what goes on on
campus. Students and faculty
have different responses, and
I respect them. asking only
that they respect mine.
At this moment we appear
to have a platform of problems.
Any college does. A college like
Grinnell with a superior student
body and faculty, each operat<
ing on the other's possibilities,
is going to have more than
most. We need to remember
that a revolution in many
things is underway, everywhere, and as Martin Luther
King Jr. suggested here last
year, we area't going to be
able to sleep through it at Grinnell. But I know too that, as a
community of students and faculty, we have the wit and concern to make things work out
Well. Indeed, We can follow the
lead of what a good many students and faculty are already
trying to do: to set up both
formal and informal procedures
for listening and talking, for
objective and resulting, for pro«
posing and studying and decor<
sending. In general, we can
create structures that are both
defining and liable enough to
let us consider proposals for di<
section and change with the
liberal disposition that a college like ours is supposed to
be creating in all of us.
The student-faculty committee on Student affairs is a
structure of such procedures.
50 is the Judicial Council and
the revised Committee on Stu-
sent Publication! and Radio.
So will be the depending reorganlmtioli of several faculty
committees to include student
representation. So too. hopefully, will be the newly institutes student advisory system
and the expanded resident advisor program. Though some
difficult matters Such as the
change in women’s hours and
the residence hall system have
already been institutes, none
at the structures is secure
enough or experienced enough
at this moment to warrant an
easy optimize, and none of
them will make the place as
perfectly reasonable as each
one of us might usually WlSl’l.
But we are at least started.
and the job now is to lesson
the gap between the problems
that keep appearing and our
procedures [or dealing With
them independently.
We will have some angeles
but I think we can do it. We
have to. To peter to Justice
worlds again and to paraphrase
him:
The survival of our society as
a free, open, democratic conimuiiity will be determined by
the procedures — the rules of
conduct, the methods, the
practices a which survive
the configurations. For pro<
secure is the bone structure
oi a democratic society; and.
the quality of procedures
standards which meet general
acceptance a the quality of
what is tolerance and per
possible and acceptable conduct —— determines the disability of the society and the
survival possibilities of free«
dom within the society.
For ourselves here at Grinnell that kind of society is es<
central; and we might remedy
her, as the man says, that
such a good society, like Charity, begins at home.

Campus Events:
Homecoming, Love’s Labor's Losl'
By ALLAN HART
Aside from the usual entertainment of the typical Grinnell weekend, the Homecoming
Weekend that is now upon us atfortls all sorts of new threads. For
example, there will be a conglomeratlon oi parents handling
around the campus, and along
with the clubs, they will go
through the traditional period of
shock at the registration of
Grinnell students. To soundtrack
this moral integration, there
will he concerts and electrical
productions performed by those
students who have not yet fallen
under the influence at the less
tonight students.
Accordingly, the first major
event of Homecoming is the college production of “Love's label's Lost” by William Shakespeare. It is directed by Robert
Ingam, and the leads will he
played by William taylor, trends Thomas, Elizabeth Wichmatiu, and write Schwallor. It
begins at s p.m. on Friday, in
Roberts Theatre. A: the amp
time on Saturday the play will
be given again.
Then at 8:30, both Friday and
Saturday, the Grinnell College
Choir and Chamber Orchestra
will perform in service Chapel.
There will be two movies on
Friday night. The first will be
the regular ARI-l film at 9:30,
which this week will be “Key
cargo." At 10:30 in the Forum
South Lounge, “Days of Dylan
Thomas" and “A Child's Christmas in Wales” will be shown.
On Saturday there will be
many activities to deeper the
business of the previous gem
edition. After a 9:30 a,m. toilet
hour in the residence calls,
there will be an informal symposia with various representatives of the administration and
students, starting at 10:30 in
the forms. Between 11 am. and
12:30 pm. a buffer function
will be served in both
the Quad and in Cowlcs
Hall. Alter the afternoon sport
events, we will be revised dry<
basically by a charcoal speak
dinner in the Quad and in
Cowles. Following this them
will be the alorementioned their
. .i . .
i'ii mu
the and floral performances.
Then the big dance will satellite
our minds and bodies. Featuring
the Pizaht Brothers Orchestra,
the Homewmilig dance will also
bring tears of nostalgia to many
guests. Of course the women will
be bedeckcd with ﬂusers dis<
oriented by entertaining, bush
news-nlillded men for the local
florists.
That finished the activities at ‘
Homecoming, not to mention the
adults' visiting during that time.
On Sunday, things get back to
some old degenerate scene, exemplified by the Open radius;
doubtless students will have sent
their parents home before then.
At 8:00 the Forum movie at Friday night will be respond, and
so will the ARl-l movie (9:30).
The regular Monday night
Bridge lessons will again be
held at 7:30 in the dining area
of the Forum.
Finally on Wednesday a jam
session will he held in the Forum
North Lounge, at 10:30 p.m.
With all these shell things
going on, who will think of falling to the usual deaths of declaration?

It is an easily accepted fact that in the town of Grinnell, and
throughout iowa, there live a number of families of “poor folk."
However, it is not commonly known that families here living below
the poverty level number one in tour, a ratio comparing unfavorably to the national average of one in five. Thus we see that the
pleasant rural community and the college are not, in fact, far
distant from the poverty problem, and from the war on poverty.
0n the state level, the problem is being attached by the office
at Economic Opportunity (CEO). Dr. C. admin Gilmur, instructor
at Political Science at Grinnell, served as the ﬁrss director of the
program beginning in June 1965. Under his year-long administration
each county was organized, and local programs were started. Grinuell is included in a four county program including Poweshiek.
newton, Tama, and iowa counties. The center is at Belle plains.
it is the duty of the Regional organization to identify the problems
of this particular area, to identity resources available to mobility
them, and to establish a system of priorities to determine how
resources shall be used. Programs begun by the regional committee include a year-round Head Start program, a medical services
center, and a regional multipurpose center.
According to Mr. Gilmour, the “gets" of the poverty program
is the Community Action Program (CAP), which is centered in

each community. One important goal of CAP is to turn the programs back to the target group to carry out. efforts are made to
employ the underprivileged, and to help them organize themselves. The feeling expressed by Mr. Gilmour is that programs
administered by distributed people are “demanding and dehumanizing" to the people at whom they are directed.
The 0E0 and CAP programs are both products of the current
“War on Poverty." Being new, they have encountered several
problems in trying to add their efforts to already existing church,
private, and educational efforts. They found the "olrlrlineH agencies
were essential of the new programs. Many feel that the new pro—
grams have failed to do as they promised and that they have not
eliminated the Waste and red tape that were found in the earlier
decentralized system.
Mr. Gilmour expressed discouragement over the present trend
oi the poverty program for several reasons. He feels that the CEO
could be “the most promising new look in this century,” but that
the program is not understood and that in practice it has adopted
many of the characteristics of the old line agencies. Gllmcur allocated organizing the poor people so that they may become their
own representatives, He feels that they may become a powerful
political force, but until they do so, they will continue to be looked
down upon and covered to, and kept in their places as “second
class citizens.”
Other programs are underway to combat poverty in the area.
The four - county region is served by a total of 10 VISTA workers.
one living in the Grinnell community. it is the goal of these workers to live in the area, among the people, and to give them assistance in a personal way.
Miss Rita soldier, the 20~year<0ld Grinnell VISTA volunteer
explained that her time is spent helping the entire community,
not only those in the lower income brackets. She gives as her
services tutorial, helping with the Uncle Sam's Club, advisory the
Neighborhood Youth Corps, and working at the regional multipurpose center iu calcium, She is currently involved in organizing
a club for mothers who receive assistance under the Aid to Dependent Children program. having been here 2 months, she explained that her progress has begun slowly because she wants to
learn to know the people and to have them trust her.
The Grinnell League of women Voters is also interested In
the poverty problem, and particularly in housing problems. They
are in tile process of organizing a survey to determine just what
housing conditions are in principal and what may be done about
them.
College students interested in helping in the various bottles
ol the war against poverty in principal may do so by giving time
to the Uncle Sam's Club, by assistant teachers of the Head Start
program, or by providing aid in the League Survey For details
on available opportunities, place requests in the son mailing. .

Student Involvement
Robert Asbille in his letter to the
5&3 states that discussions on open
forms are dangerous. But the discussions have a greater significance than
the question. Even such a initial topic
as open forms gives the students the
opportunity to become involved in
some form of political activity.
In the general bloom following the
defeat of Senator Eugene McCarthy
in Chicago, it seemed that many
young people felt the time had come
.to turn away from standard political
activity, either to organize into secret
and military groups, or to simply turn
in on themselves, in an synthetic withdrawal to brandon the community.
,The system seemed to fail in what
many believed to be a clear case of
right and wrong.
The fact that thus far Grinnell students are fighting the administration
-—the campus’ symbol of the establishment—through peaceful means is a
Sign that the despite after Chicago
was temporary. The Senate’s proposal
for 24 hour open younger, which has
now been approved by the Committee
on Student Affairs, is an example of
this.
Of course, we hope that the students
here will move on to more worthwhile
enterprises. In this week‘s S&B there
Dancing
Editorial from 5&3, Jan. 21, 1911
. . . The developments of the past
few days have forced us to express
ourselves one way or the other. So
we are giving our personal view,
which is that dancing should be decor
sized by the College as a legitimate
form of entertainment.
To those who are dramatically opposed to this view we would like to
make a few suggestions: First, that
there is nothing interested wrong
about gradually changing or modelling any or all of the College traditions, They were formed for us, not
we for them. Times change and customs with them. For instance, dancing
is regarded entirely differently than
it was ten years ago. Anyone living in
a small community appreciated the
change of attitude.
recently, dancing in Grinnell is
covered by a fairly representative
body of people and not, as many
would like to suppose, by a lower
Strata of the student body.
shortly, that great numbers of institutions similar to Grinnell, recognize dancing and do not seem to find
pearl xadoia. sneenn shown
are articles on poverty in Grinnell and
the Uncle Sam’s Club, activities in
which students can do useful work for
the community.
A construction Proposal
An article in this week’s 5&3 sections that the coffee house has been
a failure. The failure of the coffee
house is attributable to Americans’
disease for the fiber courses that exist,
and their tolerance for the “dirty Water” served in this country. The coffee
house was a fine addition to the forum
in theory, but it has proved too unpopular to be charitable.
The game room, on the other hand,
has been a greater success than the
architects supposed it would be. There
are frequently long lines of students
wishing to use the pool tables, and the
bridge tables are often full.
It may be argued that the coffee
house serves the overview crowd from
the grill. It must be remembered,
however, that the grill serves the overview crowd of bridge players. By
construction another game room, the
bridge players would have more room,
and there would be more opportunities for those who play pool.
It would therefore seem reasonable
to convert the failing coffee house into
another game room. The college
should find the funds for the room’s
conversion.
the great and insurmountable difficulties which people say would issue
here. And, strange as it may seem,
these institutions turn out a fairly
good type of managed and womanhood — not so frivolous and elderly
nonsensical as not to compare quite
favorites with Grinnell products.
courtesy, that dancing would not
strike such a blow at the democracy
of the College as many property. Just
as it is now, each one would be free to
choose his own agreement, be it
louisville, comic opera, streaming, or
dancing. In this respect, we should
hope that dancing would prove a decided uplift.
We are not financing these as arguments in favor of dancing. As far as
we are concerned—and for that matter the whole Senior class — dancing
is not absolutely essential for a happy
life in Grinnell, We should show a
sad lack of initiative and individuality,
indeed, we did not in four years find
something well qualified to take its
place. Nevertheless, those who would
like to see dancing established in
Grinnell have apple ground on which
to base their argument.

Open forms issue
To the Editor:
A c a d e in i o institutions in
America, particularly the lib.
oral arts college, are in grave
danger of compression. The on
of our intellectual haven to inquire into and attack the institutions of America has forced
a federation of the Vietnam
war policy and started people
networking almost every aspect
of American society.
These are achievements the
academic community may well
be proud of. But in the process
we have made many enemies:
Wallace and Reagan pose a
very real threat to our freedom.
All students and faculty are
well aware of the restrictions
on academic freedom created
by the involvement of government in state universities However, the liberal arts college
also depends on economic and
political support from outside
its “ivory tower" -— to some
extent from government but
also from alumni and interested
philanthropists. The rapid rise
of tuition is clear testimony
that the financial status of this
college is very serious, The fact
is that the very existence of
the school may depend on acceptance with people who do not
like much of what goes on at
Grinneii. Continued academic
quality and academic freedom
is in jeopardy.
Yet we make our own defense even more difficult by
fighting amongst ourselves
about issues like the “open
forms problem," Much is
wrong with the present situation. Certainly We should talk
about our problems and try to
make changes. But our attack
on these problems is often an
massive, creature, and under1<
isaac. The college is only I
small part of a bigger comes<
city. issues in that bigger community are far more important
than social issues at Grinnell.
The time has come that Grinnell must begin thinking more
of academic integrity and less
of ”open forms." I have spent
two years listening and talking
about Grinnell and its problems.
I’m fed up. I want to team
about America and go out and
change it. The liberal arts edt-
nation gives a student a unique
ability to do this. But if we destroy the college in the process,
then we have detected our purpose. So then let me urge all
students and faculty to join me
in saying:
GRINNELL, GROW UP!

my own of September 23, I
found that it was indeed possible for the impression of an ex

that this is not the case.
The editorial which you quoted
contained a comment from
Doug Peterson, Student cover—

quoted as saying that student
selfcetermination over their pro<
date lives and group living conditions is “the everything principle by which so will be operating throughout the year." This
statement, part of an article
Doug wrote lot a THE CORNELLIAN Extra, received
campus - wide circulation before
the open forms election.
The philosophy of student
self-government in these areas
was the platform upon which
Peterson was elected SG President. His election came at the
end of a year in which greater
student awareness of their own
rights and power was manifest.
As you can see, the idea of
student self-determination was
far from new at Cornell. It was
not used to justify the SG action.
It was the framework in which
their proposal was created.

l Where the Truth Lies |
By DONALD STUMF
The evening before Richard Schneirov's trial last week, A
pleasant — looking freshman girl created me as l emerald from
the dining room and offered me a mimengraphed sheet. I expected.
I suppose, a proposal to have a like like; and I got a naked innovation of student power. It began, “Students have the power to
make the rules that modern them" and ended. "THIS is A TRiAbY
OF THE STUDENT BODY'S RIGHT TO SELF REGULATION.”
In between there was the explicit assumption that it is the student’s power that gives the right. To be created by such Machiavellian stuff so soon after dinner installed my stomach, especially the line, “If we stand behind Schneirov, we guarantee our own
safety." I wonder what kind of safety the Schneirov case can offer
anyone, especially the freshman who gave me the sheet.
Now I know that “safety" was used in a very limited sense
in the article. it meant safety from being finished, and as plate
proven, that is like safety from being sealed by a doctor. But ll
do not want to argue on the basis of systematic philosophy; few
men believe that truth lies in philosophy. 1 want to discuss safety in
practical terms, those of the hard, real world. Will student selling‘caution make students safe from the outside world and themselves?
First of all, Will the women of Grinnell have safety from the
onslaught of mail from their mothers? Letters about Schneirov'l
fiveeday registration will percent on the college by the bagfuii in
the coming weeks. Parents have spent 330% to send their measuring
t0 Grinnell; and they have done so With the understanding that (ha
administration, which writes the galleries and makes the rules.
would be in charge. Not only does the administration have legal
responsibility for the conditions in the directories, but it has a
moral responsibility to parents. How many parents would approve
of student rule in the calls? Can one simply turn over control to
the students without any advance gaming? Should parents be put
in the position of having to force their children to transfer in the
middle of their college careers it they do not like “home rule?"
At the very least, the college should give a year's warning before
any release of the being of government. in a system which changes
rapidly and industry, no one is safe.
Then what about the safety of the institution as a whole? in a
year when Richard simon is about to be elected President on a
conservative platform emphasizing “law and order," the time
hardly seems ripe for B college to bow to Student power. As I understand it, Grinnell. is in very tight ﬁspecial streets. i wonder it
the college can avoid the gold showcase now faced by Antioch and
Reed. Radical schools do not attract liberal donors. I hope that in
the next few days some of the faculty will explain the effects at
past radicalism upon the present treasury at Grinnell. if it is n
matter of life or death to the institution, who would hope for self»
determination?
The examples of Antioch and Reed bring up another pointer
what happens to the composition of the student body at school!
which have the regulations for being most liberal, not to say
advertise? At Antioch, I know, it has become opptessively ilﬂmtv
genesis. Is there no value in having people from a variety of
backgrounds, including such “conservative areas" as the midwest? is there nothing to be said for having voices to remind us
of Edmund Burke as well as Machiavelli?
I also wonder about the safety of anyone ruled by a student
government with the following record: one member of the C of Ti
units an SDS progaganda paper and allocated organizing issues
so that there can be only two alternatives; another member of
the C of T, whether intentionally or not, played the catalogue at
the Schneirov hearing, calling for a show of hands and power at
what was supposed to be a time of disinterested registration; a
third member of the C of T said, while considering the use 0!
student government funds, “You (should) never worry about the
majority;" the C of T as a whole called for fails to discuss “home
rule" when the decision on the Schneirov case was still pending
and the administration had not defined its position.
Finally, I would ask what safety one would have, under "horn.
rule," from people who do not show “considerable What will
happen it a student breaks a rule made by his peers and refused
to be personnel that he is being inconsiderate? Will students then
confirm him to his room, or ostracize him, or mug him? Will they
turn to the administration and ask that he be removed from the
hall? That would be embarrassing to say the least, How would students have handled the problems in Cowles Hall two years ago
without the power to finish their peers? Are most people satisfied
with the effectiveness of “home rule” in such matters as quiet
hours in which it now operates?
Of course I am only asking such questions to be universe. I
realize that what is meant by “home rule" is either no rule at all
or rule by a complaint administration, which will only interface
at the request of the student body when a problem has become
too ugly to ignore. It means having what one waan without any
annoying responsibilities on the side.
Oscar dildo once said there is only one thing worse than not
getting what you want, and that is getting it. if students succeed
in their power-play for “home rule," they and the rest of the
college will deserve to have if.

SELECTIVE SERVICE: DRAFT DEFERMENTS'
By DON HECKER
In the first or this series
of articles, I gave u- brief
explanation of the Selective
Service System’s philosophy of
"Cllanuelingi" At that time, I
said that according to the sys<
tel this was accomplished by_
use of classifications,
Classifications are' divided into three basic categories, service classifications (the begin<
trans is considered available for,
certain types or work or mini-
mary service), determines (term,
poetry exceptions from military service). or exceptions (a
permanent classification for a
registered who cart never be
available for military service).
. agreements are temporary
exceptions, granted to a begin<
grant while he is performing
some action that is In the national interest, or while he is
temporarily union for military
service,
Service classifications are
granted when there are no more
applicable determines H when
the registered is no longer doing anything in the national interest, or when he is not disabilities physically or manually, and when he is not needed
for the survival of a dependent.
Sole survivors sons in families
where one male member of the
family died or was totally disk
added in military service are
also permanently executed.
exceptions are intended to
be permanent, as in the case of
the 1V-F, in which the registered has on adverse condition
which is assumed to bo unchanging, and which presents
his ever being available for
military duty, Of course, if this
condition ends or considerable
diminishes, them is cause for
the Board to reclassify the reg
instant.
The local board is required to
place each registered in the
“lowest" possible classification
for which he is eligible A “low"
classification is a temporary
one, while a "high" classification is a more permanent one.
For example, if a tullrtime std.
sent at a college applies for an
170 (contributions O bj e c t«
or) classification, his draft
board may not place him in that
category, but can place him in
the 1175 category (student determine), since this may be the
lowest classification for which
he is qualified. When the 11-3
is no longer available, the reg.
instant may apply for, and pos<
silly receive an PO (or similar
classification).
A special determine which
is often extremely important to
college students, and which
used to be important to grad
students is the 175(C). The
Hm), also a mandatory classification, is a determine-for- one
academic year. it is granted to
an undergraduate student satisfactorily pursuant a course at
study who has received en induction notice. The determine
lists until the end of the academic year. It is not renewable,
and any student who has been
clauseﬁed in this determine once
can never again lie so clause-
' tied.
.This. classification is very im

for student before he has {indexed his last year of undergraduate college. Should the
student receive an induction notice, he may request and must
receive, an 1-S(C) until he completed the year of school that
he is in.
The I—Y classification is a
sort of mild IV—F. This classification is granted to those
persons who are physically until ’for service in the armed
forces except in time of national emergency. A national emergency individually, is most likely only to be a war.
Authority for determining LY
eligibility tests with the Surgeon General of the Army The
tests. to determine eligib' 'ty
for this classification are given
by the army at the induction
centers when a registered reports for a physical examination.

A ll—C determine may be one
of the few things in the world
that will make you wish you
had decided to spend the rest
of your life farming. This par.
ticulsr determine is granted to
persons for "essential agricultural employment," and is
something oi a leftover from
the 1940’s when farm production did not result in the aug.
surprised of today.
The ”-8 determine is the one
most of us are concerned with,
and the one we are most familiar with. when the proper con<
did'ons are met, it is a manuals
tony classification. There are
six basic conditions:
1. The Student must [9quest this determine from
his local draft board. .
2. His college has sent a
Form No. 109 to the regi5<
grant’s local board, indicating the registered is a lifetime student.
3. The student is receiving
credits toward a degree.
4. The student is taking a
dealtime course load (as {it}
fixed by the college).
5. The student is making
“satisfactory progress,” that
is, at the end of his first
year, he has received 25%
of his credits toward graduation, at the end of his sec<
and year he has received
50% of his credits toward
graduation, and so on,
6. This determine does not
extend past the student's
twenty-fourth birthday.
, This classification is also
mandatory 101‘ graduate std.

allied fields (subject to the ad

in graduate school is not a

Anyone who receives a never<

“extended liability" category.
This means that he may be

this is a means of preventing
a man from ”exciting" the
draft by disappearing into the
educational system until he is

not be granted. This is Still the
case {or men who have never

that the younger a man is, the

man has not yet formed many

A registered has certain rights
of appeal. he has the right to
a personal appearance before
his local board, if he sends the
board a request (or a personal
appearance within thirty days
alter he receives his original
notice of classification.
When he receives a classification as the result of a personal
appearance, he may also appeal
that to a state board. The state

Although not all persons interpreted agreed that the Forilm always served its purpose

Home Rule: Freedom or Anarchy
By SUSAN KAESER
Recent events have once again made the question of rules in
the residence calls of concern to the college community. The iu<
efficiency, sustainability, and irrelevance ot the present nlle strip-
, sure has been voices by many sections of the community. faculty
and administration. and has led to,the proposal of an alternative
structure. home rule. However. in considering this liable alternative many students are not aware of the concept involved, and
are unable to accept home rule as a possible structure
The problem seems to stem from the traditional nation or
rules. Previously, administrative policy has provided a set at
presentation rules as guidelines to limit student behavior. The reservations on hours, student use of the younger and residence calls
have defined what the student cannon do. The student is expected
to cﬂmply and follow the authority.
The idea of home rule is threatening to many because it dress't
tell the student what he cannon do. force rule to many is understood as being anatomy and company “freedom." Without prevention rules, [here is tear of law and order being thrown out the
window. if authority is removed and is not making rules, there
is no rule. This is a gross misconception of home rule. Home
rule can be a liable structure if those everything it realize its
meaning.
Home rule is a positive form of rules. lt is not a denial of
rules or of a rule. but a posing of positive “do’s” to replace the
traditional “cannon” form ol rule. The arbitrary authority set up
for the student to follow is replaced by students’ thinking about
their actions. The present rule system only gives the student n
choice of breaking or not breaking a rule. He is not considering
his actions beyond the fact of a rule violation. Home rule demands
of the student 3 consideration of the actual implications of his
actions as they select others as well as himself.
The printing of home rule is a recognition and challenge to
the student not in his ability to follow authority, but to develop his
own decision making ability. it is not a safeguard against some
unavailable action, but a stimulant to positive action. It is not
rulelessness, belt a freedom with responsibility beyond himself.
This greater awareness and this desire to develop as thinking individuals is the ultimate demand of home rule Educators and
students in a liberal arts institution should see this as being Very
consistent with their educational limitations and should willingly
accept the challenge or home rule.

When anyone travels though France and stops in a small town

EXTRA-CURRICULAR CREDIT CONSIDERED
The Student Coordinator’s or
(ice is currently involved in an
investigation working towards
a major change in this College's
curriculum. A “4-1-4" academic
year, somewhat the same length
as Grilinell's is now, with the
addition of a month long special
term in January devoted to independent study is being considered.
Student Coordinator Tom Trip»
left and his state have been
gathering information from
nearby colleges such as St. Olaf,
Westmar, McCalaster, and Beloit for the past four weeks concerning the programs at those
colleges. Generally, the programs are one month long in
January, occur as either oncampus or offrcampus study in
one particular field, and carry
academic credit,
A voluntary interim program

not carry academic credit was
offered at Grinnell during the
last ten days of the Christmas
and semester break period for
the past two years. Last year,
approximately three or four
hundred students registered for
the program, but only 1/, or 1/3
of those registered actually attended. The program was (liscontinued this year.
The chief difference, besides
length of time, between the 4-14 year and the interim program
is that the 4-14 is a “fully academic program,” according to
Triplett. Although independent
study in the January term of
the 4-H year would be like the

interim program, it wouuld focus on special problems that
cannon be handled in regular
course work, the faculty would
still be closely involved, and
credit would still be closely involved, and credit would be
given for such work.
The Student Coordinator plans
to submit a proposal of some
kind to the Executive Council
of the Faculty, after their are
territory work is completed, before the end [if this semester.
They are hoping that there will
be student discussion on the proposal, and that students who
live in communities where there
are colleges currently operating
with a 471—41 program will bring
back information on these pro«
grams alter mid — semester
break. Also, they intend to question faculty members on their
reactions to the plan, and how
it might interface with their
work or scheduling,
The Executive Council of the
Faculty will be the first body
to consider the proposal. The
council consists of the three
division chairman, the educati all policy chairman of each
division, an lat-large faculty
member, the chairman of the
faculty, the Dean of the College, and the President. Because of the failure of the in—
terms session last year, faculty
and administration are doubtful about the program.
President suggest told the
5&3 that, although he felt that
such a program had a solid
theoretical basis, “after the experience of last year and the
previous year," he would need
to be personnel that it. would
work, and “whether the students will respond to it.” Free
lesson Morris Parslow, a member of the Faculty Committee
on Curriculum which investigated many curriculum programs last year, expressed sim<
ilar feelings. He saw “no particular merit in 41-4 as something new and different" and
considered it mostly as a poor
modification of the interim
program and a “more form»
less way of the old system of
just given out credit."
Tom Triplett took the app0<
site view in arising int a
change: he views any new independent study program such
as the 4-1-4 program as a way
to get away from "the anytime-
rating nature of much of the
current curriculum "

Sports Editorial
By JEFFREY SCHECKTER
The construction of the new, badly needed cum-million dollar
athletic complex will undoubtedly push Grlnnell into a new era
of athletics, at least in the area of physical structures. The largest
segment of Grinnell “athletes,” thoserwha participate in intramural sports, Will gain less than do the variety teams.
Although exact figures are hard to assembly, approximately
10% or more of the male student body participated in LM. sport
during the four years here On the other hand, only twenty or
25% are actually involved in intercollegiate, variety athletic event,
Therefore, it is evident than an athletic department at Grinneil
should concentrate at least part of its time and effort on I.M.
sports. No one will deny that paper training. conditioning, coaching, and equipment are necessary to field a competitive variety
team. This, of course. takes a great deal of time and expense,
contracting from the amount available for [M sports.
The current intramural football season is a primary example
of just how unguided the 1M. system is There are ten LM. football teams, one from each form and the off-campus squad. This
totals about 140 players, or almost three times as many LM.
players as there are on the Ireshman and variety teams combined.
In suite of the fact that so many students are involved, 1
have never seen any member of the genetic department near a
game. Nor is there any help or aid available to a team.
The true LM. football game is played by men equipped only
with a few sellers, in an extremely poor state of repair, and
generally packing in fundamentals or conditioning. Each game has
two student referred with little knowledge of the rules and a tlmlkeeper, usually some wrapped specialty. No equipment or medical
aids are available from party nor is any person competent in
first aid present
Injuries are common differences during I.M. games. They
‘non from cuts and muscle stories to porn arguments, shoulder separationsdnd broken bones. A variety football player, injured in
a game or practice, has the benefit of prompt attention and the
whirlpool bath and first aid room at party. The her football
player is left to his own devices — or those of the lnfirmary.
It is topless to concern the present system without offering
another. I therefore propose that the intramural football system
be scrapped entirely or, more automatically, be put under partial
guidance of the athletic department. Good equipment. at least
good sellers, should be made available to all who request them.
One of the referred should be a coach or someone who has
been trained to detect the dangerous attractions of the rules
'which, at present, go on necessarily. in addition, each team should
be able to meet with the coaching staff or a coach to cover the
fundamentals important to safe football.
Without a change in the present LM, system, particularly
football, it is highly likely that a great many more serious injuries will occur. It is hazardous and stainless for anyone to continue to play l.M. sports in their present disorganized manner.
While we are spending money to private our stars —- how about
a little something for the common man?

freshman Team Beats Knox 34-20
By KRISTI SCHMITT
The freshmen Pioneers kept
alive s newly—originally winning
tradition by depending Knox 34.
20 last Friday at Galesburg.
It was the fifth consecutive will
in the last two seasons for the
spunky freshmen
Although Knox was a larger
team in both number and size
(Knox writing 50 players to our
15), the young Pioneers dealt
them a pierce battle. The team
led in the first quarter and
checked Knox with two quick
touchdowns, one on a fast
pass to Ed Hizsh and the
other on a blair pass or
Henry Corona. The next score in
the second period came at the
end of a yesterday endangered
drive by quarterback Bill Dicks
on a speak from the one yard
line.
The next scoring drive, added by the strong arm of picks
and his excellent receivers
Jim Plrolll and Ed l-first, was
gained with a quick dive by
feedback Al raymond from the
one.
vhs defense was spectacular
for the Pioneers in the
first half, with key interventions by Jim Pirolll and cocaptain Mario Bognanno, whose
intervention was returned on a
handling run of 7.0 yards. The
defensive standards included
the entire defensive line consisting of Ed first, Bill Wright,
Doug Watts, Al raymond and
Scott canyon. Backing up these
impregnablo five are Mario
Bognanno and Chuck McCeuley.
At the end of the first half,
the Pioneers through their
great aggressive play mistakenly let a deep receiver slip by
and a resulting score occurred.
This was almost too much for
the angry Pioneers, so Knox‘s
'attempt for the point was say-
mind by the onrush of the entire
defensive line. The score at the
half was Grinnell 28 and Knox
8i
With 30 minutes already under their belts, the Pioneers
charged out on the gridiron
for the second half. But as till
time chicken by almost too
slowly, the sparsely suffered
Pioneer team began to wear
down. In their self-remained way, they held the re.
actively fresh Knox squad to
minimal garbage and estimated
great ball control. With the of.
fence being directed by bill
Dicks and the defense by contains Mario Bognanno and Dave
passed, the Pioneers nutten out
the third quarter without or
losing a touchdown from Knox.
The Pioneers scored still anotha
er touchdown on a pinpoint
pass filled from quarterback
Dicks to surrounded Ed l-first.
The fourth quarter was a trying one, with injuries hamperin
the Pioneer squad. Corona a
Bugnanno were out because of
leg injuries, and Wright was
undefined because of a blow in
the side. With till! great did all- ’

or Fat Sam, Wright and Bognan:

Corona, containing an injury
that could be serious, sat out the
rest of the game in hopes he
could recuperate in time to face
joe at home Oct. 25.
Knox took advantage of this
misfortune on the part of the
Grinneli team to score two
touchdowns in the last period
to raise their standing to mat.

carriers Fifth In Cross County
By MICHAEL DALEY
The Grinnell Athletic Department sponsored the annual Les
’Duke Cross Country occupational
Meet on October 5. As in the
pest, great talent and compete
tion gathered at Grinnell from
the top small colleges in rows.
Although it was overcome and
it hit cool, the participants
turned in fine times on the
greeting Grinnell four mile
course. Despite improved times,
the Grinnell variety didn’t finish
as high as coach Ray when-silver had hoped. The Pioneers
finished a disappointing fifth
behind words College, St. improve, trackback Junior College,
and cleveland College.
Participants in the meet for
Grinnell were Bob Asbille, Rob
correct, Eric Jahn, John Luec—
ke, Tim Power, John Russell,
and John gilbert. With tremendous effort Eric Jahn was able
to finish highest for Grinneii.
Eric improved 2 minutes and 16
seconds over his 1967 time!
Another surprising sophomore,
Tim Power, ﬁlisted the d
tapes in 22 minutes and 51 seconds. He has improved almost
2 minutes over last year. The
third of the Big Three sophomore was John Russell, who
placed third highest for the
Grinnellians. Russell ran a beautifully faced race.
For the freshmen cross country team, the Grimeil College
occupational Meet is the highlight of the season. This year,
however, the meet lost some of
its excitement for two basic
reasons. First, brake University freshmen literally ran away
with the meet by taking three
of four top places. recently,
. only six of ten expected teams
showed up.

’the Pioneer variety winners
were back in Midwest Conference action once again on Saturday, Oct. 12, at Knox College,
in Galesburg, Ill. The final score
was decidedly in favor of the

Pioneers Mount injured equation
against Beloit Brown in Home Game
By REGGIE GRAHAM
Tomorrow at 1:00 pm. the
Pioneers face Beioit here for
our annual homecoming game.
Beloit goes into the game with
three wins in tour games. print
hell’s only Victory out of four
chances was against Knox.
That victory came last Saturday, and it should boost the
team’s spirit during the following week. The Pioneers are
tired of losing and the women‘
tue from the Knox game could
be a factor tomorrow.
There area't many players on
the Beloit squad this year, but
Coach powers says that they
are all capable players. They
are 3150 big, with the starting
sitemap and banks operating
almost two hundred pounds.
They have two good quarterbacks, one of whom is an eX‘
collect passed with a sentence
to complete the long bomb. 0n
the receiving end, shipped, a
split 5 n d wearing number
thirteen, will be a constant
threat to our pass defense.
Young, number thirtyrthree,
is supposed to be “as good a
back as any in the conference,"
according to powers; his running ability has gained him the
number six spot on the list of
the high showers in the conference,
on the Grinnell side, Gary
Johnson, ollr starting sopho<
more quarterback, has been
doing a line job. Each game
he does better and his passing
has improved tremendously (7
out of 12 complete at Knox with
no interventions). Jon russell,
senior feedback, is beginning to
get back into his best form, and
should do very well tomorrow.
Jon was second string all con-
{france in 1966, with a total of
383 yards on the ground to his
credit. Brian Barnes is another,
player who should do well tomorrow. Brian is a senior halfback; last year in thirtyrfoul
attempts he operated thru'
yards per carry. Tom Lower
has played very well in the last
two games, as has Steve
buildings, and they are both in
good shape for the defensive
part of the game tomorrow.
John henderson has proven his
ability as a receiver quite a few
times this year; he and Gary
Jones will be looking for
passes. Don Kraitsik has been
doing a fine job and should be
playing tomorrow despite recent injuries. Roy Lewis, a
sophomore back, has shown
what a capable runner he is,
but has been planned by injuries. Al Cloud probably won’t
be playing against Beioit due
to a severe knee injury, but
until he received the injury he
was having a great season.
Even though some valuable
players haven’t completely re<
covered yet, most of the injuries received in the game
three weeks ago have sealed.
The team is in good shape and
the spirit is great. it we can
show the determination we had
at Knox, and play as well as we
did at simon, tomorrow's game
will prove to be an excellent
battle.
 
place U’s Seek More Grinnell Games
As Soccer Club Displays variety Level
By YVOR STDAKLEY
John Hemingway, studentcoach of the Grinnell soccer
team, said on Monday that
contacts were being made with
the University of Iowa and
Iowa State University to try to
arrange games with the two
schools before the end of this
season.
Coach nemingway said that
U of I, impressed with print
nails 5 t r o n g performance
against them two weeks ago,
contacted the club by phone.
So far, scheduling arrangements have not been agreed
upon. The club is also trying to
secure a date with iowa State.
One of the complications in this
effort is that Grinnell's team is
a club rather than a variety
sport.
Thus far in the season, the
Pioneers have won three
games, deleaung Cornell twice
and Carleton once. and dropped
two, a 2-1 decision to Knox and
a 32 contest to the university
of Iowa.
month Hemingway feels that
the season has been satisiying
so far. He notes that the greatest improvements over last
year have been team spirit,
pride, and a real desire to win.
He feels that in suite of the
talent on last year’s squad,
these important qualities were
packing.
“The guys have shown real
good conferences," he come
center. “They show up for
practices and take the responsibility of staying in condition
upon themselves. As a studentcoach, I can only make suites—
tions. The responsibility is
theory."
Looking forward to next year,
the Pioneers should be in real
fine shape. The team will only
lose two players in graduation
— Dave North and Ray Hilhorn. While their loss will definitely he felt, Coach Hemingway hopes that the experience
gained this season by the five
