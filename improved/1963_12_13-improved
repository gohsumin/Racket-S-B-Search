1 Sunday’s Boar’s Head, 3 traditional Christmas dinner,
trusted into a two and one half hour display of foul language
and foul banners, as the men of North Campus treated their
faculty guests be an licensing valley of four-letter words in
the form of inappropriate trusts and uncalledvlor charts.
‘ The guests reached quickly and strongly to the humorless
display of credits. At first the faculty members simply consolidated on the feelings of the men at that meal. Winston King
(philosophy and religion) on Monday afternoon delivered an angry defence Lion of me event. However, today the 18 faculty
guests delivered a letter to students which goes far beyond the
Boar’s Head incident, The faculty said, ”This (the Boar’s Head)
is not an isolated incident.” It continued that the dinner was but
a simpson of a greater problem, that the college “cannon have
its character determined by individual and group lrresponsi»
bility."
“The generation of rules has brought neither majority nor
satisfaction to the students. The faculty has seen the academic
life it seriously guards seriously weekends by the comments
problems that it has sought to avoid. We have, in short, reached
.the point in the lifeof this college in whch there must be a power
reconsideration of internal operations if we are to remain effective as an educational institution," me faculty members stated.
The letter suggested a registration of the hall system, of
the role of the faculty in the social area, of the time and effort
given by students to college government, and of “the proper re-
atlonship of the two residential computer to each other and to
the total life of the College."
The letter closed, “We hope that something positive and cons
structure will follow recent events that have troubled us. The
residential college necessarily districts a student’s freedom.
(Those students who find the limitations interest in such an in4
ﬁstation should seek other places for their education. We believe, however, that there is a value in this kind of a college,
and we are determined to preserve it. We express our willing-
news to participate in a program for the reconstruction of a
united college community,”
James Hr Stauss, Acting President of the college, followed
that letter with a statement. In that statement he noted, “The
college has liberal policies containing to the student culture.
.Yet, instead as these take the form of rules, there is widespread
disrespect of them, More importantly, there is frequent villa»
tion of the premises upon which the college has approaches
student affairs — namely, that individual standards and proc<
titles will reflect individual selfrrestraint, responsibility, and
common sense.”
participation with college rules has not suspended in img
provide either the rules or the college.”
“Means must be found to achieve a ‘sterling down’ to the
main business of me college and to behavior appropriate to the
ideals of the college."
We find no argument with these statements, but can only
agree with them and with Peter woman, Cofl-lP President; Jack
sherman, SGA President and Marie Martin, AWS Board President; who said in a joint statement, ”The comments is filing.
it is time for all sections to forget about being opponents . . I
.The community has now recognized and accepted the problem
as its own and seems willing to act on it. This has the potential
for being the first step toward a serious appraisal of our system, the society it supports and promotes and the mechanics of
communication and intervention in that society,"
The statement concluded, “We would urge an honest and
critical assessment of the community so that steps may be taken to help us remain our equilibrium as rapidly as possible.”
Before us we have the statements of all three sections, all
zﬁbring to corporate. We can only add our agreement and our
one that if action follows, it will be construction.

Olcl S&B's Throw Colcl Light
On Past Christmas Seasons
By Karen robinson
Grinnell College has been an
ongoing organization for over
one hundred years, but rarely
do students have a sense of this
continuity. Some link with the
past can be gained by plumbing through back issues of the
8&3 for the weeks around
Christmas time. Here can be
seen not only the great changes
in the school, but also the con»
finding concerns.
December 31, 1919
"Grinnell College will hold
classes as usual during New
Year’s day according to the announcement of the administra»
tion this morning. . . ." This
move was caused by a “fuel vacation" when Grinnell ran out
of coal to heat the buildings.
Smith and years were kept
heated during the fuel break by
wood supplied by a crew of
(student) wood letters.

Not Boar's Head
But Boar's Head
Dear Dr. King,
The men of'CLARK HALL
would like to express their come
plate agreement with your letter concerning the actions of
the men of Grinnell College at
the Boar‘s Head dinner. Many
have stated that this was a
“mild” affair in comparison
with some winners of past years
and have thereby proudly tried
to pass it off and excuse their
own poor taste.
Although the men of CLARK
can proudly say that not one
of us allowed our sense of productions to become unbalanced,
We feel that because we were
a part of the men of the campus we must express our sin—
forest abilities for the disrespect shown to you, to the
o t h e r distinguished guests,
and to the student body itself.

Winston L. King scores Boar's Head,
Says Student Courtesy ls packing
To Everybody at Grinnelli
You took the words right out
of my mouth: The amazing majority of Grinnell students! I
have been hearing those magic
words from Grinnell student
leaders for a long time. But
now, after attending the Boar’s
Head Dinner, I know what they
mean!
What a appendix spiritsfilled demonstration of mature masculinity it was! What
COURTESY and CONSIDERATION to trustees and faculty
dining with them — a continued various selling and
boxing which made it'impossible for any of the ceremonial and most of the trusts
to be heard, or Christmas
carlos to be song — except
when the animals were feeding! What VIGOR — whole
tables full of GROWN-UP
men changing communities at
the tops of their voices]
What IMAGINATION ,- a
tremendous variety of at least
two of those vigorous newsletter words straight off the
walls of men‘s bathrooms
and grade-school preview,
used over and over again in
all sorts of fascinating combinations! What COURAGE
rising to short results at college officials from the safe
anonymous of a burning
crowdl
It does one’s heart good to
see such a responding demonstration of those qualities
which make Grinnell great and
her students ready for adult
FREEDOM. We must have obtained to at least a ten, maybe
even a twelveryear old level of
conduct on that occasion. Fiftee more years of development
at this rate will surely result
in some sort of super-majority.
And let’s wait for another
Boar’s Head dinner that long,
too!
Winston L._ King (religion)
P.S. We’re sorry that those
really mature junior women
who heard the “program" from
under the reasonable plan;
form, after “riding" there for
four hours, coupon’t have heard
it all, but were just able to get
out in time to have their pictures taken ‘with the grownups.
 
Adult Problem N
To the editors
Both the, Boar's Head Dinner and Winston King’s angry
letter “to everybody at Grinnell" manifest arbitration over
a situation which, despite
much well meant conversation,
has not found a portable solution.
The men of Grinnell want the
right to modern themselves as
“grown ups", yet childishly
(if amusingly) stuck out their
singles at those College leaders who must ultimately decide whether we are response»
bee enough to became without
their supervision.
Dr. King Wants mature Grinnell students, yet can do no
ends Compromise
our adolescent panties. The
students won’t became until
they're treated as adults, The
administration Won't treat students like adults until they became.
- This situation has been the
topic for heated rebates bee
green administration, faculty,
and student leaders. but no
portable compromise has
emerald, or seems pending. A
compromise is necessary.
Now, instead of planning for
the future and looking away
from the very real business
of the Boar‘s Head and of Dr.
King’s letter, let us face and
work with the contemporary
problem. everybody at Grinnell.
