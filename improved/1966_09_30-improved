such a complete set-up nearby."
Although an subsequent bus
schedule makes a Newton trip
inconvenient, centers says students can easily get rides with
friends; housemothers and even
the means themselves have
driven students in the past. centers believes the arrangement
is really much less complicated
than that involved in seeing a

According to contract, the
college covers the cost of the

In order for such a happy turn of events to occur, a

We realize that newspaper

To the Editor: In an age nominated by specifically Operated
devices, it seems only natural
that contemporary artistic culture should also experience
some degree of electrification.
Electric motors and lights have
unquestionably added the dimension of temporarily to modern painting and sculpture.
Music, too, has derived on electricity. Not only have radios and
photographs isaac music gun»
really available, but musicians
have successfully employed
amplifiers and tape recorders lo
produce sounds, the likes of
which could never be made
without electrical assistance.
Milton Babbitt of Princeton
University has expressed the notion that electronic music has
extended the sounds of music
writing. Whereas in the past,
computers were limited by the
physical capabilities of the per
farmers, the limits of electronic
music lie in the ability of the
human ear to pErceive.
At their recent concert in

gay young men known as the

“there is not so much hopelessness about change this year."
Added Linda, “Both admin-i

realize the gap that has existed between rules and what

we want to encourage them
