panama, modules junior, became
president ot the Grinnell Student Body. winning by a ma—
jority of 147 votes (Hala‘mai
462, Thomson—31o), he now
faces the task or putting the
new constitution into actual
practice,
panama will take office on
Wednesday according to the old
-constitution, since the new one
has not yet been l‘atlficd by
President women.
“The main concern between
now and spring vacation,"
says Ilalania, “will lie the
transition to the new form or
government.”
The election results are in a
sense a vote or confidence for
the present Student Council
administration; talking's plans
topic board more renaissance to
Krulilike’s ideas than did either
of the other candidate His
concern over NSA and the
whole realm or national affairs
indicates that perhaps the “yr-d
of the student.” is not yet ov.
It remains to be seen whether
or not panama can bring the
necessary qualities of leadership
and judgment to the ‘providence.
He sees the role oi' student
body president as an active one,
combmlng coordiatioii w i t h
leadership.
"An active president," said
panama, rings new and trash
ideas to the Council; he acts
as an indicator.”
Halnma considers the two
again problems cons‘routing
, the council to be making a
su- es ~jul and iimnettnitc
than‘ on to the new form
or government and maintain-
, ing the president satin consider
station oi national issues.
Some oi his immediate plans
include the setting up or a his
diesel committee to go over pie»
clients set by the AWS Board
and CufHP in Judicial matters,
a meeting or all people inter—
.enter in applying for the position or Senate speaker in order
to discuss what the lot) will end
tail, and the setting up or a
committee to study the best way
in which a transition ii-om the
old to the new court system
should be made.

Castro-land I
springs Christmas Vacation, Jim Gilbert, 21 senior at
Carleton College, spent ten days in what the American,
press calls “Castro-land.“ Since travel to that island is‘
now prohibited by the United States government, Gilbert
and the editors of this paper feel that some of his observe-
tions are worth hearings with students who are no longer,
permitted to see for themselves what is going on,
_ Together with 380 other Americans, students, houses
\i'ives, working people, businessmen and families, Gilbert
went on a special tour sponsored by the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee.
The star,’ printed below first appeared in Carleton's
paper The Carletonitln, and caused quite a star there. At
a coffee hour next Sunday, Gilbert, and Howard Weinstein,
' violent f own Chicago who also items Cuba not long ago,
hills discuss their views 01' the ’land, and slides will be
shown. The presentation will provide shine first hand background for the coming; Latin American Conference. This
is one you shouldn’t miss.

The Grinnell English department has discussed some changes
in the pattern or comprehensive
examinations for motors in that
department,
According
ment by
chairman
to an announce
Sheldon P. citizen,
or the department,
these changes will not affect
current senior motors in any
way. favors who are now seniors will have the choice of
proceeding under the old plan
or comprehensive examinations
or under the new setup.
All students majority in
either literature or journalism
will take a common examination
on 21 announced texts. Journalism students will, in addition
to this exam, write two exams
in journalism.
Literature motors will be
examined on two topics chosen
from lists established by the
English department. These stud
cents must declare the topics
upon which they are to be examined not later than the begins
king of the second semester oi
their junior year.
The department feels that
this new pattern of completed—
site exams will help promote
the studentsl mystery of the

mature specialization.

That evening we stopped at plays Giant AS We pulled into
his everywhere. Over 3,000 people had wanted all afternoon to
see the Americans who came as friends. We walked to the city
hall, and we received an contrary human flag. The people began the charts that characterize the revolution "venccremas"
(we shall succeed). But instead of “Cuba si, ranked no,” some
one started changing, “Cuba si, ranked si, lmpcrlallsmo_no,”
Perhaps. if anything, these Six words characterize the attitude
which I found that humans have toward Americans. They want
very much to be our friends, and they hold nothing against the
citizens of the U. S., but they feel at they have very well»
founded fragrances with American business interests and with
the American Government.
There are several questions which Americans are asking
about Cuba. Perhaps because of the reading 1 have done and
because of my trip to that country, 1 can suggest possible arts—
were.
IF CUBA WANTS PEACE, THEN ,WHY DOES SHE SEEM
BELLIGERENT? WHY DOES SHE PREPARE FOR lNVAsIONS WHEN NO INVASIONS SEEM LIKELY?
The answer to this is similar than most people believe. in
the first place. humans know Latin American history. They ii.member such things as the plant. amendment, and above all the
Alnericansenglneered overthrow of the government in Guatemala
about a years ago. They also have more information about our
present actions in Latin America than American Citizens do. They
have long known about our secret training base in Guatemala
first reported in the Nation, The New York Times, and finally
the Jan. 27 issue of Times magazine. Time has this to say about
the subject “The create tcounter.revolutionary organization)
is making impressive corporations: guerilla training camps in
Florida and Guatemala, arms-carrying FT boats that average a
trip a week to Cuba, an air group of some so floors who reportedly fly out of the mystery field at Retalheleu in Guatemala and
the practice U. 5. Marine Corps spa cocks airfare in Florida
. . . The create apparently gets all the U. S, financial aid to
Cuba's underground (estimated to range from $135,000 monthly
to as high as $500,000 on occasions) . . . i, l
It seems unlikely that U s. various will inside Cuba, but
if counter-revolutionarics trained on our soil and paid by our
tax money land in Cuba, is it any less an invasion by that
United States? By constantly accounting to the world that
the United States is financing invaders and itself plans to inside, Castro very effectively makes an invasion impossible
world opinion would never allow it.
WHY, IF THE CUBA-N REVOLUTION lS DOING so
MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE, DOES THE UNITED STATES
OPPOSE 1T so VEHEMENTLY'I
This is, the harvest question to answer, for nothing which
can be visited seems rational, Some say that we impose Castro
because he no longer allows freedom of the press and because
the revolutionary government has executed ooo war chemicals
But can this be true when we support artists with arms and
money to fight destroyﬁatlsta who is reported to have suffered zoiooo humans and featured countries others"
If we are so worried about the forms of democracy why
do we support Spain, Portugal, Honduras. formula, Etc? The
answer must lie in Cuba’s actions toward the United States
What unique thing has Cuba done to us? Only one—they have
taken property away from American business concerns, some of
whom charged exorbitant prices and isaac ciiortmous profits
while doing almost nothing for the people of Cuba.
Was it worth it to allow evaluation unemployment, disease
and illiteracy to continue to preserve the property rights 0[ a
few Americans. The people thought not, so they took over
American industry. The United States restricted by its ecol‘comic‘
enlarge.
WHY Is THERE A TRAVEL BAN 0N CUBA?
The most common argument is that Cuba is dangerous and
that humans hate Americans. From my experience, 1 can say
that I did not find this to be true. Yet the real proof lies in a
comparison with other countries. It we are worried about the
safety of our citizens why don't we impose a travel ban on
Belbgium during the recent roots therefithere are no roots in
Cu 3.
Only those trips to Cuba are allowed which
best interests of the United States." Unfortunately the real arts—
web to this question seems inescapable. The United States got»
ernlnent does not. want Americans to see what is really happen‘h
mg in Cuba.
Several other questions arise from a study of the human
situation. If we believe in the principles laid down in our face
law-union of independence and our Constitutionilhe basic rights
of man to life. liberty and the pursuit of happinessAthen why
do we try to destroy the human Revolution? Why does our press,
which claims it is free and objective, print half-trucks about
Cuba; wliv the edition-packed epithets such as “Castro’s boissl
versus, lefteleanlng Cuba" and “Castro—land?”
Why does the prev leave out the story of what the l‘evolur
tion is doing for the peoples Why do we hate the human Revolution when our own break with England brought confirmation of
property from counterrrevolutiunarlcs then called movies? Are
we favourites, or are we just innocent? is the United states
an arrival of freedom as it claims, or is it just an arrival?
