been not only one oi the best

a force for consciousness in hiv-‘

has been “something different”
about the school. It has created
a term in educational circles

When America is finally left behind, Miss LeFee’s future offers

SCARLET AND BLACK
Seniors leave Different famous;
(younger Seen As Striking, Solitle
By Sue Taylor
When the class of 1965 came to
Grinnell as pages, drive freshman
in the fall of 1961, we came to a
different campus from the one we
will leave bus afternoon.
The campus looked different and
it left different. Some oi the
changes have been the kind that
jump out and hit you in the face,
but some of them are more subtle.
The face of the campus has
changed. The fine arts building
and Roberts Theatre were new
when we arrived. career Plaza
was completed that first year —
if Il'S ever been completed. The
library was just one year old —
and the science building didn‘t
have its addition _ even partially
finished.
And the Forum wash’t here. We
were the first class [D live in three
unions. First there was the old
bargains —< We liked its “Warm"
atmosphere and its continental
memories. Then there was Main
hall basement. That, too, has its
memories.
But this year saw the opening
of a new millinnrdollar building
for the union—rat. We adjusted
quickly.
But it the new soon becomes familiar, there are some old things
that this class knew. Perhaps we
are dated because we really knew
plane greenhouse not just
heard about him. But we also knew
the era that he stood for. And it’s
an era that we have seen pass
from the scene.
Maybe it was more of a feeling
— an atmosphere, an attitude.
But it's no more.
Maybe it was enthusiasm. May
be it was just being able to have
fun — and have it wrtltout trying.
Perhaps it. \was knowing how to
 
taught. because that’s not something you learn in school.
Our freshman year, there was a
student variety show — complete
with legs contest and a twist contest # and now the twist is so out
dated that it takes courage to do it
in public.
We saw the beginning of liquorby~tlieri'com, and the new germany
ent greenhouse policy as opposed
to the Various “trial” programs of
open forms and open moms.
And we are really dated by being able to say that we integrated
our 2let birthdays at the old sex.
We witnesses the entire life of
the Ford Foundation grant and its
matching fund. The years of our
Ford were the print of several
jokes, but they also brought in
$6,000,000.
There were four years of active—
ties in politics — both kinds. Stu-‘
sent government had just been re—
organized when we came to include something new—the student
senate. And this spring witnesses
its death — and the advert of the
advisory council — just half as
much. So go cycles.
And in the world of real politics
— well, a lot happened. The names
of Humphrey. polyester, Truman.
Eisenhower, and others placed the
campus. The PPPE saw its great
moment.
Our freshman year was the first
quest-legal spring root. This year
may have been the last spring root
— legal or otherwise
There were changes in academic.
too. The JLA, and interim came
and went. R. R. Palmer’s History
of the wesley World Went and
came.
We've seen the coming of a new
dean of men and a new dean of
women — and we’ve been through
the end of the term of a president.
These were years of social con.
scmusness on campus a years of
concern with the movements which
have captured the imagination of
take the tianot having to be . young people all over the nation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One of the more popular relreais from the world of the
academic is the Forum's flush green pool mom — and a.

A lot of new things have happened on campus since we came.
A lot of growth has gone on. A lot
oi progress has been made.
But there is something missing
that was here when we came.
Maybe it’s a life style. It's something that has to do with knowing
how [D have fun. It's a kind of iris
mortality that just happens — it
inn‘t planned. Maybe now there is
more “inform'nudity” — fewer traditions more activities. But
there is a spirit, an attitude, an
