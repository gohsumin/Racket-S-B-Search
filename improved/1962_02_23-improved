Two editorials
The present seattle of candidates for the Student Government providence is charming. But perhaps it is just
what we need. For tale J'irst title in a long time we are
hearing people ask “What should student government do '3,”
instead of “What can it do?”
For the first time in a long title we are hearing
people admit to some of tile qualities of student modern,
ment. Namely, treat we are students first, politicians sec—
(ind; that perhaps student government should not see how
much it can accomplish but What it should accomplish
\. thin its limits.
The controversy which has shell brought about by the
Fox alld Henderson letters has turned up some interest‘
ing points concerning the proper role of the undergraduate.
'And these points seem particularly approach at this time.
M' Fox would seem to hold that students should
think, just i lawyers practice law and politicians engage
in politics. This, We think, is a rather domestic View, albert
a rather attractive one. Who worlds’t rather concentrate
Pope or listen to each than attend a Student Senate nieetz
il] We certainly would.
Mr. Fox has his point and it’s a valid one. But we are
more included to big ee with Craig Henderson alld Mike
for art, (W one ”Grey Matter” column in this issue deals
with this vcr subject). We think college is, as lenders
son says, ”not a place for ‘beginning' alone, but an upper-
[unity [or the student to test . i . ideas of other men as
i 11 as his own, and when he has made mistakes to evans te his action with intelligence.”
We think, as forward says, “Knowledge should gen—
state thought acid thought should lead to action, and ace
tion to more thought.”
Now where does all this put us ill relation to student
government at Grinnell? We think the point is this that
too many students became as Mr. Fox would suggest And
too many take the philosophy of Henderson and forward
too seriously. Both views are valid but there is a middle
ground that must be sought or student government here
will 1) atrophy or 2) go the way of the I\ lkenny cats.
We are presently suffering from a reaction from too
much government, too much action. And the pendulum is
beginning to swing ill tale opposite direction. From too much
1 union we are going towards no action at all. The fact that we
may have no need for a student government convention
this year is evidence of this. No one wants to take on the
SGA providence because the job. which reflects the character of the government it heads, has become to large a
task, too complex a position.
Again we point to the mid-g 'fund between secretary
contamination and magnetic activity for activity’s sake.
.We must find that middle ground and return to student
government at Grinnell a practical philosophy of operation.
Government at Grilincll has accomplished much in the
past year. But unless we take stock of where we are go,
ring that work may be all in rain. The Student Government Association was institutes as a cure for our former
inefficient Student Council form of government. We have
cited many of the businesses of that form, But there
is a point at which to stop — a point at which to reality
a revolutionary philosophy which w s institutes to pull
government here out of the doldrllms. It was necessary
that we began to see what Student Government can do in
order to escape such horror.
But now is the time to stop alld decide what our soil-
.sent government should do.
Vi’e hate to write an editorial like this one. Frankly,
we do it only to wars our readers not to expect too much
of a society like the one we have at Gi-initial.
“7e refer specifically to the recent cheats of a $150
'Polaroid Land Camera from the biology department last
Thursday and of between $150 and 00 from tablets 01'
athletes competing in last Friday‘s qlladiangular swim meet
here.
' We make this point: The 13007131us students and faculty who make up Grinncll College can never afford to or»
erlook the fact that a men of their number might be quite
capable of theft.
And it would certainly be fully to think that discovery
persons from outside the college community have any less
access to campus buildings and events than other controllers people.
Those who forget that no society is completely safe
from an occasional theft — and certainly not a society
so founded on the integrity of its members as is Grimlell‘s
— will continue to have provisions stolen. Be careful.
