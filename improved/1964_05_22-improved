Spring stayed away just long enough to rain many
Spring Day plans. It arrived last week-end in full
force to other in two hectio weeks of term papers,
exams, and comprehensives. But despite treasures,
many students have moved their ”library” and typewriters too out onto the campus grounds.

The student Senate voted 18'
to 17 Wednesday night to con»since paying $275 a year for
Grinnell’s affiliation with the
National Student Association
Marilyn Alt began debate on
the question of discrimination of
N. S, A. by saying that “I
haven’t seen the positive effects
of N. S. A. on the Grinnell Campus. I have voted for it for
three years, but I no longer see
that N: S. A. has a place on the
campus.”
Phil Johnson, S. G. A. President, argued in favor of the
national organization. He asked
“what are you going to replace
N. S. A. with? N. S. A. works
in the area of academic freedom, in the civil rights movement, and if we leave N. S. A.,
we would have 'no role in making our Voice known in national
student affairs? Johnson also
pointed out that N, s. A. was
considered to be representative
of student views and that members of N. S. A. certified before
congressional committees and
other agencies of the U. S. got<

Jack sherman, former S. G.

Johnson overstate: the impact
of N. S. Ai’s statements before
congressional c o m m itunes.”
sherman indicated that N. S. A.
was only a small voice on a

Grinnell students play a. role in
national affairs, but it is not

The debate rated on with
Evans, Patrick, and Weyrauch
speaking against N. S. A. and

Because of the concern of the

fact that Grinnell does not

Stephen B. Wood, dean of men,
certified the situation for the
senate. Dean Wood noted that
“Grinnell is spending more
than five times the amount of
any other college in the A. C.M.
on services to students who
have problems." Dean Wood
also indicated that a clinical
psychologist is not able to disclose all the cases which con.
front him, and that only an entire staff of trained men would
be adequate in meeting the
problems. Such a staff would
involve too large an expenditure of money.
Dean Wood said that he
wanted to make it understood
that “the college is spending its
resources in this area and that
Grinnell has contributed to the
master County Clinic. “This
clinic will provide psychologia
cal services to Grinnell students. The senate decided to
gather more information before making a decision in this
area.
Jim harrison, Speaker of the
Senate, announced that in a

S. Eugene Thompson, a 1953
graduate of Grinnell, has been
appointed to the position of
Dean of Men, President Howard R. women announced this
week.

his new post in September, is

While at Grinnell. Thompson
, was a communist for the see,
a member of the radio station,
and a member of Sigma Delta
Chi. He was also active in
drama, forecasts, men’s government, and campus covers
ment. He managed in English.
 
Thompson is married and has
two sons. His wife, the former
Elma Johnston, is also a Grinnell graduate. She managed in
music and elementary education.
“Mr, Thompson is a young
and vigorous person," noted
President women. “He has a
deep interest in the college and
in working with men. I think he
will prove to be an outstanding dean of men.”
As a member of the 5&1},
Thompson wrote a weekly col<
umn. Below is a sampling of
his column.
September 1957: "Strange as
it may seem, there are still
some people who refuse to believe the old and peculiarly
American lie that one must
JOIN to be successful. Some of
the world’s greatest men have
 
been quite horrible mauritius,
misanthropes, go- -it flowers, and
social levels. And some of
them have even been happy at
the same time.”
January 1958: ‘I’m convinced
that this campus needs more
nature, more intelligent fundraising, more nursing and lilbel, and more dissatisfaction
in student affairs. We could
never find half as many things
in administration and faculty to
object to as we could easily
find among ourselves, if we,
looked."
May 1957: “trim-tell, like any
other institution, is made of the
people who attend it and attend
to it. It’s regarded as one of
the best because its people are
some of the best. a fact which
never fails to make me think
of green pictures and sum

In his final chapel appearance as President of the college, Dr. women illustrated that he has not abandoned for
Grinnell those high ideals which he believes can make the
college fiber. During his years here, President women has
held the notion of the independent learned in a free society
parameter. In his Game of Numbers, dedicated on May 8,
he presented additional proposals offered in the Game of
Numbers two years ago.
Most important to the student in these proposals is the
attempt to eliminate pressure without increasing the quality
of education. The comprehensive exams, both on liberal arts'
and in the major field, would take on greater importance,
blit preparation would be more consolidated toward this
end. The liberal arts exam would be given to sophomores”
or accellerated freshmen, when the student had finished hist
preliminary liberal arts courses. The interim session, ask
such, would be published, and the time put to better use:
during the whole of the semester. After passing the firewall
arts exam, the student would be prepared to enter completely
into study in his major field. The comprehensives, under
this system, would be more carefully planned, more confidentiality prepared for, and of greater value to the student
and his record.
Especially designed for elimination pressure is the pro
based revised in the trading system. The right A, B, C, D, F,
categories which often cause the student to seek out easier
courses or processors for the sake of packing up the gradepoint, or wllich disciplinary heavily against the borderline
student would give way to a high pass, pass, and fall system.
The wider boundaries would most certainly take away some
of the fine lines that honor societies and grade schools appreciate, but it would give greater opportunity for students
who church the gradepoint ladder to engage in something
other than “self-service."
The independence in learning is most avidly supported
by Dr. women in his view toward a modified tutorial system
in which students would be engaged with faculty motors during their college year on a regular and extensive basis. Independent accomplishment would be measured and directed
y the faculty tumor. Immediate student concern with this
proposal was that such a system be definitely improved from
the freshman advisor system now in operation. It would
take a competent and active faculty to provide the number
of qualified, interested motors needed. The heavy responsibility here would be in choosing the motors for each student
and for allowing for flexible change within the choices should
students become dissatisfied with the motors chosen.
It would most likely be necessary, as the President has
suggested, to have two major groups of motors, one for freshmen and sophomores, consolidated in the liberal arts, and
one for seniors and seniors after they have selected their
major field.
Although a great deal has been said about the Game of
Numbers during the last two years, the same old contest
is still being played here semester after semester. Everyone seems aware of treasures on the students and of the
liability of the present course-faculty system to take on any
real movement toward student academic freedom. The interim
period has only been a frustrated attempt to accomplish in
two weeks what necessarily demands four years. Students
agree with Dr. women’s ideals, but wonder just when action
can be or will be taken. Are they going to be removed from
our sphere when the President moves on, remaining in the
office files, and in the old copies of the S If; B as only “wellsald thoughts?” LD

Considering the fact that the
cost of cataloguing a book usuv
ally equals its purchase price,
the annual financial loss to the
school approaches 38000. In ad
action to this financial loss, the
scale disappearance of book;
indicates a disregard for processors who must plan their
courses and for other student:
who must complete their required work.
Faculty concern over this
problem has resulted in extensive study by the Faculty Library Committee, Several solutions have been presented, few
of which are complimentary to
either the Faculty Committee's
or student leader’s connections
of student responsibility, Whether international or purposelul,
the permanent removal of books
from the library cannon be generated.
Perhaps the students are not
completely aware of current
library policies. For instance,
a book may be checked out i definitely it it is not in immediate demand. There seems little
cause for books to disappear in
the process of completing assigned work.
Beginning Friday, May 22
and continuing until May 31
there will be boxes placed in
the directories for the purpose of Collecting “followed"
library books. We hope that
students Wlll realize the gravity
of the present problem, return
any books which they have not
checked out, and utilize the library’s present checklist pro<
centre.
It the students act now there
will be no need for the intro—
auction of a system which
would be distasteful to students and faculty alike.

[0119- Campus shirts in Emphasis
from service to nursing libs ry
By Susan Taylor
“I think the way in which the _ ..
college sees itself has changed,"
Dr. Winston L. King, Rand Pro«
lesser of Applied Christianity
and Roberts Honor Professor
for 1963-64, said when asked _
about the’changes he has ob-
served in Grinnell over his fit» ‘
teen-year teaching career here.
“There was a stronger tendenoy when 1 first came in 1949 to
think of Grinnell as a church~ ‘
related college,” he said.
"There was more of a religious
context.”
King, who will be leaving
Gl’lonely to assume teaching
duties at Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, Tennessee, in the
fall, came to Grinnell in the
194950 school year to assume
the position of Dean of the
Chapelea position
held until this year when he was
believed of his pastoral duties
to device more time to teach»
ing and writing.
Explaining the combination
of the religious and the academic; in the very nature of the position of Dean of the Chapel,
King commented that he was
increased by the mixing of these
two areas. As the position itself
has changed over the years,
with increasing emphasis on
the academic, King also has
noticed a similar change in the
nature of the college.
Grinnell has evolved from a
Christian Liberal Arts College
to a Liberal Arts College; he
said. "I really don’t know What
Grinnell thinks it is now."
King explained that the institutional expressions of religion
mean less to this student generation than to Grinnell std-

cents in '49-’50. Most students
do have journal church connections, he said, but he noted a
“change in o’he religious climate from institutional to
something else.”
“Students today are much
more concerned about the areas
of social justice,” King said.
The early fifteen were more
placed, ”I notice increasing
concern on the part of students
in the areas of politics, integration, and specific social con‘
terms,” he commented. He saw
the student body as ”much
more alive now than it was
then” in these areas. “This social concern has become a moral equivalent for religion," he
said.
King saw “not a true irrellgiousity. but a shipping into oth<
er channels.” He said there is
a “good bit of instructions,
non—institutionalized religious
interest and concern." Students
are facing basic questions such
as the meaning of life and models, and of what personal relationships should be.
”This indicates a greater
moral sensitivity on the part of
students,” he said. Explaining,
that this sensitivity is “sports" in that students can become
very concerned about the
meaning of life and yet Still
steal $7,000 worth of library
books annually, King said this
indicated a ”strange unconcern
about other people." ‘
Other changes in the campus
noted by King included an increase in‘ cultural programs.
This, he said, gives the religious programming more competition, because it cannon as<
some an open field. There has
also been a shift in the significance and the status of the
Board of Religion, according to
Dr. King. “In the early years
 
that I was here, it had a great

deal of practice, many went on
from the providence of the
Board to the providence of the
Student Council.“
King also noted a “more
highly professionalized attitude
on the part of the Grinnell Faculty" in the last fifteen years.
There has become an emphasis
on “proficiency in one's specialty,” he said. This leads to a
tension with the traditional Concept of liberal arts education.
Grinnell, he said, has also be»

college. There are more students from the Eastern keyboard communities. Also more
students from Grinnell are going on to graduate school.
Grinnell has always had a
great “esprit de corps" according to Dr. King. However, he
commented that perhaps this
sense of community has not
been associated with the college, yet a significant amount
of it still remains, though faced

of some playing inconsistencies
In the voting procedures. Some
lazy and negligent civil services

However, it is erroneous to stigmatize the whole references
as a force. No wonder the
Ghana press reported that the

were definitely connected by evil
neocolonists in Ghana. ‘For
there is no doubt that at least
80% of the voters are already

“Nkrumah is still an exIz'emily popular leader and
there is little doubt that his
party would win any offered-

How any possible person can
make such a statement and at

To give an example which

Chicago Daily News (columnists Addresses Grinnell
0n Difficulties. Rewards of Newspaper Profession
| By Ann character
"The purpose of my column
Is to make people think," assisted Sydney J. Harris at the
Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sig<
ma Phi spring dinner and Matrix Table last Thursday.
Writer of the daily column,
“Strictly Personal” for the
Chicago Daily News and the
Publishers Newspapers Syndicate, Harris spoke on the series of a communist with the
above goal. ,
The first april is no one really
believes in the freedom of the
press. “You believe in freedom
lip to the point at which the
writer stops pointing his finger
at your neighbor and starts
pointing it at you,” he charged.
He explained that me communist often becomes typical because his critics seem ‘indefatiguable in writing long and
semirliterate letters to the editor' while no one written to
praise a column.
Publicity seekers pose a
threat to the communist
"countries individuals, trading
the heavy wine of notoriety,
will resort to any method to
get their names in print Some
will even settle for an unavailable mention.”
Besides those looking for personal fame, there are the new
.pre with a mission. The journal»
ist is forced to spend many
hours a week listening to these
“save-theworlders."
“Friendship,” H a rris an
founded, “is the most dangerous pitfall of any newspaperman and perhaps of any man"
When a journalist starts living with the people he is trying
to write about, corruption begins to set in. “The communist
relinquishes his professional
liability; he becomes a lap dog
instead of a watch dog"
The communist must avoid
taking himself too seriously—
confusion himself with God
“The good communist always
 
‘k ‘k *
keeps in mind the possibility
that he may be wrong.”
But the opposite side of this
coin, confusion the people with
God, is just as dangerous. car«
his does not believe in “giving
the people what they want."
Harris switched to talk about
his personal experience as a col<
umnist. '
“I am frequently asked,
‘Where do you get your material? and I always reply, ‘I steal
it.‘ n
He claims that few people
read anything worthwhile today, so the field is open for a
re - interpreted of traditional
ideas “The professional writer
is always reading; a writer who
stops reading stops thinking."
* * *
Another question people often
ask is, “Don’t you find it hard
to turn out a column every
day?_” He does not have difficulty finding topics and believes "the man who has to
slave away at a creative job is
not in the right job"
Harris always tries for poverty, outspokenness and a personal approach in his column.
“Beneath the flimsiest subject
1 try to insert a serious vein."
Speaking of the reasons for
becoming a communist Harris
