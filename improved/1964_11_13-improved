And then what? Then, according to Forum Committee
Chairman Steve puzzles, “lots."

buyers, “suggESstthe period,

“The chorus is realized in

Shame of Empty deals
‘ The local chapter of Phi Beta happy and its distinguished speaker were the victims this week of the\ new plan to
hold special chapel services on Wednesday night rather than
the usual Friday morning slot. The chapter could have chosen
no more frequent member of the college community to address
their group and guests than Evelyn partner, yet participants
and visitors alike could not help but note that on a campus
starting academic excellence, only a harmful of students and
faculty members could manage to attend an event attending to
that excellence.
Those who plan the schedules of chapel events had no
choice but to place such events in the earnings after the administration added an extra class hour on Friday earnings But
those who plan and those who influence those plans should
take immediate need to the warning and do something before
more organizations are embarras‘sad and more speakers spend
their labour on just a harmful.
Students, meanwhile, will try to warner sympathy for their
tough schedules and the lack of time to fulfill those schedules,
land we can certainly see that tO take an hour out late in the
morning is touch easier to do than to take a piece out of an
evening. Yet, wllile they face the situation of having the lectures at night, we can only say that to refuse to attend because
they think they don’t have time is Only using poor judgment.
In almost every instance they miss out on something worthwhile. Certainly this was the case Wednesday night.

freshmen in every form. In fact, things were going just too

' Dance IM’s are coming. Certainly the highlight of the Quadrangle activities for the fall semester, Dance IM’s have always
stood as the single time each year when the members of the
Quad get together to put on a worthwhile show and have lots
of fun doing it. Now, few care.
Perhaps the worst part Of the situation concerns those
freshmen ill Main and Loose, whose calls have already dropped
out of competition for lack of interest. They have been shortchanged by their hall treatments and haffleboards. The constraint from hall officers has been —— well, the freshmen didn’t
sign up. Our complaint is — you didn’t tell them. A piece of
paper on the hall bulletin board has very little claim to freshmen interest, but an enthusiastic upperclassman who can tell
them just what the program is all about and how much fun it is
can fill many a signup sheet. Let’s hope that the women of the
Quad don’t follow the examples set by Main and Loose and
allow themselves to be parameter by apache. Integrating the
forms has spread the Quad’s life blood much thunder. Right

About ARH Steps
To the Editor:
As a freshman I have been
pleased with life and service
at Grinnell. However I do have
an observation to make.
Several weeks ago I nearly
met death in ARH. As I calmly
journeyed from class to class
I shipped down the states in
ARH. Had it been only one
flight I might have overlooked
the hazard, but it wash't and
I’ve been hobbies ever since.
Seeking sympathy I mentioned
my accident to the girls in the
form. Instead of sympathy I
found only the knowing looks
of those who had fallen before
me.
We fallen women would like
to suggest that some safety
predictions be made to guard
against serious accidents in
ARI-I. Because the metal step
guards are worn, they are extremely dangerous. From all
reports the danger will only be
increased with the Iowa snOWS
and wet boots.
For the sake of all, I urge -
B&G to either level all two
story buildings or make the
ARH states more sale.

trail Describes Mississippi Experience — Wow About Us. '
(EDITOR‘S NOTE: The
following is taken from a letter written by picks Mittlelellldt, ’63, who is now a student at the Yale School of Diyinity. The letter was written
on Oct. 8.),
Last week the National Council of Churches issued an emergency call for ministers to
one down to McComb, mississippi. l was one of the three
from here who went to McComb
for a week. Bear with me for
awhile for I would like to take
the time to relate some of my
experiences.
First a little background on
' McComb. . . . McComb was
the first city to have any “northern operators" enter and try to
attempt to organize the metro
community. This initial action
was done under the auspices of
SNCC in 1361. Because of lack
of interest on the part of the
furthermore and a lack of money the project was disappointed
As soon as the furthermore
moved out of the community,
the White citizens of McComb
took the opportunity to put the
degrees “back in their places."
,There followed a prolongEd period of bookings, settings, police harassment, and the like.
It was not until a year ago that
SNCC moved back into the
community to stay no matter
what The program expanded
this summer under the direction of COFO (Conference
of generated Organizations),
which sponsored a strong Mississippi Summer Project. Then
came the fall when many of the
students working there had to
leave to return to school. Again
the reservation of the white citizens was felt. As you may have
read in the press reports
,(what ones there were), there
have been fifteen bookings,
eight earnings of homes and
churches, plus continued are
tests, settings, and police harassment since th e beginning of July, with the majority
of these occurring in September. The total metro common»
its was, cordless to say, memorabilia. The National Council of
Churches wanted white and metro ministers from the North
to go into McComb to offer
some balance of power. Hopefully some of the reservation
could be started by having
persons in the area who could,
at any time, call out of the
state and to their local newspapers listing stories on the
config'ons in McComb.
Moving on from an ”objective” account of what was
happening, I would like to
encourage some of my personal expressions about the trip.
Dave, Jim and I flow from
New York to Jackson. The airport in Jackson is outside the
city, so we climate into the
back of a licensing for the trip
into the city. No one said a
word to us the whole trip, except one southern gentleman
who asked me if it would be all
light if he looked a pipe. (My
first and last contact with the
white, realistic approach to the
white woman.) All during the
trip the three of us, were constantly watched in the side
mirrors. What amazon me was
how we were immediately tax-
 
en for “considers." I later asked
a student here from Mississippi
why this was. His answer was
that the way we dress, our
mannerisms, and, especially,
the cut of my hair gave us
away immediately.
When we arrived in J person,
the other gentleman in the him<
online had their bags _carried
by metro posters in one direction. The three of us picked up
our bags and walked in the opposite direction into the metro
community. I did not realize it
at the time, but with that action of entering the metro com—
munich I was thereby barrel
from any further possible contact with the white community
for as long as I was to be in
Mississippi. In a sense, we had
changed identifies and were
now, for all practical purposes,
black (This was less true for me
because I am a white woman.
The hierarchy of life in the
South seems to be a very fundamentalist God, the white wo<
man, the white man, the metro,
and the ”bigger lover.” Given
this hierarchy there w are
months when 1 was an asset to
the group I was with, and there
were other moments when I
was decidedly and frightenly
(sic) a death warrant.)
Once Within the metro community we went to the office of
the National Council of Churches (NCC). There we were
briefly somewhat on how to
act in event of violence or potential violence, badly enough
this session helped to calm me
somewhat. For the night before,
before going “calmly” off to
sleep, 1 had'spent some time
trying to think out how I would
act in the different situations.
In one instance I had decided
that the best manner to contract a hosting job would be
to attempt to establish some
support with the person who appeared to be the leaders This
could be done by asking if he
knew my name or where I was
from. This was precisely the
strategy described to us. It’s
odd. . . . once in a new‘framework of thinking the fears that
gathered one at the beginning
are the accepted facts of living.
The problem then is not what
the situation is, but how to best
cope with it.
 
From Jackson we went to a
small town about twenty miles
away. The car We traveler in
was a perth rent-away car,
They are fast, and air conditional. The air conditioning
helps because all traveling is
done with the windows closed,
the doors locked and the seat
belts securely happened. perth
now when meeting to the NCC
immediately respondents the
dome light with all the doors. ’
This is so that one will never
be silhouetted in the dark and
thereby be an easy target This
was a practitioners method
learned by the death of Medgar years. ‘
In Edwards we changed cars
It was disk; we had over mighty
miles to travel; We did not know
the way for sure; the man who
was funding us had been picked
up by the police on the road to
McComb just that afternoon;
and now the car was integrated.
Since white women civil rights
workers had only been allowed
into the McComb area two
days earlier, one of our. concerns was would my presence
be an visitor not? As we traveler we were followed by p0<
like in various small towns
along the way, but were never
stopped for “supposed” traffic
violations. This was an encouraging sign.
We arrived in McComb and
went immediately to the COFO
groundsr COFO has two houses
to house the workers and one
building used as an office. Now
there is a permanent staff of
eight workers from all over
the nation — Oregon to New
Yorkia‘iso there is a girl from
Germany, one fellow from Canada, and another from England.
I was very impressed with the
calm, providing atmosphere
Each person was there by
choice and that is all that is
asked. There is a job to be done
and it is carried out in a calm
and effective manner.
Every night persons take
turns standing guard. The purpose of the guard is to wars
more who are sleeping of depending danger. Earlier this
summer the Freedom House
where the workers sheet had
been bombed—no one was in—
tired, but this was due in part
to the warning system, The

“Hypocrisy has been an out-heard cry on the
Grinnell campus concerning a wide variety of subjects.
I would like, however, to explore the “hypocrisy issue" in still another area — that of the Grinnell athletic world. This issue, of course, could be philosophical1y discussed as to the place of athletics at a liberal
arts institution such as Grinnell. However, I just wish
to examine the hypothesis that Grinnell purposes a
level of athletic competition which, in fact, does not
exist. Whether the level of competition which in sexuality does exist is good or evil is not my concern
here, I am merely assessing its existence.
Let me begin by hunting first the Grinnell College
Bulletin “Athletic competition is not allowed to inter—
here with the student’s primary purpose at Grinnell,
that of obtaining a good liberal arts education,” and
recently Football Coach add powers in the Bill prison column of the Des points Tribune (May 7, 1962),
“Not a one of them (Grinnell athletes) was requested,
and not a one is here on an athletic scholarship. Every
scholarship is strictly academic" It is this image of
“keeping athletics in their proper place" that I believe
Grinnell attempts to project to the public.
In reality, however, we are a school which states an
admissions man who, among other things, is assigned
to recruiting (I use the term closely) athletes The
coaches and interested officials can often be seen eating lunch with prospective GrinnelI athletes, and
counting them about campus in a way which could
be reserved for those with 800 College Board'Scores.
The effectiveness of our “recruiting" program is
estimated by the fact that although only some 50% of
the student body claim Iowa or Illinois as their home
state, 25 of 32 or 78% of the football players must do
so. Of the remaining seven, three mail from Minnesota
and one lived in Iowa when he started here as a fresh—
man, Meanwhile Carleton supposedly our chief academic final in the Midwest Conference claims only 19
of 45 from Minnesota, 8 from Illinois, 5 from Wisconsin, and in all 13 states and Canada are represented on
their roster. As a result of this program, although I
have no specific information, I question whether
scholarship or admission is granted on “strictly" academic grounds.
In addition, there exists an opportunity for the
newly arrived non-intellectual “rock" to exist and indeed often to arrive on Grinnell society. The “rock”

By Wayne Stengel
Wednesday evening, November

,voted to portions further considerations of a bill by Senator Dennis

high school students," until a regularly scheduled Senate meeting
on November 18th,
Senator Murphy's bill was kept

Dan Bucks of Gates to delete the
second of its two proposals which
would establish a committee to
suggest means of “improving and
proceeding" the admissions requirements at Grinnell College.
Buck’s motion, overwhelmingly rejected _by voice vote, provided his
expressed opposition to the entire
bill for fear that its adoption would
bring strong criticism on the Senate for moving into this area at administrative affairs. Senator vol'd

Using statistics gathered from
the freshman classes entering
Grinnell in 1960 and 1963, Murphy
fighter that only 860 completed an
promotions reached the admissions
office in 1963, causing admission's
officers to reject one half or less
of all those applying, an occurrence somewhat inexplicable at a
small distinguished liberal arts college. t
The College Board Scot-e median
for the class entering in 1960 was
sufficiently lower than that of any
of the schools which Grinnell nor
rally likes to consider its intellectual rivers. Though the College
Board Score median has given as
of 1964, Murphy feels that Grinnell
consistently laws behind its academic competitors because of this
recipient liability to make itself
known in all parts of the country.
The first eligible aspect of his
bill would be the formation of a
student committee to find out how
the members or the student body
and alumni became interested in
the college and why they made
their final decision to attend Grinnell. Senator Murphy declined to
comment on more specific implementation of his resolution until
