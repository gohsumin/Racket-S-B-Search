TiiE PAPER AND THE Follllhf
The staff of The Paper, the artificial student newspaper of
Grinnell College, has been denied permission to distribute Copies
of the October 26 issue in the College Forum.
There are several arguments for warning The Paper from the
registration area in the Forum ~ We find them all assure.
The primary objective is lack of space, voices by Mrs. Hawk
and Miss Mary Jones (the Alumni Secretary, who is responsible
for the registration operations). The Soil editor offered to share
his table with The Paper. Permission to do this was denied by
Miss Jones.
The content of The Paper was the next objective. It is obvious—
ly not lit for human consumption, according to the administration
people involved. Mrsi Hawk was reported to the 5&8 as having
said: “I haven’t read it, but I’ve heard about it.” Mr. less (pull
llcity director) said that he’d seen the first issue. The big thing
on Mr. less’ mind was the cartoon on the last page.
And, explained Mn less and Mr. prison (development director), when Miss Jones referred the 5&3 editor to them for a final
decision, the college has no control over the editor of The Paper.
Let us consider parallel situations ll the editor of the 5&3
displeases the college sufficiently, he can be lived by the Committee on Student Publications and lose his salary. The present editor
could take the monetary loss easily If, however, the editor of The
Paper displeases the college sufficiently, the only resource is to
throw him out of school This means a one-way ticket to one of
ﬁcneral Hershey’s “summer schools.”
It seems, then, that the 5&3 editor actually has less at stake
than the editor of The Paper, and thus the college has less control
over him.
There is also the abstracts of this decision regarding freedom
of expression being made by the Alumni Secretary, and ultimately,
the directors of publicity and development. That such a decision
was not affected by the means of the college, or by the faculty, is
my amazing.
But the decision has been made.
The 5&1! pages all visitors to the campus who consider themselves friends of Grinnell to find a copy of The Paper and read it.
You may not like it. You may not even be impressed But a
group of students have taken the time to organize and publish
their ideas, and as people interested in the college, you should
lead it as soon as you would read the 5&3.
If you don’t find a representative of The Paper walking on
campus, drop down to the Sim office in the north end of the Forum movements We‘ll have some copies for you,
TOWN AND COLLEGE
The administration, started by complaints from students, is at
last beginning to take steps to cure anti-college and anti-metro activities in town.
President suggest and Dean centers are planning to meet
with the local church council and with “Frosty” Mitchell (KGRN)
Ind Al Finder (Herald-Register) to discuss the problem
The S“? wishes to thank the administration for its efforts, but
feels they are in main, Racial and social preceding have shown
themselves time and again to be too deeply introduced to be
reached by the pulpit or by mass media. Such efforts often serve
to further antagonize the automobiles.
The only way to meet the problem of college student —townie
relations is head on — with a direct configuration between the two
groups.
The configuration may take two fonnsl It may be violent, with
such side integrating for alleged results received Or it may be
peaceful, with people from both sides meeting to try to understand
each other and work out a solution
Peace through understanding is difficult, if not impossible,
when dealing with large groups of people. But with a small college
and a small town, it may work. And it must.
The 5&3 would like to see a commission composed of college
students and young townspeople, with college administrators and
parents as disorders (not supervisors), established to examine the
problem and propose solutions.
The young people on each side are the one: who stand to gain
or lose, and their direct involvement is the only way to resolution.
NOTES FROM THE
GIRGULAR FILE
The sun would like to apologize for an error in last week's
paper. hunting the anti-war petition, we referred to the war as
"removal and a topless destruction of human lives.“ It should
have been “removal in its topless destruction of human lives.” \
The distinction is subtle, but important. If the story had remained on Campus, we might have overlooked it.
But the information Service, without consulting the editor of
the 58:3, Neil kitchen (the author of the story), 01‘ Ron Miller
:(GSM member who was interpreted), turned the story into a news
release and sent it to the four corners of the earth.
if we’re writing for siicll a large audience, we’d like to get paid
for it Or at least get a credit. And we’ll get; very careful on our
quotes.

Miss hormone, my third

Arthur, my six year old brother, caught at me and picks me
when i come home from school
because I never receive even
the southwest acknowledgment.
But understand, I don’t care, I
don't care.
What are all these things
next to that quintescenco of
awards -— that necklace of
precious metal and solid wisdom. I am primarily aware that
in my own scholarship, l have
stood at the head of my guild
during these past few years at
Grinnell. So it has been an annual pain to me to see Grinnell
center on aggregate of awards
and scholarships upon persons
of small and temporary consequence — persons of local and
adolescent notoriety, persons
who draft into obscurity and are
forgotten inside of ten years —
and never a metallica offered
to me!
What is mere to work for —
may, to live for if not the Pres‘
event’s metallica? And yet, I
would have as unflinchingly
taken the matching earrings
and bracelet as I anticipated
the metallica.
So as not to be dealt that last
blow of invisible disappointment
when it would be given away
to some charlotte, some bonus
student, 1 preferred it myself]
Arthur won’t laugh at me
anymore. Miss hormone will
really be sorry. And after I

MAKE MORE THAN LOVE
By PAUL JONES
One of the many results at my previous columns in the 5&3,
especially those concerning creativity, is that I have noticed that
very few people have any sense of the term ‘creativity’ as any
kind of broad or Inclusive concept. Most of the criticism or com«
ment that 1 nova received has been to the select that "Creativity
is something that just can’t go on all or the time, since it either
takes a special type of person to be creative, or a special talent."
It may be so that it takes both special people and special talent,
biit this does not mean that an attitude of creativity cannon be de-
related by everybody on this campus, or that one has to be born
creative to be so.
The fact is that creativity can exist in every kind oi activity
which a person undertaken, from writing poetry to developing relationships with people. As the title or one or my previous columns
stated, “Man is a creative animal.” To be human is to be creative.
to develop a creative attitude toward everything you do. For those
who are willing to take on the burden or being human, or being
conscious at every moment of being conscious, or living actively
and opened, or living with people, not between or among them, or
taking every relationship as an inside activity rather than an outside activity, admittedly, life is not easy, or as certain as it might
be otherwise. But a person is not born as a human being, but
rather as a potential human being; You have to struggle, make
choices, suffer stories of containers, to finally gain a soul. not in
the religious or critical sense necessarily, but in the sense or a
hard and deeply-posted know oi commission. an understanding oi
what it is to be human, a desire to feel as much as you know
unfortunately. most people live treasurer by their surroundings around here, and it not, then in a situation oi animal requirements which allow no time for making choices, At a school like
this people don't really think that they have to struggle; not that
everything is merely given to them, or course, but they sort of live
in a ﬁlm or shadow, never quite receiving, or trying to realize,
what they are doing: not what they will do, but what they are doing.
The ease with which certain individuals {ind categories for
other people and the narrowness of the scales of Values on which
many people, events, relationships, are judges, are only indian«
tions of the but into which so many people fall: that of not viewing
every person as different, as a potential relationship of creative
Value. Perhaps the title at this column should have been: ”Make
more With love, not just love itself.”

the Report.
It would not be in error to
state that the Committee, soon
after it began its work, formed
the judgment that the educational program of the College
was not in any fundamental
sense beautifully operated or out
oi joint; that. in general, std-
ﬂends were being educated at
the College and that in many
cases students were being educated rather well.
On the other hand, the Committee judges there to be a
number of serious problems can-

I new curriculum from scratch.
This decision was reinforced
by the constant remainder that
the portion of the operating budget devoted to educational purposes inevitably conflicts with
other expenditures, both capital
and current, in the process of
designing priorities. The Committee also came to understand
the hard reality that the century of history and tradition of
this institution create major in-

This year the following rules
are strongly emphasized.
1. Dress shirts are correct at-

i MEMORANDUM
To: The Faculty and administrative Officers
From: Jim prison
It has come to my attention
Iﬂday that a notice has been
distributed to the faculty (unsigned) indicating what faculty
should or shouldn’t wear during
the coming weekend.
So far as we can tell, this
notice originally with three intake students. it did not come
horn this oiilce or any other
administrative office. I present
that this is part of the “game"
some students an now playing.
Committee Report, while re
commercial major overhauia
in some areas and the develop
ment oi new programs in other
areas, only pushed at the marking and suggests minor adjust.
series in a number of areas. in
this sense, the Report recognized that really new currently
are developed only at really
new institutions.
While it would be difficult to
isolate the most important
changes recommended in the
Report (for, indeed, many of
them are entertaining). it is
possible to make a number of
congratulations which will capture the style of education and
faculty and student academic life
which are implied by the curriculum recommendations. I will
do this by listing a number or
corporations which taken in foto
characterize the new directions
implied by the complex at soma
little recommendations:
Proposition 1. There is need
for a new and more straightforward system by which the faculty will administer the educational programs of the College
to encourage instrumentation
in educational policy and provide for its regular review; to
place responsibility for the operation and supervision of the
understand General Education
programs on the three di signs
of the College through their educational Policy Committees; to
encourage additional concern
for programs which heretoiore
have been considered strictly
departmental; to ensure the de
equipment of uniform standards
and practices oi Comprehensive
Examinations and independent
Study.
Proposition 2. The College, and
especially the staff, should renew, update, and increase its
commitment to the general education of its students. This new
commitment should be reflected in a representation of
general education requirements
centered about the additional
structure of the College, a new
effort to ensure that the courses
included in the general education program are designed for
the general student and not the
prospective specialist, is conscious effort by the administration to base both hiring and
other personnel decisions on the
need to establish excellence in
these programs, and an extension or general education into
the upperclass years.
Proposition 3. The changing
abilities and master of those
students attending the College
necessarily the provision of increased opportunities for inde<
pendant library. laboratory, or
studio work, for oil-compare
study, for indexed study of a
single subject matter during
any particular semester. and
for the interdisciplinary study
of subject matters of contemporary relevance.
Basic to this proposition is
the judgment that students, as
they progress through the College, should assume increasing
responsibility for their own
education.
Proposition 4. To compete with
other institutions of higher
learning in the maintenance of
a highly competent staff. the
College must provide an im<
placement in working conditions for the Faculty, Modiﬁnation in the course load is es‘
central if the Faculty is to effectively carry out its growing
non-instructional responsibilities
both to the College and to the
respective productions.
Proposition 5. The College has
been and is controlled with a
growing departmental and dies
ciplinary orientation of both its
faculty and its students. This ll
reﬂenter in both the departmental currently and the course
programs. it the College is to
remain true to its liberal trade
tion this shirt in emphasis
should be regarded if not re
jersey.
Proposition 8. The curriculum
or the College currently contains too many courses. Now ll
the appropriate time for the
Faculty to re-study the report-
mental course offerings with
the goal of streamlining the
program of study in each discip
plane.
Proposition 7. The C oil e g a
should constitutes institutional—
ice a style of supervisor experts
migration and innovation in
subject matter offerings. tech
niques of pedagogy, and programs of study both on- and
oiicampus.

NEW ELECTRON MICROSCOPE HERE
By SUSAN EDWARDS
Grinnell has spent an estimated $8,000 for a used piece
or equipment which has to be
stopped each time the train
passes.
An electron microphone, to be
used by the science report»
meets, was installed September
25, and is in use now.
Dr. Guillermo vendors and
Dr. dildo Walker are the two
biology processors working with
the “highly-sensitive, likely calculated instrument" which, ac:
working to Walker, is easily
thrown off by operations.
Walker just completed a year
of research and work with
electron microscopes at the
University of British Columbia,
Canada. Although the microphone was purchased from Harvard University in August, 1966,
involvement was contained until
Walker returned since he is the
only person who knows how to
else it.
Grinnell’s microphone was
purchased for less than half of
its original price of $36,000.
The price of the newest model.
according to Walker, is around
$45,000.
Workmen have been busy
since this July preparing three
rooms in the basement of the
science building. Besides the
room for the microphone itself.
there is a special preparation
room and a bathroom.
A light microphone uses visible rays to reflect through the
section and certification lenses
to “increase" the size for the
viewer. Maximum certification then is limited by the wave
length of the light and rarely
extends LOOOX.
Up to 500.000X is possible
with the electron microphone.
Larger resulting power. the
ability to western two close
points clearly, is only possible
with shorter wave lenders, such
as electron teams.
The direction of the beam Ii
regulated by electromagnetic
lenses as controlled with the
objective lenses of the light
microphone.
Walker noted, "The electron:
pass through a section and art
partially blocked by the varying sensitive of the section. Consequently, chicken parts appear
lighter on the screen. The dark.
and light areas are reserved,
though, alter a photograph is
taken."
An advantage of the electron
microphone, noted Walker, "is
the ability to work in areas
other than biology, such as with
crystal, metal. or ceramic
structures."
“The involved preparation and
cutting are disadvantages. A
special instrument and light
microphone are necessary to
cut and ended the section in
hard plastics. Decompos‘on
presents house of the section."
Students and faculty mere
bars will be using the micro.
scope for independent work and
research.
“It’s here as a teaching research tool for anyone especially interested in catalogs. Hopefully the research will be pub.
lishable." added Walker.
"Dr. vendors and I are hoping to receive a National Science Foundation Grant for a‘
program next summer. A few
interested students would 114
drive $60 a week and credit
for their research."
“If the grant does not alternative, students may still
work for credit,” Walker com
eluded.
“We will work with any interested students and faculty
members in learning the fundamentals of the instrument. Grinnell, though, is too small a
school to be able to afford a
course in electron microphone,"
he said.
 
LAB NOTES
By DARCY KELLEY,
Science processors and science motors seem to spend an coordinate amount of time in the laboratory. Too many students, struggling through the more of the science requirement is bad enough.
Spending any more time than necessary in the laboratory seems a
sure sign of recipient humanity.
Behind the doors of the science building, in the matters or
Goodenow, something is going on. Grant proposals are written. research papers are submitted and independence are illustrated
upon the unwary department,
selecting, for the moment, the humanity hypothesis for sciens
lists, we can seek other inspiration for these laboratory citizens.
elections can excuse. compounds can copper, fisher can candidate
and even rats have something to “say" if approaches in the right
fashion.
Grinnell theaters much faculty and student research. What is
happening and why? Answering these questions will be the object
of Lab Notes.

The greatest of all jazz consists, Louis Armstrong and his
All Stars bring the best in show
business to this year's home
coming dance. Beginning at
9:30 pm. Saturday in party
symposium, Armstrong will
play dance music and a short
concert in the middle of the eve
king.
Playing with Armstrong are
three Glenn, trombone and
~video; Joe Nuranal, clarindti]
Arvell Shaw. bass; Danny Barcelona, films; Many Napolean,
piano; and Jewel Brown, a new
guest vocalist.
The following. taken from
The New Edition of The Erlcyclopedla of Jan by Leonard
weather, best expressed the personal life history of Louis Armstrong.
Born in New Orleans on July
4, 1900, Louis‘ singing career
began several years before he
started to play. When he was
about seven, he and a group of
friends would sing in the streets
for panties and tickets; he details that he always enjoyed
singing, for pleasure and for
money, Then on the night of
December 31, 1913, he integrated
by running out in the street and
ﬁring a gun he had followed
from his mother without her
knowledge. Arrested and sent
to the fails' Home in New
Orleans. he was given a comes
to play in the institution‘s band
and soon was playing physics
and parties, studying his horn
with Peter Davis of the basis‘
Home,
Alter his release from the
home he worked in a variety
of jobs and was referenced by
Joe (King) Oliver, who was his
sole musical influence and mentor. Later, when Oliver was
leading his own band in chicago, he sent for Louis to join
him as second cosmetics, in July
1922. By this time Louis had
had considerable experience in
Oliver's previous job as a member or the Kid 0ry band.
It was in Chicago that Armstrong, who had been married
briefly in New Orleans to Daisy
Parker, met julian garden, ali-
.ver's spanish, who became the
second Mrs. Armstrong. Louis,
then working with julian in julie
Powers' broadband band, left
to join the Fletcher Henderson
band in New York. After an extensive road tour with the hand
through the spring and summer
of 1925, Louis left to return to
Chicago and to broadband,
where Lil now had her own
band.
Early in 1926 Louis joined the
"synthetic jazz" orchestra of
Erskine date at the welcome
Theatre. A few months later he
began gambling in Carroll Dickersun's orchestra at the Sunset
cabinet. where he was filled
as “Louis Armstrong, World‘s
Greatest Trumpet Player." The
proprietor of the Sunset was
Joe player, who for almost all
of the past 30 years has been
Armstrong’s manager.
It was during this period that
he began to make records
under his own (Louis armstrong's Hot give or Hot Seven);
his first tune he‘recorded as a
By KATHY SHEA
leader was “My Heart.” From
then until December, 1928 a series of classic sides was recorded, most of the later ones
prominently featuring Earl
lines, the spanish with whom he
had worked in jefferson‘s hand.
These were the records that
earned Armstrong a world-wide
reputation. By 1929, when he returned to New York, he was
the idol not only of the metro
public that had known him for
several years but also of white
musicians and fans at home
and abroad. His technical ascii<
ltd Was exceptional; his limited
reading ability had improved.
Most important, the emotional
intensity and basic simplified at
his sales, especially when he
played the blues, had no party<

Back in New York, Louis

Connie's Inn in harley and

kerry Smith's band in the venue “Hot Chocolates" at the
Hudson Theatre on Broadway.
It was in this Show that he
introduced “win’t Mishehavin’,“
his first popular-song hit perromance.
This was the digital point in
Armstrong’s career. From this
time on he printed a big band,
and used popular songs rather
than blues or original insert<
rentals for his material. Most
of the large orchestras Louis
printed from this time until 1946
tell for short of his own musical standards.

this visit that the editor of the
London “Melody Maker,” un<

earlier nickname, "watches

ln 1936 Armstrong went to
Hollywood to take part in the
film replies from Heaven with
king Crosby. During the next
few years, his transition from
the status of musicians' idol to
that of personalityrentertainer
saw many changes in the matter and manner of his prefer

increasingly dominant role. The
greater his impact on the public, the less important were his
musical settings and the less
durable his musical contributions.
One of his rare opportunities
to appear before the public with

The mounting interest in armstrong as a symbol of American jazz led to more frequent
experiences abroad.
Armstrong during the 19503
enhanced his reputation in the
popular music held through re«
holdings with corporate orchestral settings including large
string sections, under the db
, section of Gordon banking, Russ
Garcia, and others.
Through the years, Armstrong
has had major comedy parts
in various ﬁlos. A film and
record communication some of
his travels, entitled watches
the Great were released in 1957.
Louis has appeared at Newport and most of the other major jazz festivals. He has won
”Down Beat" and "Melody
Maker” polls among others.
It is difficult, admittedly, to
see in correct perspective Armstrong's contribution as the first
vital jazz tourist to attack world
wide influence as trumpeter,
s i n ge r, enterprises, dynamic
show business personality and
strong force in stimulating intel'est in jazz. His style, melodicaliy and periodically Sim<
pre by the standards of later
jazz trends, achieved in his
early records an unprecedented
warmth and beauty. His singing, packing most of the tray
national vocal qualities accepted
outside the jazz world, had A
rhythmic intensity and cultural
charm that induced literally
thousands of other locations to
private him, just as countries
trumpeters through the years
reflected the impact of his
style. By 1960 Armstrong, set
in his ways, improvised compatibility little; but he retained
locally and instrumentally many
of the qualities that had essay«
listed him, even though entertainment values, by his own admission, meant more to him
than the reactions of a minority of musicians and specialists.
The best recording demonstration his early years can be
found in the four-volume “Louis
Armstrong Story" on Columbia
available in nursing Library.
Leonard weather's Encyclope<

During the 19905 Louis Armstrong became more than ever
a symbol of the basic beauty,
simplified, and international appeal of traditional American
jazz. In 1960 he Visited Africa,
in two separate tours, one sponsored by a soft drink company.
the other by the U, S. State
Department. In 1961 through
1965, he toured Europe, Asia,
and Australia. During his 1965
tour throughout Eastern and

Stadium.
After several years at cards

CRAZY MAN
(Editor's Note: The following story was sent to the 5&3
by 1967 graduate Steve shelter, who text that “Grinnell
shouldn’t have to wait for the
Des points Register.”)
By STEPHEN R. SHENDER
Let me tell you about ML
Allard Lowensteln. There are
probably any number of sell—
styles, hard - noted political
pragmatists who would be
quick to label Al Lowenstein a
crazy man. Mr. Lowenstein is
the chairman at a group called
the Concerned Democrats who
are currently in the process of
creating a national organize
tion to deny london B. John
son the Democratic presidential
nomination In Chicago next
summary They have no money
and no candidate, but. nonetheless they believe that they can
couple an incorrect president
who has at. his disposal all of
the resources of his ofﬁce as
well as control over the national party organization. This is a
clear-cut case of humanity if
there ever was one.
Allard Lowerlstein made a
brief appearance here in the
citizen of American academic
to explain himself the other
night. "The worst thing we can
do right now,” Mr. Lowenstein
exports, “is to do nothing. If we
let ourselves be overcome by
despite and titanium at the
very outlet, then of course
there is no hope.
“Sure, we’re broke and leadership right now,” Lowenstein
cheerily adults, “but on the
other hand, look what happened
in ’52 and ’56. We had lots of
money, a powerful organization,
a great leader, a good cause,
and we lost. The mood of the
country was against us both
times, but the reverse is true
today Anybody who can read
a poll can see that public statement is going against Johnson — and that’s without any
visible altematlver The [act is
that there are a helluva lot of
regular party members who
would like to see somebody else
nominated in 1968, but who at
the present time are so documented and feel so isolated that
they see no chance in open opposition. Sure. they’re not all
against 1 oh n s o n because
they’re intellectually opposed to
the war, but they do feel in
their bones that LEJ is going
to have the same impact on the
local tickets in 1968 that polyester did In 1964, and they don’t
want that. These people have to
be monitored; they have to be
put in touch with others who
think similarly; somebody has
to show them that they area't
as much alone as they think.
We Can do it, and if we do
that, we Can heat Johnscnt"
Lowenstein causes while the
room watches its collective
breath. Any minute the Harvard police are surely going to
come breaking through the
door with a straight-jacket.
The crazy-man gains and con.
linked. “D.K., so we don't have
a candidate yetl Well, there
was only one man around in
1952, and look how things opened up when he heat the incorrect in New Hampshire. The
point is that you can’t automatically expect the established
figures in the party to declare
themselves opened against the
party-leader and incorrect
president at this stage oi the
game. in direct, they’re all
from Missouri; they have to be
shown. Show them that Johnson
can be detected in a couple of
early primarily, capture some
state convention generates for
a peace ticket, in short, show
them that Johnson is a lower
and that his policies are un—
popular with the rank and file,
and believe me, by May there
will be no search of candidates
seeking the job
“But let’s get this straight.
We area’t going to accomplish
anything by hearing our hair,
reading our clothes, and rolling
in the dirt If we give up now,
trying, ‘we’ll take anybody but
SCARLET AND BLACK
Johnson — even a republicans’
we’re liable to get anybody —including simon or Reagan.
That is hardly an improvement.
As I have indicated. the situation inn't as homeless as it
seems. It will take a great deal
of time and ellorL and organization at the local levels, but
I think it Will pay off. And one
more thing. What we’re pro
posing to do here really transcript the war and the personality or the president. We
are engaging in a certification
of the liability of the electoral
process. If we succeed, then
we may also succeed in done
finding those who have often
ollt of the system in despite to
come back into the fold; we’ll
actually be promoting the fragrance stability and liability of
our society. If we tail, well,
things really can’t get much
worse.”
"thus safety Allard Lowenstein. unfortunately for the
poor man, his decisions don’t
stop at the eastern keyboard.
His madness has led him proseletyzing all over the country,
and the really crazy thing about
It is that. he keeps finding more
poor souls reflected of the same
madness — people like the local cnmmitteemen in Michigan
and Wisconsin who are now organizing to beat Johnson in
their state primarily or state ~
delegation conventions, people
like the local party activists in
West Virginia or the “ﬂowerhatted” nations at the yahoo«
la County (Montana) Democratic picnic, people like the crazy
men out in Caliiomia who call

“several” Democrats in Iowa
who would like to see the rental turned out. These people
area’t wide-eyed collective licenses or pot-happy nipple radi—
call, These people are good,
solid, churchgoing, moderate,
middle-class Democrats. Bring
them out of riding, says Lowenstein; give them a focal point
for their opposition; make them
believe the impossible can be
done, and by God, they’ll do it.
Crazy, man.

lecture classes, as requirements,
are most inappropriate to the
image of a small college whose
most valuable asset is the opportunity it provides for small
classes and seminars that allow
for meaningful discussions with
processors well quiltﬁed in that
area,
The Report allocated that
lectures . i should take advantage of the special quad"
nations of the individual [equity member (pr 42)." Our question is, why not have all courses
take advantage of the faculty's
qualifications? These broad survey courses are not only in-
ﬂenable and impersonal to the
students, but they are a gross
minute of valuable facility resources. Would it not be ad
vantageous to the entire college
community to replace the existing understand requirements with
a general requirement oi at

and allow the individual student

This would (1) allow the students to satisfy their own interests as best. below their individual backgrounds and educational goals, (2) fulfill the objectives of a flexible, liberal,
and personal education, and
(3) permit the i'adults to teach
courses, ii not in their immediate fields, at least in their
own departments and the
courses for which they are most
currently qualified.
It is also most regrettable that
the Committee did not consider
any fundamentally new concepts in education important

along these lines. Their object

The Committee's concern for
the teaching load oi the faculty
is certainly a valid concern, but
Grinnell can not afford to saw
office the ideals of a modem
liberal education by maintaining
large lecture classes and
disregarding new educational
ideas.
We see no other way that
Grinnell College can claim to
be a progressive liberal arts
institution. Certainly proceeding

When South say the jimmy
of his four Heart contract he
could count five lovers: one
space, two diamonds and two
clubs. He could throw one of
them on a space honor but he
would still have four lovers for
down one. His only chance
would be to force a december to
give him a stuff and a ruff, so
he chose “the play to make,"
and assumed that he would get
a “best of all possible worlds"
distribution in clubs and hearts.
The opening space Jack was
covered by jimmy's Queen
which was taken by the Ace.
The Queen of diamonds was re-

turned and allowed to hold. West continued with the Jack of diamonds and South put up the Ace. declared then entered the board
with the heart Jack and played the space King shipping the
remaining diamond from his hand. jimmy'l last space was then
buffer in hand and the board recovered with the heart King. jimmy’s last diamond was then buffer in hand and South was ready
to execute the display.
drums had been pulled and both the North and South hands
were void of spaces and diamonds. If South could reduce one of
the dependent to lead a space or a diamond he could get ii ruff
and a stuff. declared laid down the Ace of clubs and if West had
followed with the dance, the contract would have made, but by this
time West had counted down South's hand. .
West knew that South had two other clubs and that the Queen
was probably not one of them since declared would have preferred
the finance over the display. West's only alternative was to dump
the King of Clubs under the Ace and hope that his partner had the
Queen and Jack. When South led the second round of Clubs he was
down.
South could have made the contract if he had played the club
Ace early. At the fourth trick, even the best december would be re<
instant to part with the club King to prevent a possible display.
Furthermore, at the fourth trick West could not have counted down
South’s distribution.
