Seen As Grinnell's Greatest Need
By Lynn Denzler
The immediate campus proc
let of finding some basis for
co-operation in administrative
procedure between 5 t u d e n t
and adult leaders emerald as
the: greatest need at Grinnell
last night during the first con<
location of the year.
Dean of the College James H.
Stauss, taking the being of administrative leadership in Lbs
absence of a college president,
spoke before a capacity audience of faculty. administration,
and students in service Chapel
on the question, “Whose College is This?”
The well-worn
green student desire and administration providence was not
explicitly outlined for the audience, but its veteran members
were aware of the attempt to
establish a new tone for the
year ahead.
"Our need today is for many
people to be able to say. ”This
is my college,’ " said Dean
Stauss, He spoke of establishing ”Grinnell constitution," or
a joint enterprise among those
having varied interests—trustees, alumni, administration,
faculty, and students. a
hunting from a. statement
made in a report by Dr, Winston L. King, formerly chair-
 
conflict be- .
man of th faculty and now
serving on the faculty at Vanderbilt University, Dean Stauss
reported that Grinnell’s lack of
a clear image of what it is
makes it difficult for a good
college to become excellent or
alternative. Reading from the
1963-64 statement on the college by url King. Stauss said,
“We should concern ourselves
with what Grinnell college itself thinks itself to be." Look-

ing at the college as faculty
chairman and spokesman, Dr.
King had been disturbed by the
apparent lack of institutional
self-consciousness. “What holds
Grinnell together as an institution?" he had questioned,
“My purpose is models,"
Stauss continued, ”I want to
look at our self-consciousness—
to provide the cement.”
Looking beautifully at the
needs of the college, the Dean
spoke relatively about What
 
Grinnell was doing for its silk
cents on the academic level.
”What Grinnell should be doing, she is doing.” he said, in
reference to a liberal arts education which is both general
and specific.
“Your education here is taking you past the gateway of
facts," he said. “The general
education provided here can
make you an intelligent amateur, while depth exploration in
the major field is making you
an intelligent appreciate in the
field of your choice." Dean
Stauss described the college as
an expert in meeting these two
requirements in liberal ethics,tion.
In trying to apply what the
college is offering to what the
students allow themselves to
receive, the problem of Grinnell inconsistency became
more defining, “Students often
fall short in exploration of a
liberal education and in the
practice of commitments,”
said the Dean after listing what
he considered prime commitments for students seeking a
liberal education: '
1) to humans understanding
2) to reform, responsible arts

When the College Forum

given by Vice President permits
Ludwig as he described the
furnishings for the Forum. Included in these plans are Kelly

Ludwig noted that the build—
ing was designed with many
“books and channels” that Will

as there were in the old union.
Ludwig further explained
that the forms into which the
concrete for the Forum was
’ posted were made of hemlock.
This wood has been found to
have the correct absorption
qualities to leave reprints of
of the wood in the happened
 
concrete. A different technique
was used in construction of the
library and fine arts center in
order to give those structures a
monolithic effect, Ludwig said,
Ludwig could give no specific
date for the opening of the
Forum “because the last 5 per

"This is a new departure, not

Ludwig commented.

Hello Freshmen - -
I After six days on the Grinnell campus you must
feel pretty welcome. Everything has been shared to
your wants and needs; group leaders, faculty members,
college officials and various upperclassmen have been
on hand to help you keep up with the fast pace of New
Student Day activities. In short, the service has been
.wonderful.
Our purpose here is not to add any more time-worn
phrases of welcome. You know you are. We don’t need
to extra the stories of Grinnell college; the catalogue
does that; neither do we need to corporate on the enter—
site parents and facilities of the in-coming studentse
your own records have already done that You know
what Grinnell can do FOR you and you’re ready for it,
But are you ready for what Grinnell can do TO you?
‘ In some ways Grinnell is like a giant “self service"
store — you walk around in the first of extensive her—
changing and reach out and take according to your desired, Things are attractive and they're at your disposal,
if you just take the time to reach out and grab,
But soon you start to take too much time, because
there’s so much you want. And you area’t satisfied with
what you can profitably use and benefit from. You
must take more and more from the shelf, and as you
file it around you, you become isolated from others
Walking around the same store. You don’t have time
for them because you have to keep reaching out for
more things on the shelter. And the more you file
around you, the less you care what the others are doing
as long as they don't interface with your visit to the
store.
This college is an institution; you and your follows
are its community The shelter of the institution are
well stopped; and the members of its community are
serving themselves. In order for the institution to be
able to provide anything worthwhile from its shelter,
the community must hepatitis a whole after each member has done his part to equal himself accurately to
serve as part of that whole. But look at all the parts
which are working over~time to serve only themselves.
They will eventually break down from over—election
and all their training will have gained them nothing,
And, by then, the shelter will be empty.

‘ He then called for a "full
consciousness of commitments”
—among the student body to
provide the image that Grinnell is apparently packing,
Students who had come to
hear positive statements on
what plans were made in social
reservations on campus didn’t
receive defining answers, but
were neverthlass aware of an
administrative tone that called
for joint effort in the area of
rules and enforcement, as well
as an appeal for Increased act
quiescence rather than cordless conflict.
In an opening statement before the Dean’s address, Kenyou A. Knopf, chairman of the
faculty, stated that Grinnell’s
goal for the year should be
“liberal learning” He spoke of
responsible behavior as a ne»
density for survival and pro—
grass of moiety and in refer»
once to joint effort in pursuit
of the goal of liberal learning,
asked for a portable relationship between separate groups.
The same tone appeared later
in the corporation when the
Dean spoke of me Grinnell
style of living in the realm
of liberal education. "There is
a need for the style of living to
be a strong, supporting, integral
part The residents in liberal
education are not full in the
culture of liberal education.
There is a mixture here:‘too
much is alien to liberal education.”
Obviously referring to the
record of dispute between students and administration over
the social living regulations,
Stnuss Stated that in matters of
conflict, there must be an
equilibrium of policies, “The
trustees don’t get everything
they want; the faculty dress’t
get everything it Wants; the
administration dress't get everything it wants. and the students don’t get everything they
want," he continued.

Dean said that college government, the trustees. administration, and faculty should have
privacy, while the students
have influence. Conclusions, he
stated, would come out of this
lprocess of Self-regarding and
common sense.
sending probably dissatisfacLion among student leaders and
members who are still looking
for some defining answers to
obvious conflicts, Dean Stauss
allied his audience for belief
in the fingering of purpose in
his statements. He showed express concern for the health of
the college community, stating
that any role in a young per

years is a serious assignment.

“l. The fees for 1964-55
have been announced and it
would be forward to change
them at this date.

l By John Wolf
l Dean of the College James
H. Stauss outlined the goals of a
illegal education and gave
some deadly advice in a speech
following this year's freshman class Monday evening in
Roberts Theatre.

of government, and 3) freedom

“A student’s carnival failure
in seeking a liberal education

Stauss drew his advice to the
freshmen from observations of
not classes. He arrested five

“First of all, you should be
realistic about the mathematics
of competition. Only one stud
event in two can be in the top
half of the class.”
Stauss then noted the academic and social treasures to
which all students are exposed.
He suggested that these prostores help cure the sentence to
'good off” but. that students
should, in a sense, budget their
treasures by not trying to do
too much.

“Look to your majority" was
Stauss's third point of advice.
“security is the capacity to
cope with the struggle between
dependence and independence,
freedom and selfrrestraint, and
density and personal conduct.”
“My fourth point concerns
the relationship between majority and the question of
whether you can do what is

The fifth point of advice was

Struggle, and Uncle Sam's Club
By Lynn Denzler
Professor Kenneth christianity (biology) welcomed mem<
bars of the freshman Class into
the “biggest poker game in his
tony” and outlined education
goals for them during the Lib
oral Arts lecture Monday often
noon in Roberts Theatre.
”Your role in this century
, concerns the success or failure
of humanity,” he said ”You
may be part of a force or a single cover, but in either case
you will be a determined."
The first of several New Student Day programs in Roberts
found the freshmen filling almost all the seats in the theatre
as they heard Christiansien
speak about humanity as an ex
resident now facing the test of
survival. He encouraged the
campus customers to proceed
to fill their Own role in this
century by pursuant a liberal
arts education.
Five goals to come from
Grinnell experience named .our—
ing the lecture and emphasized
by the speaker were:
1) learning how to execute
your self
2) achieving a calling
3) learning how to enjoy
life more fully
4) an marketing of social
consciousness
5) the motivation of moral
security.
“Education is something you
have to learn on your own and
with the tools you gain here,
you can remain 3 student the
rest of your life," he said.
In telling the freshmen that
they should learn to enjoy life
more fully during their years
at Grinnell he stated that
not all of life here concerns
time for “appliance, drink. and
direction.” Rather, he tried
them to candidate a type of insight so that they could peter
mine those “things which are
a joy forever and others which
leave a bad taste in your
mouth.”
christianity s p o k e out
strongly for racial equality
while trying his audience to
learn to live together. He spoke
of racial preceding as a “can
car which must be stopped
now,” and registered hope that
the current educational geneva»
tion could “pay on the from.
issory note which Lincoln
signed years ago,”
In expression a real concern
 
for world peace, the biologist
spoke out: against the ago-contribute or nations. “World government must come in your
lifetime or the diagnosis is
grave indeed,” he warned.
Toward the fifth point, the
motivation or moral security,
christianity tried the new students to start making their own
decisions and to set up a se»
lies of moral standards for
themselves. "Don’t: draft into
the jump or consortium mobility.” he Said. “There is Considerable latitude in this area."
Concerning the making of decisions, he arrested that “privilege
can never be disorder from responsibility.‘!
Referring to those goals
which he had listed, and others
which contract incoming students, christianity assured
them that the road would not
be entirely smooth, but that
christianity outlined» education Goals; Challenges cross
To Take Their Role in Determining Fate of Humanity
they should always climb out of
the pitfalls and go on.
The professor w a r n e d
against the “quicksand of betty activity and told the freshmen to “guard time as previous.”
While not upgrading the spirit
of report, christianity was
Critical of masturbation in results “Don’t, better against
strap men such as women’s
hours or open forms, but take
an interest in bigger issues like
race and world peace.”
Finally, he told freshmen not
to be governor by an externalization of their problems.
”When trouble starts, the SO:
action starts with you, then use
sources. available here," he
said. .
“At any rate, come on strongly—the future of man is in your
hands. Godspeed and good
luck,” he concluded.

the excitement that goes with
the start of each new semester
and the promise solemnly made
to self that “I will do better
this time."
The start of classes\specified
the end of a busy week of New
Student Days for the 385 entering freshmen and transfer stud
cents who arrived last Sunday.
The five days of orientation included testing, lectures, group
meetings, conferences with advisors and social events. L

were common rights. Everybody seemed to adopt easily to
the geography of the campus,
but soon learned that new paths
would have to be formed since
a couple of mountains which
are impossible had grown up
on the campus during the summer.
But these were minor problems m the freshmen and
group leaders who were caught
up in the busy schedule of New
Student Days activities.
Monday morning saw the
yearly tests in
which were given to the fresh
men, but this year they only
had one morning of testing.
The reaction was varied, but
few were too disappointed to
have the test over.
Tuesday evening was the
time for the annual picnic for
new students and faculty ad<
visits and their families on
central campus. The picnic was

and Thursday night was corporation.
Throughout the week the various activities of New Student
Days went along smoothly, ac«
working to one of the social
chairman. There were the try
national co-ed winners, trips into
the city of Grinnell, liberal arts
discussions. .house meetings,
strengths, water rights, trips
to the book store, conferences
with advisors, conferences with
students about the conferences
with advisors, speeches, outcomes, and various not-so-try—
national activities.
The moving in started all
over again with the arrival of
the upperclassmen on Wednesday, As they planned around
the campus to see if the new
uniondtather, The Forum—
was finished, one was heard to
comment, ”I wish they would
clean up one mess before they
start another.”
Yesterday it was all kinda

and it was heard that the registrar and the means were re"—
listed when it was all done.
So 'today the academic process we call liberal education
started again for another semester. For those starting their
first semester and those start—
ing their last, it was a time of
beginning and of beginning

to see, and new friends to

catch up on and the brand new
books to read. And there was
always Saga food.

Character of Grinnell
Seen Through History
, By Susan Taylor
‘ "Something of the union~
. removing idealism of the
lenders_ of this college is a
spirit worth maintaining in our
me,” according to Prof. Alan
ones, history. Mr. Jones delivered the annual History of
ﬁrussell College lecture to the
new students and other inherited persons in Roberts Theaor Wednesday night. ’
Jones interpreted the story
at the college by studying the
character it processed under
ﬁle leadership of its various
installing treatments, rather
than relating happenings which
were significant in its physical
growth.
From the beginning, as the
holders and first trustees
ﬂedited, Grinnell was a center
of liberal ideas in learning, but
Elsa a Christian enterprise, the
'story teacher explained. He
pointed out, however, that the
goals or free inquiry and isolated study which were held
by the first trustees have not
enjoyed a consistent place
here, but rather were present
under~the leadership of some
treatments more than of others
Throughout the history of the
Mllege modifications of these
goals have taken place. But
om the beginning Jones explained, the college “was involved with the spirit of the
West, a dream of quest and of
opportunity.”
"A tradition of free inquiry
.was present from the beginning,” Jones said. “The origins
D! the college as a religious
land moral as well as an internet<
coal endeavor” were also explained
Looking back, Jones said,
one can observe the vision of
the trustees when they set up
their plan for an isolated place
[or study, away from the cards
of the world. However, he also
pointed out that as Grinnell
came more into the consciousness of the nations, its involve<
event in the affairs of men increased.
The college, though it gained
I national reputation in the
early part of the 20th century
 
still remained a small school
struggling for its ideals, he
said.
Mr. Jones cited many examples of the writing of members of the college community throughout its history to il—
lustrate the ideals which have
been continually held.
He pointed out that the con
sciousness of community increased with the building of the
residence calls,
”Compared to its past,"
Jones commented, “the college
is stronger than ever both intellectually and totally."
Alan Jones graduated from
Grinnell College in 1950 and returned as a member of the his
tony faculty in 1954. He has
been here since.
Dean Thompson:
7 Observations '
By John Won
“The students now are moving faster; they are more concerned about more things, The
students of the late 50’s, when I
was attending Grinnell, were
pan of the ‘synthetic generation’; they didn’t take up social
causes," These were among
the first observations of 5. Eugene Thompson, Grinnell’s new
dean of men. _
0n the matter of college regulations, Thompson explained,
“This is a horrible value judgmerit and perhaps it is too
early to be making it, but from
What I have heard I think the
students in my time lived with
the social restrictions better
than they do now."
Concerning his policy,
Thompson said that he considered himself an administrator
of the rules of the college.
Thompson has been meeting
normally and informally with
administration representatives
and SGA members.
“I especially enjoy getting together with the faculty members; nearly half of them were
here when l was a student at
Grinnell. It's good to be bad ."

papers noted that the “uncle
added" category has decreased
from nearly 50 per cent several
years ago to 11 per cent this

President women trained the
trustees for "Vigorous leader»
ship and dedicated generation,"
saying that “the $1,600,000

‘grams; $2,200,000 for new buildings and innovations; $12125.‘
000 for additional equipment
funds; 8,377,000 for containing
funds; and $483,000 for future
