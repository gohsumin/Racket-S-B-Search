Stauss outlined Role of Student.
Parents in Liberal Education
By Cynthia trust
In the annual Parent’s Week—
end lecture, presented last Saturday in service Chapel, James
H, Stauss, Dean of the College
and acting president, explained
what the college expects of std<
cents, parents, and alumni.
Stauss began with a brief
summary of the goals of a liberal arts college. it is. he said,
created for “teaching. learning
and scholarship in the sciences
and arts,” as well as for pro»
professional training. He de«
scripts the ideal graduate as
an “intelligent amateur” in the
wide range of liberal arts subjects and an "intelligent “appreciate” in his major field.
”We expect our students to
do work which series the re—
spent of their processors,"
Stauss stated, He also declared
his desire to develop “hard—
joined reality” in the Students
and their parents in two areas

tions, is LodgeHatfield state
which often present great emotional problems. The first of
these is the “arithmetic of col—
legs competition,” the Welllmown fact that only one~half
the students can be in the upper 50% of their class.”
The second related area is
the ”emotional trap caused by
the distance between actual
possibility and unrealistic explanation,” on the part of either
the student or his parents. This
problem, according to Etauss.
is often involved in the conflict between dependence and
independence which plays such
a major role in a college students emotional life. We expect
the students to look toward
their majority,” he said. “We
want them to be hard-joined,
requests ~ to declare their independence of unrealistic expectations and relax.” Stauss
emphasized that he was not ad—
vi'sing students to ignore the
expectations of their parents,
but rather to not create an emotional issue of them.
The parents’ role in this development was outlined in three
areas: to allow the students to
adjust to reasonable expectations—“We ask you to 'accept
the standard of the students’
own best efforts"; to allow him
to discover and afford his own
interest; and to realize that he
ones it to himself to think for
himself.
Stauss pointed out that the
student must be left continually free to meet the commit
series of a liberal arts education. These are the commitments to a humans understanding of the world’s great
ideas and ideals, to informed
and responsible citizenship on
every level, and to sophisticated entertainment for himself and others.
He touched briefly on the
need for improvement in the
directory systems on campus.
We need, he said, to develop a
student culture which will support the liberal arts concepts.
The students must develop ma—
turkey and meet standards of
density and courtesy in their
relationships, In this area, he
pointed out that the administration and faculty expect understanding of these aims from
the parents and alumni. He
asked in conclusion that all who
care for the college and its students bear in mind that “rulemaking for students is not the

Polish dinner at a downtown
restaurant, and a jam session
with the xerox quarter.
“Grinnell is one of about six
American cities, and the only
college city, in which filling is
being done for this tour of the
Philharmonic," said Don Jones
(music). “A documentary

Jones also noted that this
marks the first time the Polish
government has connected to
a reproduced effort in recording an exchange concert. Pre-
 
oil'hyramb Uses French Theme:
'Discotheque' to Be Featured
,Grinnell follows an idea from
the French for the first dithyramb of the season to be held
following the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra concert tomorrow night in Loose Lounge.
The t h e m e Discotheque
means “records" in French. It
refers to a type of nightlife
that is found all over Europe
and is now becoming popular in
the United States, The surroundings are not extremely elegant.
and it is the type of place that
would be frequently by high
society. Entertainment music
is from records rather than a
band. It is one of the newest
developments in the small did»
new club atmosphere.
Committee chairman Martha
Montgomery said “We are trying to avoid the tea and sand-
with idea and get something
more substantial in planning
the menu.” Dithyramb is serving different sorts of chelsea,
bread, will tickets, and punch,
The idea behind dithyramb is
an attempt to provide a maximum of sophisticated entertainment to a small number of
people'after a formal event. It
usually includes a formal menu,
and some type of music, batteries after night club entertainment. A small admissiOn fee
is charged to control the number of people attending. Social
money is targeted for this, but
it does not cover all of the expense.
Tickets for somehow’s dithyrarnb are available in the Fine

”I think this shows that the
cultural exchange program can
get things done better than sit<

marked.
The Warsaw Philharmonic is
in this country as part of an
exchange in which the Pittsburgh Symphony went to P0land. Jones said, “The Pittsburgh orchestra was received
very hospitably in Poland; we
would like to see an equally
kind and generous treatment
for the Warsaw orchestra while
it is here.”
The orchestra‘s regular 90
members, under the direction
of Stanislaw Wisiocki, will play
Berloiz’s Roman Carnival creature and Beethoven’s Eroica

Resident advisors
‘- A program for residential advisors in calls on
North Campus is in the discussion stages with college
officials. .
\ In a statement made this Wednesday, Dean of the
College James H. Stauss admitted, “I have an interest
in the wide consideration of the possibility of ball advisors.”
Dean of Men S. Eugene Thompson also processed
an interest in such a program He arrested, however,
that the presence of David explain, an instructor in
mathmetics, in East and West morris calls this year
Is not in any way meant to signal an incident implementation of a resident advisor program.
“McBIain is an instructor in mathematics and nothing else. His residence in the morrison is due to the
availability of the suite left vacant when Mrs, June
Main became a housemother on South Campus,” said
Thompson
Although the program is only in the discussion
stages and although explain’s only official duty is to
teach mathematics, the vacant suite on morris seems
to have provided college officials with an opportunity
to study student reactions to faculty advisors
Explaining the extent of administration consideration of a resident program, Thompson said that he has
been talking with officials from colleges which have
such programs. “We know resident advisors work well
at other schools, The program is worth studying. There
is, however, nothing in the college’s budget for this
program, and there is no hiring going on. It has been
discussed with the CofHP and a couple calls.”
Thompson assured the campus that no resident advisor program will be institutes without consulting std«
cents.
As Thompson sees the advisors, “They would be
people with a standing in the academic community,”
They would include faculty, graduate students, and others with academic positions.
According to Thompson‘s argument, r e s i Cl e n ts
would provide an adult source of information and would
not be used for policies.
Grinnell now is one of the few colleges in the country with no resident advisor program in conjunction
with a hall system, A resident program was given'up at
Grinncll in 1953, partly because residents were not easy
to find. Thompson noted that while there was apparently no student animation for doing away with that pro
gray, there also was no great sense of loss.
Should Grinnell have to excuse a program dead
eleven years — a program that Thompson adults is
hard to staff? Is this program mainly an adult source
of information or an adult source of continued uncertainty?

In reCEnt weeks the role of
the Student Senate and SGA
has been questioned. They have
been customized for serving no
purpose. Despite the foundation
of its power by The Administra—
tion, student government can
remain as a functioning body —
a domestic peace corps, so to
speak;
Why should the school draft

and consequently input additional expense? Responsible

Homecoming floors have gathered the campus. Trees are

leaders could clean up the cam—

committee could extend its operations into other aspects of

to perform these tasks.
At first glance these pr0<
totals may sound a bit unrelan
ed to SGA'S normal duties. Yet
the future of student government is in doubt, its legislative
power has been removed. but
its service power remains. By
their actions student leaders
can set an example of “code
sciousness of social responsibility" and “service to their fees

These are but a few proposals
for student service. Student
government is an veterinary institution, but its future tests on

aaron accounts Year In Moscow
Final Impression less desirable
By Ann character
After spending eight months
in Moscow last year as part of
a US-USSR cultural exchange
program, h i s t o r y professor
Samuel H. aaron reports that
most Americans who live in the
USSR for several months have
less favorites expressions when
they leave than when they married.
in his informal address “An
American in Moscow,” last
Friday afternoon in Roberts
Theatre, aaron discussed the
favorites and unavailable aspects of Soviet life from the
basis of his personal experiences.
aaron noted the ever present
book reading, “You see people
reading everywhere— in surveys, restaurants, and parks."
Often they are studying technical books, classical novels and
selected modern works.
"For people of poor means
the opportunity to get higher
education is probably better
than here," he stated. At the
University of Moscow he knew
many students only two or three
generations removed from perform. .
aaron noted that general conditions have improved since
italic's death. “The people are
better dressed, there are no
forced labor camps, and wilderness are much order to travel within the country. One is a
good deal safer walking in the
streets of Moscow after dark
than in New York or Chicago," he said.
In suite of these improvements there remains a great
deal in Soviet life that is represent to anyone from our
world," he assisted. The Soviet
“humanities” philosophy of life
has created a system in which
“the man exists for the system
instead of the system for the
man." This results in the restriction of many personal freedoms.
aaron found that this lack
of personal freedom permitted
Soviet life even to the extent
of everyday conversation. “I
might be talking to a person
who was being fairly open.
Then someone else would ap<
breach us and the open conversation would suddenly stop.
It is widely believed that in
every classroom, every office,
and each department in a factory, there is a professional
spy." he said.
Freedom of knowledge is
greatly contained by the complete governmental control of
all communications No foreign
newspapers are available to the
public except for the Communist Party orgasm of other
countries Soviet citizens, including students, must have

closed. “The official picture

Communist countries and frequently do so in groups. For
the average man, however,
traveling to a western country
is “about as likely as a trip to
the moon,”
According to aaron, the Soviet system will change slowly
if at all. “If you ask an integer—

aaron said the resistance to
make sacrifices for the regime
and the desire for individual
gain may lead to a greater use
of the reward system, but he
was resistant to draw defining
conclusions as to where the
USSR is headed.

Another aspect of the LeMoyne-Grinneil exchange program can provide a regarding,
challenging sticker plus proc<
time teaching credit for a few
selected Grindellians next summer. Success of last summer's
"Humanities Seminar” points to
a similar program for the summer of l965. Seniors Kristi Williams and Dodi teacher were
last year’s participants.
The seminar at LeMoyne was
a part of a new program developed by graduate students at
image University. Students from
.Yale taught similar seminars
throughout the South, designed
to aid in everything the ”Cultural law” in the education of
Southern degrees. The mighty
Students at the LeMoyne seminar were chosen from the Ne»
ro high schools in Memphis.
. hey ranked from those entering their sophomore year to
those who had just graduated,
but the majority were between
their junior and senior years.
Three students from Yale
taught courses in history,
speech, and philosophy, added
by Miss soldier and Miss Williamsl The two girls from Grinneil, and one from Yale, lived
in a college-owned house near
the campus, which is in'the
heart of the metro district in
Memphis They were paid $200
plus room and board for the
live- week seminar from money
given for the program by var-
our foundations. They have al»
so received six Grinneil credits
for practice teaching, after submitting reports on their work
by the Yale students they worked under and also the LeMoyne
professor who set up the semi—
liar.
The courses were taught on a
college lreshman level. All std-
‘cents took each of the classes,
and met together for a fourth
hour assembly period. This
hour was usually devoted to
lectures or tours relevant to the
courses. All of the LeMoyne
campus facilities were available to the seminar particle

on campus the entire day. A

The content of all the classes
was designed to develop skill in

the ability to deal with abstract

the French Revolution through
the causes of World War I. Emphasis, was placed on ideas

focal point of the philosophy

ideas to modern problems was

speech course consolidated
specifically on the development
of communication skills. Critical reading, and the writing and
delivering of speeches were the
main activities.
“The kids were remarkable
motivated, interested, intelligent,” quick and reception,"
Miss H o l c h e r commented.
"They were a joy to teach,”
Miss Williams added. Each student filled out an evaluation of

The mechanical details of a
semester at LeMoyne are under
the guidance of Dale B. Terry
(Registrar). Arrangements are
quitedetinite now, and the plan
is ready to begin as soon as
Grinneil students show their interest.
Students who spend a semester at LeMoyne will receive
transfer credits toward. their
Grinneli degree, These will ap~
\ pay much as summer school
credits do: the hours would be
added to the student’s record
but the grades earned will not
be added into his cumulative
average. The normal course
load, as planned by the com<
little which set up the exchange program, would be
three LeMoyne courses plus a
Grinneil independent project
This, of course, is a flexible arrangement, and could be
changed to meet the needs of
the individual student He
would also be asked to submit
an evaluation of his experience
to the committee in charge
within a month of his return to
Grinneil, These evaluations will
be used to guide adjustments
of the academic mechanics of
the program and in the sales-
time appeared on almost all of
the papers,
Both girls considered their
reception in the school and the
town to have been very friendly. They were enterprises frequently by various groups in
the town, bouu metro and white.
The press was also very complimentary about the ii v e
furthermore and their work.
Some mortality was to u n d
among the townspeople at first,
but most of this disappeared as
people realized that this group
'of college students was not
working on votes registration.
Although metro-white relationships are said to be among the
best in the South, the question
of votes registration is still
a very edition-packed one.

informal discussions, both Miss

Applications for a semester
at LeMoyne should be turned
in to Terry, although the actual
selection will be made by a fact

Applicants would usually have
to be sophomores or seniors,
although seniors may be considered in unusual circuit

heavily as it is in most exchange programs, although he
should be well within the requirements of a Grinneil de<

more upon subjective factors
and the°student’s reasons for
applying. Applications should
include a statement of purpose
(what he expects to accomplish
and contribute), a proposed
list of courses to be taken, and
an outline of the area of research for the independent project. They should be in to Terry
by Nov. 1 for those who desire
to attend LeMoyne second semester.
The financial arrangements or
the exchange provide that the
student will pay Grinneil tuition costs and room and board
at the LeMoyne rates, These
will vary according to arrangements, but should average
about $200 for the semester.
warning any unusual circumstances, a student’s scholarship

The uniqueness of LeMoyne College is bound up
in the complexities of its roles, its atmosphere, and its
faculty, administration, and student body.
Founded in 1870 as a normal school for teacher
education, LeMoyne now has the endorsement of the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The road
to correlation has been filled with hard work and many
problems; smoothed only by some of the “conservation,

of most colleges founded during the reconstruction. The
1870 mounting was possible by a gift of $20,000 from Dr.
Julius LeMoyne, a Washington physician. The school
has been request, and its philosophy has changed several times over the years, but its basic principles remain
the same. Through its years as a high school, teachertraining school, and liberal arts college, its prime europe has been “. . . to train youth in effective Christian
using, clear thinking and synthetic appreciation."
The college has awarded over 2,000 bachelor degrees since its conversion to a four-year liberal arts
college in 1928. Despite this new emphasis on liberal
art, LeMoyne still supplies the public schools of Memphis and Shelby County with a good percentage of their
fathers, just as it did when it was the only school in
the region which trained metro teachers. The college
is also proud of the increasing number of its graduates
that enter graduate school for further study and professional training in medicine, law, the ministry, government work, and college teaching.
LeMoyne is now thoroughly non-victorian, and
makes no distinction in its admissions policy as to race,
religion, or personality. It demands of its students a

future careers or further study. Faculty members, 25%

has retained itsﬁstanding as a computer college, drawing 95% of its student body of 550 from Memphis and
the surrounding areas. The college provides an extensive program of cultural and social activities and

LeMoyne college has assumed a role of leadership and
a position of excellence among Southern metro col—

Soccer Team Overpowers Shimer
Good Teamwork
By Steve Casey
The Grinnell soccer team,
combining a sticky defense with
a persistent offense, overpowered Shimer last Saturday 50.
The defense kept Shimer from
starting a sustained attack and
the offense, packing the scoring
punch or absent Vincent Anku,
kept featuring Shimer’s defense, forming mistakes which
were converted into Grinnell
goals.
' Grinnell’s offense began applying pressure in the first
quarter with only brief inter<
rules when Shimer had the ball.
Fred Miller scored the first
goal near the end of the quarter
comparing a long attack on the
Shimer goal.
The second quarter found

Later when the Shimer goalie
lost control of the ball after a
Grinnell shot, relax Lungu took
it and scored to give Grinnell
a 3-0 half-time lead.
Frank Chilingulo scored the
only goal of the third quarter
on a penalty shot. Ted Cole
scored his second goal in the
fourth quarter when the Shimer
goalie lost control of the ball
again. allowing Cole to kick it
in the net.
Saturday‘s game was a real
team win for Grinnell. By adding highvscoring Vincent Anku
to the linear, Grinnell should
now be tough competition for
anybody during the rest of the
season.
