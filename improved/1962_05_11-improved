The your’r problem
After a full year of operation three areas of basic
problems, three “more spots" in the student court system.
:re becoming increasingly apparent. Students must honest-
ill investigate the problems of procedure, personnel and
, instructional destinations in legal apparatus of the court.
The major problem is procedures. Tlle by-laws of the
courts, both primary and high court, have been written and
permitted with newly the
court’s handling of cases has (il'lVOllldeel‘lt‘cents to anger
and caused a confusion for er l'done concerned that is llll‘
co decide to an atmosphere 01‘ effective judicial decision.
procedures inconsistencies have placed the student ill
I disadvantageous position when appearing before the court.
insurance and incl science in this problem area is making
conducted to all atmosphere of effective judicial decision,
' The personnel “more spot" is characterized by a kind
of “judicial information" practices by the justices outside
the countries. Proceeding of the court arevsoinetimes
discussed indiscretely with friends of or the dependence
themselves paralleling the sloppiness within the court
room This does great harm to the practice of the court
and may render all important decision extremely difficult.
In‘flormality is not a luxury in which the court can induced. l
The problem of court personnel is a thirty one, but
i 5 basis is not in the character of the court justices but
in the peculiar gardens of their office. The outcomes nature 01 some of the rules which must be informed present
a c is' of conference on the part of prospective justices

Who can ”cast the first stone“.7
Finally, a distinction must be definitions made be
green the province of college administration jurisdiction
ld student could jurisdiction. It is becoming clear that
the court will never be completely free of administrative
control, bill the roles of these two elements, the court and
the administration, must be written down.
The unsatisfactory lllodlls operator now in e'let'ellis
must be abandoned; the “rules of the game" have to be
(refined. If the court is to act effectively it must have independence within its own province. There will be admin,
'st/r tion limits on the court's freedom to act, but these lions s will be set»down and known. The game can then be play

The big present goal of any

But industrialization is also connected with a lot of problems.
