SGA President Boston presents
academic honor plan to senate
By Richard Ohlemeyer
S at B Staff Writer
This week the student senate
meeting convicted of two officers’
reports, Terry ParSSinen, speaker
of the senate, reported that money from the soma machines which
would ordinarily go into the see—
dial income fund is being mitchell to pay for broken or unre-
turned soma bottles.
PARSSINEN requested that
students return bottles promptly
and avoid breaking them. Money from the special income fund
pays part of the expenses of
Grinnell's foreign students.
Al Boston, Student Government Association president,
presented some ideas for later
consideration. Among these
was a suggestion that a college-wide academic honor system be institutes.
Under the system, all persons
would take an path to conduct
themselves generally and from.
use not to induced in any form
of creating. in addition, persons
taking the path would assume
the responsibility of seeing that
others do not cheat. Boston mentioned that he expected the part
about taking responsibility for
the poverty of others would
meet with more opposition than
the rest oi the system.
ANOTHER IDEA presented by
Boston was a proposal for an
independent symposium entitled
“The Democratic Process in a
Time of Crisis." Such a symposium could be made up of study
groups from campus organized
tions.
The third idea Boston spoke
on was the establishment of a
campus charity fund to centre use to recognized qualities which
we do not already contribute to
as a campus.

JForce: grades
By Dim Friedlander
5&8 Staff Writer
Carl grades, characterized as
a professional revolutionary, spoke Tuesday on “The
American Revolution: The Rise
of the metro in the South.” J
grades told of the offerﬁ of.
metro and white integrationist
leaders in the South to Chal-l
large a way of life which has.
changed little since the Civill
War. ,
By the denial of the Bill of 1
Rights, particularly the first
amendment, thesauthernnonViolent revolution now occurring may be completed to turn t
toward violence, grades said. i
The House Un-American AC-l
entities Committee (HUAC) and
its children, the State UAC’S,
were cited as the main installed
to this peaceful revolution.
These committees, grades said,
in an attempt to divide the races, have accused white integral
florists of being trailers or Subversives and thus, by their love
ic, columnists In Mississippi
every integrationist was focus—
ed of being a Communist, he
said.
ln an attempt to senate the
Constitution, Alabama has tried
to pass an inspection warning all
integrationist activities. The logs
ic is that since concentrations
often are met with white job
violence they threaded the
“peace and probability" of Ala-.
bama, When roots ,trust the
demonstration are invariably are
tested instead of the instructors
of the violence.
AN EXAMPLE of violence oc—
turned recently when a state
representative shot and killed a
metro truck driver who had
participated in a votes registry-l
tion campaign. Not only was
there no proposition but a
witness was later blogger by a
state browser and then accused
of assault and fixed $25.
It is impossible to attack justice in the South since the
courts, as well as the mass
media, are controlled by the
owners of the land and industry, They have a tested inter
est in legislation.
BEADEN EXPLAINED that
he believes that 90 per cent of
Southern degrees are for integration and 40 per cent are
military. About a third of the
Southern writes are fed up
with legislation, only 10 to 15
per cent supporting this policy.
grades thinks the Kennedy
Administration has been slow
in civil rights action but has
reached more quickly since
Oxford. But he arrested the
administration will not move
any faster than the people
demand.
grades proposed several immediate measures to help integration in the South. One was
increased federal intervention if
necessary to avoid violence. Ark
other was the evolution of the

58:13 Sports Co-editor
The Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference has put
Life, Look, Sport and the rest of the Official AlleAmez’icon football team tickets to shame. Where each of these
magazines might pick a first and second team (22 players), the MCAC has for its All-Conference selections 61105"
en a first—team offense, 3 first-team defense, a second-
"team offense, a second~team defense and 58 renewable
relations7102 players in all.
Thus the MCAC has chosen 102 players as the
best in it conference completed of ten teams which
can only have 110 players on the field on any time
during the five Saturday afternoon games.
The crystal-ball papers named three Pioneers to the
starting offensive and three to the top defensive team,
giving Grinnell 27 per cent of the starting teams. They
gave Grinnell 18.2 per cent of the second teams and 17.7
per cent of the first teams, second teams and the renewable
sections combined. This means 18 out of the 102 named
were from Grinnell.
A mistake has been made. The MCAC is gaming every
good player in the Conference (and perhaps a few favor‘te
sons who area’t even good) instead of gaming the best
players. In 2t league of ten teams it’s deep within the realm
of the assure to name 102 players.
0n the mythical team penny Asby was named to a
starting defensive tackle although he played little at that
position during the season. Sophomore Dennis women-in
played the defensive tackle spot for the Pioneers during
much of the season.
Beloit, one of the most innocent offensive teams in the
Conference, picked up one starter on the offensive team
iJohn women, a early tackle. And two Beloit banks, a.
guard, and a tackle received renewable mention as offer»
live players. How can stars be chosen from a team which
went nowhere?
Grinnell Sports a sitemap swimming team this year.
This virtually eliminates the team from any chance of
winning dual meets. Half of this year’s variety consists of
lettelmen, all fine swingers. The other half is entries on
the variety level.
The fact that the once outstanding Grinnell swimming
team is reduced to at six-man squad is Sad. Last year Grinnell possibly had its stainless team ever but: lost in the
Conference meet to an even stronger Carleton continuing.
Moreover, Irv Simone, the Grinnell coach, has produced
nine Conference champions in the last 11 years.
Then this year several outstanding swingers
failed to come out for the sport they excel in. The
backstlloker who finished second in the Conference
last year and first the year before has quit. The finest
all-event sticker on the team last year has quit. The
sticker who was named the most improved for two
straight years has quit. The Conference champion river has transferred. A transfer student who love for
the freshmen last year has quit. Others have quit.
Last year Grinnell sam'using publicity was filled with
information about three sophomores who were advertiser
asefilrinllell's hope for the future. Two of them have peter .
Why do these swingers no longer wish to compete
on the intercollegiate level? Some say they’re tired of
,swimming. Some say they don't get along with the coach.
‘Some say their grade point sellers when they swim. Some
don’t wish to follow a right training schedule; they must
if they wish to swim for Simone.
Are these reasons valid? Do they have to be? I have
no pat answer. No student is under any commission to par»
ticipate in anything at Gl‘innell. I am not timing an and-ly
blast at the swingers or the coach. I’m only pointing out
the situation which exists today.
