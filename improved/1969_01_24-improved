From the xerox quarter to
Students, Faculty and Administration.
We wish to announce that
we have accepted an account—
ment as quarter in Residence
at the State University of New
York at Binghamton effective
July, 1969.
Since 1962 we have been
Al‘lists-in—Residence at Grinnell College, The relationship
which We have had with the
College has been very qualifying to us. The support and ap—
prediction to the college community has made our stay here
I very meaningful one It is in
this spirit of conventions and
because of the quality‘ of Grinnell College as a liberal arts institution, that we degree leaving for this new appointment.
-We simply hope that the Ar-
lists-in-Residence Program is
No. I!
an ideal which the College will
continue.
A major involvement at
SUNY Binghamton will be a
new graduate program in the
performance of chamber music
— the first program of its kind.
We will train string quarters
for careers in this profession.
We feel that this type of pro«
gray is vital to the develop
ment of chamber music in this
country. As in Grinnell we will
also present concerts, lecture
recitals. and private instruction.
Our experience at Grinnell
has been deeply fulfilling. We
will miss our friends Ind colleagues very much.

New Cache For Old Boolts
The student used book store has been
in operation for three years, working as
a student service and making just about
no profits (375 it low or so extra books
last year). The store buys textbooks at
60% of cost and sells them at 70% of
Cost Also, at the end oi the year it
buys books from Seniors on a cash basis
at 40% 0t cost. The hours oi the used
book store, which is located in the
basement of the Fine Arts building, are
“sporadic", according to the manpower
that can be obtained. The users book
store will continue in operation “as long
as students are selling or buying books
. . .or until the theatre department
throws us out",
One at the problems of the used book
store is space and location. “Due to an
expanding volume oi texts" more room
is needed. Also, Tom Thomas, SGA
president, would like to see the store
expand into being more than simply a
temporary thing, limited only to textbooks. This would mean having the
store open. “say, on Monday and Wednesday nights from seven to nine"
year-round, sewing not just as a used
book exchange but also as a place for
records, posters, paper, and new books
to be bought and sold at lower prices
than those found in the book store or on
the open market, It would thus provide
competition with the book store, leading
to possible covering ot prices time.
it a more central and specials location could be found. it more manpower
could be obtained and it more capital
would be made available, the used book
store could “begin year-round operation as a useful service to the student
body".

EDITORIALS,-
A New Policy
Grinnell College is located
in a town which is often considered isolated. In my opinion
it is very much in the main
stream of events. It, along with
many institutions in this society, is underlying V a r i o u 5
changes as the goals and interests of the college community
and the society change. This is
my attitude towards the Grin—
well situation and is the basis
for my editorial policy. As editor, I would like to make the
newspaper an example of this
attitude. The paper will focus
on the goals and interests of
the “community.”
The charles and Black will
attempt to represent and challenge the situation by being
concerned with those issues
and events which are important to the variety of people at
Grinnell. This shall include
concerns directly related to the
educational situation and to the
greater society of which we are
a part, even if it is in sheltered
Grinnell College, Grinnell,
Iowa.
Some new features are being
introduced to the paper in order to fulfill this helpful role.
First, the management of the
newspaper will be extended to
include an editorial board and
a research editor. In order to
become more aware and respective to the variety of issues
and people that exist at Grinnell, the editorial board will
meet weekly to give direction
to the paper’s concerns. A special research editor will be
working to provide well explorer, in-depth articles and
surveys. In addition, there will
be several regular columns.
Social and political problems
will be covered in a “Revolu»
tion" column and a series of
draft articles. Our immediate
situation will be covered in a
guide to the town of Grinnell,
“the talk of the town," and a
second column of commentary
on Grinnell College. Feature
articles will appear as often as
possible raising other valid issues. Hopefully faculty and administrators will freely participate along with students. The
goal is primarily community»
tion, through the presentation
of ideas and the facts of events
which are of concern to the
college community.

Help Wanted!
The sail; is under new management
and needs all the help it can get! Anyone interested in typing, reporting.
copy reading, or any other kind or
help, please drop in on us in the north
’ end of the Forum basement, or a note
“We Won’t Go . ..”
As editor of the charles and
Black, I have signed the 19681969 version of the US. Na
signal Student Association “We
Won’t Go” statement for student body treatments and editors. After fighting through
other channels to change the
course of America’s foreign
policy and to remove the identifies of the draft system, the
problem still remains. Left
without alternatives the statement concluded,
“Along with thousands of
our fellow students, we campus
leaders cannon participate in a
war which we believe to be
removal and adjust. Although
this, for each of us, is an in—
density personal decision, we
publicly and collectibles express our intention to refuse
induction and to aid and support those who decide to refuse.
We will not serve in the military as long as the war in Vietnam continues.”
Although our newly elected
President pleased, “to constitute my office, my emerging,
and all of the wisdom I can
common to the cause of peace
among nations,” I’m afraid this
statement is still necessary.
Although the statement is not
appropriate to my position, I
give it my full support as editor
of the 5&3. After serious con—
federation I have concluded
that this statement represents
my feelings and the actions I
would take if I were in the
position of a draft age, American male. Although this will
not effectively change the situation, the consideration and
commitment involved in pricing this objective is important.
I hope I am representing the
other students on the Grinnell
campus.

To the Editor:
Having just taken a, comprehensive
examination and a GRE, I objects
These examinations in History were not
unfairly didﬁcult, but they were not
fairly certified. For one, I learned nothing new. It would seem to me that in
any educational system, an examination
could support itself only on the grounds
that it challenged and helped synthesize previous learning. It should be only
a learning experience. However, the
comprehensive, and especially the Graduate Record, only tested for a required,
quantitative knowledge or [our years of
study. i did not come out of the test
satisfied that I had Either discovered
new understanding or better completed
the unity or my major field. I had only
regurgitated a few dim memories
brought to life by some sports review he
more the test.
recently, it the comprehensives' purpose is generated to the state oi “lodging” the value oi human students, (as
finals so often do) why is it necessary?
Our computerized transcripts already
have our value divided and subdivided
into numerical standards. why is the
Student anticipated once more With a
grade? Graduate schools don't require
such information. An excellent pass on a
comprehensive does not raise a student
item the bottom ten percent of his class.
It would only mean that for once, he
had gained some correct (acts. No tests
could really cover every diverse person’s academic progress over four
years.
Finally, I don‘t understand why my
scheduled graduation must be jeopardized by a possible failure in a Comprehensive. I would suppose every course
next semester is also a threat to such
graduation, but not extraordinarily so.
Each course is part of a normal study
load. However, my two spring couple—
websites are the equivalent of two extra
term papers for the semester. In my
Case, that means I will have six or seven
term papers [0 write. it seems almost

Occult-characterized Exhibition
By RICHARD WICHSTROM
The paintings and drawings of but
lilanrhom, American printer, John :1.
Graham an exhibit at Schaeiter gallery
through February ii, presents a comprehensive sample of the late work of
this important ﬁsure in American art.
He studied law in Russia and generated
to the United States in the mid»20's
where, for the first time, he began to
study art. During the 30‘s Graham
painted in a style similar to the postCubistic style at Picasso. Through this
early work, he formed a major link between the developments in European
and American art.
Blessed with an eye for beauty, he
was a connoisseur of African, Egyptian,
and Italian Renaissance an. Unlike
most American artists, Graham was
able to paint with complete understanding at the European postsCubislic style.
In the mid-30’s he was 8 close friend of
the then unknown artists, works, follows, beginning, and David Smith,
among others.
In the 40's he discussed his Picassolike style, and walked along realistic
lines closely related to the work of UC»
cells and Greek classifieds It. is work
from this period which is presented.
This work is constitutes trim ice.
The ﬂatly modules figures exhibit an
interface of large, abstract contact and
convex terms and cross, sleeping line,
which link it tn the 20th Century Perhaps the most. obvious realistic train
is his use a! dressed and disturbed eyes
They are ﬁred in a painting state for
the double purpose of answering space
to a point in the room and or creating
tension.
It is this tension which forcefully commitments his participation with the
justice These works are rich in occurs
photography, most of which is far over
my head. For example in Head or a
Woman, 1954 the puppy at the left eye
is larger than the right. In the symposium of the occurs this is a sign of a
rapid spiritual growth, His many sell.
ports-hits are rich in photography.
Graham claims that his work was not
intended to be beautiful but to monkey
installation about the occurs, recognizable only to a new.
Art News, October, 1960, in a review
at his works claims, “The ceremony he
believes in, is, like Hundirli’s, generated
to the louisville stage. Far today magic
is disappointing in its bestiality and inconsequentiality." i coupon't disagree
more strongly with this discussed of
Graham's work and the occurs. exploration into the unknown order at this
world has been made in the last few
decades in the fine arts, tar example,
the music or John Cage, chance drawings of A11), etc. The Western culture
has been blind too long to this aspect
of “reality,"
1 find the work or Graham challenging, stimulating, and painting in my
opinion it's one of the better exhibitions
presented this year.
