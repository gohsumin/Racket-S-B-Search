anything Tells Conclusions About Liberal Arts Colleges
To the editors
After four years of more or
less passive observation I have
come to the following conclu»
sign about the facts of life at
a liberal arts college:
The liberal arts college exists for two purposes; I) The
primary purpose is the certification of the college and all
people connected with it, including the board of systems,
administration, faculty, alumni, and students. 2) The second»
are purpose is to continue the
student of the value of liberal
education, and to assist him in
building a foundation of knowledge, about himself as well as
his academic subjects.
Both of these purposes are
good, and they are incorporated.
For example. as the glory or
good reputation of the college
increases, the college receives
more money which can be used
to improve the educational of—
springs, which in turn assists
In further increasing glory.
Although I do hope to gain
from the running off of any
glory which Grinncll College
has obtained or may in the Iu<
sure attack, I feel that I will
profit far more from the educa-
 
signal experience of my years
at Grinnell. It appears to me
that, unfortunately, what should
be the secondary purpose of
the college has become the primary purpose—that is, glory
has been placed before education, when it should be the
other way around.
The academic and cultural
education offered at Grinnell
is good, but social education is
at a prepvschool level.
If education, in the greatest
sense of the word, were the
primary purpose of the college,
then all students would be considered as ends in themselves
and all decisions concerning
them would be made in their
own best interests and with
their participation. But, in fact,
the primary purpose of the
college is its own certification,
and individual students are
only a means to this end. Insofar as students are a means
to an end and not an end in
themselves they have no rights.
(Except for the right to life
itself, in a biological rather
than popular - psychological
sense, which is guaranteed by
the state.)
The social contract idea is

Proctors Called Unnecessary:

To file editor
In the past few weeks there has
been much concern over an explosion of feeling between the ad-
registration and student government. The result has been a humor,
certainly not denied by the administration, that the long threat-
eyed "system of advisors” will be.
institutes on North campus next
year. In view of the statements expressed by some members of the
administration on student enforcement of rules, there can be little
doubt that these “advisors" will
also be tractor-s.
The philosophy behind a system
of printers is basically represent,
because it implies, quite Simply,
that students old enough and intelligent enough to Come to Grin
well are still not capable of governor themselves. The administra‘
Lion’s reply ro this would seem to
be that unfortunately the students
are not capable of governing themselves; look at the recent villa<
tions on North campus. This, how»
ver, is not quite true. Actually,
the case is that the students are
not capable of enhancing the rules
that the adminisfl'al‘non has prescribed. 1 am referring to rules
such as those on illegal limitation.
lustlrunng a system of printers
will not effectively solve this problem of enforcement, because it is
a simple sociological tones that
laws which do not councils with
the moves oi the society are very
difficult to efforts. This is the
reason why police have such a
problem With traffic violations.
The opportunity result of attempting to efforts these rules that
rlon't cnlncide with the moves is
that eventually all law, even that
 
which has a moral foundation, begins to be held in contents.
I may be presumpluous in preventing to speak for the entire
campus, but l believe that there
are two rules which the majority
of the’students feel should be an;
forced: quiet hours, and disorderly
Conduct. Other rules such as those
on illegal limitation deal with a
person's own mobility which most
people feel should be properly left
to himself. so long as a person's
conduct does not interface with or
injury someone else. he should be
allowed to go his own way.
What is specially making is that
I feel that the majority of-the faculty and the administration also hold
,lo this philosophy. However, we
pass the buck to one another. Some
students say we must efforts
these rules because of the armenia
station; the administration says
it’s the trustees. and the trustees
say it’s the parents, an anonymous
group from whom it.is almost impossible to obtain a statement of
opinion. It might be said here,
however, that allen'e are many parents who are more than willing to
Send their Children to schools that
have a far more liberal set of rules
than Grinnell At Northwestern, for'
example, llnderciasswomen have
2:00 AM. hours, and upperclass
women have no hours at all.
an aside from this point. it would
seem that if there is any group in
society that will stand on_principle, it should be the academic com-
‘equity. And, we should make and,
efforts only those rules in which
we really believe. If the college
wishes to hold in this policy, I am
quite sure that the students are
capable of elliorcmg it, and that
there is no need for printers.
Richard violation
 
student enters the college he is
in effect agreeing that he will
give up any rights which he
previously had. in return for
certain advantages. These advantages include: the advantage of taking a certain non»
her of academic'courses each
semester; the advantage of
taking the liberal arts exam
and senior comp‘s; and finally,
if he utilizes all of these ad—
packages and dress’t do anything naughty, the advantage
of graduation. In return for
these advantages he also has
the responsibility to study hard
enough that he dress’t found
out, thus waiting someone's
money and increasing the col<
legs’s dropped rate, which
would damage its glory.
when one is a partner to a
social contract he has no rights
except those which were
agreed to in the contract. The
governing power may grant
certain privileges for the sake
of experience, but these are
not rights, and can be withdrawn at any time.
Among the rights which are
lost are: the right to stay out
past 12 pm. if you are female;
the right to know "why” if you
are picked out; the right to
privacy, no matter who you
are; the right to drive an automobile; the right to drink liquid if over 21 years old. At
the present time the last two
lost rights are returned to certain students as privileges, but
they may be withdrawn at any
time for attractions of the rules,
or for no reason. Student government is another privilege.
In the experiencing quest for
college rule changes it seems
that some Students think that
their rights are being isolated
—they forget that at college
one has no rights,‘ But occasionally, through the geneva~
'hence of the board of trustees
and the administration, more

too many students abuse their
privileges, the privileges will
be withdrawn not only from
'the guilty ones, but also from
the innocent ones. For this
reason, I feel that the anger
over the South counter case
should be directed toward the
students involved and not toward-the faculty committee. In
many cases rule violations are
understandable, because it is
difficult to obey rules which
seem adjust and irrelevant to
one’s own best interests—but
tn the South Younlrei- case the
rule is, I think, just, and its
violation is to be concerned.

that: 1) the recommended rule

This is my view of the sites»

Grinnell College were a democratic society, with a student
government having final legislative and judicial power in
student affairs, instead of the
authorization society that it is.
But as long as this is the way
things are, we are at least better
off if we approach problems
with a realistic attitude and
don't waste time cutting our

Sthwengel Calls for
federation in GOP
Republican compression Fred
Schwengel (Iowa, ﬁrss dist.) told
an audience here Wednesday night
that “the only way out at the Republican diploma Is to accept the
creek of federation."
Speaking in Roberts Theatre as a
guest of the campus Young Republicans, Schwengel said that "the
moderator did not get organized
and center on a candidate for the
Republican national convention last
summer at San Francisco They
were not sufficiently concerned I
hope they have learned their les<
son."
Schwengel was narrowly detected In the Nov. 3 election as he
sought his sixth term in Congress
Democrats, behind nov. Harold E.
Hughes, generally sweet the state
of Iowa in that election
. Continuing his stand for federation, Schwengel said, “We eat-
, early believe and give to consumer
people the alliance that federation is best because it is a spirit
that does not press advantage too
far — it is an attitude that seeks
to understand and will respect the
inﬂlenses that drive people to extremes — it is a feeling that lenses
a need for a unity of all people -—
it is arspirit that recognized the
common fate and limitations of
human beings with a faith in the
sacredness of man"

Poor Shooting Leads lo Loss
As Basketball Season Siarls
By Steve Casey
Grinnell started its basketball
season with a 89-76 loss to Angus»
tank on Tuesday night. The game
was close for the first half with
Augustana taking a 44—40 lead, But
Grinnell let up at are beginning of
the second half and Augustana
coupled to a fifteen point lead that
they protected for the rest of the
game.
Poor shooting was a big factor in
the loss. Grinnell got enough shots
but could not make enough of them
to keep the pressure on the Augustano defense. The Grinneli defense
employed a santa-man full court
press for most of the game. This
gave Augustana some easy shots
when a small Grinnell player
Would be forced to guard a tall
Augustana player under the basket.
But Coach deutsch was doing some
experimenting to see if he Could develop a defense for the small bio»
needs to use against some future
tall opponents Grinllell will face.
Coach deutsch was pleased with
the work of his front line. Jim
phones seems to have recovered
from a pro-season injury and
played well. Ted sister and slide
Smith also played comfortable
games. deutsch though was di5<

By Paul bring
I continue this week with
what, quite originally, appears
to be the only issue which people concerned with Grinneli can
address themselves to in our
school paper—that of the “rock
image." Again. I hope that by
selling further into this problem I will be able to make
both the context of the problem
and my own feelings more explicit.
The most obvious, and therefore most easily overlooked,
fact involved in this problem
is that no one is admitted to
Grinnell who is intellectually
full. Certainly one could not be
drive and. assure enough to
suggest that the admissions department is something “dumb
athletes" who do not have the
potential to add something to
this institution or are not able
to appreciate the many advantages which it offers
, recently, as Mr. Pl H. batteries (class of 42) so adroitiy
pointed out in his letter last
week, there are many Grin—
neil athletes who attack fine
records both at and after Grin—
nelI. The out—used grade point
comparisons (Athletes 2.7, all
North Campus 2.6), the fact
that three of seven trials are
lettcrmen, and the many fine
individual a C his V events of
Grinnell athletes after graduation are evidence of this, For
his article, however, I would
like to eliminate those athletes
with better than a B average,
for generally they are considered to be academicians rather than part of the “rock
image.” Whether this is fair or
affair is irrelevant in his Context. It is the 3‘0 and under
athletes which constitute the
‘rock image" to most students
and faculty on campus.
1 stated in my original article
that it was opportunity that the
”rock image" was too often
nonacademic. More unfortunately, I am afraid this image is
often a false one which is calculated prior to adequate ex»

sequence. Too often students
and faculty fail to judge these
gentleman as individuals rather than as a ‘rockﬂ‘ There is no
reason to believe that the man
with the Honor G jacket is not
as concerned with who he is and
the nature of man and society
as the long-failed rebel in
boots.
The obvious question now is
what does all this mean? It
means that although Grinnell
may admit a few people who,
except for athletics would not
have been, and as I stated last
week even this is controversial,
the achieve is too often not given a chance to become an "intellectual." For reasons far beyond the Grinnell campus, the
word "achieve" seems to have
