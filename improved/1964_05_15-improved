women revision Game of Numbers.
Offers Modified Tutorial System
. By Susan Taylor
“To free students "no learn
how to learn by themselves” is
the end of a liberal arts education, according to Dr. Howard
fl. women, President of the Colege
Addressing the college CDm<
munich for the last time before
his designation takes effect
July 1, women saw no need to
shell on the past. ”I would like
to look ahead," he said, “to try
but some’ideas about the way
education might be conducted
at Grinnell in the future."
Making reference to his 1962
corporation Address, “A Game
of Numbers,” women said that
his present comments were a
modification of the views expressed in that speech, and
that they might be entitled “A
Game of Numbers dedicated."
He said that the modification
of his former plan resulted from
his recent tour of European
universities. He felt that
the European system had decided disadvantages, but that
valuable lessons could, still be
learned from it — particularly
from the tutorial system of
Oxford and Cambridge.
women defined a Grinnell student's aims as “progress to
ward broad liberal learning
and and progress toward a ma»
for field." He felt that these
goals could he better met by
a modified tutorial system
which might be adopted by the
college.
Under the system outlined by
the president each professor
would teach two courses in
steam of the present three and
consequently e a c h student
would take only three courses
a semester instead of four.
“In my opinion the college
is still offering too many
courses,” women stated. When
we have new educational ideas
we tend to add them to what we
have without shopping anything. By wedding out courses,
women hopes to free time for
independent study and tutorial
activities.
,Under the proposed modified
tutorial system he forests solutions to some of the problems
of faculty-student relations
and the advisory system. Each
student would have both an understand tumor and a major tumor. Each faculty tumor would
have 300 hours a semester once
taken up by teaching a third
course free for tutorial anti
Seniors reminder:
Reserve Rooms Now
Seniors are again reminder
that they may reserve campus
housing for their announcement guests at the Alumni office beginning at 1:00 pm. on
Monday, May 18. Office hours
will continue throughout the
week from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.
during which time seniors may
secure reservations. Each send
for will be allowed space for
three guests and will pay for
their reservations when they
are made. Miss Jones, the
Alumni Secretary, friendly requests that seniors do not delay
in making housing arrangements for their guests.
 
ties, As an understand tumor, the
professor would guide his advisors in preparation for their
liberal arts comprehensive examination. The major motors
would hold work closely with
junior and senior motors, hold
seminars, and guide the motors
in the preparation of a senior
thesis and in study for senior
major comprehensives. Regular
meeting with advisors would be
the rule.
women also stated that the
students should be free to take
the liberal arts exam when
they are ready. “In a sound
exam there must be allowance
for individuality.” or the present JLAE he said, “We have
made good progress in an un<
charged field," but; there is still
much work to be done.
Revision of the trading system for course work was another feature. Replacement of
A and B with High Pass, C—Plus
and C with Pass, and D and F
with Failure would eliminate
the intense competition for
grade and allow the student
to do more independent work.
However, the rigorous letter
grades would be maintained for
required independent study and
comprehensive exams, This independent Work and couple<
website exam program would
be Weighted as oneefourth of
the student’s entire performance.
Although this system would
mean .many advantages for
students, women said, there
would also be problems. The
number of courses offered by
the college would decrease,
“The range of election freedom,’ women countries, would
be expanded. However, he
added, “i see no way of pro‘
riding freedom with the opportunity to make mistakes.”
Those unable to function under
the system would not qualify
for a Grinnell degree.
Those awarded degrees in
such a system. he said, would
be better prepared for grades
ate school, for life, and for
lifetime education.

Spring Day, 1944- '64 Reviewed,traditions, Innovations Highlight

Wednesday. I have an hourly
then!" Each year, as the monitors end and the Grinnell campus changes from brown to
green, the question prices
again. Everyone, students and
processors alike, wants to know.
Spring Day becomes conversation topic No. l. Generations of
Grinnell students have wanted
density for their specific form
of Spring Day, just. as we have
the last three weeks.
Twenty years ago, Spring
Day “finally spring just about
5 minutes before everyone was
ready to give up.” Spring Day
during this period was unannounced at'about 8:30 in the
morning. The rest of the morning was spent doing assigned
campus improvement projects,
followed by a picnic, games
and a program in the afterThe event in 1944 was very
much girl-nominated, for this
was the “New Grinnell” of
the war years. The few men
remaining, however, managed
to turn the mud fight (one of
many now-defence traditions of
the day) into an all~out brand.
The 5&3 reporter, not Without
 
pride, declared that “For the
first time in the history of Grin»
well Spring Days, everybody
was thrown into the mud pit.”
Spring Day, 1948, was held in
the mud and rain that only a
Grinnell spring can produce.
The day included the traditional
projects, aug-of-war, egg-throwing contest and picnic. By now,
Spring Day was also the time
of the initiative of the new
members of Grinnell Players.
Their sites, which convicted
mainly of improving pacific
suits, took place in carroll

softball game, sitting faculty
men against the soil-1P and Student council members, _
May 14, 1949, saw a wild
Spring Day, nominated by the
contests and races of the many
married couples who attended
Grinnell in the post-war years.
Pie-eating contests and wheelbarrow races were highlighted,
as was a board contest. Tugro
wars and softball games were
also part of the day, which
ended with a dance on Cowles
Hall roof.

Senate Shows Concern Over loss
0f cross. Courses for Next Year
By made Stevenson
The student Senate passed a
resolution Wednesday night expression the concern of many
students “over the apparent
lack of funds for the hiring of
processors for next. year."
The resolution, which was
directed to the Trustees and
Administration, stated in part
that: HBecause we as students
feel that our primary purpose
in attending Grinnell is to receive an excellent education.
and because the tuition rate is
rising each year, we wish to express to you our desire that
the quality and quantity of faculty members be maintained
and increased, even though this
will perhaps mean using somewhat less elegant physiCal facilities."
A letter from Marilyn Alt, the
sponsor of the resolution, Was
read to the Senate. Miss Alt
noted that “I ran a comparative study of faculty size and
course offerings this year with
those for next. year. At this
point there is a net loss of ten
faculty members—this includes
those who are on leave, and I
 
am told that some of the positions are still trying to be filled.
There is also a net loss of fifteen courses for the next year."
Many senators gave the dis-
confirmation of funds from the
Ford Foundation as a reason
for the difficult financial situation of the College; however,
John Black said he “understood that money from the
Ford Foundation went into
building programs and not into
the operating expenses of the
College."
Black moved to place the following amendment at the end
of the resolution: “We would
request an extra union from
the College Administration as
to why, in view of the tuition
increase, the College finds its
finances securely limited.” The
amendment was passed.

Campbell, chairman of the musicians Committee, indicated
that the committee had found

Early in the second webster

considered. In suite of these
proposed changes, Spring Day
1954 was a very traditional affair.

Transcript Trouble
Last June, the Board
scholarship represent rule because of student
sure in the form of a references which cable
of Trustees published the
YESfor
repeat of the clause by a vote of 644-77. The reason
for responding the rule, given both by the students and
by the Board, was that such regulation was not in
keeping with the philosophy of a liberal arts college.
There is another un-liberal-arts like rule that ought
to be brought to students’ attention and which ought
to be repeated by the Board of Trustees. This regulation states that any student who sends a transcript
to another college immediately roses eligibility for a
room the following year, regardless of the fact that
he or she has paid the $50 room-reservation fee.
In explaining the reason behind this rule, one administration member noted that il: makes it easier for
the college to assure rooms to students who are sure
of returning. While this might be the case, it is still
a fact that the student has paid $50 to guarantee a
room and that this $50 will be lost if the student finally
does decide to transfer.
This $50 should be sufficient payment to the college in cases where a student really is not sure of re-
turning in the fall. Why
compound his worried by
cutting him off from this college before he is accepted
at another school?
The college has every right to want to keep its
first-rate student body, but it should use positive
means of doing so.

Sanity of Stones
Of course, it goes without
saying that there will be a
few ”minor problems” and
*"little difficulties” [0 be taken
care of after’ a nuclear holocaust. » One of these “minor
problems" concerns itself with
the question of what we are
going Do do about our jobs
after a nuclear cataclysm.
The United States modern»
silent, in its charitable way, has
come up with the answer to
this question. Most of the governmental branches have sent,
in recent months, memorabilia to all personnel concerning what is expected of them
regarding their job obligations
after a thermonuclear war.
illustration of these memorabilia is the following directive
from satellite O’green, administrative officer of the U. 5.
Commission on Civil Rights:
“All employees, if presented
from reporting to their regular
place of duty because of enemy
action, are requested to go to
the nearest Post Office and ask
for a federal employee registrar
tion card. Fill out all spaces on
the card and return it to the
Post Office clerk. The employ»
log agency in the registration
 
card should be shown as General Services Administration,
with the branch as the U. S.
Commission on Civil Rights inasmuch as our official records
are maintained by GSA. The
Post Office will forward your
card to the Civil Service Commission. When the Civil Service Commission- receives your
card, they will notify the General Services Administration.
They can then decide where
and when you should report for
duty. This should be done as
soon as possible after an attack
to enable you to be kept on the
roster of active employees and
to have your pay forbidden to
you. If you change your address after the card has been
sent, get a new one in the same
manner prescribed above. Ali
though you complete your registration promptly, there may
be some delay before you receive your work instructions. . .”

Letters to the Editor
Corrects Herzog Statement:
qualified Position on Nominees
To the editors
Since I was substantially discussed by Mr. Herzog in the
Senate article which appeared
in last week’s 5&3, I feel that I
must endeavor to set the record straight. Referring to the
High Court nominees of Pete
Klein, movie coleman, since
Anku and Bill think, I was
quoted as stating, “there could
have been better people."
Essentially this was not my
opinion then or now. A minor‘
ltd of the Nominations Commit-
tee sustained from voting on
one romance but it should be
emphasized that not one vote
was cast against any of these
people. The statement printed
by Mr. Herzog was a minority
opinion representing neither my
views nor those of the majority
of my committee.
If Mr. Herzog wishes to quote
such a statement, I feel he
should endeavor to place it in
the proper context. Slipshod
methods of reporting the news
benefit no one.

Summer Storage?
in the post, we have stored furniture and other items for you over the
summer months as a courtesy service. Because of the addition of more
nationally preliminary lines, such as the A. B. Dick Products Co., in the
application field, and because of expansion of off-set printing facilities,
and other inventory increases, we no longer have the space Io accommodate storage for you.
We will be able to accept typewriters only for storage. May we suggest
you have your typewriters ste-conditional over the summer and be already to go next fall for o school year of hard usage?
Our service is guaranteed. Your pathology is always appreciated.
