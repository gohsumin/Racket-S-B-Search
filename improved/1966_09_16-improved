Asks student participation
By HAROLD FUSON
President Glenn suggest this
week switched the broad outlined of a planning program
which he hopes will “tell us
where we want to be as a col»
legs ten or twelve years from
now." In an interview with this
reporter. President. suggest discussed several proposals which
he will present to the faculty in
the Coming weeks in an effort to
implement this planning.
The general organization of
the program will be based
around a set of three committees: a central steering committee and two subordinate committees, one on educational policy and one on physical planning and landscape. The latter
committee suggest suggested
would be divided into subcommittees dealing with particular
areas such as landscape, media
dance hall development and
physical education facilities.
_ Details to Come
The details of the commit-tee
organization are yet to be
settled and the whole program
. instead as it touched upon act<
comic policy is still subject to
faculty approval. suggest hopes,
however, to have the program
firmly on the road within a law
weeks.
suggest said he felt that the
committees must be so organized as to allow “Wide active
participation in discussions” and
at the same time provide a
means for “coming to focus”
and ordering reasonable alternatives. The aim according to
suggest is to avoid “appendix
historic" and instead arrive by

Participation arrested
suggest expressed concern for
obtaining student participation
in the work or the planning com.
matters. He has been consulting
with SGA President Steve Kent
and other student leaders as to
the best means of bringing
about this participation. Students will likely be asked to sit
on the committees and certainly
to other advice in particular
areas.
suggest said there is a possibility that he and faculty and
man Wall might ask to gnrbea

Forty students and twenty
faculty members will attend the
1966 engagement Sept. 3!) to
October 2 at phone. All are be«
ing chosen by the engagement
Committee from among interested applicants. in addition,
P re 5 id e nt suggest, means
Stauss, centers, Thompson and
Low, and Mr. Wall, chairman
oi the Faculty, will attend all or
part of the session. Robert
joyce, Chairman or the Board
of trustees, and several members of the Board of Trustees
are expected to attend part of
the session.
The engagement Committee
has announced that this year's.
engagement will be organized
to steel attention away from
specific problems to get at the
basic philosophy and purpose oi
the college.
"Back to Campus"
Kathy wagon, chairman oi the
committee, arrested in an 5&8
interview that one or the major
concerns of this year's encampa
ment will be how to “get it back
into campus.” Miss wagon
hopes that the ideas and spirit
generated at phone can be carried home to all students and
faculty.
In line with this aim, Miss
below outlined a number of
steps which the engagement
committee hopes to take after
the engagement. The usual
summary report will again be
distributed to the entire comes<
city through the campus mail.
in addition, panel discussions
will be held and perhaps a
series of hall meetings will deal
with engagement r e p o r t 5.
There is also the possibility that
the engagement discussion
groups might continue meeting
after engagement to further develop the ideas discussed at
phone.
Six Amos
Discussion at phone will be
organized in these six general
areas:
1. Grinnell presented to the
outside world —- public relations, fund-raising. alumni ab
fails. The availability of inter.
. motion about administration and
student activities both on and
off campus.
2. The student “personality"
— What is the Grinnell student?
The role of admissions in de»
remaining the type at students
attending Grinnell.
3. Academic demands and
goals of both students and faculty at Grinnell. A critical look
at curriculum and classroom,
4. The obligations of the college in regulation and restriction. The right of different
groups at Grinnell to participate
in basic decision making.
5, The relations or the college
to the outside world — oil campus programs, political activities, social protest groups and
so on. Should there be more oi
this? The advantages and problems or Iowa isolation.
6. The responsibility oi, the
college to society in general.
Do we have a public service obligation to iuliill? The goals of
higher education and the success oi the liberal arts college
in meeting them.
will be spent in getting women’s
opinions on hours, Miss Lauterbach feels that the board should
represent incident concerns in
areas other than rules, parties:
early those oi academic and so
dial matters. A specific project
of the Board is to have New Student Days group leaders extend
their. activities beyond the first
week oi school to act as reasons
between the ireshmenand their»
faculty advisors. in this way.
students could be made to feel
more comfortable talking to
members oi the faculty and ad
visits could be potential counseling assistance. The battleboards would share the responsibility of being aware or the
problems of all students, not
just freshmen.
A temporary change in women's dress rules, proposed by
the Board, has now gone into
effect, This stipulates only that

Rules Changes
In the short months of its exit—
hence the new AWS Board has made
home totally strikes toward bringIng a degree of reality to the ancient code of rules which protect
and another Grinnell womanhood.
The recent Quad dress rule change
and the new grace minutes program
pro certainly construction steps in
the right direction. But they are only short steps, and there is much
which must yet be done before
rules will reflect reality.
It seems, however, that something else must come before the
rules themselves can be changed.
Further rule changes, if they are
to be of any value, must be major
ones, so major that they require
a new and more vital connection
of what Grinnell is and ought to be.
In short, Grinnell life must begin
to reflect the kind of majority
which the rule changes will require.
To a large degree this majority
is already present. What it requires
is simply a good public relations
effort to bring it into focus and a
good theoretical study to provide
in writing the rationale which already exists in mind and action for
many of us. But while majority is
evident there are still too many
pockets of irresponsibility on both
computer. There is still too much
of what one administration official
has called the "damn foolishness”
of wrapping, There is still too much
wondering of objectionable drunkoneas and obscenity.
It is up to those who claim majority to see that such symptoms of
childishness are turned. When this
is done the rules situation can more
easily be specialized.

somehow. Others must not he entrapped

And you. dear reader. may even be able

I am a sophomore at Grlmell; that is

I had no time to sure girls into my

I had no time in take my swimming

I had no time to polish the eagle. . . .
i had no time to wait for the Cafe dec
Faro to really open for business. . .
I hardly had time to eat the food I am
omnipresently supposed to cook. . . .
It all started when I was a small child.
I was reader on Horatio older books.
They told me to make something of myself, to he industrious, to eat my own
way. My parents local me to make something of myself, in be industrious, and to
earn my own way through school. final<
ly, when the financial aid office told me
to make something of myself, in be industrious, and in earn my way through
college, I decided to make something of
myself, to be industrious, and to earn my
way through Grlunell.
Yet little did I realize the Scylleharbdian choice that my decision to put myself through school represented. it was
only after already signing my contract
with Saga that I discovered the mini-
cum wage on campus to be only lightweight (83!) cents. It was then that I first
realized to my extreme disney that to
finance my Grinnell education, I would
have to work 3,000 hours each of my
academic years at the college.
My first year at Grimell, I was on
campus 210 days. In order to finance my
31800 tuition, food, etc. in addition to m ,
travel expenses, books, and clothes,
found myself Working in Comes all hours

I had no time for amazing else. . . .

that one day — when ﬁsales was closed
for its traditional receivers-threesome
cleaning — I was able to visit my first
classes here. It was in February, I think.
about the time the debate club kids were
heading South for Mardi Gzas. I sat in
on Economics 217; there I learned that
the minimum wage in the United States
was approaching $1.60. I remember won<
during why our campus was no longer
considered a part of the United States.
Later I attended History 226. There I
learned that the Southerners had countries Abolitionist propaganda during the
Civil War by applying that Northern

remember wondering if maybe the
Southerners were right sometimes. It
might be added that i‘m not wondering
any more.

previous issues of the 5&3 re-
ﬂenter the concern of the editors for giving due publicly to
areas in which Grlnnell students
are actively concerned with the
problems of contemporary society.
The editors saw the Des
points project as an honest attempt by a relatively large
group nf Grinnell students (at
least fifty at one point) acting
on their own initiative to connect the problems of poverty in
Des Muluea Last week's root by
some 390 metro teenageis in
Des points certainly seems to
substantiate the opinion that
the problems were and are very
real ones.
No attempt was ever made n
the part of the project pure
pants Io hide information about
the project (several coffee hours
were held at which students
were invited to ask questions).
The son was certainly uni concerned wllh riding information.
The particular questions which
Miss Hughes and Miss Baker
ask about the end or the project
were largely answered in the
April 15, I966 issue of the 58:3.
The 5823 was aware of Mr.
King’s background as an 5135
organizer in Newark, New Jersey, before he came to Des
points. The 5&3 was also
aware of and reported on Mr.
King’s plans to return to New
York last spring [0 lake up community service work there.
The 5&1! will continue to fun-
ﬁll its responsibility to report
events related to the student

To the editors
The “Invalid congratulations"
column by PRJ in the last sea
issue was apply entitled. Fresha
men may indeed be uneducatcd, but certainly no more so,
proportionately, than the upperclassmen who surround item.
As a freshman, I find myself
in the unlnlellectual position of
beginning a liberal education
alien leaving a call'ly unllberzll
high school The seniors around
me do not seem to be low literally enjoyed Wltlt anything
more intellectual than pride in
their own poverty.
The fact that the pic-1970
classes were very probably
characterized by learned girls
and frustrated boys m as opposed to file learned boys and
iweniyfoul- year old girls labeled by PRJ as members of
my class —— does not seem an
issue to merit so march resentmerit. What makes PR1 think
that college moves will change
so much in the next four years
after remaining fairly constant,
although not so study, for the
past thirty?
The North Campus problem
was here before we arrived, and
the Cowles wrapping that went
on last Sunday at 4 a.m., and
other incidents of last weekend
(such as the breaking of East
morris‘ Window) seem to indicate upperclassmen really don‘t
give much of a damn what sort
of reputation the college receives.
The class of 1970 may well
end up living in a yellow subscribe, but upperclassmen —
if what I’ve seen is any example~are already submitted
in their own pride and department. — Frustrated Fmsh.

To the Editor:
R e c e n t student demonstraa

that this will be his third and
last year as faculty advisor to
the Senate. He began on an 6114
comparing note: “I would like to
begin by assuming you that the
decision to retain the Senate as
a legislative body or SGA was a
wise one.” Kurtz said he felt
that the Senate is deﬁlikely an
“appropriate arm oi sea."
In addressing the potential of
the Senate, KuI'tz set forth three
additions objectives.
He began by calling for “articnlate, management" dishes

that the Senate should serve to

groups. but'tz feels it is impop

discussion, the Senate must

that it is even legitimate for a

there is 21 need for such criticism. He said it is even more

He went on to praise the concept of the engagement.
Finally, it is crucial that the
Senate help to maintain the
tt‘edition of a “social co n.
science.” Kurtz mentioned the
possibility or projects in the
realm or social problems, rating mental health as one ex.
apple.
In line with Kurtz’s last suggestion, Phil Bertenthal, senator
from North counter and this
year's National Student Associas
tion coordinator, happen out
plans for specializing the role of
NSA on the Grinnell campus.
Bertenthal reported that there
are federal workshops grants
available from the government
for work in off-campus projects.
He mentioned Tama. the not.
toys area in Des points, and
work along the lines of Uncle
Sam's Club as several possibilities,
The prospect or getting obligations or foreign students to
visit Grinnell is another area in
which NSA could be helpful.
Bertenihal said,
In response to a proposal by
Bertenthal. the Senate passed a
resolution to form a committee
that will work with the NSA coordinator in developing ideas in
the realm of public affairs.
