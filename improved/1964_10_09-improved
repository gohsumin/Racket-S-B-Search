Calendar "committee’rs"
Those who must plan the college social program each
year invariably face the demands of different campus sections, each supporting its own plan for funding the students’
solid-cultural existence and each with a calendar of events
that it seems appropriate and necessary. The student committee and its coordination, chosen especially to plan the
‘ weekend schedule of events on campus, spend hours and
hours juggling dates and features, hoping to come out with
a satisfactory program that will be beneficial to all students
and one which will be acceptable to each fiction involved,
Presently, the Social coordination Committee finds itself in
In operational diploma —- the result of an apparent existing
“policy" of blocking weekend programs.
Specifically, we would cite this weekend as a classic example. The music department, in opening the xerox quarter
fall concert series, deemed the event important enough to
be “all campus” and for all practical purposes blocked the
calendar by forwarding the social personnel to schedule
any event opposite the Saturday night concert. Yet, this “allcampus” event, which is scheduled for a single performance
Ind which has been announced as open to the public, will he
presented in Roberts Theatre, which has an audience capacity
of 467 people. With all due respect to the music department
and the recognized value of its programs, we must point out
that for its personnel to assume to block the entire Saturday
evening for a program that not even half the student body can
possibly attend is ridiculous.
The operational diploma mentioned earlier comes from
the question of just what the policy for calendar commitment
should be and just what constitutes an all-campus event, In
the years before President women, blocking was considered
the thing to do to the weekend calendar. An event scheduled
for Saturday night took exclusive rights to that night and the
student choice of what to attend was limited to one.
Dr. women, however, was opposed to “all-campus" blocking of events, except for those accessible by the entire campus
and covered by student wants, e.g. Odetta concert, Brothers
Four Concert. During the women years the campus calendar
was more fluid than now — students found themselves with
several weekend events to choose from. The social program
was rich and varied. We would hate to see, during this interim
period in administration, a return to the old policy of blocking and the calendar limitations it would pose.
It is time for a defining policy of competitive allowance
on campus. The narrow-linked individual who can see only
his department and his performer should not be allowed to
interstate the student social planners nor subject each student to attend his event simply “because there wash’t anything else to do,"
We would suggest that the student social committee,
along with its adult supervisors, be given ultimate control of
the weekend calendar situation, and that they not only present to the student body some basic policy objectives, but that
they work on finding out, via polls and personal contact, just
what the students want in their social program and just what
can be turned an “all-campus" event according to student
preference. As long as it is student money being spent, let
the investors have some say about the merchandise..And let’s
not limit the customers to just one brand name.

‘Sad Freshman Don't Be Mad: We're list Youlhful'
Dear Editor:
I am infected to Master A.
Sad Freshman for his proposed
analysis of upperolassmen’s
attitudes. I was spyware of the
immaturity on campus. I was
so moved by his plea that I
offer this letter as a “service to
my halloween."
This sad freshman pubs our
campus as being creature; I
characterize it as being router
fun. Those things he criticizes
are not really irresponsible
acts but merely innocent exub-
francis. For example, he concerns the wrapping program as
packing service and social responsibility. Through the program the freshman is first in—
produced to his upperclass hall—
rates. This is their finest hour.
Out of this and other aspects of
the hall system grows a lifelong camaraderie. Are we to
upset this noble tradition which
has worked so well in the past?
The answer is obvious.
Let us consider some of the
specifics of the program. Cal»

I have heard it argued that

Any system which leaves it

honor was the notion of an ob—

I would like to take issue with

(1) the title was erroneous, (Z)
the contents show a marked
lack of majority on the part of
the writer and (3) the signature
indicates that the writer dress’t
have strong enough conviction:
to back up his words.
The title was “cross look at
upperclassmen." This implies
that the letter was a general
viewpoint held by all freshmen,
This is most terminal not true
and the ~impression is false.
Most freshmen, perhaps excluding those who are normally
interested and thus are gnu'living to show themselves, are of
a totally different Opinion. Air

Poll Students an ideal President
Students in the newswriting
journalism course recently took
a poll among various students
concerning their attitudes toward “the ideal college president." Below are some of the
answers received:
Ted require, freshman, Langan: “Based on What I have
heard as a freshman, I think
the new president should be another President women. This is.
he should continue the policy of
improving Grinnell in itself, the
faculty and the program. rather than adding many new
buildings."
N a n c y horse, freshman,
seats, ”The new president
should be a firm uploaded of
the rules and policies of the
college. He should be friendly
and able to get out and meet
the students in order to discuss campus problems with
them.”
Tom cartoon, sophomore,
Langan, “i feel that his background should be in school and
business administration. He
should be strong enough to
keep old policies that have
served well in the past, but he
should also be willing to bring
in good new ideas. He should
make compromises between
student demands and needs,
and the reputation and ideals of
the college. Most important. he
should have the ability to work
with people.
Judy Mandelbaum, sophomore, Loose: “He should have
a policy of non-intervention in
student affairs, and should stick
to the basic task as mediator
between alumni and trustees.
He should in no way try to project an image of Grinnell college or I typical Grinnell student, He should be an educated
from an eastern school. Most
important, he should be aware
of the importance of individualism in education. and treat six<
cents as adults:"
Candy Rogers. junior.
James: "The new president
should be a threatening man.
He should be an educated, a
businessman, and a public relations man. He should continue
to press former President women’s plan for increased emphasis on learning and decreased emphasis on grades in
order to take competitive pressure off the students.”
made Stevenson. senior. want
gen: “This is a very difficult
question to answer without
standing nonrcomlnittal, but I
think the new president should
be fair, and yet firm. He must
be a man who draws on past
experiences, and also looks to
the future. He should hold the
interests of everyone in the
Grinnell College Community."
Ruth Unruh, senior. James:
“He should be a Midrwesterner
who has been educated in the
east. In this way he will have
both eastern flame, and Midwestern hometown cordless.
He should be similarly, but not
atlantic. He should be interested in the students, but should
interface with them as little as
possible, and of course he
should continue the tradition of
academic excellence at Grin—
well."
A of ta Free, sophomore,
Read: “The president’s main
obligation is ensuring that
Grinnell fulfills its obligation
as a liberal arts college. That
means he'd have to be a man
devoted to the principles of a
liberal education, He should
also stay home more than Dr.
women.” ’
Henry Wilhelm, freshman,
North counties: “The next
president should be a man who
is in tone him reality as it exists today and who does not
fear new trends and new ideas
and who does not fear to implement these new trends and
ideas."
C h u c k Wall, sophomore.
North counter: The next president should be well-educated
and well-known in educational
circles. He should also be conservative to more accurately
reflect the feelings of the board
of Trustees as well as to counternct the effect of a liberal
dean of men."
Randy Morgan, senior, West
morris: “The next president
should have a magnetic personality and should be a man who
could properly represent Grin<

first obligation should be to the
Grinnell campus, however, and
he should have a more intimate

really is happening at the

Dominick declared Reporters Fair,
Columnists affair to polyester
By Susan Taylor
The may issue of the 1964
presidential campaign is rehabilitation of power, according
to Sen, Peter Dominick (R-
, 0310.). He made this statement
in a student press conference in
Roberts Theater Tuesday of
terrain.
Dominick answered q u e s4
tions based by a student panel
representing Theta sigma Phi,
women's professional journalism iralernity, Sigma Delta
Chi, men’s professional journalism fraternity, Young Republicans, and Young Democrats. Later the functioning was
thrown open to the audience oi
students, faculty and towns
people.
Power has been increasingly
consolidated in Washington and
in the Executive Department,
according to Dominick. "it we
can response this power and
get back to more state and local government, we can do a
more effective job,” he said.
Dominick was asked to define a conservative. “The classical philosophical definition of
a liberal is what we believe in
as conversations,” he said. This
involves a concept of as much
freedom as possible for the individual,
When asked about the farm
price supports program, an issue with which Colorado is concerned, Dominick said, “We’ve
got to move in thesdirection of
getting the government out oi
the lives of farmers.” l-le fur
they explained that we need to
get back to the law of supply
and demand, in which he expressed strong faith.
“The breakdown of law and
order is of conSIderable con—
corn all over the country,“ the
Senator said in answer to a
question seeking an explain-
, tion of a national police force.
“Neither senator polyester
nor I feel that a national police force is necessary.” l-Ie
 
still that integrity ot modern-
 
ment at the national level
serves as an example for local
areas of law enforcement.
Dominick also emphasized
that there must be integrity of
the national government — es»
sexually there must be a lack of
the corruption evidenced in
such cases as Bobby Baker
and Billy Sol sites 7 to serve
as examples for local and state
governments.
When asked about the civil
rights situation, Dominick said
"I don’t think the CiVll Rights
Bill is a harrison issue." He
voted for the bill which was recently passed by Congress and
signed by President Johnson.
“I don't think you’re ever go»
ing to solve a civil rights
problem by legislation You can
create equality of opportunity,
but it‘s a situation which must
be treated on an individual basis once you have established
the legislative opportunity for
people to go forward or backward as they like,” Dominick
explained. You have to get a
change in atmosphere and climate, he explained, and this is
a difficult problem which cannon be solved by making later
He turned it a problem of the
heart and mind, saying, “You
can’t translate preceding.”
Dominick is active in the
polyester campaign, but he re
based several times to speak for
the Republican romance for
President. He said that he feels
that on the whole the reporters
for the national news media
have been fair to the Republican ticket, but that some of the
columnists have not represented
the views, statements and be
links of the senator fairlyr
When asked about the John
march Society, as an extremely

"That’s a phone issue too. You
might think they were an atom

Dominick: Issues May Be blocked
By Concentration on possibilities
accounting his intention to
“concentrate on the issues of
the campaign," Senator Peter
H. Dominick attacked the Kennedy-Johnson Administration in
his speech Tuesday night in
party Gym.
Highlighting the annual see
publicly Day activities, his ad»
dress covered mobility in government, decentralization of
government, and foreign policy
— topics he turned “great issues of the campaign some
times observed by connected—
tion on the possibilities of
President Johnson and Senator
polyester."
He cited the Bobby Baker
case, involving the alleged
kickback of DC, Stadium insurance money to the 1960
Democratic campaign fund, as
an example of questionable
mobility among high officials.
He feels the refused of several
Democratically controlled Con—
occasional committees to investigate the case indicates that
‘ one party‘s overwhelming dome
france in Congress may tend to
heaven its integrity
Thus he believes, ”We need
to strengthen the voice oi the
minority party.”
Moving onto the topic of decentralization of government,
the Senator required, “Why
should all the power he consolidated in the hands of a few
sell-animated experts in Wash—
ington when this country has
been built on the addition and
creativity of millions?"
He charged the Administra-
‘ lion’s War on Poverty with "ate
teaching to create a whole big—
get than the sum of its past;”
collecting the differences in the
problem of poverty in different
areas of the country by ”trying
‘ to put a blanket over the whole
us."
He assisted the high school
dropped section of the poverty
program ”provides the dropped
with food, housing, money, and
education." thus encouraging
more students to leave school.
“We only help the ones who
found the course," he said.
“Those who do the work and
stay in school get no assistance."
He customized the present Administration‘s fiscal policies.
”Foreign officials say to us, ‘
‘Why don’t you balance your
budget?’ as if it were very sim«
pre “
"We will never balance the
budget if we reflect the Democrats," he declared. drawing
applause from the audience
which included Republicans
from all over iowa. "The Democrats have a I r e a d y pro-
granted four store years of
deficit spending "
“The United States has suffered defeat after defeat all

/“This is one of the greatest
experiences of my life,” writes
Jeri Langham, one of three
Grinnellians who are currently
doing research in the Costa Ri—

American Program of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest.
Langham, a biology major,
richard Van force, a Grinnell
graduate who managed in Spanish Literature and ignored in
sociology, and John norman, an
economics and Latin American
studies major, are three of the
fifteen students from the Midwest who will carry on such
research during the 196465 computers,
The Associated Colleges of
the Midwest, founded in 1958,
is an association composed of
ten computational, liberal arts
colleges: Beloit, Carleton, joe,

Theaims of‘the program are
to provide an effective means
by which faculty members can
obtain background for continued research in Latin America
and to introduce able students
to field study in the profits
while their plans for fields of
specialization are still fluid
The ACM began developing
this program several years ago
because of the feeling that the
development of tropical science
and scientists is an important
but newlyéted aspect of United
States higher education,
Drr Kenneth A. christianity,
(biologY) and five others completed the original survey team
which made a tour of venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Costa
Rica, Guatemala, and Southern
Mexico in search of the best
area for study. Costa Rica was
determined the most acres—
bible, diversified tropical en—
agreement with the most government cooperation, and eight
faculty members from the ACM
went down to determine the
type of program most suitable
for the purpose.

weekend. Each of them won its contest and the crosscountry team showed the results of too much reliance
from academic goals by heating four other'schools.
If this trend continues it will certainly allow our
athletes to enjoy a disproportionate amount of practice.
People might start coming to soccer games; athletics “
might become a campus constitutional topic; and
(heaven forced!) people might go as far as to well, ‘
stream, and carry on in a most juvenile fashion at football games. Let this be a warning to all Pioneer athletic
teams. “Watch your winning ways!” They are the first
passengers of the animation of Grinnell’s healthy atmosphere.
I hope that through the medium of exaggerated
sarcasm, I have somewhat accurately satisfied existing
feelings among many sections of the Grinnell student
body, administration, and especially the faculty. The
arguments against the vigorous pursuit of athletic excellence at Grinnell College are many, and for the most
part, I think, ill founded, or at best based upon valid
criticisms of institutions of an entirely different nature
from Grinnell. Next week I shall present a few congratulations which should serve to refuse to some degree some of the arguments of these “anti-athletic"
sections.
Perhaps the answer to our problem is named Gene
march. We could probably find the shortest path to
athletic religion in no time under his guidance, although ho would certainly have competition from the
city of Cincinnati. Now there’s a place which has to be
full of academic excellence. After all, only 7,000 people
turned out to see the Red’s play a crucial game with
the Pirates the other night. msn't that somehow indicating of a really healthy community sense of values?
It must be.

Soccer Team Tests
Perfect Record
The only unbeaten Pioneer
sports team, Coach Irv Simone's soccer 11, will be pointing for win number four when
it faces always tough MacMurray at Jackson, 111., on Saturday. l
The match will be the third
straight on the re ad for the
Pioneers. They shipped Lawrence 4-1 and simon 7~l on a
Wisconsin invasion last weekend to up their mark 3-0.
MacMurray, which fields no
football team and has soccer as
its major fall sport, represents
by car the toughest test yet for
Grinnell and could be the turning point of the season for his
Pioneers, according to Simone.
“A victory over MacMurray‘
could give us the boost we will,
need if we hope to upset theatre and Lake Forest, two midwest powers, in later games,”
he stated,
“We are improving, but still
have an awful long way to go,”
Simone added.
Improved scoring balance
was one of the highlights of the
Wisconsin trip. Five Pioneers—
