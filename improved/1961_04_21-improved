lucky seller Finds Ceylon's Religions
Complex, Almost lhcomprehensiblc
by rebecca center
Throughout. these past months.
i have become increasingly aware
at the prominent place religion
ha in the East, The dominant red u in Ceylon is Buddhtsm. But
this Buddhism isiniiltratcd with
Hinduism and a kind oi paradise
until it appears so vast and come
alex as to be incomprehensible
to the Western mind.
Recently i went on a trip to the
ancient cities of Ceylon, Betcre
we entered the general area of
these rules. the driver of our car,
a Buddhist, stopped by a spring
at the side of the road. The spring
ivas a digital structure; tiny, dir-,
ty and reflected. The driver got
out of the car and searched the
wishes along the road—side. iii‘ide
ing the right bush, he picked a‘
branch and hung it on a wooden
rack next to the spring. He then
bought a coconut from a nearby
stand,
He placed the coconut on a
that stone in front of the spring
and listed his hands in prayer.
He then picked up the coconut
and turned it on the stone, breaks
ing it open. He brought a piece
of coconut to each occupied of
the car. We all recently ate our
piece. although none of us had
any idea of the significance of
this ceremony. When we left the
ancient cities this same visual
was performed.
Our driver later explained to l
us that when we entered the
cities we had, as he put it,
“ieit my own country." To pro. .
text himself and everyone with
him, he had to perform this .
visual on leaving and entering .
the “foreign territory."
i asked a Buddhist friend oi
mine about this and he explained
that many people believe Ceylon
is divided into different regional
each having its own special gods
or gods. When a man leaves his,
own region, he must pay tribute
to the god of the territory he is
entering or harm will behalf him,‘
There is a popular religious
ceremony performed in Ceylon
called a perahera. As definitely
as i can describe it, it is a re—l
various parade which takes place
on a full moon night and involv s
carrying the relay of any martin
car temple through the streets.
The full moon day and night at
every month is a special time oi
worship for Buddhists and is
called Poya .
Near every Buddhist temple .
is a structure shaped like a l
bell and handle. This is called
a dakota, and it houses relief, .
usually that of Buddha himself. ‘
These structures are usually
rather large. There is no open- i
ing into the interior. inside the
temple is a small replica ot' the
dakota containing mart: relief.
This is what is carried through
the streets in the pcrahera.
Not long ago, i had the epson
