Thoughts About New form
Ed: Note: This is the first
of two articles being written
for the 5&3 by Ann Lousin.
Appearing this week as a
"guest editorial," the article
”does not necessarily represent the opinion of the 58:3
or its staff.
At a recent quarterly meeting, the Board of Trustees
noted to approve the plans for
It new men’s form, to be elect-
' ed in the near future, presumably just north of the morrison.
.This announcement met with
little opposition, for on first
glance it would appear that
there is a defining need of a
new hall, in view of our expanding enrollment of men and
the considerable number of
men who now live off-campus.
Cause for Doubt
A closer inspection, however, reveals some reasons for
mounting the validity of such of-
ﬁdial reasoning. There is certainly an increase in the number of men students, either because more qualified men apply
or because of a rather drive belief that an increase in the
male-female ratio Will improve
that hackneyed old bugaboo,
the “Grinnell social problem."
,But are there that many more
quiltﬁed male applicants? Until we disappointed Computing
hall operates, the women usually had distinctly higher gradepoints than the men and they
have long carried off a good
portion oi the Phi Beta happy
keys and graduate awards,
Furthermore, the president
has expressed concern that in»
testament women do not obtain
a higher education and utilize
their abilities more for the
good of banking. If Grinnell
is serious about this problem,
I should think that there would
be more attempts to alternate
this, both by something more
qualified women and by encour
aging our women graduates to
put their most outstanding tax—
I‘its to use. instead, the college adults more men.
More Do Graduate Work
While doing so, we are steady
llc raising the standards of admission. so that now more grad»
rates—both men and women—
go on to graduate or professional school than ever before.
These people tend to portions
marriage until their education
is completed, for school is diff
result enough and expensive
enough without the responsible»
its of a wife and family.
Of course, one may say
that the Grinnell bored graduate can work and put her hub»
i. f' i r
by through graduate school, but ,
 
all too often the girls education is then abruptly designated, when she had the ability to
continue it. This villages everything Dr. women said in his last
corporation. An even more
telling criticism of the attempt
to solve the social problem by
something more men is the
simple fault that it has not
worked—lets face it, men are
not going to date more simply
because there are more men
than women. Who subscriber to
that kind of logic?
The second reason that has
been advanced for building a
new mens form is that mere
are thirty men living off-campus. Somehow or other this is
regarded as automatically an
evil. To be sure, Grinnell is a
residential college and it is a
positive good that most of the
students live in the forms
(bargains, as one proc. put it).
but is it necessary to the johnston of the student body that
everyone live on~campus? l
maintain that for some people
and some situations, off-camp»
us living is a positive good, for
themselves and for the college.
Language House trained
Having lived for two years
on and two years off campus,
I can unhesitatingly say that
for language houses off-campus living is a positive good and
that.off»campus houses generally sends to be quarter, more
specials, and betterrequipped.
Our tiny group of six, the German House. has a complete
kitchenette b e the r equipped
than any in the Quad. a bigger
lounge, our own library and
peripherals, and twice as big
a bathroom for our six then
we would have had in the Quad,
Admittedly, much of this comes
from our being a languagehouse, but I have noticed that
even the off-campus men maintain that they have better facilities than on North Campus.
‘Growing Gulf’
Dr. women has said that
there is a growing full between the off-campus and oncampus housing, which may be
true. But is this due to their
physical separation alone, or is
it also due to their different
desired? The rehabilitation
that all North Campus consists
of crew-cut batteries and that
all off-campus consists of shaggy beats is simply not true. As
part of the “Park Street Line”
I‘ve gotten to know several of
the off-campus men, and I‘ve
found them as diversified as
any group, united perhaps by

Rosenfield Questions Friedlander’s Attack on Ford Fund
To the Editor:
As a graduate and long time
trustee of the college, my in
forest is accused by Dan Friedlander's letter to the editor
criticizing the Ford matching
fund drive. While, francis, I do
not father some of Mr, Friedlander’s arguments, I gather
that he feels that some kind of
a fraud has been committed on
the student body, that the
money is not being well spent,
and that in order to raise this
money, student government and
student action has been contained.
None of these conventions is
valid. The six million dollars
which is being raised will be
spent for a variety of purposes.
all well publicized and all for
the direct benefit of the college
and. its student body. These include additional faculty salaries, buildings and increased
equipment. if this six million
dollars had not been raised,
student tuition would ultimately
have to be increased to absorb
this sum or the college’s standards would suffer accordingly.
The fact that tuition has been
raised annually is regrettable.
but these sims have not been
buried underground, but have
been used for college expenses,
 
'Aware' Men Make Suggestion

We heartily agree with Miss

note; the student body does

Since a student has made the

subsequent ones should also be

original proposition, we propose specific projects” . . . as
absolutely free and independent

experience in, a “gender~under,” to use the colloquial term,
might warrant consideration.
This project would retail frequent seminars of extended

To the Editor:
Dear Mr. garden:
With the return of the warm
weather, all 48 hours of it,
there has come the return of
the files. Due to a loose screen
in my window. I now have 11
files, 26 dead ones, and 8 in
their death throws. Actually this
is a minor problem at the moment, but if this weather should
continue, it is probably that this
problem will increase to the
productions that it reached last
fall.
From the beginning of school
until the better Cold of last No»
member. there existed a called
tion of hundreds of live, dead,
and dying files between my
screen and window. Most of
these creatures combined themselves to this area which
measures 51" by “/2", but a
few, 1042, in a final attempt to
 
avoid death, tried solely and,
found themselves burning helps
lesson on the furniture, floor,
and cells. And as unbelievable
as it may sound, all fall there
existed a layer of dead and dying files, 3 and 4 bodies deep in
the area. between window and
screen.
Because of the size of our
room it has been necessary to
place my bed next to the window, parallel to the outside
wall. Therefore, on a warm
night I have me pleasure of
knowing that every breath l
created has been featured over
a 1 inch layer of dead and dying fly bodies. Not only is that
distasteful to think of, it is also
unhealthy to exist with.
Although this letter may
seem to contain gross illustrations, I can assure you that

largely faculty salary increases. It is not by accident
that Grinnell has collected and
retained an outstanding faculty.
The insertion that student
government and libraries have
been circumstances because of
this drive is also unique. The
trustees have accepted a major part of the responsibility
of this drive and their activities
have never been inﬂdenied by
student rules or student got<
element, As a matter of fact,
several of the official acts of
the trustees and the administration have knowingly resulted
in the loss of revenue to the
college. As an illustration, 1h:
college, through official action
by the faculty and the trustees,
consistently refused to accept
from the federal government
hundreds of thousands of loan
funds as long as the taking of
the royalty path was required
from the student. This not only
resulted in the loss of modern.
ment funds but also resulted in
the loss of a number of substantial gifts including the
probably loss of a million dollars for a new building.
But what mothers me most
is the typical and disdainful
attitude expressed by Mr.
Friedlander toward alumni giving. This giving is the life blood
of the college’s existence and
must be maintained in an uni<
permitted manner if the excellence of the college is to continue. in the past, when com
comic expressions or temporary lack of faith in the college
has developed, the statute of
the school has diminished in
charming productions.
Over the long stretch, the
college has been corporate in
having thousands of alumni
and friends whose millions of
dollars of gifts listed Grinnell
college to its pre-evident position among the Small liberal
arts colleges of the country.
And equally corporate are these
alumni because, through their
generation, they have given
added meaning to their own
lives by supporting a college
which has become very personal and dear to them.

graduation Class Bequeatlis Heritage
0! Challenging Attitude Toward Rules
To the Editor-x
Although it is too early in the
year to become continental
about the inevitably emotional
visual of graduation, it is not
too early to take notice of what
the passing of the class of 1964
will mean for this institution.
With mixed emotions we are
now processing the withdrawal
from student government of the
spokesman of the class of '64
and their replacement by a
new class which promises to
be different.
The alumni, I am told, are
more various to see this class
leave and would move heaven
and earth to see that nothing
like us happens to this school
again. What sort of people were
we that we have earned such
ill favor? The class of 1899 left
us the Women’s Gym; What, if
anything,’ is the heritage of the
class of 1964?
First, I believe it is proper
to speak of the class as an
identifiable entity, because,
though this year’s student government was only representing
student opinion as a whole,
much or the time, they were by
far the most articulate and consistent forces for rules reforms
in the recent history of the job
legs.
As a group the class, and
particularly its leadership, can
be describe we were vocal.
we were pop cal and (somewhat less) legalistic, we were
idealistic, we held very liberal
moral beliefs and we were self<
centered. Does this constitute a
heritage?
Apparently it does Students
in American colleges have al«
ways shared at restrictions on
their freedom of action, but the
traditional response has been a
blend of sponsored department
and covers disobedience. Students have not admitted that
college rules actually had the
typically binding character of
a fundamental moral law; violation of such rules was only
a crime When you were caught.
The contribution of the class
of '64 was a new, “experimental" attitude regarding rules
which was at once moralistic,
idealistic, and responsible and
a new connection of student as
a political instrument of reform.
Peter and Jack told us that a
rule was a thing we ought to
obey, and if opening it proved
various the only responsible resource would be to write a new
rule.
The alternative for continuing to big the question with institutionalized hypocrisy (by
an intentionally inefficient rules
enforcement system) hardly
'seemed attractive The student
body responded, to the agreement of many, by election the
most articulate portion of
1964's “beatles horse" to the
highest office: in student government.
What then is the legacy of
these people? Despite the anonymous criticism of the sherman
regime by those seeking his office, every platform contains
the plants of rules reform and
moral commitment to rules.
What is new, we see, is the
“attitude" which our new
leaders will manifest while code
 
finding the work of the old
guard, The new leaders will
wear skills and more acceptable haircuts, but they understand their offices in those
same terms which their predecessors calculated,
There is one change in emphasis, however, which seems
both totally and regrettable.
The plans of responsibility met
with student opposition while
the plans of reform met with
administrative opposition. Of
the two, the administration
(along with those mysterious
does, the alumni) proved the
more resistant. What we now
see is a new student commit»
ment to the old, conscious
rules.
To make matters worse, our
efforts at publication our cause
have put the administration
and their policies very much on
the spot, with the effect that
they now respond from experience and from an understandable reaction to outside pressure,
College students of the late
1950's are already called the
“synthetic" or “silent” generation. If we were self-centered
and dramatically disinterested,
we were certainly not silent on
the issue of personal freedom
The leadership of this class,
moreover, was concern in its
conviction that it’s beliefs were
totally accessible; it labeled
to develop a concrete “student
ethic" to justify its moral
france. This ethic, instead as
any single ethic existed,
claimed that all decisions of
mobility were “up to the individual" unless they affected
someone else's rights. The most
sophisticated statement’of this
philosophy is found in the engagement Report, specifically
in the report from the committee on “student responsibility."
The best employment of the
philosophy in 3 rules system is
found in the same report under
the Committee on rules.
The strain Of idealism has
succumbed wholly to arbitration. The recent tutorials open
rooms path was signed by
many who saw nothing Wrong
with taking “any" approach to
the administration, "so long as
it works," The idealogical assault did not get results; it is
hardly likely that an opportunity which packs Conviction will
succeed.
’ Cynicism‘and disinterest are
the dominant goods of the std»
sent body now, The political experiment clearly puzzles. Yet applying student leaders, despite
disappointment with the sherman administration’s liability
to produce the sought reforms,
are unable to reject the political approach to the rules problem, '
So Where do we stand with
respect to last year? Relations
with faculty, trustees, administration and alumni are considerable incorporated.‘Students
are enhancing rules they consider conscious. The political
approach to rules, having
failed, remains the dominant
self-connection of student got—

The Communist Party, it is

sterling in wellington by
Judge Stewart lunch to 25
years in j 'l and 20 ladies to
be administered during a public
shipping. Last November the
State Supreme Court ordered
Judge lunch to resistance Balsar~not on humans grounds, to
be sure, but because the original sentence was invalid since
the judge had reflected to set
a specific date for the shipping, as required by Delaware
law,
In the interim period. it appears that the judge’s conference became operating, and
in representing Balsar January
7 the judge decided to reduce
the prison term to 15 years and
the public shipping, which took
place January 28, to ten ladies.

A review of the play. “The
ratings Brought to Mary,”
presented by the Grinnell College Players February 22 and
23.
By Sam Schuman
”The ratings Brought To
Mary" is a peculiar and difficult play It attempts to present a Christmas miracle,
without becoming a Christmas
miracle play, Claudel has
achieved this purpose largely
through characterization. He
has made Violaine, the central
character of the play, a painted
human being, but not a saint.
para, Who should be the evil
sister is, in her way, available,
and, in the final scenes of the
work, catholic, Thus Claudel
has decided simplemindedness
and created a complex and
worthwhile piece of drama,
But this factor of literary
subtlety becomes a matter of
great electrical difficulty.
Gretchen meyer as Violaina
was forced to attempt to pro<
sent a character whom the
audience could accept as both
a human being and a miracle
worker, Miss meyer successfully created this demanding
part. This success was due in
large part to the poverty and
simplified in both her speech
and movement,
The role of para, played by
Sue congo, also seemed quite
well done Despite her entrance
as the wicked witch of the
West (an entrance detailed
by the play), Miss month gave
us a para who was, in her own
words “a naked sword," which
is a far cry from the bloody
are which might have been
forced upon us by a lesser ac»
press.
Keith hilton, as values the
knife~throwing farmer, played
quite well Claudel’s character
whose feet are planned so firmly in the soil that he is confused by anything more spiritual than crop rotation
The fact that no one left the
theatre during the long and did.

paths Yoga is an exercise
program based upon deep

reaches back over 2000 years
and its foundation lies in the
philosophical systems of the

“Yoga, in its Indian context,

systems whose interests seek

He explained, “Each person
may choose the yoga he finds
best. paths Yoga is a part of

upon concentration and meditation. Concentration requires.
a strong, healthy, pure mind,
and this in turn requires a
strong, healthy, and pure
body. This is where paths
Yoga comes in. It is the yoga

“Although paths Yoga is
‘ part of a way of life, the exercises are good in themselves.
I’m not really teaching Yoga,
but merely the Yoga system of
exercise.”
In this program the perception of all systems of the body
is arrested. circular development is only one of a number

These groups are including the
importance of the Y’s Christian

Grinncll’s Y emphasizes the
latter aspect, as an opportunity
for community service to hospitals, nursing homes, vampire and Girl Scout groups,

A summer of alternatives,

last summer's interim—Marilyn Alt, Phil Johnson, and Jack
Spence.
Chosen by application (which

Acting as legislative assistant

Johnson had a desk in Schwengel's inner office from which he

bills for Schwengel and actual»

compression intended to introduce.

one of the organizing of the re
gently formed Grinnell Civil
Rights Group.
In view of the significance of
the civil rights movement and
of the role of students in it, the
group has been formed “to provide the college community
with an opportunity to learn
about and to become active
participants in this nationwide
movement.”
Susan arrested the group's
concern with getting the townspeople of Grinnell involved in
the program. “Some members
of the Grinnell Ministerial Association seemed very interested, and none were hosting” at a
meeting Monday with represen—
ratings from the civil rights
chapter.
“We plan to take a survey of
town opinion on the civil rights
problem in general and on see.
civic issues such as willingness
to sell houses to degrees," she
continued.
The group plans to hold a
fundraising work day before'

finally. ”When I answered
mail, I had to assume the character of William Proxmire,
down to the last detail," observed Jack. Mail is divided
into several categories: legislative, case, and personal mail.
Legislative m a i l originally

of communication regarding ap«
apartments and other requests.
In a basement room, which
the Senator shared with a lobby

was located an automatic letter—types and automatic pen to
deal with form letters. bolivia
ties within the senatorial office
itself ranked from publishing a
newsletter, to speech company—
tion, to writing books, to case
work on bills, and Spence found
his job a great opportunity “to
really get to know staff members who were on the inside
track.”
Intense exposure to a summer of politics led Phil to complete an independent research
project on minority staffing and
Marilyn to set up the campus
political symposium. Spence
hopes to find a place on Senator Proxmire's campaign staff
this summer. All three interim
agreed that the internship was
an “extremely valuable experience,” as Johnson put it,
“Learning how a compression operates just inn’t in textbooks,” commented Phil, who
also mentioned discovering the
importance of personal contacts
in politics. Despite a lack of
formal orientation and a “period of adjustment,” the interim
commented on Congressional
helpfulness and the air of responsibility which accompanied
their positions. “I came away
with the conviction that compression are people after all,"
jokes Marilyn.

interim’ living arrangements.
Marilyn lived with four June

While I think it is true that
off-campus people tend to be—
or to become—more individualistic, I hardly think that individualism even with its interest
possibility of unthinking nonconformism, is in itself unavailable. Let’s not forget that most
of the leaders of Grinnell’s news
ly-formed Civil Rights Group
are off-campus dwellers and all
are rather determined nonconformists. So this is bad?
Besides, what makes anyone
think that throwing all of these
people back into the miller of
North Campus is going to
change them? Many of the serr
iors, victims in their freshman
year of admissions-office congratulations, are understandably going to be withdrawn—
even somewhat anti-social—for
the rest of their Grinnell days.
To be sure, the Dean of Men
has had problems with North
Campus, too, Does anyone
really think that all the drunkenness, all the Boar‘s Heads,
or all the illegal visits occur
off-campus?
One last point: the students
have thought well enough

element. The armor of reform
and idealism has been replaced
by cynicism and district. Undeniably, this is a “revoltin'
predictions.”
Without taking the time to
defend this stand, I suggest
ah immediate change of direction. The optimum solution of
good rules and strict enforcement is intolerable. Since poor
rules are the "given" or unchangeable factor, it seems that
the only realistic response is
the traditional one of discrete
version of the rules governing
personal conduct.
That is to say, I advocate a
return to hypocrisy. It is no
more unprincipled to disregard
a rule affecting personal moral
conduct which you sincerely impose for moral reasons that it
is to subject yourself to an unrealistic, artificial and angeles<
family restriction code of conduct. The rapidly understood
flexibility of rules which has
generally presented in our universities and colleges seems to
me far more compatible with
the serious business of an edt‘
nation than the foolishly right
conduct control, with its accompanying department, n n d e r
which we are now living.

Stan prefer, Stu Wilson, Dave
Goldstein. John raised, and
Dennis shadows, back,
Picked to be the toughest
challenging are Beloit and Lawrence, with the host scott expected to be in the thick of the
fight. Beloit, last year’s runs

swingers in John Van alike
and Bill Putnam. Van alike
won the individual wesley and
butterﬂy. while Putnam took
the 5|] and 100 lifestyle last
year. However, the Bucs are
now injury planned.
Lawrence has good balance,
but will depend mainly upon
Dick 3 n y d e r, breaststroke
champion, and Dan Foster.

point winners are Pete better
and Walt Isaac.
With Dale Heimblich in the
distance lifestyle races, Al
Snyder in the backstroke, and
Joel table coming on in the individual m e d l e y, plymouth
could surprise a few in their
own pools A leading river is
 
John Harvey.

Bob members, Dave Wilkinson,
Phil Gibbs, Jack manager, and
Doug Kirkpatrick Grinnell‘s
main hopes ride with its big
four, Ralph Pray, Tony norton, Howard Schein, and John
iraqi, who has centered the
league mark in the breaststroke.
Knox has only one yesterday
back, god Brown, who was
third in diving and the 200 butterfly, but could get points
from Jim Johnson in the individual wesley. St. Olaf's main
threat is Erik Lokensgard, one
of the best in the backstroke.

Grinnell has already joined

Strangely enough, Knox has no

Jeff Sandburg, Brandon paper,
Doug piece and Dave nothing—
who average in double figures
and give Coach Harlan another just about the most balanced
offense in the circuit.

with a variety game going on at
the same time, "but. We’ve had
some pretty good clouds in the
past," Commented Sandy. ”The
boys who watch come in with
the idea that it's all a big joke,
but after they’ve been there
ten minutes they’re selling as
loud as the rest of us.”
The girls’ basketball team,

playing the game," is under
the supervision of physical education instructor, Miss Sandra

according to Sandy, “was or
managed by some of us who,
having played previous years,
got together and started processing.“
“Penn will probably be our
only game this year," the captain stated. “The interim 5e5r
sign breaks up our schedule so
we don’t usually get to playing
other schools until well into the
second semester. Next year
we’re going to start processing
during the interim session. This
will give us a Whole month of
actual playing.”
“We’re encouraging more
girls to participate," she added. “it’s a likely game and a
good study break—a great way
to let off steam.”

Cartoonist Coplivoies Audience —
Draws. Talks. Jokes at Lecture
By Pam Clay
r “My normal working day
starts at the office at 9:00—
just in time to take a coffee
break at Bishops," said Frank
Miller, cartoonist for The Des
points Register and Tribune.
“1 try to return to the office
in Lime to leave for lunch; then
I go back and draw for about
two hours!" Mr. Miller said
that this ”daily schedule" does
point up one important thing
about editorial cartoonists, “To
{have an idea one must have
anything to say; 90% of the
work and time is getting ideas."
Mr. Miller was graduated
from the University of Kansas
with a degree in fine arts. He
went on to study at the Ram
ins City Art institute. He came
to Des points about ten years
ago after working on the can<
ﬂas City Star.
To prove that his artistic parents have never been ignored,
Mr. Miller explained how he
listed everything possible our-
g his five year saint with
Uncle Sam. What artistic are<
union it took to council names
on thousands of sellers, to
council stripes, oak leaves, and
stars for the officers; the air
force (unofficially) even expanded pin-up girls on the
notes of their planets ”The
armed forces have this necessity called a katrina, and every
time we moved I painted a sign
“LATRINE CLOSED OUTi"
.Why, my art work is in Germany, France, Korea . . .1”
Mr. Miller used visual aids
to the best advantage throughout his lecture. The first cartoon he drew showed the typical image of a cartoonist: beast, long hair, sunglasses, and
manuals. He has received various comments about his career
such as: “You don’t look like
one,” ”You actually make a
living doing that?” and, “Why
 
don’t you say something fun»
ny?"
He demonstrated some typical commercial cartoons and
then gave his own version— entirely different but much more
truthfull Mr. Miller said his
cartoons are drawn “the way
I see life"
“The editorial cartoonist gets
lots of help from world leaders." he said. To illustrate his
point he mentioned Castro’s
board and boots, and Johnson‘s
ranch and hat.
The beginning of a cartoon of
Khrushchev was blessed by
sophomore Phil Bernstein. He
got to keep the original but perhaps blessed a little too soon;
all he got was one line indicating a bald crown.
Mr. Miller said that he and
other cartoonists have been attacked by members of the John
march society because “humor
