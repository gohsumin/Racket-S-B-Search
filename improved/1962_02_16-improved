Academicdeiachmeniimplies social responding lily
by Mikc forward
This article is the sccoiid iii a
series on the responsibility ot'
the academic community to the
“outside" world.
Last week it was argued that
a social‘l's capacity to survive
tests upon its ability to accomr
modatc changing conditions. One
of the ways in which societies
‘ enable themselves to change is
through social criticism.
The process or- social change.
it was continued, is complicated
by the fact that societies are
resistant to Cast,off absolute
means for achieving their ultimate ends. .
The major reason for this
resistance is that various individuals and groups within societies have states in the status
que and are fear-but of the con—
sequences of change. For example, as modern specialists began
to threaded the position of aristccracies, aristocratic choose ate
related to half the growth 0!
industrialism by presenting in»
situations incompatablc with
authorization.
Our values. beliefs and opinions about social problems
arc determined b_ a complex
at economic, sociological and
physical factors. swing to this
fact, the chi ty of our per»
section diminishcs as our involvement and commitment
inn-cases. As a result. the
probability of our being “0hr
section” is reduced.
When wc find ourselves involved in social problems, when
otir values, beliefs and interests
comic into conflict with operating values, beliefs and interests,
Olll' sentence is to be defensive
side” World.
 
rauicr than open linked. Just
as wc judge others more herself than we judge ourselves, wc
arc tar more sensitive to the
“adults” of the opposition than
we are to our Own.
As a case in point, wc see insurance in the actions of other
nations more readily than we see
them in our own. When the
reviews compressed the revolution
in Hungary, we judges the ac—
tion evil, When the United States
attempted to supplies revolution in Cuba, we saw an act_of
consciousness.
It all books down to this:
truth becomes that which rec
cniorces our own values and
beliefs. household is that which
contractors them. It thus stands
to reason that the perspective
or various economic, social. and
political groups is limited. In.
need, as the members at these
groups become committed,
they act to limit themselves.
They read only magazines and
newspapers with which they
agree, listen to compensation
whose views are compatible
with their own.
One problem of a society is
to want to find reliable inforilla»
tion about relevant social problems upon ,which to form judy—
meets — information which .
not “propaganda". Anothc- is to
be able to find reliable inner—
nation.
This means that reliable write
its must be discovered and their
work must be accessible to the
general public. By “reliable information", I mean material
which is not produced to sun-'
port the position of a particular
group, btit iatnci to capture act
quality. Such information is more
likely to come from the academic
community than from any
other sector oi the society.
The ocadcmician is less likely to be printed by economic
and political self-interest than
is, for instance, the business
man. the labor leader or the
public topic broken His ulti—
mate value is more likely to be
the good oi the whole rather
than the good or a particular
group. His perspective sends to
he broader because he is ex»
based to a wider games oi opiu—_
sons and either sources of in” formation. In a word, he is
much more likely to see the
wellness in labor's position
than labor is. no is also much
more likely to see the strength
at their position than management is.
swing to his relatively greater “attachment," he is more
likely to portion the real conflict. Often opposite groups
touch their power conflicts in
moral terms. Less restricted by
economic and political factors,
the acadciniciaii is both in a better position to see the real’proc—
let and set iortli his findings.
In View of the academic ch»
money's unique vintage point,
and in light of the present sit—
nation in which the consequences
of public policy are so great, the
academic community has a re—
sponsibility to participate both
directly and indirectly in the
formation of public policy. One
or the ways it can do this is 1::
deal with permanent. social proc—
less and attempt to make its
findings available to the "out
 
and justice are the foundations
oi our society. without them
there would bo,clicks and tlltia
mainly the destruction or our
system. The Abel—Powers ex
change has caused a large
think in this foundation, which
is now being obtained to the
breaking point.
