the Washington Post at 20,000,

Off-Campus Living for Meni
Conference House to Be Open
“Otircampus housing will be
available next year to is men students in 1205 Park Street (Conference House) and to a number of
men who may obtain approved
rental housing in town.” This
statement was made by Dean of
Men 5. Eugene Thompson Wednesday.
North campus room drawings
have been contained until May 3
to provide an opportunity for
gathering more "exact information
on total enrollment. Final enrollment figures will determine how
many students will be able to
rent rooms in town,
All men will draw for rooms on
north campus, but those interested
in offrcampus housing should fill
out an application (available at
the ofﬁce of the dean of men)
Applications should be returned to
the dean of men by noon on Tuesday, April 27.
Thompson noted that the total
 
number of men living outside the
permanent residence calls will not
actually be increased. However,
since there will be fewer married
students and students whose homes
are in town, the number of men air
lower to obtain rooms in town may
increase. ,

Jean M. Slocum, dean of women,
announced tells week that there
will be no Spanish or French
floors or houses in the women’s

The talk banners were organized
in the fall of 1963 and have now
expanded to about forty members

group is the fact that dancing can
be used for gym credit.

group, has been instrumental in
teaching and organizing the Grinnell dancersi This year she has
worked with president Jean Watson, secretary Eva Gardebring and

welcome as new cancer are are
ways being taught.
Although last year the group

christianity Debunks Race Concept 1
As sustainable, Scientifically topless
“If there’s such a thing as racial
supervision, we’d better be quiet
about it and hope nobody ﬁads
out.” With that statement Kenneth
christianity (biology) closed his
informal remarks at Tuesday
night's dinnerrdiscussion about biological galleries behind discrimination.
The talk was followed by dishes
sign with Ronald Kurtz (anthropologY) and was part of a series
on "Understanding the Race Problem," sponsored by the Board of
Religion,
christianity’s final remark followed a listing of possible characteristics upon which a theory of
racial supervision might be based.
On each characteristic presented
(resistance to disease, tolerance to
temperature extremes, etc), investigation has suggested that ei—
they the Mongoloid or detroit racial groups are better “bit” than
Caucasoid.
 
christianity explained briefly
 
the nature of the populations which
are generally considered “racial
groups," though he also explained
that he considers the concept of
"race" as too sustainable to be scientifically useful, He and Kurt:
agreed that the threesome concept is particularly unhelpful.
Racial or ”substances” groups
are smaller divisions of a species
(a shopping whose members naturally interested with one another)
Racial characteristics are largely the result of adaptation to different environments and are so diverse that it is impossible to categories members into distinct

originally examining the “art
'deals with search, science deals
with research" attitude that he
believes has ordered the gap
between art and science, Kenneth christianity (biology) illustrated both the ever-increasing similarities and the necessary contracts between the two
fields at a fine arts lecture last
Thursday
He noted the act of creation
15 the stainless bond between
scientist and humanity. “The
mientist and the artist only live
when they are creating,” he
said. In this light christianity
questioned whether one can diyol'ce the search for scientific
knowledge from the search at
beauty. “What scientists strike
to achieve is poverty, and who
tries more about poverty than
the artist?” he asked.
christianity feels that the
artist alld scientist have been
most seriously estimated by the
common connection of seven-
 
topic processes “Data-gathering
or processing is no more I
process of science than canvas—
stretching is that of art. The
really important questions of
science are what kinds of questions will be asked and not
what the answers Will be," he
said
In obtaining necessary differ-
enter between science and art,
christianity cited the contrast-
ing importance oi edition as a
in the work of the
scientist and the artist, and the
beautifully stainless scope of
artistic endeavor as compared
stimulus
with the more restricted horn—
zone of science.
In defining the most basic
difference christianity said,
"Science has one basic differ-
once from art—reliability.

Many Feel Overwhelming Helplessness
Say Students files
Five Grinnell students who par-i,
evaluated iu inner—city work pool
tests last summer and this spring
related their experiences in a panel ,
discussion Sunday night in the
South Lounge of the Forum.
“A City pi Necessity,” a film den
picking the Chicago inner city, prepared the discussion. Panel members were Jay williams, modular
for, Bob connect, Anne Spragiie,
relation Rice, and Gretchen
speaker.
One impression of inner-city his;
that the panel arrested was the
overwhelming hopelessness ion by
many people who live under condition'ls they cannon escape. Miss
sir-:lgiie cited the example in a
man all relief who, like many Otllr
ei-s, respiratory wanted [0 iihrl a
job, but coupon't, because “there‘
simply are not enough jobs, even
{or those who are trained.” Empliisning the lack of mobility con»
coming heavy prospective workers, [
she added, "HOW can you try (Di
work who you can’t even get to‘,
re they're offering i "
According lo Miss speaker, poor
education is also responsible for
in s hopelessness, especially for
mean c . ieI]. She said, ' he ed-
 
inner-Ciiy Vacation
station they're getting is delicious.
They’re just moving alien ibruiigh.
And this is a fact at his in the inner city."
Miss Rice said, “We have an
impression oi the poor as obvious»
ly poor and unintelligent. but they
are given nothing but victims of
Circumstances. People in this con-
action are not typical: they are not
statistics; they are not all alike.
We can't know their thoughts and
their potential.”
“We finally realized that all the
clothes we’ve heard are true. It's
one thing to believe It intellectual-
ly and answer to believe ii emctionnlly,” Williams added.
“l didn’t want to hear stories
about how bad things were,” Rob-
“because allen were

pretty bad. But I'm glad I (lid
hear, because I didn't know this
problem existed."
Chicago has tried to eliminate a
part at its slim problem by building new highrise apartments. How;
ever, according to Miss speaker,
“moving the people min high-rise
apartments dress’t solve a thing,
it just contacts the people and

Tile bus was not filled because of

dropped out without warning less

In Washington we owned with

adults to protest United states
policy in diet Nam. The march
was not intended to propose any
particular long—range solution, but
rather to express our respondent

No Campaign Probe
Says SGA Session
By Ted require
Most of this week’s Advisory

discussing a motion made by center Tobias to investigate campaign
tactics.
His motion, as amended by Steve
Kent, would have established a
committee to investigate “the costs
incurred by a candidate for the or
[ice of SGA President, and the
means of reducing them, and the
inadaquacy at present methods for
regulation SGA elections; . . that
this committee recommends legislation in these problem areas,
should it deep legislation necessary."
Dan Bucks introduced an amendment virtually disregarding campaign methods and focusing on the
problem of financial costs to he investigated by the ﬁdance committee, Uf which he is a member.
The Bucks amendment was
passed by a Vote of 9-5. Tobias
stated alter the defeat, “This is a
direct threat and result to the existing student government system
and its supposed democracy."
The amended motion passed
by a 16-1 vote.
The election reform legislation

which alleged threats caused a can»

According to SGA President

After the wild success of the
BurnstineGrossman scene from
Arthur Miller’s After the Fill in
the coffee house last Saturday
night, the 1M chairman have
caught the “coffee house fever." 1
don't Want to let the cat out of the
'bag, or anything like that, but now
in the planning stage is an exhibition lM softball game to be put
on there. The field dimensions will
be somewhat appreciated because
of the limited space, and there will
be certain ground rules — like
anything through a plate glass window is an automatic home run.
The cover charge will be $32.50 per
person, mostly to cover the cost
of damages. i understand one of
the most immediate problems is
fighting out how to protect the
kitchen from being clobbered when
the better things.
If the exhibition softball game is
successful, and undoubtedly it Win
be, it will given the door to I Virtually endless array of possibilities
for our magnificent, john-size upresso palace. Alrmdy in the planning stage is an idea to make the
coffee house the green oi a 10th
hole addition to the wait course.
One closer Grinnellian has suggested that we not call it a green.
but rather a red. (Keep calm, you
young Republicans — he’s now
 
being investigated by the John
march Society). The tee~off area
will be on the 10th avenue softball
field, and the 1M holders will follow an interesting route over
Cowles, through party, and into
the Forum, Sorry. lovers, this new
course addition is strictly for the
use or our holders.
Who knows what the future may
hold? Perhaps as each season
comes upon us, we may see in the
coffee house no football, volleyball. basketball. bowling, or, if the
coffee cups are enhanced or little
bit, swimming.
But getting to events at hand
—— softball is developing into quite
an open scramble, As or this writing, the only two interested teams
are Clark and East. i suppose if
things keep up the way they have
been, the winner of the Clark—
East game may very well determine the winner of_the softball
crown. Actually, of course, as the
result of our tnmendout field facilities, the winning 1M team will
turn out to be the one with the
most experienced mountain chambers and spelunkers,
And with IM golf soon to be

F .r
By Steve Casey
The Grinnell home baseball season started last weekend,
and the opened was one long dawn. The game seemed about
as exciting as an 8:00 humanities class on Monday morning,
What kind of baseball is it when the Pioneers can master
only two hits in courtesy ratings? A pretty full kind i my
book. "
Some strange quick of fate brought me late to the game
in the bottom of the fourth ending with the score 10 in favor
of plymouth. So far, so good. I then sat back and saw the
real “excitement" of the game when Gl‘innell “founded out”
three runs on six walks.
Then, of all things, in the top of the fifth I saw a hit. I
did not realize that the gods on Olympus had been so kind to
me — to let me see this great action — until I watched more.
The rest of the game was like watching a Met-Houston thriller
on TV.
Even to the most casual observer, as I was then, it was
easy to see that the poor plymouth kitchen did not have it
in that big fourth ending. But he finished the ending as the
plymouth coach faced on the sometimes. After watching three
Pioneers walk to first base, it took real courage for the kitchen
to stick out the next three walks. For this great dis lay of
courage, the coaches of the nine other Midwest con france
teams ought to give him a reward —- another year of eligibility so he can continue to pitch against their clubs.
After seeing those two exciting ratings, I forced myself
out to the golf course (to play golf). When I came around
and caught a climate of the game from the course, nothing
could have seemed more unappealing to me.
The Pioneers did pull some tricks consumers that increased me, though. First, they had no first base coach, and
second, they had Morgan Michel as third base coach. I will
not deny that Morg is a big mobile monster, but the third
base coach is a responsible job not ’to be filled by a cheerleader. And even IM teams have first base coaches.
There must be some underlying reason for that piece
of strategy. Coach deutsch probably figures if a Pioneer gets
a hit, he is good enough to be his own coach. Of course if most
of the winners get to first on walks, they do not need a coach.
Then if the runner gets to third, he needs somebody to wake
him up, because he has probably got years-eyed from watching the Grinnell battery. And Michel is certainly a person
who can wake up the runner.
When I heard Dennis Hanssen had kitchen a no-better,
I was sorry I missed it, naturally, but the thought of having
to sit through seven ratings with only one principal hit
changed my mind. I was glad I had played golf. 1 almost could
picture how Grinnell got its run—walk, walk, walk, and error.
As it turned out, my prediction was right, except it was in
reverse order.
Unfortunately, I hit as many good balls on the golf
course as the Pioneers did on the diamond, so I ended up
with a poor score. But it would have taken about a 75 for the
nine for me to have been sorry for missing the rest of the
doubleheader.
Don’t get me wrong. I am happy the Pioneers won. But
if this is the way they are going to be playing for the rest
of the year, it is going to be a long season for the fans.
