Statement on Drug Problem
T0: Students and Faculty
FROMl Glenn suggest
Below is a statement describing the basic position and procedures under which the College will proceed with the “drug
ﬁi'salem." it should be read as a supplement to the already pub-
shed statement in the Student Handbook, pages 18—19.
This complimentary statement was prepared in consultation
with representative faculty and students, with resident advisors,
and With the legal counsel of the College. The problems surrounding drug use are very complicated, and I am aware that this
statement is important. Events and continuing discussion will
bring north suggestions for improving it; they will he welcome
and considered for accommodation into future Statements. In the
t‘dealtime, however, I believe this complimentary statement, which
is effective as of this date, provides us with a accessible position
and a useful series of procedures for supporting it.
Alter the first paragraph, which is largely a ste-statement of
the material in the Grinnell Student Handbook, pages 18-19, the
following is designed to describe the general procedures by which
the College will implement its established position on the illegal
drug problem:
The College expressed deep concern over the possible harm to
students who may be involved in the use of dangerous and unlawful
drugs, and wishes to make its attitude toward the use of such
drugs as clear as possible. The major concerns are the serious
possibility or damage to the mental and physical health of users,
the legal consequences of involvement in the possession or distribution of drugs, the effect oi drug use on the academic well-being
of students, and the likelihood that drug users will encourage others
in the campus community to become involved. The College will
make efforts to inform students about drug use, by providing both
individual controlling and outside speakers and reading materials.
Students are reminder that private and conﬁcentral help
concerning drug problems is available, They are encouraged to
use the confidential services of the master-Poweshiek County Mental Health Center; or, if they wish, they may talk with a resident
advisor or staff collector or student dean or faculty person of
their choice. They will be given all the private and confidential
help the college can provide, and this confidentiality will be
respected. .
with these considerations in mind, the College will proceed as
follows with students involved in illegal drug use:
(1) If there ls alleged to be substantial knowledge that a std«
sent is using any kind of illegal drug in the residence calls or on
campus, he will be asked to center with I group composed of
the student means, a faculty member or a student’of his own
choosing, and a faculty member appointed by the Chairman of
the Faculty.
As a result of this private discussion, the group may decide
on any or more of the following:
(A) The obligations about drug use may not be true, or
(B) The student may be told to seek professional controlling,
or
(C) The student may be told to seek psychiatric help, or
(D) The student may be recommended, or
(in 'event of any of these latter three results, the parents or
musicians oi the student may be notified if circumstances appear
lo make such action available.)
(E) The student may be recommended for disciplinary action
to the president of the College. Any disciplinary action, if
so recommended, may range from social promotion through
removal from the residence calls to discussed from college. In any of these possibilities, and in accordance with
usual practice in disciplinary matters, the parents or
musicians oi the student will be notified. This practice of
notification is part or the College‘s obligation to parents
and musicians.
Recommendations for disciplinary action will he sent to the
resident of the College. The student so recommended may appeal
is case to the president, or he may first ask for 3 Judicial Coun-
all hearing. In the latter even, all information made available to
the private discussion group will in turn be made available to
the Judicial Council. Depending on the recommendation of the
Judicial Council, the student may appeal his ease to the president
of the College.
(2) If a student has an adverse reaction to any drug he should
'0 or his friends should take him directly in the emergency room

Bdilﬁ Pal/{Y S REVISEE
President Glenn suggest today issued a complimentary
statement to the Student Handbook ”designed to describe the
general procedures by which
the college will implement its
established position on the illegal drug problem."
“I believe this complimentary
statement, which is effective as
of this date, provides us with a
accessible position and a useful
series of procedures for supporting it," suggest said in a
cover letter released with the
statement,
STATEMENT “lMPERFECT”
rating the complexity of the
drug problem, suggest called
the statement “important" and
emphasized that it is subject to
revision as “events and Continuing discussion” make it never:
mary.
“My essential problem in
writing the statement was to
express all the obligations of
the college in the fastest manner,” suggest told the 5&3
earlier this week.
suggest issued the statement
following recent actions by the
means in three generated cases
of student drug involvement.
In those cases, two students
were placed on conduct promotion alter being treated for
adverse reactions to illegal
drugs, and another student
who was allegedly dealing in
messaging voluntarily withdrew
from the college after consultation with the means.
Encouraging students w i t h
drug problems to use the controlling services provided by the
college, suggest pleased in the
statement that the college will
protect the privacy of students
who seek help,
“They will be given all the
private and confidential help
the college can provide, and
this confidentiality will be respected,” suggest emphasized.
However, suggest also said
that the college will take action
“if there is alleged to be Substantial knowledge that a student is using any kind of illegal
drug in the residence calls or
on campus." The statement
outlined the general procedures
the college will follow in dealing with students it subjects of
involvement with illegal drugs.
SEEK MEDICAL All)
suggest recommended in the
statement that students suffering from adverse drug reactions be taken directly to the
emergency room of Grinnell
HospitaleeSt and not to the
Health Center, which is made
quality equipped to handle
such problems,
The president also mentioned
that students should not try to
administer estimates or remedies oi their own when they
find a fellow student complaint
ing of adverse drug effects.
Warning of the legal hazards
of drug involvement, suggest
said that the college cannon
protect involved students from
legal consequences if civil
authorities decide to make in<
destinations on campus.
In an interview last Tuesday,
suggest expressed c o n c e r it
about Grinneli’s growing drug
problem. “currently we have
_ some hardcore users," he said.
“There's no doubt about it
rating the many difficulties
involved in handling the drug
problem, suggest commented,
“The only easy solution is for
students not to use drugs, but
that's no solution because they
do use them,"

The college that last year produced the world’s first male
homecoming queen has now
adopted a peacetiik patch as its

“Tory Pioneer," a big,
brown found owned by student
senator William Stranger, was
appointed by the senate to fill
the Office of Grinnell College

The senate admitted $15 for the
construction of Tory Pioneer's
dog house, and an additional
$5 to pay [or moscow food.
Tory Pioneer may be the
world's first casino pacifist. ACs
working to the dog's owner, Tory
suffered a broken rear leg last
year when a police car ran into
him at a peace visit.
Stranger said that ever since

year by student Senators Michael Brandon and Daniel Clleifetz.
Their appearance at a May faculty meeting touched off a debate among the faculty which
was inconcluswe, since it came
at such a late point in the year.
Brandon and Cheiletz's original proposal was that some std<
cents be allowed to attend all
faculty meetings, and, if recognized by the chair, to spears
at the meetings. At the time, the
proposal was in a very general
form, requesting support of the
principle that students should be
permitted to attend faculty
meetings, which are now closed
to them. The proposal passed
by an overwhelming voice vote
in the session in which it was
introduced The question then
was reduced to the problem of
defining how many students
would be allowed to attend the
meetings, and how those star
cents would be selected.
in the last faculty meeting oi
last year, President suggest instructor the Committee on Faculty Organization to work on a
proposal for the specials oi student admission to faculty meetings. The report of Mr. tests‘
meeting, was the response to
suggest's instructions.
The recommendations were
that ten student representatives should have the right to
participate in, and vote at, any
regular faculty meeting; that
they would be given one vote
each, and that the ten would
include 9 students elected enlarge, plus the SGA president.
Probably the most controversial mandate was that voting
privileges be given to the students, since the basin idea
that students would be allowed
to attend faculty meetings. a:

By HENRY SCHEFF
Last Tuesday’s Senate meeting was characterized by longwindedl debate and few decisions, but several matters were
discussed.
Significant debate resolved
around the Organization committee’s proposal before the faculty to allow 10 students, probably elected at large, to attend
faculty meetings as voting members. Senate debate indicated
that there was considerable opposition to the Committee’s plan,
but a motion asking the Senate
to go on record against the motion was tables.
Former SGA President Tom
Thomas assisted that 10 Students would make a decision
difference in only two or three
faculty votes a year, and that
implementation of the proposal
would be male tokenism.
Thomas also cited the difficulty
in finding 10 representative students to attend faculty meetings.
Senator Andrew Loelvl said
that the proposal was sidestepping a more important issue,
that Of the right of all students
to attend faculty meetings.
Senator William Stranger constitutes that the proposal, it
passed, would heaven the power of the faculty his-a-his the

In other actions, Senator Andrew grill expressed dissatisfae

Center and a three-man committee was set up to investment'
the situation and to talk to Mrs.

both the original motion and the

In an interview with an 5&3
reporter on Tuesday, Kleinschmidt responded to questions
about students in faculty meetings. One question was what
kinds of restrictions he sees as
necessary (or attendance. His
answer:
”Suppose someone, some professor proposed a plan which is
popular, watches on ~ it gets out

runs with that ball, and expects-
tions arise among the student:
mat certain things are going to

the long run, there will he department, protest, a feeling or
‘why not?’. At best, that kind or
protest creates a divisiveness
that is not necessary," Kleinschmidt also commented upon
an incident at Harvard University several years ago when the
faculty there passed a rule
against publication any decision
until it was after upon.
“I don‘t advocate this," Kleinschmidt said, “but. I can see a
certain sense in reducing procedure expectations and reactions to things that have not
been worked out fully.”
Does Kleinschmidt see any
parallels between the current
controversy at Grinnell and
those occurring at other
schools? He told the 5&3:
“There has been a great deal
OT discussion and action in colleges and universities here and
in Canada, for example, to pro«
side mechanisms such as students on the boards of trustees.
it may be. on both sides, something or riding a popular idea,
a had. . , .Although i think the
faculty here could live with students attending its meetings. I
personally can't get my mind
around to the proposal or a
student vote. This makes it an
entirely different ball-game."
Dean Wall expects that this
student, attendance proposal
might come up for faculty discussion several times before it
is ultimately after upon. He
said, ”It’s all up in the air now,
because the (equity tables it —
it will no doubt come up at the
October 6 meeting (the next
one)."

"find political contests and issues that exist in the community, When an issue is raised,
they ought to get involved,"
The black translator also commented on the Black partners.
“They are leading in the politicalization ut black people,"
Bond assisted. "They are moving toward an economic apply—
his rather than just a political
analysis or the problems.”
"To build another party in
this Country, I think you would
have to do it over a period or
years," Bond told the press.
Looking towards the future,
he is “more optimistic about
the political future of black
people than about their eco<
comic future. I see black
people taking power in their
communities."
This theme was echoed in his
address when he told the audio

“begun to organize political and

Bond was highly critical of

When asked about the con-

“it people are interested in

Faculty Proposal “twist
The {adults is presently considering n recommendation by its
Organization Committee that would allow ten ”representative"
students to vote at faculty meetings, which are presently closed
to students. Implementation of the Committee’s plan would be unlike for the faculty and critical to the student position
Allowing ten students to vote would be no more than a feature
ot_tokenism that would subject the Students’ role in College decision-making. Ten student votes, even ii cast together, would
rarely decide an issue before the faculty
Establishing a student voting privilege would engineer the
concept oi a “faculty decision." The College’s “wider constitution” could easily disregard faculty opinion as being too heavily
shaped by the student voters.
Aside from the obvious difficulty oi finding ten daily reply
sensitive students, submitting Selected students to Vote rolled
possibly discounted faculty members from seeking the opinions
of other students. ,
The proposal seems to assume a mythical “harmony of interests and direction,” a notion that was popular in college governance several years ago. In reality, the interests oi students,
faculty, and administrators are different at several points. A
student point of view could be more clearly and equitably anticipated if it were calculated as such and then presented to the appropriate body, rather than falling to the province of ten small
voices.
The compromise or the student position interest in the present
proposal is readily apparent. replacement is not the issue; participation is not synonymous with power. Student difference
could too easily be discussed with the argument, “You had a
vote." it must be realized that a token voting privilege for stud
cents would actually be hypothetical to positive political house«
quence.
There are other options that the faculty must Consider. A tar
more satisfactory proposal would be as follows:
1.) All students should have the right to attend faculty meetings.
2.) The student senate should have the permanent privilege to
speak and to present options at facility meetings, but not to vote.
3.) Other students should he allowed to speak and present
options at the discretion of the faculty’s preceding officers
There may be a time when many college decisions can be
made under the tennis oi participation democracy with students,
faculty and administrators working together. That time will not
come until all parties can be truly and equitably represented.
Until that time, submitting a new students to vote at faculty meetings is of no help. The faculty should defeat the tests' committee
recommendation and take immediate steps to open faculty meetings to all students and to grant them limited speaking privileges.

Discrimination of Local Hotel
By Henry Schett
Last summer a Farmer professor at Grinnell alleged that
he was discriminated against
at a local hotel. On Tuesday,
August 12, Mr. John \cialis, a

According to cialis' complaint. Mrs. power had accepted
a telephone reservation, but
had no room available when he
arrived at the hotel. cialis said
that he was told the room had

He called the Park Hotel at
approximately 10:50 p.m. and
made a reservation, saying he
would arrive in 15 minutes. He
was late, training at the Hotel

night broke all previous distance

polar flight.
announced by failure, Conrad
has committed himself to trying the polar flight again. He
is determined to be the first
man to pilot a light craft around
the world, over the polls.
“After all," he explained,
‘‘who could I live with if I
coupon’t live with myself? That
would be the Case if I didn’t
give it another chance."
This time, the Flying Grand-
father is going to take oil from
his Winona, Minn, birthplace on

the situation suspicious enough
to warrant predictions against

agreement planning to accept

in her hotel. She also agreed to
report the names of all non<

once a month for a period of
six months.
Mrs. power said, “I was told

She said that the sticker

Then, according to Mr. Mattnusch's report to the commission, Mrs. Mattausch called the

suspicious after the incident,
told her that she didn’t accept
telephone reservations, but to

there could .be a cancellation.
Mrs. power denied that she

was for, where were they

While the {acts in the case
are somewhat nuclear since
there is no way to prove that

Grinnell for as long as there
have been black students and

the cialis incident may syndicate that racing in the Grinnell community is not dead.
