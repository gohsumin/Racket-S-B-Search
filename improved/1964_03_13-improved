There is probably no more suspenseful moment in
the Quad year than the night of the AWS formal dinner, when the lights suddenly go on and the new board

a night of excitement, glory, and explanation. The excitement has dwindled—hall reservations and room
generations for the winners have run their course, The
glory will soon be gone—when those all night meetings
begin. The explanation, however, must remain. The
women of the quad have elected their leaders and they

The new house treatments should have defining opinions

To the Editor:
At Grinnell, a destruction attempt at a uniform approach

especially, in the iritellectual
approach altered to us manually listed children; these intellectual restrictions are more
proposed than the social ones.
America has grown with the

we come to Grinnell, we are
taught to objective and analyze
everything. We seek in empirical facts and precise logical

emily I
We also learn to objective order and learn to respond relatively to it. We try to deﬁne
our primary terms and outline
principles of ordering. We find
almost everything can be explained in some way or has
some order. We then come to
see meaning—in all its lenses,
scientific. esthetic, and ethic
#as a real fact of the World,
but not as true or false; the
multiplicity of orders makes
everything seem equally insignificant,
We see the apparent directory between the order of the

ltd, every student who uses this
approach must quit in failure.
Although some never begin
this approach to ethics, since
they are satisfied that man is
evil and needs to be restricted
and since the objectivecrdered
approach reflects their restricted society, those who do are
left deeply dissatisfied. They
reported in the first place trend
the stereotyped imageiof evil
man that the social restrictions
or any society reply, but they
could discover no alternative.
These people must then importantly accept the respective
middle class American Values
(Grinnell’s), or allow common
sessions and semi-conscious
beliefs to dominant, or aimlessly report against the order
and restrictions of society.
This is the cause of "given
sent” behavior; hence, the
negative attitude./
Students can learn that the
analytical method — which is
Grinnell's Way of liberia no!
the only way. Someone can
demonstrate that a novel is not
a point in a literary history and
that philosophy need not be a
study of alternative beliefs.
Art and philosophy are are<
alive disciplines, which strike
for beauty and truth. If these
are not empty terms, if values
can be found and not acquired,
then the creative approach to
life is proper, Can we ever accept that the apparent directory between things and the
mind is only the directory between order and creative order,
or no real directory at all?
Creativity (which must operate
underground at Grinnell) at
least allows us choice in our
decisions — in step beyond logical limitations.

A shadow of secrets clouds

Kennedy’s investigation While

headed by Justice Warren, its
original intent, to Conduct a full
public investigation of the
investigation, has been transferred into a supercsecret
probe. Warren himself has
stated “some of the facts in
this case will never be known
In your lifetime” The Warren
Commission is restriction its investigation only to evidence
submitted by the Dallas Police,
FBI, and the Secret Service
Before public protest, led by
Mark Lane, was voices, the
Commission refused to have
counsel appointed for Oswald,
and denied the right of cross«
examination; they still refuse
the right of presentation of new
evidence, and have maintained
their secrecyr
, Under these circumstances
Mark Lane, a prominent New ’

to the Warren Commission a
lawyer's brief evaluating the
evidence leader to the public.
Lane was associated to discover numerous contradictlons in
the government’s case. starting

to conduct his own investigation by going to Dallas and intervention witnesses. He has

his opinion the weapon was invisible of the accuracy needed
to shoot the-President from the
sixth floor ’of the Book repository Building,
(3) The authorities claim
that three shots were fired, yet

(4) The opinion of four doctors spending Kennedy at Park—

the neck was an entrance
wound has changed after the
FBI presented the doctors with
a felt accompli. ‘
(5) The witness to Tippitt's
murder store the murderer
was “short, stocks, with early

height, and thin with spouse
hair.
(6) The paraffin test by an em

A great deal of money has
been made recently since the

“Memorial books" selling for $2
each have been printed by both

in the millions of copies. Othermementoes of the late President include a 97c JFK salt and
pepper set; a candy bar named
“big'ah”; an “Eternal Flame

photographs, records, photo‘graphs, busty, desk weights,
etc.
Newsweek recently called it
a “memorial boom" and has
quoted a Washington. D. c.,
novelty manufacturer as saying: “People are always hungry for the buck."
“Togetherness” it appears,
according to the Burlington
County (N. J,) Department of
Civil Defense, is just one more

one of those stubborn people
who is unable to realize how

in order to prove that even

is known, appear to have survival the experience

he does maintain that if we
are to accept the news leads,
Oswald could not have been
the assessed, Of course it may
typically be argued that the
government has not divulged
permanent information which
might contractor Lane's assumptions. Hence what is needed is an open public hearing
where all the facts can be
weights before a commission
which is representative of the
American public, not a former
CIA Chief, a former FBI agent,
two Dixiercrats, a Republican
Senator, and on inﬂgeneral
businessman, who presently
constitute the Commission.
The petition which is being
calculated this week calls for
an "open public hearing," and
requests “that some counsel
representing the interests of
the late Lee Harvey Oswald be
permitted the right of cross~ex—
aminau‘on and the right of presentation of evidence bearing
upon (Oswald's) role, if any,
in the investigation. r . ."
A nation-wide organization
has been formed on this basis.
Groups are scripting up on
numerous computer. The pressure which these groups have
generated has already convinced the Warren Commission
to account a lawyer for Oswald
and to allow Mark Lane to testing. Public opinion can also
influence the government to
call an open public hearing.

Thoughts About New form
Tlli
the last of two articles by Ann Lousin concerning the
construction of a new men’s form. The first appeared in last
Week's issue.
(For those of you who were
not with me last week, the first
part of this column was a defense of the off-campus men.
This week, I should like to defend on campus women.)
The Board of Trustees’ proposal to build a new men’s
form is double ridiculous because I) there is no need to
pull thirty men hack on campus; and Z) the need for some
plastic changes in the women’s
forms is overwhelmingly greater than the need for better accommodations for the men. For
example, Loose hall, which was
built in 1947, was the last com»
en’s form, whereas the college
has since then‘elected the you—
bee counters in 1948 and the
double morrison in 1960.
At the time that the college
built Loose, it left one whole
wall holiday without windows
with the promise that within a
few years a Loose tower would
be built, approximately the
height of Main hall, so that
the Quadrangle would then be
architecturally balanced, There
were also to be a parking area
for the Women students and
their guests and a proper entrance off rights avenue, somewhat like the Main hall entrance. This would have believed much of the traffic at
Main and offered a second entrance for women after the
logged was closed. cordless to
say, the women are still waiting for these additions,
MeanWhile, the over-crowd»
Ing of the logged continues.
Main hall undoubtedly holds
the worst accommodations on
campus. In that peak year of
1960-61, Main, which was built
to accommodate about forty
women comfortable, held sixth»
three uncomfortably. The com—
an of Main have, in reality, no
lounge, as anyone who has ever
been in the “Q'uadrangle
Drawing Room" at lunchtime
can testing. When partner
lounge replaced the Little
Theatre the Trustees said that
it would become the Main Hall
lounge in 1964, Now the plans
are to keep it a public meetingroom, (for “dating couples,”
Dr. women said.) So Main hall
still won’t have its own lounge.
The rooms in Main are undoubtedly the smallest and, on
the whole, the consent in the entire Quad. Sound carries as if
all the rooms were wired on a
hall interior. ls it any wonder
that the chief obstacle to publishing freshman forms is that
upperclassmen refuse to move
' out of larger soundproofed
singles in Loose into miniature
CChOvchambers in Main with
less than minimum aerospace?
Speaking of wiring, the electricity of the Quad. especially
in the five oldest forms is dangerously inadequate I have
been rooms designated by the
architect as singles actually
turned into douglas with only
one wallsocket. The number of
appliances on the one outlet
is enough to cause an overhead
and possibly a fire—~as it did in
my room in my freshman year
in Main.
Kitchenette facilities are
hardly adequate and often less
 
than what North Campus has.
Instead of the eleven legal and
several extra-legal refrigerators that the men have, the
women have four legal refrigerators and apparently no illegal
ones, One' kitchenette often
serves 3060 women, with the
result that any maintenance is
virtually impossible, the kitchenettes are ill-equipped, and
those who want tea or coffee
must make it in, their rooms
with the illegal, but necessary,
coins.
The women’s younger are no
bigger, and sometimes smaller.
than those in the men’s calls,
even though they serve 25 per
cent more people per lounge,
Three of the women’s calls
have hourly-equipped recreation rooms with furniture that
look as though even the union would reject it. One of these
rec. rooms houses the one television for over 500 women,
(North Campus ratio: 11 for
600,)
And then there are “terrace”
apartments-the movements of
Cleveland, J a m e s, barnes,
Read and Loose. In I-barnes and
Read these rooms are separated only by tissue-paper variations. Empirical evidence has
demonstrated that a joke
dropped in the earliest room
at one end of the floor can be
heard most clearly in the room
at the other end.
The Trustees and Messrs.
women, Stauss, and Ludwig
have long reflected the innovation of the women's forms in

The play, sponsored by National Collegiate Players and
Grinnell Players, portrait a
day in the life of a young man
in Paris of the 188035. hilton,
who also is producing and direction the play, describes it
as a “dreamrpoem,” a phrase
which indicates a faces of the
drama’s psychological frameWork,
Through many Varied series
of events, the play reveals its
protagonist’s search for trucks
within his existence, His relationships with an actress and
professor shed varying perspectives on his character.
Discussing the drama, which
he wrote last semester, hilton
states, “The Counterbalance
between ‘ events’ of future
search, and sleeping moments
of awareness provide a basis
for the play’s action. Symbolic
values are attached to many
facets of the play. I chose a late
nineteenth century setting, because I feel that the color and'
capacity of life of this period,
which is reflected in the music
of Wagner, the painting of
janet and Renoir, and the wait
ing style of Stendhal and blair
best contain a climate of the

to cloud honest encounter with
human dilemmas. I am designated by the Romantic—Victor-

Asked about the technical
phase of the production, hilton
replied: “I am increased by
the kinesthetic elements in
drama, as well as character
detection. As a result, we have
mentioned a set which, within
the combines , of the Arena
Theater provide us with five
acting or stage areas, which
serve to relate the characters
through means of changing perception, We have attempted,”
hilton continued, “to employ
several art film photographic
techniques, which enhance the
possibilities of production in
a foursided arena,"
DANIEL PRINCE is the first
production in the Grinnell

theater-in-thereof'nd technique,
with the audience completely

The American Medical resolution’s opposition to the proposed King-Anderson medications~fortune-aged bill was authorized by the organization’s

D,r. Annie refused the charge

Hospital expenses have inn

5500 hospital bill, $350 goes to

Furthermore, he mentioned,
ghost persons have found a way

posts. “The infant health insurance business has grown as
medicine has become more

Today I46 million Americans
re covered by some type of
health insurance. Some 10,400.00 of the nation's 18 million
citizens over 65. years of age

Dr. penis also claimed that
apple seem to have the wrong
exception of health insurance.
“Health insurance should be
used to protect savings and income; it should not be used to
cover the expense of a check-up
or a chest x—ray, Nobody complaint that they don't get to use
lie or fire insurance, but many
people certainly complete about

Politics enters the medical insurance picture because not all

like to see, however, is that

“The King - Anderson bill

This feature also works on a

The second feature of KerrMills is in effect in 36 states
(including Iowa) and costs $350

plan, the details of which differ slightly from state to state.
an elderly person may own his

and have limited savings while

Dr. penis is also the head of
