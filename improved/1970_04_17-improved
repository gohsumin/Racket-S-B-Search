The Buildings and Grounds workers have gone
on ski'i c. The transfers’ Union and the College
have been unable to agree on a contract for these
employees. The College argued that its proposal is
hair within the sounds of its financial resources and
the current labor market. The Union argued that the
College can allow'd more and that the employees deserve more money and benefits. Student and faculty support for the strike has ranked from design
sympathy to active participation in marketing and,
in several instances, to formatting of classes.
The matters of the College’s financial resources
and financial commitments are complex ones. No
one, we believe, can make a decision on the business
of the position of either side without a thorough
examination of these. This week we have attended
both student and faculty meetings at which the
question of the strike was considered. It is carefully obvious that a number of people are perfectly
willing to support the Buildings and Grounds workers with little or no knowledge of the facts. At
neither of these meetings was the possibility seriously considered that the Union is making adjust and
unreasonable demands. This is surely an example
of a degenerate kind of liberalism. It is commission
without thought.
We do not automatically support either the College or the Union in this matter. By the time this
editorial appears, some settlement may be reached.
We believe, however, activists to the contrary notwithstanding, that the proper position for students
and faculty to take is one of respective silence. As
for those faculty members who have refused to hold
Classes in support of the strike, we access them of
intolerable professional interference. A riLuTiber of
students and faculty have shown that their capacity
for righteous integration far extends their desire
for returned action.

SCARLET AND BLACK
The Hisl'try of Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna german a+ Grinnell College
Part Three
The lifestyle that Henry and
Krys pursue is certainly quite
dlflel'end from that of most
people, it is perhaps the primary
thing which distinguished them
from the rest of society and
makes them, in the town of
Grinnell at least, stand out The
5815 asked Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna german Just how they
would characterize the way they
live.
First, they emphasized that
mammgm acquisition oi wealth
was not a value to them, as they
tclt ii is to much ol society, They
are not really interested in ace
cumulative a great number of
material provisions, impact, they
have already gotten rid oi or sold
many of the “middle class
clothes” that they had in college,
Second, they said that they do
not believe in the institution oi
marriage, “especially as the
woman is seen as an extension
of her husband and not in her
own right." perhaps, they teen,
it is too exclusive, and the two
people begin to depend on each
other too much for their basic
needs.
Work is not as important to
Henry and Krys as it is to most
people in society: neither of them
has a “straight“ job, and they
are content with a relatively low
standard of living. “We won't
give up our ideals to earn a lot
of money,“ Wilhelm said,
They mention that they do not
have any children, and that they
do not plan to have any. One
reason, Krystyna german said.
is that She dress't feel treat she
has a “good enough biological
makeup to pass on lo another
generation" tshe has diabetes),
Another is treat they [tel that not
everyone has to have children.
and possibly there is too much
effectiveness m a family.
"We totally reject criticism,
religion, or any vocational
thought," Wilhelm mentioned,
and he later added philosophy to
this list.

that they thought that marijuana
was probably water than alcohol;

said that he never had any in.
location that there were drugs
in the Gallery
An important part of their lite
style, Henry and Krys said, is
recreation, which to them is
"doing something creative,”
They are only interested in
recreation which is “participant
type"ratherthanpassive
As it to complete their
characterization of their life
style, Krystyna german said,
“Scx7delivered,”
They both emphasized, though,
that although these are their
attitudes now, they may change.
According to Krystyna german,
“this is the way we live now, but
we’re not convinced it is the
ultimate way We’d like to experimentandlindotherways.”
ln fact, they are actively
planning on establishing a
comment which will expensive
this instrumentation with did—
recent ways of living. They hope
to find an alternative life style
within a comment oi the type
batteries alter that outlined in
the book garden Two by B.‘ F.
printer. They would like to form
a comment which would be
organized to a greater extent
than most, and they are willing
to experiment to find the best
way to organize it, in fact, the
main feature of their comment
will be its emphasis on instrumentation, They will try to
work towards a system which
will Value all humans alike no
matter what their skills, alld one
which would be available to
large groups at people.
They have already sent out
some applications, and feel that
it they can attract many young
people to join them, later maybe
some will leave and start their
comments. ln/fact, they think ot
their comment, with it's “experimental attitudeitowards
change" and where the “normal
mode or doing things will be
experimental" as a model for
other people,
They think it Will be
distinguished from many oi the
comments that are being
established today by its attitude
towards technology Although
they tool that there has been a
rehabilitation oi technology in
present day society, ”where the
sole goal at technology is to
create material assurance with
only a small attention on human
welfare," they hope to put it to
good use in their own comment.
When their comment is
established, it will use the
manufacture oi the photographic

Wilhelm designed as its economic
base These masters, which are

the grounds crew.
When a job opens up it has
been the policy to let present
too employees apply for the
job. Qualified men have often
been found from among these
employees. For example, the
three people in the paint shop
and the Storekeeper came from
the customize force, and the
second electricity and a car»
center were hired from the
grounds crew. The College has
hired people from outside,*in
order to get skills they coupon’t
get from among the present
force, but dawn indicated that
a qualified present employee is
given first preference.
Many other complaints were
stated by the workers interpreted. dawn was said to feel
that he never makes a mistake.
to be unable to work with
people, to act in a way that
puts him above his employees,
so that they cannon talk to him.
The general feeling was that
l-lawn appeared to have no re
spec: for B&G employees.
Mr. Donald zambia, College
Treasurer, disturbed. According to zambia, Mr. dawn tries
to relate on the judgment of
employees more than his predecessor. “Under Mr. garden,
employees were to do nothing
without a written work order,
but Mr. dawn assisted from the
beginning that employees be
allowed to use their own judgment in man matters.” The
Page Five
old procedure. which made use
of work orders, is a very com—
mon procedure in American
colleges.
Regardless of this there is a
concern district at Mr. learn
among the lzxc employees who
were interpreted. learn is
known to be plant, and occasionally, perhaps, he is not stilttCiently sensitive to the leave
inns pi those [U whom he is
talking. “l'll b0 the first one
to admit that I lack fact, but
the record shows that while i
have been here there have
been no things, the work at employees has been or good quality, the wages of employees
has increased, and the Physical Plant and its employees
ill’e more respected in the College community than they were
helorc."
learn also added that lit
would “novel recommend a man
low- making a mistake if he is
working. I believe that any
tindesmnii, espeCially With the
complex trades today, is going
to make errors in the course oi
ll normal day. Alter all, a man
who does no work makes no
errors."
international enough, dawn
had attempted to set tip a
channel through which he could
learn oi fragrances among,
B&G employees. Hawii's pro»
ccdurc was, from time to time,
to call the working ioremeii
into the online to discuss areas
of concern to the employees.

ltir. living It, powell, owner
oi rates Flowers in Grinnell, told
the Stu; tllzil he thought his
opinions and the opinions oi most
townspeople towards Wilhelm
could be authorized very easily.
“He ought to leave town," Mr.
powell said; “He causes nothing
but problems.” Wilhelm, Mr.
powell indicated, is a serious
problem to town businesses “we
can’t even identify ourselves with
for each print to he passed in r. the College any more because oi
menﬁy wllhelm and his type," he
explained, powell also pointed to
a problem which others had
mentioned: the activities oi
Wilhelm and others make the
money raising task or people in
.the College’s development office
much more difficult. “We just
can’t understand why kids act
this way. we just can’t usr
derstand it,” he concluded,
liir. Paul drink. a local
businessman and a long time
resident of Grinnell said that he
is not familiar with the controversy as it compounds Wilhelm
and the college. He said that his
ideas and attitudes have changed
as he has noticed that “many at
the townspeople who are checked
thy Wilhelm) seem to he the
same people who area’t checked
by our activity in Vietnam, and
who are not concerned with our
racial problems.” Mr. drink said
that relatively low townspeople
do actually know willielin, their

him and what they read in his

paper. According to Mr, drink,
the issues or t>tcrotiactyl which
he saw were ”quite boring." “We
are in a strange society," he
continued. “We get tonight about
minor or supervision things, but
we let the important issues slide
by.”
One local resident. who has
been in several businesses in
Grinnell and did not wish to be
quoted by name, expressed a
view which was fairly typical oi
those people contacted by the
5&8. He said that he thinks
Wllhelm‘s thinking must be “kind
music l' and that “everybody tin
towns that knows something
about him wishes that he were
in Russia." He said that he understands Wilhelm's Situation 7
that he is not a student — but
that some of his friends are not

are in danger oi being fired
because of their recent actor7
items. The College has stated in
official memorabilia to the
B8tG workers that, “Whatever
your own views about unions—
nation are, the College assumes
you that you will not be penalties it you wish to join a union,
that you will not be regarded
it you do not wish to join a
union; in short. you are free to
take any position yoti wish on
the matter."
l-las Mr, llziwii himself been
guilty or threatening workers
with loss of Job or of promotion
because oi their union activities? Mary under, lines supervisor {or South Campus, said
she believed not. “In fact, Mr,
dawn lies leader over bookmarks." Site pointed out that
much time on the job has been
spent talking about the union
and the strike, rather than
working. it Mr. dawn were out
in get those who were participating, she teens he would have
told her to watch (or and report people who were waiting
time. Mr. dawn did not. do this.
She feels there may have been
some legitimate fragrances. but
that these have been brown
largely out or proportion, party
ly, she thought, because oi
animation by students. She was
not approaches to join the
union, since she is a supervisor,
but she would not have joined
it she had been approaches.
“Compared to other jobs in the
community, this one pays well
both in wages and in fridge
benefits."
Some 3&0 workers, again,
seem to believe that Mr. dawn
is or was planning to remove
or had threatened to remove
certain fridge benefits which
the workers have been recent-

mg. The greatest of these is the
provision which allows the child
drew oi those who have been
employed by the College for 3
years or more to attend principal College tuition tree. This,
and other orange benefits, are
set tlowii in the College’s em
player guestbook. It should be
noted that lltiwn himself has
not the power to change any
lienciits granted in this book
He is not ever conducted on
such questions.
Another complaint about Mr.
learn prices from the fact that
in some job classifications,
people doing the same job are
receiving a different wage.
Some workers see this as a way
[or Mr. dawn to reward favorites. According to Mr. l-lawn.
when the current wage schedule was about to go into direct,
he worked out the general
wage structure and then submitted these guidelines to the
working foreign for their recommendations. “I wanted the
employees to have a say in
this, I took their recommendations," dawn pointed out that
the discrepancy between highest and lowest wage within a
class is not more than 15c eur
cent in the cases at mechanics.
Most, but not all, of the in»
mars about Mr. dawn appear
groundless, but it is perhaps
understandable why they arise.

education depends upon a degree

both useful and worthwhile.
Society requires a degree of.
utility for even its models sons

cultural integration is in
strumeittal to this usefulness.
Furthermore, the ratings which a
liliei‘al education teaches us to
enjoy and to seek are culturally
dclilled, and hence capable of
being otherwise in different cirr
substances, and hence not
strictly rational in the
