In a controversy that levels

“We just coupon’t find volunteers to do the for ," said
boston, who is also president
of the Council of House treatments. “The students were

of $1.30 per hour." boston
said he had time and wage
figures for all the student
workers if anyone wanted to

Social Coordinator Jon klein
told the 58:3 he felt the matter had been hourly handled,
but pointed out that not just
boston, “but the whole social
coordination committee has
had problems ﬁusing people to
work. If a job has to be done
and nobody volunteers to do
it, then you have to pay to
have it done.”
klein said that his principal
objective, as well as that of
many other students, was the
way in which the students 7
nearly all of them friends of
boston — were hired. “In the
future, if we decide that Students will have to be paid, we
will hire them through the
regular student placement
service," he said.
In previous years, students
have not been paid for dec-
.writing party, although students who have worked during
the dance itself received a
wage. On occasion student
workers were invited to a
party, which seldom extended

official topic was “Vietnam Present and Future.”
The program began with
Barnes' general analyses of
the political and economic Sltllr

countries with which Barnes
was most familiar from his
service in Bien Long in Vietnam, and his current position
as "country officer” in Laos
with the State Department’s

Before master introduced
this problem, the town attorney scored Barnes in the words
of an old Walter Lippman col»

"reasonably beyond our sphere
of influence.” Barnes replied
that America would have to be
more careful of its use of
power in the future (after
Vietnam), “because it makes
good sense.”

24 Oct, 1969 awakened me to
the fact that the United States

After three months of job
hunting. both through employment agencies and individually,
it became apparent that most

graduates. When simon announced that group withdrawals
from Vietnam made it possible
to spread the induction of those
men on the October Call over
November and December and
cancel the calls for these later
two months, I approaches my
local board and was informed
that I would not be threatened
with induction until after the
first of the year. I decided to

Lounge tomorrow night at 9
pin. Monroe, who has been a
top attraction in the Grand
Ole opry since 1939. is widely
recognized as the originally
of bluegrass music.
Throughout the agencies and
theories the music which later
cyclverl into bluegrass was
known as “string band bus
sic,” usually played with a
guitar, middle, ‘and banks.
Monrcc started playing protcssionally in the early 1930’s
with his brothers charles and
march. In 1938, he split with
his brother charles and formed the now famous Bluegrass
Boys
Monroe developed a completely new style oi music that
incorporated the traditional
music oi the string band and
a more driving sound, the
lead being taken by the middle,
banks, and mongolia. The
mongolia is Monroe‘s insert»
ment. By the early 1940’s the
world of country music had
adopted the term bluegrass
music from the name at Mon
joe’s group.
Bill Monroe's band has been
considered the training ground
for many a country music
star. Perhaps the most famous
musicians who performed with
Monroe were center plant and
Earl Scruggs. it was during
his stay with the Bluegrass
Boys that Earl Scruggs deVeloped his unique style of
banks finger-picking. Other
potatoes who have performed
with Monroe include Don
Reno, back sitemap, Bill
Keith, and Del McCourry.
Monroe has been one at the
most residential forces in country music. When the import
dance of string band music be
can to want as electricity
country music gained pupils
larity, Monroe gave a new life
to unamplliied string band
music.
Monroe has remained true to
his musical principles through
out his career and has con
oriented an incredible number
oi musical competitions.
Among his best known works
are “Footprints in the Snow,“
“1 Hear 3 Sweet Voice calls
inst" "Uncle Pen,” “Roar
note," and the “Blue Moon at
Kentucky.”
Monroe, born in Rosene,
Kentucky, attributes the ideas
for his music to many sources.
The song “Uncle Pen,” for example, was written in memory or his fiddlerplaying uncle
who ﬁrss taught him the try-
national mountain middle tunes.
Monroe also learned much
from Arnold Schultz, a black
guitarist who played at cancer
in the Rosene area.
The importance of Monroe’s
music has been recognized by
many. This summer both the
State of Kentucky and the
Smithsonian institution hundred Monroe for his contribution
to American music.

Football game maritime activities last Saturday were unlimited by a head-cutting
contest between junior
“Penguin” Dave coleman, and
sophomore Jim Demopulos,
better known as “The Fox."
Penguin Dave and The Fox,
both members of Grinnells 0b
Squad checking section, claimed
to have Set the new world
record at 690 head butts.
Previously coleman and
Demopulos claimed to have
held the world record of 150
butts, set during the first home
football game oi this season.
The Fox explained head»
cutting as something that “Has
to be experienced.” The best
d option this reporter could
give would be two people
literally putting their heads
together.
The contest began about live
minutes into maritime in the
section of the stands occupied
by the 0b Squad. 0b Squad
members encouraged both
battery by keeping count of the
number ol times their heads
cluliked together, and a base
drum helped to keep the
rhythm.
”The last butt was just as
exciting as the first,” explains
ed Penguin Dave when the
cutting contest was over. “It
could have gone on forever,”
agreed the Fox.
Both men and women can
par compare in head cutting, The
Fox revealed. "It's a give and
take experience, a new form
of communication. There is no
physical pain involved; in fact
it‘s one of the most ecstatic
feelings one can have. It’s a
metal experience that is best
enjoyed when the two people
are willing to give equally of
themselves.”
Both battery are considering
entering the record in the .
“business Book of World

to a decision.

Tom garden, Bobby deals Give Views On Trial
(John engines, a member
of the “Conspiracy 8" presently on trial in Chicago, will
be on the Grinnell campus
tomorrow. Earlier this week,
two other members of the
Conspiracy, Tom garden
and Bobby deals, released
statements on the current
progress of the trial. Portions of those statements are
printed below.)
garden: We came to Chicago last year because we
were living under a system
that did not represent us, that
was culturally and politicians
meaningless, and l think that
we have now been candidates
as products.
The war in Vietnam still
goes on. President simon has
carried on the policies of
President Johnson. President
simon in fact has used Johnson’s very words in concerning and flooring the anti-war
statement.
This is what we were protecting last year when We said
that we have no role in this,
that this had no meaning to
us — there is no real choice
for the American people. And
when robert Humphrey at the
time of the Moratorium be—
came the man to enlarge Rich»
and simon’s policy, it all came
through in the cheapest and
smallest way: for here were
the same men who we said
represented no choice last
year. now according each
other and trying to carry on
policies of last year.
The people who came to the
streets of Chicago last year
were synthetic about which
way this country was going —
how long it was going to continue the war, how it was go
ing to treat black people, how
it was going to treat young
people — and now i think we
see the same process recording in the countries that occurred last year around the
Convention.
The government attack on
Bobby Scale, on myself and
over people in the countries
follows the same line that
their attack followed last year
around the Convention. There
was a visit demonstration of
the way the government deals
with facts, deals with eve—
dance. yesterday when Mr.
Schultz authorized in his
own selective way what Bobby
deals had said in the morning.
Bobby deals came into the
countries, said that he was
standing on his constitutional
rights, said several times that
he wanted people in the audience to keep cool no matter
what happened, they said they
would, and then later, when
Bobby was thrown back in his
seat Schultz got up, told the
judge that Bobby deals had
earlier told people in the audience to be ready to make an
“attack."
it was only after our in»
distance — we almost had to
stream our assistance — that
that was not the case. that
Schultz, since he was before a
photographer, had to back
down and acknowledge that
there was something else that
Bobby said.
Life Magazine was very pro»
phetic when it said that this
was not so much a trial as
an act of refinance because
men go mad when they know
they have lost. and Judge
coleman knows that he has
lost. the social order that he
represents is finished. The so»
dial order that President simon and Vice President renew
represent is finished.
That's what is going on and
I think it's going to get worse.
i think now, the quarter we
are , . . the more that we are
respective. the more that we
simply sit there in the room,
the more operated and frustrated and bowling they will
become. The process is now
simply underway. Whether we
stream or whether we are silent, it will go from one step
to the next until the entire
trial disintegrates, This is a
prediction, it is not a threat.
deals: Why am I handcuiled,
shackled to a chair, and
tagged in Judge coleman’s
United States District of illinois countries? i am sure
the passes of Americans, especially the Black People, are
intelligent enough to see the

Judge calls outbursts or “intervention the court proceedings.”
The passes oi working
people (the employed and un—
employed Black and poor expressed people) can see fur
they than that. And those who
cannon and/or those who are
confused about it all can now
see the real reasons fashion

and speaks in behalf of his

then the constitutional right to

the grant. Klein expressed
”agreement” at this cons

bringing the Gap: College Man at 42
By Steve Otto
Poker»faced and suffering, a
gathering of Englishmen stated
up at their renewable mayor,
Thomas Middleton, who had
come 10 give a speech at the
cold, daily medication ceremony of a newlyrbuilt schoolhouse. At one corner of the
structure, someone had shipped
out the date: 1651.
Middleton’s frequency didn’t
star in a n y hearts that
day, but he entered one line
that struck a note of import
tality in the townspeople's beds
dining ears: “A man is never
too old to learn!"
Evidence that this magic is
just as true today as it was
in 1651 can be found at the
Grinnell College physics workshop.
There, meeting out from behind a network of multicolored
wires and tubes, 'is the face of
Charles pierce. Pierce, at 42,
is one of the few men of the
age who has successfully
bridges the generation gap
without the aid of a heard or
long hair. His formula: “Become a student!” And as a
Grinnell College student, he
extends six hours of class a
week and holds down a full“
time job as the college‘s physics technician. With a blair for
reading schematics programs
and explanation notes from
college processors, he fits right
in.
Born and raised near Brooklyn, Iowa, Pierce comes from
a “family of large families” as
he puts it He has five sisters
and one brother, “None of us
started very far from home,”
he says. “My brother, who
lives further away than the
rest of us, besides in selling."
Pierce’s mother has 29 grandchildren, and seven of them
belong to Pierce. His children
are garcia, 15, there, 14, Steven, 12, sydney, 10, Jon, 6,
Curtis, 3, and Jodi, almost 2.
As if seven children women’t
enough, he went out and got
himself a little league baseball
team which he coaches in the
summer. Even seven children,
the little league baseball team,
and 20 years away irbm school
have not trained his energy
and desire to learn. He extends
an astronomy class and a math
class right along with students
22 years his junior.
He has an insatiable authority, which has undoubtedly been
an asset in his rather unusual
line of work. Specifically, his
work involves setting up various experiments and concentrations for physics classes,
keeping the physics department’ vast store of indicate
equipment in proper working
order, and even building a few
integrate pieces of physics
equipment himself when processors require it He recently
completed a spectroscope, an
optical device used for forming
light special for study,
If you are saying to yourself, “That type of Work sounds
as if it might get complicated
at times," you're right. For
someone who has had no for
may education in electronics or
physics —— and who didn’t know
a methods ray tube from an
era when he first started —
Pierce gives a good account of
himself.
Catch him lifetime
conversation with a college
physics professor, and you’ll
have a tough time trying to
decide which gentleman is
supposed to have a string of
letters after his name. The
press rely on him for all types
of general information and ads
vice, His excellent background
as a mechanism and mechanic
combined with What he has
learned in the past two years
as a physics technician make
him a good reference source.
But he scores when referred
to as “really, quite a bright
fellow." “You can learn a lot,”
he notes, “by osmosis e simply according what you see.”

is a spouse for physics facts,

Between classes, 42-year—old Charles Pierce
sets up experiments for concentrations by
Grinnell physics processors. While he has no
formal education in electronics or physics, he
hopes to complete Grinnell‘s college level
physics courses. He has been coordinator of
the technical aspects of the Physics Dept. for
the past two years.
 
as a large operator in the Viking Pump Cu, at Cedar Falls,
and until three years ago was
an automobile mechanic at a
Grinnell garage. He came to
the attention of Grinnell College in 1967 when he was a 116'
troleum delivery salesman for
the Gulf Oil Co. His many
skills made him an attractive
candidate for the job as the
college’s physics technician.
His only degree is that he
didn’t find this job 20 years
corner so he could have continued his education. From his
point of View, education is a
serious matter, ”not merely
because it helps you get a better job, but also because it’s
important for a person to be
knowledgeable in many different fields.” he says.
He’s teaching his children to
be “service linked,” which he
defines as “thinking about careers like nursing or teaching.
All of us have generated from
others’ services,“ he points out,
“so I try to express upon my
children that it is important for
us to return some of this service.”
Being a 42-year-old college
student does have its proc
less. “You can forget a lot in
20 years,” he says, 0f the two
courses he is now taking, math
is the more difficult for himr
He says that things are moving a little fast for him “I feel
I need some expectations that
the other students don't,” he
explains, “but I can't see holding up the rest of the class because of my own entertainment.
Besides," he says, “shopping
the course this semester just
means starting it again next.”
shipping behind a little dress’t
compliance his life much. “At
42, grades don't make a whole
lot of difference," he says, It’s
obvious that he‘s satisfied with
just being able to go back to
school, an opportunity few
middleaged people get or take.
Pierce was at first apprehensive about taking the job with
Grinnell College. But then he
thought of the tuition-free education the college offers faculty
and staff children, anti, from
that moment on, the matter
was settled. He calculated that
it would cost him a little over
$84,000 to put all seven of his
children through School. While
a physics technician‘s salary
is nothing to sleeve at, he felt
that his bank account probably
would not survive the blow
He enjoys working with the
students and faculty in the
physics department and feels
there is less pressure on him
in this type of work. “As a mechanic, you could do a job
right and still have an unhappy customer," he details. holidays, he can more or less dee
code his own work schedule,
which has to be juggled around
classes and study hours.
One thing is for sure, however. He'll never have to face
another breast automobile engine or pussy tool box in his
new line of work. Well, almost
never; he just had to excuse
himself —— to go show a fresh»
man student in introductory
physics how to use an testament called a socket french.
