noted authority on the history

transportation.
“As a boy I lived near an airport which is probably where I
first became crazy about air-
lanes. I made model planes
out of false, too. In 1934 I saw
a demonstration by Al Williams,
one of the best automatic pilots

an article entitled “The Last

describes the plane and some

During the war canyon was

“People think that their description of an event is an account surely of what is there,"
red'asked visiting lectures Kenneth Burke. "Actually a the<
vendors amount of the description is merely carrying out
the application of terms.”
Burke, a noted literary crisis, contents that the nature of
terminology determines the nature of observation; that "certain terms will lead you one
way, other terms will lead another way."
.The determination feature of
language was a theme of his
dialogue in Heaven which had
its premiere Sunday evening at
Grinnell.
“This was not written to be
performed,’ connected Burke.
“It was more an animation of
a Platonic dialogue, made to
be read with the eye. The dialogue is enough on the edges
of drama to be performed,
but in a dialogue the purpose
is to get the sentences said»
to explain a theory. In a drama the sentences further the
action.”
Burke continued, “It was
after charmingly. The whole
company did a fine job. Watching it was rather housing for
me since I’m used to featuring,
in which you’re responsible for
everything. That time 1. could
sit back and let others take on
the main responsibility.”
Besides creating his own drama — dialogue, stories, and
poems, Burke has translated
works of other authors, totally
Thomas Mann All Mann‘s letters to the literary magazine
Dial were translated by Burke
and the first English translation of Mann’s “Death in Venice" was Burke's mandatory.
He detailed, “I had done a
translation of “beach in Venice”
for myself, just because i
loved it, and had put it away.
At that time I was affiliated
with Dial magazine, and the
editor called from Europe that
they had secured rights to
translate Mann’s "Death in
Venice" into English. As soon
as I saw that, I told the staff
that I could bring in a trans»
nation the next day!”

of cross forms
the discussion was opened to
the whole group.
It w a s mentioned that
freshmen are impressionable,
and that “hall spirit" seems
to s p r e a d continuously
throughout a freshman form.
While their enthusiasm often
leads to construction projects,
freshmen sometimes may influence each other not; to
study. The “liabilities influence” of upperclass women
might be beneficial for freshmen, -
Some upperclass girls felt
freshman exuberance might
benefit the unintegrated calls,
Others, however, were afraid
freshmen might tend to be exclusively noise.
In Cleveland and James, the
calls currently integrated, there
is a maximum of six freshmen
on a floor, and these girls sometimes seem to be cut off from
other members of their class.
With total integration of women's calls the needs for an immediate friendship group and
for individual privacy might
both be met.
The physical problem was important to upperclass girls too.
They felt it affair that freshmen might be placed in desirable rooms such as the connecting singles in Read, while two
seniors might have to share one
of the tiny douglas in Main.
Marie suggested that the
women first consider whether
integrated forms would better
serve their academic, social
and emotional needs, and if
t h e y decide alternatively,
then discuss the physical limitations on the integrated SyS‘
tel.
Hoping to calculate further
discussion on integrated forms,
Marie distributed a brief statement of the major problems to
be considered.

Editorial “Zip" Code
In attempting to are-evaluate the “letters to the
editor” department and establish a norm for letter
publication in the year to come, two things require
primary consideration. First, such a department is of
very little value unless it is a weekly presentation of
quality contributions, Second, the problem of keeping the department going demands responsibility on
the part of both the S&B and its readers.
The problem of keeping a steady stream of letters
ﬂswing into the editor’s office is continuing both upon
reader interest in campus issues and the journalistic
integrity of the editor with regard to all letters submitted.
In 1964 it will be our practice to print those letters
which the college situation seems relevant or of in—
forest. We will not allow preceding or personal opinion
to color our choice of letters for this department. The
“letters to the editor" column should exist as one of
reader opinion, and not of editorial opinion.
It seems especially important to stress the fact
that a prerequisite for publication in the “letters” column dress’t necessarily mean that a letter must criticism or complete. Letters of praise for some event or
person, letters of agreement on some issue, or letters
of evaluation concerning some campus discussion are
just as much a part of any good ”letters" department
as are letters of criticism.
Although it is impossible at times to print every
letter submitted to the S&B, each letter submitted
will either be printed or acknowledged by a personal
letter from the editor explaining why it was not used.
The ”letters to the editor” department is open,
then, to you our readers Last week we stated that it
would exist as an open forum for opinion, discussion,
and debate. We have stated here that every effort will
be made on this side of the editor’s desk to maintain a
readers’ opinion department of quantity and quality.
The rest is up to you,
