Student Action
Grinnell has been alive this week in a way that is en—
comparing to sec. There has been debate and resolution,
much confusion and sound v ry courageous decisions and
action. If the world outside looks discouraging and tracker
perhaps than ever before in the history of banking, Grin—
hell’s activity and the marketing of the American student
is significant as a slnall ray of hope and some testimony
to the fact that perhaps there are still some qualities to be
found between and beneath the lines and lines of unified
facts.
of all the very fine relating we heard in the scripts, there was one point of View which is still a fingering
incongruity to this week of marketing, Even after the
Grinnell College Senate last year set the president 01‘ john
ing the NSA, and becoming one of its least active members,
even after a protest was registered against the U2 india
(left, several members of the Senate are still cleaning long,
hard and strong for Senate isolationism.
The argument which seems most political, is one which
might be called the argument for specialization. That is,
that students ill the Senate should be restricted to a nalu
row line of thinking and legislation defined very narrowly
by the words “student life.”
Student life may be interpreted in two ways. It may
lie construct to mean simply concern over the warnings
of code machines, milk machines, Grinnell concerts and what
have you on the Grinnell campus, or it may be construct
to mean anything which will effect the student ill all im-
>bryant way,
It is interesting to note that even though Senators
Capehart and Humphrey were not in agreement with stands
taken by the senate resolution. they felt that student action in a democratic system was of primary importance.
Students should try to snake themselves heard.
Petition, in itself, is something 01’ a show of Faith in
the American systems It is when we begin to be so very
sure that we will not be heard and that we have nothing
to say, that our system of government is in grave leonard .
Part of being a student is contributing our knowledge and
opinions to the world about us -
Furthermore, it is becoming more and more
apparent that in this crisis-time there are very
few things that happen in the world which do not directly
or indirectly effect the student. Strontium 90 in the atmosphere will strike the student, the national and’oi'
world citizen, it will not be selective. Student activity is
{will-important today. We must act, and we must act in a
courageous and united fashion if we are to be heard.
Thirteen Travelers
Thirteen people will travel to Washington this week
for a three day visit in hope of crossing student opinion :1—
against the assumption of nuclear testing in the atmosphere
Regardless of how you may feel about the issue itself, it
seems important only to remind the student body that it
is this sort of action which must be considered of a noble
and courageous nature.
regardless of final effectiveness, the effort itself is one
to be advised, because it shows that the American student
is finally leaving the provincialism of his own small backyard and featuring out to take his place as a contributions
citizen of the world.

These are truly times which

Steve Aldrich
To the Editor:
These are something times _
times, indeed, which burden people’s souls, Perhaps this explains
the fact that so many people
are going apr on the question
or peace.
Peace is won, it at all, by
those who are patient, quiet and
pop-covering, not by demagogucs,
not by wild sacrifices, but by
measured activity.
Therefore, let us who want
peace, be not so bold as to sit
on Kennedy’s lawn, or to rally
all to the cause oi peace,
Let us begin by winning peace
within ourselves, This means
courage and cominittinent to
ourselves, our follows, and our
God.

The recent action oi the Student Senate in resulting to impose
the assumption oi atmospheric nuclear testing is undoubtedly one
that raises questions in many minds, Yet, it is so totally and
typically sustainable that it demands the support oi the principal
student body as a whole.
In the list place, it is evident
from the remarks of the Deputy
Secretary at Defense. russell pediatric, that we are now in a
position to death' v Soviet Russia and indeed the whole world
with our present .tockpile of atomic weapons
Why then. the question prices, must we engineer health and i
create pensions by testing atomic weapons we do not need? Are
we so various that we feel we must “keep up with the courses"
even in the held at atomic testing?
What good are a billion senators of boobs it the 28,000
senators we now have are more than sufficient to make a june
oral pal'o of the entire working'.7
The explanation oi some that we are attempting to perfect
a “Clean neutral bomb” and that
this is the reason [or the testing
is not in itself' a logical argument.
We do not know ii this is the purpose oi the proposed tests
or how many “dirty” tests would be required to perfect a clean
bomb. Furthermore, regardless oi what type of tests are conduct—
ed, an unhealthy increase in world pensions is bound to result.
lt, however, we wish for a moment to be surely spanish let
us consider the direct oi a assumption of tests on the world at
large, The reaction oi the other nations ol the world can only
be that the Unltcd States is little better than the Soviet Union.
We will lose not only the respect oi some oi the nations com—
fitted to our cause, but we also will engineer our position with
respect to the neutral countries of Asia and africa who are fast
becoming disillusioned with our
lack of principle.
The assumption of atomic testing then will not only hurt us,
but lose the respect that we have gained by thus far not follow-
ing the lesbians.
In iaet there exists no good reason for reducing atomic testing. On the,control'y, We Will only hurt ourselves and the world
by an action inspired out of fear instead of reason.
Ray onsticld
To the Editor: ,
On Thursday, November 2, 1
brought before the Senate the
resolution in opposition to a r e
question oi nuclear atmospheric
testing by the United States. At
that time the Senate voted 24719
to delay consideration or the
issue.
At that meeting I also made
a statement concerning the res
caution. This statement has been
concerned as exclusively eco<
signal, unique and based on prejudlce rather than on fact.
It could well be that people
have been emotional on this
issue. But after all it is an eco—
signal issue, Radioactivity in—
,rules human beings and radioactivity may Wall take its toll
in lives. What )5 my evidence?
Others, besides minus mailing,
have made statements cancer<
ing the rangers oi interactive
balloon. A United Nations report says, “An estimated total
oi 25,000 to 150,000 cases oi l'due
media will ultimately occur, if
tests are stopped in 1953, from
tests already held . . . An eStl<
rated total ot up to 100,000
genetic defects will occur over
subsequent years from tests 314
ready held.” (Table ll, page 42,
UN Report on Radiation).
As regards Carbon—lo, a red
port prepared by the Atomic
Energy commission concluded
that bomb tests to Sept. 1958,
would cause 100,000 gross
physical or mental defects,
350,000 cases oi stillbirths and
childhood deaths, and 900,000
cases at embryonic and leone—
tax deaths from this cause
alone (“The Biological Hazard
to Man of Carbon-ll brown Nuclear Weapons").
Nobody knows for certain
exactly what the effects of radiation are, But there is more
than substantial evidence oi
plastic consequences indeed.
It is important that every Student on this campus understands
What this resolution is not. It
is not a proposal for unilateral
enlargement. it does not in any
way concern underground test
ing. And no, it does not “are
date training to Moscow on our
hands and trees."
We must understand the historical context in which the
United States decision to test
or not to test will be made. it
will occur in the first of a very
touchy Berlin situation. Secretary of State Rusk has called
the Berlin situation one oi toward estimation. toward estimation oi tear, at challenge and
ot threats. The Soviet Union has
decided to continue this esca1a<
tion. What will ours be?
Several members or the Senate
tried a assumption ot tests on'
the ground that the United
States could perfect an antimicsle middle and in so doing improve the defensive capacity oi
the US, But these persons also
said that it would take four
years to perfect such a device.
In the next tour years, ,
worlds't you rather see some
real steps taken toward achiev—
ing universal peace? Or would
you rather see each side
builder a system or defensive
devices which would make
them more willing than ever
to hurt incentives, challenges
ultimatiims back and forth?
Last week Nikita Khruschev
was quoted as saying that the
Soviet Union is now finished
with tests and will stay finished
until and unless the United States
tests and will stay finished un—
begins testing. 1 do not think
that there is a person on this

night in Cowles lounge between
SGA president Bill panama and
Cowles freshman Phil Johnson.‘
The debate, somewhat improving, was witnesses by almost 10
men.
Johnson, speaking for the negative. emphasized that by its
decision, the Senate had village
ed the preamble of the SGA
Constitution, which states that
the SGA ”shall administer and
translate rules containing to those
aspects at student life not

By acting in this way, the Sena

rights by using both its influence and its money (which in
part belongs to the minority)
for interviews and press conferences, while the minority has
no chance to do so.
