Throwing housewares'es
Society has several focuses for hanging on to workout tradition — among them statement and reflect. But
when statement becomes a conference, one hopes that
necessity and practicality will take over. Such it should
be in the case of campus house parties.
Every year the ivy-covered angels of Grinnell College living are posted off again and the housewares
years its faithful head. Each house on campus is admitted
a sum of money to carry out its social obligations; student representatives are chosen within calls to spend
that money. It is traditionally assumed that a major
portion of the pocketbook must go for the semester earliest which less than half the hall residents will attend
and toward which a much smaller percentage will contribute any time or effort.
South Campus has recognized, to some extent, the
social evaluation that house party opposition brings
about. Last year the majority of women’s calls scheduled one such party, rather than the normal two, and
attempted to spend the money on more original and re-
.warning social events.
‘ But on North Campus, house councils begin each
year as they did the last — making plans for the {all
housewares. It is time for campus social leaders on both
sides to re-evaluate the housewares system in their
calls and to make active plans to take this featuring
there of northwest activity from under the campus social skin,
When houseparties are planned each resident will
be represented in the expenditure column, but as many
as half the hall members will never benefit from this
expense by actually attending the event, Money allocated to the balls is meant for each individual and all
efforts should be made to spend it as such. Although
each hall contains residents that would not attend any
event planned, there is a defining need for ste-evaluation
concerning how many are really interested in finding
dates to attend the two annual houseparties.
Even more frequent than the non~attended is the
hall member who site back and wants for the social
chairman to “throw the party.” He won’t lift a finger
throughout all the planning and decorating procedure,
yet once the crime paper has tagged and the quad is
locked, his tries of complaint are loud. No handbook
states that the social chairman are elected as sole party
rivers. If this is the case in your hall, the best place
to throw your party would be right out the lounge window.
Grinnell’s limited physical environment has been
more than worn out during the decades of party plan-
king on campus. and the modern social chairman is al-

Letters to the Editor
Kohlmah Views North Campus attitude, Hall System
The 1964 engagement is now
over and I suppose much will
he women about it by students
and faculty who attended,
However, as I understand it, its
main purpose was to serve as a
vehicle of communication be
green students and faculty~administration. Thus the expressions that it made on students
who did not attend is of pro»
mary importance to its goal.
As such a student, I write this
letter.
It would seem that the major
issue is that ol the attitude on
North Campus, and what steps
should be taken to make the
climate more conducted to the
educational goals oi the college
community. It is argued that
the attitude on North Campus
is such that discussions of
rules, social life. and sexual
activities nominated or completely excluded discussions
that would lead to intellectual
challenges. This, I feel, is only
half true, and I would hope
that at the engagement this
was discovered. The charts
concerning the directive habits
of Smith, Clark, or Langan, in
 
an attempt to start a Water
tight. is longer and travels much
further than a discussion of
Shakespeare, Most of the faculty was aware of the water
fight, few were aware of the
discussion. This is not to say
that absent charts can be ex
closed because intellectual discussion occasionally does take
place, or that North Campus is
anywhere near its educational
value capacity. Rather that
both horseplay and academic
discussion can, should, and do
exist side by side on North
Campus. However, not enough
of the latter does exist, and this
is caused mainly by a his
directed attitude. An attitude
which generally runs along the
lines of once I cross rights
Avenue i can forget about study
les and blow steam via the low
and often Violent humor that
has become an obvious part of
North Campus.
The next step is what do we
do to change this attitude, so
as not necessarily to exclude
horseplay, but to place more
emphasis on an exchange of
ideas. 1, myself, at this time,
 
Fresh Look at Upperclassmen:
Finds Luck of security There
Dear Editor:
As an incoming freshman, a
great disappointment has overcome me. Where are the mature. responsible upperclassmen? The college catalog lists
one of the major objectives of
the college as developing “cow
sciousness of social responsible»
its” and "service to his halloween.” Is the pricing program
man’s ,social responsibility?
Are beatles a service to his halloween? Is the freshman showing concern for his compared
through dirty telephone greetings? The answer is obvious.
This immaturity is found in
other aspects of upperclassmen
behavior. Take, for instance.
the library. And it seems some-
one is. piece by piece. Why
were the Innocent freshmen re
quoted to sign pledge cards
while the Guilty upperclassmen were not? Consider also
the true purpose of the library
and its actual role on campus
A library is a place to gain
knowledge, but nursing is a
place to gain something else.
15 “What are you doing tonight, honey?" an academic
question.
By pointing out this immaturity. I hope the upperclassmen will recognized their attitudes, and I call upon my own
class to lead them in establishing a new, mature cons
sciousness.
Sincerely
A sad freshman
 
ways related to look beyond the Iowa cornfields for
a new and better site, An off-campus housewares can be
 
great fun, but wondering over the hills and rivers of
Iowa just for the sake of finding ah off—campus site
because “that’s what the guys want” is impractical. The
problems of transportation, decorative, women’s hours,
and food transfer are often reflected until the plans are
well under way and the party starts to fall apart before
it ever begins. What might have started out as a dangerous idea on paper, becomes nothing but integrating
fact once the party day arrives.
Each semester the social activity calendar is overcrowded with events. Yet four week-ends must be
set aside so that the housewares schedule can run its
course. It would seem that houseparties more out their
welcome on campus some time ago, and what exists
now is more an obligation maintenance project rather
than a desired program. We would suggest that if
a housewares can’t be run by a full-house for a full-
house that the deck be reshuffled and some new deals ‘
made.
LD
 
“Am not about to propose an
answer. Because of this, my directions to what I consider an
extreme proposal may be weekends.
l believe that the complete
regarding of the hall system
would be a mistake. First of all
as already established and Orv
managed subgroups of North
Campus they could be employed as portable units in the
process of residential the general North Campus attitude.
Here are already organized
house councils or larger groups
that the administration could
meet with. They further reprev
sent a vehicle for a unique social system that neither universities nor directories can
match. They are not so independent of each other that
friendships and interactive of
ideas do not span their bound- ,
tries. On the other hand, they
are interpreted enough so that
they can serve as the basis for
a social life. It should be 1‘?
-measured that South Campus
does not have to serve as a center for social functions. A less
important attribute of the hall
system is the intramural pro‘
gray which is so important
to our Physical Education Program. This of course is a minor
issue, but Should not be over<
looked. We happen to have a
strong and Worthwhile athletic
program which would be beautifully changed by a switch to a
directory system.
There are of course many
businesses to the hall system.
Perhaps they have become overly interpreted. The familiar
its one acquired after living
four years with the same group
may to a certain extent dp
for the exchange of ideas. who
social life they promote may
cause unnecessary [regulations
with some of its members.
Worst of all their introvertedness might very well breed this
anti-academic attitudes
None the less, the hall seo
tel is a unique situation which
Grinnell can and should be
proud of. Faced with the choice
between a well-run hall system
and a well-run directory system, I would prefer the hall
system. Further. there is. of
course, no assurance that a
switch to a directory system
would actually solve any of the
North Campus problems. It is
easy to say that the directory
system on paper looks better
than the hall system as it is,
but don’t forget that on paper
the hall system looks pretty
good. Especially the fact that
it represents portable unit!
through change, if needed, can
be promoted.

The fifty five student leaders,

It was 'a'weekend which was
filled with a large number of
hours of disciplines discussion,
creative thinking, and frank
meetings of minds in areas
which are of vital concern for
the Grinnell College community.
A composite of what emerald
from the weekend can best be
described as an understood
concept of that community.
Such a concept emerald from
six discussion groups—each concentration its efforts in a specific area, but from time to
time, by design and necessity.
featuring out of its narrow combines into the general area of
the college taken as a whole entity.
One discussion group considered the address “A Game of
Numbers dedicated” which Dru
Howard women delivered to the
college before his designation
as president last June. Starting
with the basic philosophies of
education or this speech, which
would provide for more independent work, thus teaching the
student how to execute himself,
 
this particular discussion group
considered the relevance and
possibility of a tutorial system
and more independent study at
Grinnell College,
another group considered
Grinnell as a preparation for
graduate school and the business worlds They discussed
such things as the academic
community which places a professional emphasis upon graduate study and the Vocational
alternatives which printer‘l
readily represents its students,
concerning that the liberal arts
education is valuable in itself,
the group suggested that not
only theacademic, but the social atmosphere of Grinnell is
relevant to preparation for
whichever path may be followed
by a student after he receives
his diploma,
Student lrresponsibility was
the problem encountered by
another discussion group. Considering such specifics as the
library theft rate. quiet hours
problems, and illegal visits of
women to men’s rooms, this
group arrived at a president
attitude (among students)—
lack of involvement in the community. The objectives of the
college were seen as being able
to give the best liberal arts edt»
nation possible, and necessarily, giving students as much
freedom as possible However,
the group emphasized that the
secondary objective must not
infringe upon the primary academic one.
Still another group considered
the attitude of the various eye<

are represented by the rules, It
sought to increase and improve
the amended of communication
in order to trade some of the
president misunderstandings
in this area.
Another group considered the
extra classroom activities of the
entire college year, and suggested improvements which
would increase the benefit of
these events for the entire college community.
A sixth discussion group considered the role of Student Government within the whole framework of the college. Seeing two
functions of student got’t—to
handle those responsibilities
properly generated to the stud

officials of the college in mat<

mixed the present structure of
student government to be inadequate for these purposes.
It began to suggest means and
plans for revision of the structure. t
At present it is impossible to
predict how much effect on the
campus the weekend will have
had, it did have some effect

courses in the future.
Mrs. savings concerned of
learning as a lifelong process.
“I learn so much from and
with the students, sometimes I
think of myself as a senior colleague."
She believes learning is a continued striking towards wisdom.
and that wisdom includes “the
integration of emotional and in»
teliectuai responses.” She explained, “So often we know
intellectually that a thing is
right or true, but we have difficulty in accepting it continually. We move toward this goal
of integration as we learn from
our own experiences and from
the ideas and experiences of
those who have lived in the
past.”

Late in the second quarter

‘ By Dick lovely
Despite the gay pageantry and exuberant support
which the Grinnell College community provided for
its football team last Saturday, the Pioneers lost 25-14
to a good, but certainly not acceptable simon team; A
postposted might be in the office, but I’m sure that
‘ every “If they would only have . . .” and ”Why the
hell didn’t he . . .” possible has been dealt with in North
campus younger, faculty homes, and the union, as well
» as in Mr, powers’ office. What could I add?
Among things which might cause Grinnell fans to
hope for better features ahead were the fourth quarter
_ passing of “number" Anderson many good ball carry-
ing efforts (especially by boston powers) and unspectacular, but solid line play by the likes of penny joe
merit, Jeff Lewis, and Larry Miller. Miller was injured
and will be out a couple of weeks His loss will be felt
but good depth should ease the burden.
Coach Young has really had the rug pulled out
from under a potentially great cross country team with
several unexpected personnel losses. Look for the return of Paul batteries plus a lot of greeting work to'
pay off later this season.

printers Face Knox saturday
By newton Clymer
The Pioneers, off to a shake
start last Saturday against depending champions simon, hope’
to get oil on the right look this
Saturday, when they meet Knox
on Ward field.
On paper. the Pioneers have
the edge. They have more experience, and a larger squad.
Knox, coaches by Al martin, is
a young team. counting mainly
on the strength of tour sophomores. All four were outstand»
ing last year as freshmen. ,
If they come through in the
church, the Siwash could be
tough. They are definitely
stronger than last year, and
their line operates 205 lbs. compared to Grinnell's 199 lbs. BeSIdes a strong line, the Siwasll
have more depth in the fairfield than they had last year.
Despite th e improvement,
Knox sellers from a relatively
small team. There are only 25
 
members on the variety squad.
Coach add powers of the
Pioneers thinks Knox may be
a dark horse this year, despite
their 1070 loss last .week w
Beloit. He plans to make a few
changes in the linear, which
he hopes will strengthen the
Pioneers. Morgan Michel will
probably be in the linear as on
website center. and Barry An.
person will likely see more
action this game. ‘
Larry Miller will be out for
the Knox game, perhaps for
the following Week also. RF:
placing Miller at guard will be
either Rick Anderson or,Skip
Weyrauch.
Coach powers is previously
optimistic about the outcome.
He expects to see a strong passing attack from the Siwaslh, and
thinks that, in Order to Win. the
team must develop a stronger
mental attitude toward the
game. ,
Langham will be at feedback.
