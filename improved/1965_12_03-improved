Washington Demonstration Boasts
Both boards and Mothers in Protest
By BOB HDDIERNE
As concentrations with 25,00050,000 people go, last Saturday’s
Peace March in Washington Was—
n’t much to “write home aboutr"
Or at least on the surface it
Wasn’t much.
The march was well organized,
smoothly run and easily endedwhich removed most at the typical news attractions such as rights,
mass artists and other similar
disturbances. The match was so
well run and the demonstration
so well disciplines that even a
determined group oi counterrdemr
moderators could not get anything
started. George lincoln Rockwell
did jump due matches who was
carrying a diet long flag, and
several or his colleagues tried
much the same thing out they
were all quickly called away and
then ignomtniously lined a mere
ten dollars and set tree.
The Washington policeLno notices when it comes to this sort
of thing—must be given tremendous credit for the patient, almost
countries way in which they can-
(died the partners. They know all
the tricks of handling clouds.
But just as important in maintaining order were tlhe “marshall"
oi the participating organizations
—marked by orange arm bands—
who kept the clouds moving—a
Washington ground talking‘ who
otherwise assisted the police in
maintaining a substance Di order.
All or this surface probability
on the part of the partners is
 
somewhat receiving, however. Among their ranks were at least
three distinct sections all fighting
to gain control at the socalled
Peace Movement. The groups—
closely identified—Were a moderators left wing section, a basically left wing fraction and the Southern delegation, the civil rights
people whose support is being
sought.
At the convention which was
held in Washington most at the
week proceeding the actual demo
institute, these groups [ought
opened, often to the point of
wrestling matches for the telephone. or the three groups, the
civil rights people were the least
interested, In fast, they were
down right cold about the whole
idea at getting involved in a move
ment that would “use" them
more than "aid” them. So while
the radical and moderate groups
taught between themselves they
also were lighting to keep the
southern delegation interested,
telling the southern delegation that®
they were all bound together by
a common interest in “self-determinatlion.”
On a somewhat different level,
the differences within tlhe movement were readily visible just by
watching the crowd Saturday. lt
ranked mm the usual learned,
longrnaired “heads” to ministers
in conventional, conservative
suits, to middleaged nations carrying signs asking to have their
"boys" hack home.

A Tradition . .
o
It's a tradition that each new editor a given his first
chance at editorial power »— set forth his views of and plans‘
for tale newspaper. Essentially I'm an iconoclast, a conscious
malcontent, and rebel in the face of such a dramatic tradition.
However, after careful consideration of several factors,
I have decided to write that same editorial. I came to this
decision, by the way, when I observed the ten inch empty
space in the upper left hand corner of this page and realized
I didn’t want to talk about hall representation (and neither do
many other people, SGA included), I didn’t want to talk about
publishing finals (I don’t think about finals let alone talk about
them), and I didn’t want to talk about student apache. I just
coupon’t work up the energy to talk about that last one.
To the point: I don’t think you're going to see any searching changes in the 8&3, John has worked up a pretty good
staff, has a fairly smooth operation going. Why should I rock
the boat? There are some small technical matters where we
will differ. I, for example, will probably use larger headline
sizes. Essentially, however, we are in agreement about news
papers and so you will see no purse, no great reception.
What are you likely to see? You are likely to see a greater interest in schools other than Grinnell. You may see a noticeable increase in concern about things that happen outside
of our sequestered little printer box on the prairie. You may,
in fact, find an editor who is quite bored with things that have
concerned campaigning editors of the bygone days. I’m not
likely to become upset about SGA elections and the like. I
might be included to be more upset if a program that stood a
chance of really doing or accomplishing something failed.
Like the Des points project — as a random example 0r like
the LeMoyne exchange program a for another.

integral Says Spending for NSA
ls Legitimate Function for SGA
To the Editor:
Paul Thurston presented an interesting personal appraisal of the
Des points Project in last week’s
see. He implied in his letter, how
ever, that the $250 extended _annually for Grinnell's affiliation
with the National student Association and for implementation of
NSA programs on campus comes
from "money allocated for social
purposes." I would like to clarity
the exact financial nature ot printer College’s relationship with
the NSA.
Using the academic year 1965»
1966 as a permanent example, of the
$2,600 comprehensive fee paid by
each Gn’nncu student, $50 was ear
marked as an activity fee. From
that $50, the Grinnell Student So.
dial coordination Committee re»
served 521 {or the implementation
of its various campus social programs. The remaining 323 of the
activity fee was shared by the
men's and women's residence
calls, the student publications, the
forum, the student auditor and
the Student Government estonia
tion. it was from the student got»
element’s total apartment of $1,630,
or approximately one dollar wild a
half out or each student's activity
fee, that the Student Senate decided to budget 3250 for Grinnell’s
sent money allocated for social
purposes; it came from student
money allocated for the operation
of the Student Government Association.

it is i'fleet‘ interesting, in the
light ot eiirront medications on the
part oi directory ot defense lilo
Namai'a that our group commitments in diet Nam will soon be
increased, to take iiotc oi a recent
statement by Secret y of State
Rusk at Rio De Janeiro as to the
nature ol our commitment in diet
Nam. According to an AP article
which appeared in the Des points
Register, Secretary Rusk defined
our commitment as ﬁlm oi prev
ing to the columnists that wars
oI generation are bound to be tin»
successful, and that, “When that
type of aggressive is turned back,
as it will be, then the clouds of
war will begin to desperate and
men will be able to look ahead
with confidence and hope."
There is explicit in this statements a commitment on the part
of the United States to combat
these “wars or generation" where»
over they occur on the grounds
that they are all part of a long-run
strategy for global nomination
which his bcoii iorniuloted in Pe-t
king oi Moscow. This might or;
seen as logic extension oi the.
containment policy calculated bye
Gcoigc Kclinan in the immediate;
po an era but it is not it iii
more increasing accessibility of oi
comiiiitinciit in diet Nam and out i
general commitment to ultimately'
discrete the theory of world nomination through “wars or libero
tion" which is evident in a further
statement by Rusk that “the iiitegrity of the American govcri
men at stnirc in the outcome
or our present policy.
It is the belief of this writer
that the Clliicnl. commitment as
defined by Rusk (and thus sun
poverty the administration), is too
general to he sustained. and thus
is unrealistic. Victory in diet Nam
may not, in sexuality, result in a
destination of the clouds of war.
The present failure of the United
States policymakers to district»
hate between indigenous nationalist resolutions and global “‘Cum»
nudist conspiracy” is likely to assure our continued participation in
wars of the Vietnamese type for
years to come.
The neighboring nations in
Southeast Asia are not lnvulnerable to the kind or upheaval which
is being experienced by South diet
Nam. As the process of economic
development accessories and the
impact of modern industrial terminology makes itself incrcusiiigiv
felt in these areas, they become
more sustainable to the kind or
social unless which gives rise to
resolutions. It is not important
whether these resolutions are presented by making or not, what is
important is the ivay Washington
views them. If we continue to view
all national interventions in which
columnists are participating as
being directed by making then we
are committed, according to the
above statements by Rusk, to con.
windows intervention and blood;shed around the globe. Whether
or not this kind or interference in
other nations' business is right or
not is not at issue hero The point

Pfiisch courts-Soccer Void:
places Disinferest. Finances
By DICK CHADY
There was no soccer team this
year because Grinneli apparently
packs the players, the coach, and
the money to support one,
In a recent interview, Direcwr
of Athletics John deutsch explains
ed the combination of factors that
led the department to certain the
sport in 1965.
In the first place, “we didn't
have the kind or interest to workforce message into thinking of the
program as a going concern."
Turn-out for the team was high
when Grinnoll began the sport in
1961, but with proceeding years
“it became more 01' a struggle to
get numbers to participate,"
deutsch calculated that interest
may have been higher in the first
years because of a number or students from the East who had
played before,
However, last year a freshman
team could not be filled, and part
of the variety was requested by
coach Simone 1mm his swimming
team. This year Simone is on
leave, and another coach would
have to be found,
The decrease in playerrinterat
and Simone's absence both occurred at a time when a reduced
athletic budget directed a reduction in activities.
When the department received
a cut of about $1400, it was decided to restrict activities in one
area, instead of aCrDSSvthstaYd,

This year an artificial cpuﬂ

Previous Grinnell teams had at
compete with either the very good
or the very bad. force schools
such as theatre, MaoMurray, and
Lake Forest had well-established
programs in the sport, while most
of the Iowa schools maintained on,ly clubs.
kirk Baay, who was a maritime coach and reserve for the
Club this year, feels “it was a
had time for us to drop out." He
said that there is a growing in»
latest in soccer and that four or
ﬁve schools in the Midwest Con—
defence now have teams.
Baay noted that even with I
rough schedule, the Pioneers had
a record of 22-7-1 in four years
or competition. He believes that
ii the sport is re-institutes on a
team basis there will be sufficient
interest to maintain a good program.
deutsch said he also favors “a
broad program" and that the
primary reason for the lack of a
team is ﬁspecial. But he also
feels that. a successful team will
require "a real promoted to re
credit players."

With counts to Knox, plymouth
The Pioneer basketball team
will be showing some new faces
this weekend when the computers
travel to Knox and plymouth for
the season opening, Sophomore

launched a starting position along

.iett grants. matching for the othertwo starting positions are sophomores Greg Rankin, Mike Schwartz and Dick sussex, and leltermen Ted sister and Tom Hill.
Also stated for action are Dick
lovely and Bob Watt.
Knox and plymouth are not
ranked as two of the strong
teams in the conference but both
have many veteran pcttotmets
back this year.
This year coach deutsch has decided to change his offense from
the iastbreak pressing attack at
last year to a more controlled
type. Last year the Pioneers were
able to score but the deleiise and
responding was so weak that the
 
Pioneers could win only time ot
fighters conference games.
The new offense, called the Auburn Shuttle, is designed to let
the team set up for the good shot.
deutsch also hopes this Will allow
the Pioneers to grab more re
sounds, both oltensiveiy and de
festivals, because they will be
able to get better position uncler
the boards,
With the Friday night and Sat—
today atlemoon games throughout: the season last year, deutsch
thought the Pioneers tired out. It
showed at the end of time season,
when the Pioneers were able to
win unity one game out 01 the
final eight.
Ptitscli is happy With the progress oi the team so far, consider»
ing that tour players started late
because 01 football.
The variety beat the ireshmen
last Saturday 7250 to start the
season. Especially impressive for
the trash were Tom Lower, Sam
Semi, and Thor johnson.
