reason, according to President

In an interview this week,

role psychology
We can not applied the empirical stand taken by the
Board of Trustees on whether or not to build a fall-out
shelter at Grinnelll
While it seems likely that no such project will be now
undertaken, it seems that the Board decided its responsibility as an inﬂhence on national opinion when it did not come
out in opposition to the entire shelter program.
Like canyon W. Baldwin, who is military editor of the
New York Times, the more psychology behind fall-out Shel»
term dress’t appeal to us.
Whether or not suppliers will save lives, he points out,
is an open question. The best of the experts disagree on
the immediate effectiveness of a shelter program.
Dr. James Van Allen and other physicians at the State
University of Iowa have stated that “it is extremely dangerous to give the impression to the public that the build—
ing of follows theaters will enable the average citizen to
survive a nuclear attack."
The rangers of such a false promise are two-fold,
according to Baldwin. First, he says, it might create a false
sense of security, contracting us from carrying out projects
which offer greater promise of real occur y. And recently, he points out that such a program, with its assistant
emphasis on radioactivity, would add to the national purchases — “fear of the invisible killer” i which already
landscape our- diplomacy.
From a strategic point of view, according to Dr. J.
David Singer in the October, 1961, Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientist, tale fall-out shelter‘ program “has almost nothing
to offer as a device for reducing the probability of nuclear
attack.” Instead, such a program could increase internal
signal pensions and lead the enemy to believe we are preparing a first strike.
Finally, we agree with Editor Baldwin. “A shelter program cannon be certified on the basis of individual lifesaving, but solely on the basis of national security. And
that is precisely where the present program seems to fail.
It is not worth the $7 billion it would cost or the effort
involved.”
Not so serious
Wednesday's Spring Riot was not the spontaneous and
irresponsible student outburst that rumors and publicity
seem to have labelled its
Student concentrations — especially those of the
springtime variety i are a common insurance on computer
around the country, And not all of them are as wireless
as the one stated here.
The Riot was the product of months of planning by an
artificial student committee, Although the affair had no
authorization from the college, authorities widely saw the
Value of a planned affair controlled by various student
leaders.
Spring concentrations are traditional at Grinnell and
the planned affair was regarded as a substitute for the
potentially dangerous partly raid type of outburst which
has greyed the heads of so many student means on computer
everywhere.
The fact that ten students were fixed may seem to
some to introduce a note of seriousness into the whole
thing. But we are assured that the files resulted only be—
cause the ten failed to ensure that their actions would not
history anyone.
No delicious damage was reflected to property in the
incident. The files were review only because the students
had technically isolated laws which have been caused by
manuals in the past.
Agent X3-5
This week an uncredentialled and unpedigreed stranger
from the Cent ill Intelligence Agency interpreted interested seniors for positions in his organization and revealed
a climate of life on the clock and danger level.
That the mystery man’s written communication with
the college was on plain letter paper is our only virtual
information, but some campus disorders suggested that the
man was master, carried the provincial violin case, used
a portable lie detector on student applicants, shipped out
married means in invisible ink and had as his recruitment
slovak, “Fight Castro : . U-Z can join the CIA." Unfortunately, our cells’s quick departure presented the
S&B from beginning these calculations.

(son President)
This coming Wednesday night
the Student Senate will decide
whether the ‘Grinnell Student
Government Association will
upload last week's decision to
continue its membership in the
National Student Association
(NBA).
The fact that NSA provides
this campus with a potential
source of geneﬁt and that it
costs the students a little over
$300 yearly makes this issue
one ,of the most important to
come before the Senate.
When lGrinnell remained NSA
more than a year ago, after an
absence of several years, the
move was taken in hopes that
certain geneﬁts would accrue to
the school.
irirsi, lGrinnell would be play
ing a role Within the only national organization of college
students, thus providing this
campus, greatly interested in national affairs, with a forum for
its opinions.
recently, the Grinnell campus
could utilize the vast reforms—
signal resources of the NSA,
thereby providing student ol‘gang
stations and individuals with a
ready supplement and impacts
for their interests and projects.
With such geneﬁts in mind,
we cannon term our one year
in let a successful one. Ale
though the National Student
Congress each summer provides
the students of member schools
with n focal point for their
opinions, the structure of the
Congress and the practices of
some member schools are such
that the actual opinions of col—
legs students many times re.
main unknown.
Also, no one can claim that
NSA made u great impression
in campus life in general, Too
few people even realize its ex»
intense, let alone its potential.
I ‘believe this is blue to our
luck of experience in dealing
with such an organization.
Having just remained NSA, it
was difficult to perceive immediately what we were to do
with it.
‘printing that our year of NSA
partnership was not successful,
I would caution against the idea
that continued membership within NSA cannon lee geneﬁdial.
Such a conclusion is procedure.
The National Student Congress
has various undemocratic aspects
io its procedures, 'but it does
provide a forum for student
opinion. If this opinion is not
truly representative, the place
for reform is on individual cold
legs computer. The lGrinncll
Student SEnate last fall voted
to have generates to the Nationzil Student Congress elected by
a campus-wide vote. Other
schools, too, are working for reform and the possibilities of
success are not dim for this
coming year.
More importantly, however, I
feel that the Grinnell campus
Can geneﬁt by our association
in this organization. in the eslub.
basement of an NSA committee,
our NSA coordinator, aware of
each organization’; projects, will
at all times know to whom to
give incoming information. Also,
these people will be free to request information from the NSA
headquarters.
I feel that through such coordination of interests, our membership in NlSA can be a true
geneﬁt to clips campus. After a
membership of one year, we
are in no position to make such
a conclusion decision concerning
NSA. as withdrawal would certainly be.
Perhaps NSA should ’be on
promotion, but so should we as
a member campus. If NSAhas
not worked this yrnr,pay~iofihe
fault items from our failure to
utilize more fully its potential.
1 would urge the students of
Grinnell and the representatives
to the Student Senate to support
Grinnelrs continued membership
in the National ’Student Association.

To the Editor:
Two years ago the ”share-areas” program was institutes at
Grinnell College. In an effort to
continue the program. tomorrow
evening we will be eating a
German mcai instead of the reg
ular speak dinner.
constitution one foreign meal
for the Saturday speak dinner
will save enough money to pay
for the board expenses of a foreign student for a full year at
Grinnell.
The philosophy underlying
this program is three-fold: i)
As students of Grinneli. we will
be indirectly sharing a small
part of our financial resources
with a foreign student; 2) we
will be sharing in his culture
and customs by eating his food;
and 3) we will be sharing our
educational facilities and culture
with him when he comes to
study here next year.
Faculty members and their
families are partially invited
to participate in this meal.
We sincerely hope that members of the Grinnell community
will participate enthusiastically
in this program, not as a great
physical sacrifice but as an expression of good will and inc
forest in purchasing a foreign
student's education and opportunity.

"The practice of "reviewing"

common with the art of crib
irish." William James.
Since I hope to criticism I will
get the review over by saying
that I thought the folk concert
was a very good event and hope
another will be held next year.
It has taken me three years
to decide alias Pete ’seeker’s not
having Caruso's voice dress’t
matter. seeker is doing shine.
thing else, something in which
a good voice would be extra
luggage, and perhaps carefully
extra. Last Saturday's folk code
sci-t reminder me, however, that
there is a Cut-off line.
I suppose the only real criterion for a folk singer is
how much the folks want to
hear him: Being a folk, then,
I would like to explain what
it is that Pete woman, Sam
Schuman, Maria portion and
Mary Edmondson have which
made them the high points of
the show.
After “Bob Hope“ finished,
woman came out in a shirt that
looked like my transmitted's
bedroom wallaper, gym shoes
without socks, and a pair of russell blue jeans: The audience
served immediately that this
was a folk singer, but the real
reason why became clear later
in the first half when Clark
Dlmond and Schuman song
“Doctor proud.“
Thcuiffcrencc was that Dir
mcncl, lightbox‘ne and Mark
Martin were performing while
Cohen and Schuman were sing.
ing: When they got on I felt like
singing along, but with Dimond
(who got better as the program
programmes) all I wanted to do
was run up on the stage and
stretch his Vocal cards for him
so hc could hit those low notes
without such :i terrible struggle,
stop trying so hard, relax, and
have a good time.
Besides this stage presence,
which is sort of creating the
solution that one is not performing, there were other differences
which separated the cast memo
sci-s. On one end there were some
voices so bad that no audience
should be suspected to them and
on the other end there were per,
pre like Miss Edmondson who
had voices far above the cut-off
line.
Another differentiating factor
was reliability, which is perhaps
only a careful choosing of the
material. Julie Newman, for example, although she sounds
much like Joan Baez, was very
good on n large or a slow bcl.
had, but as soon as she tried
anything loud or fast her voice.
got strategy and thin.
This channels was another difference, for there were some;
like Light‘box‘ne and Miss
Newman, who had small voices,‘
others like Martin who had
loud voices, and still others who
were able to be either strong or
soft, as the song detailed. And
this is important. '
The especially good people
seemed to be better able to tell
how the song asked to be song
while inc others, although this
does not” apply to Miss New
man, wanted the song to their
capabi ties.
A folk song is not a serious
art form. On one level the ,
only possible reply to that
statement is “so what?" but
on another level it makes an
important point _ a folk song
is to feel whereas n serious art .
form is to understand and feel.
Folk songs come off much
better when approaches with
promotion joy or brief than with
authentication or humanity. The»
better fingers last Saturday
knew this, and because they did
they reached llc audience either
in its belly or its laughing

and that such a constitution, if
consistent with the SGA con.

Today and tomorrow the Pioneers make their trading
signal journey to the brake delays in Des points. Therel
haven’t always been 2000 athletes competing at the brake ,‘
delays, as there will be this year 11 fact at the connections
of what is now a major sports affair 53 years ago only 85
athletes made their way through an Iowa blizzard to come
pete.
But during the 53 years that followed, the brake delays became a major sports affair, pulling in the greatest
athletes in the country. It was at the delays that Jesse
teens set the American record for the broad jump with
a jump of 26-1 3/4. It was there that teens ran :09?) in
the 100 to equal the existing world‘s record. l
Past competitors in the delays include charles Hoff,»
who at the delays in 1926 set the American record in the
pole vault; charles Paddock, a great springer in the 20’s;
HarrisoniDillard, springer and further; Bobby narrow, an
Olympic hero; yes wanted and Glenn birmingham, great
makers; and cal sheffield, a great quarter and half miles.
Two Glinllellians should be included in the list of
track stars of the past One is Chuck Hoyt, a failed
sprint champion before 1920; and the seller is Morgan
Taylor, a further in the 20’s, who still holds the Grinnell
handle records.
Perhaps the fact that only those two Grinnellians can
be mentioned as “all-time create” is because they were the
product of competition provided when Grinnell was a level
her of the Missouri Valley Conference.
In those days, the Pioneers faced such schools as
Oklahoma A&M, brake, arlington, Washington University
(St. Louis) and Butler,
recognition the effect staff competition had on Grinnell track then, Coach Dick Young has attempted to speed-i
use his current crop of concerned against such large schools
as Iowa State University (Ames) and State College of Iowa
(Cedar Falls).
Instead of remainingfwithin the relative security of
the league, where he could use Grinnell’s present strength
to produce an interested season, Young has scheduled the(
team “over its head" on several occasions to provide his'
men with the best possible tests of their skill.
All this he has done at the expense of a. perfect
season — often the public’s only measure of a coach’s
success.
