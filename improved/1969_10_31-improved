Controversy over College Role in FBI Probe
The college administration
tuesday decided to stop acting
as an intermediate between std7
cents and Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents who for
the past two weeks have been
Conducting an investigation of
Grinnell students involved in the
SDS concentrations in Chicago
earlier this month.
“If FBI agents come on campus, we will not serve in an the
commentary role," said Joseph F.
Wall. clean oi the college. Wall
told the 5&3 he had earlier off
level two FBI agents the use of
a college building to question
freshman Kay Sophar and‘ her
roommates because he wanted
to protect the students from the
entertainment of going to the
Grinnell police station. “I was
operating on what I thought
were generous instances,” Wall
explained.
President Glenn Leggctt said
that the college’s role in the
FBI probe had been “simply
that of relating information
from FBI agents to students"
and involving students that
they were not legally bound to
meet with the agents.
“The use of the word intermediate is opportunity." suggest said, ”because it gives the
impression we were cooperation
with the FBI in a way that we
women't." Both Wall and suggest said that they thought they
were prev1d‘ing a service for the
students involved by relating
the information, and were not
intentionally adding the FBI
agents.
Mrs. Alice 0. Low. dean of
students, used the words ”intermediate capacity” to describe
the college’s role in the matter
in a note sent to the students
involved.
Both chgett and Wall were
critical Thursday of a new story
about the FBI probe here that
appeared under a banner headline on the first page of Wednesday's (Oct. 29) DE; points
Register. mail was expected to
release early today a statement
“ marketing the facts" about his
involvement in the matter.
iowa Governor Robert D. Ray
customized the college administration’s role in the FBI probe
during a press conference Wednesday. "Schools should not be
in the FBI business," Ray said.
According to a memorandum
released by the President’s of»
{ice Tuesday, FBI agent Ells
worth Gustafson and a fellow
investigator called at the of—
like of Dean Wall Friday,
Oct. 17, and told him they
wishes to talk with Miss Sophar and her roommates.
Wall contacted Mrs. Alice 0.
Low, dean of Students, who in
turn contacted the girls involved, informed them of Gustafson’s message, and told
them their legal rights. The
girls met with the agents that
day in a college office.
On Tuesday, Oct. 21, another
FBI agent called on President
Glenn suggest. Dean Low also
attended the meeting. The
agent said he wishes to talk
with 11 students whom the
5823 had identified as having
been in Chicago during the

said suggest, “is that the FBI
already had the names. We
didn‘t give them to them.”
After consulting with the
college attorneys, suggest and
Low agreed to contact the students the FBI wishes to see.
In a note sent to the students
involved, Dean LOW said, “The
dean’s office is acting in an
intermediate capacity only
between the current investigation conducted by the FBI and

cross Debate publishing Senior homes
After several years of control
verse about the senior comprehensive examination, the faculty met Monday and related
whether to english comes as a
general graduation r e qu i r emerit.
Prof. Joseph F. Wall (History), dean of the college,
placed on the floor a motion
to english the comprehensive
examination as a graduation requirement “effective for the
class of 1970."
Wall told the faculty that
after relating the motion for
11/2 hours, the faculty’s Executive Council was divided events
on the question, with five members favorite the evolution of
comes and five others opposed.
“In some reflects that was
good," Wall said, "because
now there is no pressure from
the Executive Council (on how
the faculty should vote). We
must get a decision within the
next week or two."
Wall also told the faculty that
the three additional educational
policy committees had been
divided on the issue of comprehensive examinations. The
Humanities additional EPC res
commented that the comp requirement be maintained, while
the Social Studies and Science
Divisonal EPC’s recommended
that it be published.
Asst. Prof. John H. harley
(Philosophy), faculty secretary,
read a proposal which he will
offer as an amendment to the
present motion at next Monday's faculty meeting. The pros
local would allow individual des
documents to replace the
present comp requirement with
programs that “could consist of
a comprehensive examination,
a theSis or paper, a particular
course or seminar, a research
project, a public performance,
or any combination of these."
Such programs would be either
required or optional, but if
passing them is a graduation
requirement for motors, they
“must be accepted by the additional EFC, the Executive
Council, and appear in the college catalog.”
Wall said that the comp issue
was “fundamental to the basic
issue of college policy and the
reason for the existence of the
college itself.” He explained
that the Executive Council discussed the issue dn the level
of whether Grinnell’s purpose
is to provide only a broad and
diverse liberal education, or
whether it does, or should. also
provide high quality pie-pro
emotional training.
During debate on the motion
to english comes at Monday’s
meeting, the faculty appeared
to be divided on the issue for
various reasons.
P r o i . Morris Parslow
(French) deferred the couple-
website examination because it
“evaluated the student’s ability
to define and to operate in his
field and to see the relationship
of that field to the general liberal arts in a wide perspective."
"I'm against comprehensive
examinations as a general We
quiremenl." Prol. brain soldiers (Sociology) told the
faculty. “Leaving the require
ment to each department would
allow the departments to do
what's best for the student.”
soldiers said Grinnell should
“prepare our students for the
world into which they are
moving” by adding in "occur
national placement and selffulfillment." He said that

“Just by calling this meeting

“I think the college still has
an obligation to tell a student
that the FBI is looking for him

the college provides controlling on draft information. we

this way we can hopefully

them of their rights before

This week President Glenn suggest announced that the college
“would no longer act in an intermediate capacity" between the

commented.
Although we recognize the college's “concern concern" for the
welfare of students that promoted them to call students and relay

in those situations that are essentially matters between students
and legal authorities. Such involvement jeopardizes the college

If Grinnell is to truly develop “mature. thinking individuals,"

The new policy of the college in this area recognized the destinations between “in logo parental” and the legitimate counseling function of the institution. This distinction must be main-
gained.
