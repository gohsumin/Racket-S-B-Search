Registrar Reveals Grinnell numbers
From Limited ‘Withdrawal’ Symptoms
In the dead of winter wild
rumors often calculate the
campus about the number of
students Who withdrew or founded
out of Grinnell during the
Christmas access. Here are the
statistics according to the
records of the Registrar.
A total of twenty-nine students
withdrew permanently from
Grinnell College after the first
semester. There were selection
voluntary withdrawals ( some of
which may be transfers to other
colleges) and twelve academic
dismissals. In addition, 16
students went on either academic
or personal leaves and‘twentyasix
enrolled in off-campus ACM
programs. Five students completed their graduation
requirements admin-year, 0n the
other side of the balance sheet,
twenty-nine students returned
from leaves. The total size of the
student body at the beginning of
the second semester was 1107, of
which 593 were men and 509 were
women. In addition there were
a few special students and a few
unclassified students.
According to Dale Terry,
Registrar and Director oi ddr
missions, about one-third of the
students who leave Grinnell for
any reason before they have
completed their requirements for
graduation normally leave at
midryear. Seventyone students
left after the first semester. Last
year a total of 176 students left
for all reasons. The number of
academic dismissals is higher
than usual for midwest. Three
or four is more typical. Terry
expressed confidence that there
would be fewer such dismissals
than usual after second semester
as a result of this.
Ten years ago the yearly withdrawal rate was roughly fifteen
percent of the student body.
Between 1961 and 1966 withdrawals were fairly steady,

The following is the statement
of Judge Lincoln concerning the
trial of the state vs, add powers:
It is the conclusion of this Court
based on sword testimony that
a reasonable doubt exists as to
the alleged assault on the person
of Lawrence Frank at the Main

December 18, 1969 by the

Therefore the Court finds the
defendant add powers not guilty

around twelve per cent per year.
During the last two full academic
years the withdrawal rate has
again been about fifteen per cent.
At Grinnell one per cent oi the
student body is roughly eleven
students.
Mr. Terry stated some reasons
for the rise in withdrawals during
the last two or three years. First,
the number and capacity of ACM
programs has increased. Second,
the College has related its policy
on printing academic and personal leaves, He indicated that
there was an initially high with
drawal rate in 1967-68 (15.7 per
cent) for a number of reasons.
The high withdrawal rate was
partly a fluid and partly an
expression of uncertainty about
the future of the college. The
junior class, which entered in
that year, shows a decided img
balance in males and femalesglw
males, as females. The junior
class is smaller than the senior
class, which also reﬂacts the
withdrawals in 1967-63.
“The great majority of trans»
tags from Grinnell occurs in
freshman and sophomore
women," said Terry. Students
have many reasons for transferring. Some disease the social

Voted; Changes in
Credit-Fail Program
Last Monday, the faculty held
their second meeting of this
semester. President suggest
announced that the following four
men will be offered contrary
degrees at announcement this
spring: Horace Mann Bond, and
three Grinnell graduates:
Messrs. Stoessinger ’50, fathers

also noted that the current
average faculty-student ratio
was 1:10. In a conversation With
the 5&3, he talented the fact
that a college the size of Grinnell
cannon afford to maintain for; long
this desirable state of affairs.
The faculty decided to make
several changes in the credit»fail
option program. A student is now
allowed to take courses in his
secondary field with the creditfail option. Also, courses in the
ACM Urban Studies Program
and the Colorado College Summer institute may be taken on
the creditrfail basis and can be

atmosphere. Others wish to
obtain more vocational training.
Still others, “A" students in high
school, find the academic
competition more intense than
they want Others do not like
living in a small town.
Transferring students tend to
go to universities, which would
be less expensive and larger.
“But when students transfer to
small colleges,” {said
Terry,“they tend to go tu very
good small schools."
The college must get students
to replace those who have with—
drawn. Mr, Terry indicated that
it takes four applications to
replace one student. Since the
college does not get many
transfer students, it is difficult
to restore balance in the various
classes once it is lost, Mr. Terry
predicted that the college will
probably receive between 1350
and 1400 applications for admission this year. About four
hundred new students will be
admitted. Applications to
Grinnell have been increasing in
recent years, according to Terry,
even though at many schools the
number of applications seems to
be shopping somewhat. In- ad
action, the percentage of students
who accept admission to the
college once it is offered has given
considerable during the last five
years. in 1965 it was 42 per cent;
and this has increased by regular
pumps, to 60 per cent last year.

Last Friday, February 6th, a statemerttwas placed

As Mr. Wilhelm, Miss german, and their friends
carefully point out, the change in policy on the part
of the rest of the Pterodactyl staff
“air’t our
revolution.” We are glad to See the revolution at last
showing its true colors. It seems that there never really
is very much room in a revolution for idealists afte;
power becomes a question. Those who work in the
name of any legitimately functional freedom will be
created out by others with fewer scruples and more
ruthless methods.
Our editorial policy drivers basically from that of
current and past Staff members of Pterodactyl; yet
we are disappointed by this turn of events. At least
Mr. Wilhelm, Miss german, and their friends were
working for a principle or set of principles, however
different from our own, Bruce listen has said that
he and his friends are “working for a society that’s
above freedom of speech.” Presumably after Mr.
listen’s revolution has gone beyond his newspaper
into society at large, the ‘
‘culture and politics of the
majority” will be used to determine what other changes
must be made in the Bill of Rights, Perhaps his society
will be above other freedoms.
It is not too surprising, then, that Mr. Wilhelm refers
to Grinnell’s “searching-socialists" as “florists,” and
we are caused to note one more instance in which
the politiciansof the far left have gone so far that they
are beautifully indistinguishable from their brothers
on the extreme right.
Students Try Experiment in New
Freshman Humanities Program
By betty ericsson
Grinnell's traditional freshman
humanities program is being
challenged by a new non-credit
experimental seminar led by pic
MacDowell. The reading list
includes games‘ The Stranger,
tickets’s Waiting for robot.
person's Silent Spring, and
Jacobs’ Death and Life of Great
American Cities. ,
At the first course meeting,
held February 4th in the South
Lounge, MacDowell and approximately twenty participants
discussed their expectations for
the course. MacDowell feels that
many freshman come to Grinnell
excited about learning, and that
they quickly lose interest when
they don't feel challenged by
“classics" wllich they consider
irrelevant to their lives. Some of
(his enthusiasm could be retained
if they, in organized groups,
could read and discuss Works
related to today's social
problems.
Many students agreed with
MacDowell. One said she felt a
gap in her learning, and that she
did not know how to fill it, Others
stated that classes are img
personal, and some instructors
do not appear to be interested
in their subjects. In general, they
thought they would get more
from group discussions of the
topics than from their own
readings.
MacDowell originally became
interested in the project While
doing research on freshman. He
thought that perhaps the second
semester humanities program
could be changed to include more
Works relevant to student's
lives. He first discussed this with
Dean Wall, then brought it before
the humanities committee. They
rejected his suggestions, so
MacDoWell decided to test his
ideas in an experimental
seminar.
The change in approach to
learning is as important here as
the change in material offered.
Many humanities sections consist
mainly of lectures with little
student participation, whereas
MacDowell’s approach allows
much more freedom of
discussion. It is hoped that this
approach will be incorporated
into the regular humanities
program so that the
disillusionment many freshmen
find will not carry on to their
remaining college years.

Letters to the Editor . . .
OpenLetter:
After this semester’s first soil;
editorial 7 an editorial illdisposed toward effective student
participation in the school’s
decisionrmaklng process 7 I
have made every effort to get
the Steering Committee (Phil
years, Bruce listen, pick
Schalmann, and myself) to
respond to this editorial, since it
directly affects the work of our
committee, My proposal was to
call for a teach-m (which as I
believe would have been an
appropriate form of mass
communication). The following
were my reasons:
First, our committee, which is
supposed to work for “new
structures” that allow for more
effective student participation on
nearly all levels of decisions
making, cannon obtain its
legitimate by its sheer existence
through election. Rather, we can
only obtain legitimate from
continuous interaction and
mutual communication between
the student body and our committee. We must not be a
separation edition group.
Therefore, since the mentioned
editorial affected our work, we
should have taken the Opportunity of a teach-in during
wllich we could have talked about
the implications of the editorial
on our work, Since the editors'
and our views are contrary, I
regarded it as essential for our
future work to field out the
response of other students.
Second, and perhaps more
important, a teach-m would
contribute to the political
education of students. Many
students at the moment are
politicians synthetic, There are
not many people that are concerned about the political and
social implications of this
educational system. However, if
we do not realize these political
and social implications, We
cannon execute effective student
participation. A structure superimposed on synthetic students
would be innocent. This strip7
sure could never serve its sends
unless students realize its
political significance. Political
awareness is the prerequisite for
effective student participation.
The bourgeois. the politicians
synthetic, has to be transferred
into the Ciloycll. the politicians
aware. And in teach-ins, where
we can communicate with the
whole student body rather than
with some few committee
members, we could have talked
about the political relevance of
our education. It could have been
astart.
Since the other members of the
Steering Committee had contrary
views on this issue, however, and
since I regard this political
concern as the conditio site que
non for “portable new structures," i am forced to design,

Your third editorial 7 and here
again we have never noticed your
faces at a Senate meeting — is
also a credit to your irresponsible
journalism, To put it country, you

about, You stated in your
editorial “that there are no apparent laws which template
Senate expenditures.” However,
every allocation oi the Senate,
as with any Senate action, is
subject to veto by a student

that “the Senate can do as it
pleased with our money," Need
we remind you that all Senators
are elected at large by the
student body. The editors of the
sea, which this year received a
larger Senate allocation than
ever before ($5,500.00), are
chosen (often for political
reasons) by a committee with
only direct student members.
Let us proceed to examine
some or your specific charges.
To begin with, the Pterudactyl
never received a penny from the

your editorial that the Senate
might “considerable reduce”
Social funds in order to subscribe
Pterodactyl. Should the
Senate decide to subscribe
any other newspaper, money
would be taken from general
budget and reserve and not the
social coordination fund, which
this year also has a greater
allocation than ever before. The
Senate never allocated money for
a dog house, and the “few year
pre" who went to the Washington
Moratorium were 80 strong.
Other “contacting” activities
of the Senate include considering
it highly successful and beneficial
Drug Symposium to which the
Senate gave $650, Supporting the
Grinnell area Moratorium activities, and planning another

It is Characteristic of columnists and compensation to spend
much of their time exploration
the answers to airline questions
of their own defining. This
university is especially prominent at Grinnell, since most
pressing questions seem to generate bizarre pentacostal arrivals of the configuration or cons
emotional sort on the one hand,
or a particularly exactly form of
death by attention known as the
ad how committee on the other.
The outcome of this, quite
apart from a platform of disenr
questioned answers, is the understandable resistance of anyone
to export himself to this regularly, much less weekly. Do any
of you have any idea of what it’s
like to ask a question here'! I
sent out a questionnaire last
week: “What is the value of
sports?" In response to this I
received 17 signed connections of
application, 2 angry rentals, a
complimentary subscription to
Christian Economics, advice to
consult the Shorter oxford
Greek-English mexican
(provided, of course, that I am
willing to accomodate myself to
the 'n‘utc) and 8 pounds 5V2
ounces of plymouth College
press releases.
I also received a form letter
from the University of Iowa's
Athletic Director involving me
that it intended upon ability and
so forth, but that sports could be
worth up to $1,900 a year laundry
money, plus board, bed, and tuition. This, of course, does not
include whatever environments,
Bar Mitzvah‘s, and such like
could be picked up on the side.
Nor did he fail to mention the
possibility of a small Cut of a

These of course, are the imponderables of chance that a

All of Which does originally
conspire to bring me to within

all this. For it is my,pride (and
I say this unashamed) that a

American way to play to win, so,
failing this, it is the American
Way to field a team, play for a
calculated length of time on the
proper sort of field, and follow
all sorts of appendix provisions
which, along with those of vice
tony, are laid away in the Rule
Books.
Cause and Effect in the newspaper game begins on Sunday
night, Each Sunday night there
is a staff meeting, in which the
staff meets in the 8&3 room to
sit on the typewriters and watch
Lloyd and Harry light their pipes.
I frequently cannon go to this
meeting due to unavailable
circumstances such as my formatting it.
Then on Monday morning,
Lloyd speaks up on me in the
Forum while I am wondering
why l ever gathered to get up.
He lights his pipe and asks how
the ol’ Sportspage looks this
week. Ilie to him cheerfully and
he goes off happy.
There are only two fundamental axioms necessary to this
craft:
Axiom One: Sports happens
on Friday and Saturday
Axiom Two: The college
information office has the
scores and a small stockholm of
carbon on Tuesday afterwards
for immediaterelease
AX. 2, Schol. 1: It might well
believe the editor to be there
on Tuesday afternoon.
Thus I am breed to spend
Monday and Tuesday in wholesale pursuant such as dancing
the Egyptian folks and shooting
Polar Bears.
Until Wednesday, that is. On
Wednesday, Harry speaks up to
tell me that he's got a photograph
of a basketball or something. He
wants to know if I have a story
for it.
So it’s Wednesday, and I need
a writer. A good way of getting
a writer is by means of what we
in the trade call Cajolery. Cajolery is when you write an anonymous letter, threatening to place
a bomb in the gas tank of his
diseases 1959 quick unless the
writer delivers a Sepage article
to the 8&3 office in a plain brown
wrapped by Thursday noon.
Thursday is layout day, when
it is incorrect upon everyone to
read the letters to the Editors
and walk around bowling “I Want
photos," “I want headlines.” and
“I want a special breast troops
reading pencil with no trademarks on it,” and so forth. This
yields a layout, three nervous
breakdowns, and a warm feeling
of professional pride.
Then we put Lloyd and Harry
in the car, tell them that they
can‘t have their pipes back until
the papers are in the mailboxes,
and take a well~reserved rest.
