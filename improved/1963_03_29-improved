Student trends
91 Hours Working and Sleeping
How does the Grinnell student
spend his time?
The average student, according to a report issued last Fr
day by Grinnell President Howard R. women, speeds 39 hours
a week studying and concerning
with processors. He speeds an
average of 5 hours a week in
class and 52 hours a week sleeping.
Meals and personal care take
21 hours a week, while free time
takes a 41 hour chuck out of
the student’s week.
Dr, women’s report was based
on a survey taken of a test
group of 64 students, on a sur—
key to see where all students
were during the week, and by
his conversations with scores of
students.
"The great majority of std—
cents study from 5 to 8 hours
a day," reported Dr. women.
“And the average work week
about 54 hours,”
 
noted, is “considerable longer
than the ‘forty-hour \week’ common in business. However, Grin.
well students do not spend time
in computing have relatively
few household responsibilities."
From the 41 hours a week
which were found to be “free
time” comes time for “employment, relaxation, recreation,
public events, and extracurricu—
car activities."
In the week that Dr. women
took his survey the average
student spent 42 hours in the
union, 2.5 attending public
events, and 2.2 participating in
sports.
“The work load of Grinnell
students appears to be heavy,
but is generally accepted." Dr.
women concluded. “However,

A Loud Silence -- KG
A "wired-wireless” radio operation at Grinnell College gained the approval of the college hierarchy in May of
1948. Late the following fall the ﬂoffering voice of KGRW
traveller through the heating winners and into campus radios. The station was small in budget and operation, broadcasting for an hour and a half five earnings a week.
KGRW grew steadily for a few years, and then its
voice slowly faced into its present silence. A driving force
behind KG’s exception was a student named Peter jacket,
now an NBC news coordinator, who found his biggest
job was to sell the possibility of a campus radio to students, faculty, and “most of all the administration."
KGRW started off on a small scale, but by 1951 a
staff of 130 participated in the operation of the station. A
confident station manager, Bill Calm, said in 1951, “If we
keep growing at this rate, in five years KGRW will be
Grinnell College, with every student a member." He added,‘
“The future looks high indeed for this adolescent organganism."
Calm was wrong. KGRW never really made it at Grinnell. Generally, the interest in a college radio remained
high. But the equipment and technical quality of the
closed-circuit broadcasting hurt the station. Also under the
“wired-Wireless" the morris calls coupon‘t be reached.
Last year the station manager of the now offline-air
KGRW proposed that the college turn to a FM set-up,
broadcasting over the air. A Board of Publications committee prepared a report rﬂscoring a FM set-up, the report
being sent to Grinnell President Howard B. women.
In the absence of President women, James H. Stauss,
dean of the college, presented the proposal to the faculty
which reportedly approved the program in principle. At
the time President women cited the need for further study
on the program.
The Glinnell College student senate passed a resolution
in the spring of 1962 unanimously in favor of an FM sea<
tion Between 800 and 900 students last spring signed a
pet ion calling for an FM station, yet the future of an FM
college radio is not bright.
Monday President women said that even should an FM
proposal be approved by a faculty committee (which he is
in the process of selecting for the purpose of studying the
FM proposal), he mounted if an FM station could be worked
into next year’s college budget. A station would necessarily
an initial outlet of between $5000 and $7000, according to
the station manager of the defence KGRW.
President Bowennoted that if the FM proposal receives
the support of a faculty committee, he would “give it
serious consideration."
“I feel that the radio station from a public relations
stand point has little to offer us,” President women added.
He noted that the station‘s value would be for educational
purposes only.
Stephen E. Wood, dean of men, in reference to a ra«
did station said, “I don’t believe a student can accept the
responses ty of managing and programming." His reason
for this feeling was the amount of time involved in such
work.
KGRW-FM would be a grill, another extracurricular addition to Grinnell. According to Wood, the question books
down to “priorities," or to which extras in Grinnell is going to incorporate into its program.
We think that an FM station at Grinnell should have
priority over other skills sun'h as two or three highly expensive concerts a year or a ski slope constructed for the
Snow Carnival. An FM Station could ’be successful. It has
educational value and could also provide a welcome change
lfrom the commercial programming of most Iowa stations.
KGRW-FM is needed.

To the Editor;
In a report of a coffee hour
in the 5&8 of Friday, March is,
the question was raised whether
the 5&3 exists primarily as a
providing college newspaper or
as merely a publicity arm of the
college. You have stated that
the 8&3 should courage. As the
article puts it: .. . . l the Sam.
should be the manipulator of.
college opinion.” I would submit
to you that the ‘SSzB should be
far more than an issue—makes
what it is now, Our college
newspaper she be a source of
automatic criticism, the real
analyst of the campus issues.
Up to now, the 5&3 has taken
stands that are more emphasis
and dramatic than automatic.
Therefore, the editors should
produce a better thought out
editorial policy, or, as the col-
should stop its irresponsible courage. I would suggest a positive
constitution for the educational
unthoughts we have been getting; namely, conﬁne editorial
output to the thoughtful opinions of non-staff members.
There is a distinction between
thoughtful newspaper trustees
and irresponsible journalism,one
which is a pseudo-idealism of
sorts. This distinction was listed
at in the ﬁrss paragraphs of the
letter. An example of a thoughtIn! courage in American journalism is the export by the which<
go Daily News of the incorrect
conditions in Illinois mental hospitals. In their thoughtful attack,
magnetic
the editors of the Daily News
developed a powerful set of
counter-arguments to all the standard positions; they were never
open to an attack by intelligent
public opinion. If you would argue that indeed the Daily News
used sensationalism, 1 would report by saying that every since
of their passionate attack was
backed up by a well taken, logical position.
1 would argue that the charles
and Black editorials have been
packing in such a logical backing. it seems to many of us that
the editorials have rather seemed take any old kind of a liberal
stand, which has. time after
time, been deemed ridiculous by
the bulk of readers. I cite the
omnipresent promoting on cam-
put—directed towards the 5&3.’
The editorials have not been
careful appeals to reason, as
long as sessions could be about»
ed. These actions constitute irresponsible journalism. For example, great student feeling was
started up over the drinking
rule question, Plenty of printer’s
ink. miles of banner headlines,
and almost no real discussion of
the issues.
in reality, the drinking rule
position, if properly publicized!
could be very favorites to the
college trustees. It will, in fact.
make drinking on campus much
more highway informed. That is
c .t. .
provided a much different action. When Dr. women replied
to the wave of criteria that
was participated by the yellow
journalism campaign. the receiving practice of the college res
setting from “widespread sensationalism” was one of his major
arguments. Remember that careful night in the Student Senate?
The student body would give
the 5&3 a ﬁrm round of aP‘
clause for some intelligent editorial positions. 1 gateway, after
the gets of the past three editorial pages (on elections), the
paper would get a standing station. Not that the picture is all
bad. Articles by Dan Friedlander
and Ron Goodenow stood out
as excellent work. They stood
out because they were thought
out. But as long as the 58:3
continues to use floppy weddings. their position will be hopelessly blessed. For example. one
only has to look at the ﬁrss line
of the article that this letter
comments on (March 15, p. 5):
“The question of Whether the
5&3 has the right to be the
‘manipulator of campus opinion."
“Manipulator” is a poor choice
Iof Words. It easily implies demugoguery, systematized propagandizing efforts, and emotional
ihyper-appeals. Indeed, that illchosen word implies many things
that the 581B editorials have
been. Would it be such a diﬁi-

Blast Against Court countries
To the Editor:
The Grimell College High
Court has been charged with
interference, emergency. and
acts of abstracts in a letter to
the editor in the Scarlct&Black.
These charges have come not
from outside the Court, but
from one of its own member5#
or better, emmembors. (See the
5&3 March 22).
For the record let me state
that the final decision of the
Court was 2.2, not 2.1 as Nancy Lee Norton stated in her letter. The decision of the Court
had been recorded in the Sec—
rotary's minutes and had been
made public prior to Miss Norton’s “absorption." Furthermore.
the decision to withdraw her
vote was made after the High
Court had distances from its
consideration of the case.
1 am surely aware of the
nature of the community in
 
 
which we all live, as do the
other members of the Court.
And indeed, “all that can he
expected of any court menu
her is that he forestry try to
hear both sides of the case."
This is exactly what the High
Court was asked to do in defining' the case of Martin vs.
awsn. And I believe it was
done.
I feel that it is the response<
bility of each member of the-
Court, and this includes the
Men's and Women’s Primary
Courts. to listen to and decide
a case as his or her conference
pictures; a decision not based
on bestiality to one side or they

Sena’re Busy With Red Tape:
LiHIe Meaningful Discussion
To the Editor:
As a Senator I am continually
approved at the lack of meaningful discussion on matters before
the Senate. The issue which
participated my present discuss
was list night’s consideration of
the McCarral-l Act Resolution.
During the debate the Senate
saw an attempt to table the
resolution because the students
had not educated themselves.
which was detected. Then an
amendment was proposed to
change the resolution from indicating ”repeat" of the Act to
a “reconsideration” of this Act.
The chair was overruled during
the debate on this motion to
keep the Senators relating the
issue of repeat versus reconsiderotion. After all this, the
amendment was withdrawn!
A mandate was then proposed
for amendment but it, too, was
withdrawn when it was pointed
out that the mandate would
cost $50 if passed. A more models mandate was proposed after
a suggestion by advisor Paul
Smith, and then an amendment
 
 
to the mandate was proposed.
This amendment to the amendments was detected; the mandate was then passed and added
to the resolution. The repeat, reconsideration was again moved
and finally detected. Then the
full resolution came up for debate and not one single Sen—
atom, including myself, brought
up a single point which touched on the essence of the reset
action, i.e. is the McCarran Act
a danger to American freedom.
This resolution was calculated
in the hopes that ii. would slim»
plate discussion on the Act.
Coffee hours were held, strap
votes were taken, and the combination should have come in
Senate when a rational dishes—
sign of the pros and cons of the
bill should have taken place,
Instead the discussion took the
form of legalistic consumers and

Amendments were carelessly

Individual Evaluation Might Lead
to ultra curriculum Participation
To the Editor.
This is a time of evaluation
on campus, All of the various
organizations are involved in an
evaluation and a combination of
the year’s activities before the
transition at spring vacation.
This evaluation process is
good. Organizations will proﬁt
from it. But it must be actor—
wanted by a similar process on
the part of the individual stud
sent. This is the time of year
when he must do some evaluat—
ing of his "Grinnell experience."
Four years at a small liberal
arts college in the middle of
Iowa will make a big different
in his life. The person he has
become when he receives that
covered B.A. is partly peterson—
ed by what he has done during
the four preceding years. Actvi—
ties both in and out of the class—
room are important.
SOME or THE latest abilities of an entering student are
developed at Crinnell. The im-,
contact thing to realize, though,
is that the choice as to whether
his latest abilities are developed,
tests with each individual student. His choice of activities, or
his choice of no activities, is his
own. However, when he says.
“I’ll wait and see how much
time I have.” and then, rather
unconsciously, never gets involv—
ed, he’s putting off a decision.
By defining not to decide. he
usually makes a decision not to
participate.
Our college community has a
wealth of ﬁne extra—curriculum
activities. Each offers many op—
communities for service and lead—
ership. Now each organization
is concerned with the problem
of student apache. It‘s a arabic
situation, but the tragedy is on,
the individual level. ln the long
run, not the organization, but
the individual student, sellers.
Four years at Grinnell cost
exactly the same in time and
dollars no matter what one does
while he’s here. It’s easy to
pass up opportunities, or to put
off the decision. The hard thing
to do, it seems, is to make that
active decision to participate;
this is the time of year to make
,it . .
This is not a plea for a com—
munich of corners. Nor is it an
anti- nursing creative. But it is
inspired by a real concern that
Imany students are passing up
once in a- lifetime opportun' its
by just never making a positive
decision to get into extracurricular activities.
The way to get to know per—
pre and the way to develop la—
tent personal qualities is to
jump in with both feet, to do
some work, and to make a real
contribution to the community.
Active participation in selected
extracurricular activities will innﬁlikely enrich our Grinnell experience. It's a necessary supplement to academic activities.
Let’s bring the beforesspring-vacation evaluation down to an
individual level and then personally and actively launch the
various programs for next year.

Last Saturday in s. nine team

This is not exactly indicating of
the respective team strengths,
however, since the team balance
of the Pioneers is a greater factor in a dual meet.
At SCI, the Pioneers were

' a four-article sequence on the status at
the Silent KGRW.
Until last spring Grinnell had a campus radio
station. As one closely connected with the old
1(th 1 think 1 am quiltﬁed to say it stand.
In the beginning when the station was closely violation Federal Communications Commission
regulations — and hence could actually be heard
— it was a liable institution. And last year a
successful attempt was made to again produce
quality programming. However, it was too_ late.
With no legal cure possible for the transmission
system’s influence (as Well as being burdened
with a recent history of mediocrity) the' wiredwireless operation was judges homeless. It was
buried.
Before the station was put to rest, however.
the Committee on Student Publications unani—
mostly approved and forbidden to President
women two reports representing a complete
reconstruction of KGRW and chancellor to FM
operation.- The first report was aimed at. obtaining
the potentialities of FM radio at Grinnellr The
second dealt with equipment requirements, pros
training, staff organization and administration.
Shortly alter this second report was subject—
ed to President women. the student Senate unanimously passed a resolution trying the college
administration to “accept the proposals contained
in the FM report." In addition over eight hundred
signatures on positions favorite FM were pre—
center at the spring meeting of the Board of
’l‘russell.
What then is the present status of the FM
proposal? It is to be studied by a faculty committee now in the process of being formed by
President hotel-l. This committee is to study the
“costs, controls, content and responsibilities involved” if an FM station is created.
The\fact1ty has decided to recommend this
committee's formation, containing its decision on
FM until the committee reports. This is a monitor
station of its stand last spring according the Publication Committee's report favorite FM. To understand the faculty’s present residence on FM
and the computing resistance of the administration, the key objectives to the proposal should be
examined. The remainder of this week’s article
will develop the framework for an assessment
of the value of FM radio to Grinnell. followed in
future weeks by a detailed analysis of various
aspects.
First must come a certification of the five to
seven thousand dollar initial expenditure and
the approximately two thousand dollar ‘annual
expense. This must be based on an assessment of
the relative efficacy of a radio operation in terms
fo Grinnell’s goals H stated and explicit. Such
an assessment could best be made in terms of
educational value furnished, although a case
could be partially based on the entertainment
function.
it is certainly true that the college speeds a
significant amount on projects and functions of
a surely entertainment orientation. The other
criticism of the proposed FM station is that it not
educational, collecting the obvious fact that not
everything in the college budget is educational
one workers what is not educational about good
music; recorded lectures and discussions. turkish»
cd for example by the Center for the study of
Democratic Institutions: The British Broadcasting Corporation’s recordings of the Shakespeare
festivals; and much more. A more detailed study
of the depth and scope of program sources will
come next week.
recently, even if it is admitted that FM would.
through good programming, serve to help enrich
the cultural and intellectual environment, one
serious criticism remains: are Grinnell students
capable of operating a station which can be heard
outside the combines of the Campus? This is a
harder objective to deal with, Perhaps the best
way is to cite the experience of other schools
similar to Grinnell. as well as the on-the-air re—
sponsibility of the KGRW staff last year. Again
this is a matter to be discussed more fully in
the next weeks.
FM has proved its values at such schools as
Carleton, Amherst. Williams and —~. excuse me e
Harvard. That it can be just as valuable at
Grinnell is the proposition 1 shall try to prove
in the next three articles on FM radio.
