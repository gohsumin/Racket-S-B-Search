Two women students have recently been involved in disciplinary actions by the college.
One woman was suspended for
three weeks in connection with the
illegal limitation of a controllers

members saw what appeared to be
a problem leaving the window of a

The suspension was handled by
the Faculty Committee on Student

to the Dean of Women.
In another case, a woman was
reported for attempted illegal entry into the quadrangle alter
hours. The case which was initially
presented to the FCSA was com<
animated by two previous businesses
and incorrect representation of the
facts. This case, however, has now
been turned over to the Women's
Primary Court. The student court
heard the case last night, and the
decision is pending.

Women's Weekend
B rings. Concerts, Film
By Krys Neumun
Women's Weekend, time of rock<
using for all Grinnell men, starts
today. It features two concerts, a
persian ﬁlm, and a guest chapel
speaker.
Jazz singer Nina Simone performs Saturday night and the college orchestra plans a special concert on Sunday. The movie “Virgin
Spring” can be seen Friday and
Sunday. The Reverend George
guide ol Oakland, California, will
speak on Sunday at 11 em. in service Chapel.
This will be the weekend for all
Grinnell girls finally to chose the
man oi their dreams (or at least
one who happens to be sitting next
to them in physics class). Some
even look upon the whole procedure as a truly educational experienced; that is, learning the real
courage that is tested on north
campus every weekend of the year.
The idea of Women's Weekend
is manually to ask him to take a
walk, go swimming, come to open
house or a lounge party or to
study. Looking at pictures together
in the fine arts building or in the
Forum is recommended, as is dinner and stack dates (Cafe del Foro
would love the business).
The Forum offers unlimited 1105'
facilities for originalrtype dates
that were not available last year.
It’s the Grinnell girl's opportunity
to inside the pool room or TV
room, with escort, of course. It’s
her chance to prove her domestic
ventures in the new private kitchenettes and dining rooms. And it
she lists through a celtic Friday
and Saturday (some girls have
been known to brave ten dates in
the Weekend — with ten different
escorts), she can spend a quiet
 
Sunday listening to folk and jazz
music in the listening room and
take advantage of the special tree
juko box music and special grill
prices Sunday night.

Issues Still value
By Arthur Yellln
"There are probably a few issues there," was the opinion of
Dean James H. Stauss, Acting
President of the College, on the
dispute over court jurisdiction
in cases 0! student violations.
Stauss spoke in a “question and
answer" period at Wednesday
night’s Senate meeting.
In Stauss’s viewpoint, due process does exist at Grinnell, but
governmental processes need improved definition and communication, applying to a student’s question, he said that he did not think
due process can have the same
form in all areas of the college.
Stauss's remarks remained value:
he did not think jurisdiction could
be defined in a formula-like make
new in terms of types of sciences.
Stauss said that student court
handling of some conduct cases
represented by the administration is appropriate. In other cases
student court handling is not appropriate. he had no objectives,
however, to the student agreement recommendations related to
due process, except for the right
of the accused person to know the

Shortened Interim
Possible Next Year
The 1965-66 college calendar
may include an “appreciated
interim" prior to the start of
the second semester, acting
President James H. Stauss said
this week.
Under the sensitive plan, students would be able to return
to school after Christmas Vacation on January 12. The first
two or three days would be
devoted to such concerns as the
Rosenfield Lectures.
Senior comprehensive exams
and the Junior Liberal Arts
Exam would be given January
14 and 15. Classes would begin
January 11.
Stauss said that this plan
would enable seniors and same
iors to get re-oriented before
taking their Comprehensive

Stauss also noted that one
consideration in shopping the

too potentially burdensome.

By Carl Otls Gray
In the past two weeks I have constantly been
caused by the responses to my last article. it
seems that by_attack-king America’s sacred rows
1 provided an overwhelming majority or my readers. Paul roberts' column last week took particular care to note the “depth of my sacred” applying that l was “various, careful, limited, narrowminded and arrogant." it seems that. Mr. Roberts
and Company need some setting straight. l intend
to live up to my reputation -— so Mr. Roberts, I’ll
be arrogant enough to deny anyone who tells me
I have no right to do so.
it there are any other self established experts
on the metro mind in the audience l would urge
them in forever hold their peace, because they
cannon and never will begin to scratch the surface
of a problem with which they have never come face
to race. 1 have a right to be presumptious enough
to say that no one. save another metro. can tell
me anything about civil rights. While liberal or
not, I knew more about American democracy, or
whatever it should be called, at the age of ten than
you will even be able to know. As the hypocrisy that
calls itself acceptance winds its way into our lives,
new hypocrlsies will slowly be recovered and ran
sealed. Don’t tell me how I Should [tel about being
given the privilege ut living in this wonderful "layer
llc" community because i could not be less interest.
ed. Realize this, you're doing me no favors.
it you forestry want to drive into that thing
that you all know so well, “the metro mind,” ask
Eddie Atkins’ four year old sister who was better
up by her yellow kindergarten students because she
was a metro. Ask the children who were headed
through the streets of delta what it means to
be an American. Then and only then can we begin
to commerce on a level with me as the teacher and
you as the student.
Until I was so pubmed by yellow Grinnell students as an registered young man, l had never
considered myself as such. But if that is the case,
well then, “you air’t seen within' yet." I would
suggest that it any of you are interested in pursuant
the development of wilderness in the American metro you should read (he works or w. E. DuBois to
begin with and then as you graduate to the rely:
timely techno voice or James Baldwin you hold
your stomach and read LeRoi Jones' personal
statement in Kulchul‘ 9, the one that ends with his
final word to degrees — CUT THEIR THROATS!
All that: men are distinctly out of the realm of
hlaclr Nationalist, Black Supremist movements, so
that charges oi ianatictsm are totally invalid. Alas,
even James Baldwin, In a debate with William F.

views by stating “The American Dream is held at

And furthermore — get the hell off my back,

Roberts Rules Of Disorder
As spring approaches — slowly - a young man's
fancy turns lighter to thoughts of love and baseball and tennis and like that.
Not so at Grinnell, Men of normally sound
sense turn rather heavily to nights or nancy or, to
be more explicit, to thoughts of SGA elections.
This year — even before the sap has started to
run - some ol the “edge" has been taken off the
election. SGA has been simpleﬁed. Alas, no more
complex procedure, no more “cumbersome checks
and balanced," no more unwieldly Senate sessions.
In short, no more charm.
best tiger: be any confusion, SGA was and remains a game to he played by campus political,
devoid oi any significance or importance. lt accomplished little before. It will accomplish little in
the future. It cannon possibly do more than set betty
penalties {or betty licenses, argue betty points in
a betty manner, and create sell~isolated images of
importance for its ofﬁcars.
By identifying the game. by reducing the number of players, by making the rules easy to understand. the game has lost any challenge. Embroilmerit and experience in practical political procedure was the only accomplishment of SGA. Now
we‘ve removed that.
The advance or spring at Grinnell usually brings
thoughts or the call Course by night, water lights
and — the greatest circus at all — the sen convention. Almost as a corollary to SGA’s loss o!
charm, it looks at ii there might not be I convention.
In order to have a convention, there must in

Wants Balanced.
To The editor:
Regardless or the proprietary involved, i feel forced to take issue
with Mr. forward's recent article
on diet Nam. It contains that combination of reality, idealism, virtual misstatement, false logic
and an occasional perception insight which ls typical of most current analysis of the war in diet
Nam and which proceeds in only
hopelessly confusion our thinking.
He states that one reason diet
Nam is a poor place to make a
stand is the combination of integer
enable singles and profile governments. He argued that it is english to take stands in areas where
topigraphical and strategic conventions are unavailable. First of all,
diet Nam is by no means all
jungle — the real area of conflict
is the rich rice producing delta of
the belong River — and besides
singles are not really impenetrable today, especially in South
diet Nam.
Furthermore, were governments
not profile, conversion and civil
wars would be unlikely differences. investing on taking stands
only where the governments are
“non-profile" would eliminate the
West from attempting to influence
the situation in much of today's
world. Any government in the un<
derdeveloped world — and India
is a good example — is likely to
become more, rather than less,
profile if it has to cope with the
problems of rapid communication
plus conversion partially organized
and supported from the outside.
It is again wishing thinking to
believe that our enemies or opponnents (leaving mem universities
for now) Will choose to challenge
us in areas where the strategic
and topographical conditions favor us. The point about guerrilla
nl' revolutionary welfare is that
it is a weapon that does not re
virtual Analysis
say, then, what he proposed, but
one can only assume he is suggesting withdrawal, Does this have a
“foundation in political reality,"
however? Or do we then make it
clear to friends and does alike that
the real lesson from diet Nam is
that is partially successful guerrlla welfare operation over difficult terrain in portable societies
will mean an American (and
therefore probably Western) Withdrawal? Might it not be better to
hang on for as long as possible,
make it as difficult for the enemy
as possible and hopefully learn
some Valuable lessons for the
next encounter — which will sure
ly come? (See the recent report in
the N.Y. Times on the beginnings
in Thailand, February ll, 1965.)
i am not arising for this policy
or against it; I am arising for a
more balanced and virtual assessment of the diet Nam situation
which as Mr. forward recognized
only a completed Will have simple
answers for.
By way of conclusion, although
many matters remain that should
be discussed (such as the effectiveness of corruption and author«
itarianism of one branch or another in most governments of the
underdeveloped world), Mr. forward has one corporation. If his
analysis proven to be correct, he
obviously wins. But if i have
shown it to be somewhat detective, he is still focused since he
learned his political science in my
class.

‘Shades of Gray'
Too planned Says
Anonymous Reader
To The Editor:
I happened to pick up your
paper while visiting a friend’s
home and read the article
“What the New World path
brought" by Carl Otis Gray,
which I think is copyright
nasty or should I say "sick,
sick, sick.”
Mr, Gray should realize that
“time matches on” not only
in beauty aids, but also science.
medicine, foods, etc, But he
should not limit these artificial
beauty aids to the white female
only as you can see these some
products being used by all
races and all to the good. I
might add On television and ,
on the streets you can notice
how the appearance of all
women has improved and has
also added in security employment. So let the’ “non-White
male" take a good look at the
female of his race and he will
find himself “listing" after
her.
As for as interracial love is
concerned, that too has been
changing toward the better, but
since conditions like this were
existing since days of the cave
man on, there probably will
always exist in all countries
so much of this. Mr. Gray currently is referring to the Civil
War era and before, but today, in modern times, it is
not a ”cash and carry relationship” combined only to the
colored races and the white,
but more a matter of choice of
the individual Concerned.

Girls Wonder About Women’s Weekend,
Challenge Appropriateness of Tradition
To The editors
After receiving [W0 Women’s
Weekends, we have come to
question the appropriateness of
continuing the tradition of
Women’s Weekend from the
standpoint of the attitudes expressed by both men and Women.
is it appropriate or worth
while to continue a social function such as Women‘s Weekend
in which dating forms are completely reserved and both men
and woman are placed in out-
times forward and embarrasur
ing situations? We cite the for»
losing examples: (a) Making
the date — the embarrassing
complications of neither person
knowing the other; (b) Breaking the data — no elimination
necessary.
lodging from opinions expressed by both men and women there are those who are at
best disappointed and at worst
enjoyed by the custom of corners's Weekend.

SCARLET AND BLACK
 
Candles Plus Hawk
Equal No Romance
To The editors
There is one place on this
campus where small groups of
people can gather in privacy
and comfort for a relating
evening away from the usual
atmosphere of this campus: in
one of the private dining rooms
in the Forum. So one night
four of us tried this new treat
and found it leaving too much
to the imagination.
In a future attempt to create a
romantic atmosphere (the effort
is limited by a large picture
window facing a firewall and
nursing Library, through which
you can see your friends passing by and the library where
you really ought to be studying),
we planned a large candle on
the dining room table and extinguished the lights. After did<
nor and clean-up, we settled in
The dining room for a leisurely
evening of bridge. We discovered that this one candle was
sufficient to see iihe cards by,
so we left the other lights out
in the dining room but did leave
the light on in the connecting
kitchenette.
After a brief interval, the
peace of the evening was
shattered by a sterling pounds
ing on the door, followed by a
sharp command, “Lights have
to be on at all times."
Now I will grudgingly admit
that some light is apparently
necessary to protect the female
members of our college society
from being isolated against
their wishes. Yet it is a verifiable fact (that even the most
minimum of light in such a
mom allows all who would pass
by the expensive window the
opportunity to witness every
movement (or lack thereof) of
the documents. The necessity of
having some large light bearing into our faces seems radical
loss, as well as successfully
describing any Romantic (note
the capital letter) dreams we
may have about life, love, and
candlelight winners.
I have been told that the
Forum Committee never discussed this point or agreed
on this policy. If this is so, then
I hope that the students on the
committee will request such a
discussion.
And even if in some brief mo.
ment of antirRomantic madness
they unwittingly agree to such
a policy, I hope that in retrospect they will review their de
vision and reverse it.
Until then, many turkish
eyes protect our fair young
gardens from any undefined
violation of their influence.

Cynthia trust, one of the
four Grinnell students participating in an exchange pro—
gray at LcMoyne College
this semester.
“Good morning, ladies and
gentleman! Welcome to the
Cook’s tour of the LeMoyne
College campus. Tile time is
now 9:00. We will complete our
tour in sixnandvarhalf minutes,
and then proceed with our tour
of Memphis itselfr Follow me,
please . . ."
And it could be done in six
and a half minutes, for the campus is tiny. Even if we stop at
the green house Where Mike
and Jim live, and walk up the
street to the 4-Way Grill where
we eat when we don’t want to
cook, we could make it; in 10
minutes. But come with me on
a Grinnell tour instead, and
really look at LeMoyne College.
We’ll start from Walker Avenue, and enter the campus un
der the arch which tells the
world that this is LeMoyne.
Across a plot of grass struct
going to turn green is the choosing Brownlee calls This is the
architectural and academic
center of campus. Most of the
classrooms and all of the administration offices are here, as
well as the bookstore and a student lounge. It is built like a
southern mission, complete
with four columns in front In»
side the main door is the flyer.
And the bulletin board. Whenever you want to spend time,
or want to find out something,
this is the place. This bulletin
board is noon announcements,
the post office throwaways,
and the 5&8, miles into one.
Back out on campus, we turn
left and find Steele Hall, the
science building. Since I make
it a practice to stay away from
places like that, i haven’t the
request idea what it's like.
Maybe holiday one of the boys
will tell you.

‘Faces of Mexico'
Photo Exhibit
Makes Debut in Forum Saturday
By Bob Hodierne
“Faces of Mexico,” a photographic art exhibit resulting

Grinnell students, will make its
debut Saturday morning in the
bulletin board area opposite
the Forum desk.
The exhibit. is the brain Child

made their photographic safari
in a'VW and, during the course
of the trip, [00k 600 pictures.
The Show will feature about 50
of those.
The two say the trip wash’t
originally planned with on eye
toward an exhibit. In fact, they
say, the trip wash't really
planned at all. It just happened.
Not until nearly the end of
their trip did the idea of an exhibit occur to them. “Twentyfour hours away is an entirely
 
different culture," said Phillips, “Most people don’t. realize
that. We thought we’d bring it
baCk.”
“We wanted to show some of
the many facets of Mexico,”
said Wilhelm, a 21-year-old
freshman who served a year in
Bolivia as a member of the
Peace Corps. “We wanted to
show Mexico’s beauty as well
as its powerful"
