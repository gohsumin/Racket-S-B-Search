Staff notes To Lower Requirements
For championship
At the meeting of the faculty
last Monday afternoon, it was
voted to recommend to the board
of trustees of the college that the
requirements for the positions of.
chairman oi the lsducationalll
Policies Committee, division
chairman, and chairman of the
faculty be powered, The chair
worship requirements were
voted as three separate options
in the above order, and passed
with ever-following marking,
the last, faculty chairman, by a
vote of only 38 to 31.
It the trustees accept the
faculty recommendation,
assistant pi-oiessors will be
eligible for occasional championships and championship or the
Educational Policies Committee
and associate processors with
lcnurc will be eligible for faculty
championship.
During the discussion of the
options. much was made of the
of The Faculty
compatibility low attendance at
the meeting, since so few faculty
members would hardly constitute
a mandate to the trustees. lt was
decided, however, in accordance
with parliamentary procedure,
that the dc facts faculty, would
consist oi those faculty members
who carey enough to attend the
meetings.
Mr. tests announced that a
special meeting oi the faculty
would he held next week under
the auspices of the committee an
organization to discuss with the
committee the issue at student
participation in the governance
of the college. The students on
the committee are to be permitted to attend the part of the

Loewi would like to see the

right to mention that there are

Loewi had the following to say
about the student body in

showed this in the mass meetings

Cafe de] F pro
For the past three weeks, Grinnell students have
been blessed with an opportunity for relating weekends
such as has long been packing. Jon klein’s coffee house
in the Forum, approximately named Cafe del more,
has provided us with a Weinstube contrast to the
Bierstube atmosphere of the Forum Grill. It is quite
a pleasurable diversity from study to be able to sit
quickly, mapping rider or tea, and enjoy folk music
or other entertainment drawn from the magnitude of
talent available among the students of Grinnelli
Jon has worked a long time to make this coffee house
possible He was one of many students who were
disturbed that no use was being made of the excellent
facilities available'between the Grill and the South
Lounge and aware of the need for a quiet alternative
to the Grill. He did something about it. He has gathered
the best performing from among the students to provide
entertainment, and they are of such quality as to have
surprised many of the students who were unawa
that such talent existed at Grinnell. He has gone to
Des points and Chicago to provide fresh poetry, talked
students into baking cakes and made tea, rider, coffee
and espresso available, Yes, charles, you can even
buy low and labels with cream cheese at the Cafe del
Foro.
Attendance has been somewhat organic. It is to be
expected that the cultural events of a Grinnell weekend
will draw a certain number of students who might
otherwise spend much of the evening at the coffee
house. But they have managed to pack the place several
times. Jon has promised us that he will try to opEn
the coffee house during the week and for longer hours
on the weekends if response continues to be good. We
hope it will.
If you didn’t know about the coffee house, or if you
just haven’t been there yet for some reason, try to
stop by this weekend. You might be surprised.
 
We have gotten several comments, some favorites,
some unavailable, on our policy in the letters to the
editors column. Some people feel that we should device
less space to letters and more to news, campus or
otherwise. We agree with those who are glad we are
providing a forum for members of the Grinnell College
community. We feel that in many cases the availability
of this forum is even more important than the limited
amount of news which a college paper this size can
provide. Oh those occasions when we do not publish
a letter you wrote, you can be sure that it was because
01 space limitations, and not because you disturbed
with us. This should be apparent from the letters in
today’s column. We edit this newspaper because we
feel strongly about campus issues. If you feel strongly
about campus issues, we want to give you a chance
to make your feelings known.

New York Brass printer
By Kathryn Heinze
The New York Brass printer,
performing under the auspices of
the Grinnell College Concert
Series, presented a concert last
Saturday evening February 28 in
l-service Chapel. The printer,
considered to be one of the best
in the country, played to an enthusiastic full house and even
derived a standing station from
a small number of Grinnell
students. The program which
included works from every
century since the sixteenth
presented an interesting sampling of brass music from all
musical periods. Special emphasis was put on the twentieth
century, and for those (ﬁinn
williams who have developed an
allergy to contemporary
music. the intervention provided
an excellent opportunity for exit.
To this writer’s way of thinking,
it is opportunity that so many
people chose to turn chicken and
run away at the threat of hearing
something more modern than J.
5. Each; they missed several
very interesting and challenging
works and corrected the opportunity to see an impressive
array of brass sites which
ranked from a premier’s friend
to a tube cute that was so large
it reminder one of a bookstore.‘
The concert opened with an
anonymous senate from “Die

comes out will represent our best
and most possible efforts. From
time to time, between now and
May, I hope to be able to give

The Nature Of A Liberal Education: Part 3 Bmhﬁan women‘ Didacﬁc
The Principles of Definition Are Discussed Lover. Poliﬁsizes Viewers
By Professor ll. G. Apostle
In framing a definition, one
may proceed (a) effectively or
(b) dramatically; and each of
these methods has its advantages
and disadvantages. For example,
in training a constitution for a
nation effectively, one may
study the past and existing
contributions, compare them and
contrast them, and then choose
what appears to be the best of
all, or else choose the best
elements in them and form What
might appear to be the best
synthesis of those elements.
History sends to teach us effectively what is probably, but
often it does not reveal all the
alternatives. Analysis, on the
other hand, sends to exhaust the
alternatives or possibilities, but
withouthistory and experience it
may not point to what is
probably. Older men tend to using
to what has been probably;
younger men, especially when
existing institutions fall far short
of die ideal, tend to direct their
imagination to simple alternatives and possibilities which on
the surface seem to be the true
solutions to problems. So a
combination of both methods
appears desirable. First, we shall
proceed effectively.
An examination of the
requirements and goals of a
liberal education as given by
Amherst, Carleton, Oberlin,
Williams, and Grinnell Colleges
reveals items which appear to
come under five general
readings:
1. Intellectual conference,
excellence of intellectual
training, breasts of un
outstanding, academic excellence, search for truth,
development of qualities of mind,
intellectual adventure, etc., all
come under ”development of
excellent."
2. Personal and social
response 'city, moral integrity,
qualities 0! character, social
justice, service to others, etc., all
come under “development oi
character.”
3. A third aim, suggested only
by Grinnell in the phrase ”to
achieve a personally satisfying
and worthwhile life” but required
by all, may be said to come in
some way under “appreciation of
arts."
4. Knowledge of some field in
depth, preparation for a useful
career, etc., may be considered
as coming under “a career."

not explicitly stated, required by
all the above colleges) is for the
sake of health, and we may
consider this under “health.”
is this set of goals arbitrary?
Perhaps there is a prior question:
What is the ultimate purpose of
a liberal education',l If this be
happiness, and if happiness is
what is desired most, then we
still have to inquire what is likely
to make us most happy, Whether
we call this allrinclusive aim
“happiness” or “a most removable life" or “a worthwhile
life” or “a life with positive
response” makes no difference,
for names do not change the
nature of our desired or of their
fulfillment; so we may as well
use the term “happiness," for
this has been used most
universally.
Next, we may proceed
dramatically. first, man is a
complex being, and as such he
is capable of many kinds of
treasures.
Second, he cannon go on
throughout life with only one kind
of pleasure, for he has more than
one kind of need. For example,
he cannon eat all one time, or
drink all the time, or play
baseball all the time, or do
nothing but research work all the
time; the returns [If one kind of
pleasure are diminishing, and the
pressure for another kind of
pleasure by its corresponding
need necessitates a change in
activity, This being are case, the
greater the number oi things he
can take pleasure in, the more
likely he is to make a better
choice and so assure himself of
a continuous life of pleasure.
Third, the variety of needs and
their corresponding treasures
call for a certain kind of choice
and hence of an ordering among‘
them. One often has to choose
one kind oi pleasure and let
another go; and if he is to get
“the most out of life," he must
think not only of today, but of
tomorrow and the year ahead,
or still better, of the whole span
of his existence, and so he must
reﬂact, make plans, use principles of evaluation, and,
ultimately, impose a proper
ordering among the kinds of

kinds of learning relative to the
happiness of a man; A sketchy
and promotional definition may
now be given.
A literally educated person is
one who has acquired (a) a
developed mind (in the sense
indicated above) through learn
ing, (b) a good character
through the exercise or the
proper habits, and (c) the habits
necessary to maintain and
promote a healthy body, all of
these for the sake of a Continuous
life or happiness.
The exploration of this sketchy
definition is our next concern.
