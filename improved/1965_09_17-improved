“Does anyone have a car that
they would like to take to Ala»
hama tomorrow morning—there
might be a demonstration and ii
there inn’t, there are always all
kinds of things to do there,” said
Grinnell student Bill Barnes in all
seriousness at the Wednesday
night meeting in South Lounge of
students “interested in” the Students for a Democratic society.
Very little business integrated
the anti-organizational mood or
the meeting. Questions as to the
aims or ms were discussed by
veteran members.
“It’s almost easier to tell about
the aims oi the individual project
because SDS is kind or fabulous."
Jean Vandervoort, past vice president of the Grinnell chapter said.
The closest anyone came to defining the {section oi the group
was Nancy McCannon, who said
that the structure included three
parts: the indigenous movement
which concerns itself with community organization or poor people; the peace movement which
sponsored last spring's March on
Washington protecting the diet
Nam situation; and the campus
movement which played a role in
the Free Speech Movement at

Aims of individual projects were

Grinnell College C oe
A sociological survey was conducted last spring of the sexual
attitudes and practices of Grinnell
women. The survey samples 100
women from all classes in approX<
amateur equal productions
Some of the conclusion drawn
by the Kinsey-like survey were:
I. Ninety-eight per cent or the
sample had engaged in some
type of getting.
2. Twenty-three per cent had
experienced sexual interactive.
3. A greater percentage oi individuals felt that interactive
would be acceptable for them
than had experienced it.
4. The number who have posted and have had interactive
increases with the year in school.
5. dirty-one per cent of the inn
 
divisions felt that their attitudes
toward sex have become more
liberal since entering college.
6. Individuals with no religious beliefs have a higher percentage of both getting and
interactive than individuals with
protecting beliefs and among
Protestants, the amount of sexual activity increases with decreased participation in the
church. Samples from other re«
regions were too small to draw
conclusions.
The survey used Kinsey's begin—
union of getting. it was deﬁnew as
“physical contacts which involve
a delivering attempt to direct
erotic arrival."
The ninety-eight per cent of Grinnell women who had engaged in
 
some kind of getting compared
with ninetyone per cent at a similar age, education, and social
background in the Kinsey report
published 12 years ago.
Kinsey's definition included kissing. When the various categories
of kissing were removed from what
might be considered getting, 77 per
mm oi the Grinnell women had
posted,
The percentage of Grinnell girls
who had engaged in sexual interactive was twenty-three per cent,
as compared to twenty per cent
for a group of women at similar
age, education, and social background in the 1953 Kinsey report.
The report showed that {or all

Sequeiro Explains Aid Plans.
,‘finances Remain adequate' ‘
By ALAN AXELROD
' The financial needs of Grinnell
students are accurately provided
for in monetary gifts awarded by
the college in the form of scholar»
ships and grants~lnvaid. .
“No!” you say? reforms Sequelra, director of placement and student aid, thinks so and further
believes that the story about thousands ol dollars in scholarship
funds going united is a myth.
"We use every penny at the funds
that are adopted to us," he said.
This year 124 ireshmen are get—
king gifts. and the average award
is $783, while last year 163 freshthen received an average or $775.
These totals represent husband»out
gifts and do not include loans or
campus employment. While the
number of ireshman scholarships
went down, the number of fresh»
men went up, from 356 to 372.
However, Sequeira says that there
is no discrepancy in these figures.
“Once accepted, every student
who applies for an needs final-
 
dial assistance gets it,” he said.
Last year the college had $367,000
available for financial assistance.
The total went down this year to
$350,000. “However, these figures
are displaying.” he assisted. “Several scholarship funds institutes a
few years ago have expressed
themselves.”
“There is a continued moreover in
funds available from year to
year,” he said. When gifts prev
video by outside sources are not
adequate, the college must dig in.
to its own income to make up
the difference. When the college
does this, however, there is less
available for the educational en»
surprise, and during years of heavy
outlet of funds for such improvements as the Forum and the new
science wing, the college sometimes finds itself in a bind.
Sequelra predicted that next year,
however, there will be $370,000
readily available, and the college
will be doing a better job iii needs

Although i feel as if I've been
here “forever." i find it hard to
believe that its September, that
summer in the U.S. is over, and
that Classes at Grinnell have begun, in ways it seems that it was
just a short time ago treat I arrived in Chiengmai, got used to
being stated at by the students,
became accustomed to having
dogs, checking (sctawny ones, at
that), and birds going in and out
or the classroom at will, eating
new and different foods, and may»

is a little harder to teach when
you're unprepared! Alter getting

which was fairly free of installed.
l was able to see more of Chieng.
mai, which interested me much
more than did teaching,
Chiengmai, 543 miles north at
Bangkok, is the second largest
city in Thailand with a population
of 100,153 (1960 census) Within the
City limits. Chiengmai is sur
founded by mountains and the
valley is quite textile. Most of the
people are farmers. Besides growing much rice, soybeans, and planets, Chiengmai is noted for its
fruit. 1 might add that it is also
noted for its pretty girls and kind
people, facts which I learned from
correction about 300 competitions!
Right now we are in the middle
or the daily season, the since when
rice is planned and everything is
very green and bush. it dress’t
rain all the time, but it usually
manager at least mice a day or
else it might rain quite steadily
for a day or two and then be
followed by a beautiful siinny
day—it varies, and you can never
 
count on it being one way or the
other. I'm getting quite used to
riding my bike to my Thai larger
age class in the rain and am
finding it a Challenge to keep

One of the things that struck
me most when Larrived was [he
traffic. It's like you've never seen
before and your llle is at stake
whenever you venture forth. The
streets are created W|th bicycles,
cars, buses, trucks, 3-whether m0derived taxes, medicare (man powered taxes), monday. and even
some ox cards. i think the Thai
have a philosophy that says that
the other driver has a steering
wheel and brakes and is Capable
oi using them. when everyone
thinks this way it can sometimes
lead to interesting results. They
pass anytime they wish and hook

showing down. I don’t think any
one listing to these turns, but
maybe they do. Anyway, it is sort
of fun to vancouver in the traffic.
i was also struck by the many,
many little shops that line the
street and seem to be selling the
same thing. I wonder how anyone
makes a living. When I think of
these shops a picture of the red
and white of the voltage tooth
paste. the red, blue, and white oi
a box or Feb, and the orange oi
dealtime can come to mind. These
three companies seem to have
made a “hit" in thailand. Then
there is the market which is
"something else" and proven difficult to describe. in it are many
little months where everything is
sold. You can close your eyes and
tell where you are by the smell—
the meat market, cosmetic, etc,
The food market is probably the
most interesting, for so many of
the foods are new to me and l’m
designated by their looks and their
doors. If you like to bargain and
are adopt at it, you can have lots
or sun handling over prices. The
best time to go is early in the
morning when everyone is buying
food. We often go there at 6:30
for breakfast where, besides eating
interesting good. you see lots oi
interesting people. it's quite a

is all [or this letter. Please write

in classrooms from coast to coast,
and then some. Some took classes
for fun, and some used the opportunity to fulfill requirements for
graduation or for teacher certification. Judy Roberts, senior, was
one of the few lucky ones whose
summer school was far more than
classes, for she studied in France
Ind lived with a French family.

this year by Dave lines and Sharon Sheumaker, seniors, and leg
member, junior. Careers in social
work provided jobs and practical
experience in the field for Holly
Hoebel, senior, and Beth Whittnore, junior, who worked in chicago and Cleveland, respectively.

practice teaching for win Yeisley
 
and carb player, as well as cons
finding one important area of the
college’s exchange program with
Grinnell. Steve thunder and
George Wittgraf and Steve Kent,
seniors. worked in Washington,
D.C. as this year’s PPPE interim.

billy, working on a farm in
France, Cﬂver the becomes. Grinnelilans also served as lemon tickets (Janet Poland, sophomore).

bookstore at the Santa Fe Opera.
and melissa Ward, junior, who
worked in the box»office at the
summer theatre in black, N.Y.
Dave D o n a h o o, sophomore,

took samples of boxcar: of grain,
in order to fix price and quality of
the grain. Jim Wilson, sophomore, updated Chicago area parks
and forest presented for the mosquito statement program. Gary
Wilson, senior, may take the
year's award for most desirable
job; he was spokesman for the
garlic show at the all-Iowa Fair at

Petkovlc commented thoughtfully that a strong, whole Germany
has been the cause of two World

could cause the third. He said that
though France and England claim

Yugoslavia is constantly split with
somebody, and often within herself. The split, he said, “is has“?

Congratulations must go to Coach add powers for the football
preview he put on Saturday. Introducing the players and then showing
the basic Pioneer releases and expenses will surely help the Grinnell
tons to enjoy the game. having the cheerleaders show on the gear of
the players was also geneﬁdial and removable to most or the crowd.
Although the game was not overly traveling, there were a few exist<
log plays, usually happening when the players had to improving after
the original play was abandoned.
>I< >‘t< *
At Lawrence a group of alumni and townspeople formed “The
Lawrence Bench" under the co-championship of a local bookseller and
p former Little All-American football player. The long-range plan of
this organization is to show appreciation to the College for its cultural
and economic contributions to the community. But right away they are
trying to fill the new 5,400 seat stadium for the opening game. Good
luck. it would take a tremendous upsurge in attendance for the counters to get that many people for all four home games.
>l< >1< >l<
The 1965-66 Pioneer sports teams will be out to match the great
success of last year’s teams which captured the conference all-sports
isle. Due to a tremendous surge in the spring sports, the Pioneers took
the title with 34 points, one point ahead of Cornell. Then came Carleton
ind St. Olaf, 37; simon. 45; Beloit, 54; plymouth, 57; joe, 53; lawrence, 61; and Knox, 62.
>I< >I< >i‘<
A former football star is the associate director of admissions.
Nick Ryan Ryan holds a prominent position in the Pioneer record
book. In 1954 in a game against Carleton he gained 213 yards which
is the Pioneer record The 743 yards he gained that whole season is
second on the Grinnell list. He is third in career pushing with 1427
yards, fourth in career total offense With 1538 yards, and fifth in career
scoring with 73 points. He was also ﬁrss team all-conference in 1954.
Maybe with Ryan in admissions we might be able to secure some
dollars who are also star halfbacks.

“All in all. we are quite pleased
with our progress," noted Coach

long in some areas than we were
at a comparable stage in past
years," he stated, but mentioned
that “we still have a lot to do."

“We feel that we have good squad
balanceeat least a couple of good
boys at each position” he related.
“As our customers gain experience, we could be deeper than
last year.”
The interior line, which was
checked by graduation, remains
the big question mark. Only three
batteries—Rick Anderson, Tom
random, and co—captain Paul
Thurston—return, putting a heavy
burden on sophomores.
Lack of size is another problem.
At present, not a single Pioneer
tops the 200 pound mark.
“We are going to have to hit
faster and be more aggressive on
both offense and defense to components for our lightning," powers
pointed out.
The charles and Black came
through the heavy contact phase
of practice in good shape. Veteran
ends Al Peterson and ‘word true
and sophomore quarterback Kent
Thomson are the only ones on the
injury list, but none are serious.
Thomson has been pushing Barry Anderson, last year's regular,
for the quarterback job.

Bidding for offensive roles at halfback are three batteries—corruption John threshold, Dave Syn—
