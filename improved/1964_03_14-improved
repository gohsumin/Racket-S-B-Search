‘Excellence of a Man'
The all-night muscle and battle of getting out an
“extra exclusive edition,” dress’t quite councils with
sitting calmly down at the typewriter and trying to
evaluate Dr. women‘s years of service and contribution
to the college. Therefore, that will not be our purpose
today.
ItJ is opportunity that some of the immediate student reaction to Dr. women’s newly announced position
was touched with authority and wilderness. There are
probably two direct reasons for this. First, the students
were completely taken by surprise— there had been
no~campus reference to the fact that the president was
being considered by SUI, and the 5&3 had never received any word that such a big story was in the making. Second, communication between the president and
the students had been cut off for the greatest share of
the winter due to the extensivarworld tour taken by
the president and his wife. During his leaves of absence,
new student leaders were both selected and elected,
and even though they were looking forward to working with the president, there had been no opportunity
to have recent associations with him.
Perhaps yesterday we felt created; but despite student disagreement with administration policies, and
the breaks in student~administration relationship during recent years, we can hardly feel that Grinnell Col—
legs has been created by Howard R. women.
In his eight years as leader of the college, we have
seen the name and position of our liberal arts inspection
find increasing distinction throughout the nation. Pres—
event women and Grinnell College have become synonymous in educational circles for academic excellence
Disgruntled as students might be with the ideas of a
Grinnell Image, the fact that Dr. women has made
growing contributions to the image of ourcollege cannon be denied. He has served tirelessly during his eight
years here the cause of better education and has sought
to further his ideal of a liberal arts education as contributing directly to personal excellence in the student.
Dr. women is advised by students, faculty and administration, alumni, and friends of the college
throughout the world. During his recent tour, he represented the college to educators in Europe and Asia with
a fingering and academic concern that is qualifying to
see in any person of leadership.
Mrs. women has always been aliavorite of the students. Her warm personality and direct personal concern with the campus and its inhabitants is repeated
wherever she goes.
We will have plenty of time to evaluate, to criticism, and to suggest. Our first concern should be to recognize the excellence of the man who has served us, and
who goes on now to new educational fields and responsibilities. Dr. women’s presence at Grinnell will be
missed, but his contributions will remain. We join all
the friends of the college who have expressed their
congratulations to President women as a scholar, an
educated and a friend. We wish Dr. and Mrs. women the
very best in their new roles at SUI.

Over 100 Applicants In I955
A ten month search during
the academic year 1954-55 calculated in the selection of
Howard women to succeed
President Samuel N. Stevens,
who had designed the J und before.
The search was carried on
by a committee of seven members of the Board of Trustees,
headed by John R. Heath, Chi<
cage attorney. Over 100 applicants were considered. 25 were
interpreted and 15 visited campus, including women.
In a statement to the 5&8
upon the announcement of his
appointment, women Said, “I
look forward with keen notification to joining the community of Grinnell College. One of
the greatest notifications of my
new job will be the opportunity
to meet you, work with you,
and share in your social and
intellectual life. I hope that together we may help to carry
on the fine traditions and the
strong community spirit that
have made Grinneli a listen—
twisted liberal arts college."
Before coming to Grinnell,
women was a professor of economics at Williams College. Of
his departure the Williams Record talented, “With a defining
amount of mixed emotions, the
Record would like to add its
name to the long list of wellwishers of Professor Howard

president of Grinnell College.
The invitation is a well reserved opportunity for the
young professor of economics.

been a hard working, devoted
instructor who has never been
too busy to give counsel to in»

become an important part of
many Williams men’s educa—
tion during the last three years.

ability and quiet, friendly partner. Congratulations, Mr. Bow»
en. We know that you will be
a success in your new position
as you were in your much too
brief Stay at Williams.”
Before assuming office July
1, 1955, women visited campus
several times. On April 30 he
addressed an all-college assembly in service Chapel. In his
first official appearance on
campus women offered several
remarks.
“First of all, I want you to
know how pleased and proud I
am to have been invited to join
you here. I have long been an
advisor of Grinneii. In fact, I
first visited the campus just 21
 
years ago this spring, and on
several occasions have attended
conferences here. But I think I
had not fully understood the tub
tent of its reputation until the
flood of mail began touring in
after my appointment was announced. I wish that I might
read some of it to you. The consistent theme is that Grinnell
is not just‘another small liberal
arts college. It is a Very special
institution with a unique and
precious heritage.
"I have asked myself: ‘What
accounts for the outstanding
reputation of Grinnell and for
the quite remarkable royalty of
its alumni and friends?’ As I
have thought over this ques—
tion, I have reached Several
rental've answers.
“G r i n n e I l’s reputation is
based in part, I think, on the
continuous Stream of talented
students it has attempted, on the
similarly attachments of its
faculty, and on the exceptional
distinction of its alumni. But
beneath these forward signs,
the true source of its strength,
I think, has been its constant
medication to the liberal arts,
its decision to freedom of in
query and freedom of speech,
its consistent practice of democracy in every day campus
life, its concern for each individual students as a distinction
person, and the essential wholesomeness of its social life. And
I think Grinneii has been able to
hold fast to its principles be
Dr. Howard R. women made
the following statement yesterday afternoon at his press conference in the library viewing
room:
“The State University of Iowa
is one of America’s great universities 4 one in which the
people of Iowa mostly take great
pride. I am, of course, hundred
to be elected as president. and
husband by the responsibility
placed upon me.
“I look forward to my duties
especially because of my former association with the university where I was a student
and faculty member for nine
years.
“At the same time, I leave
Grinneil College with deep degree a n d great infection.
Grinneli is one of our country’s outstanding liberal arts
colleges. Through my experience in both public and private colleges and universities,
I hope I may be instrumental
in establishing close ties between the State University
and the private colleges and
universities of Iowa and other
states.
“I seek support and cooperation for the university from the
people of Iowa. An excellent
university is a cultural and economic asset of the first order.
It is one of the prime requirements of a state and nation that
intense to develop culturally
and periodically. I anticipate
that the State University of
Iowa will occurs a steadily increasing role in the develop
ment of Iowa and the nation.”
 
cause of its traditional acceptance to Christian values.
"When I say that Grinnell is a
great college, I do not mean to
reply that it is without problems. Obviously, we come use
more money. Some new buildings are needed. According to
several articles in the charles
and Black, the students might
be more interested in campus
affairs. The word “apache" are
needed several times. Doubt.
less, if I asked faculty members, they would tell me that
students might be more interested in their studies. Perhaps
if I asked Students, they would
tell me that the faculty ought
to assign fewer papers an
grade more generously. 0
course there are problems at
Grinneli large ones and
small ones (and sometimes the
small ones are more troublesome than the large ones).
“But the problems of trim
well can be faced with confidence, when we consider the
basic southwest of the college.
When the present problems are
solved, as I am sure they will
be, they will be replaced by
other problems. A likely, vital
college always has problems.
Awareness of them is a simpson of the urge to improve. By
including and facing up to our
problems, we are able to direct
0 ur efforts independently. I
currently hope that we shall
never be without problems, be;
cause problems represent a
kind of creative dissatisfaction
that will spur us on to build a
greater college.
“50, I, for one, approach the
coming years with a sense 01
confidence. This confidence is
based on the great traditions of
this institution. and on the fact
that we are calculated to construction action by the awareness of problems.
At announcement the new
president commented, “I shall
be learning about my new joli
while Working at it dealtime.
During the summer there are
many things to be done around
a College — even though the
students are gone. There are
problems of Staff recruitment.
finances. admissions, and preparation for the opening of the
autumn semester."
Ludwig comments
permits c. Ludwig, vicepresident of the college,
made the following statement last night concerning
the new appointment of Dr.
women:
“Because so many opportunities for important and
perhaps greater service to
education have been presented to President women in recent years, I think we all
knew that one which he
could not refuse would eventually come along. Even so, it
is hard to accept the idea
that he will soon be leaving
Grinnell College. We wish
him success in his new position.”

degree over the loss of President Bowe'n was mixed with
feelings of happiness over his
new appointment when members of the Grinnell faculty and
administration expressed their
reactions to Dr. women's designation.
“It‘s a great loss for Grinnell," said N e at Klausner

I know anything about. I am
sure that he will be able to meet
the challenges and difficulties
at SUI. He has everything that
is necessary scholarship,
integrity, and statute.”
“My first reaction was one of
pleasure for him," said Dean
of Women Jean Slocum. "I was
greatly impressed by the staff
he has gathered around him,
SUI is very lucky; Grinnell will
miss him. People in whom he
has had faith and confidence
will somehow manage to carry
on.”
members Prescott (journalism) stated, “Dr. women has
done great good. His designation was charitable; the college
has done well to have had him
as long as it has had him, blood
with interest to whom the
Board of Trustees will choose
to succeed him. Will they follow the general procedure and
import someone, or will they
find someone from our own
faculty or administrau‘on?"
Associate Dean dildo Walk—
er said, “I am very sorry that
he is going. I am very grateful
for what he has done for the
college in the last nine years.
I only hope that we can make
an approach at ﬁusing some‘

"It will be difficult for the

a great opportunity for him to

world," commented third career (Eng). ’
Howard Burklo (phil. and

ing because he’s a fine college
president. I hope we get someone as good as he is and who
has been a teacher and has a
close connection with the
faculty."
Retired Dean of Women Evelyn partner said, “I count
myself very corporate to have
worked with Dr. women for so
many years."
“I think it‘s a very great loss
for the college. His appointment at SUI is a recognition
from the state of Dr. women’s
ability as an administrator,"
noted Joseph Wall (hist.).
Winston King (red.) said,
“This comes as a surprise. Dr.
women has pushed the college
forward in the direction it

Students Register Surprise, Shock
At Sudden News of SUI Appointment
"I’m checked," seemed to be
the immediate reaction amOng
the student body when word
came that President women had
been named as head of the University of Iowa,
Across campus, in the dining
calls, and within small groups
people looked at each other
saying, “shall When did this
happen."
“1 think it is sad that: he’s
leaving," Said Ann Van builder,
senior, “I am truly checked,”
followed Alan jefferson, junior, who added, “he was the
college."
Students were queries last
night concerning their initial
reaction to the news, One group
answered as followed
Pete Read, junior, newly
elected Cofl-iP president, “My
initial reaction was one of
shock. Dr. women has contributed a good deal to Grinnell and for most students his
departure will mean a re-evaluation of the so-called Grinnell
Image. We must realize mat
Grinnell’s ideals area’t directly affected and we hope that a
new president can continue
Dr. women’s interest in student
life."
Jim partition, junior, “I am
very surprised. I am also disappointed because I think we
were all looking forward to a
good year with the president.
If this is what he wants, I wish
him the best of luck."
Steve troops, senior,
don't believe it."
Ellen Brodsky, senior, “I am
surprised. I have a funny feeling about the fact mat there
was never anything said before
today about his leaving. He‘s
done a lot for Grinnell; perhaps he feels he’s done what he
can do for us, and that what
he can do for Iowa extends
“1
 
what he could further do for
Grinnell.”
Bill Abernathy, junior, “I was
disappointed in the man be.
cause he had created an image
in my mind which represented
him as dedicated to small liberal arts colleges. 1 cannon help
but wonder if his designation
represents a changing of horses
in mid-stream."
Ann Young, junior, "He will
probably find it a more come
portable situation there, not so
close to the students. I feel he
won’t be able to do the progressive things there that he was
able to institute here."
Jack sherman, senior, this
year‘s president of the Student
G o v e rn m e n t Association,
“President women, in his eight
year centre at Grinnell, has
brought remarkable progress
to the school. Recent efforts
date events have imposed the'
progress. He’s a great man."

slow the school’s academic
process in innovation new programs and building drives.
However I feel that following
the debate over social structure of the college, perhaps h s
leaving will open new roads into considering our institution.
Perhaps we can start over to
typically re-evaluate our program."
Judy request, junior, new
president of the AWS Board,
“The Contribution that press
sent women has made to the
academic life of the college is
noteworthy. I hope it will he
