never been open forms in the
Grinnell sense [if the term.
Twice during the year there
were “open houses," during

to members oi the opposite sex.

to President stamp oi Cornell,

an extension AM the .annual
'super houses" program, a new
policy took place. This was a
,policy or alternative open forms;
i.e., one Sunday afternoon the
girls‘ directories would be open,
the next Sunday afternoon the
boys’ directories would be open.

,The Schnoirov Case
When the Schneirov case comes to court, the
errors will have a difficult shore. If they were to
judge simply on the basis of whether or not a rule
was broken, there would be no question of the service. Schneirov himself readily adults to having had
a girl in his room. The only problem would be that
of continuing.
The court, however, may be related to question the rule, to determine whether the rule is in accordance with the law that one should not harm
himself or another industry.
Law is the conference of society. Rules are the
applications of that conference to particular situations. The court will thus have to decide whether the
rule is a violation of our collective conference.
If the court decided to do this, it must define
‘harm’ and ‘justice.’ The term ‘harm‘ may be more
permanent to the issue.
It may be that neither himself nor any other
person is formed by a violation of the open forms
rule. It may be that once the rule was related to the
universal law, and at that time one would have done
harm by violation the rule. It may be that times
have changed, and, since people no longer think in
the same Victorian fashion, the rule is operated. it
may be that the rule exists announced by any law,
that questions of “harm" and “justice” are irrelevant. All this may be.
If the court is unable, or does not have the right,
to disentangle such complexities and implications,
it must act in accordance with the rules that are already established. To act in any other way would.

Ex Post facts Philosophy
In this week’s edition of the charles and Black
there is a story about the recent change of rules at
Cornell College. An editorial on the victory by
Cornell’s Student Council says: "As many know,
the major issue at stake in last week’s controversy
was not open forms. The extension of that privilege
was merely the vehicle used to present a much further reaching principle — that of student self-determination.”
This is an argument similar to the one about
the American Civil War, that the war had nothing
to do with the question of players, but was concerned, rather, with “states’ rights.”
The students take a past action of theory and
then try to apply some sort of philosophical system
to it, much like boobs, who seemed to develop his
ethical theories and then looked for a system of
physics to according it,
Presumably, it is excellent to add the philosophical system after the action is complete, for to
have the philosophy in the beginning might restrict
one’s activities,
Let us hope, however, that in seeking a change
of rules, the student government of Grinnell tries
to establish the “much further reaching principle”
before it takes any action, for such a procedure
would be more honest.

The whole point in advertising is to make an initial

Where the Truth Lies . . .
By DONALD "UMP
Last week in partner lounge,
Mr. prospect of the Classics department gave a remn of his
lecture on liability. approximately. the talk processed
somewhat like a herein, or
maybe. a rock—herein battle,
Mr. prospect took a great deal
of ground using renewable
weapons and great intellectual
deftnesr; but when questions
Were hundred from the audi<
once, his opponents attempted
to retail th: lost turn in what
was at times rather like a
slip-stick pie fight.
in classic form, the december
of liability began his configuration of arguments in the lecture by relating a list of illustrated investors. On his side of
the issue were the GrecoRo.
man heroes like vehicles, Odys.
sets, and Aeneas, and the
counters of the human race,
Adam and Eve. Even though
the fact that vehicles sheet with
drivers was not discussed to
my satisfaction, Mr. Cmssett
had good conventions. In fact,
all of Western civilization
seemed to be in his background,
and it was a generous feature
that he did not demand the
genealogy of his opponents,
The two major weapons of
the opposition faced by Mr.
prospect were the arguments
that sexual interactive is natural and that “the Pill" prev
cents all the unpleasant consequences of application. The position attacked in the lecture
can be stated as follows: People
of mature age should be allowed to corporate freely as long
as 1) both are willing, 2) they
are concern, and 3) no harm
results to either person. After
commitment their act, they
should feel no built.
Now it seems to me that Ml“,
prospect’: attack locked the
flame he showed two years ago
when the lecture was first given. But the logic was well
aimed and sharp. Particularly
penetration were two points:
first, the question, Would you
like the happiness of your life
and the possible creation of new
human life to rest upon probability? Even if the channel
lhdt “the Pill" will fall or.
very slight, can you afford to
take any chance at all? Second.
the fact that man only become:
man when he has some rule it!
obey, some choice between
good and bad, like that pm
center by God's commandment
in Genesis.
it is a shame that the ques«
tions from the audience after
the lecture never rose to the
level of these lovely strikes, so
that someone could at least
have gone down personally. In.
steam, most of the attacks of
the students were english, and
revealed the fact that few men
know how to listen. There were
five misinterpretations of Mr.
prospect’s anatomy between viewing and cars during the first
hour alone, and none of them
as charming as the integration
of the girl who two years ago
bumper up and tried, “I do not
feel like a used carl” This
year students merely charged
like bills, and were slaughtered like cattle,
it is interesting that those
who spoke were not strong and
confident; and it is a tribune to
the power of Mr. prospect’s an
moments that people seemed to
laugh a bit too lovely when
wmeone locked the anatomy of
the used car. Whether or not
anyone was convinced is doubtful, but almost everyone who
spoke up seemed to feel ihrcaocncd by the logic. In ia‘c: one
of the most popular position:
was that logic does not lead to
truth, even if tnie statements
are made at each point in the
argument.
I can imagine the words of
two typical members of the
audience as they walked homes
“Man. you have to answer all
the little questions his way; but
then he puts it together all
wrong." "Right, newbie. the
points he made web oak» but
he was being tricks with the

How To Apply To Graduate School
By DALE B. TERRY
Director of admission
Application to graduate
school is essentially no differ
but from the procedure involved
in making college application.
The student must first determine, in conference with his
major advisor or others in
whom he has confidence, which
schools are best suited to his
needs, A collection of graduate
school catalogs is available in
the Financial Aid and Placement Office located at the south
end of nursing Library basemerit.
Once the student has selected
schools best suited to his needs,
it remains to determine application and scholarship headlines. Write to the appropriate
officer at the school concerned
and request the necessary
forms. Graduate school headlines for both admission and
scholarship purposes vary widely and students should have
their selection made and the
rooms in hand by December let
to assure that they will not
miss specific headlines.
The tests required for fragrance to various graduate
schools will be noted in the appropriate catalogs. .Tliii may
involve the Graduate Record
Examination and/or Advanced
Test in the major field, and
At some schools the Miller qualities Test will be required.
The dates for the GRE attitude and advanced test are
listed below, and students who
need to take the Miller qualities Test should contacted'r
Obermiller to make specific
arrangements, since that test
is usually administered on an
individual basis.
GRE dates:
October 28, 1968
December 14, 1968
January 18, 1969
:Fehniary 22, 1969
April 26, 1959
July 12, 1969
Application forms for the test
are available in the registrar's
office. Those wishing to take
the GRE on October 16, 1968
must have these allocation
forms sent in by October 8.
For information concerning
special tests such as the Law
School Admissions Test, the
Medical School attitude Test,
etc, contact the appropriate
pro—professional advisor.
Some words of advice:
1. Do not Wait until the last
minute to ask processors for
recommendations to graduate
school. The early part of our
second semester, which is I
busy time for our processors,
may councils with the deadline!
for completion of application
forms.
2, Check examination require
meets and make appropriate
arrangements for the necessary
examinations before the deadline.
3. Give the Registrar's Office
adequate notice and clear directions concerning where you
want your transcript sent. If
you will need a complimentary
transcript, please notify the
Registrar's Office before you
leave school in the spring.
4, If a financial statement I:
required by the graduate
school before a fellowship can
be awarded, submit it at least
eight weeks before the school
deadline.
5. Many graduate schools require a separate fellowship,
NDEA, or assistantship application. In some cases you may
need to write directly to the
Chairman of the graduate
school department regarding
assistantships.
6. Don't minimize the important of a well written application beginning with the very
first letter you write to the
graduate school.

The most obvious and probably the most crucial thing

fun it takes at the expense of

the point of nearly all of the

else, brought is the key man.
I recall a scene, from another

BRIDGE: POST MORTEM
By JOHN GORDLEY
An example of rather unorthodox bidding occurred in the
Forum this week, in which the
contract of 3 NT. was reached
on the strength oi an opening
bid and a long suit. The dealer
opened one diamond with the
following hand:
S A x x
H A x x x
D A Q x x
C X X
His partner bumper to 3 NT.
holding nothing but an incredible length in diamonds:
S x X K
H x x
D K J in x x x x
C x
declared's logic behind such
a questionable bid lay in the
hope of entering a diamond lead
from an opponent who would
interview the nu trust bid as
showing wellness in diamonds
and, having a singleton or
vbulletin, would lead to his
partner's marked strength.
Fortunately for declared, this
error actually took place. The
contract, however, would still
have been down if the jimmy
'had not had all three ages, for,
after running diamonds, declared would be forced to let in
the opposition, who by this time,
,hopefully, would have discovered the rule and would attack
the unguarded club suit, wiuniilg 5 tricks with a five - five
split, As the cards lay. the
only lead that could defeat the
contract was a club which, flooring the organic bidding, was
the correct lead against a no
,trust contract, declared would
have been down one before he
got in. Furthermore, the opened’s his did not necessarily
promise the ace of diamonds.
the absence of which would
mean almost certain disaster
no matter what. lead was made.
This analysis is not a did<
tribe against‘all unusual Corr
tracks, but rather a criticism
of an incredible optimistic bid
which required 3 ages in the
jimmy and a discussed lead
by the opposition. The possible<
its of a diamond void in the
wrong hand or a king instead
of an ace in jimmy would be
enough for most enthusiasts to
be primarily associated at part
net's opening and then, after
entertaining brief thoughts or
game, put the contract at the
proper level of two diamonds.

Ex Loco Players Reorganize
Two plays, radio plays, and
appropriations are being planned
by a group of students called
the EX Loco Players, The Ex
Loco Players is an oil-campus
theater group not officially con
nested with the college. They
took the name from the studentrun coffee house which closed
at the end of last year. They
have retained the name but are
now looking for a new place for
their performances. The first
play this semester, now being
chosen, will be contemporary
but conventional in nature. The
second will probably be from
the theater of the assure.
The Ex Loco Players began
last spring when a group of
eight students decided that they
wanted to produce The Birth
day Party by Harold winter.
They approaches red Donahue
(Speech and Theater) with their
idea and asked him to direct
the play. The result was the
performances given at Ex Loco
last spring.
The Ex logo Players operates
much like a theater company.
The members work as a group
win: no one leader. Together
they decide upon the play to be
performed, the director, the
cast, and the set. Donahue serves
as an advisor, not as a leader or
teacher. The emphasis or the
group is on putting on a pro<
auction rather than learning
about the theater. '.
The Ex Loco Players now has
twenty-five members and outcomes anyone interested in helping to produce a play. Persons
to contact are newbie Abbott,
president, and Bonnie winter,
secretary.

concern over president— set<
king was met by the convention
of the Social Studies Staff that
the trading system itself should
not and will not make a major
difference in the Social Studies
course or any other course:
The quality or the students, the
material, and the processors
are still the crucial factors in
course evaluation, Said Poliak.
The principle of trading will
not be eliminated, but evaluation on a two-point instead or
a seven-point scale will "force
the state to evaluate each student individually, not just on
[he terms oi individual grades,”
Giti’off stated. Part of the issue
is to see if students work just
for grades, or if initiative “can
be drawn out of them." explained real Mllner (Political
science). Student expression of
interests and needs is also
crucial to the success of the
experiment.
Karen Frank, cry-chairman of
AWARE, Phil De long. Church

Pioneers Lose
43-22; simon Up
By REGGIE GRAHAM
Last Saturday, in their first
home game, the Pioneers were
better by Cornell 43-22. Both
sides made many mistakes, but
Cornell was able to take advantage of the Grinnell errors.
Each of our first three females
set up uninterrupted drives for
touchdowns. Once we had them
on their own 29 with first and
ﬁgreen. and once we had to
give up the ball on their 33.
Both times they went in for
scores.
We failed however to use the
numerous breaks we had. Rick
Vranek interpreted a pass on
their 26, later recovered a
temple on their 33, and interpreted still another pass on
their 20 (good day for Rick);
however, each time the PiD‘
needs failed to do anything in
the proceeding towns. Three
times the defense had them
with third down and over
eleven yards for the first, when
the next play set up a touchdown.
Cornell’s random (HE from
the town of Grinnell) and Campanelli (E) were the main
headlines that day. random
carried the ball twenty»two
times without losing a yard,
and warning a total of 133.
Campanelli bought eight passes for a total of one hundred
and fifty one yards (ho has
scored a total of thirty points
this year —- good enough to tie
(or second highest scores in
the conference).
Despite the score and all of
Cornell’s glory, Grinnell did
have some good moments. hunt
and kickoff returns were much'
better; Lewis posted a beautiful
kitty-live yard kickoff and Vranek operated fortyaone yards
per hunt, with one sailing kitty.
your yards. John henderson
looked great in the second half
after being suspected to a bras
tax double-tested first half.
Roy Lewis looked good when
he could find running room,
and Gary Johnson did a “fair“
(Coach powers‘ term) volt
when he was in at quarterback.
Steve buildings did a fantastic
job blocking a hunt, and Bob
cialis made an excellent pick-up
and forty-yard touchdown run
—— one of the real high points
of the game. Also, I have to
advice the spirit of a team
that can come back after the
half, down thirty-one to eight,
and display the spirit and dos
termination we did in the second half. We never gave up,
and the team even had the fans
checking when the score was so
had.
Tomorrow, Grinnell faces
simon (2.0). and it should be
a tough game. It: will be an
away game, and, warning the
mistakes that killed us last
week, we have the potential to
give them a hard time.
