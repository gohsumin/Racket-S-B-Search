“Snowangel” homes; “Chairs" Frenzied and Strong
A Review by MARY MALCOLM
warning’s “Snowangel” and Ionesco’s "The Chairs"
opened Tuesday evening before a very uncomfortable
audience. “Snowangel,” directed by santa compression,
was a serious and forward presentation of a somewhat
initial play. Miss compression’s blocking was inadequate
for the arena theatre. The two actors tender to take positions and keep them during long monologues, leaving the
audience to look around at a very entity stage set.

cigarette, working his chip, swallowing frequently in a obtained
manner. He gave an over-all
impression of a gambling and
nervous actor rather than a
gambling and nervous character.
tricks and trends Thomas, as
Connie, failed to direct their
acting at one another, perhaps
because the two characters in
the play tail to communicate or
be really aware of each other.
Miss Thomas after well at
any given instant, but with a
general inconsistency that settled her performance. She chose
to portion Connie as a very
charitable, hot-compared character, but did so with more
jerklms than flexibility.
“The Chairs” was uncomfortable for the audience also, but
in the way that ionescan drama
intentionally is. J. Dennis Rich
directed the workshop with a
rare combination of creative
imaging and precise timing, His
use of sound effects in the football scene was very effective.

it previously. There was a certain staying in Rich’s prozac<

be presented just a little too
long and carried a little too tar.
The play was too much of a very
good thing. The “overproducing” or the play heightened both
its comic and discussing as

by the actors, Jones' performance was more than competent. He was strong in the

Miss winter’s acting was also
excellent. My only criticism is
that she was playing the same
role, that of a detected old
woman, as she played in “The

talent in this specsﬁc kind of

The present controversy over the membership of a
event production of ”The Chairs” is an opportunity
>evident. It involves a number of complex issues which
end themselves to nasty and dangerous handling.
In this space it is impossible to duplicate and comment upon all the difficulties involved. Two points, however, need to be made.
First, the complexities are intense in this situation
and involve a variety of boundary, past and. presents, on all
sides. These boundary are in some cases inexcusable but
the issues are so involved it is difficult to century anyone
without some qualification.
The second point is that something should be done
to ensure that a similar situation does not arise again.
The role of the college as a sensor needs to be certified
in order to remove both students and faculty from the
edition of trying to second guess the president. What,
proudly speaking, are the criteria which determine
whether any artistic endeavor is suitable for public showing under the auspices of the college? Who should impose
these criteria in any given area? And how and to whom
can the student appeal what he feels is a too statement
opposition of these criteria? These questions need answers.
It is the position of the 5&3 that only in the most
extreme instances should the college sensor artistic endeavor and that in this particular case such action does
not seem certified. The real point at issue is not, however,
this particular case. Rather, some very important lessons
should be learned from this case which will show us all,
students, faculty and administration, where we need to
go in the future.
* i *
As editors go, I am a totally unexciteable sort,
There is, however, one thing on this campus which makes
me very angry. So angry, in fact, that I become instantly
vocational. That thing is not low student wages, nor is it
women’s hours, or even the archive limitations reserve»
tions, though these things do heritage me occasionally.
What really gets my hair up is that large resident of
Grlnnellians which seems to think that nursing Library is
an announcement Verdun. Somehow, they have the idea
that if they take their books home at night, the germany
will move in and take over the fort.
But rather than simply concern, I, like my colleague
who suggested mapping our waitresses, have a construction suggestion to make. I propose to lead a situation of
readers to clear out the mess some evening just before
the library closes.
We can throw away all the trash, and from the looks
of it, most of the tables are at least half covered with
trash. Furthermore, to show our good infections, We could
storage everything valuable and sell it at the WUS aug»
tion. The proceeds could be earmarked for an expanded
physical education program for those without enough
strength to carry their books home at night.

Valid generations
Among the major issues on
this campus, must of which are
ignored by lovely talking and
featuring people, is one which
comes closer than most to the
purpose of this school as a liberal and institution and as a
structure designed deliberately
with the student in mind, This
issue is based on the question:
who should be the ﬁrss to respond to a seeking problem on
campus, the students or the
faculty? To put the question another way: are students’ responses to be their own or are
they to follow the lead of a
“competent authority” on such
matters that occur? Or to
phrase it again differently: does
this school exist {or the sake of
the administration, for the sake
of the faculty, or for the students? Should the student he
told what the proper opinion
concerning a certain matter
should be, or is there such a
thing as a proper opinion?
Case in point: The Chairs, 1:
play by Eugene lonesco, was
presented to the Grinnell audience Tuesday to be taken as it
was. immediately alter the performance, the head of the theater, Mr. Richard Meyer, informed the cast that one section
01 the play was too “gross, lascivious, and observe" to be
shown on the Grinneil stage.
The cast was given the alternative of changing their interpretation of the play to confirm to desired standards, or
the play could not be presented
again. Besides violation plastic integrity and pushing to the
side every concept of theater
ethics reasonable, this action
raises several large questions:
is a student production just that
and no more; is a student production to be considered as an
an form or not; and last, if it
is to be considered an art form,
is it liable to membership by any
thing or anyone other than subsequent student opinion? on, is

the Grinnell education. At the

Second to teach the student how

} Play
(Continued from Page I)
Meyer said the character
of the scene made the play
"unacceptable for the Grinnell
audience.” The scene in question involved the female character's customize of the sex—
url act with an imaginary person.
The female role was played
by Bonnie winter, who commented, “I fully realized what
was involved in the role when
I accepted it. The direct that we
hoped to achieve was to completely discuss and embarrass
the audience.” Her family was
in the audience the night or the
cancellation.
circumstances Confused
The circumstances surrounding the measuring of the show
are both involved and including.
The discussions of the membership among the various parties
concerned have been equally
computing and often emotional
and contradictory as well.
Rich directed the play as an
Independent Project in speech
and theater under Mr. Thomas
louisville, who is new on the
tactilty this year and was a
1964 graduate ct Grinneli.
Somervilie, to whom Rich was
directly responsible, saw a come
piece dress rehearsal and part
0! another rehearsal before the
play was presented, but did not
say anything to Rich directly
concerning the controversial
scenes Somerviile told the
sen, “Nothing was directly
said about the actions of the
girl, but I did say tone down
some of the physical actions and
speed the whole play up." lie
added. “I wash’t lodging it
against u Grinneil audience"
lack! Meyu
louisville went on to say
"I back up Meyer completely
now I just don’t know why 1
old not demand a change in that
molecular point at the play."
her asked about the effect at
the play on the Grinnell audience louisville said: “Grinnell
is sophisticated enough to accept many things, but this
scene was just too resulting."
When asked if he thought the
administration or faculty had
the right to go beyond an ad—
visory capacity and actually
sensor a student artist,
louisville replied, “No commerce.”
Meyer had not seen the
production previous to the open»
ing night He said, “I made the
assumption that the play would
be given in good taste. It was
not given in good taste.”
Meyer said later that the application scene was [he “most
graphic and most distasteiui
that I have ever seen. I don’t
think that it could have been
made much worse."
Reason nuclear
There was much discussion and disagreement between
Meyer and Rich concerning the
reason for the membership
There was confusion over
whether the play was centered
for artistic reasons, moral con<
generations. administration in-
ﬂhence. or all three. Rich
told that the scene was “successfully made shopping, exaggerated and painful" “After
studying Ionesco and reading
his notes on ‘The Chairs.’ I felt
lhnl I should embarrass the
audience and make the audience
feel uncomfortable.”
Rich commented, "The die
sector dress‘t give a damn
about good taste. I tried to give
a faithful interpretation of Ionesco. I do think, howeVer, that
more are still many things
wrong with the play and that:
we need to work on, especially
the timing of it."
Meyer agreed with Rich
that the director's obligation is
to interview as taithtully as possible, " but added, “Our arthur
pic standards are interpreted
with our moral standards.” He
said that the audience must be
considered and also noted that
"a director is not a tree agent
at Grinnell College."
Scene destruction
Meyer said, concerning
the artistic effectiveness of the
play, “that scene destroyed the
rest of the play. One went away
not thinking anything else about
the play. This is my own judy<
ment and I didn’t talk to anyone else about this before I told
Dennis and Bonnie that they
coupon’t put this on again in
this manner."
In a discussion last night
Meyer said, “The offense was
primarily a moral offense —
the scene was inappropriate to
the Grinnell audience.” But he
also said in the Same discussion,
“I'm not trying to protect the
models of the students.” He
went on to say, “If the play had
been presented in a classroom
situation I would have simply
discussed the interpretation and
the reliability at it.“
Meet with mergeﬂ
Rich and several of the other
students involved met with
President suggest yesterday to
discuss the membership. suggest
said that there was a difference
between a student director in
an academic situation and the
normal role of a directory The
student, he said, comes under
the academic judgment of the
faculty members He added. “As
I understand it, Mr. Meyer
kinds the play unacceptable
dramatically and I accept his
judgment on this.” In a discussion with Rich on the scene in
question, suggest commented.

"I understand that Mr. louisville told you to tone down that
scene.” Dennis replied, “That
is a instant lie." santa Huvav
lesbian. director of “Snowangel," and who was also present
at the meeting. told suggest, “I
thought ‘Sllowllngel’ was more
objectionable totally than was
Dennis’ and less suitable to be
shown to a college or any audience. ‘The Chairs' was more or
an intellectual drama.”
"black" Controversy
It was also brought up at the
meeting with suggest that “The
black," directed by Meyer and
presented last year during Parents’ Weekend, caused some
entertainment to the college
when some or the mothers present complaints. suggest said
that he thought part of the reason {or the criticism was that
the performance was somewhat
limited by the abilities of the
amateur actors here He felt
that this caused some misinterpretation oi the play. He said
that when there is criticism he
is “the one that has to answer
all the letters.”
Meyer commented on “The
black" by saying “I made an
e rror in presenting “The
black” on Parents’ Weekend.
Otherwise it was It wireless
Show. But the experience made
me more Conscious of the fact
that we should not make errors
in the future.”
Undefined Viewpoint
Meyer had previously referred to “past administrative
experience” as a factor in his
decision to sensor “The Chairs."
The part that the “undefined
administration v i e w p o i n t"
played in inﬂsending the membership was an additional compensation in any discussion of the
moral and artistic objectives to
the play Meyer said, "Personally I’m against all forms of
membership, but you are not a
free agent at this college. usually the show should stand on its
own beer, but we should face
the fact that the college sponsored it."
suggest later told the Ser,
"Everything that is put on
on this campus, whether you
like it or not, carries the over-

tones of institutional applicant"
He went on to say “I’m going
to reserve the right to say that
some things are adjustable to
show to a Grinnell audience. I
think that I have a high tolerance though." Concerning the
possibility oi personally reviewing the play and then passing
judgment on it, suggest said.
“Mr. louisville and Mr. key»
er know more about this than I
do When a faculty member
finds a work unacceptable I
have to either accept this or
get rid of him."
Alter meeting with Rich last
night, Meyer told the SM}, “I
hope that in discussion with
Dennis and his Cast We can find
ways to play the scene that
would satisfy them dramatically.
And it we can agree with them
on this then we may have a
performance in the very near
future.”
