From The President
Dear Studentsl
it is good to have you here. The place inn't the same without
you. As one ot my presidential colleagues, l-harold store, once remained,
A campus is dead when its students are not there; it hums
when they are. Not only are the students themselves galvanic
but they salvation everyone else 7 faculty, means, treatments,
and campus police. The annual return of the students inspired
in everyone connected with a college the mixed feelings or
a happy homecoming and the darkness or people who are come
pulled to live in occupied territory.
I wish he had Said II more cheerfully, but he had been at the
job longer than 1, and the important thing is his accuracy. which
Is unquestioned. The purpose or a college, to paraphrase Alfred
North Whitehead, is to units the old and the young in the imagination search (or knowledge; but without students to seek. to respond, and to question, a college is nothing, only a group or
separated adults searching for something to commit their learning
and their ‘hopes to.
Grinnell is not this, For 122 years it has been concerned with
the way its students and faculty and its academic environment
interact with one another [0 provide an intellectual and social com«
munich or style and strength and purpose. It is, as I wrote you
newly entering students some time ago, and as you returning
students know, neither perfectly free nor perfectly ordered. it has
some or the maintaining and computing aspects or real lite in gem
oral, and a good deal of the full and integrating characteristics
ol the scholar’s life In particular. It requires from all of us patients, hard work, and a disciplines way oi talking and writing and
behavior.
But Grinllell will give us much in return: new friends, the
satisfaction ol accomplishing things intellectually that we thought
were beyond us, the sense or our own fitness to belong in an iiitellectual community. Above all, it will give us the opportunity to
execute our implications so that we can manage better than we
do now both the strange and exciting world inside us and the
puzzling and sometimes terrible yet remarkable world utilSlde.
The publication 0i this inside and outside imagination is What. edtb
nation in the liberal arts means, and What finally, Grlnnell is all
about. i hope you see it this way too. Welcome and welcome back,
and my best Wishes iii a successful year,

paper will not be questioned. charles {it Black intense to
be bound by relevance, taste, flexibility and law, but by
nothing else. A good paper must have inner discipline

its awareness of its responsmility to provide Grinnell students with accurate and relevant news and comment.
