At 4:30 PM. last Tuesday in
the Grinnell Police Station,
Justice of the Peace Ed Lincoln
heard the case of State versus
add powers. Mr. powers is
charged with assault under ar»
title 691.4 of the Iowa Code in
an incident that occurred at a
private faculty club party in
Main Lounge on December 18,
1969. Mr. powers allegedly
showed Lawrence Frank, 1408
East Street, and struck him on
the arm while Frank was attempting to take photographs of
the party.
In the trial Tuesday, the State
called two witnesses, Frank and
Kenneth business, a Grinnell
student. Frank certified that he
and business entered the lounge
at about 7 P. M. and had begun
shooting pictures and talking
with faculty members, when Mr.
powers led Frank to one of the
doors and began discussing the
picture-taking with Frank.
Frank certified that once he listed
the camera above his head to
take a picture of something
behind powers. powers, he said,
put his hand on the camera and
showed slightly 7 blocking the
shot. Later, Frank certified,
powers struck him on the arm
as he was attempting to take an-
. other picture.
The defense also called two
witnesses. Mr. Nick Ryan,
Director of Placement and Student Aid at Grinnell, certified that
the dinner was a faculty club
party and that no students had
been invited. He said that he had
talked to business at the doorway, asking him to leave, while
powers talked to Frank. Ryan
thought that powers asked Frank
to leave. He_ said that the
discussion between Frank and
powers was not heated.
Mrs. pda harrison, Secretary
to the Dean's Associates certified
that faculty members had paid
for their dinner. The club, she
said, is a membership club. Mrs.
harrison also said that Ryan,
powers, and Mr. Raymond Boyd.
Assistant Professor of Physical
Education at Grinnell, had asked
Frank and business to leave the
party.

Justice Lincoln asked the
defense to file a brief. He
promised to hand down his
decision on or before February

Last Semester there were
rumors on campus that the
employees of the Building and
Grounds Department of the
college were considering the
formation of a union. These
rumors were confirmed recently
in a statement released by the
President’s office. the text of
Pre-professionals: Ph.D. Buyers’
market in Academic World
Ph. D candidates seeking jobs
this winter quickly found out that
the supply oi‘teachers has exp
needed the demand for them.
At the annual meeting of the
Modern Language Association in
Denver, only half the number of
departments requested new
members this year than did last
year. One department chairman
reported receiving more than 600
applications for five positions.
When the American Historical
Association met in Washington.
it was reported that 2,000 men
were seeking only 400 positions.
The greatest scarcity of jobs
seemed to be in the Humanities:
however, men in the physical and
natural sciences reported that
they were finding it increasingly
difficult to secure jobs.
Among the reasons cited for the
job scarcity are: There was a
vast increase in student
enrollment in the early 1960’s.
Many of these students went on
to graduate school and then into
the teaching profession. In addition, John C. member, chairman
of the department of English at
the University of Iowa, noted that
the academic life was becoming
increasingly attractive to young
people. He said that 80 per cent
of the motors in Iowa’s department of English plan to teach.
Further, there has been a
reduction in the rate of growth
of undergraduate enrollment
which means that departments
have not been expanding their
states.
Henry w. cams, chairman of
the department of English in the
Pennsylvania State University,
noted that Students in graduate
schools have shown an increasing
resistance to teach freshmen. “If
one of them had said, I like freshmen; I want to teach them, I
would have picked up the
telephone and Offered him a job,
budget or no budget," Mr. cams
said.
A faculty member from a
relatively new institution in the
South, who was at the meeting
in Denver, commented:
“We’re getting applicants this
year who worlds't have created
of applying several years ago. I
really feel sorry for some of these
follows."
Many radicals and women are
especially worried about the
showtimes in the job market. The
radicals expressed the opinion
that the job showtimes would
create an “army of the unexpected” from which the in
situations would select only the
most conservative prospects. lt
was further noted that, in a tight
market, women do not get hired.
This situation was said to exist
particularly in the field of
history.
which is below. Contract
negotiations are to begin in early
February, and a lawyer, James
L. Rogers, will represent the
College in its negotiations with
the union in question, the

Apparently aware of the interest in organization on the part
of Buildings and Grounds employees, transfers Local
Number 90 sent a labor organizer
to the campus early last
semester, and he obtained the
signed qualifications of several
employees to represent them in
collective containing. After 47 of
the 92 Buildings and Grounds
employees had signed such
qualifications, a first meeting
was held the night of November
20th at the Grinnell Chamber of
Commerce Building, where the
potential union members were
addressed by Paul real, a
representative of transfers’
Book Store Addition Announced;
To be Completed
At a meeting of the faculty and
staff early this week, President
of the College Glenn suggest
announced plans for the construction of a new addition to the
College Book Store. The addition
will extend beyond the current
location of the. book store to the
east and add several thousand
square feet to the present japan
its of the store, enabling it to
handle an increased volume. The
building has been planned to
reﬂact the architectural styles of
nursing Library and the Forum
and will form with these buildings an synthetic triangle of similar glass front architecture sur-
by September

Although the Library and Book
Store committee has yet to decide
on the final disposition of the new
space, it is known that the
present drop of a few steps into
the area of the book store will
be retained at the present point,
and that the new addition will
be at ground level. A covered
walking is to lead from the rear
of the book store into the entrance
of the Post Office, thereby elimination the dangerous accumu

Local 90. A question and answer
period followed his address.
Later, on December 22nd, an
election was held among the
employees at the college at which
it was voted by a majority of
67 to 25 to allow the transfers’
Union to represent the workers
in collective containing with the
college.
During the period of these
negotiations, David forward, a
Grinnell College student, was
functioning in the capacity of a
“participant observer," part of
his work for an independent
project in political science taught
by Dr. real A. silver, Assistant
Professor of Political Science.
forward has commented that one
of the major issues involved is
the payment of equal salaries to
mails and monitors. It is im—
contact, he believes, that equality
of these sites be demonstrated
in word and need in employment
and hiring practices. Com,meeting on this, college ads
registration officials have
pointed out that the mails and
monitors actually perform quite
different tasks, with the monitors
occasionally being called on to
do heavy listing. Nonetheless,

inside that the medium involved
in the jobs of the mails can be
as wearing as the heather work
of the monitors.
The cost increase anticipated
in meeting union demands will
serve to explain to some extent
a rise in the operating deficit of
the college over the year.
Although not all salaries are to
be raised, according to the
union‘s demands, to the same
extent as the mails,’ the cost'to
the college represented by
buildings and grounds will
possibly double by 1971.

shown on the north wall is to remain part of the plan is under consideration.

Late last semester a group of students, includ—
ing the Senate, composed a paper entitled The De»
vision-Making Progress at Grinnell College: The
Student Position and Proposals for Structural
Change. In it they offered a program for student
power in academic, social, and administrative matters, The arguments for this assumption of power,
such as they are, rest on two principles. First, since
the education of the students themselves is the reason d’etre of the college. they ought to have a voice
in the circulation of the policies which directly affect their education. Second, the principle of demo-

crazy ought to be operating in any liberal arts col-'
legs, both because it is interested just and because
student participation in government is a valuable
educational device by which the college can produce
responsible and intelligent graduates These are
beginning arguments, as evidenced by their growing
acceptance on many computer, One can perceive in
the student manifesto the historic of self righteous
integration and a certain smugness that comes from
the belief that here at last is a call to radical action
which is not simply an invitation to destruction. Unfortunately, these arguments, written in executive
prove, rise above the instead only to reach the level
of faculty.
We agree wholeheartedly that the education of
the students at Grinnell College should be the primary concern of the administration, faculty, and
mirabile dirty, the students themselves, From this
principle, however, it does not follow that equal student participation in the circulation of college policies is the best means to this end. Particularly in
academic policy, it is madness to give a
equal vote to the students who have explicitly admitted by their presence in the college that they do
not know the matters which they propose to modern.
There is perhaps some validity in the anatomy
of a doctor and a patient. Clearly, the end of the re
internship between the doctor and the patient is the
health of the patient, But is it not assure to believe
that the doctor and the patient ought to have an
equal vote in choosing the appropriate medicine or
treatment? To believe this is tantamount to beginning that cordless or truth may be determined by a
majority vote. Of course, the doctor may make a
mistake and it is even possible that in a given instance the patient may happen to be right and the
doctor wrong concerning the best remedy. But if
the patient districts the notices or the skill of the
doctor he is free to consult another man. In most
cases, however, it is the doctor who is in the best
position to determine what is conducted to the
health of the patient. Similarly, we believe that the
faculty and administration, though they have, at
times, shown an embarrassing lack of good sense,
are in the best position to corporate academic and
administrative policies. And in a small college such
as Grinnell where almost everyone is forced to live
on campus, there is some question as to how much
we can separate social policy from academic policy
without making the latter interactive. We deny that
democracy should be the political principle operating on campus. In fact, in the present situation, we
are best governor by a genuine aristocracy, albert

resist answering Krystina german’s letter in the last issue of
the 8&3. Although the code
vegetable criteria in it dress’t
warrant a reply by anyone, the
serious question which she raises
does. Further, it reserves a reply
from someone whom she’d
regard as being in the local

as chairman oi last year’s Com

First, let me fulfill her (and
many others’) expectations by
pointing out that she has not done
the homework required of a good
journalist: she has not gathered
to read the document which
replaced the old Board of Publications with the Committee
“Statement of Revised Duties for
Committee on Student Publications and Radio,“ see Faculty
Handbook, pp. 79-32.) If she had,
she would have learned that the
Committee is not “nominated by
the faculty-administration
block.” Rather, its voting
membership completed: “three
faculty members nominated by
the Committee on Faculty organization and elected by the Facility
and three students appointed by
the President of the S.G.A. and
have some measure of trust in the faculty and administration, although we admit that this is a prospect accordingly distasteful to many. This is not to
say, of course, that students ought not to be consult—
ed in all these matters or that, on occasion, some excellent innovative ideas have been proposed by students. But in the long run we believe that student
power would tend to be more corruption than educational,

(17.50.)
Also, she would have found no
documentary evidence whatsoever supporting her application
that the Committee is protecting
“the college’s status que image.”
instead that body is solely concerned “to protect its (the
College’s) legal interests;" less
euphemistically, to protect its en»
comment from legal suits arising
from fabulous material in student
(publications. That this is the sole.
operational concern is evidenced
by the fact that the document
permits the College to withhold
puhlicationof such material “only
when it has been advised by legal
counsel that its legal interests are
in jeopardy.” (See “Statement of
Policy and Procedures: Student
Publications,” which supplements and statements the
above mentioned Statement and
which is 3 available from the

otherwise? Could it knowingly
allow unlawful material to be
published?

include a value clause stating

the partners would simply take

lay plans for their January 30—31
conference in Des points and to
discuss their new community
action program, “Action Now.”
The conference will be held in
conjunction with an Iowa Repub—
local Party “Mission 70" conference that same weekend. In a
letter to the College GOP chairman, Calvin trade, Chairman of
the College Republicans of Iowa,
said that the purpose of the two
conferences is to launch the or»
conventional and financial
campaigns [or this election year.
The theme of the College repair
local conference is “Involvement
70.” Plans call for participants
to attend a session of the Iowa
Legislature on Friday and to
participate fully in the
Republican Party conference on
Saturday. In addition, discussion
groups on topics of special interest to the College Republicans
will be arranged as time permits.
The “Action Now” program is
being directed by Phil basics, a
Grinnell College sophomore. According to Mr. trade, the program is to be twofold. First,

centers will act as clearing
houses for complaints from local
residents and will attempt to
bring problems to the attention
of government officials who can
help. A similar center has been
operating in the ghetto area of
Detroit for almost threeyears.
The other phase of the “Action
Now” program is to encourage
voluntary community action and
to stress the need for Republicans
to become involved in worthwhile
community projects. National
Republican headquarters will be
conducting an educational
program on the problems of drug
abuse, conservation and pollution. “Local clubs will be asked

What follows is the text of Dean
Wall’s letter to colored Steger
notifying him of the Executive
Committee's approval of the
program.
colored Jack M. Steger
Department of Aerospace Studies

Grinnell, Iowa
Dear colored Steger:
This is to inform you officially
that both the Faculty Committee
on Academic Standing and the
Executive Council of the College
have approved of the proposal for
an acceleration of the playing out
of the AFROTC Unit at Grinnell
College, to be effective by 1 September 1971.
This year's class of six
sophomore men now enrolled in
the program, in order to complete the academic requirements
to be commissioner as officers
in the United States Air Force
at the time of their graduation
in May 1971, will have to take
6 hours credit in Aerospace
Studies during the academic year
1970771. The Committee on
Academic Standing gave serious
consideration to these men to
facilitate their completing the
academic requirements of the
program during their junior
year, including positions for downloads and for counting the zero—

ing their upperclass secondary
field requirement if the cadets
so wish. The Executive Council
has approved of the Committee’s
suggestions.
We shall again further word
from you regarding the playing

not defined in the document so
as to allow the editor leeway.
This is a far Cry from Miss
german's allocation that tale

As for her convention'that the
editor’s opinions must "confirm

has read the 8&3 over the last
two years that the editors’

being evidence of a “compromise
conspiracy” between the two
main political sections in the
college, this is an housing accident. As everyone knows, the
preventing political permission at
Grinnell is Old baptist.
Out of all these false premises,
Miss german draws her conclusion: “Obviously the campaign for restructuring . . . .
Grinnell publications must be
represented.” That this conclusion is by no means obvious,
however, is indicated by the
recently disseminated “Student
Position" paper. With respect to
the Committee on_ Student dubai-
nations and Radio it become
minds: “The membership,
structure and duties of this com
little shall remain as they are
presently defined.”
Still, list it be claimed that the
faculty’s collective imagination
is limited by the students'
suggestions (as I sometimes
fear), I will present some tbaoke
ground for the consideration of
one ofMiss german’stwo serious
suggestions (the other in-
valves printing techniques, which .
I am involvement to discuss):
“Investigation of the formation
of an independent student core
location which would be responsible for all student‘s publications.” This is “not unrealistic,” she argued; “the Harvard

france.” Now, even though we
know Grinnell as the “Harvard
of the West,” I would remind us
of one difference: Harvard’s
enrollment is about 16,500; Grinnell’s, 1200. This is a difference
which makes a difference when
one tries to detroit Students to
do the extra work required by
an independent newspaper.
Besides having to find ones who
are willing to act as editor and
business manager (positions
which the Committee has not
been able to fill for more than
one semester), the corporation
must find some who are willing
to sell the publication, Anyone

which must be made regarding

that it really must be inde

that before the Committee was
established the possibility of an
independent corporation was
discussed inrormally with some
S.G.A. officials and discussed by
them at least on these financial
grounds.
Let us assume, however, for
the purposes of further argument
that some group of students is
willing to tackle these financial
problems and establish an inde

What other factors are relevant?
<1) The college now uses the
student media as practical for its

of an independent corporation.
(2) The corporation would have
to ask just what the Committee
asks, namely, that is as publisher

from fabulous material in its
publications. The difference is, of
course, that it may be more
liberal in its assessment of What

by not serving the greater Grin

on of “rights" will be both forecast and fundamental. it seems
to me, therefore, worthwhile to
examine die idea of “rights," for
I find that each group 7 “fiction” is what Madison called
319,111 in his now forgotten 10th
federation # pays far more attention to the word modelling
“rights" than it does to the word
”rights” itself, to the basic,
fundamental, relevant. essential,
real, true thing. We have
“human” rights.‘ women‘s"
rights, “student” rights, “AfroV
metro-black" rights, “silent
majority” rights — but all these
groups seem to take the existence
of“rights" for granted.
We should observe first that the
very word “right" presupposes
not only a system of mobility but
also an absolute system of
mobility. “Situation-ethics.” as.
relatively 'and immorality are
now euphemistically (but
euphoniously) called, are not
relevant to “rights." I find,
however, that those who most
inside on their “rights" are
'relativists, thatTthey argue
against absolute mobility. It
would seem that until they
resolve this contamination they
ought to terrain from assistance
and apply themselves to
electoral logic and philosophy.
If the universe be meaningless
and the result of chance, if nature
be ”awareness," “witness,” and
synthetic, and if there be no
“better nature or God” — as Ovid
put it 7 there can be no such
thing as a right. Existence would
be no better than nonexistence,
life no better than death, and
whatever was would be right
simply because it was. The
concentration camps of the
basis, the activities in diet Nam,
the trial of the seven at Chicago,
the FBI, the done posters,
Barbra Streisand, and Peter
honda 7 all would be equally
“right”alld have“rights."
If, on the other hand, nature
has meaning and either is itself
the “better God“ or the result
of His cordless (though
corrected, of course, by man),
then rights, and brings, exist 7
but only as concerned by nature
or God Without Such concerning,
man has no rights under either
meaninglessness or providence.
Thomas Jefferson, as even a
least, was far above both the
acoustic and the attempt, and for
all his iuzzymindedness, he
granted this point: as the
Declaration of Independence puts
it, men are ”enjoyed by their
Creator with certain unavailable
rights.” The existence of a right
pro-supposed a converter of the
right.

A “right”, then, is a species
of the genes grace. (I harry the
argument, I know, but a letter
is not the place to work out all
the details: those concerned to
know more will find me ac»
possible). Man exists as man
because God allowed him to; his
first job is to understand what
a man is, so that he can, in
linear's words, “become what
he is.” The essence of man is
free will operating on the basis
of reason, for even love is
provided in reason. And free will
presupposes choice, order. and
responsibility. Those ab—
directions contain in them the
process of existence, desire,
analysis, pleasure, and pain, on
the basis of which we judge and
arejudged.
The same groups which cry for
their “rights” stream for the
power to obtain them, as if rights
intended on power. Power is, of
course, an indispensable means
to any action; but power does
not make right, nor is right
destroyed by power. Power, you
see, is only physical, whereas
right is moral. mobility is to
power as form is to matter: a
bad mobility is a bad form and
will shape matter in adjust and
unbeautiful ways, A bad power
is matter moving without reason,
Hence the Worst mobility is that
in which power becomes a means
to mobility, as if the end could
ever justify the means,
The only safe and same and
functional way is the moral way.
And the moral way is the way
of man’s essential nature,
reason, for every man is a
potential animation of the Logos,
made in its. and His, image.
Grinnell, 1 understand, participated in the Vietnam
Moratorium. If the College did
not — in that Mora (delay) A
wonder the question of “rights,”
it would be an appropriate
suggestion this term to declare
another Moratorium, to be
devoted to this question. May I
hope that such a Moratorium
already exists? It is called the
“term," and we are now
beginning it. Come, let us reason
together.

The Associated Colleges of the
Midwest, as you have all been

to the pursuit of Good Clean Fun
at the intercollegiate level. It
consists of colleges which send
athletic newsletters to each other
and to the Press. The minute he
gets these Lloyd puts them in my

Crucial Trip
The Grinnell Pioneer
Basketball team beat Beloit 7560
last Saturday after losing to joe
the night before. Two weeks ago
the camera opened conference
play with a road trip to North
field, Minnesota and bottles
depending league champion St.
Olaf and then Carleton.
The Pioneers faced a tough
Carleton team and were leading
going into the last few crucial
minutes of the game until the
girls put on a sudden later game
surge and took the victory away
from the Pioneers, finally winning by seven points, The next
night, Grinnell played an inspired
game against St, Olaf. Grinnell
was forced into overcome before
losing by four points. The Oles
are currently leading the Mid»
west Conference with a 4-0
record. Sophomore center Bob
current played a tremendous
game and led all showers with
29 points. St. Olaf’s two all»
conference players could not stop
current as he played his finest
game of the season. This road
trip proved that Grinnell is
capable of heating any team in

On January 16th joe invited
party Gym and coastal to a 10362 win over the Pioneers,
becoming the first team in the
league to break the century mark
this season. Junior Scott canyon
and senior captain Don Peterson
led the disappointing scoring with
eleven points each, while
sophomore Greg combining had
ten points.
The next night was a successful
one for the Pioneers, as they
failed down their first home
conference victory of the young
season. The Pioneers displayed
Beloit and rolled to a 7560 visitors. Junior Greg Bumbinski
scored 18 first half points and
finished with a game high of 21
points. canyon and Bombinskihit
double figures again, scoring 17

Tonight Grinnell plays at
Lawrence against a team which
was country better by Beloit.
The Pioneers are covered to beat

Win delays
By reggae Graham
The ups and towns of the past
two years have produced an
excellent group of swingers.
Many of us have come up from
poor to medicare backgrounds
With the help of Coach Obermiller, and we are now a team
of winners. Enough said:
Examine the results of last
week's Grinnell delays.
The annual occupational affair
was attended by three none
conference schools: Wayne State
University, The University of
Northern Iowa, and Luther
College. These are large schools
compared with Grinnell and
usually afford excellent competition. This year Grinnell
produced an outstanding performance. We are in good shape,
just closing out our two weeks
of prersemester, two-a-day
workouts. Our relay teams took
first in eight of the ten events,
placing second in the other two.
In a delays meet such as this one,
swingers compete in pairs as
teams. Thus, for example, in the
200 yard butterﬂy, Jim William's
and cal Dale’s times were
combined. Their total being less
than that of any other team, they
won the event, the graphics, and
missed from the queens (Kathy
New Wrestling
Coach interpreted
When I went to party on
Tuesday afternoon I found
patrick Hunt in the locked room
with his four~man wrestling
squad. The team was preparing
to leave later that afternoon for
a meet at Wartburg. and there
hadn’t been time to arrange a
trainingmeal.
”Don’t worry,” he said ”a
hungry man is a dangerous
man.” and he sent them off to
the Forum for their training
meal.
Hunt comes from Kentucky
State College (captain of the
football team) by way of Gary,
Indiana’s city school system,
where he taught and coaches.
Coaching the wrestling team of
a school with an enrollment of
more than 2,000 (compared to
Grinnell‘s 1180), he guided at
least one of his wrestling to a
city championship. And all novels
sharing pages aside, it would be
difficult not to wonder what his
reaction to coaching at Grinnell
has been.
patrick is disappointed,
though weekly sensitive to the
athletic situation at Grinnell, and
texas willing to talk about it.
First of all, Grinnell does not
have a reputation as the sort of
school at which highly competitive athletes can do great things,
and A c M, regulations prohibit
any recruitment of prospective
students by coaches. So the
college must depend, says Hunt,
on alumni assistance and team
records within the conference.
But alumni of Grinnell tend
towards urban areas, and urban
athletes tend towards large

Abbott and Val gilbert). Records
of the previous Grinnell delays
have been kept, and several were
broken this year. The 1000 yard
lifestyle is a new event for the
delays, and the team of John
explain and Mike sales set a
good mark toward which future
teams can aim. Don links and
myself set a new diving record;
Bruce collins and Jim cards, a
record in the 60 yard lifestyle.
collins and Steve Ward broke the
1000 yard lifestyle record, and
the acceptable distance team of
sales and explain set a new
record in the 500 yard lifestyle.
A new 400 yard lifestyle relay
record was also set by the team
of Ward, cards, Chris Freeburg,
and collins.
Individually, Mike sales didn't
get into the pool without breaking
schools which can offer the business and professional programs
as well as their athletic extensions
and scholarships. Nor can
Grinnell draw to the Same extent
on alumni and organizational
penalties as can schools like St.
Olaf, forinstance.
Hunt, who also coaches the
football and track teams, feels
that despite these drawbacks, the
college can attract talent in particular sports by virtue of team
records in these sports. He sites
as an instance the increase in
prospective football players after
last year's winning season.
But no matter how good his
wrestling, he is logged by circumstance and experiences, in
this aspect. The wrestling team
at its full strength will number
five men: Jim lesser, Mason
Klippell, Washington boston,
porn cardiff, and Chuck Farr. As
a complete team should cover all
eleven Weight classes, Grinnell
must perfect most matches in dual
meets before they are into their
rights and out of the locked room.
Consider also this: Grinnell is
stated to meet Hofstra next
Wednesday at Iowa City. Hofstrau is ranked well up in the
top-ten small-college wrestling
teams in the country, and the
Grinnell squad is understandably
nervous about the meet. Hunt,
chinese feels that this scheduling
is a mistake, thinks that there
is a real possibility of strong
individual performances making
a contest of it. But the fact
remains that a meet like this
sends to discounted the team, and
perhaps more importantly, can
present an erroneous picture of

old pool record in the 500 by
swimming a 528.4. 1 scored
213.60 points to get the individual
diving record; collins spam a
28.5 second 60 to get the in
dividend record in this event.
Coach Obermiller thinks the
team is in excellent shape, and
is looking forward to a whole
season of meets ending as has
pill as our delays.
The second dual meet of the
season is Saturday (the first was
with joe before vacation, and we
won it hanging). We face sons

of excellent teams. They beat us

its genuine strengths. This sort
of thing also can exhibit the team
from washing in, as no doubt the
football team did, on an attractiVe record, and from good perl
companies that looked good.
But, given all this, What accounts for the apparent apache
of Grinnell students towards
variety participation? Here the
coach was generally puzzles. He
pointed out that wrestling, like
track, drivers from :ghost roller
state sports in that'th’e'focus of
blame and attention is on the
individual, and that he has little
chance to cover up mistakes and
inadequacies. 0n the other hand,
he feels that individual completion has as much as, if not more
to offer a highly motivated
achieve than team sports. Training is limited to about ninety
minutes a day to find a balance
between conditioning and prisoners,
Hunt’s city champion was a kid
he buttonholed on the basketball
court. who first came on as team
manager and only later wrestled
himself. But of those who signed
up for wrestling at Grinnell, most
did not even appear. And of those
others who show an attitude for
the sport, but will not come out
for it, he can only shake his head
at their lack of interest.
While wondering that he anticipated low team scores in dual
meet competition due to under
staffing, Hunt says that he is
helpful of strong individual
performances, and with luck and
proper regulations, a chance at
a championship showing at the
Midwest Conference Meet early
in March.
