“‘Judgment of Paris," "milan care

:such. Now i can’t say that it's
bad for a ballet to have a story,
‘because “Swan Lake” has a
‘story and it‘s a good ballet, but
the trouble with these was that
they were house stories.
In “milan Garden." humor
takes the worn—out theme of
the double triangle and adds
absolutely nothing to it. The
wrong lovers get passed off,
they dance around for a while
throwing ﬂusers at each other
while their hearts break, and
then everybody walks off except one or the starrcrossed
young men, who hands his
head down and facts rear as
the certain falls.
ln “Judgment oi Paris," the

I'm sure this is a partly oi some

1Dr Amstutz presents an optimistic

By Nick Murray
In a lecture delivered last
1Friday entitled “darkness, Evil

or the University of Bern, swiss
zealand, spoke of sin-called “toxic
llitel‘store” and controlled the

infections of three of its best
,kiiown authors: Jean-Paul car—
‘try, Albert games, and brand
.Kaﬂta.
Amstutz stated that by “since
items” he meant a darkness oi the
1“ ill, in which men either locked
1any development of will or had
changelog it into the service or
universe ends- and that by “evil”
he meant the "external campus—

HE WENT 0N to deﬁne three
businesses produced in society
-by the misunderstanding of this
11structure: ( ) “snobbisln,” an
‘attitude taken by those who accept the apparently pessimistic
:message of “toxic literature” and
travel in it as sustainable, all’dev
ing that. there is nothing to be
done, and taking sophisticated
pride in their knowledge;
(2) “selection.” a feeling or
hopelessness endangered in the

1of these books at take value; and
(3) a “theoretical salary” comic

‘of some churchmen to take ad-
vintage of the effects produced
by this literature by reattirming
the powerlessness of men as detected in it, and arising the
more strongly for the suspended

will of God as expressed in
church drama.
Amstutz then said that. the infections of Saltre, games and
