JLA: Its History And Future
By DICK SHADY
The Junior Liberal Arts exam
will not be given at the beginning
of next semester.
Last spring the faculty resolved
to place a one-year monitoring
on the exam and asked that “the
ﬁnfl disposition of the examination be considered at some time
in the future in conjunction with
a broad, comprehensive evaluation of the entire curriculum."
The JLA was first proposed by
a special faculty curriculum com»
little in February or 1959. The
committee allocated that an exuminauon be given to seniors,
with the objectives ot increasing
students' responsibility for their
own education and stimulating achievement in the liberal arts.
A special committee to design
such an exam was Elected, and
on Nov. 25, 1959, ii proposed a
twopart exam, consisting of the
Area Tests or the Graduate Rec-
 
odds Examination and an essay
section.
The test itself would examine
the ability of the student to “state
and discuss the similarities, abilities, and differences among time
major disciplines."
The original approach (using
specific texts) was abandoned in
favor of a “concepts" test. Nearly
one year later, on Oct. 19. 1960,
the Junior Exam committee pro
based that each department submit to the Dean a list of “basic
Concepts and dominant issues" in
each discipline.
In January of 1961, the faculty
approved the proposal which pro<
video for Area Tests and a "concepts" test on be given on the
class of ’63 in January, 1962.
The ﬁrss test would be experimental and limited, with the Area
Tests counting twice as much as
the essays in trading. Four grades
which pass, pass, low pass, and
no credit—were m be assigned,
with tour credits awarded [or a
high pass and two credits for pass
or low pass
The experimental and reserve
time nature of the ﬁrss test was
emphasized, along with the fact
that "evaluations will be used in
making documents regarding the
student’s conference for graduate
study, employment, etc." Students
were required to take, but not to
pass, the nest, and there was no
direct on the grade-point.
The committee selected three

including the past year, and choosing a switching last
line.
I guess the fastest way is first to thank everyone
who has appeared on the masthead since January 8 this
ear. These people have, for varying lenders of time,
men able to overcome the feeling that a Grinnell std—
sent must do nothing but study.
There are other people who deserve thanks, but
I’ll send them Christmas cards.
So we can get to the second part of the traditional
firewall editorial—in this case an analysis of 1965. And
for that, I think I will simply refer you to “Grinnell
joel XII.”
Essentially, that leaves me with very little to say
except to note that the year has been, well, interesting.
Good luck on finals, and season’s greetings.

To the Edimr:
i understand that five students

When I was out there last winter
for a visit, students were being
suspended and put on conduct and
academic promotion [or drinking,
being in the women's hills after
hours, having women in their
room, etc. There’s a lot oi rulebreaking at Grinnell and a lot or
heavy punishment. The administration was still saying, "This is
another example or Grinnellians’
liability to take responsibility to.their own lives. When the students
demonstrate that they can handle
adult freedom in an adult and responsible manner, it will be grant.
cd them.“ This is the same cunt
students were hearing when i inst
came to Grinncll n. 1960. Nothing
has changed, From what 1 under
stand, in fact, there is loss brandon.
at oriental than ever before. Rules
are strictly in all areas, more strict
ly informed; the administration i
less sympathetic to the studio
the old~campus houses have been
closed; a glass building has been
built, providing for a very modern,
public place for students to go.
Most students area’t permitted
cars, there’s hardly any place for
them to go downtown, they are cut
off train the outside world. and any
other amended to privacy are being
reduced. The rooms. the class.
roolns,, the considers, and campus
are all public domain.
Where does a student live his
own life, find his own valuES free
iron. control, apply what he has
learned iron. his liberal education
to a vcallife situation, experiment,
expand himself? 1 think that what
is happening at Grinnell is very
managing to the students. Under
the circumstances. it almost looks
as it l'ulcebreaking is virtuous, it
certainly demonstrates student’s
awareness that they have more
rights the. the administration
seems to feel they do. To break
 
a rule is not always n bad thing.
It depends on the rule, dress't i\’!
 
Five years ago some students
were answering this view with:
“Then why not change the rules
through proper channels? Acting
in a criminal way is no good either." This was being said live years
ago and I imagine it’s still being
said. The bald truth however, is
that students at critical College
have never been permitted free.
dom to live their owll lives, to experiment. or allowed to lake responsible v (or their actions. The
adminlsll [ion has not after in the
host interests Di the students, but
in their own interests, which ut
many points conflict with the students' interests. I'm not surprised
lhal students break rules, that the
Boar's Head Dinner is always a
near-root, that the spring root iii
always an explosion which never
quite collins off I’m also not surprised that investments and strict
er rules don’t ease [he litigation but
somehow worked it. The student
body at Grinllell is made up ct
apple, and people usually want to
live their own lives. (There is unfortunately a large percentage of
students at Grinnell who actually
don't want lo be allowed freedom
and privacy and this obscures the
fact that everyone has the right to
these things alld that a person's
growth depends on theft)
When it comes down to it. rule»
breaking is a dead end, also. it
certainly dress’t develop good
living habits. Students are stuck.
Maybe that's why i keep running
into ex-Grinnell students here in
New York City, people who have
transferred to other schools to escape m. impossible living situation.
There are many things I love
about Griunell, the processors, the
friends i made lbcre, the land,
Now that rm an alumni though,

concepts for the first exam: 1)
the nature of man, 2) evaluation,
and 3) evidence. This test was
given twice, to 248 seniors in 1962
and 278 in 1963.
The faculty approved the new
theme on May 10, 1963, and re
later the concept or “order" m
printable, Newton, and Darwin.
With this test, four credits were
assigned for any passing grade,
The test centered on the Concept
of order was given in 1964 and
again in February 1961
4 Each year different groups had
tried to corporate meaningful
tests, with varying degrees of sun»
less,
Dean James Stauss questioned
the availability of the exam in a
report to the faculty on September
15, 1964. He said: “I find it difficult to answer yes to three questions, where the afﬁreceive is
tied into the theory ol the examination:
“Does the amount or reading
which the students actually do justify the credits earned and facility
time and effort put into the exam?
“Do the essay questions in the
exam provide the students individually the opportunity to express
the particular reading each has
done?
“Are the concepts which have
interdisciplinary dimensions actually emphasized in the required
courses?'-’
Five months later, in February
1965, the faculty made its recommendation that a one-year moratoriurn lie imposed, and that in
the future the JLA be considered
in conjunction with .a completed
save evaluation of the curriculum.
canyon K n o p i (economics),
chairman of the faculty, thinks
that the purpose at the monitoring is to “reading the framework
rather than the examination.”
It a new test is designed, “perhaps more structure will have to
be built in," although the test Was

originally proposed to test the liberal arts, not course work. How
can the test he made part oi the
curriculum and keep its “liberal
arts" flavor?
Stauss questioned whether the
“interdisciplinary concepts" were
actually made part of the course
work now. This same failure was
noted by rivers Thornton (psychology), who made the turmai
proposal at line test in 1960.
“A substantial portion of the
faculty didn't accept the idea of
a liberal arts exam in principle"
and consequently failed to give it
attention in course work and wait—
ing letters of recommendation
Thornton said, “I have no doubt
that the outcomes at a liberal education can be measured," but that
currently the use of the exam
is an expensive proposition.
It is expensive in the sense at
time required or students, administration and particularly the faculty in the preparation and trading of the test.
On December 14, 1960, shorts
ton’s proposal to the faculty referred to the test in this way:
“It will have multiﬁed its existence if it promotes intellectual
excitement leading to discussion,
argument, and critical analysis oi
the issues basic to a liberal education" and “cause students to
ask questions concerning the puts
pose of a liberal arts college in
our society and their role in such
a community."
on those grounds, did it justify
itself?

No Reboumﬁ’ g Weak Offensive
leuo' Fa Two Basketball losses
By STEVE CASEY
The Pioneer basketball team,
showing a surprising inetticiency
in their offense and a root-sosurprising lack of responding, succumbed twice last weekend to
fair teams from Knox and plymouth. Knox shipped the Pioneers Friday, 62-55, and Monmouoh adjusted them Saturday,
3369,
The Pioneers were outrebound—
Ed over the weekend 105-79 and
had a considerable number of
customers in their disappointing
opening The Pioneers were also
able to make only forty baskets
compared to seventh for their 01)position. Only deadly tree—throw
shooting (44 for 54, 81 per cent)
kept the Pioneers in the games.
This weekend the Pioneers will
be trying to even their record as
they come back to party to face
Lawrence tonight and simon tomorrow. Lawrence also dropped
two last weekend, but simon
picked up two victorian to tie for
the conference lead. Lawrence lost
to Carleton, 8881, and St, Olaf,
8579, while simon was heating
Carleton, 52-83, and St. Olaf, 8579.
With high hopes the Pioneers
went against Knox, which was
supposed to be one of the taylor
spots on the schedule. But the Siwash quickly posted the Pioneers
by scripting out to an early 2210
lead. Alter that the Pioneers were
never able to get closer than seven points to Knox. The Pioneers
crest to 22.15, but Knox pulled
away to a 3418 lead The hall
ended at 3815.
The Siwash combined a handling
defense and an oiliense that
worked hard to get good shots to
 
keep the Pioneers at bay all night.
The second ham or the game was
similar to title first as Knox kept
control or the boards and tower
the Pioneers into many bad pass
es. The computers put forth n mild
challenge by drawing within seven
points with eight minutes remain
ing but were never able to get
closer than that
Even after the Knox game, the
Pioneers had high hopes oi get»
king a split for the weekend. It
looked like they would as they
bumper out to a quick 16-9 lead
against an unorganized plymouth
team. But the scott called a time
out and regulated their forces.
plymouth then processed to reel
oil 14 straight points, many or
them gifts because Di poor Pioneer
passes, to lake a me lead. The
Pioneers were only able to pick
up a pair at free throws as the
scott continued on to build a 31-18
lead. The half ended at 43-32.
The Pioneers, though, came out
surprise the scott like they did
at the start of the game. They
looked for a while like they would
succeed In the first three minutes the computers needed out nine
points to draw within two point:
43-41. The Pioneers were able in
stay close, within tour points, for
the next ten minutes The deficit
was our to one point twice, but
the Pioneers never able to get the
church basket to take the lead
while the scott were engineering.
Finally with eight minutes remaining, plymouth broke the
game open building up a nine«
point lead. The winners never
threatened after that.
The leading scores over the
weekend was Jett grants. who
nested 21 points against Knox and
13 against plymouth, Elliott
Hibbs was next with 10 against
Knox and 13 against Momnouth.
Tom Hill noticed 17. against plymouth to become the only other
Pioneer to score in double ﬁsure
