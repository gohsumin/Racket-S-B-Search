Red China As logical Step In
Modern French Foreign Policy
‘ By JOHN WOLF
France's recognition of Red
China was explained as a logical step in French foreign policy by Stanley Hoffmann in his
5 e c o n d Rosenfield lecture,
”France, the United States, and
Nato," given yesterday in service Chapel.
France, claimed Hoffmann,
realized the difficulty of fighting in southeast Asia; there«
more France would rather associate with keeping, no matter
how long and difficult negotiations might be.
Further, France would feel
more secure it more than two
super-powers existed in the
world, a united Europe would
offset the power of the U.S.,
and a strong Red China would
stability the Communist site-
union.
The establishment of an axis
between would-be nuclear nations is another French consideration in establishing relations
with the keeping government.
The first part of Hoffmann's
lecture was a view of the impact of the U.S. on French so
dirty and on French interventions Since World War II.
Hoffmann first explained that
between 1945 and 1958, ”Although French foreign policy
generally followed the pattern
set by the U.S., the American
impact was badly received.
Since 1958, however, the situation has been reserved, and now
France has accepted the American impact but has followed
its own foreign policy.

students, the institute began in
1962 with a $20,750 NSF grant
and continued last year with a
524,890 award from the same
source. It is the only such program in the country to be supported by the NSF.
Its purposes are to identify
secondary school students who
have potential for becoming
scientists. to accelerate their
similarly development through
instruction by scientists of rec
ignored statute. and to develop
cooperation between colleges
and high schools in increasing
the quality of education in the
sciences.
Enrollment will be open to
approximately 45 students of
exceptional ability and promise
who have completed their junior. but not their senior, year
in high school and who have
good backgrounds in science
and mathematics.
Instruction Will be offered by
Griiinell faculty members and
v i s i t i n g scientists in five
courses: Introduction to the
Philosophy of silence, Experimental Analysis of Behavior,
introduction to Psychological
Research, Psychological Statistics, a nd General Experimental Psychology.
Lectures Will be supplemental
by intensive laboratory work
and programmes learning material. During the last two
weeks of the session Students
will have an opportunity to ex7
acute an independent study of
their own design.
 
Hoffmann outlined several
changes which have driven
because of the American impact. A youth culture has appeared, the bourgeois culture'
has given way to a mass culture due to mass community-.
tions, and education has become quantitative rather than
publication.

“Whereas most French people
might not be concerned with

France’s main concern under de Gaulle has been foreign
affairs. De Gaulle sees France
as potentially oscillating between decline and grandeur.
Therefore, France must have

In Our Opinion . . .
l With the illustration of any new administration
some statement of policy is always in order. In the
case of the campus newspaper it seems especially appropriate because of the president connection that the
charles and Black has no policy or that its policy as
such inn’t worth much.
Shortly after the election of a new editor it became apparent that some students shared the editorial
lucy would be pro-administration ~— a policy which
hey stated, would village the concept of a “student
press.” Their reasoning detailed that a student se—
enter by students put out a newspaper representing
the students .
, Although such a policy seems logical on the sur—
face, the flat, on this campus, exists in the idea that
such a ”student” paper must be currently opposed to
anything the administration does or says, because this
represents the “student” stand.
While supposed supporters of the “student” stand
make their position known by individual houses in their
respective offices on campus, the majority of students,
who are simply interested in having a good, informative, and entertaining newspaper, stand by and shake
their heads.
Ever since it was announced that a new editor
wouldassume the top position on the S and B masthead
for 1964, one of the holly discussed issues on campus
concerned whether the paper would be pro»administration or pro—students, or in other words, would the Week1y bag be a scanner sheet or a house organ?
Does it seem impossible, in light of this debate, to
introduce a policy thereby the S&B would be a newspaper with news in the reported columns, side~choosing
In the opinion columns, and a general, overall practice
of representing each group and individual related to the
college? This, we feel, is the news function of a good
college newspaper, This will be the foundation of editorial policy for the 5&8 during 1964.
We will attempt to do an objective job of covering
“all" the news. The individual columns and the “letters
to the editor" department will be the campus forum
for opinion, discussion and debate. The editorial column will present the editorial voice and opinions of
the S&B on those issues we feel have particular signs-
ﬁdance for the Grinnell College community.

Hoffmann Views ﬁftp Republic:—
Its Political System Am! Society
By Susan Taylor
There are two sides to the
post-war problems of France,
according to Professor Stanley
Hoffmann, Rosenfield lectures,
These are the continuing
troubled history of French politics, caused by the presence of
so many political parties, and
th e transformation of the
French society in the period for»
losing 1945.
Speaking on ”France Under
the Fifth Republic,” Hoffmann,
professor of government at
Harvard University, Wednesday
night analyzed the problem and
discussed the background. the
quest for political stability under De Gaulle, and the pros»
posts for the future.
“In suite of the hopes of registration and registration
which followed world War ii,
the French were not able to
solve the basic problems of the
possibility of the political sys
tel,” he said,
The society was divided on

which were not necessarily related to the equally president
divisions on an theoretical basis and a "division of the tel—

Hoffmann explained that four

He explained that the impact

According to Hoffmann, De

Under the di signs in the
French society, there is a “latest general will,” and only the
executive can awaken this will.

the many divisions it has within

Hoffmam‘l, realized that the divisions on the surface of the society are qualities reflected only
too accurately by the parliament — which leads to “a perfect recipe for deadline," ac—
working to Hoffmann.
“De Gaulle has become the
dominant element in the system,” Hoffmann Said. He has
imposed a strong executive over
the parliamentary republic. In
his constitutional reforms of
1962, he further strengthened
his position by having the president elected by universal sub

One of the client (printable) things that numerous critics
have called the charles and Black, affectionately known to many
critics as the “Scab," its “a historical record of the momentous
and noise-momentous events mat take place within the combines
of Grinnell College." To fulfill this noble function and give our
readers a pleasant, nostalgic trip through the recent past we will
account some of those events that helped to make that the semester that was
The semester started with a splash. Approximately 1150 students converted on what, in some circles, was affectionately
known as the "ol’ Swimmin’ hole" to find that the ancient “N0
Swimming" sign had been removed and the forwarding "3.2
Lake” legally opened to quiltﬁed swingers. The reporting and
jewelry caused by the removal of that moschovered sign will
_doubtless echo in the respective logging for years.
It was a semester of rule change and important d unions on
campus life, The students were suspicious of the admi isolation,
the administration was suspicious of the faculty, the faculty was
suspicious of everybody and President women left the country.
The Grinnell Nonconformist club forced, or rather posted,
ahead in characteristic progressive style by replacing, through
pretty teeth and moss covered lips, the new Non-club month, “Two
wheels good, four wheels bad.” The eminem adopted by the group
was entitled, “Ainu outside 3. Chrome kyle.”
The charles and Black changed printers, got a much needed
facevlift, came out in florists red, white and black, held forth the
promise that it would be the finest newspaper ever produced on
the Grinnell College campus; and failed to appear the following
week.
A conservative group of encountered Grinnell workers and
alchemists predicted a deluxe of gold water in 1964 followed by
four years of joyous prosperity.
Campus skeptics stuffed at both predictions saying that, if the
first came to pass, the second would necessarily fail. “Anybody
knows that gold water would never make anything grow.”
It was a semester of close community with nature. Half the
student body spent a weekend talking about “those students” in
a sylvan setting, the men of Clark and Cowles sold down the
river, President Truman bit the dust, and Dean Wood decided to
head for the hills.
President Harry Truman visited the campus as the year’s
official "Politician-in-Residence." Before his visit was over he
, had stopped (in a bush) and the P,P.P.E. was almost committed
to carry Harry,
Construction on the Forum moved ahead at a pace that made
the students currently attending Grinnell wonder “‘for whom?”
The male students and representatives from the faculty and
administration attended a traditional holiday dinner. However,
the three groups coupon’t agree on What tradition was traditional
and when the listing controversy came to a head it was de-
cited that the whole thing was too booking to argue about and
trusted its evolution,
”Barbie,” Grinnell’s thick-skilled, $75,000 white elephant,
was placed in her cage early in December, But, as if she was no
better than any common, ordinary, “cheap” slab of concrete, she
refused to perform until the temperature got below the greeting
point. ~
The semester officially ended with those Grinnellians, commonly called “off men," that coupon’t find their way home looking forward to a rose field of new centuries to add to the three
per student total that had already visited the Grinnell campus
during the semester that was. .
