Activity Fund treatment Cut 8%:
party Claims SOiZidi Plans Suffer
Second semester budget allormerits from the activity fee
fund were made this week —
with an eight per cent acrosstherboard cut.
The college activity fee,
which this year is $20 per std
sent per semester, is targeted
by SGA to social funds. student
government, and publications.
Though the budget is planned
for the entire year, the allow.
meets are made by semester,
since the student fees are payable by semester.
The eight per cent cut “was
investigated by a larger drop
in enrollment than was antici:
rated plus a series of under
posted expenditures and student administrational errors,”
according to Milton google.
student auditor.
.. When asked about the cut,
Phil Johnson. SGA president,
said that it had been caused by
a drop in enrollment larger
than had been planned for,
google explained that the second semester activity fee check
for $21,340 was $760 less than
had been estimated when the
marketing was done, because
. of the enrollment drop. The
budget also expected to use $1,160.71 from the General Budget and Reserve fund, but ex»
lenses from first semester had
brought the balance of the
GBBzR down to where this was
not possible. Thus, the cut was
called fort
The regular budget is worked
out each spring by the Executive Cabinet, in consultation
with the recipients of the activity fee apartments, and it is
then approved by the Student
Senate, ‘
Last spring, when the budget
was worked out, it was done
 
assuming an 33 per student increase in the activity fee, This
increase was not approved by
the Trustees, when they, met
over the summer. Thus, when
the SGA officials returned to
campus this fall, they had to
re-work the entire budget.
It was at this time that the
funds from GB&R Were targeted to the fund which the ac»
tivity see usually covers alone.
largest hit ill this Cut have
been the social funds. Palmer
Hart], social Coordinator, said
that the cut would definitely affect the social program for the
rest of the year, but that it is
impossible at this time to determine just which areas will
be affected most.
party added, however, that
“the magnitude of Spring Day

Ike's Visit Set
For May 13-14
Former President weight
Eisenhower Will definitely visit
Grinnell May 1314. This event
will give the college the unusual distinction of being the
only college east or west of the
Mississippi to have been visited by all the living exAPresidents of the United States in
two successful years. The
highlight of last year’s PPPE
program was a visit by President Harry Truman.
Confirmation of the Eisenhower visit was received last
week from his side. However,
travel plans are still undertake.
If the President arrives by
plane he will be accompanied
by his value and his side. Mrs.
Eisenhower will according
the President if he travels by
rail.
During his visit, Eisenhower will participate in both
the politician-in-residence and
political lectureship programs
of the PPPE. He will attend
a press conference, deliver an
address in party, be initiated
into one of the men’s calls, and
attend meals and coffee hours
with students. The evening lecture is effectively ”Politics is
Too Important to ba Left to
the Politicians."
In accounting the schedule,
admin Gilmour (political science) arrested both the
achievement of the PPPE in
obtaining both eXePresident's
in two years, and the benefits
to the college.
After the May Visit, the only
question will be: Where do we
go from here? All the way with
LBJ?

Miss german Questions Grinnell's ‘liberal' Position
To the Editor:
It has become more and
more apparent to me in the
past few months the distance
and lack of sensitivity that the
students of this “liberal" institution have toward the real
goal of the metro in American
society and in particular the
problem on this campus,
There is an assumption here
that we are all concerned and
sensitive to the sufferings of a
large body of our population,
and so the attempt is made at
Grinnell by “optimization" and
“inclusion” to show that we
care about them as persons.
The problem to which I'm see
hearing is manchester in a very
subtle attitude by the way in
which students try to achieve
this end of “optimization" and
“inclusion"
Last week Doug McCormac
expressed this feeling overall,
but for the most part. I think
this attitude is an unconscious
one. The fact is that we all
have become so aware of the
general problem >— it is some
thing which hits us in the face
everyday - that it is very
very hard to get away from the
materials. By this I mean that
it becomes extremely difficult
to forget that one is relating
to a metro and accept him
solely as the person that he is.
When this happens, people become overly conscious of their
positions and tend to exaggerate their "liberalism" in a
subtle benevolence which becomes paternalistic and corresponding. This kind of usr

On this campus, this attitude

where a metro felt alleged to

the National Council of Churches, which is largely a while organization.
Likewise you should remember that the CiVil Rights bill of
1964 was passed in both Houses
oi Congress by an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority, and
the tremendous pressure elected on our legislature to pass
that bill was elected not by Africans, but by Americans, Finally, remember that in the recent presidential election, the
candidate who subtle appeared
to the white backlash was successful only in the Deep South.
All I ask is that While you coridemn evil in our society, as indeed you should continue to do,
you also remember that there
are Americans who are on your

Donulloe, Four Exchange Students Tell
Coffee Hour of leMoyne Experiences
By Pam Clay
red Donahoe (speech and
theater) began the coffee hour
about LeMoyne last Tuesday
afternoon in his customers direct fashion, The mood was set
when he burst out asking
where we Were during Christmas vacation while students
from Oberlin and other colleges went south to help require churches. “There are
more things to be done than
matching,” he said. “As edur
rated people you have something to offer. Education is important, and if you want to do
something to help, that is what
you can do."
When asked why he went to
LeMoyne, Donahoe reported,
"Why does someone go to LeMoyne? That’s none of your
business!” He responded to
another question with, "I
learned things at first hand. i
learned a lot of things to hate
— povertyI grubbiness.“
The four students from LeMoyne Lois McGowan,
timothy Harris, Louis Harvey,
and Frank batteries—were al»
so present to answer questions
and comment on both LeMoyne
and Grinnell. Answers to an
inquiry as to why they came
to Grinnell ranked from authority, a Wanderlust, and a desire for a superior education,
to Frank’s statement that he
was here because “the boy
who was supposed to come
coupon’tl"
timothy made a sailing
complaint about the Saturday
classes here and then elaborated on the LeMoyne class schedule. They have several twohour classes, and these are
held throughout the day —- for
instance one German class
ends at 7:30 p.m. One big difference at Grinnell.that Lois
noted was that “Here kids
neck all over . . . on the stairway, in the younger. . . l" The
girls both watched but said that
at LeMoyne no one is ever
seen kissing.
All of the students from LeMoyne commented that they
had many friends (some had
most of their friends) outside
the college. Since LeMoyne has
no forms, the unity of the college and the amount of activity
(e.g. student government)
which takes place within it Is
limited.
Donahue spoke of LeMoyne
students in general as the
"chosen few" and said that
many of them “did not know
where they were going but
knew they had to learn" They
realized that they will have to
be leaders and they are serious about learning LeMoyne

he explained. They have to
catch up (from a generally interior high school background), and then they have to
go ahead from there.
Finally the discussion turned
to me Grinnellian at LeMoyne
and what his purpose must be.
"Do not go down there to be
a toronto and change Memphis!" was the Clear word of
warning. Donahoe said that the
primary mobile must be education; "Then you will find
concern and find something to
do.” There is preceding in
Memphis, not always obvious
but always there. The public
library, where ”we know we
are allowed but we know we
are not wanted," was cited as
an example of the need for a
mood of relaxation to combat
unfriendly starter
“I wish we exchanges not
only students, but also teachers," Donahoe said as he ended the discussion.
A llrrtlnna report on the delta situation, received by the son
last night by telephone from four
Grinnell students, is tested in the
Forum lobby.
Literacy Can't Go,
Father ’ing States
“We can’t let the age of literacy go after all,” concluded
Father Walter ing, noted cellular and teacher from St. Louis
University during the annual
golden L e c t u r e Wednesday
night.
Speaking on the possibility of
an end to the age of literacy
brought on by the new electronic age, Father ing said,
“Printing and writing are no
longer unlikely central but
part of a larger complex that
gives communication new or—
navigation liberty unknown.
“The human being can’t have
thinking without language because thinking implies the existence of other people," explained Father ing in an extended discussion of communication.
“Our electronic age has
brought on a new world of
sound,” he said. “In scanning
the space age, sight will not
surface." In thus something that
the javascript age has given
way to the sound age, Father
ing emphasized that one media
can succeed another without
cancelled it, saying ”When we
started writing, we didn't stop
 
speaking.‘ ’

Pesticides Provide
By Anne career
Although the speech by Dr,
0. sale Fletchall, University of
Missouri agronomist, to Grinnell science bugs on March 4
may not have been considered
a topic of universal import by
most liberal arts tools, the
topic—pesticides—actually was
permanent to the Grinnell situation.
For Instance, no one active
and responsible in student government would advocate indicating the entire higher hierarchy of Grinnell; nonetheless
there are a few points that SGA
officials might find handy for
future reference.
For example,’ mobility is a
matter of dosage, and all chemicals are toxic if taken in large
enough amounts. This could be
Possible Answer
a real saving in any future
SGA administration configuration, for by thread analysis of
the general character of an official, the minimum dosage
could be determined readily.
H o w e ve r, Dr. Fletchall did
point out that “there is no such
things as absolute safety" in
the use of pesticides, of which
fact SGA-era should he cognitive.
One other point mentioned
by Dr. Fletchall is already quite
familiar to most Grinnellians.
In discussing the difference be

and the use of pesticides, Dr.
Fleichall made one last relevant statement:
"It just all depends whose

Republican Supports Two Party System
In Telephone Talk to Grinnell Students

The stage was set, the performer ready. It was 9 pm.

Then a lone human voice
integrated through space and
imagination. Senator Jacob
habits and the Young Republicans had introduced a new con—
kept in communication to Grinnell and Iowa —- the polyphonic
lecture.
The Republican Senator from
New York told the Grinnell
audience, “Preservation of the
twosparty system requires that
people have a real alternative."
He continued that the 1964
brand of conservation is not
an acceptable choice. Warning
that it is not enough to be different for the sake of being diff

problems which Republicans
must tackle. Cautionihg minerals against taking satisfaction
in saying. ”I told you so." he
nevertheless agreed that the
1964 election was a tragedy for
the Republicans.
He pointed out that Republicans held their own at the gubr

problems there were essentially local. In habits’ opinion. the
big question which contracts
the party is. “Can we compete

ways to compete with Demo—

Seniors Start in last Home Game;
computers Will End Year on Road
By Bob sat:
After watching our basketball team Complete its home
season by heating plymouth,
then losing to Knox and Core
well, one can’t help wondering
what next year will bring.
We’ve played heads-up, handling
ball this year. The fans have
been treated to many an exciting game, regardless of the
eventual outcome. Our only
problems have been lack of experience and not putting the
ball through the basket enough
times. The two go handinhand. With the new confidence
and unity that this season will
hopefully install in the team for
next year, I can see only forty
minutes a game of good, solid
basketball for next year.
It was only fitting that we
beat plymouth. From Ted sister'p lay-up at the opening
jump. to slide Smith's tap»in
with seventh seconds left to
play, the team showed more
than once that it was ready to
play serious basketball. But the
old genesis, failure to score,
took its toll in the closing minutes Of the first half, as plymouth speaker a 46-42 advantage into the locked room, after
we had led for the first 19 minutes. Three minutes and twenty
seconds into the second half,
the score was tied. For the
next nine minutes we were in
control, until the scott hit nine
points to our two to turn a 7166 deficit into I 75-73 lead, Then
Elliott Hibbs posted three
jump shots to take the game
into a 79-79 deadline with two
minutes to go; then slide
Smith took matters into his
hands with the gamewinning
tap and a key steal that allowed us to take a three point
lead with thirty seconds to play.
Fate was with us as we held
on for an 83-81 victory. All five
quarters hit double figures,
Hibbs leading the way with 22,
Jeff grant’t with 20, and Tom
Hill with 13.
Hill started the Knox game
all over the floor, hitting two
baskets, working a jump ball
three times, and making a fine

steal within the first four minutes. The team caught fire,
building up several eight-point
leads. but lost its edge at the
conclusion of the half, leaving
with a start 43-41 margin.
Knox took nine seconds to tie
up the score as the second half
started, and went ahead to stay
latter six minutes. We moved to
within three points with five
minutes
had its profiles scoring under
the basket, but the swingers
finished with a ill-l outburst,
and took home an 81-66 decision. The bright note of the
game was Jeff grants's setting
of a new school season scor<
ing record, as he connected for
18 markers. Hibbs, Smith and
sister also hit double figures.
Tuesday night was the final
home game of the season, and
Coach John deutsch started his
four seniors, along with grants,
in communication. Of the four,
Dave Seliergren, slide Smith,
Randy Morgan, and Dick Ulrich, Smith was the only regular, but the others played like
quarters as they fought to n 3133 haifvtime deficit against a

Morgan leading the way with

Sellergren hit long jump shots
and showed good muscle in get—
king 15 points; and Ulrich
played a fine floor game while
flashing his 13. Smith played
the pilot like a pro, while hitting for 10. The second half
started Well, as we had a 39-38
lead with 17:15 to play, but alloonference Jack Grams took
the cams to a ten-point advantage with twelve minutes to
