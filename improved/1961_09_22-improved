Admssiolis and Confusion ‘
Inquiries concerning the Grinncll admissions policy:
particularly in connection with the class of 1965 have shell
directed to both this office and that of the Student modern:
ment Association. Essentially students and facility are asks;
log two major questions. Why is there a totally decrease
in. the pcicentag'e of fleshman students from the East!
(there are 11 percent as compared with the 20 percent
of last year‘s class) and why, if our admissions policy
is concerned with collecting' in its population choices a
geographical sampling of students are only 11 per cent from
the Atlantic States this year, and about 2'5 per cent from
the Iowa region 01' about 50 per cent from the IowaIllinois region? , l
These inquiries are not to be blessed off easily since
it would seem to be a valid concern of the student bodyi
and faculty to ascertain how fellowvclassmates and studentsi
are to be chosen from the many applicants, sillce these
classified do much to determine the tone not only of class-l
room activity, but formal and informal activity which takes:

Is Panel Subject
“Berlin and enlargement"
was the topic discussed at is
.coffee hour sponsored by the
Grinnell Students for Peace yesterday iii counter lounge.
The panel included Joseph
,Wall (history), Alan Jones (history), kirk Baay (modern for.
sign languages), and Mike done
cross and John Ward, students
Bill Johnson, president of the
Student Peace group, moderate
ed. After the panel had stated
their views, discussion was
thrown open to the audience.
Most oi the discussion can—
tired around Wall’s statement »
that the United States has
little c once but. to pull out
oi Berlin or to undertake ha- ‘
sic negotiations with the So—
vice Union. Mike controls in- ,
produced the idea oi passive
resistance. which‘ also still- .
watch much discussion. .
Whereas John Ward felt thats
enlargement is the only wall
to save the human race front,
installation, Jones continued}
that it is impossible to disable
now because there is no chance‘
of negotiation. ‘,
A major step in disarmamenti
according to Wall, would be;

ENQUIRER
by Ken .Suhiif
Men on campus were asked. \
In your opinion, what it
any, are the changes brought ;
about by the assumption of nuclear testing, and what are the
‘possible and results or such a
program?
Capt, Dean K. Mandcville: in
view oi recent world events, it
would appear that our assumption of nuclear testing is a necessary step to ensure ourselves or
a military instrument capable or nation and to consult with Thaiicern over
onieiais as to the means where ‘-
supported our national
times '7
Mike nor-watt. ‘63: The most
fundamental sue involved in
the assumption or nuclear testing is what
object
vc: or it he is able
to survey, \all he be able to
withstand the televisions efi'acts
of strontium so.
it is a sad thing when two
nations, both programming humanities goals, set themselves
to the task of finding the best
way to.,destroy humanity. It
salt betrayed her total la
fingering through her resume- 4‘
tion of testing.
The United States biol. only
‘would have a basis of support
to protecting nations, but also
would certain a valuable stategic
and propaganda advantage by
continuing its monitoring on nuclear testing,
Ray norton. '52: It merely
brings home the direction in
which we are travelling. and its,
value, it any. lies in the fact that;
it may wake certain people, not
only in the government but
throughout the country, to the
pos bility of a nuclear war.
Dean Wood: The Russian de
vision to resume testing is a bra»
tax decision, however one looks
at it. The original unilateral den,
,vision to stop testing was used!
to serve specific purposes oi the
Russian state. it is possible that
this decision was entirely Krus
click’s, consciou y
bring about a s atomic advance
age. .
If, however, Khruschev was ‘
forced into this decision by ,
more military sections of the ,
Russian regime the implied—
tions are born 3mg. It means
that Russia is in a state of dan- t
versus possibility and even
Khruschev has little control
over itussiau nuclear solid
i feel that the United ata es
decision to resume testing even
on a limited basis was not to our
‘ advantage. We could have beIlCi'
purchased our position by lianele‘
aug the issue as a negotiation
factor in our favor and as a
means of winning greater ptlbel
llc approval. ,
Charles cleaner: The first nlJ~l
visits change is a totally iu-l
release in leaf and a new kind
‘ol uneasiness in foreign diego-
many. This uneasiness could lead
to one of two possible end r
suits, total war or a more red—
console consideration ot the a
race. An obvious third po. '
its is that we will learn to src‘,
with this tension. '
