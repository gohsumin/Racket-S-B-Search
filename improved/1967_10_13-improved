CARLETON UPS OPENS
from THE CARLETONIAN
Saturday night open houses
have been extended to 1 a.m.
as a result of “good arguments"
by the Open House Committee.
with this modification, the
new agreement~ which will go
into direct tomorrow fighters
identical to last years The
East Side will have open houses
between 7:30 p.m. and man pm
Friday and on Wednesday and
Sunday afterwards.
West Side open houses will be
Saturday between 7:30 and 1:00
am. and Tuesday and Friday
afterwards. All afternoon open
houses extend from 1 through 5.
Widespread Approval
The extended hours on nature
day night have met with wide5 p r e a d approval by Men’s
League, Women’s League, R.A,'s
and Proctors, who have all re»
tel'itly approved the open house
proposal,
Aim Laws, Chairman of the
Open House committee, attributes the extended hours to “the
means’ willingness to listen with
open minds to our arguments,"
In its meeting with the means
last week, the Committee had
continued that an extension of
the hours would make Saturday
open ho u s e s more flexible,
Couples would no longer have
to choose between open houses
and other activities —- they
could go to both. Also, the com
little pointed out, roommates
could schedule their visits to
open houses so they worlds‘t
councils. “Any inconvenience
which might result because of
later hours can easily be work<
ed out among roommates,"
stated Miss Laws.
Arguments ‘continuing’
Dean Jean Phillips agreed that
the arguments were “quite con<
finding. They made very good
arguments; with the later women's hours it makes good sense
to have longer open houses."
Joel tickets, assistant Dean
of Men, feels the extended
hours indicate the College is
“willing to deal with people as
human beings." and is very
happy with the new agreement.
He pointed out, though, that
printers have been instructor
to efforts the ”No drinking by
mixed couples during open
house" rule.
Commented D e a n Phillips,
“While 21—year»old couples who
drink together outside of open
house might naturally want to
do the same during open
houses, we can't Consider that
possibility for some time. The
FA Committee was quite ex<
plicit in forwarding mixed
drinking in open houses.
“It worlds't be wise to private for future change on this
matter until the values of the
present social policy Change!
are confirmed."
Twenty-one year odds not in
mixed company will be able
to drink in the forms during
open houses.
iii RADIO NEXT MONTH I
By PAUL NACHMAN
Grinnell‘s ten~watt FM radio
station will take to the air
"hopefully towards the end of
November," according to station manager Babak Arinajani.
“The radio station will be
amateur,” he said, “but it’ll be
better than what you can get
now. We'll be streaming clause<
cal music, serious jazz, and serious folk since the airlines are
pretty well separated with rock,"
The station explore 133 people—more than one-teeth of the
campus. Many or them are involved in an enormous amount
of behind-the-scenes operations
including engineering, patches<
ing, and program development.
“It’s an educational experience
for all of us," noted Armaiani,
a senior political science major,
“Few of us know much about
radio."
He arrested the educational
and creative outlets the station
will provide. “I expect there
will be something regarding
communications in the Curriculum Committee’s report. Mr.
I-livecam (a member of the
committee) is very excited
about the radio and has helped
us a lot," Annalani explained.
The staff has just finished
scheduling the 120 hour broadcast week. Morning \vakerup
programs, rock shows, newspaper, and delayed broadcasts
will be interspersed with the
more serious musical offerings.
”Delayed broadcasts" include
BBC transcripts of typical dis:
sessions, tapes of on—campus
gatherings such as the recent
Vietnam discussion in Gates. re<
holdings oi programs at Ex
Loco parental, and other gen.
oral features.
“Our news department is the‘
vendors,” Armajani said with'
enthusiasm, ”I think the 5&1],
may concentrate more On few<
turns once we get started since
we can get the break on any
campus story,
“We'll have excellent national
and international coverage—in
great depthaby taking full advantage of what the UPI wire
service provides."
The station has a fairly extent
site library of records and will
be able to draw on several private campus collections. An
RCA Red Seal classical library,
consisting of more than 140 record sets recently arrived unannounced, Armajanl noted—i!
complete gift, he added. other
record companies make regular
contributions.
The disc jackets for the rocks
shows will play their personal
preferences as to type of must!
on their programs. “Rock is de.
fixed in the greatest sense,“
Armaiani explained. ”We wan!
to encourage the deejays to use
their own discretion in defining
what to play. The variety will
be a learning experience for
everyone."
The station will be quarterly
in the northeast corner of party
on the first and second floors.
 
SENATE SEEKS PUBLICITY
The Senate meeting this wednesday was one of the shortest
on record, lasting 21 minutes.
The major issue was an inquiry
by a senator from North wondering the necessity for a regular column of Senate and other
student government activities to
be run weekly in the 5&1}. It
was felt that the student interest in the warnings ot the
government would be heightened by the constant exposure
to a description of these ac
entities, and the general apache
that is present on campus
would be counteracted.
Another prominent issue was
calculated by Neil kitchen’s
column on the College Book
Store. An inquiry was made as
to the reason for the lack of
progress by the committee on
the store organized last year.
David Swee answered that in
the chronic Spring-Fall Senate
changeovers it was observed
and sponsored by the committee on the student used book
store.
The lack of visiting privileges
in the Health Center was discussed. At present, the rules
call for visits only by the North
Campus house treatments and
the South Campus hall health
chairman. An investigation was
commissioner to d e t e r min is
whether limitation rights could
be extended to include all cases
which would not engineer the
health of the visitor or the
patient.
A Cabinet statement confirmed the report that the Wednesday night dress rehearsal of
the mardi require Mass was
to be cancelled, due to the
professional fingers' desire to
preserve their voices.
JUDICIAL COUNCIL
(“The Council will make
public a brief statement ex<
planning the basis for any
disciplinary action taken."
SGA Constitution, 111, B, 8,
g)
The Judicial Council feels
that sterling from SAGA II
a serious offense. The Council believes, however, that
the evidence in the case just
brought before it indicates
that the individual concerned was not guilty of re
current acts of cheats. it
therefore gave him a strong
recommend and warned him
that any further acts of
theft on his part would M

PHILOSOPHERS
NOT PARTISAIIS
By PAUL JONES
Quite obviously. it would be a mistake to call anyone a partlIan at Grinnell; if there is a place in iowa where there is a great
or diversity oi opinion and feelings than Grinnell, nobody has
discovered it But not being a harrison does not reply that one
is necessarily a christopher. I don’t mean a christopher, however,
the usual man-inrthesstreet concept, but rather one who has a philosophizing spirit; one who does not have opinions for the sake of
opinions, or beliefs for the sake of belief, or resolutions for the
sake of resolutions, but rather one who has a willingness to look
at a problem as reasonably as possible, one who has a passion
[or the truth, whatever it may be. professor George eastern, in
a recent letter, put it this way:
It strikes me that a genuine christopher is one who MUST
take all knowledge as his province —- —must become familiar
with the conceptual trademarks and operational terminology
of the sciences, economic, soc-anthropology, the time-arts, law,
history, political science, literature. There is the danger of
smaller dilletantism, but this is a hazard worth listing in
order to acquire it total view of a problem ~ a sense of an
inclusive context — perception of congratulations that explain
large numbers of participate. Philosophy, I think, represents
one or the few strongholds against the excessive documentation and specialization or our age. it remains, in other words,
one of the low meta-disciplines, one capable or remaining
ABOVE social, cultural, economic, and academic, tested in-
forests.
Not every student at Grinnell obviously has this type oi passion
for the truth; but the opportunity thing is that veiyjew have anything close to it, even many students who call themselves ‘philosophy motors’.
A great deal oi the cause, of course, can be found in the educational process which calls for a compliance of historical data
rather than a development of immediate, creative processes of
thinking But at the same time, it seems clear to me that students, particularly at Grinnell, should be concerned with the lock
of direction of most of the educational process here, We are
trained to be good teachers, yes, but to be creative thinking, no.
currently, however, there is not a lack of filtering ideas on
campus; there are rarely two people who think the same way
about anything. So, no, we are not particles to any one, large
principle of society featured on us from an external source. But
neither are we philosophers about the principles which we supposedly seek, or the rules which we supposedly think hair or affair. There are too many who are now willing at this point in time
to say that such and such a rule or way ot tile is good or bad;
but to look effectively at the causes of such beliefs, the consequences ol such beliefs, the components oi such beliefs, is out of
the question for Grinnell’s intelligentsia. As William James put it
in ‘The Moral christopher and the Moral LiTe’: ‘Ollr society encourages us not to be philosophers but particles.’ The shame at
it is that even though Grinnell has new particles in James' sense,
I also hill low philosophers in any sense.

LEST WE FORGET . . .
Grinnell is residential. All but a few students live in the cold
legs's residence calls on the campus. Residence of students in
college is needed to create a sense of community, to emancipate
students from adolescent interests, to tree them from prejudices,
to foster independence, and to provide new experiences, perspeCs
lives, and limitations.
Grlluiell Is located ill a rural setting. Its location apart from
large population centers reduces instructions, promotes hard work,
encourages primary attention to studies. and favors participation
in the life of the campus. playing and execution of social activities depend to a large extent upon student leadership and initiative rather than commercial entertainment. Thus, the use of leisure time itself becomes a worthwhile educational experience.
Grinnell’s style at lite is simple. Social, cultural, and extracurricular activities flooring in number and variety on the Grinnell campus. Yet the style In which they are Conducted is simple
and interventions. Expensive hardcover, cars, and large amounts
of spending money are not necessary {or success in the student
society. In fact, there is no social identification among students.
and every social activity is open to all without charge, Grinnell
has no securities or transmitted, but the advantages of small-group
living are present in its unique residence system.
Grinnell is informal Ind flexible in policies and administration.
As a small college with an exceptionally able student body, the
college is able to experiment in education, to change and to adopt
readily. it explore flexibility in the organization of curriculum
and diversity in the methods oi instruction. All members of the
community, including students, participate in governing the community's affairs, which are conducted in a democratic and nonbureaucratic fashion,

To the Editor:
As I now conclude my sec«

believe that l have come to
some understanding of the pedagogical strategy with which
the small approaches the
course. Between lectures and
classes, dozens oi people have
come before me in an attempt
to get me to think originally
about the readings and to empathize with the characters
thereof.
I have concluded that the
more one is able to understand
and feel the experiences of a
literary character, the greater
will be the reader's appreciation of the Works It is in light
at this conclusion that 1 rec‘

How can a student fully appreciate the disability ot

reader himself has no more
than a textbook knowledge oi

claim to be no more than an

the does of carlo and francisco automatically meaningless to
the uninitiated? And as for

I realize, of course, that the
above statements are not sufficient to warrant such a reads
Iutionary change in the adding
isolation's academic policy. i
do, however. propose that Grinneli conduct a test which will
unquestionably prove the relative series of my theory.
The test involves designing
those teachers who have two
Humanities classes one section
completed of students who
have had sexual experience
and'one section completed or
students who have had no sexual experience. During the
course of the two computers,
simple comparison of the pen
instances of each class should,

thesis.

SCARLET AND BLACK
GRINNELL YEARBOOK CENSORED
(In the interests of decorating, we present a large<
tonian point or view.)
By RON FISCUS
Grinnell College has a new
nudist newspaper, and a new
textbook. Or is it that Grinnell
has the oldest student newspaper and oldest textbook west
or the Mississippi? A simple
Question? You judge.
Last tall, newspaper editor
Krystina german decided to
change the name of the charles
J: Block, which was indeed the
oldest college newspaper west
oi the Mississippi, to the ne—
porter. (Official Grinnell publications also coast that Grinnell
has, among other things the
oldest outdoor middle tennis
courts west oi the Mississippi.
The artificial student version
has it that certain other operated Campus buildings tall in
to that category. Some even
suggest that Grinnell has the
oldest administration west of
the Mississippi (Be that as it
may, it girls are included to
laugh at the College‘s predictions, they might do well to take
note of the latest in Tea Room
tea bags.)
The new name for the newspaper stuck despite vociferous
opposition from traditionalists,
and the Reporter went its way
rating all the much that it saw
bit to print, in the finest tradition of student newspapers.
But Miss german happened to
be a close friend of, and or:national model for, photographer
Henry Wilhelm, who just happened to be one oi the co-editors oi the 196586 textbook,
and here the plot thinking.
Wilhelm, too, had a merchant
for namechanging. having
changed the name oi the textbook from the cycling (oldest
west of the. . . yeah, right) to

of Gl'lnllell College load is something else again, planned by
chronically contained headlines,
it never reached the printer until the spring oi 1967, and even
then it was chicken back to
the College with a request for
a disclaimer of responsibility.
The textbook, it seemed, had
changed more than its name.
It purportedly showed pictures
at a pot party and of student
couples leaving a local motel.
it contained few pictures oi
homecoming, the cheerleaders,
or any of the other more traditional aspects of campus life.
The college was advised that
It Would be listing label suits
it the textbook were printed
in its name. There ensure, as
one might expect, a controversy
with Grinnell landing in the
pages of Newsweek, and even
making the women's section of
the Minneapolis Star.
The College proposed that the
(mostly faculty) Committee on
Student Publications movie W
(edit? sensor?) the Copy in conjunction with the college's legal counsel, Editor Wilhelm refused, retained possession oi
the copy, which was legally his,
and determined to have it published primarily.
Meanwhile. Miss german (re
member her and the Reporter?)
was during over the College's
“liability to deal with centre«
version s t u d e n t publications"
and perhaps even more over
her election from a meeting oi
the Committee on Student Publications, of which she was a
non-voting member. of the constitute members, she was the
only one who had seen the
copy.
In protest, she designed as
editor or the reporter, leaving
Grinnell without a newspaper
or a textbook, but with the
biggest squabble west oi the
Mississippi.
Finally, this tall. new editors
for both the newspaper and the
textbook were found. The news

There is something innately affair about forming athletes of
he genre to play athletes who are schooled in another sport. There
r5 also something innately llnfair about making girls play boys
in a game which is built around speed. Be that as it may, one
can hardly say that the two landscape balance out, besides, any
one with any sense knows better than to bet against the girls‘ field
hockey team. The game of field hockey is played on a large red
cingular field with goals at either end. One worlds't have known
this, though, if the ﬁrss game watched turned out to be the code
test between the girls and the boys' soccer team because the predominance of action was centered around the beleaguered goal of
the woefully sustained (outgirled?) soccer team, The only thing
I can say to the girls is to repeat the traditional cry of the over<
,whether opposition: “Pick on somebody your own size (shape?)."
It has six quarters over 6'3", it has three quarters that which
over 220 pounds. Who is it? Why, it is the Langan football team
that brought glory to its hall by winning a football game this year.
It is also the team that has isolated the terminal rule of l. M.'s by
formatting two of its games. While we must appreciate their concern that they might get hurt (i’), we must explore their lack of
competitive spirit which is the heart of l. M. sports.

THE KIBITZER
By JOHN on
Do you play bridge just to get good hands? If you do the odds
are started against you. Take for example the following hypothetical situation: you are dealer and you deal yourself a hand without
looking at it. What are the. odds for getting a good hand?
One hand in four will be good enough for an opening bid (this.
teen or more high card points). Of the other three, two hands wrli
fall between seven and twelve points, and the remaining hand in
four will have six or less points.
of your opening hands, only three iii eight will have fifteen or
more points; which is about one hand out of every ten that you
get. it you play women (strong) two—bids, only one hand in one
hundred and twenty-five will have the necessary twenty-one or
more high card points necessary to open that bid.
Well then, you play bridge to get constitutional hands. Under
those circumstances you’re just about as bad off. one hand in three.
you Won’t have a five-card suit. Thirteen hands ill twenty Won't
have a singleton or void, where only one hand in twenty-five will
have a void. ‘i‘three hands out of eight will have a two biddable
suits; and only one hand in seven Will have ten or more cards in
two suits. One hand in dirty»three will have at least a seven card
suit.
But all these odds are based upon it perfectly random deal
which. of course, you say. is impossible. That’s true, but a deck
is included to run “state" or “cold" rather than “warm”. The
manner in which cards are played in tricks, placed together and
“insufficiently shuffled" exhibits the possibility of random deals.
To solve that situation, you can try playing a couple hands of sell<
there, or dealing “goulash,” Le. dealing five to each player, five
again and then three. Generally speaking, though, the bridge
player is concerned to eat his stable of average hands, which
brings up a good point. Contract bridge is a game of mileage, The
better you do with the cards you get, the more miles to the salmon
in your game. Every bridge player over the long run will get about
ten points per hand, but some bridge players will score more
points.
