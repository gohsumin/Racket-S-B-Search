SCARLET AND RLACK

Football Team Travels To Knox;
Fumbles Away Ripon Gam , 27-0

Still searching for a more po-
tent offense, the Pioneer football
team will travel to Galesburg tn-
morruw to take on the winless
SlWaShel‘s at Knox in their third
Midwest Conference game, The
Pioneers are now 1-1 after drop-
ping a 274) contest to Ripon last
Saturday.

The Pioneers got off to a hor-
rible start at Ripon by rumbling
on the second play from scrime
mage. After the Pioneers had
picked up seven yards on the first
play, they gave the ball to Ripon
near the 20. The Pioneer defense
dug in though, and the Redmen
had to settle for a 24-yard field
goal. About live minutes later, Rt
pon intercepted a pass on the Pio-
neer 40 and proceeded to drive in
Tor the score. Ripon also fumbled
once in the drive but recovered it
themselves. The final eight yards
was covered on a pass to give the
Redmen a 10-0 lead alter the first
quarter.

The next time the Pioneers got
moving, they were thwarted by an
interception again. A pass was
good to the Pioneer receiver, but
it slipped through his ﬁngers and
Ripon picked it up. The Redmen
then wasted no time in scoring
again, Quarterback Dick Kuehl
lofted the ball to Bob Pelllgrino
who juggled the ball for about
three steps, then outrun the Pio-
neer secondary for the doryard
touchdown.

Late in the second quarter the
Pioneers had their best chance to

 

get on the scoreboard wllen John
Lawson creamed the Ripon quar-
terback, who fumbled, and the
ball was recovered on the six
yard line. The Pioneers were then
pushed back to the 12 where they
again gave up the ball. A pass
was again picked off by Ripon af»
ter the ball had slipped through
Grinnell’s hands.

Near the end of the third quar—
ter the Redmen picked off another
Pioneer pass and returned it to
the five yard line, But the de—
fense held and Ripon kicked a-
nother field goal, In the fourth
quarter the Redmen picked anoth-
er Pioneer fumble on the Grinnell
25 and in two plays went in for the
final score Late in the fourth
quarter the Pioneers had their on-
ly sustained drive of the game
which took them to the Ripon five
where they proceeded to lose it on
another interception.

Coach Bowers thought the Flu
near defensive line and line back»
ers did a good job. Also the Pio-
neer backfield allowed Ripon to
complete only seven of 27 passes,
but unfortunately three of them
were touchdowns. Bowers also
noted that the game would have
been very boring to the impartial
spectator as the game consisted
of only punts and an occasional
Pioneer mistake late in thEir ter-
ritory. Bowers noted that Ripon
never got a long drive together for
a score but were always given the
ball very near the goal before
they scored,

 

To improve the offense, Bowers
said Grinnell must have better
qual'terbacking, blocking, and run-
ning from the halfbacks. In an
effort to beef up the offense this
week, Bowers plans much expere
imenting. Sophomores Kent Thom-
son and Rich Weeks will be given
a shot at the quarterback spot.
John Shierholz will remain at the
halfback spot With Dick Lamb.
Bob Watt, Dave Synhorst, and
Jim Ceai-nal in the running for
the other one, AI Peterson will
remain at one slot, but the other
will be contested for by Jim Pol-
son, Jeff Franiz, and Tom Hill,

On defense, guard Erick Vail
and back John Kelsey will likely
miss the Knox game with Injur-
Iesi Rick Anderson and John Pitt-
man have also been ailing but are
expected to play

Knox, which dropped its first
two games to Ripon 3&7, and Be-
loit, 41-7, currently stands ninth
in the league on offense and last
on defense.

The freshman grid team Will
open its schedule by meeting the
Cornell yearlings Friday at Mt.
Vernon,

Probable starters, according to
Coach John Pfitsch, are Brian
Barnes and Dave Luthy, ends;
Bob Campell and Bob Lillis, tack~
les; AI Cloud and Grant Crandall,
guards; Randy Stare, center; Tom
Lower, quarterback; Pat Cava-
naugh and Don Kraitsik, half-
backs: and Roger Bryant, full-
back.

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneers this year have lost soccer, 3 sport which
was considered by many people, including me, to be one of
the most exciting sports of the whole year. It was especially
exciting since Coach Irv Simone was able to build strong
teams that gave stiff challenges to such small college powers
as Wheaton and Lake Forest. Unfortunately Simone is on
leave this semester, so the sport was dropped as an official
college sport. A few of the veterans from last year’s team
have formed a soccer club, under the direction of Dirk Baay
(German), This is a good idea but it will never replace the
regular teams for excitement because it was sometimes as
much fun to watch Simone as the game.

Anyway, when Simone returns, let’s hope the sport will
be resumed. The thrill of seeing the Pioneers score a goal
or seeing someone like little Fred Miller battle for the ball
among people that look twice as big as he is something which
Grinnell sports fans, especially ones who have never seen a
soccer game in person, should see. For this particular excite-
ment can never be matched by seeing a touchdown scored or
a runner finish first in a cross-country race.

The crosscountry team was disappointed in not winning
the Les Duke invitational. But this is a good team and it would
be wrong to think otherwise, The barriers have two first-class
runners in Jeri Langham and John Sharpe. There are also
five other good runners: Steve Brintnall, Doug Dray, Bob
Grant, Ric MacDowell, and Spencer Clark.

A person who should know, the Carleton coach whose
team is seeking its fourth straight league title, considers the
Pioneers a co»favorite along with his team to take the crown
this year. Unfortunately, Carleton has got tremendous help
from sophomores who are new four of the top five runners
on the team.

There are at least three more tough teams (Beloit, St.
Olaf, and Cornell) in the Midwest Conference this year. But
the Pioneers soundly defeated both Cornell and Beloit in
the Les Duke invitational. So it is not unlikely that Coach
Young’s team will finish near the top as they usually do.
