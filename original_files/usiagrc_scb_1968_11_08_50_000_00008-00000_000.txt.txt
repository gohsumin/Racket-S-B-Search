Freshman Football Team ltolls
To Second Undefeated Season

By KRISTI SCHMITI‘

For the second year in his-
tory the Griiinell ireshmen were
undefeated in their regular sea-
son of competition. They rolled
over Wartburg, Knox, and Coo
and, in doing so, massed 112

omts against the 3 opponents.
ine young Pioneers, only suit-
Ing 18 players at the beginning
of the season and winding up
with 16 staunch hearted men to
compete in their last game
against Coe, were considered
one of the best prospective var-
sity teams in recent Grinnell
history

The last game, true to the
new tradition, was star-studded
in the overwhelming victory.
The young Pioneers put togeth~
or 349 yards in the air and 117
yards on the ground on their
way to a 50 to 19 wallop over
rival Coe.

The game was filled with of-
fensive heroics on the part of
the Grinnell freshmen. The first
of many touchdowns came on a

ass from quarterback Bill
gicks to tight end Scott Hanson,
followed up with the extra
point by Jim Pimlli. For the
second score, Dicks connected
with wingback Ed Hersh tor
another Grinnell touchdown, lol-
fowed again by a 1»point con-
version via the toe of Jim Pirol-
ii. Not to he denied a fourth
down on the three yard line,
Mario Eognanno plunged in for
still another score; this time

followed by a two point conver—
sion from Dicks to tight and
Scott Hansonr The team ended
the iirst hall with a 22 to 0
score in their lawn

The second half was no less
exciting, 30 minutes from vic<
tory and glory, the freshmen
again took the field. The un<
stoppable offense was too much
for Coe’s defense, Accounting
for 7 of the to points in the sec.
and half was Mario Bognanno
on a slant 0ft tackle for and
yard and followed by conver-
sion Another 7 points were con-
tributed by Randy Sarver, on a
bruising plunge from the three
yard line. The next player to
hit pay dirt was Jim Pirolli, tak-
log a pitch from Bill Dicks in
the end mm, followed by I
tricky two point conversion to
(snag (The Phantom) Bombin-
aki. This sure-handed Chica-
goan pulled in the low delivered
pass with professional finesse.
The last score In the closing
moments of the game was hand-
led with tho scoring combina-
tion 0! Dicks and Pirollir Pimlli
again added the 50th point.

The glory was not all In the
backfield. The offensive line,
with contributions from Bill
Wright, Rod Gleysteen. Dave
Cassei, Doug Watts, and Jared
Van Wagenen, played an impor.
tant part in the victory effort.
In all, thesﬂ future Grinnell
varsity team members have
proven themselves able and wills
ing to produce etiicienily.

Until the time ran out, no
one was sure that the score
would remain with Grinnell
ahead ma over Lawrence.
Neither team scored in the first
half and Lawrence was able to
keep the Pioneers in trouble
during the whole ﬁrst quarter.
The turning point was the field

the quarter Grinnall gave up,

up when Bruce Rollins recov-
ered a punt fumbled by Law-

the end zone. Four plays later
Lawrence again fumbled and
Dick Pope recovered.

Three downs later, with three
yards to go, the Pioneers scored
on a pass from Johnson to Win-
terson. Lawrence took over the
ball on the strength of two long
passes or 20 yards and 47 yards
and was able to share the Pio-
neers’ lead to 2 points (loo).
After the kickoff, the situation
became extremely tense when
Gary Johnson’s pass was
intercepted and returned to
the Grinnell 22. An unbe-
lievable defense effort, how
ever, threw Lawrence back on
each of its next three plays for
a loss of 21 yards. The Vikings
