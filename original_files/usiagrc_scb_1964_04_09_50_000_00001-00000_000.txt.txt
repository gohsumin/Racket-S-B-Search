1964 Grinnell Mock Political Convention to Involve
YD's. YR's. More than Half Grinnell Student Body

Before it runs its course, the
1964 Grinnell Mock Convention
will have utilized the talents of
over half of the Grinnell stu-
dent body. Heading the stu-
dents’ preparation for the con-
vention have been the Presl«
dents of the Grinnell Young
Democrats and Young Republi-
cans, Dave Evans and Bob
Savage.

Their work has been super-
vised only by C. Edwin Gil-
mour, who, as Director of the
Program in Practical Political
Education, has overseen the en-
tire student preparation for the
convention.

The Vice<Presidents or the
YD's and YR'S, Signe Hanson
and Roger Ferris, are the
chairmen of the Credentials
Committees for the Democratic
and Republican conventions,
It has been their responsibility
for organizing the enlistment of
delegates, assigning delegates
to state delegations, and ar-
ranging the seating oi the dele-
gates oll the convention floor.

The Rules under which the
two conventions will operate
have been prepared by Anne
Bradley for the Democrats and

Jim Parkison for the Republi-

cans.

The two Mock Political
Conventions will be followed
by a Mock Presidential elec-
tion, Tuesday, April 21, using
the slates chosen at the con-
vention. There will be a ten
day period of campaigning
before the election. Voting
machines will be used to
tabulate the results.

 

The task of transforming
Darby Gymnasium into “Con-
vention Hall” has been the re-
sponsibility of Bill Whelan for
the Democrats and Jim Stod-
dart for the Republicans.

Platform committees headed
by Jack Spence and Tom Evans
have worked to formulate the
platforms which will be pre-
sented to the Democratic and
Republican platform sessions
of the Mock Convention.

Tom Fuilmer has been re-
sponsible for co-ordinating the

publicity for the
Convention.

But while the preparation for
the 1964 Convention in the main
has been done by these stu-
dents, the results of the con-
vention itself will be deter-
mined by the actions of the ap-
proximately 600 convention
delegates. it is the votes of
these delegates which will de-
cide the platforms adopted by
the Parties and of greater in-
terest the nominees of each
Party.
