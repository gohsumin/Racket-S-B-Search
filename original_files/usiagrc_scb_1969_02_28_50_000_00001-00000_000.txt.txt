Paranoia Prohibiis
Useful Discussion

By RICH SCHMIECHEN

The most astute comment at the dis-
lussiun of the ”Grinnell Experience” last
Sunday was made by Mrl Liggett: no
one need worry about the continued
existence or the liberal arts college
since the Electoral College has lasted 50
long. Liggett, along with Mr. Leggett,
Mr, Parzen, and Mr. Gurofi participated
in a panel discussion and general gripe
session in the South Lounge.

President Leggett outlined what he
thought were the three greatest prob
lems lacing Grinnell: education of black
students; illustration to the public that

rinnell students are diverse and not
omngeneous: and a rational assess
ment at “risk a taking" underlying
curriculum, student participation in
college policy making, residential living,
and interdisciplinary matters. The prolr
lems oi the Black students must not be
belittled, but those or taking "risks" and
the college's student image seem less
yhan the’ most central issues. Too much

‘r'lsk-worrying" leads to too much delay,
too much needless nervousness, and too
much wasted energy, ”Images" are
elusive and impossible to control. They’re
the problem of the RR. department,
while the library, student representa-
tion, the curriculum, and {underaising
(tan be dealt with by the whole college
bommunity.

Yet‘ Mr. Leggett should (and I mean
this sincerely) be congratulated for
taking the risk of joining the panel
discussion. His presence at a public
meeting was one or the few positive
values of the discussion And who
could blame him for wishing to es«
cape those nasty, complaining stu-
dents at the meeting and, even more,
that large “silent. majority,“ sitting
llstlessly on the soft forum carpeting?

Prof. Guroif, in spite of his innovations
In class, was unwdling to take risks at
the discussion. Gurdtt, having given a
hazy introductory speech (including such
acute perceptions as there is a "failure
of communication between students and
faculty), answered “dangerous" ques-
tions by stating that, after all, he has
only been at Grinnell for six months. He
put on that protective shield which lnsu-
totes and isolates so many professors
and students at Grinnell.

Professor Parzen has the reputation
for taking risks. in his opening, speech,
he stated that the academic instltution
exists for the students (a revolutionary
concept to some) and it is a place for the
”welding together or imagination and
knowledge." The raculty instead or
“teaching" should provide a way for stu-
dents to find answers for themselves. Fa-
culty members should be both advisors
and counselors to students, and Pane“
finally recommended that a dept. of in-
tcrdisciplinary studies be established.

Prof. Panen sat silently through most
of the rest at the chaos, Nearly every-
one else at the meeting seemed to be in
terested in bludgeoning others for their
own rigth and their own seliprouection.
it‘s not that "silence is golden," but
nastiness and selfish self-protection are
even less so. There was little else at this
discussion.

PRESIDENT LEGGETT and 3 faculty
members participated in a panel on
the “Grinnell Experience" Sunday in
the South Lounge.

leggell Announces
Tu‘i’ilnn Increase

president Leggett announced Friday a
$175.00 increase in fees for the 1969—70
academic year, bringing the total com-
preliensive fee tor one year at Grinnell
to $3,275. Tuition has increased from
$2,125 to $2,270, This amount, in accord-
ance with the Trustees' policy, covers
approximately two-thirds of the actual
educational Cast for each student, Other
increases from costs of food and health
services will also be made, totaling an
additional $30.

In a letter to Grinnell parents Presi-
dent Leggett explained the major rea-
sons for the increases along with a
general forecast of the financial situa-
tion. He said, “The major reasons for
the increases are (l) the continuing ins
tense competition for and the rising
salaries or highly qualified scholar
teachers, and (2) higher staii wages and
student labor wages, together with the
general inflation of costs. These rea‘
sons are of course not unique to Grinnell.
All colleges and universities, public and
private, are facing financial problems.
This is indicated by the fact that among
the to colleges belonging to the Asso-
clated Colleges of the Midwest (of which
Grinnell is one), the projected increases
in comprehensive charges for next year
range from $160 to $405, with an average
or $227 per institution.

"We expect a very substantial in«
crease in operating costs for 1969-70.

SENATE POSlPOtlES ELECTION;
Referendum lo Decide SGA Future

Thursday afternoon, an emergency
open Senate meeting was called to re-
consider the Senate's earlier decision

' to postpone the SGA elections until some

data before the final legal date of March
15 and their motion calling for a refer-
endum to abolish all parts of student
government excluding the Finance Com-
mittee.

The request for a reconsideration
came from two candidates, John Herr
and Jim Lew, who had not been informed
of the motion, two senators, and several
students. With 150 students in the audi-
ence, the members of the Senate
described the petition whlch was cir-
culatcd to postpone the scheduled eleo<
tions and its 8-2 ratification.

The discussion involved the specific
platforms of the Candidates and the
need to have an SGA president or Sen<
ate at all, in response to the involvement
and interest of the student body.

The referenduin’s purpose was clari-
ﬁed and argued by Dan Cheifetz

and Diane Pomerance as not being an
attempt to do away with student gov‘
ernment but to make the student body
think about, and possibly reconstruct, a
new representative government. The
Board of Elections will handle the elec-
tions for SGA as in the previous years.
The decision of the election date at a
yet undetermined time before Saturday.
March 15, was re-atfirmad.

The Senate decision and Wednesday
morning’s withdrawal or a candidate
have called into question the way the
races have been nin this Week. According
to Lee Maril, who originated the petition
for postponement, ”I think it Shows what:
people think about student government."
The petition, which obtained 210 signa-
tures in an hour and a half on Wednes-
day night, states, “We believe that the
student interest necessary tor a respon-
sible student government is not present
at this time,” a feeling indicated also by
a candidate to whom Maril talked about

Box 64th

Attorney Enich, assisted by Assistali!
S t a te Attorney General, Douglas
Carlson and Robert Alvine of the AttuiV
ney General’s office, called nine wit<
hesses, eight of them Grinnell students.
The defendants were represented by
their attorney, Dan Johnston of Des
Moines, and his partner, Lawrence Ls
Tourneau.

The hearing was held in an atmos<
phcre of apparent friction between the
county attorney and the eight student
witnesses. Students seemed reluctant to
say any more than the absolute mini-
mum and many seemed uncertain about
whether or not they had to give testi-
mony. The state generally asked the
same questions of its witnesses: whether
they had attended the Gates discussion
on February 5, it they “noticed anything
unusual," whether they observed the
defendants in attendance, and what the
“appearance" of the defendants Was.

One witness, James Sebem, ’69, 60v
editor of ,the Cyclone, was asked if he
had taken any pictures of the incident.
He said that he had and gave some to
the prosecution. The county attorney
asked him if he had taken any other
pictures, and Sebem stated that he had
destroyed the other pictures and nega-
tives after he determined that they
would not be needed for the yearbook,
and when he heard that they could be
subpoenaed as evidence.

5&3 editor Susan Kaeser was also
Called as a witness. The state asked the
usual questions but neglected to ask her
to identify the defendants in the Court<
room by sight. On these grounds, John-
ston moved that her testimony be strickv
en, and his motion was allowed.

State's witnesses Gary M. Giddlns. '10.
