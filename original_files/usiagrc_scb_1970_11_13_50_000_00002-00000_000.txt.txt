ReligiousGuru Raps to GrinneH

by Mark Subleman

When a caravan of more than
thirty brightly and variously
decorated busses and cars
and of more than two hundred
brightly and variously dressed
people came to Grinnell last
Tuesday, many Grinnellians
wondered what it was allabout.

If they stayed to inquire or
went that night to Derby gym,
they learned that it was all
about a religious guru from
San Francisco namedStephen,
who had a philosophy that was
all about unified fields, and
telepathy, and being together,
and energy of attention, and
the third eye, and drugs, and
tripping, and non violence.

Stephen, a tall, slender man
of 35, who entered what he
mlled ”the guru business"
almost five years ago, is lea»
ding two hundred of his most
devoted followers on a trip H
with all puns intended -- ace
ross the country and back, a
trip which he hopes will bring
him and his flock new exper—
iences and insights, and bring
his message to new people as
well.

First stop on the trip, after
the caravan left San Francisco
“with untold tons of dope,"
was Sublimity, Oregon. After
the caravan crossed the bor-
der, and Oregon state police
“relieved" the members of
their drugs, Stephen went on
to Sublimity and his speaking
engagement there.

Neither he nor anyone else
in the group was arrested at
that encounter, however; and
Stephen attributed this, and
the “excellent" relations they
have had all along with local
officials to the group‘s Striv-
ing for good relationships with
others. Stephen teaches his
followers (0 be friendly and
strive for “good vibrations"
with everyone, for he believes
that in any endeavor, “you get
out of it exactly what you put
intn it -- as you sow, so shall

you reap."

Much of Stephen's teaching
is, like this, strangely tradi*
tional, or from traditionalor-
igins. There is, he told the
audience in Darby, "no ex-
cuse for being violent -- Thou
shalt n0t kill. lfa lot ofpeople
just act peaceful, they can
make peace come.”

Stephen’s own theology is,
in fact, a curious blend oftra-
ditional ideas, Western and
Eastern, secular and religir
ous, as well as a few newer
ideas of Stephen's own. He
considers his Zen master,
Suzuki Roshi, and the writings
of Aldous Huxley to be two of
the biggest inﬂuences on him.

Christian influences arealso
apparent in Stephen: he told
his audience of almost five
hundred people in Grinnell
that ”Christianity has not
been tried and found wanting;
it has been tried and found
difficult." He attributed the
decline of Christianity and
other religions in the past to
“materialism, the profit mo-
tive, and formal education."

But apparently materialism
and formal education have not
been entirely successful. Ste-
phen said Tuesday afternoon
that there are now signs ofthe
beginning of a large spiritual
revival. San Francisco, he
said, is the “guru capital of
the world," and in recent
years there has been a steady
increase in the number of
gurus, and in the diversity of
their international origins.

This religious revival and
increase, Stephen believes, is
the result of a return to the
”vibratory disciplines”, or
those which deal with opening
up people’s minds, especially
telepathically. They are con-
cerned with opening up the in-
dividual's "third eye" by whs
ich he perceives other minds
and understands new insights
about the world.

Stephen believes that drugs
are very helpful in the process

"SENATOR CHARLES 'Three's-arcrowd' Percy says
he will sponsor a bill in the 92nd Congress to limit the
number of income tax exemptions for children to two,
because what with the population explosion and the

Pablum shortage two

children

per family should

become a 'way of life in America.‘ Senator Dooley
Moss back (1., Confusion), will provide legislation

requiring the government

Greek Music Expresses

Did you know that Euripides
was considered a great popur
lar song composer in ancient
Greece? Or that it is perfects
ly possible to play a double
horn pipe upside down? No?
Then you missed a good lec-
ture last Monday night. Dr.
Douglas Feaver of Lehigh Un-
iversity gave a well-attended
talk sponsored by the Depart
ment of Classical Languages
on the nature and instruments
of ancient Greek music.

Senate Comes To life
Finishes Old Business

by Don Dagenais

Because of the late appear“
ance of the 5&B this year,
there has been a decided lack
of coverage ofStudent Govern?
ment Association activities
this fall. Yes, Virginia, there
is an SGA (despite widespread
student belief to the contrary),
and furthermore it is alive
and kicking. The mainprob-
lem, however, has been that
its activities are not easily
visible to the student bodyand
therefore are vastly under
appreciated.

Many students have been
justifiably driven from the
Senate meetings because of
the Senate's preoccupation
with mundane bureaucratic
matters. Students are begin-
ning to feel that the major
point of interest in the Senate
meetings so far has been that
Greg Vranicar has hada ch-
ance to show off his ﬂoppy
old black felt hat. But take our
word for it, Fall Senate actir
vity is usually not so drab.
Last year's early closing nes
cessitated the postponement
until now of such business as
the interviewing and appoint
ing of committee members,
approving the budget, etc.

Fortunately, these tasks are
now in their final stages of
completion, and SGA Presis

about the “relevancy" of his
topic (he thinks it is), Feaver
proceeded to paint a picture
of the Greek society which
thought of music not as an
element of entertainment, but
as a basic component of the
life of the intellectual. Music,
in the opinion of the Greeks,
is net only a means ofexpress
sing the emotions, but is a
method of molding emotions,
therefore shaping the charac

dent Loewi guarantees that
future meetings will deal with
topics of more universal ins
terest. Discussions of such
subjects as the financial sit—
uation of the college, possible
calendar changes (the poten‘
riality of a 4—1-4 scheduling,
etc.), the Group Independent
ideas of Henry Scheff (pre-
sented in an earlier 5&8),
changes in the grading sys-
tem, townrgown relations,
and, of course, the Great
Faculty Requirements Debate,
are in the works.

Increased student particlpar
tion will, of course, be a key
factor in the success or fail-
ure of such discussions. It is
tactfully suggested that stud-
ents reread thatlast sentence.

The Student Coordinator’s
office has been far from inac-
tive. Greg Vranimr, Student
Coordinator, has the duties of
being a campus ombudsman,
a "troubleshooter" of sorts
who acts as a link between
faculty and administration and
students in solving problems
of all sorts. He has done a
tremendous amount ofworkso
far this year in the develop-
ment of the Committee Apro-
posals calling for increased
student participation in the

required to have extensive

example, argued for at least
three years of lessons on the

slides and tape recordings,
