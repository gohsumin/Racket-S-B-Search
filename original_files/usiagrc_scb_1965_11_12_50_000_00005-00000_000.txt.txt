incisive rhetoric that he also calls
the Justice Department “legal
eagles” and uses the catchy phrase,
"the supposed learned citizenry.“
l almost hate to suggest it. but the
good sergeant seems to have ac-
quired some assumptions that he
cannotpereeivc and examine, some
inhibitions that prevent his con-
sidering anything but his own
limited viewpoint.

Look at his language tor the
elites, The military is a “family“
to him Does this suggest some-
thing? Why eannot this man ques-
tion his government7 He says it
never even occurred to him to do
so. But, further, he feels that to
protest is “Lo prostitute my pro.
fession," We all have our sex
problems; we all sublimate, etc.
But the sergeant lets his prob.
lems (whatever their cause)
interiere with his perceptions of
his own behavior, and, unable to
understand himselt, he cannot un-
derstand others.

He says (ior example) that the
war in Viet Nam is essential, The
people there live in degradation
and ignorance. The 11.5. must save
them. Yet, no matter how appar-
ently true these sentiments, when
he cites as an example of their
degradation the prostitution of the
widow ot a Vietnamese army pri-
vate, he must lose most at his case,
for he surely must realize that this
poor woman would not be a widow
it there had been no widespread
war and that she vei-y probably is
selling herself to some good Ameri
can “Joe" just like the sergeant;
hﬁit, somehow, he does not realize
t is.

when the sergeant was iaeed,
too, by the tin box or a dead
soldier and he was tilled with pity
and prayer, why did he then turn
to anger and shame at those who
sympathize with him? Why does
he react so vehemently against
those who hope to end all needless
carnage and those who want at
least to find the human justifica-
tion tor our participation in a war
so remutei He could have said, in-
stead, "Although I am a soldier. 1
hate this war. 1 will not light in it."

Every man is at the command oi
only his own conscience, but the
sergeant has “ideals and princi-
ples" those unexamined as.
sumptions » that prevent him

from acting against a set ot fixed,
limited, and arbitrary rules. As he
says, the military “take great pride
in themselves, in their uniiorms,
and in their nation." One only
hopes that the scrgeant's state-
ment is not in order of his pro
ferenpe. Ior pride in one’s suit oi
clothing _ be it zoot - suit or
khaki e is analogous to a shallow,
surface type of thought.

i do not advocate here the evacu-

ation oi our army nor insist upon
the ialsity ot all of the sergeant‘s
stalemenlsr Whai. in the end I
conclude from his editorial is that.
his opinions and those like his are
clearly limited in their percep-
livity and should be cansidei‘ed as
such, The danger of the iailure to

understand, moreover, is not in
berent ‘ any one position, but
may s - e down the liberal, the
conservative, the uninterested, all
with the same sort of mental blind-
ness,

When mind soars in pursuit of
the things conceived in spate,

it pursues emptiness;

But when man buys a ’66 Cyclone,
he experiences the fullness

of existence.
