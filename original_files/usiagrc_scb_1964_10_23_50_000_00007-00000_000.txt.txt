Gridders To

Play Bucs

Fight To Stay In Race

The Pioneers and Beloit’s
Buccaneers, both r an k e d
among the Midwest Confer-
ence’s elite on defense, will be
battling to stay in the cham-
pionship race when they collide
on the Eeloit gridiron Saturdayi

It's Belolt‘s Homecoming,
with the game scheduled for 2
pm.
The two clubs currently share
third place with Coe, all having
3-1 marks and trailing co-lead—
ers Grinnell and Ripon by a
game. While the winner will
retain a shot at the title, the
loser almost certainly will be
relegated to the “spoiler" cate-
gory.

The spotlight will be on de~
fense as the Bucs and Pioneers
currently rank first and third,
respectively, in the loop in that
category. Beloit has allowed an
average of only 161 yards per
game with Grinnell being
touched for but 176 yards.

Both outfits have also been
extremely s tin g y pointwise,
Coach Edd Bowers‘ Pioneers
have allowed 25 markers and
have not had their goal line
crossed since the opening day
of the season. in their last three
outings, the Pioneers have
whitewashed Knox 160, Mon-
mouth 42-0, and Lawrence 21-0.
Opponents have managed 28
points against Beloit. Only
once, in a 15-13 loss to St. Olaf,
have the Bucs surrendered
more than one touchdoWn. Both
crews compliment their strong
defenses with potent offenses

Grinnell has an edge in this
department with 94 points and
an average of 292 yards per
contest. Though its point pro-
duction of 40 is less than half
of Grinnell's, Beloit has moved
the ball well all year and is
averaging 226 yards per en-
gagement.

Bowers sees Beloit as by far
the toughest team his Pioneers
have faced since dropping their
opener to Ripon, 25-l4.

Though his Grinnellians have
Collected 79 points in their last
three games, Bowers is still far
from satisfied with the offense.
Poor blocking, both in the inter-
ior line and backfield, has been
the Chief Villain. Because of an
inconsistent in s i d a running
game, the Pioneers have had
to rely on end sweeps more
than Bowers likes. He also 1a-
mented the inconsistency of the
passing game, but feels it is
now beginning to come around,

Because of Beloit‘s powerful
forward wall, the Pioneers al-
most certainly will stress going
around and over rather than
through. Passing will play a big
role in the outcome of the
game, the Grinnell

aerial game will keep the Bucs
honest.

One major Pioneer lineup
change may have halfback
Elston Bowers
fullback because of a leg
injury to Marty Ringo in
the Lawrence game last week-
end. Ringo joined Dave Imes
on the injury list, leaving
sophomore Nord Erue as the
only healthy fullback, Bowers,
who lead Pioneer ball carriers
with 309 yards in 63 attempts,

saw some action at fullback in
1962 as a sophomore.

If Bowers goes to fullback
sophomore Bob Watt will take
over at the left half with John
Shierholz at righ half. Shierholz
has netted 226 yards in 40 car»
ries and Watt has scooted for
130 in 19. The latter has ac-
counted for all but two of his
yards in the last two games.

Quarterback Barry Anderson
will complete the backfield.
He's completed 31 of 89 aerials
for 384 yards and four TDs,

The starting offensive line
will have Dave Gauger and
Mike Dewitt or Al Peterson at
end; Rein Saral and Eric Mil-
ler at tackle; Jeff Lewis and
Rick Anderson at guard; and
Morgan Michel at center,

Defensively, the number one
unit will look like this: Dewitt
and Tom Hill or Chip Kinsey at
end; Skip Weyrsuch and Denny
Homerin at tackle; Pete Staben
or Mike Miller at middle guard;
Tom hannom and Paul Thurs—
ton as linebackers; and Watt,
Denny Hanssen, Chip Clarke,
and Dave Synhorst 'in the back-
field,

In tackle Bob Stewart and
guard Jan Dill, both 205 pound-
ers, Beloit has two of the con-
ference's outstanding linemen.
Both were first team all-loop
selections a year ago, Stewart
being named on both the offen-
sive and defensive units, Tackle
Rusty Mitzner, guard Dick
Stewart, and center Henry Eck»
stein are other Buc line main»
stays.

Sophomore quarterbacks Rick
Stutz and Mike Phillips direct
the offense. Butch Ranallo, who
received all-loop honors as a
linebacker in 1963, and Frank
Meci, are other top backs.

Grinnell took over on the Law-

Gauger with a 14 yard pass.
Bowers and Watt took over and
carried the ball down to the
Lawrence one. After two at-
tempts, fullback Marty Ringo
bulled his way over from the
one to make the score 12-0. The
Pioneers then used their favor-
ite play, faked the place kick,
and Anderson hit end Mike De-
witt with a pass to make the
score 1+0. This play has worked

Wabash Runs Here
For Second Meet

Coach Dick Young’s small
band of Pioneer cross country
runners will return to intercol-
legiate wars Saturday by host-
ing Wabash in a dual meet.

The meet will be run on the
Pioneers' 3-mile course begin»
ning at 1:30 p.m.

Grinnell will again be going
with four runners and thus will
have to forfeit 10 or more points
to the Indiana team, Running
for Grinncll will be Bruce Beck~
ord, Clyde Smith, Steve Brint—
nall and Andy Bushnell. Still
sidelined are vGrinnell’s two
aces—Rod Brown and Paul
Patterson.

Patterson, who has been out
of action since the initial meet
of the campaign with a leg in-
jury, has started running again,
but is still bothered by the in—
jury and is far out of condi-

tion. Young still doesn’t know ,

when—or ifvhe will be able to
run competitively again this
year,

The defending Midwest Con-
ference champion, Brown is re-
covering from a siege of mono-
nucleosis and Still isn’t run-
ning. He now appears to be out
for the season.

The Pioneers and Wabash
met once earlier in the year, at
the Wabash Invitational.

Patterson and Brown, in their
only joint appearance of the
year, came in third in that
meet, with Brintnall and Smith
placing fifth. Wabash Zrman

ished second, fourth, and ninth.

Lawrence kicked off to start
the second half and the Pio-
neers marched 73 yards for the
final touchdown of the game,
Anderson hit Gauger and De-
Witt with passes to move the
ball to the Lawrence 4. Elston
Bowers then carried over from
the one, Gauger made the con-
version good and Grinnell led
21-0.
