iiig problems or the “Capital.”

At this point the group is tak-
itig surveys based on complaints

disllicts of Des Moiiies. These will
be used for iurther rent strikes and
attempts to raise the standards or
llvmg in these areas.

The Project is also working to
ward this summer and a projected
vacation — long struggle with the
troubles oi the poverty - ridden
parts at the city. They are look-
ing tor people who would be will-
ing to spend their vacation doing
this.

Downey stated that [his was still
one oi their problems: people will-
ing to become a permanent part
of the group. of course, anybody

willing to give any time is we]-
coined,
One oi the bigger problems is

that ol iinahcial support. The prorl
the '

ject received $425.00 from
SAGA inst, but this is not enough.
Downey stated, "We're attempt
log to get iinancial help from the
SDS Midwest Regional Organizing
Conference, but with little luck so
far.”

The group still meets on Tues-
days at 10 pm. arid any inter-
ested in ﬁnding out anything about
the group’s activities is invttedi
Downey also stated that Billy
King, the project organizer in Des
Moines, may be on campus next
Week.

Downey went on to say that, as
far as the group itself is con-
cerned, they were in the process
oi ending activities tor the year.

A great many or the problems
extant on the Grinnell campus gs“.
eraily end up in a worn, over
shifted leather armchair in room
No. 21 of Stelner Hall. Here they
encounter the always dynamic and
usually ameliorating iiilluence oi
Gt‘innell's chaplain, Roger Eld-
ridge. >

Eldridge describes the relation of
the chaplain to the college com-
munity as “complex" and the
cliaplaihesqlle duties as both di-
verse and demanding. Monday is
perhaps the worst day tor the
chaplain (“A real drag—l never
make major decisions on Mon-
day"), iollowing the weekend rig-
ors oi sermon preparation and de-

oif and reserved all day Sunday,
and only those with Special Guest
Parking tickets will be allowed to
park in these areas.

chickens Gone

Last week John Wolf advertised
that he had over 100 baby chickens
for sale. This week he has proud-
ly announced that they are gone.
The bulk of the chicks went to
Uncle Sam's Club.

The remainder — about 10 «
either died or were given to in-
dividuals on campus. Wolf said
that “they were removed from my
apartment only hours before my
landlady had threatened to come
and cruelly send them into the
cold hard world."

Advice is sought on a wide range
or issues, summer set-Vice pro-
jecls, religious belieis, sex ethics.
and home lile. Because of home
problems, the number or counsel-
ing appointments generally picks
up alter vacations.

Although functioning in a coun-
seling capacity has brought Eld-
i‘i‘dge close to a wide cross secs
tion of the student body, “the
time demands involved have ham-
pered tollowing through on other
responsibilities and terms at par-
ticipation in campus life." He ad-
voca s an expansion oi counseling

not be so dependent on the chat»
lain’s office and would have a
broader base in aiding students.

In the relationship or the chap-
loiiicy to the iaculty iaction oi the
campus community, Eldridge has
found much cooperation, especial-
ly with such programs as the race
series dinners, nuclear War dis—
cussions, and student-faculty di—
ciission groups. Much progress has
been made in the past three years
in student involvement in more
relevant and responsible activities.
These include the Inner City Semi-
nars in which students take OK
for urban areas during Christmas
and spring vacation to study and
experience the reality or poverty
in the city; REACH, a program

involving tutoring or children in
town by college students and other
means oi improving towncollegc
relations; and the Des Momes
Project, in which students aid in
developing and improving a pov-
erty pocket area in Des Moines.

Eldridge might be characterized
as “an idealistic young man,” his
cause being education, the liberal
arts and higher education ior min-
ority groups in particular. As chap-
lain he ﬁnds an outlet for this
idealism as chairman of the Na-
tional Association at College and
University Chaplains’ commission
on education for minority groups.
In this capacity he has not been
able to achieve many concrete
results (“although i have made it
lot of nice talks") because the
voluntary nature or the association.
limits the source of funds and
staff available.

Also confronting the college
chaplain are “more conferences
than he should go to.” In the past
month, Eldridge has traveled to
Evanston. Illinois, for a NACUC
conference and to St, Louis [or a
Daniorlh Foundation meeting. On
his agenda is a trip to Fisk Uni-
versity in NashVille, Tennessee.
where he will give a sermon and
meet with a seminar group.

Although the duties of the chap-
lain are demanding and diverse.
Eldridge's heavy schedule of Couli-
seling is easily evidenced by the
number of students emerging from
Steiner and stating, “He under-
stands me!”
