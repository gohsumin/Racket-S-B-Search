Problem ls Spiri‘i

To the Editor:

To many people, the basic problem at Grin<
hell is not open dorms, BELG, or the hall sys-
tem, but the spirit and atmosphere of the col-
lege me, both academic and social. Vilal to
all colleges in general and the small liberal
arts college in particular is an active (3011‘
cem on the part of the students for what they
are doing and what is happening around
them. A number of other colleges have many
of the same aspects as Grinnell — size, rules,
seclusion —- but have much different atmos-
phere. What these schools have that Grinnell
does not have are student bodies which are
aware. excited, and excitable. It is this lack
of vibrancy and excitement which is basic to
the Grinnell campus problem.

What we need is an airing of emotions and
an intellectual interchange of those topics
which should be important to us — the role
at the student in the community, the active
process of learning, current events, speakers,

concerts, and everything else which we should
be concerned about.

The 5&3 has a direct Iunclion and re-
spons ility in the formation of such a re-
vitalized atmosphere. As the ideal medium—
in terms of format and distribution—the 5853
should carry on discussions arising from col-
luqlliurns. review stimulating events, and pose
discussions 0! the'ideas and questions in-
volved. Discussion is a direct step toward an
environment where there is an excited inter-
change and conﬂict of ideas, and outlooks. The
Shit should ire-evaluate its role in the build-
ing of an active and vibrant Grinnell.

leads in ‘Faniasiicks'
‘Engagingly lnnoceni’

By BRUCE MCCONACHIE

Both Stephanie Lewis and Murry Nelson
were engagingly innocent as the Girl and Boy.
Although Stephanie‘s Voice was weak and
Murry's stage movement awkward, we never
lost interest in their poetic melodrama.

Tom Pope and Milt Tootle, their fathers.
were quite funny. Their lumbering vaude-
ville dance in the “Vegetable Song” is one or
the highpoints of the show.

But the real comics of the show were Max
Heltgott and Keith King, the dying indiun
and the aging actor. A precise sense of timing
made their periormances especially enjoyable.

Ruthie Sternberg, who portrayed the Mute.
was graceful and exact.

when the cast was taking its curtain call.
they turned to applaud Anne Hoganson and
Janet Hamilton ior their accompaniment at
the piano and harpsicord. I thank them too.

In general. the comic parts of the show
were the best, and the romantic scenes, the
weakest. But this last gripe is more an argu-
ment with the script than the production.

The cast may have been uneven in talent,
but all of them shared in the spirit at the
show. We knew they were enjoying it and this
increased our own pleasure. Rick MacDoweit.
the narrator, was outstanding. His is a
physically exhausting role’and i was amazed
that he never seemed out of breath. Rick's
lithe movements, his strong voice and the
Mephistophelean glint in his eyes practically
carried the show.

“The Fantasticks" is unique among an
nell productions in that it was ﬁnanced by
Student Govemment. I am glad that the SGA
leaders have a broad conception of their re-
spunsibiiities and I hope that they will under-
take a similar venture next year.
