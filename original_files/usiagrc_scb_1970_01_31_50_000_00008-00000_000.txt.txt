10 Against 4: Nationally Ran/(ell Holstra
Defeats Grinnell Wrestlers, 46- 0

A Letter to Cl
Young Man:

A Letter to a Young Man:

I write to you, young athlete,
of something most extraordi-
nary, which I feel I must share.
It may not be the case, nor indeed
would Iwant it to be taken so,
were it not; far be that from me.
But you see, my friend, a most
remarkable thing, as 1 may have
intimated before, seems to have
happened, or not, as the case may
be.

I seemed to lind myself in a
dank, warm, wet, and humid
room, of the sort with a grimy,
uncarpeted floor, quite lacking in
the most elementary armchairs,
and With lights in the ceiling (i).
It was utterly wretched. From
afar there waited towards me
intimations oi steam and (could
these ears decieve me?) the
sound of hoarse cries.

Can I properly describe to you
the stench of decay, the slimey
sweatsocks cast aside like so
many . . . . cast off sweatsocks?
Probably not. In any case it was
clear to me that l Wasin No Place
Meant For Man, Or perhaps in
The Place of Man, depending,
again, on your disposition in
these matters.

But peace, “Let me continue,
let the tale bide its own telling."
It is mine to be but an humble
Vessel, Now I knew where I
might be, and why Ihad come.

AsI moved to the far wall, lined
with steely lockers, my wretched
thoughts ran frantic: ”James’
‘Antique collossus’, perhaps? Or
perhaps not. Again it all
depends." (Fool that I was! i l)

I reached the wall in horrors

Cont. on P. 7

A tough and experienced
Hofslra wrestling team came

decisively defeated one senior,
two freshmen, and a sophomore
the Grinnell wrestling team. The
46-0 shutout was not unexpected,
given a fullyrstaffed and
nationally ranked Hofstra squad
and one from Grinnell which
spanned only four ol the eleven
classes.

As a matter of class, Hofstra
had it. The Grinnell Wrestlers are
out on the mat warming up or
talking to each other and the
University oi Iowa wrestler who
had come to fill out the program
with exhibition bouts. All of a
sudden, out comes Hofstra in
matched bathrobes. They're not
smiling, they’re not even looking.
What's more, they all have on
the same wrestling shoe, and the
soles curve up at the edges, and
it says ”Tiger" where it ought
tosay“U.S.KEDS.”

Chuck Farr at 118 lbs. was
Grinnell’s first entry. Although
apparently matching his op-
ponent in strength, and not much
outclassed in speed, Farr could
not avoid a pin from an obviously
Skilled opponent.

Grinnell forfeited the next
three weight classes, losing
points equivalent to pins against
them in each. Iowa takes one of
these on points, and Hofstra
cleans up the other two. By this
time the Grinnell spectators are
cheering for the University of
Iowa wrestlers.

Grinnell’s only returning let»
terman, senior Mason Klipple
excited a rather intent crowd in
a match, going all three rounds
with a rather Wells
matched opponent. Although
tiring in the second period,
rebounded to a position of ad-
vantage in the third, moving the

 

 

 

crowd to a round of hysteria.
Klipple spent some time on the
mat being choked and managed
to get up again late in the period.
This, sadly, was too late, and he
went down on points.

Alter another forfeit, Jim
Weiser, a freshman wresuing
abovehis usual weight class, took
the floor, but was dropped by
Hofstra at 2:06 into the first
period.

After some further defaults,
out comes Washington Alston,
clearly the baddest looking
wrestler of the evening. Although
going the full three rounds, he
never quite got into gear and
seemed unable to follow through
on a number of potentially
dangerous moves. This was far
and away the most exciting bout
of the evening, with the scores
just about evenly matched
through the second period. After
this, Alston seemed to slow down,

Swimmers Top Monmouth;

Final Meet Next Friday

For the last two years before
this, Monmouth has taken the
dual meet with us by winning the
last relay, heating us by one
point. Last June, however, it
Seems that almost the whole
Monmouth swimming team
graduated, the only exception
being David Lloyd, a cocky but
good swimmer (their captain this
year). He swam fairly well, but
he was the only bright spot on
the team. Monmouth won only
the two relays and the
backstroke, Lloyd being in on two
of their three wins.

‘ The meet was almost boringly
victorious (such a new thing tor
Grinnell athletics rendered it
exciting however). “Jolly Rally”
Bruce Rollins’ 200 breaststroke
pleased the crowd immensely, as
he would push off, coming out
of his turns. and not come up
for his first breath until he was
halfway down the pool. Since
Bruce had never swum the breast
stroke in competition, his win

was very impressive. A stroke
behind Bruce, Mike Bye turned
in his best time of the year in
that event. In the 200, Kelly swam
a 1255.0, for a new school and
pool record. Daley swam his
usual great and Mike Burkle did
an excellent job in the last relay,
turning in his fastest time this
season. Done Linke scored his
best ever in the diving, and I
turned in 231.50 points for mine.

No one was really pushed in
this meet, so overall we had a
strong but not tremendous
showing. Today we are at
Lawrence, in Wisconsin, lacing
our toughest competition of the
year. Tomorrow we are up
against Beloit, which shouldn't
pose as much of a threat. Our
only remaining home meet is
next Friday. Olaf will be here,
and it promises to be a good
meet. We have put together a
good team but we need support.
Come watch a winner for a
change.

and he folded on points.

Then followed the final, but
inevitable forfeit, this time of the
heavyweight class. Then it was
all over and they were folding
the chairs and putting the scoring
machine away, Washington
Alston took off his shoes and iay
down for a while on the gym mat
as the crowd trailed off.

This had been a match that
Grinnell could not really lose. We
were expecting an unmitigated

stomp, We could have fulfilled
this expectation, or bettered it,
but in no way could we have done
worse. Of our (our losses two
were on pins, but two got away
on points. More importantly the
team” can now forget about the
Great Upcoming Hoistra Stomp
and work for good individual
records in the Midwest Con-
ference. They escaped a difficult
business with some honor, and
they can go on to some more
reasonalbe com petition.

Grinnell Blades Tie State Icemen;
Hoopslers Split Two Road Games

The Grinnell Hockey Club tied
a previously undefeated and
untied Iowa State team 44 last
Sunday at the Des Moines Ice
Arena. Behind 472 with one
minute remaining in the game,
Grinnell slammed home two
goals within 15 seconds of each
other to earn the tie. The first
was placed on a rush by the
“Zippy Line" with Captain-Coach
Mike Schafler Scoring on a 15 foot
rebound shot. Bruce Graham and
John Omstad earned assists on
the goal. 15 seconds later the
tying goal was scored by Steve
Leighton with an assist by
Schaffer.

Leighton put Grinnell out in
front 1»0 in a breakaway in the
first period. Iowa State then
scored three consecutive goals,
but Graham brought Grinnell to
within one by evading the lowa
State defense to fire a ten foot
slap shot past their goalie.

Although Grinnell was outshot
26-16, goalie Jeff Dick, who is
averaging 29 saves a game,
kicked out 22 shots to preserve
the tie.

Ina game marked by excessive
roughness, a total of 26 minutes
in penalties was awarded. The
third period featured a fight

between Hemmingway of
Grinnell and Scheveny I.S.U.

Returning from a slew of road
games, Grinnell’s basketball
squad stands now at 274 in Mid-
west Conference play and 377
overall. The Pioneers divided 3
pair of games in Wisconsin last
weekend, topping Lawrence so
60, but losing out w a strong
Ripon team 90-73.

Grinnell put in a lesthhanA
superb performance at Law-
rence, although denting the
Vikings badly in the second half
with a strong front line. Behind
32730 at intermission, Grinnell put
in its best shooting display of the
season: Mout 0(54 from the field,
and 20 out of 23 from the line.
Sophomore Bob Burnett came
through with an especially imr
pressive showing, bagging 26
points and Zl) rebounds,

0n the other hand, Ripon out
performed the Pioneers. The
Redmen put on an outstanding
offensive performance in the first
half, hitting 21 of 33 attempts
from the field and building a vir»
tually unassailable 4977.7 lead.

Greg Bombinski led the Grins
nell team with 22 points, his high
for the season, while Burnett and
Hanson claimed 15 and 13 scores
respectively.

Grinnell‘s basketball team
starts a five game home stand
tomorrow night against Cornell.
