S&B Interview: Ike Likes’Rural Undergrad Colleges lke: Preparation for Citizen's Dulles
Will Help Further Nation's Purposes

By Bob Hodieme

Former President Dwight Eisen—
hower was hot and tired as he
rode hack to Grinnell house from
his nn-swat initiation into North
Younker and Cowles halls — but
he was still in high spirits that
had typiiied the first day of his
Visit to Grinnell.

Eisenhower, who looked like he
was having a good time all day,
admitted that he was and that the
primary reason for his enjoyment
was that he ”likes young people.”

The former president only ac-
cepts two honorary degrees every
year saying that “I don’t want to
be greedy and start collecting
them,"

“I try to choose a large college
and a small collegc ever-y year,”
said Eisenhower when asked why
Grinnell was selected as one of

‘ two schools that he would visit this
year.

“When it comes to a choice be-
tween a large university and a
small college I usually go to the
small college," he Said.

“I very much believe under-
graduate work should be done in
rural colleges with graduate work
in the larger cities.”

Eisenhower commented that he
hadn’t felt tired all (lay but that
he became tired during his speech
“It was then," he said, “that I
realized that it was tWD huurs lat-
er than I thought it was. Not only
that, but I got up early today to do
some work in my oiftce” The

liornier president was reieri‘ing to
the time difference between here
and his home in Gettysburg, Pa.

The president was asked it he
iwuilltl ever retire. “I just don’t

no when people ask you to come
to this or that affair and speak—
especially when you’ve been as en-
thusiastic about all this as I have."

lke Turns Down $1,000

Former president Dwight Eisen-
hower was altered and declined a
$1,000 honorarium from the PPPE
for his Visit to Grinnell as politi-
cian in residence yesterday and
today, according to c. Edwin Gil-
mour, director of PPPEt

“Your paramount obligation
is such preparation of yourself
for the discharge of citizenship
responsibilities that you may
play your part in furthering
the nation's purposes,” for-
mer President Dwight Eisen-
hower told an audience of 2,500
Grinnell students and the gen-
eral public last night in Darby
Gymnasium.

decency and patriotism in per

ship," he explained.

Eisenhower said that the
challenges of today are more
difficult than those of yestere
year because of the “almost-
instant communications that
can overnight make any fric<
tiDn abroad into an inter-con-
tinental dispute,” because “a
sharply divided world can
transform each into an ideo-
logical quarrel," and because
“every crisis of international
moment may bear Within itselt
the germ of nuclear War.”

“Remembering that a sense
less enemy could trigger an
assault aimed at annihilation,
we realize that only advanced
preparation can hold [Is to act
sanely and effectively,“ he
said. ”Such advance pi‘eparar

and private citizens alike,

Speaking throughout the ad-
