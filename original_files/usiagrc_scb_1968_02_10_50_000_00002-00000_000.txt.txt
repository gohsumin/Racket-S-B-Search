“Nail’em up if they don’t deliver!”

We can’t Tell You What To Do

A good part of the proposed Constitution passed
by the Senate Sunday night had its origin in the
8&3 offices last semester. The idea of a Student
Ombudsman or Student Co—ordinator was bandied
about by three of the present editors as early as the
beginning of last year.

We warn you that we are vouchsafed to sup-
port the new Constitution, which is to say that the
S&B is inherently biased in favor of the new Com-
mittee of Thirteen idea and the Ombudsman-Stu-
dent Co-ordinator.

But we do point out to the student body that
even the most severe and adamant critics of the
original proposal -— SGA President Ric McDowell
and conservative senator Tom Triplett (North
Younker) — now support the revised version with
few reservations.

A small Senate, committees composed of in-
terested students, a system in which any person can
suggest legislation, and a paid co-ordinator to tie
the whole thing together seems to us a feasible start
towards solving some of the problems that make
‘tihe student government the impotent body it is to-

ay.

The 5&8, however, must be considered a spe-
cial interest group in this matter. We're biased, and
we admit we’re voting for the new proposal.

But we can’t tell you what to do.

That’s Pretty Funny, Rich

The Pterodactyl is a pretty funny newspaper,
and its name is very apropos. In terms of layout and
semblances — be there any —— of journalism, it
really is a prehistoric monster.

The Mesozoic reptile was, after all, pretty ter-
rifying, but it didn’t do much of anything. It stayed
lip in the air, and when it came down to earth it

ied.

We don’t like being stabbed in the back by
Pterodactylic misinformation, dishonesty, shoddy
satire, and puny puns.

The Paper commended us yesterday for “steal-
lng" their "old format." Since when, Mr. Schneirov,
did your format look anything like ours? We never
noticed any classic type, professional cartoons, or
syndicated columns in The Paper.

Mr. Schneirov et 21, you should be the ones
congratulated for stealing something the $81.3 has
had for a long time. At least you’ll be able to read
The Ptei-odactyl this semester without going com-
pletely blind.

But What’s funnier, Rich, is your editor’s note
condescending to print an article on the new Consti-
tution “because the editor of the official student
newspaper of Grinnell College has refused to cover
SGA constitution changes. "

That s pretty funny, Rich.

If you peer into this issue, you might see just
a little bit on the new Constitution. And remember,
please, that we went to press before you did.

Baby, next time you want to criticize try get-
ting your facts straight. And don’t try satire unless
you can hack it, Rich, because it’s obviously not
your bag.

Now we know why you went underground, Mr.
Schneirov. Your paper stinks so badly you had to
bury it.

Smith, Dale Stein and Neil
Fischer, completed the final
draft of the constitution after
three meetings.

They submitted it to the San-
Ile in mid-November.

Only intermittent considera-
lion was given to the consti-
munn- up until January 24m,
when a formal motion was made
to adopt it.

An amendment was offered
by Ray Horn. who wanted to
change the proposed in mem-
ber House Council elected at
large to an is member body,
so that each house would elect
its own president.

Hom’s amendment, which
was the only major proposal to
change the constitution, was
defeated 22 to 10.

Final approval for lhe con-
stitution was given at a special
Senate meeting held on Feb
ruary 4. The vote was 25 to
is with 1 abstention.

Phil Bertenthal, said he feels
the proposed constitution is
quite an improvement over the
present structure of the Stu-
dent Govemmeuf. “Under our
present system," he explained,
“we have 4 people doing most
of the work, 23 people doing
some of the work and 43 people
doing almost none of the wor ."

Before the new constitution
can take effect, it must pass
by a 60 per cent majority in a
student referendum.

The referendum is scheduled
for February 13 from 11:00 a.m.
to 1:00 pm. at Cowles and
Quad.

DEMONSTRATORS
DECRIED

(ACP) — Campus demons
strators who disrupt speeches
and obstnict employment inter-
views are “wholly incompatible
with the basic tenets of a great
university," University of Mich-
igan president Robberl Fleming
told Michigan State University
graduates at fall commence-
ment. the MSU State News re-
ported.

For years, Fleming said, unl-
versities have fought against
restrictions on speakers and on
many campuses the fight has
been won.

“How are we to explain,” he
asked, "that while all kinds of
speakers may come to the
campus, some of them Will be
so disrupted that their views
may not be heard?”

Some argue, and with merit,
Fleming said, that employment
interviews are not an integral
part of campus life and there-
fore should be conducted off
campus.

“Obstructive tactics, how-
ever, are not directed at all in-
terviewirlg but only at selected
interViewing,” he said.

“Others, he said, resolve the
problem by invoking a ‘hlgher
morality’ to determine who
should he allowed to interview.
"The trougle With this concept
is that it is not at all Clear
who is to be in charge of judg:
ing the dictates of a higher
morality," Fleming said.

He said the demonstrators
fail to recognize the nature or
the recruiting process — that a
student who signs up tor an in-
terview does so as an “exer-
cise of individual judgment.”

Perpetual Plaudits
Sir: I wanted to compliment you
and your staff on the first issue
of the 5&1! I have seen since
my return to Grinnell. Com-
pared to the sen produced when
l was a student, yours is in<
ﬁnitely superior, both in for-
mat and coverage.

Boycott Bedevllmeut
Sir: As a member of the campus
Negro community, l would like
lo tell you that your coverage
of and editorial on the boycott
“escapade” was shoddy and
inadequate. There is violence
waiting for me when I go into
the town, and that is neither an
escapade nor a joke. Problems
are not solved by lengthy news
analysis. They are solved by
people who know you have to
fight back.

(name Withheld)

Sir: Your coverage and under-
standing of the boycott incident
was remarkable and commend-
able. I happen to know most
of the boycott planners, and I
can tell you they thought your
articles and editorial were the
best thing that could have been
done under the circumstances.
Your inrdepth analysis of the
siinauon is worthy of any daily
newspaper, and I salute the
58.3 editors and staff.

Allernaling Disapproval
Sir: This is an open letter to
President Leggett and deans
Thompson and Winters in voice
my disapproval with any dorm
change that would break up the
present four-year residence sys-
tem for men. Any advantages
that a change might bring are
not only countered but are out-
weighed hy the advantages or
the present system, which are
only too well exalted in many
College publications to pros-
pective students. I protest that
if is written that Grinnell Col-
lege is to have a free and
democratic society.

I ask you how much of this
free and democratic society is
involved in the administration’s
dictating to North Campus that
a change inusr and Will be
made? You—the administration
—and the Executive Council,
which is mostly made up of
people who won’t have to live
under the new system, have been
working on some sort ni a con-
crete proposal for a new res-
idence system, and while work-
ing on it, you have never asked
us if we want it. Despite this,
you, President Leggett, recent-
ly set up a Board meeting in

February in. im

Arizona to discuss the change.
May I remind you, sir, thal
when the students wanted some-
thing back in September and
October, you put your foot down
and said that while you were
president there would be no inn
crease in open hours in the
dorms and refused to bring it
before the Board.

You really don’t care how,
North Campus feels, but are
telling us what’s good for us.
1 must congratulate you, though
on not bungling :his effort as
badly as others you have made.
By keeping publicity to a min-
imum, the outcry will not be
heard until it’s too late and
then you’ll say "what's done
is done."

And what am I asking you
to do? l'm asking you to prove
me wrong. Show me North
Campus really does want
change. Have a referendum and
see if more than fifty percent
of the classes of ’69, '70, and
'71 on N.C. really want to
change. Ask them to answer to
this. .

dock Piermont ’70 I

I Although we are also in
lhe ranks of those disap-
proving the proposed “alter-
nating dorms” system, we
are not in agleement with
the above Mr. Plennonf, who
has apparently reached a line
conclusion on misinformation
and hot air. Point One: The
Executive Council has nothing
to do with the reorganiza-
lion of the residence hall
system; the Student Affairs
Commillee — which Includes
four representatives from the
sludent government (elected
by Mr. Pienuont and his
peers) —- is the agency re
sponsible.

Point Two: North Campus
Is not the sole guardian of
Grinnell, which is to say Mr.
Pierpont seems to have for-
gotten about lhe freedom of
the daniuns of South Cam-
pus, who will also be affected
by any change. Point three-
The son knows or no special
meeting in Arizona to dis-
cuss the change. ‘

Point Four: What Presi-
deni Leggett said in October
concerned open dorms and
and not a general change in
lhe residence hall system, so
Ihathasnnthinglo do
with the issue at hand. Point
Five: Nothing has been done
yet and when anything is done
President Leggett won’t do
if, students rcpresenring
Nonh and South campuses
on the Student Affairs Com-
mittee will.

Point Six: ML Plermont
hasn‘t presented any of the
advantages of the present
system mentioned in his first
paragraph. Point Seven: The
other things Leggeil may
have bungled have nothing to
do with alternating dorms.
