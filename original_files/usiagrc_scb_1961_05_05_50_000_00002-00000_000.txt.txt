Don’t push the panic button. In spite of reports that
more than thirty students have been let't without hetls after
i'tlttm drawings, Dean Evelyn Gardner reports that plans
are being nizlrle to house everyone.

in spite of the plans, however, there remains, it seems,
a l)2l.lC question which has not been {navel-ed Why are
lhcl‘e going to lie so many people here in the fi ‘t place”!
Apparently the college is either are dmitting contrary
to their belief that a small classroom sitnatittn in 2i small
college atmosphere is conducive toithe bet liintl of learn-
ii or our image is all \t'rong’.

A Student Senate committee is presently inre.
the situation. This paper looks foitvard to the
and some necessary answer.
