FOOTBALLERS FOILED

By JEFF SCHECKTER

Grinnell lost its filth football
game at the season during
Homecoming Weekend. A
capacity crowd withstood the
cold winds to watch the Pio-
neers forge ahead 15-14, only to
lose it all in the fourth quarter,
29-l5.

Once again, the game illus-
trated how the lack of depth
has hurt the team. wiui only
35 men, Coach Bowers is forced
to play men both ways. Despite
the fine physical condition of
the team, it is impossible for
them to play at their peak the
entire game. This results in the
collapse of the defense in the
last quarter and is the direct
cause of at least three Pioneer
losses.

Grinnell opened the scoring
in the first period when Doug
Fink passed to Mike Schwartz
for a 60 yard scoring play.
from Russell kicked the poinia
atter~touchdown and Grinnell
led, 7-D.

Monmouth tied the score late
in the quarter with Tony Por-
ter carrying the ball in from
the six to cap a fourteen play
drive. Larry Motzer kicked the
extra point. Monmouth scored
again in the second quarter,
sending Chuck Corie over from
the two. Motzer's kick was
good and Monmouth led, 141

Grinnell ended the first half
scoring with Brian Barnes run-
ning the ball into the end zone
and Pink passing to Schwartz
to put Grinnell ahead, 15-14.

An exciting halftime program
was presented under the di-
rection of Miss Mary Jones of
the Alumni OfiiCe, After the
Coronation of Cindy Root as
Homecoming Queen, Miss Jones
led the parents in physical ex~

 

 

erciseu requesting the rising of
parents living east of the Mir-
sissippi; parents living west oi
the Mississippi; parents living
in Minnesota who hadn't heard
of the Mississippi; parents who
had students at Grinnell; and
students at Grinnell who were
parents, The only thing mlss«
ing at the show was a prize for
the oldest parent west of the
Mississippi,

Fortunately, the teams re«
turned and put an end to all
such activities The score re-
mained 15~14 throughout the
third quarter and things looked
good {or the Pioneers. This fecl<
ing quickly disappeared in the
fourth quarter as Porter scored
from the two, giving Monmouth
the lead, 20-15.

Four plays later, Doug Fink
was dropped in his own end
zone for a safety, making the
score 2214. The final score of
the game came on a John
Schroeder run and a Motzer
FA]: The game ended with the
score, Monmouth 29, Grinnell
15.

(It is interesting to note that
while the officials are Very well
versed in the football rulebook,
it is obviously not this years
At least three times in the sec-
ond half, the coach of the Scots
could be seen on the playing
lield. This is a 15 yard penalty
and yet it was completely ig-
nored by the oificials. The
striped gods also chose to over
look the rule that only eligible
receivers an the offensive team
are permitted downlield before
a ball is punted. Had these in-
fractions been observed by the
otllmals and the proper penala
ties administered, there is no
doubt that it would have been
a different ball game.)

SHOEMAKERS' HOLIDAY REVIEW

By JOHN WILES

In the Prologue to Thomas
Dekker's comedy The Shoe-
makers’ Hollday, a spokesman
for the cast entreats the audi-
ence for “one gracious smile,‘
hoping to stave off the possible
“bitter storms of your dislike."
in response to the cast and
crew who recently staged The
Shoemakers’ Holiday for Grin-
nell Convocation audiences, one
must certainly “send . 4 _.
life," and not “sentence . . . to
death” this production or the
timeweathcred play.

The cast. and Director For-
ter Woods, seemed to have
taken as their orientation Dek—
ker's own preface, in which he
describes his work as “a merry-
conceited comedy,” for which
"nothing is purposed but
mirth." The play was indeed
performed very broadly, as a
production which finds its pri-
mary reinforcement in the
laughter of its audience.

Max Helfgott was amusing as
a harmlessly self- appreciative
shoemaker, although he seemed
less than accurate in portray-
ing Simon Eyre only as a fum-
bling antic. Heltgott convinc-
ingly played that part of Eyre
to which his own remark
“Prince am 1 none" applies,
but apparently chose to ignore
the latter half of Eyre's famous
assertion — ”yet am lprinccly
born" — as being the hint it is
to more dignified and com-
manding facets of simon Eyre's
character.

Libby Pannwitt, on the other
hand, pumped far too much
intelligence into a part which
calls more simply for a dense,
nagging, scattermraincd old
helpmate. Much of Dame Mar-
gery's colorful bluntness seem-
ed underdeveloped; shrew is
she none, yet could she more
shrewishly have been borne,

Ken Hicks made a line, dash-

Hicks seemed to abandon any
link between the two roles.
Without doubt, Hicks is capable
of superb comic antics, but it
must be remembered that
Lacy's motivation for disguise
is merely temporary conceal-
ment, not to try his hand at
playing the giddiest fool in Lon
don '

Dennis Wilson and Robert ing-
ham made an unbalanced team
as Eyre’s employees, Hodge and
Firk. Wilson was uneasy with
the Elizabethan language of his
part, and needed some invent-
iveness in order to have proj-
ected a stronger. more polished
performance.

lngharn, alas, was to be
found at the other extreme of
lively inventiveness. A polished,
superbly c o mic performance
was given, but much too much
liberty was taken with the role
of Kirk.

Firk is a character who is
funny primarily because he
himself does not realize that he
is; it is not a sophisticated, all-
knowing wit who addresses
Lacy as “corn-iorant” instead
of “colonel.” While lngham's
perfnmance was entertaining,
it was too nimble and self-com
scious to have been the char-
acter Dekket‘ created.

Fritz Schwaller, as Lincoln,
and Ned Benton, as Dtley, made
for a pair of amusing old fugies,
whose machinations to prevent
the marriage of Rose and Lacy
were funny and in no way really
Villalllous. Had both actors toned
down their stereotyped and ofa
ten strident characterizations,
no doubt they would have
easily stolen the entire show.

Art Knowles did well with the
part of l-lammon, playing him
more as an indiscriminate sult~

or with an uncontrollable libido
than as a true menace who
might have seriously soured the
spirited lightness of his scenes
with Rose and Jane

Both Rose and Jane were quite
well played. Ricki Ravitts sup-
pressed an occasional temptation
to satirically overplay Rose's
sweetness, and kept her from,
becoming ludicrous as an over-
bearing saccarine stereotype.

Stephanie Lewis gave a fine
performance as Jane, especially
in her first scene as the whim-
pering, exceedingly weepy bride
whose husband is about to b!
drafted.

Bill Saylor was ill at ease
as Rafe, a role which offers
very little comic potential. and
which must be played as a sup
porting romantic hero. sayloi-
projected little romantically,
and failed to complement Miss
Lewis' romantic devotion 8:
Jane.

Debbie Abbott tackled the part
of Sybil, Rose‘s maid, with good '
bawdy sauciness, and despite a
lack of convincing earthiness,
was essentially capable in thin
supporting role.

Patty Loeb was delightful us
the near-omnipresent Boy, who
was smoothly almost non-played,
was smoothly almost non-
played,

Murry Nelson was perhaps
the most lamentably poor in his
characterization of the King.
Nelson proved woefully weak
in the role which supplies tho
play with what is needed for a
successful comic conclusion: a
strong, authoritative f i g u r e
whose presence Will ensure that
every loose strand of the play’s
rambling plot be drawn togeth-
er finally in a harmonious
happy ending.
