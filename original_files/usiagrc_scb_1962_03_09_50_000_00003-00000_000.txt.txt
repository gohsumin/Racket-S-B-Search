Finding oulsell' as no more ens

lightened than be ioic the coitcc
houi ior the candidates ioi AWS
Board president, we want to
question seriously the view
South campus as whole ape
pareiitly sanctions as regards
AVVS elections.

a

The discussion centered chict—
ly around the duties and fuller
tions oi, and qualifications tor,
the oitice. This might have been
informative, due to certain am.
biguities iii the new consitiitioii;
hopctully, a little controversy
could have been aroused. How
ever, all that resulted were the
usual meaningless platitudes.

We want to emphasize that we
do not mean to cast any as
persions on the candidates in-
d idually, or on the moderator
who so successtully stirlcd the
airing oi specific issues and the

delineation of views. The Collect

hour was merely run in the tra
ditional manner, without cone
sidcration tor the
mands of the position

It is naive to suppose that the

AWS Board, although an execu—z

tive body, does not have a great
influence on legislative matters,
especially in connection with
wonien’s house rules. The board
by the mere fact that ll 15' in El
position to bring issues to the
sore and sound out opinion. oi
to softrpedal them, undeniably
is able to wield a substantial as
mount oi power.

it is essential that in the sel
ection‘of the Aws Board the
problems
the drinking rule and other inat
tors of south campus lite
openly'and frankly dealt with.
The board is designated to be
an extension ot the will oi the
women students; its representa—
tite function must he emphasiz—
ed and voters should be cogniz—

ant of the candidates’ views and]

proposals for new legislation.

We strongly urge that the .
lection pioceduie be revised in
light at the broad iunctioning
oi the beard Ceitainly. wha
iic' aie advocating could be ca
iied to extremes We in no way
envision girls running on the,
Prohibition or Pantyrl‘aids-and-
Parties tickets. it is too late to
handle the election of the pro —
ident in a responsible mannei;
however, we hope and urge
candidates tor house presidency
to take detinite stands and we
encourage women students
demand such definitive slates
