Encampment is here. Soon encampment will be
gone. Perhaps a few of us lucky enough to attend in per-
son will retain a few precious memories of what goes on
there. But, hopefully, and only hopefully, more will

me of this encampment than just a few memories.
opefully, this encampment will serve as the germinal

event it was meant to her

In order for such a happy turn of events to occur, a
genuine effort must be made by the participants in the
encampment to arrive at some concrete, printable ideas,
ideas which can serve as a jumping off point in the
struggle to define the “Grinnell Idea."

These ideas must be more than just a few dry pages
of post office throwaway. A way must be found to pre-
serve the vitality of the encampment experience and
bring it back home to the “troops.”

lf this way is not found, encampment will remain the
irrelevant activity it has so far been — irrelevant in the
sense that the 1140 students and 100 faculty who aren’t
there never benefit froin it—irrelevant in the sense that it
smacks of the “splendid rhetoric” about which President

Leggett has warned us.

And when the task of making encampment relevant
begins to bog down amidst the apparent apathy of those
who stay home, we cannot throw up our hands and cry
defeat. The battle must be pressed or the Grinnell Idea
Isn’t worth the trouble and expense of going to Boone in

the first place.

S&B Goals

To the Editor: The live or us
who prepared last week’s article
on our LeMoyne experience
would like to clarify some edi<
tonal errors and protest the
manner in which the Sari!
Sta.“ handled the article.

We realize that newspaper
articles seldom appear in print
exactly as written because the
mechanics ol journalism re-
quire some cutting and reword-
ing, But no editor should a)
insert things not included by the
authors, b) carelessly change
"wording” in such a way as to
render the author’s statements
incorrect or insulting. and c)
sublieadline the article With a
halfrtruth which will be seen
by many people who do not
read the entire article.

Although there are other er-
rors or lesser importance we
would like to straighten our two
in particular, for the beneﬁt
of Grinnell r e a d e r s and
iriends who may read the ar-
ticle. First, the exchange
teacher in the picture was from
the university or lowa, not
Southern Illinois University.
Second, the word “squalor" in
column two was definitely not
included in the original article

It “squalor" was observed
by membels of the SH? staff,
who we realize have also par»
ticipated in the LeMoyne pro-
gram, this and any other ob-

servation should be presented
in another article under their
own names—J. Poland, A. Rosr
man, P. Stern, L. Thnman, and

Proiect Penelrates

To the Editor: In an age dom-
lnated by electrically Operated
devices, it seems only natural
that contemporary artistic cul-
ture should also experience
some degree of electrification.
Electric motors and lights have
unquestionably added the di-
mension of temporality to ma-
dcrn painting and sculpture.
Music, too, has thrived on elec-
tricity. Not only have radios and
phonographs inadc music gcn»
erally available, but musicians
have successfully employed
amplifiers and tape recorders lo
produce sounds, the likes of
which could never be made
without electrical assistance.

Milton Babbitt of Princeton
University has expressed the no-
tion that electronic music has
extended the bounds of music
writing. Whereas in the past,
composers were limited by the
physical capabilities of the per
farmers, the limits of electronic
music lie in the ability of the
human ear to pErceive.

At their recent concert in
Darby Gymnasium a group of
gay young men known as the
Blues project demonstrated that
Professor Babbitt had not been
entirely accurate, The sounds
produced electrically by this
group bypassed the listener's
our and penetrlted the Very
bowels of the man. whereupon
they turned his stomach. — D.

Tip Your Waitress?

Much as I hate to admit it,
the power or the press — at
least on the Grinnell campus -
is conﬁned to critical sugges-
tions. And irom there it is
generally up to the student
body of readers to take action
of one kind or another.

The 5&3 has in the past
proliererl a host at sugges-
tions for various improve-
ments on campus but all too
often what takes place is an
uniortunaie syndrome some-
thing like this: When editor-
ials are of a critical, some-
times even sarcastic nature,
we are applauded. “Did you
mad what the paper said a-
bout Saga? The 58.3 really
ripped it apart."

“Yeah,” says your friend,
“and I really do think Saga
workers should get more mon-
ey'n

But when criticism is of a
positive kind, interest all but
expires before the altar of ap-

Ed. mm The following
essay is the first installment
of what is hoped to be a cori-
linuing series in the 5&3. The
5&8 welcomes responsible ex-
pressions of opinion from
members at the student body
in the form of short (400-501)
words) essays of this type.
Subject matter is unimportant
as long as the subject is
somehow relevant to Student
life. Any student wishing to
submit such an essay should
ﬁrst query the editor of the
5&3.

By STEPHEN SHENDER
Perhaps one or the most
tragic outcomes of Mr. John-
son’s consensus — ridden “Great
Society” is the nearly total ab-
sence of serious discussion on
the ’66 Election‘s most crucial
issue —— the war in Viet Nam.
With only a low exceptions _-
Hatfield in Oregon being the
most outstanding — the Viet
Nam issue has been silenced
in electoral compaiyls throng
out the country. it there is i
deed is substantial portion of
the electorate opposed to our
Vietnamese policy, it appears
that it will have little chance
to express itself in November.

The candidacy of Urban-
thlc High School science
teacher Charles Day for the
[1.5. Senate is one 0! the few
exception to an otherwise
gloomy political picture. Mr.
Day is winning squarely on
a peace ticket, and his pre-
sence in the election gives
Iowa voters, at least, a real
opportunity to express lhem-
selves on Viet Nam. Unfor-
tunately, Mr. Day‘s pros-
pects tor subsmntiai success
are about as depl'essin" as
the political context in which
he finds hinis’elfr Mr. Day
himself freely admits tl "t his
chances- or being ciccm c
ahout one hundred to one.”
ll this amblllous electoral ei-

athetic languor. This time I
have some constructive criti<
cism, and I’m hoping you will
take the appropriate positive ac-
tion.

Each of your Saga wait.
resses and busboys has no
wait on an average of live
tables at sitdown dinner, and
oven so the service -— if
nothing else — is usually
pretty liiir. And tor their
trouble or veritably whizziiig
back and forth between five
tabla, these hardy souls are
-— as previously noted — paid
the fantastic sum of eighty«
eight cents.

Two Ihings are obvious about
this situation. The ﬁrst, point<
ed out in our September 16
issue, is that it is insuiierahle.
The second, obvious to all who
luave ever tried to fight the
mess at city hall or the ex-
isting administrative order, is
that Saga is not going to do
anything about it.

Guest Column

So id like you to do
something about it: Tip your
waitress. it each at the pa:
sons at sitdown dinner would
tip his waitress in nickle, the
Wages or these suttcring Saga
servants would be more than
doubled. Now I doubt it you
would even notice that nick-
1e, but — as sure as Saga
Chuck smiles a lot —- your
waitress and hushoy will no-
tice its
we might as well tip as we
do in a real restaurant where
real Waitresses serve real food.
A good nile tor tipping, I am
told, is fifteen per .it at the
total value ot the meal.
While I realize that a nick-
ie is u good deal more than
fifteen perc-t in this case,
I hope that you will have the
pathos to leave a tip at sit-
down tonight. rd like to see
you make this tipping a
tradition. I’d like to see you
lake 3 little action.

ay's Daylight

fort falls to bear any real
imit, it will not be as much
due to weaknesses in the can-
didate’s image and delivery
(and indeed these are numer-
ous — Mr. Day is bookish,
quiet, occasionally given to
glaring grammatical errors,
and about as inspiring a speak-
el' as President Johnson him-
self) as it will be due to weak-
nesses in the candidate’s pock-
et book. While there may be
many voters ill Iowa who
would gladly vole for just a-
bout anybody who is willing to
take a stand in opposition to
the war, Mr. Day’s resources
are so severely limited that it
seems unlikely Lhat he will be
able to reach most of them.
His organization, Peace In-
dependents, just does nut have
the capital needed to [mid the
kind of media » saturation Cam-
paign required to overcome
the large leads held by wellr
founded and well»publlcized
Democratic and Republican can-
didates. Thus, it is not unlikely
that in the final tallies this

November, Mr. Day’s voles
Will be only an un atement
or his potential support. Mr,
Day and his backess are well
aware of this, and console
themselves with the statement
that they are “building for ’68"
~ but for what? A lot can hap-
pen ln two years, and at the
rate we are escalating, one
wonders if it will be possible
for anyone to advocate peace
the next time around. The iS-
sue (7i Viet Nam isvhere and
now — not on in some cloudy
electoral future. V

It IS hard not to admire Mr...
Day — as outwardly unimpres-
Sive as he is — for he is a
man who is Willing to take his
convictions serimsly and hear
a greater than average amount
of personal sacriﬁce to carry
these convictions to the public.
AS an out - of - state voter one
can only stand on the sidelines
and Wish him well, for he is,
in his own small way, serving
more than the voters of Iowa—
he is serving the electorate oi
the nation.
