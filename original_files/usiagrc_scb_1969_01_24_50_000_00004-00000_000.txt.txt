Once ugein the varsity baketbatl
team is well on its way to a losing sea—
son. They have already lost Ill lugiu
games. The margin was close in the
Monmouth, Beloit, CDC, Carleton Ind
Cornell gates, but constant turnovers
arid a week deterise led to close losses.
St. Olal, who Coach John Plluch call:
the clue of the canietonco, literally
deltmyed our losing five. Unless they
begin getting some clutch performances
it look! llkc I-plthetlc season tor Lilo
Pioneers.

Coach Pfitsch will be on leave in
Portugal second semester.

their practices was the glaring rant that
chances for victory in the three meets
scheduled were extremely srriall.

In every wrestling meet there are
eleven weight divisions, two or which
are optionally entered. In every meet
the team automatically forfeited Tour of
the matches, which almost completely
destroyed all chances for victory.

And yet they gamely practiced on.
