Rules Changes

In the short months of its exis—
tence the new AWS Board has made
lome notable strides toward bring-
Ing a degree of reality to the an-
cient code of rules which protect
and smother Grinnell womanhood.
The recent Quad dress rule change
and the new grace minutes program
pro certainly constructive steps in
the right direction. But they are on-
ly short steps, and there is much
which must yet be done before
rules will reflect reality.

It seems, however, that some-
thing else must come before the
rules themselves can be changed.
Further rule changes, if they are
to be of any value, must be major
ones, so major that they require
a new and more vital conception
of what Grinnell is and ought to be.
In short, Grinnell life must begin
to reflect the kind of maturity

which the rule changes will re-
quire.

To a large degree this maturity
is already present. What it requires
is simply a good public relations
effort to bring it into focus and a
good theoretical study to provide
in writing the rationale which al-
ready exists in mind and action for
many of us. But while maturity is
evident there are still too many
pockets of irresponsibility on both
campuses. There is still too much
of what one administration official
has called the "damn foolishness”
of prepping, There is still too much
condoning of objectionable drunk-
oneas and obscenity.

It is up to those who claim ma-
lurity to see that such symptoms of
childishness are curbed. When this
is done the rules situation can more
easily be liberalized.

I Am A Prisoner 0f Saga

Edit. note: The following plea was
discovered by an intrepid 5&3 cub re-
pnrler in his cake at lunch Tuesday.
it is here reprinled in the public iu<
terest.

Woe is mel

My story -— unbelievable as it may
seem —- must reach the outside world
somehow. Others must not he entrapped
into my heinous predicament of terror.
And you. dear reader. may even be able
to reform the editing horror before my
time is gone.

I am a sophomore at Grlmell; that is
to say, I would have been a whoa-om
lhlsyeuillhadmendedmydlsses
inst yen. But I couldn‘t go In class; I
had no time.

I had no time to lure girls into my
room. . .

I had no time in take my swimming
test. . . .

I had no time to polish the eagle. . . .

i had no time to wait for the Cafe dei
Faro to really open for business. . .

I hardly had time to eat the food I am
omnipresently supposed to cook. . . .

It all started when I was a small child.
I was reared on Horatio Alger books.
They told me to make snmcihlng of my-
self, to he industrious, to eam my own
way. My parents lolcl me to make some-
thing of myself, in be industrious, and to
earn my own way through school. FinaI<
ly, when the financial aid office told me
to make something of myself, in be in-
dustrious, and in earn my way through
college, I decided to make something of
myself, to be industrious, and to earn my
way through Grlunell.

Yet little did I realize the Scylleharb-
dian choice that my decision to put my-
self through school represented. it was
only after already signing my contract
with Saga that I discovered the mini-

mum wage on campus to be only eighty-
eight (83!) cents. It was then that I first
realized to my extreme dismay that to
finance my Grinnell education, I would
have to work 3,000 hours each of my
academic years at the college.

My first year at Grimell, I was on
campus 210 days. In order to finance my
31800 tuition, food, etc. in addition to m ,
travel expenses, nooks, and clothes,
found myself Working in Comes all hours
a dayl l was allowed to sleep four
hours a day (except at Christmas when
I found it Wary to Iork additional
hours to purchase presents).

I had no time for anyming else. . . .

1 must digress tor a moment to say
that one day — when ﬁzwles was closed
for its traditional onceevery-threeyeal
cleaning — I was able to visit my first
classes here. It was in February, I think.
about the time the debate club kids were
heading South for Mardi Gzas. I sat in
on Economics 217; there I learned that
the minimum wage in the United States
was approaching $1.60. I remember won<
dering why our campus was no longer
considered a part of the United States.

Later I attended History 226. There I
learned that the Southerners had coun-
tered Abolitionist propaganda during the
Civil War by implying that Northern
workers were veritable wage slaves. I
remember wondering if maybe the
Southerners were right sometimes. It
might be added that i‘m not wondering
any more.

Such is my tale of woe. I write it while
locked in the Cowles kitchen for my four.
hour night. Somehow I will try to
smuggle ‘ out to the world of the free
and the livlng. i need help, and my fel-
low sufferers in the Quad, the Library
and the Desk in the Forum Lobby must
he saved.

previous issues of the 5&3 re-
ﬂected the concern of the edi-
tors for glvlng due publicny to
areas in which Grlnnell students
are actively conoerned with the
problems of contemporary so-
ciety.

The editors saw the Des
Moines project as an honest at-
tempt by a relatively large
group nf Grinnell students (at
least fifty at one point) acling
on their own initiative to coin-
bat the problems of poverty in
Des Muluea Last week's riot by
some 390 Negro teenageis in
Des Moines certainly seems to
substantiate the opinion that
the problems were and are very
real ones.

No attempt was ever made n
the part of the project puri
pants Io hide information about
the project (several coffee hours
were held at which students
were invited to ask questions).
The son was certainly uni con-
cerned wllh hiding information.
The particular questions which
Miss Hughes and Miss Baker
ask about the end or the project
were largely answered in the
April 15, I966 issue of the 58:3.
The 5823 was aware of Mr.
King’s background as an 5135
organizer in Newark, New Jer-
sey, before he came to Des
Moines. The 5&3 was also
aware of and reported on Mr.
King’s plans to return to New
York last spring [0 lake up com-
munity service work there.

The 5&1! will continue to ful-
ﬁll its responsibility to report
events related to the student
body.

To the Editnrl

The “Invalid Generalizations"
column by PRJ in the last sea
issue was aptly entitled. Fresha
men may indeed be uneducat-
cd, but certainly no more so,
proportionately, than the upper-
classmen who surround ibem.

As a freshman, I find myself
in the unlnlellectual position of
beginning a liberal education
alier leaving a iall'ly unllberzll
high school The seuiurs around
me do not seem to be loo lib-
erally endowed Wltlt anything
more inlelleciual than pride in
their own potency.

The fact that ihe pic-1970
classes were very probably
characterized by bearded girls
and frustrated boys m as op-
posed to file bearded boys and
iweniyfoul- year old girls la-
beled by PRJ as members of
my class —— does not seem an
issue to merit so mllch resent-
merit. What makes PR1 think
that college mores will change
so much in the next four years
after remaining lalrly constant,
although not so laudy, for the
past thirty?

The North Campus problem
was here before we arrived, and
the Cowles prepping that went
on last Sunday at 4 a.m., and
other incidents of last weekend
(such as the breaking of East
Norris‘ Window) seem to indi-
cate upperclassmen really don‘t
give much of a damn what sort
of reputation the college re-
ceives.

The class of 1970 may well
end up living in a yellow sub-
marine, but upperclassmen —

if what I’ve seen is any ex-
ample~are already submerged
in their own pride and resent-
ment. — Frustrated Fmsh.

Ed. Note: The foﬂowing is
a letter to the editor found in

a recent issue of the Gal95«
burg all.) Register Mail un-
der the headline "Tail Wags
Dogs”.

To the Editor:

R e c e n t student demonstraa
tions around the country, and
resolutions by siudcm associa-
tions, are demanding that the
law concerning the use of cera
tain drugs and the Selective
Service system be changed.
This leaves me wondering Why
the students think they have
any right whatsoever to demand
that any law be Changed. . .

A sludeni is on the receiving
end all the way, until he, or
she, graduates. The parents, the
tax supported government agenn
cies, ihose who provide scholar-
ships, all give the studem an
opportunity to learn. . . .

Why then do students feel
they can demand what form or
shape (his gift of an education
should be? By their demands,
they are in effect saying to
their parents, and to all who
make their schoollng possible:

“You must feed, clothe, shel-
ter and provide educational
facilities for me. You must not
object to any way I talk, dress
or conduct myself. You must
