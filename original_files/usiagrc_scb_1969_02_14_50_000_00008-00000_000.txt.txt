SENATE CENSURES
ADMiNlSTRATION

Wednesday evening the senators gath
ored corporealiy boiore an audience in
the South Lounge, 3 “substantiva
change" from the past. The major sub-
ject, and the final one of the evening was
the matter at a response to the actions of
the Deans’ Office regarding last week's
demonstration, After considerable de-
bate as to the role of the senate in ques-
tioning “guidelines”, the following mO‘
iron was passed:

“On February 5, l969, a number of
Grinnell College students participated in
a demonstration against Playbay Maga-
zine. Subsequent to that incident, the 0i—
1ice of the Deans of Students sent letters
to the Students participating in the dem-
onstratlon. Copies of this letter hava
been sent to the parents or these stu-
dents. The demonstrators themselves
were not informed of this notification un-
til after it had been effected.

We seriously question the conduct of
the Deans' Otiice in handling the matter.
We believe the action to be discriminah
tory, arbitrary, and contrary to accepted
administrative practice.

The Grlnnlell College Senate there«
fore respectfully requests that the Stu<
dent Faculty Judicial Council consider

the following:

i) The action at the Dean‘l Oﬂica
. ribed above.

2) The existing college guidelines for
administration-parent contact can-
coming individ a1 students.

3) The possibilities of clariﬁcation
and/oi- extension at these guide-
lines.”

A second motion, also related to the
demonstration was passed unanimously.
Acting under the belief that the Attorney
General's investigation extends beyond
the implications of the February 5th de-
monstration, the senate stated, “. . .As
both the implications and results of such
An investigation are possibly detrimental
to the college, its ideals, and goals, we
not only remind members of the col-
lege community, but encourage them to
exercise their respective privileges to
withhold information from the represen~
tatives of the Attorney General, unless
Iubpoenaed."

veys indicate that female students are
more solidly behlnd the protest than men.

Why are they still mere? one student,

"I voted against the sit-in because

ticlpation is an act against the shin. I
thought, ‘Suppose it was one of my
teachers, that I really dig and found I

have to know Whyl We tried to ﬁnd
out why in Dixon’s case but everyone,
the faculty, the Deans, the president,
all reiused to answer. To be faithful to
my beliefs in education, I had to sit-in.”

The unifying fame of educational ud-
vancement has held the group to<
gether. They tool at this pain: that it
they iert "nothing would be done, it
we stay at least there is hope." It
is unlikely that the protest will end
without definite administrative action.

The student body questions the valid-
ity of thls farm of protest. They fear it
will endanger the University's position.
However. the majority of students and
many faculty sympathize with the ideals.
Ono non-parti pant commented, “it
