Complete Text of President’s
Letter on Financial Problem

To: The Faculty Fromi Glenn Leggett

At their meeting last week in Des Moines the Executive Com-
mittee of the Trustees asked the deans and me to make the follow-
ing kind of statement to the faculty:

The Trustees are proud of the academic reputation of Grinnell
and know that the scholarly promises and accomplishments of its
students are a direct reflection of the competence and energy of
a superior ieculty. The Trustees are committed to maintaining
such a faculty and they realize that such a commitment involves
a steady improvement of faculty salaries, of research funds and
facilities, of Sabbatical leave arrangements, and other “fringe"
benefits. The Trustees are aware that the general physical and
emotional environment in which faculty work and live is crucial
to recruiting and keeping a productiva faculty.

At the same time, the Trustees wish the faculty to be especial-
ly cognizant that the immediate future poses the same great
financial problems for Grinnell as it does for all institutions
of higher education. Costs in salaries and Wages, in financial
aids ior students, in construction and remodeling, in Stu-
dent aud administrative services are rising much more rapidly
than revenues. A depressed market, anxiety about the outcome
of proposed tax legislation affecting foundations and charitable
gilts, and yet the continuing general inflationary trend all con-
tribute and will probably continue to contribute to the increasing
difference between projected income and projected expenditures.

The Trustees are concerned, not alarmed. The endowment
portfolio or the college has been steadily increasing in value over
the past few years, and it IS quite probable, assuming the same
rate of growth, that at some time in the future earnings riot-n en-
dowment will play a greater share than they do now in helping
to bring projected income and expenditures closer together. At
this moment, however, and in the near future, earnings from en-
dowment do not provide sufficient funds to ease substantially the
amount of gifts required each year to balance the operating bud—
get. The giti requirements each year. accordingly, have steadily
increased; and, though the college has been more successiul than
almost any of its competitors in securing gifts, the gap between
required and realized gift income is increasing too iast.

Accordingly, the Trustees wish to request the faculty to give
careful consideration to the following possible ways of alleviating
the financial problem:

(1) Increasing the faculty-student ratio by a reduction
in tacuity numbers.

(2) increasing enrollment without increasing the num-
ber of faculty.

(3) Increasing the proportion of fund! which student-
