Haas Defines Role as All Encompassing

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Chaplain Dennis l-Iaas sees
his role at Grinnell primarily
in terms of a “ministry to the
college community." He defines
such a ministry as “availability
and readiness to assist in all
areas of student life.”

The three major areas in
which Mr. Haas will be involved
are religious activities, teach-
ing, and counseling. In all these
areas, and' especially the latter,
Mr. Haas will acquaint himself
with the needs of the Students in
order to better plan programs
and not effectively on campus.
He is looking forward to creat-
ing new programs to supple-
ment the ones now in operation.
While he hopes to maintain
many of the present programs,
such as those carried on by the
Board of Religion, he would like

to see if student interest suffi-
ciently justiﬁes their existence.
Mr. Haas hopes to become ac-
quainted with the needs of the
Catholic and Jewish students on
campus. He feels that ideally
there should be a priest and a
rabbi more available to work
out personal problems that he
might not be able to handle.
In answer to a question about
the religious activities on cam-
pus being Protestantroriented,
Mr. Haas replied that lt had
been suggested to him to make
chapel services more universal.
He feels, however, that a serv-

ice general enough to make no
religious distinctions, but that
would be rather a prayer ses-
sion, would be so watered down
as to be of no use to anyone.
He would like to see non-Protes-
tant programs if student inter-
est warrants them. In particu-
lar, there is a possibility of
holding occasional Jewish Sah-
bath services in the chapel,

'Aufonomy for Councils':
New North Campus Adviser

In an effort to improve the North Campus society, academically
and socially, two new resident advisers have been added to the
men's hall structure. They join Terry Moore and Gene Kowert who
are beginning their second year as advisers.

Dave Johnson, adviser for North and South Younker and Smith,

in addition will work as an as-
Slstant in the history depart-
ment. Johnson is currently
studying for his PhD. in history
at the University of Minnesota
and has taken a year off for
reading.

Although it is still quite early
in the academic year, Johnson
already has some thoughts about
the resident advisrr program
and Grinnell society. He felt
that the motive behind the resin
dential advisor system has not
been “clearly articulated by the
admlnistration” thus bringing
about a certain amount of dis-
trust for the advisor among the
students. As far as disciplinary
action Johnson said the Dorm
Councils should have complete
autonomy in this area but that
he might aid in the enloroe-
ment of quiet hours.

“I expected a closed society
at Griiinell, and I was not dis-
appointed," Johnson continued.
“Upperclassmen have the notion
that Grinnell is the centersofa
the~universe and does not need
improvement." He cited the
fact that some of the classes
at Grinnell are as large as lini-
versity classes and emphasized
the selfrconsciousness of stu»
dents towards their college as
unique.

Paul Thurston, advisor for
Clark and Dibble, is also a full-
time student this year. Because
Thurston worked last semester
on a sociology project at Costa
Rica, he had to return to com»
plete his graduation require-
ments. In addition he will assist
in coaching Freshmen football,

Along with eleven other stu-
dents from colleges in the Mine
west Conference, Thurston
studied the problems of Costa
Tivo Grinnell students

with him were Nancy Moritz
on a sociology project and
Chuck Schnell doing work in
biology. Thurston concentrated
on the poverty in the capital
San Jose, interviewing seventy-
five iamilies and discussing
their problems and the urban
migration with them. Although
he was only there six months,
he thought that he had acquired
very valuable field experience.

Wall Speaks of Communiias

The first convocation of the school year drew only minimal
student attendance last Monday evening.

Because of the importance of the two addresses delivered at
the convocation the editors have reprinted below substantial axe
Oerpts from Dr. Wall’s and the complete text of President Leggett‘s.
The 5&B extends a special invitation for responsible student comr
ment on these addresses. Deliver signed responses (typewritten.

Th. Double Nature oi Renewal
Or How to be Good to tho World

Glenn legqett

Students. Faculty, Friends of
the College: As you students,
for whom this convocation is
chielly designed, know better
than any of the rest of us, 1966
is a very difficult time to be a
young person. The world not
only appears to be in worse
state than usual: its older in-
habitants, who are at least part-
ly to blame tor the sorry state
of affairs and thus might wel-
come the dignity oi their own
silence, are likely to be rather
noisy about what they call the
frightful lack of proper ances-
tral piety in the young. it is a
remarkable irony, bearable to
all of us only I suspect because
of the natural affection of
fathers and mothers for their
children and, what is perhaps
more important, because of the
patient attempt at understand-
ing that most of the young bring
to the old.

One hardly needs to offer much
documentation about the condi-

tion of the world. Anyone who
feels and thinks and worries
about his neighbors and him-
self has available all sorts of
evidence about the prevalence or
violence and brutality and o:
the catastrophes brought on by
hypocrisy and hate. The sins
of fathers are certainly being
visited upon their sons, not only
specifically in the tragedy or
racial conflict but also genera
ally in the whole tone of society.
The costs of inhumanity and
vulgarity have been steadily
rising, and even in the short
time between the start of dais
school year and the end at the

Communitos
Joseph Well

It is of this college cone
munity, or communitas, as
Paul and Percival Goodman
use the term in the sense of
the planned and puiposeiul com-
munity, as seen from at least
one faculty member's vantage
point that I should like to
speak this evening. Many of
you who either were at the col-
lege last spring or have had
the opportunity to read his
speech, Will immediately recog-
nize that this theme of com
munity was central to Fresh
dent Leggett’s inaugural ad-
dress. It would seem to me use-
ful to address the large con-
cerns for academic communi-
ty, as expressed by President
Leggett, to the specific prob-
lems which we face in this par<
ticular college.

There are many, of course,
who would tell us that the task
we face is both impossible and
futile. Like the late middle ages
or the early romantic period,
our society seems to be pre-
occupied with the idea of death.
But whereas the lath century
man, with his drawings of grin-
ning skeletons engaged in the
danse macabre, was obsessed
with individual mortality, and
the early 19th century man was
fascinated with the death of
abstract ideas, we seem to lay
emphasis upon the death of
institutions. And second only in
journalistic coverage to the
death or God, which having
made the cover of Time maga-
