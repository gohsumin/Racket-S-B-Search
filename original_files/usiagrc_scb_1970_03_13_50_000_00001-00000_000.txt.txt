Broomer, Thomas Cop AWS,

By GREG BUTCHER

The Grinnell political scene has
returned to normal. After an
astoundingly largeivoter turnout
in last week’s presidential elec-
tion (prompted apparently by the
sore editorial urging a boycott
of the election), this week only
526 students bothered to vote for
:he Council of House Presidents
and the Associated Women Stu-
dents Board presidents.

Bill Thomas was elected presir
dent of the Council of House
Presidents by getting 173 votes
to 93 for Jon Stein and 35 for
Richard Pope. Mary Brooner de-
feated Laurie Levatin, 154 to 71
to become president of the
Associated Women Students.

Grinnell Republican ’Aciion Now’ Models Notional Drive

By PHIL SASlCll
9, On Saturday, March 7, Elly

Peterson, the originator of the
Republican Party’s “Action
‘Now” program, led a task force

a of Republican leaders to Iowa,
Their purpose: to implement a
pilot “Action Now" program
among lowa College Repubr
licans.

Collcgc Republican leaders
irom across the state particir
pated in a series oi panel diSr
cussions about general problems
that “Action Now” hopes to
confront.

Special guests included Senator
Jack Miller-iRep) of lowa who
spoke on “The Environmental
Crisis.” Miller cautioned citizens

to “guard against blind haste in
buying solutions to the many and
very complex aspects oi the
environment." This ratllcr inc
iiocuous toiic characterized the
whole oi his speech

Vigorous exchange developed
iii the panci on the black man's
perspective. when those con.
scrvative Iowa College Ro-
piiblicans challenged Jack Crow.
iord, Special assistant to the
chairman oi the Republican Na-
lional Committee, Wille Newbit
of Clarinda College, and Russ
Macgregor oi Grinnell on the
racial issue.

The Republican National Com.
mittcc is watching this pilot pro-
gram with great interest. be

cause. ii if is successful. similar
programs will be established in
other slates.

Gold Bond

Just a reminder that the Gold
Bond Stamp Drive sponsored by
the Student Recreation Com»
mission will get into iull swing
iollowing Spring Break. The aim
is a bus which will serve the
transportation needs of the entire
campus community. So, every-
one, please remember while you
are athome to tap your families’,

friends', and relatives supplies
of Gold Bond stamps and coupons

from Raleigh and BelAire

cigarettes.

Interviewed after the election,
Bill Thomas listed some of the
projects he has been working on
and which he will continue to
work on as C. of HP. president.
They include: (1) establishment
of a student»run Crisis clinic for
both drug and emotional prob.
lems; (2) change in the coun-
seling service; (3) dorms that are
fully coed; (4) better organiza-
tion ior payment at hall debts;
and (5) better managementof the
TV fund.

In addition, Thomas said, “I’d
like to see hall presidents take
a more creative role in the
changes on social affairs. C. of
l-I.P. is the one group with cone
tacts all over campus. it is in
touch with people of all lifestyles;
therefore, it can come up with
programs which have the most
widespread support. It hasn’t
taken advantage of this at all this
year."

As for counseling, Thomas had
the following to say: “I mink the
student adviser system should be
retained, although the training
program for S.A.’S could be
improved. I think much more
consideration should be given to
student opinion in the hiring of
R.A.’s and their superiors. An
academic adviser should be
assigned to the same group of
students as a student adviser
because some academic coun:
selling must be done by students
A good thing might be to have
a professor affiliated with each
dorm

0n dorm life; “I’m going to
work for home rule for the dormir
tories. Each hall should consist
of a group of students who rent
that hall from the college.” 0n
Grinnell in general: “In 1964,
Grinnell was a leader not only
in the Midwest but across the
country in social policy. Today.
supposedly more conservative
colleges are moving ahead or us.
The studcnts here are generally
complacent about their living
situation.” _

Mary Brooncr was more
reserved in her interview, but she
advocated that the A.W.S. and

'c of HP. be given more power

in the arca oi social regulations.
“The Senate has too many comr
mittees, and many of the mem-
’iers of this year’s A,W,S. Board
iell frustrated because they
have no power."

In her campaign statement,
she said: “Resources for both
proiessional and personal ad-
vismg arc. at most, minimal and

do not meet the needs of Women
students. The A.W.S. Board

should make it its business to
investigate this area of advising
and to ‘make strong recom-
mendations to the College where
necessary. Further demands also
need to be made concerning the
health needs of Grinnell women.”
