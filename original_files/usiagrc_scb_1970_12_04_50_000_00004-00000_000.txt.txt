Rip-offs On The Rise;
Can Attitudes Change?

The incidence of theft on the
Grinnell College campus has
been extremely widespread
this semester. The problem
has been especially evident in
the past month and should be
discussed and solved. Stolen
items range from substantial
sums of cash and books from
the bookstore and library to
various other goods such as
the keys to the newly insmlled
Coke machines, foodfromhall
refrigerators, and records.
Something is vastly wrong
when students cannot trust

The 88th notes with sure
prise and pleasure the vote
of the Senate Wednesday
eliminating funds for the
Supersonic Transport
(SST), one of the most in-
credible boondoggles tobe
proposed in recent years.

The extent of the opposie
tion to SST is underscored
by the concurrence of
Iowa's senators - Republi»
can Jack Miller and Demo
crat Harold Hughes. Is the
anti-ABM vote next?

 

their peers. Using locks on
all the doors and constantly
guarding one‘s personal bee
longings are not anybody's
conception of what a college
atmosphere should promote.

What can be done? Students
should act responsibly enough
toward one another so as to
prevent thievery. When thefts
occur, they should be report-
ed to the Dean of Students
and the Grinnell Police Sta-
tion. These agencies will try
to help victimized students
recover stolen items. If such
action is taken, the people on
campus who are not respect-
ing others' property will prof
1'23ny either be found or sca-
red away from ﬁxture stealing.
The long- range problem will
be solved witha change of at
titude by the students u a new
attitude of community instead
of competition, a respect for
each fellow student's belong-
ings instead of a “rip it off
if you like it" tendency, and
a sense of society instead of
self.

ls Phys Ed Budget Unreasonable?

by Molly and John Pepper
Some rather interesting con-
clusions arise from the Cole
Iege’s approved budget for
1971-72, which was discussed
at this Monday's facultymeet~

Keepnews: JC Misses Facts

Dear Editor:
It's not so much that J. C.
' Iabowitz’s criticism of this
year’s social program was a
case of "bitching after the
fact." It’s more a case of
bitching without the facts.
The Social Committee is al-
ways open to criticism, but
we tend to prefer criticism
that is in some way COnSII‘UC‘
tive, and that is voiced to us
directly so we can reply to it
or discuss it. Labowitz’s cri-
ticism is of the markedly unr
helpful "Whatrisrthlsrshit"
variety (or the “what—is‘this-
shit - and — aren't - I - cute -
the - way , I , phrase - it"
variety), and worse than that
it is inaccurate. In addition to
a number of minor inaccurar
cies which I won’t go into now
but will be glad to relate to
anyone who asks me, there is
a major inaccuracy in J.C.'s
representation of this year's
program. I quote: “how come
last year we could get 3.3.,
Pete, Doc, the TSU Torona‘
dos, and severalNorth Lounge
concerts per semester, and
this year we have Big Mama,
Enoch Smoky . . . and only
one or two N.L. jams?” This
year, J.C., We have had Big
Mama, Enoch Smoky, Mike
Seeger, Jackson Browne, the

East River Anthology, the Joe
Henderson Quintet, about five
North Lounge dances, last
Wednesday’s folk concert, and
a Black Cultural Weekendwhc
ich included the Pharaohs (for
whom credit shouldgoto Law-
rence Wright and to the Afro~
American Cultural Affairs
Committee, which paid for
most of it). This weekend Fred
McDowell, who is probably
the best living folk-blues guir
narist and one of the best sin-
gers, will be in the South
Lounge, and there will be a
jam in the N.L. Not too many
big names, granted, but bear
in mind two things: first of
all, the really “big" names
(in other words, the performs
ers that J.C. Labowltz has
heard of) cost a bell ofa lot
of money (last year we had
the good fortune to get both
E. B. King and Pete Seeger at
something like half their reg-
ular prices; nothing like that
has fallen our way this year).
Second of all, it is my belief
that you don't have to be fam-
ous to be good. Imaintain that
the above list containsawhole
lot of fine music. Planned for
next semester are the Fire-
sign Theater, the Impres-
sions, the Alvin Ailey Danc-
ers (who are reputedly outae

Kintner Questions Consistency
And logic 0! loewi’s PE Stand

Dear Sir: .

Q‘l severalocmsions recent:
1y, the students have accused
the faculty of inconsistency in
their treatment of the curri—
culum. The time has come, I

think, to throw those charges
back at the students or per»
haps more accurately, at the
Student Government, provided
that Mr. Loewi was indeed
expressing student opinion at
the faculty meeting last Mon-
day. At that meeting, Mr.
Loewi suggested that the stu-
dents were not unfavorable to
a P.E. requirement even th-
ough he had represented the
students as being solidly op-
posed to academic require-
ments. I fail to see the logic
of his position just as I fail
to see the logicofthefaculty's
vote to deny a bachelor’s den
gree to anyone who failed to
satisfy the P.E. requirement.
I hope that either Mr. Loewl
will clarify his position on
this or that the students them-
selves will do so.

Sincerely,

Philip Kintner

site), and an asryet unspech
fled rock group - the Commit‘
tee is, as Ihave said, open to
suggestions. (In fact, that's
why we squandered $300 on
Enoch Smoky - because so
many people recommended
them to us.)

I would be the first person
to admit that this year's soc-
ial program has been less
than perfect (at least thatpart
of the social program for
which the Social Committee is
responsible. I can‘t speak for
the Music Department, the
Theater Department, or the
hall social chairmen). So was
last year's, so was that of the
year before last, and so, I
imagine, has been every social
program every year since this
college was founded. I, for
one, do not detect a notiwble
decline in either the quality
or the frequency of concerts

ing. The amounts budgetedfor
Physical Education areas fol-
lows:

Men's P.E.
Women's P.E. 41,958
campus Recreation 2,459
Intercollegiate sports 38,000
This yields a total of$153,007
budgeted for Physical Educa-
tion next year. This figure
does not include college oblie
gations of about$l,500,000 for
the new P.E. complex or any
other plant expenses, includ
ing $100,000 for new and re-
furbished playing fields.

This means that Physical
Education outspends every
academic department, inclu-
ding 'the highestrspending,
Biology, which has an alloca-
tion of $150,000. Men's P.E.
on campus alone (i.e., not in-
tercollegiate) outspends l9
academic departments and
programs including all for
eign languages, Mathematics,
Black Studies, etc. Women's
P.E. outspends Classical Lan-
guages, Anthropology, and
six others. Intercollegiate Sp-
orts outspend six academic
fields or otherprograms. Last
year Grinnell spentahout $125
per student on Physical Edu-
mtion, as opposed to $98 per
student on new books for the
library.

$70,370

Nor, it should be noted, are
all ”PhysicalEducation" Cour
rses included in this. Mrs.
Voertman, who teaches mod-
ern dance, is an assistant in
Theater, not in P.E.

Unexpected expenses have
forced a general trimming of
budget demands, largely as a
consequence of unforseen tr-
oubles in the construction of
the new Physiml Education
Complex. Dean Walker spoke
Monday of reductions in the
number of teaching faculty
from the present 111 to about
106 or 107 full-time instruc-
(OIS-

erthermore, there isa gen-
eral tightening up in student
aid funds. At the current buds
geted rate of spending, Phy-
sical Education Spending am-
ounts to abouta fifth of the
amount allocated for student
aid. The amount for men's
on—campus sports is ten times
that allocated for the Black
Studies Program.

Can an institution dedicated,
by its own account, to liberal
and academic Values, really
afford this sort of non-acad-
emic spending? Moreover,
can we afford a PhysicalEdu-
cation requirement which inn
sures the maintenance of sp-
ending at the current level?

Mendenhall:lnitiative Fund OK

To the Editor:

In the October 16 issue ofthe
5&8 there appeared an article
by J. C. Labowitz concerning
the Initiative Fund. I feel J.C.
had several misconceptions
about the fund and I have fine
ally found it within myself to
respond. Die to the lapse me
time, it may be difficult for
a full connection between this
letter and the article to be
made, But perhaps, then, this
letter can serve as a general
clarification of the Initiative
Fund which might be good to
have in itself.

The basic purpose of the hilt
tiative Fund has net always
been the same as it is today.
Created in the 1965- 66 school
year, its original purpose, as
I understand it, was the en—
couragement, among the stu-
dents, of small ”personal"
types of social getetogethers.
Along with the fund was crea-
ted a committee to approve
specific expenditures from
the fund. Guidelines werealso
developed to give the commitr
tee some direction in the fund-
ing policy. Over the next cou-
ple years. the types of events
funded through the Initiative
Fund were expanded to include
such concepts as transporta-
tion to social events in the

area and so on. Its basic pur~
pose, however, of encourag-
ing small group social func*
tions remained the same. The
major change for the Initiative

Rind came two years ago and
with that change the fund was
re~defined and given a new
direction which guides the use
of funds at present. '

The re-definition of the fund
involved an increase in its
size to about $5,500. Import-
antly, most of the increase
came from whathadprevious—
1y gone to individual hallallo-
cations. The hall allocations
were decreased to the old le-
vel of the Initiative Fund, a
total of about $1,800. The re
verse] of theseamounts meant
several things. First, halls
would now have to go to the
Initiative Fund for most of
their social events, because
their hall allocations were no
longer large enough to cover
the costs. Secondly, the range
of events encompassed by the
Initiative Fund wouldnow have
to be expanded to include the
"traditional" types of events
halls had previously spon-
sored for themselves. Finally,
overall the change meant that
money for certain types ofso-
cial events would be centrale
ized to assure better control.

The Initiative Fund Commit-
tee is appointed by S.G.A. and
is given by S.G.A. the respon-
sibility to allocate the fundfor
a broad range ofsocialevents.
A general direction is given to
the fundingpolicybytheS.G.A.
approved guidelines. Probably
the most important aspect of
those guidelines is their em.
phasis on assuring an equit-
able distribution of the funds.

The general outlook of the
present Initiative Fund Come
mittee can probably be sum-
marized like this. The com-
mittee has responsibility to
