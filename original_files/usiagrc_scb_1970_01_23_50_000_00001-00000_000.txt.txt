Coach Bowers Sued B& 6 ”11'0” Farmed
By Ex-Grinnellian

At 4:30 PM. last Tuesday in
the Grinnell Police Station,
Justice of the Peace Ed Lincoln
heard the case of State versus
Edd Bowers. Mr. Bowers is
charged with assault under ar»
ticle 691.4 of the Iowa Code in
an incident that occurred at a
private faculty club party in
Main Lounge on December 18,
1969. Mr. Bowers allegedly
shoved Lawrence Frank, 1408
East Street, and struck him on
the arm while Frank was at-
tempting to take photographs of
the party.

In the trial Tuesday, the State
called two witnesses, Frank and
Kenneth Shainess, a Grinnell
student. Frank testified that he
and Shainess entered the lounge
at about 7 P. M. and had begun
shooting pictures and talking
with faculty members, when Mr.
Bowers led Frank to one of the
doors and began discussing the
picture-taking with Frank.
Frank testified that once he lifted
the camera above his head to
take a picture of something
behind Bowers. Bowers, he said,
put his hand on the camera and
shoved slightly 7 blocking the
shot. Later, Frank testified,
Bowers struck him on the arm
as he was attempting to take an-

. other picture.

The defense also called two
witnesses. Mr. Nick Ryan,
Director of Placement and Stu-
dent Aid at Grinnell, testified that
the dinner was a faculty club
party and that no students had
been invited. He said that he had
talked to Shainess at the door-
way, asking him to leave, while
Bowers talked to Frank. Ryan
thought that Bowers asked Frank
to leave. He_ said that the
discussion between Frank and
Bowers was not heated.

Mrs. Oda Callison, Secretary
to the Dean's Associates testified
that faculty members had paid
for their dinner. The club, she
said, is a membership club. Mrs.
Callison also said that Ryan,
Bowers, and Mr. Raymond Boyd.
Assistant Professor of Physical
Education at Grinnell, had asked
Frank and Shainess to leave the
party.

Mr. Bowers. a Professor of
Physical Education at Grinnell,
is on leave for the second
semester and could not testify at

the trial Tuesday.

Justice Lincoln asked the
defense to file a brief. He
promised to hand down his
decision on or before February
third.

Last Semester there were
rumors on campus that the
employees of the Building and
Grounds Department of the
college were considering the
formation of a union. These
rumors were confirmed recently
in a statement released by the
President’s office. the text of

Pre-Prolessionals: Ph.D. Buyers’
Markei in Academic World

Ph. D candidates seeking jobs
this winter quickly found out that
the supply oi‘teachers has exV
ceeded the demand for them.

At the annual meeting of the
Modern Language Association in
Denver, only half the number of
departments recruited new
members this year than did last
year. One department chairman
reported receiving more than 600
applications for five positions.

When the American Historical
Association met in Washington.
it was reported that 2,000 men
were seeking only 400 positions.

The greatest scarcity of jobs
seemed to be in the Humanities:
however, men in the physical and
natural sciences reported that
they were finding it increasingly
difficult to secure jobs.

Among the reasons cited for the
job scarcity are: There was a
vast increase in student
enrollment in the early 1960’s.
Many of these students went on
to graduate school and then into
the teaching profession. In ad-
dition, John C. Gerber, chairman
of the department of English at
the University of Iowa, noted that
the academic life was becoming
increasingly attractive to young
people. He said that 80 per cent
of the majors in Iowa’s depart-
ment of English plan to teach.
Further, there has been a
reduction in the rate of growth
of undergraduate enrollment
which means that departments
have not been expanding their
staffs.

Henry w. Sams, chairman of
the department of English in the
Pennsylvania State University,
noted that Students in graduate
schools have shown an increasing
reluctance to teach freshmen. “If
one of them had said, I like fresh-
men; I want to teach them, I
would have picked up the
telephone and Offered him a job,
budget or no budget," Mr. Sams
said.

A faculty member from a
relatively new institution in the
South, who was at the meeting
in Denver, commented:

“We’re getting applicants this
year who wouldn't have dreamed
of applying several years ago. I
really feel sorry for some of these
fellows."

Many radicals and women are
especially worried about the
shortages in the job market. The

radicals expressed the opinion
that the job shortages would
create an “army of the unem-
ployed” from which the in
stitutions would select only the
most conservative prospects. lt
was further noted that, in a tight
market, women do not get hired.
This situation was said to exist
particularly in the field of
history.

which is below. Contract
negotiations are to begin in early
February, and a lawyer, James
L. Rogers, will represent the
College in its negotiations with
the union in question, the
Teamster'sUnion.

Apparently aware of the in-
terest in unionization on the part
of Buildings and Grounds em-
ployees, Teamsters Local
Number 90 sent a labor organizer
to the campus early last
semester, and he obtained the
signed authorizations of several
employees to represent them in
collective bargaining. After 47 of
the 92 Buildings and Grounds
employees had signed such
authorizations, a first meeting
was held the night of November
20th at the Grinnell Chamber of
Commerce Building, where the
potential union members were
addressed by Paul Neal, a
representative of Teamsters’

Book Store Addition Announced;

To be Completed

At a meeting of the faculty and
staff early this week, President
of the College Glenn Leggett
announced plans for the con-
struction of a new addition to the
College Book Store. The addition
will extend beyond the current
location of the. book store to the
east and add several thousand
square feet to the present capac
ity of the store, enabling it to
handle an increased volume. The
building has been planned to
reﬂect the architectural styles of
Burling Library and the Forum
and will form with these build-
ings an aesthetic triangle of simi-
lar glass front architecture sur-

by September

rounding central campus.
Although the Library and Book
Store committee has yet to decide
on the final disposition of the new
space, it is known that the
present drop of a few steps into
the area of the book store will
be retained at the present point,
and that the new addition will
be at ground level. A covered
walkway is to lead from the rear
of the book store into the entrance
of the Post Office, thereby elimi-
nating the dangerous accumu
lation of snow or mud which now
renders the passage into the Post
Office from the east unpleasant.

Local 90. A question and answer
period followed his address.

Later, on December 22nd, an
election was held among the
emolnvees at the college at which
it was voted by a majority of
67 to 25 to allow the Teamsters’
Union to represent the workers
in collective bargaining with the
college.

During the period of these
negotiations, David Horwatt, a
Grinnell College student, was
functioning in the capacity of a
“participant observer," part of
his work for an independent
project in political science taught
by Dr. Neal A. Milner, Assistant
Professor of Political Science.
Horwatt has commented that one
of the major issues involved is
the payment of equal salaries to
maids and janitors. It is im—
portant, he believes, that equality
of these sexes be demonstrated
in word and deed in employment
and hiring practices. Com,-
menting on this, college ads
ministrative officials have
pointed out that the maids and
janitors actually perform quite
different tasks, with the janitors
occasionally being called on to
do heavy lifting. Nonetheless,
students in favor of the union
insist that the tedium involved
in the jobs of the maids can be
as wearing as the heavier work
of the janitors.

The cost increase anticipated
in meeting union demands will
serve to explain to some extent
a rise in the operating deficit of
the college over the year.
Although not all salaries are to
be raised, according to the
union‘s demands, to the same
extent as the maids,’ the cost'to
the college represented by
buildings and grounds will
possibly double by 1971.

Above is an architect's drawing of the new addition to the book store. Whether or not the entrance
shown on the north wall is to remain part of the plan is under consideration.
