A skin-diving course, an all—day basketball Clinic and

5m attempt to promote sports without proper financial aid
testify to the work John Pfitsch (Director of Intercollegi-
ate Athletics on leave second semester) is doing in Pana-

ma.
-

 

In his role as o YMCA advisor on sports, Plitsch
writes that he is ex 0 ng' his Work and in notes to Mickey
Holmest Sports Ililorlnation Director) has told of some of
lis experiences
One of Pfitsch‘s assignments was to teach a skin-

diving course. But apparently in his vast coaching career
he had never taught skin-(living before. In fact. as
Pfitsch puts, it, “Until now I‘ve never had a flipper on.
.The first series of meetings was on how to handle sharks
underwater—but that’s the way it goesi”

. Then on a more serious assignment Pfitsch has tried
to set up a program in physical fitness. But here again
Pfitsch has been stymied. He says, ”We have no money
and hardly any equipment and a very peculiar attitude of
‘ioing~ nothing today that we can wait to do mzlnana. S0
1 have doubts as to whether the program goes.”

Finally, Pfitsch sends word that two weeks ago he held‘
an all-day basketball clinic for servicemen at Fort Davis,
.which is on the Atlantic side of Panama.

In baseball action, two big bats have been carrying:
the Pioneers. Swinging them are Bob McIntyle, who as
of Tuesday was batting .469 with 15 hits and 13 RBI's,
Quid Jim Jenks. who is hitting at h .353 clip with 12 hits
and 10 RBI’S.

Also McIntyre. who has two home runs, has tied the
school record in that department. In hit‘s right now he’s
tour short of Gary Knamiller’s year-old mark and lacks
one RBI before he can tie the record held by Bill Murray.
