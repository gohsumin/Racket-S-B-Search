It is true ttiat one of the major
duties of the Senate is torn
niuluting a budget each year, and
that the Senate has control of the
entire $54,775 in doing so. After
tho budget is written by the
Finance Committee and has won
Senate approval, the funds over
which the Senate has direct
control are only those wllicll the
Seliate has allowcd to itsell (this
year, tllc sum is about $4,000
counting salaries and last year's
surplus). The Senate’s major
allocations this year to date have
been $500 to KDIC for salaries;
about $500 for tiie Marcll on
Washington; and $600 to the
upcoming Working Class Cone
rerenee. ($300 for the Forum
Colfee house was in the form of
a loan, not an appropriation).
Other smaller expenditures have
been for such things as the
Moratorium, the Student Position
Paper, the S. G. A. Constitution,
and election ballots.

week’s editorial (or legal

To the editors:

We'd like to begin by remark-
ing about the general irrespon-
sibility of the editorial policy of
the 5&3 since it has changed
hands, Your first editorial was
written without factual knowl-

edge of the position paper and
the progress the steering com-
mittee had made in negotiating
with the taculty. AS tar as we
are able to ascertain, neither oi
the editors has ever attended a
women’s liberation meeting as
was demonstrated by the lack of
insight in your second editorial,
Your third editorial 7 and here
again we have never noticed your
iaces at a Senate meeting — is
also a credit to your irresponsible
journalism, To put it bluntly, you
don't know what you're talking
about, You stated in your
editorial “that there are no ap-
parent laws which regulate
Senate expenditures.” However,
every allocation oi the Senate,
as with any Senate action, is
subject to veto by a student
referendum. You go on to state
that “the Senate can do as it
pleases with our money," Need
we remind you that all Senators
are elected at large by the
student body. The editors of the
sea, which this year received a
larger Senate allocation than
ever before ($5,500.00), are
chosen (often for political
reasons) by a committee with
only direct student members.

Let us proceed to examine
some or your specific charges.
To begin with, the Pterudactyl
never received a penny irom the
present Senate. You suggest in
your editorial that the Senate
might “considerably reduce”
Social funds in order to subsidize
Pterodactyl. Should the
Senate decide to subsidize
any other newspaper, money
would be taken from general
budget and reserve and not the
social coordinating fund, which
this year also has a greater
allocation than ever before. The
Senate never allocated money for
a dog house, and the “few pear
ple" who went to the Washington
Moratorium were 80 strong.

Other “ransacking” activities
of the Senate include subsidizing

it highly successful and beneficial
Drug Symposium to which the
Senate gave $650, Supporting the
Grinnell area Moratorium ac-
tivities, and pledging another
soon to this spring’s conterence
on the American Working Class,
all of which would have been im-
possible to do without the
Senate'ssupport,

Clearly, the Senate’s use of
funds has been more responsible
than the editorial policy ot this
semester’s Scarlet. mid Black, IS

Senate, or the $5500 toy of Messrs.
Fulton and Gerson which merits
greater scrutiny?

And {many 7 why do you run
to President Leggeit to appoint
a watchdog committee for Senate
appropriations? Can’t Students
take the initiative to control their
designated monies without the
administration prodding? We
sincerely question Messrs.
Fulton and Gerson: whose side
are you on?
