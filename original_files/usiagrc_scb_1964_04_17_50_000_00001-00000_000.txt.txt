Grinnell to Get the Japanese Treatment
In Culture, Entertainment This Weekend

By Karen Adkinson

Tired of being from the land
of transistors and geisha girls,
the five Japanese students at
.Grinnell are attempting to in-
form the campus about their
country with a Japanese week
end sponsored in conjunction
with the Cosmopolitan Club
and Social Planning Board.

Masakatsu Kato, leader of
the group, said, “Many parts
of Japanese culture have been
oversimplified in popularly
held notions. We Want to clarify
some of the misunderstandings
this Weekend.”

The weekend begins tonight
with a SAGA-served Japanese
meal of curry and rice. Al-
though of Indian origin, this
meal is “common in Japan” a
cording to Kato.

“We had to remember that
this meal was a mass produced
one. It is hard to prBServe the
Japanese flavor of many of our

dishes when served in large
quantities," he explained. “For
the Cosmopolitan Club, the pro-
fessors who have an interest in
Japan, and the Japanese stu-
dents we are having a Sukiyaki
Party in the PDR.”

Tomorrow the weekend will
turn to a more academic ap-
proach as Dr. Hidetoshi Kato,
visiting professor from Japan,
presents a coffee hour at 3 in
Younker lounge. Dr. Kato has
announced he “will speak brief-
ly about cultural characteristics
of contemporary Japan and her
position in the international

Rockefeller Foundation Grant
To Support Minority Education

Grinnell College Wednesday
announced receipt of a $275,000

grant from The Rockefeller
Foundation to support a three-
year trial program to increase
the discovery of talented Negro
and other minority group stu-
dents and to improve their un-
dergraduate education.

In announcing the grant.
President Howard R. Bowen
said $240,000 will be used to pro»
Vlde financial assistance to
qualified students from Negro
and other disadvantaged minor-
ity groups, and $35,000 for such
purposes as recruitment, pre-~
freshman remedial courses.
tutoring, counseling, and gen-
eral administration of the pro-
gram.

“It is our intention to provide
a substantial subsidy through-
out the four undergraduate
years for 30 to 40 students en-
rolled during the trial pro-
gram,” Bowen said. “Grants,
made on a basis of need, will
provide measurable assistance
in meeting the financial emer-
gencies of these students."

 

Funds from the grant will be
a v a i l a b l e for expenditure
through a period ending Dec.
31, 1970.

Bowen also pointed out mat
the Rockefeller grant will have
little, if any, bearing on Grin-
nell’s current program to raise
$4,000,000 to match a $2,000,000
grant offered by the Ford Foun-
dation in 1901. The Ford PrO'
gram is scheduled to end June
30, 1964.

Payments on the Rockefeller
grant will be made on a semi-
annual basis, following receipt
and acceptance by the Foundav
tion of an operating budget at
the beginning of each fiscal
year.

In expressing appreciation of
the gift, Bowen pointed out that
Grinnell has exhibited “a tra-
ditional interest in supporting
the education of gifted. but
needy, students.

“This grant will permit the
college to expand this program
in a dramatic manner which
otherwise .would have been
quite impossible,” he said.

fore the convention could de-
cide on Lodge as its nominee.'

Senator Barry Goldwater led
on the first two ballots, but his
291 votes on these two ballots
were far short of the 648 needed
for nomination.

Lodge moved into second
place on the second ballot and
then surged into the lead with
558 votes on the third ballot. At
this points Lodge’s closest con-
tenders w e r e Pennsylvania
Governor William Scranton,
who had polled 251 votes, and
New York Governor Nelson
Rockefeller, who had 212.

Lodge still had to heat off a
challenge from Scranton on the
fourth and fifth ballots to take
the nomination. Tension rose
0n the fourth ballot as the fast
paced roll call showed that
Scranton possessed an outside
chance to catch Lodge.

At the end of the fourth bal-
lot Lodge was only 21 votes
shy of the nomination, but
Scranton had jumped from 251
to 484 votes. At this point the
Rockefeller forces held the bal»
ance with 183 votes in their
control.

Although Scranton was clos-
ing the gap on Lodge through-
out the fifth ballot, the latter's
lead proved insurmountable.
when Texas cast 32 votes for
Lodge at 11:40 p.m., it was all
over.

Mark Hatfield, the Republi-
can keynoter, won a landslide
victory for the Vice Presiden—
tial nomination, defeating

 

Michigan‘s Governor George
Romney on the first ballot.

A rumored battle for the
Democratic Presidential nom«
ination failed to materialize
Saturday night as Lyndon John-
son easily won the nomination
on the second ballot,

Governor George Wallace of
Alabama was the first to be
nominated at the Democratic
nominating session. Delegates
and spectators heard Wallace
described as a man who loves
his “150 million" fellow citi-
zens. Alabama was described
as one of the most progressive
states in the Union as far back
as before the “War Between
the States."

In addition to Johnson and
Wallace and several favorite
son candidates, the name of
Adlai Stevenson was placed in
nomination. It was rumored
Saturday evening that a full<
scale attempt would be made
by those allies with the Stevem
son forces to capture the nomi-
nation from Johnson. The Stev-
en 5 on challenge collapsed.
however, as Johnson won over
1,000 votes on the first ballot.
He easily won the few morn
votes needed for nomination on
the next ballot.

The Democratic contest for
the Vice Presidential nomina-
tion, which was expected to
match the Republican Presiden-
tial battle, also fell short of ex-
pectations. The victory went to
Hubert Humphrey on the first
ballot.
