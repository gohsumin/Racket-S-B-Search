mediate reaction is to push tlle paper
away and not believe it,” he said. He
also cited a traditional American attitude
which leaves foreign policy decisions to
the experts, The third problem IS the iso-
lation and academic orientation of the
college itself. Mendeisohn concluded that
”It is this sort of thing (the Speak Out)
that's needed at Grinnell to get peoplo
out of the apathy trap and into the arena
of political action."

Organizers ol the Speak Out intend
to term discussion groups to continue the
study or U.S. loreign policy in Vietnam.
Laurie Woods, spokesman for the group,
also anticipates a “Beln” on Central
Campus this Spring. She described it as
“a conducive atmosphere for talk and
free relations among people. It's not a
situation that is defined by our society,
so there is no set way or reacting. it's
just it happening — you Come and be."

Over 500 colleges, universities, and
high schools, plus 100 Sioux Indians will
take part in the Spring Mobilization
to End the War in Vietnam. The Stu<
dent Mobilization Committee estimates
that this will be the largest student
demonstration yet against the war.

Similar demonstrations are being
planned on campuses across the country.
For example, students from the Univer-
sity oi Chicago will demonstrate at the
Witco napalm plant. At San Francisco
State College, movements have begun
to protest campus complicity with the
draft, to abolish ROTC and bar CIA
recruiters from the campusi

“There are many facets of the war
the public is not aware at. All we can
do is vote for representatives who we
feel are intelligent, reasonable and re
sponsible individuals and then put some
faith in them."

“You cannot run a government from
the grass roots level," Robinson con-
tinued. “The government has to be
somewhat secretive."

The countelrmubilizers also feel the
main demonstrators Will only hurt their
own cause of Vietnamese peace by
lowering the morale of the American
troops and giving encouragement to
Hanoi.

“They’re not going to accomplish my
thing." Robinson continued. “They
won’t change the opinion or the State
Department—or the lows legislature."

at University of low

A lineman show of 60 recent photo-
graphs by tumor Grinnell student
Henry Wilhelm is currently on display
at the University of lolva in Iowa City.
The exhibit, which will run through
April 22, contains a selection of nor
trails, natural scenes, nude Studies, and
journalistic photographs. Several oi the
photographs appeared in the last issue
of NOUS and a number of them Will
appear in the 1966 yearbook, Grinnell
College - 1966.

The show is hanging in the main
lounge at the iowa Memorial Union.
Wilhelm is oilering prints from the show
and most other photographs he has
taken for sale at a price of $10 each
He feels the worir in the show “repre-
sents significant achievement in several
dilierent aspects oi photography” and
forms a probable basis for luture work.
Wilhelm Is now residing in Grinnell
after having been dismissed from the
college for academic reasons. He plans
to do serious work in photography on
his own for at least a year “to see
what sort of potential I have,"

possibility tor a new counseling system
in which students would replace faculty
as underclass advisers and each hall
would have a faculty member as a
nonresident adviser.

There Is a possibility that the radio
station will be subsidized by the SGA.
The station will need approximately
$3000 to get started and $1000 each year.
Rather than increase student 1285, Muo<

commission on the Pepsi machines.
According to agreement, this fund must
be used for the benefit of Grinnell
students, but need not be used exclusively
to bring foreign students to the campus.
