33 Take Cornell’s
Old Sem, Charged,
Put on Suspension

Thirty Cornell College stu-
dents and 3 nonrstudents were
arrested and charged with un-
lawful assembly after a Shout
takeover of the college adminis-
nation building October 17.
Doyle Raglan. spokesman for
the protesters, explained that
the group wished to stir up an
"apathetic” and "racist” oam-
pus.

Cornell Dean Stuart Good told
the 5&3 in a telephone inter-
view that when the administra-
tion expressed its intent to re
gain control of the administra-
tion building, the students pre-
lented a list of 4 demands and
Itipulated that they be met with-
h 48 hours. The demands were:
”The establishment of a Black
activity center which would
house a library, assembly-lec-
ture hall, and a social center.
I) That at least 10 per cent of
the convocation he presented by
Black entertainers and speak-
ers,

8) That the curriculum Include
courses in Black art, literature,
history, and others dealing with
the Afro-American and African
culture.

4) The college should step up the
hiring of Black instructors, with
the addition of at least one
Black adviser to the staff. A
ﬁfth demand later made was
that no charges be brought
against the pmtestors.

Raglan demanded that Presi-
‘dent Samuel Stumpt sign a
Atatement delineating the five
demands, and that he insure
that these demands would be
implemented within the forty-
eight hours. Stumpf felt he did
not have the authority to sign
auch a statement and that the
goals could not be accomplished
in such a short period of lime.
Threats by nonsprotesting stu-
dents to forcibly eject the pro-
testers iorced Stumpt to call in
the Linn County police

The Students, after talking for
five minutes with college offi~
cials, were led out of the build
ing by Raglon. At the police
station the students were re-
leased on “their own recog-
nizance” and the three nonsstu-
dents on $75 bond each.

“I feel a college should handle
internal problems with internal
forces, but if the sources aren’t
available, others must be used.
You can’t put out a fire with
the drinking glasses we have
here at Cornell,“ stated Stump!.

The following official slate-
ment was released the same
day. “The faculty or Cornell
College has voted to suspend
without prejudice the students
who were in the administration
building pending judicial deter-
mination of their cases by Car—
nell College.”

Each student will receive a
separate trial and, although
several cases have already been
concluded, no decision on puns
ishment will be announced until
all 39 cases have been heard by
the studentfaculut board.

Read Hall Suffer:
5100 Fire Damage

Last Sunday there was a
fire in the room of Edwin
DeEus, which caused an es-
timated $100 damage to col-
lege property. The fire was
discovered by Michael Bran-

Dean of Students W. Douglas
Ensminger came to inspect
the scene of the file which
occurred in Read 555. Ac
cording to DeBus the fire

of a scented candle that was
left burning on the desk
when he left the room.

In addition to the desk that
was destroyed and the dam-
age to the wall and ceiling

quire bonus to pay for the
damage to college property
caused by the fire.

Arringion Visits
As PPPE Guest;
Supports Nixon

Republican majority Ieadei‘
and president pro tempore of
the llliliois Senate. William Rus-
sell Arrington, served as Poli-
ticiansin-residelnce during his
daylong stay here Wednesday,
October 30. Arrington had
breakfast with Students, toured
the campus, visited three class—
rooms, held an interview with
students that was taped for
KDIC, and attended a bull ses-
sion in the evening.

Arrington. currently serving
as Lieutenant Governor of Illi—
nois, is not only active in Illi-
nois politics, but also in busi-
nes and civic groups.

During an interview, Arring-
ton attacked critics of Richard
Nixon who say that Nixon has
been vague and that he is ovoid-
fng the real Issues of the cam-
paign, Arrington laid that Nixon
has given his statement or the
issuer and taken a definite stand
on those issues. He asserted that
Nixon has stated in great detail
What his Views are.

Arrington went on to say that
he believes Vietnam is not the
major issue of this election, and
that Nixon has not spoken on
this problem only I) e c at us 9
there is a chance that the Pam
peace talks may be successful.
Mr. Nixon does not want to jeo-
pardize the position of the us.
by opposing President Johnson
on this point.

Arrillgton does not know what
effect George Wallace Will have
on the Presidential race, and
does not think that either the
Republicans or the Democrats
will know until after the elec-
tions. He did say, however, that
he does not believe that Wallace
will do as well in the election in
the polls presently predict.

Arrington commented on the
Daley political machine in one
classroom as “Up until this
time, the most efficient machine
in the country." He believes,
however, that a Republican vic-
tory in the races for State's At-
iomey and Governor would
severely damage the effective
ness of the machine. He later
said that Daley controls the pre-
sent Governor of illinois. Sam-
uel Shapiro, as well as many
city orliciais.

b Survey

(Conlinued from Page i)

once a week or more often. The
breakdown on frequency of lV's
is as follows:

Once a month ......i. 31.5%
35%
. 22.5%

11%

Almost onevhalf of the students
having IV's. 47%, said their [V’s
were for “sexual purposes”.
The remaining 53%, those who

did not have lV's for sexual
purposes, had their IV’s general-
ly for the purpose of “talking".
“studying”, ”parties”, or sim-
ply “socializing“.

Once a week

2-3 times a week
Every day

Ninety-five per cent of the re
lponding students said that they
were aware of regular or occa-
sional IV's on their floor, and of
these, only 17% said that they
were bothered by these lV’s.

0f the 75% respondents who
have had illegal visitationl, less
than half, 47%, have made use
of Sunday’s open house. A large
number of students who have
not had IV'e. about 40%, have
used the Sunday “legal" hours.

Ten per cent of all respond~
ants either thought there
should be no change in the
rules, or that they should
be made more strict. One
girl etu dent thought that
there should be "no open
dorms at any timel" Generally,
though, or the 90% who favored
“less strict” rules, most wanted
hours extended, especially on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday
nights, but none expressly fav-
ored 24 hour opens.

One que a tion, concerning
whether rules should be made
standard tor dormitories. floors
of halls, or the entire campus

produced widely spilt opinion.
The question and response to
it is as follows:

There he a standard rule for,
each, . . t .

dormitory .. . 26%
floor . 39%
for the entire campus , 35%

Quite a few people thought
that there was no way to show
that they favored a very flexible
campuswide rule, which would
allow the hall or floor to esta-
blish its own specific hours.
Thus the sentiment ﬁll” this kind
of rule, which was considerable,
was not reflected in the above
question.

Additional comments on the
open dorms question had several
common themes. Although only
14% or the students considered
the question of open dorm:
"not important” to the college,
(many) 38.93% of those writing
additional comments thought
that the emphasis on open
dorms was out of proportion and
in the words of one woman stir.
dent, “There are more impor\-
tant things in this old world,’h

Another common theme that
was apparent throughout the
surveys was a desire to see
whatever new rules were made
be “strictly enforced."

A large number of dtudents’
comments were simply that the
administration had no real right
to determine or limit coedtlcas
tional use of dormitory rooms,
in the words of one student,
"Freedom of visitation should
be accepted as natural”.

One final comment, typical of
many students feelings, should
be mentioned: One male sophoc
more said, “I think there should
be one major rule concernin
open dorms and that is one o,
consideration—that is, I don't
want my right to walk naked to
the shower infringed upon."
