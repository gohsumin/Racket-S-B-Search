Credit-Fail Explained

The iollowing proposal on the credit-tail system was approved
in a meeting at the general raculty Monday attemoon:

“Beginning with the 1956—67 academic year, students classi-
ﬁed as sophomores, juniors, or seniors may elect to receive a
credit-fail grade rather than a letter grade in one of their
courses in each semester, subject to the following regulations:

“1. in a course elected for grading on the credit-tail basis the
student’s grade shall be designated “credit” or “fail". A grade
Di “credit" shall not be included in the student‘s semester or cumu-
lative grade-point average; a grade oi “fail” shall be included
at our grade points per credit.

“2. No course elected for grading on the credit-fail basis shall
satisty any part or a general requirement for graduation. The stu-
dent must meet the general requirements by courses graded on
the letter basis.

“3. No course in the student’s major iield shall be elecled for
grading on the credit~iail basis. Any course elected ior such grad-
ing prior to the student’s declaration of his major shall not count
inward the minimum credit requirement for the major. In case of
a student's inability to meet the minimum credit requirement for
his major, the major department and the Dean or the College may
waive this regulation

“4. The student shall not elect the credit-fail basis Di grading
alter his tinal registration tor a course. However, he may change
his election to the letter basis or grading at any time prior to the
deadline for adding courses.

“5. The Registrar shall indicate on the class rolls those stun
dents who have elected the credit-tail hasis of grading. instructors
shall report to the Registrar only a grade or “credit" or “fail", and
this grade shall appear as such on the student’s transcript."

Fill-ll'Year Abroad Deodline’Near:
Ollers Service. Travel Possibility

The deadline tor application for
a TravelSer-vice Scholarship for a
“Fifth Year Abroad" in 1966-67 is
January 25.

Each year crinnell sends grad-
uates to teach and help in extra-
curricular actiVlties at colleges or
high schools in underdeveloped
countries. The Travel - Service
Scholarships are a recent out-
growth oi the old Grinnellrianhina
program. Aiter a small start in
1959, the number oi scholars has
expanded irom one to as many
as eight in 1962, The school would
like to send three abroad lol' the
academic year 1966-67.

The form of service has been
wide. Grinnell graduates have
taught, either in their major field
or English, have directed musical
groups, coached a sport, worked
in the extracurricular lite oi the
host institution or have served as
a resident director or “counselor”
in a dormitory

Glinneiiians in the program
have lived in Brazil, Ceylon, Chile,
Columha, Greece, India. Liberia,
Nyasaland, Tanganykia, Thailand
and Turkey. India, Thailand and
Latin America are the areas be-
ing considered for 1966—67. The
preference of a particular student
selected will be Considered but it
may be impossible to send him
or her to that country.

While abroad the student selves
as a correspondent for the 5&3
(see stories in this issue on Co-

 

 

lumbia and lndia). Upon his or
her return to this country the stu-
dent may be asked to return to
Grinnell tor a short time to share
experiences with ci-innell stu-
dents.

To apply, a student must suh-
mit a two or three page paper in-
dicating why the student wishes to
spend a year abroad and what it is
the student has to crier in the way
at services. lnlormation regarding
experience in camping, project
work, hobbies, etc, should also be
included. A student should ask his
major adviser and two other pro-
iessors for recommendations.

The scholarship provides for the
roulld trip transportation from
Grinnell, or the student's home,
to the receiving college, computed
at tourist rate. In addition, $250

is granted to cover such items as
passports, visas, baggage, insur-
ance, and expenses en route. The
host institution provides free room
and board during the academic
year and usually a small amount
for "pocket money." Each scho-
lar must agree to raise an addi-
tional $250 on his own prior to
the date of departure to ensure
the coverage or incidental expens-
es and possible emergencies. Ad—
ditionai travel and purchase of
foreign handicrafts has lead pest
scholars to estimate that they
spent $500 of their own money.
