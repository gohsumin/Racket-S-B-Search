} Apartments
(Continued from Page 1)

Dean Thompson expressed
the administrative attitude to-
ward off-campus apartment liv-
log to an 5&3 reporter in the
following manner:

I. The administration looks
with disiavur on off - cam-
pus apartment living.

, The character of Grinnell
would change radically it
students were allowed to
live off - campus.

An interpretation of “resi-

dential college” as “dormis

tnry residence” is arhi~
trary, but so is everything
else.

.Dormitory life has educa-
tional advantages as inl-
lows:

a, opportunity to meet
many different kinds of
people

b. chance to learn to live
with others

0. proximity oi new stu-
dents in those already
involved in campus ac-

Students expressing comments
opposed to oiircampus apart<

merit living (2 students who
were against this suggestion
favored college — owned off-
campus housing as an alterna
tive) listed the following basic
reasons for their opinions:

1. Lack of contact with other
students

2. Dorms provide more con<
Veniences (erg. maid ser-
vice)

3. Apartments are less physi-
cally presentable than
dorms

4, Parental disapproval

Rather than employing the
usual editorial technique of
presenting my own opinions of
these attitudes, I am going to
allow the students who com-
mented favorably an the idea
of oft-campus apartment living
to speak tor themselves; in
fact, it is the students who both
favor and oppose the residence
system who are writing this
article,

The following are representa»
tive quotes taken verbatim irom
the 5&3 questionnaires; the
first group deals with the gen-
eral topic or alt-campus living,
and the second represents more
specific concerns, principally
the need ror independence,

privacy, quiet, olicampus so-
clal life including both students
and iaculty members, and a
rather explosive dislike, in some
cases, or the dormitory system.

READ FOR YOURSELF:

Comment {mm a present apart-

ment dweller: (senior male)
“i am living on campus to
an apartment right now, and
I much prefer it to living in
the dormitory. i think that
when everything is added up,
like rent, telephone, electric-
ty, lurniture, etc, 1 end up
spending the same amount
of money i did on a dorm
room. However, the privacy,
quiet, and feeling of real in-
dependence make all campus
living much more desirable
and enjoyable."

General comments:
"I belive that restricting 20
or 11 year old adults to dumb
(Dry life is unfair and inhibit-
ing. The school is being un~
usually conservative and simp<
ly pig-headed in not admit
ting that at least juniors and
seniors should have the op-

portunity. Social life doesn't
have to be so limited and
controlled when the adminis-

tration is dealing with students
of the calibre usually found
at Grinnell." (freshman male)
"Students are young adults
whose present vocation hap—
pens to be that or going to
college As young adults, they
should be permitted to choose
not only their vocation, but
also their place or residence."
(senior female)

“Up to a point dorm life can
be beneficial in that the in<
dlvidual can rationally decide,
through discussion with many
diiierent people, on the type
of life he wants for himself.
But, after an individual has
decided how he Wants to live,
it is just as necessary for
him, in a learning situation
such as an academic com-
munity, to test his ideas and
to ﬁnd out whether they are
realistic {or him. If they are
not realistic, it’s better to ad
just now than later." (junior
female)
