St. Olaf Tries Interim; Carleton
to Publish Tasty Literary Digest

By Sara Bey

Two Antioch College seniors have
established a dormitory service to
provide food delivery, laundry ser-
vice, and, most ambitiously, a
scheme to synchronize all the
clocks on campus. The Antioch
Retard writes, “This has never
been done in the memory of mod»
Irn mun."

Beluit College is offering upper-
classmen opportunity to take a tull
term of work during the summer
at the University of Guadalajara,
Mexico, The seminar studies in-
clude two courses in advanced oral
Spanish, one in Mexican art and
architecture, and an independent
study project.

A revised calendar at St. Olaf
College now provides tor a tour-
week interim period. Students
can choose from 96 interim
courses or independent study in
Europe or Mexico.

280 sophomores at St. Olaf will
go on dates picked for them by a
computer. Applicants filled out a
questionnaire previously used at
Iowa State University, comparing
them on 41 different points. At
Carleton College, students are
planning their second Computer
Date Night. They used a two~part

 

questionnaire with a psychological
preference test and a statistical in-
formation section.

Mother, the “international” lit-
erary magazine published by Carle~

Giles said, so that “those readers
who don’t like Mother can eat it."
He added that. the magazine has

SCARLET AND BLACK

“You know," said a recent date, of mine as
she placed a booted loci on the coffee table and
in her tipariilo with her shiny new butane cigar
lighter, “It’s kind of a shame that chivalry is
dead,” She paused to exhale a cloud of acrld
smoke. "I wonder what killed it?"

I responded in my usual sophisticated man-
ner — a long silence broken at length by still
more silence. However, the question did intrigue
me so 1 puzzled over it for several days, The
question intrigued me for several reasons. First,
it was a proiound question and I like to puzzle
over profound-type things. More important, it
intrigued me because it was the first question
this girl had asked me that didn’t. deal With
liquor or sex.

Alter several days I did find the answer to
my date's question. Pneumatic door closers
killed chivalry.

You, of course, know what a pneumatic
door Closer is. it is that clever device at the top
or doors that insures that every door that is
opened is closed, thus maintaining an orderly,
closed—door society. I

Now it is a well known fact in chivalric
circles that the most important part. of being
chivalrous isn‘t throwing your coat on mud
puddles or walking on the outside of the side»
walk so you’ll be the one hit by the mud
splashed by all the horses that run past or
your attitude toward your girl or anything silly
and unimportant like all that. Man, What really
counts is opening that door in front of her. Any
knight in shining armor knows that.

Back in the glorious days of Arthur and
Gwen and the rest of the round table crowd, a
door just hung there on its hinges like a good
door and looked at your Granted the hinges may
have been a little rusty and granted the door
may have been twenty feet high, made of oak.
and weighed a ton, but at least it didn’t have
one of those hissing, sucking, pneumatic closers
at the top lighting you every inch or the way

The number or budding young knights in
shining armor who've had their ego smashed
beyond repair trying to open such a door sunve«
ly deries human imagination. Nothing is more
humiliating than to stand at one side of a
doorway, place your hand on the door, pus-h,
and have nothing happen. You push again, this
time your hand farther toward the center, and
still nothing, At last, in desperation, your face
red with shame, you push at the middle of the

door where you have better leverage, and you
manage to open the door about a mird of the
way, your arm now effectively blocking the
path at your Lady Fair. Your only recourse is
to walk through the doorway first. And there
you have it, the man going through the doorway
before the woman and chivalry has suffered
another setback.

in a futile attempt to tight these siayers of
knighthood, these empowered doors, I devel-
open what could have been a successful tactic.
As I would approach a door, I would fail about
a step and a hall behind my companion and
then, at the last second, realizing suddenly that
there was a door to be opened, would dash
wildly iorward, arm rigid and extended, and
throw open the door using the force or my sprint
to overcome the pneumatic closer. “Brilliant,"
you say? Not quite.

This system works well until one encoun-
ters a double door. For some reason known
only to the hierarchy of B at G only one door
or every pair is unlocked. You have only to im-
agine a charging Lancelot meeting a locked
doorr Shredded, absolutely shredded my coat,
shirt and arm. Bled, you know, badly.

So now you know why chivalry is dead, it
will remain dead until all doors are once again
treeswinging and unencumbered by the trap»
pings or our modern, industrial society, until
once again they are allowed to close of their
own initiative. Then, and only then, can we re-
turn to those happy days when knighthood was
in newer, so—to—speak.
