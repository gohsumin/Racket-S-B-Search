Drugs ai Grinnell

7 The use of drugs at Grinnell does not, we believe,
constitute a “problem.” In the fall of this year we
started doing research into the use of drugs, especially
marijuana, on campus Since Christmas time, when
we learned of a book that would come out this spring
mentioning Grinnell and drug usage, we have inter-
viewed over 60 students who purported to know some—
thing about drug usage at Grinnell. Many of these
Said they had tried marijuana. Many said they hadn't
Almost all knew of someone who had. Almost all
agreed that there was no “problem” as such,

1‘ The “problem” will start now with ofﬂcampus
reaction. Some parents will be indignant. Some gifts
,will be withdrawn from the college, This kind of re-
action is inevitable. A major portion of it will prob-
ably be headed off because the administration made
a statement in advance of any sensational break in the
Story,

What we hope happens on campus now is that
marijuana and other available drugs are discussed
openly and objectively. We hope that students will
take the time to study the report issued by the admin-
istration and even better, study still other informa-
tion on the topic

We know that no matter what is said about drugs
'some students are going to try them. We hope that
when they do they will have informed themselves
about the potential dangers.

A New NOUS

Once there was a magazine on campus called
NOUS. It died a quiet death. It was a magazine de-
voted to articles about philosophy and as such had
fairly narrow appeal. ,

Now NOUS may be resurrected, A proposal be-
fore the finance committee of the Senate would a-
bolish Grinnell Review as such and incorporate the
literature traditionally published in the Review with
new publication, a new NOUS.

The proposal has our complete support, We think
it is time that the “third publication” be given a new,
bigger and (pardon the expression) flashier format.
We think it could be a big step in promoting more cre-
ative writing and thinking.

Nexi Week

Next week the SA’LB will print “The Liberal Lib~
eral Arts College and Its Students: Part II, Carleton."
Burdett Loomis, a junior majoring in government at
Carleton, writes the lively discussion of life at that
Northfield school. His comments are interesting as
,well as informative,

I had always been told — and believed —
that you should maintain your sense of hu-
mor. So I was chuckling softly as l lugged
my Air-Foam suit case onto the train behind
me.

"Where're you going?” demanded the con-
ducmr, a sullen type with a white shirt with
a diriy collar.

“The Territories.”

“First car in your right."

“IS there a Club car?”

“Yeah. three cars that way."

I found a seat. I was alone in a double
seat. I sat on the aisle hoping that it would
make it harder for someone else to sit with
me. People Sit down if the aisle seat is vacant
but not many bother to step over you.

The porier in the club car wanted my
ID, i spent an extra dime and had Beet-
eaters instead of Inc American brand may
were serving. I didn't talk to anyone in the
car and after the third one I felt I was seeing
things in perspeciive and felt pretty good
about leavmg.

Lightin’ out as it were.

I stopped to think about how light the suit-
case really was this time. Nu hooks makes
a lot of difference when it comes to the
amount of weight you have to carry around.

“College kid?" It was some traveling
salesman type nexl lo me.

“Yes. Well. yeah, sort bi."

“Vacation time. Going home for vacation,
huh?”

"Well, no, nol exactly" I didn't want to
talk to him,

“Going home for the weekend."

“No, I’m not going home, you see . . I"

Rules Of Disorder

"Oh, I see. Going lo visit your girl some
where. I remember when I was in college —
went to college you know, during the depres-
sion, I knew how much an education would be
worth, helped me get where I am today ~ I
remember going to visit girls at other schools.
Kind of nice, you can sort of have as many
as you want that way. They never {ind out
about one another. Yeah, I remember col-
lege."

"No, I’m leaving school." I bit inlo 1
piece of ice in the helium of my glass.

The salesman leaned forward, grinned I
little and whispered “They kick you out?"

“on no, no, I just left.” l was looking for a
way to get away from this guy, I could just
excuse myself and leave I guess.

“That was a mistake. Real big mistake.
My God son how will you ever make a living
Without a college education? If it wasn't for
my college education I’d be just another
salesman but now I'm sales director in this
whole area. A two state area and every Auto-
strong spring in the district that’s sold I’m re-
sponsible tori I owe what I am to my college
education."

“Listen, I’d better get back to my seat.
I'm pretty tired and ”

“No, listen here a While. Think of the sac-
rifice your parents made to get you into
school and this far, Do they know you’re leav~
Ing?" i didn’t answer. or course they didn't
know. “Hell, if I’d done that my old man
would have heat the living innards nut bl me.”
I started to get up but he grabbed my sleeve.
“What're you going to do wiih yourself now?
They’ll draft you you know."

“I'm going to my seat and sleep."

And I left the club car.

EDI NOTE: The following is a letter sent
lo the Ad Hoc Committee on Hall Reorganiza-
tion,

Your purpose, as we understand ii, is to
make policy recommendaiibns to Presideui
Leggelt concerning ihe residence hall su-uc.
ture. We believe, though, that you have been
assigned a task winch, given the present
framework {or discussion, is beyond your
capacity to carry out, Specifically, we are
disturbed that in all discussions so far about
the “North Campus Problem," no statement
at the purposes or a hall syslem has been
mentioned. Without such a statement. we {all
to understand how any recommendations
could have beneficial effects except by sheer
lllck.

We assume that the question of hall ievi-
sion arose in response to widespread faculty
and administration opinion that the hall sys-
tem, as constituted, was failing to fulfill the
aims of a Grinnell education We wonder,
though. If your committee DI‘ anyone else has
a clear idea of What those aims are. A series
of highly idealisilc siaiemenis appears on
pages 20-21 of ihe College Bulletin, bui we
wonder If ihey are speciﬁc enough to be reler
Vant, either as ihe Working policy oi the co]-
legc, or as a basis of evaluation for your cam-
mlllee. Do these statements constitute a suf-
Iimently applicable set of expectations to serve
as criteria [or empirical study? It would seem
that problems are measured by the degree bi
divergence between the reality and the idea].
But ii understanding of either is in any de-
gree lacking, IS not any attempt to deﬁne his
problem an exercise in futility? And do ihc
objectives of lhe college, as stated, give that
adequate understanding?

We have made reference to the aims of
Grinnell education, aims which imply that the
scope of your undertaking should not he limit-
ed lo the residence hall system. it is our con-
tenlim‘i that llie residence hall system is not
an einiiy unto itself, but rather that it is an
integral part of the total Grinnell educational
complex, and that it should be treated as silch.
We quote li-om page 21 or the College Bul-
lelin:

Grinnell College exists to achieve these

nine purposes (the nine objectives as
slated on pages 20-21) which relate mast-
Iy to the kind of person the individual is
to become. The courses, examinations,
laboratories, term papers, sports, resi-
dence hall life, student. self-government—
ihe apparatus, in slum _ can be justified
only it they are instrumental toward these
goals,

If Grinnell is to maintain any direction to-
ward educating its students in future years,
it must first make Clear what it means by the
educational process, This facilitates both evalr
uarion of the success of the present program
and projection of luiure programs upon a pr8<
established standard. A definition of [he edu<
caiional process, its end and means, is now
necessary, not only for competent evaluation
of the residence hall system, but also lo
clarify areas of the Grinnell educational coin-
piex that are experiencing the same state of
chaos and confusion oi goals that it is. Educa-
tion needs to be spelled out in terms that will
justify [he disorganization of the lecture pro»
gram, that will dispel present dissatisfaction or
freshmen With the Humanities and Historical
Studies program, ihai will jusiiiy ihe lack bi
courses syllabi clearly explaining course con-
tent, protessors‘ expectations of mums, and
grading systems that will explain the lack of
experimentation to develop better meiiiods or
education, that will explain the objectives or
die admissions policies, [hat will explain, in
detail, the relationship of the student with his
iaculiy advisor and other facility members,
and that will explain the lack of a vigorous
course evaluation program,

We recognize that n is not your task is set
fourth educational goals of the college. We
believe, however, that in the absence of such
a directive, any policy recommendations you
might make would be irrelevant and meaning.
less, Convmced that useiul change comes only
through an understanding oi the problem, and
that understanding IS gained only dimugh
sound mcibcdology, we urge that instead, you
make procedural recommendations along the
lines he suggest,
