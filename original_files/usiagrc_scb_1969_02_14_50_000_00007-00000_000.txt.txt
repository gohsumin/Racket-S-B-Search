Gray Matter

By BILL GRAY

'Before beginning I would like
to apologize for the article
which appeared under my by-
line last week. I did indeed
write it but a goodly portion or
it tound its ilnal resting place on
the cutting room floor with the
ensuing result that much at its
traditional verve (you may have
another name tor it) was lost in
the editing. Hopeiully, lack oi
space will no longer necessitate
the deletion of some of the more
noteworthy passages.

Returning to the assigned top-
ic, Dibble, Off»Campus and
(gasp) the Faculty, established
themselves as the teams to beat
in the “A” division at LM. bas-

ketball. All are undefeated with
half of the season gone. Clark,
for some unfathomable reason,
is undefeated in the ' ” sec-
lion.

Last Friday the freshmen de-
feated a team of I. M. all-stars
(1’) by the score of 66-59. John
Winterson (Dibble) scored 21 to
lead the Murry Finelson
coached stars. Highlight of the
game was a dislocated shoulder
administered by R. B. Weeks to
Dave Cassel in a ireak mishap.
It might be noted that Weeks is
showing no effects of his layoff.
A rematch is set for Friday
night, February 23 in Darby
Gym.

1. M. bodyrexposing took the
center stage this week with a
match in Gates lounge; it was
quickly iotlowed by l. M. vom-
iting.
