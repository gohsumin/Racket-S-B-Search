In the past, damages whlcli
could not be assessed to individ-

will "review all-campus or other
unusual damages” and recom-

No Problem on Norlh Campus
Say Two—Thirds of Respondents

An 5&3 survey about the now-under-considera
tion North Campus Problem revealed that about two
out of three students don’t think there is such a
problem.

The survey, distributed last Friday, drew 473
responses and oi those responding, 150 said there
was a North Campus Problem and 292 said there
wasn’t. That represents about 615 per cent re-
spending saying that there is no problem.

Respondents were given nine possible problem
areas and were asked to indicate which of these
they thought were of such magnitude that they
warranted campus-wide attention.

Thirtyrfour per cent indicated that the problem
oi property damage needed attention. That was
the largest area or concern oi the students answer-
ing the survey.

Those filling out the survey were asked their re-
action to three possible solutions put forward by
the Executive Council. Those suggestions to be
rated were freshmen halls, room drawings on
North Campus similar to those on South Campus
and a system of administrationappointed and paid

student rulerenforcers. All three were firmly re~
jected by the students as not being beneficial to
the college community.

The reaction to freshmen halls was 430 - 29
against. The reaction to the room drawings pro-
posal was 324-109 against. The reaction to paid rule
enforcers was 412-53 against.

The other problem areas noted by students were
privacy in balls (25.5 per cent), noise levels in halls
(27 per cent), mobility on North Campus (25 per
cent), lack of an academic atmosphere on North
Campus (24 per cent), and lack of rule enforcement
by student officers (21 per cent).

The 150 students who said that there was a North
Campus Problem listed me lack of an academic
atmosphere on North Campus as the biggest prob-
lem (61 per cent cited that as a problem). Mobility
on North Campus and property damage was the
next largest concern of this group (53 per cent
noted this area as a problem).
