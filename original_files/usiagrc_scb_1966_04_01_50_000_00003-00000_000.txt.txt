neighborhood where the average
eighth grader is sixteen.

Later in Chicago nineteen oth-
ers descended upon the Parish or
the Holy Convenant to learn about
the real world there.

In Chicago they went on neigh-
borhood ‘pliinges” —- set out on
their own and met the people. Ups
town one group of mods went
apartment hunting and were told
that decent girls like you shouldn‘t
want to live here. In Woodlawn a
store proprietor said he had to
get away cause “they" were malt-
ing a crook of him. And in the
groceries, one could buy pig’s leei,
greens, lungs. and “mountain oys-
lers” (the sex organs or a male
pig).

They heard Martin Luther King
speak at a meeting or landlords
and tenants lrl East Fail‘field Park
and held hands to sing “We Shall
Overcome." They visited a police

station and mét the chaplain who'

swore a lot because the rlrily way
he could lunction elleetively was
to take it and give it.

They heard Michael Harrington,
who wrote The Other America and
“started” the War on Poverty,
speak to the Independent Voters oi
Illinois about the politics of povere
ty and his hopes tor a third party.
They Visited the Robert Taylor
Homes, high rise apartments that
have a sanitation problem because
a little kid playing on the swings
has to go up nineteen lloors baa
tore he can go to the bathroom,

Again in St. Lnuis it was the
people 7 the little old lady crying
because she was Sick and couldn’t
pay her medical bills; the little
girl with an infected eye and
bandaged hand for the bums site
received when the family stove EXA
ploded in from oi her. There was

a mother in a lilthy apartment
who worried about her unemployed
husband and her lourteenyear-old
son Wl’iD had a ”nervous condi-
tlon” which the school authorities
refused to cope with, who was not
unintelligent enough to be placed
in a retarded class, and who was
out selling bottles to earn money.
And there was Sammy. the eight
year old rctardate who was al-
ways tearing through Grace Hill
House. ‘

There was the St, Louis Fetlerau
tion of Settlement Houses meeting.
tlle chief topic of which was the
problem presented by the Office
of Economic Opportunity in its at-
tempt to construct new facilities
a law blocks away tram eslair
lished agencies that had been
serving ncighborhoods tor sixty
years. There was the Visit to a
Pentecostal Service in a store
front church where a chart re-
ported that attcndance the week
belore had been 38 and the col-
lection $5.73, To make “the young
people" feel at home they asked
the students to sing a hymn in
from of the congregation as their
own personal witness to Christ —
and they did, “The Battle Hymn
of the Republic,” just about [ha
yonly one they knew, Safely back
iin their seats, leailng through the
paperbook pentecostal hyninal,
they c uld see the vital iunctiun
or reli on lor these people as
they rea :

This world is not my home

rni just a passing through

My treasures are laid up

I ﬁxed up with Jesus forty
years ago

know He'll take me though

I'm weak and poor

And I can't feel at home

in this world anymore

0 Lord you know I have no
triend like you

ll heaven’s not my home their
Lord what Will 1 d0.

Leaving the service, one of the
students perhaps expressed the
impact at the whole inner my
experience when he said, “I'vc
never needed a cigarette so much
in my lite."
