Wilkinson blames HUAC for crisis;

calls for the end

Frank Wilkinson, a leader of
a campaign to abolish the
House Lin-American Activities
Committee, spoke Tuesday at a
cotiee hour sponsored jointly by
the National Student Associa-
tion, the program in Practical
Political Education, Young Re-
publicans and the Young Demo—
crats.

Wilkinson, a strong advocate
of civil liberties, stated that the
purposes and actions of the
HUAC were directly opposed to
the principles of the First
Amendment. This is the fundav
mental issue of the abolition
campaign.

Every idea, especially a dis.
senting one, has a right to be
heard, emphasized Wilkinson.
Only subversive acts should be
punished

WILKINSON STATED t h a t
the present world situation, par-
ticularly the Cuban crisis, was
caused by a stifling of diver»
gent ideas and opinions. He
branded the HUAC as an organ
tor suppressing this dissent.

Wilkinson gave a brief history
of the HUAC which included its
becoming a permanent commr

tee of the House of Representa—
tives in 1945. The rirst major
opposition to the HUAC came
14 years later from James Roos-
evelt in a speech in Congress
and a petition to abolish the
HUAC signed by 1300 people.

Great en ism and opposie
6011 to the HUAC arnse when
its behavior became more
widely known thrnugh the
movie, «Operation Abolition."

Opposition has continued to
increase and Wilkinson express-
ed the hope that, if his cam~
paign continues successfully,
when Congress convenes on
Jan. :3, the representatives of

the people will stand up for
their Convictions. a n d the
HUAC will be dissolved.

WILKINSON ALso recom—
mended the reading of critic-
ism of the McCaren Act and the
internal Security Act. He con»
siders these the grossest invas-
ions ot thought control in
American history. He asserted

The Spot to hit
is 10’s

of suppression

that they contradict the basis of
American guverm’neni.

Wilkinson appealed for bipar—
tisan understanding and support
of his campaign. He remarked
that he appreciated being the
guest of both the YR'S and
YD’S.

Wilkinson appeared betore the
HUAC in Atlanta, Georgia, in
1953. He reiused to answer its
question, and was convicted on
a charge of contempt of court.
He was released early this year
after completing part of his
one year sentence.
