Communist speaker Ruben views ;
youth's Woes in Marxist framework

By Cal Collier

l
Dan Rubin, editor of ”Comrl
inunist Viewpoint" and a mem-
ber of the executive cabinet of
the Progressive Youth Organiz—l
ing Committee, spoke before a‘
group of students and faculty in
ARH Auditorium Tuesday
Speaking on the topic, “15 Mai ,
ism Youth's Answer7,” Rubin}
outlined the problems facing
American youth and Lhen.'of-l
fer-ed causes and solutions tor,
them. i
Denying the assertion that,
most problems people face al'e‘
personal. he suggested that a:
direct connection exists between
our problems and our “capital.
society," Rubin said that one,
of our major problems, the cold,
war. is attributable to our so-i
ciety which is ’controlled byl
monopolists, i
Concentrating on the- cold want
he asserted that this Situationl
"produces tensions" in the mindsl
of young people and might have
a bearing on juvenile delinquen-l
cy. The cold war, he said. also;
deters funds which could be:
used for social welfare pro-l
grams, federal works projectsi
and federal recreation programs.
Rubin pointed out that the
cold war also instigates a seri-‘
ous threat to civil liberties.
Rubin said that the causes
of these problems can be found.
in ”the ‘very nature of the’
capital system." He singled outl
“giant monopolists" as strugglw
ing successfully to continue the.
cold war, suppress Negroes, and‘
foster ultl‘arright wing groups.
Portraying the U.. as an1
aggressor nation, Rubin stated
that our weapons are primarily-l
offensive and the Sot t Union's;
are primarily defensive. l
Rubin suggested a number oil
courses to be taken to promote
reform within the capitalist
system. Stating that. "headwayl
can be made to expand dem-l
o acy," he urged reform or
civil rights laws. unemploys‘
inent compensation laws. and‘
laws dealing with subversives.
Rubin said that in their
search for economic survival
American youth confronts the
"reactionary iiioiiopolists" ‘much
the same as the working man
does, Rubin said that youth
should consider the working
man as their ally Acting as dis
has, he asserted. certain nece
cssary reforms can be won as
concessions from the monopo»
lists.
liubin went on to briefly sug,
gest some of the obstacles fac-
ing those interested in reforms
In the civil rights area he sin
gled out the concept of “white
supremacy" as the most dangerr‘
bus, and in thc cit-ll liberties
area he contended that “the ma»
jor obstacles to all social pro-
gress are those people who be-
lieve that all communists are
Russian agents. .
Rubin concluded by singling
out various types 01' organize
lions which he feels are woi
ing towards an expansion of
democracy. Amon these he
listed the» “single issue groups,"
groups which limit their atten—
tion to a single field like civil
rights. civil liberties, and peace
He also mentioned the need for
"left wing oi-ganiaataons" and
"Radical Marxist groups” which
coulr “stimulate thought" among

Bowen worried by ‘slippage'
of stutlent concern for others

By Richard Ohleineyei‘
5&3 Asst. News Editor

Grinnoll College President
Howard R Bowen. in an ad-
dress delivered to the Student
Senate Wednesday, discussed
the reasons why the college ad-
{0615 that rule
changes u-ouid not be in order
at this time.

Specifically dealing with the
two rules that have been most
recently criticized by students.
the drinking rule and the wom»

in sampling student opinion he
has found attitudes ranging from
“authoritarian to anarchistic,"
ne expressed disappointment
in what he termed “a gradual
, slippage in the concern of stu-
i dents for the community and
l ior each other." He cannot
l complain, he said. about the
. earnest, hard work of Grin-
‘ neliians, nor about their aca-
‘ deniie honesty, nor their con-
, corn for politics. But he said
l such is not the case when “we
examine our social responsibil—
‘ ity and concern for the com—
; munity."
1 President Bowen reminded the
lsenators that the reputation of
‘the college is important to all
lot the students, graduates. trus—
llecs, faculty and other employ
,ees. The reputation has surfered.
the said, because of recent dis.
lcuss‘lon about women's hours
land the drinking rule. which has
:appeared in the Scarlet & Black.
5 “AT THIS TIME," President
gBowen suggested, ”students
,‘Sliould not be talking about
tchanging any rules. Rather they.
fshould take stock of themselves}

Di: Bowen then brought his
remarks to a close by calling fort
discussion on “What is a reason.

j in a brief history, Dr. Botw g

, The drinking rule at that time
'was enforced by administrative
personnel with the help of the
,Council of House Presidents. The
Dean of Men patrolled the halls
'and looked in rooms for bottles

‘situation did not promote rapport
between administrative officers

‘and Students.

the continued. Since that time
there has been a gradual slack.
lening of enter-cement. .

Other rules which have been
changed during the adminisll‘ar
tion of President Bowen are the

tear rule and the library rules.
Until scvcral years ago library
stacks were closed to students.
Rifles against smoking have
been maintained in some build-
ings because of the difficulties
of housekeeping and the danger
of tire. While there is no ad-
ministrative rule about pre ing,
the administration is deﬁ itely
against it on the grounds that
lprepping restricts the freedom
of those being prepped.

Some improvements that have
been made in the condition of
the campus were also mentioned
by the presidcnh Sidewalks have
been built and grass has been
planted. The campus, he pointed
out, has been transformed from
a patch of mud and weeds to a
place of some beauty,

From Jrlle President:

Since my remarks to the

lenders oi student government

on November 26 and to the
Student Senate on December
5, I have been asked: What
did you really mean?

What i meant was that 'n
the area of conduct and citi—
zenship, it is time for Gzinnell
students to be thinking about
their responsibilities as well
as their freedoms. to be con»
sidering the welfare and good
mate of the college as well
as their personal convenience.

I asked that the entire stile
dent body engage in a respon-
sible discussion of the student
way of life. This discussion
would be a prelude to any

further consideration of
changes in rules. I pointed
out that the basic objective
or this discussion should be
a consjdelgd deﬁnition of rea-
sonable norms of behavior for
a group of gifted studmits
who are destined to be future
leaders in American society,
Once our students (and tac-
ulfyl have considered this is—
sue, and have reached some
consensus as to what constit-
tutes an acceptable way of
life at Grinneil in the 1960’s.
then we shall be in a better
position to consider rules and
procedures of enforcement.
