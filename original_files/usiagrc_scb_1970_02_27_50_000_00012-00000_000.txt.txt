Grapplers Grobbed In Double
Dual Meet By Carleton, Olafs

By John Nigel Pepper

Saturday's double dual meet
pitted Grinnell against Carleton,
and Cornell against Carleton and
St. Olaf. Although the Grinnell
wrestlers lost twice, there were
many outstanding individual per-
formances.

Our first meet against the Carls
of Carleton started with Chuck
Farr winning on a forfeit,
Although we had to forfeit the
125, pound division because
Biown isa transfer student, Mike
wrestled a brilliant exhibition
match, His aggressiveness and
agility led to his pinning his
opponent early in the match.
Mike Brown is sure to be a boon
to next year’steam.

Then both Derek Feilbert and
Henry Corona were pinned in the
early part of their matches. Next
came Klippel’s exciting match.
After almost getting pinned and
almost pinning his opponent,
Mason lost by one point. Even
though Dave Petta fought age
gressively, he was pinned by the
Carleton wrestler.

Jim Weiser’s match followed.
Marked by very cautious
wrestling, Weiser managed to tie
his opponent. Then came
Washington Alston’s fantastic
contest. Overpowering his op-
ponent, Washington pinned him
in the last period, using a halts
nelson, Washington pinned his
adversary to the mat. Counting
the three Grinnell forfeits, the
final score of the meet with
Carleton was 35 to 12, Carleton
winning.

The second meet, about a half
hour later, pitted Grinnell
against St. Olaf. The meet was
marked by many close decisions
with Grinnell at the short end.
In the 116 pound weight class,
Farr lost to an agile wrestler,
o to 2. Later Farr puffed, “They
were just in better shape.”
Brown lost 3 to 4, in a close and
very hardrought match. Derek
Feilbert put out a great effort,
but was Iinally pinned in_the last
period. Then came that “Miami
Flash," llenry Corona. Henry
fought well and avoided the pin,
but lost7t<i o.

The next Wrestler was Mason
Klippell, the dean of the Grinnell
wrestlers. Almost sustai ng an
injury, Mason still dominated his
match and outepointed his ops
ponent. After Klippel was Dave
Petta’s close match. Although he
lost by 4 to 2, Dave showed a
lot of class against a powerful
adversary. Only a couple of
seconds riding time made the
difference, but Jim Weiser lost
to the St. Olaf wrestler by 2 to
I. To say the least, Weiser was
chagrined.

Since St. Olaf had no wrestlel
at 191, they forfeited that
division. Washington Alston, our
191, wrestled an Olaf
heavyweight. In his own inimita-
ble style, Washington controlled
the match with power, speed, and
agility. The score of his match
was 5 to 1, and imagine - he’s
only a freshman! When all of the
Grinnell forfeits were tallied, the
score stood 36 to B in St, Olaf's
favor.

With the Conference meet
coming up in two weeks, Grinnell
has some wrestlers who could
score points, Coach Hunt picks
Farr, Klippel, Weiser, and Alston
as wrestlers who should place in
the tournament. Hunt also thinks
one of the other Grinnell matmen
may provide some surprises at
the Conference meet. The meet
is scheduled for the 5th and 6th
of March at Galesburg, the home
of Knox College. Good luck to

those hearty Grinnell wrestlers.

Tonkmen Triumph,

Tctke New Trophy
By Reggie Graham

Augustana, one of the toughest
small college teams in the
midwest, was beaten in its own
Viking Olympics this year, an
event unprecedented in the eight
years of the meet‘s existence.
The invitational event pitted the
Grinnell Swimming squad
against four non-Conference

(schools, Loras, Rockford,

o’rLuther, and Augustana. A great
team effort and the season’s best
second»half performance
provided our swimmers with a
rewarding victory (and a nice big
trophy).

Bruce Rollins broke records in
the 50 and the 100 to take both
events. Steve Ward took second
in that 100 to add to Grinnell
pointage and team morale.
Steve‘s individual medley was
only .1 second off the school
record.

Mike Daley won the zoo and
finished second in the 500 to set
a new school record. Further out-
standing performances were
turned in by Jim Williams in the
individual medley and the butter-
fly, and by Hal Dale in the same
event,

Don Lilike overcame a bad
board and worse judging to win
a very important first place in
diving competition Only a costly
error in counting laps prevented
John McBlain from capturing
second place in the 1,000.

The team spirit in evidence,
along with the victory at Rock
Island, helps provide the fire that
the team needs against Cornell,
This meet is certain to be the
toughest of the season, and will
determine the winner of the
“Dilly the Duck" award for the
team with the best dual meet
record. We’re up with a grudge
to settle a onerpoint loss to Corr
nell last year. We would also like
to beat last year’s champs and
win “Dilly,"

The season closes with the Con-
ference meet March a and 7 at
Carleton.

Clique-Cleave in Second Confrontation

By Sigiottenbach
“r acuity cagers Gurofi‘, Horton
and Hunt sparked the faculty to
an easy defeat over the Con-
cerned Black Students on Sunday
night." That is not, in fact what
happened. But it is always wise,
when you cover a sporting event,
to go with one good phrase in
your head, if nothing else, This
one pleased me especially, so I
was suitably devastated when the
faculty had the effrontery to
falsify it. (So much for a Liberal
Education: it seems. gentlemen,
that my ideas just aren't as good
as yours. Still, they are mine,
which is more than you can say.)

Actually the phrase was pretty
much ad hoc, and More In Sorrow
Than In Anger. I spent most of
Sunday afternoon thinking about
hooking someone to cover the
game, even going so far as to
check my staff for someone to
do it. However, I got a wrong
number. so this was to no avail,
I did see my staff at the game
however, and she lent me a pen
with which to take notes.

Anyhow, when the Sunday Staff
Meeting rolled around (“What
did you think of it Harry? Dunno
Lloyd, I haven’t read it yet.")
I was still Without a writer. So
Editor Harry Fulton sternly
dispatched me to the game,
barely giving me time to snatch
up my Junior Executive Legal
Pad and to torget my pen. Gird»
ing my syntax for a frightfully
dull event, I never expected this
opportunity to tell you to your
great surprise that it was . . .
a dull event.(frightfully so,
really).

From the outset, I found that

» my Sportswriters’ Phrasemaker
was scarcely equal to the one
casicn. Fortyrthree people just
don't make for local color, after
all. Hardly “a 'packed and
cliecring house", and by no
stretch of the imagination “a

not even ”a small, but appreciar

for “twenty-seven people and a

Couldn't find this one in the
Phrasemaker, so I was forced to
piece it together from some old
Spiro Agnew campaign speeches,
the 1952 Report of the Grand
Army of the Republic (Northwest
South Dakota Division), and
selections from the Oxford
English Dictionary. One can only

As for the High Polnts of the
game: Roy Lewis fell off the CBS
bench late in the second period,
and Ray Horton spent five con
secutive minutes on his feet, CBS
immediately protested, but
pretty soon Horton was back on
the floor again and all were
satisfied. Actually, the game was
generally friendly: the CBS
players came up with the
sweetest smiles you ever did see
when it somehow transpired that
a faculty player was touled,
Washington Alston, wrestling at
191 1b., put in an especially fine
performance in this respect. (I
sent Photographer Harry Fulton
down court for some “rebound
scramble under the net” shots.
but they Say he will be back in
action again as soon as the bones
set and they find a way to get
the camera out ofhis ear.)

I'm sorry, ians, but I didn't
have the heart to reach the
coaches tor comment after the
game. Final: Faculty 54, CBS 46,
3 dead, 17 injured.

Next Week; Open Swimming,
vespers in Herrick Chapel. and
turther thrilling adventures of
thelunior Executive Legal Pad.
