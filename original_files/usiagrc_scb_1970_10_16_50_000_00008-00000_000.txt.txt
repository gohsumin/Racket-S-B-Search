Can we do it? After four
league outings, Grinnell's
stalwart eleven, the hippie
Pioneers, have checkmated
their opponents thrice. The
three trump cards have been
dealt to Coe, Lawrence, and
Carleton in Grinnell’s sans
ctum sanctorum, beautiful
Ward Field, overlooking the
picturesque Unfinished Gym
Complex; Grinnell was aced
by Monmouth on a foreign
field of endeavor.

Grinnell’s triumphs (and, in-
deed, the sole momentoftheir
undoing) have each been mars
ked by closeness. Grinnelldes
feated Coe by less than a
touchdown (while scoring only
one touchdown, themselves)
as telling defensive plays
made the day.

Close competition entertain-
ed the multitudinous fans ags
alnst Lawrence as Grinnell

won by a naked two points.
This time Grinnell had to
come from behind, and then
hang on, to pull out their se-
cond victory.

Against Carleton, Grinnell
had (eventually) an easy time
of it. Bad hands and an inter-
ception caused the offense to
sputter in the first half, but
the Pioneers held a soiree in
the second half as they finally
overcame the hapless Qirles
ton team 3377.

Against Monmouth Grinnell’s
offense could muster little,
and two touchdowns alongwith
the referees proved too great
an obstacle to overcome as
the Pioneers lost 1376.

A puissant defense appears
to be the key this year, as it
was laSt year. The offense,
led by "Gorgeous”sGary J07
hnson and "Fireplug" Mario,
appears unable to score con-

sistently on its own shadow.
The defense, however, led by
"Clothesline" Alston, who
hangs his opponents out to
dry, "Bubble" Barry Huff,
who just sort of wanders thr-
ough the interference, and
"Darling” Bill Dicks, whose
hands have already found a
number of arrant aerials, ap*
pears capable of stopping any
assailant. Nevertheless, any
defense can be erroded when
it plays three quarters per
game.

The offense may go, hoiw
ever. Head Coach Edd BowV
ers is holding sophomore
"Marvelous" Marty Gilllehan
in reserve. He is currently
gaining invaluable experience
in the defensive secondary.
Gilliehan has provedhis worth
by coming in against Carlee
ton in the fourth quarter and
firing two touchdown strikes.
All in all, if the offense mn
learn to score consistently,
even against good opponents,
and if the defense can continue
to hold up, the Grinnell Pion—
eers should not remain the
underrated team they appear
to have become. '

Soccer Team To Play Beloit;
New Coach Organiles Old Team

Beloit College is this weeks
end’s opponent for the spiri-
ted Grinnell soccer team.The
game is in the prime time
spotlight Saturday at 1:30 for
the football team is traveling
to Cornell. Beloit is rumored
to have a good team so it
should prove to be an inte~
resting contesti

Despite a surprising number
of crippling injuries, medical
school interviews, high school
homecomings and Jewish holir
days, the Grinnell soccer
squad has managed to post a
3.1 record so far this year.
The first game proved to be
a warmsup, as the pioneers
trounced a talented but very
inexperienced team from Ce-
ntral College, 571. The next
weekend at Knox, the Grin*
nellians fell prey to a rough
field and an accurate short
passing attack on the part of
.the Siwashes. Tom Lincoln
and Steve Hirshon managed
to ram in second half goals
to bring Grinnell to a come
from-behind 2-1 victory at
Monmouth the next weekend

IMCO ER

Grinnell's IM football sea
son seems to lack something
this year; enough teams, ens
ough referees and enough cons
trol over the cretins of the
gridiron: Clark, OC, and
North. The season is lacking
a great deal of organization
in that halls cannot find the
fields upon which they are
supposed to scrimmage. And
even if they do find the field,
the poorly paid referees do
not.

This year, there is only a
four-team league, essential-
ly. Clark, without their leass
hes, is a match for the fresh-
man team with pads. Read,
who is also undefeated and
truely the only gentlemen of
the game, have found their
way in spite of Coach School-
er. 0C is composed of Grin-
nell’s answer to Ohio State;
they really get "high" for
their games. And North, the
“soul squad," have fought
diligently, behind or ahead.
The intelligence award this
year goes to the Cleveland
Langan team. After Clark
dismembered the West Norr
ris, Squad (7) 7076, Clever
lanerangan alertly decided
not to show up. .

On the tennis scene, the pa,
wers are Read and West.
Read because of their talent,

Harriers Harrass Opponents

A Conference Championship
appears in the realm ofpossis
bilities, as the Cross- Country
team proceeds through the
1970 campaign. Led by head-
jogger Eric Jahn andhis side~
kick “Shortcut” McGrath, the
team has gone unscathed thr-

ough the dual meet season and-

finished a “high" third in
their “nemesis", the Les
Duke Invitational. Fallen in
their tracks have been teams
of C06, Graceland, William
Penn, Monmouth, and . . .
Faith Baptist Bible College
(7). The "thinnies" were spin
ked by Augustanna andSt. Olaf
in our home spectacular.

Experience is the key to their
success with six upperclass-
men in the ranks. Besides the
dynamic duo, there is Jon
Stein, Oscar Rattenborgi John
Russel and Doug Mendenhall,
who does alright for a pole
vaulter. Prep power is sup-
plied by Phil Frank and Rusty
Dawson. The loss of senior

Tim Power due to a painful
injury is noted as a loss to
the overall power (7).

In spite of competition from
some nutty professors and
humiliation by Coach O'sninth
grade son, these young men
insist that they will finish in
one of the top two spots in the
finale. Top challenger to their
possible pinnacle position in
the conference is St. Olaf.
Thank goodness Augustana is
not in our conference. ..

The Pioneers returned home
for the Parent's weekend ga-
me, mecting an alwaysrtough -
Cornell squad at 11:00 in the
morning. A small but excited
group of spectators were tbs
rilled to a rough contest, wh—
ich Grinnell led 170 at half
time. The game was tied late
in the second period, before
Tom Lincoln was fouled in
front of the Cornell goal, and
then scored on the resulting
penalty shoti Lincoln added
an insurance goal a few minv
utos later and the final score
read Grinnell 3, Cornell 1.

Coach Keith Fisher has been
bringing the team along slow-
ly, trying to avoid any more
inJuries. This is thefirstyear
since 1964 that soccer has
been a varsity sport, and the
players seem to be responds
ing well under a real coach
and better treatment from the‘
athletic department. The
team’s record for the past
two years, playing basically
the same schedule has been,
