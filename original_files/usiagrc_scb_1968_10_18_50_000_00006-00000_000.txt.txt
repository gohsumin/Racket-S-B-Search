Biology Department Plans Research Projects

Members of the Biology De-
partment, with the aid and so
tive Involvement of students,
are currently engaged in many
research projects. Extensive use
of various equipment is being
made, including the use of com-
puters to analyze data.

Kenneth Christiansen, chain
man at the department, spent
last year at the Laboratoil'e

Souterrain in the French Pyre-
nees studying the evolution of
collembola, a minute insect
tound in the soil. He is especial-
1y interested in the cave forms
in which the special environv
nient allows the observation or
several evolutionary stages at
the same time. He also spent

some time last summer in
Texas studying the difference
between cave and suriace forms
of coilemboltl.

On leave this year is La-
Verne Durkee, who is living in
SL Louis, Missouri. He is work
ing both in the Botanical Gar—
dens and at the University sins
dying the evolutionary procesA
ses oi the pollen of a large plant
iamiiy.

Waldo Walker is using an
electron microscope to study
the ultra»structul'e of lower
plant ionns. He recently spent
a sabbatical year doing re-
search at the University oi Bri<
tish Columbia.

on a biochemical genetic study
of iruit ﬂies for his doctorate.

Mrs. Sharon Delong and Miss
Mary Taylor are new members
of the department. Their field is
niycology. the study of fungi.

Population ecology of house
mice is the specialty of Karl

Open Dorms Upset
Smiih Sophomore ,-
Tronsfer lmpends

The Scarlet and black has
learned that a girl student is
considering transfer from the
college because the open dorm
situation established by stu-
dents on her floor of Smith l-lall
became an intolerable living
situation for her, None of her
appeals tor a change, which

were taken all the way to the
President, have yet been an<
lwered to her satisfaction.
Although o t h e r, personal,
reasons are involved in the
case, there seems to he no
doubt that the atmosphere and

incidents arising (mm the
opens on Smith Second were
the determining factor in thin
student's decision to move 1mm
Smith Hall, and, probably,
transfer to another college M
the end of this semester.
Other students from Smith
Hall are disturbed about the
situation, and have gone to both
the resident advisor and the
Dean concerning it. Accordin
to Mrs. Low some oi the other
students are also “thinking at
leaying," but have made no de'
cisions at any kind as yet.
Discussions concerning their
sitllation have been going on at
Smith at all levels, accoidiiig

,to the house President, Merryil

Penson, Miss Adix, and Mrs,
Low, Dean LOW told the Scarlet
and Black that she "will Corp
tinue to work on it until weirq
assured they (Smith residents)
are satisfiedr"
