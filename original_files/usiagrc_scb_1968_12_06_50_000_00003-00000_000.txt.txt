then charged by the civil
authorities with unlawful as-

immediately after the take
over. the Executive Council of
Cornell’s Trustees met and di-
rected the President to expel
all the students involved in the
takeover. Cornell's taculty met
in the afternoon at the takeov-
er, and asked the Trustees to
change the punishment to sus-
pension, with each student giv-
en a chance to have a trial, Stu<
dents Involved in the case were
allowed to return to classes as
soon as their trials came up,
and no student missed more
than a week of classes. The
sum of the individual trials
lasted 81 hours over a six
week period, and were con-
cluded November 24.

Cornell Dean of Men Robert
Hooker told The Scarlet and
Black in a telephone interview
that the 73 Students involved in
the takeover were found guilty
of Violating the college's code

or dissent. According to Mr,
Hooker, this is an “action that
would normally warrant sus—
pension," bur, because at the
motives of this action. the sus-
pensions were suspended. The
students were placed on disch
plinary probation tor the rest
or this year. This means that
they cannot hold an oilice or
represent the college in any at-
ficial way during this time.
Disciplinary probation, how-
ever, ls temporary and will not
go on their academic trans-
cripts.

The hearings ln civil court tor
the otienses began Tuesday,
December 3. College Vice Presi<
dent Charles Cochran told the
5&8 “we (the Administration)
haven’t considered“ dismissing
the civil charges, since “They
(the protesters) broke a civil
rule and a college rule," and
since there might be diiliculty
in dismissing the charges. Mr.
Cochran stressed that the stu-
dents be charged With the minl~
mum Ollense, unlawful assenr

tence oi iive years, was also a
possible charge. The Scarlet
and Black learned, however,
from talks with local ofﬁcials,
that unlawful assembly is the
normal charge in cases oi this
nature, and that iorceahlc entry
would be charged in only the
rarest of cases.

An ad hon Presidential Ad-
visory Committee, on the prob-
lems of black students at Cor-
nell was recently created by
President stumpi. The commit-
tee, whose membership includes
iour iaculty members (including
one part time black instructor),
three administrators, five black
students, and five Wluze slur
dents, has had (our meetings
since its iorlnation after the
takeover oi the building, and
plans to make some recommen-
dation to the President when
their work IS done.

Cornell Dean of Students
Stuart Good told the Scarlet and
Black that there has been a
“great deepening of awareness
of the deep problems that black
students lace" since the take
over of Old Sem.

guests ior breakiast, lunch, and
supper. They had a housekeep-
er wllo did most of the cooking,
but when it was very busy Mrs.
Nollen helped.

Among the visitors during the
Nollen administration was {or-
mer President Harry s. Tru-
man, then a Congressman. Mr.
Truman was awarded an honor
any degree by Grinnell College
_. the ﬁrst college degree he
had ever received. That degree
still hangs in the Harry s.
Truman Library in indepen-
dence. Missouri. Mr. Truman
again visited Grinnell a few
years ago as a P.P.P,E. lec-
turer and made a famous mis<
step on the porch oi Grinnell
House where he stayed. The
picture oi Mr. Truman iallen
in the shrubbery was carried
by national Wires.

Mrs. Nollen remembers dis-
tinctly another iamous guest
whom the Nollens entertained.
Rabbi Weiss, one of the found-
ing iathers oi lsrael, once Vis<
ited Grinnell with his daughter.
The meal which the Nollens
served was a sumptuous ham
dinner. “We'd completely tor-
gotten," said Mrs. Nollen. “The
interesting thing was that
Rabbi Weiss did eat the ham.
although his daughter reiused
graciously."

During its history, Grinnell
House has been the scene of
many recitals by Grinnell fae~
nlty members and several ia-
mous musicians. Mrs. Nollen
purchased the piano which
stands in the South Lounge 0!
the Forum for the house when

she lived there. Often, as many
as two hundred people would
enjoy the marvelous acoustical
properties or the home.

The Presidents who occupied
Grinnell House were John H.
T. Main, 1917-31; John S. Nai-
len, 1931-40; Samuel N. Stevens.
1940-54; and Howard Bowen,
195561. Belore 1917 Mr. Main
resided in the Little House, and
after 1961 Mr. Bowen lived In
the new Presidential house.

Since 1961, the Grinnell House
has served as a social center.
a concert hall, a meeting place
ior the Trustees, and a sleep-
ing quarters ior guests at the
college, including prospective
students. The guest register in
the {font lobby Contains the
names oi Barry Goldwater and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Grinnell House has more
memories imbedded in it than
these. It was also the private
home or the Presidents whose
personal memories do not be-
long, all or them, on these
pages. Perhaps someday some
one will write of the Grinnell
House as Maud Little Macy did
of the Little House when it was
razed in 1917. The iollowing ap<
peared in the Grinnell Herald
Register on March 16, 1917.

”When the walls or the ark
cient structure were laid law
last summer, and the deal-
home vanished utterly irom
the earth. did not a great cloud
oi memories, oi hopes, of as-
pirations, and to some extent
recollections of the joys at
worthy achievement imbedded
in or bound up with its his
and history, ﬂy homeless from
its ruin.”
