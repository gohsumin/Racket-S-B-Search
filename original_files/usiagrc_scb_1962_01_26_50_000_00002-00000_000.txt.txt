Back to the fold

Every year about this time the old and embittered exA
editor sits down, and with sustenance provided by the
journalistic muse, Jim Beam, writes a few inSlpld sentences
in way of reflection and adieu. >

We are not sorry about the words which made our
opponents see “ref," nor are we weeping boxcars over the
occasional pained expressions we have brought to our
friends who are always radically right. Our job has been
to excite debate, allow confrontation of that debate and
occasionally draw some editorial conclusions to that debate.

The enterprise, however exciting, has not always been
an easy one, The college newspaper, contrary to popular
opinion, does not spring full grown from the ink spotted
breast of the editor on Friday mornings. It involves many
hours of work by many unpaid people, and a good deal of
effort on the part of editors, writers and columnistshproof-
readers, copy-readers, lied-writers, print-shop assistants
and the.like. To all of these, and the many faculty meme
bers, administration and friends who have pronded moral
support, we extend a sincere thank-you,

We are happy to turn over the office keys and the
editorial page to people as capable as Jim Hatfield, Larry
Smucker, Ken Schiff et al, In spite of a pleasant and en»
lightening experience, “We" are very happy to be “I" a-

gain,
Nancy rogcl

Grey matter

We have often heard the Scarlet and Black come un-
der fire for not giving adequate representation to “the
conservative opinion” on campus.

Our columns, it has been claimed, reflect only the
views of a few “ultra—liberals." Many times the number of
letters to the editor concerning a single issue weighs more
heavily towards ”the left."

To those who make these complaints we can only
point out that we have tried to obtain “conservative” opin-
ion pieces and have met with little response

In further effort to widen the scope of opinion pre-
Sented in the 38:13 we are reserving a column, “Grey Mat—
ter," to which we invite contributions i on any subject,
reflecting any opinion, Contributions must be typewritten,
doublespaced, not more than 1000 words and bear the name

of the author. '8. 1241 .

Next week, S. 1241, a bill authorizing the use of Fed-
eral funds for 1) rehabilitation and expansion of academic
facilities at U. S. colleges and universities and 2) grants
to the same or similar institutions for scholarship programs
is scheduled to come before the Senate. (A companion bill,
HR. 7215 will go to the House of Representatives)

While S. 1241 would seem to be a partial answer to
many an institution's financial ills it must be pointed out
that the scholarship portion of the bill is phrased as an
amendment to part of the National Defense Education Act.
If passed, the federal scholarship program would continue
to be viewed as an element of national defense and would
thus fall under loyalty oath and disclaimer affidavit regu—
lations of the NDEA.

Such a bill would likely never receive support by those
thirty colleges, including Grinnell, which have withdrawn
from the NDEA program. And it would probably not be
looked upon with favor by the additional 146 schools who
have publicly stated their disapproval of the disclaimer re-
quirement.

However, Senate bill 1241, because of its promise of
funds for campus expansion as well as grants for scholar-
ships, becomes, in our eyes, a much bigger redder apple from
the forbidden tree. And, should the bill be passed, we
sympathize with those schools who so badly need the funds
and who will be tempted to take them at the expense of
agreeing to the disclaimer clause.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Convolvulus

Ed note: Opinion columns by Ken Schilf and Larry Smuckcr
appear for the ﬁrst time in this week’s Scarlet and Black. They
will be regular or semirregular features of the 5&3 through-
out this semester and next. A title for Smucker‘s column is cur-

rently under deliberation by the author.
by Ken Schiff

Suddenly having the opportunv
ity to declare my opinion on
anything 1 pleasc is a very env
llghlcning experience. lFor the
first lime I am faced with the
possibility that i have no opinr
ions. At least I can‘t lhlnk of
thing to Say.
anything to say,

The past week has been a
search for a subject for this col-
umn, a scintillating, heretofore
uncunsldcrcd, and provocative
subject. The search was fruitless.
although 1 considered numerous
ideas: the role of the intellectual
in a nuclear holocaust, Horatio
Alger and his influence on A-
merican letters, a well-adiusted
sophomore class of malcontents,
Sheldon P. Zitner, pros and cons
of prepping, coffee hours on subv
Jects like “Can We Trust Floris
dd?” and ”The Liberal Arts Col»
lcgc in the Midst of Population
Explosion,” and volley ball I,M.’s

All these, however, failed to
satisfy me for one reason or
another. I even spent a morning
in the sen; cfflcc going through
lhc newspapers as far back as
the days of Naida Tushnet and
Doc Davenport to see if I could
learn from antiquity.

An easy way to avoid this
problem simply would he to
write a political column, but
this is exactly what I don't
want fa do. (in my very round
about manner, I have finally
arrived at my point.) 1 am can»
vinced that Hamlet is more
important tllfui a so megaton

fourteen Grinnell College slur
dcnls should fast for three days
on the Steps of the New York
Public Library to demonstrate
their support of J. D. Salinger's
Cultural Renaissance Race. But
in a time of crisis, such as new,
when people feel a great need
for immediate and extended ac-
tion, it is important that the
more elevated and aristocratic.
although somewhat practically
unuscful. factors of a person's
existence not be ignored. I think
we should all remember that
what we are trying lo preserve
is a culture ,not a political mechr
anism.

At the Washington group's cof-
fee hour last semester, the ldcc
for an intensive and extended
disarmament study group to in-
vestigate the problems of dis-
armament in its entire sccpc,
both pro and can, was suggested.
11. was mentioned that this would
be the ideal factor for all the
departments of a liberal arts eds
ucation to coalesce about, since
the consideration of lhls problem
involves political science, history,
nuclear physics. engineering,
chemistry, biology, psychology.
philosophy, the state of man, etc.

Although i agree with the plan,
i believe that this kind of rea-
soning is deadly to a liberal arts
education the purpose of which
is to broaden rather than direct
one's education. This may seem
like a fine point and perhaps it
is. But i am making a plea for

bomb and there are certainly
too few people aware of it.
This is not to say that I think

a de-emphasis cm the totally p0»
lltical approach to life which
prevails.

by Larry Smucker ,

Grllinell is in an experimenting mccd. People are restive.
This spirit pf embarrassment with the status quo erupted when
the faculty turned January’s bleak calendar into a “classless”
void, when 14 students trekked to Washington, D, c., and when
a small group of men ventured beyond the Sacrosanct confines
of hen-Gothic North campus to house elsewhere.

This quiet exodus is loaded with significance for that bovine
divinityrthe Grinnell hall system. Fulm-c policy on the issue of
off-campus housing will decide whether the arrangement is to
be more mature and flexible or whether the men's halls will re-
main Sacred fourvyear repositories fm‘ one’s scul.

Grinnell‘s strict onrcampus residence tradition was broken
last year when the admissions office miscalculated in accepting
freshmen. After an unsatisfactory experiment with female stuv
dents in the college’s first population explosion outlet—Park
Street, lhc administration felt that male students make better off-
campus surplus.

A few north campus refugees even wandered beyond Park
Street into the wide world of npcl-lmcnls. imlc and insistent
landlords and neighbors who rival even the most odious of
former hallmates. But these expatriates have found they like liv-
ing cff campus. There is quiet for study, cheaper room cost and
above all, more personal freedom.

For some college authorities the off—campus situation is temp.
ol'ai‘y; when the student body has been pared down to size, all
men will be placed again within'lhe belly of the sacred cow.

Proponents of a rigid hall system (where only the married or
emotionally infirm are allowed off campus argue that the ex-
oatriates abdicate their hall responsibility. If upperclassmen con-
tinue to move off, we are told, the hall system, whose success de-
pends on a Competent CofHP, will fail.

This line of reasoning is based on an assumption that has
hampered the hall system in the pascezhat one good and saintly
unfortunate must assume sole responsibility for hall sanity each
year. Th solution, if any really exists. is more delegation of
responsib ty, especially for the maintainance of order, among a
wider group of hall members. The house presidency and top
blouse council jobs should be opcn as far down as the sophomore
c ass.

My final word to hall purists is simply that any residence
system works more effectively on a voluntary rather than on a
coercive basis. The hall system has merit, but policies regarding
offrcampus “leakage" must be flexible. Let’s hope that antiquarian
notions of the system do not preclude further offrcampus experi»
mentation.

Jitters

To the Editor:

1 would greatly appreciate it
if you would publish the followV
mg letter I have addressed lo
your student body. 1 am a slug
dent also, attending Capital Radio
Engineering institute in Wash-
lngton, DC, and I am very m if
interested in our national affairs.

Three cheers for Grinnell
Ccllcgc, Gl'innell, Iowa. Hip.
Hip Hooray, Hi - Hip- Hooray,
Hip- Hl13~ Hooray. Students cf
Grinnell College, as a fellow stu.
dent, I salute you. The "Hunger
Strike" you recently staged in
cm- nation’s Capitol to protest
nuclear testing was a inarv ' s
thing.

You have shown yourselves to
be leaders in Ou)‘ nation. As you
were staging your “Hunger
Strike,” other schccls started
sending their students to our nae
lion’s Capital for the Same pur—
pose. Yes, 1 say again, this is
marvelous.

Yes. this is marvelous all
right. Marvelous for the Com-
mill-lists. This is just what they
want. Who do you think was
behind the incidents in South
America when Vice-President
Nixon was there, behind lhc
student protests in Japan that
kept r ident Eisenhower
from v ng that country?
The Communists, that‘s who.

It was reported in the Wash-
ington Post and Times Herald
that your entire student body
Went on n hunger strike for one
whole day and that the students
who were sent to Washington
were excused from their classes
by the faculty. Students of Grin—
nell, i don’t know who originate
ed this asinineidea,but rm Sure.
if you dig back far enough you
will find a Communist some-
where. i know this will be hard
to do because it probably oc-
curred that everybody on cam.
pus had the same idea of the
hunger strike all at once.

Am i right? The Communists
are sneaky that way. They am.
plant the idea and then drop
back and let somebody else Show
up with egg on their face.

If I didn‘t personally know
two of your students I would
have never heard of Grinnell
until your hunger strike, but
li‘om what I have gathered
from these people it appears
the average intellectual capa-
bil as are on a par with those
of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or
MIT. That is Why I was so
amazed when I heard about
this hunger strike.

Students of Grinnell, 1 plead
with you, let’s build America up
instead of tearing it down. it’s
really a good place to live, but
it won’t be fol~ long if you all
keep going at this rate.

in closing, 1 want to thank
you. I have heard rumors about
Communists infiltrating our col—
leges and universities, but i never
knew which ones. Now i know.
It’s the smaller ones where
they‘re starting. Do you honestly
believe the other schools follow—
ed your initiative? The Com-
munists had it all planned to look
that way, but it was all worked
out ahead of time. Your school
first, then the rest to lockd
the youth of America was up in
arms against our government
and cm- way of life.
