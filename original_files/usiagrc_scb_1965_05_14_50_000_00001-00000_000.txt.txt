Eisenhower Speaits Out at Press Conference

a, ,

By John Wolf

During a press conference that must certainly be coli-
sidered more satisfying than the school’s only other presi-
dential news conference former President Dwight Eisenhower
frankly answered questions on subjects from Viet Nam to
the 1968 presidential campaign to the American space pro<

ram.
g The conference was held yesterday afternoon in Robert!
Theatre, which was overflowing with more than 700 specta‘
tors and journalists ‘

The first question was from New York Times reporter
Felix Belair and concerned Eisenhower’s opinion of the
Viet Nam situation, and what side Eisenhower took in re-
gard to Ba Goldwater‘s statement that he authored the
present administration policy in Viet Nam.

Eisenhower said that at the time Goldwater made his sug.
gestions, they were a shock to the American public. “i do
agree that many things he recommended are now being done."_

“The only one single man in the United States who can
speak for us in foreign relations is the President of the United
States. If I or any other individual could recruit enough peo-
ple to make a significant inroad into the support he gets from
the United States in the Cl ical problems he has to face, it
would be doing a great disservice, because constitutionally he
has the power and we can’t do anything about it."

Because this is a critical period in America, Eisenhower
said, “I’ve got to support the President of the United States."

Johnson’s policies, he said, are firm and reasonable, and.
that he would agree, “they are about the right thing to do."
When asked what his toughest

Debate Over Salaries Causes Race
To Upset Quorum at SGA Meeting

By Ted Lemaire

The latest carnival by the ad-
visory council was hi gli-
lighted by a race between Les-
ter Tobias, attempting to leave
the room and thereby destroy
the quorum, and Keith King,
trying to “seal the chamber”
as instantaneously - appointed
sergeant-at—arms.

The epic race resulted from
the defeat of a motion recom-
mending a budget for the con»
ing academic year without the
addition of salaries for cer-
tain student officers.

A motion was subsequently
passed favoring yearly salar-
ies for student officers, among
which were social co-ordinator,
$100; SGA President, 5300;
AWS President, $300; CofHP
President, $300.

Between the numerous moves
to establish Correct parliamen-
tary procedure, by yarious ex-

perts, a motion was discussed
to provide the faculty with free
copies of the 5&3. Opposed on
the grounds that the paper
would be losing $200 from pos-
sible subscriptions and that in<
'terested faculty should buy it
themselves were Karen Lauterr
bach and Dan Bucks. Dave
Lighthourne and others contend-
ed that elsewhere faculty re-
ceive papers and that this would
provide them with more contact
with students. Finally passed
was the request that the admin-
istration consider providing
funds for free subscriptions.

Among other business dis-
cussed was the damage bill for
the May 4 impromptu riot, to-
taling $98.44, to be evenly paid
by the CDfHP and the AWS
board. The executive cabinet
requested that in the future
there be more enforcement to
prevent damage.
