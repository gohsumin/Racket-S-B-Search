A letter Irom San Francisco . . .
THE WEST COAST WORD

Last weekend I attended the conclusmh oi the
"Trips Festival" sponsored by (novelist) Ken
Kesey and The City Lights bookshop. It is a psycho
delic Mardis Gras with 13—60 year old hippies in
everything from space suits to Indian costumes.
There was a rock 'n roll dance in the Fillmore (Nee
gro) section featuring some or San Francisco’s bet-
ter groups: The Grateful Dead, The Electric Train,
the Quicksilver Messenger Service, and The Jeiier-
son Airplane. It lasted from 9:00 pm. to 4:00 am:

every imaginable form was flashed continually on
the walls and the ceilings plus in the middle of it all
you could make out newsreels and old movies

SON”). It is indescribable.

A few of the other groups hanging around are
The Skins, The Family Dog, The Mystery Trend,
The Charlatans, The Wildflower, The Holding Com-
pany.

I stood in the middle of it all and had to admit
that I don’t know what it is, do I Mr. Jones?

Kesey is living his third book instead or writing

think he's the only one around here who doesn’t
think his game with the authorities has gone a little
too far.

The word is that he’s hiding out in the hills north
oi s. F. Maybe there’ll be a 26th of July Movement

I've booked passage on a steamship the end of
this Week—on to Hawaii and surfboards. Hope the

Oiienders Individuals

A new trend in Carleton‘s atti-
tude towards infractions of Col-
lege social regulations has ap-
peared. it now considers each oi.
tender as an individual so that lie
is not always given a predeter-
mined punishment. ln this manner
the dean chose to assign two re-
cent male violators to twenty
hours of labor in the college work-
shop rather than suspend them.

The dean remarked, “The 10-
day suspension should include an
encounter with one’s parents—an
encounter that is to benefit his
social attitude. it you are dealing
with a student who has reached
the age when he has developed
his own moral behavior, then a
