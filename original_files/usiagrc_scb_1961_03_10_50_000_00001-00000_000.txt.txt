Last night the Grinnell Plays . 1.1mm»
er's production of Thornton wild-
er's "The Skin of Our Teeth"
went on the boards or ARH
theatre The play, a diiticult
one, was received by an enthw
siastic audience and provided an
emoyable evening oi "theatre”
in spite ot obvious shortcomings.

First. the play itself leaves
something to be desired. it is
otten "gimmicky,” sometimes re
dundant, and moves in such a
random manner as to render it-;
self, at best somewhat contusing,
at worst directionless and ob-;
secure, All this is to say that

the play is held together by at
very thin line. Much oi the pi‘o-' ,*

ductlon's weakness sprang from
the seeming inability of the show
to find this “line" and hold it.

In addition to this, ‘Skin’
demands a certain flare of
Showmanship, a quality often
associated with musical corn-
edy, to get off the ground

and keep it tlying until the ,

final curtain tails. No doubt
the ridiculously inadequate
tacilitics ot Aim restrict what
can be done in this respect,

The acting was tor the most
part quite good, 1 was particu-
larly impressed with the skill
and promise of several newcom—

most accomplished lob ot act—

was handled with sometimes re-
markable success by another
“new face.” Connic Bergen
is to be commended on a per-
formance which, while some.
times ‘clicllt‘ic,’ cttcn possessed

the magic or which good theatre‘

is made. She brought a tresh
and deighttul tyle to the play
and operated with a poise which
was lacking in many of the oth-
er actors.

Larry Homolka,

like Miss

Parish. made his rrlle both (h- i

the. mast eontusing roles or the

a number or lev at lcast two

more ~ious sentimentality. She
was able to handle the comedy
with some skill: the cntnnental.
