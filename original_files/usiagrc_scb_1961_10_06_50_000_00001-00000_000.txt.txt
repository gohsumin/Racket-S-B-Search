High Court Clears North Younker;

Throws Out Vague 0W0" Bull? 7 1

Article Vii oi the men’s house
rules was declared unconstitu-
tional by members oi the High
Court lollowing nine hours spent
in deliberation after the appeal
oi the CofHP vs. North Yoiinkcr
case.

This section or the men's house
rules deals with the orientation
program, its obiectives and ice
strictions. it states that any vioe
latlon of the program, either
letter or in spirit, will be brought
before the men’s Primary Court,
and any person teeling that any
action taken violates the pro

visions of this program has the.

right to present his case to the
Corn? to allow this body to
pl’osecute.

The decision of the men's Pi
inory Court to iinc North Youne
kcr hall $20 ior violation o: Are
ticlc vtl, section B, of the men’s
house rules was also revcrscd
following Monday night's appeal
because of the unconstitutional
ruling given to the Article.

According to Justice Ronald

Den, the High Court agreed
upon two reasons ior the re—
versal. in the tirst place, the
general vagueness or Article
vll or the men’s house rules.
especially concerning a deﬁni-
tion or the “spirit" or the orien-
tation program, renders it im—
possible for the courts to guar—
antee due process oi law, that
is, “to insure justice to every
member or the Grinncll stu—
dent body." which is giiai-nn—
teed in the Bill or Rights.

The indefinite nature of the
Articlc leads to misunderstand»
ings concerning the nature or all»
iegcd Violations, which was evie
dent in the North Younker case
where both plaintiit and defendv
ant wcrc uncertain about specific

Violations

Secondly. Doi-i- says ,thc phrase
contained in Article Vii, Section
B, number 2, “to allow the Corn?
to prosecute," gives to the CorHF
the authority to establish itseli
as a .iudicieil “middleman," This
would constitute a violation ct
Article 111, Section A of the
power or the Grmnell College

,G.A. constitution, “the judicial
Student Government AssoCiatlorl
shall be vested in a High Court,
two separate Primary Courts.
and house councils or all rcsr
dcncc halls."

Although both parties involve

qucslecl a clarification oi the

Court declined to elaborate upon
