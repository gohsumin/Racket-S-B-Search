Open Al Cornell

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell’s freshman football
team opens its season this aft»
ernoon at Mount Vernon, Iowa,
with the Cornell College Rams.
The ﬁrst tilt of a three—game
season, this contest pits the
young Pioneers against a peren—
nially powerful squad. Cornell
will probably go with a well.
balanced attack and plenty of
passing.

Due to the departure of Terry}
Moore to the Peace Corps, the
coaching reins have fallen this‘
year to two seniors, Dick Nye
and Bill Henry. Concentrating
on fundamentals, Nye and Hen.
ry have ﬁelded a team with a
great deal of promise. A smalll
but hardrrunning backﬁeld fee-l
turing Rick Bl‘ecunier, Lynn
Richman and Nord Brue will
highlight the oﬁense this year.

3017 Watt, ionnerly a halt—
back, took over the quarter-
back spot when Elliott Hibbs
was injured, and consequently
the freshmen do not plan to
pass a great deal, although
they are exceptionally strong
at end where Tom Hill and
Ring Johnson will start,

The Pioneerlln g s also
boast good strength in the inte—
rior line. Starting here will be
tackles George Wittgraf and
Rick Anderson, guards Len Luv
ter and John Goodenow, and
center Bob Geller.

Rounding out the squad are
linemen Jon Showe, Steve Ross,
Tom Gait, Howard Harned, Harv
ry "nitwiler and Bill Grenze—
bach and backs Jefif Garland

and Monmouth. The Pioneers
with victories at the Wabash
Invitational, and over State Cole
lege of Iowa are favored to win
the meet for the second consecu-
tive year. The strongest team
competition should come from
St. Ambrose, which has last
year’s undefeated team back
virtually intact.

The run for individual honors
should be fierce with Gene
Tackle of Luther a‘slight fav—

\crite. Grinnell's Rod Brown, who

race.

The Pioneers should be ready
to shift into high gear tomor-
row following their 35—14 drub—
bing of Knox last weekend at
Galesbung. First string half—
backs Elston Bowers land Chip
Clarke will be back in action,
after missing last week’s game
due to injuries, and the only
regular not scheduled to see ac—
tion is Eric Miller, junior tackle
who suffered a shoulder separate

A topenoteh backfield, featur—
