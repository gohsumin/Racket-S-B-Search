Robbins Rehukes Women

By Jean Vandervoort

The need for improved wom-
an participation on the Student
Senate. and the p r 0 pos e d
change in the Faculty Commit»
tee on Student Publications
were the topics or discussion in

the AWS Board meeting last
Monday.

“I hear continual complaints
from South Campus that; they
are underrepresented,” Ed
Robbins, Student S e n a i: e
Speaker, told the AWS Boardr
North Campus’ two vote ad-
Vantage makes little differ-
ence, he said. He Claimed, in—
stead, that the women repre-
sentatives are ineffective be-
cause they are rigidly instruct-
ed by their halls; their knowl~
edge of parliamentary proced-
ure is deficient; and they do
not make use of poliﬁcal prin
ciples.

While most of the men’s
dorms depend on individual
pressure to intluence their
senators’ votes. the women’s
dorms usually “instruct" their
senators by a group vote, Robe

"Individual pressure on the
senators allows them more
freedom in discussing the is-
sues and guarantees more in-

Robbins commented that the
women representatives seemed

would be more influential if
they knew what they were

doing.” Poor preparation,
weak arguments, and iailure
to unity as a group when it
would benefit them are the rear
sons he gave ior their political
ineffectiveness

Mr, Robbins suggested that
the women's halls decide at
the first or the year whether or
not they Will determine their
senators‘ votes by group vote.
The senators should be well
prepared to discuss issues of
high interest.

Marie Martin, AWS Board

president, announced that lho
Executive Cabinet has issued
a statement which calls tor a
majority of students on the
Committee on Student Publi-
cations. The committee is now
composed of five faculty mem.
bers and {our students She
said that a student majority
was only fair because the com,

tries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.

Many of the spring group will
be midyear graduates or us.
colleges and universities who
