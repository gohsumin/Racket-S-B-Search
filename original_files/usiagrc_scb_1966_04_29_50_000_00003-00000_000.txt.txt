1231. vs. SDS

The F.B.I. has approached the Dean oi
Wesleyan with requests tor a member-
ship list of the Wesleyan chapter of Stu-
dents ior a Democratic Society (SDS).
This particular chapter has been quite
active in demonstrations against us. in-
volvemenl. in Viet Nam.

The dean refused to Cooperate stating
that his ofﬁce would not have given the
government any such list because “we

never volunteer such information, We
consider the student’s activity his own
affair.”

an paper, members of the SDS chapter
asked the RBI. to “have its agents di-
rectly question the individuals con-
cerned.” The article also alluded to the
F.B.I. interviews of roommates of Yale
SDS members to determine the nature

Former Vice President Richard Nixon
will not accept an honorary degree from
the University of Rochester although he
will speak at its commencement‘

Students and faculty had opposed the
administration's decision to give him an
honorary degree at their June Com-
mencemeiit. They felt that several of
Nixon's speeches against viet Nam had
been too outspoken in the view against
total academic freedom.

However, Nixon, who was tirst invited
to speak at the commencement last July,
has decided lo reiuse die honorary de-
gree but speak anyway at Rochester:
June commencement. He Will speak on
”Academic Freedom.”
