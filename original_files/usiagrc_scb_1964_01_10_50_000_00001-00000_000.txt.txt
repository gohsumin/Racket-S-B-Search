Grinnell Political Convention Offers
Opportunity for Student Delegates -

Work has already begun in
preparation for Grinnell’s sec-
ond Mock Political Convention
to be held April 9.11. Grinnell
students will soon have an op
portunity to sign up to partici—
pate as delegates in the 1964
convention.

Grinnell’s first Mock Political
Convention was held in 1960.
Senator Wayne Morris of Ore-
gon gavs the keynote address
in that inaugural convention.

The mock political conven~
tion in the Words of C. Edwin
Gilmour “attempts to replicate
yust as realistically as possible
the atmosphere and mechanics
of a national convention.

The keynoter for the 1964
convention will be Oregon
Governor Mark Hatﬁeld. A
Republican, the youthful ﬂat-
field is considered by many
to be one of the leading can-
didates for the Vice Presiden-
tial nomination.

Gilmour describes the mock
convention as “fun with a pur-
pose." In the 1960 convention
ambitious Rockefeller support-
ers imported an elephant from

Grinnell Gets Gobs of $

Grinnell has received a giii
in kind from the Dow Chemical
Company, valued at in excess of
$5,600. -
Merritt C. Ludwig, vicc presi-
dent, said the Dow materials
are being used in construction
of the Gl‘innell College Forum,
the new student center which is
scheduled for completion next
fall. r

 

a Davenport zoo for the conven-
tion.

The real interest in the con-
vention, however, will center on
the nominah'ons. The Republi—
cans can offer What appears to
be shaping up as a uniquely in-
teresting contest with at least
six strong/contenders and sev-
eral possible dark horses con-
tending for the Presidential
nomination.

At present there appears to
be no Challenger to Lyndon
Johnson for the Democratic
nomination, but the vice presi-
dential nomination r e m a i n 5
very much a question mark.

The goal of the convention
is to have every Grinnell stu-
dent participate as a dele-
gate. priority will be given
to those who are members of
either the Young Democrats
or Young Republicans.

The convention will be thrown
open to participation for Stu-
dents from all lowa colleges so
the importance of an early sign
up for Grinnell students is em-
phasized.
