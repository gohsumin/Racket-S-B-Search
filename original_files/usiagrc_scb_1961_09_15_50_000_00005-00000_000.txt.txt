Dean Wood Views Students life

Gl'innell’s new Dean or Mon,‘
Stephen E. Wood, is presently l
grounding himsclf in the tradi—
tions and working arrangements
of the college. He sees the system
here unique in the amount of
control the student has over his
life and is well aware of Grim,
ncll‘s long history of studentl
government which leaves the re
sponsibility of a great number
of the rules to the students, Yet
he sees that with this respons
bility comes also the responsibil. _
ity of the student to eniorcc the
rules he has made. “1 see no rea—
son for rules that aren't entorc—
ed," he said in an interview this »
week.

Dean Wood is originally iroln‘
a rural communnty in Southwest
ern Michigan, seemed in World}
War II and since 1946 has been‘
either a student or on the (Soul-
ty of the UmVel'slly of Chicago‘ ,
where he did both his undergrad—
uate and graduate work. He has
‘taught in the social sciences therel
and also served in an administra—
tive capacity as associate Dean
