Student Action

Grinnell has been alive this week in a way that is en—
couraging to sec. There has been debate and resolution,
much confusion and solnc v ry courageous decisions and
action. If the world outside looks discouraging and blacker
perhaps than ever before in the history of mankind, Grin—
hell’s activity and the awakening of the American student
is significant as a slnall ray of hope and some testimony
to the fact that perhaps there are still some realities to be
found between and beneath the lines and lines of deified
facts.

of all the very fine debating we heard in the Scri-
ate, there was one point of View which is still a lingering
incongruity to this week of awakening, Even after the
Grinnell College Senate last year set the precedent 01‘ john
ing the NSA, and becoming one of its lnost active members,
even after a protest was registered against the U2 incic
(lent, several members of the Senate are still pleading long,
hard and strong for Senate isolationism.

The argument which seems most illogical, is one which
might be called the argument for specialization. That is,
that students ill the Senate should be restricted to a nalu
row line of thinking and legislation defined very narrowly
by the words “student life.”

Student life may be interpreted in two ways. It may
lie construed to mean simply concern over the workings
of coke machines, milk machines, Grinnell concerts and what
have you on the Grinnell campus, or it may be construed
to mean anything which will effect the student ill all im-

>ortant way,

It is interesting to note that even though Senators
Capehart and Humphrey were not in agreement with stands
taken by the senate resolution. they felt that student ac-
tion in a democratic system was of primary importance.
Students should try to lnake themselves heard.

Petition, in itself, is something 01’ a show of Faith in
the American systemi It is when we begin to be so very
sure that we will not be heard and that we have nothing
to say, that our system of government is in grave jeopard .
Part of being a student is contributing our knowledge and
opinions to the world about us -

Furthermore, it is becoming more and more
apparent that in this crisis-time there are very
few things that happen in the world which do not directly
or indirectly effect the student. Strontium 90 in the at-
mosphere will strike the student, the national and’oi'
world citizen, it will not be selective. Student activity is
{rill-important today. We must act, and we must act in a
courageous and united fashion if we are to be heard.

Thirteen Travelers

Thirteen people will travel to Washington this week
for a three day vigil in hope of arousing student opinion :1—
against the resumption of nuclear testing in the atmosphere
Regardless of how you may feel about the issue itself, it
seems important only to remind the student body that it
is this sort of action which must be considered of a noble
and courageous nature.

legardless of final effectiveness, the effort itself is one

to be admired, because it shows that the American student

is finally leaving the provincialism of his own small back-
yard and venturing out to take his place as a conscientious

citizen of the world.

To the Editor:

We are not only looking to
perfect wcapcns or an olrciisii-c
nature by the resumption oi nu-
clear testing which would have
the ciicct of disarming the So-
viets in case 01 wa'. Mcrc ““7
portant and primal ly, we are
at this minute in a race to buikl
up a strong defense against
potential Russian aggression.

The defenses l have specific-
ally in mind are the antim ln
mlssilcs of the proposed Ni \er
Zeus Caliber which would help to
secure both protection against
missile threats as well as to in—
sure our missrlo effectiveness in
case of conﬂict.

What good would our ebborate
missiles be if wc could not in-
sure any hits in case of attack?
It has admittedly been stated
that both the US 5.12, and the
US, have enough nuclear wcapr
oils on hand to destroy each
other. Should we, through nog-
ligence, rail to develop our der
fensive arsenal, we would be

admitting a dcicci by‘dcicull.

The Russians do not have
miy nppircnr designs along
this line. Surely they realize

the importance of prcicciing
their own populations (if only

ior propaganda's sake) as went
as realizing the importance or
developing weapons which
could disable America.

It Seems we are again in a
race with the SovietUnion only

this time to see who can develop
the most efficient weapons to
preserve our civilian popular
tions.

These weapons. although
small, would oi necessny be
both aiinospheric in use and
nuclear in nature They must be
atmospheric for they are design—
ed to deslroy other niis les.
They must bc unclear to insure
the total destruction 01 these
missiles.

RESOLUTHON DIRECTED TO STUDENT SENAT .

(November 6, 1961)
Fact:

The Sol/let Union has recently conducted a Series of 17 atmoSA
phcric nuclear tests climaxed by an explosion of greater than 50
megatons as or October 31, 1961. Now the US. is seriously ccn-
sidcrmg a resumption oi atmospheric nuclccr testing.

Military experts chine United States have repeatedly asserc
ed that We could “destroy any enemy who attacks us regardless
or when or how he does it," (Arleigh Burke or the JOlnt Chieis of
Sara bciorc a Congressional Committee) * And President Kennedy
himself has stressed the utter usclcssncss of the recent Soviet
series

Many physicists, doctors, biologists. and health ciiicinls have
offered ccncrclc, positive evidence or the grotesque consequences
or Strontium so and other radioactive fallout particles.

sion to icrccs which threaten human survival have traditionally
charactel zed Grinnell College. h is with a critical attitude and
with an equal conccrn for the international posture of the us.
that we assume lhc following position.

Declaration:
We, the Student Senate of’Grinnell College, by a vote of 29-17
gppose a resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing by the United
(ates.

Mandate:

' The appropriate student government officers are empowered
to send ccpics of thls resolution to such defense and military
criicinls as the President, Secretary of Defense: the Secretary of
Health, Education and Weliarc; the Joint Chiefs of Shirt; and the
chairman of ihc Atomic Energy Commission. Thcsc officers are
iurihcr empowered on behalf of the Student Senate or the sup
dent chcrnmcnl Assomatlon to express the decision or the Sen-
ate on this matter as they scc fit

“ Also, Roswell Gilpatrie, “This nation has a nuclear retaliatory
force of such lethal power that any enemy move which brought
it into play could be an act of selfrdestruction on his part. Our
forces are so displayed and protected that. a sneak attack Could
not effectively disarm us.” (Oct., 1961)

country irom possible attack.

An open letter to Grinncll's
capiiarbond siudcnt‘s for peace.

1 have heard that 13 of you
plan to leave icr Washington
on Monday. Your statement 01
purpose is not available at the
time of this writing.

Sincc I sympathize in princi-
pal ,i would likc to after some
suggestions for
your conciclei»
anon. I think
most oi us
have felt a de-

9 to do
something can-
structive to aid
the cause oi

ipeace. 1 can:
not go with

you this time.

Because the Wml

incredible amount of money
that is going toward my educa-

tion is not my own. i iecl an
obllgalion to stay here. This
may seem petty in comparison
with ihc’prcscui state of world
affairs, but i also thlnk there is
hole 1 can oiicr to the group,
Having salvcu my own Cone
science, 1 can move on to scinc
suggestions.
As tar
would recommend that you un—
derstale your cause. Make the

goal you are trying lo achieve

your purpose, I

simple and possible, Say that
you are going on this trip to

stir up interest on campus.
our campus.

if the idea catches on and
students from olhci- schools join.
your Washington vigil, fine, but
there IS nothing more embarras-
smg than a mass demonslration
by {our people,

Your demonstration or con-
corn is not going to put much
pressure on the Senate, House
or the President. I think the
show put on by. Capcharl and
Humphrey demonstrated admir-
ably that the glib tongues of
the politicians can reduce any
argument to absurdity, There is
no hope of asking the President
or his underlings questions for
which they have no answers,

Make rhc Washington vigil a
demonstration at your concern
about the acceleration of the
aims race, the proposed resump-
tion of nuclear testing and the
lack of _ gniiicant action in the
field of dlsﬂi‘lnﬂi‘nent Make the
demonstration an effort to arouse
interest in what is thought. to be

a sittltalon oi immediate danger
As for your methods, keep

them as simple as your purposes.
One of the most impressive pacir

risl demonstrations was the
silent vigil maintained around
the pentagon: just an orderly
circle of people standing wilh
their heads bowed as if in prayer
or sorrow, Don't rule out last-
mg complclcly; it would save
money and the total cost is go~
ing to be around $700.

Above all, tell us what you
are going to do. Explain care-
fully your position, your mo-

tives and your course of MA
lion. You have created in-
terest but iolow it up after
you return.

If things turn out as 1 hope,
we might cvcn be able to drum
up some support here on campus
Perhaps, in conjunction With
your vigil, we could have a day
of voluntary fast to show that
we too, are concerned.

Then, done in
Washington, some back to the
heart of darkest Iowa.

When the Robert's - Theater -
Bomb , shelter
Cum

when you're

mentioned.
Hendersliol protests too
much, Something is in llie wind.
Sounds

is

like almost time for

another resolution.

Sincerely,
John Ward
