To the Editor.

On the t‘anillg or March 4 in Youllkcr lounge,
r. Kenneth Christiansen (biology) presented to
a large group or students his personal reasons
for calling himselt an atheist, His dynamism held
us test as his superior wit ﬂogged our t‘eeble
objections until the blood or lovingly-held unali—
tion lieued, Our attempts to build strong. valid
obloctions struck me as being a good deal more
dillicult than his simply denying the obicct or
their existence

It is my hope that the briet presentation of
another ebiection will produce at least a cons
fi'oilta‘tion ot' the issue. Tire strength or Chris an.
sens wit eannot now drown out the ueahnesses
of his argument, as it did on the.evening ol
March 4

Dr, Cllristlallscn's logic was scientific and co-
ht‘rcllt, culminating In a most precise conclusion:
he stated that he could not ULCCDi [ho existence
til God upon the cl‘ldotlce available to him Ec-
illg a sctcntlst Dr, Cllt’lsttallsctl has doubtlessly
examinincd this oxidcncc lholoughl)‘ He has
organized it and found that It can load only to

creatures interpret it not as erouth l'] til

all, hut as movement in space The grow i of the
circle in the plane has a part but not the osscnte
ot the reality ol the sphere.

Man is as limited to his world as the lit.
laiiders to theirs We cannot perceive the Ulttr
mate realities oi the universe. tor ue are to .
iined to our earthly subreetii'ty. The uhima
realities are therefore unhnowable, all thin.
in and of man are knoll'able, SlnLe man cannot
hope to disprme the existence oi God, we must
include him in the realm or the unhnewabies

The evidence upon which Christiansen l]h$(3
his conclusion is ltnolvablo, thel'elore a part, ti
man and, his world. It does not relate to col.
lust as growth in time does not relate to mm“-
nlcnt in space His evidence excludes all of l
universe save things in and at man, air intin'
ly small part of that universe

man is i part or the unlver . J -t as a circle s

them. The CllL‘lC though is a pait ol the [lab

deny the whole is to deny a part.

Neither Clll‘l’ ianscn nor anyone can claim
