correlations are not identities.
Nevertheless, the dignity oi a
discipline lies in accuracy as well
as in the importance oi the
subject matter; and what ethics
lacks in accuracy, it makes up
in importance. Moreover, we do
honor or praise certain men in
high positions, not tor what they
have done by accident or in a
matter of minutes or hours, but
for deeds which arise out of
certain qualities, qualities which
are habits acquired through
repeated acts ot detinite types
and stabilized in a predictable
manner. We expect just acts
from a man who has been called
“just", and courageous acts irom
a man who is known to be
courageous. And it such men are
praised or honored tor many
qualities oi this sort, they are
generally considered as leading
a happier life than the rest of
mankind, for, if it is not for a
happier liie, tor what other
reason would they choose to act
as they do or be praised and
honored? ls it because they
benefit mankind? But that is part
of the function of such qualities,
tor, not only do they benefit the
possessor oi them, but also those
to whom the qualitative acts may
be directed, A generous man
gives with pleasure and not with
pain, and the receiver beneiits
by the act of generosity, and
iuriher, the giver is praised or
honored. as if getting a bonus in
addition to his pleasure oi giving;
and such is generally the nature
of an act which proceeds irom
certain habits called “virtues"

Now since happiness is
relatively assured by the posses-
sion oi a number oi virtues, and
since there is a way oi acquiring
virtues, there must be a science
as well as an art leading to the
possession of virtues. The science
of virtues is a matter at
knowledge and of fact, namely,
knowledge or the tact that such
atid such a virtue is acquired in
such and such a manner, and
the art has to do with the specific
acts issuing [l'om such knowledge
and ending in possession oi
the virtues. This art is analogous
to any other art. A student of
medicine first learns the facts of
m8dlClI’lB_ and then he becomes
an intern to get the skill oi acting
effectively in accordance with
that knowledge, and an architect
or engineer- does likewise.
Accordingly, we may sketchily
define ethics as the science of
virtues which lead to happiness,
tollou-ed hy the art oi acquiring
these virtucs Titc science is a
matter of knowledge acquired
through discussion in class. the
art is a matter of acting on the
part oi the student in accordance
with such hnou-ledcc

Historically, the administrate
tions at colleges in this country
were more particular about the
conduct oi students in earlier
years than in recent years, The
pattern oi conduct was more or
less set, and deviations were
r’eali with in such a manner as
not to disturb the pattern. The
penalty for students, especially
those of academic or some other
excellence, was minor, as long
as the deviation was not too
serious Alter all, there was not
much danger about the pattern
of conduct, and a certain amount
oi wayward initiative on the port
or the student was excused,
sometimes even welcomed. A
successful businessman
preterred a son with zest and
initiative, and pranks were ex-
cused since his son would finally
settle down, and administrations
of colleges understood this
Besides, such a son would not
try to justity his act, he took the
light punishment with slight
rcgrct. The situation now has
changed. We no longer have
isolated acts ot devtation, but
ratiier organized acts; and
further, students who deviate are
determined to do so and to justify
their acts in the name of “social
justice” oi “the new society,” or
“a tree morality" or other such
slogans.

In other words, what is at stake
now is the pattern or conduct
itself or the “establishment";
and it appears that this point is
not quite understood by many ad-
ministrators or trustees, who are
not aware that the problem now
is no longer one of degree, but
one of kind; or else, ads
ministrators or trustees are not
quite equipped, in one way or
another, to deal With the problem
etiectiyely This is to be ex
pected. One who introduces a
great idea or system usually has
reasons for it and can justify it
with arguments. Such were the
fathers at our constitution, whose
justification may be read in the
It‘cdcralisl Papers. Once the
pattern is set and stabilized, that
great idea or system tends to be

perpetuated more by habit and
loss through knowledge oi the

arguments behind it So we

find present administrators less
equipped to defend the pattern
at conduct wtth arguments and
clicctive measures, and this
makes rcbellioiis students more
convinced of'lhe justificalion oi‘
their acts and bolder in their

actions, And naturally, such
students pay more attention to

thc weaknesses of thcir superiors

than to their oivn, young as the

weaknesses of their own system
tii they have one at alli, once
such system is introduced But
then, such students see things as
being relatively simple, and this
is because their thinking is
relatively simple.

As for the argument that
students are more honest and
that older men are, more hypo-
critical, even II we admit this is
a tact, and perhaps it is, would
this change human nature by
changing the establishment? For
one thing, older men are more
aware of their weaknesses or
vices than younger men are; and
younger men are more irresponr
sible than older men, It young
men are more honest and more
idealistic, they can afford to be
so, tor. necessity has not yet
knocked at the door. They are
assured of a livelihood and an
education, while older men have
had to provide the means. But
in providing the means one is
faced with competition, and when
there is competition, there we
find the temptation to be less
idealistic and less honest and
more practical. Now these very
idealistic and honest young men.
as experience has shown, do not

hesitate to forget their idealism
and honesty it it is they, and not
their parents, who have to earn
a livelihood and assure their
children a good living and an
education. More honesty and
idealism in younger men, then,
even if admitted as a fact, does
not prevent the change when the
same young men begin to assume
the burden of earning a livelir
hood, whatever the system or
establishment. Evidence of this
is to be seen in a system built
by young and idealistic men the
Sonet Union. Once the system
was built a struggle for power
.and retention oi power ttor
someone must have the power to
do things which have to be done)
resulted in the Stalin era, and
the rest is history. Further
evidence is to be found iii the
very institutions which are
supposed to be idealistic and
which are supposed to promote

for exploiting the Initiative Fund.
Tim claimed that the Senate and
student body has been violating
the committee's guidelines be-
cause the Initiative fund is the
only SGA branch oi anything that
has a dime to its name (save only
Julia Szabo). Tim protested,
“Everyone thinks that the
Initiative Fund is just a pile of
money” tiorgetting the many
who believe that the initiative
iund is just a pilex).

Greg Vranicar and Kit Gage
announced that they had been
sampling faculty opinion on the
proposal of establishing a
Faculty Ombudsmen. Kit and
Greg’s list covered a wide range
oi political viewpoints; ranging
from Mr. Milner on one hand, and
swinging all the way over to Mr.
Gurofi and Mr. Parssinen on the
other, At Tom Thomas’ sug»
Eestion. Kit: and Greg will hustle

up some more iolks.

And speaking of Mr, Parssinen,
the Senate won another round in
their grapple with the Publica-
tions Committee. Andy Brill
asked the Student Coordinator to
run oir an opinion poll to deter-
mine whether the school should
have a yearbook or a literary
magazine. The Senate believed
that they have too much to do and
that opinion polls might be better
handled through omer channels
— hall meetings, questionnaires,
etc. Al Cohen said that. Mr. Pars~
sinen and his committee might
retaliate before Mr. P. goes to
Philadelphia.

And speaking oi Philadelphia.
Andy Loewi’s little brother has
been accepted at Harvard. And
Penn. The younger Loewi plans a
visit to Grinnell later in the se-
mester. The presence or Andy's
brother on campus should clear
up the widely held misconception
that Andy’s little brother is really
Barry Zigas.

weeks away and with the set-
tlement of the B&G strike, now
seems to be inevitable, The
Commencement Committee has
been exchanging questionnaires
and polls with the Senior class in
an attempt to assess student
opinion and encourage student
participation.

on behalf of the Com~
mencement Committee,
Chairman Tom Greenfield
released the following an-
nouncements:

For the class gift, seniors
elected to raise money tor the
planting or new trees on campus.
In a “mural ” the trees won out
over a Martin Luther King
Scholarship donation (last year’s
senior gilt), 61-45. Collections
will be made through selected
hall and offrcampus represenr
tatives.
