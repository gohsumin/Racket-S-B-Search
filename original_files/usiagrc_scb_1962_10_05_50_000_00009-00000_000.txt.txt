from Tokyo, Japan, where he
graduated from high school. He
is from a family oi two children
and has a younger sister. His
father the manager of a
Tokyo industrial plant. Kunio
plans to graduate from Grinnell
in political science, and hopes
to attend graduate school in
Tokyo and eventually go into
the Japanese diplomatic service
or some related area of interna—
tional atlairs.

Kunio is impressed with Grin
nell and the American system
of higher education, He pointed
out that the entrance require—
ments for Japanese universities
are stricter, but he did not think
that students worked as hard in
universities as Grilinell students

He left East Germanv in i952

To the Editor

Although i was favorably im—i
pres d with the musical taste
exhl -d by those who leit the
Dizzy Gillespie concert while it
was in progress. 1 was appalled
at such a mass exhibition of bad,
manners. In a college of “adults"
who purport to be at least mod—
erately sophisticated, one should
expect ‘that those who bother to
go to a concert at all will be‘
polite enough to sit through itt
until an intermission

r: [S somewhat heartening
to note that people seem able-
to survive a concert of the Len».‘
ox String Quartet without de—
parting in droves between move-,
ments, and in smaller numbers‘
during each movement. But this‘
contradiction makes the behavior
at the Jazz Concelt that much
more distressing: students uhoi
have demonstrated that they can
be poliie refuse to be so

pressed by the seriousness and

_political interest of Gl’lnnell stu—

dents. He is a resident of Clark.

Emy Malca, from “Panama,
the heart of the world and the
bridge oi the universe." says her
main impression at Grinnell is
that of “Ieeling at ease." Emy
is a political science major and
will be at Grinnell for four-
years. Her extracurricular in.
terests to date are the Interna—
tional Relations ‘Club, the Cos-
mopolitan Club, the Pre—laiv
Club. ridin urf swimming and
‘vel'y beginning" tennis.

In Panama Emy was secretary
for both the Law School and
the student government, both
elective positions, and worked
as secretary for the Colombian
Consulate.

When asked for her impres—
sions oi the United states,
Einy mentioned that New York
was a “cosmopolitan city but
not good for living in," that
winter will be “shocking” since
she has never seen snow. and
that many things in the news—
papers about Panama are ex-
aggerations.

She also commented that dat-
ing in Panama is different from
the States. There, dating is in
groups unless a couple is serious.

Sandra Pisulich, from Lima.
Peru, has previously visited the
United States once before when
she spent three months in Chi—
cago Sandra has two older bro—
thers.

She commented, “I only wish
Peruvians could come to Grille
nell so they could see that Am-
ericans do study, and hard." Apr
parently America is stereotypcd
in Peru as the “freesllving, easy.
going country in the North”
because of the American movies
shown in Peru.

Lima is modernized but still
has the colonial atmosph it
is a cosmopolitan and friendly
city. but Peruvians would rather

,come to the United States to sec

Americans than have Americans
visit Peru. This is because the
contrast between extreme pov—

lelty among the lower classes in

Peru and the
is very gieat

Arabic) at Belgrade Univeisity
She got her degree in three
years, the youngest student in
the histoiy ot the school to gtad~
uate in that time. She will he
at crinncll about a yeai and al
half, studying sociology. ,

In comparing Yugoslavian uni
versities with American ones,
she said that the broad liberal
arts base studied heie in col,
lege is studied in high school
there, and the Yugoslavian uni.l
versity is quite specialized.

She commented that “the‘
world is very small," for hail
first contact with Grinnell was
when she met Dan Tiggins int
Egypt two years ago. She said
that America was really too far
away from Yugoslavia for it to
be anything but a dream. Yas
mina said that social lite in Yue
goslavia is all in groups and
parties; she had her first "date"
at Giinnell.

Elizabeth Uggla, from StockT
send Sweden, says that the big l
gest difference she rinds between‘
Sweden and the Unitcd States
is in the clothes people wcarl
“We don't have Bermudas, i
sneakers, or sweatshirts, clothes'
are plainer in Sweden and most
people dont have as many. ” She
said that food heic is sweeter

She is impressed by the per—
sonal contact Grinnell students
have with professors. In Sweden,
professors are mostly lecturers
The assistants have some [12%
sonal contacts, although there
are no colleges with dorms so

Groups inect frequently, and
in the co- -cducational schools ,
there are more activities.

Heidi Walker, from Lubeck,
Sellleszg-Holstcin in Nulthem
Cermany, says of European feel.
ilig towald Anlellca “We file
sitting in one boat; Western Eu-
rope dcpends on America and
America depends on us."

Her main surprise in coming
to Grinncll was the dih‘crence
in studies and general attitudes
toward academics. In Germany
there are no assignments for
classes and students must choose
their own books. ‘Girls do not
have hours since there are no
dormitories. She said that pin.‘
ning did not exist in ‘Gerlnan
schools. Cheering and hall and
school songs are not present, and
sports do not play an important
Part in student life.

Giiniicll will join 37 Midwest
liberal arts colleges iii a new
piogiam to iecruit and piepaie
able students for careers as
ollege teachers, President How—
ard R, Bowen, has announced,
The piograni will be conducte

ed by the University of Chicago-

under a $975, 000 grant from the
Poid Foundation

THE GnANT will support an
expeiimental three year master
of aits plan and is an extension
of a piogram launched in 1960
under which the Foundation has
granted $5.3 million to 31 Cole
leges and universities to help
alleviate the shoitage oi capa—
ble college teachers through im—
proved programs oi recruitment
and preparation.

Under terms of the Chicago

iproiect, which retains some fea—

tures of the older programs, the
cuiiiculum for each subject will
be developed by iepresentatives

from the libcial aits colleges
walking with the university
Following the senior year,

students will transfer to the
university to complete gradu-
ate work and gain experience
in teaching under supervision. ,
In each of the three years, the
university will provide full-
tuition schoiaiships ior so stu«
dents coining to Chicago for
the third year of the program.
The Foundation’s grant will be
used over a ﬁve-year period,
primarily to release faculty
members at the university and
cooperating colleges from their
regular classroom duties. They
will plan curricula, prepare ex-
aminations and counsel students.

Among the 37 part ipating

The student government is not ‘

as well organized as it is atj
Grinnell. neither are there any
organizations in schools
