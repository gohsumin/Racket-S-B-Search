A small town has no slums.
Most or the streets are paved, and
lighted, through all or the incor-
porated area. Grinneil's houses
have yards, and lawns, and TV
antennas. Must streets have side-
walks.

There are, however, unpainted,
leaning. broken-windowed houses
and shacks in Grinnell, diiiused
among the small-town cottages
and the older, larger trame hous
est Many oi the houses stand
empty, mute testimony to the tac-
tories that have closed in the last
ten years. and the new ones that

haven’t come. Most of them are
slowly being ruined: some by
time, some by vandals. and some
systematically, board by sal-
vageable board,

Wandering through Grinneii on
a fall atternoon, knocking on doors
of houses you wouldn’t want to
live in for a day, we found some
interesting ideas, and people. Our
first encounter was with 3 char

“lolded up, to let the rest of the
world go by,” in Grinnell. He told
us of the days when he, too, wore
a beard, and sailed with the mer-
chant marines, ran a woodwork-
ing shop, collected ,and polished
gemstones and mineral samples
for sale, and prospeeted through
the west tor gold and silver. We
talked of politics. “I’m an inde-
pendent; I vote for the man," and
his first years in Grinnell, when
he was still working as a small
contractor. He assured us several
times, almost wisttutly, that his
health was getting better again.
and soon he would be back at
work. Meanwhile, what does he
live on? “I know the right people;
that's what counts,” was the only
answer he'd give.

Our friend talked to us of col-
lege a lot, that attemoon when
all or us were playing hookey
from Burling. He’d gone to a jun-
ior college in Fort Dodge, until he
“Get smart and left," because,
really, "What counted was the
money." Yet he assured us again
and again as we tool: his picture
and said good-bye that “Knowi-
edge is the biggest power in the
world. . it you have a little get
up and go with it." Then we left,
and he went back inside his little
house, to wait who knows how
long until someone else from the
rest of the world would stop as
they go by.

Atter this auspicious, and time-
consuming beginning, the project
began to get more difficult. We
were ill-ai-ease knocking on pear
ple's tloors, and they were unce
tom of what we wanted and
whether or not they trusted us.
Few were hostile,
them bhvtously felt that they had

luothiiig unusual or interesting to

utter us.

Most of the people we talked to
were old, and usually ill. One man
told us of working in the glove
factory for 40 years, until retiring
seven years ago. He and his with
live on social security; he has no
pension from the factory. His come
merit was a salty, “They wouldn't
send flowers it you diet], not that
