5 Tonight the 1964-65 Grinnell college home basket—
ball season gets underway, and it could be one of the
tnost exciting ones ever. The team has already played
two games on the road, losing to Augustana 79-66 and
gefeating pre-season Midwest Conference title favorite
. orn‘ell 99-82. 7

The emphasis this year will be on speed and con-
ditioning as there is very little height. At 6‘5”, sopho-
more center Jim Rhodes is the only man on the squad
over 6’3”, However, Augustana and Cornell are two of
the biggest, and supposedly best, teams that we will
face all year, and the Pioneers seem to have held their
Own. Also, a withering man to man press kept the Cor-
nell giants off-balance all night.

An interesting sidelight at Cornell occurred be-
fore the game when Ram coach Paul Maaske led his
mooses onto the court and needled Coach Pfitsch with
in hearing distance of most of our players, “I hate to
say it in front of your boys coach, but you’ve got a
bunch of runts here.” Coach Pfitsch, never at a lossfor
words, was not heard, but must have said something to
the effect of, “You're a real card Paul a you need to
be dealt with”; at which Pfitsch‘s team did
just that, leaving Maaske, I am sure, somewhat be-
wildered. All of this goes to show, I guess, that it’s a
620 over a 570 on those SAT‘s rather than brawn which
matters in basketball, Anyway, it was a tremendous ef-
fort on a hot night (Grinnell shot 61% from the floor
‘and 82% from the foul line), and the only crimeﬁis that
more Grinnellians weren’t able to see it,

From,Northfield, the word is that chief academic
rival Carleton thinks they have a very fine basketball
team, but they said the same thing about their foot-
ball team. Regardless, we are all anxiously awaiting
(or at least I am) their arrival so we can watch that
6’ 6" sophomore center from (of all places!) Crosby-
Ironton, Minnesota

Tonight we will be seeing the defending Confer-
ence champions in action, and although Jack Ankerson
and Gary Mevis have graduated Ripon still has Willie
Alexander, Jim Cahoon and Doug Ankerson, so it
should be a good show. Grinnell will counter with three
remarkably poised sophomores in Tom Hill, Elliott
Hibbs and Jim Rhodes, along with two juniors—Ted

Risser and Jeff Frantz. On the bench will be a lot of ex— ‘

perience in seniors Randy Morgan, Clyde Smith, Dave
’ Sellergren, Dick Ulrich and Toni Bucholtz plus Bob
Watt, another fine sophomore. I

It should be a good game and a good race for the
