Eastman and Pursell to leave .Grinnell

George Eastman (education), Direc-
tor of Teacher Education at Grinnell
tor two years, will join the iaculty at
the University of Builalo next year as
a member at the Social Foundations
Department.

At Buffalo, where the University is
ulosely involved in attempting to elimia
nate the dominant social problems of
the city, Mr. Eastman believes he will
be “at the frontiers oi new thinking"
in his lield. Faculty in his department
have joint appointments — in the iields
or sociology, psychology and education.
Mr. Eastman, who believes that “edu<
cation is the point at which problems
converge," will do research “in human
problems relating to several disci-
plines" and will teach two graduate
courses.

Former Kennedy aides

speak on Vietnam, press

by Johnathan Shows

Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Pierre
Salinger, both key aides to iormer
president John F. Kennedy, spoke to
Grinnell audiences via telephonic ex-
changes earlier this week.

Speaking irom- New York City,

Schlesinger attacked the Johnson ad-'

ministration policy in Vietnam ior in:
unwillingness to negotiate. He asserted
that when we are at a military disad-
vantage we reiuse to talk with Haml;
Ind when our position is strong we still
will not go to the bargaining table be
cause we anticipate improving our
status iurther.

Defending critics of the war, Schles-
inger said that the administration must
recognize that the nation is divided
over the war issue “We certainly can-
not suppress the public opinion polls,”
he said.

Although neither hawk nor dove,
Schlesinger clearly wants the US. out
of Southeast Asia ”because it iS low ﬁll
our priority list. Europe and Latin
America are much more important to
our national interests." To get us out
of Vietnam, he recommends immediate
cessation of the bombing of Norlh Viet-
nam. Schlesinger said that the bomb-
ing was a result of military frustra-
tion, not sound policy direction. "Even
ll we would bomb North Vietnam

Mr. Lyle Pursell (mathematics) has
announced his resignation atter twelve
years at Grinnell, He will be going to
the University of Missouri at Rolla, to
teach graduate courses and help in the
advising oi the graduate program and a
new PhD. program. He said his major
reason for leaving is not dissatisfaction
with Grinnell, but a better opportunity
to pursue personal interests at Missouri.

“The University of Missouri is a Small
university, primarily technical, where I
expect the students as a whole Will be
more math—oriented."

Mr. Pursell was awarded a two-year
research g r a n t (announced in The
Reporter last week) and he intends to
pursue studies in the area he titles
“Rings oi Functions", He says that his
new schedule will allow him a greater
freedom to do this research.

As far as leaving Grinnell is con.
cerned, Mr. Pursell said, "There is an
emotional commitment involved in my
stay that is as hard to break as the
psysical departure. My relationships
with the student body, the school, and
the city, have been pleasing, and my
involvement in ‘educational experi-
ments' has been very profitable."

lution lavoring the abolition at Spring

bickering over the choice or a iew words,
the Riot resolution was adopted as
lollows:

Be it resolved that the Senate favor
the abolition of Spring Riot as it has
occurred in previous years because it
is a generally useless and destructive
event, and it detracts (tom the image
at the responsible students.

The Senate does recognize, however,
that the annual Spring my and Ihe
night preceding it may be worth-
while social activities it propertly
planned and executed. Tire Senate
suggests:

pealing to both dating and non-dating

and the preceding night.

2. that enthrcement of college regu-

lations be stressed. -

a. that the possibility of having
Spring Day as a scheduled event
on the college social calendar be com
sldered.

Tom Triplett, senator from North, Sui»
mitted the approved resolution as an
alternative to the motion introduced last
week by Ray l-lom, Rawson, i-lurn's
resolution, which was designed to pro-
voke student discussion, had been tabled
at the end or last week’s meeting.

Conllict raged over the use or words
in the motion. Senators were especially
concerned over what sort of enforce—
ment to speoiry. Triplett had specified
in his original draft that the term
"proper enforcement" be used, Bill
Fisher, South, asked why the rules should
be “properly enforced” during Riot night
when they are not cntorced at any other
time. Horn then suggested using the
term “normal", Ric MacDowell, SGA
president, disagreed with this suggestion.
noting that most rules are not normally
enforced. The Senate ﬁnally agreed to
simply advocate “enforcement" in the
motion.

Prior to the introduction of Triplett’s
motion; Bill Fligeltaub, c or HP presl<
dent, announced that he has authorized
the Social Committee to explore al-
ternatives to Spring Riot.

Turning to opens, Horn reported that
