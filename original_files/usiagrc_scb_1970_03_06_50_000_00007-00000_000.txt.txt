By Sue Kiner

To “Stamp Out Isolation" is the
goal of a campus-Wide Gold Bond
stainp drive spear-headed by the
Student Recreation Committee.
At one time or other, nearly
every group on campus faces the
problem oilinding transportation
tor a field trip, sports event, or
other oil-campus opportunity.
llowever, we can, literally,
“stamp out" this isolation dilem-
ma \vllh ttie purchase of a new
42 passenger bus. This bus will
be available to all campus
groups, and will, no doubt, prove
to be well worth its weight in
gold lstamps, that is).

Beginning this week, every
member of the campus com-
munity is urged to save his Gold
Bond stamps. as well as Red
Scissors coupons trom Raleigh
and BelAire cigarettes, for this
important project. A total oi 3,120
books of stamps will be needed,
or approximately 3 books per
student, Both McNally’s Super

It is true that this project will
require a large number of
stamps. We must not expect our
bus to be parked in the physical
plant garage next week, but it
is a goal well worth working [07

readily‘ available transportation
fora variety or purposes

To begin this campuswide
campaign, srtc asks each stu
dent to make an initial con»
lt‘lbulloll of whatever number of
stamps he may already have.
The collection point for this first
effort will be Darby Gyin on
Friday evening, March is. The
\volnens' weekend Square Dance
begins at 7.30 PM. that evening.
and the opening of our stamp
campaign is coordinated with
this event, Everyone is welcome
to share the fun this Friday, as
Darby becomes a real “stamping
ground”! However, even it you
can’t stay long at the Square
Dance, do bring your stamps and
coupons. An album and other
prizes will be awarded to those
students making the largest cons
iributions of stamps.

After this initial tapping of our
stamp and coupon resources, the
plan includes working through
leaders of various groups on
campus.

into a teaching position that's unsatisfactory and a
place you can‘t stand. Your prospective students
need your full attention and only if you're happy can
you give them what they need. it's your career, be
selfish enough to make it a good one.

There's no question about it—studenfs in elemeno
tary and high schools need young teachers, wtth
fresh progressive ideas, to answer and satisfy their
thousands upon thousands of questions. Answers
that, when handled creatively and interestingly. not
only give information but cause young minds to
mold into strange~wonderful patterns. A good
teacher is a catalyst. They need you. Chicago needs
you.

But over and beyond their need, a starting salary
of $8,400 annually and one of the highest teacher
salary schedules in the nation indicate that Chicago
wants to satisfy the needs of its community.

Your endeavor may be needy students and an ade-
quate salary—but then again it may be a healthy
nonstop social environment and night life, a 10
mile lake front beach, open air concerts, the ballet
or fine colleges and universities to continue your
education. The community of Chicago, on the shore

usually is itself pursued as an
end in itself; for example, a
student chooses teaching or law}
or medicine as a career because
he considers it as an enjoyable
activity, and at the same time
he expects to earn a salary,
which is a means to an end. The
arts are required because the
appreciation of them is ens
joyable. Finally, physical
education is required {or the sake
of good health, and good health
contributes to the enjoyment of
life. In short, the inductive and
the analytic methods differ in the
manner of stating their goals:
The inductive tends to state the
goal more in terms of means;
the analytic does it in terms of
ends and is Somewhat more in-
clusive. And for those who
proceed inductively, this is
usually the case; for experienced
men who make no study of
analysis are good pragmatists
and have a general feeling of

what a liberal education should,

do, even though they do not spell
it out adequately.

We may summarize the results
so far as follows. An inductive
examination of the goals of a

liberal education suggests
development of intellect, a
career, appreciation of the arts,
development of character, and
health. An analytical approach

‘means happiness as the ultimate

goal and indicates as the means
to it the development of the mind
and of the character in a healthv
body. The phrase “development
of the mind“ here includes that
intellect, a career, and the apo
preciation of the arts. Both the
inductive and the analytic
method take as an axiom the fact
that the kind oi education we be,
defined here is the best of all
kinds of learning relative to the
happiness of a man; A sketchy
and provisional deiinition may
now be given.

A liberally educated person is
one who has acquired (a) a
developed mind (in the sense
indicated above) through learn
ing, (b) a good character
through the exercise or the
proper habits, and (c) the habits
necessary to maintain and
promote a healthy body, all of
these for the sake of a Continuous
life or happiness.

The elaboration of this sketchy
definition is our next concern.
