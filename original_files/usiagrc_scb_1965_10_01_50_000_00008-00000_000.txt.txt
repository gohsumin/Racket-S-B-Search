the kick-off, Kent Thomson made
a diving catch to intercept a Jer-
ry Rizzo pass. The offense tllen
got back in and ground out three
first downs and ran out the clock
to wrap-up the victory.

Coach Edd Bowers was pleased
with the over-all play of his team
in the opening contest, but noted
several areas where improvement
is needed. He was satisfied with
the way the sophomores played
and the way their enthusiasm was
able to help them and the upper»
classmen cover up some errors.

He thought there were no spac-
‘tacular tackles or defensive plays
l but that totally the play was good.
i'l‘he pass rush was effective and
the defensive backfield play was
commendable, although there were
a couple monstrous blunders. He
felt the line play against the rush
up the middle was a little weak,
bul fortunately Cornell did not ex-
ploit this weakness.

Cornell Punt Fails

Cornell received to start the
game After three plays and a
penalty had brought on a fourth
and 16, the Rams attempted to
punt, but the hike was low and
the punter was tackled on the 11-
yard line.

On the second play fullback Jon
Buswell drove to the seven yard
line. From there Barry Anderson
lofted a pass into the end zone to
John Shierllolz for the first score.
Thurston tried the kick but it was
Wide and the Pioneers had a 6-0
lead after less than three minutes
of play,

After the kickoff, the Rams
started a drive with Duane Schultz
and Mike Vinyard carrying the
ball for three first downs w the
pioneer 39. Three plays netted
only five yards and then on fourth
down the Pioneer line stopped the
Rams to take over the ball.

But the Pioneers could not move
and had to punt hack to Cornellr
The Rams then started another
drive. 0n fourth and five on the
Pioneer 30, Jerry Rizzo passed to
all-conference end Rick Schimmell
who lugged the ball to the 21.

But again the Pioneer defense
stiffened and after two running
plays that gained three yards and
two incomplete passes, the Pio-
neers took the ball. The Cornell
defense held though and they re-
gained the ball on the Pioneer 8.3
attend punt. 0n the third play

 

 

Rizzo passed to the two yard line
where Vinyard plunged over. Cor-
nell also missed the kick so the
score was knotted at 66.

Then the Pioneers started a
drive, They drove to the Cornell
27 in five plays where they had a
first down. Three plays gained
nothing, but on the big fourth
down play Jeff Frantz caught a
pass for a first
down on the 13. ‘

neers started another drive. They
got a first down on the Cornell 19‘
After two rushes and an incom-
plete pass, Anderson was creamed
on an attempted pass and Cornell
got the hall. The Rams just ran
out the clock and went into the
locker room with a 146 defl ’t.

 

The Pioneers got. the ball at the
start of the second half but could
not move the ball as they missed
on a fourth down try on their 47.
Cornell drove to the 13, mostly on
a 24~yard pass. But the Pioneer
defense held on three rushes and
one pass. The Pioneers fumbled
the ball right back to Cornell on
the second play. From there Rib

touchdown The Rams tried a 2-
point conversion but the pass was
knocked down.

The Pioneers were forced to
punt again, and then Cornell drove
in to fake the lead. The Zepoint con<
version was made and Cornell had
the lead 20-14.

Then the Pioneers drove for the
final touchdown which gave them
the 21-20 win.

This Week the Pioneers will be
taking on another favorite for the
conference title, Ripon. Coach
Bowers mentioned that Ripon
does many at the same things it
did last year in its win over us,
it has a tough up»the-midd1e run-
ning attack to go with a good
passing game. The Redmen rolled
up 412 yards in its 3&7 win over
Knox last week. Bowers though
thinks they have no speed and only
a little size on the Pioneers.
