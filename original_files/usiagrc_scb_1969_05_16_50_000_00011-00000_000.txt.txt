Black Further V. Charles Smith

Panthers Rap

Black Panther Deputy Minister or De-
fense, V. Charles Smith spoke here Sun-
day to a group of small but interested
students. First planned as a rally, and
billed as including a live rock band, the
event fell apart to some degree; the
rock band failed to show and the crowd
was small, But Smith felt that the
amount of feedback from his hour-long
talk had made the trip worthwhile.

The Black Panthers of Des Moines are
touring college campuses in Iowa this
month to explain their politics and raise
money to rebuild their Des Moines heada
quarters, which was recently destroyed
by a planted bomb.

“It's What's Happening"

ly RICH WlCKSTRDM

Today, from 35 and 7:303:30 a hap-
pening, Crowds will be presented on
Barber Plaza and in Arena Theatre.
Since there is such vast misunderstand-
ing about the iorm or a happening, per-
haps a briet description is in order.

The happening grew, in part, out or
the use of collage, Artists found it in-
adequate to be restricted to a two di-
mensional surface on which to attach
real objects of personal meaning. An
Enviomnment was created, lilling an en
tire room with objects, light, and sound.
It was soon realized that visitors who
entered the Environment became a part
of it. They were given tasks to do.
Eventually people became objects —
their performance was the embodiment
of an idea. As such, no acting, artificial
programmed emotion or movements, is
employed. The happening is composed
of compartmentalized, hermetic units,
arranged in an alogical tashion. There
is no information transmitted from one
event to another. Although indetermin-
acy irequenlly enters the events, it is
carefully controlled by the artist. Im-
provision never occurs in a true hap-
pening. Things do not just happen as
the world would lead one to believe.
Finally, the audienceparticipant barrier
of traditional theatre is broken down to
a greater or lesser extent. Visitors are
at times instructed to pertorm certain
tasks, thus involving them directly in
the action. To (IO—ordinate all of this ad-
mittedly complex action, a script is used

and most happenings are rehearsed Sev-
eral times before production.

Last weekend an Activity (technically
dlfierent but related to a Happening)
was presented in Iowa City by Allan Ka-
prow. it took place in two parts. Part I
consisted of driving to Cedar Bluff. Iowa,
by the banks of the Cedar River and
digging trenches trom the river as far
up the bank as we desired, We were
instructed we could dig in any manner
we wished as long as it was done de-
votedly. A power shovel perlormed the
same tasks as we did. These trenches
were then flooded, the most downstream
one first, by water carried from the
river in titty buckets. We watched the
water ﬂow back to the river, then re-
filled the buckets at the mouth of that
trench and proceeded upstream to the
next one. This was repeated until every
trench (about 7.0 in all) was flooded.
This completed Part 1.

Part II consisted of telling the world
about what we did in Part I. We were
to use any and every means of com-
mnnication at our disposal. As such, the
preceding two paragraphs are part of
the activity at Iowa City which is the
only rationale for their inclusion in this
article.

Anyway, the happening In Grinnel’l.
the project originally oi the Art Collo-
quium (now the project or pltiiully zew
students oi the Art colloquium as
well as other interested students,
inculty members and organizations),
has been written to conform as
closely as possible to an actual happen-
ing. The imagery used in the events,
although more blatant than in most hap-
penings, is aimed at problems and social
conditions which have been hugging us,
For example. a mock cocktail party will
be held in Arena theatre. People will be
given cups with cards attached. On these
cards will be lines; a question, an an-
swer, and an exclamation, one oi which
to be read at random to people you meet
who will respond with a line picked at
random from their card. in another
event, the world of “law enforcement"
will be experienced in a bicycle ride on
central campusr Here come da judge.

One of the main goals of this venture
Is to involve as many people as possible
in activities which are both meaningful
and tun. In most of the events all spec-
tators will become participants. Wear
a costume, bring a bicycle, or just walk
up: it will be enjoyable, and, yes Grin.

Senate Settles Finances

By TOM THOMAS

Money allocations have been the
prime order at business lor the Senate
during the past two weeks. Topics oi
Consideration have included aid to the
Blaira benelit, legal fees tor the Play-
hoy demonstrators, and approval at the
annual budget.

Last Wednesday, the Senate voted to
nllot $50 for legal defense of the “Grln~
nell eight.” The motion, represented by
Senator Andy Loewi, was passed $3.
This week Senator Reggie Graham and
Gina Mills asked that the Senate re-
consider thelr action. Miss Mills com-
mented, “I don’t believe that it was a
decision representative of the student
body." She went on to state that “I pay
a $50 activity fee here and I don’t think
it should go to just eight people."

Tom Thomas responded that he felt
the issue concerned the entire college
campus. “The question here is
whether or not Richard Turner Ind
his cohorts can lntnlde on this cum—
pus with the storm trooper tactics
used in this case and get away
with it" Thomas also pointed out
that well over half the campus had
signed petitions supporting the right
of the demonstrators to protest,
whether or not they agreed with the
tactics used.

Senator Bill Thomas supported tlle
former SGA president by detailing the
methods used by Turner‘s investigators
and cautioning the Senate that such pi-o-
tedures could easily ailect many other
students on the campus. Alter extended
debate, the Senate, on a motion by Art
Knowles, unanimously voted to i-eaiiirm
[be original allocation ivitli a notation ot
indications of student support expressed
through petitions.

The Senate also considered proposed
Cuts in the salarles of AWS and C of
HP presidents. C of HP President Wes

ton apposed such a move on the grounds.

that “this is a value judgment of the-
Senate that can only be made on the
basis Lil what others have done. I think
this is unlair. particularly when It was
assumed that the salary would remain
the same at the time we ran.” The Sen:
ole voted to maintain the salaries at
the present level of £250. Similar dis.
cussion lollowed a proposal to increase
the salary of the Student Coordinator,
which was tabled for furmer discussion.

In earlier action, the Senate allotted
$241 to the Bialra benefit held last Sat-
urday and donated 3100 to the Blalran
Rellei Fund. Drea Dungv. coordinator
at the event, reported Ihat expenditure-
exceeded anticipations, and an addition-
al $55 were allocated for the Initiative
Fund.

in iormulating next year's budget, the
Senate essentially iollowed closely the
lines at this year’s expenditures, The
Grinnell Draft Information Center, how-
ever, received no iunds from SGA in
hopes that the organization will be sup-
ported hy the administration as a coun-
selling service.

A new item In the budget, recom-
mended by last veal-s Finance Com-
mittee was the Public Events Fund.
In explaining the move, Finance
Committee chairman Andrew Brill
said the fund would consolidate the
many expenditures for public events
now being made by SGA imm diverse
accounts. Brill told the 5513 that the
fund was [or events that would not
fall under Ihe jurisdiction of me
Initiative Fund or the Social Coordi-
nating Committee.

SGA President Lew announced that
remaining vacancies on Studentrfaculty
Committees would be tilled in the fall.
It was also reported that the Student
Affairs Committee had recommended
that students living oft-campus next year
have the option of not paying beard tees.
President Leggett has not taken any he
tion as at yet.
