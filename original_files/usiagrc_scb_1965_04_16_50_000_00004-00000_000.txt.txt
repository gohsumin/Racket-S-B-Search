Pepsi denerot‘ionr' ﬁuzzies It Up
To @eﬁeﬁt Foreign Student Fund

Grinnell‘s “Pepsi genera-
tion" has consumed 18,800
bottles of pop during the iast
year, and in the process has
made $3,123 for the benefit of
foreign students.

This combination of business
and pleasure is made possible
through the Pepsi Cola Com-

about four cents on each 10
cent bottle.

The funds made available
through this program are used
for the needs of foreign stu—
dents at Grinnell.

John Fisk, Ray Langham, anti

eign Student Board is ‘to as-
sist foreign students in any
way necessary — in problems
of a personal, financial, or
cultural nature."

Fisk explained that foreign
students come to Grinnell un-
der the auspices of many di -
ferent programs, and it is the
duty of the FSB to keep in
touch with them and their
needs.

“Our goal is to have each

foreign student make himself
sufficient In our society,” Fisk

 

said. “If they are self»sui‘li-
cient when they got here," he
continued, "we do not have a
great deal of concern With
them”

The_ FSB does not plan activ-
ities for the foreign students.
Rather, it works with them un-
der a policy which calls for the
board to make itself available,
and encourage foreign students
to arrange their own actiVlties.
it frequently assists foreign
students, however, with finan-
cial and cultural problems. All
of its activities are handled on
a personal and confidential ba-
SlSr

An interesting part of the
work, which the maintenance
of the Pepsi machines involves,
is that the “supply boys” who
work with Fisk find it their
duty to check the pop machines
in Loose hall basement, to see,
of course, that they are prop-
erly filled. When questioned.
these students, Wendell Webb
and Ray Langham, said that
they find their [ask not un-
pleasant.

An interesting sidelight of
the financial aspects of the pro<
gram was explained by Fisk.
Rather than the loss one might
expect on breakage of bottles.
a net gain is realized. This Si
uation arises because students
bring pop from off campus and
return the empty bottles to the
racks of the campus Pepsi ma-
chines.

The News Students’ Days ac-
tivities for foreign students are
overseen by the FSB, and it
accepts the responsibility of
seeing that all foreign students
have plans for vacations, in-
cluding travel plans, and as-
sisting them, when necessary,
in finding summer jobs.

The FSB works in close co-
operation with Dale Terry, reg-
istrar, who is the adviser for
foreign students, and Leforne
Sequeira, director of student
aid.
