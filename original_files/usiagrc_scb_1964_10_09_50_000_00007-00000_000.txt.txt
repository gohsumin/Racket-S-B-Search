Enthusiastic Conductor, Members
Anticipate 34-5 Orchestra Season

Mass confusionl! That’s what
orchestra rehearsal starts as—
members talking, laughing, ex-
changing instruments; every-
one tuning a different instru-

ment or practicing a different
piece; the director, Denis de
Coteau, helping people in all
parts of the room . . .

Then practice really begins,
a piece is played with numer—
ous stops, suggestions, section-
a1 work-outs on difficult parts;
serious work in order to pro‘
duce by the end of this rehear-
sal or another, a piece that is
perfectly and sensitively
playedi

De Coteau is very enthusias~
tic about Grinnell’s orchestra,

and he is very hopeful about
their season. “At least sixty
per cent of this: year’s orches-
tra are extremely talented
freshmen," he notes, adding
that the upperclassmen are just
as talented. The orchestra is
composed of fifty pieces and
the balance is better than it has
been for many years. The
woodwind, brass, and percus-
sion sections are filled, but
there are still spaces left in the
string section. De Coteau hopes
that additional string players
will Want to try out. “I am
available to them for auditions
any time,” he said. “Rehear-
sals are Tuesday evenings at
7:30 and Thursday afternoons
at 4:153'

Concert master is Arthur
Lowell, a sophomore transfer
student. Assistant conductor is
Dennis Murphy, junior. First
chair cellist is Edward Ding-
ilian, first Chair clarinet is RO—
bert Hanenberg, and first chair
second Violin is Kenneth Clark
—— all freshmen. De Coteau
singled out Carol Benton, Dick
Kraus and Dave Williamson as
his most outstanding upper-
classmen.

The orchestra conductor,
Denis de Coteau, was formerly
the assistant conductor of the
Stanford University Orchestra
and conductor of the San Fran-
cisco All City High- School Or-
