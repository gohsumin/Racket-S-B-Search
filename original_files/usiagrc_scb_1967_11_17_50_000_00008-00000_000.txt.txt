SUPER SEASON
$FOR FIGHTING FROSH

I By JEFF SCHECKTER

-r he a result of numerous
threats by the freshmen, a poi-
son pen letter and the plead-
ings of a beautiful cheerleader,
the story of the freshman
football team is now being re-
leted.
This year's squad is the only
, beaten and untied team in
life history of Grinnell fresh-
men football. 1n compiling this
0rd, the Pioneers defeated
Elimell 22-21, Knox 23-14, and
08 124).
A talk wlth Coach Pfitsch m.
ealed that at least 13 of the
1 players on the team are
ready to compete with the van
llty in the Midwest Conference.
The freshmen won their
ames on the strength of their
Ens, the querterbacking of
dry Johnson and the mining
of left halfback Roy Lewis.
“The two guards, Steve
ﬂutchlngs and Larry Grimm,
are two of the finest l have
vet coached,” said Coach
fitsch. They were backed by

Jim Edwards and Tom Cole,
two more excellent linemen.
Doug Lewis was outstanding
as an offensive center and the
tackles Karlan, Rose, Pope
and Hamilton were coming on
stronger with every game.

The ends, Gary Jones and
John Czerwinski, played very
well as both blockers and re«
ceivers. Gary Jones hauled in

ed for one/third of Grinnell’s
scoring.

Gary Johnson was excellent
in his quarterbacklng, both as
a signal-caller and as a player.
Gary passed for three touch-
downs and four extra points in
a three game season.

Roy Lewis was the work-
horse of the backfield, can-y.

downs, and should be a poten<
tial All - Conference runner.
The remainder of the mnning
chores were ably performed by
Jim Spell and Bob Haythome.
both of whom were playing out
of normal positions.

The first two games were
played by a nervous and inex-
perienced team. Twice the
trash were forced to come from
behind in the fourth quarter to
win. The last game with Coo,
however, was quite different.
Despite the muddy field and
the cold weatller, Grinnell
scored the first time it had the
ball. Keeping on the ground,
Grinnell rolled to a 12—0 lead
at halftime, The mud grew
worse and the defense grew
better and Grinnell eventually
won the game after a scoreless
second half.

The 21 players on the team
will be welcomed next year by
the varsity. Many of this
year's starters are seniors.
Look for Jones, Johnson,
Grimm, Hutchings, and many
other irosh to be playing first
string on the Pioneer varsity
next season.
