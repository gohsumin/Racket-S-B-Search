Cagers to [lost Siwasll, Scots

By John Moore
5&3 Staff Writer

Grinnell’s basketball team will
entertain Knox and Monmouth
this weekend on the home court,
following a road trip which all
but eliminated any hope of the
Pioneers repeating as Confer-
ence champions.

Last Friday night the Pioneers
dropped a 70-68 decision to lea—
gue leading Ripon after a hip
and tuck battle. The next day
Grinnell was defeated by Law—
rence, the team they had beaten
by 25 a week before, by the score
of 73—70. The vikings scored six
free throws in the last 44 sec—
onds to cap a come-fromabehind
victory.

Jim Miftlin, however, did suc—
ceed ln piling up 81 points in
three games to move into fourth
place in the individual scoring
race with a 20.5 average.

It appears that a balanced
scoring attack with respectable
free throw shooting will be the
key to this Weekend’s games. If
the Pioneers can find this bal-
ance, the Siwash and the Scots

Swimmers sink Knox 56-36

in the first Conference duel
of the season the Grinnell
swimming team defeated Knox
56-36 at the Grinnell pool Feb.
2.

The tankers will continue
their conference action today at

morrow at 10 am. against Law.
rence.

In only two events did a
Knox swimmer finish ahead of
a Pioneer. Grinnell got 9 out
of 11 firsts.

RALPH PRAY set a new
Grinnell and pool record in the
500 freestyle in a time of 6105.2.
He also swam freestyle legs of
the winning 40!) yard medley
and 400 yard freestyle relays.

Jim Adelrnan won the zoo
butterfly and Jim Cross the zoo
backstroke. They both swam on
the two winning relays,

John Teget and Howard
Schein, who swam in their
ﬁrst meet this year, swept the
shorter freestyle events. Teget
won the 60 and mo and Schein

was second in the loo and I

won the zoo. In addition Te-
get was a member of the
freestyle relay and Schein
was third in the 500.

The sixth member of Grin—
nell’s team, Palmer Haiti, won
the zoo yard breaststroke, was
second in the 160
medley and was a member of
the medley relay

COACH mv SIMONE called
the /win' “an indication of good
spirit and morale." He feels that
the team is beginning to get

into shape, but that a lot more]

work will be needed before the
conference meet,

The Pioneers will get a good
look at some of the conference
strength this weekend as they

could have a long ride home.
And with six consecutive home
games, the Pioneers might still
end the season with a respect.
able wm-ioss percentage .

Neither Knox nor Monmouth
can boast a winning record but
they could easily surprise a ﬂow
teams in their remaining seven
games.

The siwash, holding a five-
wln, six-loss record, will be
headed by Otis Cowan, who is
averaging a nifty 17.7 points a
game. standing only 5’ 10",
Cowan is an amazing jumper
and can run and shoot. Flanking
Cowon will be a pair of rapidly
improving sophomores, Jim Jepa
son and Ed Havens, who will
handle the rebounding chores.

Lack of height will definitely
hurt the Siwash. Not a man on
the squad stands over 641, and
unless they are able to get posi-
tion on rebounds, the Pioneers
should control both boards.

In their first encounter at
Galesburg, Knox took a close

one 7572. Mifﬂin and John Sun—

loit has lost only to the confer-
ence power Carleton. Lawrence
has lost only to Beloit and
Carleton.

Beloit has a very strong free—
lstyle team with Bill Boyd, a
lteam co~capizin, Bob Godfrey
and Bill Putnam, who was last
year’s freshman champion in thel
so and loo yard freestyle.

Beloit also has John Vanl

points respectively, while Cowan
pumped in 19 points and Jepson
18 points for Knox.

On Saturday, the winless Scots
invade Darby Gym. Missing on
this years squad is Jeri-y Mell,
who was the kcy to the Scots
second place finish last year.
However, the playmakcr of last
year’s squad, Terry Wilkison,
has adequately taken over Mcll's
scoring role and is currently
averaging 19.1 points a game,

The Scots boast a team with
a lot of height. The squad
avearges o3 which would indi-
cate a lot of strength under the‘
boards. This rehbunding strength
is centered around two big
iuniors, Al Carius at 6’ 5" and
Harold Rathgeb at 6’6". Carin:
and hathgeb can also be count-
ed on to score in double figures.

Grinnell took a close one from
the Scots. 55.33, at Monmouth
early in January. Mifﬂin, Sun-
dell, Denny Asby and Gar Smith
all scored in double ﬁgures.
Wilkison scored 19 points for
the Scots but didn’t get the
usual support from Carius, who

scored only seven points. l

Slyke who holds 6 pool ree—
ords at Bell) Van Slyke can
and may swim any event but
will probably swim the indi-
vidual medley and zoo yard
butterfly.

LAWRENCE has a more bal-
anced squad with standouts
Pete Betzer and Larry Dick-I
man in the backstroke, Dickl
Snyder in the breaststroke and
Mike Hartong and Chris Vogel
in freestyle events.

 

A threeplatooned high scur~
