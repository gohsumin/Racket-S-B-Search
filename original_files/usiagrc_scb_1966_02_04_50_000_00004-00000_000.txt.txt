At last count, we had more than 3,800 news
paper editors on our list of subscribers to The
Christian Science Monitor. Editors from all
over the world.

There is a good reason why these "pros” read
the Monitor: the Monitor is the world's only
daily international newspaper. Unlike local
papers, the Monitor focuses exclusively on
world news — the important news.

The Monitor selects the news it considers
most signiﬁcant and reports it, interprets it,
analyzes it — in depth. It takes you further into
the news than any local paper can.

If this is the kind of paper you would like to
be reading, we will send it to you right away at
half the regular price of $24.00 a year.

Clip the coupon. Find out why newspaper-
men themselves read the Monitor — and why
they invariably name it as one of the live best
papers in the"world.

SAGA Gives $280
For Project Fast

Bill Downey, chairman of the
Des Moines Project, has provided
SAGA wilh the signatures of 710

. . . Lower (lamp

students who have agreed to last

as a mud-raising project for the
group, The fast will be held on

Friday night Feb. 25, and will nei

the group $230.

The idea of a fast as a fund-
raising pi'olect began last year
when the Civil Righis group made
an agreement with SAGA. The
terms of the pact were that the
group would receive 5.40 in each
person idsiing, and 5.60 each if
enough students fasted to allow
one dining room to be closed (700
siudenls) This year, however, SAr
GA reiused [0 give any funds un-
less 700 students fasted. Although
the required number agreed, and
Cowles dining room will be closed,
SAGA will allow only $.40 per sub
dent for lhis fast.

The refund from SAGA will be
used to support project leader
Billy King and to furnish trans-
pnrtalion to Des Moines (or the
ihiny Grinnellians participating in
the program.

Current goals are establishment
of a “tenants’ union” and im-
provement of housing conditions
in Walnut Hills, the area of Des
Moines in which the group is
working.

“We’re looking for volunteers oi
all backgrounds and abilities," re-
ported John Herbert, leader oi the
VISTA contingent. He described
VISTA vulunicsrs as “people who
can listen, understand, and com-
municate with others and who are
committed enough to live and
work for a year among the poor
of this country.”

At present, 1,700 VISTA volun-
leers are in training or on assign<
ment to poverty areas throughout
the United States. Serving on in-
dian reservations, among migrant
farm workers, in urban slums,
and in rural packets or poverty
from Appalachian hollows in Alan
kan villages, lhey are “involved
in a list of activities as long as
lhe problems which poverty cre-
ates," Herbert noted. ,

Persons over 18 are eligible to
