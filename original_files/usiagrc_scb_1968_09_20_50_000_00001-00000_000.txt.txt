"ROTC, or the Department of
Aerospace Studies, exists on the
Brlnnell Campus, for the de-

artment and the college iinds
t mutually beneficial," stated
Captain Purdom of the Grin<
IIBll ROTC.

The Captain explained that
ROTC is valuable to the stu-
dent “because it opens up op-
tlons—career options and op-
tlons in meeting military obliga-
tlons. Tile program is flexible
enough that it can grow and
change with the student’s needs;
he gets out oi military service
the most advantageous expein
ience. also, the students get an
opportunity to see what ‘this
military business’ is all about.
It’s important for an educated,
responsible citizen to See what
the issues oi national security
are."

In return, Grinnell students
beneﬁt ROTC by the “sense of
values the liberally educated
man brings to the activities he
engages in. The liberally edu-
cated man brings to ROTC a
Width of mental Vision and a
willingness to question.”

“We don’t help the school fl-
nancially — at least not direct
Iy," stated the Captain. Indirect-
ly, the scholarship money ROTC
gives to students might free
some college money, but the
Captain declared that ROTC is

A suggestion has been made
to the Senate that a fast be held

The idea for the drive origi-

Off-Campus Girls
Get New Houses

There are three new off-cam-
pus houses at Grinnell this
year: interracial House, Con-
ference House, and French
House.

Two of the three, interracial
and Conference, were born in
the desire ior understanding
that followed the assassination
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
French House is the successor
to a similar house that existed
three years ago, according to
its president, Barbara Weitz,
’69. ,

The largest of the
houses is Interracial, With
16 girls. President of the
house is Sherri DesCliamps, ’69,
who was one oi a group respon~
sible for the founding of the
house.

Thirty girls applied to live
in the house last semester, and
each wrote a short essay de<
scribing wily they thought the
house should be started and
what it should do.

Five books are on a planned
reading list, and discussion of
the books will be the equiva-
lent of another course. The
house is also planning to set
up a library with AWARE (As
sociation Di Whites for Advance-
ment of Racial Equality) for
general use to be financed
through funds supplied by the
SGA. Discussions open to the

By CONNIE ERICSON

A boycott of grapes served
by Saga planned in response
to the California table grape
pickers’ strike, “Wlll undoubted.
ly be effective,” promised Bern-
ard Mergen (History), “if
enough students can be iniormed
about the strike and the rele<
vancy of the boycott."

The workers, numbering about
3,000, are striking ior the second
year against inadequate unem-
ployment insurance. only partial
Social Securtity benefits, and
lack or minimum wage bancilts,
sick leave, vacation pay, rest
periods, and collective bargain-
ing rights.

The boycott, even if only par.
tially successiul, can affect the
amount oi grapes purchased by
SAGA and thus the grape grow-

Council of House Presidents yesterday with 57%
of the vote, urges a campus survey and vote on the

issue of open dorms.

NEW HEATING
COOLS STUDENT

Linda Cutler, ’70, cannot
open her window as a result
of a change in the heating
system of Main Hall. in the
past, each resident or the
hall could control the temv
perature of her own room by
a knob on the radiator. Now
there is a central thermos
tat for the hall, located in
Cutler’s room.

She is told that opening her
window would affect this
central thermostat and tllus
change the temperature or
all the other rooms in the
hall.

Picnic Posier
Makes Diggers,
Saga Slew

"steal silverware from Saga,"
advised a poster advertising
Saturday night’s digger picnic
at Conference House. It was
rumored on campus that Ralph
Pomerenk, Director of Resi-
dences, intended to close Cnn-
ference House because he was
so angered by the poster’s pro-
pasal.

It was also said that all in
ventory oi Saga silverware
would be taken before and after
the Saturday evening meal in
order to bill Conference House
for any spoons and ibrks found
missing, Neither rumor was
substantiated.

Bruce Nissen, the poster mak-
er, accepted respoiisibility lor
the “steal silverware” idea. Nis-
sen, a Loose Hall junior, said,
“Pomerenk is conducting a
witch hunt against the off-cam-
pus houses. He tried to enrol-

/nate them this year. The digger
dinner got him maddest.”

Why Pomerenk was most
angry about the dinner Nissen
could not explain. Several stu<
dents gave accounts similar to
Nissen’s.

The president of Conference
House, Catherine Jones, ‘69,
said she had heard nothing
about the closing of the house.
She surmised that Pomerenk
“was afraid that the house was
going to be mutilated, They

Sam Chandler (’69), Doug Fink

primary held Wednesday. only
three-fourths oi the men voting

total vote represents less than
20% of the male students on
campus.

The push for both alternating
and open dorms has “gone too
slow” for Maril, who proposes
a full . scale campaign to In-
form Students of the issues. He
is sure a student vote iavoring
either or both issues would force
the adminisiraiion to comply. “I
am perfectly willing to go
through the structure of the
SGA to bring about this change."

of alternating dorms “they are
