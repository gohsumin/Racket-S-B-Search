FeministsStute Their Position

Saturday the WL Conference
continued with the workshops
listed in last week‘s 5&8. Ap-
proximately half the huge
workshop attendance was from
Grinnell. Outside participants
included a surprising number
of married adult women inad-
dition to the expected college
students. While some work-
shops admitted men, most did
not in order to encourage free
exchange. Women were able
to ask questions and exchange
opinions about such subjects
as day (are centers, lesbian»
ism, and communal living.
Discussions were led by soc~
iologist Barbara Chesin,
Shannon, the Iowa City WLF,
and the Feminists.

Judging from participant re-
sponse, the workshop ”Mari
riage and Sexual Intercou-
rse," led by the New York
based Feminists, was prob
ably the most interesting and
controversial. It exposed a
split between old style liberal
and radical WL groups on the
subject of whether or howwm
men should relate to men. The
Feminists began by stating
their position as the first gre
cup in the country to demand
the abolition of marriage.
They saw it as an institution
which benefits men entirely
at Women's expense. While the
Feminists did not rule out
forever all malerfemale rec
lationships, they declared:
"For right now we're more
interested in women relating
to women. For the present,
relationships with men can be
very destructive. They take up
a lot of time and energy, if
nothing else." The Feminist
aim is not "telling women
how to achieve a happy life,
but telling them to struggle
to achieve freedom.”

The Feminists raised them-
teresting question: ”Why sh—

ould it ever be a good thing to
have a relationship between
two people (marriage) that
cannot be broken except by
permission of the state?"
They also demanded that men
and women share equally in
the job of rearing children.
In the second half of the work-
shop, participants fired their
questions and approval or (1115’
agreement at the Feminists.
A Digger dinner of stew and
bread in Gardner Lounge and
informal discussions filled
Saturday evening.

Sunday morning a large grr
oup considered ”WL: A Basis
for Radical Social Change."
A representative from Gle
men explained What she be-
lieved wives and daughters of
military men could do to im-
prove living conditions for en-
listed men and their families.
She said: 'Wlost people aren‘t
afraid to fight if there‘s a
chance of winning. And if you
know how to organize against
the army, you can win in sig
nificant areas. Like officers
can be courtrmarshalled for
mistreating men, so somebo-
dy should see thatthisis done.
Struggles that WL leads are
not just for women but can
benefit all people. A struggle
against the army is a perfect
illustration of this."

NeXt Bonnie Tinker, an Am-
erican student familiar with
the Mexican student move-
ment, discussed Latin Amer-
loan attitudes towardWL. Ti ,
ker said that Latin women dis-.
trust WL because they see it

as ”a frivolous plaything for

the wealthy American gringa.
They don't see how it relates
to their struggles for landand
food. WL has to find a way to
turn on to the very realstrug—
gle in which these people are
engaged." A participant ex-
pressed concern that taking

Last weekend Grinnell Col*
lege was host to a Women’s
Liberation Conference that
drew participants from WL
groups and private individuals
all over the Mid\vest.The Fri-
day night session, "A Defini-
tion of Women's Liberation,"
opened to men and women and
filled Roberts. Marlene Dixon
and Shannon formed a panel
moderated by a Grinnell WLF
members. Shannon, from the
Twin Oaks, Virginia, experir
mental community, began dis
cussion by explaining how that
community tries to overcome
stereo~typed sex roles. Then
Marlene Dixon presented her
provocative views, which set
the tone for the rest of the
evening.

Dixon, a sociologist now at
McGlll University in Monte
real, expressed serious dis-
satisfaction with WL in this
country. She said: "I don’t
think the movement's about
liberation . . . [used to think
the female capacity for emr
pathy was so great that it we
balked to women about their
own oppression, they would . . .
reach across class and race
lines to work for liberation of
all people." However, because
WL ismade up ofmiddlevclass
women, it has too much at
stake in the seams quo towork
for significant social im-
provement." Addressing the
college women in the audience,
Dixon charged, "You don't

WL to Latin America was a
form of “cultural imperial-
ism." Tinker agreed mat cul-
tural differences and North
American afﬂuence make the
situation sensitive: “it's very
hard for a North American to
go to Latin America and not
be an exploiter."

Before breaking into smaller
units for more specific cons
versation, opinions were ex-
changed about the general suc-
cess of the Conference. Most
women agreed that it gave
them “an overwhelming feel-
ing of sisterhood." Differen—
ces in philosophy and tactics
were apparent, and no abso-
lute answers were found. Still,
it was encouraging to note the
large number of uncommitted
women who came to the Con-
ference to listen and learn.
At least the Conference suc-
ceeded in provoking thought on
several important questions
that WL faces.

Dixon Claims

While attending the WL C0“,
ference, Marlene Dixon also
addressed the general college
community about the situation
in Quebec. At a Sunday after
noon gathering in Younker Lo-
unge, she presented the back-
ground for recent terrorist
and separatist activities. Di»
xon stressed the importance
of viewing Quebec as a colony
exploited by both Anglor Can-
adian and American investors.
”There is," she said, ”A kind
of racism in Canada that Am-
ericans are not accustomed
to » the cultural racism his-
torically practiced by the An
glor Canadians against the
French Canadians."

For many years the Catholic
Church was used to control
the people of Quebec. This

want to risk your classprivilr
eges to translate academic
thoughts into useful actions
. . . To ask only forthe repeal
of abortion laws, for birth con-
trol, etc., is not to serve the
poor and the black. They need
more ~ like nationalizedmedi~
cine or the end of the AMA.”

The panel opened for quest-
ions, directedchieflyat Dixon.
She was asked to clarify her
statement that exploitation of
women was inherent to capit-
alism. Greatly condensed, her
reply is that when factories
took away women’s economic
importance in suchhome tasks
as weaving or canning food,
capitalism made middle- class
women into mere ornaments.
Meanwhile, poor women were
economically exploited either
as factory workers or as
housewives in city slums. Di—
xon argued that such oppres-
sion is as much part of capit-
alism as, for example, the
permanent choice between in~

flation andunemployment. lie»
fusing to tag scapegoats, she
said, ”The white male supre-
mists in Washington are im—
pelled by the insanity of the
system. There’s nothing they
can do within it. But is there
anything that says you have to
have capitalism , anything
written on a stone by the hand
of God?”

Asked to name remedies for
what she called “the inhumanr
ity of the U.S. industrial cess-
pool,” Dixon suggested, “You
have to deal with specific is-
sues in the community. Der
mand loml control of hospit-
als and support laboring wen
men. Support young people who
build communes that protest
this anti-human envirour
ment."

A dynamic speaker, Dixon's

, remarks introduced the major

theme of the conference -
WL's responsibility tosociety
and exactly what forms that
responsibility should take.

Men’s lib Reiects Stereotypes

by Bill Knecht

"Men are leading only half
a life," was the tone of last
Saturday’s Men‘s Lib meeting
at 1:00 in Gannaway House.

“Men have the capacity to
act in passive and intimate
ways," went the general ad-
mixture of thought, "although
they are generally taught by
our society to adopt aggres-
sive and egocentric modes of
behavior."

Saturday’s discussion cent-
ered on the differing roles of
men and women in the White
Anglo-Saxon society. It was
generally agreed that both
sexes had capacities for a
broad spectrum of behaviors
and emotions, although our
society tended to push males
to one side and females to
the other.

Males were Viewed as being
naught to assume aggressive,
dominant, egocentric, indeper
ndent roles, and to view the
World as a battleground with
fierce competition for the best
jobs, the most power, and the
best women. At the other ex-
treme, women were viewedas
being proselytized to be sub
missive, unquestioning, emo-
tional, and seductive ~ to
strive to become ripe fruits
waiting to be picked by hand
some princess.

Neither the "ripefruit" cone
cept nor the “handsome pri-
nce" theory seemed accept~
able to the Men’s Lib'ers.

They thought it time to dispel
these notions and to begin
viewing both sexes as 'equai
members of the human race.

Although they lcnew that men
would have to relinquish their
monopoly on power to effect
sexual equality, most of those
present agreed that this wasa
reasonable price to pay for
each sex’s development of the
”other half" of its human po-
tential.

Men's Lib is not a new ph-
enomenon at Grinnell. Two
other attempts have been made
in recent years to found sim-
ilar organizations. Bothfailed
due to lack ofinterestand fail‘
ore of heads to "come toger
ther", due to differing poli-
tical objectives.

As it stands today, Men's
Lib has the potential to be a
going concern. Its members
include some of the mostpro-
minent people on campus.
They do not pretend, however,
to push for campusrwide pube
licity ornotoriety. Character-
isticaliy, meeting times are
spread by word of mouth, po-
tential members being invited
to sit in on a rap session and
relate their personal exper-
iences to the others.

Men’s Lib is neither rhetors
ical nor political. It is per-
sonal. lt pretends no goals
other than those of the self-
fulfillment of individual dis
cussion and enlightenment. As
such, it will never beat mass-
participation endeavor, but it
will be a going concern.

Cultural Racism Exists In Canada

control took the form of ch-
urch schools. Eventually bet-
ter endowed government sch-
ools in the rest of Canada left
French students behind in the
competition for higher educa-
tion and technical jobs. In re
cent years, complaints from
the people caused the Quebec
province government to open
technical schools and make
colleges more accessible to
the French. According to Dix»
on, this liberal pacifloation
proved to be a "dragon."
Students were prepared for
professional openings that did
n0t exist in Quebec, and their
education helped them under"
stand the causes for the pro-
Vince’s economic problems.
A student movement developr
ed. At the same time uneme

ployment, inﬂation, andgrow-
ing welfare rolls drove labor
to militant strikes. Because
the frustrated students were
the children of striking WOI‘k’
ers, the two movements unir
ted as student- labor move-
ments rarely do.
Emphasizing the importance
of American investment in
Quebec, Dixon noted that five
years ago a U.S. Department
of Defense study found Quee
bec to be one of severalareas
in the world where U.S. counr
ter-lns urgency tactics were
needed. Thus, Dixon argued
that U.S. interests saw theme
selves threatened even before
the actual separatist move-
ment started.
