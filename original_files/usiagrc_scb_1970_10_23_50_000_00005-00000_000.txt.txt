Diplomat Visits Campus,
Pushes Foreign Service

by Mark Sablemon

Myron Koenig, retired Dean
of the Foreign Service lnStl’
tute of the State Department,
was here Monday to speak on
“The State Department and
the Academic Community."

Mr. Koenig addressed him~
self to the "gap of misunder-
standing" between the Dep-
artment and the universities
and said that the gap is neir
ther new nor easily bridged.

Much of the gap is histori-
cal ,_ it was not, for exam-
ple, until 1946 that Congres
created the Foreign Service
Institute (FSI) with relation to
the State Department analon
gous to the relationship betw-
een the military institutes
such as West Point and Anna
polls and the Defense Departs
merit.

The military institutes, Koen
nig explained, “train men to
win a conflict when it breaks
out; the function of the SF
ate Department and its train-

‘ ing institute, the F51, is “to
try and preclude that conflict
from breaking out in the first
place.‘I

Koenig emphasized the im-
portance of the Foreign Ser-
vice Institute by telling of a
visit by President Kennedy
in 1963. The President, on
this rare visit to a relatively
small part of the government,
complimented the shaff on the
fine job they were doing to
prepare foreign service offie
cers to understand the coun-
tries they were assigned to.

Russian A

by Debby McKnight.

To the clinking of coffee cups
on saucers, Professor James
Billington made his first ad*
dress on the Grinnell campus
October 2i. 01 the faculty of
Princeton University, Billing-
ton's impressive Russian culr
tural and historical credent-
ials include his book, The Icon

and the Axe, an interpretive ‘

cultural history of ‘Russia.
Russian majors, history and
language students comprised
the bulk of a sizable audience
at Grinnell House for the in-
formal morning ofdiscussion.
The principle topic was the
seventeenth'century Church
Schism. This split, analogous
to the Western Reformation,
affected an equal number of
people and hadsimilar impore

it .

Kennedy asked, however, to
what degree the PSI prepared
the diplomat for representing
the United States in foreign
countries. This remark, Koee
nig said, triggered a reorder”
ing of the curriculum within
the FSI toward better educat-
ing the diplomat in American
studies.

The foreign service exam
as it is now set upfavors Ame
erican Studies as the college
major most likely to prepare
a man or woman as a dip10*
mat; at least, those who may
or in it are more likely to
pass the exam. The majors
with the next highest probab-
lity of passing the exam are
philisophy, mathematics, in-
ternational trade, Russian
studies, chemistry, econom-
ics, history, politicalscience,
and English.

These top ten offortymajors
show the emphasis on the exe
am and in the State Depart-
ment is for breadth of know
ledge, rather than depth in
any particular academicarea.
Majors in specificforeign lan<
guages are often notas advan-
tagious to the Department
as it might seem, Koenigsaid,
since approximately 20% of
those majors require further
training by the F51.

Rearrangements or expan—
si'ons of the State Depart-
ment’s academic curriculum,
however, are not enough to
bridge the gap between the
Department and the acader

Prol Studies Faculty Workload

by Laura Shook

Professor Robert F. Voert-
man of theEconomics Depart-
ment recently completed an
analysis of the faculty work
load and its relation tostudent
demand as a factor in salary

tant effects on the society in
which it occurred. Besides
answering specific questions
about the Schism, Billington
dealt with it as an example of
cultural revolution and an il‘
lustration of several recur-
rent themes in Russianhis
tory.

He also spoke more gener-
ally about Russian societyand
suggested what he considered
one of its greatest strengths:
"I think we're coming to the
end of the age in whichwe held
the belief - very widespread
in the West , that there are
political solutions toall human
problems. In this respect Rus-
sian culture is far ahead ofus
because they never accepted
that kind of thing in the first
place."

to another question, Billings
ton made some of his mOSt
provacative comments in re-
ference to the study of his-
tory: ”Nothing is more irre—
levant than the hiStory of ten

or fifteen years ago . . . You,

have to go back at least 100
years to findanything ofvalue.
People are running around
new setting up courses in re*
volution because they think
everybody's in a revolution-
ary mood. Students are doing
things nobody understands, so
everybody‘s Studying the Re—
volution of 1917. But I believe
that the events leading to the
revolts of 1848 are far more
applicable now."

Following the discussion,
Billington lunched with sev—
eral students and Russian face
ulty members where the con-
versation included the prof
essor's own revolutionary th-
eory. A true revolution must
be a complete change from
existing cond' ons back to a
“natural state." Since this
involves such toral change, no
revolutionary party can anti-
cipate its results and should
not attempt or be expected to
attempt describing a program
of "what it will be like after
the revolution." late in the
afternoon Billington wasagain
available in the Forum coffee
house when American educa—
tion joined Russia as a cone
vers‘ation topic.

His evening lecture, “Nature
and Significance of Intellec-
tual Ferment in the Soviet
Union," began by classingSor
viet dissent with a world-wide
search for humanism in reac~
tion against modern bureaus
cracy and technology. Specifr
ically in Russia, Billington
considered the ferment of
youth and of renewed internal
nationality conflicts. His gr»
eatest emphasis was on the

(Continued to page 7)

expenditure for the college.

He saw the need for the study
as a member of the Executive
Council last year when he was
constantly confronted with a
lack of information as to the
cost of certain programs and
the use of faculty time.

His study concerns someasr
pects of the economics invol-
ved in faculty manpoweras re-
lated to student enrollment,
in hopes of arriving at a con-
clusion about possible re-dis-
tribution of future workloads
which might cut down on the
necessary number of faculty.

A brief explanation ofVoertr
man’s study follows, but, as
the author himself stressed,
“It defies any useful inferen-
ces about quality variables
among programs."

For purposes of research,
work loads were established
in terms of points, which inn
cluded courses taught for cre-
dit, labs, independent project
supervision, appliedmusicler
ssons, direction of perform-
ance groups, contact hours in
coaching and recreation pro
gram work, and were extend-
ed to special tasks such as

administrative dutie. . Exam-

ples of these measurements

are as follows:

Regular course . . . 3points

Independent project . . .1 point l
per l2 credit hrs ‘
Labs in credit courses . . . 2
points

Applied music . . . l pointper
3 registrations

Direction of Performance gr—
oups . . . 3 points each

Coaching, recreation, etc. . .
1/3 point per contact hour

Dept. Chairman . . . 1 point
per semester

Faculty Chairman . . . Spoints
per semeSter

The assignment ofpoints was
made according to a system
developed at Princeton which
enjoys wide use.

Using this system, tenpoints
per semester (twenty per
year) was consideredanormal
workload for each faculty men
mber.

According to the data from
the academic year 1969770,
Voertman measured workao
tivities of the faculty usingthe
point system, which yielded
the following results:
