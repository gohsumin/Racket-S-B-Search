JD'S ——THE SPOT T0 EOVCDTT — FOR STEAKS

By ANNE TAYLOR

oh my poor disciples or full and gaityl I sincerely bemoan
your predicament this weekend at being isolated in the social
vacuum at Grinnell campus. I might suggest bciore unveiling the
oliicial Collegerurlented events or this weekend that you begin
now trying your imaginative powers ot divining means of self
entertainment.

This weekend is so dull that it might interest you to know
that last night you missed Palrick and Joan Purswcll’s Piano
and Flute Recital in Robert’s Theatre,

If the multitude of psychedelic posters plastered all over cams
pus have not yet revealed it, let me be the iirst to tell you that
this weekend Grinnell College is devoting herself religiously to
drugs. That is not to say she has gone to pot, but rather Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday will be set aside for an indepth Drug
Symposium.

This study or the drug scene was initiated last night with ii
program on Drug Education led by Dr, Joel Fort tram the Uni-
verSlty ot Caliiornia. The seminar program will continue today
with a Panel Lecture on Drugs at 3 pm. in Robert’s. The panel-
ists will include Dr. Joel Fort, Dr. Paul E. Bodlne from Iowa
State College and Mr. Frederick Garlield, Deputy Director or the
Bureau oi Drug Abuse Control.

At 7:30 p.m. Dr, Bodiue will lecture in Robert's Theatre, and
at 9:15 individual discussion groups will term in the lounges 0!
Loose, Younkers, and Main.

On Saturday morning at 10, Mr. Garfield will lead an In-
formal discussion in the South Lounge ol the Forum, and Dr.
Loren Woods mm the University ol lowa will wrap up the Sym-
posium Willi a lecture in Robert’s Theatre at 1:30 in the afternoon.

Well, how are you coming with ideas of What to do with
yourseli for three days, other than holing up in the library with
your iavorite volume of the Congressional Record?

Suggestion: Take a census ot The Grinnell College squirrel
population. Or, just try and iigure out what on earth they're
doing running in packs irom tree to tree, trom the comiort of
your Forum chair.

All your liydrohabituaies may rejoice along with those land-
lubbers gone a-seg for open SWlmming will be available Friday
irom 8:30 to lo p.m., Saturday irom 3 to 5 p.m., and Sunday night.

You ilick addicts might stick around though, cause the Social
Co. Committee has come up With a few good ones. Friday night
at 10 p.m. and Sunday at 9, sadists and history majors alike Will
enjoy the bloody epic of czai-ist Russia, Ivan the Terrible, a ﬁlm
in two parts, in ARH auditorium.

Saturday night, Charlton Heston, as a US. Cavalry ollicer
rides to uphold Truth, Justice and the American Way in the quasi-
Blblical Western, Major Dundee. The superrfabulous ﬂick promot-
ing sex and violence will be shown at 10 pm in ARH.

At 8 pm, also Saturday night, Father Ian Mitchell will hold I
Folk Concert in Robert's Theatre.

In chapel Sunday morning (which is held at 11:00 am for
those of you who don’t normally attend), Father Mitchell will be
conducting his Folk Mass (Episcopalian in nature) with the as.
sistance of the College Choir, as he did last year,

Well, that's it for better or worse and if you still don't like
it you can aways watch TV or better yet, ﬁnd out who your fellow
students really are.
