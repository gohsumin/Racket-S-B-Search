That deplorable example of
misplaced educational values,
exhibitionism, over-recruiting
and Big IO-ism, (IM football)
is about to begin and most of
the teams’ masterminds are
molding their behemoths into
the proverbial well-oiled ma-
chines.

There will be some changes
in the format and the schedul-
ing procedures, but for the
most part it will be just good,
dirty run.

with so many question marks
to be filled by preps, prediC<
tions are senseless. Word has
it, however, that Smith is load-
ed. When I asked Jim Randall
for a statement, the cautious

’ pessimist admitted that, “We’re

great!" sounds as if they like
their trophy.

Possible contenders? Who
knows? Dibble and West could
surprise. The only sure bet is
the sportsmanship award which
will doubtless go to Clark

 

Team Trounces Northern Illinois

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell soccer team,
led by record-shattering Vincent
Anku, trounced Northern llli~
nois on Saturday oz. Anku
scored six goals and set up an-
other one as he broke the Grin-
nell record. for most goals

scored by oneplayer in a.

match.

The match started slowly
with both teams missing scor-
ing opportunities. Then with
two minutes left in the first
quarter, Anku got the ball and
left three men, including the
goalie, sprawling in his wake
as he scored into an open net,
Just before the quarter ended
Anku took a pass and scored

his second goall

Northern Illinois scored its
first goal in the second quarter
on a penalty kick, Later with
less than a minuteiin the half,
Ted Cole wove around the de-
fense and scored to give Grin-
nell a 3—1 half-time lead.

The third quarter found Anku
scoring two goals, one on a pen-
alty kick, and getting an assist
on a goal by Fred Miller.
Northern Illinois scored a goal
late in_ the period to bring the
score to 6-2.

Persistent Vincent Anku con-
tinued his rampage in the fourth
quarter with two more goals
and one, for the sake of variety,
he kicked in leftrfooted.
