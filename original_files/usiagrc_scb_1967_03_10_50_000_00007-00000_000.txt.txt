Bake Sale This Weekend Will Help Purchase
New Quarters for Southeast Bottoms Project

In an effort to raise a por-
tion of the $6,000 the Des
Molnes Southeast Bottoms Pro
ject needs to purchase new
quarters, Grinnell students are
holding a campus-wide bake
sale today and tomorrow. Pro-
ceeds from the sale will go to-
ward repaying several Iowa
churches which have agreed to
loan the project the money
needed to purchase a private
home to replace their recently
condemned building.

Jim Dunn, a community or.
ganizer and lhe only lull time
staifrmember with the South
east aottoms Protect, described

the area in which the project
works as one where “Nearly
80% of the homes are listed as
either deteriorating or dilapi-
dated; the unemployment rate
is 2.7 times greater than the
city rate; the median education
is 8th grade as compared to a
city median or 12.3 grades;
nearly 80% of the homes have
outhouses and many of the peo-
ple (40 or 50 families) have to
walk In a converted horse drink~
ing trough tor water because
they lack facilities in their
homes.”

The new building will be used
[or administrative tasks and
tund-raising activities, and Will

serve as a meeting house for in-
tormal conterences and special
tutoring. Space will also be pro-
vided for the Still Osteopathic
Hospital and College which fur-
nishes low-cost minimal health
care for slum residents
Today from 5:00 p.111. to 5:30
pm. women can order baked
goods and have them delivered
to their dorms. From 6:30 pm.
to 11:30 pm. there will be more
baked goods on sale at Cowles.
Tomorrow, business will be held
near the lunch lines and from
1:00 pm to 5:00 pm in Gard-
ner Lounge, at Cowles, and at
The Lantern on Broad Street.

‘Civil Rights Movement Not Dead,’
Delta Ministry Continues Support

By Lilah Morton

Is the Civil Rights Movement
dead? Sue Geiger, representa-
tive of the Delta Ministry Civil
Right movement, who was on
campus this week, doesn’t think
so. According to Miss Geiger.
“the demonstration phase of
civil rights is dying because
Vietnam demonstrations have
taken over. But there is still
a lot of work to be done. In
the immediate future it is the
state elections and, in the long
run, it is education and econom-
ic programs." Mississippi claims
26 of [he 64 civil rights workers
left in the South. in previous
summers, college students [took-
ed to the South to work in the
movement. Last summer there
were only three students, all
or whom were seminarians,
working in Mississippi as part
of their curriculum.

Miss Geiger and her com-
panion, Jean Phillips, discussed
the project with several Grin-
nell students. The discussion
focused on the Federal Food
Stamp program, poverty. dis-
crimination, and the tutoring
program being carried out by
the Delta Ministry. The Delta
Ministry is partially supported
by the World Council of

Churches, which considers Mis-
sissippi as a prime area (or
toreign mission money. Churcha
es in Airica are supporting the
Civil Rights movement in Mls<
sissippi. The result of the dis«
cussion is that Lucy Polerd,
Grinnelt freshman, wants to
volunteer to Work in Mississippi
this summer. Miss Geiger’s re
action was “Great! We need
her and ten more like her.“
Lucy feels that “this is some-
thing ! really want to do. I
like to help people to the best
of my ability. I get a lot of
satisfaction out of it.” Lucy is
concerned with the general
poverty as well as with civil
rights. She worked tor three
weeks in Appalachia helping
clear land for a school.

Immediately after spring va-
cation there will be a fund
raising campaign to send Lucy
to Mississippi tor the summer.
A minimum of $300 will be
needed for transportation, food,
and lodging. Simultaneously, a
campaign for paper, pencils
and crayons will be staged.
These materials are needed in
the tutoring program.

Anyone interested in joining
Lucy this summer should con-
tact Lilah Morton, ext, 564.

ACM Chicago Urban Semester

By Gretchen Brewer

“Hey, teacher-l"

“Yes?"

“Can I ask you a question?"

"All right.”

“Well. . . this is kind at a
personal question. Promise you
won’t tell anyone I asked you?"

“Go ahead. i won’t tell any-
one.”

“Okay. Can i kiss you? I've
never kissed a girl before,”

Such was my unoiiicial wel-
come to the second of two
Chicago high schools where I
practicertaught last semester
while participating in Grinnell’s
ACM Urban Semester program.
Clearly, this was not the kind
of student-teacher relationship
I learned about in methods
class. Nor, for that matter, had
my iirst eight weeks or prac-
lice-teaching prepared me tor
such an encounter.

Like the other 35 participants
in the program, I spent the
[list half of the semester in
an cuterrcity, predominantly
middle class high school. This
school provided an excellent
atmosphere in which to make
my lirst “stab” at teaching,
Except for overcrowding, it had
relatively rew problems. It was
not only blessed With an el-
licient administration, but also
with a competent, dynamic
taculty.

My supervising teacher loaned
me two English literature clos—
es, for which I assumed the
full responsibility of planning,
teaching, grading, and (Ilscl-

whom I had Contact were in-
