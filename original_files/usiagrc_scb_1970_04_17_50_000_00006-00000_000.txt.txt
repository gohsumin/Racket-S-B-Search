Photography magazine
described the East Street Gallery
print washer in a recent issue
as “a beautifully finished rec-
tangular prism oi gleaming
Plexiglass. an ingenious
device.” A number of well known
and respected institutions and
photographers have bought print
washers irom the Gallery, in

Washington,D C., the MlTphoto
labs in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, the director of
photography oi the Museum oi

The Gallery oegan producing
and selling the washers only last

accelerating so rapidly that
Wilhelm and Krystyna Nouman
can hardly keep up with it. in
the last hall of last year, when
they iirsl started selling llie
washers, they grossed 55,000.

their sales For example, Alt»

needless to say, was without an
opinion

ltir. lrving It, Howell, owner
oi Bates Flowers in Grinnell, told
the Stu; tllzil he thought his
opinions and the opinions oi most
townspeople towards Wilhelm
could be summarized very easily.
“He ought to leave town," Mr.
Howell said; “He causes nothing
but problems.” Wilhelm, Mr.
Howell indicated, is a serious
problem to town businesses “we
can’t even identiiy ourselves with

tor each print to he Washed in r. the College any more because oi

Henﬁy wllhelm and his type," he
explained, Howell also pointed to
a problem which others had
mentioned: the activities oi
Wilhelm and others make the
money raising task or people in

.the College’s development otiice

much more diiiicult. “We just
can’t understand why kids act
this way. we just can’t unr
derstand it,” he concluded,

liir. Paul Brink. a local
businessman and a long time
resident of Grinnell said that he
is not iamiliar with the con-
troversy as it surrounds Wilhelm
and the college. He said that his
ideas and attitudes have changed
as he has noticed that “many at
the townspeople who are shocked
thy Wilhelm) seem to he the
same people who aren’t shocked
by our activity in Vietnam, and
who are not concerned with our
racial problems.” Mr. Brink said
that relatively low townspeople
do actually know willielin, their
knmi ledge is what they hear ot
him and what they read in his

paper. According to Mr, Brink,
the issues or t>tcrotiactyl which
he saw were ”quite boring." “We
are in a strange soctcly," he
continued. “We get uptight about
minor or superiicial things, but
we let the important issues slide
by.”

One local resident. who has
been in several businesses in
Grinnell and did not wish to be
quoted by name, expressed a
view which was iairly typical oi
those people contacted by the
5&8. He said that he thinks
Wllhelm‘s thinking must be “kind
oisic l' and that “everybody tin
townt that knows something
about him wishes that he were
in Russia." He said that he un-
derstands Wilhelm's Situation 7
that he is not a student — but
that some of his friends are not
that well informed and tend to
associate him more closely with
Grinnell College

Chief of Police Bill Peters
seems to be less upset about
Wilhelm than most townspeople.

Peters said that although he
