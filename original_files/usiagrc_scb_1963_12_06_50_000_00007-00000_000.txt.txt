Give Legal View
Of Civil Rights

By Phil Bernstein

In a coffee hour held Wednes-
day in Yollnker Lounge, Profes-
sor W, Bonfield of the Univer—
sity of Iowa Law School spoke
on the Kennedy Civil Rights
bill as Viewed by a constitution-
e1 lawyer.

Bonfield stated that the bill‘s
passage was imperative not
only from a moral standpoint
but also in the light of the
hatred bred by discrimination
and of the financial and physi-
cal inconvenience which it
causes to all of us.

The Kennedy Bill would
make illegal any racial discrim—
ination by hotels, stores, gas
stations, etc. which are in»
volved in interstate commerce,
It would also ban discrimina-
tion in movie theaters and
other places of entertainment
if either the patrons or source
of entertainment had to cross
state boundaries.

In answer to those who would
still leave anti—discrimination
legislation up to the individual
states, Bonfield replied that
discrimination is, in
effect, a national problem and,
moreover. most state statutes
outlawing it are rarely, if ever,
enforced He pointed out that.
the Kennedy Bill draws its prec-
edent from two sections of the
Constitution —- the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Commerce
Clause.

The more important of these
is the commerce clause, for it
is recognized that discrimina-
tion in the area of public ac-
commodations has a direct and
negative bearing on interstate
commerce. The boycotts of
those fighting for equality have
the same stiﬂing effects as the
strikes of those who strive for
union recognition. That the
latter is now covered by the
National Labor Relations Act
(on the support of the comv
merce clause) gives precedent
to protecting the former under

a bill such as the Kennedy_

Civil Rights Bill.

Eonfield countered the states’
rights argument so often given
by Southerners by saying that
the {act that the Tenth Amend-
ment gives the stats only those
powers not previously dele-
gated to the Federal Govern-
ment is irrelevant here be-
cause the Kennedy Bill draws
its support from delegated
powers.

“If you are expecting to
read something profound, for-

expect anything more from
me. i am a product of my age.
