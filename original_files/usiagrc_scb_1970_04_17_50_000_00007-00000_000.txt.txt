that it was not an effort for
them to talk about their griev-
:tnces before me. l am in favor
of the grievance procedure es
tablished in the College’s last
contract proposal. It is one oi
the best things that will come
out oi the strike." It has been
the policy of the College in the
past “not to prohibit the right
of any employee to consult dis
rectly on matters oi labor re
lations with any ember oi
the College adm' istration.”
Tllis statement appeared in a
memo sent from the Adminisn
tratlon to employees last Nor
Vember. The memo outlined
the altcmativcs employees had
just beiore they petitioned the
College to hold a referendum
to determine whether they
wished to he represented by
the Teamsters.

Some striking B&G workers
believed that they were and
are in danger oi being fired
because of their recent activ7
ities. The College has stated in
official memorandums to the
B8tG workers that, “Whatever
your own views about unioni—
zation are, the College assures
you that you will not be penal-
ized it you wish to join a union,
that you will not be rewarded
it you do not wish to join a

union; in short. you are free to
take any position yoti wish on
the matter."

l-las Mr, llziwii himself been
guilty or threatening workers
with loss of Job or of promotion
because oi their union activ-
ities? Mary Andes, linen super-
visor {or South Campus, said
she believed not. “In fact, Mr,
Hawn lias leaned over back-
wards." Site pointed out that
much time on the job has been
spent talking about the union
and the strike, rather than
working. it Mr. Hawn were out
in get those who were partici-
pating, shc teels he would have
told her to watch (or and re-
port people who were wasting
time. Mr. Hawn did not. do this.
She feels there may have been
some legitimate grievances. but
that these have been blown
largely out or proportion, partr
ly, she thought, because oi
agitation by students. She was
not approached to join the
union, since she is a supervisor,
but she would not have joined
it she had been approached.
“Compared to other jobs in the
community, this one pays well
both in wages and in fringe
benefits."

Some 3&0 workers, again,
seem to believe that Mr. Hawn
is or was planning to remove
or had threatened to remove
certain fringe benefits which
the workers have been receiv-

mg. The greatest of these is the
provision which allows the chilr
dren oi those who have been
employed by the College for 3
years or more to attend Grin-
iiell College tuition tree. This,
and other lringe benelits, are
set tlowii in the College’s em
ployee guidebook. It should be
noted that lltiwn himself has
not the power to change any
lienciits granted in this book
He is not ever consulted on
such questions.

Another complaint about Mr.
llawn arises from the tact that
in some job classifications,
people doing the same job are
receiving a different wage.
Some workers see this as a way
[or Mr. Hawn to reward iavor-
lies. According to Mr. l-lawn.
when the current wage sched-
ule was about to go into eitect,
he worked out the general
wage structure and then sub-
mitted these guidelines to the
working toremen for their rec-
ommendations. “I wanted the
employees to have a say in
this, I took their recommenda-
tions," Hawn pointed out that
the discrepancy between high-
est and lowest wage within a
class is not more than 15c exr
cept in the cases at mechanics.

Most, but not all, of the in»
mdrs about Mr. Hawn appear
groundless, but it is perahps
understandable why they arose.
There were no working grieve

Mi‘s, Norris Continued: “Most

this good will that Henry and
krystyna have hurt."

A Grinnell business man, Mr,
Chuck DeLong, of tile Grinnell
class of 193i, who feels that he
may represent the establishment
in Grinnell fairly well, said that
Wilhelm’s actions fascmate him.
Looking at Wilhelm from a kind
at psychoanalytical viewpoint, he
sees wilhclm, who came irorn a
broken home, as “probably
venting hostility on the world."
Wilhelm, Mr DeLong said, is
upsetting many things 7 for
example, the relationship be
tween the college and alumni who
are potential donors. “Very
possibly, his actions could be
construed as a cry for help," Mr.
DeLong said, “and I just wish
someone was smart enough to
give us an answer." Mr, DeLong
added that he takes his hat ott
to most of the young people who
are rebelling at the hypocrisy
of the establishmenl, and he
thinks that “these youngsters
have a great chance to prove that
bigotry and ignorance are
synonymous.”

said: “This is a small town, the
people have their own morality
and are salisiiied with it, and Mr.
Wilhelm would do better to
respect it and not try to change
it or influence it or impose his

Another Grinnell businessman,
a Grinnell College graduate who
feels that he has a liberal point

the feelings of graduates oi the
college, said that he ieels that
Wilhelm is probably a brilliant
young man, Judging from the (act
that he was able to put out a

reels that it does not hurt anyone
to read or listen to that kind of
thing that was in Pierodnctyl;
aclualiy, he icels that Wilhelm
