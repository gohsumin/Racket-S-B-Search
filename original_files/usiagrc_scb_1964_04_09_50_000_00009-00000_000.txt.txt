Welfare, in the cabinet of Pres—
ident John F. Kennedy.
As Secretary of HEW, Ribi-

coff was responsible for some
of the most ferreaching inno-
vations in the history of the
nation’s health, education, and
welfare.

An entirely new approach to
Welfare operations was insti-
tuted by Ribicoff, placing greatv
er emphasis on prevention and
rehabilitation.

The Social Security system
was improved by Congress’s

._ adoption of Ribicoff’s proposals

RIBICOFF

 

for lowering the retirement age
for men as well as for women
to 62, raising ren‘rement bene-
fits for widows, and increasing
minimum Social Security pay—
ments more than 20 per cent.

Ribicoff initiated the act
which now provides aid to de-
pendent children whose par~
ents are the victims of unem-
ployment.

Ribicoff was the first HEW
secretary to urge the striking
of the “separate but equal"

 

clauses from the Hill-Burton
Hospital Construction Act and
statutes governing Federal as-
sistance to land grant colleges.

In March, 1562, Ribicoff,
through administrative action,
made the historic decision that

children whose parents live or
work at Government installa-
tions would no longer be re-
quired to attend local public
schools in the Fall of 1963 if
those schools remained segre»
gated, but, instead could attend
desegregated schools on the
Federal bases,

Ribicoff resigned from the
Kennedy cabinet in 1962 to run
for the Senate. His election was
an indication of the great
amount of respect he com-
mands in Connecticut. At the
age of 53, Ribicoff’s back-
ground in politics and govern»
ment at all levels make him
the ideal Democratic Vice
Presidential candidate.

Gov. Romney Is Candidate lo Cope
With Problems. Dangers of 60's

By Ken Adleman

The Republican Party must
choose as its Presidential can-
didate ior 1964 a man who has
proved that he has the ability
to cope with the problems of
the 1960's, and a man Who
recognizes the dangers which
are inherent in big government,
big business, and big unions.
Such a man is George Romney,
the Governor of Michigan.

In 1962 Romney ended a 14
year Democratic dynasty on
the Michigan state-house by de-
feating the Democratic incum-
bent by over 78,000 votes. After
only one year in office Romney
had wiped out the state’s mas-
sive 85.6 million deficit.

Earlier he had shown the
same caliber of ability in in-
dustry. When he was selected
as President of American
Motors Corporation, that firm
was on the verge of collapse.
When he left American Motors
to run for Governor in 1962
that firm had become estab-
lished as one of the most vital
and stable in the automotive
industry.

It was Romney who intro-
duced both the concept and
term of “compact” cars to the
American automotive industry.

Romney firmly believes that
there should he more citizen
participation in government. As
Governor .he has set aside
Thursday mornings to allow
any citizen to come in and dis-
cuss problems. Romney has
said that America desperately
needs a party that is responsive
to the people.

On Civil Rights Romney has
stated time and again his up-
position to “discrimination of
any kind." He has ,criticized
President Johnson’s tax pro-

IOMNEY

gram as a trick saying the de-
ficit will continue at the same '
level.

Romney says that American
foreign policy must adopt a
new outlook. He says that the
policy of the present adminis-
tration has led to the position
where freedom is in retreat all
over the world.

The Republicans can do no
less than nominate the person
who Margaret Chase Smith has
described as the man who is
“probably the most ideal candi—
date in the party." That man
is Governor George Romney
of Michigan.

Thomas in St. Paul. .

The Senator began his politi-
cal career in Minnesota work-
ing actively in the organization

of the Democratic-Farmer-
Labor Party. In 1948 he was

every two years,

when he was elected to a six-

year term in the United States

Senate,

In the Senate, McCarthy has
been noted for his quiet leader-
ship. He is recognized by his

fellow Senators as a man of in-

tellectual excellence, integrity,
and dedication. M c C a r t h y

Finance, and Agriculture and

Forestry. In 195!) and 1560 the

Senator was chairman of the
Special Senate Committee on
Unemployment Problems. This
committee was directed to
make a thorough study of un—
employment problems in the

United States, and reported its

findings to the second session

United States

committees—

of the Eightyvsixth Congress.

McCarthy was active in his
support of the tax-reduction
bill, and is currently working
for improvements in the farm
'program, an area which he
sees as one of the most serious
challenges to our economy.

In the area of party policies,
McCarthy has also distinguished
himself. Perhaps he is best re-
membered for his brilliant
speech nominating Adlai Stev-
enson at the 1960 Democratic
National C o n v e nt i o n. This
speech was widely acknowl-
edged as the high»point of tho
Conventiori. In addition, Senaa
tor McCarthy is widely known
as a speaker on economic, so-
cial, and political problems. He
has contributed to many iour-
nals and has participated in
forums and conferences in thin
country and abroad,

On October 18-19, 1962, Grins
nell College was honored to
have McCarthy as a Politician-
In-Residence under the spon-
sorship of the Program in

Carthy not only appeared in in-
formal and formal sessions, but
