i AUTHOR VIEWS CHANGES

By TOM THOMAS

How does the new System under the proposed
SCA Constitution really work?

First, the focal point of SGA will be the face-

lifted Senate (Commute

e of Thirteen). Almost all

iunctions or student government will revolve around

this central group. This

body's activities can easily

be seen as a combination or the duties of both the
present Executive Cabinet and the present Senate.

Members or the Con“ will be required to attend
all house meetings on campus. No one member will
be responsible tor a particular hall, but rather all

members will circulate

among all halls, gathering

ideas and giving iniormation about student govern-

ment,

Minortiy opinions ignored by one Senator may
be picked up by another. and the diverse views at
Student government may give a more realistic total

picture.

’Illls new group should be able to maintain that
Small-size working efficiency (like the Executive
Cabinet), while continuing actual representation of

campus opinion.

The basic responsibi

lity of the student ombuds-

man — another major topic of concern among Stu-
dents — would be to secure adequate representa-
tion ior students with both student government and
faculty-administrative bodies (such as the Commit—
tee on Academic Standing). The ombudsman would
maintain office hours, and would work with two as»

sistants.

The ombudsman, serving as a complement to

the position of SGA President, could well .be one of
the most important positions on campus, and cen-
talnly is a key to the success of the proposed Struc-

ture,

One tinal major point _ the role or the House

President. The House Presidents will be expected to

work more closely with the new student adviser
program (Still being ﬁnalized) and the resident ad»

visors.

These changes are only a part of the entire Sys»
tern. A realistic appraisal oi the constitution can be
attained only by viewing the entire proposal as an

interrelated structure,

This constitution is no perfect system. but It is
certainly a major step in the development of a real-

istic and eilective stude
College.
