Mug recooniit World domination
is Communist goal: Byung-Uk Ahn

by Barbara. Hunt
v Dr. Byung»Uk Ahn, Korean
Whitney-Fulbright Visiting pro
fessor of philosophy at Cornell
College, spoke Tuesday in Youn-
‘kcr lounge on “Crisis or Free
dom" 7 the threat ot commu-
nism in the world and ways
which its spreading may be pr
vented.by the free world nations
working together.

He expressed concern that
since 1848 .thecommunists have
gr wn from a iew revolution—
aries into the massive “spectre
‘of coiiiniunism"—whicli oversha—
dows onecfourth of the world’s
teillory and one-third of its
population, He said that it was
the common task of the people
oi the free world to share an
understanding and fellowship
with one another. i

America, he said, has lie— 1
. come the leader of the free
world and has the duty to help
eliminate the communist.
threat, He said‘ that we must l
recognize our responsibility, as i
we are the only power capable t
or defeating communism. We 1
need power, but we also need t
the solid spiritual heliei em~ l
bodied in the etiorts or our

.Iounding iathers to back up l

our powert . i

He said also that today’s po-l
litical situation is the result or1
,our failure to understand the}
nature of communism, citing as
an example Roosevelt’s inter-pro:
tation or Russian friendliness to
mean a change in intentions. H‘e
.rccls that people and leaderst
must understand the communisti|
way or thinking, realizing that

communism is a philosophy or
change, a “dictator of history,’
a philosophy of nhsolutism with
on unchangeable basic plan to
communize the entire world, ale
though its strategies may change.

Ahn feels that the free \Vol‘ldi

must remain superior to the

communists. He suggested means‘

or stopping the gradual llli‘ilc
tration of communism into pon
arty-stricken, backward courr
trie Besides military power and
spirit, we must use our economic
system to full advantage and do
what we can to I'kl these couli»
tries of the threat 0! hungcl:
Today. concluded Ahn, freer
doni iaces crisis. H the tree
world can unite and act, “free
,dom and free socicties will not
perish from the earth." gr
