With Iowa drying out from the zlmiuzil spring floods,
Midwest Conference busebilll M‘ﬂl‘ns llzll'e for the most plirt
lSWllll‘gj into action. The Conference, which is divided into
I \\'o five—team divisions for baseball, should be well balanced
l\\'ll.ll the defending cllzlmpion, Cce, getting stern competi-
itioii from Grinncll and Monmouth ill the southern division.

In the llorthcln tllvi ion St. Olaf zmd Ripon le'e cor
lfui rites to win the d son title. The \iiniicrs in each
idirlsion will meet in a Lil'o-otlt-olltlil'cc playoff for the
league title May 18-19 on the dizlmond of the nothcrn di-
vision champ.

 

l The northern division includes Minnesota zllid Wisccn-
'n members of the Conference, while the southern diViSion
iis comprised of the Iowa and Illinois Conference members.

g In the southern division, which is of iinlncdlnle inter-
;est to Grinnell, Coe has only four lcttci’lneli returning from
llzlsi. year‘s championship squad. Coach Bill Fitch‘s only res
iturning pitcher is Mike Gibney. His other Veterans are
‘ a Tliiele, first; Ron Kozenicz‘dli, second; and Frazer
iWi’ig‘ht, outfield.

. Cornell has a severe talent problem which has caused its
lcoach, Paul Maashe, to quip, ”We're hoping for ram on
lthe eight days we have games scheduled."

‘ Knox, on the other hand, could surprise the Midwest
Conference this year. The Siwash squad, which finished in
in second-place tie ill the southern division last season,
boasts seven returning letter-men along with soph Souths
paw, Bob Peters; Peters should give added depth to the
[Silvaslh who already have Tom Bicc uncl Al Knight on the
lfii'ing' line. Also, catcher Bob Kucik will be in his third

'season as a regular.

Monmouth, which lost; its opening game to Coe, ltlso
is rated as a top challenger. Led by junior pitcher Gene
Dawson, who tossed two shut-cuts last season, the Scots
iwill go with seven other lettermen.

i
And for Gi'inncll everything is ”go." Couch Edd Bow-
ers inherits a squad from John Pfitscli (on leave in Pali-
amzl) that includes lust year’s number one pitcher, Dick
Mitllebusher; outfielder, Bob McIntyre, who hit .407 and
second sucker, Dale Furnish, who hit at a .374 clip.

' Versatile Cris Sprung is another that Bowers will
COlllli. heavily on. In the past, Sprung has caught, plziycd
the infield and pitched in relief, running up 2i 2-0 mark
last year Other returnees include captain and catcher,
‘Rogcr iller; shortstop, Al-t Peterson and outfielder
Bruce Bell.

Two sophomores should also play a big role in Grin-
'nell’s title hopes. One, Cal Collier, is a hllrler and fl st
baseman, while the other is Jim Jenks, zl third sucker.

Because of Grinnell’s balance and pitching, I’ll pick them
as the team to bent in the southern division rating Coe
second, Monmouth third, Knox fourth and Come“ last.
