By Patricia Lester

The Grinnell tennis team upped
IIS overall record to 333 and its
conierence record to 2-2 ,by
winning three meets in-a rowan
by decisive margins

On April 18, the netmen
squashed South Dakota State by
an impressive 8-1 margin as they
swept all the singles and dropped
only one doubles match, Grinnell
ran up their tallies with com-
parative ease as number one Ken
Schofield pulled out a 977, 670
decision, alld the rest of the team
rolled on to victory as follows:
Jim Spell: (3-3, (H; Ed DeBu Gr
4, 64, Bruce Bonnewell: 6- 6~
Dave Beernan: 672, 6 ; and
Carlos Mendoza: 5-2, 570. Grinnell
took two oi the three doubles
matches as DeBuS-Bonnewell
triumphed by a 672,6-2 score and
Spelerob Quint by a oi, 672
record

The only losing team that day
was Beeman-Mendoza who gave
up a hardriought match that went
to three sets with SDS Coming out

Continuing a rather bland
season, the Pioneer baseball
team dropped two and picked up
one over the weekend,

The Pioneers edged out Knox or
7 on Friday, pulling out a poor
periormanee with a three run
spurt at the bottom of the ninth.
Bill Dicks started the rally with a
homer, and was followed across
the plate by Ed Hirsch and Scott
Hanson, who came in on the
strength oi a single swatted by
Roger Rowe.

The real action, however,
occurred on Saturday, when

hall of the trlrmeet was cancelled
because oi bad weather and
Grinitell lost its opportunity to
make it a double sweep by taking

lowa

The Pioneers rolled on to
whitewash Coe on April 22 by M
in a Midwest Conference dual
that saw the lemlers take all the
matches in a strong show or
superior ball control. The singles
winners and their scores were:
Scboiield: at, 6-2: Spell: i374, 5-3;
DeBus: oi. rro, Bonnewel]: 75,
6 Mendoza: 6»0, B~O; Eeeman:

completed the rout of Coe by
winning all their matches in
straight sets BeemanrMendoza
triumphed ore, 6-4; DeBus-
Bonnewell tallied 6-4. oz; and
Peter DoerlngrBob Pegram won

Grinnell iollowed the Coe
triumph with a duel against
Cornell that saw the netmen drop
two singles contests and one

Grinnell probably the worst
larding in recent memory. The
Pioneers fell by scores of 1979 and
2570,

Concerning Authority 8t Recreation

By John Nigel Pepper

It has not been my custom in
this space even to deign so much
as a reply to the sucuillous and
reprehensible (albeit rather
,pathetic) character assas-
sinations aimed at me by my
rabid enemies, It is one thing, of
course. to attack a truth-Seeker
out or malice and ignorance But
it is quite another thing to drag
St. Thomas Aquinas, much less
the Greeks into the matter. I had
received assurances irom Lloyd
and Harry that the 5&3 would be
above that sort ot Thing.

I would like to make a few
remarks about this, starting
Much Less with the Greeks, and
then to go on to the Angelic
Proctoscopist. If there is time

and space leit over, perhaps 1 can
make some ilimsy pretense of
relevance to the need and wants
of the Grinllell Community.
Much less the Greeks, for a
start, is not a seamless whole.
There are, in fact many different
sorts of Greeks, “Some Greeks
are tall and some are small,"
“Some Greeks make us Glad and
others make us Sad." But be that
as it may, the Greeks in question,
Much Less Aristotle and Plate
were not all the Greeks. They
werehothing more than Some oi
the Athenians. Some other sorts
ufGreeks were the Spartans, who
were Kings Jock, Bar None of the
Whole Show. They used to love
nothing so much as to spend their
days running about Flailing

each other with Knouts and so on.
This was a strenuous pastime,
so at the end of their day, the
Spartans would retire to their
mess for a mess of Black Soup
before retiring to their stone beds
with blankets made of used hair
shirts It was once remarked by
an Athenian tourist that the
iierceness oi the Spartan
warriors could be accounted ior
by the Black Soup alone, and
Don't Bother about the Knouts
etc. Who could possibly be afraid
of death. after all after facing
Black Soup7

refrain from Comment here,
Suffice it to say that if the logic 0]

‘THE LABOWITZ REPORT:

illgs, and the smoke still hasn‘t cleared from the game. From where
I saw it in left field (and the bench after committing two errors)
it looked like Read was out—psyched by the redoubtable Dave Brown
and the Homes crew, with the Machine striking out and making

errors.

Haines got 12 runs, and Read
struggled for a or 4, which
should give Haines a win. How
ever, it seems that Al Ham-
mond was illegal (which isn't
a very nice thing to say about
him), so Read has filed a pro-
test. At last report, both sides
had presented non-negotiable
demands, and Haines has lined
up Dave Horwatt to talk to
Read for them. No details of
a settlement will be released
for some time, so until further
notice, Clark is in first place.
Both Read and Haines followed
that game with losses, Read
dropping a hard-fought contest
to the Profs 87, and Haines be-
ing dumped by East 18-13. Read
didn’t ,have Amazing Mason
Klippel (The Riﬂe Arm) in

right field, and the Faculty was
real strong behind their young
phenom George Apostle and
veteran Greg Guroff. Ed Le-
vine knocked in 4 runs in East‘s
first Victory, and Brad Hanson
homered in both the Read and
East games for Haines. The
Read-Faculty game also fea-
tured a meaningful dialogue
about some strange baserun-
ning by Mahler and Farsinnen,
who demonstrated that two
bodies cannot occupy the same
space. A faculty meeting was
held on the mound as to
whether or not Andy Loewi
should be given an intentional
walk. A senate committee and
Tom Greenfield are looking
into the matter.
