‘ Flie 8&1} Sports staff suppo ts the proposed change in‘
the rule regarding athletic eligibility zit Grinnell College.

1 The 1962763 edition of the student handbook states that
anyone is eligible for inter collegiate athletics if his grade
‘point average for the preceding semester is 2.00 or above,
.or if his cummulatlive grade point average is at. or nbove
‘ﬂ specified minimum (1.70 at end of first semester; 1.80,
second semester; 1.9, third semester; 1.95 fourth semester;
2.00 from then till graduation.)

 

This requisite is just. slightly ilbove the minimum per-
mance that will keep a student off academic probation.
,If n student is on academic probation and ‘l‘uils to raise his
‘mi its by the following semester, he is dismissed from
‘sclool,

for

, The Midwest Conference committee of facility repree
jsentatives and athletic directors voted last November to
lchang’e the conference rulelregarding eligibility. The old
rule, in effect since 1955756, stated that in order to be
.elig‘iblc an athlete must currently be passing in twelve
,llollrs of academic work, and that eight of these 12 credit
illours must carry an average grade of C or better. This
comes out to a 1.67 minimum grade point. The revamped
rule, less specific but on the whole equally demanding.
states simply that anyone who is in school is eligible.

Since there are few students at Grinnell with 2i cunni-
.lative average of less than 1.67, the new conference rule,
is applied to Grinncll College, is. more strict than the old
one.

Next Monday the faculty of Grinnell College will con-
sider the proposed change of the current rule to conform
with the new conference regulation and with our nine sis-
ter schools. One possible objection to this change, an impli-
ed lower g of academic standards. is met, as noted above,
by comprulng the current eligibility rule with the rule for
remaining ill school.

Studies by Mickey Holmes, Gl'innell sports publi y
director, show that there is no appreciable difference be-
tween an athlete's in-season grades. and the same athlete’s.
grades when he is not out for it sport. Holmes’ statistical
data effectively met the argument that a marginal strident
,nlny be pushed over the point of no return by participation
in sports.

Recently the “faculty approved another new rule stat-
ing that any athlete eligible at the beginning of a sports
season would be allowed to finish that season. This affects
the winter teams, whose schedules span portions of both
semesters,

In keeping- with this decision, with the conference rul-
ing, and with the other nine conference schools, ollr faculty
,should vote "yes” on the proposed change.
