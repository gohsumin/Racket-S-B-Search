Truth and order, logic, reason,
Usher in our Yuletide season;

So for Richard J. Cole, that merry old sou!
We‘ll empty down a wessail bowl.

And for Crunch and Crawstlck, those melt of

the hour,
We’ll drain a draft of Schopenhauer
(An old, melliiluous German brew
Endorsed by Neufang, Roecker too.)

For Jacquelyn Guillaume, a quart 0! Old ‘
Crow,

And a pony for Carmel Archambault;

A fine and mellow Christmas day

To Kobrin, Obstfeld, Schiff and Lay.

For Suzie Coop and Nancy Cable

Juicy things upon the table.

A rolicking Christmas to Judy K.
Who‘s white and sexy and sings all day.

To Peter Staben, that mountain of brawn
Mary K. Gwynne, and Garda Vaughan,
Linda Landau and Karin P. Lane
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine
Henry the Fifth, Zitner, King Lear,

We wish a full barrel of Yuletide cheer.

To Thomas the Phillips and Mary Jo
ex«Dole1nb0

To Nancy and Sam and Maxin's existential
dilemma

And Grinnell’s first Smirnoff motorcycle set

Invites to parties both jolly and wet.

A toast to those who left the fold—

To Bisson, Lightbourne, Tushnet. and Gold: L
To Balick, Allen, Cleaver and Diehl

Our Good Housekeeping Christmas Seal

To Fetter, Ann and Homer, Holly
A Christmas gay and New Year’s jolly.
For Ashley, debunker of the east,
A Midwest~family—style Christmas feast.

Eight dashing reindeer and a shiny, new
sleigh

For the new Father Christmas, Vladalnlr
Dupre.

For the Kittatinny Mountain Boys

Piles of musical tops and toys;

For Jackie Abbot and Scholten, Dirk,
No more teachers, no more work;
No more sleet and no more snoo

For Foxie, Hicksy, Kletke too.

Break down the windows, kick in the door
For the lady who hid ’neath the head of the
boar.

Funning for Dunning, and lots of high livin'

For Fiene and Nolan and Partidge and Zivin;

Haul off your overcoats, lets have a ball

With Tegger and Rungo and Dawson and
Wall,

And Larson and Ramzy and Annie Miller,

And naturally, Bowers, Pfitsch, and the
Killer.

For J eftrey Kohlman and his thirst
unquenchable .

Something to drink, and something
unmentionable. ,

A colorful Christmas and a one horse sleigh,

to John Black and Carl Otis Gray.

Cheers to Mr. Bridgham, phone in hand,
Who makes it hot for Felton’s hand.

To the D-Groups, good wishes hearty
For their Christmas hang-ups party.

To those of you whose names aren’t here
Look to another Noel next year;

And finally, not with tongue in cheek,

We wish you a wonderful Christmas week.

Expansion of PPPE Inte

ship

Enabled I) y Falk Gift of $4500 ,

Grinnell College has been
given a $4,500 grant by the
Maurice and Laura Falk Foun-
dation for an expansion of the
college's Program in Practical
Political Education political in—
ternship program.

The grant, announced by Dr.
J, Steele Gow, executive di-
rector of the foundation, locat-
ed in Pittsburgh, P8,, will be
used to inaugurate a series of
student internships in political
reporting.

These internships will be in
addition to the existing sum-
mer and fall programs that
place Students with candidates
or political party headquarters.

Under the expanded pro-
gram, during each semester,
four Grimell students will
spend eight hours a week for
10 weeks working with the As-
sociated Press and the United
Press International in Des
Moines.

“Since this is the first time,
to our knowledge, that such
student press internships have
been attempted in the us,"
Dr. Gow says, “the Falk
Foundation is happy to spon-
sor this novel and promising
program for a three-year pe-
riod.”

With the new program to be-
gin early next February, Dr.
C, Edwin Gilmour, director of
the P.P.P.E. said that the se-
lected students will have the
“unique opportunity to obtain
insights, experiences, and in-
spiralion into and from the pp.
litical process, as seen by the
political reporter,"

Specific plans will have the

 

student interns assigned to as-
sist in the political coverage
of the State House, the State
Legislature, and the stale head-
quarters of the two major po-
litical parties.

The Student will work with
and under the supervision of
political reporters, following an
orientation period. In addition
to writing straight news
stories, they will also do re-
search and Write feature stories
concerning political f i g u r e s
and events. A

Each student will spend a to-
tal of eight hours a week in the
internship, and will be paid at
the rate of $1.25 an hour, or
$10.00 a week. Transportation
between Grinnell and D e s
Moines will be furnished by
the PPPE. The intern will not
be paid for the approximately

 

four hours weekly spent in
travel.

To tie the internship experi-
ence directly into the academic
program of the College, each
intern will be required to em
roll for an Independent Prol-
eCt 397493. Under the direction
of Herbert Prescott (English-
Journalism) or C. Edwin Gil-
mour (Political Science), thq
intern will complete a mean-
ingful reading or research as-
signment relating to the interm
ship experience.

Participation in the program
is open to all Grinnell students,
regardless of class standing or
academic major. Interested
students are asked to contact
Prescott or Gilmour imme-
diately, since selection of the
February interns must be
made prior to registration for
the second semester.
