By Richard Schneirov

Wednesday night the Senate gave its
approval to changes in the Aws Con<
stltution and heard the final reports
or the Executive Cabinet and the
chairman of the Finance Committee,
The meeting marked the end or the
elected terms of all senators and the
members or the executive cabinets

in the only major legislation of the
evening the Senate approved the tol-
iowing three changes in the AWS Con~
stitution: (l) Withdrawal of the AWS
from the Intercollegiate Association of
Women’s Students; (2) elimination ot
the social budget committee and clar-
itication of the role of Quad Social
Chairman; (3) incorporation of the
offices of Decorations Chairman, Music
Chairman, and Kitchenette Chairman in-
to a new hall social council.

Speaker at the Senate, Bond Faul-
well, in his iinal report, both praised
the Senate and criticized it. He lauded
the work oi the committees in general,
but criticized senators for their “lack
0i initiative.”

Faulwell also gave his Views on the
role ot the Senate:

“1 do not think that the Senate as
un official body has any responsibility
or right to act on such national and
international issues as the Vietnam
draft. I think it is up to each student
as an individual to express his own
opinion rather than [or the Senate to
attempt to express a collective opinion
tor him, in the iirst place, there are
more than enough problems on this
campus to keep the Senate occupiedr
Secondly, senators are elected on the
basis of campus and not national or

New dorm focus for
question of residence

By Susan Fogg

Building proposals tor a new women's
dormitory are becoming the focal point
tor student leaders’ growing desire to
reevaluate the concept of Grinnell as a
residential College. The View as ex-
pressed by Lynda Thoman (AWS board
member elect) is not an objection to the
new dormitory, but rather the protest,
why a women’s dorm?

Karen Lauterbach (AWS Board Presi-
dent) leels that betore the proposal {or
the dorm is finalized, alternative forms
or housing should be considered, espe-
cially in light oi the recent innovation or
apartments tor women. This might in-
clude buying old houses in town tor off»
campus dwellings, as Melinda Ward
suggested. or building cooperative liv-
ing units for students. This latter plan
presents difficulties of finance and could
create unwelcome pressure on students
who do not enjoy community dwelling
