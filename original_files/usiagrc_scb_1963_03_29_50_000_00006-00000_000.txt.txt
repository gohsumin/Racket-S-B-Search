SCARLET ‘AND BLACK

Justification for FM Given

By Bruce Porter
KGEW station Manager

Ed, note: Bruce Porter with this article he-
' a four-article sequence on the status at
the Silent KGRW.

Until last spring Grinnell had a campus radio
station. As one closely connected with the old
1(th 1 think 1 am qualiﬁed to say it stank.

In the beginning when the station was gross-
ly violating Federal Communications Commission
regulations — and hence could actually be heard
— it was a viable institution. And last year a
successful attempt was made to again produce
quality programming. However, it was too_ late.
With no legal cure possible for the transmission
system’s impotence (as Well as being burdened
with a recent history of mediocrity) the' wired-
wireless operation was judged hopeless. It was
buried.

Before the station was put to rest, however.
the Committee on Student Publications unani—
mously approved and forwarded to President
Bowen two reports recommending a complete
reconstitution of KGRW and changeover to FM
operation.- The first report was aimed at. outlining
the potentialities of FM radio at Grinnellr The
second dealt with equipment requirements, pros
gramming, staff organization and administration.

Shortly alter this second report was submitt—
ed to President Bowen. the student Senate unan-
imously passed a resolution urging the college
administration to “accept the proposals contained
in the FM report." In addition over eight hundred
signatures on petitions favoring FM were pre—
sented at the spring meeting of the Board of
’l‘rutsees.

What then is the present status of the FM
proposal? It is to be studied by a faculty com-
mlttee now in the process of being formed by

President Bowel-l. This committee is to study the
“costs, controls, content and responsibilities in-
volved” if an FM station is created.
The\facu1ty has decided to recommend this
committee's formation, postponing its decision on
FM until the committee reports. This is a modifir
lcation of its stand last spring endorsing the Pub-
lication Committee's report favoring FM. To un-
derstand the faculty’s present hesitancy on FM

and the contmuing reluctance of the administra-
tion, the key objections to the proposal should be
examined. The remainder of this week’s article
will develop the framework for an assessment
of the value of FM radio to Grinnell. followed in
iuture weeks by a detailed analysis of various
aspects.

First must come a justification of the five to
seven thousand dollar initial expenditure and
the approximately two thousand dollar ‘annual
expense. This must be based on an assessment of
the relative efficacy of a radio operation in terms
fo Grinnell’s goals H stated and implicit. Such
an assessment could best be made in terms of
educational value furnished, although a case
could be partially based on the entertainment
runction.

it is certainly true that the college spends a
significant amount on projects and functions of
a purely entertainment orientation. The other
criticism of the proposed FM station is that it not
educational, Neglecting the obvious fact that not
everything in the college budget is educational
one wonders what is not educational about good
music; recorded lectures and discussions. furnish»
cd for example by the Center for the study of
Democratic Institutions: The British Broadcast-
ing Corporation’s recordings of the Shakespeare
festivals; and much more. A more detailed study
of the depth and scope of program sources will
come next week.

secondly, even if it is admitted that FM would.
through good programming, serve to help enrich
the cultural and intellectual environment, one
serious criticism remains: are Grinnell students
capable of operating a station which can be heard
outside the confines of the Campus? This is a
harder objection to deal with, Perhaps the best
way is to cite the experience of other schools
similar to Grinnell. as well as the on-the-air re—
sponsibility of the KGRW staff last year. Again
this is a matter to be discussed more fully in
the next weeks.

FM has proved its values at such schools as
Carleton, Amherst. Williams and —~. excuse me e
Harvard. That it can be just as valuable at
Grinnell is the proposition 1 shall try to prove
in the next three articles on FM radio.

Sample Schedule
Shows FM Uses

Above is a\sample program
submitted to the Scarlet and
Black by Bruce Porter, station
manager of the voiceless KGRW,
for the station of the future.

According to Porter, this sam-
ple schedule illustrates the im-
mediate advantages a college
radio has over other mediums.
He noted that live and record-
ed music, lectures, faculty and
student group discussions are
among the possible uses a KG-
RW-FM could have.
