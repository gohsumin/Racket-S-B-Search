Furthermore, in spite of the

tyl is testimony to the fact that
an independent publication can
survive at the college.
Arrests, seizures, yes 7 maybe
not survival in the limited sense

look at all of these as failures
by any means. 0n the contrary,
with me help of the Iowa Civil

committee, in spite of all its
fancy rhetoric, cowardly avoids!
By the way, before the last
Pterodnctyl seizure, the paper
was selfesufflcient, Selling on this
campus and maintaining a
followmg on other Iowa cam-
puses. And Ptero will appear
again. Ptcrudactyl may not come
out every week like the 5&3, but
who said one two papers try to
serve the same function. Ptero
is a different type of journal, but
its successes do point to the fact

chance; they should at least be
tried.

Finally, Peter Bowman, as to

without faculty supervision 7
college credit for such work
should be given without question!

TO THE EDITORS:

President Leggett, in his letter
to the student body last
December, stressed the need for
placing some kind of control on
student dissent at Grinnell. With
statements like these, one can’t
help feeling that Mr. Leggett will
earn the reputation of being
Grinnell’s answer to Spiro
Agnew. But does he deserve this
honor?

On a national level, the most
powerful dissent comes from the
mass media. We do not question
that there should be some con»

trots on the media, we question
rather — in the blinding light of
past Nixon Administration
idiocies 7 the ability of Agnew
to bc just mat control. But at
Grinnell, the nature of the
College environment leaves
entirely different possibilities for
the employment of dissent
control.

The majority of Grinnell
students‘ would agree that,
although some kinds of dissent
are beneficial — perhaps even
essential 7 some dissent's only
effect will be to harm the College
reputation and to help raise
tuition costs. The problem then
lies in finding a criterion or
council to decide which dessent
has purpose. In the past months
I have been annoyed by much
of the Grinnell protesting: it has
not been 7 unfortunately7 Come
munist inspired, but
spawned by these students’ own
desperate attempts at Liberal
Exhibition. However, as many
persons who read this letter will
disagree with me. I am probably
not the best judge of dissent
criteria. I propose rather that the
student body vote on certain
restrictive guidelines for type
(e.g. no profanity, no religious
or cultural defamation) and
place (e. g,, not during alumni
reunions ur Homecoming) of
public dissent at Grinnell.

1r dissenters were to lollow a
wise set of regulations, far lewer
parents and alumni would be
offended and we would look
forward to smaller tuition rates
and a more varied student body
inthe coming years.

Senate Meeting Held:

Reporter Pays a Vlsit
By Tom Greenfield

The sudden, but not altogether
unexpected, departures of
“penguin" Bill Stranger and
“pidgeon” Steve Schwartz left
SGA the unenviable task of find-
ing suitable replacements. in a
press statement, Student Co-
ordinator Frank Thomas an-
nounced, “Schwartz is irreplace
able. No plans are being made
to find another assistant student
coordinator,” Frank refused to
comment on rumors that plans
are being made to retire Sch»
wartz's blue denim workshirt in
the SGA office.

The senate rejected the elec-
tion board’s proposal to skim two
people off the top of the unre—
solved SilvermansCohen-Ward
contest in a runoff election
(thereby filling both Stranger’s
and Aldrich’s seats 7 so to
speak.) Andy Loewi claimed that
the procedure was “irregular.”
After tepid debate, a voice of
reason noted that the December
election could not legitimately
carry over for a new semester,
because freshmen are now
eligible to run for the senate. The
folk finally decided to fill Lynn
Aldrich's chair with the Winner
of yesterday’s election and Bill
Strangers chair with the winner
of next Friday’s election.

Frank Thomas opened dis-
cussion on “The Milk Thingy”
which referred to Saga’s blatant
attempt to subvert the students’
dietary freedom by putting low-
fat milk in the dining hall cows.
Frank insisted that there is a
student mandate for whole milk
on the Grinnell campus and
promised that his office would not
rest until every cow is pouring
out whole milk. Frank bowed
humbly to thunderous applause.

tributing to the “lack of clean
bodies on campus." Tom,
sporting a bacteria-ridden T-
shirt, decried the injustice being
done to oppressed IM basketball
players who are not given towels
after each game. (Tom, who is
well over six feet tall, easily
overcame the identity gap which
usually exists between an op-
pressed group and the well—
meaning, middleclass students
who try to help its cause. Tom's
successful assimilation to “the
people” accounted for his
remarkable persuasiveness on
the Senate ﬂoor. The ovation
following his Speech was a
moving affirmation of student
commitment to social injustice.)

Joe Stein (of “Where's Jon
Stein” fame) announced plans to
open the Cafe del Foro (for you
freshman, that’s the little room
in the forum where Mssr. Parssi-
ncn, Foster, Morgen et a1. go to
have coffee when there is no
room in the grill, or when they’re
tired of being around students).
Jon ior'esees a gala opening eiv
ther this week-end or next, with
contented students munching
peanuts, sipping cider, and
grooving to the outasite sounds
of campus folk artists. After
some dealings with Hassles, Inc.
(Saga and the Forum Brass), Jon
hopes to extend the menu to in-
clude “oh 7 all kindsa things,”
as Arlo Guthrie would say.

Jon closed out his report with
an impassioned plea to the
campus kleptos who have stolen
parts of the espresso machine.
“Please return the parts so we
don’t have to send the machine
back to Italy to be repaired."

There was more, but this
reporter left to go watch “Tillie
and Gus” (W. C. Fields) on the
tube.
