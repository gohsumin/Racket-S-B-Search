on the curves to act as a

third wheel.”

During the war Hanson also
became intrigued with physics.
He read a lot and found it ex-
citing. After the war he went on
to Columbia and Tinaily ended
up at Oxford and Cambridge.
He taught at Indiana Univer-
sity, where he founded their de-
partment of the History and
Logic of Science, before going
to his present post at Yale Uni-
,versity.

“My concern has been with
the logical foundations of quan-
tum mechanics. I also have
been following theoretical mi-
crophysics with a good deal of
interest,” he explained.

Right now Hanson is finish
ing his book, Explanation in the
History of Planetary Theory,
and is working on threeother
books, A History of Aerody-
namic Theory; Notes Towards
5 Logic of Discovery, which is
a follow-up on his book, Pat-
terns oi Discovery, and con-
Cairns his interest in the philo-
sophical foundations of science;
and Thirteen Dialogues on Ne-
cessity, which is a book on
straight logic and analysis
written by the revision of some
of his published articles. Ham
son also does lecturing both at
Yale and at other colleges.

Hanson noted, “Lectures
help me to get my ideas
straight. There is a challenge
in preparing and delivering

ideas on a topic. It is rather
similar to the child who said,

‘Mommy, how can I know

what I think until i've said
it.‘ ”

The student might also be

. required to report on his pro»

ject to his advisor upon its com-

pletion. Preferably this report

should be oral. This presup-

poses a liberally educated
faculty.

The JLA is a good idea, but
an attempt should be made
to make the preparation and
the test more meaningful for
the student instead of just an
academic exercise. In this re-
spect, perhaps more emphas-
is on contemporary concepts
and ideas in the various
areas of learning would stim-
ulate interest.

Comps. should be over ideas,
concepts and tools used in pre-
ylous courses in a major field
and not be a new course be-
tween semesters. They should
indicate the student’s under-
standing of his field.

up man — he made up the is-
sue in which T. S. Eliot's
"The Waste Land“ was first
published —— and once Subbed
for the stenographic help
when they were away. It was
this way that Burke got into
musical criticism.

He became music critic of
Dial “by accident.” The regu-
lar critic left and Burke took
his place for a month until a
new Critic could be found. The
selection of a replacement was
continuously delayed and,
“first thing I knew i was music
critic by default.”

Burke’s work on magazrnes
was always a side Issue to his
main interest, writing. Working
out his “theory of language in
general and a theory of poetics
in particular,” Burke has de-
veloped a grammar, rhetoric,
poetics, and ethic.

In his studies he has dis-
covered a concept of “joycing

a word.” Joycing, which is
similar to punning, involves
seeing the relation between
words with the same or simi-
lar consonant configurations
as in “God, guard, guide."
Burke sees this as an aid to
finding the meaning of a
word, for if the author has
joyced certain key words, he
may mean to equate them.
“We can’t use this as evi-
dence; it is a Pandora's box in
that respect, but it can give us
hints about meaning," he cau-
tioned.

Burke was an Esperantist
and can still speak this synthet»
in language.

A year at the Center for the
Advanced Study in the Behav-
ioral Sciences where fifty schol-
ars are gathered to exchange
views and “to knock the edges
off one another" gave Burke a
chance to observe the effect of
terminology upon outlook.

“I spent my time there lis-
tening in on one seminar
after another. It was like
going from language to lan-
guage; it was ideal. In addi-
