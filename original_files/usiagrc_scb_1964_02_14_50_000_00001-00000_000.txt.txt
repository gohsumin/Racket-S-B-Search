Cupid turns the tables this
Valentine‘s Day as the wom-
en of South Campus launch
forth on their annual data-
setting week-end. The girls
have a variety of events to
choose from, with two home
basketball games, a guest
concert in D a r b y, open
rooms, special Dithyramb,
and a campus movie.

REVIVAL is the theme for
this year’s women’s week-
end, and the gospel-singing
group, Staples Singers, will
aid the presentation of that
theme during their concert in
Darby Saturday night. The
Dithyramb, in Cowles Dining
Hall after the concert, will
feature a buffet and dancing.

The Scarlet 8.: Black feels
that, just as it would hope that
the community would be fair-
minded in granting the paper
the right to buy its printing
where it seems most advan-
tageous, so should the stu-
dents respect the right of tho
Grinnell advertisers to adver-
tise where and when they feel
it advantageous to them.
