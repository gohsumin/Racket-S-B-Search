Congress Salvaged Great Society,
Carl Albert Informs Grinneliians

By DICK CHADY

“The day in which the Great So-
ciety was saved” was the first day
of the first session of the 89th Con-
gress, according to House Major-
ity Leader Carl Alberto

Albert delivered the 1965-66 po-
litical lecture Wednesday night and
took as his theme “Legislative
Leadership in the Great Society."
He discussed the role of Congress
sional leadership in organizing and
initiating Great Society programs.

Speaking to a crowd of only 300
in Roberts theater. Albert said that
willie President Johnson is “the
most skillful legislative tactician
of this generation” the key vic-
tory was “conceived, sponsored,
and directed" by House leadership.

Albert was referring to the
changes in House rules cheered on
the tirst day of the 89th Congress,
By adopting a “21-day rule” the
House was able to bring to the
ﬂoor certain hills which would
have otherwise been blocked by
the Rules committee.

And by changing the composi-
tion of the Ways and Means com—
mittee, the House leadership was
able to “control the character and

Wot Included in Decision-making'
Says 56.4 of Ila/I Reorganization

A student government-circulated
petition to President Glenn Leggett
was termed “thoughtiul” and
"gracious" by the college presie
dent.

The petition sought more student
voice in possible decisions about
reorganization oi the residence
halls and gathered 830 signatures.

“We don’t think we're being in-
eluded in the decision~making
about hall reorganization." was
the way Jerry Goddard, Student
Government president, opened
comments to the residence halls
Tuesday night. Goddard went
[mm hall to hall speaking to all
Al dorms. ,

. Goddard indicated that thq,£x-
Ocutivu Council ‘of the iaculty’had
recently been discussing the ‘pos-
tibility of reorganizing the hall
Iystem. He iurther saild that as
things stand now the Executive
Council would make recommem
Actions to President Leggett who
would make the final decision.

. Leggett said that the Executive
Council oi the iaculty was discuss-
trig the problem but that the com-
mitteo was “Very informal" and
that “we're a long way from a
decislon.”

The student petition complained
that the student “rule is going to
be one of objects oi consultation”
and that “students should have a
substantive participating rule be-
yond occasional consultation in

 

any decision on the organizing oi
the residence halls.”

Goddard then suggested that a
joint student - faculty e adminis
tration committee be formed to
discuss the problem or to discuss
it indeed there is a problem at alli

The petition went on to suggest
the joint committee, and rurther
stated that “this proposal involves
no preconceptions about what
changes, ii any, should be made
in the hall systemr The students
themselves are not agreed on this

problem We only ask that the
different opinions be allowed to
actively participate in the decision
process"

in his reply yesterday Leggett
said that he has “asked the EXeCLI~
tive Council oi the {acuity to in-
volve itself in the discussions, with
the hope that it will be able in a
iew weeks' time to construct a
statement at loose proposals which

composition of every committee in
the House"

“Without these changes, it is
doubtiul if any Great Society bills
would have been reported to the
ﬂoor of the House." Albert stated
emphatically.

He explained that even though
the membership of the House
changed considerably atter the
1964 elections, the membership on
the Rules and the Ways and Means
Committees would have been iden-
tical with prevrons years — ii the
changes hadn’t been made.

Albert noted that the Congress
passed 73 major bills, or 88 per
cent of the President's Great So:
ciety program, and that “these
relorms in Januarywere the most
important thing we did all year,"

Albert devoted the second part
of his speech to the misconcep-
tion that “Congress is incapable of
initiating or producing major
bills."

He pointed out that the legislative
process in a democratic country is
necessarily a slow one, often spans
hing as much as 25 years between
the need and the action oi legiy
lation.

But “legislation is not the ex-
elusive province of elected lead-
ers" and “the public orten Con<
(uses White House identification
with the actual initiation of a
bill."

He cited the Area Redevelop-
ment Act, the mass-transit bill,
the immigration act, Medicare, and
the tax reduction bill as examples
oi legislation originally conceived
and prepared by the Congress, and
later identified with the White
House.

Albert concluded by describing
the 89th Congress as ”the session
which has settled more persistent
issues than any other Congress"

Congress Initiates Most Legislation, ,
Asserls Albert of Press Conference

By PAM CLAY

Carl Albert, House Majority
Leader since 1962, willingly an-
swered questions beiore a small
crowd at the student press con-
ierence Wednesday. The out-spo—
ken partisan said that "we are
the aiiirmative party; we are the
party of action!"

He Was asked twice about Con-
gressional versus executive initia-
tiDn of legislation. He stood
strongly tor Congress and said
that in the last session Congress
did initiate most of the legisla-
tion and that Congress is the
only one who can put issues on
the statute books, Congress still
does the legislating; it always has,
and it always will.”

He said that in the next session
a District at Columbia home rule
bill will be passed; but it will
not be exactly what: was asked
for. In addition to the D.C. home
rule bill, be thought Congress
would pass a new minimum
wage bill, repeal ME. look into
the application of civil rights
laws. and perhaps pass an amend-
ment so the selection at jurors
could not be racially biased, He
said that the coming Congress will
be big in civil rights areas and
will go a long way toward easing

Terry. “We are striving for effec-
tive use or alumni representatives
in interview situations ior students
at distant points and ior iollowing
up on the inquiries received. Such
activity, however. requires sub—
stantial organization."

Terry also mentioned that he is
interested in seeking alumni in
teaching positions in the public
schools who can help identify out-
standing high school scholars to
be contacted by the admissions
staii.

The interview itseli has a new
twist. Rather than have I stu-
dent raltle on about his board
scores or extra-curricular activi~
ties, the unsuspecting scholar will
be expected to carry on a discus-
sion or a more intellectual nature

these people are, and how great
an awareness they have oi the
world around them," Terry ex-
plained. '
