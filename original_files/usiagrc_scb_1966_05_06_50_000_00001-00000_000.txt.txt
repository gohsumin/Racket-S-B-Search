8&6 Damage Bills

By JUDY scorr

A special senate committee has recent-
ly been formed to review certain Bare
policies In connection with student at-
fairs. Headed by Lynn Richman, the
committee is delving particularly into
complaints dealing With untair damage
and labor billsl

“We are trying to make eaG policy
in public matter,” stated Richman,
“so students know what is going on.
There have been an awful lot of com-
plaints. Labor bills are mostly a fair
charge. but 8&6 also asks rental for
what appears to be college property such
as chairs, microphones, and Darby stage
setups. There is no reason to pay for it
again and again."

Physical Plant Director Evan Walden
will meet with Richman and his
committee early next week. CofHP Pres-
ident Bob Foote; house presidents Dan
Markinann, Bob Geller, and Rick Sprott;
and student auditor, Lee Schmidt will
comprise the senate committee.

Next year Richman hopes to in-
Vesttgttte working conditions of 3&6 and
other Grillnell service employees. The
investigation will be an attempt to up
date a previous report made in 1963 by
a political science major, Harry Hoff-
man ‘63. V

ConferenceAdvises Clarification of Moral Code

By CATHY JONES

The need for a definite administrative
stand alld for clarification of a mural
code for college communities were the
concerns of Midwest Conference reli-
gious leaders who met on the Grinnell
campus early this week. ,

Represented by a variety of students.
chaplains, counselors, and professors
were Carleton, Beloit, Monmouth, Knox,
Coe, Cornell, and St. Olaf. Speaking for
Grinnell were David Swee, Jan Nichols,
Sam Withers, Janet Hale, Steve Kent,
Jelf Patterson, and Hank Bnlikov.

During the conterence held Sunday and
Monday at Grinllell House, most colleges
represented expressed a positive ratios
tion to tlle need for a sex education

program. similar to the course now of-
fered at St. Olaf.

Riot Damage Totals Not Completed Yet;
Walden Predicts $300 As Possible Cost

Due to individual assessment this
year, the itemized total of the Spring
Riot damage on Tuesday, April 26, has
not yet been compiled, according to Evan
Walden, physical plant director. The

treasurer's office and the Coil-1P will be
billed when the damage has been deter-
mined.

Walden did state, however, that esti-
mated damage is szooaoo, about 25 per

cent of last year’s total. l-le credited the
students with finally deciding that they
didn’t want to pay for the damage from
their social funds. "This has been the
best year in several years," he said
Three cases relating to Riot night will
be brought up in Men's Primary Court
this Sunday. They are tor breaking
globes in the loggia, throwing firecrack-
ers and burning one person, and break
lng bicyles against the wall at Cowles.

In a post-conference interview, Chap-
lain Roger Eldridge declared, “In a col-
lege community such as Grinnell, where
the purpose of education is to teach
the student about man, the gap in this
phase or learning is inexcusable. We have
not made even a modest accomplish-
merit in this area," he continued, “and
the college is highly underestimating the
need tor this type of education in a
residential School such as Grinnell, We
aren't even doing a bad job. We’re simp«
1y doing nothing.”

One reason for this, Eldridge believes,
as did the maJOrlly of the faculty attend-
ing the Conference, is that the faculty il-
Scll is “the most immature segment of
society.” The explanation ollcred tor this

was that faculty spend so much of its
early life in school that it becomes in-

High Court

A decision has been handed
down from the High Court con-
cerning the fines charged to two
West Norris men' for being
locked in the women‘s loggia.
They were fined without a hear-
ing under the new system of the
men's Primary Court and taps

decided not to hear their ap-
peal.

competent to deal with social problems
outside the realm of the academic.

The only solution, according to E1.
dridge, is a satisfactoryy program for
straightforward counseling from a sppa
cialist. In the meantime, the students
have to provide their own program, by
becoming their own specialists through
frank discussions.

“1 have known senior women who are
ignorant of the facts of life. simply be-
cause they’re afraid to ask,” said Elde
ridge. “The feeling that yoll must be
sophisticatedabout sex prevents open dis-
cussion.”

St, Olaf, as an example of a college
with such a program, plans to open the
course next fall to all interested. Pre<
viously it was limited to engaged coup:
ies. The course consists of {our twoshnur
sessions, in which both the sexual and
emotional aspects of marriage are dis<
cussed.

The presence of Steve Kent, SGA pres<
idellt and Hank Balikov, chairman of
the Senate Committee on Campus
Counseling Services, was encouraging to
Eldridge, who thinks that initiation at
such a course can only be accomplished
through encouragement from a variety
of student leaders.

The second important college need em
phasized at the conference was for at).
cessible forums and meetings where stu<
dnts can talk to administrators in both
official and non-official capacities. Relea
vant to Grinnell, Eldridge asserted,

Senate Changes Initiative Fund

By DICK cnaov

The Senate reconsidered at length
what it had enacted in haste by debats
ing the merits of the hall initiative fund
for two hours Wednesday night Last
week's allocation of $4800 generated suf<
ficient oppositinntparticularly on North
Campus) to force the Senate to cut the
fund to 31400 H and that on a trial
basis for one semester.

The new figure was approved by a
23—9 roll call vote after nearly two hours
of discussion and debate. The S e n ate
spent 90 minutes as a "committee-of-the
whole” to discuss the functions of the
initiative fund, the Criteria to be used
in allocating funds, and the amount ne-
cessary to allow halls to plan adequate
social programs.

Bucks Prompts Senator:

The senators were prompted at sev-
eral points by Speaker Dan Bucks,
who first reminded them to delineate
the goals of the fund before debating the
Imuunt, then later-commented that “I
am dissatisfied with the quality of dis-
cussion so for. it has been wandering
aimlessly instead. of being vigorous.”

There were four basic proposals that
evolved in discussion: (a) the Finance
Committee recommended that 5500 be

' placed in the initiative fund and 3900
be allocated for three weekends when
three all-campus parties would be held.

Both figures were for one semester.

(b) A proposal by a group of Sena-
tors fn put $1200 into the fund to be
spent on inter-hall parties. No hall would
be allowed more than $60 per semester.

(c) A proposal by Robert Barrow to
put $1400 into the fund “to encourage
hall initiatives and formulate new social
concepts" This proposal was the one
later adopted by the Senate.

(d) Hank Balikov‘s proposal that each
hall should be guaranteed a minimum
amount in order to insure equal distri-
bution of funds. Balikov later moved to
cut the $1400 in Barrow's proposal to
$1100. but the motion was defeated.

No one defended the $4300 amount
which had been passed by a near-unani-
mous vote that week. Mike Pill moved
that the Senate enter the committeeof-
the-whole by commenting, "The rather
heated discussions of the past week have
proved the hall initiative fund is un-
popular." , .

Jones, Flaw: Propose $1200-

The first proposal to be advanced
(and later withdrawn) was by Ed Jones
and Ron Flscus, who explained that the
Sim would serve as a “bridge between
single-hall and all-campus programs," it
would leave each hall with about $200
per semester and the prospect of $60
more from the fund it inter—hall parties
were held.

Jane Stracke criticized the proposal.

saying that “it negates the purpose of
the fund because it's the same as hall
allocations. There’s no incentive provid<
ed for."

Social Coordinator Bob Johnston com-
merited that the original idea of the
fund was not to encourage different kinds
of parties, but rather to provide fluidity
for social events among ditierent groups.

Discussion then moved to the goals
of the initiative fund. Bob Foote said
that the purposes, as he understood them
were to “provide mobility and' improve
the social program." However, he ad-

mitted that the original amount was too'

large.
Foote Defends Orlginal Plan

Foote defended the proposal of the
Finance Committee by saying that mon-
ey put into a central fund and admin-
istered properly would improve the sir
ciai program. .It would ,"promote mo-
bility and stimulate the social program"
by holding threeweekends of three par-
ties each for the entire campus. He
emphasized the trial nature of the plan
and the capability at changing the al-
location for second semester next year if
the program were unsuccessful.

Ray Horn offered two specific goalst‘
(1) to make more effective use of money
spent on lounge parties and (2) encour-
age more inter-hall cooperau'on on so:
cial events."

[location

At this point Bucks wrote those two
on the blackboard after he changed
the wording of (1) to read “More ef-
fective use of social funds." Later Buck]
added a third point on the board: “to
provide some measure of equality of dis«
tributionr”

After 90 minutes. the committee-of—the
whole made its report, The Senate re-
ported in favor of Barrow's proposal,
with the three stipulations written on
the board to be given to the Initiative
Committee as goals for establishing cri-
teria when funds are requested.

Finally, two hours and ten minutes af-
ter the meeting began, the Senate
passed Barrow’s proposal on a 23-9 ro
Call. The initiative fund will have 51
for the first semester next year. The
Initiative Committee will establish Pity
tori: in accordance with the Senate
recommendations.
