Both segments oi the operation
were under the supervision or

and cadet airman second—class in

donated time were rewarded with
one ‘merit' (the counteracting

By DAVID LIGHTBOURNE

Although nobody bothers to men-
tion it as a theoretical propositlon,
this semester's calendar oi cultur-
al events could be one of the
brightest in recent years, and I’m
thinking specifically of certain new
directions in aesthetic experience
that are assuming a more impor-
tant role in our week-toweek sc-
Iivilies. What I'm talking about is
the increasing element at audience
participation lately, at certain at
our artistic events.

Now, it's common knowledge
that all Worthwhile aesthetic exa
periences are twoway proposi-
tions. that the mind responds in an
indlvtdual and creative way to or
tistic terms that manage to cap»
ture the imagination, What's less

irequentiy recognized, however, is
the value ot mass aesthetic re.
sponse by an entire audience.
when common grounds or excited
appreciation are openly and wide—
ly shared trom one member to the
next. Audiences have been doing
this sort oi thing since the earliest
beginnings o1 comic and tragic
drama, tor instance, and direct
audience participation during the
aesthetic act can accelerate lead-
ing tensions with a remarkable efa
iectiveness. A current example
which immediately comes to mind
is the ARI-I “King or the Rocket
Men" him-serial, which is getting
a lot or attention anyway, ot late,
as a symbol tor several ditierent
points oi VIEWt

One opinion, tor example, sees
all the interest and excitement in
this vintage Iormuta~romance as a
display oi “frivolous" sensibilities
and basically anti-intellectual
tastes. Grinnell students actually
take the filmrlnstallments serious
ly. because, th e i r “parasitic
minds" are evidently incapable or
any moreampitious undertakings.

Another view, will an obviously
more lenient streak, simply recog-
nizes a legitimate nostalgic rever-
ence tor the ongins ol the Ameri-
can “super" hero and openly ad—
mm the sentimentality of such an
attitude. Moreover, the Iilm is 50
dated in bath technique and detail
that the quaintly romantic speu ot
a younger, more innocent en be
comes altogether irresistible.

Neither ot these explanations it
actually acceptable. however, be-
cause neither of them match thl
real a u d i e n c e reaction which
brought the whole subject up, The
film is, in actuality, B classic 0!
its genre, that remarkable cate-
gory ol art which sacririces nearly
all content tor the sake of a mu-
dish style. From our viewpoint,
this disparity is all the more ob.
vinus and Ihux all the more abs
surd, but nevertheless accessible
as art to an audience which under-
stands the opportunities Ior ten<
sion in that disparity.
