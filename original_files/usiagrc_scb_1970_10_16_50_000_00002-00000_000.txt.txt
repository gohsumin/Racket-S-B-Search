to a ”free enterprise educa-
tional system." He appears to
see such a freesenterprise,
"enterpreneurial" systemas
a natural development in the
absence ofa core curriculum.

What he proposes in theplace
ofa strict core curriculum,is
a modified form of divisional
requirement. All of the posi-
tion papers noted above favor
a divisional requirement of
one sort or another, thoughall
but Erickson’s put in a word
for one or anather sort of re
’quired freshman humanities
course.

Kurz’s paper emphasizes the
values and costs of freedom
and innovation. The education-
al value of student freedom of
choice is largely that once
students are allowed to vete
with their feet, courses are
obliged to be innovative and
attractive if they are to be
attended. At its extreme this
innovativeness becomes fadd
ishness, and the concept ofa
liberal education (and with it,
unfashionable courses and de-
partments) is lost in the shufe
fie. Therefore, the paper ad-
vocates freedom “within the
illusion of restraints”. What
this comes to is a prescripe
tive divisional‘ requirement
totalling 40 hours. Except for
a 4 hour Humanities course,
there are no specific course
requirements.

Mr. Cleaver’s paper allows
itself to be a “reserved en-
dorsement" of Kurz’s posir
tion. He does so, but adds to
this pleas for general educa-
tion (“versatility of skills”),
asking: "Is anybody who knows
less than everything freel”.
He nOtes, and quite rightly,
that the no-requirements pro-
posal requires improved ads
vising, and that the case for
that proposal rest "heavily"
on the assumption the adViS*
ing system is presently in-
adequate. He then pleads that
"For those of usesmost of
us '— who have watched the

. margins ofour lines getscribe
bled full ofmiscellaneous colr
lege chores by the end of two

or three years here, SXhOrEa’
tions cause alternate laughter
and tears.”

But the question of advising
remains central to the whole
argument. In Mr. Clotfelter's
original proposal, a distinct-
ion is made between fresh-
manesophomore and major
advising. It is with the former
that he finds most fault, pri—
marily because "the elaborr
ate system of requirements
seems to both the advisor and
the advisee to relieve them of
the necessity of talking about
anything important". He then
proposes, 1) more and better
curricular information to be
given to the student before he
arrives as a freshman: 2)
longer new student days, more
conducive to the formation of
a sound advisorradvisee re-
lationship, and 3) freedom, for
the student to changeadvisors
so as to insure a close rap-
port between student and ad»
visor.

The question is, which best
serves the student; an impro-
ved freshman requires currir
culum which will introduce
the student to many different
"ways men have devised to
order the confusion around
them", or a close, near‘tut
orial freshman advising sys-
tem, which would bring the
questions of generaleduaition
to the student, even before the
start of his first semester?
Nearly all of the position-pa-
pers advocate the continuance
of the humanities require-
ment, with some improvement
of freshman advising. Well,
back to business.

As we go to press, the Clots
felter Proposal appears dead
to all intents and purposes.
Its 4542 defeat was not pubs
lioally challenged, although
there appear from the running
head count based on previous
ballots of that meeting, to
have been more votes than
there were faculty members
present to vote. ‘

deans, two facul members
and five students.

Greg Vranicar, Student Co
ordinator, introduced the
Committee on Student Ser»
vices, which will deal with
the dorms, the food we eat,
the health service, student
placement, and general mm-
pus programs. The member
ship would include the Dean
of Students, the Business Mae
nager, a faculty member and
four students. '

Mary Brooner, A.W.S. pre-
sident, praised the makeup of
the Committee on Counseling
for being ﬂexible and ”not
conducive to confrontation p0,
litics”. The main duty of the
committee would be to re
view and evaluate the existing
counseling program, as well

» as make changes. Brooner'
noted that the students do not
hold any thing close to equal
represennation on the commits

tee and also expressed doubts
about how the committee would
receive information or come
plaints from the students.
The meeting ended in a pre~
dictable fashion: students
locked in the old ”elitism
or apathy?" debate. A few
spoke out against the fact
that the senate appoints or is
included inall the committees;
however Loewi scoffed at the
criticism and complained that
any other system for selecting
student representatives would
be too "time comsuming”.
Perhaps the best summary of
the inherent spirit of the re
port came from the audience
when someone observed that
"this doesn’t appear to be
much ofa studentpowermove»
ment; it seems more like a
student government power
movement". True, true, but
the question ofthe week seems
to be whether or not our
student leaders realize, or
even care. So much for apathy.

its Physical Education provir
sions. Another proposaljoint»
1y sponsored by Mr. Jones
and Barry Zigas was distri—
buted to the faculty at the cone
'clusion of the Oct. lZmeeting.
Mr. Jones' proposal could be
thought of as a sort of imag-
inative compromise between
the positions of maintaining
Humanities and supplanting it
with improved freshman adr
vising. His motion would be:
“Each student is required to
complete the Freshman Tut-
orial Program." This would
be described as a "credit-
fail, non-classroom learning
experience to be completed in
the first semester of the fr—
eshman year". The tutor
would act as the freshman's
advisor, and would work
closely with the student in his
preparation ofa series of 85’
says and acquisition of inder
pendent study and writing sk-
ills.

This program, and its rat-
ionale, should cometo discus
sion next Monday in A.R.H.
Auditorium between 4 and 6
p.m. The faculty-senate mos
ves perforse slowly, but it
remains the best show in town.
All students are encouraged
to attend.

GRINNELL, IA. , Joseph
Frazier Wall, Parker Profes-
sor of History and Dean of
Grinnell College, is the auth-
or of a major new biography
of Andrew Carnegie published
today (Oct. 5) by Oxford Un—
iversity Press.

A prespublication review of
the book in "Publishers’Wee-
kly" acclaims it as "a maS*
terly study of the great em-
pire-builder, and philanthropr
ist, and an engrossing chron-
icle of the rise of Big Busie
ness in the U.S.”

A product of 12 years of in-
tensive research and writing,
the book is called by review
er Matthew Josephson as
"without question one of the
ablest works ofAmerican bio-
graphyﬂ‘

COMPLETE LIFE

The 1150*page volume is the
first modern and complete
life of the industrial giant to
appear in more man 40years.
It is the only work to make
use of the private correspon-
dence of Carnegie and. his
wife, Louise, and of his early
business files and letter books
now in the possession of the
U.S. Steel Corporation and
never before accessible to
scholars.

was successful. One particir
pant in that meeting, student
Senator Barry Zigas, also th~
ought it was helpful, but he
emphasized that mass meets
ings like that should not be
relied on as a continual thing.
The Human Rights Commis

sion Subcommittee is now 100- '

king for other ways to bring
town and college together to
create, in Deminoff's words,
"a real sense ofcommunity."
At their next meetingthe com-
mittee will mectwithfour cola
lege students, and the com-
mittee is working with other
groups to find other activities
for bringing about this sense
of community.

As well as the two town c0m*
mittees and the Community
Day group, a student senate
committee on Alumni rela-
tions has been expanded this
year to cover town andalumni
relations. The committee,
headed by Barry Zigas, has
been cooperating with the
other projects while planning
some new ways whereby it can
esmblish the “continual com~
munication" between townand
college that Zigas b‘elieves is
necessary. ”Too often in the
past," he said "we have only
made efforts to communicate
in crisis situations, and con-
sequently people haven’t lise
tened."

One of the innovations that
the Senate committee is work-
ing on is the establishment of
a college speakers bureau 115*
ting faculty and students with
expertise in certain fields who

would be willing to talkto town
organizations. Also, the com-
mittee is interested in having
radio shows on KGRN, the
Grinnell commercial station,
writing a column in the Grins
nell Herald Register, and dis
tributing the Herald Register
on campus.

included readings in 244 vol-
umes of Carnegie’s corrcsr
pondence stored in the Lib
rary of Congress.

At various times during the
past 12 years Dean Wall has (
conducted research on Car

home where he died in 1919.

COMPREHENSIVE STUDY

Using original sources and ‘
with direct access to other
materials bearing on Carrier
gie's life, Dean Wall givesa _
comprehensive picture of the
millionaire , philanthropist’s
rise in business, his impact
on industrial America during .
the period of great expansion
after the Civil War, his bit‘
ter involvement in the Home
stead steel strike of 1892,
his disillusioning quest for ,
peace before World War 1,
and other facets of a power-
ful but very human figure.

Carnegie’s ventures in 011,
iron and steel, railroads, and _‘
finance are intensively ana‘r '
yzed, as are his business and
personal relationships with
such fgures as Henry Clay
Frick, J. P. Morgan, George V“
Pullman, Mark Twain, Malt‘ ‘
hew Arnold, W‘lliam Glad~
stone, Booker T. Washington,
and Presidents Lincoln, Mc-
Kinley, and Wilson.

Excerpts from Dean Wall‘s
book have appeared in ”Ame
erican Heritage" for June, .
1970. and parts of the book
are also included in the fall .
issue of "Horizon" magazine .
and in the October issue of "
”American Heritage."

On Sept. 25 Dean Wall was
featured at a book-andeauthor
luncheon in Dallas, Tex., with
novelists Robert Penn Warren
and Jessamyn West.
