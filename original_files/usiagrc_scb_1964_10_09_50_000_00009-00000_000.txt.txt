Team Plays Scots
Firsl Away Game

By Kenton Clymer

“Can Monmouth possibly de-
feat Grinnell?" was the ques—
tion posed to Edd Bowers,
coach of the fighting Pioneer
football team.

“The question should be, ‘Can
Grinnell defeat Monmouth?”

. was Bowers' quick reply. “Any

team in the Midwest Confer‘
ence could defeat Grinnell. ll
Monmouth can keep their mo-
rale up after losing their first
two games, they could be
tough.”

Opening day, the Scots took
it on the Chin from Cornell 28‘0.
Last Saturday Ripon rolled over
Monmouth 2770.

Riponrand Cornell are the two
top contenders in the confer-

- ence.

Plowing through the Knox line for a ground gain for the Pioneers is Elston

 

Bowers in last weeks gric

contest.

 

Spirited Gridmen irounce Siwas-h
For First Victory of 1964 Season

By Nick Nona:

A spark of life hit the Grin-
nell College campus Saturday
as the Pioneer gridmen, bol-
stered by an enthusiastic and
spirited crowd — a rarity at
Grinnell, trounced the Knox
Siwash 1670, chalking up their
first victory of tile 1964 came
paign.

The most impressive note of
the about»iace from last Week’s
showing by the Pioneer defen-
nve secondary, which allowed
only two pass completions of
eleven attempts, [or ten yards.
Deiensively, the P i o n e e r s
played a commendable game,
giving up only 149 total yards,
Only once were the Siwash able
to move past the Grinnell 38,
when they penetrated to the
Pioneer 16, and then lost the
ball on clowns.

Late in the ﬁrsgquaxter the
Pioneers began to move the
pigskin. With halfbacks Elston
Bowers and John .Shierholz
grinding out the yards, Grin-
nell drove from its own 46 to
the Knox 18 early in the second
quarter. With fourth down and
eight, Dave Gauger booted a
field goal from the Z7 yard line
for the only score or the first
half.

The Pioneers tallied the first
touchdown oi the game driving
46 yards for the score in the
third quarter. Fullback Marty
Ringo picked up nine to the
Knox 37, Shierholz carried the
ball to the 23 in two runs. Quar-
terback Denny Hanssen gained
three yards on a keeper play.
then hit Bowers on the next
play with an aerial on [he 11.
Ringo drove for five more yards
to the 6, but was thrown for a
loss to the 7 yard line on the
next play. Again the pioneers
came through in the clutch, as

 

Hanssen w i th fourth down
tossed a seven yard pass to
Gauger for the marker. Gauger
kicked the conversion for a 10-0
lead.

The Pioneers put the icing on
the cake late in the fourth quara
tei‘ with the final score of the
game. Chip Clarke intercepted
a Knox pass on the Grinnell 39
and returned the ball to the op»
ponent’s 22. With time running
out Hanssen fired two incom-
plete passes to Gauger in the
endzone. Barry Anderson, tak~
ing over the signal calling,
tossed a screen pass to Bowers
tor the touchdown with 34 sec-
onds remaining on the clock.

The win marked the eighth
time in the last ten meetings of
the two teams that Grinnell has
emerged victorious, with one
contest ending in a tie.

Next week the Pioneers jour-
ney to Monmouth to battle the
Scots.

Hard Hit Harrier-s
Go to Monmouth

The cross country runners,
who broke into the victory Col-
umn for the first time last week
by capturing their own Les

ing for win number two when
they match strides with Mon-
mouth Saturday at Monmouth,
Ill.

The meet is scheduled for
1:45 p.m. on the Scots’ three—
mile course. ,

Running for Grinnell will he
seniors Bruce Beckord, and
Clyde Smith; and sophomores
Steve Brintnall and Andy Bush-
nell.

Captain Paul Patterson, is
still sidelined with a leg injury.
He can't even do any running
for at least two more weeks.

Rod Brown is out for the next
three weeks with mononucle<
osis. He was Grinnell’s top {in-
isher in the Duke Invitational,
coming in fourﬂ'i with a 16:46.0
clocking for the three-mile run.
That's more than a minute over
the Course record he set in 1963.

Beckord was seventh in 17:04,
Brintnall was 11th in 17:13,
Bushnell was 17th in 1 '
Smith was 18th in‘ 17:40.

more - dominated squad this
year that includes only three
upperclassmen.

Monmouth will be led by co»
captains William Taylor; quar~
terback, and Robert Tucker,
halfback. Taylor is also an out-
standing Wrestler, and is the de—
fending coniorence champion in
the 157 lb. division.

Coach Bowers was generally
happy with the playing or the
Pioneers last week against
Knox, and expects to make no
major changes ’in the line-up.
He plans to continue using the
platoon system, which worked
well against the Siwash.

Guard Larry Miller Will still
be out of the lineup due to an
injury. Coach Bowers hopes he
will be able to take limited
workouts this week so that he
will be in shape for the Home-
coming game.

The weakest point in the Grin-
nell attack is the offense. “Our
blocking must improve,” com-
mented Bowers, although he
pointed out that Knox had an
excellent defensive squad.

With three weeks of the 1M.
football schedule in the record
books, Clark and Smith, both
holding unblemished records,
would seem to be meeting ex-
pectations as the teams to' beat,
Smith boasting a 2-0 record,
edged by a tough Langan team
on opening day. A last peiiod
touchdown proved to be the
necessary margin in this 7.0
battle. A seven point margin
was enough for Smith's second
victory also. Smith—13, South#
7. The Clark offense has proved
potent in their three wins, scor-
ing 92 points. Most impressive
Was their 4570 hard fought kit
umph over Rawson.

Dibble, having lost only to
Clark, shares third place in the
standings with West and East.
All three teams are 2 and 1.

Perhaps the most exciting
game of the season was played
between Langan and North.
North jumped out to an early
lead and led at half time by a
score of 11H). However, Langan
struck hack early in the third
quarter and cut the North lead
to six. Finally with less than
three minutes to be played
Doug McCormuck intercepted
a North pass and returned it
sixty yards to even things up,
The all important extra point
was made and the Langan de~
tense held onto the 14713 vic-
tory. North rebounded two days
later by defeating Rawson 15-0,
and gaining a tie with Langan
