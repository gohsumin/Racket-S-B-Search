Not Physically Pfit Says Plitscli,
PfIabb y, Pfat Seniors May Pflunlr

ny Jim i-ierzog

Approximately 100 of 132 senior
men have so far tailed to complete
the physical education objectives
required for graduation.

According to John Ptltsch (phy-
llcal education), only five or six
Out of the 100 are "in jeopardy of
not graduating."

Pfitsch said that the vast ma«
jority of the men have completed

art of the physical education oh-

ctives which qualify for two aca-
demic credits and are needed for
graduation.

The present senior class at Grin-
lies is the first to graduate under
Ihe revised physical education re-
quiremean instituted in the fall
If 1561.

To pass physical education, sen-
lors must (1) pass the college
lwimmmg test, (2) demonstrate
Iliill in two individual carryover
sports, (3) pass a physical fitness
lest, and (4) participate in team
Iports.

“The situation isn‘t really as
bad as it looks,” Piitsch said. He
has checked each student's prog-
less, and said that all are within
ﬂange.

 

"There isn’t anybody who does-
n‘t feel he can complete the re-
quirements,” he said.

Looking at the indivtdual re-
quirements within the program,
Pfitsch said that there are only
two seniors who have had to re-
sort to classes this semester to
complete their team sport require-
ment. Normally, the team sport
requirement is satisfied by par-
ticipation in at least four intra-
mural sports.

Piitsch said some men have not
yet passed the swimming test, but
only three or four oan’t swim. The
others are people who haven’t
taken the test yet. He said there
isn’t anyone Who will find it im»
possible to complete the swimming
requirement.

According to Plitsch, five or six
men have not completed the physi-
cal fitness portion of the test.

Most of the 100 men who have
not completed their physical edu-
cation requirement iack either a
major or a minor carryover
sport, said Plitsch. He added, “The
great majority or these have done
work in one or both carry-over
sports. Looking fairly closely at
the situation, I think it's going to
be okay."

 

Pfitsch said he was most con-
cerned about the four to six men
“who've chosen to procrastinate."
In their cases, few of the physical
education requirements have been
completed and their graduation is
doubtful.

As to the program itself, Pfitsch
feels that it has been successful.
He Sald, “I think the people I
have worked with have gotten
more from this program than the
aid program." The old program
applied to the class of 1964.

The worst offenders in failing to
complete the requirements, said
Pfitsch, are the varsity athletes.

Offered for men as majors are
the following sports: tennis, golf,
acquatics, small Craft, bowling,
and karate. For minors the same
sports are offered, and in addi-
tion, bndmiton, paddle tennis,
fencing, riding, skiing, ice skating,
and unicycling can be taken for
credit.

(CPS) More than 150 students
from the City University of New
York have volunteered this semes-
ter to tutor chlldren in remedial
subjects at schools, churches and
community centers in Harlem.

Studenls' Rights Essentially lust.
Asserls ‘Firm Believer' in letter

To the Editor:

I write this letter because I
have a firm belief in the im-
portance of the maintenance of
the civil liberties of any mem-
ber of any society. In spite of
the fact. that a college commun-
ity is a unique kind of society,
possibly even because of this
fact, I feel that the liberties
which are guaranteed by the
Sixth Amendment of the United
State OOHSLituLlOn, and the Uni-
versal Declaration of the Rights
of Man. should apply to Grin-
nell College.

The right of the accused to
confront his accusers has been
a basic right of Americans vir-
tually since we became a na-
tion. Despite the fact that this
has not been the custom in all
academic institutions, the es-
sential justness of this position
seems to me to be confirmed.

It may be argued that such a
right in a college society would
be impractical. It would be. if
the goal of the college were
"practicality”; however, just
as in the society beyond the col-
lege community, the loss of
an amount of that which is
i‘practical" is the price which
we must pay for our freedom.
Why should we not be willing
to pay this price in a college
community as well? Is freedom
not to be as valued here as in
the Outside world? Should not
those rights which we regard
as basic in the outside world be
basic to all phases of life, in-
cluding that of the college com-
munity as well? My argument
is not that we should adopt this
liberatarian position because it
is practiced in the outer com-
munity, or because it will edu-

Columns like Carl Otis Gray's:

that make people want to say,

The white than controls the 50‘

more so, than the Negroes in

At least, we still hold a popu-

as Americans. hold true. X Wan!
to see these rights given to stu-
dents because they are just.

I believe that the administra-

tion has the right to have the
final say in the making of the
laws of the community; how-
ever, I feel that in the carry-
ing out of these laws, the 8dr
ministration should adhere to
the judicial methods which are
the principal groundwork of a
democratic society.

About Peace Corps

“A venture in mutual under-
standing” is what Dudley
Weeks Calls his two year Peace
Corps teaching assignment in
the jungles of North Borneo.
Weeks, a 24 year-old graduate
of Southern Methodist Univer-
sity, will be on me Grinnell
campus Thursday and Friday,
March 18 and 19, to speak about
his experiences.

Weeks, knowri to the Villagers
as “Sigar”—the leaderiworhed
in the rice patties to learn the
dialect, taught English, history,
and geography, organized a
Boy Scout troop, gave first aid
demonstrations, taught sewing,
and gave swimming instruc-
tions.

The village in which Weeks
lived fit the Peace Corps
“image”—it had no running
water and no electricity. As a
matter of fact, most at the vii-
lagers had never even heard of
America.

Weeks' involvement with the
young people of his community
did not end when he returned
to the United States. Using his
own money, Weeks returned to
Borneo to set up an education
fund for students to continue
their schooling.
