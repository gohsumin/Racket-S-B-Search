Swimmers Meet Monmouth Saturday
For First Of 7 Conference Meets

GlinlleII’S swimmers will open a
string or seven dual meets with
Midwest Conference toes by tak-
ing on Monmouth at Monmouth,
11L, tomorrow.

mm a disappointing periorm.
ance at Luther a week ago, the
Pioneers will be atter their first
victory at the campaign. They
came in second to Wayne State
and only one point ahead or l.u-
ther last Saturday, and a week
earlier nailed both lllinois Normal
and Gustavus Adolphus in a 3-way
meet here.

"We didn't come Close to swim-
ming up to our potential last
week,” said retiring coach Irv Si-
mone. “Though we are now down
to six swimmers, we can still be
heard irom. But. we have got to
start moving out right away"

The Scarlet Ind Black won (our
events at Luther, writing new pool
marks in two of themt But the
lack oi depth was again very no-
ticeable, They were able to place
more than one man in only two
of the nine individual events,

The pool marks were claimed
by outtcrilyer Ken Adelman, who
also holds the Grinnell school and
pool marks, and the medley relay

at January 21, 1966. I, too, love
walking down railroad tracks. i

lead the way toward better educa-
tional methods, and to help set
standards."
