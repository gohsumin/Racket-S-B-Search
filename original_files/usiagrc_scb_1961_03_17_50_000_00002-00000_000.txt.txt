Let Us See For Ourselves

Last night a state department interpreter. in an anti,
Castro position. said to a group of students alter the Arrom
lecture, “If you’d go to Cuba, you’d see that things were
bad."

This week a petition printed by the Fair Play For
Cillia Committee, but not officially afi iated with that
group, which has no chapter on campus, is being circulat-
ed among students and faculty.

The petition directed at President Kennedy urges
a re sion in tile state department policy of hostility tor
ward Cuba. It suggests that diplomatic and t Ade relations
be restored and that the Cuban people be permitted to de-
telmine their own destiny without interference irom any
outside sources. More important, but contingent upon its
other prov sions, the petition suggests that the 1; \\'Cl ban
on (‘nba be litted.

The petition does not encourage an Ollt‘mifl-Ollt sanc-.
tion of Castro practices and policies; rather, it snide; s
that it is to eas ' to draw wrong conclusions from an arm
chair hundreds of miles away from the area of contention.
relying only upon ”interpreters" and our “sometimes l'l'ee
pre s.”

if the state department is so convinced that “Castro-
land” is “bad,” Interested students at Grinnell and through-
out the U.S. are only asking ”Won't you let us be truly
American? Won’t you let us see for ourselves?”
