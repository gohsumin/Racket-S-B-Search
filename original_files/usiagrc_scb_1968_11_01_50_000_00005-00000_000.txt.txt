whether it he the active power
of Mr, Schneimv, Mr. Branden
Miss Tinker et a1. or the pas-
sive power of the students at
large, who want social licen-
tiousness and have it. They will
not hesitate to jettison their
current leaders in return for a
license to be licentious. This
first teeble display of faculty
power will not, i fear. serve to
deter the power at the students,
which, like all appetites ior
power, “grows by what it ieeds
on."

Need for Obscenity
In 5&3 Noted

To the Editor:

The most dangerous way to
censor something is to ignore
its existence. This is the tech-
nique used by the 5&3 this term
in dealing with the so—called
“obscene" language.

Since “obscenity” is a matter
of the individual conscience, the
5&3, like The New York Times,
has no right to keep the reality
at news from its readers, and
then to impose its own “ob-
scene” language, by printing
such truly “obscene” words as
"hill" in its columns while re-
fusing to print such healthy and
lite-giving words akbut l sup-
pose you would refuse to print
any words which I altered as
examples even in the antiseptic
context of this letter. So I shall
have to rely on general and
common sense of vulgarity to
supply your deficiencies.

it seems to the perfectly ap-
propriate, and since sn-called
“ohscenities” represent a good
deal of the normal ethos 0!
American culture, the 5&3 has
a moral obligation to reflect
America as it is.

No Love 5 Labors Lost on Critic I

By ELEONORF. SPIEGEL

Love’s Labour’s Lost is prob-
ably one oi the lirst plays in
which Shakespeare investigates
the tashions ot his day, such as
Euphuism, and the moral con
sequences oi adhering to those
fashions. Those of us not too
familiar with Elizabethan fash-
ions, or not even too lamiliar
with the play, missed many of
the jokes and some of the mean-
ing at the play. One might well
wonder why the theater depart»
ment chose this particular play
to produce, especially during
Homecoming, when the audience
was largely parents who had
probably not read the play he—
iorehand. Perhaps since iemale
virginity has been such a ter-
vently discussed topic this se-
mester. the theater department,
seeing that there is another side
to the coin, telt obliged to put
on a play dealing with male
celibacy; and perhaps, by pro-
ducing It ior parents, they hoped
to win back some donations
which the Schneirov case has
lost us. But that is only my opin-
fan; you are each entitled to
your own.

In spite of the diliiculty o! the
play, the cast, for the most part.
gave a good performance. M .
Fritz Schwaller might have been
I little less earnest sometimes,
but he made up ior that detect
by a clarity and strength of
diction which some of the other
characters lacked. The role ol
Berowne must have been a hard
one for a man of Mr. William
Saylor'a energy and intensity;
but, except for the scene in
which he yields so seriously to
Cupid, he portrays a jesting,
mocking lord very well.

I was afraid that the Princess,
played by Elizabeth Wichmann,
and her ladies might suffer from
the same faults the King and
his lord did; but, to my pleasant
surprise. they were almost an
tirely charming, gentle, and
feminine. Miss Patricia Cor-
bett’s rendering oi Maria was

girlish and funny but some~
times a little overdone.

Mr. Charles Kimbmugh’u
wide experience was evident in
his periormnnce, He managed
to express pomposity in his
very bearings, and his intona-
tion was fully that of an old
courtly gentleman. AS for Dull
(Dennis Wilson), Nathaniel (Ned
Benton), and Holoiemes (Arthur
Knowles). they were so good in
their respective roles that i
hope most earnestly, for their
sakes, that they were not type-
cast. Moth (Ricki Ravilts), with
her boyish impudence, and Cos-
tard (Michael Grant), who was
so iunny as the sly and simple
clown, came dangerously close
to stealing their scenes and un-
doubtedly provided the best
comedy in the play,

When Marcade (P o rte r
Woods) came slowly up the
stairs in tront oi the stage,
someone behind me booed loud—
ly, thinking that the Villain of
the melodrama had now come;
and i myseli was taken aback,
wondering what Abraham Lln—
coin was doing in a Shakespear-
can play. But that was the only
instance of lncongruus costum-
ing that struck me; the other
costumes all seemed pleasingly
appropriate.

The ending at the play, on
Thursday night, began to re-
semble a grand finale, as all the
characters came out to dance
around the maypoles, but what
should have been the climax
was lost in applause, because
the actual finish of the play was
ambiguous. Whatever effect that
ambiguity was supposed to pro~
duce did not occur, unless con-
fusion was intended; and it
seemed a shame to end the
perloi‘munce in that way. But.
oi the perlormance as a whole,
I must say that those at us who
saw it loved it, though we la-
bored to catch some or the jokes,
and those of you who missed it
have lost that lovely experience
torever.

—Brotherhood, Re-publius

Where the Truth Lies . . .

Ey DONALD STUMP

Two weeks ago the latest additions to the growing list or
lltudent publications were made with the bll‘th of The Brotherhood
from the Concerned Black Students and Re-puhllus from th-
Young Republicans. Curiously enough, both papers seem to have
the same motto: not “All the news that’ii fit to print,” but rather

» “All the views that lit. we’ll print."

Neither publication succeeded, in its first issue, in establishing
I coherent reason for existence or an editorial policy. The Brother-
hood ostensibly contains “articles written by individual Black stile
dents to relate to the white community what it is to be Black in
Grinnell College." The quotation of Don Lee, howeveryplaced in
I box beside the paper's flag. comes closer to expressing the intent
of the articles and editorials of the first issue. it says, “I seek tho
integration ot Negroes with Black peoplesVMost of the paper
was addressed to fellow Black students with the purpose of gain- '
trig unity and political power.

Republius states as its purpose "to present issues of any na-
ture relevant to our time that demand consideration and evoko
responsible action." The phrase is what one might expect from a
young party paper: plationn prose aimed at disproving the state-
ment “You can't please all of the people all of the time.”

I fear that the failure to use reason and examine'the goal.
which ought to shape the editorial policies of the two papers will
either doom or damn them in the future. In the case of The Brotlb
zrtiood, the policy of trying to unite everyone who is Black, rs-
gardless of their characters and their moral and political aims,
will damn it. in the publication CBS seems to have gone the way
of! Richard Schneirov into blind commitment to a revolution by any
means and with any leaders who have power. In one article it is
written,

If you can’t dig the (Black Panthers) . . . you have to ho

a Tom or (1 Chuck. '

Don’t put your brothers down. They’re blood.

The N.A.A.C.P., a bunch of Toms, tells us we can’t make

it hating. They must be crazy.

Throughout the paper, lssues are polarized and the wisdom o1
integration is rejected without any more attempt to argue against
it than the claim that it was "the white answer for years.” What:
good can a paper do that throws out the goal oi the entire Civil
Rights Movement and accepts the color of men's skin as tho
pr‘inctple organization in society without any coherent attempt to
argue the case? What use is a paper which makes ialse distinc-
tions and blurred ones, such as the emotional use of the word
“colonial" to describe the relation of “Black America” to “White
America." How helpful to anybody are the unsubstantiated charges
oi racism in the grading at Black students by white professors,
especially in a paper which is racist itself? It the purpose at The
Brotherhood is to unite Blacks, it unites them at the cost of their
reason,

Re-publlus is not damned by irrationally and power politics
yet, but if it does not deiine its own purpose, it may be doomed
to die of aimlessness. I wonder what the editors would do if
someone submitted an article praising Hubert ilumphrey, who
certainly “demands consideration" and "responsible action” at tho
moment. It seems to me that the publication will serve its best
purpose if it reveals the nature at the party it represents and the
wisdom of the party’s policies. I am afraid that it will founder if
it attempts to criticize at large something as big as all of society.

The Brotherhood and Re-puhiius both illustrate a general dis-
trust ol reason which, quite ironically, pervades Grinnell's student
body. CBS has made no use of the education of its staii to try to
understand their actions in the “real world.” Re-publlus suiters
from uncertainty that even the party which it represents can be
defended rationally, as evidenced by the reprinting oi Lippmann’s
resigned acceptance of Nixon and the absence of any probing of the
party philosophy except in Ira Bolnick's short article. One wonders
how well prepared students are for tackling the "real world" when

,we cannot yet use our well trained. probing minds to examine our

political commitments.
