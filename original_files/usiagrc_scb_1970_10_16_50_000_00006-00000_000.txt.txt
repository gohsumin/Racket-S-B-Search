Urges Repeal Of Abortion Lows

(Continued from page 5)

lieves that the courts wilisoon
face the question: "What are
the rights of a father when
the mother wants to he abor-
ted but the man wants the
child?"

Of course, liberal abortion
laws will solve more problems
than they create. The chief
beneﬁt expected is destruc-
tion of the criminal abortion
business. Besides classic
tales of infection and hemorr
rage, Dr. Gendel revealed that
many abortions are performed
on women who are not really
pregnant. Criminal abortion-
ists are net concerned with
details. As Dr, Gendel said,
“Criminal abortion is a reef
ket. It'saboutmakingmoney.“
Since the demand for aborn
tions will not just go away, a
realistic society should pro
tect women from such abuse.
Dr. Gendel contends that lib—
eralized laws stem from this
recognition. They attempt to
rectify an old double sland'
ard - n0t between male and
female , but rather a discre-
pancy between:

“women with money who'

could always have a good,
clean abortion and the poor
who were exposed to degran
dation or even death when
seeking an abortion. "

Liberal abortion laws are
some improvement, but id-
eally- Dr. Gendel and others
of her profession want "to
see all abortion laws repealed
because it's not a legal issue;
it is a medical issue between
patient and doctor."

Despite tremendous rain, the
Conference’s second session,
"Interpersonal Relations,"
drew a large crowd. Dr. Gena
del's responses to questions
were based on her bSIIEf that
"there is a sexual system ap-
art from the reproductive sys*
tem since those two functions
have been separated in recent
times." To deal creatively
with this new freedom, Dr.
Gendel urged an emphasis on
"the mutuality of roles and
the likeness of the sexes."
Sex must become generally
human, net something rigidly
defined by social roles. Dr.
Gendel asserted that little

boys have been put into boxes
as crippling as those little
girl's occupy. Both must be
freed to act as human beings,
n0t types. Specifically in re
ference to a sexual relation-
ship, Dr. Gendel stressed the
need for constant communica-
tion between partners. Since
old stereotypes are gone, in
their place people have great
opportunities for individual
development if they only com~
munioate.

Dr. Gendel saw no evidence
of an increase in sexual acti-
vity because of the muchrdis
cussed “sexual revolution."
Instead, she noted a new wil-
lingness to discuss sexuality
and a new tolerance ofvarying
sexual standards; As support,
she cited changing reactions
to the famous Masters and
Johnson sexuality studies.
Five years ago, the first
results were published and
greeted with a storm of mail,

half of it disapproving. When

Human Sexual lnadequa cy was
recently published, only a
handful of letters condemned
the study.

Mention of Masters and jo-
hnson prompted some aud~
ience attack on the project
for taking a ”mechanical"atr
titude toward sexuality.

Having worked with MaSters
and Johnson, Dr. Gendel was
in a good position to defend
their work by explaining just
what they wanted to learn and
how they actually went about
it. The gathering concludedas
she reminded the audience:

"We talk a 10t about human
relationships, but we don‘t
really know anything about
them." Masters and Johnson
are trying to fill some of the
gaps. Whilemore humane life
styles are developing, "we
have not left the oldstandards
completely behind. It will all
Lake time."

Art Acquisition Committee
To Select College Collection

The Art Acquisitions Com—
mittee enters its second year
minus Mr. Zirkle, now on
leave of absence. New mem-
bers of the committee this
year include two students, Kim
Issacs and John Shanstrom.
Dean Wall is the chairmanand
the other members are Mr.
Legett, Mr. Cervene, Mr.
Klienshmidt, and Mr. Clotfele
ter.

The Committee selects and
purchases art works with an
annual budget of about three
thousand dollars a year, drawn
from the Samuel R. Rosenthal
Fund and donated by Mr. Ro-
senthal, one of the trustees.
The bulk of the acquisitions
are contemporary prints and
those works of earlier masts
ers that can be obtained. The
college also receives gifts of
art work, notably from the Ron
senfield, Rosenthal and Sch»

Biology Department Gets Grant

GRINNELL, IA. “e Grinnell
College has receiveda MI ,700
National Science Foundation
grant for cooperative compu-
ter-oriented curricular devr
elopment in biology, President
Glenn Leggett has announced.

The work at Grinnell, sched-
uled for a 267month period
ending in the fall- of 1972,
will be directed by Benjamin
F. Graham, Jr., professor of
biology.

Similar N.S.F. grants for the
biology project have been aWV
arded to Central College, C17
arke College, and the Univer-
sity of lowa.

The National Science Foun'
dation is also supporting a
parallel cooperative compu-
terroriented curricular pro-
gram in mathematics, which
is being developed by the Un-
iversity of Iowa, Augustsna
College (Illinois), Dubuque
University, Iowa Wesleyan

College, and Marycrest Cole
lege.

Curricular development in
the two areas will be corret
lated through an existing com-
puter network centered at the
University of Iowa.

In biology, the work will fo-
cus on the development of a
two-semester course tenta-
tively titled “An Introduction
to Computing Methods in Bias
logy" and the preparation of
“A Handbook of Computer
Applications in Biology."

"The course will probably
be aimed at the sophomore-
junior level of college work,
in the hope that it willprovide
a foundation for continuedstu-
dy in advanced undergraduate
courses, student research,
and graduate work," Dr. Gra-
ham said.

The handbook is planned as
a basic, self— contained collec-
tion of work units for inser‘

ram collections. Themostre-
cent gift included three mode
ern prints given by the Re
public Insurance Company of
Des Moines.

The Committee met lastyear
and bought some prints of the
London Graphica Company. It
will meet againsometime this
fall. All of the prospective
acquisitions are lined up in
the basement of the Fine Arts
Building, and each member
looks over them individually
to select the one he prefers.
The Committee then meets
in a group and determines the
final selections by concensus.
Before the committee was
formed two years ago, the art
department assembled the
college's collection. Mr. Cer-
vene still remains the com—
mittee’s most active member.

The body of art owned by the
college is growing quite large
and it is hoped that sometime
in the future, when funds be-
come available, a museum
will be built for it. Until then,
pictures will be made avail—
able for faculty and adminis-
tration ofﬁces, and will be
displayed in public places.
The committee also hopes to
acquire a large outdoor sculpn
ture for the quadrangle by
Roberts Theater.
