In Statement Released by Stauss

Acting President of the College James H. Stauss issued a state-
ment Wednesday designed to settle the lollgrdlscussed problems oi juris-
diction and due process in matters of student misconducli

in a preiace to the Huge statement he wrote, “The tollowing regu-
lations do not represent unanimous agreement at all points among

those who were concerned with these matters, However, they do ,Vol. LXXll

represent substantial and prepon-
derant agreement, some compro~
mise, and a settlement ot issues
which l support."

On the problem oi jurisdiction,
three kiirds ot cases are distin-
giusheu: "cases oi alleged mls~
conduct apprehended by student
Uillccrs," “cases of alleged mis-
conduct brought l0,llle attention oil
student deans, but not appl’e-i
hrndtd by student otiiccrs," and
-~cascs oi alleged misconduct both:
apprehended i student Dlilcers
and lilac, irily brought to tho
uttelitlan at student deans.”

in each instance, the pursue-
non of tire student courts, the
Dozills' Commlllce, and the cul-
ty committee on Student Ali-airs
is outlined. Special cases are also
or d, along With the normal llllCS‘
oi Jltllsdlctlon and cominiiirica-i
tlon.

Discussing a code regarding turn,
‘iSCllCtlolt and related matters, that
report saitl lliat “insofar as pos-
sible, a unitorm rationale oi pen,
dings should apply to the deco
status of the Student court system,
the deans’ Committee and the
Committee on Student Alldiis, Ac-r
cordingly, close cooperation anal"
adequate communication amongi
these agencies is essential."

The report tuithei- outlined reg-
ulations on iair hearings tor each
at the three agencies involved in
hearings or misconduct charges —
the student courts, the deans‘ com»
mrttee and the chn,

Under a section an a code for
iair hearings in the Committee on
Student Affairs, the report recog-
nized that "the student's rights
and liabilities under college regua
lations are not fully analogous to
the citizen’s rights and liabilities
under public law, There is a fun—
dalnental difference between What
is at stake in each case: one:
concomitant privileges as students
on,one hand, and one’s inherent
rights as a citizen on the ulher.”

seeded to taclile the structural
and procedural characteristics of
this government,

“Normally well-lnteilltotled peo-

mentioning the constitutional re

in discussing the separation of
powers, Gllmour stated that “the
executive branch is generally
ready to move betore the legisla-
tive,” and Cited the example of
the deieat oi Truman's 1949 pro-
posed civil rights legislation, the
result being the action ot the
courts in the 1950's and now the
subsequent need “to move ahead
on all three fronts."

Continuing trom the problem or

Senate Goes Out w

ith Whimper, Bang,

Also Speeches, Budgets, Committees

The Student Senate met for its
final session Wednesday evening
and cleared up obstacles in the
path ot its dissolution in commend-
able fashion.

Final reports were heard train
the several student officials and
the Senate ioculty adviser. Ron-
ald Kurtz (anthropology). Kurtz
commended the Senate for several
areas at advancement, including
the achievement of a Successful
student “pressure group.”

In regards to student relations
with college administrators, nuts
going sen President Phil Johnson
said, “Pressure must he used with
caution, and ill the proper form,
but it must be consciously main
tained as a legitimate function” of
student government. _

On the subject of the 5&8, John-
son said. “I suggest that it might
be useful tor the 5&3 to report the
news, instead of always looking
for something to attack, and that
student olticials might try to see
the editor and reporters in a dif-
ferent light than they might View
the Maiia or Typhoid Mary."

Johnson declared, “The north
campus hall system must be
junkedo The present system has in»
bred to culture which is antirintelr
lectual and lacking iir respect tor
individuals."

Proctors might help, Johnson
said, "but the problem Will not
really be solved until it becomes
regular practice to move from one
hall to another each year and the
present inbred cultures are de-
strayed."

Pete Read

An exhibition of over 100
photographs taken recently in
Selma, Alabama, by 5&3 pho-
tographers John Phillips and
Henry withelm is now on dis-
play in the Forum lobby.

 

closed his career by saying, “Stir-
dent government is tinally realiz-
ing that its role as a political pres
sure group is negligible. We must
represent student opinion, but we
shouldn't degrade it‘by tlaunting a
pride-filled, nonexistent force in
the taces or those who sincerely
wish to work with us in creating
the best education for Grinnell
students."

The admissions committee of the
Senate made a tinal report in
which it urged that a permanent
committee be set up by the ad-
Visory council to seek out Out-
standing students “who, though in-
terested in a school like Grinnell,
may not be acquainted with Grin-
nell because of its isolation and
very recent emergence as a lead-
ing college."

The finance committee made
several recommendations t h a t
called tor no major increases in
financing tor the publications and
SGA but asked substantial in-
creases for the social fund.

The report oi the foreign stua
dents board showed that the board
spent about 5700 last year and
earned about 54500.

The Senate next defeated two
resolutions that would appropriate
$300 tor the Military Ball and $100
for the 5&3 from the General Bud-
get arid Reserve Fund. The Sen-
ate then passed a motion that pro-
vided $150 for the Military Ball
from GBKtR.

Additional money necessary for
the dance will come from social
funds, The 5&3 has no means for
recouping most of the loss in-
curred in the recent eight per cent
budget cut, nearly halt of which

 

i would have been restored by pass-
lage oi the resolution.

' As its final act, the Senate
passed a motion to establish a stu-
dent committeemi faculty afiairs.

Discuss Viet Mom

“The reason the problem in
South Viet Nam is so complicated
is because it cannot be considered
in isolation," James Magee (poli-
tical science) stressed in discuss-
ing the complexity ot the Soutlla
east Asian situation at a coilea
hour sponsored by the Grinnell
Committee on Viet Nam in the
South Lounge Monday.

0n the panel with Magee were
Alan Jones (history), Harold
Fletcher (political science), Ray
mond Betts (history), and Robert
Voertman (economics),

Fletcher stated that the United
States, with its puppet regime,
is fighting a war against the civ-
ilian population of Viet Nam and
described the US. as “hell-bent"
on making a local incident an in-
ternational one. He later said he
