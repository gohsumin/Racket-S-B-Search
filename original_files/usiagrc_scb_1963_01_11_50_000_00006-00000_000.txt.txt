the team has had to practice:
spent together as a team, their
performance was first—rate. :

The first period of the game
was scoreless, although the Grlnr
nell team peppered the goalie
with shots at the beginning of
the period

THE DES MOINES team took
a 2—0 lead in the next stanza
and added another goal before
the Grinnell team came storming
back.

They scored two quick goals
before the All-Stars tallied again
and added another with about 4
minutes left in the game.

The Grinnell team threaten-
ed thereafter but could not, in
the short time remaining, come
through with the tying goal.

The Grinnell hockey team is
not intercollegiate but is a club
formed through the initiative of
a few interested students.

PARTICIPATION has been
enthusiastic thus far. with 25
students making up the team.

the Des Moines team were: For-
