tle gangs, and little drum. Ann
Hoganson, Jim Bruce, and

drama class, only a few stu-

NQSAS Apartheid Issue

Jonty Driver is an unusually tall'l’nan, He
is also a tragic rnan. Jonty Driver is President
of the National Union of South African Stu-
dents. which is today struggling fiercely
agains the government of South Africa over
the issue of apartheid. The student members
of NUSAS are actively opposed to this repres-

sive social system, and have called for wide-
spread social Ireform.

On October 17.,four members of the govern-
ment Security Police raided the NUSAS office
in Cape Town. The officers searched through
files, read correspondence, and confiscated
eight documents For two months now, the
Ministers of the South Africa government have
carried on a campaign of slander and intimis
dation against NUSAS.

The intent of these moves is to frighten
students away from the organization and
lay the ground for an eventual banning of
NUSAS. The government has full authority
to do this, for (he Sabotage Act of 1962 em-

. powers the government to treat as a
criminal virtually any person who openly
criticizes government racial policy.

A ban on the organization would be a fairly
mild governmental action in South Africa,
Over 335 other South Africans who have op-
posed the racial policies ‘of the government
are now being held in solitary confinement in
prisons throughout the country. Some of these
people have been in solitary rooms of cells for
five and a half months, beyond the reach of
lawyers, family. or the church. The laws of
South Africa allow the government to hold for
an indefinite period of time any person sus-
pected of “communism,” which in this case
means almost any opposition to the govern
ment’s policy of apartheid. Prisoners are al-
.lwed no visitors, no legal recourse, and no

.contact with the outside world. Many lam<
lies do not even know where arrested persons

a held.

,' The policies that these people have a.»
posed are designed to effect a complete
separation between South Africa’s 3,250,000
whites and its 13,815,000 Africans, Asians.
and mixed < ancestry “colored." Some
members of the same families hag: been

 

separately classified as European and

Colored under the Race Classification sys-

tem.

It is unlawful for a white person and a non—
white person to drink a cup of tea together in
a tea room anywhere in South Africa, unless
they have obtained a special permit to do so.

If an African sits on a bench in a public park
which is set apart for the exclusixe use of
White persons, he commits a criminal offense
and is liable to a fine not exceeding three hun-
dred pounds, or to imprisonment for a period
not exceeding three years, or to a Whipping
not exceeding ten strokes, or to any combina—
tion of two of these punishments.

Over 350,000 Africans are convicted under
the “pass” laws each year. A pass is a govern
ment document carrying the bearer's name,
photograph, tax receipts and official permis-
sion for the bearer to be wherever he is. With-
out a pass an Air an cannot enter a town or
City or work for wages on a farm, He must
carry it with him always and must surrender
it immediately on demand from any police-
man or authorized member of the public. With-
out it he may at any time of the day or night
be arrested and imprisoned.

Thisris the system Jonty Driver is fight-
Ing. Jim Parkison, Dan Friedlander, and
I met Jonty this summer at [he USNSA
National Student Congress in Indiana. He
is visibly sad and when he talks about his
country, because he knows the present
conflict can only end' in violence and
misery for his countrymen and of all racer.

Many students and student governments
familiar with the situation in South Africa
have expressed their concern for the safety of
NUSAS through personal messages and resolu-
tions of various kinds. This has been done in
the hope that moral suasion and the glare of
publicity Wlll temper the actions of the South
African government. This happened once be-
fore, in the Treason Trials of 195549131. The
pressure of inter-national protest in that case
had clear effects, and the government backed
down. Hopefully this will work again to save

NUSAS. If it does not, a valuable voice for ,

freedom in the apartheid struggle will be sil-
enced. And Jonty Driver will go with it.

parts are from tapes Mrs.
Hung brought with her.
“One of the reasons this
play was chosen was be-
cause fewer costumes would
be necessary," Mrs. Hung

said. “Chinese opera uses a
bare stage with only a few
pieces of setting which sug-

gest the scene. Such a bare

stage has to have elaborate
costumes to attract atten-
tion.

Karen Hardy is in charge of
costumes for the play. Even
articles such as high soled
boots and the emperor’s beard
are being made by Grinnell
students. The shoes are spe-
cially made to give the illue
sion of the actors’ having tiny
bound feeti

The play will be followed by a
performance of the "Dance of
the Palace Lanterns," directed
by Mrs. Betty Voertman. The
lanterns, whose patterns have

 

been designed by Richard Cer-
vene (art), were also made by
the Oriental drama class.

“The movements in the
play and dance are all
stylized," Peggy Ziegenhag-
en noted. “When we first
started rehearsing, it was
hard to get inside the char-
acter because of the formal ‘
aspect. Also, it is a difficult ,
for anyone not trained to
perform an opera to execute
the motions correctly. Chl-
nese actors are placed in a
theater school in childhood
and are trained for years.
Dexterity of movement is
one of the greatest criteria
for a good actor.”

Mrs. Hung replied, “Despitl
the stylization of movement,
the play portrays the same hu-
man emotions as any western
play. The fundamental in-
stincts and emotions are the
same everywhere." '

Members of Orchesis rehearse for the "Dance of I’M
Palace Laterns" which will follow "The Price of Wine."
