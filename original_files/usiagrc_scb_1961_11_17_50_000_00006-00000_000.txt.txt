Bayard Catron, who has
since joined the students in
their trip, presented a state—
ment signed by interested stu-

He introduced the speech by
saying, “I am here tonight to‘
present to you a Joint statement
iormulatcd and endorsed noti
only by interested students, iii-
cluding student government oiii-,
cials, but by members of the
Grrnncll college faculty. i

“Their individual positions are
mrrch broader than the scope oi
this statement and differ to a,

I
this statumcllt they have iound‘
a common basis or beliei."

The statement was signed by
(philosophy and
religion), Charles Cleaver (Eng
ish), .lill Dcnnlngton, Dan 17‘1ng
gins, Bill lialama, Carol Miller,
Linda Millerl

‘Dol‘othy Slnardaclc and Bayardi

Cdtron.

Explaining the content of the
statement. Catron emphaSlzed
the urgency and gravity oi the‘
international situation. “We haveI
been appalled by the idea that
students should not act uponl

these issues (the arms race, dis-
armament etc ) as .tudents. Wlio‘
is going to inherit this burden.-
some problem? Why are we bee
ing educated it it is not to relate
ourselves to the exterll al
world?" i

I
It was the responsibility ol‘

, liberally educated men and won

, men he continued, to take some

kind oi action against the apathy
that is all too prevalent in the
US. today. He s d that while
all would not agree with the
stand taken by the 14 Washing-
ton—bound students, they had
given a great deal ot thought to
the situation and concluded that
this was the only course of ac—
tion open to them.

Catron concluded by saying,
“It is extremely ditiicult to tace
the issues which have prompted
the concern of the students who
are going to Washington next
week. it you have tried conscien»
tiously to lace all positions
“lieadon” you know there are
no linal lacts which will bring
agreement ol views.

“The group which has signed
this statement has done so be—
cause we respect and admire
the considerations and sacritices
made by these students and we
support them in their concern
and responsible action."
