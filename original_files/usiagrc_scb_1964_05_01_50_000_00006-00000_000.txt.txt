J Thinclacls “SetTliree Records at Drake Relays

By Tom Fullmer

Three Grinnell College track
records, including one from
1935, were broken at the Drake
Relays last weekend. New rec
ords were set by Coach Young’
squad in the mile, distance
medley, and sprint medley ree
lays,

As a roaring crowd of 18,000
watched in Drake stadium Sat-
urday afternoon, Bruce Beck—
ord, with a tremendous kick,
caught and passed State Col-
lege of Iowa’s track quarter
miler Dave Suntken just before
the tape to give Grinnell a vice
tory in the Iowa College mile
relayl

Led by Beckord’s unofficial
147.9 quarter, the relay team of
Beckord, Ron Schachel, Jeri
Langham, and John TePaske
posted a 3:192 time. This put
to rest one of Grinnell's oldest
track records, a 3:195 set in
1935. But for a near fall by
Langham the time might have
been around 3:17.

That same quartet was also
responsible for two other rec-
ords being set. On Friday they
not only broke the existing rec-
ord for the distance medley
relay, they annihilated it. Fin-
ishlng fifth Grinnell posted a
time of 10:20.0 knocking 5.9
seconds off the old record. Led
by their great miler John Ca-
mien, Kansas State of Emporia
won the distance medley relay.

Then Saturday in an invita-

tional sprint medley relay,
which featured such great track
squads as Texas Southern and
Lamar Tech, Grinnell set a new
school record finishing fifth
with a time of 3:291}. The old
record of 15:30.1 was posted last
year. .
Beckord, Schachel, Toni De-
Berg, and Mike Dewitt ran a
1:30.!) for Grinnell in the Iowa
College half mile relay. In the
two mile relay a quartet com-
posed of Paul Patterson, Mac
Winholtz, Rod Brown. and
John Sutton turned in a clock-
ing of 8:06.01

Pleased with the efforts of his
team, Coach Dick Young noted
that the records set in the re»
lays are by no means safe as
much time remains in the out«
door season.

Grinnell College was given
the 1964 Drake Relays honor
award for colleges. Each year
such an award is given to a uni-
yersity and a college who have
had an outstanding record of
both parricipatiton and success
in the Relays.

The University of Michigan
Stadium in Ann Arbor can seat
100,100 spectators. more than
any other college stadium.
