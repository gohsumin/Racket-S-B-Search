rooted is the conviction, the fol-
iowing quotation tossed to me byl
a Ghana rcgionalist disciple in
the course of a long interview
with him, should reveal more
of what i have described above:

“Power is the most impor- l
tant thing in the world. It I
represents health, strength,
cleanliness, and generosity, as I
conspicuously as the want of
it is the very root of dirt,
weakness and iiisiiiccrit It
tortiiics men who have it in i
the same way in which it de— l
bases those who desire to get
it but are unable to reach it.
To these pcople it is only a ,
dream. I used to dream of ‘
power — I don't need to now
— all that is necessary is to
devise ways or maintaining
it."

Many are the conclusions I,
have deduced irom this. You Cani
turn in into whichever meaningl
you care to give it. You may
evcn contemplate it until you
drop. th the way of theoriz-
ing it is not the way ci prac-
tiring it. Days,‘ months, and cveiil
years go by and here we standl
