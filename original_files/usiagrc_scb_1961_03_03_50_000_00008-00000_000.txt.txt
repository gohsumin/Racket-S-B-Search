We leave the rest [or you lovelies to do.

A theory well known to all oi you,

That the boys ot ltawson would iilt up a me:

But in Smith it's conceit that you're likely to meet.

And the celibates ot South you'll have heard oi already
by word of mouth.

The inexperience oi East is not yet deceased

But tor boredom supreme call your WesL Norris dream;

The one phone in anles that’s worthy oi a ring.

Will only Saga Bob and his boys bring.

The dribble in Dibble is hardly worth a scribble.

lsut they not alone will make you poor mates,

For the youngsters oi North and the gamblers oi'ﬂzlles,

Can hardly be thought oi as making good dates.

when thinking at Women‘s Week one tigurcs to park,

But the iellas in Clark arc airnid oi the dark.
