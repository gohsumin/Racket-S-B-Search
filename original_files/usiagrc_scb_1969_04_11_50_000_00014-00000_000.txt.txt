and MOLLY McGUlRE

This week, in further consid-
eration of the ROTC issue, the
“Sid!” sent questionnaires to
most of the 38 ROTC members.
Specific questions were asked
concoming the relation of
ROTC to the cadet, his future
and the school. The following
information was compiled from
the answers of the 20 cadets
who responded.

40% of the 20 joined ROTC
to become commissioned offi-
cers, 20% to complete their

graduate work before serving
in the military. 10% to deiend
the United States, 10% to learn
to fly, 5% to gain good experi-
ence and 5% to rape, pillage,
and kill. When asked if they
would have joined it they had
known they would never be
drafted 55% said “no," 25%
said “yes,” and 20% were on
decided.

Beyond military preparation,
the cadets thought their ROTC
experience would be valuable
as leadership, management and
organization training, w o r k
with people, discipline, and in-

sight into civil-military rela-
tions, what is really happening
in the United State! and the
propaganda of the government.

In comparison of the quality
of ROTC courses to the other
courses they are taking, 65%
thought ROTC courses were
about equally difficult and
good, 10% thought they were
better, and 15% thought they
were not so good. when ques-
tioned about the consistency of
the ROTC program with the
liberal arts philosophy, all 20
of the members agreed that it
was consistent. They feel it is

allowed to express their opin-
ions freely. and question, criti<
cize and debate.

ROTC training relates to 80%
of their careers by providing
practical experience (lawyer,
pilot) and research opportu~
nities (chemist, psychologist).

All 20 of the cadets who an-
swered the questionnaire feel
that ROTC should retain course
Credit: few could spend the
time extracurriculariy because
of the heavy course load and
so the program could not sur-
vive without credit, Since it
will not lose its credits until
the fall of 1970, tha loss will
not be felt by the juniors and
seniors. The two sophomores
who returned the questionnaire
are going to remain in ROTC.

Drug Policy
Sights legality

At its April 8th meeting. the
Student Affairs Committee ap-
proved the distribution of B re.
vised statement on student use
of drugs. The statement will
be given to all students early
next week. As described in its
opening paragraph, the state-
ment “is an attempt to set
forth some basic facts and cur‘
rent concerns, describe some
of the drugs used and abused
by college students, express
the formal attitude of the COL
lege toward the problem. and
set forth a policy dealing with
it."

On the subject of existing
drug laws, the policy statement
says that ”while the existing
laws may be inadequate and
are often derided as unrealis-
tic and the product of society's
unnatural fears, these laws
must nevertheless be acknowl-
edged in any institution's plat-
form for dealing with situations
that arise. Offenses detected
among individuals on college
campuses are not always legal-
ly actionable, but users some-
times become linked with
sources of supply that are
criminal sources. . . . Federal
law prohibits sale of ampheta-
mines and barbituratw without
a doctor's prescription, or re-
filling of a prescription without
consent of the doctor. illegal
possession is not an offense
under federal law, but is an of-
fense under state and local
laws, including Iowa's."

“With certain knowledge of
the presence of or use of dnlgs,
law enforcement officers, with
a warrant, may enter and
search student rooms, seize
drugs, and make arrests, with
no obligation to notify college
officials except whatever is felt
necessary by way of courtesy
(lounges and other common-use
areas may be entered without
a warrant). When such action
takes place, college officials
may be faced with a difficult
conflict of responsibilities, but
are powerless to intervene, and
police have generally been pro-
ceeding without taking college

officials or anyone olu into

to tho Science building will
shield the View of the railroad
tracks and the biology green-
house, and will help to insure
privacy. A proposed mural,
planned for the south wall of the
science building may be seen
instead. A hilly effect Will be

The statement concludes with
an expression of college policy
in regard to student use of ii-
legal drugs. The college posi-
tion is that it cannot and will
not create a sanctuary for drug
users. Law enforcement agen~
cies have numerous method!
to identify users — although the
college has never supported
“entrapment" tactics, it feel:
they are a reality. Therefore,
students should inform them-
selves about the iegai as well
as other problems drug usage
may lead to, The college posi-
tion also, “encourages its stu-
dents to refrain from unprea
scribed or illegal use of drugs
and to avoid contributing to any
illusion of drama, excitement,
or myth about drugs.”

This revised statement ap.
pears, in part. as an attempt
by the committee to define the
relationship of the College with
outside law enforcement agen-
cies. In addition, the committee
has expressed its concern over
reports of increased drug use
on campus and hopes that this
statement, with the notable abs
sence of detailed and specified
procedures for the handling of
drug users by the College,
might provido a deterrent to
those now participating in till
illegal use of drugs,
