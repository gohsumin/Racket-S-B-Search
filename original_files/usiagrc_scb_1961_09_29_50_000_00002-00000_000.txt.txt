Some Answers . . . .

I have been asked to comment on the college’s admission
policy, especially with regard to two questions: Why was there a
signiiicant dect e in the proportion oi new students irom the
Atlantic states e.. from-24 per cent oi the new men and 18 per
cent oi the new women in the tall oi 1960, to 11 per cent and ti
per cent respectively, in the iall oi 1961?

Il admissions po icy looks to a wide geographical distribution
oi students. why is the proportion oi new students trom Iowa
about 25 per cent, and the proportion irom the Iowarlllinois area
about so per cent?

The basic iact regarding applications irom the Atlantic states
is this: the proportion ot' Atlantic states applicants representing the
“cream oi the crop" oi that section, in scholastic ability and in
talent, has been low relative to the proportions oi similar appli—
i-ants irom Iowa, Illinois and contiguous states.

This'is not to say that we tail to get numerous applicants
r, hin the high range oi ability and talent irom the Atlantic
states; but the proportion oi such applicants, measured against the
total oi all applicants irom that eastern area, has been relatively
low.

Ii we are to remedy this disparity, we must llavel a substan-
tially higher share oi the “cream oi the crop" oi Eastern secon-
dary schools. We can become more widely known as worthy
ci a substantially higher share, provided that our admissions
policy indicates what we seek. Temporarily, until our standards
and requirements are widely understood, the proportion oi new
students irom the Atlantic states will likely be lower than we
Lope/for in the long run.

why are the proportions oi new students irom Iowa and irom
the Iowa-Illinois area so high" The explanation largely is that
the college has long lived in t l area and his continually attract-
ed applicants at high scholastic ability.and talent irom this area.
The high proportions oi Iowa and Iowa—Illinois students grow
cut ol the relatively high volume oi applications inhcrent in the
college's history, location and reputation.

In addition, the college must maintain and cultivate its ties
with the communities irom which it derives its principal material
support and its historic good will. For that reason, among others,
we strive to encourage this high volume oi superior applications.

Over the years, moreover, the students irom Iowa, Illinois
cud contiguous states have proved themselves as capable as .those
irom elsewhere in contributing signiiicantly to the stature ot the
college and its nonprovincial character,

I should like to put my answers to the two questions in the

 

tontext of additional facts. First, whether we consider. geogrnplliml‘

distribution oi new students or other characteristics, proportions
(percentages) are otten subject to much accidental variation irom
year to year.

For example. the proportion oi new men irom Iowa was Is
per cent, and the proportion oi new women irom Iowa was lb
per cent. in the tail of 1961). Second, a desirable wide variety oi
characteristics in the student body depends on numerous iactors,
at which geographical distribution is one. These include distribu.
tions oi iamily income positions, nds ct community (urban,
suburban, rurall, parental occupations, academic interests and
achievement, extracurricular interests and participation, occllpih
tional interests and social interests,

Third, in terms oi these numerous jnctors; we have achieved

wide variety oi characteristics in the strident body, and we

1‘ ve accomplished this concurrently with a substantial impl‘n\'er.\

ment of scholastic ability and talent in the student body.

.1 . . . And Some Olher Answers

Dean Stiltlss' statement collcerllll :ltllni sions policy
marks an important step in the hives gallon of the admis-
sions question. It appears to tls that certain realities, un-
fortunate though they may seem, have to be accepted in
the policy, at least until someone comes up with a very
specific, and feasibly better plan.

The question which seems lundamental to the problem, i

”Are .the eastern schools in general-sending us tl lower

caliber student than Grinnell expects?" will be investigated‘

along with auxiliary questions by the admissions committee

of the SGA. What does come out of this initial statement

by the administration are some symptoms of confusion be-

Eetween those wllo make the policies and those wllo execute
lem.

We must be aware of the very difficult job the ads,

missions office has; however, we should not have to expect

ithat percentages will differ as much its five per cent be-:

tween the proposed geographical breakdown and its final
results. If an attempt was made to return the Iowa per-
centage to its expected high anti compensate for the former
low by turning down second-rate applicants from the East,
this may at least at this juncture appear reasonable.
What should not be overlooked. lion-eve . is the overs
compensation in the execution of the policl all efforts
should be made, and, we believe, now are being made, to
compensate, as it were, lor the over-compensation.

To the Editor

Each year when autumn comes‘gaingl the growing Colnnllmisl,‘

to Grinnell, the untrpl-eppmg‘
bore raises hts head and snails;
Huvuig done so for scvcral‘ sear
suns, I become ll'l‘ltable and dis
rout-aged, take to writing letters
to editors and almost lose sight
of the solid reason [or arguing
against such ioollshncss.

We lcnow these almost by
heart: the analogy which prev»
ping suggests between the halls
and Greek—letter tratcrnites is
misguided and misleading; the
,psychology upon which it is
lbused ~ that young lncu can
lsomehow be made more agree-
luble by subjecting thcln
,progrnm oi humiliationris false;
‘even prepping governed by
pietics about “orientation" allows
a more or less iree hand to up-
pel'class bullies and other trou-
bled souls. And so on. 1

Everybody has heard the l

arguments. The only new is- ,

sue, perhaps, is “voluntary
'pnrticipatlon," but I doubt that

anybody with any sense of ;
group pressures in a society is

fooled by that. ,
, But I ﬁnd lnyscli reacting
lagﬂinst prepping less and less for‘
such high-minded reasons, andl
more and more ior selfish rea-l

would hear about these things,
and prepping is, among other
things, simply corny, like the
squirrel tail on the radiator cap
and “Oh you kid" painted by
.the rumble seat ot the roadster.

Such jiggerypogery has come
to seem as oddly archaic as Rudy
