The recent controversy between the students
and the Administration is perhaps the most ser—
ious since President Bowen tool: office. it is more
crucial because the President is more directly
involved.

In a ivoi-,cl he has told the student govciii-
mcnt that they cannot change the rulcs. This
means that he has bccoinc the upholdcr oi the
status quo and that those who have been most
or ical or college social policy can no longer
consider President Bowen to lie‘ the adminis-
trative iigure who really understands their
position,

Whereas bciore, President Bowen was above
controversy between the students and the Ad-
ministration, he is now in the center of it Where-
as in the past hc has urged the students to govern
themselves and has declared his willingness to
let ”sensitive” isucs be dic sed frcely, he has
now taken a most risliv pos on. he. hiniscll has
virtually said “110'Y t0 the students.

CERTAINLY THE President of the College has
a right to say no. But when he says no, when
he runs counter to his 'past pronouncements, he
must expect rcsistance, and protest with an equal
degree of certainty. To avoid a serious crisis, it
would be advisable tor him to reconsider his
position.

Now lot us examine the issues which are
involved in the controversy. They are three:
establishing a balance of interests between the
students and the Administration: upholding the
autonomy ot the college; deciding what kind oi
college Grinncll ought to be,

THE FIRST: defining and balancing the ins
tcrcsts bctwcen the students and administration
is the most important of the three, Because stu-
dent government removes troni the college Iinan-
cial and administrative responsibility by its gov.
ernmental activities (hall government, social
planning, etc) it has a right to demand that
its interests be duly recognized. One of its in-
teicsls is formulating legislative policy which
they must cniorcc and which they and their
constituents ought to believe in.

THE SECOND ISSUE: is to what degree the

College will Iccl obligated, at best, to comprise,
and at worst to pander to the opinio -, attitudes
and demands oi the outside community. 0r inorc
important, what Will be the cost to the educa-
tional process and intellectual integrity of the
college.

This is an issuc because the Pl'eucloni. has
argued that the reputation of the College would
be deinangcd by changes in the rules. This is
especially true because the College's “moi-a1"
reputation is suttei-ing at the present time.

In terms of the whole College this issue has
the most lar reaching and significant implicate

tions.

Do we become a rctlcction or outside wishes,
attitudes and jpil‘ilons or do we insist that the
College is not going to sacriiice ts autonomy.
By doing the latter people get used to giving
the College money without expecting to inilucnce
it. Parents get used to sending their children
here without telling administiatois what rules
they must oi must have.

THE THIRD ISSUE is what hind 01 college
do we want? President Bowcn wants intellectual
nonmonformlly. In this sense he is a liberal and
progressive man, He has been courageous in de-
tending academic lrecdoin, He has not bowed to
the Red-baitcrs In this area he has excelled and
it is in this arca that the College has made the
most progress. '

On the other hand, he is at the same time a
social conservative l-lis morality and social plu-
losophy aie his own. He is trying to impose his
own personal standards on the personality oi
the campus The question is: is this duality ol
intellectual non-conformity but social conformity
possible for the College and, it it is possible,
is it desirable?

Now we come to the more diIlicult question
oi what kind at college the students want. Do
they want an authoritarian or aiia‘rchistio en—
vironment? Do they want authority or tree-
(10111? It they want a mixture, in what iii-o-
portions? The students have not given this
question adequate attention. They have not

taken the matter seriously.
Up to this point, we have assessed the his
poi-tance of the

present controversy, identiticcl

the mayor issues connected with it. What remains .
is to lind out why the controversy could develop
and how it is going to be resolved.

President Bowen asserted administrative
authority because of perceived pressure irom
outside sources and because cl his deeply iclt
ideals and values. He was ablc to teal free to do
so because at the tiuiidity, passivity, apathy and
lack of leadership demonstrated by the student
body.

THE APATHY is largely a product 01 either
indifference or emotional Withdraxl'al. Last year
involvement with the question of nuclear testing
drained many students of their concern, their
energy and tlicir willingness to hccome engaged.

lndiiterence has resulted primarily Ironi too
many students not caring about Grinnoll Col;
lege and/or not feeling they can do much to
bring about change. Another reason is that they
are not aware oi what is happening or what the
important issues really are.

To a lesser extent, academic pressure has
contributed to apathy and Indifference,

Indifference and apathy are. to some degree.
a product or inadequate student leadership.

Let us take the Student Government Asso-
ciation President and the President of the CotHP.
'Al Boston and Steve l-lowcll are, in many rc-
spects, creative, liberal and progressive thinkers.
They have had many constructive ideas and pro»
posals which they have attempted to implement

Why then have they tailed? They have failed
because they have addressed themselves to
select individnls and committees. Instead of
Iirst coining before the student body with their
proposals, they have gone to the administration.

For example, Howell spent seven weeks study-
ing 'the drinking rule, composed a lifleen page,
single-spaced analysis accompanied with recom-
mendations. Instead of coming before the student
body, to generate an issue, to foster discussion.
and to muster support, he went directly to the
Administration.

The President of the AWS Board, Donna Jo
Briley, went to Dr. Bowen, alter the women’s
governing board Iormulated a' modest plan for
studont-admiuistrntion clash
