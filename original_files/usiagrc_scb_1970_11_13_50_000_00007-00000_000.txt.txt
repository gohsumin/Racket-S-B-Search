decisionrmaking process of
the college.

He has also been involved in
ironing out the rough spots in
the Judicial Council proposal,
organizing the town clean-up
project, politicing for student
interests in the Great Faculty
Requirements Debate, and
generally managing to operate
the office with ”greater ef-
ficiency" (in Loewi‘s words)
than ever before. Studcntsare
encouraged to take advantage
of the service offered. There
are rumors to the effect that
an award is being offered to
the first student who comes
up with a problem Vranimr
can't solve.

Bill Thomas and Mary Broo-
ner of CHP’AWS have been
active in mostoftheprcviousr
ly mentioned activitiesas well
as conducting a series of dis-
cussions in each dorm with
the RA, SAs and House Pre-
sident. Thomas reports that
the meetings have been suc-
cessful in pinpointing and ane
alyzing dorm problems and in
developing ideas for dorm
activities. The discussions,
currently going on, are sch-
eduled for completion next

week.

The SGA cabinet officers
have also been conductingdin-
ner meetings with non-SGA
students in an attempt to dis-
cover whatproblems thereare
in communication between
SGA and the student body, and
other difficulties on the cam-
pus as well. This is some

thing of an experiment, since
student government has in the
past tended toavoid close con-
tact with the students themr
selves. So for nothing catas-
trophic has happened, how»
ever, and Loewi reports that
the meetings will be contin-
ued.

ble outlets of frustration at
Grinnell College, the Scarlet

ly attending this college. A

(continued from page 4)

Birth control information and
counseling can be obtained in
the Women‘s Liberation Of‘
fice, located downstairs in
the Forum, on Mondays 7-9
and Thursdays 3—5. The group
would like to see the college
set up a Birth Control Clinic
on campus by next year to
provide Grinnell women with

a- service they feel is benefi-
cial to the physical and psy—
chological well-being of the
college community.

Women's Liberation in Grin-
nell feels that the greatest
need for emphasis lies in in-
forming the campus of the grr
ievances WL is voicing. The
Women's Liberation hopes
that this edumtion will en-
courage both students and fa-
culty to become interestedand
involved in the movement and
its ideals.

STEPHEN DISCUSSES relevant trips ~81)

(continued from page 2)

He has taken Lsd more than
two hundred times, but it took
him a long time to be able to
look at his trips and realize
that "they are not random",
and do contain a message.
Now, Stephen discourages the
use of chemicals ., he belie-
ves that ”if you take acid
once, you have more than en-
ough to work with, and you
can not continually expect
”miracle" experiences from
the universe. He encourages
his followers to use only or-
ganics -- grass, mushrooms,
and peyote. "Psychedelics",
he said, "are like a rocket
ship; organics are like an ox

cart. Eut town's only five
miles away and you can get
there by walking."

“Getting there by walking",
or “being stoned spiritually"
is basic to Stephen's whole
theology; being stoned is
really getting your mind into
a state where it can communi-
cate telepathimlly with other
minds, including God's.

Communication of minds is
really, at least in theory, the
ultimate experience to Stephen
and his followers. Communi-
cation, or the direction of hu—
man attention on anyone or
anything is “human energy,"
and the only thing that can ‘
cause the greatest satisfac-
tion to the individual and can
cause good things ,_ “things
mat prosper" -- to happen
on earth. To help out the na—
ture of the universe , which,
incidentally is God, since Ste-
phen is a pantheist - all one
needs to do is decide with his
free will to apply hisattention
to a problem.

Stephen and his troupe left
Grinnell last Tuesday night,
and headed for Iowa City, Mi-
chigan, Ohio, and the East
Coast. They will return to
California early next year,
there to settle down into a
commune in the San FranciSr
co area, and to continue to
feel vibrations, to get stoned,
and to create human energy
through human attention.
