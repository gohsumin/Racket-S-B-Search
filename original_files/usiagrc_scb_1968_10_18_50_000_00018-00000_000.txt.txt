Sports Editorial

By JEFFREY SCHECKTER

The construction of the new, badly needed mum-million dollar
athletlo nomplex will undoubtedly push Grlnnell into a new era
of athletics, at least in the area of physical structures. The largest
segment of Grinnell “athletes,” thoserwha participate in intra-
mural sports, Will gain less than do the varsity teams.

Although exact figures are hard to assemble, approximately
10% or more of the male student body participates in LM. sporu
during the four years here On the other hand, only twenty or
25% are actually involved in intercollegiate, varsity athletic evenm,
Therefore, it is evident than an athletic department at Grinneil
should concentrate at least part of its time and effort on I.M.
sports. No one will deny that pmper training. conditioning, coach-
ing, and equipment are necessary to field a competitive varsity
team. This, of course. takes a great deal of time and expense,
subtracting from the amount available for [M sports.

The current intramural football season is a primary example
of just how unguided the 1M. system is There are ten LM. foot-
ball teams, one from each dorm and the off-campus squad. This
totals about 140 players, or almost three times as many LM.
players as there are on the Ireshman and varsity teams combined.

In spite of the fact that so many students are involved, 1
have never seen any member of the amletic department near a
game. Nor is there any help or aid available to a team.

The true LM. football gama is played by men equipped only
with a few helmets, in an extremely poor state of repair, and
generally lacking in fundamentals or conditioning. Each game has
two student referees with little knowledge of the rules and a tlml~
keeper, usually some trapped spectator. No equipment or medical
aids are available from Darby nor is any person competent in
first aid present

Injuries are common occurrences during I.M. games. They
‘nin from cuts and muscle strains to torn ligaments, shoulder sep-
arationsdnd broken bones. A varsity football player, injured in
a game or practice, has the benefit of prompt attention and tho
whirlpool bath and first aid room at Darby. The Ier football
player is left to his own devices — or those of tho lnfirmary.

It is useless to condemn the present system without offering
another. I therefore propose that the intramural football system
be scrapped entirely or, more realistically, be put under partial
guidance of the athletic department. Good equipment. at least
good helmets, should be made available to all who request them.
One of the referees should be a coach or someone who has
been trained to detect the dangerous infractions of the rules
'which, at present, go on incessantly. in addition, each team should
be able to meet with the coaching staff or a coach to cover the
fundamentals important to safe football.

Without a change in the present LM, system, particularly
football, it is highly likely that a great many more serious in-
juries will occur. It is hazardous and senseless for anyone to con-
tinue to play l.M. sports in their present disorganized manner.
While we are spending money to elevate our stars —- how about
a little something for the common man?

GRINNELL’S
FIRST GAME

Won From lows: in
First Football Game

West of Mississippi
November is, lsli

In 1889, twenty-three years
ago. Grinnell won the first in-
tercollegiate Rugby football
game ever played west of the
Mississippi River. Iowa State
University was the victim, 5?‘
ing down to a twentysfotlr to
nothing defeat. In the following
year two games were played,
one with Iowa which resulted
in a victory for Grinnell and
the other with Minnesota which
was won by the Gophers. In
1891, three games were played,
Iowa was defeated, Minnesota
tied at Gn‘nnell, but the Gophers
were able to defeat the Scarlet
and Black at Minneapolis,

Until 1894, the state Chaim
pionship was held by Grinnell.
but in that year Iowa was able
to wrest away the laurels. Dur-
ing the remainder of the decade
Grinnell and Iowa were the
chief contenders for the honors,
with successes equally divided
between them. During the time
when football was in its infan-
cy Grinnell played such teams
as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Amos,
Missouri, Nebraska, Rush Med-
ical and 'others of equal prom-
lnence.

freshman Team Beats Knox 34-20

By KRISTI SCHMITT

The freshmen Pioneers kept
alive s newly—originated winning
tradition by defeating Knox 34.
20 last Friday at Galesburg.
It was the fifth consecutive will
in the last two seasons for the
spunky freshmen

Although Knox was a larger
team in both number and size
(Knox suiting 50 players to our
15), the young Pioneers dealt
them a fierce battle. The team
led in the first quarter and
shocked Knox with two quick
touchdowns, one on a fast
pass to Ed Hizsh and the
other on a Flair pass or
Henry Corona. The next score in
the second period came at the
end of a masterquy engineered
drive by quarterback Bill Dicks
on a sneak from the one yard
line.

The next scoring drive, aid-
ed by the strong arm of Dickl
and his excellent receivers
Jim Plrolll and Ed l-lirsb, was
gained with a quick dive by
fullback Al Hammond from the
one.

Ths defense was spectacular
for the Pioneers in the
first half, with key intercep-
tions by Jim Pirolll and co-
captain Mario Bognanno, whose
interception was returned on a
dazzling run of 7.0 yards. The
defensive stalwarts included
the entire defensive line con-
sisting of Ed Hirsh, Bill Wright,
Doug Watts, Al Hammond and
Scott Hanson. Backing up these
impregnablo five are Mario
Bognanno and Chuck McCeuley.

At the end of the first half,
the Pioneers through their
great aggressive play mistaken-
ly let a deep receiver slip by
and a resulting score occurred.
This was almost too much for
the angry Pioneers, so Knox‘s

'attempt for the point was sty-

mied by the onrush of the entire
defensive line. The score at the
half was Grinnell 28 and Knox
8i

With 30 minutes already un-
der their belts, the Pioneers
charged out on the gridiron

for the second half. But as till
time clicked by almost too
slowly, the sparsely numbered
Pioneer team began to wear
down. In their self-dem-
mined way, they held the re.
latively fresh Knox squad to
minimal yardage and exhibited
great ball control. With the of.
fence being directed by bill
Dicks and the defense by cap-
tains Mario Bognanno and Dave
Cassel, the Pioneers gutted out
the third quarter without or
lowing a touchdown from Knox.
The Pioneers scored still anotha
er touchdown on a pinpoint
pass rifled from quarterback
Dicks to Surehanded Ed l-lirsh.

The fourth quarter was a try-
ing one, with injuries hamperin
the Pioneer squad. Corona a
Bugnanno were out because of
leg injuries, and Wright was
sidelined because of a blow in
the side. With till! great did all- ’
ministered by the Pioneer trahv
or Fat Sam, Wright and Bognan:
no were able to continue action.
Corona, sustaining an injury
that could be serious, sat out tho
rest of the game in hopes he
could recuperate in time to face
Coe at home Oct. 25.

Knox took advantage of this
misfortune on the part of the
Grinneli team to score two
touchdowns in the last period
to raise their standing to mat.
with sheer determination, the
Fmsh held out and the gem.
ended in victory, 34—20.
