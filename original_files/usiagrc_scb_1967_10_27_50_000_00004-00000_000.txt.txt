A PERSONAL LETTER
FROM THE PROTEST AT MADISON

The (allowing is a letter re-
ceived by Cathie Brunet from
her sister, a student at the
University of Wisconsin.

Saturday Oct. 11

. i .I’m trying to get my mind
on of what has been happening
here tor the last tew days—
have you heard about it at all?
Wednesday a peaceful demon-
stration supporting peacetul ob-
struction (obstruction of Dow
Chemical interviews of prospec-
tive employees (students) in the
Commerce Building on campus
-—Dow makes napalm; 85 per-
cent at its business is War and
the University allows it lacil-
ilies, etc. on campus for inter-
viewing and recruiting students,
that is, the University, by giving
these corporations classroom
space etc, is giving tacit ap<
proval and aid to the war ei—
fort) in the hall outside the
interview rooms was awaiting
promised negotiation with the
University chancellor and Dean
Kaufman. Allan and I were
obstructing, that is, committing
civil disobedience, and were
liable to arrest, expecting ar-
rest and prepared lor arrest—
along with about zoo other peacea
tul obstmctionists awaiting
peacernl arrest. There were
about 400 supporting pickets and
approximately 2500 innocent oh-
servers outside—the demonstra-
tion had been publicized, and
was expected, University police
were inside with the demon-
strators, two in from of every
Classroom door, etc. Madison
police, Called in by the Chancel-
lor in case of trouble about
noon, waited in the Bascom
parking lot. I had been there
since about 11 am, picketing
until about 12:30, then joined
Allan sitting on the ﬂoor ub—
structing. The Madison police
numbered about 35, were
wearing riot helmets, carrying
twotoot nightsticks, and putting
on gas masks (for tear gas)
last 1 heard. They moved to-
ward Commerce, we were told
(about 1:30 p.m.). We didn’t:
know which door they would
come in. We were expecting
the Chancellor and the Dean to
arrive to negotiate. The police
entered the opposite door from
the one we were nearest to; we
really couldn't tell until we saw
Iheir sucks flying and heard the
sound or heads being cracked
open and heard screamsﬁglrls.
boys, kids on their way to class
who were picking their way thru
the absolutely dense obstruction-
ists Sitting with arms linked
on the ﬂoor. The kids were about
3 across in the hall and 35 pc—
lice came at them with clubs
swingingichaos broke loose—
girls in my area were to move
back, the men shoved forward
to get the poiice—it was iutile.
pickets moved out and we got
out, near hysterics—l getting
more so as Allan did not ap<
pear—at last he did—the build-
ing was cleared in 12 minutes.
do : 69 in the hospital, 5 pt»
lice, 34 students—the police hit
a big male student with enough
dares to knock him down, hit
him again and then cracked a
nearby girl with the same [arise
from the back on the back of
“to hood—n prolessor who was

on the stairs, reported, and
then tied. Ambulances were not
called, students were hysterical
—l was out of my mind—When?
When? when have I ever seen
such a thing? innocent kids,
girls, anybody! ANYBODY near
just smack them! The wounded
were slowly gotten thru the
crowd and into private cars
The police tried to move away
trom the building (they had
smashed the gloss oi the doors
to get in because it had been
so tightly packed.) The crowd
would not let them advance—
we screamed Obscenities, sobbed
I spat as did others, we hit or
triedimore were knocked down
~the innocent bystanders—2500
or them—began also. Prolessor
Zeitland tried to talk—“stop you
crazy kids stop”—he was pushed
against the police and beaten
by themérhe crowd started to
scream Siek Heile etc. The god-
damned fascists. POLICE BRU»
TALITYI Cathie! I had never
believed it but my God! Cum-
pletely unwarranted! I was
crazy, shaking, screaming, cry«
ing, hugging those who tell
back — WHAT TO DO? The
police were scared i guess,
judged a riot situation to
have developed and so began
the iirst barrage or tear gas—
What horrid stuttl We ran des-
perately choking, burning, cry-
ing and blinded—thousands run
ning helterrskelter away down
the hill—who was Crushed » who
trampled? Then the crowd
surged back. The police or-
rested 5 and put them in tho
paddy wagon. They had not
gone in with the intent to
arrest (we were expecting
arrest); the chancellor had
given the order to clear the
building with force if nec-
essary~no arrests. Kids now
surged back to the paddy wagon
and began to let the air out
of its tires and blocked its exit
from Bascom. The police were
again hemmed in, again the
crowd chanted and yelled—more
blood, more gore and another
barrage or tear gas, then an-
otherithe business went on for
hours. Some kid got up on top
of Basconi and cut down the
American ﬂag—more gas. . . r
We finally (Allan and I) left as
it went on toward tour. Thirteen
students have been suspended
--OI‘ so it says in the papers,
no one has been notiiied yet
— but a group went to confer
with the Chancellor at about
noon. Their names were an—
nounced as the “ring leaders"
of the riot at a {acuity meeting

sued for the arrest of nine,
nobody knows who but we
can guess. Stewie is certainly
one of them and he walks
scared, knowing that anytime
he could be picked up—one
doesn’t worry about being or-
rested; it’s the beating on the
way to jail, it’s true Cath—l
never would have believed it—

night-they sat outside in the

cold. ay- Thursday already so
much had been forgotten—pro
iessors refused to let strikers
say something to classes even
beiore the starting bell ~ even
ieiiow students buzzed “They
got what they deservedrr.”
Friday I couldn't face another
picket line and headed out to do
errandsatverywhere I heard the
same thing i thought on the
beltline, turned on Midvale, and
sobbed on University Avenue.
What are we going to do? I
don’t know what’s happening in
Washington. I'm scared, We
were going to go but there's
enough to do here. Alan and
Susan, also Norma are there.
I pray that they’re sale. This is
all terribly simpliiied — the
bigger issues I have not gotten
to ~ the incidents of Police
Brutality has clouded all here‘
— the real issue of University.

of the show that we needed
donations,”

Giddins told the 5&3 that, al-
though it was against adminis-
trative policy to collect dona-
tions at school sponsored tune
tions, he agreed to let the
troupe take a collection

Rumors circulated Saturday
that the troupe needed money
for the “31000 damage they
caused on the stage at Iowa
City.”

An 5&3 inquiry at the Uni
versity of Iowa round the ru-
mors totally unfoundedr

The Mime Troupe said they
gave up a $1000 pertormance at
Mt. Vernon, 1a,, to come to
Grinnell.

They received some irom the
university or lowa ior two
scheduled performances,

The Social Coordinating Com-
mittee iinally gave the troupe
$300 instead til the contracted
amount at $150.

“We’re sorry it happened,"
Cohon told a group at Ex Loco
Parentis, the off-campus coffee-
house, “and we’d like to come
back. I wanted very badly to
come to Grinneil to play our
show. We just think we were
cheated."

"The rumor is the troupe is
$20,000 in debt," Glddins said
Thursday night “I don’t want
them back, and I think they
were trying to put the screws
into us tor more money.”

“They were just trying to
take us," Miss oentel concluded.

The Mime Troupe pertormed
a modltled version or Carlo
Goldoni’s L’Amant Mililalre, B
"commedia dell’arte” satire re-
directed against the Vietnam
War.

The show began at 8:30 pm
—“The fastest time we ever
made,” mused Cohon.

Prldoy. October 27, I'M!
