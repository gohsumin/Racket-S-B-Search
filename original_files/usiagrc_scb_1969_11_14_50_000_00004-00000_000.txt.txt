By Sally Moore

A new woman is being born.

She will no longer accept the
patronizing, condescending, fa-
therly, protective, superior ate
titude of men.

She demands recognition as
an equal and whole human be-
ing with her own opinions, feel-
ings, interests, talents, abilities,
capabilities, and potential for
development

She will no longer look upon
her education as preparation for
becoming a "good wife and mo
ther" any more than man looks

upon his education as prepara-
tion for becoming a “good hus-
band and father,”

She demands her education to
be accepted as a means to dis-
cover and pursue her talents
and interests—not as a means
to discover and pursue arhus-
band, following his career and
sacrificing her own.

She will no longer sacrifice
herself to be society’s maid,
cleaning woman, cool-r, dish-
washer, laundressithe built-in
housekeeper.

She demands that men share
equally in the chores and dirty
work.

She will no longer accept the
main responsibility for raising
Children—as the built-in babysitv
tor—staying at home, changing
diapers. wiping up food and
juice, keeping up with toys, re-

iereeing arguments, reading
children's books, chauffeuring
children over town: forced [U
live in the world of children,
forced to neglect her develop»
ment as an adult human being.

She demands that men share
equally in the trustrations, and
occasional pleasures, of the de-
manding and nerve-wracking re»
Sponsibility of raising children.

She will no longer raise chil-
dren programmed for the tradie
tlonal, circumscribed and nar
row roles of male and female.

She Will raise her children as
free individuals.

She will refute the need of wo~
man as homemakerahousewlle,
propagated by proﬁt-hungry
manufacturers, which keeps
millions of women at home end-
lessly cleaning and home decor-
ating, isolated from the intelli—

low their own careers, (From a
very early age children need
the stimulation of a carefully
planned learning environment,
the stimulation of being with
other children, and the wise
guidance of a teacher trained
in child development)

She will no longer be forced
to have children she does not
want.

She will, as a free person, de-
mand control over her own
body.

She will demand that enough
money be spent on research
to discover a safe and effective
birth control method.

She will demand that archaic,
oppressive, man-made abor»
tion laws be repealed and that
abortion be made a decision be-
tween a woman and her doctor.

She will refuse to be a manne-
quin for the cosmetic, hair-
styling, loundation, and fashion
industries which prey upon the
insecurities of men and women,
especially those of women.

She will no longer degrade
herself by spending her time
and money trying to match
some common stereotype of fe-
minine beauty.

She will learn the freedom,
security, and relief that comes
from accepting one's natural
self.

She will no longer participate
in or support beauty contests.

She will demand an end to
this practice which holds women
in contempt, parading them as
objects to be ogled at.
