Jim Young to Teach Karate Class.
Encourages Sport as Carry-over

By Kris Nash

One of Grinnell's thorniest
problems in recent years has
been the physical education res
quirement—but Jim Young has
the answer. His karate class
provides a swift, agile; and
healthful solution for students
who are stumped over the se-
lection of a worthwhile carry-

»over sport. Karate is a practi-
cal means of self—defense for
both men and women, as well
as supplying an interesting
means of earning either a ma~
jar or a minor in physical edu»
cation.

Young began teaching this
particular brand of self-defense
during his freshman year, when
he teamed with a jujitsu in-
structor to give lessons to bond
students and local residents.
Young, a “brVWn belt” then,
has advanced to "black-belt,"
which is the highest color-rank
which a karate man may
achieve. There are six progres
sive levels of skill in the “black
belt" classification, each of
which requires about four
years of active training and
preparation before advance-
ment.

Participation in
has been rewarding, with
Young’s dropout percentage
running far below the adver-
tised national percentage. Cur-
rently there are four students
who have fulfilled the require-
ments for a karate major and
are taking even further instruc-
tion —— Steve Chandler, Don
Dietrich, Jim Fox, and Peggy
Gerber. Although the karate
students often are regarded as‘
a group who are being taught
rough, dirty tactics, Young
stresses that this is not the
case.

He points out that half of his
beginning class is usually made
up of girls. Though many of
them drop out before Complet—
ing any requirement, Miss Ger-
ber is an example of what can
he achieved. Young emphasizes,
for students who are leery, that
there are surprisingly few ser--
ious injuries suffered in the
sport. The Grinnell karate class
has never had a serious injury.

The origin of karate was
based in China, at least 600
years ago. It is thought to have
been developed by a group of
itinerant Buddhist monks as a
means of protection against
robbers who frequented the

the class'

 

roads in those days. The study

of karate next grew widespread
in Okinawa, following the de-
cree of an Okinawan warlord
that people were to be forbid—
den the use of weapons. There
are some styles of karate exist-
ing in Which the barehanded
practitioners train to take on
armed opponents

Although most uninformed
people automatically associate
karate with Japan, the Japan
ese did not practice it until
1917r It was in Japan, however,
that karate first began acquir
ing the sporting characteristics
which distinguish it today.
The Japanese were the first to
practice together; previously,
karate had been something at
w hi c 11 individual devotees
trained alone. Japan put karate
on a generally more scientiﬁc
basis, and Korea and China
have followed its lead.

Karate places its emphasis
on the use of punches and kicks
as the means of defense. Most
other forms of the weaponless
self-defense arts stress throw-
ing an adversary, such as in
"aikido," where maneuvers
cannot be executed without use
of the opponent’s momentum.
Jujitsu also relies chiefly on
throwing the competitor, as
does judo, which is the sport-
ing modification of original
jujitsu. .

Th e style which Young
teaches is that of the Japan
Karate Association, a style
which he is convinced is the
best. Having observed aikldo'
judo, Korean karate, and prac~
thlEd them to an extent, the
slight senior expresses definite
preference for the I. K. A.
brand of defense. The Japan
Karate Association is one of
the largest organizations in Jar
pan, and the only group sanc—
tioned by the Japan Ministry of
Education to teach karate in
foreign lands. Japan Karate
Association style of defense
employs linear blocking and!
punching movements, and is‘
based upon “kime,” which is
the precise focusing of a per»
son's entire strength into one
small striking a'rea.

Young first began his train-
ing in Hawaii, where he was a
pupil of Kanazawa, twice the
all-Japan champion in both the.
“forms" and iree~combat d1"
visions of competition karate.
He was initially forced to e -

enrolled in a class of 200, To-
day there are ten times as
many people studying karate
in Hawaii. After working .up to
the "brown belt“ level in the
islands, Young trained for an
additional one and one-half
years before achieving “black
belt“ standing. He qualified as
a first-level “black belt“ in
Philadelphia during Christmas
vacation of his sophomore year,
though he did not actually re-
ceive the belt until the follow—
ing summeri

The blond senior plans to do
graduate study in electrical en-
gineering at the University of
Arizona or the University of
Michigan, then perhaps acquire
3 Ph. D. after working a year.
He eventually hopes to return
to Hawaii to work. There he
will be able to continue his
training in karate, as well as
in Japanese archery, in which
he holds a “brown belt” equiv-
alent.

For his final semester at
Grinnell, Young has planned a
training schedule which will
provide helpful intermingling of
advanced, intermediate, and
beginning Classes while at the
same time allowing adequate
time {or necessary individual
