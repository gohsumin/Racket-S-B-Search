'Giass Menagerie' Brilliant;
’ Steiner's Cast Rates Praise

By BRUCE MCCONASHIE

”The Glass Menagerie" opened
Tuesday night to a toll house in
the Arena Theatre. The enact-
ment at Tennessee Williams' mo-

dern classic fully merited the [re
mendous reception given it by the
Grinnell audience. l-ieniy - York
Steiner’s (English) direction or the
play was often subtle and imagin-
atlve,

The play began at a last pace——
tun last, I fell, for the audience
to achieve an emphatic under-
standing of the action. The acting
throughout the (list part was good
but one was never really allowed
to become deeply involved in the
pathos of each character’: situa-
tion. Thus some parts of the play
seemed more comic than Wil-
liams probably intended them. Cab
tainly the scene between Tom and
Laura after Torn comes home
from a night or drinking is funny.
But one laughs, ithink, on the
wrong side of one's race. Aman-
da‘s “rise and Shine," is comedy
with a pathetic note.

Pace Slowed

The pace slowed down atter in.
termlssion and we were given
richer and more subtle characteris
zation. The action rose smoothly
to the ClimaXvihe scene between
Laura and the gentleman caller—
and we experienced a tremendous
sense of loss at Laura's disillus-
ionment. Tom's poetic ending leit
its with a Vivid impression of the
oppressive sorrow ielt by all the
characters.

Certainly the most effective as-
pect of the production, besides the
acting, was the music. The nos-
talgic (one could almost say
“camp") jazz train the dance hall
and Laura's record player went

 

far toward establishing the domin-
ant mood of the play.

Yet i was puzzled by other or
Steiner's technical effects. The
sign over the lire escape seemed
gimmicky and superfluous. At
times, the illumination DI the pic-
ture ot the father distracted from
the play. The lights were a hit
too dim during some scenes but
the lighting of other scenes was
superb, particularly the scene be-
tween Laura and the gentleman
callers

Bothered by Set

i was bothered by the set.
While it may be argued that the
baseboards deiine the acting area
much more clearly than the lights
ever could. I see no reason to
erect wooden rods between the
floor Ind ceiling to define wall
space. In hisjirst narrative speech
Tom says that this play will give
us the “reallty of illusion." Both
the baseboards and the wooden
rods push the play toward the “il-
lusion or reality."

But this is quibbling, Such minor
detects become practically insig-
niticant when compared to the ef-
fectiveness of the acting. Steiner
must be applauded tor his excel~
lence in casting. The physical
characteristics and voice qualities
at each actor seemed to match
perfectly the role that each por-
trayed.

Ken Hicks gave us a suit-spoken,
sensitive Tom. I would have liked
to have seen more bitterness and
frustration in his interpretation of
the role; however, Ken's quick,
nervous movements eliectively dis-
played Tom‘s uncomfortable situa-
tion. On the Whole, an admirable
performance.

Roosevelt U. Newspaper Stall Quits;
Administration Moves Cause Rebellion

The Roosevelt Torch. newspaper
of Roosevelt University, Chicago,
lllinois, has suspended operations
due to animosities between its
stall and the administration.

The incident which touched off
the suspension was an "arbitrary"
decision by the University Control-
ler to refuse the staff permission
to stay late in the building com-
posing their issue on a Friday
night. The start was pushing it~
selt to complete a twenty - eight
page paper by Friday night and
had already stayed in the building
until midnight and 1:00 am. on
previous nights.

However, on Friday night alter
the staff refused to leave at 10:30
and permission had not been
granted {or them to remain, a po-
lice escort was sent by the admin-
istration to evacuate them, The

staff was escorted out and conse-
quently the paper was not coni-
pleted until Saturday night.

The Torch stall became in-
censed to such a degree that they
will not publish the paper unless
the administration meets these
demands: (1) The editor, business
manager, and production manager
selected by the staff; (2) a for-
mal judicial system be established
for processmg grievances against
the Tamil; (3) the Torch be al-
luwed access to all administrative
and iaculty committees and all
University documents be opened
tor paper's inspection; (4) that
the Torch eventually become com-
pletely autonomous from the Ulti-
versity through a corporation; and
(5) that only the student govern»
ment have the authority to ap-
prove Torch deticit and repayment
plans.

play. Karyn Zimmerman did an
outstanding job in this key role,
Her characterization, especially in
the second part, was nearly excel-
lent. Every voice inilection, every
gesture was right. I felt that her
action throughout was well motivat-
ed and thus, finally, depressingly
believable. Karyn’s ettecilveness
was aided by excellent costuining.
A heavy maroon sweater hanging
loosely trom her shoulders poign-
antly clashed with her southern-
belle airs.

Debbie Abbott, who portrayed
Laura, gave an effective charac-
terization of a terribly shy per-
son. Especially noteworthy, I
think. is her good sense or tim-
ing. Perhaps Laura's nervousness
was overacted in a few placer,
but never to the extent that she
became unbelievable. _‘

The part of Jim, the gentleman
caller, was played by Chuck
Bums. I agree with Chuck's inteF
pretatlon of this role: Jim is I
nice guy but he's also a jerk.
Chuck handled his part easily and,
with the exception of when he
kissed Laura, his performance
was quite good.

I thank Steiner. his cast and his
hardworking crew tor an- enjoy-/
able night at the theatre. A Broad-
way critic might have called the
performance “brilliant and com-
pelling): So do i.
