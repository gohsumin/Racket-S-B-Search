IMS Reviewed

It was a great week for lM's
last week. Read continues to
lead the league with a 33>3
record, but Clark slipped to
third as the Profs continue to
rally as the end of the semesr
ter draws near. They are in
second with a 23-7 record.
The Smithies are in fourth,
Westites in fifth,andthe Loose
lovelies amass in sixth. East
leads the league from the
bottom side with an 0- 33 re-
cord. The participation has
increased a great deal, the
1M heads report, as the num-
ber of forfeits is decreasing.

1M Bowling was the highlight
of the year as the one‘day
season saw Clark take the
team championship with 2,136
pins. Second place was Cow-
les, third Haines. Members of
the winning team were Striker
Perolli, Splits Schoene, Gut
ters labowitz, Turkey Dicks,
and Spares Gordon. The indi—
vidual three-gme total win-
ner was Pirolll, with a 521
total. Second place was
Smith's Wheat, 509.Thirdwas

Cowle's (hishing in a tie with
Clark's Gordon at 504. Read's
Hanse was fifth, Smith's Gil-
bert was sixth, Cowles' Stein
eight, West's Horwitz was
ninth, and Haines’ Buchanan
was tenth.

The high game was rolled by
Al Wheat, 194. The low was
Horowity of Haines, 69.

This tourney was labeled a
success as all but two teams
were of a full contingent. 0C
did not show as they were off-
mmpus somewhere else. The
only complaint was that ‘in
some halls more peoplewanb
ed to play but the teams were
full. The DA officials regretted
this and wish they would have
been made aware of this be-
fore the tournament.

'N Swimming started last
Sunday. My only complaint
might be -- how about some
events for nonrswimmers7
Perhaps a P] relay7 Anyway,
good luck to all the entrants,
and let's fire up over in East

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

BB Toom looks For Better Year

This year looks to be rather

a better one for the Pioneers'
basketball team than for the
football team. In spite of the
fact that the basketball team
had only a mediocre perfor-
mance last year, with a lot of
disappointments and games
lost that should have been
won, this year's team looks
good.

With at least four regulars
back from last year in Greg
”the Bomber" Bombinski,
Greg "Fuzz Cuz" Beckman,
Gorgeous Cary Johnson, and
Bob "Touch" Burnett (when
he gets back from his Semes~
ter Away From Grinnell,
Goofing Off Program next
January), the Hoopsters will
have a strong nucleus of good
boll handlers and big boards
men around which to mold a
fine team. Adding depth to this
nice nucleus of netmen are
such newcomers as Joe
"Kraut" Kraut, at guard, the
Animal Mark Meyer and bon-

yney Bruce Bonnewell at for—

ward positions, and, serving
double duty as a ball man and
board-banger, Winner Wends
ell Taylor. In keepingwith this
upsurge of Grinnell athletic
fortunes, Coach Pfitchhas de-
veloped a new exercise known
as the Grinnell Swing. I'll save

a definition of this facet ofthe
Grinnell Experience for a la‘
ter date.

The basketballseason opened
with a tuneup at Millikin Unis
versity on December 1; then
Grinnell goes to Central on
the 5th. Things begin to get
serious at the Holiday Tourr
nament at Colorado on the
29th. Quite frankly, unless
the Pioneers get upset by their
bitter rivals, Knox, they sh-
ould come away with the chr
amplonship. Grinnell’s league
season opens in the hallowed
confines of Darby Gymnasium
against Cornell on the 9th of
january. Grinnell's firsthome
game after the spring semes-
ter starts, however, is not
until February 5, against St.
Olaf. ’ '

Grinnell is sufficiently im-
proved over last year, with
more depth, strong backcourt
men, and a conceivably t0tally
dominant corps in the fore
court, that the Pioneers should
do quite well against the lear
gue. It is, indeed, within the
realm of possibilitythatGrin~
nell could finish the season on
top of the heap. The players
have a high morale, they're
up for the season, they will
win a large number of games.
