SHARE TOILET
WITH 6.12 GIRLS?

by the Sims
Do—lt-Yoursell Editor

The most obvious problem tac-
lng Buildings and Grounds when
they prepare North Campus
hall for women will be the bath-
room situation. Those urinals
have got to go.

And go they will — this sum-
mer. In an exclusive interview
with the $813, E3111 head Dale
Hawn said that the urinals will
be taken alt the walls, and the
two-inch pipes plugged "All
the girls Will see is a metal
plate covering the wall where
the pipes were," explained
Hawn.

But now comes the crucial
question — will there be enough
toilets? According to Mr. Hawii,
an institutional iacility that does
not have “peak times or usage”
requires one milet ior every
iiitcen women (An oitice build-
ing where coltee breaks or
lunch breaks are taken by all
women at the same time would
need more, but a college dorm,

where women are eating and
sleeping on more irregular
schedules does not have petal-r
times).

it is comiorting to know that
this 15-1 limit is not even up
preached. At the worst, there
will be 7.12 women per toilet.
This number seems more than
reasonable to Mr. l-laWn, and
to Mr. Pomerenk, the Director
of Residences

But — Dean Low wants more
toilets! She wants a toilet for
every tour girls. Well, aside
from being unnecessary, this
added plumbing would be cost-
ly.

For reasons that cannot be
adequately discussed in a iaml»
ly newspaper such as this, a
two-lnch urinal pipe cannot op-
erate a toilet. So, explained Mr.
Hawn, the walls would have to
he ripped open, tour inch pipes
installed, and the walls closed.
This would Come to about $3,500
per toilet.

And you thought the reception
center hurt . . .

ST. JOHN’S UNIVERSITY SLIPS.BM}K

JAMAICA, N. Y. (CPS) —
St. John’s University, which
shook the educational world
when it fired 31 teachers in
1955 in a dispute over the laCul-
ty’s role in policy-making, has
quietly regained its accredita-
tion.

The Middle States Associa-
tion oi College and Secondary
Schools has “vacated" an order
requiring the Catholic univer-
sity to show cause why its
accreditation should not be lift-
ed. The association said St.
John's “is an improved educa-
tional institution” and also cited
the “appointment at a distin-
guished lay educator." Dr.
Henry Mills, as provost as rea-
sons tor liiting the order.

The Very Rev. JDSBph T.
Cahlll, St. John's president,
said, “We are naturally very
gratiiied that the show cause
order has been vacated."

Groups representing college
proiessors were not so pleased,
however. Betram H. Davis,
general secretary of the Amer-
ican Association oi University
Prolessoi-s, said, “It is disap-
pointing to learn that the Mid-
dle States AssoClatlon has taken

this action heiore St. John's
regulations and policies were
iound to be in full conformity
with accepted standards or
academic ireedom and tenure.

lsrael Kugler, president 01
the United Federation of Col-
lege Teachers (UFCT), the
union winch represents 18 oi
the 31 tired teachers Said his
organization was extremely
displeased" at the (120.10“. He
also outlined some of the issues
which he felt should have been
resolved belore the order was
liited. Among “i“:

—The admi stration has re-
iused to allow the UFCT, a local

unit of the American Federation
oi Teachers (AFT), exist as an
organization on the campus.

rThe approximately 100
teachers who struck against St
John’s for Six months after the
31 proiessors were tired should
have been automatically rein-
stated when Lhe case was turned
over to an arbitration group. A
few of the 100 have been rein—
stated but most have taken ap-
pointments at other univer-
sities.

>Tlie arbitration procedure.
which is expected to begin later
this month, is secret, the teacha
ers had to iorego all rights to
sue ior libel and slander, and
they are not allowed to be re-
presented by the union.

oi the 31 who were originally
fired, two have been rellired
by the university, ll have taken

positions elsewhere, 13 have
agreed to arbitration and iive
are still planning to sue the
university. Kiigler said the suit
was intended to bring out into
the open the alleged lack or
academic freedom at St. John's.

The 31 were bred ior union
activity and other shorts to
gain a greater voice in the run-
ning oi the university.
