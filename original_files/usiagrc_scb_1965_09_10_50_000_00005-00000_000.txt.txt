" Ieiichér-Sliidenl Relationship Exacls
Bolli Open Minds and Open Stomach:

To the Editor:
By Vii-lure of age and most iln'
poi-taut, education, the student and
cteacher stand on ditterent planes.
They have often been described as
being polenuciilly opposed: better
that they should be in juxtaposi-
tion. l am not advocating the im-
possible, a state of intellectual
rapport, but most certainly there
can and should be a point of great

or understanding. This understand-
ing is not to be reached by a blind
and uiireasoning tolerance benefir

oently bestowed by one group upou.

tiie other. but it may well be ar-
.rived at through the process ot
education itself.

Great is the professor who
through the work ot a Voltaire iiir
troduccs his students to the write

.ings ol a Marx as well. Greater
still is he who not only introduces.
but teaches opposing human con-
cepts, It is the great and constant
danger to the classroom that the

.soot ot stagnation and apathy will
descend upon the pedagogue and
the student alike—a stagnation
bred by narrowness of mind and
fruitless intellectual calesilienics.

g There is a beauty to be discov-
ered in the study of the Hegelian
dialectic; a wonder to be bestowed
up on the student or an Einstein or
Fermi: a thrill to be experienced
by the reader or a De Toqueville
or Whitehead. Untortunately. the
beauty, the wonder, and the thrill
are otten equated with a erfectlon
which is attributed to t e indivir

Oduai studied, Where the question-
ing process should begin, it is end-
ed Tile long pilgrimage which a
true education demands is trans-
formed into an abortive excursion

' or shoit mileage and few sidetrips.

The fault, dear reader. rests not
upon the shoulders of the protes-
sors alone any more than it tails

4 upon the student. The responsibili-
ty should be shared equally by
both, The teacher must offer the
challenge and guidance—the stu~
dent must have the fortitude and
desire to accept the challenge.

The citadels oi learning can
oftei- one a blanket of false se-
curity tor a tow years if one is a

1 student and for a lifetime if you
are a professor. It is a secu ' ot
bcautiful ideas beautifully written.
One day a man can be wooed by
the conservatism of Burke, the

. next day the ultraleftist Marx may
beckon him. This is good, but it is
the tirst step only.

Both pretessor and pupil must
descend the staircase of ideas and
mingle with humanity. The basic
question must be asked: Does what
we are studying have a place in
the society in which we are living?

, Pal'i ot the answer lies in the class-
room. part in the man on the street.
Some may pursue it in the alflur
eucc of a wealthy surbuban de-
vciooiucnt, others by work'ng \n

ever, the answer can only he tound

for those who question. and this
is the [rile objective of education.

When student and scholar realize
this, they will have accepted for
themselves a sentiment echoed by
Alexander Pope two centuries ago,
“The proper study of mankind is
man" ll man does not live by
bread alone, neither should the
educated live by the theories which
are contained in hooks alone. it
this is taught then our campuses
will most certainly foster a deeper
understanding between the faculty
and student body and the educa-
tional process will take on a much
deeper and more rewarding signifi
cance.
