Baseball Team
loses Two Games;
To Take on Cornell

By Jack Harrod’

Trying to break out of a sell
one hitting slump which has
plagued them most of the sea-
son, Grinnell’s baseball squad
plays host to Cornell tomorrow
in a twin bill beginning at 1:00
pm. Only the first game will
count towards conference stand-
logs.

The Pioneers. who had. ear-

lier shown some signs of being '

a pennant contender in the
MCAC Southern Division, ran
up against two iron»man pitch-
ers last weekend and dropped
all three contests. The losses
moved Grinnell to third place in
the divisional standings with a
.428 percentage.

Harold Wertich of Monmouth
went all 16 innings against the
Scarlet a week ago to pick up
the win in a 7-2 decision In-
cluded in this marathon were
13 consecutive hitless frames by
the Scot hurler. Cal Collier,
last of a trio of Pioneer pitch-
ers. was tagged for the loss.
Both Grinnell markers came in
the first on a hunt, hit batsman,
throwing error and Nick Nonas’
run-producing single.

On April 25th Knox’s Doug
Ziech matched Wertich's per
formance by pitching both ends
of a doubleheader and downing
the Scarlet 471 and ti-q, Again.

' Nonas came through to drive in
the lone Grinnell run with a
base hit following Steve Tilly's
wind-blown triple to'the wall
in right.

In the nightcap the Pioneers
got runners around to third in
three frames but left them
stranded. As in the Monmouth
contest, the Scarlet pitching
was excellent with Denny
Hanssen and Barry Anderson
going the route, but spotty field-
ing gave the Siwash crucial
runs.

Leading the Grinnell hitters
at this point in the campaign is
Dick Ulrich with a $19 aver-
age. Ulrich has also knocked in
6 runs, Nonas. who leads the
club in R. B. l.’s with 7, and
John Sliierholz are both over
the 300 mark.

Pitching, the P i 0 rl e e r’s
strongest department, is headed
by Hanssen who has a 1.24 ERA
and has struck out 44 batters in
his 29 innings of work Hans-
sen, 172 for the season, will get
the nod in tomorrow's opener.
Coach John Pﬁtsch’s other
starter for the duo will be
sophomore Steve Tilly, who
tossed 6 innings against Mon-
mouth and was touched for
only one run. Backing up will
be Anderson, leading the staff
with 2 wms, and reliefer Col-
lier. .

Rounding out the Pioneer's
lineup against the Rams in the
first game will be Collier at.
hrst,,Ulrich at second, Tilly at
short, Phil King at third. and‘
Shierholz, Dave Synhorst and;
Vern Robinson in the outfield.
If Nonas, hobbled this week by
n jammed heel. is unable to.
catch then Robinson will switch

 

to backstop and Steve Farber,
will go into right. i

Sharpshooling Sophomore Follows Dad,
Wins Trophies, Titles in Rare Hobby

For her competitive shooting
Marsha uses a Winchester 52, a
smallbore .22 caliber gun. There
are four ratings is competitive
shooter can have and Marsha
already has three of them. in
1960 she received her marks-
man rating; in 1962 her sharp-
shooter rating; and in 1963 her
expert rating. If she can get in
enough practice she hopes to
have her mas‘ter‘rating by next
year.

Since practicing in the city of
Des Moines is frowned on,
Marsha has to drive thirty
miles to Van Meter, Iowa, to
practice. She usually goes
about twrce a week in the sum-
mer. \

When asked why she enjoys
shooting, Marsha mentioned
travel. Then she said, "We
spend the whole day outside
and just shoot constantly. in
any weather, sunny and hot,
windy, rainy, cold, we keep on
shooting!"

A sophomore coed who is a
crack rifle shot? Yes. and right
here on Grinnell campus!
Marsha Smim, Haines Hall,
started shooting in 1956. “My
older brother didn’t shoot at all
so Dad was real happy when l
showed an interest," Marsha
laughed “There are very iew
women interested in shooting.”
Mr. Smith's business is the
lCI-X Manufacturing Company
which makes hunting coats and
other similar articles; Mr.
Smlth also shoots and Marsha:
accompanies him to various
matches around the state.

In her eight years of shootui
ing Marsha has amassed a
small collection of titles. in
1962 she was on the Iowa State
Team (comprised of the top,
ten shooters in the state); in
1961 and l962 she was Iowa
State Woman’s Champion; and
in 1963 she was the Minnesotal
State Woman’s Champion.

‘ First, an important bulletin:
As a result of last week’s edi—
torial in the 5&3 regarding
paths being trodden across
Grinnell's ”green expanses.”
1M baseball players playing on
either Mac or the 10th Avenue
fields are asked to survey the
base paths before getting up to
the plate. It the batter notices
a definite lack of green along
these base paths and ii the bat
ter accidentally gets hit he is
asked to try to avoid runningy
directly along these paths and>
instead should skip daintily
around these bare lanes with as
much haste as the hitter deems
necessary.

in fairness to these consider-
ate hall players the opposing
infielders are asked to take
their time fielding the ball and
throwing to first. This will help

 

One positive factor in partic-
ipating in shooting matches is
the chance to travel. Marshai
has traveled east as far as Oan'
to compete and she competed in‘ Bunny Hunt and Sue Taylor
the Sharpshooters of Rocky have entered Theta Sigma Phi;
Mountain Regional Match inllohn Woli has been elected to
Colorado in 1962. lsigma Delta Chi.

Three new members hav.
been selected by the t
campus journalism fraternities;

 

 

preserve the aesthetic beauty of
our ”green expanses.” Thank
you. (As far as the ”new field"
is concerned, there’s not much
anyone can do to help that
thing, anyway.)

Raw Deal of the Week award
goes to East by unanimous Ile~
cision of the judges. They were
allowed to play four innings
throughout last Monday’s rain
(which constitutes a completed
game) only to have the game
called with the bases loaded
and no outs, just as the rain
was obviously letting up. At
the time they were behind 52.
thus losing to Smith. That
game ls now under protest with WW,
the IM board, as is an old
game with North and Cowles.

The standings haven’t
changed much since last week,
with Dibble and South still at
the top of the animal heat.
