Student Government Speaks

By T. THOMAS, H. FOOTE, L. MAR“.

' ‘Amld extremely long Senate
meetings, petitions, Schneirov’s
ease, student allairs committee
meetings, Iall-(s with Ihe deans
and numerous other meetings
which oiten seem to have no
real signilicance, one tact is not
submerged in the bureaucratic
"democracy” here at Grinnell.
atudent power still remains the
only logical means to bring
about the needed changes at
Grinnell.

As frustration increases with
the present rules, student gov-
ernment continues to act as a
saiety valve for students who
are interested in changing the
present rules. while demon—
strations, sleepsins, and Sit~ins
always alter the most satisly-
ing means to rid oneselt of the
present hypocrisy, it is now
generally recognized that dem-
onstrations, at best, serve only
particular, immediate n e e d s
and are oiten useless in the
long run, That is to say, alter
every demonstration one still
has the Iask of seeing that de-
mands are neither neglected
nor deleted.

Student government at Grin-
nell continues to focus stu-
dents’ attention on needed
changes, yet the tailures of this
Institution are obvious. The
Senate, ior example, represents
\he views of a particular part
of the student body rather than
lhe campus as a whole. One
need only look at the member-
ship or the Senate and the re-
spective voting records of its

members to verily this point.
The same may he said of the
executive cabinet The only
elected body which would seem
to reflect a representative spec-
trum of student opinion is the
Association of Woman Students
(A.W.S.) and the Counctl of
House Presidents (CotHP). Yet
for various reasons these two
groups have remained rather
anonymous

On the same end or the politi-
cal scale one ﬁnds Students for
a Democratic Society (S.D.S.).
The SDS can be Criticized in
the same manner as the Senate,
for its particular interests
are not diose oi the general
student body. This iuzzy analy-
sis reveals that SGA and SDS
are recruiting trim the same
sources in Order to amuse an
interest in changing the sys-
tem, the SGA representing the
liberal view and SDS the more
radical view. In regards to the
Schneirov case, SDS has ﬁnal-
ly brought one particular issue,
that of the opens rule, to direct
confrontation This organization

should be congratulated, for it,

has aroused student interest
and clearly detined the issues
involved. The Schneimv case
has made it quite evident that
until students begin to take an
active part in the affairs which

A student, however, does not
become involved in an issue by
taking part in a demonstration
or seeking an easy solution. A
student becomes truly involved
when he realizes that issues
are not as simple as they
seem, that what appears to be
black and white is, in fact,
grey, One should respond to the
current situation by helping to
create alternative solutions to
the existing problem. Only in
this way can any meaningful.
lasting solutions be found.
“Home rule” is not a meaning
Iul, lasting solution, rather it
is an easy solution which does
not attack the basic pioblems,

Student and faculty passivity,
administrative double-talk, and
alumni-trustee evasiveness all
make (or an increasing dissatis-
faction in the present situation.
Student power should, and must
be used to change the existing,
ridiculous situation not only in
the social rules but in other
areas as well. But student pow-
or, at the same time, carries
with it responsibility not only

hearing said they disagreed
with the present ruler

Lawrence Frank, chairman
of the Judicial Council, said
early in the hearing that the
court did not intend to judge
Schneirov merely on a basis of
the present rule The court, he
continued, was going to review
the mile, for if the rule was
found to be unjust, then
Schnelrov may not have vio-
lated anything,

Dean Thompson said that the
present situation was diliicult,
but that Lhe deans have not dis-
covered a coherent answer to
the problem. Dean Low recalla
ed her conversation with Kath-
erine Karlson, Langan presi-
dent, who has declared a 24-
hour opens policy. Mrs. Low
said she had disagreed with
the method used in Langan.

“We must work within the sys-
tern." She ielt that the physi«
cal arrangements of the dormi-
tories caused problems with
open dormitories. She also said
that there were problems of
mental health of hall members.

in What was an answer to
CoiHP President Lee. Maril's
present acceptance of “home
rule” in the dormitories, Dean
Thompson expressed the opin-
ion that majority rule is not a
satisiactory method to deter-
mine use oi dormitory rooms
because it ignores the wishes
of the minority,

Bonnie Tinker concluded by
asking, “How many (in the
audience) are in agreement
With the Senate statement (re-
garding the sclineirov case)?"
very many in the audience
raised their hands. She Con-
cluded that the rule Schneirov
was tried under is obsolete and
that students should have the
responsibility or selfrgovern-
merit.

The Judicial Council an-
nounced that it would notify
Schneirov by mail of its deci-
oion and make a public state-
ment on that decision.
