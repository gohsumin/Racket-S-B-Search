the score. The margin of the
victory (the extra point) was
made on a pass play. East men
were near the ball but failed to
keep their receiver from gath-
ering it in. East now falls back
into a tie with Dibble, but must
still play two rough teams,
Clark and Gates while Dibble
plays second division teams,

The other big upset of the
week was powerful South 0-6 be-
ing tied by the dark horse of
the league, Langan so. it was
predicted by all the spans
writers of America at their an-
nual convention in Da Nang,
South Viet Nam, last August that
Langan would not lose all their
games this yeari The foresight
of these men is amazing. (They
picked University of Iowa as
lﬂth in the Iowa Conference last
year — Playboy picked them
ﬁrst In the nation!)

won the 3.00.6.

Langan’l offense finally ex»
ploded for the first time this
reason. Only one-third of their
passes were lntercepmd and
they rushed for a season high
of minus 58 yards. It was the
defense, however, which earns
credit for the moral victory.
Time and time again they let:
the ends get so far in the open
the quarterback thought it was
some other guy who just ran
onto the ﬁeld. These tactics and
a “never die” spirit earns Lan-
gan honors as the "team of the
week." May we have a moment
of silence?

Gates moved up toward, per~
haps, a second place finish if
they can bear East this next
week. Clark, another contender

SCARLET AND BLACK

of last week, lost to Dibble and
is out of the this picture, but
could decide the championship
if they beat East today.

I scored pretty well on my
predictions last week; at least
I think so — all the final scores
weren't available I was 9-2-1.
Here are the ones for today and
the rest of the schedule.

Redmen with a healthy lead
late in the game.

The pioneers were once with-
in a point of the Redmen in
the second quarter after capit-
olizing on two big breaks, The
first was a bad hike on an at-
tempted Ripon punt which gave
the Pioneers the ball deep in
Ripon territory. 0n the follow—
ing kickoff Jim Poison ran be-
tween several startled Ripon
players, picked up the ball
for the Pioneers and Izmight
it close to the Ripon thirty.
From there the Pioneers drove
for the second score.
