. . . Shooting for ’66

(Continued from Page 1)

believes the United States
should first slow down the es-
calation in Viet Nam, (lemon-
strate its willingness to nego-
date in “good faith” with the
Viet Cong, and iinally per-
suade the U.N. to exert the
influence at world opinion for
negotiations.

Day supports a cessation of
US. bombing and the Gavin«
Ridgeway enclave proposals
Fearing "one of the worst
bloodbaths in history,” he does
not advocate immediate with
drawal, but a slowing down at
escalation. After these Initial
steps, he wants the President
to take the issue to the Secure
ity Council. If Russia or France
Vetoes this peace alert, [then
the President, under the U.N.
Charter, should call a special
session of the General Assem-
bly “and address the citizens of
llile World." If the UN does
not act, then the U.S. should
reconvene the Geneva powers
and institute through interna-
tional agencies economic and
humanitarian programs for
Viet Nam.

"II we go to the U.N. in
good faith," Day said, "things
will move . . . The President
should be commended for the
(peace) Initiatives taken re-
cently.” The U.S. must build
on these initiatives, he said.
At the same time, he ques-
tioned the “good faith” of US.

the recent peace note handed
to U Thant as the Pentagon
announced an increase in mili-
tary expenditures.

Day emphasized the import-
ance at economic development
to Viet Nam, Poverty, he said,
helps the spread or Com-
munism and must be alleviat-
ed by programs such as tho
Mekong Delta Project.

The U.S., Day said should
let the people of Viet Nam
decide what kind of govern-
ment they want. He believed
Ho Chi Minh would win any
election held today but thought
General Ky was no better al-
ternative. He agreed with a
professor that. there were both
“strong elements 0! national-
lsm” in North Viet Nam and an
"historical reality" there of
continuing Communist inﬂuence,
Any settlement nﬂW, he admitt-
ed, would probably mean even-
tual control of Vict Nam by
North Viet Nam. “But," he said
"the question facing the world'
is escalation and possible nu-
clear war."

The chance that he will be
elected, Day said, “is probab—
ly not too great." But Day
hopes that a sizable peace
vote in this election could in-
ﬂuence the parry plaitorms and
candidates later. “Our gins
are Set for ’68,” he told his
audience. With a peace bloc. he
believes US policy can be
changed so that it ”leads the
world to the peace table."
