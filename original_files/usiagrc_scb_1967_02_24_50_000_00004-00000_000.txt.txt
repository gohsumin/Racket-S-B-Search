Federation of College Women

Madison, Wis. This conven-
tion is or special importance
for it marks the fiftieth annir
versary of the ARFCW.

Grinnell has in past year-
always sent delegates to na-
tional, regional and state Eon-
ventions, but a special invita-
tion to become a delegate is i&
[lied this year to all interested
students. The Grinnell WRA
hopes to send a large delega-
tion because it feels that this
convention will be of signifi-
cant value in exploring the
role of recreation for the total
oollege community.

This is of more than theoretir
cal interest, for Grinnell is
about to begin a new recrea-
tion program, indicated by the
planned physical education
complex.

The convention entails a
iotirday expensepaid trip to
the University of Wisconsini
from March 29 through April
2. interested Students should
