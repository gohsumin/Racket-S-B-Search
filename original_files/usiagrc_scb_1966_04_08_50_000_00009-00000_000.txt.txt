(Continued from Page I)

of the 292 who said there was

not a North Campus Problem, the
largest concern was for property
damage (28 per cent noted this as
ii problem). Privacy in the balls
(25 per cent) and noise levels in
the halls (21 per cent) were the
next largest areas of concern.
. oi the 292 who said there was
no North Campus Problem, 75
could find no problem that war»
ranted campus wide attention.

Men constituted about 65 per cent
of the respondents (309). They
were somewhat moie adamant

' about the non-existence at a North
Campus Problem. Sixty-eight per
tent of the men said there was niJ
problem. Only 49 per cent at the
women felt there was no North
Campus Problem (41 per cent said
there was and 11 per cent had no
opinion).

Men named property damage as
the largest problem (33 per cent
named it as a problem). The lack
of an academic atmosphere came
in a close second as the most rec-
ognized problem (29 per cent).
Noise and lack or privacy were
next in order (each drew 25 per
cent recognition as problem areas).

women agreed that property
damage was the biggest problem
on North Campus (38 per cent
checked it as a problem). Right
behind (with 37 per cent recogni-
tion) came privacy, 3 common
concern on South Campus these
days.

Several of those filling out the
survey made marginal notes. A
senior man commented on the
three suggestions [or changing the
system which were included in the
survey, saying that they “assume
that 18er year old Students are
still Children and incapable of con-
trolling themselves intelligently.”

A freshman man said that "the
problem is that the student en<
iorcement officers emphasize en-
forcing rules rather than promot»
ing an attitude oi concern in all
hall residents {or their fellows.”

The concept oi a North Campus
Problem was “not that clear cut"
to one sophomore woman, She said
that she thinks “there's a lack of
responsibility on campus but not
something that hall changes would
correct.”

with those ol‘ Hungarian folk inu-
sic. The work is continuous in its
setting; solos are presented in
quartet style; full orchestra ac-
companies the choir.

Carl Orfi, on the other hand, is
more than a muSlclan; his work
has a theatrical flair. Pen
formances of the Carmina Burana
usually involves staging. Unlike
the Te Deum, this piece is not
continuous. It is a sectiondlized
composition including closed solo
pieces. ortt draws from many
areas or compositionAtlie Gregol'~
ian chant, early organum, dance
rhythm, and ruin Inﬂuence.

The text comes from a book of
poems discovered in a Benedictine
monastery in Southern Bermany
near Orif’s birthplace. The poems
are secular in nature and were
written by monks who had elicitly
gone to town and indulged them-
selves. The text deals with the joys
of living, world pleasures, and
the joys and sorrows oi drinking.
The text, in combination with the
music, results in an exciting, mu-
sically and dramatically colorful
work. The conductor, Denis de Co~
teau says of the Carmina from
the perfurmer’s standpoint: "Al-
though it's a serious work, it’s a
work for pure enjoyment."

N0 tickets are needed for this
event which promises to be an
important one in the area oi line
arts.
