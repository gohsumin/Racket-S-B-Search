Kato Describes Fictitious Town
In Iowa for Japanese Audience

Mr. Hidetoshi Kate is visit-
lug Grinnell this semester as a
professor of sociology and Far-
Eastern history. His home is
Kyoto, Japan, where he was en-
[aged in research for the Re-
hearch Institute for Humanis<
tic Studies at Kyoto University
,When he was invited jointly by
[he State College of Iowa and
Grlnnell College to come to
America and teach for a year.
He plans to continue doing re-
search when he returns to Ja-
pan this summer.

This is not Mr. Keto’s first
Qisit to America. He came once
to do postgraduate study at
Harvard. where he studied with
David Riesman, author of The
Lonely Crowd. He came again
to participate in a conference
on International Communica-
tions at Stanford University.
Mr. Kato is accompanied on
this visit by his wife and his
two children. Mari, 5, and Fu-
chari, almost 2. ,

The children, according to
Mrs. Kato, like America very
much, especially American
television. Mari speaks English
.well and she attends nursery
lchool here. Fu-chan (a pet
name) does not say much yet
hut he is full of curiosity.

Mr. Kato is perhaps best
gnown in Japan as an author.

e is presently contributing a
series of articles to a Japan-
ese magazine similar to Time
called ”Letters From a Small
‘American Community” The
letters come from the fictitious
town of Springfield, lowa, a ru-
ral community of about 10,000

people, similar to Grinnell,
which Mr. Kato constructed
after talking to many Iowans
with varied occupations and
gathering an impression of what
the average Iowa farm town
would he like. Mr. Karo com-
mented that the main difference
that he noticed between Amer-
ican and Japanese farms was
the greater technological devel-
opment here. Many Japanese
farms are too small and hilly
even to accommodate a tractor.

0f the books he has written
the most recent is The History
of Vis ual Communication;
which discusses the develop-
ment in Japan such non-verbal
means of communication as pic-
tures, architecture. folk singing,
and dancing. He has also writ»
ten a book called, The World of
Eyes and Ears, in which he dis
cusses such varied phenomena
as comic books, pin ball ma-
chines and how the American
cocktail party compares to a
Japanese tea party.

In addition to teaching his-
tory and sociology courses at
Grinnell, Mr. Kato. who felt his
students might like to study
their subjects in the original

 

language has organized a class
in writing, reading and speak-
ing Japanese, He hopes to leave
his class with enough proficien-
cy to be able to get along in the
language in Japan.

Mr, Kato’s home, Kyoto, was
formerly the capital of Japan
for 1000 years. There is no in-
dustry there except handcrafts,
and no agriculture. It remains
ancient and traditional, retain-
ing many of the customs tour-
ists associate with Japan, such
as tea ceremonies and flower
arranging. Kyoto is an academ-
ic center, the site of several col-
leges and universities, Approx-
imately 60,000 students make
up one-sixth of its population.

Mr. Kate said that it is only
recently that the Japanese have
adopted a Western system of
education. He praised small
liberal arts colleges like Grin-
nell warmly, saying that they
were leading the trend in influ-
encing young people to seek
real, meaningful goals instead
of material advancement.

Mr. Kato will speak on Japan-
ese culture at 3 p.m., Saturday,
in Younker lounge during Jap—
anese Week,
