24 Hour Opens

Since the campus-wide rei~
Irendum was held two weeks
ago, all the halls on campus
have set their individual hall

lice: with respect to vlsita-
dons pending action by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.
Many halls decided upon
hours by floor or section, but
each hall in its entirety decid-
ed what the maximum hours
could be. To enforce the new
ball rules, as well as existing
rules such as quiet hours, ev-
Dry hall has established a ju-
dicial body of some kind sub-
ect to the approval of tho

ouncil of House Presidents
and Associated Women Stu-

Many halls made the dis.
tinctlnn between "open hall-
ways" and “open rooms."
“Open hallways" imply that

Faculty Approves

1 Course Evaluation

On Monday, Nov. 18, Theo-
dore Glick, ’71, appeared be-
fore a faculty meeting to
exp 'n, and ask for faculty co-
operation with a plan for stu-
dent evaluations oi courses. The
plan, which was heard by the
Executive Committee a week
earlier, involved a question<
naire to be sent to each stu-
dent, in it would be questions
relating to criticism of courses
and of professors instructional
methods.

The vote of the faculty ex-
pressed support for the idea of
course evaluation, but was not,
Mr. Leggett said, to be taken as
approval of the particular
group of questions proposed. in-
stead, a vote will be taken on
specifics of the questionnaire
at a later meeting.

The inclusion of students on
faculty committees (Library.
Public Events, e.g.) was also
discussed at the meeting,

Dean Stauss reread the reg-
ulations on absences before and
after holidays to the meeting
in order to remind the faculty
before Thanksgiving that the
rules still exist

 

The Monroe Hotel: The Later Years

(Continued from last week)

By MARK SABLEMAN And
PAUL ROTHMAN

The Monroe Hotel, after
ownerships and managements
by several different people, and
Grinnell College, in the 1930's
and 19405, came under the
wnership of Mr. George Hiser,

usband of Associate Professor
Mrs. Velma Hiser.

During Mr. l-liser’s manage-
ment and ownership, the ho-
tel's dlnlng room gained a na-
tional reputation Ior fine
toads, especially for its
steaks; during the 40's and
early 50's, people would come
from miles around to eat
there, Just after the end of
World War 1!, Mr. Riser redid
the floor at the hotel lobby,
and lmbedded u-lirty - two
oilver dollars in it. These sil-
ver dollars are now quite val-
«able and were removed by

the present management just
this fall.
Tunnels Under Hotel

Through the years, many
legends, some with elements
of truth, some completely
false, have grown up concern-
ing the Monroe l-lotei, Proba»
bly, the best known legendvis
that: there are tunnels under
the hotel, Mr. George Hiser,
manager of the hotel for
twenty - five years, contends
that there are no tunnels, but
others, including Police Chief
Bill Peters, say that they have
actually been in the tunnels.
As the best legend has it, the
tunnels originate in the north-
ern half of the hotel basement,
which would be under the old
site of J. B. Grinnell’s house,
and run as far as 435 East
Street, or, according to some,

New Grace Period
For Overdue Books

Burling Library has insti<
tuted an unoiiicial grace pe<
riod for overdue books. Stil-
dents will now be given 24
days to return a book with-
out being fined. After a no-
lice is sent, however, ﬁnes
must be paid.

Records will continue to
be fined beginning the day
they are due. This is because
“The demand is higher [or
records," said Mrs. Mary
Wyly, Reierence Librarian
in charge oi circulation.

Last year the library col-
lected $1,118.03 in fines for
overdue books and records.
The money pays ior the re-
pair and purchase of books.

 

Nichols, Jackson
Speak on Negro
In Literature

As part of the series on Afro-
American culture being pre-
sented, two visiting specialists
spoke Tuesday night on Afro-
American literature and Cul-
ture, Drs, Charles H. Nichols
and Blyden Jackson addressed
students in Roberts Theatre on
”How does Blackness affect the
works of the Negro American
writer?”

Dr. Jackson entitled his lec<
ture “A Bit of Comedy, Amer-
ican Style," and discussed the
changes in the American Negro
family.

He feels that over the years,
the Negro family has become a
source of strength and “a biolo‘
gical success," for they hava
iound ways and means to use
their money, and they are send<
ing more and more children to
college, and they are being fed
better.

In discussing the probable ei-
fecis of color on Negro fiction,
Jackson cited several observa-
tions. He noted that there is a
very small world for the Negro
movement and this world is
monolithic.

“The Runaway Slave and the
Golden Bough," Dr. Nichols'
lecture, placed its emphasis on
the deeply entangled problems
or the Negro who tries to redis-

cover the image at his own cul-
furor

Becomes Effective When Affairs

Committee Ok’s Hall Proposals

Yesterday President Glenn Leggett presented
the Student Affairs Committee with a proposal
which would allow each residence hall a maximum
of 84 hours for coeducational visitation. The Presi-

Grinnell to Host
African Dancers

Les Danseurs Africains, the
national ensemble of Mali, will
give 7 p.m. and 10 pm. per-
formances at Grinnell College's
Roberts Theatre tomorrow.

The Company or dancers, at:-
mbats, singers, and musicians,
which has been acclaimed as
Africa's greatest, is making its
first tour of North America and
will perform in Chicago's Audi»
torium Theatre a week after its
Grinnell appearance.

Composed of members of
more than a dozen tribes that
form the major segment of
Mali's population, the group
performs religious, sacrificial,
witchcraft, and funeral rites
that until recent years were
closed to all except a highly re-
stricted group of adult males
in each tribe.

Block Spokesman
To Visit College

Ernest Chambers, a leader of
Omaha's Black community who
has gained national recognition
as a spokesman ior young
Blacks, will spend Friday and
Saturday at Grinnell college,

Chambers will keynote a Sat-
urday alternootl conference with
representatives of Black stu-
dents' organizations in laws and
from the Associated Colleges of
the Midwest.

While on campus, he will give
a lecture; be inteerewed at a
student press conference; and
meet informally with students
and faculty members at a series
of classroom sessions, “experi-
mental classes," meals, and
coffee breaks,

Chambers’ Gl‘lnnell College
appearance is being sponsored
by the Concerned Black Stu-
dents, Associated White Stu-
dents for Racial Equality. Stu<
dent Government Association,
and Program in Practical Poll~
tical Educationl

dent also agreed to the San-
ate's proposal for 24-hour open
lounges which had been ap<
proved by the Student Affairs
Committee.

Leggett indicated that visita-
tinns would not be permitted
between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.
on Sunday through Thursday
and between 2 a.m. and B a.m.

The text of Mr, Leggztt’s

letter begins on page 2.
2
on Friday and Saturday. “The
opening of the commonause
lounges weakens any argument
for the need to have coeduca<
tional visiting in individual
rooms during the normal hours
for sleeping," said Leggett.

The proposal will go into ef-
fect in each dormitory when
that hall has submitted a state.
ntent of ball policy to the sui-
dent Affairs Committee, and
that policy has been approved.

President Leggett said there
was a need to insure all stu-
dents comfort and privacy in
the dormitories and dining
rooms, a need for expansion of
the off-campus housing option,
and a procedure for eviction
from the residence halls for
students who misbehave.

The recommendations of the
president are to cover what he
called the “interim period,”
when a deﬁnite policy can ho
worked out by the Student Af-
fairs Committee and approved
by the college's administration.

The college‘s rule has been
that the dormitories were open
to members of the opposite sex
on Sundays from 2 pm. to 5
p.m. and on one or two eve.
nings per semester, during
hours decided in conjunction
with the deans.

The President said that the
college, can no longer support
the old notion “that Residence
hail management ought chieﬂy
to reflect a kind of remedial
parenthood (in low purentls) ens
vironment.”

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee on October 15 approved the
students’ petition which would
give each hall authority on
whether or not to open up the
lounges for 24—hour coeducnn
tional use.
