N0 GRADES
AT ANTIOCH

YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio
(CPS) — The faculty of Antioch
College has voted to abolish
grades, and replace them with
a “credit/no credit” system of
evaluating students’ work

At present Antioch has an
A—B~C—D-F grading scale. The
new system, which was ap-
proved hy the faculty May 7,
requires faculty to give fairly
detailed reports on the progresl
of students in addition to as
signing them “credit or no
credit” for courses.

The new plan was the result
of a two-year study by the edu<
cational policy committee,
which was headed by Mrs. Ruth
Churchill, director of testing at
Antioch.

According to Mrs. Churchill,
the details of the new evaluation
system are still being worked
out: by her committee. She says.
though, that faculty will be able
to give comments on students.
and also note their progress in
the following six areas: skills
and techniques, substantive
learning, creative thinking. in-
dependent thinklng. quantity of
work and responsibility.
