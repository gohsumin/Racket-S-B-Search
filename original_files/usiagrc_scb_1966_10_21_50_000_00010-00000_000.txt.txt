The National Guard directed
volunteers in the major outdoor
clean-up operations “The Na-
tinllal Guard seemed awfully
Inefficient,” said one Grinnell
V a l u n t 2 e r, Ric MacDowell.
“There were an awlully lot ct
unilormed people around and
they should have assigned
one to each volunteer groupr
Instead they dropped or on and
leit us. We were given some<
thing to do which lasted only
In hour and n halt and then we
had to walk around and ask
people it they needed help.

“The orders were vague about
what you could pick up. You
couldn't move thing: in or
around houses because the in-
surance assessors hadn't been
there yet. so some volunteers
were moving heavy things just
from one pile to another — this
clearing up task should have
been done efficiently by s trac<
tnr."

Some students ended up help-
ing people at their houses. A
low Grinnell girls helped an old
woman salvage antiques that
she had been saving for years.
"Many at her things were
smashed; it was very sad," was
the comment oi une who helped

Generally though, the towns-
people seemed to have tr very
optimistic attitude about the
clean-up task. “We’re a close-
knit [Own and we're taking it
in our stride," one woman told
a student as she searched for
snlvagable belongings in the
remains other homer

‘We‘ru iortunate there weren't
more casualties because it all

happened so suddenly there
wasn’t any time to seek shel-
ter," the woman added. The
storm gave no warning whatso-
ever and many were caught
trying to hold their doors
closed, not realizing that they
were in the midst of a tomado,

Although an unusually large
number of home and business
owners were insured, It was
pointed out that “your insur-
ance is never enough tor a
catastrophe like this." besiiB
Rayson, from Grinnell, said
about the townspeople's future,
"You would get awlully de<
pressed to brave to stay there
now. it was a novelty to be
down there tor one day, but we
could turn around and leave.
Still this was a good opportu—
nity tor Gn‘nnell students. Wis
always talk about being com-
mitted but we never do any-
thing about it."
