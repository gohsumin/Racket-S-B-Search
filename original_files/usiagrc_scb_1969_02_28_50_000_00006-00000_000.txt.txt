Objections Overruled;
SA System Unchanged

Aiter careful inquiry, the student at-
ialrs committee passed a resolution con-
cerning the Student Advisor system. it

recommended iirst that the program be
directed in philosophy. training. alld
budget by an advisory board composed
of two student advisors, two students. Mr.
Haas, Mr, Obermiller, Mrs. Low. and
one assistant dean.

it further emphasized that student ad-
viser-s are Counselors. not drseiplinarians.
and that this should be made clear both
to the student advisors and t0 the resi-
dents oi their halls. The committee
voted 473 to retain the present salary oi
3203 per year. Early next year. it plans to
conduct a more thorough evaluation and
review oi the program's control. salaries,
etc.

This action is the result oi a much
broader proposal in.tiated by the three
student members or the committee. The
original plan called for separation oi the
advisor program from its present ties to
the Dean's Ofﬁce. The students asked lor
an autonomous program, directed by a
governing board similar to the advi ry
board outlined above. The committee,
however, felt that the success or the ad-
visory group at this time was dependent
upon maintaining essentially the same
format.

The three representatives of SGA. Tom
Thomas, Heather Foote, and Lee Maul,
also clashed with the other members or
the committee on the question .0!
salaries. The students had asked that
salaries be abolished. Again using the
rationale that it was necessary to main-
tain the status quo one more year. the
committee decided against the change.
The students then opted for a compro-
mist or cutting the salaries to 5100. thus
nosing $7,000. It was also proposed that
the committee recommend that these
iunds be redirected, in part. to iiirance an
extended speakers program related to
the student advisors’ training, Mrs. Low
stated that she ielt this unwise, as there
could be no absolute guarantee that
such funds would be used as the commit-
tee wished.

Tom Thomas, SGA President. com-
mented that he ielt “the committee has
only postponed a decision that must
again be considered using little more in-
iormation than is presently available."
Though somewhat disappointed with the
resultant recommendation, Thomas add<
ed. “I feel the establishment of an inn
dependent budget controlled by a joint
committee is a signiﬁcant step to creat-
ing student control oi the advisory pro

iy. Giddins read a statement declin-
ing to testiiy. since he had not been ad~
vised as to Whether or not he would be
a defendant. Aitei‘ the state told him
that they would grant him immunity. he
said that he was not iamrliar with legal
procedures. and wished to consult with
an attorney. He was then excused from
testifying. Nissan said that he would not
testify on the grounds that his testimony
might tend to incriminate him, and was
then excused,

Dean Alice LOW could not attend
Wednesday's hearing because she was
leaving town. By calling her secretary.
Mrs. Oda calleson, as a Witness, the
state attempted to enter as evidence
Mrs. an's signed statement concerning
conversations She had had with two of
the deiendants. Mrs. Calleson testified
that she had typed the statement for
the Dean. The defense objected that
Mrs. Law was not present to be cross—
examined. and the typed statement was
theieioie not admitted as evidence

Three other students. SGA President
Tom Thomas, '70. James Lew, ’70. and
Deslonde Lamb, ’69. also testiﬁed. Their
testimony, plus that at Schem and Spell
established that three of the defendants
were nude during the Gates Hull discus-
sloll. Because no one testified with abslr
lute certainty that the defendant Sarah
nanranu had completely disrobed, De~
sense Attorney Johnston made the mo«
tiou that the information against her I)!
dismissed.

Johnston also made a separate motion
that the charges he dismissed against
all (our defendants since the testimony
of all the witnesses indicated only that
there was nudity, and not “indecency."
Johnston said that the “statute does not
punish disrobing, and does not punish
nudity.” He emphasized that no evidence
or any obscene or lewd actions had been
presented at the hearing.

in reply to Johnston's second motion
Justice 0! the Peace Lincoln Said. “the
court will not rule on what is lewd and
obscene." He then overruled the motion,
Concerning Miss Hermann, he ruled that
“because no evidence was brought up
that could be classed as indecent exA
posure.” the charges against her would
be dismissed. He then said that he would
refer the case to district court, and re
lease the deiendants on their own recog-
nizanee. No date has been set {or the
trial at District Court.

attendance at the campaign speeches
given in halls.

\ The tour candidates presently in the
race. which began on Fri. Feb. 21. are
John Herr, Jim Lew, Keith Petersen. and
Mark Allen. Candidates gave their pro
posals in campaign speeches presented
to an audience oi about i50 students in
ARI-I Monday night.

A few differing areas of major con-
cern have made themselves felt in each
candidate‘s platiorm. Jamie Trotter. who
withdrew from the race on Wednesday,
began his campaign-with the ideal or
"the creation of an academic atmos—
phere." John Herr and Jim Lew both
stressed proposals ior increasing the
communication between student govern-
ment and the student body. Mark Clit-
ford Allen defined the role of student
government to exclude curricular reiorm
and social pressure: “it is not to pass
resolutions and sit around as a 2nd late
debating society, but to iiod people. put
them on committees and make sure the
committees work."

Jamie Trotter. who withdrew “be-

. cause I am interested ill a different

system through which to channel my
efforts", gave his support to Jim Lew,
who has also stressed the idea that stu-
dent government should have a voice in
curricularutialrs. In meetings in the
halls. Lew suggested that students have
a legitimate right to question iaculty de-
cisions on certain mallers, such as tho
tiring oi proiessors.
