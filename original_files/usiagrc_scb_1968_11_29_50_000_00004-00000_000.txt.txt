Blades Tie Graceland 3-3
In Remalth After 3-1 Loss

Grinnell's Blades iought
Graceland College to a 3-3 tie
in last Sunday's rematch at
the Ice Arena in Des Moines

The improvement at the
Griiinell squad literally
stunned Graceland, who had
handed the Blades a at de-
teat only a week earlier. 0ue
unhellevlng Graceland player
inquired as to whether the
Blades had picked up some

layers trom Des Moines or
owa State.

Coach - captain Mike Schat—
(er said the team had im-

roved in every department,
'The deiense was real good,”
he noted. “We had lots or hus-
tle, but our biggest improve
ment was passing. I’ve never
seen us pass so well before."

The Blades, playing with on-
iy a 1»man bench during the
(irst hall of the game (the car
aarrynig the other players
had a ﬂat tire on the way in),
rabhed a commanding 270
ear],

The lirst goal was a do tout
unassisted shot by lettwiug
Bruce Graham which came in
the iii-st period.

B rian McPhrtland, the
Blades’ right deienseman.
neared the second goal on a
to loot slap shot to give Grin—
hell a 2-0 lead.

Graceland came back
strong in the second period to

knot the score at 272. With less
than live minutes gone in tho
tinal period they tnolr a 3-2
advantage,

The Blades regrouped their
forces and tied the score when
Grant Crandall centered to
Tim Power who slapped in a
10 foot shot. lll spite o! a con-
tinued surge on the Graceland
goal in the ilnal minutes, the
Blades were not able to pull
out a Victory.

The game was characterized
by roughness and superb do
tensive play. Ken Sigei, the
Blades' line goalie, made 22
saves. One of the highlights of
the contest was a l-onel con-
froiitation ln which Ken came
15 feet out of the goal area to
make a save.

Dther standouts on defense
were Pete Strouse, Terry Par—
sinen and Jeff “Boom Boom"
Mlllikin. Coach Schaliet‘ said
that it was the best game he's
seen Boom Boom play thus
far,

Graceland was landed with
5 penalties during the game.
Several times the uncalled—(or
roughness turned into near
brawls.

on offense Tom “Rocket"
Jackson, Bluce Graham, Til-n
Power and Grant Crandall
played especially tine games.

The Blades take to the ice
Sunday tor their next game.

GRAY MATTER!

By BILL GRAY
I noted with mixed emotions the coming or the inevitable ex-

pansion of coeducational hours. They have little effect on me since
the last girl i had in my room had merely stopped by to ask di-
rections to the Forum. Once again it appears that it will he the
I. M. program which will hear the brunt at the changing or cam-
pus lite. it used to he that I. M.’s were so popular and contested
so liercely because the male populace had little else to release
their pentrup emotions. with FA hours or opens, however, it is
nouhtlul ii there will be enough pent-up anyihing among the men
to have even one good 4"-man Squamish match in fact, I don’t
believe that it would be out oi line to propose separate living quar-
ters tor those people who wish to retain their energy ior use in
athletic endeavors; we could Call their dorm "The Penthouse"

I see where there is going to be co-ed pillgrpong In the North
Lounge. Last year they had cored badminton; it was won by
two men from Smith.

l. M. volleyball is over and, it anyone is interested, 1 Will
publish the standings next week. Charlie Brown once said, "Win-
ning isn't everything, but losing isn’t anything." This is totally
extraneous, but then so is the whole article, so I guess it follows
the pattern of the article and thus isn't extraneousl? Which re<
minds me of someone who once told me that my Whole life was
nothing more than a monumental syllogistic haw.

Yes! It's True!

proposal, there were two
issues to he resolved with re-
spect to open dorms. First.
there was the question oi what
will be done tor the rest oi this
year, and now, a proposal
{or a permanent solution. Un-
tortunately, the talks have been
hitting snares along the way.
Recent discussion has been de-
VDted t0 the real status and
importance of the committee.
Members telt that they had
been bypassed by the students
by recent declaration or home
rule in many dorms, and that

they have been legally bypassed
by the President.

Progress seems slow because
of the many peripheral ques-
tions which must he answered,
because of the number oi pro-
posals made to the committee
by students and faculty to be
considered, and because of the
small amount of time which
may he devoted to these prob-
lems, Limited to one hour a
Week, discussions are not al‘
lowed to develop to such an ex-
tent that much can be accomp
llshed: Mrs Pollak freely admite
ted that little has been accomp
lished in the last few sessions.

Why do they not have more
meetings? The answer is the
limited amount of time mem<
hers can give to their task. The
student members, each thu
head at an important student
organization. have responsibil-
ities for numerous other tasks
which prevent them from de-
voting greater attention to
problems of the committee.
Faculty members also feel bur-
dened by other responsibilities.

A committee as important as
this one, a liaison between Stu-
dents, iaculty, and the Presi-
dent, with power over decisions
in which students have a vital
interest, should be able to act
more quickly and with less
Confusion than this one has.
Possibly the students on the
committee should not be indi<
Viduals who have so little tims
to spend working with it. Also,
because the interest groups in«
valved can and do bypass the
procedures of the committeeI
its decisions seem to have
limited authority. Perhaps if
the workings oi the Student Ai-
iairs Committee were stream-
lined, iuture problems would be
entrusted to its care.
