Young Dems Sponsor Conference
To Consider Shaff Plan Sunday

Dave Evans, President of
the Grinnell Young Democrats,
has announced plans for the
antieshaff Plan Conference and
. orkshop to be held on cam-
pus this Sunday. The confer-
ence is sponsored by the Young
Democratic Clubs of Iowa and
by the Grinnell College Young
Democrats. All sessions will be
held in Younker Lounge and
will be open to the college com-
munity at no charge.

The Shaff Plan is a proposed
form of reapportionment that
has been passed by two con-
Secutive sessions of the Iowa
Legislature. Iowans will go to
the polls on December 3 to
register their approval or dis-
approval.

The Iowa Young Demo-
crats have openly opposed

the shaft proposal. They
have contended that the new
legislation will merely estab-
lish a rural-dominated House
and will continue to allow a
small percentage of the pop-
ulation to block the efforts of
an underrepresented major-
lty.

Sunday's Conference will
concern pre<election and elec-
tion day tactics to be employed
by the Anti-Shaft forces. Fea-
tured will be speeches by
Frank Nye, 'rssociate Editor of
the Cedar Rapids Gazette,
Vern Davis and Jack Lewis.
President and Treasurer re-
spectively of the Iowa Feder»
ation of Labor. AFLVCIO, and
C. Edwin Gilmour, (political
science) member of Iowans
Against the Shﬂff Plan.
