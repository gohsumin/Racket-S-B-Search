Winning Gridders
Get Third Shutout

By Pete Staben

The Grinnell Pioneers led by
Quarterback Barry Anderson
fond a. tight defense defeated a
tough Lawrence ball club 21-0
Saturday on Ward Field. Ander-
on augmented his usual bril-
liant passing game with roll
outs to keep the Lawrence de-
ense off-balance and allow
three scores. In notching their
third straight shut—out. the Plo-
£12” d a f e n s a limited the
‘ i 'ngs to only 135 total yards
. hile the
ained 336.

' l The defense, for the first
ime, showed a home crowd
hat they could not only contain

Grinnell offense

e ground gain, but that the
Eoneer pass defense has be-
ome quite respectable, Fine
go he n 5 iv e performances by
enny Hanssen and Paul Thur-
ston were the highlight of the
’game. Time and again Thurston
and Hanssen threw the Law»
k‘ence quarterback for losses,
zach time stopping a crucial

, , iking drive.
i The first quarter was all de-
I'ense, with neither team able
to move the ball, The Pioneers
penetrated as far as the Law-
tence 29, but they were forced
'to punt. The second quarter
roved a different story as
rinnell dominated play, scor-
ing twice and threatening a
third time.
{ Barry Anderson took the ball

e Pioneers to paydirt in ten
lays. The drive was high-
ighted by the passing and run-

Soccer Team Overpowers Shimer

Good Teamwork

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell soccer team,

combining a sticky defense with
a persistent offense, overpow-
ered Shimer last Saturday 50.
The defense kept Shimer from
starting a sustained attack and
the offense, lacking the scoring
punch or absent Vincent Anku,
kept pestering Shimer’s de-
fense, forcing mistakes which
were converted into Grinnell
goals.
' Grinnell’s offense began ap-
plying pressure in the first
quarter with only brief inter<
ludes when Shimer had the ball.
Fred Miller scored the first
goal near the end of the quarter
climaxing a long attack on the
Shimer goal.

The second quarter found
Grinnell taking advantage of

Creates Shuloul

two Shimer miscues. Ted Cole
took an errant pass from a
Shimer player and scored,
Later when the Shimer goalie
lost control of the ball after a
Grinnell shot, Felix Lungu took
it and scored to give Grinnell
a 3-0 half-time lead.

Frank Chilingulo scored the
only goal of the third quarter
on a penalty shot. Ted Cole

scored his second goal in the
fourth quarter when the Shimer
goalie lost control of the ball
again. allowing Cole to kick it
in the net.

Saturday‘s game was a real
team win for Grinnell. By add-
ing highvscoring Vincent Anku
to the lineup, Grinnell should

now be tough competition for

anybody during the rest of the
season.

lntrasquod Run

‘ By Dick Ulrich

The freshman distance barn
riel‘s Continued to paint a bright
outlook for Grinnell's future
cross country prospects as they
defeated the varsity squad, 27-
29, on Homecoming day. The
yearlings. and the entire pack,
were paced over the three mile
course by John Sharpe in the
time of 16:30. Sharpe had pre»
Viously set a Grinnell freshmen
two mile record with the time
of 10:08. Finishing second and
third were the varsity’s Bruce
Beckord and Steve Brintnall.
The fourth spot was captured
by Galen Bollinger, a sopho-
more transfer student running
for the freshmen, and behind
him came Bob Grant who also
Carried the freshmen banner.
The Varsity’s Andy Bushnell

.and Clyde Smith came in sixth

and seventh while freshmen
Doug Dray, John Bilstrom,
and Darrell Dunham placed
eighth, ninth, and tenth respec-
tively.

The inter-squad meet was
marred by injuries as Coach
Dick Young’s varsity squad
was without the services of its
top two runners. Rod Brown
and Captain Paul Patterson.
With only four men running,
the varsity was automatically
given a last place It is doubt-
ful that either Brown or Patter-
son will be ready in time for
the conference meet,
