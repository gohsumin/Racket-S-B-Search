The Pioneers will be trying to
avenge the earlier loss to Beloit
and then try to victimize Coe tor

the Pioneers and the Carls freely

Swimmers Hurt
By Lontz’s Burn

Sprinter Bill Lontz may be left
home When the Grinnell swim—
mers match strokes with Knox in
a Midwest Conference dual at
Galesburg, 111., Saturday.

Lontz is currently limited to
out - of . the . pool conditioning
because of a pair of burned hands,
the result of a laboratory acci-
dent. The bandages are to be tak-
en oit Friday, but even it the jun<
ior is given the go ahead signal,
he will have missed a full week
at practice.

If Lontz can’t make the trip to
Knox, Coach Irv Simone will have
only live swimmers available for
action and will probably have to
sacrifice both relay units to concen-
trate on the individual events.

Leading the Pioneers will be
Ken Adelman who remained unA

500 freestyle against the Oles.

Hero of the 4545 Win over St.
Olaf was sophomore Rick Seifert.
He placed third in the breast-
stroke, the next to the last event
of the meet, and then with only
about five minutes of rest an-
chored Grinnell‘s winning free-
style relay team in the final race
or the day. The eight points Seifert
helped to secure in the two events
were just enough for the Pioneers
to Win.

Drake Meet Next
For Track Squad

Grinnell‘s trackrnen, who pep
iormed “about up to expecta-
tions” while placing third behind
Iowa and Bradley in triangular
action last weekend, will compete
in the Drake Invitational in Des
Moines tomorrow.

“Most of the boys came close
to what i had hoped for in the
triangular," according to Coach
Dick Young. “Several of the run-
ners turned in fairly good times
for this stage at the season, but
our lack of practice in the field
events was clearly evident.”

Jeri Langham and John Kelsey
paced the Pioneers each gaining a
second and third on the track.
Steve Brintnall and Rick M204
Dowell also did a good job in run-
ning ‘events.

Young will take his full squad
to Drake and will run them under
the Pioneer Athletic Club banner,

Seeing action in addition to
Langham. Kelsey, Brintnall, and
MacDoweIl will be runners Rick
Faxon, Spencer Clark. Doug Dray
and Jim Murtfeldt, and fieldmen
Tom Wood. Walt Neal, Jon Bus-
well, and Tom Russell,

The already thin ranks were
further depleted this week when
Jim Miller the school’s record
holder in the shot put, dropped on
the squad.

Gl'innell will also be represented
by six ireshmen—runners Brian
Barnes. Dave Bray. A1 Cloud.
Mike Hanson, and Al Heimann.
and fieldman Roger Bryant. This
