Try i‘o Recover Aii‘er Ripon Loss

Injured Pioneers to Meet Knox

By Jim Fish ‘

The Grinnell varsity football
team will lly for its ﬁrst u-inl
oi the season tomorrow as they‘
_ travel to Knox College, Gales-
burg, lll. Grinnell will be out
to avenge their 3470 defeat sut.‘
fel'ed at the hands of Ripon in‘
last Saturday's season opener. l
Grinncll was hit hard by in-‘
juries in this ﬁrst game at Rip—l
on, Offensive tackle Eric Miller;
will be out {or
weeks with a shoulder separa-
tion. Halfbacks Chip Clarke and
Elston Bowers and tackle Pete
Staben suffered sprained knees,
It is doubtful that Bowers andl
Staben will make the trip to,
Galesburg. Clarke will probably
see limited action Other Pine
neers being slowed down by in-
juries are Art Weyrauch and
Denny Homerin.

According to Grinnell Coach
Ed Bowers, “I think we have
been able to correct many or
our mistakes. However, we
still have it long way to go.
Our oifense is still sputtering
anti [ just may make some big
personnel changes to try to

get it started" l ,

According to this plan, a lot
of new faces will be in the
starting lineup tomorrow Sched. :
uled to start in the offensive
backﬁeld are three sophomores:
John Shierliolz and Dave Syn-t:
horst at the halibacks. and Davey
lmes at tullback. Starting attv
quarterback will be veteran ;
Dick Orchard,

Replacing the injured tackle,
Eric Miller will prot bty be
John Montgomery, a 215 pound
sophomore, At the other tackle
will be Rein Saral. At the ends‘
will be Dave Gaugcr and Jim
McKlveen, at the guards, e0»
captains Steve War-rick and
Pete Heinzelinan, and at cen—
ter, Morgan Mrchel.

Mike Dewitt has looked good
at end this week in practice-
and will probably sec action at
ottensive end. Coach Bowers
said that tor the Knox game
he might run DcWiLt at right
end and shiit Jim McKlvcen to
tackle.

Football competition has been

The Animal’s predictions were
partially shattered this week
when Clark pinned an 18-13
loss on Dibble in what might
prove to be the crucial contest
of the year. Gates continued its
winning ways with a 1+0 vic—
tory over Cowtes and Lhetefol'e

instead ot prac ng their serv-

they were concentrating on pro-

that Just isn’t consistent with the
