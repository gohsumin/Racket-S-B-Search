While all three of the candidates for
SGA President seem serious and com-
petent and interesting, the editors of the
Scarlet & Black can support only one of
them — Tom Thomas.

Both Dan Cheifetz and Grant Cran-
dall admit openly that Thomas has had
more experience in student government
than either of them. And, as Thomas has
been repeatedly telling respective halls,
this Spring is going to be no time to gain
experience and meet people.

Thomas authored the new Constitu-
tion which Just passed the student body
by an overwhelming majority, The edi-

tors of the S&B believe that — of the
three choices — only Tom Thomas un-
destands the new Constitution well
enough to implement it.

The 5&3 urges you to elect Tom
Thomas SGA President.
