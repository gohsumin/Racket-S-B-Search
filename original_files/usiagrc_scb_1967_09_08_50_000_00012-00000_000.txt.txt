diihl! MATTER

By Bill Gray

There is nothing quite so pathetic as an I, Mr writer laboring
over an article when no I. M. events have occurred. But although
tennis and football are still a week away, Mac Frield and the en-
virons have seen more thall their share or feet practicing the in-
tricacies of the down and out. After viewing some practices, i can
yell that some of my predictions may prove to be rather absurd
by the time the season closes.

It is reputed that Rawson has a freshman who is faster than
the average Grinnellian, and with the advent of ﬂag rather than
touch football, the running game becomes more important. Raw-
son. if it can find a quarterback, should prove to be a power to
be reckoned with,

Smith and Clark played a rookie game which Smith won
rather handily. This is believed to have prompted the late evening
mining program which Clalk instituted last Monday night.

South, North and Langan have been practicing but they seem
to be using cement blocks for hands and. as a result, preseason
opinion has them filling the bottom of the league. Gates, which
was so good last year, looks to have fallen on hard times and
could have trouble winning even half of its games,

With Rick Bair (as in Bear) wearing in at a svelte 225 and
the likes of Roger Able carrying added poundage, Dibble should
Outweigh the opposition by about 30 pounds per man as they at-
tempt to go through their sixth straight year without incurring
more than one loss.

Cowles, West. and East are somewhat unknown quantities but
appear to be neither very good nor very bad. in any event, it's
D-Day minus one week.

TliE KIBBITZER

By John Ra:

Psyche bids can be a powertul weapon in your bidding ar-
lenal when you are careful to control partner’s range and ease of
response. in the following hand. South elected to open with one
diamond. a psychological asking bid, looking for diamond support
from partner in an anticipated nartrump contract. South was not
afraid of any of the possible responses: to two diamonds he was
prepared to bid two no-trump. e signoit; to either two clubs or
three diamonds he was prepared to bid three noti‘ump. Four or
five diamonds, the two dangerous bids that North could have
made. were abated because the partnership had agreed not to
jump an opening bid to the tour or tive level, Furthermore, South
Was not afraid of having the hand passed out since one diamond is
an easy bid to respond to or overcall. North made the correct re-
sponse of one spade. intending to make a delayed single raise in
diamonds signiiying 10-12 points and diamond support ~ too much
for a two diamond bid and too little for a three diamond game go-
ing bid. 0n the second round of bidding. South again intentionally
misrepresented his hand by bidding two clubs. At this point South
reasoned that if partner had a iive card spade suit he would re-
bid it and game would be played in {our spades. li North didn’t,
however. South intended to discourage a dangerous club opening
lead against a no»trump game, After North’s delayed raise in dia<
monds. South bid three no-trump which he had designed all along,
confident of a favorable lead. He counted 28 points. with possible
Suit fits in spades or diamonds. West hardly hesitated before
Opening the heart three. From the bidding West counted at least
eight cards in the minor suits in South's hand. Giving South two
spades. this would leave him a three card heart stopper. Assum<
ing that South held the A Q 10 x in Clubs and that South counted
upon turning two Club tricks, West; dared not give South a “tree
finesse" on an opening club lead. West chose what he thought
was the favorable “unbld major” and thus the deception was
complete. ‘ ‘

BOWERS’ BOYS GET READY FOR GRID ACTION

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Thirty-five men have come
out for iootball including all
but one available lettermen.
Coach Edd Bowers said there
is a good team attitude as the
squad will attempt to bounce
back from last year’s poor sea
son.

injuries, hard luck and a
poor aerial attack and defense
were the reasons for the 2-6
record. This year the gridders
are working on better passing
to supplement the strong run-
ning attack, Coach Bowers has
a heavy backfield with 205
pound fullback Dick Lamb pack-
ing the most punch. Lamb was
the leading ground gainer in
1965 but was sidelined most of
last fall with an injury

A blow to the team is the
loss of senior hack Jon Buswell
who is involved in an oft-cam-
pus study project. Last year
he was the leading ground gain-
er for the Pioneers with 383
yards Back again this year is
Rich Weeks who was second in
rushing with 355 yards and led
the passing statistics with 252
yards.

The newcomer most likely to
gain a ﬁrst string spot; is Steve
Carroll, a transfer last year
who'll be at center or tackle.
Other newcomers likely to see
considerable action are ends
Garry Bork and Bill Wedding
and backs Brent Dubach, Doug
Fink. and John Pederson. Du-
bach is a transfer'and the rest
are sophomores.

The first home game is a-
gainst St. Olaf Sept. 23. St. Olaf
is one of the toughest teams
in the conference but Bower’s
Boys promise to make it an
interesting game. Coach Bowers
hopes for a good student turn-
out for the game and feels that
this is a teanl of which the
student body can be proud,
