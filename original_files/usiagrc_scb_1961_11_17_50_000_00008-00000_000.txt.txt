Students Measure Radioactivity t:pESSn’ii‘iklﬁiplléi‘°tl
from Campus Rainwater Samples

by Staff Reporter

The radioactivity count of rain three to four times the highestl Dortunities of the

water samples taken on campus‘
has risen signiﬁcantly on at
least two dlﬁercnt occasions in;
the last several weeks, according
to Mike Schulhor, Cowles soph—i
more. i

Schullior is participating in a‘
radioactivity “monitoring pron,
grain" using a highly sellsitivo‘
scintillation counter. > The counts ,
do not approach “dangerous"
levels, however, Schulhof stress
ed.

He said the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
increase occurred Nov, 1, several‘
days after the Soviet 50-mega~',
ton nuclear explosion. A read-
ing or 450 micromicrocuries ovs
er the normal background count‘

or 1300 mmc’s was taken. l

Asecond substantial increase
was noted after last Monday’s l
rain. The count taken at that l
time was about 360 minc’s ‘
over the normal background 1

count.

Dr. william Sandman (phys-
icsl, adviser for the monitoring
program, made this comment on
the signiﬁcance of the increases:
“The increased radiation Counts
taken here are not significant
in that they forecast no imme-
diate effects which might Cause
biological damage. As to the
oiiects of increased radioactivity
in the area or genetics, no one
knows for sure yet—not cvcii,

Dr. Sandman, who lived in

Mendoza Speaks
To Frosh Women 3

The last of a series of Semid

nars for freshman women Was‘
given Wednesday afternoon in
Main lounge by Guillermo
Mendoza (biology). Hss topic
was. “The Balanced Diet of Lib-
eral Arts.” l

Mendoza talked about the

purpose or a liberal education‘made for the annual Christmas,

and how a liberal arts college
differs from a specialized college.

Also participating in the disul
cussion was a pancl at three,
Grinnell women, They wcrcl

and Hedda Haymond represent—l
ing thc sopbomorc, junior lind‘
senior classes. i

mal background count “This is

count we've taken here,” he
pointed out.

The monitoring program be-
gan in late October when
Schulhof, Jim Wolrson and
Don Wheeler started making
daily checks on the radioac—
tivity count in the atmosphere,
dust, ground and rain watch

l Counts monitored in rainwater

have been largest because
the rain droplets collect radio»
active dust particles as they
ran through passing dust
clouds

Data collected by the Grinnell
monitoring team has been cor—
roborated in part by informa-

tion received (rain the U 3.,

Weather Bureau conﬁrming the
presence of large dust clouds,

-possibly radioactive in the,

Grinnell area at the times the
count increases were reported.

Further information is being
sought from the Atomic Energy
Commission which will enable
them to convert their measure-
ments into terms such as roent-
gens, which are measurements
of actual bodily damage caused
by radiation.

The monitoring program will
be continued through next
spring when increased rainfall
is likely. ,
