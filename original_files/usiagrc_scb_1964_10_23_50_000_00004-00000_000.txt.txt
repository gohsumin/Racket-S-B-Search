Another aspect of the Le-
Moyne-Grinneil exchange pro-
gram can provide a rewarding,
challenging slimmer plus prac<
tice teaching credit for a few
selected Grindellians next sum-
mer. Success of last summer's
"Humanities Seminar” points to
a similar program for the sum-
mer of l965. Seniors Kristi Wil~
liams and Dodi Holcher were
last year’s participants.

The seminar at LeMoyne was
a part of a new program de-
veloped by graduate students at
iYaie University. Students from
.Yale taught similar seminars
throughout the South, designed
to aid in overcoming the ”Cul-
tural lag” in the education of
Southern Negroes. The eighty
Students at the LeMoyne sem-
inar were chosen from the Ne»

ro high schools in Memphis.
. hey ranged from those enter-
ing their sophomore year to
those who had just graduated,
but the majority were between
their junior and senior years.

Three students from Yale
taught courses in history,
speech, and philosophy, aided
by Miss HolCher and Miss Wil-
liamsl The two girls from Grin-
neil, and one from Yale, lived
in a college-owned house near
the campus, which is in'the
heart of the Negro district in
Memphis They were paid $200
plus room and board for the
iive- week seminar from money
given for the program by var-

ous foundations. They have al»
so received six Grinneil credits
tor practice teaching, after sub-
mitting reports on their work
by the Yale students they work-
ed under and also the LeMoyne
professor who set up the semi—
liar.

The courses were taught on a
college lreshman level. All stu-
‘dents took each of the classes,
and met together for a fourth
hour assembly period. This
hour was usually devoted to
lectures or tours relevant to the
courses. All of the LeMoyne
campus facilities were avail-
able to the seminar particia
pants, and most of them stayed
on campus the entire day. A
'drama workshop was held in

die afternoon for those who
were interested. Most of the
others used the library facilities
or swimming pool. -

The content of all the classes
was designed to develop skill in
communication of ideas and
the ability to deal with abstract

concepts. The history course
covered European history from
the French Revolution through
the causes of World War I. Em-
phasis, was placed on ideas
causes, and effects, rather than
names and dates. Plato was the
focal point of the philosophy
classes. The relevance of his
ideas to modern problems was
emphasized throughout. The
speech course concentrated
specifically on the development
of communication skills. Criti-
cal reading, and the writing and
delivering of speeches were the
main activities.

“The kids were remarkably
motivated, interested, intelli-
gent,” quick and receptive,"
Miss H o l c h e r commented.
"They were a joy to teach,”
Miss Williams added. Each stu-
dent filled out an evaluation of
the seminar at the end of the
session, and the idea that five
weeks had not been enough

 

The mechanical details of a
semester at LeMoyne are under
the guidance of Dale B. Terry
(Registrar). Arrangements are
quitedetinite now, and the plan
is ready to begin as soon as
Grinneil students show their in-
terest.

Students who spend a semes-
ter at LeMoyne will receive
transfer credits toward. their
Grinneli degree, These will ap~

\ ply much as summer school

credits do: the hours would be
added to the student’s record
but the grades earned will not
be added into his cumulative
average. The normal course
load, as planned by the com<
mittee which set up the ex-
change program, would be
three LeMoyne courses plus a
Grinneil independent project
This, of course, is a flexible ar~
rangement, and could be
changed to meet the needs of
the individual student He
would also be asked to submit
an evaluation of his experience
to the committee in charge
within a month of his return to
Grinneil, These evaluations will
be used to guide adjustments
of the academic mechanics of
the program and in the selec-

time appeared on almost all of
the papers,

Both girls considered their
reception in the school and the
town to have been very friend-
ly. They were entertained fre-
quently by various groups in
the town, bouu Negro and white.
The press was also very com-
plimentary about the ii v e
Northerners and their work.
Some hostility was to u n d
among the townspeople at first,
but most of this disappeared as
people realized that this group

'of college students was not

working on voter registration.
Although Negro-white relation-
ships are said to be among the
best in the South, the question
of voter registration is still
a very emotion-packed one.
Speaking at the YWCA coffee-
hour on LeMoyne, and during
informal discussions, both Miss
Holcher and Miss Williams are
completely enthusiastic about
their five weeks at LeMoyne

Applications for a semester
at LeMoyne should be turned
in to Terry, although the actual
selection will be made by a faca
uity-administration committee.
Applicants would usually have
to be sophomores or juniors,
although seniors may be con-
sidered in unusual circuma
stances. The applicant’s grade
pomt‘ will not be weighed as
heavily as it is in most ex-
change programs, although he
should be well within the re-
quirements of a Grinneil de<
gree candidate. The actual se—
lection will be based much
more upon subjective factors
and the°student’s reasons for
applying. Applications should
include a statement of purpose
(what he expects to accomplish
and contribute), a proposed
list of courses to be taken, and
an outline of the area of re-
search for the independent pro-
ject. They should be in to Terry
by Nov. 1 for those who desire
to attend LeMoyne second se-
mester.

The financial arrangements or
the exchange provide that the
student will pay Grinneil tui-
tion costs and room and board
at the LeMoyne rates, These
will vary according to arrange-
ments, but should average
about $200 for the semester.
Barring any unusual circum-
stances, a student’s scholarship
and loan would be applied to
the tuition he would owe at
Grinneil. Accommodations will
be arranged individually, but
will probably be in one of two
college/owned homes near or
on the campus It is possible
that a student may be able to
live with a family in the neigh-
borhoodl Up to four Grinneil
students will be allowed to at-
tend LeMoyne in a given se-
mester.

LeMoyne College catalogues,
brochures, and further informa-
tion are available for the ask-
ing in Terry’s office, Burling 2.
