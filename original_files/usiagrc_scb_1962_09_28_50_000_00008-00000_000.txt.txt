Last Saturday Cornell's del'endin Conference Cllallk
pion cross-country team was handed i first loss in IS
starts by upstart Lawrenc. Even though Cornell run-

Bill Winter, St. Olaf’s all-Conference football player.
last year on both offense and defense, has written another
chapter in the long- history of smalchollege players making
good in professional football. . i

WINTER CAME to the New York Giants this year on?
a tryrout contract: as their 18th draft choice. Quickly he.
established himself as a formidable defensive player and has;
started ever since in a corner linebacker slot. 1

But even though he was a starter in the fall practice‘
games, Winter had to really struggle in the pre-season prac-i
tice to make himself noticed. i

It was during these early fall work outs that I spoke .
with Winter. At this point Winter was anything but con- i
fident about making the squad, much less the starting 1
team. He had this to say, “Either you have what they i
want, or you don’t—you can’t tell. There was a guy who ‘
was on last year’s taxi; he looked real good to me, but he
was out the first wee .” i

Probably the most surprising comment Winter had to‘
make was that he felt that New York’s training program
was easier than he had experienced at St. Olaf. This was
because the Oles couldn’t accomplish in several hours \Vllilt‘
