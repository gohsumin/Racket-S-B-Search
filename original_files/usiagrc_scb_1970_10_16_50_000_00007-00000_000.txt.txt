CommiffeesAcfive

The main function of theStu*
dent Publications Committee
is to oversee and provide gui-
dance for all communication
media financed by the college.
Presently the committee has
jurisdiction over the Scarlet
and Black, Kch, and the lit’
erary magazine.

In addition, members appoint
editors and business mana-
gers of the publications, and
Station manager, business
manager, and chief engineer
of KDIC. They take responsi-
bility for any legal action and
also set broad policy on fin-
ancial and business manage-
ment. Funds come from the
SGA and soliciting of ads.

According to Mr. David Jor'
clan, chairman, the committee
does not censor. Members
determine the broad limits of
policy. The committee inclur
des Mr. Jim Hottois, Mr.
Henry Klein, Clayton Lee,
Mike Lipsman, and Sue Orinr
gel.

They have appointed Greg
Butcher and Jim Friend as
editor and business manager,
respectively, of the Swrlet
and Black. The KDICpositions
were filled last spring.

Mr. Jordan said that, altlr
ough it is too late for a year-
book this year, the commit»
tee is looking for people in’
terested in starting one next
year. He also mentioned the
possibility of publishing the
literary magazine several tie
mes a year with the Scarlet
and Black.

The GDIC this week issued
the following bulletin concer-
ning changes in the order of
call for induction:

President Nixon recently is-
sued an executive order af~
fecting the order of call for
induction. While only a few
men will be affected by it, its
provisions should be common
knowledge.

According to the new order
of call, there are seven class
ses of priority for induction.
Only men in the first three of
these seem likely tobe called.

Class 1) Volunteers whohave
not attained the age of 26 in
the sequence in which tthey
have volunteered for induc~
tion.

Class 2) Non-volunteers in
the Extended Priority Selec-
tion Group (see below) in the
order of their lottery numbe
ers.

Class 3) Nonrvolunteers in
the First Priority Selection
Group in order of their lot:
tery numbers. Probably only
about half the men in this gre
oup can expect to be called
next year.

The Extended Priority is
something new. It consists of
registrants who on Dec. 31
were members of the First
Priority Group whose lottery
numbers had been reachedbut
who had not been issued in-
duction orders.

Men in this group will be eli-
gible to receive induction or-
ders up until April 1 of the
year following their entry into
the First priority group. In
Other words, if a man enters
the First Priority group in
November of this year with a
number which has already
been called, but does not re*

ceive an induction order be
cause his board’s quota is al-
ready filled with higher num-
bered men, he may receive an
induction order in the first
three months of 1971, and, in
fact, must be called before
any men in the 1971 First
Priority Group.

The other new development
is that a man who reachesage
26 without having received an
induction order will not get
one, even if his case had been
on appeal at the time he be-
come 26. So, barring agen-
eral mobilization, 26 is the
deadline.

People with questions about
this order, or about any facet
of the draft are encouraged
to come and receive any coun-
seling they may need.

Group Announces
landscape Plans

The College landscaping
committee, made up of Mr.
Graham, Mr. Zirkle, Mr. Ha»
Wu, and Mr. lambie and ads
vised by Mr. L. Herbert Ty-
ler, a professional consultant,
sees its principle work this
fall in landscaping the new
physical education complex.

The committee members we-
‘re appointed by President
Leggett and are aided inplanr
ning and carrying outprojects
by fourteen students, whom
Mr. Graham termed "a re-
serve of muscles". They are
operating on an initial budget
of $30,000.00 donated by par-
ents and friends of the college
for the specific purpose of
replacing the fifty or so elms
lost each year to the blight,
and for otherwise beautifying
the campus.

Although their responsibili-
ties include campus lighting,
.sidewalk planning, and ornar
mentation of the campus, the
committee members are con-
centrating for the moment on
planting trees. In particular,
they plan an extensive wind-
break around the new track,
using a double row of trees:
a row of fifteen-foot cedars
encircled by a low euonymus
hadge which will turn a bril‘
liant red in the fall.

The committee envisions a
sculpture garden outside the
Fine Arts Building sometime
in the future, and although
they have net yet acquired
any sculptures, the commits

.tee has begun planning in an

ticipation.

Plans for a marker on the
site of the old Heating Plant
chimney also continue to ger-
mlnate.
