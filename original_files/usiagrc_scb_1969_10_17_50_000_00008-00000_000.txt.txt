tells a story and asks what is
meant by theatre.

Next Tuesday night, a tall,

will step into Darby Gynlna<

ing the past few years, Pete
Seeger’s strong but gentle
voice, and his 5-string banjo,
have been heard everywhere
from folk concerts to peace
crusades to conservation cam-
paigns.

He started singing in tho

Films by Gosleau, Resnais, Welles

By Jon Stein

This weekend’s films are
“The Golden Fish." “Night and
Fog," and ”Macbeth.” They
will be shown as a block all
9:45 pm. tonight and at. 10100
poms tomorrow in the South
Lounge, The program will be
shown again on Sunday evening
at 8:00 pm in ARH.

“The Golden Fish" is in
twenty-minute iilm produced by
Jacques costesu and directed
by Edward Sechan, It Won the
Critics International Prize of
the Cannes Film Festival in
1963. The film is an intriguing
fantasy about the affection
between a young boy and his
pet goldfish. An imaginative
musical score and photography
tell the story without narration
or dialogue,

“Night and Fog" is Alain
Resnais’ powerful iilm on the
concentration camp universe.
Granting great force to the
enormity and relentless horror
of the subject matter itself.
Resnais nevertheless manages
to create even greater power
through his remarkable

technical Skill, The film con-
tains almost constant coun-
terpoint: between voice and
music. living and dead, still and
motion picture, past and
present.

“Macbeth" was the first film
Orson Welles made after ”Citi-
zen Kane." in 1948, alter
“Citizen Kane" failed at the
box office, Welles undertook a
scandalous enterprise: under
the auspices oi Republic Pic-
tures, a studio devoted to
producing lDWrbudget westerns,
Welles filmed this outrageous
version of ”Macbeth" in s span
of twenty-three days—including
a day of retakest The final
product was an imaginative
and exciting piece of cinema;
however, it bore very little re-
semblance to anything Shake-
speare had ever written with
Welles' own role as a thane be-
ing unintelligible in Scottish
burr. Though “Macbeth" was
Wells' first real disaster at the
box oilice, it has genuine merit
and is well worth seeing if only
to gain further insight into the
greatest ”identity crisis tiitn"
of the year.

What's Sccger’s style? Well,
it's basically his own 7 some
times gay; sometimes sad,
high-pitched and lonely; one
moment whimsical; the next
moment ironic. He draws from
a variety of songs, traditions
and backgrounds. He knows and
respects both the musical tra<
ditlons and life patterns behind
the songs # songs ranging
from “Oh, What a Beautiful
City," to “I Can See a New
Day," songs that ask that sol-
diers and cement be replaced
by sentiments expressing life
and love.
