Boo y Will leave for Colorado;
Taught Here for Twelve Years

By JUDY SCOTT

“You might say I lm leaving Grin-
nell because leaving is so difﬁcult,"
commented Dick Baay (German) "The
larther almg in any business the deeper
this roots grow and these have been
very good and exciting years lot me,"

Baily has recently accepted the dip
pointment of chairman In the deparb
ment of German and Russian at Col0v
rado College in Colorado Springs, Colo-
rado. He will begin his new job in the
June summer session. A replacement
appointment at Grinnell will not be
made until later next year. The pre-
sent German department members will
drop any outside loads, such as Human-
ities courses, to temporarily fill in the
vacant place left by Baay.

Outside of his role as professor, Baay
has been personally involved in campus
lntemational Relations and Chapel ac-
tivities, In regard to these areas he
sees that a time of change is coming.
“Na progmm,” he said, ”can go for
a long time without staleness setting in
somewhere.

Ho added that an appointment tor ll
new college chaplain should not be
made until student and administrative
desires are made clear.

Looking back over his 12 yours at
crtnnell, Baily stated that the perspec-
tive was not really sufficient to com-
men! an any major changes in student
attitudes He did say that ”with the Bali—
bre of students at Grinnell there should
be evident more intellectual ferment
and independent. study

“This need not be promoted by in-
stitutionaliztng independent study as a
part at the curriculum,” Cnntinued Belay,
“but hoth students and taculty should
lake it upon themselves As it is, stu-
dents do talk about it but they shy
away from it."

Reasons for this lack at independent
study, Baay felt, was the great amount
or energy and mutlvatlon needed and
the time element which may be lack<
tug at Grinnell tn allow for successful
independent work. H such work could
ever become an integml part oi tho

said.

“Without necessarily comparing it
with other institutions. it med: to g.

gram just in order to keep alive. I
think students should play the greater
part in participating in the planning of
changes. Th: faculty does not prevent
them. i would lilt: to sea them concern
themselves, not with lesser issues as
open-opens and parking lots. but with
the more substantial elements of Grim

Wright Leaves for Seminary
Alter His Year at Grinnell

Edward C. Wright (philnsophy and re-
ligion) will terminate soon his seminar
work at Grinnell—work which has ex-
tended far outside tho Sunday chapel
services,

“lnterchang: with the small groups,"
commented Wright, “has made the lit-
to my being here.” he referred to his
active involvement with colleagues,
study groups, faculty discussions, tha
Board of Religion, French club, the Des
Molnar project and REACH. Above all,
he has helped to alleviate the langrfelt
need for counselling at Grinnell.

Wright commented that he was
”amazed at how Eldridge had gotten
along," and that perhaps a permanent
twoman operation was needed — if not
anoLher chaplain, some other means at
counselling.

His whole purpose or being at Grinnell.
Wright slated. was to get to know the
students. He has made a Very strong
connection between Sunday services and
communication With people during the
Week.

“Good dialogue should be carried on
among students, laculty and chaplain
for the relatiomhip between chapel serv-
ice: and the community to have its op-
timum effect," he said,

He observed that the worship service
could be improved, students and faculty
becoming more inlormed and expressiv.
or their opinions and wants.

“Worship is something built on I In-
ditlon and reworked in the contemporary
idiom," ha said. He commented thtt th-
Chapel committee had started a respon-
libla leevnluation of this problzm.

Thu most meaningiul servio. during
the year Wright round to in the Jewish
Seder, held in Gardner lounge during th-
Jewish Passover. HI felt I movt awards
“the joyful spirit oi celebntion” ex-
pressed than would be a worthwhile goal
tor Sunday chapel. Also ha observed that
communion has not been a pan of tho
chapel fur a long time.

“If people are serious at all Ibout be-
ing Christlan there is something in the

communion that brings them together,"
he stated. “A strong understanding it!
tradition will help any search that stu-
dents may be making and which centerl
around Sunday morning service."
Wright heads soon for Andover Newto-
Theological School ut Newton Center,
Mass, to work toward a masters degrec
in sacrcd theology Following this n
wtll begin “long range" parish wot-k.

Parking lot Problem
Faces Further Study

Plans tor the addition ul parking facili-
ties nn the Grinnell campus will receiv-
lurther study as a result at student pm
tests and meetings with adminislrativl
Dilicials.

All materials have been removed from
the area, which was to have been cun~
Verled to a 20-sp'dce parking lot, and
the only turmer action there will be is
the removal of the tree stump which
provided sitrin facilities for student pro-
testers.

A meeting of President Glenn Leggett
and students Tripp Kennedy, Susan Kiss.
Linda Seckelson, and Dick Wickstrom
resulted in the promise that plans tor
parking tucilities would be restudied
and that no actual work toward the com-
pletion or me lots would be done ovu-
thk summer.

During the meeting, Leggett statgi
that he was pleased with student con-
cern twel- the beauty of the campus. and
hoped that this concern would manila!
itself in regard to walking on the grass.

the feasibility of other parking mm
are now being considered, including th-
possibilities of lots on land surrounding
the college.

However, the possibility oi a lot in n

' position comparable to the protested lot

is being discouraged. Associate Dean
Richard Winters, in discussing possibl-
areas, stated, “I would not favor any
term of encroachment upon central cam-
pus areas tor the purpose or pat-kiug,"
