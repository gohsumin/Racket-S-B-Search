Forum Director Hawk cleans up South Lounge —

An open letter

Seniors admit visitations violations;

to Grinne" college suggesl increased open dorm:

We would like to bring up one of the
major aspects of the open dorm question,
one which frequently tends to be slighted
because of it’s controversial nature. Given
Grinnell’s present open~dorm policy, and
given that display of affection is a natural
result of male-female relationships, one is
faced with three alternatives: 1) One could
display affection in public. This, however,
is a great imposition on innocent bystand-
ers Would any single person venture into
the South Lounge after 1080? Does any-
one look forward to wendilig his way
through intertwined bodies at Haines or
Main door”! Perhaps most important, there
Is the embarrassment to the couples them
selves. 2) One could seek privacy on the
golf course or in a motel, The former is
cold and wet; the latter is not only expen-
sive, inconvenient, and undesirable, but

also is inappropiate for sexual relations
other than intercourse. 3) One could par-
ticipate in illegal open dorms, thereby
gaining muchrneeded privacy, but also in-
curring the risk of suspension,

The college policy on open dorms can-
not prevent illegal visitation. In the choice
between public or private display of affec-
tion, we have chosen private, thus violat-
ing college regulations. Students will con—
tinue to make this choice. We feel that
the integrity of the student and his right
to make personal decisions should be rec-
ognized and respected by the administra-
tion, Let us not base our considerations
of the open dorm question on a suspicious
attitude toward sex, but rather let us con-
sider those reasons for more opens which
would improve the social environment] and
benefit the campus as a whole.
