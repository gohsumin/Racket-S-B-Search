I think

an Issues

change,

Because the climate of concern
is strongly demanding- evaluation
of our community, student gov—
ernment will naturally devote
great effort toward meeting these
problems Yet concern knows no
boundaries; it does not limit it-
self. The scnse or community
that has its matrix on this cam.
pus extends beyond Grinnell.
When issues ot the larger com—
munity become relevant to the
Grinnell student, SGA must re—
spond to this concern, also.

The concern among students
now is primarily directed to.
ward campus problems; yet it
cannot accurately predict that it
will always be so.

The task next year is to re-
vitalize the dialogue on all is
sues. on all levels of the student
community.

Golden Promises Initiative in Four Areas

The SGA President, through
his knowledge oi overall campus
events and through his
ence, is responsible for evalu-
cting present S,G,A. programs
end ior initiating new ones.
There are tour major courses of
action that I would follow.

(1) A strong, permanent cur—
i:culum committee should be cs-
tablished. it would consist oi
cnc maior irom each depart
meat and some freshman, an
'irould sci-e to evaluate the
Junior Liberal Arts Examiner
ton, graduation requirements,
and the interim session. This
committee would form a line ot
communication from students to
tie iaculty and administration.
,idach‘ representative oi a major

ould establish a simil' evalus
eting group on the departmental
level,

A student, iacnlty. and ad—
ministration encampment

inﬂu- i

would he held next year to
discuss topics ranging from
the meaning of a liberal edus
cation to questions of adm
sions policy. Also, students
would he encouraged to take
the initiative in gathering Sills
dents and iacnity together in-
iornialiy.

(2) Because the Executive‘
Cabinet directs the A,W,S.Board
and the c. of HP. in their ch»-
orcement ot regulations,
would initiate investigations to
determine ii students aic satis-
fied wtih regulations and with
enforcement, ii students are dis-
satisfied and desire a particular
ichange, then I would, as the
representative of the students,
present to the administration the
reasons tor student discontent
and suggestions tor a change.

A schedule oi the speakers and
