The Memory Compus'Sti/I Exists
0 Canvas In The Physical Plant

By Kris Nash

For those who are intrigued by
what might have been. there is a
fascinating canvas hanging In one
ofﬁce of the physical plant. it is
the Grinnell “Campus of the Fu-
ture," an artist's representation
or a layout which was the result
of “a decade of car to] study by
appropriate committees, in coop-
oration with engineers, architects,
and landscape experts," It was
finalized in 1949 and published in
the November issue of ahe Alumni
S&B, while Samuel N. Stevens was
the acting president or the college.

The A5“! explained that the
dream plan “in no way destroys

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ‘memory’ campus but pre-
serves the spirit, the atmosphere,
the compactness, and the land-
marks, and beautifies, enhances,
and meets the modern needs of
present-day Grinnell.” It was in-
tended to accommodate 1,000 resi-
dent students and 100 off-campus
dwellers.

The portrayal of the campus has
the appearance of an aerial view,
but lacks the accuracy in certain
relative distances and topographle
cal features.

North campus was shown intact
as it exists today, with the excep-
tion of the Norris halls. South
campus, too, was identical with
the present, but for a wide porch
on the south wall 01 Mears and
the addition of a tower at the en-
trance of Loose, connected with
a large structure intended to he

rambling building rather than its

every 25-30 years.

While Steere’s sermon Sunday
will concern Quakensm, he will
also discuss the Vatican in the
“teed-back” discussion session,
which will [allow the Sermon in
the Religious Activities Room in
Steiner Hall.

removed, and in its place a large
rountain threw bubbling spray into
the air of central campus

To the east of the fountain, in
the location which it now occupies,
lay the Bee buildings, but with
the significant addition of a build-
ing for applied arts along the pew
er plant's west wall, The physical
plant’s towering Smokestack was
conspicious by its absence.

Needless to say, the Grinnell
Forum was missing, and the old
union was not planned, either,
Taking their place was the Stu-
dent Center and Inn, an extensive
structure at the junction of High-
way 6 and Park Street, where the
Fine Arts Center is now, The Stue

dent Center and Inn included a
Wing tor offices, class rooms, and
work shops for the Congregation-
al-Christian Conference of lowai
The remainder of the Park
Street lineup — ARI-l, Herrick
Chapel, Carnegie and Steiner
Halls -— was present, but not pic-
tured was Goodnow, East of the
Student Center and Inn, along
Highway 6, stood historic Blair
Hall, a longtime fixture on the
Grinnell campus. Plans were to
leave the intricately architectured
exterior of Blair alone and to re
model the interior into an ad-
ministration building. Later, the
whole building was razed to make
room for Burling Library. '

Adjacent to Blair on the east
was to be a T-shaped editice
which was actually a combine.
[ion of two Structures —- a Fine
Arts building to house facilities
for art, music, speech, and drama,
and a LOGO-seat auditorium. These
two buildings seem to have been
similar to the Roberts Theater-
Fine Arts complex which stands
today, though they were consider
ably farther east.

A memorial archway to provide
entrance to the campus was drawn
just off Highway Six, between
Mears and the proposed building
[or Fine Arts, but east of the
Mi&Sl:.L. tracks. Tile arch was
“available for construction as a
class gift."

Random features that dlfier in»
terestiligly from today's campus
were the stationing of the ﬂag
pole before Blair Hall, next to the
highway, and the use of the soccer
field as a parking lot. In addition.
two incongruous-looking rows of
lights ﬂanked Ward Field, and the

 

,tenlatlve scheme was to smtch
l.il:i‘.»‘_ - ..

the location of the power plant
and 3&6 offices to the site of the
new intramural field, immediately
east. of the railroad tracks and
north of Tenth Avenue.

The ASRrB declared that the

"Campus 0! the Future" would
“contain all the educational facili-
ties necessary for the optimum
education of 1,100 men and wom-
en." But “optimums” obviously
change.
