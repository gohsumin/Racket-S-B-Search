Vocations for
Social Change

By CATHY JONES

For those graduating Seniors or lib.
erated underclnssmen who aren't inter-
ested in graduate school, “establish
ment” jobs, or government pacilication
programs, but are interested in social
change and survival, word has come
{mm a group of those conspiratorial,
change-oriented Caliiornia freaks about
how to do it.

A Catalog called “Vocations for Social
Change,” published monthly by a group
of people living together in Canyon,
Calif nia, contains listings of work pos<
sibilities with “movement" —— type
groups of all kinds across the country.

The California group espouses no
speciﬁc philosophy of social change, but
provides descriptions of employment op
portunities with groups whose philosu<
phies cover a broad range of thought and
ideology, As stated in the catalog, “We
do not want to become the General Hers
hey at the movement for social change,
“channelling" people into positions where
we feel they might be most effective.
We are trying to convince people that
they can have an impact on changing
society while earning a living and doing

work that fits their particular skills and
temperaments."

Most organizations can pay only sub<
sistenee salaries or else expect you to
find outside work ior support. but the
Vocations for Social Change people
themselves are proof that this can be
done very successfully. The catalog ot-
rers accounts of their own experiences,
bread recipes, advice on eeonomizing,
food stamp information and other impor-
tant tips on how to maximize your milli<
mal earnings and stay healthy. (“Shar-
ing Income for Change" was the title
of one article.) The return comes with
learning how to implement your own
ideas about SDClal change, with learning
new ideas, with living and cooperating
with groups of people and other impor-
tant rewards to the spirit.

Specific job opportunities range from
teaching in lree form elementary schools,
to livmg and working on a communal
farm, to counselling runaways, or setting
up and printing movement papers. For
example, Liberty House (Poor People’s
Corporation) in Jackson, Miss,, “estab-
lished to provide jobs through hand-craft
cooperatives for poor people in Missis—
Sippl,” needs people, publicity and sales
promotion, and a purchasing agent at
salaries of $120 (plus) per month. Twin
Oaks, 3 Walden Two type community in
Louisa. Virginia, welcomes new mem-
bers. The diversity in opportunities,
