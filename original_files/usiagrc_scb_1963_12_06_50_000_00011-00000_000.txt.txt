SCARLET AND ILACK

Page Iiuven

 

 

By Len Calodney

In examining the possibility of putting face masks on the IM
football helmets, we may now consider the problem from three
aspects: 1) how other schools have solved the problem, 2) what
illie coaches. medical personnel and insurance agents for the
college think about the suggestion, and a) how much it would
cost.

The simplest way to prevent intramural football injuries is to
not play the sport. This may have been the reason why Knox
never started football, but began their volleyball season in the
fall. The school may also have felt that in this way they woud be
more likely to get all those of varsity caliber out for football.
Princeton, on the other hand, has gone one step farther and out~
fitted lM players with shoulder pads as well as helmets. This
much equipment, besides being expensive, might make the game
a bit too rough for Grinnell's bloodo

Football coach Edd Bowers is against the suggestion. He fears
that the addition of a face guard will give the IM player more
confidence for a head on charge, and Uhereby making the helmet
more of a weapon. He feels (shat if the problem is not with
broken noses or knocked-out teeth, the face guard probably
won’t help too much, even though it would ward off a direct blow.

John Pfitsch (Athletic Director) suggests that we should con-
centrate on injuries over all rather than in one specific area, and
would rather see teaching and coaching used as a means to pre-
vent iniury, Noting that football is the best part of the IM pro-
gram, Pfitsch says it teaches many boys who never played a
Contact sport in high school what it means. Pfitsch added that he
would like to see the IM chairmen come to the athletic staff for
help in running their teams, or for a clinic to be held for 1M
coaches.

As the one who is the ﬁrst to treat those fallen in battle, Mrs.
Irma Hall (Head Nurse) favors the move, She said she would
support anything to help ieduce the number or injuries.

John C. Truesdale (Physical Education) has quoted the cost of
a single bar guard at $2. 25 Therefore the total cost for the 75
to 90 helmets would be about $150 200 Since the helmets now
used are varsity castoffs, they have holes for face guard instal-
lation already drilled, so that additional work would not be
necessary.

Obviously the athletic department would not be able to budget
this much in one year for the purchase of a sulricient number of
face guards. However, the Insurance Company of North Amer-
ica, which handles Grinnell’s insurance business might be Willing
to help conduct an experiment here to see if face guards would
have some effect on injury rate,

Fred P. Ramsey (Ramsey Insurance Agency) mentioned that
the North American company had donated to Grinnell’s Ford
Foundation matching fund, but didn‘t know whether the company
would be Willing to sponsor this proposed experiment, Since this
company is paying $100 a year for head injuries at Grinneii, and
even though this figure means virtually nothing to the organiza-

tion in comparison to its total volume of business, could we iri-~

terest the company in donating the equally miniscuie sum or $50,
enough for face guards on two strings of helmets?
(NEXT WEEK: How shall the experiment he conducted?
