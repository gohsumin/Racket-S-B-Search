Roundballers Split Week End Bill;
Fall to Si. Olaf. Defeat Carleton

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
split a pair of conference
games last weekend by losing
to St. Olaf 91‘s!) and whipping
Carleton 81-65. The Pioneers
came back on Saturday after
the tough Friday night over-
time loss to play a great game
which broke a five-game con-
ference losing streak.

The St. Olaf game was a real
tough affair, in which the score
was tied eleven times, Ted Ris-
ser personally kept Grinnell
in the game for the first six
minutes by scoring the first
eleven Pioneer pointsi

Later St Olaf took its biggest
lead of six points with two min-
utes left in the first half but
two consecutive baskets by Jeff
Frantz and single baskets by
Elliott Hibbs and Dick Ulrich
pushed Grinnell into the lead.
A basket right at the buzzer,
after a steal by Jeff Frantz,
earned Grinnell at 47743 half<
time lead

The second half started with
a basket by Hibbs to give Grin-
nell its biggest lead of six
points. St, Olaf eventually tied
up the game, though, and the
second half was close thereaf~
ter. Two consecutive baskets by
Hibbs gave Grinnell 3 five«
point lead with only 4:30 re-
mainlng.

But St. Olaf rallied and for
the first time in nine minutes

 

took the lead 80-79 with 1:30 left
in the game. Two free throws
by Hibbs with forty seconds re-
maining gave Grinnell its last
lead 81-80. After Eric Grimsrud
had tied the score for St. Olaf,
Jeff Nelson, the game's high
scorer, made two free throws
with nine seconds left, When
Jeff Frantz came down and
swished a twenty-five foot jump
shot with one second remain-
ing, the game was sent into
overtime

In the overtime Grinnell was
never able to take the lead
Finally with the game tied,
Nelson won the game for the
01:35 91-89 with a jump shot
with three seconds left.

The junior forward Jeff Nel-
son led all scorers with 32
points. Eric Grimsrud and
Dave Heise, a couple of sharp-
shooting guards, added 21 and
19 points respectively. Jeff
Frantz again led the Pioneers
with 22 points while Elliott
Hibbs notched 21.

As usual the Pioneers were
weak in rebounding. They could
only capture 26 rebounds which
St. Olaf’s two big forwards,
Dennis Olson and Fred Russler
matched by themselves. The
Oles as a team brought down
49 rebounds. Grinnell was also
hurt at the foul line where it
could only sink 15 of 27 free
throws

like a house afire by scoring the
first nine points before Hibbs
could break the ice for Grin-
nell, The Pioneers fought back
though and crept within four
points with 5:30 left in the first
half. In the next seven minutes
the Pioneers rattled off fifteen
consecutive points and took a
32-21 lead, Grinnell held on and
took a 38-29 lead at half-time.

Grinnell then started pulling
away as the second half pro-
ceededr Even though Ted Ris-
ser and Tom Hill fouled out,
Carleton could never start any
kind of a rally. Carleton, be<
hind by fifteen points with time
running out, applied a despera-
tion press but the Pioneers

rolled on Included were ten ‘,

straight points scored by lead-
ing scorer Jeff Frantz, Grin-
nell took its biggest lead of 21
points with 4:25 remaining The
Pioneers finally took an 81-55
victory.

28 shots from the floor and 6
of 1 free throws Dick Chap

Frantz led all scorers ‘

nears then were nearly equal
to Carleton in rebounds—losing
only 34-32.

The Pioneers also improved
their defense. Against St, Olaf
the Pioneers employed a 1-3-1
zone defense if they had just
scored and a man-to—man de-
fense if they did not score.
Against Carleton they used the
man—to-man exclusively. The
Pioneers also used their man-
to-man press for both games,
The defense seemed a little
sharper by forcing more out-
side shots and allowing fewer
shots right under the basket.
