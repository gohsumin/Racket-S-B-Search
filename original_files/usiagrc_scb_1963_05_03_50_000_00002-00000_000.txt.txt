THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN AN ERA 0F CRISIS

The symposium was initiated and planned by a
student committee All ot the maior stuclt‘nt orgal
zatrons on campus. including student government. art
supporting the program As rvplained belou. the syiw
p‘osium committee intends to arr-misc tor interested
students to wrltc background papc on all sub-topics
In this manner student interest \\‘Ill be awakened long
beiorc the iormnl plogram is presented on our turn
pus. Such paper-writing will be done with the tuli
cooperation of the incultv.

1. PURPOSE

The goal of the symposium is to provide the Gl'iii‘
nell College student body and faculty. and the
rounding community with a siiiiitilatliisv evaluation
of the democratic pi‘oce in this country Stress Will

be placed on how the process woi ks and how well
it works. .

Both or these questions are valid oncs icr consid-

ntion. As our government continues to expand in
.2e and ptnvcr, it cpnrurrcntlv seems to grow more
distant lrom the individual There is a shocking luck
ct' understanding as to how our dcmocracv iuncticns.
it is oul hope that our.symposlum can help hll this
void ot knowledge But perhaps more important we
must :rv to answer the questlnii as to how well thc
proccss is functioning. Democracy is ndcr ‘dttack irom
nu areas. Thc c at as lcvcled akaliist it come from
leads of rmer. . nations nnd leaders oi the plann-
cd socicucs. Even in the Umlcd States our own pub
licntitins cxpi . bewilderment in Chargin at the seem-
ing meiiiciency and trivclity at our representative
system

Undoubtedly, we are livilie‘ in an era of crisis Call
the slow. deliberative process at dcmocracv meat the
demands oi such rill Era" It is to answer such quess
lions that We plan this symposium,

II. BACKGROUND

The Gl'inlicll community is (in Exciting place for
such a discussion. The faculty and student body llzivc
a continuous concern with national and international
affairs, In addition to Li velV l‘lCll Series of lecture-
shlps. which this year has included Senators Golds
Water und McCarthy. Justice William 0. Douglas. Dr.
Rollo May and Dr Arnold Tovnbee, Gl'lnnell College
is lcrttlnale to have a Program in Practical Political
Education which yeal'lv provides a varied pl'escntur
tion of practical political Events This program and
the student involvement in it provides zi constant
stimuli which the symposium program will be able

to utilize.

Also. it is important to nolc that in lhc [all or
tool. the rollege sponsored u conicrcncc on Latin
American Alia Although we do not plan to strtin
tuic the symposium exactly as this conference was
Slluctured. it has providrd experience in relating
such a program to the student body, Many of. the
same techniques, such as baC'el'mmd papers written
by students, which were cmrcmely successiui then
will be used in the svmposium Diagram

ill. STRUCTURE

The symposium will be divided into (little sub-
topics Each or these shall have a planning committee
responsible for compiling bibliographies on the topic.
tiliall lug att‘angements l'or the speakers, providing
hospitality tor our guests. and all ‘lElng ior students
to write papers on the topic. Th sub-topic com-
niiltees Will be dircctlv responsible to the symposium
planning committee It is our desire to have each
pub-topic to be a complete pros in in it<elt'. yct bc
an integral part oi the total pi gram.

It -s our present plan to havc each lecturer give
at least one public lecture and their later participate
on a panrl with other guests concerned with the sum
topic Nuluialll’. utii‘ :tlesl lecturer will also nieel
with studcnl groups miormallv.
