Wait For Action From Above

Blacks Meet with Trustees

By TED GLICK

For the past lew months the
CBS and the administration
have been working to improve
conditions at Grinnell for black
students. Last weekend, at. a
Trustees meeting in Chicago,
several black students presented
an outline of the innovations and
improvements they would like
to see at Grinnell, and repre—
sentatives of the administration
presented a position paper out-
lining their ideas for making
this institution present a worth—
while educational experience for

its black students. Subsequently,
the position paper or the admin-
istration was, lor all practi~
cal purposes, thrown out, and
the outline of the blacks was
accepted by the Trustees as
the base on which to build a
resolution to be voted on at the
Trustees meeting in June.

The action of last weekend
grew out of the Trustees’ March
meeting. At that meeting a
group of Grinnell black stu-
dents, administration members,
and former Grinnell students
met before the Standing Com»
mittee an Educational Policy ol

the Trustees and presented their
case for a more relevant pro-
gram tor blacks. This led to a
meeting before the entire Board
of Trustees later that night at
which [he turmat [or last week.
end's meeting was decided on.

At the June meeting of the
Board of Trustees a committee
of the Trustees will present 8
resolution concerning-the chang<
es desired by blocks for the en<
tire Board to vote on, Also, the
Board will consider possible
Contributions and financial as-
sistance for the setting-up and
operating of the new programs.

There are seven general area!
which the CBS would like to
see improved, expanded and/or
initiated. These are: (l) It
means for students needing pre-
oollege educational enrichment
to receive it; (2) provisions [or
increased admission of blacks
and an increase in scholarship
assistance; (3) an increase in
the number of black faculty
members; (i) an expansion or
curricular opportunities, such
as a Black Studies department;
(5) provisions for more money
for more Black Cultural events;
(5) establishment of a Black
Student Cenler, such as an oil'-
eampus house, which will also
be open to whites; and (7) an
improvement in the placement
oiiice so as to provide more in-
formation on meaningful job
opportunities for ‘hlaclts once
they enter the real world.

Further information on the
specifics of these general pro-
grams was unavailable item the
Students who were at the Chi-
cago meeting. Greg Coggs said,
“I’m not going to make a com-
merit until the President makes
a statement. It's up to the Ma
ministration and the Trustees to
act.”

Along with the meeting with
the Tmstees, there has been
other activrty on the issue of
educational improvement tar
blacks. Mr. Joe Wall, luturo
Dean of the College, and Mer-
ryll Penson of CBS traveled to
Atlanta on Monday and Tiles-
day. While there they talked to
students and faculty at More—
house, Spellmau. Clark, and
Morris Brown colleges, all of
them predominantly black in-
nitiltions. They explored the
possibilities of having faculty
members frt J these schools
spending time as visiting pro~
tessors at Grinncll, oi having an
exchange of faculty members
between schools, and of having
an exchange of students be-
tween schools.

The idea for thls expedition
grew out of IWO sources: First,
Mr. Charles Cleaver, on leave
trom Grinnell and working at
Morehouse College, a black
graduate school which is devel-
oping a graduate program in
Black Studies, ,believed .that
such exchanges would be bene-
ficial and educational. Secondly,
Hugh Gloster, president or
Morehouse, visited Griimell in
February and spoke to various
iacuity members and adminis-
lration ofﬁclals. From these
two interrelated events, Ihe idea
for exchanges grew and began
to be acted upon.

Miss Penson, in speaking or
her experiences with students,
said Ihat the Students at Clark
and Morris Brown seemed in-
terested in the idea. but the
students at Morehouse and
Spellnian received the idea in a
manner less than encouraging.

Tl Faculty to Leave

Faculty Fa alities

As of this week, twenty-one
faculty members, excluding the
Lenox Quartet, are not planning
to return to Grinnell. Also, Dr.
Norton, who has been on the
faculty since 1930, will be re-
tiring, although he will teach
one more course next semester.
And Dr. Dawson will be resign-
ing in order to go to Africa, al-
though he does plan to even<
tually return to Grinnell.

There are approximately 125
faculty members, of which half
have only been here since 1965.
This year there were six facul-
ty members who were original—
1y appointed in 1965, nine who
came here in 1966, 19 from 1967,
and 27 new taoulty members.
This does not include the Assist-
ants and Mike Finley, who is
lnstnictor in Religious Studies.
as well as being a Resident Ad-
visor. It is interesting to note
that all the full professors, be-
sides President Leggett and
Lieutenant Colonel Steger, were
hired prior to the fall of 1969.
It should be pointed out that ap-
proximately the Sallie number
of faculty (18), left last year as
will be leaving this year.

There are at present, sixteen
faculty members who are plan»
illng to take a leave of absence
next year for at least one se»
mester. This, Combined With
particular iaculty departures, is
creating Somewhat of a prob-
lem for a iew departments. For
example, this year’s entire Rus-
sian Department is leaving,
(Barasch and Young). The Psy-
chology Department will be los—
ing three members, although
Dr. Tyler will be returning.
With such a small department
this will continue the tremen—
dous turn-overrrate problem.
(There is only one other person
on the staff, Mr. Gerritz, who
was new this year.

Physics will also be missing
three of its members, at least
tor the iirst semester, (Bow-
man, Gale and Hanson). The
Classical Languages Depart-
ment will be reduced by one
third as Crossett and McKibhen
take consecutive one semester
leaves. The struggling Art De
partment has not yet tound a
replacement for McMillan, al»
though it has hired someone to
replace Morse. And iinally, the
Anthropology Department has
not been able to replace Mr.
Willis.
