Hillbilly is Overthrown By Queen of the Mountain

Beiore spring break the Student Ailairs Committee asked lor applications for the
use or the collegeowned ditcampus houses. Several naive students submitted proa
posals to the proper “decision making” machinery 7 the Student Altairs Committee.

The committee accepted several proposals, and many left for vacation happy at
the prospect or living in their desired environments. The folklore house group became
known as the prospective residents of “Hillybilly Heaven.” It looked as though this
Hoposal, which had the unotlicial backing oi the American Studies department (Mr.

ergen), was going to be a reality and that they could pretty well count on home«

ltead rights for '69-'70.

it became progressively more apparent, however, that in the studenHaculty, ad-
ministration trinity which composes the committee, the administration is the most
omnipotent body. Dean Low decided that oi the approved proposals, which were the
coed German House, the coed Inner College (2 houses), and the Men's Folklite
House, only the German House is acceptable in its proposed form. The Inner College,
she says, can probably have one women’s house. The men in Inner College are out,
and the Folklile House gets the good old American lurk in the eye.

The reason: the number 01 spaces [or women has to remain constant, and if 10
or 12 men moved into Pine Tree the balance would be upset.

Now this may be lair enough to say, but why should there be about lo men
in German House. The reason for this is also simple: The German House is a pet

project of Dean Stauss.

it is apparent alter this action (not quite linal as yet) that the administration
should examine its priorities. Does it really want to replace the Wasteland oi resi-
dential lile at Gl'innell with something more meaningtul, or does it want to proceed
at its own “smooth” pace and not rock the boat. An underclass male student has no
alternative to the dormitory system than to live nilvcampus illegally and pay double
rent. Dean Low is proving to the students as Well as to the faculty, which is also
represented by the Student AIIairs Committee, that she is willing and able to over-
ride any decisions they may make. Dean Low might just. as well do away with the
superﬂuous Student Attairs Committee it she is not going to take its decisions

seriously. it seems not outside her realm bl power.

Where The Truth Hurts

By TOM THOMAS

“It will not do {or us to Say, ‘I gave
somethlng only yesterday to this or to
that} You would not say so it you saw a
man dying at your door or hunger; you
would give all you may have to satisiy
the hunger oi that dying man. in the
present case. the only diiierence Is that
millions are dying tar away lrorn you,
lar hour the place where you call home.
but with whose weliare you are lndlssole
ubly hound up. it would also not do to
say that what you give will be or no use
to the ocean or sulierers, ior it is the
drops that make the ocean. it becomes.
therelore, the duty of all to give oi all we
can. Our cause is just. “We lind no es-
cape lrom our course it we are to lind
justice." ~ Ghalldi

On Tuesday oi this week, I joined al-
most 250 student body presidents and
newspaper editors lrum across the coun-
try in expressing our intent to reiuse to
serve in the armed forces at the United
5 . tes as long as the Vietnam war con-
ti ues. Our statement says in port. “hav-

ig worked ihmugh legal processes with-
out result and consdering the continuing
crisis oi the present situation, we find
ourselves left without other alterna-
iives.”

The release goes on to state that “we
will reluse induction and aid and support
lilose who decide to rel " . We now milst
number ourselves among those students
who cannot at this time square military
duty with integrity and conscience."

At the present time, a statement pt
complic:ty with dralt resistors is being
circulated here at Grinnell. Tl‘idt state-
ment reads as iollows:

The fund eniul iln norality and in-
c‘ casing brutality ci our nation’s course
in Vieiliﬂm compels us to commit our
lives to changing that course. Responsr
biiity lies ivith each oi us. The killing
must be stopped. we stand with lilose
young men who in the American tradir

We ourselves are not ehgible tor the

nouitce our individual and joint coinplh

the young men who are reiusing tue

We do not ulltlc .e this dcilon Ilgllily,

We are keenly aware of the penalties
which may he exacted tor this action:

We explicitly encourage, aid and abet
this Civil disobedience and thus place
ourselves in equal legal jeopardy with
draft reiusers. We cannot leave them to
take the risks alone (or what is the basic
act of conscience in our time.

I have signed the above statement and
would encourage others to do so. As
David Hawk, Coordinator of the student
body presidents statement and presently
under indictment [or refusing induction,
said ill a recent letter, “there doesn’t
seem to be any likelihood or an impend~

As Saul Alinsky said, confirming Ghandi,

talk of the town

By FREDRICKA NELSON

liberals, students. ylppies—niggers all
to some 7 we've made the trout page
of the herald register. perhaps i should
say jeri-y rubin has made it for us. pol<
itics is deserving in general, and we de
served a good part or two columns and
numerous photos. 1 would like to take
this opportunity to comment on the of-
fnir, as it probably has been the talk
of the town or will be for a few weeks.
in the heraldrregister article i noticed a
couple of good phrases: "students at-
tired in deliberately raggedy clothing,”
and “‘jerry’s here, he's in the bath-
room.‘ ” since i haven’t studied the
whole article i won't make any “deliber-
ate" comments on its point or view or
content. let it be said that we were
noticed.

at the rubin assembly you had to have
your seat lrom the lirst because the
college community turned out lor the
“yippie night” abundantly. that seems
rather paradoxical since we’re supposed—
ly closer to the “liberal" tradition. we
hetrayed our interest in the sensational
>— even in “educated” circles sensation-
alists have lots or appeal. no reflection
is meant in mr. rubin. only, as the doors
have said, “people are strange,” espe-
cially in their pretensions. but that‘s
another rap and i’ll go into it some
other time.

i was most comfortable at the assemr
hly with jerry rubin, and i think i know
just exactly why. mr. rubin has a mar-
velous sense 01 humor and he uses It
to try and communicate a “very ser-
ious thing” called revolution. i suppose
the evening would have been even more
entertaining ii i had been there from
the time the ﬁrst bubble burst til the
happy-ending hand shake.

by contrast to hernadine dorhn and
the other “heavy" politicos that i heard
last week. jeiry rubin looked strange,
but sounded remarkably human. it was
pointed out in the panel discussion that

followed that the audience should have
thought more deeply than its gleeiul
reaction indicated. it that’s Valid at all,
it’s only a little bit so, the rest of the
weekend emphasized the way people set
themselves apart from each other with
ideologies and styles. sometimes these
differentiallons are interesting, but to a
lew oi us they are the things that the
revolution should squash. we have had
such a long and murderous history at
clashes because of “the way we‘re
made." war, poverty alienation and
every other evil that you can imagine
springs ii‘om some dumb fool man look-
ing at his neighbor with everything but
love, and not doing god's commandment
to treat the other dude just like he would
like to be treated himself. in: not say—
ing there's only one holy way to show
your tellow beings how to make it. you
can use any words or gestures that lit
the meaning, but you sure better do it.

even it you couldn’t stand it) look at
rubin, you almost have to admit that
he didn't use his words to inistrate your
mind into change. which is a very fine
touch to climax a political week. god,
the big man in the sky, told us a long
time ago that we’d never know nutltin‘,
though we continue to die trying. the
thing that i remember in particular
about mr. rubin was that. he said he was
a man who loves to shake hands With
people, what could be more appropriate
tor the politician of gladness than [0
use with loving care the gesture of tho
politician oi amelica.

i‘ve said enough about jerry rubin and
where We ended up leads right into
something a reverend spoke on the oth-
er sunday. reverend robcrt e, dewey de-
livered a good talk on the heretical per-
spective today.

he also oilered interesting views or
jc‘s time, can you imagine what an an-
archist christ was in his day and how
he probably seemed to the priests to be
the jerry rubin of rome?

Revolution Fertile Hell of It

To the Editor

I was asked to give an ”overview",
of the New Leit Conierence. Well, 0.x.
Here's an overview.

Paul Goodman is against water and
air pollution and wishes young radicals
were too.

Ernie chambers quotes the Bible and
Andrew Young realizes that big corpor-
ations are his enemy.

Allard Lowensteln thinks we can pur-
ily America by electing a lew more
“good lolk" like him to Congress.

nernadiue Dohrn wants a cooperative
rather than competitive economic sys
tem to abolish racism and imperialism.

Jerry Rubin knows that you change a
society with your lile and your body,
not with intellectual rhetoric.

Hal Draper thinks that third party
politics. (a la the 30‘s) is our hope for
the future.

Actually, it all happened just beiore
Robin’s Speech. Balloons, bubbles, llags,
Yippiel, FREE, and ilying money zlll
over the pl Somewhere between the
sio and M000 was given or thrown
away A 55 oil was burned in the bal-
cony. One of the balloons had a $20 bill
in it.

That was the New Politics Conlei-ence.
That was the New Politics. Rev . ,
For I!“ Hell til it is here. And its here
to stay.

li you listened to the speeches and
pad attention to all those words, line.
But don‘t be deceived. That wasn't the
New Politics Conference. The New Pol-
itics happened with the lull garbage can

_ —1

(platiorm) in tront oi Lowenstein. It
happened when prot. Al Jones called
Rubin “pathetic” and everyone was too
busy playing with balloons to notice. it
happened with 3.000 balloons. $50, and a
whole lot of good vibes liying through
the air all at once. To some people it
never happened. Sorry if you missed it,
it was a helluva lot of fun.

By scientilic. obiective, analysis,
l know that those who pick clos<
ing no. 2 belong to the New Politics,
those who pick no. i don’t.

Closing no. 1: sincerely,

H. R. Gross

Closing no. 2: Love. Peace, Fm,

New Politics Commended

To the Editor:

i wanted to express my appreciation
to the Student Planning Committee and
Plotessor Gilmollr. Director oi the Pro-
gram iii Practical political Education,
lor their role in bruising to Grinnell the
Conierence on the New politics.

During my live years at Grinnell there
have been many occasions when people
have descended upon Grinnell lor educa-
tonnl purposes — lectures, coltee hours,
conferences, and canvocotions. Few. in
my opinion, have been as worthwhile as
last weeks conference.

in addition to the substantive iniorma-
tion made available to the college coin-
niunity, there were some additional
bcnelits realized. To those students who
organized the Coniei-ence there was the
valuable experience or doing so and to
nose skeptical at entrusting sludents
with such responsibilities there is the
e,idence lhat student involvement is not
necessarily dangerous.
