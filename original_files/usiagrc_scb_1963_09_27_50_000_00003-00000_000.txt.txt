the annual assault on Truth; this pioiect can

oi ioothall or Eton’s revolutionary Modified 1‘1an

ing plan.

Students, as well as Faculty and Administra-
tive personnel lake part actively in the “Tluth
Piogi-"am, :is it is iondiy known. Some oi the
outstanding events oi the year involving the
entire college community are: the Junior Lib-
eral Arts Examination, the Inter-Semester Vora—
cious Reading Period, and, of course, the Inter—
Diseiplinary Seminar on Everything.

Since this is a topic so vital and so dear to
the hearts oi all t1 ue Grinnellians, I thought per.

Me: Gentlemen. I am very interested in what
you ich your final goals to be

Crawslick: Truth. That’s our goal.
Crunch: Perhaps this should be elaborated.

Me: Yes, per aps.

Crunch: Well, what we are reaching tor is a
world view that will incorporate the theories
of all noted philosophers and thinkers through—
out the history or civilization. Collatine them,
you see, complementing one view with another,
perhaps opposite view, and then fusing the
'Synthesis oi the two with a third. perhaps still

ei-n Eta, havc put ioiu aid the theory that Truth
is not something that can he ohiecti1ely knuvt 11,1
but that it e.11sts only tiitlitn the individual
mind. What would you say to this type oi zlrgliv
mont"

Crowstich; in a word, Truth.

Crawstiek: Ah yes, Kierkegaard, Existentialrt
is1n, Suhjcctivism. Let me say this, that no mat»;
ter how much we may disagree with this Soi‘l‘
oi thinking, we are neglecting none oi the.
theories put iortli along this line: we can't afford
to. Kierkegaard. Camus. even Sartre are being
collated and givcn equal weight with all the}
others. The dialectic. you see, can only come to;

on this question” 1

Crunch: There is much to be done At a Cons;

we can ofier even a tentative statement,

MC‘ Di' Crawstiek, May 1 ask you what sub»;
divisions you have created 111thin the wide)“

Crawstiek: Certainly. The Nature oi Man, the
Order or Things, the Order oi Nature, the Mean

Man oi Nature.

Me: Thank you very much. One last question7
When you gentlemen at last arrive at a cons
cliision, do you expect that it will eliange the
lives of all men?

Crunch: Well, I don’t. know about that
Ci'awstick: It certainly will change our lives.
