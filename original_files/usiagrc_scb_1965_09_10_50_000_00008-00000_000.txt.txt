No Grinnell Summer Classes
Didn't Mean Intellectual Still

The absence of summer classes
at Griiinell might lead one to
think that intellectual activity wns
iii a siandstill.

But his is far from true. par-
ticularly in the science building,

where nine college protessors and'

17 student assistants were engaged
in summer research projects—
tliis year to the accompaniment

oi pounding hammers and buzzing
saws.

While carpenters and laborers
worked toward the completion (ii a
$1 million addition to the college's
science building, the nine prUles»
surs continued their research in
the (mast “show must go on" tra~
dition despite the inconvenience or
dust, noise, and electrical and wa-
ter interruptions.

The research was carried on in
the fields of biology. chemistry,
and physics under more than
$160,000 in grants. Most ot the
grants were for two or three years
and involved work during the reg-
ular school year in addition to
summer laborr

While National Science Founda-
tion grants financed a majority or
the research projects, money troni
the US. Public Health Service and
the Petrnleum Research Fund also
aided the work.

Four chemists were involved in
three ot the projects.

 

Luther Erickson and William
Nevill studied “Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance ot Metnl Complexes oi
Possible Anti~Cancer Compounds"
under 2| $60,000 U.S. Public Health
Servxce stipend,

A $13,740 Petroleum Research
Fund grant ﬁnanced a study or
dicyanocarbelie and nitrogen ylide
chemistry by Jack swenson, while
Joseph Danmrth sought a ”Soluble
SilicaeAlumina Catalyst” under a
$10,000 National Science Foundation
allocation.

Also aiding the work conducted
by the chemists was a $9,500 NSF
undergraduate research participa-
tion allowance

in the biology department, Guil-
lermo Mendoza, Kenneth Chris-
tiansen, Benjamin Graham, Jr.,
and LaVerne Durkee all worked unv
der NSF sponsorship.

Mendoza explored problems in
reproduction and embryology of
viviparous lish from Mexico under
a $12,000 allocation, while a $23,000
award financed Christiansen’s in<
vestigalion 0f the evolution Di Col-
lembola. a cave insect.

Graham had a $17,000 grant to
study the inﬂuence of natural root
grafting on forest trees.

Durkee conducted a iossil pollen
analySis of lake bottom sediments
in northern Minnesota in late July
and early August. He later worked
on a similar project in Iowa un-

 

der 3 NSF stipend to low State
University.

Beryl Clottelter of the physics
department researched the con-
ductivity or walls of glass dis.
charge tubes under a $14,400 NSF
allowance.

A tenth Grinnellian, physicist
Roger Hanson, took part in n tac-
ility participation program at the
Ames laboratory or the Atomic
Energy Commission this summer,
He was involved in a Search for
new isotopes.

The 17 student assistants—15
from Grinnell and two who are
attending other colleges, were:
James Albrecht, Richard Ander—
son, Roger Clow, Davrd Culver,
Glenn Elliott, John Howie, Stephen
Kari), Dale Levine, Memo Mendo-
23. David Nehrkorn, William Ram»
seyer, Stephen Rockwood, Richard
Seifert. Dennis Spencer, John Wat.
kins, Ruth Ann Ryan, and Mary
Lewis.

Kiddies' Open House

Uncle Sam's Club, a Grlnilell Col-
lege service organization, will hold

W E I. C O M E —- But it... i. .,.,.

Thai isn't as inhospitable as it sounds. Helping people go away ———
travel —~ is our business!

i.

Welcome to — or back lo — Grinnell. We like Grinnell, and
we hope you do loo.

. Bul sooner or later you’ll want i0 leave, so stop by 808 Fillh

Avenue Court for informoiion and lickels. We make no money
unless we sell something, but we'll be glad to help you whether
or nol you are ready to buy.

ll is well lo reserve air flights ecirly for vuculion periods. Tickeie
ing and paymenl need not be made until nearer departure
time We will mail bills to your parents if you wish — prelelu
(:1ny in time to receive paymenl before you leave.

. It is not loo early lo make plans for summer travel, work, or

study.

a. One inleresling possibility is work in Germany. The Ger-
man Student Labor Office in cooperalion with Luilhunsa Airs
lines finds iobs for many SIUdenls each summer at good pay,
wilh no income lax or social security, and some lime [ell for
travel. Sludenf BABOK BABOK has informailon on campus.

Finding inexpensive travel abroad is not easy. You have to
be a member of cl group lo gel a charter or group roles.
Grinnell is loo small a campus lo make u churler movement
of iis own as some of the larger campuses do, but even so,
95% (l) of proposed student charter movemenls never get

off the groundl We sirongly suggest lhut your area Nalionol
Siudenl Association is ihe group which should arrange for
group travel. Only 25 members are needed, and round i‘rip
group fare New York/London is only $325. Last summer we
tried this and lacked only a few to make if go — but all from
Grinnell campus. Properly ”sold" and provided it is not '00
lclle even now lo get reserved space, ihis is your best bel.
Nalurally we hope you let us arrange it!

c. Reservations should be made soon on the inexpensive ship
and air rouies on an individual basis — and that is the way
mosl of you will end up going unless you work at gelting a
group sold.

. Numerous fours are sold in conneclion with inexpensive ship
space —- and lhere is a It)! to be said for laking a four!

. Of course there is also luxury lruvel and we are glad lo sell
it; but most students are searching for “cheap" irunsporlci.
