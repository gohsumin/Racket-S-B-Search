Bressler Termed ‘Good Interpreter’

By MELISSA HAYS

Friday evening, a versatile
artist, Charles Bressler, gave
a concert in which he proved
to be equally at home with
baroque oratorio, German
lieder, and English talk song.

He began the concert with
two songs by Purcellt He gave
an energetic rendition of the
first, and sang the second in a
more subdued tone.

The liumber tllat deserved
and received the most enthus-

iastio applause

was an aria from

Handel's oratorio,

Jephtha. The rec.
items was tragio and powerful,
and Bressler handled beauti-
fully the abrupt change to
the tender mood oi the
aria. He exercised perfect
control over the long, rising
lines, suggesting the ascent to
heaven. A second aria by Han-
del was jubilant and bold,
calling for a iullness of voice
that Bressier did not have.
But he sang smoothly the long
li lies with diiiicuit leaps,
showing again his good con-
lt'nl.

Of the three Debussy songs,
Bressler‘s performance of the
last, ”Chevaux de Ellis," was
most noteworthy. Underlying
the superﬁcial festivity or this
piece is an ominous tone
which is created by the dark,
chromatic passages lor the pi-
ano and is taken up by tho
frenzied song about the cease-
less turning of a carousel.

If the Handel aria was the
best periornred single selec-
tion, the five Schubert lleder
were the best group on the
program There was much va-
riety, some of the songs being
playful and capricious. others
being serene and lyrical. The
serenade could easily have be-
come saccharine, but Bressler
'avoided this pitfall. In the

tranquil, melodious sections of
the piece Where a poorer vo<
calist might have been exces<
sively sentimental, Bressler
sang with a simplicity that
was far more attentive, I think
a word in praise of the dc-
cumpanist, David Garvey, is
appropriate here, i had we
pected the pianist to shine in
the Debussy pieces, and he
did, in fact, play them sensh
tively. But it was in the Schu-
bert that he was most remark-
able, i-lo achieved a periect

balance with the soloist and
played with vitality a potenti-
ally monotonous accompani-
ment.

or the three folk songs ar-
ranged by Benjamin Britten,
“Sweet Polly Oliver" was this
most difficult, but Bressler
pcriprmed it with apparent
ease, This piece was polytonal
—that is, while the soloist was
in one key, the accompanist
was in another. The resulting
problems are obvious, but
Brassler‘s intonation was ac-
curate throughput the song,

Last on the program were
two songs by Samuel Barber.
The first was quiet and peace-
ful; the second was sometimes
tumultuous and fiery, some-
times mysterious and super
natural. As usual, Bressler
made the changes suggested
by the text without over—ems
phasis,

In all the songs he per-
formed, Bressler's articula<
lion, intonation, attention to
text and sensitivity in dynam-
ice are to be praised. I
heard several complaints that
the tenor did not have enough
power to shake the walls. I
feel that what he lacked in
volume, he made up for in
control and agility. It seems
to me no more taxing to belt
out a song than to sing quietly
in the sustained, emotionally
charged manner that Bressler
has mastered,

BRIDGE:
POST MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY

The unusual nurtrump over<
call is used primarily as a de-
fensive bid to prevent or dis-
rupt an enemy contract. It is
traditionally made by a player
holding at least ten cards in
clubs and diamonds, although
it can be used, under special
circumstances, for any two
suits. There are four, and only
four situations in which a no
trump bid can be considered
"unusual”:

l) a direct no-trump overcall
by a passed hand. For ex-
ample, in the auction: Pass -
l Spade - Pass - 2 Hearts . 2
NT. The last bid indicates
length in clubs and diamonds.

2) a jump overcall to two
no-trump: Pass < l Spade - 2
NT.

3) a nit-trump overcall over
an opposing no-trump bid: Pass
- 1 NT - 2 NT.

4) a no-trump overcall after
obvious enemy game and slam<
indicating bids: 2 Clubs - Pas]
- 2 Hearts . Pass - 2 Spades -
3 NT.

The unusual no~trump should
never ba bid in any but these
situations or it may be inter.
preted as indicating a strong
hand with even distribution, an
error which results in the most
ludicrous of Contracts.

There is no point requirement
to make an unusual no-trump
overcall. Generally, the strong-
er the distribution, the fewer
the number oi high card points
that are needed. With a strong
hand and “unusual" distribu<
tion, It is better to overcall in
a suit, intending to bid the
other it possible. An exception
to this rule would require an
extremely unbalanced strong
hand (6-6-1-0) in which, after
an unusual no-trump bid, part-

In responding to an unusual
no-trump overcall, a preter-
ence must be shown for one of
the suits promised. The only
case in which a pass can be
made is after an intervening
bid or double, which allows
partner to bid again, Respond-
er must decide how high to
take the contract, as his part-
ner has already described his
hand. With a Weak band and
three or less cards in either
