HAYMARKET SCUARE: Weatherman rally at site of bombed police monument

monument before march on Saturday.

A Chicago organizer told the group
the "kids in this town are digging us
like hell." She said, "They think
we‘ve got an out of sight thing going.U

A demonstrator with her arm in a
sling told the group everywhere she
went people identified her as a Weather—
man. "I got on the subway and the whole
car was uptight. People think every
fucking kid in this town is a Weather—
man, and that messes their minds."

The meeting continued until about
2:30 a.m. when Chicago and Evanston
police broke down the door. The raid
was intended, according to police spokes—
men, to seize six Weathermen for whom
warrants were obtained after a police
spy had been beaten at another Evanston
church.

The spy had entered the movement
center at Immanuel Methodist Church where
members of the New York Collective were
having a meeting Friday morning. Members
of the Weather Bureau were also present
at the church.

One of the demonstrators who had been
arrested Wednesday claimed he recognized
the spy, having seen him at the police
station. Weathermen debated what to
do with the spy, then decided to "work
him over and kick him out."

As the pastor of the church arrived,
the Weathermen threw the spy out of the
church. The group then decided, for
obvious reasons, to leave the Immanuel
Church. The collective moved into the
streets that afternoon in small groups.
The demonstrators later joined the
group at the Covenant Church.

The police arrived at the Covenant
Church at about 3:15 a.m. and were met
by that church's pastor. "I asked them
to wait and let the janitor open the door
with keys, but they just broke down the
door," he said afterward.

As the police burst into the meeting
room, several of the radicals success—
fully fled into the night. Others had
left only a short time before to put
up new wall posters. The policemen
ordered the remaining 200 Weathermen
"up against the wall."

Demonstrators were told to keep their
heads down and to look straight
ahead. The group was caught completely
by surprise and there was almost no
resistance. Three of the youths for
whom warrants were obtained were immed—
iately seized. Another 40 were recogni—
zed as having participated in Wednesday
night's action and were also arrested.
As the group was frisked, officers re—
moved money from individual's wallets
whiCh was never returned. Many of the
helmets and other items of equipment
were taken by the officers as they
left.

Approximately 150 Weathermen remain—
ed in the church after the raid.
The group spent the remainder the even—
ing discussing the effect of the raid.
Many were obviously disturbed by the
fact that the police had so easily
broken into the center. Several thought
that the group should have fought the
police. Others thought resistance
would have been suicidal.

As a consequence of the ease with
which the police had subdued the ,
group several of the demonstrators
decided not to participate in the
Saturday march. The Weathermen did
not sleep that night but continued
the discussion through the dawn and
up to the time when they departed for
the march.

The final Weatherman march was called
for 12:00 noon at Haymarket Square, site
of the destroyed police monument. At
12:00 not a Weatherman was in sight.
About 50 policemen were present, none
of them wearing helmets.

At about l2:20, a group of approx-
imately 20 Weathermen moved into the
Square and formed near the remains of
the statue. The group included several
members of the Weather Bureau.

About five minutes later, a squad of
15 policemen dressed in heavy jackets,
old clothes and boots, entered the
Square and quickly walked toward the
assembled group. Their arrival was
hidden from the Weathermen by the many
newsmen who walked about the area.
The policemen mingled in with the
Weathermen (at least one officer wore
an SDS button) and then suddenly
attacked five leaders with clubs. No
warning was given, and only the five
were beaten.

The leaders fought back and a
violent struggle filled half the
Square for about two minutes. The
arrested Weather Bureau members were
immediately placed in waiting paddy
wagons and carried away. One of those
seized was Mark Rudd, National Secre—
tary of SDS.

Assistant corporation counsel
Stephen Zucker said those arrested
would be charged with "inciting to
riot." "We‘re not looking for leaders,"
claimed Zucker, "we‘re looking for ones
who broke the law."

He also said that many of the over
120 Weathermen previously arrested

were out on hails, some as high as
$5,000.

About 20 minutes following the ar—
rests more than 100 Weathermen arrived
in the Square, only about half with
helmets. Many of those present had
been on the street Wednesday. This
time, however, few weapons were in
evidence.

Jeff Jones of the national office,
wearing a red football helmet, began
the rally. As he spoke, other contin—
gents arrived bringing the total to
more than 325 demonstrators. After a—
bout 30 minutes of speeches, the group,

Secretary, addresses Haymarket rally.
