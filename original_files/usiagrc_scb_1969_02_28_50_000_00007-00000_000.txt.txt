Glose Loss In
Record Breaker

Sweet Victory eluded the
Gl‘innell Swimming last week
end in their penultimate meet
or the year as they lost to Cora
nell 49 to 46. Competition was
highlighted by school or pool
records set in {our of the eleven
events, and by unusually stilt
competition in the diving, where
the last place diver scored 195
points and the first three all
scored over 200. Grinnell’s rec—
ord is now live wins and three
losses in conference competi~
tion.

Records were also broken in
ireshinan competition. John
Wein’s 2: 11.7 in the 200 butterfly
is a freshman school record and
is under the freshman conterence
record; Steve Ward’s 1241.0 in
the 160 individual medley bet-
ters the varsity and ileshmall
school record; and the 400 flee
relay team of Ward, Weins,
Cams, and Daley swam a 3:218
which is faster than the fresh-
man school, pool, and confer-
ence record, and equals the
varsity conierence record.

On February 28, the varsity
will travel to Knox to compete
in the Conterence champion.

Frosh Show Promise

At a dual meet against U.N.l.
on Thursday, Grinnell’s fresh~
men indoor-track Learn showed
that they would be the team to
reason with in the coming con»
iercnce meet on March 7, in
Chicago. With no iield men, and
their best sprinter disqualihed,
they managed to score 37 points
to U.N.I.'s so, a team with
depth.

Good individual performances
were turned in by Morales who
won the mile in 4:343 and the
hall mile in 2:07. McGrnth
placed first in the two mile with
the reasonable time or 53:44.7,
and Pil'olli won the high jump.

CBS Beats Profs ‘

The Concerned Black Students
showed their true colors Wed»
nesday as they edged the Faca
ulty. 49-46 in a Martin Luther
King, Jr., Scholarship F u n d
Benelit Game.

The battle was closely fought
right down to the wire. The lead
changed hands several times.
The Black Students led at the
half, 2521, but the Profs out-
scored CBS 2524 iri the second
period.

The benefit game brought in
$300 for the Martin Luther King,
in, Scholarship Fund and was
termed successful by CBS presi~
dent, Ernest T. Weston.

The halftime show {eaiul-ed a
raining of door prizes ranging
in value from $1 to $25. The
prizes were sponsored by Crin—
nell businesses and interested
members of the community.

This was the second clash at
the two teams for the benefit
of the Scholarship Fund. which
will aid in tinancing needy
black students at Grinnell. The
combined proceeds [mm the
two games were about $600. The
contribution brought the total
receipts oi the Martin Luther

Blades Score
First Victory

Grinnell's Blades, sparked by
Jeff Mlllikin’s “Hat Trick,"
scored their first victory of the
season last Friday night, as
over Des Moines omaarber

Plaza.

Student-Coach Mike Schaifer
said Jeff was “quite impres-
sive” and played the best game
that he had ever seen the husky

lineman play. Dave Riihe,.

Bruce Graham and Tom Jack-
son added the other tallies.

The Blades were tied 7-7 a
week earlier by this same Des
Muiiies squad. “The real key to
the game was the deiensive
play,” noted coach Schaﬂer.
“We held them to 30 shots while
ﬁring 48 at their goal.”

The Crowd oi nearly 50 spec—
tators got top-rate, “pro-style"
hockey, including a stick and
ﬁst fight which almost got out
of hand and was somewhat ex-
tended after the contest.

Grinnell dropped a e3 deci-
sion the following alternoon to
Graceland on Barber, Again de-
iense was the key, but the situ-
ation was reversed. In spite of
the almost even shooting, 33 for
Grinnell and 31 shots for Grace
land, the Blade defense tailed
to pick up their front lineman
consistently, allowing a Lon-1
confrontation. Blade goals were
picked up by Millikin, Graham,
and Mike Schaii'er.

Tile Blades will carry a 1-10-3
record into their iinnl Sunday
against the Des Moines Ice
Hawks. In two earlier bouts, the
Blades lost 2~1 and (led 2-2. The
game will start at ll in me
Des Moines Ice Alena.

Gray M after

By BILL GRAY

Every year, a certain number
of Sporting events are given the
added lustre of pitting two un-
deieated teams against each
other. This was the case with
Notre Dame - Michigan state
in 1966, Houston - UCLA in
1968, and Dibble ~ OffrCampus
in 1969. The game was tight
throughout and an overtime pe-
riod was fought through beiore
Dibble finally emerged With a
onepoint victory. The iviu leit
Dibble as the last undefeated
team in either league, Read.
OffrCamplls. and the Faculty
follow Dibble ill the "A” league
as they all have only one loss.
Loose took an overtime victory
from East as Grant Crandall
scored 53 points to set a new
scoring record. Loose scored
67 points in that victory. in the
“B" league, Cowles, Clark, and
North are tied tor ﬁrst with
one loss each.

There ‘are a number of 1. M.
sports still on the winter pros-
pectus, including wrestling,
and table tennis. Wrestling will
be somewhat more informal
this year since not enough people
expressed an interest in it to
merit a tournament. Perhaps
I. M. degenerating could be
substituted with class lines de-

termining the divisions (i. e.
senior slump, junior jag-pit.
sophomore slippage. and iresh-
man failing). It might be added
that this type or activity hu-
great co-ed appeal. In addition,

' the local emporiums oi good

cheer (which serve as the play-
ing aieas) could provide the or.
llcials (and some energy-sup.
plying elixir). It seems worth
an eliort since the weekend
promises to provide little oppor.
tunity ior outlet. or course,
that just might be because or
our warped perspective. As a
former grad once said, "Grill-
nell really isn't dull, it lust
seems that way because it’s
right next door to exciting Mon-
tezuma.”

1 am not sure that the White
Caps Show comes under the
category of I. M. sports but
since it provided clean, enjoy-
able entertainment, 1 don't sup~
pose anyone else will deign to
comment upon it. 1 round the
show to be quite enjoyable and
1 issue congratulations to all
those involved for a fine job.
I’ll bet even Lee Mari] and
Gary Giddins would have en-
joyed it except for the whole
someness and good music which
they, apparently, cannot abide

Cagers Take
Second Victory

Grinnell's Pioneers grabbed
their second Midwest Confer-
ence Cage victory last Saturday
at Cedar Rapids, detecting Cue,
73—71 in overtime.

The Grinnell Cagers were led
in scoring by Terry Holloway
and SCDL Hanson. The win
brought the Pioneers‘ season
record to 4-15, their best mark
in three years. They will get
two chances to improve their
record this weekend as Ripon,
