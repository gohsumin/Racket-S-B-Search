Roi'h +ells iirsi impressions

of Grinnell siuclenis, lid-sully

by Paul D. Samuel

l What are the impressions that
a person receives about Grin—
iiell College when he sees it tor
the first. ' aft leav-
ing a foreign .

does he think of the students,
the faculty and the facilities?
How does he feel in such strange
surroundingsl

A man in a position to know

the answers to these questions
is Dr. G'octz Roth, visiting pros
res r of political science at
Grinncll. Dr Roth comes from
Heidelberg, Germany, where he
is a professor at the "Inslllut
fur Fplillschc wissensehait."
' Roth arrived in Grinnell in
February and will stay until
the end of this semester, He is
teaching two courses dealing
with international politics and
politics of Germany

Gray-haired and friendly,
Roth is in his early forties.
His speech is heavily accent—
.ed. but easily understandablc.
neanswers questions pleas-
antly and openly,

“I have not been here long
enough to draw deep conclu»
slons,” Roth said upon being
asked to give his first impres—
sions of Grinnell. “But i can
say that I am very pleased with
the atmosphere of the school.
The facilities are very good,
especially the library. I have not
yet met all the faculty, but those
I have met have been friendly
and helpful. Professor Fletcher
of the political science depart»

. ment has been especially help-
rul.

“I am amazed and pleased at
the informality or contact here

between professors and students,

There is a lack of stiffness
which one does not find on the
Continent. The students, too,
have been very friendly, and i
am beginning to feel at home
already."

Roth had heard of Grinnell
through one ol his colleagues
in Heidelberg. Through this
man he began a correspondence
with Dr.
ually culminated in his invitation
to Grinneil as a visiting profes-
sor.

“But I have met other pet)»
ple abroad who have spoken
highly of Grinncll,” Roth saidr
In Europe, too, Grinnell
known as a line schoul."

That same year, he went into
the German navy. He served on
a destroyer in the Atlantic, and
from 1943 to 1945 commanded

a submarine in the Baltic Sea.’

Alter Germany's capitula—
tion Roth spent two years in
Great Britain as a prisonerrol-
war. While there. he studied
the formation 0! German gave
crnment and .the political sys»
tern of the Third Reich.
in 1947, he returned to Ger.
many and bccz'ime a student at
the University oi
where he studied
sociology and modern history.
He specialized in prohienis oi
German post—war development
and received his PhD. in 1952,
Having taught at tile Institute,

Roth knows much about the
youth of postwar Germany,
“Alter the war," he explained,
"“the youth of Germany became
very skeptical and critical. They
were hard to inlluchce But this
was only on the surface. Basie
ally, they were idealists. Thcy
needed desperately to believe in
something after their world was
shattered. Deep down, they had,
and have today, a tremendous
desire to believe in human val-
lies,”

How does one go about
teaching such students? "It is
difﬁcult,” Roth said. “But .1

teacher who is honest can find ,
it a wonderful experience. All ‘

of Germany’s youth want to
‘know so much. They have so

many questions to ask. You
must be able to answer their
quesLions‘ honestly, uitlrout
tear and without griilt.

“You see, the parents of tor
day's youth, the men and wo—
rncn or my generation, reel guil—
ty about the Germany that they
helped to create, the Germany

do not fulfill their tasks to give
answers to the young people. it
is up to the teachers, and some
teachers cannot or will not reach
them But i have found it a

“One of the Ilnesi. things as
bout the youth or postwar
Germany is their desire to
learn, Student government
Germany is active; but a little
less outspoken than right after-
the war. Students now wish to
study more, But at the same
time, there is an intense feeling
among them that they must be
allowed to govern themselves.

"This is part of their need for
learning. It is a trend among the
young generation to be just, to
be iair to opposite points of
view, and at the sairia timc, to
study other points oi view, Per-
haps this is one of the reasons
why German youth is so inter»
ested in both the United States
and the Soviet Union."

i In an interview Wednesday
‘Gl'itlneii's Chief Librarian lleni-y
Alden and Bookstore Manager-
Samuel Wassom were asked to
comment on the problem or
‘bookstcaling on campus.

The disappearance of books
,froin the library is definitely a
problem according to Alden. “In
the past year," he commented,
"several thousand dollars worth
,of books and magazines have
disappeared permanently from
,library shelves.”

‘ Clrlelly, the types or miller»
ials which disappear are boo
and magazines that are in
great demand. Currently misse
i ing from the library are books

relating to the play, “Quaint.
other types oi books to til
appear are those that prolcss-
ors have announced they are
planning to put on reserve and
books needed by students to
study tor examinations.

The worst thefts, according to
Alden, occurred two ye ago.
shortly after the library put»
chased a new set of the Ency-
elopcdra Britannica. when sev—
eral of the Volumesrdisappeared
and have not been found.

Whilc it is true. Alden said,
that oiten a student or professor
will abscnt-mindedly forget to
check a book out, these books
are almost invariably returned
and even so, the number of
-books to turn up missing is too
lgreat to believe that they were
:all taken unintentionally.

it

’i Alden expressed a degree oi

isurprisc about the whole situae
illon because, as he 'aicl, book
check out and rencyi l proced

llLiI‘ES are so simple, It is sufli

cicnt for a student merely to

"call the library to renew a book

Goctz Roth

'1! necessary illc book can be res
inewed indefinitely until ,somes
one else needs it.

Even if inrs rig books could
be replaced, “I r is quite
oltcn impossible as many of
the books are out of print, they
can never be replaced in time
for a needed purpose, not to

- speak of the great cost of time
and money such replacement
requires. “For every book we
are forced to replace," Alden
said, “we must subtract
money ironi our budget which
could have been used to buy a

new lliluk."
What then, can be done to p
vent the di, ippearancc ol boo
from the libidry? ii the pro
problem does not get any oer—
tor the library may be fore l,
as much as it dislikes to, to in-
stall turnstiles or guards at [he
exits,

However, Alden expi‘esed the
opinion that the Student G
ernment could set up .maehinev'y
whereby ii a student knew ol
another student poscssrng (i.
brary books illegally he could,
without acting as an iniol‘mcr,
let some member of the SGA
know. “It at all possible, we wa it
to avoid using guards or Lum—
stiles." Alden said. "since the H14
stailation of such devices scr—
iously hampers the liberal act—
dernic feeling necessary in a li—
brary."

Bookstore manager Wassom,
asked the same question about
the problem of book caling, said
that in the bookstores case steal-
ing was not a ma, problem.
“While Tm sure that . me stc
ing takes place," he said, -'
definitely minor.”

Of course stealing, when it
occurs, is not coniined solely E0
books but also to other objects
such as pens, etcr Small objects
are most likely to be stolen. The
reason for the lack of mar
stealing problem can be attrib
ed to the use of turnstiles and
the shelves provided for the stu-
dents’ books and parcels neoc
the store door. (Customers 2
expected to place all books aid
packages on the shelves bcfo;c
entering the store.)
