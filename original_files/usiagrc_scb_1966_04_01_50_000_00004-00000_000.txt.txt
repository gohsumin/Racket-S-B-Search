Steiner Directs 'Glass Menagerie’,
Comments on Method and Hopes

BY MARY MALCOLM

"Interest in drama is basic to
interest in literature,” according
to Henry-York Steiner (English),
who makes his debut in directing
with the opening ol The Glass Men-
agerie next week.

Steiner’s production will be
presented next Tuesday, Wednesr
day, and Thursday at s p.m. in
the Arena Theatre. Cast members
are Karyn Zimmerman, Debbie Ab-
bot. Ken Hicks and Chuck Burns.

Steiner chose The Glass Men-
ngerie because at its combined li-
terary valtte, poetic tone, and
small cast. He said he felt a small
cast would be easier to work with
tor an uninitiated director.
'Becanse \Villiains’ play is none
realistic. Steiner (eels that de
sign props, costumes and lighting
are lett to the imagination of the
director. “when you read a play,
you lurnish the costumes, props,
and set with your imagination," he
commented. “One gets the basic
training in imagination through the
study of literature.”

“I think that l have directed the
play in the way an English protes-
sot‘ would and not someone trained
in drama,” Stener said, “l‘ve
paid little or no conscious attention
to what i assume is taught to and
learned by prolessional directors.
rm doing it in terms or training
in a literary approach to drama.”

Also relatively new to the theatre
is Steiner's technical director,
lreshman Kit Leder. The members
of the cast are all veterans, how-
ever. Miss Zimmerman appeared
in The Bourgeousie, while Miss Ab-
hott had roles in Virginia Wolf and
See How They Run. Hicks was also
in See How They Run, as well as
Antigone. Burns was in Oedipus
Rex and Tea and Sympathy.

Steiner decided to direct the
play at the suggestion oi Richard
Meyer (speech and theatre), whom
Steiner described as “helpful and
very tactful” in the actual direc-
tion oi The Glass Menagerie.

“Mr. Meyer was there and would

 

help it I needed him, but I wanted
to do it myself,” Steiner said.

He feels that his set design, use
of music, and stage position are
“natural.” He added. “I’ve tried
to direct the play to conform to

“It it is a success—it people
lose themselves in it and are con-
vinced by it, it the tact that they
are sitting in a theatre disappears
—the credit belongs entirely to the
way in which the actors present
the playwright’s words.”

“The director is a mediator be-
tween the playwright and the ac—
tors, and brings them to that we,
sentation. The actors need the die
rector, and the director needs the
play.”

Steiner said his only surprise
in directing the play came when
he was casting. With 40 students
tiying out tor {our roles, Steiner
ending up selecting an entirely dif—
ferent cast from those students
whom he originally had had in
mind.

The Glass Menagerie, considered
to be one or Wllliams' best plays,
explores the relationship of an am-
bitious mother with her shy, crip-
pled and restless, sensitive son.
