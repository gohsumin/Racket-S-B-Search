The results 0! the student
opinion poll on the major tenants
or the Position Paper are
available. Here are the final
results:

it) Academic policy should be
determined by the (acuity and the
students equally. Personal
matters should he left to the
iaculty.
YES. 69 5 per cht (438)

No: 23.4 per cent (199)

Abst : tl7t

l2) Social rules and their
enforcement should be
determined by a body haying a
student majority.

Yes: 83.5 per cent (Slim

No. 15 8 per cent (lDB)

Abst.: l9)

(3) Community service policies
directly affecting students should

Abst: its)

(4) Counseling services should
be determined with titty per cent
student participation

Yes: 76. 5 per cent (539)

These are very signiiicant
results, and should give the
steering committee a clear
mandate to try and get these
concepts implemented in some
sort of new structure for
governing crinneli College. The
lower percentage in tavor or
question one should not be
construed as a desire by the
student body to deemphasize
student participation in

lFlND YOURSELF. . .)

Call

academic aliairs. I personally
know oi many people who voted
“no" on the first point because,
they (1' agree that personal
matters Should be left to the
faculty, not that students
shouldn’t have a voice in
academic matters.

Tile Student Coordinator is
looking into the reason why
meals in the dining halls cost so
much tor Visitors to the college,
For example, it costs $100 for
hreaktast, and $2.25 tor Sunday
noon meal, The food surely
doesn’t cost Saga that much, nor
does Saga have to pay additional
workers tor the iew people
involved who are visitors.

The new film chairman for next
semester is David Lindblom.
Social coordinator Jon Stein was
optomistic about the film
program for next semester
Rumor has it that the
incomparable “Bedazzled" with
Peter Cook and Dudley Moore
will be returning to Grinnell. DO
NOT MISS THIS FLICK} l l l!

SENATE ElHlT|0N UNRESOLVED

Student government otiiciais
were uncertain Tuesday oi the
’results olMonday’s election to fill
a vacant seal on the student

I. senate. ”In our View no Candidate
received enough votes to win,”
said Frank Thomas, student
coordinator." “Of Course we are
only one segment at student
government,” Thomas added.

Thomas told the 5&8 that the
matter would be turned over to
the election board with a
recommendation from the
student Coordinator’s oltice that
a runoff election he held.
According to student government

now buying books. Bill Thomas
says that the Used Bookstore is
looking forward to a very
successful second semester.
Senators Andrew Brill and
Andrew Loewi arrived at the
Nov. 25 Senate meeting just in
time to vote in favor of
adjournment. Much to their
Chagrin, they found out that it
was the last Senate meeting of
the semester Too bad, guys!
And likewise, this is the last
Senate beat. My final words are.
the Senate really hasn’t done
shit. But then it never does.
However, the move toward
student participation and the

Position Paper, lead by a number ’

oiSenators, is a good thing, one or

the most thimistic things that
has happened around here in a

long time Now it is time for the
students to stick by the steering
committee and talk to prots and
give the philosophy behind the
Position Paper support. Power to
the people!

sources, however, the election
board has already been informed
of the numerical resulLs DI the
election,

“That fact can easily prejudice
their decision as to whether or not
to have another election since
some election board members
favor one candidate over
another,” said one SGA official,
who asked not to be identified,

The three candidates who
received the highest number of
votes and would thus be
considered for the run-oil
election are Alan Cohen, Jim
Silverman. and Johanna Ward.
Thomas Said that it the election
board decides to have a run-off. it
would he held “early next
semester."

The omer candidates were
Jacob Margolin and Paul
Rothman. The senate vacancy
was created by the resignation ot
senator Lynn Aldrich who will not
be on campus next semester.
