To Seniors:

EVENING

Slowly now the evening changes his garments

held for him by a rim of ancient trees,-

you gaze: and the landscape divides and leaves you,
one sinking and one rising toward the sky.

And you are left, to none belonging wholly,

not so dark as a silent house, nor quite

so surely pledged unto eternity

as that which grows to star and climbs the night.

To you is left (unspeakably confused)

your life, gigantic, ripening, full of tears,

so that it, now hemmed in, now grasping all,
is changed in you by turns to stone and stars
