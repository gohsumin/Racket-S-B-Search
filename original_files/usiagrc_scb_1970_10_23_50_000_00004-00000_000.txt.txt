WM» 7/: flon M mm mm

by Alex Knrlinl

Judging from the general in-
competence of the previous
issue of the S&B, and having
been present at the desperate
plea for "more copy" bythe
editor . . . [have acknowled~
gcd my public responsibility
and will now break my journ-
alistic silence. This is amost
opportune moment, for with
the sophomoric background of
the 8&8, the essential mean-
ingless nature of my topicwill
not be so prominently appar
ent. The topicr—studentgow
emment; more specifically--
the fetal campaigns for the
most illustrious office of SGA
president. Perhaps you con~
sider any such analysis as
premature. Perhaps you are
correct. However, I submit
that several politicos on mm,
pus have already made the tie
cision to run for this office.
And with this goalin mind they
have already begun to struc-
ture their activities. I submit
that four prospective contenr
ders are Bill Thomas, Al Ha-
mmond, Jon Stein, and A1 C0-
hen.

Bill Thomas, in an attempt
to extend the Thomas dyn-
asty, is approaching the pres
blem in a straightforward ma-
nner. He is trying to develop
the greatest political expertA
ise and knowledge so as to
overwhelm his opponents with
his competence. His open po-

litical aspirations may work
against him. He will appeal to
the various radicalrmoderate
lcnowledgables, but this block
of votes will not be enough.
He must gain some freshman
vote . . smile harder Bill!

Al Hammond, machiavellian
that he is, will lay low until
the final moments of the cam*
paign. He realizes that the
more he is known, the less
chance he has ofwinning. With
a show of sincerity and power
he is trying to build‘a dormir
tory power base from which to
launch himself. He is a black,
and will win the black vote
only if he is the sole black
candidate. But he definitely
will appeal to the pseudodib-
eral freshmen. Al must work
on his Bill Cosby imitations.

Jon Stein, politically indepr
endent yet knowledgable, must
preform some impressive
maneuver to bring “the peo-
ple" behind him, perhaps lib?
erate the Forum or have an
article written about him in
the Grinnell Magazine. Jon is
definitely a man to oppose the
political bullcrap of the Bru-
ner Thomas- Loewi conSETr
sus, right or wrong. Jon must
stay cool nd flash his ten
speed modi ied english racer
around more.

Finally Al Cohen, radicalyet
sincere, might not be able to
avoid the temptation of the
meaningful office of SGA pre~
sident. Radically versed, pO‘

The SAGA Experience: A“?!

by J. C. Labowitz

Qie of the favorite topics for
discussion around here (at
least one of my favorite topics)
is that institution so close to
our esophagusi, SAGA food.
Some tend to view SAGA as
one of Grinnell's art forms,
along with football gmes and
the Forum grill. Certainly st—
anding in lunch line to eat
Beef Biscuit Surprise must
be classified as a group thea-
ter experience. The ebb and
flow of Grinnelltypeswander»
ing through the dining halls,
along withassorted dogs, cats,
little kids, prospectives and
occasional bat in the Quad,
makes SAGA enjoyable if not
down right tolerable.

Some sort of epitome of Gr-
innell—SAGA theaterrart took
place Tuesday night, which, if
you remember the heartburn,
was Mexican night (ole, or
whatever Right 01 is in Span»
ish). That night saw a world

record shattered-the record
for eating SAGA tacos at one
meal. The old record was set
by the infamous Jim Lew, who,
at lunch at Cowles one day in
the spring of '69, forced down
27 taste-temptingSAGA,tacos.
This record stood until Tues-
day, when Mark Hamilton‘of
Ames, Iowa and Clark Hall,
took aim at that record and,
in a Herculean effort, conr
sumed 28 tacos in about 90
minutes. He finished the last
taco atthe Forum and received
an ovation at the SAGA grill
meeting in South Lounge.

One more thing aboutSAGA ,
anyone frequenting Cowleshas
to be impressed with the way
SAGA Jo runs things over
there (she's the one in the
Schlitz bowling shirt on Fri»
days). She has been in the hos-
pital, andwe wishhera speedy
recovery and hope she gets
back dishing the Shepherd’s
Pie real soon.

litically active, Cohenwill find
little real support on the pseu-
do? left, most ofwhom graduar
ted and sold out to the various
institutions (a' la the Woodrow
Wilson School of Political Sc-
ience)l Cohen must moderate
his approach and become a bit
more objectively critical of
the Grinnell situation.

OCTOBER 23, 1970

Decisions Come Down

In order to alleviate what
they called the “uncontrollr
able” line-cutting problem,
an AdrHoc Senate committee
has formulated the following
rules and procedures:

Only four categories of stu-
dents are allowed to cutSAGA
lines:

a.) SAGA workers who are
working the meal for which
they arecutting. Workers are
encouraged if at all possible
to eat the early SAGA meal
instead of cutting the cafeteria
line. SAGA workers who are
nOt working a specific meal
can cut, but are obliged to
substitute if necessary. Cuts
can only be taken in the cafe-
teria at which the worker
works.
lb.) “Jocks" who have just
completed practice. Athletes
are permitted to cutonlyafter
their practice, and they are
permitted to but only during
the season of the sport in \th
ich they participate. Jock cuts
are permittedonlyatthe even-
ing meal Monday through Frir
day.

c.) Those people who have
classes that adjourn at 11:50
or later and who also have a
class or lab that begins at
12:30 or 12:45. Those people
are permitted to cut if, in
their judgement, it would be
impossible for them to wait
in line and get to their class

Political Activity At A low

by Laurie McCallum

With the sermlled “Election
break" approaching, it is
ironic tonote the politicalapa‘
thy that is engulfing Grinnell.
There appears to be little or
no interest on campus inpolir
tical campaigning as evinced
by the problems facing the
Blobaum-forCongress moi
vement now underway. This is,
in fact, the only such move
ment on campus.

‘ Circulars, posters,andmeeo
tings aroused the support and
active participation of around

20 people in the Blobaum mm’

paign for Democratic congre-
ssman from this district . . .
20 people out of an enrollment
of 1265 Students.

This is certainly a radical
drop in the level of political
involvement from that sure
rounding last year’s moratorr
ium and this year's Cambod-
ian crisis. David Landecker,
president of the Student Dem-
ocratic Coalition, cites sevr
eral reasons for this.

Basically, he says, students
were "turned off" by the Nix-

(Continued to page 7)

or lab on time after a reason-
ably relaxed meal.

d.) A person who has a bona
fide class or activity which
he will be unable to attend on
time unless he cuts. Such a
student, if at all possible, shv
ould make arrangements togo
to the cafeteriaatatimewhich
will allow him to get to his
activity on time without
cutting.

It is illegal for a friend to
accompany a person taking an
otherwise legal cut. It is ille»
gal to hold a place in line for
a person unless he entered the
line at the same time as the
holder and had to leave mom'
entarily.

Abuse of cutting rules and
privileges is one of the big-
gest reasons why the cutting
problem is so great. If only
these four categories of peo-
ple cut the lines, most of the
difficulty would be solved. It
is everyone's responsibility
to be aware of the cutting ru-
les and to enforce the rules
on themselves, and if some
refuse to control themselves
to enforce the rules on others.

Whenever anyone cuts into
the cafeteria line, it» is his
responsibility to state to the
people directly behind him
briefly and politely why he is
cutting. The people who are
directly behind those who cut
should probablyaskwhyaper»
son is cuttingifthe cutter does
not volunteer the information.

If students will cooperate
with theabove-statedpolicies,
the lineecutting problem can
be solved. Grinnell students
who claim they are adult en-
ough to live together with a
minimum of coercion have a
chance to prove it. Let’s see
if we really are adult enough
to govern ourselves.

The a‘b‘ove statementwaswr-
itten by Greg Vranimr and
amended and approved by Pe-
ter Palmisano, Chris Anderr
son, Kathy Ogle and Barry
Zigas. It will become official
policy upon publication‘in Vr-
anicar's epistle scheduled for
distribution early next week.

Grinnell EducationCanChange

, by Henry Scheff

Grinnell has had a Free Uni»
versity on and off for a few
years. It has always been plar
gued by lack of enthusiasm
manifested in the small num-
ber of course offerings, the
small number of students who
participated, and the rate of
failure of the courses. The
present Free University
seems to have fallen into the
some rut.

However, this cannot be taken
as evidence that students are
satisfied with the academic
environment here. Manystud-
ents who feel that academics
at Grinnell are inadequate
take independent projects and
group seminars. This consu-
mes much of their time, and
they get credit for these ef-
forts, so why participate in a
Free University? It seems
clear that students who are
dissatisfied are still into going
to college, working for credit,
and getting a degree. Thus,
any meaningful alternative to
the educational process at
Grinnell must work in part
through the institution in order
to gin the sanction ofthe col-
lege.

A feasablc plan for an alter-
native is within easy reach of
students who are committed
enough to make it work. At
present, possibilities existfor
groups of students to get colr
legc credit for Group Inde-

pendent Projects. The plan is
simply to bring students ter
gether soon to begin planning
a whole series of these group
independents. Sincc old limit
tations on the amount of inde-
pendent study a student could
take were abolished at the
beginning of the semester, a
student could concievably take
all his work in independent
study. The possibility also
exists for students to get more
than four credits for a single
project if they can justify the
additional credits. Thus, six-
teen-credit group independ-
ents are not out of the ques-
tion, especially if they are
interdisciplinary in nature.
What can an emersion in
Group Independent Study do
for a Student7 It has the po-
tential of giving him a voice
in every aspect of the acad-
emic situation, including de-
signing the course, picking
the professors, picking the
methods, materials, methods
of evaluation, class procedr
ures , in Other words,itgives
the student a real opportunity
to participate in a truely col-
lective educational experi?
nce. Students may be encour
aged to interact with other
students for criticism and in-
formation rather than relying
on the professor for all of
these things.

It is not hard to imagine
what effect this might have on
the college if many students

became interested in this sort
of work. Professors might
have to drop courses to free
time for consultation on these
projects, and departments
might have to change offerings
to attract students who could
otherwise do independents.
The end result could bea dra‘
matic change in Grinnell Col-
lege.

This, of course, is pure spe-
culation. However, at worst,
this experiment will certainly
make next semester more in? ‘
teresting. If you are interes»
ted in this sort of educational
experience (and, if success
ful, these projects may be
rougher thannormal courses),
put your name, box number,
and phone number in the box
marked EXPERIMENTAL
COLLEGE in the post office,
and expect to begin to work
HARD after midsem break to
plan these projects and make
it work.
