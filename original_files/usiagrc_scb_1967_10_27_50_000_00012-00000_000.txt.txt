It is Super week-end and with
life influx of dignitaries and as<
sorted other lesser luminaries
Iparents, brothers. sisters, boy
and girl friends), there is a
hance that my incisive, 56:th
ng and uproan‘ously witty col-
umn will attain nation-wide

mminence and I will be lifted

the level of a collegiate
Grantlsnd Rice. I feel it is now
that i must make my move to-
ward posterity for time is pas‘
sing me by. Did you realize, for
'xnmpie, that by the time King
dward VI of England was my
ge, he had been dead for four

ears? V

l. M. sports were at s low
ebb Est week unless you wish
to include glass-breaking and

edaliion-grabbing as part of

o l. M. agenda. After check-
ng carefully, I discovered this
is not included in the Truesdaio
ltandings so I will pass it by
with no further mention. Swim<

ing was held last Sunday and
Ramon, with Bnice Rollins
winning three events. edged out
Pleat by three points. Ten hails
lntered which doubled last
ear's turnout (are you listen-

The second major sport of the
year begins next week as vol-
leyball moves to the forefront
of athletic endeavor. North is
defending champion as they
have been from time lmmemor-

lal. Be sure to watch next week‘
for my column which will dis-
cuss Volleyball and the liberal
arts college in a world of change.

I have been forced to endure
a great deal of antagonism to

ward the ideas and opinions ex-»

pressed in this column during
the year. Being a person of
great moral conviction and ob-
livious to possible retribution,
I would like to take this op«
portunity to express my journa-
listic credo, “If anyone objects
to any statement I make, I am
quite prepared not only to re.
tract it, but also to deny under
oath that I ever made it."

Then will be a pep rally,
complete with cheerleaders.

SCARLET AND BLACK

BELOIT
BLANKS
GRID ERS

For the first time in two years
the Scarlet and Black griddel‘a
have been shut out, Beloit topped
Grinnell 234) last Saturday in a
game played without the Plan
neer's r e g u i a r quarterback,
Doug Fink. Doug spent the day
on the bench because of a dish
ciplinary infraction.

The game was primarily a
defensive one as Grinnell was
held to 38 yards of offense.
Beloit was limited to 234 yards
which was one of the top de<
fensive performances by the
Pioneers this year. Actually the
Pioneers rolled up over 100
yards of offense on the ground
but this had to be subtracted
from the total lost when the
quarterback was caught behind
the line while attempting a pass.

Tomorrow is the last home
game for the Pioneers this
year. It will be played against
Monmouth in front of an ex-
pected capacity homecoming
crowd. Fink is expected to be
back in action for the Monmouth
game.

The Scots have been a sun.
prising team this year. Two
weeks ago they pulled a big
upset by beating Ripon, 14—7.
Their record is 3-2 compared
with Grinnell's L4 record.

This is also a career record
for Doug. Other finishers for the

THE lilthZER

When South say the dummy
of his four Heart contract he
could count five losers: one
spade, two diamonds and two
clubs. He could throw one of
them on a spade honor but he
would still have four losers for
down one. His only chance
would be to force a defender to
give him a Siuff and a ruff, so
he chose “the play to make,"
and assumed that he would get
a “best of all possible worlds"
distribution in clubs and hearts.

The opening Spade Jack was
covered by dummy's Queen
which was taken by the Ace.
The Queen of diamonds was re-

turned and allowed to hold. West continued with the Jack of dia-
monds and South put up the Ace. Declarer then entered the board
with the heart Jack and played the spade King shifting the
remaining diamond from his hand. Dummy'l last spade was then
ruffed in hand and the board reentered with the heart King. Dum-
my’s last diamond was then ruffed in hand and South was ready

to execute the endplay.

Trump had been pulled and both the North and South hands
were void of spades and diamonds. If South could induce one of
the defenders to lead a spade or a diamond he could get ii ruff
and a slufi. Declaror laid down the Ace of clubs and if West had
followed with the deuce, the contract would have made, but by this
time West had counted down South's hand. .

West knew that South had two other clubs and that the Queen
was probably not one of them since declarer would have preferred
the finesse over the endplay. West's only alternative was to dump
the King of Clubs under the Ace and hope that his partner had the
Queen and Jack. When South led the second round of Clubs he was

down.

South could have made the contract if he had played the club
Ace early. At the fourth trick, even the best defender would be re<
luctant to part with the club King to prevent a possible endplay.
Furthermore, at the fourth trick West could not have counted down

South’s distribution.

 

Bob Asbille, fourth; Spencer
Clark, sixth; John Siekert, eighth
George Potter, tenth; and Bruce
Lueke, eleventh.

Tomorrow the Pioneers take
on Monmouth at 1:50 and will
attempt to move their confer-
ence record past the .50ﬂ mark.
