Weekend duels
to test leaders

The Pioneers continue their
heavy cage action this weekend
as they hit the road once more
to meet Lawrence on Friday
night and Ripon Saturday after-~
noon.

Coach John Pfltsch classified
the weekend’s contests as “must
games.” as he believes the cag-
ers need these games to hang
onto their share of first place.

Lawrence, at the bottom of the
Conference heap with a 0.10
mark, should not be tough for
the Pioneers to top, but the Vik—
ings will be looking for the big,
upset. Lawrence's leading- scor-
ers are Joel Ungrodt, with 16.5
a game, and Jim Jordan, with
14.5,

Ripon, on the other hand, has
a big ,tough squad, which ac-'
cording to Coach Pfitsch. runs
both hot and cold. He added
that after seeing the Redmen
knock off Cornell Monday night.
he couldn’t understand how
they had lost six Conference
games.

At Ripon the Pioneers will
have to contend with the big—
gest forwards iii the Conference,
as starters Bruce White, Diek
Papke, and Gary Mervis all
stand over 6-5. in their first
meeting of the season these
three held the boards. but the
Grinnell cagers were able to
outrun and outshoot the Redmen
in gaining the victory. Also John
Sundell, Grinnell‘s 6.7 center
was injured and -did not play
in the first encounter of the two
clubs.

Scarlet; Faver

By Jim Hcrzog _
“Operation Migration" will long be remembered by the Pie.
iieer backers who travelled by bus and car to Monmouth and

Knox for the six weekend events. _

At friendly Monmouth, it was soon noticed in the unbiased
student newspaper, the “Oracle,” that only Friday night's has.
ketball game was previewed. The swimmers were conscientious-
1y overlooked. and the matnient could have been thumbiwrest-
lers as far as the “Oracle" was concerned. .

1n the basketball preview an‘ unidentified Monmouth writer
penned the following superb phraseology:

Grim-tell is so confident of victory that some 100 (sic)
students have announced in advance that they will he com~
ing over in buses and cars to celebrate “the Yioneer will over
Monmouth."

 

There is no fitting comment that 1 can make cxcept to as.
sure the Grinncllians that no such tripe will appear in the Scar.
let and Black.

After the Pioneers proved they were anything but DVCr-,

confident by‘fighting hard and losing to tho Scots, the hackers
and athletes alike went to the Custer Hotel. in Galcsburgr 111., to

seek a night's repose.

At least the athletes went to sleep; but the “Migratol's,” with
nothing on the agenda till 1:30 Saturday afternoon, held an “lrish
Wake" which may have precipitated the Custer's last stand.

Then after proudly and loudly cheering the swimmers and
wrestlers on to victory, an afternoon of bridge in the Knox

‘ Union began That night the Pioneer athletes picked up their

third Win of the day, and the successful Weekend ended.

I'd like to add that the only effect of the Migration was good,
that the backers cheered the various teams on to five victories in
six contests, and that Coach John Pfitsch felt the Migration was
extremely beneficial to the Pioneers.

Finally, the Pioneer backers displayéd fine sportsmanship '-

throughout the weekend. Their fine attitude Was exemplified by
the standing ovation they gave Jeff Sandburg of Knox when he
had to be helped off the Court after painfully reinjuring his
shoulder.
