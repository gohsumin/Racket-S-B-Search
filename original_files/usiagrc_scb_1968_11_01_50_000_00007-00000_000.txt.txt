used as guidelines. Schneirov
bad permitted a girl to stay in
his room {or live days. He was
warned about his violation but
he said that he liked her and
wanted her to stay.

In a brief interview with
Eehlieimv after Leggett’s deci-
sion, Schneirov said that he
tavmed dormitory policies de.
termined by the students. He
did not comment on how these
policies were to be enforced. in
the statement prepared by Bon-
nie Tinker and Schneirov they
maintain that the responsibility
for the regulation of dormitory
life should rest with the stu-
dents. This implies student en<
larcement or violations. The
Student Senate has stated that
It does not believe Schneitov
should be punished for his VlUla‘
tion.

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee of 22 members met Wetl-
nesday. They generally agreed
that there has been little im-
provement over last year's cur-
riculum. Ideally, they would
like to see the institution of
credit—fail grading in all non»
major courses.

Among those at the meeting
were Don Marquardt, chair—
man; Mr. Kurz, Sociology De-
partment; Dennis Dunham,
R. A.; Ernest T. Weston, Fresir
dent of 6.3.5.; and Molly Mal-
colm of S.D.S,

Mr. Kurz pointed out that
there are many faculty mem-
bers who are in favor or a
change of curriculum for the
good or the college. They leel
that these changes should be
made in curriculum policy rath-
er than simply in a few courses.

Marquardt, who disagreed
with having courses required,
iceling they don‘t allow choice,
asked "How good is a common
experience?"

But Miss Malcolm disagreed
saying, “We (at Grinnell) should
have more a sense or mission;
students need to be exposed
to courses they normally
wouldn’t take.”

In reply Marquardt asked
whether we should put students
in ditterent classes according to
ability. Miss Malcolm, who is
vehemently opposed to tracking
by ability feels that stlldents
can learn from each other.
“There is no need for students
to have a common heritage as
long as they have common prob-
lems.”

A student concluded the dis-
cussion saying, “It’s not that
everyone has read the lliad;
it's that everyone can read the
Iliad.”

All students and faculty are
invited to the next meeting of
the Student Curriculum Commit-
tee next Wednesday, at 4:15, in
the Forum Private Dining Room

SECRET ADVICE
FOR WOMEN

By PHOEBE CLAIRE

“Men always want to he a
Woman's first love. That Is
their clumsy vanity. We wom—
en have a more subtle instinct
about things. What we like is
to be a man’s last romance."

Oscar Wilde

Girls, I am writing this col-
umn to help you in what is the
most important adventure in
your liic a catching a man.
Grinnell College itself presents
certain problems in this pur-
suit, but with a little clever:
ness and just a bit of scheming,
you can get the man you want.

Every man, even the stupid—
est 03f, thinks that he is “hot
stuff.” The smart girl Will cons
vinCe her eyes apple that he
is not “hot" to the world, but
he is berore her eyes alone.
This Way he will feel superior
only in your company, and it
you are the smart girl that you
are, his vanity will be ap-
peased and you will have taken
your lirst step in shoving him
into that intellectllal contusion
that is called falling in love.
Falling in love with you really
means that you have made him
fall in love with himself.

Men are, in general, vulgar,
bad-tempered, ill-mannered,
lazy, and violent. These charac-
teristics are so bad that lf any
man saw himselt the way he
really is, he would know that
he was unfit to live, and he
would commit suicide. Why
do so few men kill themselves?

Nature has instilled into ev-
ery man a small helping ot
sell-love. This is an indulgent,
Pandemian kind of love. It
makes a man overlook his
faults, or at least tolerate
them. This selfrluve is how na-
ture implants the will to sur-
vive in men.

Now we girls mllst help na-
ture along. We must increase
this self-love of theirs, and by
doing this we endear ourselves
to them.

i have used up all my space,
But it you need any adVice ot
a private natute, send a post-
card to me c/o the Scarlet and
Black and I will send you
the needed answers.

} Saga Strike
(Continued from Page I)

Saga workers would have to be
extended around campus, ac»
cording to Pomerenk. All cam-
pus jobs are granted through
the linancial aid program, al-
though many workers are not
receiving a iinancial aid pack-
age from the School. Of the 375
students employed on campus,
210 work for Saga.

Next February 1, the base
pay will increase to shall/hr. as
a result of a new minimum
wage law. At that time, accord-
ing to Mr. Pomerenk, all incre-
ments Will be eliminated. Dur-
ing the last three years the
base wage has risen lrom
ESC/hr. with increments to the
present level.

"we are not at all pleased
with the threat of a strike,"
said Pomerenk, “because it is
not appropriate to the special
relationship between the college
and the workeis." He was re-
rerring to the tact that jobs are
granted as I iorm of financial
aid.

According to Shaw, “the
Quad workers will strike Sat—
urday morning as a matter or
principle and will hold out until
the demands are met" if there
are no developments in Friday's
meeting.

Student workers in the Quad
had a chance to sign one or two
petitions. One stated that they
were willing to strike; the other
stated that they were sympathe-
tic With the strikers but for
economic reasons could not
strike, 69 workers signed the
first petition; the remaining five
signed the second. Student
workers at Cowles have no plans
to either strike or support the
strikers at the Quad,

Shaw expects support lrom
other students and some mem»
bers of the administration and
faculty, but the Quad workers
have not solicited the aid or any
other students. “We feel that
this is Just between Saga, the
college, and us," said Shaw.
The rumored student strike or-
ganlzed by the SDS is entirely
unrelated to the Saga strike.
Shaw was unaware of the SDS'S
plans.

For hungry students “food
servtce Will be provtded in the
event Of a strike,” Said Mr.
Hand. “We hope that there will
not be a Strike; this Could be
settled before Saturday morn<
lng.”

capable oi taking meaningtui
action upon an issue or great
concern to the college COl'l'll'l'lu-
nity.” Their statement repri-
manded the council for present-
ing the Student Affairs Com<
mittee with proposals tor
changes rather than to the stu-
dent body. The statement also
defended the actions of Grant
Crandall and the Senate, who
had been reprimanded by the
court.

In an ettort to inﬂuence the
president, a petition was circle
lured by the local sps charging
that the president did not have
the jurisdiction to decide the
case.

Entire Senate
Supports Cornell
Black Students

on Wednesday, Oct. 23, the
Student Senate passed unant-
mously a resolution presented
by Tom Thomas supporting the
Black Students‘ demands at
Cornell college, and condemn
ing the administration’s hark
dling oi the situation. The reso.
lution was then sent it? Dr. 9.
E. Stumpt, president of Con-
nell, and to The Cornellian.

The proposal to the Senate by
Thomas was a reaction to what
he considered a poor way of
handling the disturbance which
occurred at Cornell on Oct, 17.
The Black students of Cornell
put on a demonstration and
took over the administration
building before their demand.
were made known to the Cole
lege ofﬁcials. The trustees de-
cided to expel the students, but
later modified their judgment
to immediate suspension until
disciplinary action could be
taken for the charge or dison
derly conduct. ‘

In a personal letter to Presto
dent Stumpf, Thomas con-
demned the administration’-
failure to operate through the
regular channels that had been
set up to deal with this type of
problem. As Thomas stated in
the letter, “Separating the le-
gitimacy or the students’ de.
mands and the manner of their
presentation irom the question
of discipline for their actions —
as I think must be done —‘ I be-
lleve the College's decision was
unduly arbitrary, unfortunate-
ly pressured, and unnecessarily
harsh.

“in any case 01 civil disobe-
dienCe the individual must be
prepared to suffer Conse-
quences, but he also has the
right to expect that these con-
sequences be rendered by legal
procedure, Institutional reaction
in such cases must not come
through ex post facto policy. i
believe that in this case the ill-
Considered action of the admire
istration is subject to far greats
er condemnation than the ac-
tions of the students."

Thomas went on to mom
mend immediate reinstatement
of the students, disciplinary
action through prescribed Chan-
nels, and only then, after the
set system has been shown due
respect, the consideration or the
students' status as affected by
a demonstration.

The Senate resolution sent to
the president and The Cornel-
lian included the same ideas as
Thomas’ original letter, and
also urged the immediate im-
plementation of three or the fOtLI'
of the BIack students' demands,
which tire: 1) that 10% of the
convocation lecturers be Black;l
2) that a Black curriculum be
set up and instituted; 3) that
Black instructors and at least
one Black adviser be hired by
the college. The fourth propos-
al, that there be built a Black
Strident Center, was also urged
for consideration.
