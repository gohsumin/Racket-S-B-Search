FBI Cooperation llnwise

This week President Glenn Leggett announced that the college
“would no longer act in an intermediary capacity" between the
FBI and Grinnell Students. The college will continue to offer stu-
dents advice concerning their legal rights. This policy is to be

commended.

Although we recognize the college's “sincere concern" for the
wellare of students that prompted them to call students and relay
information (mm the FBI. the college must not become involved
in those situations that are essentially matters between students
and legal authorities. Such involvement jeopardizes the college
and may easily become detrimental to the student

If Grinnell is to truly develop “mature. thinking individuals,"
students must neither expect nor receive the well-intentioned pro-

tection oi the college.

The new policy of the college in this area recognizes the dis-
tinctions between “in loco parentis” and the legitimate counsel-
ing function of the institution. This distinction must be main-

tained.

Abolish Comps Now

On Monday the iarulty is expected to come to a vote on the
question or abolishing the senior comprehensive examination. The
scope of arguments on both sides prevents repetition here.

The present comprehensive examination,

an archaic and

meaningless requirement in its present form. should be abolished

immediately.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Find Common Ideals

To the Editor:

Our generation has proclaimed
the noble ambition of world tiar-
mony; unity among races. na-
tions and neighborhoods. But
somehow we have failed to re
cognize the unity among our»
selves. Actually. we spring
train a common background.
Most of us are the children of
parents who have seen the rav-
ages of an economic depression
and a world war, and who have
consequently tried to protect
us from the horror of those
realities, We have been given
material comforts, economic
wellrbeing. and an excellent 09'
portunity to improve our situa
tion still turther through edu-
cation. The result. nevertheless.
has otten been a nonchalant ac,
ceptanco of what is offered.
an impatience for every gratin-
cation. and then a shocked dis-
may at. our belated confronta-
tion with the politico-econDr
sooio-personal reality of things.
it this strikes a familiar chord,
it should. it is a common disil-
lusionment, although our rents
tions to it Vary from protest to
adaption to withdrawal.

We are faced. moreover. with

Kenn Yedcrsen, turn

a common challenge for the in-
ture: to accept the fact that the
world is not an ideal dwelling
place; and to work to bring it
closer to the ideal which we
must establish for the next
generation. as our parents have
done before us, Certainly those
who have been hrandcd conser-
vatives can see our link with
the past; likewise. those who
are named liberals can see our
connection with the tuture, 1t
wc can perceive continuity be
tween generations. then why
have wc so failed to recognize
the similarities with n our own
generation? Why, even among
coitege students. is there so
much resentment and apparent
disagreement?

The answer :les in our self
evasion. We are surrounded so
closely by so many people who,
alter all. are so like us. that we
feel the need to individualize—
if not individually, then in
groups. In other words. we
want to be different from our—
selves. The result is several
clusters of people. grouped
around {also images. which have
become cults or teiishes. Each
or us is classified according to
the length or his hair, or by
the arm band that he wears, or
refuses to wear, The image
identifies the person as a mem.
ber of a particular faction. and
tends to alienate others who
do not look or act as he does,
We have thus individualizcd
ourselves ‘ albeit in groups 7
almost to the point or forget
ting our common heritage. itself
paradoxically the cause or our
separation.

What is to be done? How are
wcto putinto practice
the harmony that we preach in
theory? Perhaps we should
abandon all attiliations Indeed.
a recent article in the Des
Moincs Register has suggested
that the principal stimulus ror
war is man’s mass devotion to
various causcs. Yet. a universal
rcnnneiat on of human devotion.
even it it were possible. would
scvci- all tics among us. leaving
only chaos and greater aliena-
tion. We would be fighting a
cold war or apathy among indi-
viduals, rather than a hot war
oi interests among factions. and
no one would be the winner.

We must therefore. ﬁnd

ideals that we can share, as
universally as possible. instead
of joining a group to find a
ready-made identity. we must
search ourselves individually.
to discern what it is we really
believe. Only then can we do.
clare ourselves according to the
origins that have tormed us.
and the needs which call us
iorward Because of the simi-
larities among us. we would
probably find that we agree
with each other more than we
had realized. Hopefully. then.
we would understand that it is
not our various costumes and
political labels that are of ultir
mate importance; but rather the
common sympathies which lie
beneath them.

Let me say that i realize the
issue has been oversimpliﬁed
here; otherwise, i could not
have discussed it so brieily.
What I would lke to know is:
do you agree with what i have
said? Do you disagree? Why?
I'm not looking to start a tight
_neccssarily~lust some com-
munication. Without it. there
is no cure for the isolation
which i have described. and
which 1 suspect many ot us reel.

"Hurrah for Nixon!"

President Nixon asks for our

He assures us, based on past
pertormnnce averages, that at.

Bob Hodierne. a reporter in
Vietnam for the Pacific Stars

article sent recently to a U.S.
underground paper tor publi-
cation. Hodierne predicted that
the Army will keep “running
happy young boys up scabby
hills, and calling it victory and
glorying in the black. swollen
piles of bodies. their monu-
mentl"

Hodierne does not pretend to
be a radical, just a reporter
who wants to tell the truth as
he sees it. but the war is go-
ing so badly tor the US. that
the Army cannot even control
its own “unofficial" official
newspaper (the Pentagon pays
Stars 8: Stripes bills).
