Thinclads Place 8th
At Cornell Relays

Grinneii’s thinciads ran into some tough
competition and bad luck at Mt. Vet'-
non’s Cornell Relays last Saturday as
the Pioneers took eighth in a field of
twelve schools. Overcoming strong bids
by SCI and Central, Luther College won
the team trophy, Grinneli’s cause was
hurt by lack at good periormances in
the field events and poor baton passes
in the sprint medley. Captain Jeri Lang-
ham remained the foundation of the
Grinneli team as he led the two-mile
relay team of MacDowell, Kelsey, Brint-
nail, to a third place iinish. Langham
again led the mile relay (Watt, Schwartz,
Brintnall) to a second place iinish. Along
with Jon Busweli’s iiith in long jump,
these relay teams were Grinnell's only
point winners at the day.

Both the varsity and trash teams
move to Cedar Falls and the Dickinson
Relays this weekend where, though the
competition will be at least as strong,
they hope to improve their showing.

score remained 2-1, With both Sides gets

score. Then the Rams punched across
a run in both the seventh and eighth
frames, Tilly went the route for the Pio-
neers to even his record at L1 as he
stroked out two hits to lead the Grinneu
batsmen.
Spirits High

The next port at which the Pioneers
docked was Galesburg, Illinois. The
L’mox Siwashers were fresh from a
drubbing by Monmouth. and the Grinnell
players’ spirits were “high,"

The game turned out to be a pitcher‘s
dual between Grinnell’s Dean and
Knox’s Litney. The ﬁrst sixnandra-half
innings were scoreless as neither team
could tally although both had several
chances,

Scores in Seventh

back in the next frame with a marker

bases and another free pass to Bob

duai played here Saturday. The first
one was to powerlul Carleton 9-D while
sr. Olat squeaked by 54 when they took
three doubles matches to overcome a
4-2 singles deficit.

While the Carleton shutout does not
seem very encouraging, it must be re-
membered that last year’s second place
Pioneer team was also shutout against
Carleton in the opening meet of the
year. That one was played at Carleton.

Only twice were the Carls extended

singles Mike Greenﬁeld won the first
set only to lose the next two. And at
number three singles, Elija Hicks lost
the first set,‘ won the second one 7.5,
but imally succumbed in the third one
W. In the other seven matches the
Pioneers went down in two sets.

The Pioneers started out well against
St. Olaf when‘Greentield blitzed his op-
ponent 62, 6-1). After Dick Lovell and
Hicks lost at two and three, the Pioneers
ran oit three wins in a row, Jim Greene

5351' Still Leads
Softball League

As the intramural softball tournament
moves past the halfway point, only
East Norris still has an undeieated reo-

Drd. Three teams now have one loss—
Smith, Dibble, and Clark. Smith and Dib«
ble have already lost to East while
Clark lost to Dibble and was scheduled
to play East this aiternoonr

The biggest game or the year'came

, Tuesday when an overly-conﬁdent crew

from Smith ran into the East Grinder.
While the East tans watched as their

’ boys careiully kept the score down, by

making many errors, so as not to make a
rout of the game. the Smith ians glumiy
sat on the sideline and watched their buys
slowly fall from the ranks Hi the un-
deieated.

By their and others' admission, Smith
had a tough team. They had iirebali-
ing Henry wingate on the mound, and
such potent hitters as Jim Randall to
back hiln up. But Wingate could not fire
the ball past the East batters and Ran-
dall only managed one hit.

East got behind in the iirst inning
4-1, but the East fans were not Worried
because East had been behind early in
tour oi its tirst iive games.

in the second inning East started roll-
ing. Normally a singles hitter, Coach Jim
Wilson slammed a three-run homer past
the astonished iett fielder to tie the
score. Later in that inning, East took
the lead they never gave up. With
Steve Casey spearheading the attack
with three hits, and left-handed hurier
Greg Rankin mowing down the Smith bat-
ters, East took a 14-7 lead into the bot<
tom of the seventh. After Rankin be-
came a little wild on the mound and
East made a couple of errors, Ken
Sturbler, ace relieier on the East staff,
came in to preserve the 14—11 victory.

Smith then dropped to a three-way tie
{or second With powerful Dibble and
Clark. Dibble, since their opening loss
to East, has looked like the toughest
oi the three. Among their wins is a
17-2 shellacking of Clark. Clark's four
wins have come against second division
opponents so it is tough to evaluate
their potential.
