oi history added:

“Fortunately there is no fund—
amental contlict between the
universal rights ot the run-Dis
the—mill maiority and the spec-
l ial rights of the gitted minority.
The gitted minol'ity’s natural
gifts are not Just gifts for them~
selves They are gitts tor the
whole human race.

“Belng giitcd is not the same
as being gooc the historian

added. “Only the pursuit of God
gives us the chance of being
good, and the pursuit of God is
Iopen to all human beings.

“Therefore gitted human be.
ings are always under the tempt.
lation to take an uniust advant—
age over their natural ,gifts.
lNatui-al gifts give their possess-
ors power over their less gifted
tellow human beings. Power is
not evil in itself. But a pos-
sessor of power is under tempt-
ation to abuse his power by us-
ing it. not publlcsspiritedly, but
selfishly.

“If the gilted minority is to
make its gifts bear fruit, it must
lhave leisure to cultivate them.
in must be relieved or having to
’pl‘aduce the food on which it
tlives, in other words, it must
the led by the work of the m
lof—tlie-mill majority. It the rn
:nority did not receive this ser—
tvice, it would not be able to
1develop its gifts.

l “But in accepting a service,
‘ committing itself to that

it is
duty of using its gifts unselfish—l
ly in the general interest. The
improvements in lite that Itl
achieves through the use of its
:gitts ought not to be monopolized
for itseli and its friends and.
relatives; the benefit ought tel
be shared with the rest ot sos‘
‘cicty. This is one of the ties
tmands made by social nistiee."

Staying on
Dr Toynbee made
tlionzll observations:
‘ “Nobody opposes social jus
‘ticc in principle or in the alr
lstract, but agreement ends when
we attempt to make our own
definition ot it.

because human beings are;
neither completely equal to oust
another, nor completely unequal t
We are all equal in some re
specls and it is just that, at
these points, we should have;
equal rights. In other points
equality might not be just.

“For instance, we all have the
right to lite and liberty, and l
deliberately omit ‘the pursuit of
happiness' irom this list. I be-
lieve that if one pursues happi-
ness, it eludes him. But if one
pursues God and finds Him, he
might Just incidentally find haps
piness

“I do not believe we all have
an equal right to the pursuit of
beauty, truth, knowledge, and
skill We have a right to pursue
these boon: only in so far as we
have a natural gilt for pursuing
them. In these fields, humans‘
are unequally endowed by na-
ture This is a natural ilijusticei
(or which man is not morally re~
sponsible, and which he cannot
undo. It is one of the facts of
life that we have to accept. ,

“A characteristic feature of’
our age is that the majority care
more for equality than tor lilo-l
arty Liberty and equality are'
always in tension with each
other. Unrestricted liberty
would produce an intolerable
inequality; unrestricted equality
would stifle liberty and paralyze
the naturally gifted individual‘st
use of his gitts. Liberty and.
equality can only he adjuslcdl
to each other by compromise;‘
they Cali'only be reconciled by

 

‘i'l'aternity; and human fraternity,

can only be achieved as an inch.
dental result of finding God. .

“The extraordinary recent de-v
velopnients of technology seem]
to be producing two different;
etteets, which pull in opposite;
directions to each other. Byl
creating abundance, technologyl
has evoked a demand for equal-,
ity among the poverty-stricken‘y
naiority ol' mankind. But at the

me tune, the special naturah
glits that make scientists and
technicians have become so iin-l
poi-tant to society that societyt
has had to provide special con-
ditions loi- learning and doing‘
their jobs, and these are condi—
tlons of social privilege t

“In the society of our day,"
“there will
