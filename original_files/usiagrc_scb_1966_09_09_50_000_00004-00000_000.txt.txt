Africa have set up stresses and
strains in the whole world that
‘ er the realism nor the
idealism ot western civilization
leems able to deal with. In 1940
and before, we and our English
cousins were concerned with
managing the world; now we
are concerned both with under-
standing it and trying to keep
it right side up, and the double
task is confounded by the prob-
lem of defining w at “right
side up” means. For you stu-

Now we appear only to invoke

of man, the human condition
since Pandora opened the hon

Archangel Michael. The prob-
lem is to face it, and there are
several choices about how. rang-

ment, the two elements of re-
sponse that detine the way we
let life atteot us. By detach-
ment 1 mean the philosophic
attribute, the ability to step
aside and watch the world go
by, with quiet terror or with
wry comment or with pi~o5onnd
scorn. By involvement I mean
commitment, what might be
called an emotional and inlel»
lcctual stake in what is going
on, in what happens or in
what should happen it you

It is a legitimate response. BuI
so too is the commitment to
what is going on, the instinct to
rise and Cheer. or to sink down
and groan audibly. it too is a
natural response, My real point
is that the healthy human per-
sonality needs to be able to
run along the line between

to nihilism and total self-con-

us can, ﬁnally. but we can learn
to do better at it then we are,

Providing an environment in
which "we can learn to he bet-
ter at it than we are" is the
reason for the existence oi this
College, as it has been the rea.
son for over a hundred years.
As is true of most things in this
world, the environment is im-
perfect, partial, neither ideally
free nor ideally ordered. It does
not radiate with the sunshine
of Californa or swing with the
urban sophistications of the
East or see with the multiple
and nicely disordered energies
of the great graduate centers,
It has been criticized variously
as corn-fed, isolated. too re
striotive, too small, too limited,
too bookish,,precious and old
tashioned. For those looking
merely for a place to he com.

splendid adolescence [he blue-
bird ot happiness. This College
may indeed be any or all of
these things, But as Proiessor
Wall said in his remarks to you
earlier, this College is essential.
1y not a thing or place but an
idea. This idea, which has bolh
an intellectual and an emotion-
al context, is that learning is
both an obligation and a joy,
both liberating and demanding,
at once a happy brotherhood
