The Nature Of A Liberal Education: Part 3 Bmhﬁan Romeo‘ Didacﬁc
The Principles of Definition Are Discussed Lover. Poliﬁcizes Viewers

By Professor ll. G. Apostle

In framing a definition, one
may proceed (a) inductively or
(b) analytically; and each of
these methods has its advantages
and disadvantages. For example,
in drafting a constitution for a
nation inductively, one may
study the past and existing
constitutions, compare them and
contrast them, and then choose
what appears to be the best of
all, or else choose the best
elements in them and form What
might appear to be the best
synthesis of those elements.
History tends to teach us in-
ductively what is probable, but
otten it does not reveal all the
alternatives. Analysis, on the
other hand, tends to exhaust the
alternatives or possibilities, but
withouthistory and experience it
may not point to what is
probable. Older men tend to Cling
to what has been probable;
younger men, especially when
existing institutions fall far short
of die ideal, tend to direct their
imagination to simple alter-
natives and possibilities which on
the surface seem to be the true
solutions to problems. So a
combination of both methods
appears desirable. First, we shall
proceed inductively.

An examination of the
requirements and goals of a
liberal education as given by
Amherst, Carleton, Oberlin,
Williams, and Grinnell Colleges
reveals items which appear to
come under five general
headings:

1. Intellectual competence,
excellence of intellectual
training, breadth of un
derstanding, academic ex~
cellence, search for truth,
development of qualities of mind,
intellectual adventure, etc., all
come under ”development of
intellect."

2. Personal and social
responsi 'lity, moral integrity,
qualities 0! character, social
justice, service to others, etc., all
come under “development oi
eharacler.”

3. A third aim, suggested only
by Grinnell in the phrase ”to
achieve a personally satisfying
and worthwhile life” but required
by all, may be said to come in
some way under “appreciation of
arts."

4. Knowledge of some field in
depth, preparation for a useful
career, etc., may be considered
as coming under “a career."

5, Physical education (though
not explicitly stated, required by
all the above colleges) is for the
sake of health, and we may
consider this under “health.”

is this set of goals arbitrary?
Perhaps there is a prior question:
What is the ultimate purpose of
a liberal education',l If this be
happiness, and if happiness is
what is desired most, then we
still have to inquire what is likely
to make us most happy, Whether
we call this allrinclusive aim
“happiness” or “a most en-
joyable life" or “a worthwhile
life” or “a life with positive
response” makes no difference,
for names do not change the
nature of our desires or of their
fulfillment; so we may as well
use the term “happiness," for
this has been used most
universally.

Next, we may proceed
analytically. rirst, man is a
complex being, and as such he
is capable of many kinds of
pleasures.

Second, he cannot go on
throughout life with only one kind
of pleasure, for he has more than
one kind of need. For example,
he cannot eat all one time, or
drink all the time, or play
baseball all the time, or do
nothing but research work all the
time; the returns [If one kind of
pleasure are diminishing, and the
pressure for another kind of
pleasure by its corresponding
need necessitates a change in
activity, This being are case, the
greater the number oi things he
can take pleasure in, the more
likely he is to make a better
choice and so assure himself of
a continuous life of pleasure.

Third, the variety of needs and
their corresponding pleasures
call for a certain kind of choice
and hence of an ordering among‘
them. One often has to choose
one kind oi pleasure and let
another go; and if he is to get
“the most out of life," he must
think not only of today, but of
tomorrow and the year ahead,
or still better, of the whole span
of his existence, and so he must
reﬂect, make plans, use prin-
ciples of evaluation, and,
ultimately, impose a proper
ordering among the kinds of

Fourth, the various kinds of
pleasures are not ready made to
be chosen at will; there are
pleasures, but there are also
pains, and certain pleasures
reinforce or are in harmony with
other pleasures, while certain
other pleasures also cause pains
and bar other desired pleasures.
You may take pleasure in being
rude to people; but you deprive
yourself of other ‘social
pleasures, such as that of
iriendship, and you cannot expect
people to be ready to help you
when you need them. A hare
monious set or pleasures
resulting in no pain may be
likened to a scientific system in
which all the propositions are
true. The analogy may be stated
in the form oi a proportion,
namely, pleasure:pain::truth:
talsity. ln the scientific system,
the principles are axioms, and
what follows from these are the
theorems; and if the axioms are
true, the theorems will
be true also, and the
whole system will be free
from contradiction. Similarly in
a man, his principles are his
habits, and what follows from
these are his actions which
correspond to those habits; and
if those habits are right or

In keeping with the Brechtian
tradition of instructive theater,
the Drama Department’s par
ticipation in the Weimar Symr
posium was both informative and
entertaining. The various short
readings were overshadowed by
the three complete scenes from
Romeo and Juliet and The
Caucasian Chalk Circle. The
scenes were not offered as
polished, finished products, but
as demonstrations of Brechtian
theater and as points of depar-
ture for discussion. Even so, they
were very well received by full
houses ior two nights.

The two versions of Romeo and
Juliet showed how Brecht in-
troduced an element of comic but
severe didacticism into the
usually straight, romantic in-
terpretation of the balcony scene.
This is a typical example of how
Brecht used drama, not to invoke
pity and tears, not to display

movement was a finale cons

brasses and the piano joined
forces. The soloistic nature of this
piece provided ample op-
portunity for each musician to
exhibit his technical and musical
skills.

melodramatic overacting, but to

Over the fact that conditions
analogous to those presented on
stage exist in real life.

The scene from The Caucasian
Chalk Circle demonstrated
Brecht‘s theory of theater as a
selective description or dramatic
retelling of an accident, without
any pretension at convincing the
audience of the reality of the
illusion on the stage, either by
naturalistic dialogue, setting, or
lighting,

The discussion following the
scenes further Clarified Brecht’s
theories about drama, and
gave additional historical
background about the man, his
plays and his time. I would en-
courage more programs similar
to this, not only for their benefit
to the actors, but alsoito all who
would like to sample one par-
ticular author, his plays, and die,

”Sonatine" by Eugene Eozzia,
was perhaps the most technically
demanding of the periormance.
The faster movements were
lively and rhytlunic and were
contrasted by the largo and
adagio sections. In this com-
position as in the others, I found
little to criticize. In brief, the
level ot performance was very
high and ‘nothing but the most
laudable terms could be used to
describe the New York Brass
Quintet.
