in this decision-making process.
Part oi the students‘ success
here will be due to their ilex-
lbility, ie., their ability to give
and lake in discussions about
certain subjects, To have stu-
dent leaders and the student
body immediately c o m m i t
themselves on this principle
quite probably would hamper
them in the cmcial period
ahead. If student leaders were
to agree with me, they might
lose student support It student
leaders were to disagree with
me, faculty and administrative
aupport might diminish, i am
unwilling to rislr these possibii~
lties.

i also tool that student honesty
and responsibility must be dis-
cussed in the context oi the
entire lite beret Were my p0<
silion to challenge the students
to respond to these important
questions during the next iew
days, the debates and discus-
alone probably would include
these questions relative to open
dorms and not relative to all
the factors that should be in«
volved. i hope that, when the
Committee on Student Attairs
announces its proposals within
the next couple of months, con-
atructive discussions about hon-
sexy and responsibility can oc-
our and will not exclude any
relevant topics Unfortunately,
i fear that such discussions are
nearly impossible at this point
in the process of change,

For these two reasons — ——
my desires to grant as much
ﬂexibility as possible to student
leaders and to have discussions
which are positive and which
consider topics not as isolated
iactnrs but as parts of a whole
— I am unwilling to press ior
immediate student action on a
principle which i believe Is so
vital to the Grinnell community
or to nearly any community.

The third solution to the con-
ilict betlween responsibilities
and problems was to resign. I
shall not attempt to rationalize
this kind of a decision I iully
realize that my resignation does
not solve the problems I recog-
nize that i only help to mini~
mize and to avoid temporarily
the conﬂict by selecting this
third alternative Yet, i can not
compromise without compromis—
ing part oi myselit Nor do I
discern the probable results oi
an immediate iight as beneﬁcial
to what may emerge before
Ric, Leida, and Phil leave oi-
iice. Resignation seems to be
the only alternative leit. I,
thereiore, — with reluctance —

announce my resignation as C
of HP President, effective as
of [Olllgllir

Beiore i leave, however, 1
should like to present htieily a
iew personal comments and ob-
servations about student gov~
ernment and the student body
at Grinnell.

As I told you, my resigna-
tion merely postpones the dis»
cussion and quite probably the
fight about student responsibil»
ity, Whatever be the suggested
changes ior the residential sys
tem, the question about respon-
sibility and honesty in regard
to community rules will have
to be answered, We avoid It
now but all oi as will con-
iront it during the next
few months. To paraphrase
John F. Kennedy, not only do
the problems of courage and
conscience concern every oiiice—
holder at Grinneli College, how-
ever humble or mighty, and to
whomever be may be responsi-
ble —- voters, a council, is
board, or a political machine.
They concern as well every per-
son in our community — and
they concern those who do not
vote, those who take no inter-
est in government, those who
have only disdain ior the stu-
dent leaders and their jobs.
For, at Grinnell, every person,
regardless oi his interest in
politics, “holds oiiice"; every
one at us is in a position oi
responsibility; and, in the ﬁnal
analysis, the kind of college
99mmunity we get depends up-
on how we iuliiii those respon-
sibilities.

By this i do not mean that
more student politicians are
needed. Since my election, 1
have argued that one major
weakness in student govern»
ment is the abundance oi stu-
dent politicians. those people
who are eager to assume power
and to create pressure for per-
sonal gains or ego satisfaction.
Student government and tho
student body desparately need
more dedicated thlnket's such
as nio, beida, and Phll —
people who act only after cw
iul objective consideration at
all relevant iacts.

My only direct suggestion to
the Senate and members oi the
C oi HP concerns the way in
which many oi you interpret
your roles primarily as retleo
tors oi student opinion. 1 be-
lieve you were elected because
students hava conﬁdence in
your ability to exercise your
judgment to determine what are
their own best interests. (JFK)
To do this you sometimes must
lead, other times must inform,
and occasionally must ignore

student opinion. The student
body, or course, is the ultimate
judge. But you, through dedi-
cation, honesty, tllougbtiulness,
and responsibility, mtlst be wiil<
ing to inﬂuence and direct that
iinal judge.

Finally, I want to assure you
that my services and my philos-
Dphies will be available Ito any
oi you, especially to members
of the Executive Cabinet, To
tell you that l resign without
disappointment would be a he.
i regret that i have to leave
student government this way.
I, however, do not resign from
student participation or student
actions. Each oi us ultimately
has responsibility which he can
not deny. Each of its will have
on solve the conﬂict which i
avoid now.
