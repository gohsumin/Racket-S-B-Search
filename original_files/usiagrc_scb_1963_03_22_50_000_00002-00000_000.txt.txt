The Committee for Conformity of Clothing, Ctilllitel‘b
I‘llCE, and Personality announced today that a mass meet
ing‘ and ritual will be held on central campus March 33. at
12 pm. All students will be required to attend. Dress

l he the standard white ankle length capes and matching
l‘vointed head 'masks, Participants should also bring a 4 foot
wooden torch, a can of kerosene and a supply of matches.

According to the central CCCP committee and its thir-
r)en subcommittees, a veritable mountain of evidence has
i‘ceii collected which gives Conclusive pi'ool’ of a growing
lumber of clandestine and subversive trends on campus.
:ome oi' the security threatening tendencies listed by the
CCCP committee iil their “Blue Book" are, ”incl'e mg in
'iir, bllttonless collars, blue ieans. lack of
makeup, and bolll'fantl heads."

Tile CCCP plans to take quick and de ' ' e ac ’on to

Another group presently dealing with all equally cru-
cial campus issue is the Drinking Rule for Immature Pupils
committee. Tile DRIP committee has prepared a list of
three carel‘ully studied and formulated alternatives to the
present drinking rule which will be presented to the stu-
cents for a vote. The results of the referendum will detelu
mine which of the three proposals shall be presented to
the administration as a comprehensive rule change arrived
at and supported by a responsible student body.

The DillP committee's proposed alternatives are as
follows:

1) Students will be allowed to drink anything.

There is one announcement of minor importance from
the National Student Association. According to l SA o|'-
ficials, the Gi'iimell College Student Senate will conduct a
student referendum ill the residence halls Monday, March
25, on some inalic resolution concerning the repeal or re-
consideration oi' the Internal Securitv Act 01 1950. This is
one of those inconsequential Acts which “\" liltcs freedom
01' speech alld freedom of the press' restricts free and
open discussion of public issues; legalizes guilt by associze
Lion and pairilellisln; and gives the g‘OVel'luilellt vast pow,
ers to control and influence the advocacy of ideas.”

We know from past experience that progressive Grill-
nelliuns will give the First two org‘ ni ations their sponA
taneous and enthusiastic support. In view of tlli anything-
that we might say, other than to make students aware of
the activities of these organizations, would be unnecessary.
However, we would like to suggest, it" you have a few illo-
ments to spare next Monday, that you cast a vote for the
unconditional repeal of the infamous Internal Security Act
or 1950.
