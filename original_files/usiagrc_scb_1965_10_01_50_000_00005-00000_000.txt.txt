imately ago campus phones. The
dormitory phones are blocked out
at night, onerhalt hour atter
loggia closing time. Mrs. Osmond
said that phones belnnging to hall
presidents, house mothers or spe-
cial students remain open 24 hours
a day. There are over 25 students
on campus with phones because
of DIfiCES held in the Courts, Stu-
dent government, publications, or
SAGA.

Students enjoy their job on the
switchboard. “One kind of fun
thing is that you find out who
gets Called a lot," Miss Samuels
said.

“This is one job where you just
wait tor things to happen. You can
study.” Miss Dority said, adding:
"The switchboard is one of the
few places that has air-condition
mg.”

Name Games

Names can cause some funny
situations, Miss Dority went on to
say. “After you’ve been working
here for awhile certain names or
information just become uncone
scious to you. You just give it

istic that when I meet them I'll
say ‘oh, you’re so and su.’ "

Grinnell has a iew pairs of stu-
dents with the same name—there
are twa Bruce Hamiltons, two
James Wilsons and to Barbara
Kauiman and Barbara Kauiiman,
This usually presents no great
difficulties, Mrs, Osmond said, if
the caller knows the class or resi—
dence hall. She has more difficul-
ties, she said, with her own ‘douh—
les’. Working at the switchboard
this year are two Carolsicarol
Jensen and Carol Kreinick—and
two Judys—Judi Samuels and
Judy Wallace.
