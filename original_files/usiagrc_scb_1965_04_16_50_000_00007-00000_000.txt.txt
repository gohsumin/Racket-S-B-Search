ﬂoere Hour Speaker
Discusses World Bank

Thomas Noone of the World
Bank will speak here Monday,
April 19, at a notice hour in
Younkel' lounge at 4 pm.

The bank, whose formal title

Reconstruction and Develop;
ment, is a unique institution.‘
ll. operates on a strictly “capi-
Lalist" criteria yet enjoys
world-wide respect and appres
clarion.

Sen. 1. William Fulbright
(Dela, Ark.) has recently sug-
gested that all U. S. aid be chan-

it has such a solid record of
achievement and such high
prestige.

lions.

31me ‘ jhe pad},

By Sue Johnson

Although spring is nearly up
on us (‘9), no true Grinnelliani,
can forget the wonder and mys-l
tery of September’s New Stu—
dent Days. Whether he be fresh-
man, senior, or member of the
Class of '33, the following are
ticles from the 5&3'5 of 1929

should bring back nostalgic
memories.

“DORlC—The Column of Purel
Beauty

“Gather ‘round Grandpa Do-
ric, little ones, and get the low
down on how to conduct your.
selves in this here institution.
First of all, brush up on the
smoking of your Murads et Cet-
era, for it you don’t you're
liable to expulsion. One poor
little girl was sent home by
the deans last year because she
failed miserably in her Cigarr
ette test, imagine! She chose
a Camel.

“Another thing. Some stu-
dents prefer to walk while at
Grinnell. Other people just
Walk. We rather think that
some of the college authorities
have relatives in the shoe busie
ness. Be that as it may, if a
college professor offers you a
ride in his Chevrolet, merely
shrug your elbows and give
him the icy stare. He is well
aware of the penalty attached
to motoring at Grinnell. Be-
ware, little ones, of the college
professor, with his shiny car
and his shinler trousers.
“Greeting to the class of 1933!”

dorms it won’t be long until
it's turned into a freshman

“Blanket parties and Grin—

But you will learn more oi

man. She will tell you all,

“Applause in the Chapel en-
courages the speaker and wakes
up the audience. Therelore it
is undesirable.

“To purchase a Webster's
Collegiate Dictlonary, as your
English protessor will doubtless
advise, is to be inexcusably ex-
travagant. Read the 5&3 and
spell accordingly."

Two weeks later the follow
irlg article appeared:

“Our baby preps have grown
up over night! Two short weeks
ago they were timidly endeav-
oring to follow in the footsteps
of their reverend sire, They re»
ligiously stifled yawns and
jerked back nodding heads that
they might succeed in staying
up just a wee minute longer
and keep collegiate hours.

“The first day of school the
Grinnell babies began to grow
up. Many had to be led safely
into the arms of some kind and
soothing kindergarten teacher.
Others independently flourished
their brilliant orange cards and
rushed into Chaucer, advanced
experimental psychology, and
ethics classes before they ven-
tured to inquire from some dis-
tressed mama or papa the way
to English A Section 3.

“But those days are gone for
ever, and slow but sure these
ignorant preps are turning into
typical Grinnell scholars and
flappers. They are acquiring
a nonchalant and sophisticated
air toward their honorable eldr
ers. They casually mention ‘the
hot date at Saturday's Varsity'
and ‘cutllng the 3 o'clock for a
snooze)

“Some hold spirits have even
discovered the hidden charm
of the chilly, muddy Waters of
Arbor Lake. Others proudly dig,

Grinnell’s tennis team was
shut-out at Carleton last week-
end 7-0 only to come back on
Tuesday and even their season
record by beating the Knox
netmen 673.

Carleton, whose team is ex-
ceptionally strong this year,
pulled all the stops last week
end and didn't allow a single
Grinnell win. The match was
played inside the Carleton gym
because the outside courts
were llnplayably wet.

Tuesday aiternoon, the sun
more in evidence, Grinnell en-
tertained Knox here in Grin-
nell and sent the Siwash home
6-3 losers. .

In singles, Larry Shannon,
