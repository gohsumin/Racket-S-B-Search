By Andy Bushnell

Cornell gained undisputed
possession of second place in the
Midwest Conference last Sat-
urday by handing Grinnell its
third defeat of the season, 82‘
65. The loss dropped Grinnell
three full games behind league
leading Ripon which now has
won ten of its eleven confer—
ence games,

Grinnell started off fast tak-
ing a 10~Z lead in the first two
minutes, The Rams closed the
gap to 13-10 and remained on
the Pioneer’s heels most of the
first half. With less than three
minutes remaining in the first
half Cornell tied the game at
33x33 and then Went ahead 37-
3.1.

Both Jim Mifflin and John
Sundell got into foul trouble
early in the game, and it was
left Frantz’s shooting that kept
the Pioneers close behind. Grin-
nell controlled the boards for
as long as Sundell was in the
game.

Grinnell threatened to re-
take the lead early in the sec-
ond half coming within a
point at 47-46. but the Rams
again put on the pressure
and moved out ahead, Sun-
dell, Mifflin, and Clyde Smith
all fouled out late in the
game and Cornell widened
the lead and won going away.

Dal Zierk and Jack Grams
hit for 20 points apiece to pace
tile Rams. John Shillinglaw,
Dick Calbow, and John All-
[laugh added 16.14. and 10
points respectively.

points and Sundell and Mifllin
added eleven apiece. Sundell
also pulled down 19 rebounds.

Grinnell’s varsity basketball
team will try to get back into
the win column this weekend
as they host Carleton and St.
Olaf in Darby Gym.

The Carls, Grinnell’s oppo-
nents tonight, are in the lower
third of the Midwest Confer-
ence standings, but are defin»
itely on the upswing, as shown
by their 9542 trouncirlg of C08
College Kohawks last Weekend.

In their trip to Northfield,
the Pioneers beat the Earls,
96-82, in a game which Coach
Pfitsch termed as “the bést
game we have played this
year." At that time, how-
ever, Grinnell was led by the
performance of Gordon Kine
kead, who has since left
school.

The Carleton team is led by
an all—conference guard Jack
Arado, whose lack of height,
5.9, is otiset by his quickness
and excellent shooting eye, and
Center Mike Tierney, a junior
who was 6th man on last year’s
squad, Few fans who were at
last year’s game between these
teams at Grinnell will forget it.
With third place in the Confer-
ence at stake, the Carls edged
out the Pioneers in a double-
overtime thriller.

St. Olaf, who at the beginning
of the season was expected to
be the weaker of the Northfield
teams, was quite a thorn in the

' side of Cornell and Grinnell

when'the two Iowa teams made
their trip north earlier in the
year.

Both games are key ones for
the Pioneers, whose champion-
ship hopes remain dimly flick-
ering.

Trackmen Open Season
Against Iowa. Purdue

Grinnell's indoor track team
opens its 1964 season tomorrow
against the University at Iowa,
the Big Ten’s defending cham—
pions, and Purdue in a trian-
gular meet at Iowa City,

“We’re probably stepping
in a little over our heads,"
says Dick Young, coach of

Grinnell’s defending Midwest

Conference titlistsr “But'thii

one will be a great experi-

ence for the boys andrshould
help us in the long run.”

Lack of conditioning is
Young's biggest concern noW.
The Pioneer thinclads have
been working out only since
Feb. 1 and have no real indoor
track facilities.

Pacing the Grinnell efforts
will be a handful of juniors who
led the Grinnellians to the top
last year. Seeing plenty of ex-
tra duty will be Bruce Beck<
lord, Rod Brown, Paul Patten
Son. Mack erlholtz, Mike De-
Witt, John TePaske. Ron Scha—
chel and Jeri Langham.

BrOWn and Patterson are the
top distance men, While Wln<
holtz, Beckord, TePaske, Scha<
chel, and Langham specialize in
the sprints and middle distance
events. DeWitt is mainly a
sprinter and hurdler.

in the field, TePaske will be
teaming with Vince Anku and
John Kelsey, in the broad jump.
Jim Miller, a promising sopho-
more and Joel Goldman will
throw the shot, with Walt Neal
going in the pole vault. Tom
Wood and Mike Fox are en-

 

tered in the high jump.
