Baseball Squall S

by Dave Buck

Eight returning lettermen and
several promising sophomores
form ii strong nucleus for Coach
John Pfitsch’s 1961 baseball club.
Last year the Pioneers finished
second in the Southern League
of the Midwat Conference with
a 4—4 record and sported a 5-8
season mark, but coach Pfitsch
looks for improvement this
spring.

“We should be a little better
this year," Pfitsch says. “We have
several promising sophomores
around in addition to a pretty
good pitching staff and a few
good hitters."

The Midwest Conference is di-
vided into a Northern League and
a Southern League, of which
Grinnell is a part, to compensate
for an approximate two week
head start in outdoor practicing
for the four southern teams. In
the Southern League along with
Crinnell are Cornell, Coe, Moh-
mouth and Knox.

Grinnell finished second in
the southern division last spring
behind perennial power Coe,
llul: baseball players are an op~
timistic lot, and there is lots
of talk about Crinnell winning
its first league championship
since baseball was reinstated at
Grinnell in 1957.

With the first game two and a
half weeks away, and since the
squad has been unable to work
outside, lineups are very indefin-
ite. At the present time it.looks
like the infield will have Jim

‘Linksmen To Meel
Knox On April 8

With the first golf meet seliede
uled for April 3 at Knox, l3
golfers have reported to Coach
Larry Crawford. Due to the
weather situation the team has
been hitting balls inside, mov—
ing outside whenever possible.

According to preeseason pre—
dictions, Grinnell ranks among
the top three teams in the Con-
ference, with Carleton, the de-
fending champion, and Knox.
Grinnell was undefeated in Con-
,ference dual meets last year and
finished second in the Confer-
ence meet.

Fonr lettermen will lead the
linksters this year. They are
Steve Brodt, Jon Groteluschen.
Lowell Hockett and Bill Me—
Knight, Rick Fuller, Dave Pal-
mer, Bob Halonen, Jim Soble,
Tony Gray, Chuck Kriel, Steve
Stults, Jerry Cozad and Craig
McManus round out the golf
roster. These members should
push the lettermen in their fight
for berths on the team. with a
possibility of several moving the
lettermen out or their top posi-
tions.

'Lowry at first, either Art Peter-
son or Dale Furnish at second,
Gary Knarniller at short and
Chris Sprung at third.

The outfield should be consi-
derably better than last year’s
threesome with added speed and
hitting power. Returning Out-l
fielders include Dick Mittelbush.
er and Ron Ochsner, but they
will be hard pressed by three
outstanding sophs, slugger Bruce
Bell, and speedsters Howard
Bunton and Jack Freter.

The pitching start will prove
to be the strong point of the

squad with three promising
hurlcis, rack Meyer was last

year‘s leading pitcher with a
+2 record and a line L66 earn-
cd-run average.

Behind Meyer on the mound
will be Mittelbusher and 001157
ner. Roger Miller will probably
see most of the catching duty,
but Chris Sprung could fill in

]behind the plate if needed.

The season opener for Grinnell
will be Tuesday afternoon, April
11. at 3:30 here in Grinncll with
Simpson College. These two
clubs did not meet in 1960.
