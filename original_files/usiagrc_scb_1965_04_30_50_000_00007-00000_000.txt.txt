Jean Pierce.

Asked his impression of the
meeting, Robertson said that
“the overall program was
pretty good. It gave scientists
from different institutions a,
chance to get together and to.
present research findings be-
lore an audience. This is a val-,
uable experience.” i

Durkee believed attendance
might have been lessened byl

He said, “or course, We had’:
to compete with the attractionf

was at its worst while we Were.’
there. But, generally, the pro.
gram was good, although we
had lower attendance than last
year.”

Administration,” The lectures
were delivered by John Sirgo-

To the Editor:

it was really disgusting to turn
to the sports page of the Scarlet is.
Black of April 23, loss. There
were many things to be dismayed
at, hut the prime journalistic
boner was the column, “Scarlet
Fever.” We shall enumerate some
at the iirst class errors iirst, how-
ever.

The headline of the track Ax»
ticle read, “Relay Teams Lead
Trackmaii at Drake.” The article
went on to tell how the Pioneer
track team had been led at the
State College of iowa's Dickinson
Relays hy their relay team. Fi~
nally at the end of the article
there was i half a sentence telling

Drake Relays that weekend, but
this surely could not have been
what the headline had been re-
lcrring to, at least not in the
manner in which it was stated.

As a result of the huge vol-
ume of enthusiasm shown by
the IM jocks. as well as ovher
assorted types on North Cal-inp-
us, during the periodally recur-
rent water fights, the IM

chairmen are working on a'

whole new set of events to re-
place the dull sports now in ef-
fect They tigurc that football,
basketball, baseball, etc, must
not be what the guys are inter-
ested in, and those in charge
are desperately interested in
presenting a program all North
campus can get fired up lor.
At the top of the list is a mud
pie baking contest on Mac
Field. Both the quantity and
quality or mud pies produced
by the various halls will be
judged by officials from South
campus, whose job it will also

offer advice when needed. The
administration is

beyond hope that a sanctioned
mud romp will decrease the de-
sire among those clever in»
dividuals who get a large
charge out of covering windows
and Walls with their mud pie
making etlorts.

If this proves successful, the
other phases of the new pro-

behind this‘
lnew move luo per cent, hoping

gram will soon go into effect.
These include an IM Ring-

S&B Sports Page Is ‘Disgusting'

Mr. Casey went on to make the
statement that the Grinnell team
had no ﬁrst base coach. Thls is a
false statement at least without
qualifications Mike Stoller said
“I coached first hase the first tour
innings of the game of which
Casey makes reference in and also
all 01 the second girlie!” it is pos-
sible that we were without a first
base coach a portion at or even
an entire inning of one of the re-
maining three innings at that
game. This is not that my a ca-
