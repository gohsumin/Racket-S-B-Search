Gyherneiies Forces Values Rethinking l

By Hank Balikov

Man makes his destiny be
cause of and with the tools that
he makes. This was the theme
of Dr. Emmanuel Mesthene
during Cybernation Weekend,
Feb. 2425.

Dr. Mesthene, Executive Di-
rector oi the Harvard Univer-
sity Program on Technology
and Society, said man acts out
his role as maker in a variety
or ways; When he understands
nature; when he improves po—
litical relationships; or when he
appreciates art and knows God.
in technologically active times
(such as the present) institu-
tions cannot hold values or so»
cial mores. In technologically
less active times, activity is
centered on social preoccupa<
thin and readjustment. But a
common reaction to changes
brought by the cybernetic ago
is to hold tight to familiar
meanings or basic tenets. This
at present tends to introduce a
Schism between science and
values.

Man can now be an artist
with technology as his art. He
acts both by knowing and by
altering his environment. when
altering nature he is directly
using tools to make an object
for a purpose according to a
preconceived idea. This prior
conception and material reali-
zation are essential, and are
the basis of art. But it is also
usetul to distinguish between
art and science according to
their purposes. Art looks to the
thing in itselt, the object tor
Its own sake. Science uses the
object as intermediary, from
which the making gives knowl-
edge. In the past it has been
possible to keep these ideas in
separate categories; one would
be the distinction between basic
and applied science. But re-
search science is relatively new
and though it concerns the
basic relationship of artist on

material, the material (his
tool) by its power is forcing a
wedding of technology and Sci-
ence.

Science Affects Culture

Science has had great effects
on culture for the past few
Centuries but it was not under-
taken lor these side-eflects.
Technology too had its cultural
effects in the industrialization
that followed invention. Tech-
nology is now seen as a means
to further Valuable ends.

Once science is pursued for
its goals, it is drawn into the
area or social pupose. Our tools
are so sophisticated that they
have expanded science beyond
the lab so that parts of science
require the world as laboratory.
Science is ﬁnding out what
nature is like and is both chang-
ing to meet it and changing
nature. Because science has
grown so large it must be the
public who has the right to say
what changes can be made in
the world, Knowing nature and
altering nature have become a
single process.

We have learned too much to
aspire to the complicated sys<
temic philosophy oi the 19th
century but we must realize
that the opposite is just as bad.
The tools we now use have
welded together in art the
transformative and the cogni-
tive, New tools require social
reorganization if their potential
is to be realized, Philosophy of

the new technology cannot lag
too far behind else we find our<
selves incapable or making the
changes necessary for our sur-
vival.

The cybernetic age has also
brought a new distinction be
tween the public and the pri-
vate. In just one instance a
large amount oi research, nee
essary icr our progress (and
existence) is now financed by
the government and directed by
government policy.

Increased Government Role

There is an increased de-
mand for those public goods
served by the government. Pri-
vate enterprise has fallen into
on institutional lag (vacuum)
but ls invading some neglected
areas or need. American Gyp.
sum works in urban redevelop-
ment and General Electric in
building new cities.

Our new purposes are an
expression or our new values.
Nothing is seen as impossible.
There is a new commitment to
rationality as a means of social
control. Planning is no longer
seen as bad for a tree society
