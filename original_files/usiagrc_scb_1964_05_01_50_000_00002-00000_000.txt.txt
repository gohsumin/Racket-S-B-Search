‘ Generally, on this campus, speakers come and go.
Too many make too little impact on the student body.
They don’t spend enough time here or the students
'don’t take time to see them or their appearance isn’t
publicized because of lack of funds and initiative or
people just don’t care. In the case of Sunday chapel
speakers in particular, the time is short and often in-
effective. The guest spends one hour before‘students,
and hurries to catch the next flight out of Des Moines.
The students have a name on the calendar and a ser-
mon title on the announcement board in front of Her—
rick. Regular attenders go to chapel as usual, others
attend downtown churches, and too many others stay
in bed. Thus, another Sunday sermon is by the boards.

i This week, however, someone cares, Van Spurgeon,
young dynamic campus minister from Oklahoma State
is coming—not only for Sunday chapel services, but
for a two-day campus visit, Students care. Those who
have met Van are excited about their friends, meeting
and hearing him. They know that there will be con-
troversy about what he says, and they look forward
to the discussion that interested students can bring
about. They have kept in contact with Van during the
past weeks. Telling him that their main interest in the
trip lies in interpersonal relations, they have scheduled
a picnic, a luncheon, a panel, and several informal dis-
cussions where students and guest can meet and feel
at ease. They are eager for everyone to hear the Sun-
day sermon so that they might be prepared to meet Van
on a more personal basis later.

Van, too, cares. He wants to meet the students and
to know them. For several weeks he has been receiving
copies of the S & B so that he can familiarize himself
somewhat with Grinnell and her people. To fashion his
service as one completely for the students that he is
seeking to reach, he has made changes in the regular
run of the chapel program. (Three hymns will be sung
by the congregation instead of two, and more respon-
sive reading.) He will be living in a residence hall in

order to make himself available to students at all times
during his visit.

This is hardly a plea to get everyone to attend
chapel this Sunday or any other. Let it serve more as
a notice that people do care about this speaker and that
the speaker cares about Grinnell. Rather than a one-
stand performance, the visit of Van Spurgeon should
he a worthwhile experience for all students.

It seems remarkable for students to say that they
can’t afford the time to hear speakers on Sunday morn-
ing, and then to spend that time sleeping or haphazard-
ly gazing at a book. Perhaps students should learn how
to make time rather than waste it. This weekend you
can afford the time to care.

Letters to the Editor

Roellinger Questions Apportionmnl 0f Concerl Funds ‘

To the Editor:

As a student observing the
aesthetic and cultural aspects
of Grinnell College I would like
to inquire about the reasoning
behind the social and cultural
planning on this campus. Why
is it that Louis Armstrong and
Count Basie play for our formal
dances, While for our (sadly)
one jazz Concert we were
treated to Lambert-Hendricks-
Bavan, and have not seen one
recognized symphony arches»
tra?

It may be some sort of trae
dition to have large namer

bands play for our dances, but
would not the music provided
by a local band more than suf«
(ice, and cost only a fraction
of the amount spent for name-
bands?

What I am suggesting is that
it seems out of proportion to fl»
nance the very best for our
dances, while generally speak-
ing we have m settle'for second
best in the concert ﬁeld, which
should hold priority over
dances in a school such as
Grinnell is supposed to be.

The difference in cost be-
tween the two mentioned types

Miscellany and Digression

By Tom Fullmer

The step taken by the college
last Week to join the city in
switching to “fast” or “day-
light savings” time must be
viewed with mixed emotions.
It is heartwarming to have
proof that some college offir
Cials are aware that there is a
world outside of, the college.

Nevertheless, it is readily ap-
parent that this recent decis~
ion by the college was made in
a highly hasty manner without
proper consideration of the
implications inherent in the
switching of time.

First of all, there is the pure-
ly practical consideration oi the
changing of the clocks. Theo-
retically, before the switch
Grinnell was (in Central stand
ard time. About the! only thing
standard about time at Grill-
hell was that at any given in-
stunt no two Grinnell College
clocks showed the same time.
One library clock was on day-
light saving time three weeks
ago.

When one told somebody the
time he had to be sure to spec»
ify which Clock he was using as
a basis. The United States has
{our time zones. Grinnell has
Well over 30.

But the problem of synchror
nizing the clocks pales to in-
significance when compared to

 

other problems created by the
switch which may well have
profound effects on the sociol-
ogical lives of the Grmnell stu-
dents. .

For example, those couples
who have been dating regularly
are upset because there will be
an hour less of darkness be-
fore women’s hours. They
would have preferred a swuch
to “daylight wasting" or ‘slow”
time.

But perhaps the most signifi-
cant influence the change Will
have will be in the area of
study habits. And here the ei—
fect could be disastrous. For I
venture to say that the normal
student Will tend to use the ex—
tra hour of sunlight lor pur-
poses of recreation rather than
study. As a result, the quality
of Work will decrease and the
reputation of the college Will-
suffer. i

It is still not too late for the
college to reverse its decision.
Some clocks are probably still
operating on standard time.
Some students are. Taverns
and railroad stations operate
on standard time. So should
Grinnell College. Leave us not
be deceived by the specious
something for nothing reason
ing that contends that by using
“last" time we can save day—
light. Humbug!

Miles Davis, Sonny Rollin, or

significant step in raising the
