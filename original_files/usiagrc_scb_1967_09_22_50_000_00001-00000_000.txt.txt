Eric Thor, Cle iacto chairman
at the Tuesday meeting, pre-
faced his remarks with, “We
want to avoid a leader psychola
ogy, so we have the least dy-
namic beioi‘e us!”

“Instead, we need a unit
psychology," he stressed, ex»
piaining that a strong GSM will
enable its members to exert ef—
fective pressure for changes at
Grinnell.

Thor expressed hope that stu<
dent power will not become
an end in itself, Rather,
sees the GSM as those Stu-
dents willing to be in the van-
guard of campus change.

The movement’s primary con-
cern now is the open rooms
question. Ron Steinhorn, head
of GSM's Opens Committee,
said, “We are trying to work
through ofﬁcial channels now"
to show the campus that noth-
ing will be accomplished this
way,

The GSM will put a proposal
calling for open dorms exten»
Slims before the Senate next
week and generally, added
Steinhorn, “keep the issue be-
me the campus,”

he,

Mike P e n z n e r elaboratedll
"The student leaders still think
we can reason with the deans.
Most of the student body won't
act until they’re sure the deans'
answer is ‘no.’

“As soon as we get an ex-
plicit refusal from the deans,
we have a rally point and can
have a revolution."

The Paper, GSM's under-
ground newspaper, edited by
Richard Schileirov, will serve
as the voice of the movement.

”We don’t intend to compete
with the 5&3," said Scllneirov.
“The 5&3 cannot provide ade-
quate space (to air GSM’s
views)," he explained.

Hopefully, said Schneirnv, the
paper will come out weekly in
mimeographed form. He in-
tends to print articles from
similar journals, news of stu-
dent revolutions a c r o s s the
country, and numerous ieatures.

“We don't have to be con-
cerned with just college is
sues," he explained. “The 5ch
has a responsibility to the cam-
pus. We don’t."

“There is a sudden burgeon-
ing of underground newspapers,"
Scllneirov continued. “They’re
not connected in any way with
what people call ‘The Estab~
iishment'.

“Most of them barely turn
I: profit, as the readership is
limited. The content is often
extremely radical."

Anyone wishing to play
anything on any musical in-
strument (or on anything
else) is welcome at Ex Loco
Parentis tonight until 2 3.1“.

EXPECTED SUNDAY .

Sue Dastal, Larry Frank, and
Russ Heuckendorf have been
selected as the first student
members of the Judicial
Council. The appointments
are expected to be confirmed
by the Senate Sunday night,

By ANNE TAYLOR

The Judicial Council of Grin-
nell's Student Government As-
sociation will be an innovation
in student selfrgovernment,

The council will consist of
three appointed students and
three faculty members chosen
by President Leggett upon the
recommendation of Mr. Wall,
the Chairman of the Faculty.

The Judical Council will have
original jurisdiction in all cases
in which violations of college
regulations are alleged to have
occurred except those in which
the house councils have origin-
al jurisdiction.

At its discretion, it may have
appellate jurisdiction over cases
handled by a House Council or
may refer any cases back to a
House Council if it is felt that
the House Council should have
original jurisdiction.

The council will have the
power to recommend any ap-
propriate measure, however, its
decision is subject to the stu-
dents right of appeal to the
President of the College.

The three student members of
the council, Sue Dostai, Larry
Frank, and Russ Heuckendori,
were selected by a committee
composed at eight honse presi<
dents and Ric MacDowell.
Eighteen candidates were inter<
viewed on Monday and Tues<
day nights, and the final selec-
tion was made Wednesday.

Frank and Heuckendurf will
serve until December, and Dos-

tal will serve until May. An.“
nouncement of the three faculty,
members of the council is also
expected Sunday. '

The faculty members of thl
Judicial Council will also in,
announced at that time and will
serve one year terms.

The most important innova.
lion within the Judicial Council
Will be its prerogative to mid.
ate investigations of student a
fairs. The council will be abid
to investigate the underlyin
causes of the violations of th
college's policies and regulaa
lions and to make resolutionl
affecting student behavior,

In previous years the function
of the council was executed byl
a High Court and n separatd
Men's and Women‘s Primary,
Courts.

The members of last year]
courts would be the first
admit that their judical aystza
lacked adequate means to m >
the needs of Grinneil‘l student
body.

The primary courts found
themselves wasting time dictat-
ing regulations and inflicting
punishments for disciplinary
problems. Most of the courts
decisions were merely cniorcmg
standing regulations, regula<
tions which, more often than
not, Could have and should have
been dealt with through housa
councils.

The courts had no integrity.
Simply, any of their decisions
could have been (and some
were) revised by the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs
by request of the deans.

The inefficiency of the com-
plex court system was exemp ,
filed by the fact that the Higii
Court was not used once last
year.

 

IOWA EDITOR TAKES SWIPES
AT PROFS AND POLITICS

By NEIL FISCHER

Billed as a speech on possible
Republican candidates for the
next presidential election, a
Thursday night Political Dis-
cussion Group (PDG) dinner in
the private dining rooms of the
Forum lapsed into a verbal joust
between Burlington (Iowa)
Hawkeyo Editor John McCor-
mally and Professor C. Edwin
Gilmour (political science).

The bantering centered around
civil rights, the Vietnam war,
and the Republican alternative
of Ronald Reagan.

Though a “not for the record"
atmosphere pervaded most of
the evening, McCormally's quot-
able statements summarized his
overall viewn

“It's a hell of a lot more im-
portant to save America than

it is to save Vietnam . . . We
can renego on our commitment
there if there is a need at
home."

Just as a man can renego on
a Red Cross pledge il hs needq
the money more to mend a dist
aster in his home, the Iowa edi-
tor expiained, we can renege in
South East Asia if we’re in
trouble."

“Is that it reasonable politi-
cal alternative?" asked Gil-
mour.

“It is politically feasible it
you have the guts," McCormai.
1y answered, ”But it may bl
a matter of time."

“ I never argue with you,Ill
Gilmour retorted, “1 agree with'
