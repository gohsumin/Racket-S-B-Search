Bill Herman Goes Ethnic, Tours Africa in a Jeep

_ The Arabintiuence is everywhere and it seems
like stepping into the pages of the past. In our two
days we see the full array of palaces, forts, clove
farms and relics. One spacious palace housed the 49
wives of the Sultan, but i guess those days are gone
forever. Then it was back to the mainland on anr
othei all night dhow ride with the same stiff back
resu s.

Christmas catches us here in Dar and to celebrate
we book in at a local Beach Club. After several
parties and all the trimmings, we sack out on the
beach. Strangely enough, no snow falls. but the rain
comes in its place. For lovers oi a “White Christmas"
I wouldn’t recommend this location.

Next we head north toward the “Snows of Kiln
minjaro.” Road conditions are not the best and at one
spot we come across a mud hole about a mile long.
It is most amusing to watch the numerous vehicles
come ﬂying in from both ends only to slowly grind
to a halt and settle into the sticky goo. The Gray
Gern. equipped with useful four wheel drive, plows
through in proud form, Being gentlemen in the true
Grinnell sense of the word, we offer our services in
removing many of our not-seclucky fellow travelers.

Kilimanjaro itself is located in the rich and well
developed northern section of Tanganyika. The moun-
.tain is quite remarkable because. being a volcano, it
sticks up out of a relatively ﬂat land to a height of
over 19,000 feet: Even though located only a few de-
grees south of the equator, the top is covered with
snow and ice. Unlike most mountains there are no
rocky proiections so that one can actually hike. not

ney and after all, the air does get a bit thin up here.
The view is quite spectacular so we are happy we
came as far as we did. Down hill she goes like a
charm and once more we point our noses north and
push on to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.

In the midst of the wealth and development of
this area live a people who seem to have escaped the
forces of civilization, They are called the Masai, and
although very popular with the tourists. they com-
prise a leach on society. This is the true wild African

dyed hair and masses of beads. Standing on a hill
silhouetted against the sky he is an unforgcttahle
sight but as the last vestige of old tribalisln he must
eventually fade into the dawning of a new Africa.

Nairobi, new, booming and very impressive; the
symbol of the white man in East Africa. The symbol
will remain but the white mcn may not so one can
only hope that it will now become the center of a
new multracial society. rounded only 60 years ago,
this city is more modern than anyplace in the States.
Even has a drive—in theatre as we well know for we
camped behind it and watchcd the show from our
beds in the Gray Gern. Of course we had in all the
sights of the city as well as the surrounding area. To
the north lies another section of the Great itirt Val»
lay with tremendous scenery and wild game.

Time and moncy now demand that we head south
for home. As we moved back into Tanganyika we
passed through some of the best wild game country
in Africa and needless to say we took advantage of
the opportunity. It is just like the movies to drive

there are numerous other smaller game. Coming
around a corner we nearly collide with a giraffe
that then proceeded to race down the road ahcad of
us about 25 miles per hour. We now have many pice
tures to prove our talc.

After live days of ups and downs we again reach
the Nyasaland border but here our luck is to fail.
Three miles from the customs there is a sharp crack
and gears arc out of operation. Luckily for us we
get a tow hack to the customs wherc we are destined
to spend the next four days, Never having taken
the car repair course at Grinnell, we find ourselves in
a bit of a fix. Finally managing to remove the gear
box and find the problem, a broken gear shaft, We
make an 80 mile trip to the nearcst town and after
many greasy hours the Gray Gcrn is ready to roll
once again. A rather interesting assortment of people
manage to get stuck at the border for a variety of
reasons so that by the time we left the collection
numbers nine; three English. two South Alricans, one
German, one israeli, and two Americans. This makes
for some interesting nights in the bar.

Back through Nyasalaiid we drive like the devil
himself and alter 400!) miles and 30 days we arrive
in one piece. except of course the Grey Gerri who is
now missing a few parts. After a bath, first in 10
days, we once again feel like humans.

In SlmplE retrospect, I can truthfully Say that
Safari East Africa was a most interesting and stimr
ulating experience and I can only look forward to
many more. While fulfilling the service function as
a teacher in Malosa, it is travels like this that Com-
plete my roles as a Travel Service Scholar.

“For a college the size of
Grinnell to have an IBM setup
is most unusual; and even more
‘unusual is the fact that it is
available to students and faculty
,for use in independent projects,”
said Dale Terry, registrar and
administrative supervisor of the‘
IBM data processing service.

Gi'innell‘s IBM equipment con-
sists of a key punch, which punr
ches coded information on the
cards, a sorter which can sepa-
rate 450 cards per minute, and
a #402 accounting machine.
which will print out so lines per)
minute. ,

“The 402 works by means oil
brushes,” said c. r. Pugh, sue
pervisor oi the IBM service, who
manages the technical end. “The
cards, punched in code, are sent
through the 402 and the holesl
in the cards allow the brushes
to complete a speciﬁc circuit to
a type bar. There are 43 type'
bars, each bearing an alphabet
and numerals, The circuits send
,the type bars up to print a line
lof decoded information."

The machines are housed in‘
Carnegie in an airrconditioned»
dehumidiﬁed room,

“We put in a dehumidiﬁer
to prevent dampness of summer
‘from warping the cards. and we
are putting in a humidiﬁer to

combat dryness in winter which
shrinks the cards," commented
Terry.

For each student there are
from in to 15 cards hearing
such information as high school
size, College Board scores, fa-
ther’s occupation, classes tak-
en, and advisers name. There

rare approximately 37,000 of

these cards now on ﬁle.

The machines save hours of
routine listing and notational
Work. Before IBM installation,
it took a secretary all summer
to get grades posted on perma—
nent records. Now it will take
about one half a day.

The machine also aids advisers
by cutting down the number of
forms issued on each student as
well as by making information
more readily available to them.
Because each bit of information
must be coded, obvious errors in
dates and other information are
caught and corrected so that the
information is more reliable.
Registration, grade reports and
the issuing of class lists are
speeded up immeasurably. With-
out IBM the class lists went out
about two weeks after classes
had begun. Now the professors
have the lists on the opening
day of class.

Terry stated emphatically,
"When people think of machr
ines, they think of imperson—
ality. However, the IBM mix—
chines actually aiiow for more
individual attention Since a
great many more facts on a
person may he marshalled now
with much more case. It is

true that everyone is a num—
ber, but a great deal more a
known about this number, and
this ready iniormation frees us
to learn more about the name
and face behind the number. I
would say that there has been
more personal attention since
we got the machines than
before,"

He continued, “We have ab-
solutely no intention of chang—
ing college functions to ﬁt the
workings of the machines. if a
function lends itself to the use
of the IBM equipment _ ﬁne,
we’re happy to do it by ma-
lchine; but there are some areas
'in which machines are useless.
We try to maintain ﬂexibility
even in machine programs so
that we don’t start thinking, ‘we
can’t do it this way because it
won’t ﬁt into neat little columns
for the machines"

Although many areas of col—
,lege work such as the ﬁle of
the Alumni and Development of-
ﬁces, the inventories of the phy-
sical plant, information onrpros-
pectives from the Admissions
otiice, and surveys of which
courses students take which se-
mester might utilize the ma-
chines, no formal plans have
been laid.

Faculty projects have been
started using the equipment.
These range from work on
the Jasper County Project of
the political science depart-
ment to the tabulation of so-
cial events and their popular-
ity with students by the Ac-
tivities Counselor.

Parts of independent projects
lby students have also been done
on the machine. To do an inde-

ines, the student checks with
the head of the department in
which he is doing his independ-

Terry concluded, “Despite the

program of student and iaculty
