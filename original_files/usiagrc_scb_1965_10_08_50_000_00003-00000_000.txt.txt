Herman Describes Experiences

Antioch College and University
of California at Berkeley are the
former locations of Eugene l-ler—
man, who now joins Grinnell's
math department.

Herman, with his 13.5. irom Un-
lverstty [if Chicago and his MA.
and PhD. from U.Cr at Berkeley,
spent the summerquatter, 1934,
at Antioch and last year at Bar
keley.

“I did specifically look (or a
small school,” Herman said “I
enjoyed the excitement oi the en
vents (at Berkeley) but the things
which tltey implied about the uni-
versity were not so good.

“They (the events) signihed a

large, impersonal university where
students don't see their prufes
sors; and students and professors
irom ditierent departments don't
have much to say to each other.”
At Grinnell, Herman pointed out
“people get used to seeing their
protessots around. They know they
can see them; whereas Berkeley
is large and most or the professors
discourage student visits. The stu~
dents recognize this and get into
the habit of not seeing them.”
Antioch represents a totally dit»
(erent climate, Herman said.
“Here, when students come in (to
a protessor's otiice) they want to
talk about the subject matter, At

“The way Antioch is Structured,
the school encourages the student
to be involved in more than just
academic activities," he com—
mented. The question seemed to
him to be: “Should a school offer
a student a great number of non-
academic activities and encourage
his participation, or should a
school offer a student an academ-
ic liberal arts education and let
the student seek out for himseli
nonacademic activities if he
wishes?“

Like makeup, costumes ongi
hated in prehistoric times. The
priests dressed in skins and shells,
daubed their faces and bodies With
colored clay and berry juice. The
disguises acted both as vivid rep-
resentations of the gods and as
a protection lor the priests a-
gainst the wrath of the gods, The
Egyptians formalized these cere~
monies into set dramatic rituals
whose traditions the Greeks inher-
ited. when the dramas became
more secular, tho disguises were
carried right along. it was Aeschy—
lus who ﬁrst made the costumes
more individual. The masks were
enlarged and the actor's height
and shape were changed by the
costumes. When Romans took over
the Greek theatre, the only change
they made was to standardize
color as symbolic oi character.

The theatre of the Middle Ages
saw the return oi the religious
drama. Costumes became grotes-
que and visually symbolic. The
devil was clothed in Skins with a
Virgin’s face on a horned animal's
head, Adam and Eve dressed in
white leather to look like skin, and
in animal skins. Less stock char-
acters dressed in the cast—oil
clothes oi the day. The Eliza-
bethans dropped the religious char-
acter of drama. Costumes were
the cast-OHS of the rich and often
complete with jewels. Special
costumes were apportioned for
Oriental or Eastern characters,
Roman and Greek characters, and
characters outside those of the
stock comedy-tragedy iheatricals.

It has been brought to our
attention recently that white
iifesavers — peppermint, spear
mint -— give of! light when
broken. The light is quite faint
but distinctly discernible in a
dark room. One oi the more
advanced methods of observing
this phenomenon is to chew one
in front of a mirror in a dark
[00ml

 

The 18th century saw most actors
still in the dress or the day. It
was in the early 19th century when
costumers finally began to pay
any attention to historical occur-
acy,

Today, the iirst point to be con-
sidered in costuming is the period
oi the play. But this design must
be modiﬁed to fit the character,
his relation to others, the tone oi
the play itseli, and the practical
construction. The costume must be
integrated with other costumes
and the set in color and design.

Helen Klein is costume mistress
this year. She has been sewmg
{or herself for many years. For
our productions, she ieels mood
and color are almost more im-
portant than historical accuracy.
“I draw my own designs aitcr
reading the play and watching re-
hearsals. The actual sewing is not
as hard as the ﬁtting and refitting
necessary to make the costumes
work." Helen does the costumes
for the major productions, assists
un workshops. and is presently rc~
organizing the costume depart-
ment.

Although Helen is a sociology-
anthropology major, she is very
active in theatre, which she en-
joys immenselyr She welcomes.
