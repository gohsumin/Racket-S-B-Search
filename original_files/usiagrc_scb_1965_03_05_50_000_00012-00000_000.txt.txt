Frantz Will Break School Record

As Hoopsters Close Home Season

Jeff Frantz is almost certain to
let a new Grinnell College season
scoring record when the Pioneer
basketball team closes its home
campaign with three games in
five days.

Coach John Pfitsch‘s crew will
host Monmouth at 7:30 pm. to-
night, Knox at 4 p.m. tomorrow,
and Cornell at 1:30 pm. Tuesday.

A 6~2 junior forwardrguard,
Frantz has rammed in 411 points
in the Pioneers' first 17 tilts for a
24.2 average and is only 34 shy of
the school mark of 445 set by John
Musser in 195455. He leads the
Midwest Conference with a 23.8
average on 310 points in 13 appear-
Ances.

Frantz's‘name is already prom-
Inently displayed in the Grinnell
record book. He set a new sopho-
more standard of 391 points a year
ago and earlier this season claimed
new single game point (46) and
field goal (22) marks.

In addition, Frantz leads the
pioneers in the rebounding depart-
ment with 158 and is a defensive
standout. His performances have
been about the only bright spots in
an otherwise drab season that has
seen Grinnell win only six of 17
games. Now 479 in the Midwest
Conference, the loopsters are only
one-half game out of the cellar.

While the Pioneers have a re
epectable 4'3 mark at home, they
have lost eight of 10 games on the
toad, including the last six.

Joining Frantz in the starting
lineup for the Monmouth, Knox,
and Cornell tilts will be the team’s
two other consistent scorers, for-
ward Tom Hill and guard Elliott
Hibhs, both sophomores. Hill has
tallied 2M markers for a 13.2 av-
erage and Hibbs has collected 217
for a 12.8 average.

The other two starters will come
among senior forward - center
Clyde Smith, junior forward-cen-
ter Ted Risser, and sophomore
guard Bob Watt.

Smith and Risser, at 673 the tall-
est Pioneers, have both been in
scoring slumps recently and have
seen their averages drop to 8.1
and 7.1, respectively. Watt has a
an average.

The annual highlight of the Grinnell winter sports season occurs
this weekend as the swimming, wrestling, and indoor track conference
meets take place at various midwest locations. In recent years the
Pioneers have fared quite well in these meets, and with a little luck
they should do so again this year.

The swimming team travels to Northfield to splash around in
Carleton's new pool, There are apparently three teams with a shot at
the title — Beloit, Cornell, and Grinnell. The Ploneers defeated Beloit
and lost to Cornell on a disqualification in dual meets. Conference
meets are a different story, however, and dual meets cannot be used
to predict the outcome. John Kraai, Tony Horton, Ken Adelman, and
Ralph Pray should lead the Pioneer assault. It will be, in any event,
an exciting meet which could easily be decided at the finale in the
400-yard freestyle relay. All three of the contenders have true teams
in the event and they could ﬁnish within a body length of each other.

The wrestling team, meanwhile, will he in Monmouth carrying
the Scarlet and Black flag, possibly without the services of their cap—
tain Larry Miller. Miller was iniured last weekend, and thus Bill
Barnes and Ken Stl'ubler in the lighter weights and Marty Ringo and
Morgan Michel in the heavier weights will have to give the team
needed points. Two Grinnellians who could surprise are Mike Death-
erage and Gary Wilson. It is not known whether Wilson is eligible,
for he just transferred back to Grinnell alter a semester at West
Point. At any rate, Cornell, Monmouth, Carleton, and Grinnell are
contenders with Cornell cast in the favorites role.

The track team is traveling to Chicago for its conference meet,
which Grinnell has Won the last three years in a row. Running in the
meet, in addition to the ten conference schools, is the University of
Chicago, which seems to be head and shoulders above the conference
teams. The Pioneers can still win the conference championship, how-
ever, if they can outrun the Midwest Conference teams and finish sec-
ond to Chicago. The troops are somewhat depleted this season in
numbers, and thus they are only entered in three relays instead of the
usual five. Paul Patterson, Steve Brintnall, John TePaske and Mike
DeWitt should provide strength in the running events while Tom
Wood and Jim Miller should score well in the field events. Carleton,
Monmouth, Cornell, and Grinnell should be in the race for honors in
track.

One hundred swimming devotees
packed the Grinnell Water Arena
to capacity last Saturday to see
the formerly undefeated Pioneer
varsity swimmers receive their
first setback of the season from
the stillrunbeaten Cornell Rams.

in 20 years of rivalry, this was
only the second victory that Cor-
nell has been able to take from
the Pioneer mermen.

The Rams took the lead and the
victory in the last event of the af-
ternoon, the ADD-yard freestyle re-
lay. The linal tally was 5045.

Had it not been for a disqualifi-
cation in the final event, Grinnell
would have clinched at least a tie
for the conference crown. The ju-
biiant Pioneer anchor man finished
four lengths ahead of his Cornell
pursuer only to find that his team
had been disqualified.

Contrary to pre-meet speculation,
only three records were broken,
two of them by Cornell. Cornell’s
Tom Steinberg set a new pool rec,
ord of 5142.2 in the 5mryard free-
style, while teammate Jim Green
sprinted the ZOO-yard freestyle for
a new pool mark,

Grinnell’s freshman Steve Holtze
showed promise of being a valu-
able addition to next year's var-
sity by setting a new school and
pool record in the loo-yard indi-
vidual medley with a time of
1:455. In addition to the new rec-
ord, Holtze won the ZOO-yard back-
stroke and Zoo—yard breaststroke
events for the freshmen.

Despite an almost tragic mis-
calculation of points in the diving
event and numerous false starts
in other events, the Grinnell team
was able to cop first place honors
in diving, the zoo-yard butterfly,

 

yard breaststroke, and the 4%
yard medley relay.

Winners in the individual events
were Richard Lance, Ken Adel-
man, Tony Horton, and John
Kraai, respectively. By winning
the ADO-yard medley relay, Grin-
nell gave the Ram team its first:

Other Pioneers with good prosa

Frosll to End Year
Willi Knox Yearlings

Tomorrow aftemoon at 1:00 the
promising freshman hoopsters try
to improve their a and 2 record
against a strong Knox quintet.
Following their fourth Victory
(over Saga) Tuesday, coach An-
derson feels his freshman five is
ready for a peak performance
with all members of the squad
scheduled to see action. A winning
season would be the first in sev-
eral years for a fresh ball club.

Eager to avenge last week’s loss
to Cornell, the starting five which
has played well throughout most
of the season will be Mike Sch<
wartz and Jim Poison at guards,
Roger Able at center, and Greg
Rankin and Dick Musser at for-
wards. With all five starters av-
eraging in double figures, the team
is averaging over at) points a game
and should display a fast-moving
offense as well as a bustling de-
tense.
