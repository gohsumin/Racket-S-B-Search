changes and the pace of progress
that are possible. In closing. i
asked the Senate to realize that
some matters are too small to be
concerned with, and some are too
large to be changed"

in clarifying the role he has
played as student government
leader, Goddard said that the
principles he has tried to main-
tain were born of “three years of
watching my predecessors try to
eiiect change by stirring the stu-
dents to an irrational frenzy or by
playing political footsy with the col-
lege administration." He ex-
plained that these methods bring
nothing but distrust toward stu»
dent government, and referred to
his term of office as “a year of
relative calm in student—adminis-
tration relations."

Points to Problems

Reviewing the past year, he
said, “I think dorm life has been
quite satisfactory this year.” ad-
ding that he no longer believes
there is a ”North Campus Prob-
lem" as such. He did, however.
point out certain problems on
North Campus "South pit, Langan
basement, and Cowles zoo, forming
Grinnell’s own iron triangle, are
areas for concern but certainly not
reformist panic."

Goddard mentioned that he
thinks the students have shown a
“substantial improvement” over
last year in regard to incidents
of malicious damage to college and
personal property, and “disorder-

1y conduct resulting itom intoxi-
cation." Goddard suggested. “It
might be well for those who are
recommending the solutions to all
our problems and who seem to
hear only oi the sordid incidents,
to move into some of the vacant
rooms they have created and ex«
perience North Campus life on a
day-to-day basis.”

Slams 5&3

Turning to student aciiVlties,
Goddard said, “The campus is do-
ing pretty well. With the possible
exception of the basketball team
and the 5&3, students seem to be
taking up their spare time with
fairly worthwhile and Successful
endeavors.” Excepting John Wolf,
he said, “The staff at our campus
newspaper has shown an incred-
ible lack of imagination and re»
porting accuracy, 1 would suggest
that perhaps they should spend
less time gazing at comets and
picket lines and more time consid<
ering their responsibilities to their
readers."

Shifts Ground

Goddard decided at this point,
“to shift the ground of this speech
away from some of our rather
narrow student government con-
cerns and discuss what I think is
a broader and more important
problem of the entire college com
munity. In so doing, I am going
to briefly sketch some history of
the college in the past decade be-
cause it is helpful to an under-
standing oi our most serious short-
coming.”

 

He then proceeded to paint a
picture of Grinneii in its heyday
under President Bowen. He Called
attention to Grinnell’s financial
difficulties in the early ‘505 and
enumerated the successful finan-
cial efforts undertaken by the col-
lege under Bowen. Goddard also
lauded the curriculum changes of
this period reierring speciﬁcally
to the freshman distinction pro
gram, the American Studies ma-
jol', the Argonne semester, and the
construction of the present lan-
guage laboratory.

Praises Bowen Period

His next topic was the social
liie during the Bowen period, and
he said that during this period
the college’s attitude was that
there was real value in having the
students meet and solve their own
problems. Regarding his sketch or
the Bowen years, he said, “The
reason I am recalling all this to
your attention is because I think
it illustrates an aspect oi Grinnell
College that has been at least Iorv
gotten, it not lost entirely.

“in the late ’505 and early ’505
this college had a sense of dir-
rection, a commitment of what it
was, where it was going, and how
it was going to get there. There
was a sense of social and intel-
lectual excitement, as climate of
optimism on the campus."

Laments Loss
He continued, “But in the last
tow years this spirit, this dyna-
mism, and this willingness to
move ahead with more liberal

 

programs has been lost. Grinneii
College is no longer at the fore-
front of education and community
organization. Beyond evidence or
any planning, Grinnell seems to
have lost sight of the liberal ideal.
it has lost its committment to pro-
gl‘essivism, no matter what the
cost. And it has lost the sense of
excitement that once prospered on
this campus

to all the conservative forces that
plague an institution without pur-
pose. Rather than continuing to
liberalize student social freedom.
the college has chosen to tighten
the rules and contract the pro
grams. Liberalism now seems to
depend on the absence of object—
ion from the outside forces RathA

er than telling its donors to spend
their money elsewhere if they
don’t agree with progressive cam-
pus policies, the college is now
advising students who desire a
more liberal living situation to
transfer to another institution
This if»you»don’t~iike»it7get-out at-
titude can only atrophy commu—
nity imagination."
Places Responsibility

According to Goddard, the re
sponsibility ior eradicating this
attitude “rests With the students
who have abdicated their respon~
sibility to the community, the fac-
ulty who have not supported the
administration against outside
pressure, and the parents and
alumni who believe only what they
read about Grinnell in the Des
Moines Register."

In closing, Goddard said, “I
would like to express my special
thanks to some of the people I’ve
been proud to work with this
year.” He cited Dean Thompson
ioi~ bringing “a much - needed
pragmatism to the conduct of stu-
dent affairs over the past two
years," and he praised Dean win-
ters as “probably the most out-
standing administrator to come to
Grinnell in recent years."

Thanks Associates

He thanked Ellen Detering, sec-
relary oi the Senate, and Cherie
Joiner, secretary of the executive
cabinet. “And finally I want to
express my gratitude to Chris (Pe-
terson) whose confidence and sup-
port have been a continuing source
at happiness for me. at all 1 have
gained irom my work in student
government this year, her friend-
ship ranks highest.”
