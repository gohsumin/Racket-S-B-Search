can conference that unity in that
continent on a national or c»
gional ba' is necessary for its
survival in a rapidly industrial-
izing world.

Centralized control is neces-
sary, he said, to overcome the
effects of the immense complex-
ity and diversity oi Africa and
its peoples. Pointing out that
authorities have divided the
continent into some 45 cultural
groups, among which there are
at least 10 major language dia-
lects, only three of them wide-
spread. he said that Africa’s
diversity cannot be grasped, on-
ly “respecter”

Strong central government, he
said too, will restrict the at-
tempts oi entrenched power
groups to hinder national pres
grass.

The new government will
need a great deal of assistance
from the us. and Europe and
will undoubtably get some from
Russia. he said. The only re—
quirement which should be at—
tached to such aid, he said, is
that the funds be used only for
economic development.

He pointed out that a single
dam in one backward country
is more meaningful than the
speeches given by “temporary
governmental leaders,” A road

“The democratic forms which
emerge in Africa may not be the
same as those in the United
States and Europe-because they
must reflect African yalucs and
traditions,“ said Ronald Etllllnr
ger (visiting, pol, sci.) iii a lens
turc here last Friday night.

Speaking in coniunction with
the international Relations Club
sponsored weekend Ali-icon Cons
fcrcncc, he said that democracy
is a means. not an end to his-
torical development in Africa.
There wlll soon be 31 indepen—
dent African states, he pointed
out, and the problem of divers—
ity in African cultures has
arisen.

The question today, he said, is:
"To whom should power be
given?” A few years ago the
difficulty centered in relations
between whites and non—whites

The states in Africa are Euro»
pean creations and they have
been unified by common legal
and political institutions Behind
this lies an African cultural life
of great diversity, he said.

Throughout most of their his
tory the Africans have lived in
extreme independence in their
small, isolated tribal units, he
added.

According to Ballingcr, the
problem now is to keep the
newly independent states from
dissolving again The answer,
he said. lies in modernization
and in the recognition of na-
tional diversityi
