Senate Approves New
With little hdo Over Anything

By DICK CHADY
Atter a minimum at debate the Senate

passed a $56,500 budget last night,
thus completing what has been a major
eitort for the few individuals lnvolved
in the process. The entire budget was
compiled by the Finance Commitiee,
which had spent about 20 hours in the
last two weeks trying to make expendo
tures and income balance.

The only part of the budget to come
under debate was the recommendation
to shift $4800 from hall social funds to
the jurisdiction of a “Hall Initiative Cum—
mittee." Stan Wezelman proposed that
$2400 of the amount be given back to
halls because the plan was still an
experiment This year the Hall Initiative
Fund was only 5300. Previously halls
received $11,000. Next year they will get
36500. the balance going to the initiative
Committee:

Jane Strucke and Phil Berthenthal,
both members of the Finance Committee,
answered that the plan had proved it-
sell this year and that additional funds
were needed to allow all balls to take
advantage oi the program.

Debate then centered around the pur<
pose of the iund, CoiHP President Bob
Footo explained that this would, in ei-
tect, create $5,000 of -“satety money"

udget

which could not be used to pay also
bills, because it would be out of the
jurisdiction of halls,

The lurid is to be administered by a
committee of seven. composed of the
North and South Campus social chair—

Riot Produces little Damage;
Spring Day Da wns Depressing

By BOB HODIERNE

There were ﬁreworks, illegal visita-
tions and beers galore during Tuesday‘s
Spring Riot but when the dust cleared
there were still 11 'men's halls on North
Campus

Walkie — talkie - toting CofHP offi-
cials who were almost as ubiquitous as
Sada-Cyclone photographers managed to
keep the annual destruction rate within
the conﬁnes of imagination. Threats oi
stilt eiilorcement or damage rules
tended to drive most people indoors for
the evening.

Bob Foote, Coil-[P president, said that
“compared to last year's riot destruc-
tion, this year's is negligible."

Foote said that on South Campus the
only damage was jammed loggia locks.
Evidently someone had stuffed tooth~
picks into the works of the locks ren-
dering them inoperable Bate, said Foote,
was able to salvage all but one at the
locks and the total bill there should be
about $25.

On North Campus Foote said he was
“hoping damage hills would total under
5100." Last year’s total was over SHOUT
Foote indicated, however, that these were
only early estimates.

Most of the North Campus damage
resulted from torn-out screens and brok<
on windows. “A number of these have
been assessed to "individuals," said
Foote. The student governing agencies
had decided before the riot to assess
as many damage bills to individuals as

possible thus saving social funds which
traditionally pay for the damage.

Several students were injured on
North Campus according to St Eugene
Thompson, dean of men. One man was
injured when he was burned by a
thrown firecracker. Another was cut by
broken glass Still another broke oil a
tooth when he fell down.

Spring Day dawned as it has the last
two-out—ot-three years — cloudy, cold,
and unspring-like. A picnic lunch and
dlnner were both_moved indoors. A
continental breakfast was served on
North Campus and to stifle boredom
many groups got involved in really
“hot” games of monopoly, bridge, etti,
Gloriously, the free bowling that had
been scheduled for the afternoon was
not called off,

The alternoon before the riot incoming
CofHP, AWS Board, and Senate leads
ets were kidnapped and takeniuncere-
moniously—to the city jaili A iew man-
aged to escape, however. They were
reported hiding in such places as the
Main Hall elevator, which they stopped
between floors.

At the jail Dali Bucks gave a speech
about his constitutional rights being vi-
olated. It was the second speech within
a week that Bucks delivered with little
or no results.

After some delicate negotiations the
inmates were allowed to place the tra-
ditional one phone call, They placed it
to the pizza place for dinner.

Smith Dinner Turns Sour,-
Loggia Fines Under Attack

Conduct probation was recommended
for three Smith Hall freshmen last Fri-
day by the Men's Primary Courts '

The three pleaded guilty to a charge
of violating Article II, Section I of the

Men’s House Rules. which prohibits
consumption at liquor at college social
functions '

They were.retuming from a hall din-
ner in the Amanas in the college's “cov-
ered wagon," when a cigarette was
tossed into some signal flags kept in the

bus. The bus driver, finding one of the
llags burned, confronted the three, and
deciding that they were drunk, reported
them to Dean of Men 5. Eugene Thomp-
son.

Thompson contacted Smith Hall Fresh
ident Dan Markman and the freshmen
were brought to court, where their trial
lasted only 20 minutes. Thompson could

The book, One in Seven: Drugs on
campus, cites Grinnell as a typical mid-
western college where ever-increasing
amounts oi marijuana are being used.
The book is written by Richard Gold-
stein, a 21-yearold graduate student at
Columbia University.

“Grinneli is one of the many schools
in the Midwest which have groups of
city people who go out there and feel
alienated from their home environment."
says Goldsteio,

“They want immediately .to dlitel'entl-
ate themselves from the mass; so, they
very often take on a Bohemian exterior.
They form tight groups.

“Dnlgs otten play a part in these
groups. They’re one way of saying I'm
different." says the Hunter College grad-
uate.

The main reason, says Goldstein, for
