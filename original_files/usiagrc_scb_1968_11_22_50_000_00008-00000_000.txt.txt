Rich Pope, and Hal Dale,

What in particular should
swim fans watch for this year?

“This year," says Coach
Obermiiler," we’ve got the
potential to break every Grin-
neli record except one (back-
stroke).n

How should the team finish
in the conierence standings
this year?

“This year," says Coach
Obermiller, “we should finish
in the ﬁrst division" Al-
though the Grinneii team is
better this year than any
team in several years, lack at
depth may prevent it from
winning in the conference.
“But," says Coaqh obermill-
er, “we‘ve got a shot at one,"

in contrast to the cautious
optimism C o a c h Oben-nillor

pressed optlmlstia e a u ti o n

“it’s too early to tell much,
but the freshmen look pretty

Immortal Glory
In Three Inches

Recently, there have been
several misleading and dan-
gerous rumors that Arthur 1‘.
Quang, that giant ﬁgure in
t w e n t i e t h cen»
tury thought, never
existed. The reek
dents of the Zappa
Passion Pit would
like to straighten out these mis<
understandings before the con-
troversy gets out of control.

Quang, the patron saint oi
the Pit, Was born in the musha
melon capital of the world,
Batchtown, Illinois, He no-
tended Bethany Bible College
and, after a dishonorable dis-
charge, founded the Quang
Academy of Base Thought.
Queng died of an obscure so‘
clel disease in 1332i His most
notable contribution to Western
Philosophy was his remarkably.
perceptive and immensely pm
found statement, “Let’s keen
it crude. . . ." As a fitting
memorial to Arthur 1., the
Zappa Passion Pit has adopted
this quotation as its motto.

‘BROTHERS' SLAUGHTER
FACULTY ‘lAMBS' 57-37

With a strong surge in the see-
one half, the CBS “Brothers"
clamped a 51-31 defeat on the
Grinnell Faculty "Lambs" in
last Friday's Martin Luther
King, Jr. Scholarship Benefit
game.

The Brothers jumped off to a
quick 10-2 lead in the opening
minutes. But a steady attack
by the faculty and a seeming
cold spell iorced a tight game.
At the halt the Brothers led
by only two baskets.

The half-time festivities con-
sisted of the announcing of the
“Mystery Queen," Miss Odette
deLecluse. Mr. Joseph Wall,
Chairman of the Faculty, an<
nounced her selection to the sur.
prise of all—including her. The
Queen descended from the stands
and passed through a tunnel
formed by the two teams while
the crowd applauded wildly. Mn
Wall awarded her with kissel
and roses.

“1 thank you from the bottom

of my heart,” said the Queen,
addressing her over 600 subjects
present at the game, “For the
first time since i've been so
Grinneli, i’m almost speeclln

less."

The second half was over]
hit as exciting as the first.
“V-I-C~i- S. Are we vicious!
Hell yes!" was the cry or thl
CBS cheerleaders as the Broth-
ers began to gradually increasi
their lead

In spite of their gallant st-
iorls and fancy ball handling.
the faculty could not stymio
the CBS surge. The Brother!
went on to win, 57437.

The game, which
some 600 spectators, netted
$304.43 for the scholarship
fund. The fund, named in holy
or of the late Dr. King, was
initiated by the Concerned
Black Students and endorsed
by the college, It will he used
to aid needy black students.
