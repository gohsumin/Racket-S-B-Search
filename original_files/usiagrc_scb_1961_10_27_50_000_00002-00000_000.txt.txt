Another isdaimel

In August a Peace corps trainee, Charles Kamcn, ins
terrupted a Rotary Club meeting at which the House Un—
American Activities Film “Operation Abolition” was being
shown, expressed rather openly his opposition to the film,
and provided the incident for a little known amendment
to the Peace Corps Act passed in the last days of this ses—
sion of Congress .

After the incident which received wide publicity in
the American newspapers, Con 'ressmen placed a ,2 eat deal
of pressure on Peace Corps Di ector R. Sargent Sh ver to
dismiss Kamen, but Shriver refused to dismiss hinl on
'rounds otli than psychological tests, security investiga—
tions and ab ity tests to determine his suitability for Peace
Corps assignments '

Congress has,expressed its feelings on this matter in
an amendment to the Peace Corps Act, however, which has
received considerably less mention than the Kamen inci-
dent. This amendment is a disclaimer affidavit differing

‘om tllat attached to the National Defense Education Act
of 1958 only in that it does not require the Peace Corps
candidate to deny membership in a long list of specific or—
ganizations.

Such an oath is really of no value since most Coni-
munists would not hesitate to take it. However, much
more important than this is the fact that this law extends
into the very vague area of an individanl’s belief in right
and wronigr and leads to debates such as those of the House
Un-American Activities Committee. Although most of us
would object to having a Peace Co ps member who advocat-
ed the overthrow of our constitutional form of government,
we question whether opposition to the film “Operation
Abolition" or the House Un-American Activities Committee
constitutes advocation of the overthrow of Constitutional
government. The history of this amendment would indicate
Ellis, however.

It is unfortunate that this amendment has been at-
tached to a bill which is in all other ways an outstanding"
piece of legislation. The first section of the bill states the
purpose of the law as two-fold: to provide technical aid by
the United States for any nation wanting it and to provide
an opportunity for Americans to better understand cultures
and problems different from their own.

Two years ago 20 colleges and universities refused to
accept funds from the National Defense Education Act on
the basis of the disclaimer affidavit attached to it, Grinnell
was one of these with Bryn Mawr, Haverford. Princeton,
Antioch, Harvard, Oberlin, Radcliffe, Reed and others
Since this is again an issue which will involve students and
an area in which the voice of students is for great impor-
tance, perhaps we should'again express our opposition to
legislation of this sort. .

Secondly, this shows that programs such as Grinliell’s
“Fifth Year Abroad" to which no such stipulations are
attached have not yet been replaced by the Peace Corps.
We have already learned that some countries distrust the
sincerity of the United States government in this project,

and it is not likely that this disclaimer affidavit will erase ,

this distrust. Apparently the work of private organizctions
in this area should be continued for some time to come.
