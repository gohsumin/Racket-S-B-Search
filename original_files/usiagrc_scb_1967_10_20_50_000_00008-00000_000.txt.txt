GRIDDERS ROMP 40-20

ly JEFF SCHECKTER

The Pioneer football team
came back from a M record
and dumped the Knox siwash
40-10.

Doug Fink and Mike dchwarts
were clearly the heroes oi the
game. With the apparent de-
mise of the Hanratty—Seymour
combination, Fink and Schwarts
appear to be the new mldwest
passing sensations. Schwartl
caught seven passes and set
Grinneli record for total yards
gained by a receiver (106) and
most touchdown passes caught
in one game (A). Fink nar-
rowly missed setting a third
aerial mark in completing 10 of
17 passes for 156 yards and no
interceptions.

Saturday’s game provided
many thrilling moments for the
halt-capacity crowd. After a
scoreless first quarter. during
which Grinnell had the ball Oil
27 of 38 plays, the Pioneers
quickly showed what was to
follow. With only 1:34 gone in
the second quarter, Fink lofted
a 38 yard touchdown pass to
Schwartz. Torn Russell kicked
the extra point and Glinnell
led 7-0.

Two plays later, Grinnell had
the ball again as Bob Lillie
recovered a fumble on the Knox
21. Fink passed to Schwartz
from the five, Russell kicked
the extra point and Grinnell
led 14—0.

After Bill Wedding’s kickoff,
Knox got only to the Grinneil
41 before losing the ball on
downs. Ten plays later. Dick
Lamb carried the ball in from
the one yard line, Torn Russell
kicked his third extra point and
the Pioneers had a 21-0 lead.

Knox finally got on the score.
board with 27 seconds lelt ill
the half. After a twelve play
drive. Dave Ladner dove in the
end zone from the one foot line.
Dan Gunning kicked the extra
point and the half ended with
the Pioneers leading the Siwash
21-7.

The second half was almost
a repeat of the second quarter.

, Fink again passed to Schwartz

for e touchdown. this one going
nine yards. The two point con-
version falled and the score

stood at 21-7. Later in the third
period. Schwartz caught a in
yard toss from Fink to culmi-
note a 61 yard drive. Weddin
kicked the PAT and the thir
quarter ended with the score
Grinnell 34. Knox 1.

In the final quarter. Kent
Thomson got into the scoring
act with e {I yard touchdown
on a reverse play. The point
try failed, but with 9:39 left
in the game the Pioneers had
a 40-7 lead. Knox finally started
to play football and scored
twice; once on a quarterback
keeper by Doyle Clark and
again on a 13 yard pass from
Clark to Jim Hallock. Only one
PAT try was successful and the
game ended with Grinnoli win-
ning 40-20.

The Knox game pointed out
many of the Pioneer strengths
and weaknesses. The team dem-
onstrated that they could sus-
tain successful drives (27, 38,
so, 49, or and 49 yards) and
perform with a balanced ah
tack (288 yards rushing and
175 passing). Defense proved to
be a problem for the Pioneers
in the last minutes of each
half. All of the Knox points
occurred within six minutes oi
the end of the half. This per-
haps more than anything also
illustrates how the lack of dew]:
is hurting the Pioneer hopes.

Grinneil‘s next home game is
with Monmouth during Super
Weekend. Monmouth has a bet<
ter team than in previous years
and could easily prove to be
a very tough opponent for the
Pioneers.

THE iiiBlTZEii ,

By JOHN R“

The Standard American bidding system places rigid limita-
tions on only one opening bid, the bid of One NoTrump. Opener
must have between sixteen and eighteen high card points, and no
suit weaker than Qx or xxx. Because of the clarity of definition in
this bid, Responder can exercise several choices in his responses.

if he has no preference for play in a suit, he will bid directlg
the following NoTrump contracts:

2 NoTrump, with 8 or 9 points or 7 and a good fiva card suit.

8 No’l‘rump. with 10 to 14 points

4 NoTrump. with 15 to 16 points (if Opener has maximum

he bids 6)

6 NOTlump, with 17 or 18 points
Forcing old then a NoTrump, with two points (if Opener has
maximum he bids 7)
1 No'l‘rump, with 21 points.
If he has slam intentions he may jump directly into the 4d
Gerber Convention. 4C-Partner. how many aces? (dB-zero or three.

iii-one, ds-two.)

If he has a preference for e suit contract and has a weak or
very strong hand he may use Jacoby Transfer Bids. These are

used in order to keep the strong hand concealed.

relay principle:

They use the

2D, relay bid 0-8 points, Opener must bid 2H.

2H, relay bid same as above but Opener must bid 25.

25, relay bid same as above but Opener must bid INT; Ro-
spender signs off at 3c Dl‘ 5D.

if after Opener has bid, responder nbids;

this shows a strong

hand with invitation to slam. The precise requirements should be
decided by the partnership; for example. 14 or more points and a
strong distributional hand would be reasonable.

If responder has between B and 12 or 13

points and a good

d—card major suit(e) he will want to know if Opener has Hard
support for a game in that major. He uses then the Stayman Conn
vention by bidding 2C. This bid can be game forcing or non-furo-
ing. in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer Bids it should be
game forcing. Opener’s bids are then:

2H or ZS, shows Hard major; bid 2H with both

2D, denial of l-card major; min. Nonmp hand

2N, denial of i-card major; max. NoTrump hand

Responder then intends to raise partner’s Zn or 25 bid to
game; otherwise he rebids his suit conveniently or raises NT in

game.

if responder has a long semisolid suit which can lose no more
than one trick and a possible outside entry. or if he has I ready-
made suit (like AKQJxx); he can show that suit by directly bid-
ding it at the three level: 3C, 3D, 3H, 35.

it he has a long topless major suit with d or 6 playing tricks
and a weak hand with no more than 10 points, he can show it by
using the Texas Transfer Bids which also operate on the relay

principle:

41), relay bid Opener must bid 4H. Responder passes.

in, relay bid Opener must bid 45

There is probably a good play for game.

The {our level can also be reserved for the first Culbertson
Asking Bid (see The Kibitzer, Sept. 22). And. of course. if Ro<
sponder has a weak hand and a preference to play the next one.

he may pass.
