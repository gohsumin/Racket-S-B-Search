Grinnellians Travel to Des Moines
To Prepare for Civil Rights Project

Last Saturday afternoon, nine
Grinnell students rode into Des
Moines to find out more about the
Grinnell Civil Rights Group’s Des
Moines Project. Originally the slu~
dents had planned to survey the
residents of the slum area. which
is just north of the downtown dis-
trict, where they will be working.
instead they decided to listen to
the project's permanent worker in
Des Moines, Billy King, describe
the local situation in relation to
the project's problems and pros-
pects ior the hiture.

Those Grinnellians who went
were: Jean Vandervoort, Jane
Prescott, John Wecktor, Ian Smith,
Sam Donohoe, Ellen Linéoln,
pruce Armstrong, Bonnie Tinker,
erlecia Oldfnther; nnd~Jeff Hort.

King and Miss Vandervoort
staged a mock interview to dem-
onstrate ta Ute students how best
to approach residents when sur-
veying dues begin. King also said
that an organization oi Des Moines
high school students called Youth
for Freedom will Work on the
project.

The main goals oi the project
will be voter registration. action
on pending urban renewal plans oi
the city and the organization at
an area board in connection with
the federal War on Poverty. Sev-
eral students mentioned that
through this project the students
hoped to relieve some of the sense
of powerlessness felt by slum resi»
dents. King said that he wanted
to show the people that they can
fight city hall.

popular art, like eating, and each
of us is after all an authority on
what he likes.

As far as living memory is con-
cci-ncd, we've always “gone to the
movies“ here in Grinnell, yet not
in the past dozen years or so, and
perhaps never, have the tilm offer»
lngs been so well chosen. The
melancholy tact is that only a few
of the many movies produced coma
mand rcspeci in the judgment oi
those who devote their whole
time to discriminating the works
at art from works at mass enter
tainnlent. Occasionally a work oi
art is a paying proposition at the

box otticc. The Grinnell Film Sen
les, the Fine Arts Program and
the Forum Film Series have al-
lowed us to set the works of Fel-
Iini and Bresson by the side or
the commercial Hollywood prod-
uct. If we do end up preterring
the latter, we will have chosen
without our eyes open,

What's wrong with television is
that it doesn't provide, as attunell
does, a broad range ircm which to
choose your kind of cinema, The
neighborhood theater can’t attord
to disagree often 'th the majority,
what the authorities on iilm in
our age claim is that the great di-
rector has now taken his place

ably stand the full glare of criti-

Asia is emerging to vic with
America and Europe in the art of
iilm making and we should see
some oi the masterpieces ot Japan

The cinema program includes
much excitement during the ycnr

secret that we live in an age ct
great directors. We owe much,
thereiorc. to those tilm buffs, or
cinemaniacs, who arc, in various

It’s the year oi the him at Grin-

Sophs, Juniors:
Dare to Face Need

An Open Letter to Sophomores and
Juniors:
NOW is the time to stop and
think. why aren’t you going to
LeMoyne? You think it's a great
idea, don’t you; out ior someone
else. How many reasons have you
created to avoid deciding to go?
I know them all, and there are
manyAl came up with them all
myselt. It’s very easy to find ex-
cuses for staying in your comfort-
able Grinnell rut, for not having
to face yourscli in a new and
challenging position. But now, to
day, is the time to face yourself,
to dare to say "I can. i will."

No major is so inﬂexible that
you will not graduate it you miss
a semester, no class is so exclu»
sively Grinnell’s that it cannot be
taken at LeMoyne. or one oi
Memphis' other three colleges if
necessary. No organization is go-
ing to tail apart it you leave, and
ynur hall will survive with a new
bafﬂeboard or house council mem-
ber. And it you and that special
girl or guy can’t lace a semes-
ter apart. . .You are not indis-
pensible at Grinnell.

LeMoyne needs you, however.
The faculty, administration, Ind
most of all. the students, want this
exchange program to work. it is
our choice as to whether or not
it will continue. There Is another
world at LcMoyne, in Memphis; a
world waiting to be understood.
wanting to share its joys and
sorrows. Them are friends in
Memphis, waiting for you. There
are hours or conversation hanging
in me air—conversation that will
force you to discover yourself, for
you will be challenged to explain
youiself. There lire classes to
learn from, and to contribute what
you alone can give. There iii-e slur
dent groups waiting icr your ideas
and experiences. There are chil-
dren whose eyes will glow at your
friendship. {or a friendly white
face is raw There is fun, and
heartache; learning, and unlenm»
ing. More than anyihing, there is
a new you waiting in Men‘bhls; a
wiser, more llnderstzndlng person.
a much more necessary person.
You are needed: how can you not
go to LeMayne?

 

 

Plans Going Ahead for New College;
Si. Olaf Assists Tuskegee Negroes

By PAUL BRADLEY

Four professors from Amherst,
Smith, Mount l-loiyoke, and the
University of Massachusetts met in
the Summer of 1958 to draw up
the plan ior is new college equi-
distant from the {our existing in-
stitutions. But not until Harold F.
Johnson, Amherst class of 1918,
gave six million did these college
plans come out of storage, The
new college will be known as
Hampshire College and will oper—
ate as a coeducational liberal arts
institution. Through cooperation
oi the tour schools, Hampshire
should be completed by May of
1968.

The new institution Will serve as
a catalyst to accelerate the co-
ordination of the tour surrounding
colleges, will experiment with ed-
ucational innovations, and hope-
fully will substantially reduce the
cost or a college education without
impairing its quality. Freshmen
would attend seminars consisting

 

of twelve students each; students
would study only three courses at
a time, making possible greater
concentration of effort; and inde-
pendent and student group work
would be substantially emphtlr
sized.
it n o

Sixty~five students from St. Olaf
spent the summer in Tuskegee,
Ala. They lived with Negro fam—
ilies and tutored the adults. Many
oi the adults previously could not
write their own names and had
never heard classical music.

The tutors worked under the
s u m in e r Education Program,
which is federally financed
through the Office of EcUnomic
Opportunity and the Office at Ed-
ucation. Altogether there were six
hundred tutors, five hundred and
thirty of them Negroes, working
in the area surrounding Tuskegee
Institute. The Summer Education
Program is spoken of as a second
front to the civil rights movement,
but the tutors are forbidden to
demonstrate.

“To return refreshed Ind ready
to import new knowledge" is the
way Andrew Brown (German) de-
scribed the value of a sabbatical
leave.

Brown spent last semester in
Munich, Germany, working on a
book about the eighteenth century
playwright and critic Lessing.

While in Germany, Brown Ind
his family traveled to cities near
Munich and enjoyed a more ex-
tensive trip at Easter.

"We had been to Germany five
years before." Brown commented.
“ ‘The economic miracle' has
gained ground in even so short a
time. There has been an impres-
sive degree of rebuilding. Few
remnants of the war are left."

One Munich art gallery was no
ticcably left unrestored. "As if it
were a monument to destruction,"
Brown suggested.
