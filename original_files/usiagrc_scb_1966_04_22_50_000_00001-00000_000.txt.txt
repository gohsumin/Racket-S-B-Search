Just Another Senate Meeting
Until Bucks Delivers Speech

By DICK CHADY

The Senate meeting was goingto be
lust another Senate meeting—filled with
the events which alter and illuminate
student politics: confirming nominations
and establishing committees.

The SGA President announced that he
had attended several committee meet-
ings; the AWS Board President said
that hours were being reevaluated,

Men's Couri Fines
To Have More Bile

From now on students who take more
than a week to pay their Men’s Pri-
mary Court fines risk going on conduct
probation, according to Tim Daily,
Chief Magistrate of that court.

Daily said that since November they
hava handed out eight fines and only
two have been paid. “In other words, the
court is being ignored," said Daily.

Week to Pay

Under the old system a student was
given a week to either pay his fine or
appeal it to the high court. If the student
didn't pay, there was no way for the
court to get the money.

Under the new system, after the week
has expired the Court will reconsider

In a prepared speech, Dan Bucks in-
dicted “leadership groups" for tailing to
“overcome bureaucratic concerns and
inspire imagination and idealism." He
said that it was the task of “those on
the periphery of influence" to “prod the
centers of decision-making into consid-
ering new ideas."

He said that the failures of the hu-
reaucratic perspective are that it over.

Drug Use on Rise
0n College Campus

By BOB HODIERNE

It you talk to lots of different kinds
of people on campus about marijuana at
Grinnell you become convinced that its
use increased greatly this past fall. But
Gl'innell is not alone in this respect. A!
Federal Narcotics Commissioner Henry
L. Giordano said in testimony to the
House Appropriations Subcommittee in
March, “This drug—taking trend in col-
leges has jumped a great deal in the
last two years. 1’

How widespread the use of marijuana
is on campus is an open question. When
describing other campuses the chief psy-
chiatrist at the University of California
at Berkely said “at any big-city uni-
varsity or sophisticated. small liberal
arts college, ll) per cent of the students
will experiment with LSD or marijuana."

Most students who will venture esti—
mates also indicate that the number of
students who continue to use marijuana
after a few contacts is very small, The
number of one—or two—time users who
try it just to see what it’s like seems to
be fairly substantial

Further, the type of student who tries
It does not seem to be limited. or in
other words, not just the so—called
“beats" have tried marijuana. “Nice"
kids have tried it for the same reason

'Liberal' Politics
Of NSA Cause
Varied Response

By ANN KIRSCHNER

The National Student Association. a
confederation of approximately 325 col-
lege and university student governments,
has been accused over the past few
years of not accurately representing its
members. At the forefront of the critl.
cisrn are the National STDPANSA Com-
mittee and the Young Americans for
Freedom. It has been said that NSA
is staunchly supported by Communist
and other left-wing groups.

Literature concerning the various at.
titudes toward NSA was anonymously
submitted to the SH! this past week.
Included was a pamphlet put out by
the STOP-NSA Committee. which George
Wittgraf, Grinnell’s NSA Coordinator.
says is several years old and‘probably
inaccurate. According to the pamphlet,
"NSA has become increasingly involved
in political activity" so that “its serv-

ices to member schools have becomo'
negligible ” The committee charges that '

NSA has not been satisfactorily fulfill-

Will Issue Statement
To Parents, Students

Grinnell’s administration tomorrow
will issue a three page statement to the
student body about “Student Use of
Drugs."

The statement — to be placed in mail-
boxes and mailed to the parents of stu-
dents tomorrow —- says that the colleg.
"will not adopt the position that ‘it can'(
happen here', but does affirm a high
level of confidence in the mature judg-
ment of its student body when drugs on
rumors of drug use are present, and of-
fers the full extent of its resources in
meeting concerns of students. "

The statement is offered (according to
its introduction) “in response to a recent
warning and appeal by the Food and
Drug Administration of the United State!
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, and also in response to current
discussion among students, parents, edlh
cators, and the general public."

The statement — several months in
preparation — was originally to be re-
leased late in May when a book by
Richard Goldstein about drugs on cam-
pus (Hey Mr. tambourine Man: Drug;
on Campus) is scheduled to be releaserL

A recent flood of publicity about drugs .
on other campuses, however, prompted
the administration to release the report
now. Earlier this week an Iowa City
newspaper printed a story about drugs
on the campus there that evidentally
caught the University of Iowa admin-
istration by surprise, president Leggett
indicated that he didn’t want Grinnell to
be put in a position to deal with this issue
after it had been brought up by someonl
else.

The three-page statement is essentl<
ally a statement about the possible of.
fects oi various drugs. It is frank and
clinical.

The statement concludes saying that

New Look—

The Scarlet and Bllclr bu
changed its printing format to!
Ihe first time in 31 years thll
week. We have made It, on
think, easier to read and mom
pleasant to look at.

To do this we have widened
each column of type by one-
tlurd inch (this column is nearly
the size of the old columns) and
cut the number from five to
four.

We have also eliminated tho
line between the columns (called
“ntles”) and left I wider sep-
aration of nothing but whit.
space (called “gutters").

We are also varying the sin
and style of type more now the.
we did in the past.

We hope that you will fed
free to comment on the chains"
