New York Times University Survey
Probes Attitudes Toward Regulations

A favorite otf-cal'npus coffee
lhop It Cornell University is
called “The Unmuzzled OK," it
takes the name from the Bible
verse; "Thou shalt not muzzle
the bit when he treadcth out
the corn."

The verse, according to the
New York Times, reflects as
nccurately as possible a trend
Imong university authorities to
let students run their an lives
-—especially sex lives. The pa-
per took a survey on student
regulations at Columbia, Cora
nell, Fordham, New York Uni-
versity, Princeton, and Yale.

The survey found that uni-
versity officials. while reluctant
to legislate “in loco pal‘entis”
have been self-admittedly slow
to adjust regulations to govern
ltudent behavinrt However,
there has been a change es-
pecially in the visiting hours tor
women in men's halls. Most ot
the universities polled allow
women to Visit men’s halls at
least until midnight on Satur—
days. Columbia, which banned
women visitors tor the first 208
years at its existence. now per-
mits open room until midnight
on Fridays and until ! a.m. Sum
lay mornings.

Not one university official in-
tervizwed expressed dissatisiac-
tion with the results of the lib
cruised ruin-although several
laid they had expected serious
trouble, But the number at rule
iniractions has remained con-
stant and low.

The university officials ap-
peared less worried about stu-
dent sexual behavior than about
th- use of narcotics and drugs,
but none said that it was a
serious problem.

Increasingly the attitude is
that of discretion, rather than
rigid morality, governing SBX<
ual behavior. Said the Yale
dean of undergraduate affairs,
“Don’t think we are trying to
protect the honor of young men
Ind women. It's ridiculous to
think you can." The assistant
dean for residence halls at Cora
hell, where junior and senior
Women have virtually no curfew,
said, “We don't ask what they

do and don’t want to know."

The availability of oft-camp-
us housing is considered more
important than rules in deter-
mining the undergraduates’ siti-
tLtde towards sex, At N.Y.U..
Columbia, Fordham, and Conlell
many students live oft-camp-
us where officials do not en-
iorce visiting hours. Last year
in a poll taken of a quarter
of Columbia's students who
lived olfacampus tour out of ﬁve
said the main reason was dissat<
istactlon with women’s hours in
the dormitories.

Grinnell Girls Find Sensitive Work
In Class for Mentally Retarded

by Anne Farrer

On Sunday mornings six Grin-
nell coeds meet at the Cnm<
munity Center as it becomes a
child's world oI crayons, paste
pots, bright pictures and Bible
stories with small words and
big printt Fingers tumble to
get at pennies in knotted handa

kerchiets and young voices
sing lustily and oil-key as their
possessors encounter with wide-
,eyed innocence the ways of
God, man and their Sunday
school teachers. But the usual
sunny implications are lacking.
[or in this class the children
are fifteen and sixteen years
old.

Dealing with this chlld’s world
of the mentally retarded new
essitates a great deal of sensi-
tivity on the part of the volun-
teers irnrn the Congregational
Church and the college (Kaye
Handrurd, Helen Brown, Nancy
Steinson, Evelyn Sugawa, Susie
Schaeter, and Cindy Peterson).
This sensitivity is not the sort
that is cultivated to meet spe-
cific situations but naturally
grow. trom interaction with
then affectionate young girls

who are so taken with bright
colors and hair bows,

However, manipulation or
this sympathy is a delicate mat-
ter. Sometimes needs are met
successiuily. sometimes not so
successiully. The typical make
and do aspecl or a Sunday
school class assumes new signi-
ficance during a Valentine cre-
ating Session, “which friends
are you going to give your Val-
entine to, Debby?" inquires the
volunteer. “i don’t have any
friends,” she replies. And they
see her loneliness, try to un-
derstand and help, then return
to the red paper and scissored
designs

Although the girls can read.
presentation of Bible stories
may be ditticult, especially
when the King James version,
uniortunately, is utilized.

Discussion of Christlan mis-
rionary activity may be coma
plicated, for as the children
have a ready understanding or
crocodiles and jungle adven-
tures, they lack the ability to
comprehend the necessity or
missionaries in these exciting
dark green places.

in protusional vocabulary,
these girls are "trainiblc." Do-

spite the cold overtones at the
term, the girls give positive
evidence of this process in
their consideration for their
teachers and their hungry de—
sire to earn love and aifectitm
from them. And their situation
seems less sad when they are
singing with gusto and gestures
one or their rsvorite songs:

"This Little Light or Mine."—
This little light or mine
I'm going to make it shine
I’m going to make it shine
All the time. all the time
Don’t you go and pttt it out
I'm going to let it shine
Don't you go and pin it out
I'm going to let it shine
Let it shine, all the time, let

it shine . , .
