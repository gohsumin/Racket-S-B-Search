LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Freshman Describes Chicago Arrest

(The iotlowing letter was
written at the request of the
Sim editor.)

To the Editor:

On Thursday. Oct. 9, 1965, I
began my crinriiial lite. On
that day, tho Chicago police ar—
rested me, gave me a ride in
a paddy wagon, sent me to a
Juvenile home, and tor-ced are
to return to Griunell.

Bciore describing my arrest,
I'll explain why I was in Chia
eago. As most students pi‘obnr
bly know by now, 505 called
itor massive anti—war and anti.
Conspiracy trial demonstra—
tions from Oct. 8-11. I drove
to Chicago with 9 other Grin—
ucll students to observe what
would happen and to partici—
pate in what I hoped would be
peacetul demonstration.

We reached Chicago at about
2 o’clock Thursday morning,
and went to the church where
our group had been instructed
to report to by the militant
Weatherman faction oi 5135.
(Although we wanted to‘pani-
cipate in some activities at
RYM-II, the more peaceinl tac—
tion oi SDS, they had sent us
no intormation.) We then de-
oidcd to go to McCormick Semi—
nary, where all-night discus—
sions were supposedly being
held. The discussions were re—
portedly about the signiiicance
pt that night’s street fighting
between a tow hundred Weath~
orinen and the Chicago cops;
itew tactics were also supposed
to he discussed at McCormick.

When we reached McCor—
mick. we found approximately
100 Weathermen in the gym—
nasium; there were no organ-
ized discussions. Finally, aitcr
about thirty minutes, a Weath—
el'man who had been in the
street ﬁghting came over and
explained to us what had hap-
pened. Ills explanation evolved
into a discussion, then an argue
ment, between a couple other
Weathermen and our group
about ideologies and tactics,
This was the closest I ever
came to any lighting in Cni-
cago; it I had to take sides, 1
would have fought against the
Weathermen.

At six in the morning we all
wcnt to slecp. The women were
supposed to get up at 7:30 to
participate in a raid on an
Army induction center, to des—
troy the ccntcr and the per.
sonnel. The Grinnell women dc—
cidcd not to participate, so we
slept iiirtii almost 9 am. At

Question of the Week: Will
whoever washed hit the
gratitti in the Forum john
put it back when parents go?

that tiiiic, a Weatherman asked
for someone with a car to run
an errand One at the Crmncll
students. Chuck Garnian, vol-
untcercd, not thinking that any
harm could result. Another of
our group, whom I will call
Bill, was going to help him iind
his way, and I went along be-
cause I wanted to get out o!
the gym.

We were supposed to bring
ii bullhorn to the wnmen's rally
in Grant Park. and then buy
another bullhorn at a radio
store. Ttie women didn’t want
the bullhorn, but we headed
for the store anyway, 0n the
way to the store, just west at
the Loop, some cops signalled
us to pull over to the side of
the street.

Chuck stopped, and the cops
told him his brakelights were
iaulty, Since chuck was not
ircm Illinois, he had to go to
the station to post bond. At
the station. Chuck and Bill
went inside while I stayed in
the car, One oi the cops start-
ed searching the car and asking
me questions. When he looked
at the windshield visor. he
found a mace pack. and told me
I'd have to go inside.

Chuck told the cop that his
tather, a policeman, had given
him the mace tor protection
when he was hitchhiking, and
he had forgotten it was in the
car. at course. the cop didn’t
believe him; he knew Chuck
had brought the mace to use
against the Chicago pigs. though
he (the cop) never admitted
this. The cop asked me how
old I was; I‘sa‘id 17. He asked
it my parents knew I was in
Chicago; I said no.

Attcr a few minutes, the cop
took us upstairs and began ltll-
log out arrest torms. Chuck was
charged with the traitic viola.
tion and possessing mace (a
deadly weapon); bill was
charged with disorderly con-
duct; and l was arrested as a
runaway. They said it was
standard procedure to arrest
passengers in the car tor dis-
orderly conduct, even though
Bill had been in no way disor—
dcrly. They called me a run—
away bccause I was a minor
iii Chicago without written
parental permission,

During this time, the cops
had found more “goadles” m
the ear and were taking pic.
turcs of cvcrything. When they
found a plastic gun, the cops
were delighted, since they
thought Chuck could be sent to
jail tor possessing it. But they
soon admitted it could he used
tor shooting bubbles. They were
disappointed, I‘m sure.

The juvenile authority soon
came to take 'rnc to his otiice
where he tilled out more forms,
Hi: also lectured me extensive»
ly, and told me to go to school,
their he active in the world. I
think he tinally believed that
I hadn't. come to Chicago to
destroy the city. and we got
along tairly well for a while.
But when he asked me it I had
had any sexual relations with
either of my two companions,
I again decided he was a has-
tard He said, ct course, that
he was only concerned about
the moral implications for inc.
not the icgal implications tor
Chuck and bill.

At about oncthirty, I was
led to a paddy wagon and giv—
en a private ride to the Andy
Juvcnilc lloiuc, about 10 min.
utcs irom the station, oiic oi
the caps that took me there
was interesting, because he
thought it has ridiculous that
a college student was callcd a
runaway, The people who ada
niittcd inc to the Andy home
teit the same way, as did I.

I was admitted to the home;
the social worker called my
mother, who was upset and

gave permission for him to
send me right back to Grin—
nell, instead at to my home
town. Since the next bus to
Iowa lett at 7:30 pm, I had to
stay at the home for about 5
hours.

Atter being admitted, I on-
tercd a room with about 15
other girls. The woman in
charge searched inc, and made
me take a bath and wash my
hair, to ”dc-contaminate" me.
They aim made me wash my
underpants, and gave me a new
pair with the words “Andy
Home” on them. I’m keeping
these underpants as a souvenir.

Until seven o’clock, i sat in
the small room with the other
girls (I was teeling something
like Arlo on the Group
bench), talked, and watched
TV, I wanted to study my
Aeschylus, but we weren't :11-
lowcd to d. Aeschylus is too
dangerous, 1 gucss. Many of the
girls there were runaways
(real ones), and most had been
there before. All were supposed
to go to court, cxccpt inc, The
room I was in was tor short;
term cases waiting ior court.

The longteriu cases (a low
months) were in another part
oi the building.

At seven a policeman and
policewoman took me to the
bus station in a car. I had to
buy my own ticket; ii I hadn’t;
had the money, thcy would
have waited tor money from
home. The cops waited until I
was on the bus back to Grin—
nell. which I reached Friday
morning.

Compared to the other Crin-
nell students arrested, I am the
luckiest, since 1 don’t iace any
fines, and I only have a juver
nile record, which won’t hurt
me later. But the reason I was
arrested, and the charge
against me are appalling. It
irightcns me to know that any.
one con be arrested [or no good
reason. merely because the
cops don't want him where he
is. I was obviously not a true
runaway, yet ttrc law declared
me one. I asked the juvenile
authority what would happen
it my mothcr said it was alright
ioi- me to he in Chicago. He
said they would probably
churgc her with negligence.
Everyone talks about the risks
at our s cicty becoming a
police state. But this should

make it clear that the police
already have more power over
an individual than one's par
ents do. The fact that I was
truly a political prisoner for
a few hours, the tact that I was
torced out of Chicago for no
valid reason. and the tact that
Chuck and Bill were also hr»
rested for ridiculous reasons,
are much more significant for
me than the other occurrences
of that day.

I‘m glad I went to Chicago.
In a few hours, I learned about
Weatherman. about the police,
and about myselt. I would have
liked to have stayed and
learned more.

N ser's Views
To The

My sununai_, drawing ot im-
plications, and criticism ot lylr.
Nasser’s (Alan G. Nasser, Ina
structor in Philosophy) cont-
inents hi Roberts last Wednes
day:

His basic point was: your
values are where your actions
are In a situation involving a
clash of values, the decision
reached reveals ane’s more im-
portant value, eg. academic aua
tonomy vs. opposition to the
war in a rccont taculty referen-
duin, In two separate situations,
e.g , the drug statement, and the
faculty decision to not call ott
classes, the relative rcsponse
from the students revealed
which issue was more important
kthe one that rated a South
Lounge confrontation.

Two further points were that
in the U.S., institutions have 0-
litical power. not individuas;
and that it is power. not reason,
which altcrs political decisions.
These points imply to me that
the time for selicentered oppo-
sition has long passed (candlelit
parades). We should use our
potter to convince instttitﬁolis
lchurchcs, lodgcs, the VFW,
PTA, NFO. etc.) to act against
this war. The Chicago Conven-
tion could have showed us how
much power students hate. and
how much pouer institutions
have.

the premise that action, not
words reveals on s licirurcliy
at v iics, though coiitestiblc,
(Ibsen/CS than it 1))! (inimcll
students. As in duals are our
actions reflections of what “6
value must?

That premise is an over sim-

rro. Fle

litication. however. Action ll
'ased on more than values: it
is based on knowledge. The Mor-
atorium was very well advers
tised. not so the taculty decision.
Also a clash or values is between
sets of values or at best between
a set_ and a single value. In in
decision to not otticially close
Grlnnell. the faculty valued not
only “academic autonomy". but
also, “that such an action is
useless,“ “that. being radical is
financially harmful,” etc, While
alone none‘of these may have
been more important than "wit
should take this action to pro-
test the war," their sum total was
indeed more important. And we.
the students talking, but took
no action _ and so did not care?

Liberaied Women

To The Editor:

Consider the woman's role on
Grmnell‘s campus, Consider the
tact that all taculty participants
in the moratorium discussions
were men, that all but two or
Saturday's panelists are men.
that our SGA president is a
man and has been all four years
since I‘ve been here. that most
loaders and movers ot organiza-
tions are men, that those who
have the greatest power to make
decisions. tram the administra—
tion on doivn, are men. that
those who instituted, pick, and
install homecoming queens are
men and that tar irom being a
matter oi concern on this super-
liberal campus, not even a gasp
oi dismay has been heard,

There are some temale has.
tions however: WRA, AWS. and
in the past, homecoming queens.
We also have an ever-blooming
role as secretaries, errand-run.
ners, and spectator-supporters.
Dig the contrast and see if you
lind it appealing. If so, i hope
you don't have any dreams or
illusions ot independence, be.
