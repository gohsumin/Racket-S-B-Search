Pornography Topic
Of tackliori‘ Talk

Professor William Lockhart,
Dean oi the University oi Minne—
sota’s Law School, addressed the
Gl'innell PrenLaw Club October 19,
on the subject of ”Pornography
and the Law."

After a special dinner attended
by club members, Locknart spoke
in the Forum’s South Lounge on

thle problem or censorship oi the
obsCEne and how the Supreme
Court has coped with the issue
in the past twelve years.

Obscenity and Sex

Lockhart emphasized that ob-
scenity and sex are not the same
and that “sex affects all man-
kind.“ Many problems have been
inflicted upon society because
man has groped in the dark be.
cause of sex taboos, according to
Lockhart. These taboos are being
challenged by law "where the ex-
act subject matter makes freedom
of expression essential."

Lockhart rirmly adheres to the
belief that a democratic society
must be free to pet-lect itself. in
light oi legal approval or Lady
Chatterly’s Lover in movie torm
in 1959, he emphasized that there
is a “constitutional right to advo—
cate adultery under certain cir-
cumstances.”

Protected from Nudism

Nevertheless, Lockllarl still
maintains that society should be
protected from “nudism to parade
on the streets of Grinnell” or
"tree love advocation on campus"
or even signboards advocating
sexual intercourse.

However, there is nothing wrong,
according to him, with reading
about such things, because an in
dividual does not have to read
anything—it is simply his privi-
lege to do so.

He adds, "There are all kinds of
stimuli in our society which stim-
ulate sex desires.” He then men-
tioned a past study conducted on
a large coeducational campus on
which the women were asked what
the greatest sexual stimulant was
The general reply was simply
“mend" Thus, Lockhart believes
that one cannot eliminate sex lrom
the world. it is ‘a part of society
—a part of life."

Leggett went on to say, “What
it comes down to is that neither

rights of students are ooniused
