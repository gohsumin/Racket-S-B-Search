'; The 5813 has been reminded by Building and
Grounds that the students are again busy making paths
here and there across the green expanses of the campus.
Although we would be the first to grant, along with
Student voices, that “the sidewalks are in the wrong
place,” it seems that thoughtful students could do
away with some of the short cuts across new grass
areas. Spring is a pleasant time of year here # students
should be able to take a little extra time to make it
pleasant for B&G as well as for themselves.

Baffled Board?

The “integrated" living situation on South Campus
has been very well planned and handled by the AWS
Board. Every possible effort is being made to make
Main and Mears, formerly freshmen dorms, invi rig to
upperclass residents. With room-drawings, just two
weeks away, the Board is now busy choosing Baffle—
board officers for each dorm floor in the quad. Some-
times, it seems, baffleboard members apply for rea
sons of gaining prestige, getting early choice of rooms,
or acquiring a stepping stone toward next years AWS
Board candidacy. The AWS Board seems vitally inter-
ested in making its dorm system work. The choice of
baffleboard members and their subsequent position in
the hall will undoubtedly emerge more important than
ever. Placing freshmen in all the dorms, and the theory
behind it, necessitated a new type of community living
in the quad. Without being policemen or full-time
advice counselors, the baffleboard members will have
an active part in creating and maintaining community.
This should certainly be considered in the already
difficult job of choosing the best people for the posi-
tion.

l Spoilers at the Polls

Six percent of the students who voted in the
Mock Election had their ballots spoiled because of their
misuse of the voting machines. The PPPE had repre-
sentatives present at all times to explain the machines
in order to avoid just such an event. It looks like getting
people out to vote is not the only problem at the polls
-—one should also be sure that they pay enough atten-
tion so that they know what they are doing. Spoiling
a ballot through carelessness doesn't say much for the
privilege to vote.

Time Goes By

It is ironic that Grinnell students, who are eternal-
ly desperate for time. will find themselves losing one
hour this week-end. The thought has already spread
panic among several paper-writers and exam takers.
The only pleasant thought right now about going on
daylight savings time, is that next October we will all
gain an hour when things get back to normal.

To the Editor:

We are accustomed to speak—
ing about different "genera
tions" of college Students which
are believed to have a more or

less unique identity. The appel-
lations “angty”, “lost”, and
“complacent” have been used
to describe some of these gen-
erations. Realizing the hazards
of generalization, we may still
profit from an attempt to fit
the contemporary generation
of college students into this
same framework.

The frequency with which
they use the Word "meaning
ful" offers us me best clue to
an identity for these young peo-
ple. The very use of the word
“meaningful" suggests the are
istence of something which is
“meaning—less.’ Inherent in
such a View are attitudes of
examination, skepticism, and
experimentation — all qualities
ascribed to this particular gen-
oration.

 

Philosophers, sociologists and
psychologists have launched a
massive criticism of contemr
porary middle class suburban
values. The essence of their
objections has been that mid—
dle class society has wed itself
to the spiritually sterile values
of chronic status consciousness
and excessive concern for ma-
terial well-being.

It is against this background
that the current college group
should be set in order to under
stand their preoccupation with
meaningful existence. For bet
ter or for worse, most of this
generation cannot value relig-
ion highly enough to find in it a
convincing scheme of life val-
ues. At the Same time. both the
absence of sound values in so-
ciety at large, and‘the psycho~
logically crippling effects of
that absence of meaning have
been made woefully apparent.

What has resulted is a gener-
ation which deeply impressed
With the need to find meaning

in life. Two cults have devel<
oped to fill the value vacuum.
One would make love the ulti-
mate value in life. The Bible of
this cult is Fromm's The Art
of Loving. ‘

The other cult views life as
merely a stream of unordered
accidents. To be alive is to be
in the state of experiencing
things, hence sheer experience
becomes an end in itself.

The highly publicized sexual
experimentation of the contem-
porary college group may per-
hapS be more clearly under-
stood if we consider the twin
values of love for love’s sake
and experience as an end in it-
self.

While it is too early to assess
the workability of these Values,
it is possible to note that psy-
chological needs, as well as
biological drives, must be tak-
en into account for an explana<
[ion of what appears to he
moral laxity.

By VINCE ANKU

Ghana’s government has no
interest in either ruthless com-

munism or moribund capital»
ism. She is pursuing her own
independent course; yet Nkru-
mah has been accused of being
a Communist running a Soviet
satellite. This accusation is not
only a monstrous distortion of
truth, but also shows a gross
ignorance of what Communism
really is. I believe that the
Russian, Chinese, or Cuban
brand of Communism is bound
to fail in Ghana. In Ghana, over
ninety per cent of the people
are land owners who would rcr
act violently to any attempt by
the government to collecthlze
their land or any personal prop-
erty. The government would
have to imprison or liquidate
the land owners in order to col-
lectivize all the agricultural
land.

Moreover. many prominent
government officials and their

 

close relatives are also land
owners. The government’s aim
is to help the people live a bet-
ter life, and so it cannot pmr
vide the good life on the blood
of the majority of the people.
it would be stupid to attempt
to collectivize tropical cocoa
growing forests where adequate
supervision of workers is im-
possible. Without collectiviza-
lion, Ghana farmers still pro-
duce more than a third of the
world's cocoa. For these rea
sons the government is making
no effort to “collectiVlze for
the sake of collectivization,"
which seems to be the case in
some communist countries.
Just as Communism would
be detrimental to Ghana, so
would the American form of
capitalism prove disastrous to
her. Ghana's government needs
a great deal of money. The
people are quite reluctant to
pay taxes, and voluntary con-
tributions have only recently

Anku: Ghana Pursues Own Course

come into prominence. Thus,
Ghana must plan her economy
very thoroughly. She strongly
feels that the somewhat
efficient capitalistic System is
not the quickest way to the bet-
ter future. Ghana blends West-
ern and Eastern economic
theories with her own expel’h
ence. Though Ghana perhaps

borrows much from Marx and
Lenin, this is not a sufficient
ground on which to label Ghana
a Communist satellite. This will
become apparent In the later
articles.

Ghana is building an anal:
getlc country based on the
principles of African Socialism.
This is a social, political, and
economic System permeated
by belief in God and thus in the
dignity of the individual man,
Ghanians believe that African
Socialism will provide the
greatest economic progress
while reasserting the tradition-
al cooperative values of Afri-
can life.

In April 1961, Nkrumah made
the following statement in the
New York Times:

“The aim of the party is to
build a socialist State in which
the free development of each
sector is a condition for the free
development of the other sec-
tors of society. This is conson-
ant with African situations,
conditions, and Circumstances.”

Mr. Nkrumah has said time
and time again that private in-
vestment, elther domestic or
loreign, and state ownership
can coexist in Ghana. This is
one of the features of "African
socialism.” It is based not on
the concept of class struggle,
but on traditional cooperative
principles in which private
ownership plays a Vigorous
part in the society. This deft
nitely is not Communism.
