Forell discusses iwo religious concepts of time 1

Dr. George Fol'ell. protcssor ot
Protestant theology at the state
University ot' lowa School of
Religion, spoke last Thursday on
"Time and Decision" He con-
cerned himselt mainly with a
discussion ot two opposing views
ot time. relating them to the
Christian faith.

Torelt began by considering
the- l\\'o concepts Ol- time: the
linear view and the cosmic or
cyclic view, According to the
latter, he explained, time seems
to repeat itseli’ continuously so
that anything done my be un-
done in the next cycle. This
view is held by most non-west
ern religions, he noted.

blore iamiliar to us is the
linear view, whi h holds that
time is irreversible and even
progressive and evolutionary.
oiir evidence, said Forell,
seems to support the linear
vicw, tor iroin all that man
knows by experience limited
as his experience may he, time
is not reversible.

ed that Coniucious and Buddha
are both relatively incidental
to thc religions bearing their
names. Christians, on the other
hand, are very much concerned
with the historical Christ.

Christianity, Fore-ll said, is the
historical religion; it is centered
on events rather than ideas. He
used the Apostles creed as an
example. It cites the events of
Jesus‘ life but omits all his
teachings. Forell used a quota-
tion from Altl'ed North White-
head to demonstrate his point:ll
"Christianity is a religion seek i
ing a metaphysic; Buddhism is
a metaphysic generating a roll
