MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 21
IACP) — Social regulations and
the philosophy behind them are
one target of the student power
movement, and some changes
can be attributed in part to the
activists, but others have wmex
solely by administrative decree
in recognition of the temper of
the times.

A freshman coed at a Minne-
sota college was required to
move into a dormitory even
though her home was a block
from the campus. _

At Texas Technological Unl-
versity, Lubbock, 34 male stu-
dents took to the courts to tight
a rule requiring them to live
on campus.

President Wilson H. Elkins
oi the University of Maryland
put his foot down on a recom-
mendation to close doors of stu-
dent rooms during legal visita-
tlons, saying the recommend-
ation “put sex overtones" on
coeducational activity.

Debate over open houses and
open doors is nothing new: it
has been several years now since
the Well - publicized case of the
male dorm resident at Yale who,
rebelling against a policy re-
quiring doors during visitation
to be open the width of a book,
substituted matchhooks for teXt<
books.

OPEN HOUSES, DOORS
since then, debate has been
sporadic but oiten intense. This
fall at the University 0! Call-
fornla, Berkeley, Dean oi Stu-
dents Alleigh Williams “extends
oil from two to ten the number
of residence room visits per-
mitted each month by members
of the opposite sex," according

to a Daily California report.

The extension was not greeted
as enthusiastically as might
have been expected, however.

It was coupled with stipula-
tions “that all guests be es-
corted upstairs by their hosts,
and that the doors to rooms oi

all participating students remain
wide open at all times."

The administration View on
open doors inevitably takes into
account the possibility that the
public would view such a policy
as encouragement of licentious-
ness.

CURFEWS CURBED

Michigan State University and
the University of Minnesota re-
cently eliminated curiews for
all dormitory women except
freshmen, who are generally
thought by administrators to re-
quire a period of adjustment be-
tween the assumed regulations
of home and the complete trees
dom of a no-hours policy.

Western Michigan University,
Kalamazoo, extended dorm ci05<
ing to 2 a.m. ior juniors and
seniors and began a senior wo-
men's hall with no hour restric-
tions. But despite the improve-
ment over the old system, the
Western Herald wasn’t satisfied.

The newspaper urged the uni<

varsity to follow Michigan
State's example.

Hours for senior women at
Wartburg College, Waverly, 1a.,
were liberalized by the lnitlation
of a key system for senior wo-
men but some vestages oi the
old system remained: disciplin<
ary probation (with no appeal)
for lending a key to an ineligi-
ble coed and a stiff $25 penalty
for losing the key.

Still other schools are pushing
for change.

At the University of North
Carolina, a referendum last
spring showed, the Daily "rot-
Heel said, that “a majority of
coeds here favor extension of
closing hours, elimination 0!
closing hours for seniors, libera
alization of the overnight sign-
out system [or girls who have
blanket parental permission,
and the option to live in off-
campus housing for coeds who
are either seniors or 21 years
old."

The Tar Heel suggested that

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular,

And that can be an advantage. m

How? Well, for one thing, you‘ve got more going for'

n Come to work for this giant and you‘ll begin to think,
like one. .

Because you‘re dealing with bigger problems, the
consequences, ofcourse, will be greater. Your responsibilities
heavier. That means your experience must b: better—morn

SEX OFF CAMPUS

A target at still other schools,
among them South Dakota State
University and North Texas
State University, is a policy pro-
hibiting students in oil-campus
apartments from having visitors
of the opposite sex.

And then there’s the question
of whether students should be
allowed to live in apartments
at all. Until recently, coeds at
the University of North Cares
lina were not permitted to [we
in apartments. NDW, Senior wo-
meo have that privilege.

PERMlSSION GRANTED

When students at Texas Tech
were denied permission to regis<
ter this fall because they were
not residents in the campus
housing, the University Daily
reported that they ﬁled an in-
junction against the university,
Claiming financial inability to
live in dormitories.

And alter Weeks of arbitra-
tion, the students succeeded in
getting a appeals system es-
tablished to consider such cases
and grant permission to live or:
campus in» some instances. .

“Much more is involved," the
Daily commented, “than the
right of students to live nit
campus this fall, as both side!
of the suit realize.”

“The case is one of nation
wide precedence and impor-
tance, affecting apartment owns
ers, school administrators and
bond holders in every city in
the nation with a college or
university campus."

BIBLE MORALS AT V. U.

At the Valparaiso Congress.
during which the students were
surprised by the announcement
that curiews for Senior women
would soon be abolished, Dean
of Students Luther Koepke ex-
plained the philosophy underly-
ing rules at Valparaiso.

Three kinds oi rules are em
forced, xoeploe said: “moral
rules from the Bible or from
God (teaching students Chris-
tian ethics is a v.u. objective).
civil rules which must be obeyed
as the edicts of authority, and
social rules enforced to lnsm
orderly living conditions.”
