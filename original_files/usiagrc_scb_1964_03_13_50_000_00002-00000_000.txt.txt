Quad Expectations

There is probably no more suspenseful moment in
the Quad year than the night of the AWS formal din-
ner, when the lights suddenly go on and the new board
members stand to be recognized. Wednesday night was
a night of excitement, glory, and expectation. The ex-
citement has dwindled—hall celebrations and room
decorations for the winners have run their course, The
glory will soon be gone—when those all night meetings
begin. The expectation, however, must remain. The
women of the quad have elected their leaders and they
expect something from them. Next year might see some
definite moves made in the field of integrated dorms.
The new house presidents should have definite opinions
in this area and should enlighten themselves on the
problems and possibilities involved in such a process.
Campus opinion demands increased leadership in
Women’s positions, especially in the senate. Much of

the hall tenor influencing

depend on the hall president. The questions of responsi-
ble leadership in rule enforcement and policy creation
must be answered by a positive board which has both
direction and aim. This year’s AWS board has had ex-
cellent direction, has often illustrated positive action,
and has operated with the interests of the quad women
at heart. We see another bright year on the AWS hori-
zon. The excitement and glory may soon be oven The
hard, often thankless work is just beginning. But are

pectations are high,

Goldberg Favors House Civil Rights Bill;
Supports Senate Attempts for Cloture

To the Editor:

The Civil Rights Bill which
was passed by the House of
Representatives a little more
than a month ago will soon be
considered by the Senate. This
essential piece oi legislation
Contams provisions to make
into enforctble law the constlr
tulional rights of all peoples to
vote in federal elections, to
have'lree access to public ac-
commodations, to attend inte
grated schools, and to take ad
vantage of equal employment

opportunities under iederal con».
tracts and in the federal govern-l

menu.

A block oi eighteen Southern
Senators is prepared to iilibus-
ter in an effort to kill the bill,
or to force eventual compro~
mise on its most important
provisions, it is likely that this
filibuster Will be allowed to Con-
tinue for several Weeks to satr
isiy those who are in favor of
the bill, but have strong teela
ings favoring unlimited debate.

[At this time there will still be

 

three votes lacking or the two
thirds majority necessary in in
voke cloture oi debate.

or our Senators from lowa,
Senator John Miller (R.) is to
be congratulated for his decis-
ion to vote for clorure, while
Senator Bourke B. Hickenloop-
er in.) has not yet reached a‘
decision. Senator Hickenlooper
has come out In iavor of civil

righis legislation, including pub-ione_ The large veins immedy

lic accommodations provis-
ions, and has voted for cloiure
of debate in the past, when the
Telstar Communications Sat:
ellile Bill was beiore the Sen-i
ate in 1962. His voie for cloture
on the Civil Rights Bill this
spring IS crucial.

Senator Hickenlooper and oiha
er senators as yet undecided:
should be urged, by letter and'
by telegram, to casr their votes‘
for cloture of debate, and for a,
comprehensive and meaningiull
Civil Rights Bill, '

Letters to the Editor
. Student for Creativity ‘Over the Analytical at Grinnell ,

To the Editor:

At Grinnell, a destructive at-
tempt at a uniform approach
to life is apparent even, or
especially, in the iritellectual
approach altered to us mental-
ly gifted children; these intel-
lectual restrictions are more
profound than the social ones.
America has grown with the
scientific attitude as a tame
lizer; in that tradition, when
we come to Grinnell, we are
taught to objectify and analyze
everything. We seek in empir-
ical facts and precise logical
proofs a resting place for our
ambivalent belleis in the na-
lure of man and or good and
evili I

We also learn to objectify or-
der and learn to respond posi-
tively to it. We try to deﬁne
our primary terms and outline
principles of ordering. We find
almost everything can be ex-
plained in some way or has

some order. We then come to
see meaning—in all its senses,
scientific. esthetic, and ethic
#as a real fact of the World,
but not as true or false; the
multiplicity of orders makes
everything seem equally insig-
nificant,

We see the apparent dichot-
omy between the order of the
world and the things in the
world. The things are of them»
selves utterly meaningless,
while the naked order stands
shivering, a hollow oiispring
of the human mind. Man, we
then must conclude, has no ulr
timate, objectively truthful na~
ture, for the external world
does not really exist as he sees
it, and the order of his mind
describes nothing but iancy.
At no point inthis objective ap-
proach to ethical life are any
values even near to being
found; at somelpoint, depend
ing on his persistency and abil-

 

Roberison Comments on Yoga

Explains Effect

To the Editor:

Phil Brown's brief discussion
of Yoga exercise and its basic
rationale 'was interesting. How-
ever, his comments on the an-
atomical and physiological has
is indicates a basic lack of un-
derstanding of the circulatory
system and its functioning. One
gets the impression that be im-
putes to gravity 3 major con-
trol of arterial circulation, if he
were correct in this, mainte<
nance of an erect posture in—
sures that the best oxygen sup»
ply goes to the toes. Actually
the arterial flow is relatively
little aiiecied by gravity, being
dependent on the iorce or the
heart beat, augmented by the
elastic character of the major
arteries adiscent to the heart,
such as the aorta. To assume
that standing in the “head
stand" position gives the heart
“a rest from its usual task”
is not only false but indicative
oi a lack of understanding.
Purely on a gravity basis, he
is saying that it requires more
work oi the heart in pump
blood from the same area to
the legs when the body posr
tion is reversed, to say nothing:
oi the supply to the viscera. ‘

The major effect of a headl
stand on the circulation is onl
the return of Venous blood (0'
the heart from the head, and
that effect is not a beneficxali

on Circulation

that return path are devoid of
valves, as are some of their
main tributaries. Others, such
as the internal jugulars, have
very ineffective valvesi Thus a
prolonged headstand wo uld
tend to result in stagnation of
venous blood rather than in a
better oxygen supply to the
brain, Accumulation of carbon
dioxide as a result of this will
stimulate breathing rate and
also bring about increased
rather than decreased, labor
for the heart.

Possibly the psychological
effects of the exercise are use-
ful in helping the individual
reach a state in which he is
more amendable to the philos~
Dpy or Yoga. Perhaps the Con-
trolled posturing has value as
exercise for muscle systems.
The lack of understanding of
the structure and functioning of
involved parts of the Circular
tory system is disturbing.

George M. Robertson

lty, every student who uses this
approach must quit in failure.

Although some never begin
this approach to ethics, since
they are satisfied that man is
evil and needs to be restricted
and since the objectivecrdered
approach reflects their restrict-
ed society, those who do are
left deeply dissatisfied. They
revolted in the first place trend
the stereotyped imageiof evil
man that the social restrictions
or any society imply, but they
could discover no alternative.
These people must then reluc-
tantly accept the resuiciive
middle class American Values
(Grinnell’s), or allow common
passions and semi-conscious
bellefs to dominate, or aim-
lessly revolt against the order
and restrictions of society.
This is the cause of "diven
gent” behavior; hence, the
negative attitude./

Students can learn that the
analytical method — which is
Grinnell's Way of lifevis no!
the only way. Someone can
demonstrate that a novel is not
a point in a literary history and
that philosophy need not be a
study of alternative beliefs.

Art and philosophy are cre<
alive disciplines, which strive
for beauty and truth. If these
are not empty terms, if values
can be found and not acquired,
then the creative approach to
life is proper, Can we ever ac-
cept that the apparent dicho-
tomy between things and the
mind is only the dichotomy be-
tween order and creative order,
or no real dichotomy at all?
Creativity (which must operaro
underground at Grinnell) at
least allows us choice in our
decisions — in step beyond logi-
cal limitations.
