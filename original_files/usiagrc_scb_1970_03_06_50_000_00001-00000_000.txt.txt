Bauhaus and Brechi‘ Fea’rure
Finish ofWeimar Symposium

A lecture about Walter Gropiu »
the architect, a presentation 0
selections iroin the writings oi
Bertholt Brecht, and a series of
films completed the Symposium
on Weimar Culture.

Protessor Marcel Franciscono
of the University of Illinois spoke
about “Walter Gropius and the
Founding of the Bauhaus,” The
Bauhaus was an expressionist
guild founded after World War
I with the intention of making
visual art an instrument of social
regeneration. Gropius did not
incorporate any radical changes
into his buildings, ior he thought
that art was above utilitarian
constructions oi any kind, He
Viewed art as a sort of “back-
wardrlooking, craftroriented
expressionism." Gropius created
very little in concrete terms, but
his vision has affected all lorms
of art expression ever since.

Selections of the different kinds
of things that Bertholt Brecht
wrote during his career were
presented' in the arena theate. oy'
Robert lngham and a group’ of
actors, This included selections
from Brecht‘s poems and from
two oi his plays, one the
Caucasian Chalk Circle, the other
the balcony scene irom a lustful
and socially instructive re-
working of Shakespeare‘s Romeo
and Juliet which Brecht never
completed.

After the periormance, Mr.
lngham lectured brieﬂy about
Brecht’s career. The writings of
Karl Marx, which he became
acquainted with early, appear to
have inﬂuenced his dramatic
works. Brecht took as his ﬁrst
principle oitheater that it should

instruct the audience about social
change. He thereiorc

At the meeting of the faculty
last Monday afternoon, it was
voted to recommend to the board
of trustees of the college that the

requirements for the positions of.

chairman oi the lsducationalll
Policies Committee, division
chairman, and chairman of the
faculty be lowered, The chair
manship requirements were
voted as three separate motions
in the above order, and passed
with ever-narrowing margins,
the last, iaculty chairman, by a
vote of only 38 to 31.

It the trustees accept the
taculty recommendation,
assistant pi-oiessors will be
eligible for divusional chairman-
ships and chairmanship or the
Educational Policies Committee
and associate professors with

chairmanship.

Mr. Betts announced that a

Loewi would like to see the

Yugoslav Government Revokes
Passport on Rosenfield Lecturer.

By The Editors

Milovan Djilas, Yugoslav
author and philosopher and
iormer Communist Party chiei
under Tito, was scheduled to
present this year's Roseni‘leld
Lectures on Sunday, March a
through Wednesday, March 11.
On Tuesday of this week the
Yugoslavian government seized
his passport and he is unable to

leave the country.

lllC Yugoslav government [or his

criticism of their refusal to
condemn the Soviet invasion of
Hungary in 1956 In 1962 he was
once again arrested' for
publishing a book based on his
association with Stalin.

Djilas has written numerous
books. including poetry, novels,
and short Stories. In 1968, after
his last prison sentence had been
commuted, he spent a year as
a guest lecturer at Princeton
University.

campus and dispense items such
as birth control pills. He also
strongly favors the establishment
of a ”Crisis center” for drug
users, “If that center helped five
students a year, it would be
Worthwhile.”

Loewi asserts that the faculty
student ratio is Grinnell’s main
strength. As {or academic im
provements, he is hopeful that
the committees on graduation re-
quirements, grading, and the
freshman year will have some
strong proposals. or student-
initiated academic changes, he
said: “The administration and
faculty are going to be impressed
with a proposal that’s well-
researched, weilrdeveloped. 1
think the lacts are in out favor.
Our education here is definitely
Out-dated. I think Phil Mears was
right to mention that there are
more students on academic
probation now than ever before."

Loewi had the iollowing to say
about the student body in
general: ”l think they are
strongly interested in getting
something concrete done beiore
they get out of school. They
showed this in the mass meetings
on the position paper. It is now
up to the leaders to get the
students activated. "

As for his immediate plans,
Loewi stated: “Right now I’m
looking for qualified people to iiil
the positions of student coordinar
tor, student auditor, and social
coordinator. l'm going to iind out
who would be good ior the Senate
and the house president positions
and urge them to run.”

The students appear to have
reacted quite positively to
Loewi’s program of specific
positive action. Mears. the other
“activist" candidate. received
the second highest number of
votes. “Jim Panzee", whose
campaign was predicated on the
idea that student government is
and always will be a iarce,
met with extreme diffidence at
the polls, failing to garner even
to per cent of the vote.
