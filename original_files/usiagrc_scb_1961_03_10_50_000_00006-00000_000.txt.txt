Talbot View: Doctrine} Effects

By Judith Talbnt
When President Monroe sent

his annual message to Congress‘

in Dec, includcd
lilmuus Tolerance to
America: ~The occasion
been judged proper for
ing as a principle in which the
rights and interests at the US
are involved that the American
continents are hencei ~th
not to be considered as subjects
for iuture colonization by any
European power . . . we should
consider any attempt on their
part to extend their system to
any portion or this hemisphere
as dangerous to our peace and
satety . . . "

Thc Monroe Doctrine was a
statement prompted by concern
ior the security at the US, not
by concern for the fate oi the
newly independent Latin Ameri—
can countries; the statement
was directed at European, not
,at Latin American ears. The
US would be much saier with
small independent nations as
neighbors than with large
European colonies. Following
the proclamation oi the Doc.
trine, the relative "peace and
sa.y in the western hemis-
phere was actually guaranteed
by British control of the seas.

in the 19th century, two im-
portant and lasting attitudes
toward the Monroe Doctrine
evolved in the us. The iirst,
influenced by the moral over—
tones oi the doctrine: the big
brother attitude; the second,
given impetus by the policy
of hegemony and the senti—
ments oi Maniiest Destiny: the
interpretation oi the doctrine
so that it seemed to imply the
right or US intervention
Corollary aiter corollary
(Pulk, Hayes, etc.) demon»
striated the latter inﬂuence.
In Latin America there were

also two general attitudes ios—

tered by us actions and the

Monroe Doctrine. There was a

certain tear of European inter-

vention. which gave rise to an
appreciative altitude, an accept-
ance oi the original statement
of the Doctrine. The other atti—
tude, far stronger, was resent—
ment toward the Colossus oi the

North. Resentment deepened as

each corollary departed iarthcr.

iroin the original statement.

A good example or the con—
tradictory attitudes on both sides
is found in the study oi the
Venezuelan request for arbitra-
tion by the SU in the British
Venezuelan controversy over the
Venezuelan-Guiana border in
1875, Venezuela appealed to the
US to help her in a dispute
with Britain, but she was cer-
tainly also distrustiul or how
Pres. Cleveland might l-eintel‘r
pret the Monroe Doctrinc. Cleve-
land‘s use or the Doctrine in
the case, even though the
British logically proved that due
ing so was stretching the point
way oii base, led directly to
Teddy Roosevelt's corollaries
and the era ol Dollar Diplo—
macy.

Roosevelt's corollaries added
to the Doctrine the right oi the
US to exercise police power in
Latin America to make sure
that debts were paid, govern:
. ments were eiircicnt, that there

no “chronic wrongdoing"
which might “ uirc interven—
tion by some c ilized nation
'and that in_the western hemis—
phere the adhcren e at the Us to
the Monroe Doctrins may iorce
the US , , . to the exei oi

an international police force."

This new announcement was
made for Latin American cars;
such an extension oi President
Monroe’s phrases has since been
proved, notably by the Clark
Rcicreirdum. to bc cntirciy nne
justiiicible. it is signilrcant to
note that even in this lilo<l rme
per-rallstic corollary we rind the
traditional moral overtones
charactcristie of US attitudes
and policy; the phrase “chronic
wrongdoings" . .

Our neighbors to the south
were understandably outraged

by sucha policy and the ln- .

Lalin‘

asserts '

an economic rival

ierence that they were “un-
civilized” did not salve any
‘ wounds. There were numerous
interventions, military and
,- lrnonetary, during the Rouse-
vclt and Tait years.

President Wilson introduced a
new method of intervention by
reiusing to recognize the Huerta
lregime in Mexico. This policy
or de jurc recognition had the
‘unlol'lunate rcsult, in several
linstances, 01 causing the failure
‘of revolutionary governments
‘(unstable) and in Effect pulling
dictators back in power (order-
ly). This sort of intervention
has been typed “intervention by
apathy". A par-ado. is the {act
that Wilson is highly regarded
in most or Latin America.

l Coolidge, Hoover, and their.
,‘Secretartss oi State laid the]
lioundations ior the Good Neigh—
lbor Policy. Many historians be-K
’lleve that Coulidge's appoint
rncnt ot Dwight Morrow as amr
hassador to Mexico was the iirst
big step. However, his Secretary‘
oi State, Hughes, made it clear
lat the Havana Conference in
'1928 that the Monroe Doctrine!
was a unilateral policy. Thel
effort to make it a multr ateral
doctrine had been a major policyl
oi all the Latin American gov-
el‘nmenls.

 

l

Largely as a result oi his I
prcinaugural trip through
Latin America (the first by
a [is President), Hoover took
an active interest in Latin
America and made his Latin
American policy a iar more
conscious one. He withdrew the
Marines irom Nicaragua; the
Clark Memorandum condemn-
ing the Roosevelt corollaries
was published as us policy.

 

' The ciiect or the depression
on USrLatln American relations
was enormous. The economic in.
terdependence oi the two areas
became obvious to all; realiza—
tion oi the need for economic
cooperation played a great part
in the realization that political
cooperation was a must. Finally,
at the Montevideo Conierence in
1933, the Monroe Doctrine was
proclaimed a multilateral policy.
The OAS was born, In 1934 the
Flatt Amendment to the Cuban
constitution was nbroagated; the
US renounced the right to m-
tervene in Central America and
the troops came home irorn
Haiti in 1939 we ended the
Panamanian protectorate.

The rise of Fascism. a threat
common to all, proved a Valli»
able counter-movement to Penn
Amcricanism; it served as a
basic impetus for cooperation in
hemisplicric defense. During the
war our relations with Ai‘gene

tina were very strained. Argen»

thc rcst oi the Latin American

During the Truman and

been due to our failure to ap—
