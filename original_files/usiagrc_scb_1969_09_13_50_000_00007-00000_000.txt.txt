“What a Drag”

‘Frosh Views Orientation

by Edward Levine

Having tlown eight hours to get to Grinnell, I had hoped to
ﬁnd a rather dynamic New student Days program. Alas, whata
dragl I could [ind no redeeming characteristics. The faculty-stu-
dent colieehour on opening day was not unlike that unfortunate
occurrence in college life. the mixer.

The next two days contained some of the more horrible exper-
iences in my young liie. Most or my time was spent either stand-
ing in lines or listening to very standard rhetoric on such topics
as race and drugs. The college seems to think that ireshmen come
to the campus ignorant and unaware. So the people running New
student Days have mediocre speakers address the students, as
coming that this' will satisty the “preps”.

But the biggest crime committed by New student Days is that
it does not correctly depict lire at Grinnell. Lite is not ordered
and dictated on this campus, yet time during New Student Days
is taken up by scheduled activities. As one sophomore pointed out,
some ireshmen are scared to go to the john because that activity
Is not on the New Student Days calendar.

The solutions to these problems are not simple. One answer
might be the midsummer orientation many colleges have initiated.
If this is not feasible, at least the high schoolrlllte atmosphere
which now pervades New Student Days should be eliminated
'Presently the only way tor a treshman to beneiit irom New Stu-

dent Days is to throw away the New Student Days calendar.

Sophomore Iliews Freshmen

, By PAUL ROTHMAN

The moment I saw them on
campus I knew: Grinnell would
never be the same. This year's
ireshman are really something
else—something very special
that's never been at Grinnell
belore.

When ﬁrst arriving on cam-
pus I was greeted with the
typical Grinnell welcome: en-
thusiastic hostility. It seemed
like another year oi the trite
dogmatic existence or grinding
away in mind and body irom
one break to the next, then get-
ting the hell out of Grinnell as
soon as the last ﬁnal is over.
But no more; things have
changed. The College atmos
phere is less tense—hut tar
more alive. This new vitality
is due to the unilagging spirit
or the freshman. In preVlous
years, the main movement
lound on campus was that of

 

Francesco Trio Premieres: 'Grea’r Success'

it you happened to miss last”

Saturday's Francesco Chamber
Trio Concert you missed the
stunning premiere or Grinnell's
new musicians - in - residence.
The trio played Mozart, Ravel.
and Schubert to a “standing
room only” crowd at Roberts
Theatre. The concert was a
great success, and the group
was called back for {our cur-
tain calls by the audience.

The Mozart Trio in C Major
K. 548, which was the trio’s
iirst selection, was good over»
all, but not at all up to the
standards set by the remainder
of the program. Pianist Nathan
Schwartz had difﬁculties with

a on isolated soit runs. How-
ever, this certainly does not

detract trom his overall playing

ability and probably was a re«
sult at his uniamiliarity with

the action of the Baldwin SDrlU
concert grand. Throughout the
rest or the concert his playing
was superb, especially in his
sensitive treatment of the deli-
cate work in the Ravel trio.
Cellist Bonnie Hampton had
virtually no chance to show her
skill until after the Mozart trio,
since it is very nearly a piano
solo, containing very little
writing tor the cello. But in the
Ravel her sound. was very
warm and delectable, and in
the E»Flat Major trio oi Schu-

bert she turned the most diffic-
ult passages into effortless cas-
cades or sound.

David Abel coaxed marvelous
sounds from his violin all night
long. Even in Roberts, where
sound seems to be absorbed im—
mediotely and echoes are non-
existent, Mr. Abel’s violin pro-
jected into the auditorium like
a slash of brilliant lights across
the blackness of a dark room.
All the while his sound remain-
ed Controlled and unlﬂrced.

The trio will again be playing
this weekend, If these future
concerts prove to he as
exciting as the iirst was, Grin-
nell music lovers are in for an
exceptional season of tine
chamber music,

This year, as in others,
freshman have mistaken upa

But what is unusual this year
is that the upperclassman have
similarly mistaken freshman
for fellow upperclassman. But
these mistaken identities ought
well to be the case: many

These freshman however,
are not a homogeneous group
but rather 411 individuals whose
similarities end, tor the most
part, with common ages and
with certain plateau at intell-
igence. They have heeded to no
common Criteria of excellence
and are prone to gainsay its-
existence. Moreover, our new
students would emphasize the
importance or the intangible
qualities in an individIIal. Yet
they do agree on one ideal: “do
what you like.” Although these
words have been espoused
previously, this class seems to
put them into effect. They see
the practice or hedonism in the
same light as was seen the win-
ning or high academic and
social accolades by previous

classes. Such realism hasn‘ﬁ
been Grinnell policy since th,
tumultuous post-war years In

Nearly 50% al‘ Registration
Miss the Point

By A STAFF WRITER

Although 666 students took the
intluenza injections oiiered dur-
ing registration last week, near-
ly one halt of the students who
registered ﬂew irorn the ilu
shots. ,

According to a Health center
spokesman, “the biggest chicke
ens" were the bigger, older men
students, While the largest block
of “takers” were in the 94 1b..
female, freshman category.

An iniormal poll oi students
sneaking out the southwest door
at Darby Gymnasium to avoid
the needle-wielding nurses stae
tioned at the northwest door
yielded several interesting com-
ments.

“I wasn't going to let them

stick some bi'g needle To me,"
and “l deterred upon religioul
grounds” were typical respon5s
es, but it was also learned that
many students had moral obe
jections to what they calledﬂ‘an
obvious attempt by the college
to lorce somahzed medicine."

A poll of students who had just
taken the shot was less reveal-
ing. Most oi them coniined their
comments to a rather terseI
"Ouch!”
