Seen As Grinnell's Greatest Need

By Lynn Denzler

The immediate campus prob
lem of finding some basis for
co-operation in administrative
procedure between 5 t u d e n t
and adult leaders emerged as
the: greatest need at Grinnell
last night during the first con<
vocation of the year.

Dean of the College James H.
Stauss, taking the reins of ad-
ministrative leadership in Lbs
absence of a college president,
spoke before a capacity audi~
ence of faculty. administration,
and students in Herrick Chapel
on the question, “Whose Col-
lege is This?”

The well-worn
tween student desire and admin-
istration providence was not
explicitly outlined for the audi-
ence, but its veteran members
were aware of the attempt to
establish a new tone for the
year ahead.

"Our need today is for many
people to be able to say. ”This
is my college,’ " said Dean
Stauss, He spoke of establish-
ing ”Grinnell constituency," or
a joint enterprise among those
having varied interests—trus-
tees, alumni, administration,
faculty, and students. a

Quoting from a. statement
made in a report by Dr, Win-
ston L. King, formerly chair-

 

conflict be- .

man of th faculty and now
serving on the faculty at Van-
derbilt University, Dean Stauss
reported that Grinnell’s lack of
a clear image of what it is
makes it difficult for a good
college to become excellent or
superlative. Reading from the
1963-64 statement on the col-
lege by Drl King. Stauss said,

“We should concern ourselves
with what Grinnell college it-
self thinks itself to be." Look-

ing at the college as faculty
chairman and statesman, Dr.
King had been disturbed by the
apparent lack of institutional
self-consciousness. “What holds
Grinnell together as an institu-
tion?" he had questioned,

“My purpose is modest,"
Stauss continued, ”I want to
look at our self-consciousness—
to provide the cement.”

Looking practically at the
needs of the college, the Dean
spoke positively about What

 

Grinnell was doing for its silk
dents on the academic level.
”What Grinnell should be do-
ing, she is doing.” he said, in
reference to a liberal arts edu-
cation which is both general
and specific.

“Your education here is tak-
ing you past the gateway of
facts," he said. “The general
education provided here can
make you an intelligent ama-
teur, while depth exploration in
the major field is making you
an intelligent apprentice in the
field of your choice." Dean
Stauss described the college as
an expert in meeting these two
requirements in liberal ethics,-
tion.

In trying to apply what the
college is offering to what the
students allow themselves to
receive, the problem of Grin-
nell inconsistency became
more definite, “Students often
fall short in exploration of a
liberal education and in the
practice of commitments,”
said the Dean afoer listing what
he considered prime commit-
ments for students seeking a
liberal education: '

1) to humane understanding

2) to reform, responsible alts
izenship

By John Wolf

When the College Forum
opens sometime after Novem-
ber 1. it will not have the anti-
septic atmosphere that might
be expected of such a modern

. structure. This assurance was

given by Vice President Merritt
Ludwig as he described the
furnishings for the Forum. In-
cluded in these plans are Kelly
green carpeting in the billiard
room and deep purple carpet—
ing in another room,

Ludwig noted that the build—
ing was designed with many
“nooks and crannies” that Will
provide semi- rivate meeting
places, There Will not be “cells"
as there were in the old union.

Ludwig further explained
that the forms into which the
concrete for the Forum was

’ poured were made of hemlock.

This wood has been found to
have the correct absorption
qualities to leave imprints of
of the wood in the hardened

 

concrete. A different technique
was used in construction of the
library and fine arts center in
order to give those structures a
monolithic effect, Ludwig said,

Ludwig could give no specific
date for the opening of the
Forum “because the last 5 per
cent of the work takes a dis
proportionate amount of time to
complete," Presently. workmen
are awaiting a shipment of eleoc
trio cables.

The building will have the of-
ficial name of the College Fon-
uml Ludwig said that the term
“union” didn't fit this building.
"This is a new departure, not
a continuation of the old,“
Ludwig commented.

Mrs. Jewell Hawk has been
named Director of the College
Foruml Previously Mrs. Hawk
was hostess at Grinnell House.

Because of the uncertainty of
the completion date, no event;
will be scheduled in the Forum
until after the Christmas tweak.
