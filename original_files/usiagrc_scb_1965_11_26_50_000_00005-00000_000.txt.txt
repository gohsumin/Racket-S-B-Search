Cris Swanson, however, felt
that the mode of, class life is not
a great deal different irom life

lose that interest their sophomore

Tile are inevitable and that dis- and comparing it to the “real

cussion at the lunch table is not
to be compared to academic mat»
_ ters. The alleged anti-intellectual
wave on campus is not apparent
to him. One failure of [the students
which is a great loss to them,
according ho Mendoza, is the lack
of interaction between students
and faculty. it has been years
since he has been invited to con-

their own and they share their on.
lhuslasm for similar opinions.

The rationale oi the residence
college is the provision oi a
scholarly community ior die stu-
dents, according to cleaver. it is
not a jooproViding medium, a
means of getting into a graduate
school, or a pre—proiession inter.
im per se. However, he recognized
that there are students, “a narrow

world," said that the average stu-
dent comes to class completely
torgetting about last Saturday
night.

Cleaver suggested one possible
moditication in the hall syslem—
putting the seniors in one hall.
“Seniors are sick of playing Micke
ey Mouse by falling out for volley-
ball,” he said.
