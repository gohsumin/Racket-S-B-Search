College Costs Cut,

Bill Not at Grinnell ‘

i . By PAUL BRADLEY

The Canadian Union of Students
has Called for a national demon-
stration ta be held October 27 in
which college students throughout
Canada will protest the rising cost
of education. This resolution for
"llie abolition of all social and
linuucial barriers to postssecondv
ary education” was formulated at
the annual meeting at the corigiess
at the Canadian UnIon of Students

The proposed tree tuition would
apply only tn tax-supported uni-
versities, eliminating any linane
cull requirement from the stu-
dent's admission needs. In the
first step to free education, Mem-
orial University at St. John’s,
Newloundland, granted tree tuition
to its 1,400 freshmen. This free
education will also be extended
to Memorial sophomores next

year.

Believing that the course credit
', and grading system may be a gen-
uine barrier to education» Colora-
do College began this September
a program to provide an upper
(unity for superior students to
work independently through their
tour years of college Twenty-live
freshmen wrll enroll in the pilot
group and will study under the
guidance of faculty preceptors.
They will receive no credits as
such, although any course will be
open as them at any time.

There will be no grades, ai-
though their work will belte-
quently subjected to evaluation
and criticism. Students are ex-
pected to confer often with their
advisers and with others at the
taculty. When a student has dem»
nnstrated to the satisfaction of the
faculty that his general education
Is adequate (and this will nor-
mally r e q u i r e two academic
years), he will select a major field

or study, working towards the
writing or an honors thesis.
