G Marlyrs' Weekend Helps Define Black-While Conilicl

Where the
Truth Hurts

_ By Tom THOMAS

The most obvious similarity between
the‘recent Black Martyr's program and
last years’ discussions [allowing the
assassination of Dr. King was the re-
current question: “What is the role of
the white individual who is concerned,
impathic, active, etc?” It is perhaps
significant of the transition of the “civil
rlghm movement” to a Black liberation
struggle met this year the questions
seemed to be but Cliches and the answers
seemed far more difficult to find.

To understand the complexity of this
problem for the white Grinnell Student,
it is iirst necessary to examine the posi-
tlon (of confusion) in which he finds
himself, in a simplistic sense, the Grin-
nell student is generally sympathetic
toward and concerned about the “Black
movement." Recalling the righteous ex<
hilaratlun of civil rights marches and We
Shall Overcome and succumbing to latent
activist tendencies, he looks for a ”role
of participation." Having read hiack
Power and a little of Malcolm X, he is
ready to join the movement. The stu<
dent is then frustrated when he finds
that his idealism is re b u fie d. that
the “Block struggle" is exactly that,
and, to his surprise, somebody actuab
ly doesn’t want him because, of all
things, he is white.

Reading Malcolm X a little more close-
ly, he learns 01 a sarcalled “supportive
role,” but this is very unclear. Question—
ing Black students or black leaders re-
sults in the same answer, “You've got
your problems, and it's your problem
to solve them." His posttion of support
becomes one at not~so~sure affirmation
of Black demands. His desire to be
“where the action is” is frustrated, his
own position becomes further confused,
and most of all, he feels the hopeless-
ness of doing nothing.

The white student feels condemned to
inactivity by his color, rejected by Blacks
as a member of the white racist society
of oppressron. However, it is in the very
fact that the student is white, that he is
a. member of the racist society, that the
role of his participation is deiined should
he choose to accept it. One must first res
member that It is the racist Society in
America which is both responsible for
the conflict and the target of the Black
liberation movement. Being already a
member ol this society holds advantages
to the concerned student that are avail-
able to no Black man.

It is in the White, middle-class com-
munities of this country that the battle
must be fought 7 a fight that has not
even yet really begun. This may lack the
dynamism of the strrogle in the urban
ghetto and the high vi bllity of a march
or demonstration, but its importance is
as extreme. Beginning in his own com-
munity and starting in his own context,
the white student of today must address
the task of provoking change in the
thought patterns of his society, a process
that will go back to the very ioundation
of this country, of which today’s racism
is but a latent manifestation.

The process, above all, must be an
educative one. The greatest failure of
our society, dramatically portrayed
throughout the “racial issue,” is a pro.
round inability to understand melt, or
even to engage in analytical introspec<
tion. To combat this, one must force in<
dividuals to go beyond the sophmoric
approach to America characterized in
high school U.S, history courses and
examine the oppressive past of our comb
try’s racism. There must be an under.

Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King is a martyr and hero for all humonitarlans. How-
ever, his tactics are now more relevant in the anti-war movement than the
Black Power struggle.

 

rune Part E Clarifies Stand

An article reporting the major ideas presented by four mem-
bers of the Black Panther Party at a panel discussion last Satur-
day was supposed to appear in this space. The Printer or the
Scarlet and Black however, found some of the direct quotes in
the article to be potentially obscene and refused to print the
Panther statements. The article‘s author prelers not to run the
article it the complete text cannot be run for it is vital to
an understanding of Ihe Panther position, the goal or the article.

The editor ﬁnds this action as a form of censorship of the
Black movement and a failure to be aware of the accepted lan«
guage. Out-moded white values are being applied to accepted, nor
mal behavior. Times are changing and the press Should he allowed
to communicate that change, (See Editorial)

“Sleeping Through
A Beyolution”

By HOWARD WARD

Why honor‘ Black martyrs’ on a col-
lege campus which is located in an all
white Iowa town, which has a Black
student population of less than 5%,
and can only boast of having three Black
professors on its staff? Why didn’t some
Concerned Black~ Studenm honor their
Black martyrs in Des Moines or in some
area where Black people predominately
preside? The reason for having Black
Martyrs' Day was not primarily for the
beneﬁt of the handful 01 Black inhabi-
tants 0f Grinnell College, but for the
education or the “white majority" on
this campus, those people who are too
undel- exposed to Black feelings, Black
culture, and Black people.

Black Martyrs’ Weekend gave the
“white majority” the opportunity to
view in their own surroundings, Black
reelings, Black culture, and Black people.
Black feelings were presented through
the film excerpts of the late Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., whose assassination was
commemorated by the Black Mal'tyrs'
Weekend. His warnings to white Ameri-
ca ot “sleeping through a revoluti 1"
rang vehemently through Herrick Chapel
and almost everyone was grasped by
his words. A contrast or Black feelings,
culture, and people was presented
through the choral selections of the
Chicago Ensemble Gospel Group, and
through the words of Father Bene-
ree. The gospel group exempliﬁed a
portion of Black culture through the
sounds of gospel-spirituals, which was
reminiscence of the anguish and toil im-
posed on the Black man in this country
for 300 years. Father Benefee, who may
have been viewed by some as a radical
priest was illustrative of one portion
of the Black mood present today in this
country. Some whites in the audience
may have been orrended by Father Eerie—
lee’s words, while others may have been
angered, yet nevertheless the Black‘
priest “did his thing” and told those in
the chapel what he stood for and how he
felt. This included the fact that Black
people are going to get themselves to«
gether, and are not concerned about
what the white man does.

The sensitivity sessions, which were
held during the afternoon, were designed
to bring out the true emotions of both
Blacks and whites in regards to race.
poverty, and other related problems of
today’s society. These sessions were
guided through me expertise of trained
social workers and counselors.

A crowded South Lounge witnessed rep
Iesentatives of the Black Panther Party.
who emphasized the principles and ideo-
logies of their organization. As shocking
as it may have been, those kids not only
represented the Black Panther Party,
they expressed the views of many young
people across this nation, which entails
the banding together of the oppressed,
Black and White, against the oppressor.

Professor Charles H. Nichols, visiting
professor of History and American stu-
dies, presented on academic overview of
the present mood in America, and em-
phasized the need for understanding and
thought in society today. Here was an
opportunity for both whites and blacks to
listen to the realistic views of an edu-
cated Black man.

Maybe for those whites who listened
and learned there is some hope, and for
those others i . I! And as Father Eerie
fee closed his speech, he held up a gun
clip and said, "We shall overcome," and
the Black Panther stated, “Stick em up
Mother this iS a holdup.
We've come lo 'get our share."
