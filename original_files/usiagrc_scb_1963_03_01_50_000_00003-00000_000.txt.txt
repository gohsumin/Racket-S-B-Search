Parents, visitors.
students, alumni, male and fe-
male students have all com-
mented to me on the lack oi
careful dressing and grooming

prove their point.

ONLY A SMALL MINORITY
of the girls seem to understand
the need for hair styling, neat
and attractive dressing, conscr-
vative but pleasant make-up.
The majority then wonder why
North Campus is not more fired
up about dating.

prospective

The reason is that boys, being
peculiar, base quite a lot (per»
haps too much) on first impres—
sions. If the first impression is
not [n\‘orable, he will return to
relative hibernation in his room.
First impressions at Grinncll are
not normally favorable.

An uniair iudgcment, perhaps,
for our campus abounds with
plcasant, ion, and personable
dates. Cute. too, it they would
try to be. But most guys never
find out how pleasant, fun. and
personable the girls can he.

V‘Drink Statements

To the editor:

In last week's paper the Sch
reporter at the open Senate com.
mittee meeting on drinking, Ede
Deekert, managed to synthesize
three separate statements, Coma
picte with reasons and qualifis
cations, into what seem to be
‘fivc pronouncements “ex cathe-
dra”

i What was said by me was to
this effect:

1. More students are entering
‘ihis School having done some
ldrinking during high school
with, if not the guidance, at
‘leasl the knowledge of their
parents. Upon graduation, the

that those who ask that we ena
trust SGA in their arms look
at these obvious regions of lite—
lessness and to try to help us
evade such pitfalls of time and

this got-ci-nment's structure. If
we have our government. let us
try to ride on its strengths, not
fall into its traps.

As a final word, let me add
that I see in this situation one
good answer to those who ques-
tion the source of student apathy
to campus government: the ease
with which we may become
caught in the drag or time lim-
