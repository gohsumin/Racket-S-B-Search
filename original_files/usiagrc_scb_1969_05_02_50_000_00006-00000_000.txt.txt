.Whatever Happened to Student Art?

By RICH WICKSTROM

The Annual Student Art Show
on exhibit at Scheaffer Gallery
until May 4 is the poorest dis<

lay of student work i have
een at Grinnell in the last four
‘years. The jewelry and ceram<
cs possess a high degree cl
oraltsmanship and a strong
sense of design The prints or
film Evensnn are beautilully
decorative. The paintings and
watercolors. however, on the
Whole are quite unimpressive,
phowilig a lack of draitsman-
thip and color sense.

The show was judged by

Professor .1 a me 5 McGarrell,
chairman of painting at In-
diana University, Bloomington.
Among other distinctions, ho
was one of the painters selected
to represent the United States
at last year's Venice Biennale.

for painting, Ronald Al for

drawing, Juli Lamson for draw-
ing, and Jeanne Burkla for
painting.

That’s all I choose to say
about the works in the exhihie
tion. I have been inundated
with calls from angry students
asking about the lack bl works
displayed from outside the m1.
department. As is stated in the
bulletin announcing the student

art show: “Only the work from
college classes and workshops

is displayed in the annual de-
partmental exhibition. The Vis-
iting judge will examine all
entries submitted, The reason
for this policy is supposedly a
lack of space, Questions have
also been raised about the num-
ber of ks art majors have
on exhibit, for example Thor
Evensnn’s 14 works, when non-
department students are limit-
ed in three entries. The hear:
or the problem is that this
show is not truly a student ex-
hibition but a departmental ex<
hibitiun exclusively for display
of work done in course: during
the past year. It is unfortunate
that than is no student show

-— organized by students. em
to any student, and judged by
students. It does not seem pos-
sible that the policy or the de-
partmental e x h H) it lo II will
change in the near future‘
