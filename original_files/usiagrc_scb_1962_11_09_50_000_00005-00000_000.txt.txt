.Picked to win: Wisconsin, Grinnell

By Len Calodney and Bob Savage

After a disastrous week of upsets last Satuiday, we’re out
to improve upon our record.

The Pioneers will have to remember that the Conference
championship won’t he theirs until the final gun tomorrow, but
Grinnell should win. Grinnell 22, Cornell 14

Homecoming should put Wisconsin up enough to carry them
to upset victory over number 1 ranked Northwestern. Wisconsin

If Grinnell could beat Des Moines YMCA by this score in
1892, then why can't Catawba rack up the points Saturday?
