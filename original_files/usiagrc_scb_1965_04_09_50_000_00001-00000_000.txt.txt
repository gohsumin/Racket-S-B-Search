lagging Economy. Unemployment
Fosters Discrimination: Haveman

By Don Winney

“A buoyant economy de-
creases discrimination. Con-
versely, a lagging economy en~
courages discrimination,” This
is the economic hypothesis
Robert Haveman (economics)
presented Tuesday night at the
third in a series of dimers deal»
ing with the race situation,

“Economic discrimination,“
he sald, “does not deal With the
maltreatment of one individual
by another, but with the mal-
treatment of a society to a
group in that society. In the
United States We do have eco-
nomic discrimination, and the
degree is substantiali"

Haveman defined economic
discrimination as being in in-
come, job opportunities, and
education, He pointed Out that
the income of Negro workers
is ﬁt) per cent that of white
workers. In occupation, 14 per
cent of white employees are
in professional managerial po
sitions; only 2 per cent of Ne-
gro employees are. Lack of ed-
ucational opportunity is a basic
cause.

Supporting his hypothesis,
Haveman cited recent ecomonic
history. “At: the onset of World
War II," he said. ”all labor was
pushed into production. Ne-
groes were hired for jobs they,
had never held before; Negroes:
acquired skills they had never
had before. There was a move-
ment of Negroes from the red-
cap and service areas of the
economy to the production
line." Economic necessity thus
decreased discrimination.

“But the last decade," he:
continued, “has not been good‘
for the Negro. The economy
has lagged. The Negro work
force has been laid off first,

and Negro unemployment is
twice as high as Whites. Much
of the sluggishness in the past
is due to a labor force ill-
equipped to handle the jobs
open. Racial discrimination is
a large reason for this."

In our market economy, he
explained, labor must be able
to react quickly to changes in
price and demand. But discrim-
ination blocks this reaction
and prevents a mobile labor
force from being utilized to ex—
panel the economy Because the
quality of labor is dependent
on education, discrimination in
education limits an economy’s
productive potential. Haveman
Called this mutual negative at-
traction between a slow econ-
omy and discrimination “the

ﬂrinnell House Open;
Board Assigned Halls

The members of the new AWS
Board were assigned to the halls
in which they will serve as presla
dents.

The presidents and their halls
are as follows: Mears, Jenny Har-
lordi Main, Laurie I-loudek; Cleve-
land, Ellen Pearce; James, Joan
Lovejoy; Halnes, Delabian Rice;
Read, Ruthie Koehler; Loose, Jane
Betts; Park Street houses, Dottie
Dosse: Grinnell House, Janet
Francis.

It was also announced that
Grinnell House will be used as a
women‘s dormitory next year.
This necessitated an additional
member of the AWS Board. Jenny
Harford was named to fill that
position this week.

Men's Housing
Decision Later

The decision on whether there
will be offrcampus housing for
men students next year will not
be made until the end of April,
Dean of Men 5. Eugene Thomp~
son said this week.

“We know the off-campus
houses are a good deal, but they
are designed for an overflow. In
addition, the college has a con-
tinuing commitment tor the rest
dence hall system," Thompson
continued

“Every male will draw for a
room on north campus in mid-
April and then may get a chance
to apply for off»campus housing
at the end of the month,” he said.

When questioned about the off-
campus situation for women,
Thompson said there will be wom-
en off campus next year in antici-
pation of a new women's dormi-
tory.

Acting President James Stauss
said that no commitment to build
a new women’s dorm has been
made, He added, however, that he
expects Grinnell's enrollment to
increase to about 1300 in the next
several years

In another area, Thompson re
vealed that a new policy allows
work orders for damage on north
campus to be reviewed by the
CofHP and the dean of men so
that responsibility for the dam-
age can be reassigned when
necessary.

Two-Way Locks

Locks to be installed on south
campus doors will be able to
be locked from both the inside
and the outside and will be of
the deadbolt variety, Vice
President Merritt Ludwig stated
Wednesday.

 

Grinnell Room Fulfills Need for College Archives

By Sue Johnson

The need for college archives
became evrdent when James Nor—
man Hall, coauthor of Mutiny on

the Bounty. left to the college all
his papers. letters and manu-
scripts. Opened in 1959 as part of
Burllng Library, Grinnell Room
now fulfills this purpose. The col-
lactinn includes all the college pub-
licatlons: catalogs, President’s re-
ports, student publications and mm
grams. Careful searching and cat-
aloging also reveals books of col-
lege and town history, publlca
tions by and about faculty and
alumni, papers on independent
study projects and dozens of other
fascinaiing items.

Rare and unusual photographs
further tempt the interested re-
searcher. Pictures of former dra-
matic productions show amazing

 

ingenuity in the creation of sets

designed for the limitations of
ARH theater. From 1904 are pic-
tures of the science laboratory and
the Women‘s gym class, both caus-
ing amusement to the modern
viewer. Newspaper clippings and
various student accounts supple-
ment photographs of the 1882 cy-
clone and tell a story which words
alone never could.

Grinnell Room also houses two
fifteenthcentury publications, one
by Thomas Aquinas; a portrait
collection from Civil War times;
an 1812 land grant: a l7l5 ship’s
invoice; an original copy of the
Articles of Confederation; clippings
about Gary Cooper; Prominent
Among the Mourners, a mystery
story about Grinnell; and infor-
mation about the Grinnell family.

A fireproof vault guards some
of Grinliell Room's treasures: the
Hall manuscripts. records of liter-

 

ary and debate societies, faculty
reports, and correspondence from
the 1800's. The publications from
the fifteenth through the seven-
teenth centuries also have a place
in this Section,

The furnishings add further in-
terest to the room. A huge solid
mahogany table is the principal
item of furniture; the Bauhaus
chairs were designed by Marcel
Breuer. Any program being pre
sented in the Viewing Room can
be picked up by a remote control
speaker located in the dropped
ceiling of Grinnell Room. Located
in the floor under a plaque is a
box containing memorabilia and
information about Burling Library.
This was dedicated during Com-
mencement Week in 1958, and is
intended to be opened in 2058.

Students are urged to contribute.
