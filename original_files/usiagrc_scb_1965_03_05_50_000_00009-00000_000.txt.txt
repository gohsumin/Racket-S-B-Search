College Presidents—
The Great Search

The search goes on and Grin-
nell, obviously, remains with-
out a president.

But then, selecting a presi-
dent is a tricky business and,
according to the Alumni 5&3,
- mysterious one “enveloped in
n shroud of secrecy and intrigue
worthy of a James Bond thrill-
or.”

And while it is difficult to
imagine what could possibly
be intriguing about selecting
a college president that would
make the search worthy of a
James Bond thriller, the
Alumni 5&3 clarified by say-
ing that the search was usual-
ly "on a rather higher intellec-
tual plane" than the Bond
books—which is easy to imag~
ins.

An article by Maurine Hoff-
man in a recent edition of the
Washington Post makes one
hope that the intellectual plane
spoken of by the Alumni sea
is maintained.

The article said, among other
things, that if the presidential
appointee of a college “works
out," it is often a “matter of
luck."

The biggest failing of college
trustees in looking for a presi—
dent, said the Post, was that
they “waste time seeking a
‘paragon of human virtues} "

One university was report-
edly looking for a man who
was a “distinguished scholar"
of “demonstrated executive
ability,” “prepared to head a
multi»millionrdollar business”
and “able to get along with the
alumni, faculty, students and
the board of trustees."

The Grinnell Board of True»
tees may have to settle for
something less.

And meanwhile the search
goes on.

Grinnell’s Great Gadget—Makes Doughnuts

By Don Winney

Great inventions have dra-
matically changed the course
of history. The steam engine,
the cotton gin, the diaper—ail
have supported society in times
of need. And now, amidst edu-
cation’s never-ending battle for
tmth, justice, and prestige,
Grinnell has a new symbol of
automated successi the dough-
nut machine.

Looking like a modern sculp-
ture of unmitigated junk, the
Sage. Cyclops splotches out
about three doughnuts per stuA
dent every morning at Cowles.
That's forty-five dozen an hour
—enough to cause any dough-
nut craftsman to change his
whole outlook on life In fact,
with its prefabricated infinity,
the machine, if used widely,
could lay off hundreds of dough-

nutvhoie makers.

Instead of laying off any
Saga workers, the doughnut
robot has actually created a
new and vital Saga position—
assistant headwaiter of dough
nuts, For someone must mix
the special ingredients and
push the magic button; some
one must supervise this highly
classiiied task. Such a man, be-
cause of the important nature
of his work, will remain anony-
mous here.

According to informed and
reliable sources, throughout the
Saga hierarchy he is knOWn
esoterically as “The Doughnut
King.” The King commences his
work each morning at six»thir-
ty. Furtively he rereads the
secret Saga doughnut formula.
one of Grinnell's most closely
guarded secrets. Then, slowly

and carelessly, he mixes the
batter and pours it into the ma-
chine. A red light blinks, and
the moment of truth arrives as
doughnuts drip from the eye of
the machine into a long frying
pan. The King smiles paternal»
ly, steps back, and watches an
act of creation. Right now he
is working faithfully for the
Golden Doughnut Award, beA
stowed to the maker of five
hundred dozen doughnuts or
more in a single week.

This feat may prove diffi»
cult to accomplish if the $650
monster blows another circuit,
as it did when it was in—
stalled. Now it’s grinding away
in grand fashion.

But: to subjective observers,
there’s something sinister in
that grinding, for a careful ex-
amination of the doughnuts roll-

ing lorti'l reveals a startling and
highly significant fact. They are
all made of tickytacky and all
come out the same. Perhaps
this conformity is in some way
symbolic Perhaps there is g
deeper profundity to be graspe
here by intense intellectual dia~
logucs between students and
faculty. In a very real sense,
is the doughnut machine a sym’a
bol for the reality of our times?
Is the doughnut machine ltseﬁ
reality? Furthermore, is reality
reality? No doubt these momen-
tous questions will someday be
answered by Grinnell scholar»
ship. Meanwhile the Golden
Doughnut Award is just around
the next hole.
