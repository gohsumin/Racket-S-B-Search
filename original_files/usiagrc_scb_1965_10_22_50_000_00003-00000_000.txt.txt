Student Evaluation of Faculty
Given Official Status at Yale

By PAUL BRADLEY

Yale University has taken the
ill-st step in giving its students an
official voice in the appointment
of faculty members to tenure po-
silions. The university has invited
academically high-ranking stu-
dents to submit written appraisals
oi their educational experience in
lectures, discussions, and semi<
rial-s.

The move is part of the review
of Yale’s iaculty appointment sys-
tem and is an effort to turn the
threat that faculty members must

"publish or perish” into an admoni~
lion to “publish and teach or
perish." The review was ordered
alter heated controversy last
spring when Richard Bernstein,
associate proiessor oi philosophy,
was not promoted to the tenure
position at iuil proiessor. Students
had then demonstrated against
what they thought was a gross
injustice to an outstanding teach
er.

The Black Ind Blue Review has
rated science professors at

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the University of British Colum-
bia. The review, compiled from
questionnaires tilled out by 8,000
students last year, uses frank
language to describe the faculty.

of the 133 faculty members, 33
are considered outstanding and 60
are rated above average. After
compiling the questionnaires, the
review assigned grades irom ex4
cellent to very poor to each pro<
lessor. Reaction from professors
has been quite mixed depending
upon what the revtew said oi
them. but the dean of the faculty
of science is favorably impressed
with the report.

His Royal Highness Crown Prince
Harald oi Norwegian Royalty
visited St. Olai on October 5. The
prince, who is On a tour of the U-
nited States, Visited the college in
recognition of its exchange pro-
gram with Norwayr This general
cultural relationship dates back to
the Norwegian founders of St. Olaf.

New ID cards have been issued
to college students in the area at
\Vestem Illinois who are over 21
years and desire positive prooi of
their legal age.

Tavern owners and liquor deal-
ci's requested these cards because
they can be held partly respon
sible if they sell alcoholic bever-
ages to a minor who presents falsi-
fied identification. Police chiefs in
Monmouth and Galesburg are con.
iident the cards cannot be falsified.

The ID card carries a snap-shot,
physical description, and the date
of birth. A copy of the birth cerr
uiicate is required to obtain the
card. Western Illinois tavern own-
ers will now only accept the new
ID cards, no draft cards or driv-
er's licenses.
