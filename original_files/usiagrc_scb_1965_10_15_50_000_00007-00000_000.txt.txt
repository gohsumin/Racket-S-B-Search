Report Describes Des Moines Proiecl

Ed. note: The following is a
description of the “Des ltloines
Project," which will be sup-
ported by several lowa colleges,
including Grinnell. Fifteen Grin-
ncll students have been in Des
ltloines to help on the project at
various times since September.

The traditional approach to the
problems of an economically (lea
privcd area,ignorcs the basic right
of people to have a voice in the
decisions which affect them.

First, the approach often fails to
ascertain either the needs of the
people or the type of program
which will work most effectively in
the area.

Secondly, because the community
has not bccn given a part in the
original formation of the program.
it resents or distrusts the purposcs
of those who are trying to start the
program. .

Finally, this approach may attack
results rather than causes, or one
aspect rather than the whole basis
of that which causes a slum.

Another approach, started in the
last tcw years by a series of dif

: feront groups ranging from Stun
E dents for a Democratic Society to

the inner-city church groups is
"cammuniLyrselfsurganization.” In
this approach fullrtime organizers
living in the arca work to draw
people together into a community
group. Their ultimate objective is
to start a working group which will
provide continuing leadership for
the area by the community people
themselves.

The difference between the com-
munity-selﬂnrganlzation and the
traditional approach is that the
former brings about a basic change
in the economically deprived area
both politically and psychologically.
Tile slum usually has very few
ways open to it for helping itself
due to the lack of political exper»
ience and influence Iound there.

 

The community organization, by
establishing the machinery and
knowledge for problemsolving by
the people themselves. modifics
their dcpcndencc on outside agen-
cics.

The community organization pro-
vides the means of self help and
communication with other coni-
munitics and groups which is so
desperately needed in these areas.

The communitysorganizing ap-
proach is the one which the Des
Moines Study Group hopes will be
put into eitcct in the Walnut Hill
area of Des illoinos. The program
will combine three working groups.

The first will be a full time or.
ganizer financially supported by
eastern and central lowa colleges.
The person who is now working in
this capacity is Billy King. who has
been living in the Walnut Hill are-a
and doing research on the prob»
lems, oi community organizing
there for one month.

Secondly, King will cooperate
with Youth for Freedom, a com.
ninnity organization in the area.

Thirdly, campus groups will take
part in the project when they are
asked to do so by the community
group. Youth for Freedom, or
King. Their participation may in-
volve research. work camps or our
or activity that the community
groups deem necessary.

The project has both academic
and cultural implications for col-
lege students, Observing and, at
times, participating in the prob-
lemssolving processes of the Wai-
nut Hill area can be extremely
valuable, They can gain both
practical political and sociological
experience. Furthermore. Contact
with a different cultural and econ
omic group can he personally. as
well as intellectually. beneficial.
However, student participation in
the project will occur only for the
benefit and at the request of those
in the area.
