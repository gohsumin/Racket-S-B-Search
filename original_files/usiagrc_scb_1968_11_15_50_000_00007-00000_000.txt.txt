Student Government Speaks

By HEATHER FOOTE,
TOM THOMAS, LEE MARI].

Yes, this week student gov-
ernment actually does have
something to sayl However,
part of what we would like to
lay belore our “reading public”
relates to the nature of this col-
umn and its lack ot proton-
dities, past, present and lulurel

As an initial note at explanae
tinn, we would like to point out
the fact that what appears he-
tore you on Friday is written
on Tuesday in order to meet
Mrs Ariett’s deadlines. Those
or you readers acquainted with
the working conditions or Grim
nell student government will
appreciate the t‘liificulties of
Such a situation. Let us take
this week as a case in point.

in view or the existing con-
troversies on campus, one
might well expect this space to
be filled with insightful com-
ment on the opens situation and
the etiects ot Monday‘s refer-
endum and subsequent re-
sponses. However, as this is be-
ing typed, we are looking for-
ward to a campus meeting on
Wednesday, a meeting with Dr.
Leggett and beans Thompson
and Law on the same day, a
student alfairs committee meet-
ing on Thursday, and a possible
statement by the President on
Friday. Anticipating the prob-
able results of these “happen-
ings" approaches the impos-
sible. Hence, a complete corn.
mentary on the state oi altairs
would seem ludicrous.

Therefore, our potentials are
restricted to those things or
which we can be reasonably
certain, which at this point is
very little, or notes or a gen.
eral nature. And, given the
marked propensity or the en-

tire community for generalities,
we generally (ahahl) choose to

limit such wisdom.
o e >’

One thing or which we are
reasonably certain is that, bar.
ring significant disaster, two
openings will appear on the ju-
dicial councils These openings
are inr one year terms begin-
ning December 1. For informa-
tion about the judicial council
contact Larry Frank, chairman
(or possibly Richard Schnier-
ov?). Applications should be
sent to either Torn Thomas or
Tom Triplett by Wednesday,
November 27.

An unidentified visitor this

don’t see why there is all this
problem about people going in

in college we had a nice col-

would take care of those things
