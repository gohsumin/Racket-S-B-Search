"A change in the atmosphere
regarding the Student Government
Association is my broadest com-

aspirant to the SGA presidency.
“There is apathy and an absence
of attitude now, but there is also

Shender views the presidency

Senate Discusses Women's Late Penalties;
Proposal Would Allow 75 'Grace Minutes'

A rider attached to the AWS bill turned out to be more con-

Discussion of an AWS Board proposal tor a change in late

minutes penalties tor women was the main topic oi Wednesday's
Senate meeting The Senate adjourned without taking a vote when
a quorum count was called.

The nws “grace minutes" proposal allows all women students
a maximum of 15 late minutes a semester without incurring penal-
ties. After these minutes have been exhausted, a woman must
serve the normal one night of hall conﬁnement for every five
late minutes.

Under the AWS proposal, each additional late arrival after the
l5 minutes have been used up will be penalized by three nights at
confinement plus one night for every five minutes at lateness

aws Board president Chris Peterson explained the proposal,
pointing out that “most of the latenesses which occur during the
week occur during the first five minutes after the doors are
locked." The idea or the proposal is “to give each woman student
15 minutes as a butter period to account for these accidental late-
nessest"

troversial than the bill itself. Attached to the proposal as a ”final
comment” it suggests that all but tout of the loggia doors be
locked early on weekends. so that they can all he looked promptly
at hours. It also urges the night watchman to start his rounds so
that the Main door he the last one looked and be locked exactly
at hours, ‘

According to the AWS Board “such a proposal will reduce ex-
cessive paperwork tor the nightcheck girls and the Women's Pri-
mary Court, and will culminate in more uniform and stringent
penalties for lateness.”

The procedure provides tor a tile box in the quadrangle ottice
containing a card tor each woman student. The student will sign
in upon late arrival and the nightcheck girl will countersign.

Each time a woman is late, She will be told how many or her
15 minutes remain, The night girl will be responsible for this
computation,

Excused lateness will not be included in the 15 “grace min-
utes.”
