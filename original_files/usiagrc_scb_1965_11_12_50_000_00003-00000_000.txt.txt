'Dratt Card Day’
Held at Monmouth

Monmouth college, like many
other schools, is undergoing an in—
tense conflict over American in-
volvement in Viet Nam.

As part of this clash two Mon-
mouth students will debate two
Visiting Cambridge University stue
dents on the topic, “Resolved, that
the United States should withdraw
from Viet Nam." Yesterday a
memorial service was held in con-
nection with the observance of
Veterans Day. Veterans took part
in the discussion of the sacriﬁces
men oi the armed forces have
made in previous wars.

The Monmouth college student
center is sponsoring a Drait Card
Recognition Day. During that day,
upon presentation or his drait
card, one Will receive a discount
on ptirchases at the student cen»
ter and will be given steaks ior
dinner.

A mailing campaign directing
students to send letters and car-
tons filled with cookies, candy,
and magazines to servicemen and
children in Viet Nam has been
organized. The boxes will be sent
to the area where fighting is heav-
iest. Additional plans are being
made to allow a student talent
show to travel to Viet Nam during
the Christmas and Spring vaca—
tions and entertain servicemen if
It is needed.

n e o

Amhurst is in turmoil over the
lock or student participation in
faculty decisions and has asked
several other schools about their
iacultystudent relationships and
their open hall policies.

Dartmouth College gives its stu
dents a say in many aspects of
college lite. The student academic
committee evaluates and modiﬁes
administration educational policy
decisions, and the taculty only ad-
Vise the student judiciary commit-
tee on all disalpllnary actions.
Dartmouth students are content
with the present sonial system and
the limited open hall hours.

Wesleyan has a good adminis-
tration»student atmosphere. The
Student Educational Policy Com-
mittee annually surveys all ma-
jors about their department facili-
ties and the quality of education
ottered. A iaculty-student panel
controls Wesleyan’s social system,
and it is attempting to work out
a new social code more pleasing
to the student body.

An informal atmosphere sets the
tone at Swarthmore. Swarthmore
has Saturday and Sunday after-
noon open halls with Saturday night
hours on an “experimental basis."
Also, evaluation sheets are dis»
tributed to students to evaluate
their pmiessors and courses. Stu-
dent pressure was able to bring
about the introduction of a sociol-
ogy department.

t 'Twink’ Draws Poetic Comments

(Continued irom Page 1)

I'll admit some bits were cleverly done —
the feet scene that went too slow,
the bathtub scene, and hugging pairs
speaking about leftvhanded cigars that
“went out long ago." The orange-aid
scene at the end of the first.
and that final scene. the last — “nothing" -—
Total nothing — seemed to sum the play:

Total Sound
Total Flute
Not proioiind
only cute

Silly jokes and lousy puns.

short little dialogues make one numb
to laugh, numb to applause:

Waiting only a ﬁnal pause or

final twink at some little star.

Carleton letter Creates Crisis:

'hgo Thro-

Tells Administration Where to Go

Up in the north woods, it’s open
season on college presidents.
President John Nason of Carleton
College, however, does not like to
be shot at

In a letter to the editor appear-
ing in the Carletonian of Oct. 28,
senior Jeff Long assailed Nason
and the Carleton administration
in general. He accused “Nason
and Co." of believing that "we
have not outgrown the stage where
we will be satisfied merely to be
told what makes boys different
irorn girls.”

Long expressed his feelings that
the college policy on discouraging
student sex is downright unrealis-
tic. “People are going to do it
anyway—even nice people. respon»
sible people, Christians. 4-H Club
members, and, yes, even Mary
apple pie sweetheart."

In a genuine crescendo of emo
tional outburst, Long addressed
these words to "Nason and Cor”!

“You force people to act like
dogs and then you punish them
for it. There’s something plenty
sick about that. . . .All we want
is to be able to live like normal
human beings. A person's sex
life is pure and simply none of
your damn business. So why don’t
you just leave people the hell
alone."

Long’s letter prompted a two-
hour meeting of the Board of Pub»
llshers in which the board discus-
sed the content of the letter and
Carletonian editor Pete Iverson's
responsibility in printing this let
ter.

Chemistry Professor Richard W.
Ramette’s motion to censure the
Carletonian tor publishing Long's
letter was defeated, and a motion
was tabled to exert pressure on
the newspaper to print an apology,

Ramette pointed to the letter as
being “particularly offensive,"

on THE

RIGHT

 

and charged that Iverson had OK~
nibited irresponsible icumalism,

In answering Ramette‘s char-
ges, lverson said that the paper
was printed primarily for an ona
campus audience, and that it was
not used, as Ramette charged, as
a “destructive tool."

The Carletonlan was besieged
with letters, some favorable to
Long, most uniavorable to the
manner in which he voiced his
objections.

One student in particular seeni~
ed to grasp the issue at hand:

”Obviously, Carleton is not a
democratic society. The adminis<
[ration can’t leave us the hell
alone. . . .There is a great need
tor personal relationships with the
opposite sex, and these cannot be
policed without destroying almost
all personal freedom, . .There is
a need. I hope the administratiou
will recognize it, and contend
with it fairly and realistically."

As for Mr. Long, he is now on
social probation. A hard blow,
but that's the way things happen
in Paul Bunyan country.
