"A Vision And A Prayer

The Hallie Flanagan Davis
Theatre, fondly known as the
Arena Theatre, opened its
doors Thursday night to a
previously unproduced pair of
one acts. The two one-act
plays, united under the one
title of "A Vision andAPray‘
er", were adapted by junior
David Hechier from two of
Anton Chekhov's short stor-
ies: ”()1 the Way" and “A
_ Story Without an End”.
The first exclusively student
produced program ofthesem'
- ester, it is directed by senior
‘Larry Grimm as a theatre
independent. Grimm has cho-
sen to work with an unprodu-
ced student's adaptations be-
cause he wishes to capture
the impact of Chekhov‘s short
stories on the stage and to
offer the audience an alterna-
tive perspective of Chekhov.
, Hechler feels he was able to
gain invaluable experience in
writing as well as benefiting
from an association with the
art of drama. Both Grimmand
Hechler are experiencing
their first productions here

The two casts are young but
most have been seen before on
Grinnell's stages or havewor

and Lee Edmunds, concerns

attempted suicide.

The play will be presented

pects of production in the Ar-

I have been able to ascertain
that the money available to

proximately the same as last

The infamous "Bill 63,"whc
ich provided for the use of
English in Quebec schools,
triggered the separatist drive
when Parliament passed it
over heavy French protest.
Seeing that Anglor Canada of-
fered only “assimilation and
exploitation," as Dixon said,
the French formed a separa-
tist-socialist party that re
ceived 26% of the province
vote in its first election. Al—
armed, several liberals joins
ed the party and tried to kill
the separation issue. DisgusV
ted students then left to form
the Front du Liberation de
Quebec.

The Front devised a manir
festo which Dixon said ”talks
the people's language. It deals

with specifics, not rhetoric.
And the university people and
workers agree with the grief
Vances and demands of the
manifesto . that’s the beauti-
ful thing - even though they
don‘t always buy the violent
tactics of the FLQ.”

About the Front’s murder of
IAPorte, Dixon said, "The
FLQ made a horrible mis-
take. It really believed the
Anglo-Canadian government
would exchange prisoners, but
the government decided la-
Porte was not important enr
ough. It preferred making the
FLQ look like monsters."Al~
so, LaPorte's murderpermitr
ted the government to invoke
the War Measures Act, sus—
pending the Constitution and
Bill of Rights. Dixon contend-

ed that the Act’ is being used
speciﬁcally to kill the separ—
atist movement.

"You see," Dixon explained,
"if Quebec goes separate, in—
dustry may benationalizedand
Amerlmn and Anglo-Canad-
ians will be driven out. Even
if Quebec doesn't nationalize,
it will certainly vote in social
democracy. The increasedta-
xes to pay forpublicmedicine,
etc. will be hard on private
corporations." Quebec's de~
parture would set a bad ex-
ample for other dissatisfied
provinces in the federation.
Returning to the American
government's interest in Que-
bec, Dixon declared, ”An in‘
dependent socialist Quebec:
would directly threaten Ame
erioan control of the contin-
ent . . . like a Chiba across
the Vermont border."

The Quebecseparatistmove-
ment is threatened from two
quarters and mnnot survive
without the support of some
Americans. And for Dixon the
most sobering discovery to
come out of the Canadian cri—
sis was: "If neo-ﬁascist tac-
tics . like the War Measures
Act - can be used in Canada,
they can be used anywhere._"

one or two N. L. jams?

Columns such as this can be
legimateiy criticizedas bitch*
ing after the fact, and perfor'
ming little constructive fun-
ction. I would therefore like
to encourage anyone reading
this far to make known your
sentiments on the subject. It
is your money and my money
that is being spent. We are
talking about our social actir
vities. The social coordinator
is Pete Keepnews (ext. 219).
Make Icnown your opinions to
him. One of the saddest ex-
amples of responsible opinion
being or not being expressed
was two years ago Cary Gid-
dins brought the Cecil Taylor
group here and much critic
cism resulted - even evoking
irate letters in the S and E.
Cary called a meeting for all
those who had complaints,and
about nine people showed up,
and most of them said that
they would give Cecil a 42
because they couldn’t dance
to it.

One final word - the same
people who brought you Enoeh
Smoky are considering Sha-
NarNa for second semester.
Iwould like to see them here,
because even though the mus
sic is not great, it would be
one FFO concert.
