Faculty Committee Arts On Rules
Violation l) y South Younlrer Ilull

A series of events the past
week has led to the members
of South Younker hall being
placed on conduct probation.
The action was taken by the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, in a unanimous deCis-

ion, following the hall’s admis-
sion that it violated the college
alcoholic beverage regulations
on the evening of Nov. 3.
As the 58:13 went to press, a

Weekend of Uncertainty. Turmoil
For Student Government Officials

The South Younker Decision
from the Committee on Student
Affairs brought on a period of
crisis among student govern-
ment officials as they probed
among themselves and with
members of the administration
the possibility of major changes
in administration policy toward
rules and their enforcement
during-a hectic series of meet-
ings throughout: the last week»
end.

Spearheading the movement
to find out what was going on
and what it meant to the stu-
dent body were Phil Johnson,
Student Government President,
and Jim Parkison, Speaker of
the Senate. Coming out of a
meeting Friday afternoon with
Waldo Walker, Associate Dean
of the College, and 5. Eugene
Thompson, Dean of Men,
Johnson and Parkison said that
they detected attitudes that to
them warned of an impending
“crackdown" by the adminis-
tration in rule enforcement and
some sweeping changes in the
relationship between adminis-
trative enforcement action and
that on the student level.

In meetings with students on
Friday night and Saturday they
elaborated on their basic fears:
that college officials no longer
felt that monetary fines were
useful deterents and that in-
stead the only effective penal-
ties are conduct probation,
suspension, or dismissal; that
the student deans will take any
cases of rule violations which
come to their attention to the

not see any reason to consult
with the SGA officials before a

tuted on North Campus as soon
as possible.

mained was administrative and

investigations and talks among
all people concerned through-
out the week-end revealed that
much had been the result of
misunderstanding, emotion, ex-
aggeration, and what one of-
ficial called "opinion monger-
ing."

in its oWn effort to determine
what was happening, the Scarlet
and Black spent a large part of
the weekend contacting members
of the administration and members
of the FCSA, as wall as student
leaders.

of the hall who were in no way
involved in the event or its
planning, was being presented
to the Committee.

The events of the week start-
ed when the Dean of Men and
the Associate Dean of the col-
lege received an anonymous
letter stating that on the even-
ing of Nov, 3, (election night)
South Younker hall had sold
hamburgers, pop, and beer in
their clubroom. (This action
violated the college alcoholic
beverage regulation because it
involved consumption of beer
in the clubroom and the sell-
ing of it to minors.)

Upon receipt of the letter, the
Dean of Men began investiga-
tions which led to the hall‘s ad-
mission nhat the party was
held, that it was voted upon and
passed by the house council,
and was passed by the majority
of those attending a regular
house meeting at which it was
discussed. It was planned as a
fund raising function. The hall
made about $15.00 on it.

The letter itself did not lead
to the matter being taken to the
FCSA, but to investigations
which substantiated parts of rho
letter and disproved other
parts. The violation explained
above was the matter that was
taken to the committee.

On Monday evening, Nov, 16,
the Dean of Men attended the
South Younker housemeeting
and explained that the action
could not go unpunished. At
that time the hall made it clear
that the responsibility for the
event was the hall‘s and the
punishment should be meted
out to the hall, rather than to
the individuals who were di-
rectly responsible for the buy-
ing and selling of the refresh-
ments and the planning of tho
details.

On Thursday evening the
Dean of Men agaln attended a
meeting of the hall, and an-
nounced the decision of tho
FCSA to them.

At the time that the hall ad-
mitted responsibility for the vi-
olations of the college regula~
tions regarding alcoholic bev-
erages, some of the members
of the hall said that they were
aware that the probable penal-
ty would be individual conduct
probation for each member of
the hall, other memberi of tho
hall said that they thought the
probable penalty would be so-
cial probation for the hall
(which would involve the freak
ing of the hall funds and piohh
