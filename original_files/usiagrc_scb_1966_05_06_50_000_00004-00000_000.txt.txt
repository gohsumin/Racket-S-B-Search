At a coffee hour held Tuesday after-
noon, Christopher Lasch, professor of
history at the University of Iowa, spoke
on “The ‘New' Radicalism" to a large
group,,of interested Grinnellians gather<
ed lathe South Lounge.

in beginning w discussion, Lasch dis-“O
scribed today’s radical movement as
"non-violent but not pacifistic.” made
up of middle class youth who are none-
theless contemptuous of middle class
mores.

Two characteristics of the new radi-
lalism, according to Lasch, are an in-
difference to Communist influence. and
Iympathy for Mao, Castro, et al. The
latter arises because the new radicals
fear bureaucratic oppression more than
government suppression as manifested in
their criticism of Berkeley and praise
for Cuba.

While Lasch feels that the new radica
"lam has Common roots with the radi-
calism of the thirties, e.g, ‘ftlle deterior-
ation of patriarchal authority in the mid-
dle class family,” he believes that the
new radical has not been significantly
influenced by the writings of the old.

A major wealcness of the new radical-
lsm Lasch feels lies in Its emphaslﬁ
on youth. Citing the Berkeley slogan.
“You can’t trust anyone over thirty," ha
lees no future for the young radical oth-
er than to become one of the distrusted,”
Le. a conventional middle class adult.
Also, the emphasis on youth makes the
movement susceptible to the patronizing
attitudes of adults, and prevents “a
transfer of experience from generation
‘to generation," leaving, Lasch says, "no
generational continuity upon which to
build a community." .

A questioning period followed with a
panel composed of Professors Betts (his-
wry), Cleaver (English), and Fletcher
(pol cal science). Betis questioned the
Ienability of Lasch’s “decline of patriar-
chal authority" thesis, suggesting that
the profusion of new radicals indicates a
"qualitative as well as quantitative
change." Fletcher and some students em-
phasized the anti-structural aspect of
the new radicalism, with Fletcher sugv

esting that there are particular “ob-
fective issues which students and intel-
lectuals must attend, for instance voter
registration in Alabama. Lasch cons
curred, differentiating between the rigid

dogmatism of the Communists of the
thirties (which the new radicals oppose)
and the comparatively flexible organi-
zation of individual civil rights groups.

In response to a question as to how
he would increase the effectiveness of
the new radicalism,,i._asch¢aid that tho
rtude’nts should make an attempt to for-
get the use of “politics" for self-expres<
sion and rather try to increase the
"generational continuity."

“I guess all I want students to do,"
said Lasch, "is not forget the past." He
emphasized (that ghereshouid not be

gical predecessors View of the last gen-
eration of radicals (in the fifties) who

Musical Weekend

Friday, May 6, im

Violin Sonatas, Taped Music, Students
Featured in Three Upcoming Concerts

Three major musical programs will
be presented on successive evenings this
weekend, each on at 8 pm. in Ro-
berts Theatre. All three are open to the
public with no tickets required.

This evening, a distinctive program of
violin Sonatas will be offered by Thad
dora Mantz McMillan and David Albee,
piano. Mrs. McMillan is a former mem-
ber of the Lenox Quartet, and Albee is
a member of the Drake University facul-
ty and of the Drake Fine Arts Trio.
The program will include sonatas by
LeClair, Vivaldi, Mozart and the F-A-B
Sonata by Albert Dietrich, Robert Schu-
mann, and Johannes Brahms. The F.
A-E Sonata was composed in 1853 in an-
ticipation of the arrival in Dusselforf of
the musician Joseph Joachim. The mots
to Frei aber elosam, “free but lonely,"
was used by Joachim during this pe«
riod. This is the meaning of the pit-ls
by which the sonata is known, and the
notes F, A. and 5 appear prominently
throughout the sonata.

Outdoor Graduation
—lf Weather Permits

If Iowa's spring weather permits, Coma
mencement this year will be outdoors,
according to Fred He‘ss, director of pub-
lic relations.

The sylvan setting — whose seatfng
arrangement will be the same as the in-
door setting — will he in the shaded area
directly west of the Forum, will face
north-easterly with the Forum and
Science Building in the background. The
platform will be constructed in such a
way as to block vision of the physical
plant. ,

A representative group of seniors was
contacted to see what their feeling was
about having commencement outdoors,
Eldon Franz, chairman of the commence<
ment committee, said that the seniors ho
contacted were overwhelming in favor
of an outdoor commencement.

Should the weather take a turn for the
worse the 1900 expected participants and
guests will move into Darby Gymna-
sium. Further details — such as the line
of procession — have not been decided
at this point.

The entire program of commencement
weekend is still as of yet undecided.

The most unusual of the programs
will he the Saturday night “Concert of
Compositions for Tape and Visual Pro-
jections," from the San Francisco Tape
Music Center. a

Anthony Martin, visual director, and
Pauline Oliveros, composer, will present
five numbers involving various comr-
binations of electronic tape, film, voice,
and projections. The composers repre«
sented are Miss Oliveros, Morton Subotv
hilt; Ramon Sender, and Anthony Mar-
tin.

The San Francisco Tape Music Cen-
ter is a nonprofit corporation establish-
ed by a group of composers, artists, and
sound engineers to promote creative ex-
periments in sound and light. The San
Francisco Chronicle has called their re‘
sults “at once humorous, bizarre, and
fascinating," with color, motion, and
sound blended into a "new theatrical
art—an art to be reckoned with."

The Sunday evening concert will fea-
lure student performers. Miss Ann Ho-
ganson will play the first movement of
Bach‘s Clavier Concerto in D minor ac-
companied by the Grinnell College Dr-
chestra Strings, Denis M. de Coteau, com
ductor. The Grinnell College Coilegium
Musicum, Conducted by David Suther-
land, will follow with a group of chan-
ions by Layclle, Josquln and Passereau,

The Collegium Musicum, assisted by
Professor Tyree and Addi of the Uni-
versity of Iowa, will also perform the
suite from Stravinsky’s theatre piece
Histoire de Soldut. Composed in lill
for a miniature orchestra of seven play~
ers, the music represents one of Stra-
vinsky’s greatest achievements and has
remained a formidable challenge to per—
formers. Drawn from a cycle of stories
in Russian folklore, the work relates “the
tragic story of the soldier destined to
become the prey of the Devil.”

The story is played by a Narrator
and three characters — the soldier, the
devil, and the princess, who mimes and
dances but does not speak. The beauty
and force of musical effect which Stra-
vinsky has achieved with the sparse ma-
terial he allowed himself have made HIS-
toire de Soldat one of the most influen-
tial compositions of the century. Al.
though it is entirely appropriate in its
original function as an adjunct to the
drama, the music has most often been
performed alone, as in the present con»
cert.

t Reprimands Primary Court

The men contended that their constitu-
tional rights had been violated because
they were sentenced without a hearing.
The High Court decided that the state-
ment sent to the two men from the Pri-
mary Court did not constitute an opinion,
and further reprimanded the Primary
Court for failing to point out the rights
of the defendant to a hearing prior to any
mention of alternatives to a hearing.

Normally, if the defendant does not
request a bearing upon notification of his
offense, he is presumed to have entered
a plea of guilty. If he requests a hearing,
is granted one which follows all the
procedural regulations stated in the stu-
dent handbook,

“The point of the appeal is. however
well taken, for the wording of the Pri-
mary Court‘s statement is not sufficient
to establish the fact of such a hearing,
and because all evidence points to the
contrary, this Court finds that there was
no trial or hearing," said a statement of
the High Court.

The High Court further noted that
“Though the Primary Courts may desigs
nate an alternative to hearing in the now
tification of a defendant of his rights to
hear in minor cases of frequent occur-
rence, it must be made clear that any
penalties mentioned are only alten-latives
and will not be imposed unless the stu-
dent waives his right to hearing."
