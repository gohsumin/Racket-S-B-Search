In conference Meet

By Don Kurasch

The Pioneer racqueteers
failed to place anyone in the
Midwest Conference meet fi-
nals last weekend, finishing in
I file for fifth with Knox. This
was Grinnell’s lowest finish in
recent tournaments.

Third seeded Larry Shannon.
playing in the number one sin-
gles spot, lost to Ripon’s all-
amund athlete, J ack Ankerson,
6-4, 6-4, in the semi-finals. Mike
Greenfield, seeded first in the
number three position, lost in
the second round. Bob Kornfeld
and Ken Clymer, playing num-
ber four and number two re-
Ipectively. failed to advance.

In doubles action, Shannon
and Kornleld got through a
preliminary round, but lost in
their next match. At number
two doubles, third seeded
Clymer and Greenfield lost
their opening match.

One note of consolation, how-

ever, is that Coach Bowers’
team is young. All the varsity
lettermen will be returning,
and a large crop of freshmen
should challenge the top six [30'
sitions next year.

year domination of the confer<

points. Carleton took second

-l- Animal Life -:-

By Don Kurasch

The McMurray Trophy has
been won, and all the Animals
are locked in their cages study—
ing for finals. The winner hadn’t
been decided until one of the
last softball duals of the season,
an exciting game last Monday
when the men of Smith con-
quered the men of Clark 10-!)
in 10 innings.

The climactic finish was a
fitting tribute to one John C.
Truesdale, who this year com-
plates his 37th and final year at
Grinnelll Dr. Truesdale, Pete
Staben, and all the other 1M
officials were responsible for
this past 1963-64 IM yearian-
other very successful year.

It was a year very much
dominated by the two top con»
tenders for the IM crown,
Smith and Clark. At the end of
the football season, the three
spots were won by Clark. Dib-
ble, and Gates. ln Tennis it
was Clark, Langan. and Smith.
Langan, Smith and North dom-
inated Volleyball. 1273 in Swim-
n'ling went to Langan, Smith,
and North. Basketball’s high
places went to West, Smith,
and South. Track was com-
pletely dominated by Clark,
followed way behind by Sv 'th
and South. In Bowling it was
Dibble. Rawson and Clark.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At this point in the year,
there were two sports left to bo
played, golf and loftball.
Smith, without having won a
first place in any sport, domi—
hated the Animal heap with'
2120 points. Their only threat
was Clark, very close with
2000 points.

When the Golf results were
in, Clark, East, and Dibbln
had won. Now. softball would
be the deciding sport. Assum-
ing Dibble beat West in a make-
up game yesterday, they won
the sport, with East, Smith,
and Rawson in a 3~way tie for
second. In any case, Smith has
captured the McMurray Tro-
Phy.

For the Seniors, lMs are all
over. For the rest of us, it's
only over until the whole cycle
begins again this fall. Fellow
Animals, 1 leave you with a
famous quotation in honor of
Animal athlete Bruce Kauf<
mann. Samuel Richardson
(1689-1761) once said, “Pity is
but one remove from love."

Until September, then.

tom of the Grand Canyon in-

cats.
