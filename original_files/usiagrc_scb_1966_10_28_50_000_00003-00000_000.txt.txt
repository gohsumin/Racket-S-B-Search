Discussions are being held at
Beloil: concerning the role
of the college in the life
oi a student. Symposiums,
called “convo clusters," have
been held entitled “The College
as a Community." Beloit has
concentrated on trying to bring
student and faculty groups
closer togeuier.

Controversy has also arisen
over the issue of whether or not
Beloit should call itself a
Christian institution. No deii<
nite concepLs have been estab-
lished yet, but three proposals
have received more support ac-
cording to the Christian College
Committee One plan gives
complete freedom at thought,
one accepts Christianity as an
important part of its heritage
and the third plan combine:
these two Views. Under the
third plan Beioit would tenta-
tively affirm certain Christian
guidelines and continue to work
towards further understandings.
