By FREDA TEPFER

“All you have to do to fly,” said Peter Fan to Wendy, “is
think lovely thoughts, and then up you'll go." A week at Grinnell
College may not be a truly lovely thing but you’ve got at least
two or three chances this week to get yourseli ilying.

Friday. November 1 will be brimming with iun things to do.
At 8:00 in Roberts Theatre the Lenox Quartet will be coming
your way with goodies from Mozart and Beethoven. An extra at-
traction will be a new piece by Mr. Zonn. Between 8:30 and 10:30
is your opportunity to work on some oi those SAGA potatoes and
vegetable (at at the open swim. At 9:15 “Lonely are the Brave"
will be shown in ARI-I. At 10:00 the North Lounge will be swarm-
ing with dancing Grinnellians taking advantage oi two hours of
free joke box music. it juke box music isn’t your thing, you can
listen to recorded comedy a la Nichols and May at 11:15 in the
Coiiee House and listening room.

spirited Grinnclt students cheering the Pioneers in their bout
whh Lawrence College. From 7:00 until 12:00, all of you bowlers
can enjoy tree bowling at the Bowl-a-rama ot your choice. At 3:00,
“Intruder in the Dust" will be shown in ARI-1. At 10:00, everyone
can join me in Darby Gymnasium in an attempt to iind out what
0. wus auction really is. This is your chance, Grinnell students,
to get caught buying something you didn't want, just because you
tried to scratch your nose! Once again, irom 10:30 until 12:30,

through someones true-blue generosity, the juke box will blast
away without the aid or your money.

On Sunday, November 3, there are all sorts or reasons ior
you to get out oi bed. Aiter Sunday morning breakiast, that great
social event, you can begin preparations ior Open Dorms! At 2:30

At 9:45 “Jules and Jim” will be shown in ARH. Not even a 12-page
paper due at 0:00 Monday morning is reason enough to stay away
irom one of the best movies you’ll ever see at Grinnell.

When asked Whether the de-
cision to allow Sclineirov to live
on campus indicated that others
would be dealt with in the same
way, President Leggett de-
clined to comment, noting that
there were problems involved.

After Mr. Leggett informed
Schneirov of his (1 e c i S i 0 n,
Schneirov, Bonnie Tinker, and
Michael Bran issued the idle
lowing statemen .

“President Leggett's decision
and accompanying statement on
the illegal visitation case be»
fore him shows his unwillingness
and inability to deal with the
fundamental problems or resi-
dential hall life now facing the
college community. As we and
the student senate have made
clear neither R. Scliiieirov nor
any other student should be
punished for the violation of a
rule unacceptable to the student
community, The president's
punishment or one individual is
an attempt to divide students
by separating this case from
the existing unhealthy state or
aIIairs existing in the residence
halls. His failure to act judi-
ciously indicates that the ad-
ministration is incapable of
realistic and responsible action
upon the matter and leaves
students no choice but to take
this responsibility tor the regu-
lation oi dormitory lite upon
themselves."

Senate Delays Action
0n Schneirov Case

At its Wednesday night meet-
ing the Senate decided not to
pass a resolution or any kind at
statement on the Schneirov
case. They felt that since
Schneirov himself is not going
to do anything until he can as-
sess student opinion there is
nothing more they can do. Any
more action in this matter must
come from the student body it-
self.

No decision was announced after
the meeting.

St. Olaf

tion has been formed at St.

cil. Leader Ron Hunter pointed
out the need of a section in the
library devoted to racial litera—
ture, for more black oriented

nia grapes.

has been considering the desir-
ability of the presence or
AFROTC on campus. The first
report was submitted and re-
Ieased two weeks ago and stated
that in terms of the definition

ROTC was a rejection of the
pi'inClples of this type of educa-

tion. A reply shall be released
as soon as it is available.

the midst or questioning the

pate at all in the program. The
aim of the plan is threefold: (1)

viate the burden of tuition now
resting on students.

upon the diiiiculty in obtain<
ing money from the legislature.
