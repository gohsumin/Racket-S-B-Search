Students Complete Independents
With Dramas by Albee and lonesco

By Ann Showalter

Juniors Deb Burnstine and Robin
Konikow will present their inde-
pendent drama projects, “The
'American Dream,” by Edward Al-
bee and “Jack or the Submission,"
by Eugene lonescu in the arena
theater Monday and Tuesday night.

Miss Burnstine described “The
'American Dream" as “ a comedy
with implications of horror."

She sees the play as the second
of three progressive steps in Al-
bee’s development as a playwright.
The first step is represented by
“The Sandbox" and the third by
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.”

“The writing in ‘The Sandbox’ is
unpolished," she stated. “The char-
actors are abstract and unbeliev-
able and the impact of the play de-

Final Services Held
For Miss 'Freemon

Funeral services were held Wed-
nesday in Glencue, Illinois, for
Grinnell freshman Jacqueline R.
Freeman, killed last Friday night
when she and three of her class—
mates were struck by a car while
riding their bicycles north of town.

Attending the services as rep-
resentatives for the student body
were Phil Johnson, SGA president,
and Jim Parkisun, Speaker of the
Senate. Barbara \Veiser, Miss
Freeman’s freshman roommate,
and Darlene Keeier, who serves as
head resident in the White House

pends heavily on a twisted mes-
sage at the end.

“There is more character de-
velopment in ‘American Dream’,"
she continued. “There is a con»
trast between the matter-of—iact
tone of what the characters say
and the abstract horror of the life
they are living. The way they live
reflects a certain view of Ameri-
can middle class mores."

' " ‘Virginia Woolf‘ is far more
polished in style and character de«
velopment than the first two plays.
Albee thrusts us into a real sit-
uation and within this situation the
dialogue seems apt and realistic.
What was begun in ‘The American
Dream' is carried one step fur-
ther."

The members of the cast for
"The American Dream” are Mike
Arnow as Daddy; Mike Dewitt, the
Young Man: l-lelen Klein, Mommy,
Lucia Lynner, Mrs. Barker and
Ruth Unruh, Grandma.

Miss Burnstine may take her
cast on tour next semester. She
hopes to present “The American
Dream” and “The Ugly Duckling.”
a fairy story by A. A. Milne, at
several colleges in the area.

Whereas Miss Burnstine feels
“The American Dream" is "not
far out enough” to be considered a
representative of the Theater of
the Absurd, Konikow states that
“Jack or the Submission" is “a
vivid example” of this genre,

“I’m fascinated by lonesco’s con-
cept of the inefficiency of language
to say all that should be said,”
Robin commented. “This element
runs through all of Ionesco's plays,
‘The Bald Soprano’ in particular."

Mysterious about the plot or
theme of the play, Robin stated,
“lonesco calls it a “naturalistic
comedy."

The cast includes Robert Katz as
Jack; Jane Ewert, Jackqueiine:
Robert Barrow, Father Jack; Mar-
gie Applebee, Mother Jack; Bill
Beeman, Grandfather Jack; Con-
nie Simon, Grandmother Jack;
Cathi Rogers, Roberta I and ii;
Clyde Smith, Father Robert; Sue
Upshaw, Mother Robert.

The comprehensive fee for

paid to keep a faculty of high
quality are an especially heavy
burden for current operation."
