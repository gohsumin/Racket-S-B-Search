said later, "I thought I was going to
die." Seven other demonstrators were
also shot during the night.

The crowd, which formed briefly one
last time, moved into the Old Town area.
Another battle with police came at
Eugenie and LaSalle after the crowd had
started to move back to Lincoln Park.
As the crowd moved toward the park people
shouted "it's a trap" and the crowd
turned. There was a brief skirmish
with police and then the demonstrators
again moved to dark side streets. It
was about 11:15.

The crowd moved northwest, presumably
heading back toward McCormik Seminary.
There were only about 60 people left in
the main group. The crowd moved north
to North Ave. and then west. As they
reached Menomonee, several police cars
drove straight toward the group. One
car actually drove into the crowd at
a speed of about 25 mph, knocking
several persons down. Officers jumped
from the cars and some carried revol—
vers. The crowd turned to Orleans St.,
overturned a car and smashed more
windows, then scattered into the night.
