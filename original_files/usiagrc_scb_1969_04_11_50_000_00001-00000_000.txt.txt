DEMONSTRATORS lined the hallway of the Science building at the last
faculty meeting to protest the present ROTC status on campus.

Protest note at Facility Meeting

i00 Wear Armbands
’Spy,’ Swastika Found

More than 100 students donned black
armbands and held a peaceful demon-
stration in the Science Bldg. before last
Monday's faculty meeting.

SGA President Tom Thomas, who was
among these gathered in the front hall
or the building, called the group's ac-
tions “a demonstration of support for
withdrawing academic credit from
ROTC."

Others in the crowd indicated that
they opposed the presence of the mili-
tary on campus entirely.

The demonstrators lined the hallways
near the front door and watched as
faculty members passed them to enter
the meeting in a lecture room. During
the meeting the faculty voted to recom~
mend withdrawal of credit from ROTC
and to set up a committee to review
the ROTC program in detail.

Some of the students carried signs
protesting the college’s accredidation of
ROTC courses and questioning the pro-
gram’s compatability with liberal arts
values.

One sign readi “if ROTC gets credit,
why not SDS?” Another placard had
only the word “LIFE” drawn on it.

Sophomore Ted Glick stood at the
front door and offered armbands to pr0<
fessors as they entered. The crowd ap-
plauded as about twelve professors ac-
cepted the armbands and put them on.
Several others were hissed when they
refused the armbands.

The students conversed and joked with
each other as they mingled in the hall-
way. Some played with the two dogs

Weston West Elected

Ernest T. Weston, president of CBS,
was elected president of the Council
of House Presidents (Coil-1P), and Jane
West became the new president of AWS,
in Tuesday afternoon’s election attended
by 63% of all women and 53% of men.
Jane West, running as a writein candi-
date, entered the race later than any of
the candidates. Her immediate reason
was “to give the campus an alternative
to voting for the one person who has
signed up."

The AWS — CoiHP candldacies were
marked by a reevaluation of the impor-
tance of AWS and Com? in the light of
the earlier referendum on abolishing
SGA which was defeated a month ago.
Weston, Mike Penzer and Bruce Nissen,
running for com? and Sally Hamann
and Jane West, for AWS president all
saw the position as a connection between
the Senate, the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, and the dorms. Weston stated at in-
formal discussion session on Saturday
night. “Grinnell can serve as a vehicle
for the President, the faculty, and the
trustees. . .COIHP should be something
that every student can use as a means
to his own benefit." Weston, a Gary, ind.
sophomore, wanted the council to reflect
upon the needs of individuals and
groups in halls.

Write-in candidate Jane West, a junior
from Springfield, Mo. was interested in
"a more academic, as opposed to pre
dominantly social outlook” in her cams
paign, and shared a concern with AWS'
communication with students with Sally
Hamann. Both candidates also agreed
that the Sex Education lecture series
should be continued. Hamann was inter-
ested in promoting “education within
the dorms” such as the dinners held in
Main for professors. Jane West won by
I 24% margin.

Form Committee lot “Detailed Review,"
Final Recommendation Will go o Trustees

By MICHAEL BRANDON
Air Force ROTC courses will no longer receive academic
credit at Grinnell if a motion passed Monday by the faculty meets
with the approval of President Glenn Legge’tt and the Board of

Trustees.

0n the close vote of 47-40 (with 6 absten-
tions) the faculty passed the lollowlng
motion:

“(Resolved) that, eiteetivc Septem-

her 1, 1970, Grinnell College (will)

no longer grant academic credit for
participation in AFROTC courses.“

The motion to withdraw ROTC credit
was made by History professor Gregory
Gurolf at a March 10 faculty meeting,

Before passage on Monday, the motion
was amended to postpone the date of ef-
lectlveness until next year at the sug-
gestion of faculty chairman Joseph F.
Wall (History).

Wall later explained to the 58:13 that
the amendment would enable students
presently enrolled in the ROTC pro<
gram to receive credits they may need
to graduate.

Due to the wording of the motion, in-
coming students this fall might be able
to enroll in ROTC courses and receive
credit for two semesters, Wall said.

After Completing action on the first
motion, the faculty on a voice vote ap-
proved the following motion made by
Professor James D. Kissane (English);

“(Resolved) that the faculty (will)

lnstniet its chairman to appoint a

committee to review in detail the

AFROTC program at Grinnell and to

report to the faculty so that it may

make, by the time of the next regular
trustees meeting (June 1), recom-
mendations to the President and
the Board of Trustees concerning
the continuance or termination of the

College’s contract with the AF-

ROTC.”

On Tuesday Professor Wall appointed
tour professors to the committee estab-
lished by the Kissane motion. They
are Prolessors Karl DeLong (Biology),
William S. Vanderpool (Sp. 8: Tin),
Neal A. Milner (Pol. Sci), and Kissane,
’who will act as chairman. The commit-
tee has not yet met nor does it know
what approach it will take in consider-
ing the status of ROTC at Grinnell.

Arraignment Set

In “Playboy” Case

The eight Grinnell students who alleg-
edly disrobed during a lecture by a re-
presentative of Playboy magazine in
Gates Hall on Feb. 5 will be arraigned in
Montezuma on April 14.

The students, who are charged with
“indecent exposure,” will appear before
Judge R. G. Yoder in Poweshiek County
District Court.

Charges against a ninth student were
dismissed at a preliminary hearing in
Grinnell on March 26.

Indecent exposure is an indictable
misdemeanor under iowa law carrying
a penalty of six months imprisonment or.
a $200 fine.

putting the first motion in limbo," latest.
dent Leggett believes.

“Although the first motion made it
clear that the majority of the faculty,
have expressed opposition to credit in
the present program, some might change
their minds" alter the committee makes
its recommendation, he said.

Leggett speculated that the committee
might recommend greater power of fa.
culty review over ROTC courses and
grant credit only to certain courses or
grant some sort of concurricular credit.

Asked if he personally opposed the
presence of the military at Grinnell,
Leggett replied, “Not at this time.”

Who would have the final say on wheth.
er or not ROTC will receive credit is iiol
completely clear, One section of the
bylaws of the trustees delegates to the
faculty the power to “cooperate with the
President in making the educational pas
licies of the college. . .”

Another section of the bylaws states
that “Initiative in the t . . abolition of
departments or divisions shall be in the
hands of the President,” who may ask
the faculty for an expression of opinion.

However, the bylaws state,: Final
authority shall rest in the board."

Leggett indicated that he will coopc
erate with the faculty in making a re-
commendation to the trustees concern-
ing the ROTC program.

“However, i have the right to take A
parallel recommendation to the trus<
tees," Leggett explained.

The President said that he has never
disagreed in the past with the faculty on
major recommendations to the Board oi
Trustees. The trustees usually abide by
the recommendations sent to them by the
president and faculty, Leggett said.

A removal of credit from ROTC would
not necessarily constitute a breach of the
contract the college has with the Air
Force, In the contract, the college agrees
“to grant appropriate academic credit
applicable toward graduation for the
successful completion of courses offered
by the Dept. of Aerospace Studies."

Wall told the 5&3 that an Air Force 02¢
ficer indicated last year that “no credit"
could be considered “appropriate."

Under the terms of the contract thd
agreement between Grinnell and the
Air Force "may be terminated at the
completion of any school year by either
party, by giving at least one year's no<
tlce, or sooner by mutual agreement."

The contract states that "the secretary
of the Air Force will prescribe the course
content, conduct of the courses, and pro-
vide the support literature for the . . a
curriculum.”

USAF Lt, Colonel Jack M. Steger‘
Professor of Aerospace Studies at Grin-
nell, said that he wasn't surprised by th
faculty decision to withdraw credit from
ROTC.
