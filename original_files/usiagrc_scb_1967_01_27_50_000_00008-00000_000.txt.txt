next night as Carleton came in
to entertain the Pioneers. Al-

the way, they never got far into
the lead and the Pioneers were
ahead late in the game until
big Clark Marshall made a bas-
ket with about ten seconds to
go to win the game 77-76,

entertained Cornell and threw
a mighty scare into the second-
place Rams. shooting a blister-
