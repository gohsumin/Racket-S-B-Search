As a team the Redmen m
not too big but hit hard and
execute their plays to perlec-
tiou. They are also adept at
controlling the ball. Against
Knox they ran 83 plays. The
average for a team is usually
around 65 plays.

Ripon also has great depth.
Scout Terry Moore noted that

3+1 and just a step in {rout of
another contender, Gates. Gates
is 472 after losing to Dibble and
Clark but is still very much in
the title picture.

The rest or the league has
shown the leaders a low Sill"
prises. East had trouble with
rival West, winning lHi on an
interception at the West three
yard line, and South which
played them to a 6'6 tie at the
hall only to lose in the second
half. Dibble also has had a
number of close games but has
managed to keep winning. Raw-
aon caught Clark, as mentioned
above, and Cowles pinned Smith
in a 0-0 tie Langan has not
really surprised anybody, but
they are showing signs they
might. well, maybe next year.

The second half at the sea
son is just getting started and
the surprises are not over.
Smith may have found them-
selves in their win over Clark
and they have yet to play East.
Clark and Gates also meet the
leader in the second half so
plenty can still happen. Dibble
is probably in the best shape,
with Clark as its only tough op-
ponent leit.

My predictions for today and @-

next week are:
Smith over Gates
Dibble over Rawson
Clark over Langan
Dibble over Clark
West nver CDvIles
Smith over Langao
East over Smith
Gates over North
Rawson over Cowles
Dibble and Langan. tossrup
Gates over Cowles
Clark over West 7

their second string quarter-
back, a sophomore. is at least
as good or better than their
starter. This is generally re-
ﬂected in their whole line—up.
Moore added that Ripon was
only ahead 10-0 at half-time but
their superior depth lead to the
35 point barrage in the second
half.

The Redmen mix their plays
well although they still love to
throw the ball. Against Knox
they tried 29 passes. The whole
Pioneer secondary will have to
be sharp for the pigskin is

back, and to the hallback in

Coach Bowers considers the
Pioneers underdogs in this
battle but it is not willing to
concede anything. He said
that the Pioneers have a dell-
nite chance in the game for
victory with a great team er.
tort. He mentioned that the
practices have been spirited
and the squad seems eager
to show that they have the
ability to he a giant-killer.

Last week the Pioneers were
alighny less than giant killers.
Due mainly to the strong run-
ning of Bob Watt. John Eus—
well, Dick Lamb, and Rick
Weeks the Pioneers carried a
23-21 lead late in the fourth
quarter. Watt returned a kickoff
in the second quarter ninety
yards to give the Pioneers an
8-7 lead. Weeks scored two
touchdowns on quarter-
back sneaks, and Lamb and
Eusweii were grounding out
yardage tor the Pioneers all
day.

With about nine minutes left
in the game the Pioneers were
driving, with the two point lead,
toward a clinching touchdown.
