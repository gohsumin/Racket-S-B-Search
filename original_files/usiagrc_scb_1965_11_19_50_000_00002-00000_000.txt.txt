ii an. Lecture Raises Dilemma:
Which Class Requirement to Obey

To the Editor:

l remarked with anticipation tiiat
Dr. Smith’s tinal lecture was listed
-on the social calendar [01'8 pm. on
Tuesday. Excellent, 1 would be able
to attend . . . but my hopes were
untounded; the lecture was actual.
ly scheduled for ll am, at which
hour 1 had an examination (but l
reel that the importance of the
class would prohibit absence in
any event). Thus, for the second
time this year, l was compelled to
rorego the pleasure ot a lecture
strongly recommended by two of
my professors as pertinent to class
work, as well as intellectually stiin-
ulating.

Why does the dean’s office per.
sist in scheduling lectures tor ll
a.in.7 lllust the conscientious stu-
dent he taced with the dilemma
of whether he should attend his
class or a worthwhile lecture?
Were there only a few 11 am.
classes, the reasons tor scheduling
a lecture at that time might barely
outweigh the objections. However,
since the classes which meet at
that hour number more than
twenty, I am sure that I am not the
only one who has been distressed
by this predicament. it the college
tools that the lecture is worthwhile,
it should make attendance possible
tor all students.

Parent Objects to Journaltsts'
Pictorial Display of Poverty

To the Editor:

l am amazed that ci-innell stu-
dents could so invade privacy, so
insult human dignity, so endanger
collegeconimunity relations as to
print the three photographs of
urinnell residents and houses in
the November 5 issue at the
Scarlet And Black in so many parts
or our country people are crying
,tor help to get out or impossible
situations that it seems superfine
our to go peeping into the private
lives of people who may be con-
tent as they are, Also one does
not usuauy take advantage at the
naivete ot the elderly.

As for the child in the messy
backyard, are the students positive
that he is less happy than it ll:
had a well-groomed yard? Such an
assumption, without going deeper,
is pretty materialistic. May 1 sug-
gest thatthe rive eager students
take their cameras into some of the
dormitory rooms at the college, it

messiness is the criterion of the’

underprivileged, my guess is that
they can rind rooms which will tar
surpass anything they can rind in
the town ot Grinnell.

To the Editor:

William James did an essay

War." (The Popular Science
Monthly, 1910). Gtrinnell’s Viol.

hit upon the aesthetic equivalent
of war.

1 am setting out, lnolishly, to write that which
has never been rend. For as long a tilne as men have
been able to write, it has been written, yet never
read. It is the humblest of realities, so muted and
plain that its authority is neither respected nor be-
lieved. As a lover's mistrust is the germ of gro-
tesque jealousies, so is this unbelier the germ or an.
other hind or insanity, an inverse reality so mon-
strous and absurd that the most exquisite gesture
of the mind is not equal to it. Rationality llees trom
ii. the senses are blown out by the overload. To
speak to such dealness is tutile. So l am writing to
myself, knowing that words were never adequate
to this purpose. But we are all mud; we do not read
signs oi the times. Words are. now, all we have. 1
therefore confess a bastard hope; that someone will
read. [his time.

Charles Rutledge, a Small and wiry man nick-
named “Sneakers," was a soldier. An intantryman,
World War II and Korea. After his name, this was
the first. thing he told me about himself, Loothlessly
shouting as we bounced in the back at a pickup
truck through chilly early-morning mists. i met him
that morning in a pit; he was stooped over a shovel,
excitedly scraping loose dirt trom a ledge, as it high
rank were about to lay a foot there, while above us
on the edge stood the foreman, an exconvict, on in-
credibly base and brutal tyrant. Al tirst I admired
this laborer, who took on the most meaningless
task with the zeal of a high school football player.
Among these rnmhling beasts he seemed to display
one of the more elaborate human attributes: pur-
pose. But he was always the same, and the source
of his ambition bé‘Came obscure. it battled me; he
was drilting in some sort of illusion. This crew had
no cause but to waste time, no common objective
but 5 pm, no sense of camaraderie. He began to
irritate me, linally l despised him. He yielded
readily, and with pride, to the foreman’s most in-
sulting thrusts or authority. But my contempt tunied
to pity, One late afternoon I watched Charles
scramble up a dry bank of earth and knew: he was
not building a highway, he was lighting a war. These

ditches dug for drainage pipe were mockeups of the
trenches.

Charles had a brother, Alfred. Alfred also had
served through two wars. Alfred’s stooping shoulders
carried a great burden of Weariness. His face,
swarthy and grlmacing, was carved deeply with
years of woe. He spoke to me oilen, saying. "Do
you think you’re going to get to like it, Willie!”
with a comic New England cadence. Alfred, too, was
obedient, but not to other men. He was obedient to
the impartial advance or destiny and necessity, He
spent a week in jail, tor something he didn’t do. He
worked quiet and continuously all day. He knew that
time goes by no matter what. He were those in-
tantry pants, heavy with pockets, every day. I
guessed they were as old as the war, (or they were
strewn with patches. One alteration late we stood
together in the rain; we had been driving stakes
inlo the roadbed all day, and he turned to me with
a broken smile: “Do you think you're going to like
it, Willie!” And again I knew: the simple jest that
had preserved the sanity or soldiers {ell dead upon
me.

And so I remembered, a counselor at summer
camp, tall Johnny Nelson. A beautiful Albino, a Billy
Budd and an Odysseus, with a jaw that stood for-
ward with valiant strength. He wouldn't talk about
the war. (He was a marine in Korea; I once over—
heard him tell how he watched ten of his buddies
lose their . i .) Then one evening the camp director
insisted that he tell the campers about his war ex»
pcriences, around a campfire. He talked, about
starving and naked children, until he began to weep,
The little boys giggled. l was alraid the older boys
and men were ashamed. Al sunset the ﬂag waitzed
down the tlagpole to o bugle call. Johnny stood
on the hill and watched, motionless until the flag was
taken off the Chain, folded and was out of sight.
when we were running again he was still standing,
watching. Patriotism? Homage to a torce im«
measurable greater than himself, to an unfathom-
able mystery and evil worthy or devotion.

From these I have learned this about war:
nothing in heaven or earth can make it right.
