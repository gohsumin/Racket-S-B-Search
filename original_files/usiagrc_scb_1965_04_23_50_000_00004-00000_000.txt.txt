What urns do Air Force scientists get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of course the principal

What's the best way to start an Air Force career? An
excellent way—the way l started—is through Air Forte

Crossett's Non-Fine Arts Non-Lecture
Downtrods Uptempo ‘Downtown’

By Connie Simon

Elbows resting atop a huge
stereo record player imported lor
the occasion. John Crﬂssett
(classical languages) delivered his
promised “non-lecture" Wedncs
day night in the North Lounge.

Crossett delighted his assembled
“nonaudrence” with a warning
torblddlng note-taking, and ex-
pressed his desire to make the non-
lecture as non-academlc as pos-
sible. In particular, he said, “There
will be no academic jargon used
here.”

He began by distributing mimeo-
graphed papers among the listene
ers. The papers were copies of
Tony Hatch’s many-splendored
pop song. “Downtown," which he
used as the theme Elf his nun-lec~
ture.

“I won't be here long and I
won't do this again" were Cros-
sett’s words as he began his hour-
long satire on Everything. He pro-
ceeded with hilarious abandon to
analyze the song’s lyrics in “mock-
intelleetualese," equating “Down-
lawn” to ”the return to the anb"
and “mobility and freedom of
American Society.”

At lecture's end Grossett ﬂipped
on the juke box version of “Down—
town" tor the third time that even-
ing saying that he “wanted to

No Campaign Probe
Says SGA Session

By Ted Lemaire

Most of this week’s Advisory
Councll meeting was devoted to
discussing a motion made by Les-
ter Tobias to investigate campaign
tactics.

His motion, as amended by Steve
Kent, would have established a
committee to investigate “the costs
incurred by a candidate tor the or
[ice of SGA President, and the
means of reducing them, and the
inadaquacy at present methods for
regulating SGA elections; . . that
this committee recommends leg-
islation in these problem areas,
should it deem legislation neces-
sary."

Dan Bucks introduced an amend-
ment virtually disregarding cam-
paign methods and focusing on the
problem of financial costs to he in-
vestigated by the ﬁnance commit-
tee, Uf which he is a member.

The Bucks amendment was
passed by a Vote of 9-5. Tobias
stated alter the defeat, “This is a
direct threat and insult to the ex-
isting student government system
and its supposed democracy."

The amended motion passed
by a 16-1 vote.

The election reform legislation
arose from previous campaigns in
which alleged threats caused a can»
dictate to withdrawi The Tobias
mutlon would have curbed such
practices.

According to SGA President
Jerry Goddard, such incidents are
more regrettable for individual
students than for the strident body
and the school.

About the questlon of threats
Goddard said, “No threat has ever
prohibited anyone from running.
Threats don’t cut the mustard on
this campus. I don‘t believe this
is a tenable assertion.”
