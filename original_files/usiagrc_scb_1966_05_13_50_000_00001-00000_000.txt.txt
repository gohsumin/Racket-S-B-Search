Speakers Dominate Senate Session

Leggett, Thompson
Address Senators

By DICK CHADY

Student government ended a “bureau-
oratic but necessary" phase Wednesday
night by hearing tinal committee re-
ports and special talks by President
Leggett and Dean Thompson. About so
other students attended the session,
held Ill ARH auditorium, to hear the
two addresses.

After committee and cabinet reports,
President Leggett told the group that he
was ending the year “wiser but not
sadder.” Speaking inrormally and with-
out notes, he discussed the live proh-
[ems faced by college presidents in gen-
era! and himselr in particular.

The first problem is that of support.
Leggett said that because students pay
Dilly 64.5 per cent of the total costs,
the remaining amount must come ironl
other sources. He said that what mo-
tivates persons to support the college
ls an interest in Grinnell as an cit-going
institution, not whether or not it suits
their notion of morality Quality, not
pleasing conservative interests, is what
’ draws support in the long run.

The second problem he mentioned

Tlre Year In Retrospect, 0r:

'Involvement v

it was a year or breaking in a new
president at Grinnell, a year that saw
government spend most of its year
proudly defending the status quo in or-
der to give the new president a chance
to get both root on the ground.

It was a year that saw the word “in-
volvement" assume almost sacred pm
portions and nearly everyone wanted
nearly everyone else to get involved, A
group of hopeful lreshmen even started
a committee based on involvement (The
Grinnell Committee for Student Involve-
ment). Presumably they became so in-
volved in other things that this commit-
tee quietly vanished from the Grinnell
scene.

Anyway, in keeping with the theme of
involvement, another group of Grinnel~

. Status Quo'

lians (the soecalled Des Moines Project)
started work in the slums section of Des
Moines. Outward signs or progress were
few and whereas work over the summer
had been one of the early plans that idea
was dropped several weeks ago.

Meanwhile, back on campus, North
Campus, ils problem and what or what
not to do about it dominated the local
scene.

With the spring came the new birth in
student government. Everyone wanted
change and no candidate ran on a plat-
form at detending the status quo. A pro-
liferation of committees were formed to
discuss everything from radio stations
to bookstores.

'Ad Hoc' Report
Given to Leggeti'

By BOB HODIERNE ‘1

The Ad Hoc Committee on Hall Re-
organization this morning gave Presi-
dent Glenn Leggett their recommendat-
tiuns on the much vaunted, much talk-
ed-about “North Campus Problem."

The proposals, which Steve Kent, SGK»
president and memher ot the committee,
said are “relatively modest structural
innovations and improvements.” sug-
gest that the college adopt a system
whereby freshmen on North Campus
draw {or rooms at the end of their
freshmen year in much the same way
all women do on South Campus.

Alter drawing a room tor their sopho-
more year, the male student would be
allowed to remain in that hall for the
rest ni his stay at Grinnell provided he
wanted to. The propnsals suggest liberal- _
izmg the process by which a student can
move from one hall to another.

The proposals to Leggett say this
new system would “have an ettect upon
the closed-society aspects of some of the
men's halls without destroying their
traditional integration and seltegovern-
ing independence."

Kent, in commenting on this part or
the proposal, said that it “will not dis«
rupt in any appreciable way the living
patterns developed by present men stu:
dents." .

Leggett will now consider these pro-
posals — for they are no more than pm-
posals — and then make the final decl-
sion as to what action, it any, should be
