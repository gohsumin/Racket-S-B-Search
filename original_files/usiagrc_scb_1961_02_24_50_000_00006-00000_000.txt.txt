Cuba. Our first stop was Vei-adero Beach, formerly vary popuVl

tion for every citizen a reality, ‘

That evening we stopped at Playa Giant AS We pulled into

iis everywhere. Over 3,000 people had waited all afternoon to
see the Americans who came as friends. We walked to the city
hall, and we received an honorary Cuban flag. The people be-
gan the chants that characterize the revolution "venccremas"
(we shall succeed). But instead of “Cuba si, Yankee no,” some
one started chanting, “Cuba si, Yankee si, lmpcrlallsmo_no,”
Perhaps. if anything, these Six words characterize the attitude
which I found that Cubans have toward Americans. They want
very much to be our friends, and they hold nothing against the
citizens of the U. S., but they feel at they have very well»
founded grievances with American business interests and with
the American Government.

There are several questions which Americans are asking
about Cuba. Perhaps because of the reading 1 have done and
because of my trip to that country, 1 can suggest possible aris—
wers.

IF CUBA WANTS PEACE, THEN ,WHY DOES SHE SEEM
BELLIGERENT? WHY DOES SHE PREPARE FOR lNVAs-
IONS WHEN NO INVASIONS SEEM LIKELY?

The answer to this is simpler than most people believe. in
the first place. Cubans know Latin American history. They ii.-
member such things as the Flatt. amendment, and above all the

Alnericansenglneered overthrow of the government in Guatemala
about a years ago. They also have more information about our
present actions in Latin America than American Citizens do. They
have long known about our secret training base in Guatemala
first reported in the Nation, The New York Times, and finally
the Jan. 27 issue of Times magazine. Time has this to say about
the subject “The Erente tcounter.revolutionary organization)
is making impressive preparations: guerilla training camps in
Florida and Guatemala, arms-carrying FT boats that average a
trip a week to Cuba, an air group of some so flycrs who report-
edly fly out of the mystery field at Retalheleu in Guatemala and
the inactive U. 5. Marine Corps Cpa Locka airbase in Florida
. . . The Prente apparently gets all the U. S, financial aid to
Cuba's underground (estimated to range from $135,000 monthly
to as high as $500,000 on occasions) . . . i, l

It seems unlikely that U s. Marines will invade Cuba, but
if counter-revolutionarics trained on our soil and paid by our
tax money land in Cuba, is it any less an invasion by that
United States? By constantly announcing to the world that
the United States is financing invaders and itself plans to in-
vade, Castro very effectively makes an invasion impossmlei
world opinion would never allow it.

WHY, IF THE CUBA-N REVOLUTION lS DOING so
MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE, DOES THE UNITED STATES
OPPOSE 1T so VEHEMENTLY'I

This is, the hardest question to answer, for nothing which
can be posited seems rational, Some say that we oppose Castro
because he no longer allows freedom of the press and because
the revolutionary government has executed ooo war criminals
But can this be true when we support Batista with arms and
money to fight Castroiﬁatlsta who is reported to have murder-
ed zoiooo Cubans and tortured countless others"

If we are so worried about the forms of democracy why
do we support Spain, Portugal, Honduras. Formosa, Etc? The
answer must lie in Cuba’s actions toward the United States
What unique thing has Cuba done to us? Only one—they have
taken property away from American business concerns, some of
whom charged exorbitant prices and inadc ciiortmous profits
while doing almost nothing for the people of Cuba.

Was it worth it to allow starvation unemployment, disease
and illiteracy to continue to preserve the property rights 0[ a
few Americans. The people thought not, so they took over

American industry. The United States retaliated by its ecol‘iomic‘

embargo.

WHY Is THERE A TRAVEL BAN 0N CUBA?

The most common argument is that Cuba is dangerous and
that Cubans hate Americans. From my experience, 1 can say
that I did not find this to be true. Yet the real proof lies in a
comparison with other countries. It we are worried about the
safety of our citizens why don't we impose a travel ban on
Belbgium during the recent riots therefithere are no riots in
Cu 3.

Only those trips to Cuba are allowed which
best interests of the United States." Unfortunately the real aris—
wer to this question seems inescapable. The United States gov»
ernlnent does not. want Americans to see what is really happel‘h
mg in Cuba.

Several other questions arise from a study of the Cuban
situation. If we believe in the principles laid down in our Dace
lai-ation of independence and our Constitutionilhe basic rights
of man to life. liberty and the pursuit of happinessAthen why
do we try to destroy the Cuban Revolution? Why does our press,
which claims it is free and objective, print half-truths about

Cuba; wliv the emotion-packed epithets such as “Castro’s boissl

terous, lefteleanlng Cuba" and “Castro—land?”

Why does the pres leave out the story of what the l‘evolur
tion is doing for thc peoplel Why do we hate the Cuban Revolu-
tion when our own break with England brought confiscation of
property from counterrrevolutiunarlcs then called Tories? Are
we hypocrites, or are we just ignorant? is the United states
an arsenal of freedom as it claims, or is it just an arsenal?
