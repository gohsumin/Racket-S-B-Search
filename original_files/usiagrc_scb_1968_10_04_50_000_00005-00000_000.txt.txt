’ h rash of injuries to students
ls well as faculty on the Grin-
nell campus has left people with
casts, crutches and taped ap<
pendages.

Mr, Crossett, after giving his
lecture on virginity last week,

was attacked by a group of anti-
.virginity people on his way
home. In defending himself
against these people ("I’m not
lure if they were boys or girls,"
he said), Mr. Crossett sprained
his thumb, Although no bones
were broken, his thumb was
taped by the doctor to prevent
lurther injury. (The sea thanks
Mr. Crossett for his account. In
keeping with his wishes, the fol-
lowing line from the poem “The
Exaggerator" by Mark Van
Doren is presented — “The
truth to him was like a fan." Mr.
Crossett told the 5&3 that he
has always felt that Van Doren
wrote the poem about him.)

'A broken leg was the result of
being hit by a car ior Mary Kay
Kasary, '72. Saturday, Sept. 14,
she was struck by the car on
the corner of 6th and Broad.
The ensuing fracture has left
her leg in a cast and Mary kay
on crutches or in a wheelchair.
Because she is tired of answer-
ing questions, Mary Kay plead-
ed: “Please tell people that, no,
my toes never get cold. No, my
leg hasn't started to itch yet.
When I get out of the cast, l'll
think of many other ways to get
plastered."

Marilyn Mulligan, '72, was
playing volleyball several weeks
ago when her leg was jumped
on. She Went to the health cen-
ter after it started hurting. From
there she went to the doctor,
who wrapped her ankle in an
ace bandage. The pain continued,
on she went back to the health
center and was sent back to the
doctor, He sent her to the hos-
pital for x-rays. Although no
bones were broken, Marilyn had

\_. ‘
shattered the nerve ends and
twisted the tendons in the lower
part of her leg.

With his arm in a sling, Ernie
Rose, '71, is out of the football
starting line-up for about two
more weeks. Ernie tore the
muscles in his shoulder last
Wednesday. Part of the therapy
he has been getting includes
ultra-sound (the sending of
sound waves through the torn
muscles) and heat treatments.

One of the more severe injur-
ies of an IM football game ll
Reggie Graham’s ripped liga-
merits in his ankle, Twice a day,
for about two weeks now, Reg-
gie has had whirlpool treatments
to aid the healing of his injury.
This is a repeat performance for
Reggie. Last year he tore the
same ligaments and was in a
cast for six weeks. It ruined his
diving for the season. Fortunate-
ly, this year's injury occurred
early enough for him to be in
shape when the swimming sen-
son starts.

How To Apply To Graduate School

By DALE B. TERRY
Director of Admissiom

Application to graduate
Ichool is essentially no differ
but from the procedure involved
in making college application.
The student must first deter-
mine, in conference with his
major adviser or others in
whom he has confidence, which
lchools are best suited to his
needs, A collection of graduate
school catalogs is available in
the Financial Aid and Place-
ment Office located at the south
end of Burling Library base-
merit.

Once the student has selected
schools best suited to his needs,
it remains to determine appli-
cation and scholarship dead-
lines. Write to the appropriate
officer at the school concerned
and request the necessary
forms. Graduate school dead-
lines for both admission and
scholarship purposes vary wide-
ly and students should have
their selection made and the
rorms in hand by December lst
to assure that they will not
miss specific deadlines.

The tests required for err-
trance to various graduate
lchools will be noted in the ap-
propriate catalogs. .Tliii may

involve the Graduate Record
Examination and/or Advanced
Test in the major field, and
At some schools the Miller An-
alogies Test will be required.
The dates for the GRE upti-
tude and advanced test are
listed below, and students who
need to take the Miller Anal-
ogies Test should Contacter'r
Obermiller to make specific
arrangements, since that test
is usually administered on an
individual basis.

GRE dates:

October 28, 1968
December 14, 1968
January 18, 1969
:Fehniary 22, 1969
April 26, 1959
July 12, 1969

Application forms for the test
are available in the registrar's
office. Those wishing to take
the GRE on October 16, 1968
must have these aplication
forms sent in by October 8.

For information concerning
special tests such as the Law
School Admissions Test, the
Medical School Aptitude Test,
etc, contact the appropriate
pro—professional adviser.

Some words of advice:

1. Do not Wait until the last
minute to ask professors for
recommendations to graduate
school. The early part of our

second semester, which is I
busy time for our professors,
may coincide with the deadline!
for completion of application
forms.

2, Check examination require
ments and make appropriate
arrangements for the necessary
examinations before the dead-
line.

3. Give the Registrar's Office
adequate notice and clear direc-
tions concerning where you
want your transcript sent. If
you will need a supplementary
transcript, please notify the
Registrar's Office before you
leave school in the spring.

4, If a financial statement I:
required by the graduate
school before a fellowship can
be awarded, submit it at least
eight weeks before the school
deadline.

5. Many graduate schools re-
quire a separate fellowship,
NDEA, or assistantship applica-
tion. In some cases you may
need to write directly to the
Chairman of the graduate
school department regarding
assistantships.

6. Don't minimize the impor-
tame of a well written applica-
tion beginning with the very
first letter you write to the
graduate school.

7. Check with the appropriate

"A Night of the Opera"
—-starring the Marx Brothers (1935);

When Arieti asked me to re-
view this Marx Brothers clas«
sic, horse sense told me to beg
off. You will understand why
when I admit that I still find
it more natural to speak of
"movies" than of "films."
That's about as out of it a!
you can be. But, as you see.
curiosity as to why the Marx
Brothers should rate so high
with the knowing young pre-
vailed.

The most obvious and prob-
nbly the most crucial thing
about the Marx Brothers’ hu-
rnor is that it is utterly and
gloriously low-brow. Now the
essence of good “low-brow"
comedy is not simply the ab-
sence of sophistication but the
fun it takes at the expense of
high-brow pretensions. That is
the point of nearly all of the
Marx Brothers' gags and un-
tics. In this respect, as in all
else, Groucho is the key man.
I recall a scene, from another
movie, that epitomizes his ge-
nius for shocking human gran-
deur into dumb passivity. He is
working as a hotel desk clerk
and some pompous ass atoms
up to him saying, “You people
can't treat me like this! i am
owner of the largest chain of
laundries in the world!” “Laun-
dries, eh?" says Groucho, nev-
er daunted as he rips off his
shirt and thrusts it at the luv
dignant swell. “Then take this
and have it back by Wednes-
dayl"

"A Night at the Opera" in
really a series of variations on
this theme. It takes us on n
tour of all the customary
haunts of Privilege, but alwayl
with u iow»brow twist: the ritzy
dining room (a scene for
Groucho's unabashed wise-
cracks): the ocean liner (with
the colorful revelry of steerage
immigrants in contrast to the
sedate luxury of first class);
and, above all, that bastion of
“cult-yah," the opera house.
The opera is a perfect scene for
me Marx Brothers’ low»brow
sabotage, and they make the
most of it. Groucho is insuffer<
ably gauche and irresistibly
funny leaning out of his box to
offer a dime to the stony-faced
swell who returns his program
to him. Chico and Hal-pa al-
most literally tum Ii Trovatoro
— that lugubrious tragedy —
Into a three-ring circus. It's
all summed up when — owing

to a substitution of scores -—
the opening measures of the
overture are suddenly trans-
formed into a raucous render.
ing of “Take Me Out to the
Ballgame."

That the Marx's low-brow
comedy should strike a sympa-
thetic chord in numbers of the
current student generation is
easy to account for — on one
level at least: it appeals to
their particular sentimentality
and disillusionment. Chico and
Harpo, those sweet - natured
clowns who make children
laugh and weep with piano and
harp, are the perpetual iugi.
tives from the hirelings of the
high-brow establishment: stew-
ards, doorman, waiters, guards,
and — of course — the cops.
If today's radical finds his sen-
timents confirmed in these two,
he must surely revel in
Groucho's brazen insouciance
as he discomfits the respeo<
table. No innocent fugitive, but
u nervy lnterloper named Otis
P. Driftwood, he is out to beat
the swells at their own game.
But he does it with a style
no enemy of the affluent estabv
lishment can fail to appreciate.
His shoe polish mustache is an
flagrant an outrage to prim
propriety us the raunchiest set
of sideburns, his obscene cigar
is as hold an affront to solemn
decency as the weediest reefer.
Anyone aspiring to epater lo
bourgeois has got to admit
Groucho was there first, From
that initial moment when we
see him ogling the decolletago
of a wealthy patroness from hll
semi—crouch we recognize in
him the apotheosis of the urn-
couth.

There are worse ways of has
ing entertained than by comedy
of this sort, Yet it is anothel
of many recent youthful enthu-
slasms that prompt me to hope
we do not iorget that a high-
brow cultivltion of a low-brow
taste can never quite be the
thing itself. To identify with
something isn‘t the same in
becoming identical to it — any,
more than playing in her dairy
could make Marie Antoinette a
real milkmaid. In short, it
won't do to confuse a style with
a condition. So much for moral-
izlng; corny and predictable an
it is, “A Night at the Opera“
could hardly be called a great
film. but itducs makes. good
night at the movies.
