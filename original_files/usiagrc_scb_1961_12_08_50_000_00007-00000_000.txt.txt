a fallout shelter under the cons
ditions of nuclear warfare. l

I am more than ready to grant
that it a nuclear bomb were
dropped on Omaha. Neb, every—
one would have time to adiourn
in an orderly manner to the
basement of Itoberts Theater in
time to escape the harmful ets
fects of radiation and thereby be
saved. With my poverty of tech
nical knowledge, I could not
risk approaching the issue from.
this slant. And, besides, if one,
digs deep enough, . .etc. i

The efficiency of a fallout
shelter, however. is not a sig—
nificant point in our decision for
or against constructing one. I
believe there are more impors
tant factors to be considered
here, factors concerning the

psychological effects of a fall-'

I, for one, would prefer to
have the money proposed for
the construction of a fallout
shelter employed in an eftort
to deter war I feel that my love
attics lie in the present world
civilization rather than in a
postsnuclear state of barber-ism,
and I cast my lot for the pres—
ervation of this civilization.

To the Editor:

I have been disturbed by a.n
impression I have gained over
the past few weeks, and I wish

to express this feeling, apropos
of recent campus discussions.
I've noticed, from reading let-

,lcach applicant after reviewing
lthe letter of application. Selecs
ion is .based upon a number of
'eonsiderations including academ-
‘ic record, extra-curricular a—
,chievenients at Grinnell, hobbies
:and interests, and ability to

out shelter and a decision as to tcrs to the editor, carrying on represent Grinncll abroad.
l

, exactly where one's loyalties lie. discussions with People of d

it appears to me that the Averse opinions, and just geneI-l

argument over the construc-
tion or a iallout shelter rc-
diices itseli to two indeterm-
inahle iactors: will the meter—
in! appearance of a fallout ,
shelter psychologically prepare
us for nuclear war to such an

ally eavesdropping on the can—
did thoughts of iellow students,
that we as students are not yet
ready in many i spects to

calmly sit dawn and talk things
i

out. We seem solely Concerned

isensibihties in high gear, ready
lto toss out old ideas that hat-c
,bccome too tight across the
‘Shoulders and to replace them
iwith new ones that better tit

lcul‘ expanding world. At the
i

extent that war will thereby ‘wiih expressing 0“,. Own broad_,same time we intist be able to

become more probable? and,
is nuclear war so imminent
that lailure to prepare ade-
quately for it amounts to mad-
ness'!

The conclusion one comes to
here, whether to tight tor the
salvation of the present state of
things or prepare for a new Con—
dition, defines one’s loyalties.

I believe that before anyone

minded, unbiased Ideas without
givmg thought to what the per-
son across the table is saying,

It seems to me that we too
often tend to lose sight of what
we are at school for; to lose
sight of our responsibility to
the very word "student," We

must enter each new class, each

new experience, with all our

irecognize and evaluate other
‘thoughts that stand the test.

‘ How much we are able to abs
sorb, how well we can assimi—
late what we receive, and to
‘\\‘hat exlem We can put into
action our increased awareness
‘will determine the degree of
our real education.
