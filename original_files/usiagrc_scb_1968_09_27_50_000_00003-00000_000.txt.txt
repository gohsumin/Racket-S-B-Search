Non-Profit Institutions Face
Takes on Protitable Sidelines
In Controversial Court Case

By MAREN STEWART

The case of the United States
vs. the Myrna Foundation has
not yet come to court. This

case will determine whether a .

non - protit institution, like
Grinnell, can engage in mon-
sy-making businesses and pre-
serve its tax exemption.

Should the government win
this case. there is already a
Case prepared against Grinnell
to tax tai-m pioperty that Grin-
nell owns. The houses the col-
legs owns, which are rented to
rlew professors, will also be
lubject to such taxation.

The test case goes Io court
In November. Mr. D0 II I 1 l1
Lambie, Treasurer ot the col.
lege, says there is a trend de
veloping to tax non—proﬁt in-
stitutions, and as a result,
indepen dent colleges may
have to go under iederal and
state control in order to to
main open.

“It used to be thought that
we were aiding the stare and
benetitting the citizenry." stat-
ed Lambie. “But now the tie
mand for taxes is so gleat
that the government is almost
narrow-sighted in its desire to
get new taxes."

Mr. Lambie mentioned that

ette recently built a dormitory.

public ciliclals say is sublect
to mrmal real estate taxes.

Mr. Lambie noted that there
seem to be inconsistencies in
government policy. it the col-
lege invests endowment funds
In stocks or bonds and re-
ceives dividends, no taxes
must he paid on these. but
{arm property is termed an
"unrelated" activity and
therefore is subject to taxa-
tion. '

Other evidence of this new
trend is the foreign travel bill
that was brought up in Con-
gress last year. in this bill
there was a provision to tax
the travel of those doing busi-
ness for nonprofit institutions
which had formerly been ex-
empt lrorn such taxation. Mr.
Lambie said the passage of
such a bill would sanction tax-
atiorl oi the college ior gaso-
line and other items on which
there is an eXClse tax. “There
is no logic in singling that
(travel) out,” said Lambie.

The bill has not yet been
passed by Congress.

Girls, It Wou Can Meet These Requirements
You Won't Be Fair Spinsters

intelligence, attractiveness
and good cooking were the
prime qualities desired in a
wile by Grinnell men accord-
ing to the results of a recent
interview oi 48 college men on
the subject at “What 1 want
my wife to be like."

Three sets at questions were
used in the interview. The
llrst group dealt with lntelll~
gence, beauty, personality,
and a good sense of humor.
The second group dealt with
seriousness and lighthearted-
ness, and the third set asked
the men whether 'they pre<
lerred a blood or u hnmette.
and whether they wanted her
to be able to cook.

Personality important

Personality was listed as the
important qualiﬁcation trom
the tirst set, with intelligence.
beauty, and a good sense of
humor iollowing in order. or
the men interviewed, 32 per-
cent adjudged personality as
the most essential, 26 percent
voted ior Intelligence, 23 per~
cent tor beauty, and 19 per-
cent tor a good sense at hu—
mar.

lo the second group or ques-
tions, every man demanded

that his wito be both serious
and light-hearted instead of
having only one or these attri-
butes.

Blonds Not Popular

The third set at questions
revealed that either there are
no gentlemen on tho Grinneil
campus, or the old adage that
"gentlemen prefer blonds" is
a misleading aphorism, for on-
ly 4 of the 48 men interviewed
wanted a blond wlfs while 20
desired a brunette. The color
oi the hair made no difference
to u husbands-lobe, and one
man asserted that he did not
care what color hair his choice
had, as long as she was not
bald»headed.

Bob “Step" Rushton, ’38, the

sires an intelligent, attractive

given incentive to participate
in a prolessional exchange prn<
gram.

CBS also proposes that there
be a black placement counsel-
lor for black Grinnell students.
Weston comments, "A black
student counsellor is necessary
mainly because of the lack of
black pnolessors. There are
few adults on the Grinnell cam<
put that black students can to-

late tor There are several white.

professors who are being help«

ful Counsellors to black students.
but just as a matter of tact,
they cannot relate to the pre-
dlcament of black students."

The third proposal is that at
a Summer Pilot Program for
black high school students, Till
Woodlawn / Grinneli Program
was to take place over this past
summer but dd not on account
0| dlii'lwltlel In Chicago. Wes<
ton condemns Woodlawn as
“tokenism” since it merely
uses G rln n ell facilities,
but does not involve any
oi the student body or
faculty at Grinneil. Greg Coggs,
who is conferring with Charles
sellers on the subject, is con-
sidering incorporating the Wood
lawn Program into the Upward
Bound program, and perhaps
dropping the Woodlawn Pro-
gram completely. Debbie
Greene described the Upward
Bound Summer Program, which
uses government limits, as “a
lull liberal arts education start—
ing in the lath grade. . .geal'ed
for relevancy to the social seg<
nlent these students come
from” If the Upward Bound
Program is completed success
lully, the student is automati-
cally accepted at the college he

has been prepared tor. css
hopes to coordinate this pro-
grain.

The fourth proposal is that or
recruiting “hard core blacks"
kthose who have been reared in
ghettos, and are overlooked be-
cause they are economically
handicapped When asked if a
person who has attended a ghet<
to high school would be we
pared to cope with Grinnell aca-
demically, w e s to n replied,

"Yes. with the help of a pru<
gram like Upward Bound."

CBS proposes that a black
person be placed on the ad»
missions committee. They hope
tor a black pmlessor or alum<
nus to be placed on the com<
mittee, or an Admissions Coun-
seller who is black. “This per-
son must be in a position to
make decisions," stresses Wes<
ton.

CBS hopes the college will re-
cruit more black professors.
and otters to help in this re-
cruitment. “Few black pr0<
fessors come," states Weston,
"an account of the town situa«
tiou‘ and lack oi encourage-
ment."

The seventh proposal involves
the establishlllent ot a black
newspaper and a black library.
CBS will finance the library
with the $400 in funds Contri-
buted by SGA. The newspaper.
which is supposed to come out
in about a week, will not only
be’ concerned with black stu-
dénis oi Grinneli, but with the
national Situation of all Blacks.
The library will either be incor-
porated as part ot Burlillg Ll-
brary, or as a separate library.

On account at the limitations
of the Rockelellel' fund, CBS
plans to organize a Martin
Luther King Scholarship. Funds
