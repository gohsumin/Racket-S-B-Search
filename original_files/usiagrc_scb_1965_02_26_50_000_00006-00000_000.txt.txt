eats and runs. The kids talk a
lot about the new uniOn — it
should be started next year.

Out the Common's back door,
a concrete and brick path leads
to the driveway. Way off, about
a half a block. is Bruce Hail —
the gym. This is a new building
which houses classrooms, a
recreation room, a music
room, a stage, and a swimming
pool, as well as the bleachers
and basketball court that are
the center of everyone' s
thoughts when the team is in
town. Behind Bruce is about
tllreeriourths of a square block
which is supposed to be the site
of the future dormitory and
union. ‘

Between this vacant lot and
the Common is a group of three
white cottages, separated by
red brick paths. The one closest
to the Commons. close enough
that we find ourselves lapping
our feet in time to the juke
box, is where Meg and I live.
It isn't really ours yet. though.
it is haunted by the ghosts of a
theatre prof who called himself
the Colonel and introduced
Sartre to the LeMoyne student
body, and his wife, whose
friends miss her wonderful
meals. If you come to visit us,
just ask for the cottage where
one Donahoes lived; anyone

t Jurisdictional Feud Rages

(Continued [mm Page 1)

“vaguely justified on grounds oi
expediency, convenience, inrgctrul-
ness, psychology, or absence of
testimony at evidence; the relative
value or rationale at these excuses
has uilen seemed in be as less
than effectively penetrating."

Dean James H. Stauss, Acting
President of the College, said in 8
question and answer period at
Wednesday night's Senate meeting
that:

“I know of no agreements that
have been made that say the Stu-
dent dean or faculty committee
must, by reason of law, take a
matter of student conduct and
turn it over to a student court.
However. the deans do have dis-
cretion to do this."

Slauss went on to say:

“Student courts were created
in the student government consti-
tution and linked to student ap—
prehension. That jurisdiction is
clear. Any drought of cases in the
student courts is nourished by stu-
dent enforcement agencies as well
as by the deans."

When asked for his reaction to
Siauss's answers in the jurisdic-
tional and process conflict, Phil
Johnson. SGA President, said, “Dr.
Stauss was speaking for himself
and did not make clear college
policy."

The letters of the primary courts
and executive cabinet to the Fac-
ulty Committee on Student Affairs
demanded a reply by March 3, say-
ln :

ii1r no satisfactory response is
forthcoming by that date, we will

assume that your committee and
the administration of the college

 

have opted for the present sys-
tem ui jurisdiction and procedure.
As we have explained, this system
is not acceptable to us, and we
would he forced to reevaluate
our role within it."

Wednesday aftemoan in a stu-
dent government coffee hour,
Adena Peterson, Chief Magistrate
oi the Women's Primary Court.
and Jerry Goddard. a member of
the Men's Primary Court, both
said that to them, “re-valuate"
meant resign. The implication was
that the other members of the
courts felt the same way.

when asked if he thought the
Faculty Committee could act by
next Wednesday, Stauss said. “I
don't mink they can hash it over
that fast.”

The executive cabinet and the
primary courts, in a joint resolu-
tion that was adopted by the stu-
dent Senaie Wednesday night by
Vale of 294, outlined jurisdiction
saying:

“Any case apprehended by A
Student ofﬁcer shall be heard by
the student court System. unless
the courts refuse jurisdiction or

refer the case to another body.”
The second pm hi the resolu-

tion outlined what the executive
cabinet and the primary courts
(alt should be “due process."

in a letter Wednesday to the
Faculty Committee on Student M»
fairs, the Com? concurred with
the proposals submitted by the
primary courts and the Student
Senate.

The AWS Board was preparing
to sign the same letter as the
paper went to press.

Progress Not Rapid
In Lock Installation

Progress on having lacks put on
women's doors will not be rapid
because there is nothing in the
present budget {or this purpose,
Acting President James H. Slauss
Said this week.

Stauss noted that the budget
must be augmented by the Board
01 Trustees if locks are to he in-
stalled.

Stauss maintained that because
of certain priorities, the adminis-
lraliun “hasn't entered into [I10
necessary consideration" at locks.

If the decisinn is made to install
locks. “the speed of installation
will depend on what Buildings and
Grounds can allot to do the in ,"
he Said.

Waki Praises 5&B’s

Progress in Scope

To the Editor:

The commentary on the Viet
Nam situation by Mri Gerald
Goddard was most welcome.
Though there was nothing es-
pecially new in his analysis, it
was very delightful to find in
the Scarlet and Black‘such an
article dealing with the press-
ing problem with which the
United States is facing now.

If this indicates a change in
the policy of the sail; to try to
liberalize our minds from 10-
calism, it is certainly a pro-
gress for. which i have long
been waiting. Kunio Waki
