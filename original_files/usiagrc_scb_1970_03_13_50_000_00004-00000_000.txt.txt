ming pool with “all the marbles”

Conference Championship by the
largest paint spread in the last
8 years. Grinnell tallied up 5']
points with Carleton. the closest
contender accumulating only 49
points. The Conterencetitle dame
as a perfect finish to a perfect
season for Grinnell’s swimmers.
They won 7 of the 11 events,
setting 2 and tying 1 Conference
records, and establishing 7 new
pool records and 5 Grinnell school
records in the green, wavy
Carleton tank. Every man on
Grinneil's squad turned in a good
ettort under the intense two days
of pressure. The statistics of the

himself, when he unleashed his
6’6” body in two fantastic efforts
to dominate the breaststroke in
the meet.

Before this outstanding climax
to the season, Grinnell had won
every dual meet by at least 20
points, won the Knox relays, the
Grinnell Relays, and the Viking
Olympics. This pertect un-
defeated record is the first such
varsity feat in 10 years of
Grinnell athletics. It is
reasonable to say that this year’s
swimming team is probably one
of the finest athletic teams
Grinnell has ever fielded. If team
spirit, closeness, hard Work, and
victory are indicative of great-
ness, then it is definite that the
1970 Swimmers are No. 1.

What pulled this team to Vic-
tory? The answer is simple and
deeply ingrained in each
swimmer. It is true respect and
admiration for Coach Raymond
J. Ohermiller, better known as
Obe (O-bee). Each swimmer and
diver has dedicated himself to 31/2
months of total physical
exhaustion and mental tensi .

Workaouts this year totaled 165
miles or 14,5201engths of die pool,
and 1,200 pushups and situps.
Most of the team practiced twice
a day throughout a major part
of the season, including 2 weeks
of Christmas vacation. Through
all the exhaustion, lack of am-
bition and depression, that
naturally built up, only one thing
kept the team together and
pushing —Obe. In a team
meeting of 15 dead tired and
scared swimmers the night
before the Conference finals, the
team unanimously dedicated
themselves to Win the Conference
for Obe’s first big swimming
title. They did it and then carried
him around the pool chanting
”Ohe, Obe, Obe. . .l” This team
worked hard and earned every
victory and now we would like
to dedicate the whole season as
a tribute to the one who Worked
the hardest 7 Che! He is No.
