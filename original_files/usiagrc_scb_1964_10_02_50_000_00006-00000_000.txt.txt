ter Ripon drove from its own

Despite the gay pageantry and exuberant support
which the Grinnell College community provided for
its football team last Saturday, the Pioneers lost 25-14
to a good, but certainly not unbeatable Ripon team; A
postmortem might be in the offing, but I’m sure that

‘ every “If they would only have . . .” and ”Why the

hell didn’t he . . .” possible has been dealt with in North
campus lounges, faculty homes, and the union, as well

» as in Mr, Bowers’ office. What could I add?

Among things which might cause Grinnell fans to
hope for better fortunes ahead were the fourth quarter

_ passing of “Bomber" Anderson many good ball carry-

ing efforts (especially by Elston Bowers) and unspec-
tacular, but solid line play by the likes of Denny Hoe
merin, Jeff Lewis, and Larry Miller. Miller was injured
and will be out a couple of weeks His loss will be felt
but good depth should ease the burden.

Coach Young has really had the rug pulled out
from under a potentially great cross country team with
several unexpected personnel losses. Look for the re-
turn of Paul Patterson plus a lot of grueling work to'
pay off later this season.

Congratulations to Coach Simone. Vince Anku.
and the rest of the soccer squad for its successful sea-
son‘s opener. Everyone should take the time to see our
soccer team in action —- it is a tremendous game and
our team has few peers among colleges this size,

high school. I guess you outgrow yelling at college.”

More about this to come in later issues.
