One of the i din l :isoiis I feel that Grin-
nell is worthy of its growinh reputation is that
It is growing — and growth means change.
This change must collie not only from a prop
g‘i'es e. aleit administration, but is to a great
extent the responsibll y of the most vital part
of any institution of learning, tlle students. The
students must be aware enough to make their
college iears conform to their personal academe
ie. intellectual and cultural interests. It is my
contention not that the student IUIOW best how
to educate tllemselves, rather that the student
should be allowed to be or should be viewed as
being mature enough to indicate to lIiilIsell and
‘Jollow tor himself the Collise and manner of
study he desires; otherwise learning' becomes
colllpulsory r ther than soun'ht after, sedentary
instead of vital and stimulating:
