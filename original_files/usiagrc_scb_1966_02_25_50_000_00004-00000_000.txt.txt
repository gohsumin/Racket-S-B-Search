process, it the program is to con-
tinue or be expanded.

Foote, who now serves as presi-
dent of Gates, thinks that some in-
dependent appeals board should be

set up in regard to 5&6 charges.
"I think it is necessary to lift
the mystique about BaG ‘as an
autonomous power," He mentioned
the possibility of the resident ad-
visors acting as liasons between
the students and

Form: is for liberalization of the
car and open dorms rules, and
thinks that one of the best ways
to approach the administration
would be to point to Carleton,
which now enjoys a fairly exten-
live open dorms program.

“I have had experience working
with Dean Thompson and the ad-
ministration," Foote said, “Arid
having served as a house presi«
dent ! think that i would be able
to appreciate the problems that all
the house presidents face.“

Kurasch wants to sit down with
the powers that be. “Only when
we Sit down with the administra-

tion to present carefully-planned,
wellsthought-out proposals will we
cease being the ‘North Campus
problem’ and resume our position
as the Men of North Campus.”

He feels that the “North Campus
problem” has not been sufficient-
1y defined or discussed. “The resi-
dence hall system has become a
whipping‘ boy or scapegoat for
problems which really do exist.
Admittedly there are faults with
the residence hall system. but
these problems can be worked, out
within the system.”

Kurasch proposes a meeting on
a grand'scale, a meeting which
would involve the Coil-KP, AWS
board, SGA president, President
Leggett, the new vice president,
Dean Stauss, the student deans,
the chairman of the faculty, and
the chairman of the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs.

Kurasch feels that a meeting of
this type would have some aspects
of an encampment but with the ad-
ded advantage of bringing togeth-
er those people—in student gov-
ernment, on the faculty, and in

lites than juniors, juniors more
than sophomores

How late the late minutes should '

be is a matter that “can be talked
about" — to use Miss Lauterv
bach’s Words.

The late minutes of which Miss
Lauterbach refers would be simi-
lar to the fifteen minutes of
"grace" tor women that the Sen-
ate passed Wednesday. it would
allow a woman to be a speciﬁed
number of minutes late without
incurring penalty. For seniors, Miss
Lauterbach suggested that there
possibly be two such periods of
“grace" a month.

When asked about the Women’s
Primary Court, Miss Lauterbach
had nothing but praise saying that
the court “has the respect or most
or South Campus."

The new president doesn’t see
the main duty of her nifickand
the offices of hall president»as en-
forcing the rules. “Enforcement
cannot be done away with realisti-
cally," she said. More importantly.
she said, the president should
“make the consequences known.”

At a question and answer period
for the two candidates Tuesday
afternoon. Miss Lauterbach was
asked about the possibility of hav-
ing sophomores as Baffleboard.

She replied that “I wouldn’t like
to see the position changed in this
way. Rather, I’d like to see one
good junior baitleboard per iloor
than two sophomores if there aren't
enough juniors available.” _

Another question from the floor
concerned the power oasis of stu-
dent government. 'The questioner
said that during the campaign tor
SGA presidency it was pointed out
that the power basis, for student
government was the power to quit
enforcing rules. Lauterbach was
asked what issues were important
enough to merit the use of this
power, l-ler answer was that the
step was "drastic” and she “hoped
it won't be used.”

position to effect a change,

“We can no longer attord the
prevalent attitude in the present

for change _ the need for estab~

complete takeover of policy by

The Women‘s Primary Court

On February 14 the court tried
a case of disorderly conduct (vio-
lation of quiet hours). Much of
the following is quoted from the

as an authentic consequence of

cases that have come before the
court. . .have been the result of
a single incident characterized by
the fact that the defendant was in-
toxicated and unwilling to re
spond to requests to control her
conduct, This Case, on the other
hand, involves not just one inci-
dent bbit a pattern of behavior eX<
hibited by the defendant showing
she was unwilling to restrain her
conduct Within the hall so as to
make it acceptable to the other
residents. . . 3"

The court went on to say that
“infractions of quiet hour regula-
tions should. in most Cases, be
dealt with by appropriate lloor or
hall action. When this is not pos—
sible, or if it is ineffective, the
court will be willing to accept
cases of disorderly conduct on
quiet hours.”

“Motivated in part by the units-
ual nature of the charge the court
has decided upon an unusual pen—
alty. Penalties should be designed
to retorm as well as to punish. . .”
The penalty in this case took et-
tect Sunday, February 20. The de-
fendant received five nights of
room confinement from 11:00 p.111.
to 6:00 am. She was denied the use
or a record player irom 11:00
pm to l1;oo a.m, (including
week-ends) until spring vacation.
