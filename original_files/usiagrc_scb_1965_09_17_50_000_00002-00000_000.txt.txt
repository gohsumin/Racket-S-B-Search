Sequeiro Explains Aid Plans.

,‘Finonces Remain Adequale' ‘

By ALAN AXELROD

' The financial needs of Grinnell
students are adequately provided
for in monetary giits awarded by
the college in the iorm of scholar»
ships and grants~lnvaid. .
“No!” you say? Leforne Sequel-
ra, director of placement and stu-
dent aid, thinks so and further
believes that the story about thou-
sands ol dollars in scholarship
tunds going unused is a myth.
"We use every penny at the funds
that are alotted to us," he said.
This year 124 ireshmen are get—
ting gifts. and the average award
is $783, while last year 163 fresh~
then received an average or $775.
These totals represent outrand»out
gifts and do not include loans or
campus employment. While the
number of ireshman scholarships
went down, the number of fresh»
men went up, from 356 to 372.
However, Sequeira says that there
is no discrepancy in these figures.
“Once accepted, every student
who applies for an needs finan-

 

cial assistance gets it,” he said.
Last year the college had $367,000
available for financial assistance.
The total went down this year to
$350,000. “However, these figures
are misleading.” he insisted. “Sev-
eral scholarship funds instituted a
few years ago have exhausted
themselves.”

“There is a continual turnover in
funds available irom year to
year,” he said. When gifts pres
vided by outside sources are not
adequate, the college must dig in.
to its own income to make up
the difference. When the college
does this, however, there is less
available for the educational en»
terprise, and during years of heavy
outlay of funds for such improve-
ments as the Forum and the new
science wing, the college some-
times finds itself in a bind.

Sequelra predicted that next year,
however, there will be $370,000
readily avallable, and the college
will be doing a better job iii needs
analysis.

Recently,

during my marathon study break
(now elitllng its second week), I saw a war mOVle
on television, The name oi the movie doesn't really
matter but there was some timeless dialogue and
in case you missed this gem, We recorded it below.

The scene was on the bridge oi a large aircraft
carrier. Two men _. an admiral and a lesser rank»
ing officer — were talking. A lite long trieud oi the
Admiral — a prep school and college chum, the best
man at his wedding, God lather at his son — has

died in a mission led by the lesser rank. . .

“But was your mission in good judgment?”

"Admiral, we completely destroyed the bridge
and still had bombs left over. You know the un-
written rule — never return unless you’ve used all
your bombs. We hit the secondary target and killed
untold numbers or enemy troops who were living
in those village homes. it was a good mission, Ad-

"Admiral. It was a good mission." He got a
far away look in his eyes, “We're going to have to
face it — you are and I am — that some people are
going to get hurt over here in this war and some
may even go so far as to get killed. Sooner or later
— Lord knows we try to make it later _ someone
we know and maybe even like is going to get killed.
We can't let that ruin our lives. We’ve got to go on
just like before Don't let it change your attitude."

There was a pause — a short pause. Then the

Graduate Writes from Thailand

Ed. note: The iullowing letter
was written Sept. 7 by Darlene
Keeler, who is participating in
the Fifth Year Abroad program
at Dara Academy, Chiengmsi,
Thailandt

Although i feel as if I've been
here “forever." i find it hard to
believe that its September, that
summer in the U.S. is over, and
that Classes at Grinnell have be-
gun, in ways it seems that it was
just a short time ago tllat I ar-
rived in Chiengmai, got used to
being stared at by the students,
became accustomed to having
dogs, chickens (sctawny ones, at
that), and birds going in and out
or the classroom at will, eating
new and different foods, and mak»
ing adjustments to other things
that make life nin in a little
different manner over here, i
blithely began teaching thinking
i “knew" English, but soon Iealr
ized that just because i spoke it,
it didn't necessarily mean that i
knew it or that I Could teach it
wtthout preparation. It was some-
times easy to go to class at Grin»
nell unprepared, but i iind that it
is a little harder to teach when
you're unprepared! Alter getting
somewhat settled in a groove
which was fairly free of obstacles.
l was able to see more of Chieng.
mai, which interested me much
more than did teaching,

Chiengmai, 543 miles north at
Bangkok, is the second largest
city in Thailand with a population
of 100,153 (1960 census) Within the
City limits. Chiengmai is sur
rounded by mountains and the
valley is quite icrtile. Most of the
people are iarmers. Besides grow-
ing much rice, soybeans, and pea-
nuts, Chiengmai is noted for its
fruit. 1 might add that it is also
noted for its pretty girls and kind
people, facts which I learned from
correcting about 300 compositions!
Right now we are in the middle
or the rainy season, the tinie when
rice is planted and everything is
very green and lush. it doesn’t
ruin all the time, but it usually
manages at least mice a day or
else it might rain quite steadily
for a day or two and then be
iollowed by a beautitul siinny
day—it varies, and you can never

 

count on it being one way or the
other. I'm getting quite used to
riding my bike to my Thai langur
age class in the rain and am
finding it a Challenge to keep
irom getting splashed.

One of the things that struck
me most when Larrived was [he
traiiic. It's like you've never seen
belore and your llle is at stake
whenever you venture forth. The
streets are crowded W|th bicycles,
cars, buses, trucks, 3-wheeled m0~
torized taxls, pedicahs (man pow-
ered taxis), Hondas. and even
some ox carts. i think the Thai
have a philosophy that says that
the other driver has a steering
wheel and brakes and is Capable
oi using them. when everyone
thinks this way it can sometimes
lead to interesting results. They
pass anytime they wish and hook
then‘ horns at Corners instead 0i
slowing down. I don’t think any
one listens to these hcrns, but
maybe they do. Anyway, it is sort
of fun to manllever in the traffic.

i was also struck by the many,
many little shops that line the
street and seem to be selling the
same thing. I wonder how anyone
makes a living. When I think of
these shops a picture of the red
and white of the Colgate tooth
paste. the red, blue, and white oi
a box or Feb, and the orange oi
Ovaltine can come to mind. These
three companies seem to have
made a “hit" in Thalland. Then
there is the market which is
"something else" and proves dif-
iicult to describe. in it are many
little booths where everything is
sold. You can close your eyes and
tell where you are by the smell—
the meat market, cosmetic, etc,
The food market is probably the
most interesting, for so many of
the foods are new to me and l’m
fascinated by their looks and their
odors. If you like to bargain and
are adept at it, you can have lots
or tun haggling over prices. The
best time to go is early in the
morning when everyone is buying
food. We oiten go there at 6:30
tor breakiatt where, besides eating
interesting iood. you see lots oi
interesting people. it's quite a
colcritil place. and, needless to
say. diflerent ironi “shopping cen-
ters" at home.

 

i don’t want to bore you, so this
is all [or this letter. Please write
it you have any question, espec-
ially ii ynll are interested in com<
ing next year. I’d enjoy hearing
irom any of you.

Parsons, Antioch
Suffer Dissension

By PAUL BRADLEY

Faculty ~ student antagonism at
Antioch College worsened this
summer when Mary Hunt, direc.
tor of Antioch’s extramural de-
partment, resigned, She leit be-
cause, “i iind it increasingly on.
ticult to accept the living stand-
ards and behavior patterns of our
students. .1 believe we will
make no progress until a strong

-leadership makes clear the stand-

ards we intend to foster and en—
courage,"

Examples of student behavior
were brought to light, The casual,
loiltngonthe-iloor, manner or Au—
tioch students attending a lecture
by a visiting philosophy protessor
and the loss of nine hundred books
a year from the library were
cited.

A proposition is being considered
by the student government to SilSr
pend Antioch’s honor system and
impose these restrictions:

1. A guard at the library.

2. Suspension of open hall hours.

3. Proctored exams in classes.

4. Enforcement of strict dress
standards in the cafeteria.

Dissension is also heard in the
surrounding community, where,
according to the Antioch newspa-
per, students have tound it on —
cult to secure adequate oftcampus
housing. The remnant of the Ollie
Kll Klux Klan has threatened in
“run Antioch out of Ohio.”

Parsons College is also having
problems with the local commlm»
ity, reports the college paper. The
town welcomes the college's spend-
ing power, but substandard holis-
ing oil-campus for the students is
lar from the exception. in addi—
tion, police have arrested and
fined students for walking in the
streets and hitcnllikingl
