Ever since last spring and
the uproars in many schools
tollowing the assassination at
Dr. Martin Luther King, pro-
fessors and: administrators at
countless institutions have or
ganizcd courses and even de-
partrnents in Afro-American
Studies,

Much of their activity is di-
rectly traceable to pressure last
Spriugfrom student groups who
felt that in presenting only
white American history and so
ciology and literature, colleges
were ignoring or downplayrng
an important tacet oi the na-
tlon's culture; Professors, who
decided- that America's racial
crimsnecessitated a deeper and-
more diverse knowledge or
American minorities than pres-
ent scholarship made possible,
joined the tight.

Previous study or black cl
zation. had been limited. almost
entirely to- the history or geogT
raphy. on Ar Now, students:
want to. 1:3‘3‘1‘11 about the
Negro in- America- — his his—
tory and his. cuntribuu'on to
their society, his. political» and:
intellectuali evolution from slave-

Must oi the courses in black
studies-i deal with Negro. litera-
ture (wLiters like LeRoi Jones,
James Baldwin), Negro. Ameri-
can history (on which DuBois
and historian. Staughton Lynd
have written), and music and

folklore: Also common» are
courses on- poverty. race rela-
tions, and other sociology
courses.

Even schools who enroll sube
stantial numbers oi black stu-
dents are expanding their black
curricula. Many at them are»
adding Swahili to their lan-
guage courses; universities in.
New York City and Chicago
have done the same. Northr

Some of the courses are more

ination”; Cornell University is

opment of the Urban Ghetto";

ogy students, many universi-
ties which used to send students

“field. work" in ghettov neigh-
borhoads.

Why the sudden furor over
black studies? Many educators.
as well as students, have been
accused oi neglecting black
students and' black culture ini
their curriculum plans; stu-
dents- have felt guilty about the
common exclusion of blacks
from intellectual credibility.
Most academicians now have
expressed the need tor learning

The caucus. room oi. the Pru-
gtam in Practical Political
Education is the oldest and'per—
helps the must successtul or all

a library [or books and periodi—
cals on politics. and a deposi-
tory ior recorded speeches at
various organizations.

The classical languages room
was established this tall. includ—
ed in the room is an extensive
library pooled irom the persnal
libraries at William Muthben
and John Crossett, and contain-
ing both basic texts and selected
secunduny works. But. according
ta. Crossett, there is no pur-
pose- to the room unless the stu-
dents utilize rt. He sees hope
tor expansion, or the program
to all departments,. providing
majors with a place to meet.
study, and. converse with stu-
dents ot similar majors,. it the
students prove that these rooms
am. worthwhile.

Beth Noble; chairman of the
Spanish dephmnent,. empha<
sized' that the' functions. of the
Spanish room will be leit en-
tirely up: to the students. Miss
Noble met with all' the Spanish
majors and learned they could
use~a place lor individual» quiet
study,. bull sessions, discussions
before or after Spanish table

dinners, ﬁnd-inim’ﬂml‘ talks with
(acuity members. Most impor-
tant. classes. do not necessarily

bell, Students» now have them»
portunity to remain in the semi-
nar room- andicontinuerdlscussion
and. debate; Besides the fairly
complete library of pertinent
books. and periodicals,. Miss.
Noble hopes. to- make available

al books dealing with the psy-
chology oi education. Both types

dred and iiity new books a year.

Included in the sociology room
are a. collection of census vol<
time s, sociological research
data. and also books and peri-
odicals. Another room is de-
Votedi specifically to research.
All material and data from the
school's. annual ﬁeld trip are
analyzed here.

The anthropology room is now
being used. as a laboratory tor
Students. The department,, how.
ever, is anticipating. a- museum
in the room where Iield‘ speci-
mens, artilacts,, and. maps at
field: cites will be displayed: it
