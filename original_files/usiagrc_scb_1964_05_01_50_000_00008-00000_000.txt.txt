,[IeVeIamI and Cowles Win Annual Fetzer
Sing In First Approved ("o-ed Competition

By Susan Taylor

"Children’s Day at P. S. No.
(47" delighted the audience at
the 29th annual Fetzer Sing
last Saturday night in Derby
Gymnasium, and it won the

naninious vote of the judges
or first place in the compet-
itive event. Cleveland and
Cowles Hall, combining their
,vocal talents in me first cored
Fetzer, and portraying their
yague, if so long ago, recollec-
tions of second grade, walked
away with the trophies.

Read and North Younker
Halls, singing “Set Down, Ser-
yant” and ”Legend of the
Christ Child,” placed second in
the competition They opened
the show since North Younker
had the “honors,” after retiring
the traveling trophy last year.
While this chorus may have not
been equal to the Cleveland»
Cowles effort in such things as
audience appeal and original~
ity, they were certainly equal,
If not better, in their arrange-
ments, difficulty, and perform-
ance of the numbers they se»
Iected,

Third place was captured by
ﬂames and Rawson Halls with
the theme “Spectrum of Song."
Their selections included
"Black is the Color," “Cherry
Pink and Apple Blossom
White,” “Green Leaves of
Summer," and "Deep Purple,"

Dressed appropriately for
their roles as second graders,
the Cleveland - Cowles chorus
performed and sang under the
direction of Bill Morian, ap-
propriately dressed himself in
I tux and tails for his role as
school marm, He had some
difficulty controlling the s e
youngsters, but for the most
part, and considering the cir-
cumstances, they were well,
behaved.

There were a few disturb-
ances, however, Little Georgie

 

Buck, attracting his professor’s

attention b e t w e e n numbers, '

found it necessary to leave in
the middle of the perform»
ance, but he promptly returned
so that the chorus would be
complete. Other small disturb-
ances were caused from time
to time by little Firnist Alex-
ander, who had a special line
“What a good boy am I!”
Firnist could not seem to get
his line in at the right: time,
but he was appropriately aided
by “Piglet." ,

A highlight of the perform-
ance of these second graders
was the announcer of their
numbers, Little Dickie Bailly.
Dickie was dressed for the oc-
casion, with little bright red
bows carefully tied in his big
black beard. Though he had to
fight stage fright off and on, he
did a fine job and the numbers
were appropriately announced,

Aside from their second grade
motif in dress and actions,
Cleveland and Cowles presented
an outstanding musical pe »
formance, Their selections i
cluded “Once in Love With
Amy," and Five Nursery
Rhymes: “Humpty Dumpty
Sat," "Little Bo Peep Has
Lost," “Little Jack Homer
Sat,” ”Mary Had a Little," and
“01d King Cowles,"

From the gently lulling "baa
. . . baa" to the crisp staccato
of ‘Old King,” Morain main-
tained excellent control over
the chorus The arrangements
and the musical performance
were very well done, and stood
out in nice contrast to the slap-
stick dress and perlorrnance ate
mosphere.

As good a Fetzer Sing as I
can remember. was my over-
all impression. All three chor-
uses which placed had excel-
lent arrangements, and good
directors, They showed earnest
work within the halls, if not
earnest frustration of all sides,

but they put on a good show.

I hope that the new co-ed ef-
fect will be continued. Group
singing is fun, and the Social
Coordinating Committee would
probably be delighted with the
mixing its provides of neces-
sity.

Then there were the pictures
that the enterprising photog-
rapher had trouble taking. Es-
pecially Cowles and Cleveland
Wouldn't be still long enough
for him to focus, And now the
8&3 is madly trying to run
him down to get a picture for
the paper. . .

The individual singers varied
from the very professional—

who knew what they were do-
ing and their posture showed
itito the first time performers
who tried to look professional
by beating out the rhythm with
their heads. Then there were
the halls with outstanding sec-
tions and those directors who
did so with ”vig-ah," There
were the boring marchinglines
between the numbers, but these
were relieved somewhat by the
pleasant commentary. It was
interesting to watch the town
families with four kids come in.

The show was good," and
those who devoted so much
time to it deserve a vote of
thanks
