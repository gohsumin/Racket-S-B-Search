Student Counseling Available:
Broader Foriliiios Needed

By KRYS NEUMAN

Concern about the lack of ade-
quate counseling services at
Grinnell has prompted work
“toward the goal of a iull»time
counseling office." says Asso-
nlate Dealt Richard Winters.

At present, the college makes
available the proiessioual psy-
chological and psychiatric serv-
ices of the Jasper County Men<
tal Health Clinic at Newton, 17
miles aivay.

Winters feels that the New-
ton clinic has a “dedicated
team of Workers" and that
crlnnell is “fortunate to have
such a complete set-up nearby."
Although an inirequent bus
schedule makes a Newton trip
inconvenient, Winters says stu-
dents can easily get rides with
friends; housemothers and even
the deans themselves have
driven students in the past. Win-
ters believes the arrangement
is really much less complicated

than that involved in seeing a
psychiatrist in a large city

According to contract, the
college covers the cost of the
first three to five visits to New-
ton, although a student may
elect to seek help there inde-
pendent oi the college arrange-
ment.

Dean Winters reports that the
majority of student cases han<
dled at the clinic involve “acute
moments of anxiety" and are
resolved in five or six visits.

More serious cases, however,
require the student to assume
the continuing financial burden
and thereby sometimes necessi~
tate dropping out of school,
Some students have sought
therapy at the IowatCity Psy-
chopathic Outpatient Clinic, al-
though the College has no sup-
portive iinancial arrangement
there.

Jones: ‘Coﬂeellouse Mood‘ Prevails
University Oiiers Casual Intellectual, Social Life

“A casual coilecllouse mood," best describes
the atmosphere of the University of Sussex, ac
cording to Alan Jones, history. Housed in “a wing
of a secluded country manor," Jones spent last
year teaching and writing at the new English

university.

hiond special

At Sussex, chartered in August 1961, Jones
taught a seminar on class in contemporary
America and supervised tutorials in American
history. Located near the “swinging” seacoast
resort of Brighton, the threeayeai', non-residen-
tial university, comments Jones, “attracts many
students who regard undergraduate education
as an end in itself," Hence, he remarks, Student
Intellectual and Social life is casual, not “die-

tated by proiessional ideas."

The nine new English universities, created in
response to the swelling student popularlon, have
been planned as a whole. and special attention
has been paid to their sites and archltecture.
“They’ve really caught on,” says Jones, “25 Slu‘

dents apply tor every one accepted,”

Jones noted that “Sussex students take the
initiative in managing their own education," an
opinion supported by the existence oi some so in.
dependent student intellectual Societies. Student
publications run the gamut from Sll'en (poetry)
and Sussex Radical (Liberal and Radical Society
