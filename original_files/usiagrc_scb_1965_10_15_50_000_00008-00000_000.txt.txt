FCSA Begins Year;
Will Consider Policy

“The Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs sees its major du-
ty in the area of policy rather
than in specifics,” FCSA chairman
John Burma (sociong) said this
week.

Burma explained that he tel: his
committee this year would not
handle such matters as whether
women students should be allowed
to stay out do minutes later on
Friday nights, a concern which he
considers a technical detail.

“On the other hand, we would
be concerned with a possible
change in the hall system pol.
icy." Burma said.

Burma noted that the FCSA
has met only two times so far
this year and that no cases oi
student misconduct have been con-
sidered as yet.

The committee this year coni-
prises eight voting members, They
are Burma, Denis de Coteau
(music), James Kissane (Eng-
lish), Dirk Baay (German). Ken-
yon Knopi (economics), Jean Sloe
cum (dean of women). S. Eugene
Thompson (clean at man). and
Richard Winters (associate dean).

in addition to the eight voting
members, President Glenn Leg-
gctt and Dean James Stauss are
ex otticio members of the com—
mittee.

The FCSA drew attention to its
salt last school year during a
jurisdictional feud involving the
student courts and the college ad-
ministration.

The committee, which was es
tablished last year by acting
President James Stauss, advises
the president on policies in the
area of student conduct, particle
pates in the process of changing
the basic rules and penalties. and
considers certain cases or student
misconduct.

negotiations could only begin at-
ter intervention from the North
ceased.

The Undersecretary oi State of
Cambodia answered Duc by stat-
ing the ”us intervention is the
only true intervention in South
Viet Nam." He also said that the
South could only make true sir
cial progress when all ioreign
troops were withdrawn and when
a government representative at
the people had been installed.

The third speaker, William Wor—
thy. said he appeared “not as a

spokesman” (or the NLF, although

he has traveled throughout South-
east Asia and has regular contact
with NLF representatives in Pro»
gue.

“Hanoi and the NLF have the
overwhelming majority ot maria
kind on their side,” according to
Worthy. He said that since 1954
the people or South Viet Nam have
had no voice in their governments.

Worthy also claimed that the
Johnson administration had res
fused to enter “ott-the-record"
talks with the NLF last year be-
cause or domestic political pres
sures during the elections.

The final speaker of the session,
Robert Scalapiuo, was interrupted

several times by shouts irom the
audience at Toronto. Some Stu-
dents were protesting the removal
of Michael Myerson from the list
of scheduled speakers.

Myel'son is a graduate student
at California where Scalapino
heads the political science depart-
ment. There was a rumor, yet
unconﬁrmed, that Scalapino had
refused to appear with Myerson,
who has recently returned trot-n
Hamil.

Scalapino said that the United
States must act in Viet Nam to
preserve the balance of power in
Southeast Asia. He advocated re-
cognizing the Viet Cong for pur-
poses of negotiation it necessary.

The panel on viet Nam was only
part of a three-day teach-in heiore

Friday. October l5, not

an audience of 4,500 at Toronto.
The Saturday morning session
dealt with u. s. policy toward Latin
America.

Grinnell was one of 28 colleges
