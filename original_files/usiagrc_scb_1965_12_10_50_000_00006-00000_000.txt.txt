concepts tor the iirst exam: 1)
the nature of man, 2) evaluation,
and 3) evidence. This test was
given twice, to 248 juniors in 1962
and 278 in 1963.

The faculty approved the new
theme on May 10, 1963, and re
lated the concept or “order" m
Aristotle, Newton, and Darwin.
With this test, four credits were
assigned for any passing grade,

The test centered on the Concept
of order was given in 1964 and
again in February 1961
4 Each year ditteient groups had
tried to tormulate meaninglul
tests, with varying degrees of suc»
cess,

Dean James Stauss questioned
the advisability of the exam in a
report to the iaculty on September
15, 1964. He said: “I find it dif-
ticuit to answer yes to three ques-
tions, where the afﬁrmative is
tied into the theory ol the exami-
nation:

“Does the amount or reading
which the students actually do jus-
tity the credits earned and taciilty
time and effort put into the exam?

“Do the essay questions in the
exam provide the students individ-
ually the oppoitunity to express
the particular reading each has
done?

“Are the concepts which have
interdisciplinary dimensions actual-
ly emphasized in the required
courses?'-’

Five months later, in February
1965, the faculty made its recom-
mendation that a one-year mora-
toriurn lie imposed, and that in
the future the JLA be considered
in conjunction with .a oomprehen
stve evaluation of the curriculum.

Kenyon K n o p i (economics),
chairman of the faculty, thinks
that the purpose at the morator-
ium is to “rethink the framework
rather than the examination.”

It a new test is designed, “per-
haps more structure will have to
be built in," although the test Was

originally proposed to test the lib-
eral arts, not course work. How
can the test he made part oi tho
curriculum and keep its “liberal
arts" flavor?

Stauss questioned whether the
“interdisciplinary concepts" were
actually made part of the course
work now. This same failure was
noted by Givens Thornton (psy~
nholngy), who made the turmai
proposal at line test in 1960.

“A substantial portion of the
faculty didn't accept the idea of
a liberal arts exam in principle"
and consequently tailed to give it
attention in course work and writ—
ing letters of recommendation

Thornton said, “I have no doubt
that the outcomes at a liberal edu-
cation can be measured," but that
currently the use of the exam
is an expensive proposition.

It is expensive in the sense at
time required or students, admin-
istration and particularly the fac-
ulty in the preparation and grad-
ing of the test.

On December 14, 1960, Thorns
ton’s proposal to the raoulty ra-
terred to the test in this way:
“It will have justiﬁed its exis-
tence if it promotes intellectual
excitement leading to discussion,
argument, and critical analysis oi
the issues basic to a liberal edu-
cation" and “cause students to
ask questions concerning Lhe puts
pose of a liberal arts college in
our society and their role in such
a community."

on those grounds, did it justiiy

itself?
