the tendency to steer it in a
specific direction will be great-

initiative will be minimized.

The proposal seems to be
aimed at creating a better at-
lnnsphere for experimentation
by reducing the inhibitions stu.
dents have concerning class
participation The role of a
grading system as significant
in inhibiting student participa-
tion and discussion is, how-
ever, questionable. William Pol-
iak and John Willis both com-
mented that the size o! the
classes (over 25 students per
class) is too large to accommo-
date discussions easily. This ll
quite plausable. Seminars on
kypcaily small and the mate-
rial which they cover is more
narrowly defined, In such 6' -
cumstances, discussions thrivo
and are beneﬁcial. in large
classes with less defined inter-
est areas and no concrete, sub-
stantive objectives, discussion
is understandably less success-
fill.

in brief, several tactors exist
which appear to hamper the
Social Studies experiment. The
size of the classes, the lack of
concrete objectives, and the un-
certainty among the staif con-
ceming how the material should
be presented are three problems
which are vital to the experi-
ment. How the credit-fail sys-
tern will help in eliminating
these conditions is difficult to
understand

Forensic Club
Holds Meeting

The Grinnell College Foren-
sic Club revived in tradition
Saturday by holding the Fif-
teenth Annual Grinnell Discus-
sion Conference. The intention
of the conterence was to pro«
vide background and stimulate
thought on the 1968~69 collegiate
debate topic, Resolved: That
executive control of United
States foreign policy should be
signiﬁcantly curtailed.

The conference opened with
l general meeting addressed
by a panel of speakers on the
topic. The lectured speaker was
Dr. Fred Morrison, Assistant
Professor of Law and Political
Science at the University of
low, who gave his analysis of
the problems presented by the
topic. Professor Joseph Wall
and Assistant Professor Neal
Milner of the Grinnell faculty
followed with their impressions
of the situation. The three also
answered questions raised by
the attending students.

Following the general meet-
ing, the participants met in
small groups for three rounds
of discussion on the question or
what the scope of executive
control or toreign policy should
be The aim of the discussions
was to determine the nature at
the problem, its cause, and
possible solutions to the prob-
lem.

Attending the conierence
were about sixty students, in-
cluding ten members of the
Grinnell Forensic Club. Other
colleges sending participants
included Mankald (Minn)
State, Wanhurg, William Penn,
Simpson, the University of
Town, St. Ambrose, Monmouth,
and Washington University of
St. Innis.
