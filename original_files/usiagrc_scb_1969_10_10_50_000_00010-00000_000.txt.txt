Pets Peelie Deans, But Please the Masses

mascot, Tory Pioneer. his
problems are often found dag-
ging the footsteps at junior
senator Bill Stranger, much as
Tory himself used to dog his
master’s Steps running behind
him on the beaches of Santa
Monica, California.

One of Tory's problems is
that a week ago Wednesday.
stranger was notified by Dean
of Students Alice Low that he
had been fined $25 for keeping
the halt-Afghan, half-Samoyed
Tory in his dormitory room.

, “When I left California I
tried to find a good home for
him, but nothing turned up,"
Stranger commented, “so I had
no choice but to bring Tory to
school with me this semester."

Dean Low said Tuesday that
Stranger had come to see her
soon after the beginning or the
semester. "We tried to find
someplace {or the dog, an of!-
campus house. or something
like that but nothing developed,

“Bill kept the dog in his
room. He was obviously break-
ing a rule. In such cases the
housekeeping policy is to line

titled by housekeeping as soon
as I put the fine throng .”

Stranger said that now he
"would have to construct a
house or do something else tor
Tory."

The three-year old Tory has
other problems as well. “He’s
very unhappy right now, be-
cause he loves and misses his
sister whom he grew up with,"
said his master.

Student—pet relaoionshlps have
been encouraged as a result or
the change in the college pet
policy. Last year's Student
Handbook stated, “No pets are
allowed in the residence halls”;
but the current handbook addsi
“Except for birds or rodents in
fully enclosed glass or metal
cages, goldﬁsh, or other small
fish, or turtles, pets ale forbid-
den in residence halls"

Shirley Lillie, manager-owner
oi Grinnell Pet and Acquarium.
said that she noticed a marked
increase in the purchase of pets
by students this year over last.

gerbils are the most popular-

One of the clilnchillas is

jointly owned by juniors Ken

ierncious, and can’t distinguish
between ﬁngers and loud, but
generally feeds on pellets, hay,

Still versive Clidllt Spree
Worries Woryﬂ & 6

By lda Gudema

While, most Grim-tell Students
have passively watched. the
dastardly sidewalk chalkers on
campus have been trying to
subvert the school through their
evil drawings on the concrete
But there is hope, tor the Build
lugs and Grounds workers have
arisen to save Grinnell from
this horrible plot.

The chalkers have repeatedly
tried to infiltrate the campus.
Their targets have included the
sidewalks in front of Carnegie
and outside of Conference
House. But their most Vile
deeds took place at Sunshine
Saturday, in front oi the
Forum, when they chalked in
ﬂowers, butterflies, and the
words, “Freedom Now," an ob-
vious subversive slogan. How-
ever, their propaganda soon
disappeared as 884G workers
and students joined to erase it.

One Chalker declared, “As
usual, this is an incredibly
archaic policy of B&G, and the
powers-that—be‘ 8&6 policies
are deﬁnitely ANTI-LIFE and
repressive of all creative stu-
dent endeavors such as side.
Walk chalking. This shall not
go unnoticed! The forces of lilo
shall arise againl Let a thou-
sand ﬂowers (and chalked side-

i

walks) bloom."

The voice of the workers;
Physical Plant Director, Dale
i-iawn, disagrees with this sink
plistic approach to the problem.
He feels that sidewalk chalking
is analogous to defacing a
building, Hawn said BBLG has
no speciﬁc policy about the
Chalkings, but explained that
the chalk penetrates lhe side-
walk aild becomes impossible
to remove. This occurred after
last year’s “Happening," when
the workers weren’t alerted.
and some of the chalk still lin<
gers on.

l-lawn staunchly defends the
common student, who he s ys,
is as proud of the facil tell
as everyone else. He thinks
most students don’t want on
work on the sidewalks; he
stated, “The strong silent ma-
jority feels concrete should look
like concrete."

Where is the strong silent
majority? Will Grinnell students
allow the chalkings to continue?!
Will the college become a haven
for sidewalk chalkers? What
will happen to Grinnell's repu.
tation? One sidewalk chalker
has announced, “Massive chalk.
ins should begin immediately."
The future looks ominous, to
say the least.

An 5&3 photographer caught these twa “agitators" challn
writing on a campus sidewalk. Note the subversive look in

their eyes.
