reason for the suspension penal-
ly, Leggett said: “The only pos-
SIblo alternative would be to let
them come back under conduct
probation, My notion is that
conduct probation wasn't severe
enough in this case, This (Con-
duct probation) would indicate
that the college took on indif-
ferent attitude toward this sort
of behavior (students spending
the night together) and I did
not want to give students or
parents this idea. And (their)
being away does serve as
a reminder (to those still on
campus) that these students
were guilly of misbehavior.”
Leggelt went on to say, "On
this matter of illegal visitation

just don’t have an open mind
on this — 1 may sound moralis-
tic on this." When asked about
the moral standards involved
in this case, Leggett replied: “I

Cagers Begin Season Against Luther

The Pioneer basketball team
will be relying on improved
speed, shooting, and depth
when they begin their season
tomorrow night at 7:30 against
Luther in Darby.

Coach Pfitsch this year has
ten players who he thinks will
be able to play a great deal. on
his current first team he lists
three sophomores, one junior,
and one senior, With a team of
four juniors and a senior back»
ing them up.

Expected to be in the starting
lineup tomorrow are Henry
Wingate and Mike Schwartz at
guards, Elliott Hibbs and Thor
Evenson at forwards, and Sam
Sent) at center.

Coach Pfltsch mentioned his
first team is very quick and all
five members are good jumpers
although they are small, “This
team plays best when they are
pressing full-court all the time,
but when they start to set up
the offense they do not pro-
duce as Well.”

Pfitsch mentioned Greg Ran.

that we are a small middle-

Leggett commented that he
would like to see greater flex-
ibility in the rule structure: “ll-
legal visitation is a matter of
degrees—a young lady sitting
in a man’s room until 8:00 RM,
is different than overnight. I
don't think our present rule sys-
Iem is ﬂexible enough to allow
for this kind of difference.”

The Pioneer front line with
its quickness and jumping abili-
ty will probably be able to cov.
er the big men of the other
team better than in the two
previous years. '

They will have a chance to
see how they can cover big men
as Luther comes here. Ptltsch
thinks this will be the best
team the Pioneers will face this
year. Luther is big and last and
has many returnees from the
team that humbled the Pio-
neers at Luther last year.

Pfitsch Among
“Winningesl”

cation, is included in a list of
