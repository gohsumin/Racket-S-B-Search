neer double winner, capping
the BSO-yard run in 1:581 and
the mile run In 4:“.1. Bruce
Beckord broke his own Grin-
neil record by breaking the
tape in the 440-yard run in
148.4.

Ron Schachel and John Te-
Paske joined Langham and
Beckord in the 1-mile relay.
The quartet set a new meet
record with a 3:215 time.

ners was Tom Wood, who

Berg Named Recipient
0f Theophilus Trophy

Fred Berg, a senior, has been
named the David Theophilus
Trophy winner as the outstand-
ing athlete at Grinnell College
The award was given Berg at
the annual Honor 6 letter-
mnn’s club banquet held last
Tuesday evening. In honor of
Theophilus, a 1951 graduate of
Grinneli who was killed in Ko-
rea. The award is based upon
performance, leadership, and
scholastic records.

A sprinter in track at Grin-
nell, Berg was captain and
elected the most valuable
member of the track team last
spring. Because of an eligibil-
ity technicality, stemming from
his transferring to Grinnell af-
ter one semester at the Illinois
Institute of Technology, he was
not eligible for competition this
year.

Others receiving wards at the
banquet, at which President
Howard R. Bowen, spoke, were
the “most valuable” and “most
improved’ of the fall and winter
sports teams.

Those honored included Steve
Warrick and Elston Bowers,
who received the Dick Ullrich
trophies es the most valuable
lineman and back, respectively,
on the football team; Rod
Brown, in cross country; Dave
