was that ol lacully quality, Leggett said
that while Grinnell can be proud of its
quality, it must also accept the idea
31 mobiltty oi (acuity members. He
noted the increasing competition for aca-
demicians, especially in the large educa<

lional systems oi Caliiornla, New York“

and Massachusetts.

Drew a Laugh

“Student culture" was the third prob-
lem. He drew laughter trom the audi-
ence when he announced that he had
returned Irom the Encampment “con-
vinced that the Whole place would have
to be cleaned out.” But after 5 study
of the residence halls he found it “im-
possible to generalize“ and that things
were “reasonably well civilized.”

Students should not expect radical
changes in the tourth area: the cunt
culum. Leggett said that the process or
curriculum revision is long and involved,
and that the college “needs to find an
approach to curriculum study” 11 e t 0 re
changes can be made.

He discussed the ditticulty ot chang-
ing the common idea oi progress
throughout the four years. That prov
gress is usually seen in terms of gen-
eralization in (he first year, followed
by increasing specialization in the latter
three years. Leggett suggested that the
last year should concentrate more on
interdisciplinary study in order to "make
possible a run sampling of the richness
ol the liberal arts program here.” The
new credit-tall procedure is a step in
this direction, he said.

The final problem to be discussed was
that of administrative structure. Leggett
briefly outlined the roles that new per-
sonnel in the ottices or planning, de-
velopment. and the Dean of Women Will
play next year.

Leggett concluded by saying that he
was “deeply committed to the idea of
a community” and that he was conti-
dent that “we can develop a style of
discussion that will allow us to solve
our problems."

Question Everything

He said that students ought to question
everything—hut that “the style of que5~
tioning controls the kind of college that
results” and that “if we continue in the
way we have started we will have a
good year next year.”

Dean Thompson also spoke at the
meeting, but over a much narrower
subject: Ihe draft. He said that it is
college policy to “leave as many choices
as possible open.”

Thompson explarned that Grinnell had
been reporting the academic status or
male students as a matter of courtesy

Friday, May ii, was

until selective service changed its Poliv
cy to ask additional tutor-matron, where.
ual “SSS-109" forms merely
required certification of at students ”tull-
time attendance and good standing,” the
newer lorms asked for academic stand-
ing and rank in class.

Grinnell’s policy is midway between
the extremes oi supplying all iniornie-
tion or supplying no information, in that
students are allowed to select which in.
formation will be supplied to their drait
boards. Thompson cited a survey or the
Associated Colleges of the Midwest
which revealed that three schools sent
ranksinclass iniormation automatically,
two sent it unless requested otherwise,
and tive sent it only it requested by
the student.

Letter With SSS-109

Thompson said that Grinnell might at:-
company a partially - incomplete “SSS-
109“ form with a letter explaining that
(a) it was the student's responsibility
to report his class-standing, (b) that the
college respectively requested attention
be given to as many other tactor. as
possible, in that even Gt'iririell students
in the lower quarter of their class were
maklng satisfactory progress towaid a
degree, The letter would explain that at
“C” average is required beiure a stu-
dent is allowed to Continue his studies.

The only Senate business was to re-
ceive the ﬁnal reports at the transporter
lion, admissions, curriculum and hook-
srure committees. In most cases the
committees had only been able to do
preliminary work in their short exist-
ences. However, the Senate did approve
the recommendation of the radio com-
mittee (chaired by Greg Narver) that
the college allocate $2835 to establish
an AM station next year,

“Bureaucratic but Necessary”

In their final reports to the Senate,
the Cabinet officers agreed with Karen
Lauterbach that work this spring had
been “bureaucratic but necessaty." Miss
Lanterbach said that the AWS Hoard
had concerned itself with room draw.
ings, orientation, hall improvements, in-
formation to lreshmeii and had begun
E major project: the evaluation of wo-
men’s hours.

Dan Bucks, Speaker of the Senate,
said that most of the Senate’s work had
been of a “preliminary nature" but that
there had never before been so many
committees exploring so broad a range
of topics.

Steve Kent concluded the reports by
saying that the “organizational phase" oi
student government was ending. He said
that there has been a ”general revival
of interest and enthusiasm“ on Campus,
and that student government was new
active in “long-neglected areas Ol con.
cern." “In a brief period or time he
have set a record or accomplishment
or which we can all be proud.”
