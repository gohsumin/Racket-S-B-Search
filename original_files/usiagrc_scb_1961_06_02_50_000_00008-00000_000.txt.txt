A Tribute
Only strong willerl men are able to keep an ideal clear-
ly before them amid the pressures of modern society.
Such a man is Howard R. Bowen. The ideal is academic
freedom and the right to freedom of speech.

Not long ago Sigma Delta Chi, National Journalism
Fraternity for men presented President Bowen with an
award for “quietly- and consistently protecting the right
to freedom 01' speech on this campus and elsewhere.“

This paper joins in the SDX tribute L0 Dix Bowen,
whose clear thinking, and tolerance has been an inspi \-
tion to a “new Grinnell", and to students here and every-
where who are tr ‘ng to wrestle with the problems of
a confused world situation
