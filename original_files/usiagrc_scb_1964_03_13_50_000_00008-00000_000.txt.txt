‘Dr. Annis Defends Rising Costs.

\ Says
L l By John Wolf

The American Medical Asso-
Nation’s opposition to the pro-
posed King-Anderson medical-
care~forathe-aged bill was sum-
marized by the organization’s
president, Dr. Edward R. An-
nis, Tuesday evening in Rob-
jrts Theatre.

D,r. Annie refuted the charge

‘ that medical expenses have
iapidly increased in recent
ears, He agreed that expenses
I’iave indeed increased, but
““we’re not talking about the
name product” when we try to
— vompare medical practices of
today with those of a few years
ack. Today _we are dealing
.with “the new medicine of the
atomic age."

Hospital expenses have ina
greased sharply but of each
5500 hospital bill, $350 goes to
Bay non-medically trained la-

or which is needed to operate
apecialized equipment, Dr. An-
his noted.

Furthermore, he mentioned,
ghost persons have found a way
0 cope with the increased
posts. “The infant health insur-
hnce business has grown as
medicine has become more
nostly.”

Today I46 million Americans
re covered by some type of
Eealth insurance. Some 10,400.-
00 of the nation's 18 million
citizens over 65. years of age
have health protection

Dr. Annis also claimed that
eople seem to have the wrong
onception of health insurance.
“Health insurance should be
used to protect savings and in-
come; it should not be used to
cover the expense of a check-up
or a chest x—ray, Nobody com-
flains that they don't get to use
lie or fire insurance, but many
people certainly complain about
rot getting to use their health
nsurance."

Politics enters the medical in-
lurance picture because not all
ersons can afford such protec—
on. “We are not against gov-
prnment in medicine,” Dr. An-
his stressed. ”What we would
like to see, however, is that
those who need the protection

get it — not each member of
one segment of the population.

“The King - Anderson bill
would provide hospital care for
all persons over 55 only in has—
pitals under government con-
tract. But many people over 65
are quite well Off, Of our 18
million senior citizens, only 2.5
million are receiving old age
assistance. There is no doubt
that these 2.5 million should be
helped.” »

Drr Annis said that the three-
year-old Kerr-Mills law is help-
ingthose 2.5 million senior citi-
zens who cannot afford medical
bills. Under this plan, the fed-
eral government subsidizes
each of the 5|) states in provid—
ing aid to these people, This
plan costs 150 r’niilion dollars
annually.

A second feature of the Kerr»
Mills law, Dr. Annis claimed,
has run into federal obstacles.
This feature also works on a
state basis and gives help to
those older people who are self-
reliant but who would find it
difficult to meet a large medi~
cal bill without mortgaging
some property.

The second feature of Kerr-
Mills is in effect in 36 states
(including Iowa) and costs $350
million annually. Under’this
plan, the details of which dif-
fer slightly from state to state.
an elderly person may own his
own home of any value, own a
car, have a limited income.
and have limited savings while
receiving assistance.

Dr. Annis is also the head of
the World Medical Association.
He said that in this capacity he
has seen a ”deterioration of
quality of medical practices in
countries where a system of
medical care like King-Auden
son has been implemented.”

The backers of King-Ander-
son are apparently deliberately
deceiving the public by saying
that each wage earner will be
taxed a maximum of $12 per
year when in actuality, Dr. An-
nis claimed, the cost will
amount to $27.50 a year.

“If they have a good bill, let

 

them sell it honestly,” he
urged. -

Grinnell Young Republicans to Attend Sioux City Convo;
Vice-President Ferris Is Candidate for Slate Chairman

Bob Savage, president of the
Young Republican Club, will
head a group of 24 members
in attendance at the Iowa Col-
lege Young Republicans’ Con»
vention, to be held Friday and
Saturday in Sioux City...

“The Grinnell chapter has a
special interest in the conven-
tion this year,” declared Sav-
age, “with Roger Ferris,.a
Grinnell junior, running for
State Chairman."

Ferris, vice president of the
YR'S, has been actively cam-
paigning for the last month at
schools all over the state. Ac-
cording to the candidate, there
are two areas where work must
be done in the Young Republi-
can party of Iowa. “First, it is

imperative that we increase co-
0 p e r ati o n and interaction
among all clubs in Iowa, and
between the clubs and state or-
ganization, Equally important
is the need for greater interac-
tion with the Senior Party—
Young Republicans must be-
come part of the Party!"

“My goal as State Chairman
of the Iowa College Young Re-
publicans would be to make
YR’s a meaningiul part oi the
Party, and all programs which
I present will work toward that
end.”

"Our candidate has the 5014
id support of the University of
Iowa club and 4 smaller clubs
in the southeastern area," stat-
ed Savage. If elected, Ferris

will serve as chairman of the
15 Ipwa clubs.

The election, to be held Sat-
urday morning, will be fol-
lowed by a banquet in the ai-
ternoon. Also scheduled are
speeches by Senator Peter Dom-
inick of Colorado and Robert
Ray, Iowa State Chairman.

Other Grinnell YR members
playing an active role in con-
vention activities are Phil
Johnson who will serve on -tha
Resolutions committee, John
Black on the Credentials com-
mittee and William Pegg on the
Rules committee.

The ICYR Convention, held
annually in the spring, coin-
cides with meetings of other
YR groups in Sioux City this
weekend. i
