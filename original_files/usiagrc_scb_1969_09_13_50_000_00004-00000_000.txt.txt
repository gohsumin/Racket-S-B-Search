SCARLET AND BLACK

By GALEN GILBERT

Campus “radicals” gathered

for two meetings this week wtth
the intention at composing them-
selves into some term of mean-
ingtul organization. The Monday
meeting, attended by about
eighty people, was essentially a
session in which people sought
the general consensus on some
or the tollowing topics: the pur—
pose (it any) oi having a group
with periodic meetings, how
such a group should be organ-
lied, and what this essence of
education and action should its
called.
(Nothing was decided —not
even the name — so another
meeting was called tor Wednes
day.

On Monday nearly all of tho
eighty people sprawled around

Rain Delays P. E. Complex

Gn'nnell's new Physical Edu-
cation Complex is on its way.
Alter several delays in corn
struction, the new complex
should be ready for use in the
next academic year,

The structure, designed and
engineered by the Chicago
architectural firm Skidmore,
wings and Merril was orig-
inally planned for completion
July l, 1970. However, delays
caused by bad weather and
spring rains have moved the
tentative completion date up to
September 1, 1970 tor the gym-
nasium, locker and support
facilities and/November l. 1970
tor the swimming area.

The architectural iirm is also
responsible tor the design or
the Fine Arts Building, the
Forum, and Norris dormitory
on campus,

The contracted price for the
33,463 square foot building, let.
to Gilbert Construction or Iowa
Falls, was 52,158,250. This Slim,
however, will be tor the general
tacllities only and some addi»
tional costs will be incurred
during the completion of the
complex.

According to Mr, Evan Wai»

tional court limited in use to
female classes. In the center
area or the gymnasium there
will be four enclosed handball
Courts, The whole ﬂoor surface
or the gymnasium area will be
covered with Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing’s new "Tar.
tan” synthetic'tlocr, including
a 220 yard track.

The pool area will contain a
5 lane x-sliaped pool, 50 meters
in one direction and bit yards
in the other. This is to.aliow
the pool to meet both AAU and
Olympic regulations.

Since this complex is being
built with assistance from the
federal government it will be
mainly, in the words or Mr.
Walden, “an educational Iacil-
it ” Its use will therefore be
limited mainly to physical edu-
cation classes. This is demon-
strated by the absence oi any
seating for spectators in the
gymnasium and limited seating
or approximately 250 in the
pool area. Because of this fact
all varsity basketball games
will he played in Darby Gym~
nasium.

In addition to this new indoor
complex, three other projects
are underway north of Tenth
Avenue. These include a base-
ball diamond, is new football
ﬁeld and projected stadium to
replace Ward Field and an all-
weather asphalt quarter mile
track now near completion.
Upon completion of the project-
ed buildings, present facilities
will be used mainly for inter-
mural activities.

t Drugs

(Continued cram Page i)
the drug situation at Grinnell
has mounted during the past
few years. Early this tall
during the student advisor
workshop. Dean Low predicted
that there is a greater potential
tor drug arrests at Grinnell than
in recent years, citing recent
multiple arrests in lowa City
and Des Moines. According to
the Dean, law enforcement
agents will not notify the college
administration it they plan to
crackdown on illegal use oi
drugs here.

"it we don’t clean up our own
house, somebody else will clean
it up for us.” the Dean said,

Assistant Dean Kimho told the
son that "there should be a
concern about the use or drugs
on campus." Kimbo cited the
need for better education about
drugs and pointed out that
resident advisors are trying to
organize discussions in the halls
on a personal basis.

“These are areas or prob—
lems, although students may
not consider it as such,” Kimbo
added.

Students have also expressed
c'oncern about the drug
situation Cleveland Hall pres-
ident lra Eolnick is presently
working with several students
and resident advisors to develop
a drug symposium'at Grinnell.
The purpose of the symposium
would be to eradicate the pre-
sent ignorance about the legal
and medical hazards of drug
use.

Mrs. Low has indicated that
