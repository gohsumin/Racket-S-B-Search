Shaw Presents Difficulties

rsp Pelel Cohoii

Shaw's Major Barbara is an extremely difil»

senlallve of (1 particular, stylized em; and 3)
it is ,coplcd wun onc-dinicns eiial characters

, pcrsoiial attitudes

Given these considerations. last weekend’s
pei-ioi-niancc was more than adequate. Dimer
tor Ned Donalloe's rejection ot standard Stags
iiig allowed the actors to wander through and,
in eilrct, surround the audience in the play.
Despite the tact that Shaw has given the
characters almost no depth, Donahoc did tind
moments or contact; points at which two
1 characters would make contact as human be-
i ings.
‘ The audicncc did sense, however, a similar-
ily in these moments and occasionally had the
lceling that the actors were vacillating between
lpoles or “on" and “otf'

A mayor character that i written shallowly

a great deal of stage presence to the part of

felt that his charactei was being subsumed to

Major Balbal'a, herself, left the audicncc
reeling that a middle part had been eliminated.

Keith Felton displayed his usual tine sense ot
comic timing and style, in his portrayal of
Adolphus ousins, but tended to slump a bit
when called on to be serious. This was partial-
ly due to a wayward eyebrow or his which
tends to cock at odd moments and blur the
distinction between sincerity and comic dis—
tortion. Kay Obstleld was uncannily good as
Charles Lomox. the young man caught up in
the ccntritugal force oi his own stupidity,

The “minor” parts were consistently excellent
and well above average as college productions
go. in fairness to those already mentioned, how-
ever, the distinction between the relative com—
plcxity of major and minor parts should be re1
incmbered.

Deserving ot special mention were: Bruce
McConachie as Snobhy Price, the convert plays
ing it sate; Deb Burnstine as a tetchingly vulr
gar Rummy Mitchens and especialiy Terry Mc—
Coy whose small bit as Peter Shirley was the .
niost polished in the play‘. Although Don
Kurasch as Bill Walker stopped the show on
Friday night, his performance, while probably
the most extravagant, needed more control
or expression and diction

Lucia Lynncr as Sarah Undershait. Helen Klein
as Morrison, the maid, Becky Hill as Jenny and
Eva Gardebring as the sweetly larcenous Mrs.
Baines were simply not given enough material
to make a fair evaluation possible. it should be
noted that they played their parts tally and
supported the action so that there were no dead
spots whcii they were responsible.

A project Called Operation Opportunity is her
ing planned by a commission at lowa Stale Uni-
versity. in conjunction with the Iowa Develop-
ment Commission, Thls program is aimed at d15—
covering the opportunities available to college
graduates in the state 01 lawn.

Special altentlon is paid lo the Condition of
business and protessional opportunities in the-
stnte, as well as the general condition of educdr
tion and government. Last year a similar pro-
gram was quite successful. A state-wide con—
tcrcncc was held, bac ound papers were wiit—
tcn, and a television program was produced.
Similar activities are planned for the Spring
of this year.

February will hr g 1111 International Stu—
dent Relations Semi: (11' sponsored as a joint
activity by the Iown~Nehraskn and Missouri1
Kansas regions. This program will be directed
lit in) :1 better understanding of student or-
gnnizntimls in other countries, and (b) Wnys 01'
improving exchange programs or various types.
A site tor this program has not as yet been
selected.

An investigation of academic freedom will
be the local point of the spring regional coniciu
once, to be held in late April or early May. Boll!
general theory and specific violations of academic
freedom will be studied. Speakers representing
V'ZX'FLOUS ,vig ‘vpoints will be inviiedvio addi‘JSS
the conference, and :1 policy declaration w
be made.

The biggest single problem facing all or these
programs at this time 15 :1 lack of people will—
ing to do some at the preliminary work. The
chairmanship ot the region is at Grinnell this
year, so. much or the responsibility rests square-
ly with us I would cordially invite any student
interested in any of these programs, or in NSA
in general, lo Contact me.
