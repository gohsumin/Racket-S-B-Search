No Immediate Decision
0:: Dormitory ("ﬂanges

It will be the end of Febl‘ual _.
at the earliest—belore a ﬁnal de-
cision is reached on revisions in
the housing system on North Cam-
pus. This according to Gl’innell’s
president Glenn Leggett.

“Fm thinking in terms of a
ireshman dorm and not so strong.
ly anymore about a senior dorm."
was the indication Leggett gave of
what the change might entail, He
also said that he was “just think-
ing aloud" when he spoke in these
terms and that this was not final.
’The procedure to be tollowed in
making the decision, according to
Leggeti, would be to have the Ex-
ecutive Council make recom-
mendations to Leggctr from the
opinions they have gathered. Leg<
gett then will cooler with the
deans and student leaders and pro
sent a “White Paper" at the end
at February.

Leggett indicated that the
changes will probably go into ei-
fect next fall.

The changes Leggett wants in
the housing system should, in his
words, make the system more
“flexible" than it is now and be
“loose enough so that it's exper-
imental."

Administration and faculty
members also tend to be dissatis-
fied with rule eillorccment on
North Campus by the elected oi-
iicials. This prompted Leggett to
say that proposals {or senior ad-
visurs or preceptors appointed by
the administration would be con-
sidered along witll other changes
in the housing rules.

This Sporiiiig Life

“Oh, God, if it’s for me, tell
’em I'm in the shower," and the

battle cry oi Women’s Weekend

echoed throughout North Campus,
as a suppressed giggle waited its
way from Loose to Mears.

While Visions of iolksingers and
wrestling matches danced in their

rusty

heads, girls resharpened
wiles and/or got various ghosts
out of closets [or their annual air-
ing as they comered or called the

hapless males oi the Harvard oi
the Midwest. Quite appropriately

the ilick for the Week is “This

gous to the sighing and shin-kick-
ing employed in this oldest oi

on campus—-the hunt.

Activities ior Friday night in-

clude the movie at 7:30 in ARl-l
and a square dance in Darby at
9:30 featuring Bob Lucas. At 8:00
on Saturday Carolyn Hester will
give a iolksingiug concert in Rob—

mal concert in the South Lounge
oi the Forum at 11:00, A dithy-
ramb will be held in Gardner
Lounge at 10:00. The movie will
be shown again at 9:30 Sunday
night.

Meanwhile, several attitudes
have been prevalenr among said
hapless males. There's the "oh,
to hell with it" school of thought,
the “c’est la guerl‘e” iantlon, and
the “oh dear, do you think she‘d
ever ask me out?” crowd. And
yet, there seems to be a bit of a
good reason for the general fuss,
bother, and uproar, for at last the

Desire for, greater efficiency.
uniformity, and respect [or SGA
was voiced Wednesday night dur-
ing a Student Senate discussion or
proposed student government re-
organization which would, among
other things, abolish the body
which gave life to the changes.

As reported by SGA President
I e rry Goddard, the Executive
Cabinet of the SGA feels that hav-
ing the Cam? and AWS Serve as
combined executive, legislative,
and perhaps judicial branch oi SGA
would eliminate the inefﬁciency
in maintaining three separate
branches.

The proposed System, according
to Senator Rick Heilbron, would
draw more respect from the col-
lege administration by the ensuing
uniformity between the rules and
their eniorcement.

Senator Robert Barrow ques-
tioned the supposition oi unilorm

 

 

entorcement by Claiming that
house presidents would he likely
to ignore unpopular rules, no mat-
ter which body iorinulated them.

Senator Jane Stracke agreed
that the proposed system would be
more cliicient, but she added. “Dic-
tatorships are efficient, too."

After opposition arose to the
elimination of the two student pri-
mary courts under the proposed
changes Goddard took time to ex-
plain that the proposal was made
because he “feels the student
court system should begin to act
more on the order of a committee
than a legal body” This, he said,
would be accomplished by having
the house presidents rather than
"magistrates” handle misconduct
cases.

More objection was raised to the
court changes, and Goddard av
greed to add some sort or pri«
moi-y court system .when iormal
proposals tor son reor - '
are brought before the

its next meeting. These formal
proposals will be in the form of
amendments to the SGA constitu-
tion. ‘

Senator Dan Bucks took the
floor to criticize the Senate as it
artists He said, “Generally, the
Senate has been domesticated e-
nough so that it okays policies de-
cided on beforehand by the E»
ecutive Cabinet, the COIHP, or the
AWS Board. Otherwise, it has been
little else than a legislative nui-
sance.”

Bucks said that he felt the Sen-
ate, it retained, could play its big-
gest role in the area of service
rather than in policy decisions,

Senator Dick Chady took a jab
at the proposals by questioning
what made the Senate capable oi

ment if, in the proposed system,

Grlnnell has adopted a limited
version of the passiall grading
system, ,7

Beginning next year, any sophdy
more, junior, or senior will be u”
lowed to take one course per 59’
mester on a credltriail basis, pro}
viding the course is neither a gory
cral requirement tor graduation
nor in the student's major field.

The new system, designated at
”creditiail" rather than "paw
fall," was approved in Monday'.
meeting of the general faculty by
what President Glenn Leggett do‘<
scribed as a “substantial major:
ity." s

Leggett said he was "very
pleased" that the proposal waj
approved, “What we want to do
is make all of our resources avail-
able tu Grinnell students. We want
to make sure that a science major
will not feel that he is hurting his
chances at gaining admission to
graduate school by taking a course
in Shakespeare, for tear that it
will lower his cumulative grade
average of course this could just
as well apply to an English ma-
jor interested in a particular phy-
siCs Course,"

One-Way Switch

A student may not elect to talio
a course on the creditvfail basis
after his final registration for the
course. He may, however, change
trom creditviail to the letter grade
basis at any time prior to the'
deadline for adding courses. ‘

Grades received for courses tak-
en on the new system will be deli-
ignated “credit” ,or “fail”. A
grade of “Credit" will not be in-
cluded in a student’s graderpoint
average. However, should a stu.
dent iail a course on the macho
tail basis, he will not only receive
0 Credits, but he will also have
an “F" to grade points per cred-
it) computed in his cumulative
grade-point average.

Following an editorial on pass-
Iail by former 5&3 Editor John
Woli, the passAiail system was is
main topic of discussion at the
Encampment Sept, 1749. A stu- ,
dent-iaculty committee, headed by
Co-chairmen Steve Kent and Ric
MacDowell, was organized to ex-
amine the possibilities of such I
system,

Make Revisions ' T

After receiving the report by tho
student-faculty committee, the Ex-
ecutive Council made revisions and
submlgted a proposal to the gen-
eral faculty, who returned the pro«
posal with suggestions for addi-
tional revisions. The newly-revised
proposal was then submitted to the
general faculty at Monday's meet-
mg.

“I am very hopeful about the
effects of this system," said Ken-
yon Knopf, chairman of the facul-
ty. tollowing its approval. “It is
a long step in reducing the term
phasis on particular grades. It ll
intended to encourage morn
breadth in the kind of Study fol-
lowed, and l am very enthusias-
tic about it."
