The Grinnoll REPORTER

Dr. Ninian Smart, who presented the
annual Gntw lectures two weeks ago.
Again this week I searched the paper
in vain ior such a review. it the college
thinks enough oi a scholar to pay him
to cross the ocean to present his ideas,
should the callow editors oi a school
paper ignore such an event? Or could
it he they didn't ieel equal to the task?

I suggest that the editorial staff
take A look Within at their own deficien-
cies, rather than givc the impression
of dissatisfaction with practically all
elements of Grinnell Illa: which im-
pression I tear they are giving to
friends and alumni of Gr'innell: "dam-
aging its image," in current parlance.

To the Editori

Now 'you’ve printed two naughty
words. The Board oi Publications didn’t
wash your typewriters out with soap
and the Post oiiice hasn’t revoked your
mailing privileges. i am, however,
deeply disappointed that you’ve been
satisﬁed with only two. Such an ad-
vancement certainly should have merit-
ed a larger editorial rather than the
mere inch or two it received.

1 can’t help but wonder how you man-
aged to contain yourselves in 12 page.
considering the relevance and news-
worthiness oi the topics. I’ve cancelled
my subscription to the llcgistcr be-
cause i vastly preier the sensitive,
penetrating, and comprehensive report~
ing oi national aiiairs iound in the he
porter. Since my iavorite section oi any
newspaper has always been the editor.
ial page, you can well understand my
disenchantment with the rtegister which
contains only one editorial page, My
growing aiiinity tor the Reporter can
be viewed as a reaction against the
traditional separation between objec-
tive newSareporting and editorial opin-
ion or news analysis. The Reporter is
unique in that you have achieved a
synthesis which emphasizes the latter
much to my gr ' 'cation.

I especially enjoy the digs on the ad-
ministration. but innuendoes and dour
ole entendres really don‘t satiate my
lust ior administration blood. Don‘t let
pettiness wallow in mediociity; the
FSM demands first rate blasphemy,

ty, that the masthead b~ replaced by a
Dean's rebuttal corner. Realizing that.
such space concession would prove suit.
ably coniined, such a column might
tend to obscure administration policy
to an even greater extent.

Unquestionably. last week’s outstand~
ing reature was the deliciously explicit
letter irom Miss Lemmons and Mr.
Dillon. For those oi us unable to at.
tend, they meticulously, it not tedious»
ly, described the tense and thrilling
events ,which precipitated 'ntesday’a
court case. since i've never been a
strong believer in due process nor
in its accompanying superstructure,
democracy, i naturally ignore the tact
that these details were printed‘before
the case was heard, 1 really needn't
add that this might have intluenced the
Court, but let’s overlook that triviaiity
and concentrate on the iundaincntal is-
sues such as the validity of sensational
cow.

In addition to relishing inanities and
prejudices, I‘m also very sympathetic
to the philosophy oi cultist journalism,
but only tor us elite. How naive oi Mr.
M to think his views valid and his
cr sni constructive. And how posi»
tively clever ot you to put him in his
decrepit place. Aiter all, you and I
know that his position implies a desire
to maintain intellectual and social iiei.
dom — student seridom to the leudai
deans. The new time some unenlight-
ened, piowar, proalicnation, and pin-
trivis individual criticizes the lteporter
unjustly, I want to see a really gaping
wound produced by your potent verbal
bullets. Enough oi those snide and cut-

tion.

I must say, though, that Mr. East»
man’s essay on education spoiled the
general tenor oi an otherwise ideal i

ly to clarify issues. 1 hope that they or
more oongruous with the remainder o
the content.

To the Editor:

After reading this week's Reporter,
I became thoroughly disgusted with
the way certain things were handled by
this rug! I am referring to Spring Riot
and Professor Magee's letter.

As the good professor noted, your
paper has been leaning toward worldly
and national news rather than what’-
going on around campus, Instead of
wasting space reporting on the New
York peace demonstration and you
could have given equal space to So
Francisco, it might have been nice i
someone wrote an objective story about
the riot and Spring Day. By not doing
this, you gave an unfair representation
of the happening; by showing iu-t
a iew pictures and allowing coverage
in your letter page of one unfortunate
incident, you showed but one side of it
dualafaced incident.

I now return to Professor Magoo,
You judge his letter as a non-con-
stiuctive outburst," yet, in my opinion,
he did not just Sly that the Reporter
is becoming a lousy paper tor its in-
tended purpose, but told you why he
lelt so. and what he felt your content
should be. i wish to remind you that it
we want to know about peace demon-
strations, and other offrcanlpus goings-
on we can read the Register or listen to
To . or radio news broadcasts.

ltiy iinal statement brings together
both of the above-menﬁoned gripes. I
feel that as long as you are going in
make nonconstructive criticism oi the
riot. you should be the t ones to no-
clue anybody else’s cl'i cism of your
paper or anything else as being nonT
constructive, This is the old case or
the pot calling the kettle black. I \vrota
this letter because I sort of like your
paper, you know; it isn't all bad, just
most of it!

hek S. Piermout
hope you accept my construe-

To the Editor:

Really, Mr, Magee, Wasn’t it in your
Intro to Political Science class last
year that I learned about weltanschau-
ring? i wish to commend the staii or
the Reporter for raising college jour—
nalism above the level of a high heel
tabloid whose lead story is a straight
news article on a required, allaichaol
assembly.
