These politicians, Unruh

Unruh added that the ”Reagan

The Speaker said this “ma<

"MEET THEM AT THEIR OWN LEVEL"

COEDS SLOW
TO REPEL
INVADERS

By DEBBIE GENTRY

Mears, Cleveland, Haines and
Read dormitories had, reports
say, from five to twelve male
visitors Saturday night long af-
ter permitted visiting hours.

It all apparently began at
about 11:30 on Moars second,
where one of the men walked
unannounced into a room, sur.
prising a girl in bed. He asked
where room 450 was, and then
left. She leaped out of bed and
put on her bathrobe.

The male visitors returned a
few minutes later, a witness
said. The girl shouted for them
to leave.

They went to Cleveland, where
they ran up to the second and
third floors. One girl who was
having a crazy foam (like light
shaving cream; it is used for
play) party with a friend in
the bathroom said she heard
their voices.

“We thought it was just an
illegal," the Cleveland girl
added, “and we started gig.

gling, but then one of them came

into the bathroom, and grabbed
my friend who was only wear-
ing pajama tops and panties,
and said: ‘Give me a kiss.’

“She was fighting him off and
I was hitting him and trying
to shut the door on him, All
sorts of people came running
out of their rooms and pan-
icked. Someone ran downstairs
to try and fetch Steve Aldrich,
the Resident Advisor’s hus-
hand."

Meanwhile, another girl, who
had been giving a team, lett
her room to discover the ma
son tor the screams coming
from the bathroom.

A witness said: “She was

Craig Allin, program director
at the unaired college radio sta-
tlou, submitted his resignation
to station manager Babnk Ar—
majani "litesday.

Allin, one of the founders of
this most recent attempt to es-
tablish radio at Gl‘innell, cited
lack of time as one reason for
his resignation. He also stated
that the “administration is
guilty of breaking faith” with
the staff of the radio station.

Station manager Armajalli
elaborated on the significance
of “breaking faith." Tile stu-
dents were to establish a staff,
apply for a license, and submit
requests and plans to the ad—
ministration for equipment and

a studio. “We have a staff, and
we have done our part of get-
ting the license, but the equip-
ment we wanted has been slow
in arriving, and the studio is
only now being started," ex~
plained Armajani,

Mr. Walden told the radio
station staff that the facilities,
to be located in the northwest
corner of Darby Gym, should
be completed by December 1K.
The station hopes to be on the
air the first day of second so-
master.

The radio station will make
a progress report to the stu-
dents of the college at an open
Senate meeting Tuesday at 7
p.m. in ARI-l auditorium.

very angry, and tearcup threat-
eningly in hand, ordered them
to get out. One of them wrestled
with her, she broke loose and
would have thrown the cup at
him, but it was her favorite,"

They were chased by the girls
out of Cleveland and ran into
lfaines.

By this time there were only
three oi them. A girl on Hail-res
second stated; “I was sitting
on the bed in my underwear
knitting when my bedroom door
opened and there was this guy
standing there.

" ‘Oh, excuse mei’ he said
and closed it. Then a second
guy opened the doorl l shouted,
'Get out of herel‘

“ ‘Do I have to?’ he asked.
'Of course you do‘ I answered,
and shut the door and held it,”

These were not high school
kids, but looked like college
students, she added.

Myrna Aldrich, resident ad-
visor of Cleveland said that
there was no substantial evi-
dence as to who they were.

“But," she concluded “they
were here and now they're
gone.”

Back in l-laines second bath-
room, ono of the more adven-
turous types was rattling the
stalls.

A girl told me: “A guy
peered over the toilet door. I
hit him over the head and
shouted ‘Wllo the hell do you
think you are? Get the hell out
of herel’

(“My mother once told me
that you have to meet them
at their own level and talk to
them in their own language,”
she later confided to her res—
ident advisor, Suzi Argenti.)

“My roommate, trapped in the
shower, whispered, ‘Don’t leave
me, Don’t leave me.’ She
chased him out of the bath-
room.”

Read second was the next and
last.

“All of a sudden I heard
mens’ voices laughing and shout-
ing,” a girl stated, “I shut the
door and they left,”

But they came back! Half an
hour later a Read second girl
was in the shower when a
man’s head and hands appeared
under the door of her shower
stall.

“I heard frantic screams
from the bathroom," her neigh-
bor said, ‘It was really fright-
ening. I ran to help my friend
and stepped on some glass from
a broken bottle dropped in
fright by one of the boys."

Recalling reports of the inci-
delit later, a Loose girl mused:

”Pity they didn't get as far
as Loose.“

DRAFT CARD BALLOTS
PROPOSES U.N.l. PROF

(Ed, note: The followlngis an
excerpt from a speech given
Wednesday night in the South
Lounge by Professor Edward
Hoffmans, Hottmans, an Eng-
lish teacher at the University
of Northern Iowa, was the au-
thor of an article in the student
paper which advocated the use
of civil disobedience to end the
draft.

Following the appearance of
that article, six Blackhawk
County legislators demanded
Hnﬂmans‘ removal from the
University. Fifteen teachers It
UNI also publicly denounced
Hoffmans in an open letter to
the paper.

While President Maucher of
the University supported Hoff-
mans’ right of free speech, the
UNI paper said it would not
print any future article advo-
cating illegal acts.

At a peace demonstration In
Cedar Falls October 18, Hoff-
mans turned In his draft card
by proxy to the federal gov-
ernment. At this time, no action
has been taken against Hoff-
mans, and the University has
declared it will remove him
only In the event he is prosca

HOW AMERICANS
CAN VOTE FOR LOVE

By ED HOFFMANS

A genuinely free electoral
process incorporates a basical-
ly nonviolent idea: that ballot:

are superior to bullets for re-
solving disputes among men and
nations.

. . . American ballots with
names like .1 n hn s on, Nixon,
Reagan, Romney or Gavin on
them are unlikely to stop the
bullets currently being used to
resolve the Vietnam dispute, In
other words, the present kind
of American ballot is incapable
of performing its natural func<
tion.

Hence the reform of Ameri-
can electoral politics calls for
the adoption of a new kind of
ballot. Impersonal ballots bear-
ing the names of politicians
who falsely claim to represent
our best interests must give way
to personalized ballots with tho
names of people we can trust.

And what could be more per«
sonalized than a ballot with tho
voter’s own name and signa.
ture? Draft cards should be the
ballots for our new electoral
system.

Electoral systems also requlu
voting booths for the deposit of
ballots. Federal marshails' of-
fices and in d u c ti o n centers
should be the voting booths of
our new electoral politics.

An electoral process features
the deposit of a ballot in a
voting booth, The new process
will work the same way. fea<
turing the deposit of a citizen’s
draft card in a Federal mar-
shalls' office or induction center.

Our new electoral process
would produce four benefits.

Firstly, draft card returner!
