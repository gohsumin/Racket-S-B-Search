SCARLET AND ELACK

 

ﬁ

By Paul Trigg

Word has it that the University of Iowa is going to win
the Big Ten basketball race this winter and go on to smash
iJ.C.L.A. for the national championship i at least this is What
torn-fed intellectuals on this campus are predicting And I
ask you, what loyal follower of any team wouldn’t think the
..ame after watching their heroes dismantle Michigan State on
television last Saturday 111-65 to set a new school scoring
record. Following this was that tremendous upset Victory at
lndialla on Monday night. These wins pushed the Hawkeye’s
record to four wins and one defeat in conference play. I
hasten to add a word of caution, however, to those avid
iollowers of the Hawkeyes to “keep their heads." I have
been trying for three years to determine the point where
the Iowa fan’s rationale terminates' and fanatacism com-
mences, and I believe it is when the team goes one game
above the .500 mark with at least two-thirds of the season
left.

Even an outsider can’t help but admire new Coach Ralph
Miller, however, for the job he has done at Iowa City in less
than a year. He immediately took one step in the right direc-
tion when he wound up with only two of his first six players
irom Iowa (two are froln Illinois, one from New Jersey and
one from Michigan]. The reasoning here is obvious; the compe-
tition in the Big Ten is stiff and basketball talent sufficient
to compete is lacking in the Iowa high school ranks. The only
way in which Iowa can be a consistent Winner is by importing
players from basketball-rich states such as Illinois and In-
diana.

I am not here to discuss the merits of out-of-state re-
cruiting, or the possibilities for Iowa‘s basketball future but,
rather, to dispel those dreams of a Big Ten championship
this year. Let us look at the record so far. They have won
four Big Ten games: two over Michigan State, one over Wis-
consin, and one over Indiana. There was nothing unusual
about the first three victories except the score of the second
Michigan State game. In the first half of that game Iowa shot
a rousing 54% while State was hitting at less than a 25% clip.
The Indiana game was truly an upset since it was on Indiana’s
home court. Again, however, their opponents had a cold night
as Indiana had bagged only 20 points at halftime.

In short, although this is a good team, it will take
quite a bit more proof before most outsiders will predict any~
thing above a fifth place finish for this Iowa outfit. To those
cries of, “Bring on U.C.L.A.” and “Bring on Michigan," they
will get their chance on January 29 and February 8. Let’s
discuss it again after those games.

At the last CofHP meeting Sun-
day, .Ian. 10, Dean or Men 5.
Eugene Thompson asked the house
presidents to see that the dis-
placed oif—campus residents of
INS Park St. get north campus
rooms that are in line with their
class Standing.

Under this plan, freshmen liv-
ing alone in doubles could be
asked to take a different room if
his room were requested by 1019
residents. Other necessary rear-
rangements would also be con-
sidered.

The 1019 men will return to north
campus at their convenience dur‘
ing the interim Session.
Thompson also relayed a mes-
sage from Forum Director Mrs.
Jewell Hawk. He noted that Mrs.
Hawk has been concerned over
the “general sluppiness" of Forum-
goers, especially in the use of
cigarettes. Thompson said that
more ashtrays will be made avail-
able shortly. *
Thompson commented on stu-
dent courts, saying that the mag-
istrates don't seem to have the
same view of their job as do stu-
dent government officials. l-le al-
so commented, “I don't under-
stand it, but the student judges
seem to like their jobs."

Thompson Comments on Courts

Thompson said he holds hope
that the present court setup will
give way [0 more informal court
sessions. He concluded that no
matter what the setup, there will
always be some cases that just
can't be handled by student courts
and that in the end, “We may have
to depend on good will.”

In other business, Pete Read,
CofHP president. listed (our cl}
jectives he wants fulfilled before
the current house presidents leave
office. Read cited the need for 1)
an analysis of CofHP election pro-
cedure, 2)) positive suggestions
from the CofHP‘s Buildings and
Grounds comminee, a) a meeting
of the CDIHP with the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs, and
4) a revision of the student hand-
book.

Read also noted that as of Jan.
hi, in north campus halls except
Clark and Rawson had had their
social funds frozen for non-pay-
merit oi long-outstanding bills.
