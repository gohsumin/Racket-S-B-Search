The Courlrighl Cartoon:

Tlle cartoon submitted by Paul B. Courtrigllt, wllicll ‘-

appears in the Letters to the Editor column, desel es some
note, and some careful reexamination. Much as we ﬂppl'ecir
ate Courtrlght's artistic abilities it appears to lls to be
something of a misrepresentation. The young lnan pictu

ed ill the Collrtright cartoon is represented as a very un-
savory character. We are not about to deal here with the

problems of conformity or nonconfornlity, which we feel _
to be strictly the business of individuals What is important .

is that the group which went to Washington took every
precaution against just such misinterpretation.

In all effort to show that they were not merely non-
coniornlists, campus beats or wllat have you, haircuts,

suits, wllite shirts, shoe polish and the like were the order »

of the day. The group did not forget for one minute that
they would be viewed as students of Grinnell College, and
that their best purposes would be suited by a conscious at-
tempt to avoid such questions of personal appearance as
Courtright’s cartoon would suggest.

Furthermore, the appearance of the emblem of the Stu-
dent Peace, Union is not accurate as pertaining to the group
as a whole. The fourteen were careful to avoid in all pubr
licity releases, and all personal statements, any connection
between the group and national organizations. Many of
the people wllo went to Washington have no alliance with
the Grinnell Students for Peace, except a sympathy for
some of their causes. Such cartoons as the one Courtrigllt
has submitted may be dangerously misleading wllen not
qualified by accurate information.

A Fast of Support

It has been most encouraging to see the response to
the Washington trip. Whether for or against the methods
the group is advocating, the response of members of the
faculty, administration, press and the officials in Washing-
ton has been polite, tolerant, and ill almost all cases re-
spectful.

Several people, however, have been confused by the
stand the group is taking. The group is not registering a
protest against the United States Government. The group
is supporting the present presidential reluctance to test
nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Their action, we feel,
is a positive one, and a good sign of serious student feel-
ing for the matter.

The'Edgren Resolution

Among the significant topics of conversation spa' d
by the recent flurry of activity over the Senate's “testing
resolution” and the pilgrimage to Washington by 14 of its
more \‘ocalrsupporters is tlli Does the Senate have the
right to pass a resolution which expresses an opinion con-
cerning affairs not relating specifically and solely to this
campus'.7 We think that the Senate, as a group of students,
expressing alld representing their own opinions, certainly
has this right. And most students, we feel, would agree.

The majority of current disagreement seems to lie in
whether or not the Senate, as a group charged with the
responsibility of representing the campus in a common
forum, has the right to hand down resolutions relating to
other than campus affairs, resolutions which would and
are naturally taken to be indicitive of a majority of cam—
pus feeling because they are the product of an elected
senate.

We could not give away the Senate’s right to
make resolutions concerning any affairs, campus or other—
wise, on the supposition that the senate does not represent
the feeling of the campus. If it doesn’t then the fault lies
with those who elected the “poor representatives,” Repre-
sentative government would not, as many have argued, be
representative government if it did not involve the trans—
fer of decisiolhmaking powers from a majority to an elect—
.ed minority.

However, we would not deny the right of any students
to make clear their stand on any resolution passed by the
Senate; we would not_deny them the right to demand that
their qualification or their corroboration of any resolution
be attached to it.

Des Moines Register Speaks
In Favor 0f Washingh’an Trip

(Ed. Note — The rollowing editorial appeared in Wednesday's

gesﬁloines Register under the headline “Grinnellinns Speaking
1) :

Thirteen Grinnell College students are on their way to
the White House where they plan a three~day “sit and fast"
demonstration against resumption of U. S. nuclear testing
in the atmosphere They go with permission (neither ap-
proval nor disapproval, they say) of the college administra-
tion, and with the implied blessing of the Student Govern—
ment Association.

The student senate last week approved by 29 to 17 a
resolution against renewed U. S. testing The “Students
Fasting for Peace" group got together shortly afterward.
The president of the Grinnell student government said that
the demonstrators will speak for themselves and are not
sponsored by the student organization. However, the student
senate implied its approval by giving the 13 permission to
distribute the Grinnell antictest'ing resolution in Washing
ton, D. C.

During the 1950's lnuch was written about a supposed
political and philosophical apathy among college students.
They were said to have been bored with any cause beyond
$10,000 year and a good pension program. We are glad to
see that the students of Grinnell College, at least, are think-
ing now about other concerns and are speaking out. If the
“sit and fast” expedition has some aspects of a happy—go—
luchy student adventure, it also shows a concern with world
affa .

Tile 13 demonstrators may be commended for having
the courage of their convictions, the student body for con-
sidering and taking a stand on a serious national issue.
and the college administration for maintaining a tolerant
attitude toward a rather unconventional enterprise. ‘

It is to be hoped, however, that other college students
will raise questions about the wisdom of the U S, not
undertaking nuclear weapons tests in the air, so long as the
Soviet Union continues testing and will not agree to in-
ternational controls to supervise a test ban.

 

lnent of just such a l ght will come before the Senate
next week. Submitted by Gates hall representative John
Edgren, the motion requests that “For any resolution pass-
ed by the Grinnell College Student Senate of significance
beyond the college (as one dealing with national or inter»
national affairs) there shall be held a referendumto the
student body on precisely the same question upon receipt

of a petition signed by ten per cent of, the student body or,.

at the direction of the Executive Cabinet. In any publicity
the results of this referendum shall accompany the Senate's
resolution."

We think the motion is a good one, and deserves care-
ful consideration.

To the Editor:

VVlth tllc onset or the decade
of the nineteen fifties, a new
attitude has swept American
campuses This is manifested in
the form of conservative pas-
sivlty. We seem to have cast aside
the traditional role of the dis-
scntcr, whether of thc right or
the loft. Ecchusc of the relative
lack of l'csponslbilltv of the stu-
dent to persons and institutions
savc himsclr and his ideals, he
has the opportunity and the ob-
ligation to act decisively and
unequivocally upon his beliefs.

Unlike the liberal, who must
constantly revise and compro~
mise his ends in attempting to
reconcile them with “reality,”
the radical may, and must, act‘
solely on the basis of his ideals,
regardless of their political fe
ibllity or social repcccussich..
His goals become the callot
which ehuces and stimulates
society on to new directions and
greater achievements. This is
the rule the student must as—
sume.

The students fasting in Wash-
ington deserve our highest
praise, not necessarily for the
position they espouse, but run
their courageous action. Our crit-
icism should be directed at the
letharglc students who fail either
to support their colleagues, or to
organize a counter-action.
Apathy is morally wrong.

opinlm‘ls are mine.

Consistently. an active Iniiicl‘~
ity has voiced us. opinions on
an apathetic (only in the sense
that it does not stage peace
marches and mass demonstra-
tions) student body. This group

has classed themselves as
“Osagyefos”7ali wise, and have

looked down with contempt up-
on anyone who does not share

their God-given opinions.

These selfvrnade messiahs have
forced a seemingly mass con-
formity on campus. They have
pressured the student senate to
pass resolutions and to use the
student body's money question—
ably ir not unconstitutionally for
interviews and press center-
ences. They have constantly
given false impressions to the
public or Grinnell student opin-
ion. These students who consider
themselves to be intelligent, un-
biased students have consistent»
ly been unintelligent and
ccccllhgly biased in their con
sideration of issues that have
confronted the Grinnell sludem.
