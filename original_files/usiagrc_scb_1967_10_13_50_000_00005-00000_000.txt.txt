SCARLET AND BLACK

GRINNELL YEARBOOK CENSORED

(In the interests of muck-
raking, we present a Carle<
tonian point or view.)

By RON FISCUS

Grinnell College has a new
nudent newspaper, and a new
yearbook. Or is it that Grinnell
has the oldest student newspa-
per and oldest yearbook west
or the Mississippi? A simple
Question? You judge.

Last tall, newspaper editor
Krystina Neuman decided to
change the name of the Scarlet
J: Block, which was indeed the
oldest college newspaper west
oi the Mississippi, to the ne—
porter. (Official Grinnell publi-
cations also boast that Grinnell
has, among other things the
oldest outdoor paddle tennis
courts west oi the Mississippi.
The unoiiicial student version
has it that certain other out-
dated Campus buildings tall in
to that category. Some even
suggest that Grinnell has the
oldest administration west of
the Mississippi (Be that as it
may, it Carls are inclined to
laugh at the College‘s preten-
tions, they might do well to take
note of the latest in Tea Room
tea bags.)

The new name for the news-
paper stuck despite vociferous
opposition from traditionalists,
and the Reporter went its way
raking all the muck that it saw

iit to print, in the iinest tra-
dition of student newspapers.
But Miss Neuman happened to
be a close iriend of, and or:-
casional model tor, photographer
Henry Wilhelm, who just hap-
pened to be one oi the co-ed-
itors oi the 196586 yearbook,
and here the plot thickens.

Wilhelm, too, had a penchant
for namechanging. having
changed the name oi the year-
book from the Cyclone (oldest
west of the. . . yeah, right) to
onnneu College 1966. The saga
of Gl'lnllell College load is some-
thing else again, Plagued by
chronically postponed deadlines,
it never reached the printer un-
til the spring oi 1967, and even
then it was whisked back to
the College with a request ior
a disclaimer of responsibility.
The yearbook, it seemed, had
changed more than its name.
It purportedly showed pictures
at a pot party and of student
couples leaving a local motel.
it contained few pictures oi
homecoming, the cheerleaders,
or any of the other more tra-
ditional aspects of campus life.

The college was advised that
It Would be risking libel suits
it the yearbook were printed
in its name. There ensued, as
one might expect, a controversy
with Grinnell landing in the

pages of Newsweek, and even
making the women's section of
the Minneapolis Star.

The College proposed that the
(mostly iaculty) Committee on
Student Publications revie W
(edit? censor?) the Copy in con-
junction with the Coiiege's le-
gal counsel, Editor Wilhelm re-
iused, retained possession oi
the copy, which was legally his,
and determined to have it pub-
lished privately.

Meanwhile. Miss Neuman (re
member her and the Reporter?)
was iuming over the College's
“inability to deal with contro«
versial s t u d e n t publications"
and perhaps even more over
her ejection irom a meeting oi
the Committee on Student Pub-
lications, of which she was a
non-voting member. of the coni-
mittee members, she was the
only one who had seen the
copy.

In protest, she resigned as
editor or the neporter, leaving
Grinnell without a newspaper
or a yearbook, but with the
biggest squabble west oi the
Mississippi.

Finally, this tall. new editors
for both the newspaper and the
yearbook were found. The news
paper has been renamed the
Scarlet Jr Black, the yearbook
the Cyclone. Grinnell College

A STUDENT OPINION

PUTS DOWN GRINNELI. MEN

"The Grinneil man must be
everything just enough, but
nothing too much —- good look-
ing enough, religious enough,
athletic enough, ablo enough.

“He must measure up to 1
standard of what has been
called a ‘handsome mediocri-
ty‘. He is a sort of youthful,
highly idealized portrait of a
Rotarian. The Grinneil girl is
all this likewise. in 8 word—
speciiic description is unneces-
sary—she is the ideal mate of
the Grinnell man.

“It can be seen that to main-
tain the eminent niceness or
this artistocracy, there is not
much room {or difference.
T h era is something in this
mild, sweet leniency that tends
to acquiescence. In tact. the
danger of becoming ‘the Grin-
neli type’ has sent many an in-
teresting youngster hot toot out
o! Grinnell. It should be added,

iege publication, will be pub-
lished before Christmas; and
Grinnell College, oldest college
west oi the you~know~what, il
at least a year older.

however, that several highly
interesting scandals have
come bursting through thin
Imiling surtace. . .

"Grinnell is not the place in
which to look for eagerness o!
inquiry, youthful audacity 01
thought or action, really stir.
ring intellectual currents. But
it has always had and doe I
still have a personal and inti-
mate charm.”
