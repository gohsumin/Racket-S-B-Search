Al?
F .r

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell home baseball season started last weekend,
and the opener was one long yawn. The game seemed about
as exciting as an 8:00 humanities class on Monday morning,
What kind of baseball is it when the Pioneers can muster
only two hits in fourteen innings? A pretty dull kind i my
book. "

Some strange quirk of fate brought me late to the game
in the bottom of the fourth inning with the score 10 in favor
of Monmouth. So far, so good. I then sat back and saw the
real “excitement" of the game when Gl‘innell “pounded out”
three runs on six walks.

Then, of all things, in the top of the fifth I saw a hit. I
did not realize that the gods on Olympus had been so kind to
me — to let me see this great action — until I watched more.
The rest of the game was like watching a Met-Houston thriller
on TV.

Even to the most casual observer, as I was then, it was
easy to see that the poor Monmouth pitcher did not have it
in that big fourth inning. But he finished the inning as the
Monmouth coach paced on the sidelines. After watching three
Pioneers walk to first base, it took real courage for the pitcher
to stick out the next three walks. For this great dis lay of
courage, the coaches of the nine other Midwest con erence
teams ought to give him a reward —- another year of eligi-
bility so he can continue to pitch against their clubs.

After seeing those two exciting innings, I forced myself
out to the golf course (to play golf). When I came around
and caught a glimpse of the game from the course, nothing
could have seemed more unappealing to me.

The Pioneers did pull some tricky maneuvers that in-
trigued me, though. First, they had no first base coach, and
second, they had Morgan Michel as third base coach. I will
not deny that Morg is a big morale booster, but the third
base coach is a responsible job not ’to be filled by a cheer-
leader. And even IM teams have first base coaches.

There must be some underlying reason for that piece
of strategy. Coach Pfitsch probably figures if a Pioneer gets
a hit, he is good enough to be his own coach. Of course if most
of the runners get to first on walks, they do not need a coach.
Then if the runner gels to third, he needs somebody to wake
him up, because he has probably got weary-eyed from watch-
ing the Grinnell batters. And Michel is certainly a person
who can wake up the runner.

When I heard Dennis Hanssen had pitched a no-hitter,
I was sorry I missed it, naturally, but the thought of having
to sit through seven innings with only one Grinliell hit
changed my mind. I was glad I had played golf. 1 almost could
picture how Grinnell got its run—walk, walk, walk, and error.
As it turned out, my prediction was right, except it was in
reverse order.

Unfortunately, I hit as many good balls on the golf
course as the Pioneers did on the diamond, so I ended up
with a poor score. But it would have taken about a 75 for the
nine for me to have been sorry for missing the rest of the
doubleheader.

Don’t get me wrong. I am happy the Pioneers won. But
if this is the way they are going to be playing for the rest
of the year, it is going to be a long season for the fans.

Freshmen lose First Game to Simpson;
luck of Hitting Power Hurts the Team

By Jim Wilson

The (rush baseball team last its
opening game of the season to
Simpson College Tuesday 4—3. The
Pioneers fell behind 1-0 in the first
inning on one of two unearned runs
alloted to Simpson. The other two
Simpson runs came on a home run
with one man on in the fifth in-
ning.

Greg Dean was the starting
pitcher for the Pioneers and was
charged with the loss. Dean gave
up only five hits and struck out
eleven batters. He also contributed
to the Grinnell cause with a home
run in the fourth inning. Dean was
relieved by Greg Erickson in the
seventh inning. Erickson was able
to hold Simpson scoreless but the
Pioneers were unable to bring the
needed runs home,

hits, a home run by Dean and sin<
gles by Jim Kinyorl and Dave Mar-
ion. The {rash scored their other
two runs in the seventh inning
when a Wild throw to second base
allowed the two Pioneers, who had
reached base on walks, to score.

The team will try to get into
the winning column when they
play Coe next Wednesday at Coo.
