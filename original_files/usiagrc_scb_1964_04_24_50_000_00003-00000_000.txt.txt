An “Americanism Award"

A surgeon was forced to re

A relative of mine recently
back from a trip to South
America reports that in Brazil
a cup of instant coffee costs
more than twice as much as a
cup of regular coffee The rear

coffee is put on freighters and
shipped to the United States
where it is processed and pack—

This year’s crop of graduat-
ing seniors who may have. on
occasion, wondered about the
relative merits of a college ed-
ucation should take note of the
results of a recent advertising

found that college graduates
are only half as susceptible to
advertising messages as per-
sons who have only had a high
school education,

President Johnson's “War on
Poverty” (which at best might
be termed a minor skirmish be:
cause less than 1% of the fed
eral budget of $98 billion is to
be used in fiscal 1965 for the
anti-poverty campaign as com-
pared to $54 billion for defense,
and'SS billion for space re-
search) has already stirred a
few citizens to words of out-
rage. Repi Otto Passman (D-
Lal) came out recently with
the following rather unique
critical statement “The Presi-
dents statement that 20% of
Americans are poverty stricken
has led some people to believe
were all starving to death.”—
Remember Mr. Passman, we
can't all be smart enough to in—
herit a department store

Miscellany and Digression

Today's society is faced with
m a n y perplexing problems.
,ivil rights, the developing na-
eions, and the cold war are but
a, few which receive prominent
attention from the press, But,
as has been pointed out by such
people as James Reston, the
press often gives little attention
to the trends which cause those
events which make headlines.
Among these trends is what
may be termed the technologie
Cal revolution for lack of a bet-
ter namel Everyone is aware of
the presence of this revolution,
but an understanding of the na-
ture of this revolution and its
implications for the future has
not yet evolvedKAs yet we have
not fully comprehended the
type of society we have con-
structed and what it means,
C e r t a. i n manifestations of
this revolution do make the
headlines, . . r the breakdown
in collective bargaining in the
railroad and newspaper indus—
tries and the unemployment
statistics. For the words ”tech-

nological unemployment” no
longer constitute a phrase but
a reality Machines are replac»
ing men.

Statements to the effect that
for each job destroyed by an
advance in technology an equal
or greater number are created
offer no solution even if their
doubtful accuracy is accepted.
A railroad fireman, who has
been working at a job that be«
came Obsolete With the intro-
duction of the diesel engine,
will not be equipped to handle
any jobs that might be created
by advancing technology.

Unions are faced with the
conservative and even reaction-
ary task of protecting the jobs
of unutilized and unnecessary
workers. Management, on the
other hand must keep pace with
the technological revolution by
employing the latest in equip-
ment.

Neither the lives and fortunes
of men nor the pace of science
and technology can be denied.
To deny either would be to in-
vite ruin. Still something must
be done,

Retraining does not provide
an adequate solution. It can be
successful in only very limited
circumstances and within very
limited confines, Education as
yet provides no answerr For
the more educated men we pro-
duce, the faster our society
advances leaving us further
and further behind.

While management and labor
argue and long-term unemploy»
ment increases, the technolog-
ical revolution irresistibly ad-
vances creating both the won-
ders and the problems of the
twentieth century. If we let our
society far outrrun our under~
standing of that society we in-
yite disaster.

The Senate Scene

By WADE STEVENSON

The Student Senate Wednesday night defeated a motion to
appropriate $270 for a broken science building windowr A1 Gum<
merson, C of HP representative, spoke in favor of the motion
and explained that there was sufficient evidence to indicate
that a student had broken the window with an empty liquor
bottle, >

During debate, a number of senators wished to know why
the person responsible for the damage could not be appres
hendedr Gummerson indicated that certain people knew who the
guilty party was, but these people would not testify again?
the person, When the vote was taken on the motion, not :-
single senator voted to appropriate the money

The Executive Cabinet vetoed a Senate resolution which
required campus organizations to submit “detailed statement:
of financial condition" to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Marilyn Alt moved that the vetoe be overridden by the Senate.

While debating Miss Alt’s motion, Phil Johnson, S. G A.
President, said that “when the Student Senate starts to in-
volve itself in every organization’s finances, the Student GOV-
ernment will get bogged down,” Johnson also said that such a
resolution would cause an "inordinate amount of trouble.”

Nancy Cox, chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
said that “after talking with the Student Auditor, it is apparent
that he thinks the resolution is a good one."

After sufficient debate, the Senate upheld the Executive
Cabinet's veto.

Phil Johnson introduced a car rule resolution which read
in part that the Student Senate “requests that the present rule
be clearly defined, with attention to:

a. The consequences of a violation of the rule.

b. The offices responsible for the administration of the rule.

1:, The procedures to be used in handling any violation or

request for exemption"

In favoring the resolution, Johnson stated that “nobody
seems to know who is responsible for car rule decisions and
nobody seems to know who is responsible for apprehending the
violators.

Karen Adkinson Stated that “the Senate would be yielding
initiative if it voted for this measure. Also, not enough time
was given for Senators to come up with alternative proposals
or amendments.” Miss Adkinson then moved that the resolution
be postponed for a week. The motion was adopted by the Senate.

Sam Grossman, Jerry Goddard, and Ed Johnson were ap-
proved as menlbers of the Men's Primary Court.

in a final bit of business, M " yn Alt moved that the Sen-
ate send a directive to Paul Courtright to pick up a pop machine
money box from Mrs, Lord in Haines Halli Miss Alt indicated
that she had talked to Courtrlght at least three times about
the money box.

Nancy Cox explained that "Mr. Courtright has just gotten
a typhoid shot and is a bit under the weather," Miss Cox indi-
cated that a directive would not be necessary and that she
would talk to Mr. Courtright about the money box. Amid ap<
plause and laughter, the Senate defeated Miss Alt's motion for
a directive and, in doing this, gave a vote of sympathy to those
who must struggle through the rigors of typhoid shotsi
