quarter before John Loventhal
gave the Pioneers the lead on
a twenty-seven yard field goals

Coe bounced back in the
iourth quarter when Alan Rowe
plunged over for a TD and
Doug Eocckman booted the com
version.

After an exchange or punts,
Grinnell took the ball on its own

Momentarily halted on the cue

hang on to the ball as John Bus~
well banged out a ﬁrst down on
a fourth down situation

Quarterback Kent Thomson
sprinted from the nine to cli-

max the drive with the winning
TD with only 1:21 left, on the
clock. Tom Lower passed to
Mike Schwartz for a two point
