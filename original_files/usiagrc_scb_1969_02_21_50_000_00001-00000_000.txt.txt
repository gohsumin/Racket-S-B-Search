Radio Editorial Causes Controversy

On Tuesday, February 11 over KDIC
radio, Neil Fischer and Greg Schmidt
gresenied one of their iii-weekly news

ommentaries, in which they comment
on various news events in a creative
Way.

Although humorous in intent, the show
was potentially libelous to Henry Wil-
helm whose role in the demonstration
against Playboy magazine was an
olyzed.

According to Greg Schmidt, this par
ticular show “was intended to be a hu-
morous commentary on the exploitation
oi protest resulting from the protest on
the exploitation of sexuality."

Upon hearing the editorial by Fischer
and Schmidt, Mrs. Prescott, director 0!
the iniormation service, requested a
eopy of the full text, on Thursday, she
sent the commentary, as “a point of in-
formation only” it) the AP and UPI wire
services, KGRN radio, the Des Moines
Register, the Herald Register, and the
Scarlet and Black, Mrs. Prescott stated
that the editorial was a “potential tare

at for outside news.” Thereiore she
elt, it was desirable that the complete
document be made available in order
to be “protective of everybody con-
¢emed." She was afraid that an inex-
perienced reporter would take isolated
quotes out of their proper context. On
Thursday, A? wire service contacted
Henry Wilhelm, who had not heard the
broadcast but read it in the copy sent

y Mrs. Prescott to the S and B office.

Playboy Called ”Printed Aphrodisiac“

011 October 5, 1966 after attending his
first meeting of the ADM as president of
Grinneil, Leggett made the following
statement in reaction to a speech given
at the meeting:

"I can agree that it might be lnterest~
ing to bring Playboy into the classroom
as a sociological document; maybe it is
part of the liberal education of our slur
dents. But somewhere toward the end
of the class hour we ought to have ar-
rived at the point of saying that Playboy
is essentially a printed aphrodisiac for
dirty old men and [or sleepless young

men who will grow into dirty old men
it they continue to think that women are
so simple and sex so free and clear."
“All this may seem far removed from
student value systems and student un-
rest but my point is that I think our job
in undergraduate liberal arts colleges is
to create an environment that will per-
mit the development oi effective and re-
sponsible value systems in our students,
and that this belief ought to be the con-
ditioning agent in out attitudes toward
our various constituencies, oi which
students, or course, an the chiei."

ﬁve hour hearing. Under Iowa law the
prosecution may elect to call witnesses
to testify despite a defense waiver of
the right to a preliminary hearing, Sub.

an employee oi United Press Interna-
tional in Des Moines, emerged from the
court room after twenty minutes of
testfying and remarked, “What a farce!"
Grinnell Police Chief Bill Peters and
Grinnell detective Larry Ray were the
first two witnesses called by Enich.
Photographers Henry Wilhelm and Krys-
tyna Neuman were also called to testify
before a noon recess. Grinnell students
called to testify were S.G.A. President
Tom Thomas, 5&1! Editor Susan Kaeser,
and Jim Lew.

Shortly after Chief Peters, the first
witness, began his testimony, the coun-
sel [or the defense made a motion that
the courtroom be cleared 01 all specta.
tors and newsmen. Justice of the Peace
Lincoln granted the motion and newsmen
were barred from the courtroom tor the
remainder of the proceedings.

The five defendants have retained
Des Mollles attorney Dan Johnston as
their counsel, but Le Tourneau, his part-
ner, handled the defense yesterday be<
cause Johnston had a speaking engage<
ment in another state. Johnston is the
Democrat who was defeated by Attorney
General Richard Turner in the last 9130‘
tion.

Asked whether he had produced
enough evidence during the hearing to
insure a conviction, County Attorney
Enich said, “You always hope you have
but you never know." Enich was aid
in yesterday's prosecution by Assistant
Attorney General Douglas Carlson and
Robert Alvine of the Attorney General'l
ofiice,

At the close of the hearing the statd
rested its case and a routine motion by
detense that charges be dropped will
denied. After the hearing Le Tourneau
commented that the purpose of pro<
ceeding with the hearing despite the de-
tense waiver was to provide the prose:
