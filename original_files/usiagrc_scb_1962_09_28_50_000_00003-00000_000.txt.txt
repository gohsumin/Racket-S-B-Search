Study made of typical county

By Sue VVnIltins
5&3 Feature Editor

Nine Giinnell students and
the faculty members partici-
pated this summer-in the second
year of a long—term research
study of Jasper County, iowa.

Thc protect, directed by Paul
A. Smith tpolitical science), ins
volves an economic, historical,
psychological and political sur-
vey or a “typical" county. 1357
per is considered such a county
because of its balance oi urban
and rural communities and its
involvement in both industry
and agriculture.

The basic idea of the sur—
vey, according to Protessor
Smith, is the developmental
study of the changes or a.
community and the iactors
which bring about those
changes.

For this reason the project
must extend over a period of
several years. The purpose is
twofold: t1) To protcssionally
study the way in which a Com»
munity decides its public pol—
icies; and (2) to turnish an
opportunity tor students and face
ully to work together on re
search.
