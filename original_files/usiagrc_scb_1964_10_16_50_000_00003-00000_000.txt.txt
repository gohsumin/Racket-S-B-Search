Oedipus Rex Uses
Traditional Dress,
Greek Palace Set

The title role in Oedipus Rex,
the Greek tragedy which will
be produced in Roberts Thea-
ter November 1244, will be
played by Walter Lowe. Mar-
garet Weathers will play Jocas-
ta, his wife. Other principal
parts will be played by Charles
Burns, Maxwell Helfolt, Ric

‘Macoowell, Dan Mason. Terry

McCoy and Burt McDowell,

”I've felt for a long time that
we should do a Greek tragedy,”
director Mr. Richard Meyer,
Said. “This is the first in a
long Lime at Grinnell, and we’re
deliberately doing it in a some-
_what traditional pattern.”

The play will be done in tra-
ditional Greek costume, and the
set will suggest a Greek palace.
Assistant director is John How-
ard and Karen Hardy is mak—
ing all costumes.

A large chorus, directed by
Mrs. Robert Voertman, will
dance as well as speak. They
will tentatively be accompanied
by a single flute.

More than 70 students tried
out for places in the cast, Mr.
Meyer said, and 95% of the
cast are freshmen and sopho»
mores.

Walter Lowe, who will play
Oedipus, is a freshman from
Chicago, Illinois. At Parker
High School in Chicago he had
the lead in fifteen plays and di-
rected three. Although he has
never played Greek tragedy,
he has seen four portrayals of
Oedipus Rex.

“Oedipus is a man of stark
arrogance, often moved to an-
ger," Lowe said. “He does not
like to he disagreed with I'll
play him as a man who’s al-
ways right, until he finds out
that has completely wrong.
We have a very solid Cast, and
everyone is eager. It should
make for an exciting perform<
Bnce."

Members of the chorus are
Sandra Bates, Andra Beach,
Suzann Bick, Steve Casey, Sue
Chausow, Karen Dahman, Deh-
orah Davis, Barry Dekovic,
David Dillon, and Carlos Dug-
