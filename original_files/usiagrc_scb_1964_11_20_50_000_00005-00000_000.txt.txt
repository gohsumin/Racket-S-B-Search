thsitations Penalty
Explored by C of HP

The penalty range for illegal
visitations was discussed at the
last CotHP meeting Thursday,
November 12.

Because there have been no
recent cases of this type
brought to the student courts
and there are no specific penal-
ties in the handbook, the CofHP
and the courts were faced with
a dilemma recently when two
apprehensions were made by

‘ Coil-1P members.

Upon request of the“ chief
magistrate oi the men's pri-
mary court, the Coil-IF dis-
cussed recommended fines and
suggested a first offense pen<
alty range of $10 to recom-
mended suspension in cases of
illegal visitations.

“We wanted a penalty that
would not make house presi<
dents reluctant to apprehend
people in cases of this type,"
said CofHP President Pete
Read.

He pointed out, that recom-

recommend conduct probation,

however, the cases will be hang

died by the deans,

The men’s and women's pri-
mary courts will meet jointly
this Sunday to try the cases of
illegal visitations. If- the fines
suggested by the COiHP are
upheld, Read will move to have
these penalties be made per-

nent.

European Student Relief,
which began in 1920, became
lmown as World University
Services in 1950. The moral
awareness of university stu<
