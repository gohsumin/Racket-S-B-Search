march based on music from

 

“Ben Hur" and natagraphed by

Barbara I Davis. Another
feature will be a musical pro-
gram by the Tanagers during
intermission. Martha Montgom-
ery and Sandra Kent wrote the

script.

paring for the show in October
and have practiced many hours
since then, including swimming
at 8 a.mr during the interim.
Although this will be the‘flrst
time in a college water show
for some, almost all the mem-
bers have had experience in
synchronized swimming in high
school.

members in c l u d e Barbara
Jeanne Davis, president, Susan
Fritch, vice president, Nancy
Fawcett, secretary - treasurer,

ning, Judy Mattox, Nicky Gerda

for White Caps in the fall.

workshops over the summer.
