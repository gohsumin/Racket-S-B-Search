North Campus Lite May Change;
"Quota" Room Drawing Considered

By Richard Schneirov

Modification of room assign-
ment procedure in the men's
residence hall system, recom-
mended by an ad hoc student-
iaculty committee on problems
in the hall system, was ap-
proved by President Leggett
this month, The change is now
being considered by the Execu-
tive Cabinet and the CoiHP,

The approved proposal calls
for a room drawing system for
male freshmen similar to that
now in use {or women. At the
close oi their first year, fresh-
men would participate in s
North Campus room drawing.

Numerically d e te rm i ned
choices would be limited by
eunsiderations of class balance,
Juniors and sophomores would
continue to choose rooms under
the existing framework

In its report in President
Leggett the ad hoc commits
tee stated, “The proposal pro-
vides for balancing classes
. . .. provides the men with
sophomore and Junior standing
free mobility within the halls,
hroadens opportunities for
close friendships in the first
two years, gives incentive to
p upperclassman-ireshman rela-
_ tionshlps, weakens the incen-
tives behind “prepping," pro-
vides the Dean of Men with
more practical means than he
now has to make changes in

room assignments which may
be necessary for the good at
individuals or halls, and will
have an effect upon the
closed-society aspects of some
of the men’s halls without de-
stroying their traditional in-
tegration and self-governing
independence."

Tentative date {or putting the
proposal into effect is 1968, ac-
cording to present plans. Thus,
the ﬁrst students who would
participate in room drawings
would be next semester’s in-
coming freshmen, The Execu-
tive Cabinet is now discussing
this room selection proposal with
the Deans’ Committee.

Proponents of the new system
admit that certain problems
may arise from it. A major
concern is the conﬂict in some
cases between individual mobil-
ity and class balance.

A conflict in scheduling may
occur because room drawings
take place shortly before the
end of the semester and the
college continues to make its
placement decisions well into
the summer. Another problem
concerns the possibility that u
narrow individual hall charac-
ter might emerge from a sys-
tem that would allow freshmen
to choose for themselves. Final-
ly, a class imbalance might
result from exempting sopho~
mores and juniors from quotasl

dividualism is constricting _ it
reduces others to objects, de-
nying the mutual regard which
is the basis of freedom. We
must restore a viable social
framework for personal expres»
sion.

cur seal-eh for community
leads us to the question of
Griilllell’s institutional integ-
rity, The President, the Deans,
and the members of the FCSA
are all qualified and dedicated
people; we do not question their
motives as individuals. But the
sum total of their collective de-
cisicns appear inconsistent, un-
alierable, and innnical to per»
sonal privacy,

If this interpretation is valid,
we must ask whether there is
hypocrisy within the structure
itself.

As s case in point, last De-
cember‘s suspensions reveal a
major distortion of moral is-
sues. All of us, in our myriad
personal relationships, are con
strained to one pattern of sex~
ual conduct: force makes right.
And the cost of ditference is
ruinous. Suspension does not
mean a simple change of resi-
dence or transfer at credits, but
the abrupt interruption of
friendships. It is exile — ex.
pulsion from home.

This instance is even more
pertinent when one recalls that
the Deans were informed about
the violation in order to assist
an ill student. When counseling
is made u method of rule en-
forcement, trust breaks down
and the genuine problems of
college life remain unresolved
Such irrelevance is demon-
sti-oted in diverse ways. For- ex-
ample; how have present re
strictions on open rooms and
drinking helped to break the
herd mentality on North Cam-
pusi

While the Hobbesian philos-
ophy of Burling Basement is
clearly a negative social iorce,
it also compromises the intellec-
tual pursuits of the liberal arts
college. Indeed, I believe this
aspect demands not only stu-
dent revolt, but faculty revolt.
The censorship of Ionesco’s
The Chairs, ordered through
fear of unfavorable alumni re
action, is the culmination of
many subtler administrative at.
tempts to regulate artistic ex-
pression Tile loss for our thea-
ter hns been evident to nil.

Thus we have seen that the
existing structure provides ar-
liitrary restraints, but fails to
solve corporate stress. Rather,

it intensiﬁes them by alienating
students from a system which
we did not design. The unfor-
tunate consequence is that
many or us live outside all sys‘
talus, dwelling in isolation or
joining the irresponsible aggro
gation of the tribe.

We are ultimately led to sug»
gest some filial problems. Grin-

If their development is

tutional hypocrisy, the soul of
the scholarly fraternity must

these imperatives which have

Steve Kent's progressive admin-

like to propose some broad
ideas for the meaningful reali-
zatiolt of the S,G.A. programs.

The overriding goal of educa-
tion is the achievement of on
integrated life; one where in
tellectuel, social, and sexual
identity may be expressed
through respectful cooperation.
The framework for such n com-
munity must rest in a positive
student tradition, and cannot
be imposed by external authori-
ty. Therefore, we can reverse
the pattern of prolonged ado»
lesceuce only by a radical de-
termination to constructively
regulate ourselves. To imple-
ment this intention, student
government must be granted an

autonomy corresponding to that @——r 7 '

of the faculty. Given n free
hand and a responsible man-
date, capable leadership should
succeed in forming a new con-
sensus; one which will work to
improve the tone of social life.

Numerous practical steps
might be taken. he creation of
alternate men’s and women’s
halls and the practice of com-
mon dining would do much to
alleviate the barracks atmos~
