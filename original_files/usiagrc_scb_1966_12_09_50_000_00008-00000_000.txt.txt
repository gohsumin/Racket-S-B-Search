These are good lads. Mrs.

My association with these

years has convinced me, anew,
that those fears and those
doubts have no real basis.

It is heartening, it is heart»
warming, to live and endure
hardships with them. Their
courage defies description. Their
discipline is a thing or beauty.
Their willingness to sacriiice,
to take punishment yes, to e
dure the unendurabio that oth-
ers may live is awesome and
inspiring.

What we are doing here is
right. It is just. It is honorable.
Communism is on trial here.
Specifically, the basic tenets of

Personal Comment: I have
withheld the temptation to capi.
talize and underline words and
phrases which, to put it bluntly,
should be hammered into the
heads of the dissenters.

Those of us who have an»
dured and survived under Com-
munistic dictatorships are etern-
ally grateiul to those who are
trying to stop the spread oi the
cancer. it is a paradox that the
very young, the second and
third generation Americans,
raised and coddled in a demo»
cracy, are those being the most
vocal and creating a disastrous
disunity tor which their chil-
dren and their children's ch -
dren may have to pay dearly.

Answers Questions
To the Editor:

As a word or explanation
concerning my an..-;mous let-
ter oi two weeks ago, I would
like to answer the im . “perti-
nenl" questions raised by Mist
ea Nute and Thomas.

1. The well-being ot the em
tire campus is in some way
aifectcd by women's hours
regulations.

2. Women's hours are not it
penalty, Est rather a social.
ly convenient regulation, the
advantages of which outweigh
the disadvant s.

a. The “same of us" who are
“incapable of he..dling uri-
limited : :dom" refers to
the entire campus, not just
the men.

4. Graduated men’s hours
would be totally out ot social
context: 1 think that society
ought to preserve what little
still remains or the tradition-
e1 roles of the male and
male in copi g with its social
problems. This does not im—
ply condonement of a double
standard in any legitimate
sense. Furthermore, in an en-
vironnient like Grinnell any
restrictions directly placed on
the campus women will in-
directly aftect campus men
to practically the same orient,

would have been better able to

The events or the last tew
weeks have brought to a focal
point a crisis which has been
building inside us tor quite a
while. What we have to say is
no attempt to speak for all the
Negroes or any other Negro on
the Grinnell campus. Nor is it an
attempt to change anyone's at.
titude.

At this point what bothers us
most is the attitude of white
students who consider them.
selves liberal. We see their LL
heralism as either niisconceived
iiheralisni or h pocricy. The
great majority o the students
here are of a suburban and mid.
dleclass background in which
their contact with blacks is at
most limited. They present the
tact that they have “never had
any trouble with Negroes", as
proot of their liberalism, What
they really mean is that theK
have never had any contact wit
Negroes.

Occasionally one ot them will
have a Negro as a guest in his

Friday. Decemberq, not

hotne. This, too, is allegedly
proof positive oi their total lack
oi preiudice.

We at Grinnell form some
sort or uuasiintellectual elite.
The Negroes are readily “tac-
cepted” by the whites because
they are members of this cliteI
These Negroes are “dlflerent'
trom other Negroes because
they're intelligent and clean.

in the spans of time between
our periods of rapport, we ask
ourselves, “how can we as black
men identity with any of these
whites, while they cannot accept
each and every one'of our black
brothers equally as human
beings.”

Everywhere we look at Grill-
nell we see varying degrees or
racial preiudice in its most sin.
ister form. it is sinister because
no one realizes it, and atter all,
who is going to admit that in
an atmosphere or perpetual in-
tellectual stimulation that any.
thing but racial harmony exists?

As we said earlier, we do not
expect to change anyone's racial
attitude. We have attended ra—
cially integrated e c h o o is
throughout our lives, and this
Eatiem has been consistent. We

ave grown to expect no man
of whites than this racial hypoc-
ricy. what we do wish is that
they would realize their {Elsa
sense of liberalism. Gain
through the motions is no pruu
ot sincere liberalism.

We have been forced to re.
examine our position, the osi-
tion of the Negro in the rin-
nell community. We have come
to recognize our position as one
of implied inferiority which per-
vades every tacet of our daily
