(Continued from Page 2)

Those in the project who had
worked in slum communities be-
fore considered the project val.
uable because it achieved two
results which admittedly sound
unimpressive. First, many
people in the community came
to Billy King and the students
who were in Des Moines most
often for information on Des
Moines agencies and how spe-
ciﬁc problems could be solved.
Secondly, Billy got people to
meet with each other to work
collectively on their problems.

Our overwhelming difiiculty
was finances. The attempt at
Grinnell sponsorship of the proj<
ect was impractical. We faced
a cyclic problem from the ﬁrst.
Without money the project
couldn’t operate, but without
results no one was willing to
give money.

showed a mistrust of the proj-
act. I think the doubt smse
irorn two factors that we didn’t
fully anticipate before the proj-
ect was introduced to the cam-
pus in general. The first is that
Billy King, the community or-
ganizer who lived in Des
Moines, was a slum person him
self, This, while enabling him
to communicate more effective-
ly with the people in the com-
munity, meant he could not
speak to students on the aca-
demic level to which Grinnell
is accustomed Secondly, the
project was so distant that it
had to be controlled by Billy
himself. Obviously, the mistrust
was never overcome.

I think that most people who
worked on the project would
agree that it had the potential
of being valuable as a long
term effort. but the immediate
problems were insurmountable
— Janet Rae Smith

Furthermore, the project@——

turned out to be expensive be-
yond our wildest expectations.
The basic expenses which we
had to meet constantly were
travel to and from Des Moines
once a week if not more often,
paper and printing lor the com-
munity and college both (we
probably printed an average or
500 sheets of paper per week).
and support 0! one person.

Even when we settled on sell.
lng popcorn and were thereby
able to just meet basic exa
penses, our financial difficulties
hampered the project. By that
time the project was well
enough established so that we
could expect rent strikes or per-
haps marches. A leserve fund
of bail money and money to
pay lawyer’s fees would have
been very desirable. During die
iirst rent strike, for example.
the landlord threatened to press
charges against Billy and sev-
eral students. Had he carried
out his threat or had other
threats been made, it would
have been impractical to con.
tinue the project with the lim-
ited finances on which it was
forced to operate
