Cam Defines
'House Rules'

Grinnell college now has
new form of student govern—
ment. Yet the implementation of
1116 new constitution presents
many challenges. The Student
Senate possesses all the legisla—
tive power. i believe that in
some narrowly-defined
this responsibility could be delc»
gated to other bodies,

~ One possible area would be
the formulation of "house i-ul

south campus. 1 would i‘equest‘

i ii student government is to be
successiul, it requires a set of
pre-etablrshcd goals and a plan
jto iollow toward those goals
This sense of direction, nccessai
lily, must be the result of a sen-
‘itivily of the student body to the
‘pl'oblems and their attempt to
act positively upon them.

The student body president
must be an initiator. Tire
very nature oi the e.\ - '
oiticc demands rcspun brlrty
and creativity. The pr sidcrit
l cannot wait for others; he must
- be the main force for action.

A chronic problem on this came
pus is the void which exists be.

that the out-going CofHP and
AWS board define, as part of
their annual report, what each
body considered to be its "house
rules."

The Executive Board, after
careiul review, could then me
quest that the Student Senate
delegate to the new CofHP and
AWS board the responsibility
'for the formulation of these
dormitory rules. As the Student
Senate would maintain its ulti—
mate authority in this or a, it
could rescind this delegation of
responsibility at any time.

In such areas as the hall
orientation program for the
freshmen the fundamentally
diiicrent resident dormitory
systems precludes any com-
mon experience. it is this kind
of legislative issue which
could most expeditiously be
handled by the Coin? and
laws board.

Such a delegation would free
the Student Senate for fuller
consideration of more allvcamv
pus issues On new area now
under its jurisdiction is the mak
ing of social policy. Previously
the Social Caleniar committee
had made recommendation to the
president on such matters as
open dormitori and open
lounges. I feel this is an area
which could be very profitably
explored by the Student Senate.

The implementation of the
new judicial system would logi-
cally begin, 1 would think, with
a thoroiigh survey of the past
adjudicating process.

Such an examination would
entail a definition oi the dor-
mitory rules, how they have
been enforced and the kinds
of punishments exacted. This
would form a solid base of
precedent upon which the high
court and primary court could
act.

There are other areas into
which the Grinnell college Stu—
dent Government Association
could lorge. it could make a
continuing effort to better
“town—gown" relations estab-
lishing a student 52 icc bur»
eau. it could help to attract the
top quality stud nt Grinncll
needs by sponsoring a special
prospective students weekend.

functions of student government
can be to promote closer com-
munication between the faculty—
administration and the student
body, 1 have made, in my plat-
torm, four suggestions along this
line

First, the studentviacully i‘elar
tions committee of the Student
Senate should be rejuvenated and
faculty members added. Student
members could communicate tn»
:ulty views to the Senate, and
faculty members would report to
faculty meetings and iniormally

'to their colleagues.

Second. there are faculty com
mittces which wrll not permit,
ior many reasons, student mem-
bership, Where problems warrant
it, l propose student committees,
lparallel to the faculty groups.
’These student committees would
work closely with the faculty
.committees and make recom-
mendations to the student senate.

Third, I would categorical.
ly support another cncilmp»
mcnt with the specific view of
using the reports of the prev
vious gathering to stimulate
constructive proposals by the
encampment committees to the
Senate.

I Finally, 1 would attempt to uti-

lize the halls for informal discus—
sions between faculty and stu—
dents.

I am in favor oi joining the

Student opinion can and
should present the objective, disa

prevalent inside the academic

be an effective force on campus
by incorporating it into the Na-

tional Aiiail‘s committee. l

‘ News about important events
such as the Soutl‘el’n siHns is
provided by NSA'S national of-
ﬁne throughout the year. This
‘mformation could be funneled to
Gi'inncll‘s political clubs, This
would mean that many more peo-

Finally, this opinion could be
vexpressed through a national or.
ganization. if opinion is to re-
suit in action, students must act
in combination; NSA provides
such an opportunity.

But we must take first things
first. if joining NSA would rev
suit in a reduction of allotments

until it is financially feasible.
