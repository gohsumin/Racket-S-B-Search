against Mr. Nasser, amongst
your “Letters to the Editor,"

continued intraiaculty immunity
from personal attack.
Presumably prompted by Mr,

Mr. Crossett’s letter, neverthe»

specific criticism of that article’s

when that ieckiess body voted

content and instead got right
down to slander. Not satisfied
with Mr. Nasser’s seli assess-
ment as a “socialist” (a term
which in use more loosely defines
one as in sympathy with and not
necessarily an unthinking
adherent to the doctryesitsj) o§
socialism). Mr. Crossett, in Me-
Carthyesque style, and possibly
libelously, labeled Mr. Nasser a
“communist." (he may be for-
tunate that his letter placed
quotes around the word, and one
might guess that they indicate
his own real understanding of the
looseness with which the term
can be used, e.g., the Banana
Republic style of labeling anyone
who disagrees with die existing
dictatorship as a “communist”).
Having set up the straw man of
what he assumes to be Mr.
Nasser's political beliefs, he then
lurched into his rarified and
somewhat irrelevant discourse
on sists and nisms from which he
miraculously concludes Mr.

might think from his words that
only by believing in nothing can
one satisfy the stringent limita-
tions Mr. Crosset places on ﬁt—
ness to teach at a liberal arts
college. But, I would never go
so far as to accuse anyone ul such
detached neutrality. Rather, I
am forced to suspect that Mr.
Crossett is to be found in the
opposites of what he ascribes to
Mr. Nasser, and might Well be
described as an anticommunist,
necrfascist, counter-revolution-
ary national chauvinist.

All of this, however, may have
but slight bearing on his capacity
to teach Classical Languages,
and I would certainly refrain
irom any such conclusion until

on his capacities as a teacher of
his discipline. In short, I would
hope that we can, in the future,
return to the paths of rational
discourse and withstand the
temptation to snipe at one an
othcr's characters.

Your Vice, it seems, was
to trust Mr. Nissen’s old
colleagues and cunlrcrcs. He
seems more upset at you for
interpreting the quotation than he
is at Mr, Wilhelm and Miss
Neuman tor irauduiently attrib-
uting the words to him. That Miss
Neuman has practiced such
immoral journalistic practice'i‘s
well attested by the confession
which she made in the 5&8 when
she was editor. One is not sur-
prised, in View it the loose»

Well, you should have checked
the veracity oi the quotation, as
your handsome apology to Mr.
Nissan admits. But this error can
scarcely be held to outweigh the
positive values of your editor-
ship. To list just three: (1) your
choice of John Pepper as sports

rather than conforming to some institution's ideas."
Rev. Dr. Fox adds. "ll you are coming to Fort Lauder-

Your mistakes have been the
natural consequence of Grinnell’s

system, there is almost a com-
