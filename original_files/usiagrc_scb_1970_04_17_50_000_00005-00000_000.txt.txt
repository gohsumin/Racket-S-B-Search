SCARLET AND BLACK

The Hisl'ory of Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman a+ Grinnell College

Part Three

The litestyle that Henry and
Krys pursue is certainly quite
dlflel'enl from that of most
people, it is perhaps the primary
thing which distinguishes them
trom the rest of society and
makes them, in the town of
Grinnell at least, stand out The
5815 asked Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman Just how they
would characterize the way they
live.

First, they emphasized that
mammgm acquisition oi wealth
was not a value to them, as they
tclt ii is to much ol society, They
are not really interested in ace
cumulating a great number of
material posessions, intact, they
have already gotten rid oi or sold
many of the “middle class
clothes” that they had in college,

Second, they said that they do
nol believe in the institution oi
marriage, “especially as the
woman is seen as an extension
of her husband and not in her
own right." perhaps, they teel,
it is too exclusive, and the two
people begin to depend on each
other too much tor their basic
needs.

Work is not as important to
Henry and Krys as it is to most
people in society: neither of them
has a “straight“ job, and they
are content with a relatively low
standard of living. “We won't
give up our ideals to earn a lot
of money,“ Wilhelm said,

They mention that they do not
have any children, and that they
do not plan to have any. One
reason, Krystyna Neuman said.
is that She doesn't feel tllat she
has a “good enough biological
makeup to pass on lo another
generaiion" tshe has diabetes),
Another is tllat they [eel that not
everyone has to have children.
and possibly there is too much
oxctusiveness m a iamily.

"We totally reject mysticism,
religion, or any irrational
lhoughl," Wilhelm mentioned,
and he later added philosophy to
this list.

Conccrning drugs. they said
that they thought that marijuana
was probably sater than alcohol;
however, they don’t use any
drugsat home because ”tile legal
risks are loo great " It is in-
teresting that ole taculty

member told the scan that many
people in the iaeulty have in the
past identitied the Easl street
Gallery with all the drug trailic

said lhat he never had any in.
dtcation that there were drugs
in the Gallery

An important part of their lite
style, Henry and Krys said, is
recreation, which to them is
"doing something creative,”
They are only interested in
recreation which is “participant
typc"ratherthanpassive

As it to complete their
characterization of their life
style, Krystyna Neuman said,
“Scx7Welikesex,”

They both emphasized, though,
that although these are their
attitudes now, they may change.
According to Krystyna Neuman,
“this is the way we live now, but
we’re not convinced it is the
ultimate way We’d like to ex-
perimentandlindotherways.”

ln tact, they are actively
planning on establishing a
commune which will emphasize
this experimentation with dif—
ierent ways of living. They hope
to find an alternative life style
within a commune oi the type
patterned alter that outlined in
the book Walden Two by B.‘ F.
Skinner. They would like to form
a commune which would be
organized to a greater extent
than most, and they are willing
to experiment to find the best
way to organize it, in tact, the

main feature of their commune
will be its emphasis on ex-
perimentation, They will try to
work towards a system which
will Value all humans alike no
matter what their skills, alld one
which would be adaptable to
large groups at people.

They have already sent out
some applications, and feel that
it they can attract many young
people to join them, later maybe
some will leave and start their
communes. ln/iact, they think ot
iheir commune, with it's “ex-
perimental attitudeitowards
change" and where the “normal
mode or doing things will be
experimental" as a model for
other people,

They think it Will be
distinguished trom many oi thc
communes that are being
established today by its attitude
towards technology Although
they tool that there has been a
misapplication oi technology in
present day society, ”where the
sole goal at technology is to
create material abundance with
only a small attention on human
welfare," they hope to put it to
good use in their own commune.

When their commune is
established, it will use the
manufacture oi the photographic
print alld Iilm washers that
Wilhelm designed as its economic
base These washers, which are
patented by East Street Gallery,
were designed tor protessimials

the grounds crew.

When a job opens up it has
been the policy to let present
Boo employees apply tor the
job. Qualified men have olten
been iound from among these
employees. For example, the
three people in the paint shop
and the Storekeeper came from
the custodial force, and the
second electrician and a car»
penter were hired from the
grounds crew. The College has
hired people from outside,*in
order to get skills they couldn’t
get from among the present
force, but Hawn indicated that
a qualified present employee is
given first preference.

Many other complaints were
stated by the workers inter-
viewed. Hawn was said to feel
that he never makes a mistake.
to be unable to work with
people, to act in a way that
puts him above his employees,
so that they cannot talk to him.
The general feeling was that
l-lawn appeared to have no re
spec: for B&G employees.

Mr. Donald Lambie, College
Treasurer, disagreed. Accord-
ing to Lambie, Mr. Hawn tries
to relate on the judgment of
employees more than his prede-
cessor. “Under Mr. Walden,
employees were to do nothing
without a written work order,
but Mr. Hawn insisted from the
beginning that employees be
allowed to use their own judg-
ment in man matters.” The

old procedure. which made use
of work orders, is a very com—
mon procedure in American
colleges.

Regardless of this there is a
sincere distrust at Mr. llawn
among the lzxc employees who
were interviewed. llawn is
known to be blunt, and occa-
sionally, perhaps, he is not stil-
ttCiently Senslliye to the leele
ings pi those [U whom he is
talking. “l'll b0 the first one
to admit that I lack tact, but
the record shows that while i
have been here there have
been no things, the work at em-
ployees has been or good qual-
ity, the wages of employees
has increased, and the Physi-
cal Plant and its employees
ill’e more respected in the Col-
lege community than they were
helorc."

llawn also added that lit
would “navel reprimand a man
loi- making a mistake if he is
working. I believe that any
tindesmnii, espeCially With the
complex trades today, is going
to make errors in the course oi
ll normal day. Alter all, a man
who does no work makes no
errors."

interestingly enough, Hawn
had attempted to set tip a
channel through which he could
learn oi grievances among,
B&G employees. Hawii's pro»
ccdurc was, lrom time to time,
to call the working ioremeii
into the oilice to discuss areas
of concern to the employees.
