Pioneers lose to Beloi'tv,VC

By Pete Kollman

Grinnell’s basketball team
dropped two games on the road
last weekend, losing to Beloit
Friday night, 90—61, and to Coe
on Saturday, 9130. The losses
dropped the Pioneers to fifth
place in the Midwest Confer-
ence standings.

Friday night Grinnell trav-
eled to Beloit to take on the
Buccaneers. The less said
about the game the better; the
Pioneers played one of their
worst games of the year. Grin-
nell fell behind at the begin-
ning and the margin steadily
increased, reaching 15 at half-
time, 39724. Beloit continued
where they left off when the
second half started and contin-
ued to roll up the score.

Bright spots in the Grin-
,nell effort were , ell-captains
Jim Mifflin and John Sundell.
Mifflin hit 8 for 13 from the
field enronte w 25 points and
Sundell showed he had recov-
ered from the illness which
hampered him last weekend
by snagging 21 rebounds.

Saturday night was a happier
story, although the result
looked the same in the stand-
ings. Grinnell jumped off to an
early lead, but the Kohawks
came right back to tie the game
at halftime, 47417.

The Pioneers recovered from
meir Friday night deep freeze
by shooting 50 percent the first
half. The entire second half
was a see-saw battle, somewhat
like the St. Olaf game 2 Weeks
earlier. The Pioneers lead by
four with three and a half min-
utes to play but the Kohawks
regained the advantage and a
lest-second basket by Sundell
was of no avail.

Jeff F r s n t z, sophomore
guard, along with senior co»
captains, turned in noteworthy
performances. Frantz lead the
Pioneers with 27 points. closely
followed by Mifflln’s 26.

Co-Capluins Sundell. Mifflin
Eye Musser's School Records

Grinnell’s basketball co-Cap-
tains, Jim leflin and John
Sundell, are quickly closing in
on one season and two career
marks held by Pioneer John
Musser (’56), older brother of
Bob Musser ('62).
In the scoring department,
Mifflin, a forward who is cer-
tain to join the “LOW-point
club” in Iowa this weekend,
could, by maintaining his’ cur-
rent 21.2 point, average, slip
post Musser in career scor-
ing.
with five games left, Mifflin
has come up with 329 points this
season, giving°him a three-year
total of 994. This leaves him
just 10!) markers shy of Mus-
ser's pacersetting 1103 points.

Grinnell’s Pioneers return
home this weekend to try and
break out of the slump that has
cost the Scarlets six of their
last seven games. Tonight at
7:30 p.m. the cagers meet the
Lawrence Vikings in Darby
Gymnasium and tomorrow air
ternoon at 1:30 p.m. face
league-leading Ripon.

Coach John Pfitsch's main
problem is still the question
of finding someone to back
up his 1-2 punch of Jim Miff-
lin and Jeff Frantz. Since the
departure of sophomore
guard Gordy Kinkead at sem-
esters, Plitsch has been un-
able to find a third Pioneer
who can consistently hit in
double figures.

Last week Mifflin scored 51_
points to boost his average to
21.2, among the leaders in the
Midwest Conference. Frantz
rebounded from an offrnight at
Beloit to pour in 27 points
against Coe and keep his aver.
age right around the 17 point
mark. But aparrirom these two.
no other Pioneers can be found5
among the top is scorers.

However, John Sundell, chiefr
ly known for his rebounding,
had one of his best offensive
nights of the year in the 91.90‘
loss to the Kohawks with 19
points. Rounding out the lineup
tonight will probably be Clyde
Smith and Dave Sellergren, al-
though Randy Morgan, Dick Ul»
rich and Ted Risser are all
slated for action.

Tonight's opponent, Law.
rence, is currently in sixth
place in the conference, one
slot'behind Grinnell. The Vik-
ings played only one game last
Week and looked good although
dropping a rather one-sided
game to neighboring Ripon.

The big gun for the Blue and
White this year is Joel Ungrodt,
a 5'9" sharp shootibgguardl
with a 21 point average. Un-
grodt finished in the top five in

Pogo hurl

oe; Drop to Fifth,

last year’s scoring race and
is a good bet to do so again this
year. L i k e Grinnell, Lawn
rence’s big problem is finding
someone to batik up Ungrodt.

The Redmen of Ripon seem
headed for a second consecu-
tive basketball crown. Cur-
rently sporting a 13-1 record,
the Wisconsin crew has a two
game margin over second
place Cornell.

Ripon boasts three players
among the top ten scorers.
Gary Mevis is the top point~
maker with close to 22 points
a game. Jack Ankerson, of
gridiron renown. has a 19
point average, and Jim Cahoon
a 17 point average. Also fre-
quently hitting in double ﬁg-
ures is another Ankerson, Doug.
