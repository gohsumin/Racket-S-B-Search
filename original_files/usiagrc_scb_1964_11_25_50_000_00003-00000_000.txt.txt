He went on to clarify the pur-
use of the FCSA, listing them as
allows: “1) to advise the President
.t policies, procedures, rules, and
-nalltles In the area of student
onduct and discipline; 2) to par-
' ipate in the process of changing
lasic rules and penalties in the
tea of student conduct and disci-
line; 3) to consider and decide
ases within its purview and, under
ppropriate conditions, to review
ts decisions. In its function of ad-
udiCiatlng Cases, the Committee

lon of the Faculty (approved by

l ittee with list of duties.)

Dean of Women Jean M. Slocum
enled that there was any attempt
n the part of the FCSA to usurp
tudent government power. “The
ddition of the committee Is a re-
urce to handle sticky problems
at are overburdening the stu-
ents,” she said on Monday. “It is
reated to help the college solve
e problems. I would hate to have
tudents look at it as only one
hing —— a substitute for student
oveniment. It is not Created to
e a student court."

On request of the 5&3, Associate
Dean Walker made a statement of
is own opinions on certain mat-
ers, emphasizing that it did not
ecessarily reflect the belief of the
CSA. His statement followsl

“I feel that some students may

also feel that monetary lines do
not serve as a good deterrent

tion is participation in the worst

As a new week dawned on cam
pus, the various meetings con-
tinued, among them a meeting of
the FCSA to determine new de-
velopments in the South Younlrer
case. (members of the hall are ap-
pealing the penalty as such, asking
that only the guilty be punished,
rather than each member of the
hall.) The Committee has been ap-
proached by the 5&3 with a series
of questions concerning its develop
ment and mechanics, but with the
early press date this week and the
heavy schedule of business for the
committee the story will be held
until a future date. Members of
the committee, headed by J nhn
Burma (sociology) have been

‘ amenable to the 5&3 and express

complete cooperation in efforts to
answer questions that will make
their actions Clearer to the stu-
dent body.

The final outcome of the weekend
talks was an apparent split among
SGA officials. At a joint AWS-
CoIHP meeting, the interpreta-
tions of Johnson and Parkison of
their talks with administration of-
ficials was challenged by other Ex-
ecutive Cabinet members and by
various hall presidents.

Johnson and Parkison, however,
continued to express "confusion
and apprehension" as to the posi-
tion of student government under
what they assume as a new policy
among administration members.
On Tuesday morning they released

I have received numerous comments, both pro and con,
on my article of two weeks ago. As a result, I wish to explors
more thoroughl the two major areas of concern: “recruiting
of athletes to érinnell and the "jock image” at Grinnell. I
attempt this hoping to put the problems in their proper pelt
s ective, and also hoping to make my gersonal feelings more
c ear. Realizing this to be too much to andle in one swallow,
I will deal only with the “recruiting” aspect this week, and
save the “image” aspect until next week.

Grinnell competes athletically In the Midwest Conferenc

(for you intellectuals who have turned to the wrong pagel
which, academically speaking, is one of the finest athletic cone
ferences in the country. There are no athletic scholarshi I
and no active recruiting is allowed. By “active recruiting’ i
mean that no school may contact a prospective student-athlete
until that school first hears from the boy. This set of standards
has given the conference an integration of academics and ath-
letics, and a level of competition which is envied by most, It
not all, other conferences in the country.

The above tact alone places Grlnnell among a select
group in the college recruiting circle. In addition to this,
we are one of the top schools academically in the conference,
Because of this, we are considered to be one of the “leaders‘
in the conference; we are, without sounding trite I hope. to
set an example. One, If not the most important, way of doing
this is by coming as close to the “ideal” set up by the con-
ference rules and the bulletin as we can.

The above Information was assumed, apparently erron-
eously, to be common knowledge in my first article. In‘ that
article I was merely suggesting that perhaps we, as an insti-
tution, could more closely meet these standards in away
which would enhance our academic standing with Impairlng
our athletic performance.

In short, has one student been admitted to Grinnell who,
except for his athletic abilities, would not have been? Is there
one student who is being given more money on scholarship
than he merits academically? Are athletics weighed more
heavily than other activities on an application? Any attempt
at answering these questions mils into much controversy;
but if they can be answered in the affirmative, and I think
many students believe they can, then it seems to me that
perhaps this is an area in which Grinnell can improve herself
as a liberal arts institution.
