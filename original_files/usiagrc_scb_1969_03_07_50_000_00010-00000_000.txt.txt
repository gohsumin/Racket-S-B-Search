By KATHY BULL

State legislators are getting
paranoic about student unrest.
All across the country hills are
being introduced to limit state
rundiug or schools. student
echolzrships and lreedom oi
Upeech.

The cycle is welideﬁned. Stu-
dent! demand their rights. leg-
islators pass repressive laws,
eniorcing the students' reasons
tor rebelling, which in turn rein-
forces what the legislators sea
as need tor more control logic-

Legislators in lawn have ex.
pressed much concern during

the past month about demon-
strations. nudity and “dirty
words" on campuses in the
state. Many hours or debate in
bath the Senate and the House
have been spent criticizing the
actions oi rebellious students.

The Chairman oi the House
Law Enlorcement Committee,
Rep. Alfred Nielson (it-Shelby).
appointed a special subcommit-
tee last month “to correct the
dirty word and left-wing situa-
tion” at the University of lowa.

Iowl Legnlation

Senator Richard Stephens (Re
Washington) last month intrl)<
duced a bill (Senate File 143) in
the Iowa Senate that calls for
the summary dismissal of any
rtudent or iaculty member who
participates in a campus strike
or disturbance. Several legisla<
tors and the Iowa Board of Re-
gents are opposing the bill be-
cause s u m m a r y dismissal
denies due process oi law and
is therefore unconstitutional.
One or the Regmts attended
many legislators by calling the
bill “fascist.”

Last Monday Governor Robert
Ray signed into eitect a law
that arms campus policemen
on the campuses or the state
universities by conierring upon
them the authority or “peace
ollicer." The bill was passed by
the lawn legislature last month
after lobbyists tor the Board 0!
Regents strongly urged its pas-
sager

Gov. Ray said on Tuesday
that he Signed the hill only after
Regents assured him that cam-
pus policc would not be armed
during student demonstrations.
Ray has been reticent about
criticizing legislators tor deal-
ing with the subject of Student
protest. but he has stated that
lawmakers Should not interfere
with Ihe academic freedom of
universities.

Bowen Speaks Out

Several of lowa's university
presidents are delending their
schools liom attacks by legisla-
torss President Howard Bowen
at the University of lowa. who
recently announced his resigna-
tion, has voiced Special concern.

“It is inevitable and desirable
that the campuses should be-
come the center of debate. dis-
cussion and action on these mat-
ters. It is utterly irrational to
rear universities or penalize
them because ideas are dis-
cussed there . or because a
true Concern exists there for
peace and brotherhood. Colleges
and universities must be tree
{mm political control and free
in speech and thought," Bowen
said.

The student senate at the Uni-
versity ol Northern lowa launch
ed a campaign several weeks
ago encouraging students to
communicate their views on
various hills to legislators

through the proper channels.
More than one third at the stu-
dent body signed petitions which
were presented to lawmakers.
hundreds sent letters to their
representatives, and many trav-
eled It) the Statehouse to speak
personally to lawmakers.

Several legislators criticized
the U.NJ. students tor clogging
the mails with form letters.
Others accused university Presi-
dent J. W, Maucker oi insti-
gating the campaign by stu-
dents in order to get more runds
for the university, Both Mauker
and student leaders have denied
such accusations.

Court Upholds Protest

Last week's Supreme Court
decision on the Des Moines arm-
band case may have wide-rang-
ing impact on the growing
struggle h e t w e e n lawmakers
and those who defend academic
treedom, The Court, by a 772'
decision, held that a student's
constitutional right or tree
speech permits him to conduct
orderly forms at symbolic pro—
test so long as he does not in.
ter-rupt school activities or in-
fringe upon the rights or others.

The Court upheld the right

who were suspended by school
officials in 1965 when they re-
fused to remove black arm»
bands they had worn to school
to protest the Vietnam war.
Four Oi the defendants are
brothers and sisters of Grinnell
senior Bonnie Tinker.

Justice l-lugo black, dissenting
strongly. stated that the minds
of students Should not be divert-
ed from their studies. particu-
larly not to think about the
"highly emotional subject of the
War in Vietnam." He defended
the authority Of School officials
to limit free speech in order to
maintain school discipline.

Justice Black expressed tear
that the majority opinion was
unleashing powers that will
eventually result in students'
clamoring tor control or the
schools. Black's disnent Came
as a surprise to many Court obs
servers who have considered
him to be the most libertarian
of the nine Justices.

The Court's decision seems to
assert that communication is a
vital part oi the educational
process, and that educational
institutions Cannot deprive stu-
dents at their constitutional
rights. The decision provides
encouragement to those who
maintain that education should

other Hills Introduced

In Wisconsin 11 bills hav-
been introduced to the state he
scmbly that would give much or
the universities' power to tho
state, permitting the state to
deal directly with student pro»
testors. Meanwhile, the Madi-
son campus cooled on as black
students persuaded white radi-
cals to return to class and not
risk lurther confrontations with
the police and National Guards~
men.

More than a dozen bills have
been introduced in the lllinois
legislature as a result of cam.
pus disturbances. Sen. Karl
Berning has asked for $25,000
to create a university disorders
investigative committee. and
has also introduced 8 bill pro—
viding tor expulsion of students
lrorn state-supported institutions
{or vandalism, rioting, and other
unlawlul acts against the in-
stitutlons.

Sen. John Lanigan sponsored
three bills designed to “zero in
on radical or other Subversive
elements now using college cam.
puses to toment revolution."
One or Lanigan's bills would ina
crease the maximum penalty
for anyone who advocates vio
lent overthrow oi the govern—
ment on university property
from 10 to 20 years.

Another bill calls for imme<
diate revocation of scholarshin
lunds for anyone who particl-
pates in an unlawful disturb-
ance against a university's ad-
ministmtion. A third Lanigan
bill would fix a $5,000 line or 5
years in pnscn or both tor any-
one who damages property at a
state institution.

The University or Chicago’s
Council oi the University Sen<
ate. which comprises 50 faculty
members. called for expulsion
of unruly students and the use
of police to curb disturbances
on campus. During the is days
Students occupied the Adminis»
tration Building last month, the
administration had maintained
a hands-oft policy.

Nixon — ‘Get Tough’

President Nixon deprecated
student rioters and demonstr’l-
tors and supported a get to
policy last week in his first
Statement on campus disturb-
ances. He commended Father
Hesburgh ol Notre Dame Uni-
versity tor announcing that he
would not hesitate to call in
police to deal with any students
who demonstrate violently or
nonviolently.

State govemors, meeting in
Washington last week, agreed
with Nixon's get tough policy,
saying that “Lawless acts by
a small segment at the student
population must not be allowed
to interlere with the vast num-
ber ot students who are seeking
to exercise their educational
opportunin‘ s."

Reacting similarly, President
5, I. Hayakawu or San Francis-
co state College, is now prour
ising a purge of dissident tac-

ulty and students. Criminal
charges are being brought
against student protest leaders,
