Kunlz Nol'es Worl'h of Public Leclures.
Thinks Facull‘y Series Would Be Exciling

To the Editor:

What’s the use of important pub-
lic lectures scheduled in contliet
with classes? Elaine Cook’s letter
oi Nov. 19 is a just complaint,

There’s no time as titting ior a
public event as 11 a m. The i um.
puhlic event cuts into an evening's
supper and sleep. A lecture from

11 to noon is not likely to upset
anyone's plans.

There are a dozen sets oi hours
in which to have routine classes.
The stimulus ot ublic lectures
merits some hours ree irom class-
es. '

My assumptions are these:

“It Be Broad

 

(my definition or a university
or college) has common intcr.
csts. Ii these are ignored, one
has only an aggregation oi ins
dividuals.

2. The common interests rc-
quine each senior scholar (pro-
fessor) to make known his re-
search and conclusions and to
know the work of his col-
leagues.

3. The junior scholar (stu-
dent) deserves to know how
the contribution of each de~
partmcnt relates to that or
every other department,

4. 1f the taculty expects stu-
dents to nelate work done in
diiierent areas, but does not
do so themselves. they are
worse than hypocrites; they
are tailing to participate in the
exciting task of interpreting
the rclationship oi specialized
knowledge to man’s view of
himself and his world.

The President or Dean call dis
cuss‘ the “style of life" of the
community in a public assemhly.
Or, better, they can influence the
students' mode of life and thought
with interesting topics of debate.
The Administration deserves occa
Slons more frequent than the 0p»
ening oi the school year and Coni-
mellcement.

The division of fine arts has in-
terpreted its activities to the whole
community through the line arts
lectures. Thcsc lectures should he
so scheduled that all members of
the community might attend. I’ve
been to about to meetings, and as
I think hack over performances oi
the Lenox Quartet, Orchesis, etc,
and lectures by my colléagues, i
realize that this is an opportunity
for which I am deeply grateful. As
tor leading visiting'aestlleticlans.
i find few universities that have
had Rudolf Arnheim, Monroe
Beardsley. Lester Longman, Leon-
ard E. Meyer, and Paul Weiss dur-
ing the past four years.

I could say something similar a!
the Roseniield Lectures and the
Gates Lectures, but what this col-
lege is not now doing that it used
to do and should he doing is to get
its own faculty into dialogue with
each other.

The other day 5 sophomore

I spoke to me about Professor Wall's

statement, “modern man faces
chaos.” when 11:00 was tree for
public lectures I had heard Mr,
Wall's great lecture on “History
and Reality." The sophqmore has
my Thermotax copy, which seems
to he the only one remaining. It
was a great series on “Reality
with the departments oi psycho
lngy. chemistry, literature, history,
and philosophy represented. Facul-
ty members were exposed to each
other's questions. Students could
see thereby the strengths and
weaknesses of thc dilierent ap-
proaches. ‘

I should like to see tlus sort of
intellectual excitement at Grinnell
again. If there were the occasion oi
a taculty series, what fun it would
lie to hear James Kissalle and Say
mour Katz on myth. Mr. Kissanc
has published on “Vlcloﬂall My-
thology;" Mr. Katz has lectured on
Suzanne Langer's theory. I should
like to know what a classicist like
ilr. Crossett has to say. and to
hear an anthropologist like Mr.
Kurtz. Of course. I'd like to try
out some ideas of my own.

Sorry to he dreaming. There

‘goes the bell. I’ve got to gel. to

Elaine Cook is right.
