Role of 5&3 Questioned

By John Wull‘
8&3 Ass’t News Editor

The question of whether the
Scarlet and Black has the right
to be a manipulator oi campus
opinion was the main topic oi
a coftee hour sponsored by Sig-
ma Delta Chi last Monday in
Younker lounge

According to Vice President
Merritt Ludwig, any college
newspaper should have the ac—
curate reporting of facts as its
main purpose.

Present S&B editor Jim Here
20: took the view that the par
per can act as a crusader
through its editorials.

Herzog’s views were argued
by Steve Howell, CDI'HP pre v
dent. Howell lclt that editol‘rl
support ot certain issues was
uniair because the 5&3 has a
monopoly in this form of Conl-
munieation.

Hel'zog returned that the
S&B gives eoual news coverage
to each side of campus issues
and that after luliilling this
responsibility, the paper has the
right to follow any editorial
policy it chooses

Howell also claimed that the

1 Larry Sniuchcr, former 3&8

managing editor. claimed that
the problem didn't rest willi the
paper but with the student gov-
ernment, which, he charged,
seems to have no idea or pubs
llcity.

On another subject, Ludwig
pointed out that the paper also
owes responsible reporting to,
tillumni and other non-students.
“The paper isn‘t obligated to be‘
a public relations instrument;
lbut since it goes of: campus,
the paper docs have l'esponsivl
.bilities lo these people,” Ludwigl
jdeclared. l

Lights flick on revealing a stage ready -tor
action ,music booms. The costumed actors move
and weave their predicted pattern on the stage.
They speak zmd react,

”Louder,” cuts in a voice from the center
section of seats. “Take it from the top again.”

The Grinnell production oi 1.3. is taking
shape.

Rehearsals have been going on for four weeks
now, the iirst three having rehearsals tour nights
a week, and this week rehearsals every night.
At the beginning of the rehearsal schedules the
actors appear in school clothes to deliver halt
ingly their new lines, The blocking or arrange

‘ ment and movement of actor is Worked out under

the supervision of Richard Meyer (drama), and
the development ot charactc zation is begun.

“We discuss the way various scenes should be
played and experiment with many. many ap-
pruachcs. Even now we are still working on the
interpretations at some scenes." commended
Meyer,

"You know there have been two versions of
ll}. presented Yale was the first to (live this
play, its interpretation was that of‘ an intellect
ual debate between the devil and God. The sets
were realistic and the devil and God moved
freely about the stage. The Broadway version,
directed by Elia Kazen, was more emotional in
impact. The Devil and God remained lair sta-
tiallaly against a nonreullstic set. Our ve ion
is a compromise between the two, We see it as a
three way struggle between God, Satan and LB.
We will not try to approximate reality 7 our set
is concerned with providing interesting shapes

and acting areas as much as with suggesting
place or time."

After it while lighting and sets, costumes and
props are added. Scenes. then whole acts are
given Without pauses for instruction. Notes taken
by Meyer are discussed ill the close of the itcl,
and general instructions are delivered. '

“Thinking of What comes next is vital." ad—
monishes Meyer after a run-through of the first
act. “Prepare the audience by followmg a logical
order, Think, move, then Speak, that's the order
OI acllng.”

Technical problems must be worked out dur—
ing rehearsals The music, which is a tape of the
music composed (or and used in the Broadway
production, must be fitted in, the volume regu—
lated. There are Iltile problems such as h0w_‘m
keep newspapers used in one scene trom rattling
and there are technical Stumpel‘s Such as how
to give the impression of an A-boinb explosion.
This latter problem was solved by the use OI
lighting and wind sound ctlects,

interruptions such as the need of the stage in
the early evening by other organizations must be
borne. “We have to have the patience ot lob."
ouipped one cast member as he wanted to go on
again after one such interruption.

But these rehearsals are only a preparation
tor the crucial time when the theater is lull and
the real pertormance begins,

Meyer said, “We hope that students will e .
periencc the play itself rather than sitting ea
1y analyzing the themes or their Junior Liberal
Arts Exam. Comedy calls for this type at deter-tn,
ment, but tragedy needs emotional involvement
Students should be caught up in the spectacle ot
the play and then analyze in retrospect.”
