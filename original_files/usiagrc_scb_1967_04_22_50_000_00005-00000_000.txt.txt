Paul Goodman attacks ‘Greai Sociely'

By nanlr Ballkov

Labeling himseli a populist and cone
munity anarchist, social critic Paul
Goodman told I Grinneil audience, via
tekphonic airways Wednesday after-
noon, it is somewhat arrogant to term
any society “Great" that would ulti-
mately have to pension off over half
its members to achieve this adjective.

Goodman is a playwright, novelist,
unofficial philosopher lot the free
speech movement, and the author or
Communlttis.

Goodman pointed out that his brand of
community anarchism does not deny that
man is communal, but does see many or
his present institutions as often alienating
him from himself. His ideal community
is one or unity oi purpose and effect,
where “a premium is placed on techni-
cal improvement. . .where workers are
technically educated and have a say
in management. Where no one drops
out of society and there is mobility be-
tween classes. Where the community is
planned as a whole with an organic
integration or work, living and play.
Where production is primarily for use. .
Where people are not afraid to make
friends. Where sexuality is taken tor
granted and where education is con—
cerned with fostering human powers as
they develop in the growing child.”

in a manner that recalls c. Wright
Mills, he blames dominant power struc-
ture for the difficulties of ownership in
a decent society. The military and in-
dustrial complex thinks only in terms
of Gross National Product and Mr.
Goodman questions whether what is
good for GNP is necessarily good for
America. For example. he estimates by
1935 an adequate number of cars were
present in this country, but the num-
bers have needlessly increased to the
detriment of the city, the countryside
and the living standard at many Amen
icons. Goodman also questions the san-

Our lives are becoming more and
more regimented, claims Goodman, and
education is his prime example of this.
Early and continuous pressure for
preparation tor high school and col-
lege is on an accelerating scale. Good<
man would like everyone to have at
least two years outside of school he-
tore entering college. “Most oi the
brighter people would be better outside
the ‘babysitting’ or college

Goodman’s major criticism or the
Great Society is that in order to be
great it must eliminate more than half
of that society. He said the old and
young as well as many of the minority
groups have been either pensioned oil
or otherwise eliminated lrorn legitimate
participation in our society,

In order to get this half back in
society Goodman advocates mass pro—
test. ln the conilict between corporate
interest and the will at the people.
Goodman sees this method the must ef-
Iective. He points to its increasing use
in areas ranging irom action against
recalcitrant school boards to super
markets.

Part at the cure that Goodman pro-
poses is a diversilicatton or the econo-
my not only in types oi products and
services oiiered but also in the style at
their production. Corporation c o n t r at
should be modiiied so that everyone,
including the individual craftsman, has
all equal opportunity. He also suggests
that living conditions as a whole should
begin this diversification. We are laced
with a present situation that is exces-
sively urbanized. Urban costs increase
geometrically with population increases.
This affects the moral and aesthetic
state or a society. Rural living should
be subsidized to make it as attractive
as the city. Goodman points out the
amount paid for public housing in cltiei
far exceeds that needed for his rural
project.

Goodman closed his remarks by say-
ing he would be in iavor ot a moderate
form at world government that would
be kept {mm the excesses or present
nation states. He suggested the United
Nations Still provides the most eiiec-
tive means for creating this world goV<

at the police station, and in tact he did
not show up there,” he said.

Frank continued that an oliicial
at the police station said it might be a
deputy badge given out a dime a dozen
to certain people with jobs in the police
department. He said it really meant
nothing.

Frank telephoned the Polk County at-
torney's oiiice on Monday. He spoke to
a man named Bergeson. He said “The

large responsibility oi students for their
own education, and an exciting intellec—
tual climate."

He also included as prio les the ap-
propriate distribution of finances within
the institution and a lessening ol diver
slonary organization “The problems or
divisionary organization beset adminisA
trative affairs, inculty ailairs, and stu-
dent affairs, At the present time, mesa
problems retlect prevalent ideas and
ideals of ‘community' and of ‘student
involvement,’ both of which are relevant
to the weltare of the surviving college. . .
If we stick to the inevitable tacts we
should be talking about the college in
terms of a ‘pluralism or communities
in appropriate coordination, rather than
in terms of ‘the community’. . . Let us
be aware . . . that the nerve centers of
the college in its main educational busi
ness are the teachers individually and
the academic departments, not faculty
committees or ‘tho administration.’ Let
us be aware, too, that students speaking
{or students in education decision-making
would not be equivalent to speaking
competently tor them. It the student is
an expert in his view or the learning
situation, and I think his is, it is an
especially singular matter."

Frank was later told this was not cor-
rect by Val Schoenberg, a Des Moines
attorney. He has written that bed

to speak with the Iowa Civil Liberties
