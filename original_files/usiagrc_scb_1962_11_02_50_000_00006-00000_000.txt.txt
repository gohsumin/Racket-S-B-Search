Grinncll's football coach, Edd
’Bowers, said Saturday after his
Pioneers had defeated Carleton
13-9, “You win some lucky
Ones."

That may he the understate
nicnt oi the year. Bowcr's
league leading gridders re—
mained undeieated last week
thanks to Grinnell’s good do-
tense and a Carleton end drop— .
ping two sure touchdown
passes with no one near him.

Carleton scored its first and
only touchdown of the game in
the first quarter, as the Carl:
moved 60 yards iii 12 plays, In‘
the series Dave Larson, the
Carls’ quarterback, led the
march with his roll—out running
and passing A Larson pass
thrown to Steve Duermeyer ac

Gar Hoersehgen kicked the
extra point, and the Carls were
on to a 770 icad,

GRINNELL CAME BACK late
in the first quarter and with
Carlton Peterson carrying the
brunt oi the attack, the Pit)-
neers moved 56 yards in seven
plays to score, Carlton Peterson
scored the touchdown, sweeping
his own ioit end lor seven yards.

The Pioneers iakcd a kick tor

points, but. an Art Peterson to

Carleton added two more‘

when Art Peterson was tackled
in the Gi-inneu end zone aiter
