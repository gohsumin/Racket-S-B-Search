For the first time in several
years Grinnell‘s wrestlers may
able to provide an impetus in
the Pioneers drive for the
mythical all~sports champion—
ship. ‘
Generally optimistic, coach
Terry Moore said, “Barring in.
Juries and/or a letdown in team
morale, I think we should fin-
ish in the first division. It’s a
young team with some good
sophomores. Sophomore Larry,
Miller at 167 is outstanding, and]

The team has lost only Brucel
Robinson, Tom Cook and Dick
Harris by graduation Lastl
year’s captain, Wayne Gano, is,
still in school, but an injury
which he suiiered last year has
ended his athletic career.

There will be three matches
h e i o r e Christmas vacation,
The first oi these will be at
the Knox Invitational Nov. so
where the varsity will get its
first look at some oi the con- 1
ierence teams. The long sea-
son ends March 1 with the
conference meet in which
Grionell finished tenth last
year.

“This year's frosh team should
be at least the equal or last
year’s better - than . average
team,” stated Moore. Although
it is hurt by a lack of depth,
the team has a solid nucleus oi
five experienced wrestlers.

The varsity include Len Cal-
odney, John Gaarde, Al Mac-
Knight, Ken Clymer, Will Van
Horne, Larry Miller, Mike De—
Witt, Marty Ringo, Morgan
Michel, Ed Johnson, Bill Gala
buncff and Karl Smiley. .
