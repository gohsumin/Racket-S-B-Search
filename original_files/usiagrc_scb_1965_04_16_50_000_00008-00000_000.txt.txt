Guess what, everybody? The
IM jocks have a brand new
softball field. This wonderful
new acquisition is appropriate
1y called “Stables Field,"
though the title may be some-
what inaccurate, as no self-re-
specting horse would be caught
responding to the call of nature
on that field. Stables Field Will
provide a wholly different con-
cept of softball, as leftrfielders
go cavorting downhill after long
ﬂies, and catchers tumble down
ditches after foul balls. It will
be interesting to count the num-
ber of twisted ankles that turn
up as iielders and baserunners
alike desperately try to avoid
the gopher holes and minia-
ture moats on this obstacle
course.

The beauty of this field can—
not begin to be described—you
really have to see it, If the late
Robert Frost had ever seen
Stables Field, his immediate
response would have been to
pukel Then, too, he might con-

 

ceivably have become “late" a
lot sooner.

Be that as it may, the soft-
ball season got started a day
late last Tuesday. It’s still pretr
ly early to be making any ac-
curate predictions, of course,
bilt it looks to me like West.
Clark, and maybe Smith, will
be in contention for the crown,
But don’t put any money on
it, because I also pick the Cubs
to win the National League
pennant every year.

Last Sunday saw West take
first iii the 1M Bowling tour-
ney, It was a hectic after-
noon, with each ball close on
the heels of the one before, Sec-
ond and third place went to
Dibble and Smith respectively.

Yet to be played are track
and golri There especially
seems to be a tremendous
amount oi enthusiasm ior goli,
as many of the IM golfers have
been walking out to the golf
course wini their girl iriends,
presumably to check the lay
out of the course. Good golf-
ing, iellasi *

The Pioneer baseball team
fell to Central College Tuesday
14-7, The Pioneers got behind

allowed Grinnell one unearned
run.

mound for the Pioneers and
gave up nine runs in the three
innings he pitched. Dave SchatZ
