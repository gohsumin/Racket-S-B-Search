Off-campus Residence to Close;
Dean Cites Economy, Life Style

By Jim Herzog

Grinnell‘s Dean of Men, S.
Eugene Thompson, has an-
nounced that a men’s offscamp—
us house will be closed as a
residence effective during the
college’s interim session and
that the nine male residents of
the house will be required to
move into vacant rooms on
North Campus.

in making the move, Thomp-
son said, “The house is being
closed for reasons that are
partly economic and partly
matters of good student af-
fairs administration.” He cited
the houses distance from the
campus and its difficulties in
“maintaining a wholly desir-
able style of life" as two rea-
sons lor moving the nine sen<
ior and junior men back on
campus.

The off-campus residence is
located at 1019 Park Street,
which is half a block south of
Grinnell‘s Fine Arts Center.
Like Grinnell’s three women's
and other men's off-campus
residences, the house is a ren-
ovated private home. This is
the fourth year that this house
has been used as a men's dor-
mitory.

Thompson said that the de
cision to close the off-campus
was his, and was made in con-
sultation with the business of-
fice and the acting president of
the college,

Commenting on the decision.
Thompson said the move was
a case Of “institutional neces-
sity," as “there are empty
spaces on North Campus, and
it’s thought to be good manage-
ment to move students there."

He said, “The whole idea of
residence halls is compromised
by off-campus houses,” but an
“overflow” device must be

 

used to take care of over-ad-
mission.

Thompson also said that the
change does not indicate a
move to eliminate off-campus
houses nor does it mean that
the nine men were not “taking
cane of their business."

He did, however, cite two re-
ports of rules being broken at
loll) Park Street as factors in
the decision, He said a girl had
been seen leaving the house af-
ter women’s hours and that
once the lounge had been bad-
ly messed up.

The chairman of 1019 Park
Street. Jack Hurwitz, called the
decision unfair, saying “If the

* ‘k *

excuse or reason about style
of life were real, we should
have been warned first."

Said Hurwitz, "Everything
seemed to be taking place be-
hind our backs, and we were
never sure whether the idea to
move us out of Park Street was
ﬁnancial or whether he
(Thompson) just wanted to
close up the campus. We still
don’t know whether the finan-
cial reasons were a subter-
fuge."

Hurwitz also said that the
girl seen leaving the Park
Street residence after hours
was the wife of a Grinnell
senior.

House Closed: Room Painted by 8&6;
Interior Decoration Back to Normulcy

When college officials lock
up 1019 Park Street, closing it

as a residence hall. one room ,

in it will have a fresh coat of
paint.

A semester-long battle be-
tween students, letter writers,
and Buildings and Grounds
over room repainting, received
a fresh touch during Christa
mas recess when Buildings and
Grounds repainted a room in
1019 Park Street.

The repainting struggle be-
gan in the fall when student
Tom Morrow, appalled by the
pink floral design of his room’s
wallpaper, painted his room
light gray, his ceiling grayish
blue, and the doors and radio-
tors black.

Equally appalled by Mor-
row’s audacity, the head of
Buildings and Grounds, Evan
H. Walden, had his organiza-
tion repaint the room in the

A change in the breakfast

Breakfast will be served in the
Quadrangle dining room from
3:30 to 9:00 am on Sunday
mornings, thus shortening the
serving period by l5 minutes.

When everyone at the table

will be re-set for the next group.

There will be no changes

The bill for the repainting
will be over $40, and Morrow
will be asked to pay.

Asked about the case, Wal-
den said, ”It's not one room or
any other room; it‘s a policy."

Walden said that an interior
decorator has drawn up a color
scheme for the campus rooms,
and Morrow violated the color
schemeiwhich is bone white.

“As far as people painting
their own rooms goes, that‘s
out," said Walden, “If they go
ahead, they certainly have to
take the consequences."

Walden was particularly mif-
fed by Morrow’s use of black
trim, saying ”We don’t go
along with that sort of thing."

Morrow however said he liked
black, commenting, “Black is
even the color of the trim in the
college library and the new
union, which buildings, the lat:
ter especially, are in impec-
cably good taste.”

Morrow said also, “Of the
many ridiculous things B&G
does in the name of policy, I
feel there is a special case here
in that absurdity has generat—
ed absurdity to a degree that
challenges even the lively
imagination.

Walden, however, finds the
matter serious and said that the
painting was done in case the
house would be reopened next
year or in case it were rented
out.

This week’s 5&5 is the trial
issue for the new editor and
business manager —— John Wolf
and Harold Fuson. The next is-
sue will be published on Jan. 22
and will signal Wolf and Fuson‘s
official takeover.

 

Student Senate Proposes Changes
To Set Up New ‘Advisory Council'

By Wayne Stengel

Wednesday night the Student
Senate approved constitutional
amendments which would cre-
ate an advisory council of 21
members as the primary organ
of student government. These,
as all proposed amendments,
must be approved by 60 per
cent of those voting in a stu-
dent referendum. The Senate
vote was 32 in favor, one op-
posed, and one abstention.

If the student body approves
the amendments, in a vote to be
held early in the second semes-
tier, they will be sent to the
faculty and the President of
the college for approval.

Student government officials
said that if these amendments
receive the approval of all con-
cerned, they will be put into
effect before the end of the
present student officials’ terms.

Much of the meeting was
devoted to parliamentary dis-
cussions of amendments to the
proposed amendments.

An amendment was proposed
by SGA President Phil John-
son to replace article 15 of the
new system with a provision
that would provide for a mem-
ber of the advisory council be-
ing elected to serve as SGA
treasurer, and to be in charge
of the SGA and general budget
and reserve funds. Johnson
said that the proposal was in—
troduced at the request of Sue
Taylor, who now serves as una
official SGA treasurer even
though such an office is not
provided for in the present con-
stitution and had been over-
looked in the proposals. The
amendment was quickly adopts
ed.

Social Fund Boost
Okayed by College

An increase of ten dollars per
student per year will be added
to the social funds, according to
Palmer Hartl, SOClal Coordina—
tor. The increase is included
in the 3100 increase in the to-
tal college fees for the 196566
academic year,

$4,500.00 will be allocated to
the Forum fund, Which will
be used to program the activi-
ties of the new college Forum,

This fund Will be handled by
the student social committees.

Additional funds, amounting
to $6 00 per student per year,
less the $4,500 in the Forum
fund, (about $2,400 per year)
will be used for procuring and
maintaining equipment for the
Forum. These funds will be ad—
ministered by the college,

The additional $400 per stu-
dent per year (about $4,000)
will go into the regular social
program, “These additional
funds will meet the projected
needs outlined by the Social
Coordinating Committee last
spring," Hartl said. He added
that the general areas where
most of the funds will go are
concerts and formal dances,
but he stressed that their allot-
ment will be-at the discretion
of the Social Coordinating Com-
mittee for ’65-’66.

 

E'd. note: Miss ”ifa-ylo’rwair~ .
asked by the sea to‘cor‘d— "
ment on this proposal. She
said that though she has dis-
cussed the situation with
Johnson and Jim Parkison,
Speaker of the Senate, she
was unaware of this amend<
ment until asked for com-
ments.

Another amendment proposed
by Sue Johnson, which wa
passed over the opposition 0
some women senators, would
provide for the election of was
men representatives to the ad-
visory council within two
weeks after room drawings in
the spring, and for the elec-
tion of alternates within two
or three weeks after the begin-
ning of classes in the fall. This
would provide for a quorum so
that the council could begin its
work soon after returning to
campus in the fall While also

Wiﬂgrui Announces
Student Insurance

“This life insurance program, en-
dorsed by the United States Na-
tional Student Association, is the
best one in comparison with other
available programs,” said George
Wittgraf, campus NSA coordinator.
Interest in some kind at program
was expressed last summer and
with NSA negotiating for its mem-
ber colleges, it was able to gel:
this inexpensive policy because of
the large number of students in-
volved.

Any NSA college student is ela<
gible through age 33. The student-
terrn rate for $10,000 insurance is
$20 per year through age 24, and
increases only slightly as the stu~
dent gets older. The plan we;
change automatically to Whole
Life coverage with cash values
(and reduced rates for the first 4
years) upon graduation unless the
student prefers some other ar-
rangement.

The American Health and Life
Company guarantees:

1) Coverage is renewable and
noncancellable by the company as
long as the premiums are paid.

Z) Rates cannot be increased.

3) Restrictions cannot be added.

4) Benefits cannot be reduced.

5) Students Who enroll now but
do not finish college can continue
coverage at the term rate until
after their original expected grad-
uation date.

Coverage is open to any Grinnell
College student and the open en-
rollment period extends to Feb. 28,
1965. Grinnell College is not selling
insurance, but as a member of
NSA is simply making this pro-
gram available, For any further

graf.
