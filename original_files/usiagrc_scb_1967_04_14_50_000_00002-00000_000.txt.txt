ISII factionalism a warning to Grinnell

The situation at Iowa State ex-
emplifies the worst possible one in
which a student government can
find itself. Campus politics are pol-
arized around the person of Donald
Smith and the Iowa State Daily.
Various factions strive for power
in the wake of an unfortunate in-
cident. The senate seems intent on
proving its power to control the
chief executive elected by the
campus as a whole. In a day and
age when there are so many issues
of importance on which students
could unite for constructive action,
the Government of the Student
Body at ISU seems intent on wast-
ing precious energy in petty bick-
ering, semantic exercises and blat-
ant maneuvering for positions of

political power or mere prestige.
Similar dangers exist at Grinnell.
All too often of late there has
been talk of factionalism in Grin-
rlell’s recently elected student gov-
ernment. It is no secret that the
Executive Cabinet and the Council
of House Presidents display a wide
range of political views. It has be»
come fashionable to characterize
student government leaders as
“liberal" or “conservative,” labels
which achieve significance only
during electoral campaigns, lf at
all. Elections are over. Our student
government represents all the stu-
dents. Let us get down to serious
business of responsible reform
which is at hand. C A

Openness characterizes sex series

News Analysis
By Susan narqulst

This week‘s sex education program
was a revealing exploration or the at-
mosphere and attitudes on campus.
Large attendance at lectures and active
participation in question periods showed
that students are interested in the Sub-
ject and are neither ashamed nor un-
easy in showing this interest.

The objective viewpoint and profes«
lional ability of the speakers were
most clearly seen in the question and
answer sessions. Both speakers fielded
more than an hour's worth of questions
marked by their openness. Students
seemed to have questions more concerns
ing physiology than sociology.

The lectures attempted to cover as-
pects or the physiology and sociology or
sex assuming little knowledge on the
part of the audience. As a result, the
presentations were quite simple. The
discussions. on the other hand, were
detailed and varied; from anatomy to
physiological iunctioning oi birth con-
trol pills, the ethical and political ques-
tions of abortion and the role of guilt
in sexuality.

More than two hundred students
signed up to discuss the subject and
the idea of a continued sex education
program.

The faculty panel today at 4 pm.
promises to increase the session’s value

by relating the topic more directly to
Grinneil.

Fast on April 21 will
aid Sudanese refugees

Last semester about sun students par-
ticipated in a fast to raise money to
beneﬁt Sudanese refugee students. The
effort netted $450 from SAGA.

The Senate has again endorsed a
proposal to have a fast on Friday,
April 21, for the same cause. Signrup
lists will be sent to each hall for stu<
dents who wish to participate.

Student sympathizers, led by John
Garang dc Mabior, have been able
so far to sponsor eight students in high
schools in Africa, paying $750 annually
for their education. in addition to this,
de Mahior has been making efforts to
ralse enough money to bring some stu-
dents to us. colleges. He hopes two
or three students will be able to come
next tall, probably at least one to

Grinneli. He will have raised enough '

money by then to cover room and board
Costs for at least two students. Tuition
will be waived by the colleges concerned.

Money from the April 21 fast will

mainly be used to defer part oi the
solo transportation cost ior each stu-
dent who comes,

Additional donations can be sent (0

Senate in retrospect

By Bond Faulwell
Former Speaker of the Senate

This year has, in many ways, been a
most successiul one for a newly re-
established Senate which had to struggle
against the burden or lack nl experience
resulting irom last year's experiment
without a senate. Under this senate we
saw the passage oi such items vital lo
student interest as the abolition of wom—
en‘s hours and the adoption or a new
court system. However, the real work
of the senate takes place in its commil-
tees and not on the floor of the senate
iiseli. in order to make the student body
more cognizant of this fact, i would like
to deal with a iew of the highlights of
the work of this year's committees.

Admissions Committee

I would first like to examine those
committees which were created pri-
marily to voice student opinion to the
faculty and administration. One such
committee was the Admissions Commit-
too which worked very closely with DI‘
rector of Admissions Dale Terry. This
committee has been instrumental in in-
ltiating a “personal Contact” program in
which Grinnell students contact prospec-
tlve students over vacation periods and
eat dinner with them when they are on
campus.

other achievements of the group in-
clude the compilation of a Tour Guide
Handbook, the revision or the Grinneil
Education pamphlet, and the distribu-
tion and tabulation or a freshman quell.
humans to aid Mr, Terry.

Curricular Affairs

The Curricular Afiairs Committee to
operated closely with the Faculty Com-
mittee on Educational Policy and Cur-
riullum. It related the Course evalua-
lion forms and spawned the Interim
Committee.

Library

The Library Committee also worked
with a parallel faculty committee. They
,saw to it that the library staff removed
books left overnight on the Carrels and
also made known student interest in
such things as the carpeting oi the“-
brory (which is currently being investi-
gated).

Food and Wages

Sometimes however, ii appears that a
senate commlttee is pitted against other
groups on campus. Such was the role or
the Senate Committee on Food Service
and Student Wage Scales which caused
the raising at student wages irom 3.35 to
the present 31.00-51.25 scale (which will
soon reach the $1.50 minimum pre-
scribed by the 1966 amendments to the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938).

Book Store
Another group that opposed an exist-
ing campus instiiulion was the Book
Store Committee. Through its efforts a
student is now on the book store staff,

more specific departmental books have
been ordered, and (at least for the sec-
ond semester) ihe problem of crowded
check-out lines was alleviated with the
interim period being used tor the pur-
chase of books. The committee has also
pointed to the need for a larger book
store and ialrer prices for the drug
store items offered for sale.

Student Services

Some senate committees aimed at
providing student services. The Student
Used aoolr Store committee supplied
books to the student body at prices iar
lower than the book store and also paid
iar more in buying them.

The Counseling Committee also strove
to improve the life oi the Grinnell stu-
dent, This committee solicited student.
faculty, and administration opinion on
the adequacy of the present psychologi-
cal counseling services available. It
made known to the administration stu-
dent feeling on the inadequacy of the ad-
visory system on South Campus and the
need for psychological facilities in Grin~
nell itself. The committee also brought
a psychiatrist, Dr. Harold Balikov, to
campus for consultation about counsel-
ing needs. Finally, this committee
enumerated what it thought were the
speciiic responsibilities or each level of
counseling open to the student body.

The Radio Station Committee studied
the role at a campus station, the type 01
programming it would offer, the space
needed for it, and its cost. The study
showed that a campus radio station can
be a reality, it there exists an available
source of funds.

Transportation

The Transportation Commlttee utilized
a student questionnaire and a careful
lnve igatlnn of existing transportation
facil ies to make several recommenda-
tions to the administration. Chief among
these were the securing of a new bus
tor the college community, more Col-
lege station wagons and the employment
of a private rental service for students.

The National Student Association
Committee continued to Carry out such
vital responsibilities as the chartered
flight to Europe, NSA insurance, repre-
sentation at major student conferences
and the providing of NBA information to
campus organizations.

Finance

The only permanent senate committee,
the Finance Committee, budgets SGA
funds. In addition to this vital respon-
sibility, this year the committee made
recommendations to the senate to ap
propriate money from General Budget
and Reserve for activities and events of
importance to the student body, This iri—
cluded such things as appropriating
money for the Sex Education Program,
Interim, the Midwest Model United Na-
tions, and the Indian Musiciansi
