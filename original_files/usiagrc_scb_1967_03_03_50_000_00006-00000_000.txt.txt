More On
The P.E. Complex

To the Editor:

Being a supporter oi the
new RE. complex I would like
to consider the questions of
whether the complex would
lead to an overempiiasis on

athletics at the expense oi oth~
er programs and ot whether
the m3. complex hinders nlhs
er necessary building pro
grams,

1 will deal with the cond
question iiist. The admi stra-
tion seems to teel that they
have a good chance at getting
the money tor the complex
iroin loans and grants which
would not hinder other build-
ing which President Leggett
announced in his iive and ten
year programs. Granted it this
money does not become avail.
able the money will have to
be raised elsewhere and other
programs may be hindered.
However, the PE. dcpa .
ments are a part ot the Gr
hell community and tor this
reason they should receive due
consideration tor their require.
ments, especially since they
have been waiting on the
priority list since 1951. One
good reason ior building the
complex now is that the funds
available now probably will
not be available in several
years so that building now may
be the best way not to inter-
iere with other programs and
still tuliill our needs in this
area.

The next part oi the ques-
tion is whether or not the
complex would lead to an liver-
emphasis oi “jacks" at the ex-
pense oi other segments oi the
college community. At the
present time it is very hard to
believe that this is the case
because with the present ath-
letic iacilities it is very hard
to attract the scholar-athlete
much less the so-cailcd "pure
jock" type. For the inturc one
can only hope for the continu-
ance oi the this taculty and

tor a mature student body to
keep Grinnell troin becoming
a “jack" school.

it may be interesting in this
light to make a comparison
with another school which has
iaced the same problem. Carle~
ton completed a new men’s
PE. complex in 1964. They
have also recently completed a
woman's P. complex contain-
ing some litles which are
superior to the ones we have
now tor all campus use. While
in Nortlitield recently I hap
pened to read the carletonian
and I found that their stu-
dents are generally concerned
about the same things as we
are as reported by the sits
with the exception that no one
there is worried about an over-
empliasis on athletics. I hope
that the 5&3 can contirm this
atter interviewing the Carle-
ton student leaders.

with these considerations in
mind it is very diiiicult ior me
to see that there is a problem
oi emphasis and degree with
regard to the new complex ex-
cept possibly in some peoples’

minds.

The Review of

“After the FaII”

To the Editor:

I am very sorry that. the 55d}
found it necessary to “call in"
someone from outsids to red
View After the Fall: I think
that a mistake was made in do-
ing So. and I also think that
this mistake led to some even
more regretahle results.

I do not pretend to be a pro-
iessional reviewer oi plays nor
a reviewer oi plays at all, but
rather a mere member oi the
audience With some experience
in theater and also with very
close to the same obser ‘onal
and emotional sensihil ics as
any other person, including
Nicholas Meyer.

The iirst mistake was in
thinking that going outside oi
the community to engage an
unbiased observer would con-
sequently produce unbiased re.
sults. In one sense this is true:
the bias ot iamiliarity with the
cast is avoided. On the other
hand, it is possible to engage
an observer who is too preoc.
cupicd with the dramatically
and technically protessional
theater to be aware oi the col-
lege and nonrprofessioml con
text oi such a production, It
seems to me that anyone at
this college would admit that
we are not a protessional thea-
tcr nor are we trying to be
one. It Nicholas Meyer were
going to pit our production
against the Lincoln Repertory
and Elia Kazan, then perhlpl
he has grounds ior his review;
but I don't think he can use a
prnfessional production or pro.
iessional methods as a stand-

ard ior comparison; and I say
this simply because I don't
think we are or can try to be
protessional with the resources
we have,

It is also very good to be ta
iniiiar with Arthur Miller's
lite and the relevance oi the
play to his lite. But for the
sake oi reviewing. let’s stick
to the staging and the script,
not to its cause; the script is a
common denominator ior any
production and the stage and
the context oi the stage are
the variables.

Again. I suppose that trom a
professional point oi view, the
iirst night’s production oi a
play is likely to be a pretty
good standard ior judging sub-
sequent performances, But
again. too, this is not a profes-
sional theater. Perhaps the re
viewer should have remained
one or two more nights bciorc
making his judgments and
then he might have been justi-
fied in saying what he did it
what he said were still the
case.

It is indeed untortunate that
two at the tour night's audi-
ences, myseli included, were
given the review to read be
tore they saw the play, I
couldn't help but go into the
production with a negative at.
titndc, Fortunately, and I
hope it is the same case ior
the rest oi the audiences. i
overcame this ieeling in the
iirst hour and twenty minutes
oi the play, and I do not re-
call “scratching behind the
ears." And as iar as no con-
cerned (and that's all this is
about), when I come out ot a
play hating one character, lov-
ing another, weeping ior an.
other, and empathizing with
another, I know that that play
is protoundly entertaining, and
ior this college, to be highly
prized.

On Neil Fischer
To the Editor:

1 don’t imagine anybody will
pay any attention to this letter
because I am a triend oi
SAGA Chuck's as well as a
SAGA worker. As iar as I know
Neil Fischer has never once
eonverscd with Chuck about
complaints or constructive sug-
gestions which he might have.
He resorts to letters and hurts
his “campaign" to improve our
iood. How can he expect chang-
es when he antagonizes the peo-
ple he should be talking with
on a halfwayrhiiman basis?

Why doesn't Neil organize
a committee to meet on iriend.
ly terms with SAGA to tails
about the quality or our iood?
Learn about the limitations oi
our kitchens, the problems ot
cooking tor silo guys, and the
results oi the SAGA surveys on
campus, Make some decent sug-
gestions. consider the money
you spend ior meals ior over
200 days. the tact that the re-
cent Board increase was the
iirst in about '1 years, and rise
ing iood prices.

It Neil really wants to see
some progress and not merely
shoot oii his month, then I
hope he will iollow this sug-
gestion. Ii he doesn’t really
want to see anything done we
should ask SAGA to let tiio
College run the kitchens tor
one month. Then we would real.
ly experience had institutional
iood.

I'm sick of seeing Chuck

bashed around like some dog.
Treat him iairly or shut up, I
seriously doubt that Neil
speaks ior any maiority, It he
does, I think we've got a prob
lent—and it's not Saga.

More on Fischer
To the Editor:

In response to Neil Fisch-
er’s comments on Grinnell
iood i i .

Mr. Fischer, I too am ted up.
I am more than a little tired of
reading letters to the editor
that substitute poor taste and
oilensivc language ior wit and
satire. I am also tired ot being
told that, as a member oi a
group that is reasonably satis-
tied with many aspects oi
Grinnell lite, including the
iood. I am some kind oi mind<
less belcher oi “acrimonious
platitude l' indoctrinatcd by
the admi istration and lacking
in any kind ot discrimination.
But I am especially tired or
listening to people complain
because Grinnell iood inst
daesn’t measure up to their ul-
trahigh, gourmet standards.

Atter iour years at Grinnell I
am convinced that our iood
service, as I have seen it in op.
eration at the Quad, is gen-
uinely concerned with giving
us the best possible service,
SAGA wants to know what we
want and like and sincerely
tries to please us. or course
our iood isn't periect, and
there is room ior improve-
ment here, just as there is
room for improvement in
many aspects oi liie at Grille
hell. But SAGA is so much bet-
ter than so many school cater.
ing services (and I am familiar
with several) that there is al-
most no comparison, and I am
ied up with people who com-
plain because they can't have
pertection,

Have you ever considered
being appreciative oi the
things you do have? Or are the
rights and privileges oi at-
finance and intellect too great
to allow this? Ii you can iind
time train your literary ac~
tivity, think about this tor a
moment.

In the meantime. it you can
find a college that will serve
you pheasant under glass and
champagne, or homecooking
just like mother’s I suggest
that you transicr as soon as

possible”
