As you can see, this yEar prom-
ises to be a full one with more
productions directed and written
by students. Naturally, with this
schedule, Grinnell students will
not only be welcomed in their
accustomed role as spectators, but
also are invited to indulge apti—
tudes and interests in all phases
of drama. The tour or the back-
stage of Roberts Theatre pre-
sented by the Grinnell Players was
well attended by both freshmen
and upperclassrnen, At that time
crews were signed for the year,
but there is always room for
more. A word to Mrl Meyer will
be wise.

> Summer with Friends' Service

(Conlinued {mm Page 4)

Suzy Foster, senior, worked with
a Friends‘ Service project in Ore-
gon, and Janet Nichol, sophomore,
lived and worked on u Sioux In<
dian reservation, on a project
sponsored by the YMCA. Penny
Bevls and Ted Risser, seniors,
spent the summer working in an
Iowa home for juvenile delin»
quents.

Chicago attracted many of the
service-minded Grinnellians this
summer, as always. Jack Dun-
ning. senior, worked with primary

 

age children {mm the South Side,
while Jean Cook's project, titled
REACH, involved 50 high-school
students from the entire city and
suburban areas. Both of these pro-
grams attempted to provide new
experiences in the arts, commu-
nications and urban life for the
participants. Sarah Vanderwicken,
sophomore. was one of several
Grinnellians who were Involved in
the "War on Poverty," working
with Project Headstart in Chicago.

Meanwhile, back at the lac-
tory . . .
