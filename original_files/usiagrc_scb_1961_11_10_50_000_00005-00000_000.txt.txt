“This nationalization would be
sintul and absolutely contrary

-, to the spirit oi the Constitution,”
Capehart said, “and nationalizae
tion leads to communism."

U. Senator

Humphrey (Dem Minn, told which holders ot the two politi—

an audience oi. 700 in Darby
gym last Tuesday that “coopl
crative, planned action on the‘
part oi every participant in a
free society is the only way to
preserve ireedom."

And the question which Amer
icans must ask themselves. hc
said, is “How may we bette utis
lizc our physical and spi tual
l'csoul'ces tor development oi a
tree world."

The statements were part oi
his lecture on the roles of lib.
eralism and conservatisim in the,
United States, past, present and
iuture. His talk was the first in;
the three~day First Annual Fuel
litical Lectureship sponsored by‘

cal Political Education High»,

moderated by Clark Moileml
holi, Washington correspondent
tor the Cowlcs publications

Following an introduction byl
State Democratic central com-l
mittee chairman Lex Hawkins,
Humphrey said he would at-
tempt to make more than an
“academic dissertation.” instead,
he said, he would attempt to
present “Practical observations
which might shed light on my;
views oi American liberalism," ,

“The liberal today repre. s
sents change,” Humphrey told I
the audiencer “The Spence inn 1
liberal oi the 19th century is '
the conservative oi today."
And, he pointed out, “the can-
scrvative oi one country might ‘
bc a liberal in his iieigllbor~

iiig country-"

“All Americans agree on cer-
tain iundamentals of dcmocr ie‘
government,” Humphrey said,
stressing that “We are Amcl
cans beiorc we are liberals or
conservatives,” But, the Senatori

pointed out, the difference in‘
liberal and Conservative lllinking‘

H becomes evident in the ways ml velop better economic

cal viewpoints try to solve the
ills of society.

“We liberals have a deep con»'
cern ior our fellow humans . . .l
we sympathize with those who

selves Conse "ritivcs ireoucntlyi
scek to solve ills by shaping the
tools oi administration rather
than iniccting programs which
answer basic human needs,”i
Humphrey said. 1,

“Liberals honor independence,’
a unique personality and individ;
uality," the Senator said. “Cons
iormity iinds a convcnient part-
ner in conservatism . . . person
ality iinds a happer partner int
liberalism.”

“Want to load a dull, come .‘
placcnt life?" he asked, “then
he a conservative. Conserva—
tivcs may tlilnk they live a
long time but it's because it
is so dull it just seems that
way. ,

“The liberal knows that
change is incvttablc," he said,
“He knows that the best daysl
are coming, These days are the
most exciting since the beginning
oi time."

Citing the European Common
Market as the “new capitalism
of the West", Humphrey said
that “European governments

the altars uf inilation or deflael
titan" ‘

Compared to the thriving Eure
opcan countries, “The US, is an
arthritic old age pensioner,"
Humphrey said.

“U. s. liberals consistently
support the steps used in de-
velopment oi the thriving Euro—
pean economy, according to
Humphrey. Those stops, he said,1

"Planning in a democracy

is an extension oi the voice oi i

Lack oi cooperation is what i
Khrushchev wants" 1

“We must make NATO a po
litical as well as a military dis
liance," he said. “And, shortly,
we must become a partner in‘
the European Common Marhc.

“The Soviet Union is not the
strongest nation on earth, only
tlic loudest,” he said. “We my
the most powertul most

Criticising conservative eco-
nomics, he said it is “created at
the top . . so that it will trickle;
down," The liberal attempts to
create wealth where it should:
be created, he said, “at the both
