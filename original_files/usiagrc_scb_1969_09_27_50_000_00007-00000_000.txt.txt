Sleep-In Bombs

By Kay Carlson

it was a clear, cool night on
Mac Field. The stars twinkling
down tor the Saga Sleeprln
were dismayed at the scarcity
or souls below. Who would reap
of the wisdom they poured from
the heavens?

Only seven Individuals had
stayed after the initial attrac—
tion of the artificial llicker of
Laurel and Hardy and atter
Saga Chuck’s iruit drink. Only
seven would watch the Big
Bear caVurt in the sky.

But alas, even during this
display some of them retreat-
.ed [0 a tent, and oLhers fell
asleep! Was there no one to
divine their message? indeed,
the distant thrub at" a single
guitar raised in song, answer-
ed that there was no one. And
In the past there had been blin-
dreds with voices raised in
aims of praise — in song and
in philosophy. But now, no
one.

Then, it was early morning.
A loyal Saga worker opened
the doors at Cowles at 6:15. He
awaited the exhausted students
of the heavens; no one came.
The stars blinked quickly and
disappeared.

fees for the remainder of the
school year.

The two main factors alfect-
ing the decision will be the in-
crease in board cost for next
semester If the reierendum
passes, and the probable insti-
tution or a checking system,
in me form of 11) cards. to be
presented at each meal.

According to the figures pre-
sented to the Student Affairs
Committee, ii the nineteen-or—so
students who expressed a de-
sire to iorego board should do
so, the increase in fees for re-
maining boarders would be
$5.40 tor the year. (When the
number of boarders decreases,
the decrease in Saga expenses
is not Comparable, so the fee
per remaining boarder must:
increase for the college to meet
its contract with Saga.) The
college would absorb the cost
tor this semester, but next se-
mester each student would be
paying $2.70 more in board.

In addition. some sort of
checking procedure would have
to be enforced. The SAC is
working on other alternatives,
but so far the proposed sys-
tem would be to issue each
student a photo ID card indi‘
eating his board status and re-
quire him to present it at each
meal. The cost of the card per
student would be about $1.50
(or maybe less), and the cost
or empioying checkers would
be about 5.95 per student.
Therefore, the board cost next
semester would jump about
$515 per student.

a simple majority) the option
may not go into eiiect until
November 1. The proposed
option is only temporary and
experimental, since the SAC is
investigating other possible op-
tions for board arrangemenu.

It is up to the student body
to decide if the right of off-
campus students to be exempt-
ed from board is worth the in-
crease in fees and the imple-
mentation of n checking sys-
tem in the dining halls.
