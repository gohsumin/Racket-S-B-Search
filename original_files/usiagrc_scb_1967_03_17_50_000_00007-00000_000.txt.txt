Sunday marked the third year
in a row that Smith has won
1. M. howling With three men
over 500, Smith totaled 2402 to
2270 for second place Dibble.
High scores went to John Odell
with a 213, Dan Markmann a
212 and Steve Hunt 3 211. Hunt
had a 511 to take high series
while Stick-Bod, alias Spare-
Rib, alias Rick Kuethe con»
[rolled his banana ball well
enough to total 537. Markmann
at 526, Odell at 523 and Pete
Pauw at ads were the only other
bowlers to crack the 500 mark.
The scores seemed to he a good
deal lower this year than last,
probably due to the fact that
the people on North Campus are
studying harder and have less
time for fun.

At least one person hasn’t
been studying, though, and that
is yours truly who has im»
mersed hlmselt in basketball
