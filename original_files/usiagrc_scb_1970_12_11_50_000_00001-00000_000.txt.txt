VOL. LXXIX

Faculty Ends PE Requirement By 51-32 Vote

NO. 7

By John Pepper
and Tim Purges

Monday’s vote to abolish the
Physical Education require-
ment for graduation demon-
strated to the satisfaction of
most that the woodworkaround
here is at least as full ofAbo-
litionists as of the vicious re-
actionaries which the heritary
wisdom of campus politics
imputes.

The vote reversed the faculty
vote of two weeks previous to
maintain the requirement in a
lessened form. That meeting
was poorly attended, in part
because many liberal faculty
members hadassumedthatthe
requirement wouldbeabolishr
ed as a matter of course and
logic persuant to the Jones-
Clotfelter academic reforms.
Hence, they didn‘t bother to
show up, and the requirement
was retained by a 36-31 vote.
Two weeks of intensive lobbyr
ing followed, with the result
that a few votes changed and
about twenty abolitionists we-
re moved toattend, pushing the
abolution motion to a 51-32
victory.

It was necessary for the rec
consideration of the vote that
one person who had originally
voted with the majority pro
pose anewvote. Charles Clear
ver got up and spoke in this
role, saying that he had chi
anged his mind in the matter.
He said that his original vote
had been a reaction against
what he termed“Puritanism"
which cultivates mind at the
expense of body. He said that
his mind had been changed
because he felt all good things
need not be legislated with the
threat of witholding the B.A.

A brief debate followed, with
sporadic muttering-s of ”quesr
tion" from the perifery of the

DECEMBER 11, I970

auditorium. Debate recapitur
lated previous discussion,
with Phillip Kint-ner saying
that the retention of this single
requirement would make a
mockery of the work the fac-
ulty had done on academicre-
form. Coach Pfitsch said that
the PE Department did not
want sympathy votes, and that
the issue must be decided on
its merits alone. But he also
added that it implied “unfairr
ness", in sports at least, to
lose and then demand another
game “just to see if you can’t
win this time."

Nonetheless, the vete was
taken (by secret ballots, no
less) and the proposal to abo-
lish was carried by theafore-
mentioned margin.

Henceforth, no student will
be denied a diploma due to
his non— completion of the Phys
sicalrEducation requirement,
seniors included. TWO hours of
credit will be, given to those
who complete the syllabus of
the reformed requirement
passed at the previous meet-
ing.

Perhaps the most significant
segment of the meeting was
President Leggett‘s address
to the faculty, which will pro-
bably have wide rcpercusr
sions.

Liberalization, he said, is
noc about to be an acrossr
the-board phenomenon. The
administration must attempt
to control the ﬂow of students
from previously‘ required ar
eas into others. This will be
done by the advising system
and by close control of class
sizes. This means, among
other things, that students
must expect to find more and
earlier closing-out of class
sections.

Given the priority system of
putting seniors and majors in

GRINNE LL, IOWA 501 12

to courses before lower class-
men, etc., we can probably
expect increased freshman
dissatisfaction, unless more
and better freshman courses
are designed. Leggett did not
mention this problem: and it
probably will be the respon-
sibility of the Freshman Year
Committee, which is now be-
ing formed. As the semester's
debate draws to a emse, the
problems ofamdemicreform,
far from being settled, have
really scarcely begun.

loewi Coerces SGA 'I'oWithhold
Funds To Victims In Pakistan

by Don Dagenuis

On Thursday, Dec. 3. the Sen-
ate once again gathered togen
ther for one of those dinner
meetings to discuss the pres-
sing issues of the day over
those delicious SAGA culinary
delights. The only major ac-
tion was to designate the pro-
ceeds from tonight's SAGA
fast to the Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund.

The Senate had earlier dccir
ded, in Andy Loewi’sabsence,
to give the proceeds to the
Pakistan Relief Fund. Under
pressure from Loewi, how—
ever, they changed their
minds. The incident brought
to question the ability of the
Senate to make intelligent de-
cisions in the absence of Mr.
Loewi, or, perhaps, whether
Mr. Loewi feels the Senate
can make rational decisions
in his absence.

Most SGA activity since that
time has been behind the sce-
nes: the selection of subcomr
mittees for the Student Servi-
ces committee (it's always
good to increase the bureaus
cracy whenever possible), and
selection of student members
for the Freshman Year com‘
mittee, which will determine
the nature of the Freshman
Tutorial program.

The Housing Committee has

been about the onlyactivearm
of the bureaucracy lately. Ch-
airman Ric MacDowell re»
ports that the committee has
been discussing the possibil-
ities of (I) having the room
draw before House President
elections, then havingthe pre-
sidents elected by individual
dorms; (2) making Dibble and
Smith annexes into blocks of
rooms which could be drawn
by groups of students; (3) 31.
lowing juniors to live off-
campus, and (4) expanding the
number ofco-ed dorms, inclu-
ding dorms cored by rooms
rather than by ﬂoors. The re
sults of the recently distribur
ted questionnaire are now be-
ing tabulated by MacDowell at
night, into the weehours ofthe
morning. He hopes to complete
the job before Christmas br'
eak. Little action has been
taken by the committee in the
way of official recommendar
tions. Such activity will pro-
bably wait until next semes-
ter.

Other than that, SGA, like
everyone else these days, is
worrying about suchminiscule
matters as last-minute papers
and final examinations. It
seems that even political 3C,
tivists are realizing that the
most important priority is the
small matter of making your
grades.

GeorgeHarrison Surpasses Paul
And John In Music, Philosophy

by Ron Medvin

”It is not just that George has
surpassed all the individual
disks issued to date by Paul,
John and Ringl. Both music—
ally and philosophically, he
has produced one of the out-
side rock albums in years."
(Time, Nov. 30) This is quite
a statement, but what is more
amazing is that is true] Geo-
rge Harrison‘s new triple 31,
burn is fantastic. It is as if
George sat silently within the
Beatles only waiting to pro-
duce this album. He has sur-
prised many people, for no
one expected that George had
so much talent.

The name of the album is
"All Things Must Pass", and
it contains ls new Harrison

"1C” Will Rise Again

by J.C. Labowitz

(The events that follow, are
true, and only the names have
been changed to protect the
innocent.)

I was sitting in my room last
Friday, meditating as to the
situation in the world today.
when I decided to go'on over
to the post office and pick up
my copy of the Scarlet and
Black. On the way down from
North Campus, Iwent past an
elm tree that was burning but
seemingly was not being con-
sumed. I thought that this was
somewhat strange, but I hur-
ried on to the p.o. When I get
there, I found thatall the mail-
boxes except mine were
smeared with what appeared
to be lamb’s blood. I again
found this strange. I then ope
ened my mailbox and found a
piece of divinity fudge and a
copy of the S and B. Thepaper
seemed to be glowing like a
coal from great heat, yet I
was able to hold onto it with-
out being burned. As I headed
up the stairs, Inoticeda re-
ceipt that had fallen on the
floor, a receipt that was for
thirty pieces of silver paid to

someone named “Enoch Sno-
key".

After reading the paper, I
realized that I was, in a sit
nation that required a little
help from my friends. 501
called together 12 of my f-r’
iends for dinner that night,
and we talked about what was
happening to me.Theyadvised
me to “hang loose".

The next morning I discov-
ered that my mother had arr
rived unexpectedly during the
night. I also had a headache
that was like a weight bearing
down on my head. Igota phone
call from a few of the ROTC
cadets, who insisted that I
come over and play cards or
shoot dice or something. As
I was preparing to leave, I
noticed that the sky was get-
ting very dark, and stormy,
so I took along an umbrella.
Before I left, I wrote this
column so I wouldn't forget
about it and have to have one
of my friends write it for me.
I did want to add one more
thing - I am looking forward
to next semester when I hope
to rise again to new journal-
istic heights.

 

songs, one song written by
Dylan, from his ”New Morn-

whole lyrics are Dylan‘s and

And then there is a two side
jam session with some “see-

Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton,
Dave Mason, Billy Preston,
Bobby Keys, Klaus Voormann

Harrison’s guitar work on
this entire album is excellent.

Presented with the rumr
ors of faculty dismissals
that have been circulating
about campus recently,
Deans Waldo Walker and
Joseph Wall had an identi-
cal reaction: ”no com-
ment.”

Dean Wall explained that
the staffingsituationis still
very much unclear, even
though faculty members
with multiryear contracts
or more than two year's
service must be/ given a
year's notice before they
can be dismissed and those
with singleryear contracts
and two years at the college
must be netified byDecem»
her 1, since those who have
only been here one year
need only be netified by
March 1.

Dean Walker pointed out
that five faculty members
are here this year on one-
year terminating contracts
which expire automatically
at the end of the year. Dean
Wall emphasized thatmany
of this year's dismissals
will come solely due to fin-
ancial reasons. Thcy ex
pected final decisions tobe
reached by the beginning
of second semester.
