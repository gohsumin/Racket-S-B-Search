Once again the Pioneers lead the Midwest Conference
in both team offense and team defense, averaging 356'
yards per game while holding their opponents to 184. Core
nell is second in both departments.

Dick Lamb. who graduated from Grinnell in 1950, is,
the Historian for the National Football Hall of Fame and
probably the foremost football historian in the United
States In lulnmaging' through his 1ecolds he came across
the fact that the first football game played at night withl
ll hts was played on Oct 5, 1900 between Grinnell andl
Drake in Des Moines. Drake won 6- 0.

With their 4 1 1ecord at this point, the Pioneers stand
a chance of compiling one of their best season 1"eco1ds inl
recent history Since 1920, the best Season mark a Pioneer
squad has had was 6-1-1 in 1926. The last si\ games of
that season were a 17- 0 \ictory over Marquette; a 0 0 tie
Vlith Iowa State; Wins over Washington U. -7 to 0,1(ansas-
3281?} 7, and Drake-13 to O; and a 10- 0 defeat by Oklahoma

Michigan State came from behind Saturday to grind
out a 1777 victory over highly touted Notre Dame and
