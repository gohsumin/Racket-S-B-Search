ing its ol‘iglnal tunctions or providing a
“channel for communication among Silk
dent governments" and a “clearing house
for programming suggestions for mem-
ber schools.”

Among the stands apparently taken
by NSA that the committee opposes are
proposals that the House Un-Amerioan
Activities Committee be abolished, that
birth control information be distributed
to migratory wurkers, that student gov-
ernments be encouraged to organize la<
bar unions among agricultural migra.
tory workers, and that universities deny
recognition to fraternities that locally
or nationally engage in “discriminatory
practices." Recently, NSA scored Presi-
dent Johnson's Viet Nam policy and
called for an immediate halt to the
bombing of North Viet Nam.

Grlnnell and NSA

Wittgrai said that there was consid-
eration here two years ago to withdraw
from NSA, but only on the grounds that
we might not have been getting our
money's worth in student services How-
ever, the Senate defeated the proposal.
Grinnell has chosen to put emphasis on
the individual benefits of NSA, such as
loxv»cost insurance and discounts on tra~
vel in Europe. As to the apparent lack
of concern on this campus about the
liberal NSA policy statements, Wittgraf
pointed out that “most people on camp-
us have no idea what NSA stands for,
or that we are even members"

Wittgrat noted that NSA has a better
representation 0! student government

leaders than at students in general, be-

cause those students most active in gov-
ernment are the most likely to take
ﬁrmer political stands,

Dean Goes Along

As Daily pointed out the Court can
only recommend conduct probation He
did indicate, however. that Dean of Men
S. Eugene Thompson has said that ho
would go along with that kind of sug-
gestion.

In another area, Daily said that thero
have been 10 cases in the last four
weeks of men being locked in the log
gia after closing. This, he said, was a
result of the new locking procedure on
South Campus.

Become Routine

Daily said that these cases have he
come so routine that the Court will now
simply send out a notice at apprehen-
slon and fine. The line, of course, is
open to appeal.

The fines for this offense are $10 with
$8.50 suspended for presence of 10 min-
utes or less inside the loggia after hours.
For 11-15 minutes the fine is $10.00 with
$7.50 suspended.

The Court has also opened their ses-
sions to son reporters—unless the per
son on trial requests a closed session.
This is a new policy of the Men’ Pri-
mary Court.
