We WanI In

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The question of student at-
tendance at faculty meetings
remains an active issue on
campus, although no decisions
have been made by the iaculty.
A petition was circulated by
Dan Cheiﬂtz and Mike Brandon
asking that every student be
able to attend the meetings,
drawing signatures troni about
ﬁnerthird of the Student body.

They intend to present this to
the iaculty at the meeting to-
day. (Friday)

Thursday, Brandon along with
Cheifetz who initially present-
ed a proposal to the iaculty,
met with President Leggett to
discuss suggestions to be made
to the executive CounCll, who
will oiier a proposal to the iac-
city.

The four main considerations

tit at a private service that
was requested by ROTC.
President Leggett iirinly
maintains his position on the
“to wear a robe. or not to wear
a lube” controversy. He requests
that all seniors wishing to par—
ticipate in commencement
lhould wear their robesl II they

prefer not to stand last with
tradition, they may receive
their diplomas by mail,

Last year’s anti-robe iaction
eventually turned out to be one
lone crusader who refused to
don his cap and gown. The bac<
calaureate service will include
singing by the choir and some
Words by Reverend Haas. A Ru-
bens Honor Professor will no
longer deliver an address and
this iunction may be assumed
by the President’s medalist in-
stead.

Stripping Through History

By ALLAN HART

The now legendary Grinnell
strippers may have shocked
numerous Iowans and in par-
ticular their elected represcib
tatives, but the actions at
these students were tar irom
revolutionary, and, amazing as
it may seem to the aioremen-
tioned citizens, they certainly
did not set any precedents ior
obscenity or public lewdness.

According to Dr. Wall, strip-
ping is an old torm oi protest.
He pointed out in an interview
that one could certainly con-
sider the nude ride of Lady
Godiva an authentic protest.
Beiore that, during the Protes-
tant Reiormation, a group
known as the Adamites stripped
in church as part or their ritu-
al, They believed in a return to
the simplicity and innocence of
Adam.

Later on, right here in the
very United States at America,
the Quakers, during the seven»
teenth century, protested perse<
cution or their sect hy the Con.
gregatinnalists by stripping in

public, This to them was thﬂ
ideal iorm oi totally non-violent
expression. Two centuries later,
the Abolitionists of the Congre-
gational Church used publid
nudity as a protest of slavery.

It is important to point out
that in those backward times,
the nude protesters were not
punished tor their acts or strip-
ping; some received, though,
prosecution and persecution tor
their beliefs.

Obviously, only in these mod-
ern times has it become clear
that the crime is in the ex«
posure of the human body,
which is clearly dirty and lewd.
not to mention immoral.

In recent times, a religious
group, the Doukhobors of Can<
ada, have been the cause of
problems to authorities. They
believe that the road it) purity
is through stripping and bum-
ing. The real problem there is
the burning: not only do they
burn their own homes, but en<
gage in bombings of other
buildings and automobiles.
However, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police use the Duuk—
hoburs' mass gatherings where
the believers strip en masse as
opportunities to make arrests.

No one is really certain who
{irst originated the idea of
nudity as protest, but one of
the earliest records of such a
demonstration clearly shown
that this obscene bodily ex«
posure was a device at the In-
ternational Jewish Conspiracy.
1n the eighth century before
Christ, the Jewish pmiit isaiah
walked the streets of Jerusa-
lem naked to protest his gov-
ernments military alliance with
surrounding it a ti o n s to said-
guard against the Assyrians!

One can draw numerous an-
alogies with present conspin
aeies to the lewd act of Isaiah.
Once again, we find that the
Jews are behind SDS, There is,
though, one important diiter»
ence between the Grinnell strip-
pers and those of the past. The
Grinnellians' method of protest
was directly symbolic or that
which they were protesting _
a great, free enterprise! So, in
the end, we ﬁnd it is not a real
ditiercnce in protest but rather
the difference between Lhe un-
enlightened governments of the
past and the upright otiicials at
today. And, in the end, we
again find the International
Jewish Conspiracy the root at
