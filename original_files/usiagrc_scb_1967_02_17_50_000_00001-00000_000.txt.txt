loggia lac/(s Termetl Illegal;
Violate Iowa Fire Safety laws

By StaiI Reporters

The 5&3 learned last week
that the locking of the leggia
doors in the women’s dorms on
south campus is a clear vio—

lation of Iowa State iire reg- ‘

ulations.

Wilbur R. Johnson, State Fire
Marshal, told the 5&3 that
all public buildings are re-
quired to have “panic-type ex-
its” and that inside keyed locks
such as those presently used
on south campus, are outlawed
under Section 103.8 at The lowa
Code and under Section 1.2 of
[own State Fire Safety Rules
for Dormitories which reads:

“Exits shall be so arranged
and maintained as to provide
tree and unobstructed egress
from all parts of every build-
ing or structure at all times
when the building or struc-
ture is occupied. No locks or
fastenings to prevent tree es-
cape irom the inside or any
building shall be lnstalled on
exit doors.”

Johnson said that Grinnell
College, according to his re-
ords, has never had a state
tire inspection even though all
schools, colleges and univer-
sities, both public and private,
are required to have one every
two years under Section 10031
of the The Iowa Code.

When asked when Grinnell
College would be inspected John-
son said “Golly, I couldn't tell
you, we want to get it done
as soon as possible The Iowa
law does require them. . . ."

When contacted again this
week Johnson told the 5&3
that his office would conduct
a complete inspection of Grin-
nell College in early March and
the college will be given on
days to correct violations

it was also noted that the
tire escapes oI several of the
women's dorms lead to en-
closed courtyards tram which
there is no escape, Presently,
only housemothers. Buildings
and Grounds employees and
some hall presidents have heys
to the loggia doors.

In 1945 a major tire of “un-
determined origin" swept
through i-iaines Hall basement
causing $5,000 damage, com-
pletely destroying three rooms
and damaging the rest ol the
basement. All occupants of the
basement were in class at the
time or the ﬁres

paigns with plationn speeches Monday attemoon in ARH audi-
torium.

need for greater communication

Faculty Curriculum Committee
Conducts In-Deplh Investigation

By Harold Fuson

The Faculty Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum
has wasted no time since its formation four months ago. Charged
with the task of investigating and evaluating existing educational
policy and programs of the college, the committee has held seven
special Christmas vacation meetings in addition to its regular twice
weekly sessions and, according to Chairman Robert Haveman
(economics), hopes to have its recommendations ready tor faculty
action by the beginning or next semester.

The depth and range of the
committee‘s concerns were evi-
denced by the content of a ques-
tionnaire distributed to all stu<
dents late this week. The ques-
tionnaire sounds out student
opinion on areas ranging from
the role 0! the major field to
the advisability of interdiscipli-
nary seminars and new pro-
grams which focus on contem-
porary problems,

Haveman said the complexity
of the questionnaire was neces»
sitated by “the sincere interest
oi the committee in obtaining a
detailed speciﬁcation oi what
the concerns of the students
are."

Thompson Writes
’01un Sign’
Drug Statement

By Susan Fogg

In an interview after the re
lease of the Deans’ Office state-
ment on “Student Use of
Drugs,” Dean so Eugene Thomp-
son further clarified the college
position on the subject

Dean Thompson, who wrote
and researched the release,
said it was intended neither to
condemn nor condone drug us-
age but to serve as a “caution
Sign" {or students. The col-
lege's position, he Ieels, places
emphasis on the uncertainty and
limited knowledge of the eifects
of drugs on the individual.

Both Thompson and bean
Richard H. Winters stressed
that the-disciplinary aspects

“The committee has ape
preached its task with a broad
View toward what an ideal lib-
eral arts curriculum should look
like,” Haveman said.

“Many oi the proposals being
considered by the committee
are both innovative and experb
mental," Haveman claims. He
emphasized that the thinking of
the committee is still highly
tentative. Yet he continued,
”We are considering proposals
which would substantially
change the direction or educa-
tional policy at the college."

“We have developed a strong
concern about the inability o!
liberal arts colleges in general
and Grinnell in particular to
come to terms with the con-
temporary w o rid,” Haveman
Said. He said the Committee
feels confident that movement
in this direction can take place
at Grinnell,

Among the areas the questiom
naire deals with is the adequacy
of the general requirements of
the college. There is concern
with the committee, Haveman
said, that these courses often
do not "whet the student’s ap-
petite. They iail to stimulate
students to take additional work
in these areas.”

Also on the committee’s mind
is the desirability of offering
academic credit for certain co<
curricular activities. Haveman
mentioned choir and orchestra
as well as additional activities
in the creative arts as possl.
bilities.

The advising system is Ana
other important area of con-
cern, "The present advising

between the student body and
its chosen representatives.

Trip Kennedy

Tlle greatest danger ahead,
said Trip Kennedy, is one of
mounting frustration that stu»
dent ettorts attain no lasting
results. Kennedy believes this
hazard will increase it SGA
presses for immediate revision
of open rooms policy, at the
expense of other programs. He
i'eels that the administration
appears relatively less flexible
on this matter than on others.

A more productive approach,
he maintains, would entail a
“redistribution of SGA em-
phasis;” for instance, more at-
tention should be given to
curriculum planning and
course otterings.

Kennedy proposed that
health center visiting hours
should be established, the li-
brary should be open (or
study on Saturday nights and
the “cut" rule should be re-
vised,

Kennedy would reconsider
the issue of privacy in light of
next year's proposed chin to
ticn or women's hours and in-
trodllction of resident advisers
on South Campus.

He would urge that the dia-
loglle be heightened belwccll
