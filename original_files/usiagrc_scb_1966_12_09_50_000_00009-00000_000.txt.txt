Staging Techniques Effective . . .

Science Prots' Research
. Covers Broad Spectrum

By CHARLES SMITH and ANDY ISAACS

How do Grinnell’s laculty go about fulfilling the college's hopes
that they will devote themselves to scholarly achievement? We
asked the members oi the science departments for this first art-

icle, and the answers were quite
impressive. Virtually every pro-
fessor is engaged in some re
search or writing projects

For example, in the physics
department, Roger Hansen is
currently on leave, experiment-
ing with nuclear specloscopy at
the University of Aarhus in
Denmark. Beryl Clotfelter, the

department head, is studying
conductivity in walls or glass
tubes during electrical dis
charge. He intends to publish
his ﬁndings soon. Bruce Thomas
plans to publish, in conjunction
with the Argonne National Lab-
oratory, a paper on the optical
properties of polystyrenes.
Wayne Denny, having returned
ircm a year in india, is work-
ing on solid state electronics

William Nevill, Chairman of
the chemistry department, has
written a textbook in general
chemistry which will be pub-
lished this winter. He is also
continuing his experiments with
pyrimido (5,4-d)-Dytimidines as
possible anti-carcinogens. Jo-
seph Daniorth, holder or over
thirty patents, is currently in-
vestigating organo—silicon alumi-
num compounds. Luther Erick-
son, with several students, has
been tor the past few years in-
vestigating the interaction of
metal ions with biological signi-
tlcant ligands. Several publica-
tions in nuclear magnetic reson-
ance spectroscopy hear his
name. Jack Swenson, another
patent—holder, is continuing his
studies on the reactions of bro-
momalononitrlle with bases Wil-
liarn Oeike has been studying
the elllects of various cations on
the crystal iormation or sodium
chloride. His laboratory manual
in physical chemistry will be
published soon

in the biology department,
Kenneth Christimsen’s primary
research interest is entomology.
He is currently studying the he-
havioural differences between
dliterent species of Coilembola
(a small arthropod) and the
evolution of some of Collem-
bola‘s cave forms He is also
involved in the revision oi Ne-
arctic members of the genus
Folsomia. Karl T. DeLong is
concerned with vertebrate ec-
ology. He is investigating the
population ecology of rodents,
using laboratory house mice.
Laverns D u r k e e, chairman
of the department and a plant
anatomist, is studying the me-

tory of vegetation since the re«
cession of the Wisconsin glacier
as revealed by the pollen strati-
graphy in hog sediments. lrv~

gans of rats.

Benjamin Graham, Jr., is ina
terested in plant ecology. His
current study is or root grafting
in forest communities. Guiller-
mo Mendoza is investigating
some aspects or the reproduc-
tion process of Goodeidae, vi ‘-
parous lishes from Mexico.
Topics of his research: the cum-
parative structure of the testes,
the eltect of testosterone on the
embryos’ sex traits, the pass-
age or nutrients trom mother
to young during gestation, and
the ultrastructure or the early
eggs. Waldo Walker is on leave,
studying plant physiology at the
University of British Columbia.

ly promising, although hopetul—
1y some rurther reﬁnement
might be achieved in future pro-
ductions. At times the supports
of moving pictures and mllsio

and hurried, leaving an impres-
sion or torced agitation Al-
though the musical score intro-
duces a sense or unreality, its
stark modernity makes tor Ii
certain dissonance when placed
in historical context, While the
disaster of the First World War
was violent, those who ielt its
loss most keenly were, i be-
lieve, struck by the utter final<
ity of the event, the death of a
generation, the passing of a
gentle and balanced era. This
might best be expressed by a
t r a g e d y of understatement,
which the various techniques
should constantly enhance.

remain. For the war laid bare

undirected emotional impera-
tives which the ethical super-
structure ut two thousand yearn

formed, The entire community
of inherited societies and values
was seen to rest on precarious

man was left to seek out some
sort of destiny in a universe of
uncertainty, a world where

Any Grinnell Negro student who

We are seeking an answer to

What is most grieving to us

Sixty-seven pe r cent were

also a tendency for students to
