THE. SCARLET AND BLACK

Following three standinge
room-only performances in
Arena Theater, the theater
department’s experimental
production of "Snow White"
took to the road for eight
additional performances in
the Grinnelerewburg eler
mentary schools. The cast
received a warm welcome fr-
cm the students.

The young audiences aetivee
1y participated in each per-
formance, replying to a char-
acter's question by shouting
in unison or by individually
sharing their comments. Such
an insrance occurred when the
wicked witch, portrayed by
Vickie Lofquist, said, “Snow
White, more pretty than I?
What shall I do?" The imme
diate reply from one childwas,
"Commit suicide."

Other children had choice
pieces of advice to give the
cast. A certain boy tried to
convince Snow White (Jamie
Rosenblatt) not to eat the poir
soned apple. But in spite of
his better judgment,SnowWh-
ite bit into the apple and died.
When Doc, a dwarf played by
Karen Auerbach, announced
the death of Snow White, the
boy said, "I told you so."

The high level of enthusiasm
possessed by the cast helped
bring the imaginary setting to
life, and create an active at-
mosphere between the cast
and audience. The wicked q“,
een played her part so well
that one child tried to annir
hilate her during recess by
throwing a rock at her. Nor
did anyone want to play with
the wicked queen’s mirror,
Deborah Sanden. who was left
to play all alone on the sw;
ings.

The mood of the play, how-
ever, was not only created by
the characters. The dancers,
Elizabeth Copeland, Marilyn
Musser and Maria Perotto,
intervene within the action to
tie the plot together. The mue
sicians, Jim Spell and Greg
Gaines, with their original
score, guitar, and electric
organ also added to the spirit
of the play. Jim Spell’s intro—
ductory songs, die theme song,
and tunes denoting individual
characters excited the young
audience.

The children’s emotionalrer
sponse to the play could be
seen after each performance
as they rushed to dance with
the handsome prince, charaCe
terized by Richard Smith: the
King, played by Ronald Ai; or
Snow White. Other children
showed their enthusiasm by
running for pencils and papa

ers so they could get theautoa
graphs of each of the dwarfs
-- Doc, Sleepy Sneezy, Happy,

Bashful, Dopey and Grumpy,
played by Karen Auerbach,
Jane Friedson, Phyllis Gan-
ser, Jule Kagan, Deni Deut-
sch, Jack Gay and Greg
Gaines, respectively -- and
other members of the cast.
Other reactions to the play
were reﬂected in drawings by
the children. Such works of
art included Snow White, the
Handsome Prince and his
sword, the wicked Queen and
her mirror, the seven dwarfs,
and Jim Spell's guitar. In
short, the response was very
enthusiastic.

Public and college response
has been so good that the cast
of Snow White, under the dira
ection of Don Boros, will per-
form once more in Arena The
eater at 8 RM. Monday.

eign students.)He emphasiz-
es the importance of main—
taining a program flexible err
ough to meet the changing
needs of the Grinnell student
body. The declaration of an
independent major by seven
students at Grinnell is an ex-
ample of the changing needs.
This option has been stated in
the Grinnell catalogue for at
least fifteen years, but no one
had taken the opportunityuntil
this year. It will more im-
portant than ever, in this type
of program that the academic
advisor act as a real coordin-
ator between the various de-
partments involved in the stu*
dent’s major.

 

coming soon

Mr. Obermiller pointed out
that although much has been
said about improving hculty
advising, he feels stu ntsalr
so have the responsi ility to
seek out the help they may
need from whatever source
is of the most help to them.
He sees a lot of room tor im~
provement in the present SyS’
tem, but feels that ithas come
a long way in the past several
years. Realizing that there
will never be a simple cure-
all solution, he hopes that the
program can continue to de-
velop through the concerted
efforts of all involved.
