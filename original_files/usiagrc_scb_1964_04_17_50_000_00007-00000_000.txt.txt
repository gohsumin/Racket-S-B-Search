Baseball Team Splits with Coe:
To Travel to Cornell Tomorrow

The Pioneer varsity baseball
squad split a doubleheader wtth
Coe last Saturday after losing
their opener to Central, 10-1.

The Pioneers traded shutout
victories with the Kohawks, los-
ing the first game, LO, and then
coming back in the second
game to shutout the Kohawks,
3-0.

in the ﬁrst game, the K0-
hawks scored their lone run
in the first inning, on a single
and two Pioneer errors. The

Pioneers had men on base

and in scoring position sev-

eral times during the game
but couldn‘t drive a run in.

Grinnell's D e n n y Hanssen
pitched the whole game for the
Pioneers, giving up six hits and
striking out 11. *

In the second game of the al-
ternoon, Barry M. Anderson
and Cal Collier teamed to shut
out the Kohawks, 3o, giving up
only three hits.

Grinnell dropped its third
game of the season Tuesday to
Simpson, when Simpsm’s Dave
Lansing belted a tenth inning
“Grand Slam” home run to give
the game to Simpson, 10—7.

Grinnell broke a 4-4 tie in the
top of the tentill with three runs.
Simpson then came back with
six runs in the bottom half of
the inning to give them the
game.

 

The Pioneers travel ton-lor-
row to Cornell for a double-
header that is of great impor-
tance to both teams,

If either team can come away
with a sweep, its chances of
challenging defending division
champion Knox for the title
would be enhanced. A split
would knock neither team out of
the chase, but a double loss
would make it hard to rebound.

Probable starters for Coach
John Pfitsch‘s crew will be
Denny Hanssen, the victim of
an unearned run last weekend
that let him lose H), and Bar-
ry Anderson, who combined
with Pfitsch's ace reliefer, Cal
Collier, to throw a Uhree-hit
shutout.

Even with this fine pitch-
ing, Pfitsch still has prob-
lems. “We‘ve got to find a
couple more hitters to help
Collier, Steve Tilly and Dick
Ulrich.

“These three can’t carry all
the load, but have had to thus
far." Last weekend, Collier led
off three innings with either
hits or a walk and then scored
on singles by Tilly and Ulrich.

Possible plate support could
come from Nick Nonas, who
has taken over the catching
chores, or Dave Synhorst, who
appears to be a permanent fix-
ture in left field.

Defeat Knox. MonmouthI ISU

By Andy hushnell

The Grinnell College golt
team made it through the first
week of the golf season unde-
ieated. bringing their string oi
Midwest Conference victories
10 10 in a row.

Last Saturday, the Pioneers
played host to Knox and Mon-
mouth. downing Monmouth, 15-
o. and barely getting past the
Knox Siwash, al/z-oI/z.

Monmouth’s iour top men
combined to outshoot Grinnell's
top four by one point, but Al
Peterson, the fifth men topped
his opponent by five, and the
Pioneers won with four fewer
strokes, 390494.

Dave Sellergren was medalist
With an 18 hole total of 73. Ted
Risser shot a 75, Eric Miller.
77, Russ Hardin 79, and Peter-
son finished with 86. Jim Mi-

chaels and Dave Howland led
Knox with totals of 75.

At Ames on Tuesday, the Pio-
neers ran into “the toughest
course in Iowa," according to
Sellergren, and a strong Iowa
State team. Again, however,
the Grinnell linksters came out
on top, 81/2-61/2 although the to-
tals were not nearly as impres-
Sive.

Seliergren and Risser took
top honors, both carding 79's.
Eric Miller shot an 85, Hardin
took an 88 while Mike Miller
carded a 107, Rick Johnson
