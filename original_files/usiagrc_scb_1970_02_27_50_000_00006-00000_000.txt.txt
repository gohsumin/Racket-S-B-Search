Editorial

Reprinted From The New York Times

The seriousness of New York City’s drug abuse problem and
the utter inadequacy of the governmental response to it have been
demonstrated by a series of developments within the past several
days.

A 17-year-old Barnard College freshman died after inhaling an
overdose of heroin over the weekend. A 17-year-old Brooklyn boy,
an 18»year-old Bronx girl, and a “3-year-old Staten Island boy died
from drug abuse in the city‘s five boroughs last year.

Drug abuse has become more pervasive among the city’s very
young. A deeply addicted 12-yearold girl was found in a narcotics
daze last week and returned to her expensive East Side home. An
11-year-old girl was admitted into the privately run Odyssey Home
rehabilitation program, and an ll-yearmld boy was arrested with
his two companions. ages 13 and 15, on charges of selling heroin.

It is hard to understand why city officials tried for a time to block
the release of statistics sketching the vast dimensions of the drug
abuse problem, or why they have failed to launch a preventive or
rehabilitation program on the scope clearly required. They have,
instead, sought to close down the Bronx Odyssey House, the only
facility in me country devoted solely to the rehabilitation of teen-age
addicts. They summoned Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, director of
the program,iinto criminal court on charges of violating a building
code provision against overcrowding. She faces a jail term.

Neither the city nor the state has made available presently unused
buildings which could be turned into treatment centers to the Odyssey
program or to other private organizations trying desperately to fill
the void created by official inaction. Such action is urgently needed.
The city and state ought to launch educational programs on drugs
to reach youngsters in the lowest school grades. There are probably
100.000 heroin addicts in the city, an estimated one-fourth of them
teenagers. Additional thousands of other youngsters are ex
perimenting with heroin and other dangerous drugs. Preventive
programs require immediate launching. Rehabilitation centers need
to be opened quickly. The Federal Government should help underwrite
city and state efforts in these areas

Mayor Lindsay has so far remained strangely aloof. He provides
for new rehabilitation centers in his capital budget. Governor
Rockefeller recommends further study. For the state to propose
the treatment of 150 teenagers in a pilot project that might get under
way in six months, as Assembly Speaker Duryea proposed last weekI
is for it to continue ignoring the urgency and the dimensions of the
problem.

How many youngsters must die before Government becomes
alarmed? HOW many families of all economic and social strata must
know heartache? Is there within the remote bureaucracy no one
who owns a sense of honest outraze?
