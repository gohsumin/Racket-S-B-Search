Once every so olten in the netherland, beyond the bounds of
ill-ass reality, beautiiul things happen to beautiful people,

Well my sometime beautiful people, sometime beautiiul things
are going to be happening [or you this weekend on our sometime
campusr

Do you feel like getting turned on tonight by something that is
really diiierent, say for instance with balalaika accompaniment?
Then Robert’s Theatre is where you should be at 8 o’clock — and
gaily attired while you’re at it — to set yourself in the mood for
Frula, Yugoslavia’s greatest iolk ensemble which has merited
world-wide acclaiml This fabulous company of thirty-five singers,
dancers, and musicians will be performing over twenty Slavic
ioik pieces.

You might even do some homework before you go: Find am
where vojvodina is located and who the Komitadzi are But most
of all come to see KDSmet, the DANCE OF THE SHIPTARS,
which is a mock fight between rivals for a young lady‘s aliections.

it you don‘t mind having nightmares, and it you do enjoy
superaswift neat type Monster Movies or if you’d just like to im<
press Mr. Parzen with your practical knowledge of genotypic and
phenotypic variations, the Creature From The Black Lagoon is
being shown in ARI-l at 10 pm.

i wonder too how much sexual imagery one can glean from
this classic of horror movies, let alone from the flick's title.

Tomorrow night those of you who really enjoy a quiet interlude
of choral music may treat yourselves to a delightful evening as
the College Choir and the Grinnell Singers with an Orchestral En-
semble will be presenting their first concert of the semester. The
highlight oi the Choir-s pertormance may he Friede auf der Erde
by A. Schoenberg, hut certainly the most delightful pieces will be
three poems of e.e. cumnings set to music by the lather of PDQ.
Bachr

The Grinnell Singers is a madrigal ensemble of 19 members
who will be performing several madrigals from different eras in
cluding Trois Chanson by Debussy and one by a modern com-
poser. The concert is in Herrick Chapel at 8 p.111.

A! 10 p.rn. tomorrow and again on Sunday at 9 p.m., the action
ﬂick MAFIOSO will be shown in ARH’S old auditorium.

Some of you will be able to keep your dimes, nickels, and
quarters from being eaten up as you feed the juke box in North
lounge Beginning at 10 p.rn. Saturday night the juke box will he
tree for its jam session. Remember too that there’s free bowling
this Saturday night

MACE TO FACE
AT U OF UTAH

SALT LAKE ClTY, Utah
(CPA) — MACE, a Chemical
irritant that operates like learn
gas but is shot out of aerosol
cans, has been issued to campus
security oiiicers at the Univer-
sity of Utah.

Campus officials said that use
of the chemical Was intended to
be “purely defensive.” One of
the university’s vice presidents

noted that the MACE is not
generally used to control
crowds, and that an oiﬁcer must
“hit the individual in the face
in order for the Mace to be used
eiiectively.”

The Utah campus police car-
ry only MACE. Security ofﬁcers
at Colorado State University,
however, carry both MACE and
revolvers. The spray has been
used six (lines since the CSU
police began carrying it about
two years ago.
