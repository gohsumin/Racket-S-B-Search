After Halaina had ﬁnished his
speech with a quotation trom
Thomas Paine- “These are the

times that try men's souls," Sen ‘

ale Speaker Cameron Helid

shot called for points of clari

cation, It was conﬁrmed that
the resolution was not a protest
against underground testing but
that it referred to»tests Conduct
ed in the atmosphere only, One
senator called for ,a deﬁnition
of the w ‘l'lloratorlum,’ and
it was decided that the word
should be construed as. ”the
cessation of testing for an un-
determined period' of time."

A further point made was
that this was to be a resolu-
tion of the student Senate,
not of the Student Governc
ment Association as a whole.

Linda Flene stated her views:
in favor of the resolution, say-l
ing that this is an issue that
has been under discussion ior
months, and that she iclt qualk

brought up the point, that al-‘importance or non- lporlance
though this would constitute‘a‘iof protesting the govel’nmelit's‘

ate alone, it would still be
redection.of the views of Gri ,

ple cannot speak for the whole
student body. Al Boston,
agreeing with this view,
that the Senate cannot assume
anything without taking the is—
sue back to the halls,

Priscilla Eidc agreed, stating
that this is a moral issue, on
which there can be no proper
vote unless the Senators know
the moral leelings of their halla
mates. She also raised the point
that the meeting was called
hastily and that the Senators
had not had time to think about
the issue.

Halama responded to these
objections by repeating the {act
that the i'esolulion would be an
action of the Senate and not,
the school, thzil: it was perfectly
proper and in keeping With [are
moi‘ precedent for the Senate
to Iollow such a course of ac-

important that the, Senate act

quickly, betore the government
took action. “If we postpone
this action," he said, "it may
be too late.”
