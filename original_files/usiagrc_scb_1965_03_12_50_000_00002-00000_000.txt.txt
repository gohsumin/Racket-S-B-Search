Cleaver: Ship 'Em Back Theory
Mighl' Well Work Both Ways

To the Edito '

A rough and rapid content analye
ll: of the last 5&3 discloses that
the most urgent question confront-
ing this community at scholars is
student government. 1 wish to
wmmend one student, however,
who seems to have got hold of I
matter that is also rather impor-
tant: race relations,

l refer to a letter by a student
who expresses his earnest desire
that I. fellow student could be
lhipped back to Africa, inasmuch
as the latter finds disagreeable
present arrangements for the Ne-
gro in the United States. I admire
the letter writer’s capacity to see
beyond the affairs of the parish;
but I would quibble with him at a
couple of points.

First, the student he refers to is
not from Africa, but from New
York, New York; nevertheless, the
suggestion that he change his
home is of the some order or gene
erosity as that tendered to his an-
cestors in Africa a century and a
half ago.

Second, although he is correct
in noticing that the white "popu-
lar majority” has generally been
able to “enforce r . , reason” (as
it has deﬁned reason) on its “pig-
mented iriends," he might not
have noticed a current theory that
the form that reason takes might
sometimes be questionable

For example, it is pointed out
by those who hold to this theory
that the popular majority has de~
Cliled (l) to guarantee the right to
vote to all citizens regardless of
race, creed, or previous condition
of servitude; and (Z) to use state
troopers, horses, sheriffs, police
dogs, hilly clubs, dirty jokes, ser-
mons, curses, tear gas, economic
pressure, whips, eniorced illiter-
acy, hiizzings by automobiles, orv
gunized humiliation, fire, fire
hoses, spit, intimidation and vio-
lence against children, law, iron
chains used as lashes, bombs, bul-

letters to the editorr If a writ-
er wishes his name to be
withheld [ram pubiicntion, he
should place his letter in box

Although the 5&3 attempts
to use every legitimate let-
ter, we reserve the right to

lets, brick-bats (the list is partial
and merely suggestive) to prevent
Negro citizens from voting.
Perhaps this is why the popular

majority seems so curiously un-
popular in Selma these days,
mough no doubt people should ac-
cept such everyday irritations in
good grace. But, perhaps also we
of the white majority ought not to
be surprised if some logic—chop-
pers find such an allegedly contra.
dictory pair of decisions puzzling

To the Editor:

Mr. Wolf should he applaud—
ed for his penetrating analysis
of the FCSA. He has a pai‘ticw
larly keen awareness or jus-
tice, indicated by his assump-
tion that surely one adminisv
trator, involved directly with
inter 'ewing students and de-
termi ng the necessity of dis-
cipline, is best qualified to
view the evidence and assign
a penalty. We should also ap»
preoiate Mrr Wolf's journalis»
tic openrml’ndedness and hue
mility in assuming: 1) That
anyone interested in student
affairs (particularly faculty
members) must subscribe tn
the Scarlet and Black; 2) If
any college organization is to
function properly it must in
form the 5&3 of all its activi-
ties. preferably by means of a
personal interview, When you
consider the fact. that the
FCSA has had only token re-
sponsibil ‘es in the past few
months, this latter request
seems quite reasonable,

Finally we must commend
Mr. Wolf for his democratic
separation of powers at Grin.
nell. The administration must
punish, the faculty must teach
and certainly the students‘ only
role is to passively accept the
products of both, Obviously we

Miss Herman Questions Grinnell's ‘liberal' Position

To the Editor:

It has become more and
more apparent to me in the
past few months the distance
and lack of sensitivity that the
students of this “liberal" in-
stitution have toward the real
goal of the Negro in American
society and in particular the
problem on this campus,

There is an assumption here
that we are all concerned and
sensitive to the sufferings of a
large body of our population,
and so the attempt is made at
Grinnell by “assimilation" and
“inclusion” to show that we
care about them as persons.
The problem to which I'm ree
ferring is manifested in a very
subtle attitude by the way in
which students try to achieve
this end of “assimilation" and
“inclusion"

Last week Doug McCormac
expressed this feeling overtly,
but for the most part. I think
this attitude is an unconscious
one. The fact is that we all
have become so aware of the
general problem >— it is some
thing which hits us in the face
everyday - that it is very
very hard to get away from the
externals. By this I mean that
it becomes extremely difficult
to forget that one is relating
to a Negro and accept him
solely as the person that he is.
When this happens, people be-
come overly conscious of their
positions and tend to exag-
gerate their "liberalism" in a
subtle benevolence which be-
comes paternalistic and con-
descending. This kind of utr

Quad Protected by
lights, Watchmen

The Quad has received in.
creased protection in recent
weeks following several cases
of stealing and reports of
prowlers around south cam-
pus.

Lighting to the east end
west of the quad has been in-
creased in intensity. Accord.
ing to Evan Walden, director
of the physical plant, a new
permanent lighting system
will be inslalled soon so that
"prowlers can be detected,"

Walden said that there have
been reports of several prowl.
ers and that the lighting is de~
signed to discourage these peo—
ple, “especially the youngsters
from town."

In another move to secure

the quad from outside entry, _

B&G has cut down the tree on

the norm end of the loggia '

which a student used to Climb
to the loggia roof in two recent
quad break-ins. Walden said
the tree "had been under sus-
picion {or quite awhile because
several branches were broken;
it wasn't any good, anyway, so
we took it out.”

Also, a second night watchv
man has been assigned to the
quad patrol for the past two or
three weeks. According to
Walden. a second night Watch-
man is "used now and then"
when the situation merits it,

 

titude is the most profound at-
front to human dignity that
exists.

On this campus, this attitude
has made itself felt so strongly
that the Negroes have respond-
ed in some cases with justified
disdain and in others with
heart-rending apology. An in
cident occurred very recently
where a Negro felt obliged to
make two other students aware
oi her presence because she
happened to be overbearing a
conversation in which she felt
something might be said to
hurt her and that she did. not
want to hear. When confronted
by the students and assured
that they were in full sympathy
with her situation, she said,
“Well, I just don’t know who

to believe anymore. When I
first heard about this place, it
was supposed to be so wonder-
ful. But since I've been here,
so many things have happened
and that letter Friday just
made me cry. 1 just wish 1
could make people understand
that I can’t help that my skin
is dar .”

Here, at Grinnell College,
someone has to apologize for
what they are — for what they
cannot help. How reassuring
we must be — how manifestly
we must show our respect for
people as individuals — for hu-
man dignity. I think some seri-
ous questioning must be done
by each one into the_basis for
his assumed “liberal" positionr

McCormac Slates He Is Misunderstood;
Racial Problem Not All Black and White

To the Editor:

Perhaps. I am an intemper-
et- racist. as condemning
brown have accused me. I
have to admit that if all colored
people were ushered to some
remote corner. the racial sit-
uation would be ideal in Amer-
icar

Likewise, however, Aristotle’s
logic compels me to admit that

if the whites were purged from '

the earth. a similar ease and

welcome peace would ensue—l

an ideal state so novel that
Plato could not recognize it.
