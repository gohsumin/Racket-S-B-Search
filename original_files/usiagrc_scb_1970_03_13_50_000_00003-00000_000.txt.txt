Theater Dance Group Presents
Outstandingly Unified Performance

By RONNIE FULTON

Last Friday and Saturday night
ili Roberts Theater, the' Grinnell
community was treated to an
evening ot excellent dance and
some very good choreography by
the Theater Dance Group, for
inerly known as Orchesis. The
varied program provided an ex-
citingshow for theaudience,

The Theater Dance Group. as
compared with last year‘s group,
has learned to work and dance
as a group. A college dance group
with only a few good dancers
could not have prowded such a
diversified program, The pres
ence of so many new males in
-the performance, noted with
great pleasure, is one factor re-
sponsible for a more cohesive
group,

The first half of the program
was choreographed primarily by
students, “Organic,“ choreo-
graphed by Giti Zarnegar, was
one of the best attempts. The out
standing piece of student
choreography was ”Street Peo-
pie,” danced to music by Cop-
land. and choreographed by Dick
Hartz, Harlz obviously has potenr
tial as a choreographer, In this
number he managed to create
humorous character sketches of
street vendors and young cou-

ples. He knows how to shift the
audience‘s attention from cou-

pla, to individuals, to the group.
The simplicity of the dramatic
elements in this piece made the
story easily understood. Another
student piece, “Character Stud-
ies From Theater,“ would have
profited from a less complicated
plot.

l-lartz’ other example of
choreography was his solo,
“David at Gilboa.” This short,
simple number succeeded in
creating a mood of nobility. Hartz
began the piece with very simple
movements which he later de-
veloped The shadow of his figure
playing on the back wall added
an excellent touch.

Ofall the pieces choreographed
by Mrs. Voertman, “Gnossiena
nes," “Full Circle,” and “The
Last Flower” were most success-
ful “The Last Flower” contained
more acting than dance; how
ever, the audience seemed to
enjoy the humor of the group's
portrayal of such things as rab-
bits and subways. In “Full Cir-
cle,” the story of the jealousies
of two women and a man, Mrs.
Voertman displayed her ability
to combine the serious and the
comic. Nina Seidenman was an

<t‘ser's political

excellent choice for the female
rolc opposite Mrs. Voertman. The
contrast in the shapes of their
bodies and their facial features
complemented the theme of the
struggle between the two women.
“Gnussiennes,” danced by Jenny
Butcher, Elly Dayton, and Sue
Seeder, was one of the most
beautiful numbers in the
program, In this piece Mrs.
Voertmari created a simplicity of
movement, tastefully begun and
resolved. The gracefulness of the
dance was reminiscent of the
style of Martha Graham.

The audience thoroughly en-
joyed the performance. This re-
viewer hopes to See the Theater
Dance Group retain its cohesive
character, and to see Dick Hartz
continue with his ambitious
choreography. Mrs Voertman is
to be commended for her choreo-
graphic ability and her ability to
teach dancers to change thought
into the movement of one body.

LETTERS—
Continued from page 2

Mr. Nasser dictated his own
headline: The Battle of Algiers:
Blueprint for a Revolution.” Mr.
Klein, fighting on my side for the
moment, effectively showed that
Mr. Nasser was guilty of
fallacious historical parallels —
a charge admitted by Mr. Nasser
in his subsequent letter, where
he confessed that his language
had been ”ambiguous.” We know
what“ambiguous” means in such

tts academic jargon
for ”I blew it.”

Such was the only “substantive
contention”i in Mr. Nasser's
article; left over were some
rather chiechi insights (e.g.,

“‘Battle’ has actors, but no act-'
,ing.") and the presuppositions

which underlay Mr. Nas»
philosophy. It
was to these presuppositions that
I addressed myself in my letter.
To the second charge I reply
that I in no way advocate any
kind of institutional or legal
action againstMr. Nasser. Milton
has truly observed that, in a fair
fight, truth will always triumph.
Now despite the unpleasant
names’ which my critics have
called me, however, I do not think
them guilty of bad motives. So
far as I am concerned, they are
men of good will, and I would
ask them to forgive any errors
in tone I may have committed
as I torgive them for their
mistaken attribution to me OI ill

Danny Cox
Sings Again

By NADA MANGIALE’I‘TI

In his third Grinncll ape
pearance last Saturday night,
Danny Cox was again enthusi—
astically applauded for another
fine performance. In the past
year, this campus has seen some
of the folk muste world’s better
flat-pickers. singlerstrlng experts
and three-finger banjo pickers,
but Cox‘ guitar style is the
epitome of three~finger guitar
work. His clean, hard. accurate
picking and masterful familiarity
with the fingerboard reflects his
classical training. The most imr
pressive quality about his unique
style is the apparent. ray-Alps:
ease with which he‘llips off delir
cate trills, harpsichordial
moi-dents and incredible intricate
runs. Cox's voice, big and
resonant to begin with, filled up
the room even more as time went
on.

Cox’s popularity at Grinnell may
also be attributed to his unpre-
tentious manner, warm person~
ality, and quiet humor. He is
perTéctly at home in front ot an
audience and obviously enjoys
himself, with the result that the
audience can do none other than
enjoy him.

will.

To the third charge I reply
uiat, in answering Mr. Nasserls
review, I used such rhetorical
gifts as I possess, one of which
is satire. That I felt the kind of
saeva indignatio which moved
Juvenal to satirize Roman folly
Iadmit‘, but satire is a legitimate
means of exposing folly, whether
criminal, moral, or intellectual
7 and at least to the last of these
Mr. Nasser’s review is liable. If
I was unduly harsh, that is the
result of bad art, not ill will. It
is my hope that Mr. Nasser, who

Pollution launt/ Power
Plan Preoccupy Senate

By Tom GREENFIELD

Things have been different
around lhc 5&8 office since the
publication of last week's vicious
editorial on the coffee house. En-
raged readers have vandalized
the office equipment, fire~
bombed Fullon's car, and stolen
Gel‘son’s Cliff Notes to The
Poetics.

Deleated and battle weary, the
editors ordered all of their
controversial writers to cut down
all their biting wit and brilliant
satire, in order to sateguard the
other members of the start, I be
lieve that, in this week's column,
I have succeeded beyond their
WlldeSL expectations.

This wcck’s Senate meeting

awaited student power position

has an engaging manner, will
have a long and good career. Had
he kept his views private, I would
never have censured him, for
such is not my habit, Once he
exposed himself to public
criticism, he became eligible for
public criticism. Eligibility
necessarily carries with it the

possibility of damnation.

The philosophy contained with
in the paper skillfully combines
the dialectic of Karl Marx with
the psychological insights of
lieiiiiy Youngman (for example,
“lecli that a Grinncll student
\Vctls Tyrone Power, we then find
that we have Grinnell Student
Power”)

After earth shattering dis-
cussion on the paper, Frank
Thomas announced that two
Grililicll students could ltave the
opportunity to go to an ecology
conference in Buck Hills, Penn»
sylvania, on March ZarApril i.
The conference will Ieature R.
Buckminster Fuller and Barry
Commoner. Frank noted that
Buck Hills. Pa. was selected for
this antirpollution meeting
because of its strategic location.
It is 10 miles from South New
Jersey 7 Gateway to exotic
North Philadelphia. Students are
urged to go see South New Jersey
so that they can learn where it’s
atcrudwise.

The Senate rejected a motion
to wish all of its constituents a
happy vacation on the grounds
that it might get hassled in the
Student Affairs Committee. The
senators were sure that everyone
would understand.
