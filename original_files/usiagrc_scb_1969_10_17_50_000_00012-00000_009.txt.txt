Slim spoke again and protested dis—
crimination in hiring policies for
skilled jobs. "When this plant open—
ed, it was established that white guys
got skilled jobs and black workers
got unskilled jobs —- and the union
didn‘t do nothing against it then and
it hasn‘t done nothing yet."

Jake added, "You Can die with the
white man in Vietnam, but you can't
work with him in this plant."

A speaker from the Buffalo, N.Y.,
Chevrolet plant spoke of the strength
in a worker—student alliance. "What
happens when kids meet up with the
pigs — people generally get messed
up. But when 700 workers are standing
across the street shouting "0n strike,
shut it down," the pigs don't mess
with nobody." He was referring to a
recent strike at the Buffalo plant.

The group then sang "Solidarity
Forever," a traditional union song,
and then peacefully dispersed.

Dunn reported that police had done "an
excellent job" in controlling SDS demon—
strators.

After the callup, Dunn told newsmen
that the guardsmen, on readiness alert
in six armories, would be called out
"only on the request of civil author—
ities . "

Earlier in the day Mayor Daley held
a press conference at which he condemned
the "senseless and vicious behavior"
of the Wednesday night demonstrators.
Daley lauded the police, whom he said
"manifested the highest dedication to
duty and professional conduct when, in
the face of great personal danger,
they preserved and protected the rights
of our citizens."

Commenting on the women's action,
Daley said police did "what I think
they should do." "No one should be
pennitted to march and walk through
the streets with clubs and chains

On Thursday, Gov. Richard B.
Ogilvie announced that 2,633 National
Guardsmen were being called to Chicago
to back upfnlice officers. >0gilvie
termed the call—up a "precautionary
move."

Police Superintendant James B.
Conlisk asked Mayor Daley to request
the guard after Wednesday night's
Weatherman action. Ogilvie disclosed,
however, that he had been contacted
as early as Tuesday by Daley concerning
the call—up possibility.

Conlisk apparently feared police
ranks would be thinned by the necessity
to station precautionary forces at area
high schools. He said "we have the
potential for problems in the schools"
until the SDS demonstrations end.

"When they are carrying clubs and

When asked about police preparations
for the Wednesday night action, Daley

run in all different directions?"

Thursday night the Weathermen had

scheduled a "Wargasm" rally in Lin—
coln Park. The rally never came off.

> There was, however, a crowd of about

1,000 in the park consisting of de—
tectives, plainclothes police, news—

' men, and "riot watchers."

Several individuals were arrested
for "refusing to obey police orders."
One youth was arrested when police
found several new bricks in the trunk
of his car. He told police the bricks
were intended for a bookshelf. Thgy
were not convinced. Several people
were also arrested after police iden—
tified them as having participated in
the Wednesday fighting. The park
cleared when heavy rains fell later in
the evening.

Meanwhile, over 200 Weathermen and
national leaders gathered at Garret
Theological Seminary in Evanston for
a “strategy session." The group
discussed actions that had taken place
and laid plans for Friday and Saturday.
While the Weathermen met in Evanston
police attempted to gain entry to the
'McCormick movement center. They were
kept out by Weathermen security guards.

As the meeting at Garret began,
leaders from the national office asked
for comments and criticisms on actions
so far. This opened what was to be a
more than six hour meeting.

Much of the resultant criticism was
levelled at the national leadership,
the Weather Bureau. Demonstrators
said that they felt the leadership
did not have enough confidence in
them. Specifically, it was pointed
out that almost no one know exactly
what was to happen Wednesday night.
This included the affinity group
leaders who were expected to keep their
groups together and direct them in the
action.

The group also complained that they
should have had an opportunity to dis—
cuss the tactics with the leaders be—
fore the action began, as several had
reservations as to whether the action
was a proper one.

It was mentioned that national
leadership had shown up late at both
the Wednesday night rally and the
women's action. It was felt that this
furthered the disorganization and dis—
oriented atmosphere of the actions.

Demonstrators discussed the fact
that in Wednesday night's fight, the
leadership contingent had broken through
the police lines, but when others did
not follow, the main group was cut off.
Students said that this was in part
due to the fact that leaders had not
prepared the group for what was expect—
ed and in the confrontation situation
people were not sufficiently organized
to follow through.

The Weather Bureau acknowledged that
a number of mistakes had been made. They
pointed out, however, that the entire
concept of "offensive action” was a new
one, having been developed only in the
four months since the summer SDS
conference.

The leaders explained the secrecy
in terms of needed security and point—
ed to the apparent surprise on the part
of police officers at Wednesday‘s
actions. By keeping plans secret, the
Weather Bureau said, the group was able
to catch the police off guard. This
is in marked contrast to previous rad-
ical actions when police have been
thoroughly prepared for militant actions.
