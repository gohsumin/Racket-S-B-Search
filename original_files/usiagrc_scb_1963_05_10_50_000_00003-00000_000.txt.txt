“Grinnell is justly proud of
her trees. The airman scarcely
sees the houses as he goes over
on a summer day. You don‘t see
them yourself from the neigh—
boring high spots when you’re
out for a drive. You see only a
beautitul grove. But you know
from the old stories that when
the first settlers came there was
not a tree in sight. When
Brother Matlack says the Pict-
neers climbed a tree the coun-
try for to see, he means just
atter they swam the ‘Missls»
sippi.’ It was not so at Crinnell,

,It is sztid that a small willow

ISchool of Music. We have to
thank the pioneers for all or our
fruit and shade.”

H. S. Conard, professor emeri—
tus of biology. wrote this of the
trees at Grinnell
ago, It was through his efforts
and those of his predecessors
that the college came to have
the trccs on campus,

“Grinnell is well endowed
with a remarkable variety of
trees,” remarked BenjaminGra-
ham (biology). “There are ap-
proximately 100 species on cam—
pus"

“Identification may be aided
by a key to Iowa plants pre—
pared by Dr. Conard. It consists
of a series of mutually exclu-
sive pairs of characteristics,
such as monocot and dicot. You
eliminate on down until you
reach the species. Some vari»
eties on campus have not been
ilabelcd because we will have
to wait until they leaf out or
tlower before we can identify
them specifically,” said Gra—
ham.

He continued, “We have sev-
lel‘al trees of particular interest
§on campus here. For example,

I made the discovery not long

coffee tree right behind the in-l

and was introduced to Iowa as
wild life food.”

Cervene I'o go

+0 Arl- Camp

Richard Cervene (art) has
been invited to be a guest this
summer at YADDo, a working
community ior artists and wit-
ers, lrom July 5 to September

:5. Yaddo is an estate endowed
by Spencer and- Katrina Trask

located near Saratoga Springs,
New York

Many authors artists and mu-
sicians were invited as g‘uests
to the Trask mansion, built in
1893, and a number of poems,
plays, and musical compositions
were written there. Since the
estate seemed wellsuited to
artistic activity the Trasks dEA
cided to maintain this atmos»
phere atter their deaths through
the Corporation of Yaddo.

This plan was put into opera-
tion in the summer of 1926 and
has continued each summer
since that year. Invitations for
a summer residency at Yaddo
are issued to those artists who
have reached protessional level
of achievement.
