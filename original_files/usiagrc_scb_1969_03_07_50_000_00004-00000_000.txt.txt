Apathy Solution Offered
To the Editor:

In recent weeks our college community
has been discussing the problem of stu-
dent apathy. This discussion reached its
pinnacle at last week's open senate
meeting; however, few constructive
ideas were presented. If students are
going to break out of this stifling apathy,
they will have to do it themselves, I
do not feel that the faculty through
sweeping curriculum changes, or student
government however sterling the lead-
ership, can adequately combat the prob-
lem. In order to find an answer to this
problem, other alternatives must be ex-
plored.

in discussing this problem with varl<
ous faculty members, administrators,
and students, I have reached several
conclusions. Many students who are dis-
satisfied with the academic Side of the
college withdraw into their bacchanalian
oriented hall life, They accept the edu-
cation that is given them, rather than
criticizing that education and asking:
what am 1 paying $3300 a year for?
Little effort is made to relate the stu-
dents‘ education to their own lives and
the world in general.

Therefore, i propose a purposeful hall
existence, centering around a student
awareness of his education and all of
its applications. An example or this type
of hall life would be a hall composed of
heterogenous people with diverse views,
making a unified attempt to use their
education to better understand and cope
with problems, both here and outside
of Grinnell. A program to implement
this proposal might include activities
such as: (1) a freshman program de-
signed to immediately instill into the
new student a sense of purpose in his
education, through increased interest by
upperrclassmen in the new student’s in-
tellectual development, (2) formal and
informal discussions Wlthin the hall
dealing with contemporary problems.
(ll) regularly scheduled formal and in-
formal discussions with professors speak-
ing to specific topics rather than Grin-
nell in general. (4) the use of hall funds
to obtain films and outside speakers.

Lately, there has been an overabun-
dance of unproductive rhetoric. Here is
a viable proposal which can be easily
implemented. Any constructive ideas or
criticisms would be greatly appreciated.

The Confession of Daniel Che
As Transcribed

'(The following document was found
under a bowl of jello in the Quad.)

On Sept. 1, 1965, I parachuted into a
corn field just outside of Gl‘innell. At
that time my only subversive material
consisted of one can of rotten tuna fish,
one pair of sunglasses, and two old
socks suitable for threatening. Since that
time my revolutionary stockpile has
grown to tremendous size and the smell
of tuna ﬁsh reigns supreme As the pos—
sibillty of meaningful revolution has in
recent weeks increased to immeasur-
able proportions, my anxiety over past
misdeeds has led to many sleepless
nights. It is therefore because of my
extreme guilt that 1 confess:

I do hereby confess that it was I who
was responsible tor the rain during the
1957 graduation ceremonies; it was I
who paid off the Grinnell basket-
ball team; it was I who designed the
swimming pool; it was I who posed as
a public relations expert and sold the
idea or the new gym to iaculty and ad.
ministration, and yes, I must hereby
admit, it was I who was directly respon-
sible for the referendum to abolish stu-
dent government.

After receiving my orders from Fe-
king, 1 manipulated the already estab-
lished and booming SDS chapter to
make over the student senate. After two
years or ground work I tinally achieved
my aims; students flocked t0 SDS in
hopes of ﬁnding a haven from that ter-
rible jazz music which pleases the sav-
age tastes of Gary Giddins. (It was I
who corrupted these musical tastes of
this innocent young student.)

I know that! have done terrible things
and I now repent for my past acts. I am
indebted to that brilliantly, perceptive,
concervative (7) student who, during
last Thursday’s senate meeting, re-
vealed the senate conspiracy. I am, be
have me, truly sorry for what I have
done. i know, now. that having con-
fessed my terrible deeds, Grinnell chm~
pus will return, after four long and
hard years, to a normal college environ-
ment tree of outside agitation.

Forever yours,
Dan

Seniors Unrealisiic About Draft

Several members of the Grinnell Draft
Information Center inteerewed a few
male students about the draft and the ef—
iect it is having on their thoughts and
lives. We didn’t conduct a study — just
twelve interviews with twelve students,
but some insights into how most Gritt-
nell students are thinking of handling the
draft can be gained.

The draft weighs heavily on most
men’s minds, when they think about it,
but in the way that most of us handle
constant problems, they seemed to avoid
thinking about it realistically or tried
to treat it as lightly as possible.

Most students are uptight enough about
the Army that they are willing to seal:
special deierments beyond the 11-3 rath‘
er than accept their induction easily.
Out of the twelve, whose political atti-
tudes seemed to cover a iairly broad
range, three were hoping for physical
defennents, two were going to apply for
Conscientious Objector’s status, one was
going to medical school, one to the
Peace Corps, one was planning on
Canada before he’d accept the Army.
one preferred to enlist, and the other
two were very indeﬁnite about their
plans.

What most people need to reallze, from
a Counselor's viewpoint, is I) that many
of the deferments people are seeking
are not mandatory — that things like the
Peace Corps are not necessarily defer-
oble, and 2) that records that quality
a person for most of these determents
need to be built up over a period of time.
last minute filing for co. status is very
risky; likewise, relying on the physical
exams at the induction center probably
won’t win anyone a IV-F physical or
mental deferment.

Documentation for physical and men-
tal cases should be built up over B nun)»
ber of years and it may take time to
contact all your old doctors and have
them send copies of your files. C. or
terms need to show some history oi
some religious training and thought that
has led to your belief. All this takes some
careful consideration over several
months’ time.

It's sad that the weight of proving you
don’t want to hilt people or have any-
thing to do with an institution whose big-
gest business is killing, lies with the in-
dividual. The task of seeking counsel-
ling, learning the regulations on your life,
paying for lawyers, and of course, bear-
ing the mental burden, lies with the per-
son who doesn't want to kill any Viet-
namese or support anyone in that
‘duty." The law requires that men par-
ticipate in these activities, and there is
little hope for that law being changed in
time for this group oi Grinnell students
to legally escape that participation.

A lot of work must. be done by those
