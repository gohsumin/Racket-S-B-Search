Student Draft Representative
Seeks Revamping Proposals

3y NEIL FISCHER

The mold-like Johnson bureaucracy reached a way-
ward tentacle onto the campus Saturday, October 1, with

the visit of a representative

of the President‘s new Na-

tional Advisory Commission on Selective Service.

Clifford C. Behnke, one of
Illne student representatives or
the commission in the entire na»
tion, interviewed twenty Grin-
nell students — chosen at ran-
dom —- concerning possible
changes in the Selective Serv-
tce System. Behnke, a Univer-
lity of Wisconsin student and
iormer editor of the Daily Car-
tlinal, emphasized that he was
not here to “take a poll" but
rather to “sound out represem
tative students at radically dif-
fering institutions (or higher
bducation."

Each of the nine student rep-
resentatives, explained Behnke,
question: I number or typical
ltudents on each of four cam-
puses differing significantly in
their educational format. Behm
ke‘s four schools include a small
liberal arts college (Grinnell),
a junior college (Flint Commu-
nity, Flint, Michigan), a church
affiliated university (Creighton
Omaha, Nebraska). and a gar-
gantuan state school (Behnke's
own University of Wisconsin at
Madisonl

Revamplng

Grinnell students were infor.
molly quizzed consenting a mul-
titude of phases of the draft
system — from their opinions
of a possible “lottery" to their
ideas on conscription as a
whole, Those interviewed were
then asked to verbalize any oi
their own proposals on revamp-
ing the system.

Behnke and the eight other
students — representing the
University of Wisconsin, Clark
College. Vanderbilt, Cornell Uni<
versity, the University of in
diana, the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, Yale, the
University of Washington at
Seattle, and Southwest Texas
State College (LBJ’s alma ma-
ter) — will meet with the ac-
tual members of the National
Advisory Commission on Octo-
ber 31. Behnke and his iellow ('3
student representatives are not
commission members, but only
report to the commission itself
which will draft a full report to
reach President Johnson on or
about January 1, 1961,

Duft Proposal

The President drafted the pr0<
posal organizing the National
Advisory Commission on Selec-
tive Service — Executive Order
11289 — on July 2, “Whereas
Since the days of the militia it
has been the tradition of our
nation that we entrust its de—
fense not just to a standing
army but to all citizens," it be»
gins, “it is appropriate Lhat the
. . . Government calls its cili-
lens from different walks 0!
life . . ."

Members of the new commis-
lion number twenty, and in-
clude such diverse notables as
Kingman Brewster .lr. (Chan-
cellor of Yale), Warren Wood-
ward (Vice-President of Ameri-
can Airlines). F. R. Simeone
(Professor or Surgery at West-
ern Reserve). Oveta Hobby
(editor oi the Houston P051).
and the Rev, John Murray (a
Jesuit). Chairman of the Na-

 

tional Advisory Commission is
Negro Burke Marshall, iormer
Assistant v.5. Attorney General
and now Vice President of IBM.

President Johnson first Vocal-
ized his idea of the commission
on August 13, 1966 beiore a
group at youthful federal gov-
ernment summer interns. “We
are not interested in lust a
system," he drawled. "What we
do want and need is a just sys<
tern."

Profs Discuss Realism In Foreign Policy

Wednesday in the South
Lounge James Mageo (pol. sci.)
and Alan J o n e a (history)
agreed, with varying emphasis,
that us. ioreign policy should
conform more to international
reality. They. along with William
Pollak (86011.), discussed till!
year’s debate club topic: “Re-
solved: That the US. should
substantially reduce its foreign
policy commitments." About 150
students and faculty weio pres-
ent,

Jones, in an historical sketch
of US. foreign policy. con-
cluded that America's past
sense of mission and moral ub-
solutism leads its policy to mili-
tary solutions, “There is a con-
nectiun," he said, “between
this moralistic tradition and our
military posture in the world."
The US, thus overcommlts it«

own past." he said, “is a curse,
a kind of barrier, for under-
standing the world and making
reasonable policy commitments.
Even in our best moments —
and in Wilson’s and Franklin
Roosevelt's policies there is a
certain nobility — there was a
patronizing. sell-righteousness
toward the world.”

This “twentieth century more
at imperialism," Jones said, is
especially evident after World
War II when "there was no dis-
criminatlon over the kinds of
commitment."
lutism against communism was
the sole determining iactor for
policy, and so the US. allied
itself with France, Trujillo, and
Diem, among others. Under
Kennedy there was a respite in
which the US. showed u “dis<

criminating sense of the use of
power."

“But," said Jones, "much of
that has ended with Kennedy'l
death. We have an extension of
military commitments tar be-
yond anything the Republicans
in the ’50: considered. We have
an unprecedented commitment
in a land War and a revival of
moral rhetoric. Despite a lim-
