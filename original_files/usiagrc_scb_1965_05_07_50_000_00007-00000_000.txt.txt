Aboriginal Music
Topic of lecture

By Sue Barquist
Dr. Richard A. Waterman, an
ethnomusicologist at Wayne State
University, recently gave a lec-
ture entitled “Music in the Life of

the Australian Aborigine."
Dr. Waterman is both a distin-
guished anthropologist and profes-
sional musician (as amply demon-

strated in a Langan basement jam.

session with the jug band).

Waterman said that music's
main function for aborigine is to
hold the society on its own par
ticular path of life. The music life
cycle begins with women’s cert!»
monial wailing at birth. followed
by children's songs of the same
sort. Children sing when playing
games, etc. These songs teach chil-
dren about their environment and
help them learn to speak.

As the child begins to observe
the ceremonies of the group he be-
comes familiar with Karma songs.
These simple songs are history
and religious lessons, as they are
about hunting, ancestors, and cus-
toms.

Another group or songs includes
those song for pure entertainment
purposes by the bachelors in the
group. They are simple and ac-
companied by much clowning.

Other categories include men's
sacred songs and women’s wailing
rind general, multipurpose. magi-
cal chants.

The entire audience felt an im»
mediate admiration for the abori-
gine when Waterman explained
that planning ahead is looked up-
on as wrong trom their ethical
Viewpoint. They do not grow or
store food and do not even build
shelters for the wet season until
alter it has started to rain.

prediction after the way they

was close was just before the

Keep in mind, 1M jocks, that
this Sunday is Mother’s Day. It
has occurred to me that we
really ought to do something
special for this Mother's Day.
What do you say we invite all
those who can make it to the
Campus Sunday night, and stage
a real, hmiest-toagocdness water
fight for them? Wouldn't (they be
impressed at the clever ways we
let on our excess energy?
Wouldn’t they just “ooh” and
“aah” when they saw how we
can throw water balloons out or
windows and off of the Cowles
archway rod 7 And then, to cap
off the iestiv es in grand style,
why don't we give it the old col~
lege try, and see if we can
cover the whole loggla wall with
one big cake of mud? GO to it,
