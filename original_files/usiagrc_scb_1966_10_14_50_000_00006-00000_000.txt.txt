not the country will undertake
the massive and expensive job
or rehabilitating ghetto areas.
He asked MacGregor, who is
chairman of the House Repub-
lican Task Force on Urban-Su-
burban Problems, “Will the
government accept a $100 billion
budget?"

Jones said that since the
movement has come north its
emphasis has shifted to the
massive economic, social. and
psychological problems that ex-
ist in city slums. Only vast
sums of money would eradicate
these problems, he asserted.

Jones said that the civil rights
movement to date, has been
aimed toward simply getting
basic legal rights for the Negro.
Inere has been northern sym<

pathy for this struggle, especial- E

[y while it: took place in the
South. But this summer, Mac-
Gregor said, “fear of black
power. equated with molotov
cocktails and brick throwing"
and reaction to the summer's
riots caused congressional reac-
tion which killed the ’66 righm
bill.
Title V Revival

Maccregor, who is a member
or the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and very active in civil
rights legislation mid of the
revival ol the hi 5 section on
the protection of Civil rights
workers (Title V). It makes a
federal offense of an act of vio-

lence wmmitted against those
who are trying to get for them-
selves or are helping others to
gain civil rights. It also con-
tains a controversial anti-riot
Blouse.

MacGregor also mentioned
the possibility tor passage
next year of the defunct bill‘s
section on nondiscriminatory
jury selection (Title ill). It al-
laws for the use of cnurt in-
junction when the right to
being judged by one's peers is
being denied.

MacGregor claimed that some
civil righu leaders had asked
that the open housing section be
excluded Since it was [no late
to educate the public about the
issue. The rights leaders
thought that the open housing
controversy might jeopardize
the passage of the other sec-
tions.

Proponents of the open occu-
pancy title were also divided

about its content. The President
wanted to outlaw all sales and
rentals — an “insincere" posi-
tion according to MacGregor.
He thought it practical to have
some limitations on the bill, i.e.
in cases of llamliles. friends or
religious groups wanting to buy
or rent a house together.
Exchange

In discussion, MacGregor
denied that he had failed to
publicly state the bill’s dis.
tinction between reallors and
private home owners. Denis
deCoteau, music, stated that
legislators gave in to pressure
by realtors not to clarify this
distinction so that they would
have control over private sel-
lers.

MacGregor said that he ro~
ceived no pressure (mm the
renltors and that he had al-
ways taken the politically un-

popular position of opposing
the real estate lobby. Des
Coteau then claimed that
realtors did not try to pres-
s u r e congressmen directly
hut, according to personal ex-
perience in San Francisco,
they created opposition to the
open housing clause by de.
ceittully pitting ethnic groups
against one another.

Ezra Mendelsohn (history)
told MacGregor that civil rights
legislation today “isn’t rele-
vant” and that as the “richest
country in the world we should
be able to allocate an enormous
amount or money” to solve our
own socioeconomic problems.
MacGregor responded by di<
recting questions of govern-
mental appropriation to the ma-
jority party (not his),

Rights' Range

MacGregor agreed with Jones

that the future right: action
should focus on a wide range
oi poverty problems. but he
insisted that there was still a
great need for further legisla«
lion in the acquisition 0t basil:
rights.

The congressman drew the
line, however, at “forcible
reorganization ot society."
He recently voted against bus-
slng children in a school inte-
gration bill below his mm-
mlttee because he believes
“forcing integration“ is not
the function of lawmakers.
Asked how he thought the

white backlash would affect the
'68 elections, MacGregor pre-
dicted a "lurch to the right"
in the Democratic party. lie
said he hopcd this might prove
that “the Republicans are more
moderate than the Democratic
Left and more moderate than

DEAR lEl

Illitllt

I'm a regular Renoir on the canvas, but on campus I lust don't seem
to make the scene. There was one campus cutie that used to admire my
paintings, but now she's too busy admiring some guy's new Dodge
Dart She says riding in this guy's Dart is like art; every time they go out,
they draw a crowd. What can i do? i lost have to see this girl again.
It's not that l‘m in love with her. I haven't ﬁnished her portrait yet.

DEAR COLOR ME BLUE:
Make your next sitting cit your Dodge Dealer's. After you ﬁnd out how
easy it is to own a Dart, you'll be out painting the town. And don't
worry about ﬁnishing the portrait. With Don, vou'll ﬁnd you have many

models to choose from. Get the picture?

Here's the picture that's worlh'hrthousond oh's. '67 Dodge Dart GT. Dart gives you more
show and go than ever before, and it still has that nice low price. Plus a long list of standard
equipment. Like padded instrument panel, padded sun visors, outside reorview mirror,
carpeting and so much more.)
