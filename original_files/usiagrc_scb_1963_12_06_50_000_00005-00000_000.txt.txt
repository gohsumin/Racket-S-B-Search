mliun Professor of Chemistry
xamines Education at Grinneil

By Karen Adkinson

Grinnell is being scrutinized
ls semester: Tile observers
~e Thomas Barnabas, visiting
'ofessor of chemistry, and his
le.
The Barnabases are carefully
:aminlng the college to find
chniques of administration
hich might be applicable to
hmednagar College in India,
which Mr. Barnabas is prin-
pal.

Barnabas explained, “We

'ant to find out about experi-

ents in education and select

ose which will serve us. We
ave been interested in stu-
ent government, in its activi—
ies and its effect on campus.

150, the way in which physical

ducatlon fits into the academ-

pattern interests us. We have

150 been in on the college

udget and its preparation.

He went on, “The planning
of the addition to the science
building has been most in-
teresting. The chemistry de-
partment has already had
meetings to discuss its needs
and what it would like to see
included. This impresses me;
it is something new, in India
there is no extensive system
in which the man who is ac-
tually going to work in a
building has a voice in the

plans."

The educational system in
India is highly centralized. All
regional colleges including Aha
mednagar are atriliated with
the University and must use
textbooks, follow a syllabus,
and offer examinations speci-
fied by the University. No de-
grees can be COi‘ilel‘rEd except
through the University.

The tests are administered
nation-Wide and at the same
time, Grading is done not at
the college at which the tests
were taken but at another col-
legc. The grade in a course de-
pends entirely upon the exam;
there is no cumulative grade
for classwork etc.

‘We are trying to reform the
system somewhat," said Mrs,
Barnabas, “The courses are
being reworked. For example,
we are helping to rewrite the
chemistry syllabus." ‘

/

Next semester the Barna-
bases will be touring small
liberal arts colleges all over
the nation as a part of a U. S.
State Department program.
Six heads of colleges in
South East Asia are being
sent to the U. S, for this tour.

Two weeks will be spent on
each campus.

The Barnabases were here in
1949 when Mr. Barnabas was
a student at the University of
Minnesota. The changes they
noted include ‘small, silly
little things' such as more pre-
cooked foods and the disap-
pearance of pressure cookers.
Mr. Barnabas also noted,
“American people are very in»
ternationally minded now, un<
like 14 years ago. They are
more conscious of our prob-
lems and seem to feel that
what happens in other areas of
the world might affect them.
They seem to be saying. “We
cannot be uninterested specta-

tors in the world's affairs any.
more,"

The Barnabases have seen
vast changes in their own
country also, many of which
have been brought about by ed-
ucation. .

Mrs. Barnabas n o t c d,
“There is no more middle in
a change. The son of an illite
crate farmer who is earning
subsistence wages may be-
come an educated man with
a Very high income. The fa-
ther doesn‘t always under-
stand the change, but he
wants it for his child. We look
for tomorrow and for a bet-
ter life."

Mr. Barnabas added, "in the
college we can see change in
five years. There is a revolu«
tion in family structure and
economics even in the time
since independence. The col-
leges are now turning out an-
gry young men, which is a good
sign because they will provide

 

change in the future.”

 

Travel Scholar lo Ahmednagar, India.
Describes Experiences, Observations

By Nancy McCannon

Jean Gisscnass, Travel Schol.
or to India. who came to the

Younker’s Lounge discussion
last Friday wearing a bright,
blue sari, enumerated some of
lndia's main problems and
cited the part that Ahmedna-
gar, the Indian School in which
she taught last year, played in
solving them.

She listed India’s longestande
ing problems: the tendency of
students to leave the villages
after they are educated, inadea
quate transportation and com-
munication, a language barrier
caused by the many dialects
and languages spoken in lndia,
and a resulting lack of national
feeling.

Ahmednagar, she s a i d
had added a program to pro-
vide higher education in the

village life. During last
year‘s Chinese invasion the
school got news of the,situa—

 

[ion to surrounding gillagcs.

 

She felt that india itself is
taking definite steps toward
solving its difficulties with
greatly improved transporta<
tion facilities and a current
review of the problems in-
volved in a national lan-
guage.

Miss Gissenass, whose duties
included teaching advanced
English, supervising the ladies'
dormitory, and planning the
music program for the chapel
services, said that she felt she
had become a part of student
life in India, “The students
were very friendly, and ire-
quently invited me to their
homes and activities”

“The Travel Scholar pro-
gram isn’t long enough,” was
the one complaint. “I think that
much more could be accom-
plished if the Grinilell program
were two years long instead of
one year,“

Miss Gissenass is now super-
vising a YMCA program in St,
Louis.

 

Sex. Morality. Psychoanalysis
Discussed by Smith. Berryhill

By Ann Showalter

Reverend Joseph Smith of
the Presbyterian Church in
Colfax and Dr. Leroy Berry-
hill, Director of the Jasper
County Mental Health Center
in Newton, discussed “Sex,
Morality and Psychoanalysis"
Sunday in Younker ”Lounge.

Smith observed that the nat-
uralists and the dualists hold
opposing views on sex and the
physical world in general.

The adherents of naturalism
have ”an accepting attitude
towards the physical and view
the sexual nature of man with
gratitude and joy,”

The dualist, on the other
hand, shrinks from “glut-
tony, greed, lust and naked-
ness," believing the real
world to be ”invisible to the
eyes of the flesh, attainable
only lhrou g h contempla-
tion.:’

According to Smith, true
Christianity is not dualistic.
Christianity developed from
Judaism, a faith which ac-
knowledges the value of nature
in the story of the Creation.
After He created the world
and Man, “God saw that it was
good." This means that man
in his natural state is “good."

Smith belives that if people
would follow Jesus' precept,
“Love God, love your neigh~
her," they would act towards
each other out of consideration
and would not try to exploit
each other sexually.

Smith feels, “Sex is good
with the right motivations be-
hind it." He thinks that the in<
dividual who does not act with-
in the mores of society is act-
ing from the wrong motiva-
tion and will be likely to suf-
fer from anxiety causing him
to be unable to love God fully.

Berryhill stressed the imv
portance of the individual's de-
veloping for himself a “pre
martial sex ethic.”

He said that for some people,
both married and single, sex is
enjoyable and satisfactory; for
others, it seems to bring more
problems than pleasure.

Sex can create such prob-
lems as divorce, unwanted

 

pregnancy and marriage,

and “guilt feelings.” To
avoid such problems, each
person must set up a stand
ard for himself based on two
general principles: “what
seems right to him” .and
“good judgment."

“Most sexual problems re-
sult from a person’s doing
something he really thinks is
wrong,” Berryhlll Stated.

in doing what seems right a
person must use good judg-
ment which includes considera-
tion of the other person in-
volved and of the possible con.
sequences.

Berryhill thinks good judg-
ment may help a couple avoid
situations in which they might
tend to become overstimulatn
ed,

He also feels that young
people, wishing to be accepted
by their peers, may do and
say things they don’t really
think are right. A girl may be-
come promiscuous to prove
she is womanly; a boy may try
to prove his manliness by ex‘
aggerating his sexual exploits.

Berryhill thinks student!
should realize that “true mas-
culinity and femininity come
from standing up for what one
believes is right even if this
causes the individual to act
contradictory to the group
standards." '

Bogus check Writer

(ACP)#A North Texas State
University, Denton, student
has been Sentenced to ninu
months in jail for writing 13

 

worthless 0 he c k s totaling
more than $400.
THE CAMPUS CHAT said

the 20-year-old junior had Writ-
ten checks on banks where he
had no account. But County
Atty. John Law warned that
an ”insufficient funds" check
can‘ be just as serious. And he
added: “Just because hot
check writers are students, it
doesn’t mean they are not
going to jail."

The campus newspaper said
it omitted mentioning tharstu-
dent's name because of a pol-
icy of identifying only those
law breakers involved in felony
cases, which are punishablo by,
penitentiary sentences. /,
