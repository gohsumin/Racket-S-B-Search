We're Game

We were told by last year’s staff that it we wanted to
make any innovations on the 5&3, we had better make them
right away or we’d get sidetracked by the million details in-
volved in getting out a paper every week.

We liked a lot of things about the old paper. In fact, we
kept the old nameplate. But we have made several changes
and hope to make a few more before we’re through with our
independent study.

We have a couple iiew columnists, a cartoonist, an ex-
change editor, and an editor digging through old papers for
items that could Just as easily have taken place today.

We have fine new offices in the Forum; the inner office
has cork»board walls just like the Forum lobby, and the outer
offices have a view of the construction for the science build-
ing addition to the north.

We are using the new newsprint, which, if you compare it
discerningly with the paper used in last semester’s issues,
doesn't look quite so yellow. It will be in permanent use
except for a couple weeks around the beginning of March
while the printer waits for a new shipment.

We’ve put sports on the last two pages, because that’s
where the sports editor thinks sports should be.

We have a portable tape recorder with which we hope to
do much of our intei'Vlewmg this year. You know, like US.
News and World Report and Playboy.

We have an editorial this week, but we can‘t promise one
every week. We don’t think there will be an issue of impor-
tance every week, but when something juicy comes up we
want to take plenty of time on it.

For those of you who would like to know our policy,
we will consider being more irreverent, more responsible,
more intellectual, more interesting, more vital, more unbiased,
more thorough, more provocative. But all we can promise is
that we will be more game. ..

Shades of Gray
The liberal Art

By Carl Otis Gray

it seems that nowadays the hig thing is the “how
to“ book. Helen Curley Brown, Norman Vincent
Peale, Dale Carnegie, Charles Atlas and a score of
others have set down on paper the various rules and
instructions tor making everything tram muscles to
men. Far from being on the outside at such a iast
growing enterprise, i think that Negroes should meet
the challenge of the sixties and come out with their
own “how to” book.

Although the table of Contents of such a book
would ﬁll more space than is available in this col-
umn, i'd like to brieily give a summation of one
chaptn- that; might be included. Chapter xxw—
The College Negro, it is one of the lengthy chap-
ters but of great interest to all young people at
color from Cambridge to Oxford (American ver-
sions).

"Being a Negro on campus is simply not enough,"
says What Every Young Negro Should Know. “You
must be a liberal Negro." This means many dutiful
hours of practice and patience for this great goal
cannot be achieved in one reading. “The liberal Ne«
gro is truly a thing to be admired. and in ten days
you can achieve admiration at your triends.
the adoration or your parents, and complete mas-
tery or human nature — or your money back."

First, the problem is to establish your speciﬁc
pose; there are three approaches: 1) Angry Young
Man—hate your society, protest against it, start a
young socialist league; 2) Le petit Buurgems Noir
— accept your society, become part of it 7 as

the iootball iield nobody's going to care Whether
you're a Negro or not—make sure you stay on the
football fields.

al basic rules must be obeyed First. all displays oi

well, everybody counts on you to keep abreast of
the latest tunes and steps so that they can watch you
and then go to their rooms and practice in secret
until they've perfected it. Next, be curious about
things that you've never come into contact with
before—fried chicken, watermelon, Dixie Peach, and
even other Negroes! Read Ebony; chauvinism,

night, just passing South Younker, when this red
Corvette pulls up and the driver sticks his head
out the Window.

"Hey, man, where's the action?”

i consider mentioning Langan Hall, but then
notice his California license plates and realize he
wouldn't appreciate a local joke. By this time he's
out at the car, snapping his lingers and doing a
little (lance in the snow. He‘s got a white cat coat
and a long red scarf that matches his car. He’s
h-iendly. so I ingratiate hiin.

“Follow me. it's linals, man, but maybe we can
troll over to the union and hustle some dollles any-
Way.”

"Groovy.”

So we’re off, taking me shortcut across the
show through the gap between the sctence huilding
and the women’s gym. I’ve got last week’s copy
of Time under my arm and I'm making quick ret-
ereuccs in it during our conversation.

We're approaching the lights oi The Forum, and
we can hear the music from the jukebox through
the wlndow. This means two things. First. they
haven't locked the doors lately, and second. they
haven’t turned the jukebox down yet.

“While you’re traveling around, do you ever
catch the Righteous Brothers on “shindig,“ man?”
We’re inside and I'm moving toward the door to
the North lounge. -,

“Yeah, shoore. but let's make it in here lirst."i
He's motiuning w the grill. “1 got to get the good
girls picked out." ‘

inside, the grill has its usual scattering at peo-
ple. Not very crowded tonight. A girl l've been ad-
miring all year is coming toward us to leave. she's
very pretty; maybe she’d like to dance. But my
friend has spotted a girl with ratted hair, sitting
alone in a far corner.

“Hey, baby," he waves, “What'd ya hear from
your hair?" He's shouting as he moves toward her
unaware of the people staring at him. They lnll‘O-‘
diice each pillar, and has quickly got her into a‘
conversation,

It's time for me to slip away, looking like I've
forgotten something important. But l‘m curious
about the girl With the rotted hair. She can‘t be a
student, and I thought the Forum legion discouraged
outsiders. She must be somebody’s daughter.
