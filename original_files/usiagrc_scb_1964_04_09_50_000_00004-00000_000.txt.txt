SCARLET AND BLACK

 

FDR Influences Senate Service.
Helps Shape Background of [B].
Dems' Only Presidential Candidate

Four years ago the Grinnell
Scarlet and Black ran an ar-
ticle on each of the hopefuls for
President. Side by side were
printed articles about John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B, John
son, two men whose back-
grounds were vastly different.
yet whose futures were to be
inextricably interlocked.

Johnson possessed those
"humble beginnings” which
are supposed such an asset in

JOHNSON

political life. Born the eldest
child of a frontier Texas legis~
lator in 1908, Johnson spent his
boyhood in a land of poverty.
He was quick to sense the ne-
cessity of hard work and edu-
cation and worked his way
through Southwest Texas State
Teachers College by holding
down sometimes as many as
{our jobs. In college he ma»
jorcd in government and his-
tory, was student body presi-
dent and a campus leader.

Johnson’s Washington career
began in the opening days of
the New Deal when he became
employed there as an assist-
ant to a Texas congressman.
During his stay in Washington,
where he became known as
one of the best assistants on
Capitol Hill, he met two people
who were to have a profound
affect on his life: Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Claudia Taylor,
known since childhood as
"Lady Bird.”

At the age of 25 Johnson tem-
porarily left Washington to
take over the state directorship
of the National Youth Admins
lstration. In this capacity he
helped many students make
their way through school in de»

pression years and set the pre-]
c e d e n t of establishing an:

N. Y. A. program for Negro
youths in Texas. It was from
this post that he resigned to ,re«
turn to Washington in 1937 fol-
lowing his first successful cam-
paign for Congress.

His friend of earlier Washing
ton days, Roosevelt, did not
forget him and in 1940 when
Democratic control of me
House was threatened, it was
to Johnson that F, D. R. com-
mended the national campaign
to retain a Democratic major-

 

ity, Johnson succeeded so well
in his task that not only was
the House held in Democratic
control, but the majority was
increased as Well,

Johnson Continued to be a
vigorous New Deal supporter
and in 1941 he was la key ad-
ministration leader in th e
House right for a two-ocean
Navy. It was in this same year
that he announced, from the
White House steps, his candi-
dacy for the United States Sen-
ate,

When war came in 1941. John»
son Voted for and became the
first member of Congress to
enlist in the war. He won the
Silver Star for gallantry in ac-
tion while in the South Pacific
and was decorated by General
MacArthur. _

With his return to Congress
in 1948 Johnson soon showed
the ability which made him in
1960 the most powerful man in
the Ui S. Senate. The tremend-
ous influence he exercised on
such committees as the Naval
Affairs committee in the House,
Armed Services committees of
both House and Senate, the
Joint Congressional Committee
on Atomic Energy and the Sen-
ate Committee on Space and
Astronautices as well as the
fact that Johnsonded Demo-
crats won overwhelmingly in
1952, '54, and ’56 are substan»
tial proof of his power.

The Johnson appeal of re—
sponsibility, preparedness and

leadership enabled him to win'

every showdown voting test as
majority leader.

The supreme test of his "re-
sponsibility, preparedness and
leadership” came on Novem-
ber 22, 1963 when tragedy
called for a man of both per-
sonal and political strength and
Johnson was capable of giving
such strength. The strength
which held a country together
for those few dark days has in
no way diminished in recent
months as Johnson has pressed
to secure the goals of our late
President as well as forward»
ing many of his own ideals.

Innocuous Vice President ti Dangerous luxury for Present,
Hubert Humphrey Offers Necessary Experience, Greatness

By Dennis Murphy

Neither the Republicans nor
the Democrats can longer at-
ford the luxury of nominating
for Vice President innocuous
candidates whose sole purpose

is to balance the ticket geoA
graphically, ideologically, or
religiously. The man nominated
for Democratic VicevPresiden-
tial Candidate must possess all
the ability, experience, and con~
fidence required by the office
of President — and he must
show promise of becoming a
truly great President. It is our
sincere belief that Senator Hu—
bert Humphrey of Minnesota
shows that promise.

Senator Humphrey holds no
claim to striking good looks;
he does not represent a popu-
lous northeastern State, Hum-
phrey is, instead, one of the
most influential men in Wash-
ington; he is a Liberal without
reservations whose record of
progressive legislation dates
back to his first elective office,
“I believe in the liberalism of
advocacy and action," related
Humphrey in an article for the
Phi Beta Kappa Journal. Liber-
alism should be equated with
“Man’s striving for Civilization

and dignity." It is a . . phi~
losophy willing to use the state
to achieve freedom."

Few modern political figures
have a record of accomplish-
ments to compare with that of
Senator Humphrey. As Mayor
of Minneapolis from 1945-43,
Humphrey established the first
Fair Employment Practices
Commission in the United
States In the 1948 Democratic

National Convention, when the
passage ot a mild Truman
backed Civil Righbs plank
S e e m E d imminent, Senator
Humphrey addressed the Con<
vention with these provocative
words: “I say this: that the
time has arrived in America
for the Democratic Party to
get out of the shadow of states
rights and walk forthrightly
into the bright sunshine of hu<
man rights." Passage of the
strongest Civil Rights plank in
the history of the party fol-
lowed this powertul plea—and

, the Southerners walked out or

' the Convention,

No man deserves greater

Test Ban Treaty than Hubert
Humphrey. It was Humphrey
who set up and headed the Sen-
ate Disarmament Subcommite
tee, and initiated the United
States Arms Control and Die-
armament Agency. His Senate
resolution cosponsored by Sen.

ban on nuclear tests in the at-
mosphere, the fringes of outer«
