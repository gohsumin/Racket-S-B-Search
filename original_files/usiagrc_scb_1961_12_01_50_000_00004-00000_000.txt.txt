This is lndeed a year of ci' '
when the UN faces grave chale
lenges which threaten its very
existence. The problems before
it range from the self-determ—
ination ol member nations to
possible bankruptcy.

During the weekend we heard
some of the most pressing and
difficult issues discussed: the
new African nations, the reoi»
ganization of the Secretariat.
bankruptcy, the representation
of China. the neutral nations, and
disarmament

In discussing the emerging and
developing nations of Africa. Dr.
Rufus Clement. President of
Howard University. described
that continent's main needs as
education, capital. medicine,
food, national unity and physical
stability.

It was also said that those
viewing African neutralism as
important in world aifairs
must beer in mind the discrep-
ancy between her weakness in
military strength and capital
and the position she now must
take in the world community.
