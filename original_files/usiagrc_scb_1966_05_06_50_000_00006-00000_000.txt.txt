that!" The lack of such conferences is
due to the people who aren‘t there, ac-
cording to Eldridge. and he expressed a
need [or stipulated times when people
can discuss problems in policy.

An understanding between students and
administration on the problems of mor-
ality would, hopefully, be promoted by
such discussions. The faculty at the con-
Ierence felt that basic to the success
of the discussions is for the adminis-
trative official to be recognized by both
the student and himself as an authority
who is also a human being. When asked
to make a statement of policy or clarifi-
cation, the official should appear more
fallible |han irreproachable.

Discuss Issues of Privacy

in a writing session Monday after-
noon. students and faculty expressed ac-
lual policy changes they ielt necessary.
The ideas centered around the need for
privacy, accompanied by a clarification
of its ends, its degree, its form and its
consequences

Most felt that the request for privacy
does not imply a desire for the opportua
nity for sexual intercourse. In fact, one
faculty member stated that when stu~
dents request privacy, they do so with
considerable ambivalence If the request
were studied “in depth,” it would be
found that there are three basic fears
connected with the type oi privacy com
ducive to sex:

1, Fear of loss of control over emoa

tions.

Zr Fear of more emotional and sexual
involvement than the student is
ready lor, and

3. For women particularly, fear of a

loss of reputation which might be
connected With being seen at unlim-
ited open dorms.

What is the end, then, that students
want when they request privacy? Confer-
ence members agreed that there is a
delinite need for a place for arguing,
crying, and talking, both among couples
and groups. Both faculty and students
discussed the possibility oi rooms fur-
nished with easy chairs and linoleum,
rooms ConduCiVe to communication
short of intercourse. It was generally ad-
mitted that the idea was naive and mun<
dane, but satisfactory to those who
would not want to risk the temptations
of open rooms.

Student representatives were concerned
mainly With the question of facilities
when asked what they would consider
Lhe ideal College situation. They Cun<
sidered open rooms as one answer to
privacy, and planned their facilities so
that open dorms would not inconvenience
others

Opens Rules by Consensus

Open dorm policy would he detera
mined by a consensus of people living
within the unit, regulated in a manner
similar to the planning and enforcing of
quiet hours. The group thinking was that
this liberalized open dorm policy would
be more readily enforced if rules were
made by a consensus.

All expressed a need for a realistic
explanation of the administration's ideas

Von privacy, punishments they would iu<

that for breaking oi rules, and the psy-
chological consequences that the indivia
dual would suffer.

Discussion of this particular phase oC<
curred in the Monday morning session

when Allan Fl Demorcst, DI the Jasper
County Mental Health Service, was the
guest speaker. According to Demorest.
an individual can behave as he wishes
if lie I5 willing to suffer the consequences.
A college has no right to control verbal
limits of students, but it can control
hehovorial limits by setting the pun-
ishments and explaining the conse-
quences. However, Demorest continued,
the administration is not required to jus<
tily its rationale behind the policies it
follows. The members oi the group
agreed that perhaps this is true irom
a legalistic view, but the college, also
Will stiffer certain consequences if it
follows this policy.

School Must Know Itself

In the following discussion, Demorest
explained his viewpoint, and stated that
rebellion against the rules limiting free-
dom Will not bother a school if the
authority “knows itseli and its goals."
However, when the authority is insecure
and does not or cannot state the definite
rules and expectations realistically, the
students have a legitimate issue. Here
the group felt that this contusion is quite
detrimental to a stable community:
“fuzziness is worse than tyranny”

in presenting his own view on privacy
and its role in the community, Demorest
felt that it is possible to create a psy-
chological privacy, and that students
were not using their imaginations when
they asked for physical facilities for pri<
vacyi However, the group opposed this
stand by asking where the source of this
psychological freedom stems, and they
felt that it was unrealistic to think that
all students are capable of creating such
a world for themselves.

The Hoffman report charges “that
workers in Buildings and Grounds,
Housekeeping, and Saga Food Service all
are exploited through a combination of
low wages, poor working conditions, and
harsh working schedules."

The Summary Statement oi the report
includes such accusations as:

“Grinnell College is reputed to be a
kind of haven from the indifference. self<
ishness and inhumanity of the outside
world. One of the noble objectives or our
college reads: ‘to motivate him (the
Grinnell Student) towards concern for
his neighbors, democratic ideals, cork
sciouslless of social responsibility, and
life of service to his fellow men.’

“Recall how our whole education at
Grinnell is aimed at this objective, Re-
member how our humanities and histm‘i<
cal Studies, lectures and selected works
were designed to imbibe us with the lib-
eralrhumanitarian spirit of the Western
Civilization, . .

“How many faculty members know
that while their salaries have been
doubling over each five year period,
other college employees are receiving no
pay increases or increased benelits? Is
the faculty aware that other college em<
ployees are without individual protection
or promotion plans? Admittedly, faculty
ignorance is a major factor for the com
tinuation oi the present labor system. . .

”Grinnell's eager young minds should
realize that this world is an ugly place
where everyone, including colleges and
educators, grab all they can get at the
expense of others."

In regards to th e s o statements
Richman said they badly needed updat-
ing and that investigation would definite-
ly be done during the next year to see
how valid the statements were.
