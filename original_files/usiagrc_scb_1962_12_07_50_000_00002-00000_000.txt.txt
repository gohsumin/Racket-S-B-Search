The fact is that at the present time the student lcation to stimulate and challenge

weakness lies not so much in the arguments for dents ‘
changes ill themselves, but rather in the position from

which we are arguing".

President Bowen is in a position where he can go
before the Senate and tell them that there can be no can
sideratioll ' rule changes because in his opinion there has
been a gradual slippage in the enforcement of college rules.
Itvis pretty hard to deny thé fact that many college rules,
including major rules. are being ﬂagrantly violated.

In this context, how can we even think of proposing
that liberalization: be made in rules wliell we mllst real-
ile that they would stand no chance of being passed by the
Board of Trustees

Our main task lies in improving our bargaining posi on.

semester Humanities Course, sim-

however, i was failing the course
under a different professor when
l sought help from him. Several
times I asked tor a conference
‘ztnd ﬁnally succeeded in arrang-

only advice he gave me was to
see what the critics had to sav

enormous differences ill enforcement ilow existing especial-
ly on North Campus
Once these statements are made we should see
that enforcement is carried out. Ill the long run, the
Cole’ member who does his job by enforcing college
rules helps those who want to change those rules by
providing for the reformer an atmosphere where the
Administration and the Board of Trustees are more
receptive to student pressures.

Another step which must be taken to bring about this
improved atmosphere is a ceszltion ol’ inconsiderate aoti is
by the student body which recently have been illcreasin
