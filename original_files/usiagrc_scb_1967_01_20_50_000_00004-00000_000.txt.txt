fact that Thursday’s request for
open rooms involved a last
minute change from Friday to
saturday night. Asked to pre-
dict the future of Visitation in
general, the dean replied, “l
tlon‘t know; it depends on ev-
eryone.“

Bob Foote, C of HF president,
commented after the Thursday
Deans’ Committee meeting that
open rooms during North Cam-
Ius Weekend were a tradition
at so) years standing. Open
rooms were scheduled last; year
on North Campus during the
same weekend. “The focal
point or today’s committee
meeting,” stated Foote, “was a
heated discussmn of what is an
appropriate social event during
which to schedule open rooms."

While admitting that “it is the
prerogative of the deans to se
lect occasions for open rooms,"
new Social Coordinator Steve
keich maintained that he had
presented the Committee “a
more adequate justification" of
the appropriateness of includ-
ing open rooms from am pm.

Deans'
Statement

Grinnell College Student
Handbook, 11. 17: The Deans’
Committee, in consultation
with the North and South
Campus social chairmen, may
schedule a general North
Campus or South Campus
open house. or a general col-
lege open house, before all
appropriate all-college social
event.

The North Campus social
Chairman talked with the Dean
of Men late in the first semes»
ter. when details of this week-
more North Campus Weekend,
including a suggested time for
“open rooms" different than the
time now proposed, were not yet
firmly established. After a
Thursday noon meeting with
the SGA Executive Cabinet, tlle
North Campus social chairman,
and the acting Social Coordina»
tor, the Deans’ Committee feels
that the program for the week-
end as presented at the meet<
ing did not require “open
rooms” for the success of the
events as planned.

As stated in the Student Ac-
tivities Calendar tor January.
in spite of the title of “North
Campus Weekend,” the only
residence hall social function
planned is a folk Concert in
Younkei— Lounge and a dance in
the Norris Lounges (reference
is made to the last approved all-
campus open house, the South
Campus program of last Sep-
tember M, in which each wom-
en’s residence hall had planned
parties or programs that quite
successfully involved all resi—
dents and their guests). (It is
hoped that before we Compli-
cate the discussion with emon

atmosphere, we can keep the
issues as honest as possible by
working with the existing agree

tivities. Reich asserted, “I’m
not convinced that the deans
are really concerned with the
issue of the ‘apprupriateness’ oi!
open rooms during this par-
ticular event.” Reich felt that
the committee was primarily
concerned during the meeting
with the general college policy
on visitation.

“The purpose of this Week-
end, rather than its events, is
unique,” explained Reich,
“and open rooms are the tra-
ditionai element which en«
hances the aim of the week-
end — to promote and en.
courage informal social'hg
on North Campus." Reich
argued that the weekend is

stresses the development of
North campus as a social
entity, encouraging students
to “participate individually in
a social event approximating
a more natural existence than
is usually found at: Grinnell."
Agreeing with Bob Foote. who
commented that “the commit-
tee's objections were procedur-
al and political, rather than
practical,” Reich added that
holding open rooms Saturday
night, despite its "regrettably
hasty” scheduling, would ac-
tually have involved no prepa-
ration other than notification of
North Campus hall social chair-
men. He concluded that, in his
opinion, the Deans Dilered no
concrete reasons for vetoing
open rooms for North Campus
Weekend.

cipants. including faculty and
administrators as well as stu-

dents view the Interim idea
as a potentially effective way
of encouraging students to take
more initiative and get more in-
volved in learning.

The failure of the old interim
program caused many students,
faculty and administrators to be
skeptical of the Wisdom of the
new program when it first
came before the Senate last Fall.

The old interim program, in-
stituted in 1963, required all
students to be on campus. Con-
sequenlly. many students were
not specifically interested in the
planned activities. Furthermore,
the program consisted primarily
of faculty lectures. Student in-
volvement was by all measures
low.

in a poll taken for the 5&3 in

February, 1965, 3 s o sludents
agreed with the faculty decision
to drop interim from the sched-
ule and 275 were opposed.

Efforts were made this year
to assure that only those genu~
inely interested in the program
would return. The new program
placed emphasis on student in-
volvement in discussion rather
than lectures. This year’s poll
indicated that of those replying,
98 percent thought they benefited
from this participation. The 1965
figure tor a similar question
was 60 percent.

When asked about future plans,
MacDowell said, “I do not see
any reason why we should not
have an interim next year.”

“in the long run, general ed-

controlled fertility," Concluded
Dr. Hauser. “There is not one
example of a nation steeped in
illiteracy and poverty that has
decreased its birth rate; nor is
there a nation that did not lie
crease its rate with the attain-
ment of literacy.”

in his second lecture, "Popa
lilation, Economic Develop-
ment and World Politics,” Dr.
Hauser considered obstructions
to technological advancement in
areas where the number of in-
habitants as much as doubled
every twenty years. Such a
growth rate produces an “ad-
verse” age structure; a situa-
tion in which a large segment
of the population is too young to
work. Thus scarce funds must
be channeled into feeding and
caring for nonproductlve chil-
dren, a situation referred to as
“a disproportionate use of sav-
ings tor social investment.”
