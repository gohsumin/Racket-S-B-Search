and would remove the Social
CoordinaLor from the Execu-
tive Cabinet. It would also elim-

officials of Student govern-
lnenl, are to “streamline decis-
ion-making and opinion aru-
culation," and to “coordinate
all SGA activities better than

lslative body, remove the Exec l

llthE cabinct yew while giv-
lng them a larger role in Coun-
cil decision,” according to a
statement to the Student Sen-
ale.

According to SGA President,
Phil Johnson, the Student Sen-
ate will only discuss the pro-
posed amendments, this week,
while Consideration of their
adoption will take place after
the Christmas Vacation. Ac-
cording Lo the SGA constitution,
cbnstitutional amendments may
be proposed by a majority vote
of the student Senate but then
must be passed by an all stu-
dent vote.
