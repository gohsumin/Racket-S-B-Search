Seven lettermen, tour of them
starters and a fifth a semi-reg»
ular a year ago, return for the
196566 basketball season at Grin-
nell, but also on hand is the same
problem that plagued the Pioneers
last winter.

Once again, the Pioneers lack
height and rebounding power. None
of the pioneers who are expected
to see heavy action top 631/2 and
only ﬁve of them are taller than
6~L

The shortest team in the Mid~
west conference last year, the Plo-
neers finished with a 7-15 record,
Their 5.13 loop mark dropped them
into a cellar tie with Monmouth.

“We will be giving away a lot
at height in virtually every game
again this year." notes Coach John
Pfitsch, "but we will have better
overall height than last season. We
should be able to put two or three
pretty good board men under the
basket and hope to do a more et-

fective
year.”

“We should also have better
depth than in 196465,” according to
Pfitsch, “I feel that we can put
any of ll) or 11 boys on the floor at
any time without being hurt." Last
winter, Pfitsch was forced to go
With six players much ot the sea-
son and fouls frequently crippled
the Pioneers.

The returning lettermen are Jeff
Frantz, Elliott Hibbs, Tom Hill,
and Tom Risser, all starters a
year ago, Bob Watt, a semi-regular
in 1964-65, and Dick Lowell, and
Dan Markman. Frantz, a 6-2 sen-
ior, excells in every phase at the
game — scoring, rebounding, de-
fense, and flour play. He received
first team all—conference recogni-
tion last season and rewrote a con-
siderable portion of the school rec-
ord book, setting season standards
with his 509 points, 208 field goals,
and 23.1 average, and claiming sin~

job of rebounding this

Or

gle game marks of 46 points and~
22 field goals. He also led the team
with 53 free throws and 234 re«
bounds.

Hibbs and Hill, a pair oi juniors?
tallied 286 and 273 points, respec<
tively, a year ago for 13.0 and 12.3
averages. Hill, 6-1. also ranked
third in the rebounding department
with 136. Kisser had a 7.3 average;
Watt a 3.4 average,

Battling the vets for startin
spots are four sophomores wh
were regulars on last year’s frosh
outfit that won four of six engages

kin. All. averaged in double figures.

Wrestlers Face ‘Build'

Back as Grinnell wrestling coach
atter a two-year hitch in the Peace
Corps, Terry Moore has only rour
lettermen returning from last
year’s Pioneer team which posted
a 6-5 dual meet mark and placed
third in the Midwest Conference
meet.

Sophomores fill all but one of the
other spots on the lZ—man squad.
Six oi the newcomers are expected
to earn regular status.

“This has to be classed as a
building year for us,” according
to Moore. “As has been customary
with Grinnell wrestling teams, we
don’t have much depth. With only
one boy at most weight classes,
we Will really be in trouble if any
ct them are hurt. But, we have the

makings of a respectable team and
hope to win our share or dual
meets and finish in the confer-
ences's first division.”

The returning vets are Bill
Barnes. 123; Ken Strubler, 130;
Gary Wilson, 160; and Bob Geller,
17].

Two or the toughest little guys
in the conference, Barnes and
Strubler have already earned
places among Grinnell's mat
greats.

Barnes, the deiending loop titlist
at 123, won 12 of 15 matches a
year ago, including eight in a row
at the end of the campaign. He
placed second in the league the
previous year.

Third in the league as a sopho-

ing Year'

more and second last winter, Stru<.
bler boasts a 27764 record for his
two years of action.

A late addition to the team last
year, Wilson lost only once in six‘
appearances and placed third in
conterence competition. Geller was
214. He frequently wrestled at lei,
where he gave away considerable
weight.

The sophomore contingent is
rated as Grinneli’s most talented.
in at least three years. Sopho<
mores who are expected to claim
iull time jobs are Mike Martinson,
115; Joel Richman, 137; John‘
Sharpe, 145; Ray Mendel, 152;
Lou Kelley. 167; and Lee Roth-
stein, 191.

There are no heavyweights on
the squad.

 

Swimmers' Problem-Shallowness

Grinnell, which boasted one of
its deepest swimming teams in his
tory last year, will iieid one oi its
shallowest this time around.

Thirteen mermen were consistent
point getters in 1964—65 as the Pio-
neers won eight of nine dual meets
and placed third in the Midwest
Conference outing. This season,
Coach Irv Simone has only four of
them back — Ken Adelman, Bill
Batschelet, Richard Lance and Bill
Lontz. All four are juniors. There
isn’t a single senior on the nine-
man squad.

The top returnee is Adelman, a
butteriiy specialist who cracked
both the school and pool marks four
times a year ago. He lowered Grin-
nell’s 20~yard pool record to 2:125
and notched a school standard of
2210.1 at Carleton’s 25-yard pool.
Unbeaten in dual meet competition,
he placed third in the conference

 

Selected as the most improved
swimmer on last year's team,
Lontz Claimed the number two
spot in the conference in the 50-
yard freestyle. He was also a
mainstap on the freestyle relay
quartet.

Lance, who doubles as a diver
and sprinter, concentrated on the
iormer event a year ago, held down
the number one spot for the Pin-
neers, and ranked among the loops
top performers. Because of the
lack of depth this year, he will
probably be called on in the
sprint events too.

Batschelet is tabbed for duty in
both the 200- and Evil-yard free-
style events.

Rounding out the squad are five
sophomores — Bruce Austin. Steve
tIoltze, Richard Seifcrt, Robert
Wells, and Eric Vail,
