by Pete Zwick

prank Bane, a former Expendtic reapportionmeiltofslate legis:

tivc Director of the Social Sccu
ity Administration and present
Chairman of the Advisory Comv
mission oi interionGovermental
Relations, spoke on Tuesday

latul‘es.

Second, one oi major import;
ance to the Federal government,
is the United ”States relationship
with the European Common

evening in Younkex lounge onlMaIkct and a revamping oi our

challenges and problems
which our local state and na—
ticilal governments will be iac-
ing in the next ten years.

‘The function of state and local
governments, according to Bane,
is to serve as a‘ “collective houses
keeper” for the community. In

,this capacity they assume the

burdens of education, health and

lWorld Wzir l, were mainly fame
ily problems.

Thus. expanding government
has become a ”commodity
which is purchascd by the Ameri-
can citizen through taxes,
which in turn serves the pure

, chaser as much as he desires, The
2 Cost ,of this Vast governmental

operation, although It has risen
drastically in recent years, is
still, in the words of Bane, “the
best bargain you can buy.”

The role oi the Federal go’v-I

sion, according ,to Bane, will

though there will be a‘notable
use in local administration of
projects. Unfortunately, con—
stant with this increase in the
role of the Federal government
there will he a corresponding
increase in bureaucratic Ire?-
sonnel, a problem which can
only be handled by further
executive reorganization, such
as took place in the recent
State Department shakeup.

As far as the basic, long range
rohlcms of American govern
ment are concerned, Bane sees
them as threefold. I

First is the issue of rapidly
expanding metropolitan commun-
Itics. The great problem here in»

Valves the administration of

Third, and most Important, is
the problem which faces all oi

that oi maintaining our objec—
tives and at the same time
preserving world peace.
