to do it promptly and with enough
power so no one would be hurt."

tific men.” He said we Should ask,
: “what do we need to know, for our
’ ' own benefit, that we can learn
trom outer space exploration and
what is the military influence of
this new science?" He Said we
ought to spend our main ettoi-t in
near space, and trom the informa-
tion we learn there, ”one day we
can go to the moon or any other
place without any great difficulty.”

President Johnson’s policy in the
Dominican Republic was deiended
by Eisenhower on grounds that
American intervention would “ale
low the genuine government to or-
ganize and gradually take over,"

Eisenhower did not like the com-
parison between the Dominican and
Cuban Situations, however. He
said that in its early stages, Fi-
del Castro's rebellion in Cuba had
received wide public support in
America. “We thought the fellow
was doing pretty well.”

When it was finally clear that
Castro was a communist, Eisene
hower said, “I definitely authorized
the mobilizing of Cuban reiugees

l who volunteered lor military serv-
ice, armed thcin, and began to
train them.” Had we moved quick»
ly against Castro, Eisenhower ielt,
“we would have been called the
worst interventionist, imperialist,
and everything else in the works."

During the student questioning
period, Eisenhower was ﬁrst con-
fronted with the question of why he
did not authorize sending American
troops to Hungary during the 1956
revolt in that country.

“It was impossible, Hungary is
surrounded. Britain and France at
that time were preoccupied with
their difficulties in Suez and cer-
tainly didn't want to extend theme
selves. The only way we could adr
equately have handled the situa—
tion would have been going directly
to Russia with our bomb. And this
to my mind was unthinkable in that
the present state of world opinion
would have made it unwise at that
time.”

Eisenhower felt that the admin-
isti‘ation’s Viet Nam policy must
be backed, even by the academic
community, it we are not to look
weak in the eyes of the commu-
nists. “I don’t think we will get
anywhere by simply criticizing
Johnson. 1 must tell you that the
one thing the communists under.
stand and respect is torce, power,
firm will.”

on Student demonstrations, Eis-
enhower felt that they are all right
when they concern domestic policy,
but “when we go into foreign pol.
icy on a current crisis (here I’m
not talking about history or long.
range policy), then i think their
protests had better be through petl~
tion that would reach the highest
executive offices. I don’t recall, ex»
cept in one case, any great picket»
ing of the White House."

In iact, because oi the geograph»
ical layout of the White House,
Eisenhower Saitl, “A Prestdent
goes troin his back apartment over
to the White House without ever
seeing Pennsylvania Avenue for
weeks. Frequently l'tl learn about
picketiiig trom the papers,"

When questioned about whonl he
would support tor the 1968 nomina-
tion, Eisenhower said, “I’ve got a
long list that i haven’t made pub-
lie, but I’ll say this: There’s at
least one man from Iowa who’ll
have to be considered."

Following the questioning period,
Eisenhower thanked the spectators
and inquisitors tor their courtesy
and attention.
