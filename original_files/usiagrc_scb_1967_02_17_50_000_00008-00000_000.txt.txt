SCARLET AND BLACK

 

l. M. Sports

It was an LM. week of

mebacks, upsets, routs, and
roken dreams. The North-Dib-
le contest brought together two
f the top contenders for the
,M. basketball title. Dibble'il
‘A" team led almost all the
way, but never comfortably,
and settled for a narrow four-
point decision.

The Dibble “B" team trailed
by as much as 17 points in

the third quarter but a full-
court press brought a one-point
victory as “Bird-Bod" (Bill

shot with no time left in the
game. The next night, East “B"
led by Derrick Te Paske's
twenty-eight points upset Dibble
for their first loss of the season.

destroyed as they dropped two

Ric MaeDowell

For Ric MacDowell, the in»
mediate challenge is to iron
ou’t this year’s changes through
a shared response of all three
branches of the Grinnell com-
munity. This endeavor must
overcome the distance between
generations. a “gap of ideals
and aspirations."

Social life should be nourish-
ed through individual respect:
we should not passively accept
the "superimposed mold of
personality to which students
are shaped.” Therefore coun~
selors must be freed from rule
enforcement, while the role of
the South Campus head resi-
dent advisers is to be constant-
1y evaluated.

Turning to academic proh-
lenls, MacDowell directed at-
tention to the efforts of large
classes. The reversal of this
trend should provide one of
many discussion topics for stu»
dents who would meet regu-
larly with the curriculum
committee.

Further educational propo-
sals include SGA application
for foundation grants —— a
measure which MacDowell be-
lieves would strengthen In
tcrim or make possible a sec-
ond Encampment, He adds,
work for distinction should is
extended into the sophomore
year, to bridge the gap be-
tween freshman honors and up-
pcrclass independent scholar-
ship. Furthermore, the publica-
tiuns program could be en-
hanced by awarding academic
credit to student editors.

of the problem affect primarily
those students who are involved
in the distribution of drugS, Stu<
dents whose use of drugs is a
personal difficulty would more
likely be dealt with through
"counseling and orherrs
sources."

Misuse of drugs was defined
as use of drugs illegally in
a way that causes severe per-
sonal problems or that results
in large scale distribution, Both
the deans expressed an interest
in handling the problem within
the structure of the college
rather than by involving out-
slde legal authorities.

Dean Thompson qualified the
statement that the use of marl-
juand can lead to addiction,
saying that the distortion of
“time and space preception”
and the loss of inhibitions would
be the Chief causative factors.

Documentation at the state
ment, not included in the re-
lease, originated from The u-
topiates (Concerned with hallu-
cinogens); Drugs and the Mind;
One In Seven (an insight into
student altitudes); and various
pharmacology and psychoneu-
rology journals. Students with
questions are encouraged to
consult the deans.

Hoopsters Reap Usual Luck

By Barry Anconl

The Pioneer basketball team
ventured to Mount Vernon, Iowa,
Saturday night, where the Cor-
nell Rams presented them with
their twentyrsecond consecutlve
defeat, 94—72,

Grinnell was outshot and nut-
rebounded, and featured a slow
offense and confused defense.
A few bad calls on both teams
added spice to a rather dull
defeat,

The treat of the evening was
provided by Bob Watt, who was
otherwise 5 c or e l e s s in the
game. Bob, in a successful ef-
fort to keep the ball in bounds,
went sprawling backwards in-
to the Cornell bench, tipping
it over, and sending the less
nimble Rams toppling into the
front row of spectators,

Other excitement was pro-
vided by “Gunner Dick” Musser,
who fired in eight points in
that final part of many Grin-
nell games reserved for the
scrubs. Helping in the melee
of the final minutes were Greg
Rankin, who blasted out two

points, and Jim Stephens who
subtly dropped in a free toss.
Schreless but sweating alter the
game were Steve Brinfnall,
Dove Dnnahoo and Carl Muller.

Elliott Hibbs' 15 points kept
him in third place in Midwest
Conference scoring, while Mike
Schwartz‘s 5 points dropped him
to fifth place,

to the road again to meet ninth
place Coe tonight.

Swimmer Win, Loss

The Pioneer swimmers spilt
their weekend bill, heating St.
Olaf 54—40 and losing to Carle<
ton 53-42.

The mermen took seven 0-
vents at St. Olaf. Steve Hnltze
won the .ISO-yarrl individual med‘
lay and the ZOO-yard backstroke.
Bill Lontz tuck the Ellyard and
loo—yard freestyles. Ken Adel-
man won the zooyard button
fly and Rich Lance won the
diving. The team of Mike
Woods, Mike Wade, Ken Adela
man and Dave Newman took
the oooyard medley relay.

Three firsts were all the
Pioneers claimed at Carleton.
