SCARLET AND BLACK

David Lighthourne —
letters to Mother

Warren the crooks subterranean apartment
party got off to a predictably fast start when the
host made his enirance with three cases of stolen
beer. Casual and .I had been looking for a Good Life
all day and were in the process or interviewing
Ruga Snell, a recently returned wanderer. No one,
in tact, had seen Ruga since he had quit high school
and taken oh on a motorcycle tor Gallup, New
Mexico. four years ago. Ruga had explained at the
tune that Gallup was the only un»American town
left in the country. Willi that he had roared out of
town that fateful day, goggles, and a black cowboy
hat headlong into the wind. Now, as the morn
filled with pretty girls and a Rolling Stones record
began to play, our conversation continued.

”I believe it was Cervantes who said that all affec-
tations are bad, Ruga. why don’t you take nit that
cowboy hat?”

“Leave him alone, Warren the crock, We're in
the middle of an interesting conversation."

“I know. I just wanted to tell you that Lhere's a

. girl with ratted hair at Llie door who ‘says she's
looking for your friend. Should i let her In?”

”Rock stomp, man. That's my good dolly. Send
her in."

“By the way, Casual, are you ever going to tell
me uho that girl is? You've been putting me off too
long."

“0K. man, but like i can't tell you her name be—
cause she's like related to the new president and
won't tell me of it either. Now, don't tell her I

slipped you the good word, man "

“What do you mean, new president? New president
of what?"

“0! the college, man. They’re gonna announce it
pretty soon. New like excuse me, man, before
Warren trolls over and hustles my dolly. Later."

“That friend oi yours is quite a character. Where
did you ever run into him?"

“You mean Casual? He just drove into town one
day with a carload oi electric guitars and has been
living oil the college ever since. I’d like to find out
What kind of president they've finally decided (in,
but that girl probably couldn't tell me anything
anyway. It's quite a thing, you know, trying to find
a good college president."

“Yeah, I suppose it is. rm waiting for the day
when they start choosing presidents tor their pers-
pective instead of theu‘ business abilities. That’s
the whole problem these days, the way I look at it.
Colleges should be kept as separate irom the rest
of society as possible. There shouldn’t be any kind
of continuity between higher education and pro-
fessions or professional training. Colleges should
point out things like the fact that the cost of living
in our present society is simply too great.”

“I know what you mean, Ruga. but I don't know
it you're right. it all depends on whether you can
find the Good Life inside present society or in some
kind oi fringe society."

“Well, maybe your new president can answer
that."

 

Memphis ‘liberal Cily' Say LeMoyne GrinneIIians

(Ed Note: The ioilowing is the
continuation or a report trom Le-
Moyiio College by Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens, Grinnell students
who are studying at the Memphis
college this semester.)

In spite of its proximity to the

intamy oi Mississippi, Memphis
is a liberal city and most of its
citizens are proud of the pro-
gress which has been made
here. We have experienced only
a iew examples of an ardent
segregationist belief.

Our first encounter was with
a white taxi driver of the stats
ure of Ichabod Crane, who we
asked Without thinking to take
us to LeMoyne College. His imr
mediate reaction, which is still
quite clear in mind, was:
"What do y'all want to go to a
nigger school like that for?“

When coming back to Le
Moyne late one night, we
chanced to catch a bus on
which we were the only two
passengers, The bus driver’s
comments on civil rights ran
like this: “You probably don't
know any niggras. (He recog»
nized our northern accent.)
They're violent people. How’d
.you like to have one for your
boss?"

What do these people have in
common? Fear of a violent, in.
tense people. Pride in a loftier
culture. which means simply a
higher standard of living be-
cause of better economic op-
portunities. Belief in the con-
tention that the Negro is by na-
ture crude, brutal, dirty. base.
dishonest, inferior.

We asked the question, which
to us has an obviuus answer:
“But isn't the turbulence 0f the
Negro a product oi his environ
ment? If he had equal employ-
ment opportunities, wouldn’t it
be different?"

But the obviouit is denied.
Other questions are answered
as if they were being read off
the segregationist ﬂash cards.

 

Throughout the conversation
there is a painfully apparent
lack of reliance upon reason
and tact other than personal
experience. The only defense
offered for segregation is an
irrational emotional appeal and
a vague reference to a habit of
life.

There are other evidences of
segregation in Memphis, how-
ever, Two weeks ago one of the
largest churches in the city, the
Second Presbyterian Church,
with a membership of 3,600 in
wealthy east Memphis, opened
its doors for the first time to a
Negro. The papers reported the
event in the iollowing manner:
“No one seemed to pay any at-
tention to the lone Negro who
was in the balcony." However,
as a direct result of this event,
200 members quit the congrega-

tion to form a fundamentalist
Bible group. It is still to be de-
termined Whether a mixed
group will be allowed to enter
the church. As in this church,
integration in some other
