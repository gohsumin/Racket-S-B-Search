session of (the 1964 Grinnell
Mock Political Convention. He
will also preside over the Demo-

us since it was announced
earlier that Oregon Governor

the Republican session.

Professor C. Edwin Gilmour,
Director of the Program in
Practlcal Political Educatlon,
and the man responsible for the
securing of the services of Mc-
Gee and Hatfield, says he ex-
pects the keynote addresses to
be ”hardhitting and highly
partisan in the best tradition of
keynote addresses." Gilmour

bringing these two pol' 'cians to
ohe Grinnell Campus,

The Presidents of the Young
Republicans and Young Demo-
crats, Bob Savage and Dave
Evans, have made their initial
appointments for the woven
(lion. Tom Evans has been ap-
pointed chairman on the plat
form committee for the Repubr
Iicans, while Jack Spence will
head the same committee for
the Democrats.

This year’s convention will
differ from the Inaugural mock
ﬁolitical convention which was

aid in 1960 in that. this year the
Republicans and Democrats
will present separate platforms.

In the 1960 convention the stu4
dents combined their efforts
and prepared only one plat-
form. About ten per cent of the
student body was involved in
the preparation of the platform
{or the 1960 convention.

Intensive prerconventlon or»
gamzational work will be done
over the interim session. Those
students who are interested ill
working for the Convention are
urged to contact either Dave

During his first year on the
island, he built a 14 foot sloop
rig sailboat. which he christ-
ened ”Si Kuhn” (The Thing.)
It transported all manner of
Robinson's Filipino friends on
squid fishing and skin divmg
expeditions and once dumped
its Peace Corps skipper into
the sea. Thereafter, he was
known as ”Captain Capsize.”
Education, he thinks, is the
most Important factor in the
Filipinos future. He demon-
strated this faith by assuming
financial support of the school-
Ing of three young Filipinos.
“I had wanted a public
health assignment in Afrlca.”
he said, “but I Wound up in the
Philippines — and loved it,”

You? Have To Get Up Early If You
Want To Beat The Hockey Club

By Karen Adkinson

The Gl‘mnell hockey club
specializes in practices at weird
hours. Last year before the
hockey rink was built, they
practiced on Barber Plaza from
11 to 12:30 at night after the
rink closed to the public. Last
week a warm spell forced them
out of bed whlle the ice was
still frozen to begin practice at
6 am,

Hockey devotees. Russ Har-
din and Jerri Langllam, organ-
ized the Club last year.

Jerri recalled, “Russ and I
both played hockey before
coming to Grinnell and
wanted to get something go-
ing our freshman year, but
only ten boys showed any in-
terest in playing hockey. Last
year we really worked and
thirty guys showed up and
continued coming. Mr. Irv
Simone is our faculty spon-
sor and was instrumental in
getting competition for us.
7 We played a Des Moines Club
several times and the fresh-
man squads of Carleton and
St. Olaf."

This year the club is scrim-
maging on a new rink built with
funds allotted by the President
of the College after a request
by the club. BSrG erected the

'rink over the summer and care

for it during the season.
Twenty-five men are out for
the club this year. Fifteen are
returning from last year’s
group,

They were really diligent about
coming out even when they got
discouraged seeing themselves
outskated day after day. Their
progress has really been some-
thing to see.” said Langhaml
Coached by Langham, the
team practices two hours a
day even during finals. The
practices consist of 25 min-
utes of skating around with
a puck. Then the club drills
on plays and practices pass-
ing, receiving passes, shoot-
ing and rebounding. Scrim-
maging follows and finally the
group scrapes the ice to
leave it in good condition.
Referees are garnered from
interested non-club members
such as John Fiske.

Langham. “There‘s not a dull
moment. Any interested spec-
tators Will probably be able
to go on the second trip to
Des Moines. We also hope to
have a couple announced in-
ter-squad Scrimmages so that
students can coma and

He Continued, “I'd like to em-
phasize that the club is a suc-
cess only because of the en—
thusiasm and efforts of all the
boys. They’ve really proven
their interest by sacrificing

sleep and study time to practice
