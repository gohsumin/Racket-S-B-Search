STANDARD

SERVICE

 

F

By Steve Casey

The Pioneer athletic scene has been struck by a
critical controversy over the issuing of letters Do peo-
ple deserve letters by merely participating or must
they meet some standards of performance? This is
something which can be easily overemphasized, but is
a nuisance that must be cleared up Coach Terry Moore
of the wrestling team happened to be the center of the
dispute, but it really could have happened to any of
the coaches.

When Moore was the wrestling coach at Grinnell
for two years after he graduated, the letters were
awarded on the basis of points the wrestler scored He
had to win a certain number to get his letter How-
ever, this was not inflexible: for instance, a senior who
had wrestled for three years with a good attitude
would probably still get a letter even if he was short
of his quota of points, but was straight-forwards

Moore then went to the Peace Corps and came
back after two years to resume his coaching at Grin-
nelll In the meantime Coach Bowers had been the
wrestling coach and had started anew, systemnHe de:
cided to award letters to anyone who stayed with the
team and filled a weight class for the whole year.

When Moore came back he justifiably felt the
wrestlers were still on the same point system that he
had always known at Grinnell. So when the letters
were issued he set the standard at a certain amount of
points and three of the members did not make it so
were not issued letters. After these boys, who were
used to Bowers‘ system, complained, Terry talked with
Coach Bowers and found out what had been happen-
ing.

Although not entirely pleased by the Bowers' sys-
tem, he did not want to make a big issue of it since
he will not be the coach next year. So he awarded the
three letters,

What will happen next year when there will be
another coach? Will it go back to Coach Moore’s sys-
tem or remain as it is? De we want to have fewer but
more first-rate lettermen or more that include people
not so good?

This is something the coaches must decide — and
tell the athletes about. With two new coaches coming
next year to Grinnell, it becomes even more import-
ant Let us hope We never see such misunderstanding
between the coach and players again.

* >i<

Three Pioneer wrestlers, Gary Wilson, Ken Stub-
ler, and John Sharpe, ran into some tough luck when
they traveled to Mankato State for the NCAA small
college wrestling tournament. The faculty athletic rep-
resentative had f ' ed to send 1n the form showing the
three grapplers had th miniiniim grade- point neces-
sary in NCAA competition.

Although the Pioneers had paid their entry fees,
they could not wrestle. Even when President Leggett
telephoned to say the faculty representative had just
made a mistake and the Pioneers were not trying to
imitate the Ivy League, the NCAA representative said
it was too late to do anything,

To Keep Title

The Pioneer track team, after
losing its long control over the con<
ference indoor teams, will also

Cludes seven veterans. The othe‘
nine are sophomores Included in
the sixteen are three men, Bob
Watt, Mike Schwartz, and Dick

is Jeri Langham. Langham won
the no in the loop meet as a sopho<

of four school records from his
junior year. He was a member on
the one mile; sprint medley, two
mile, and distance medley rela‘
teams that hold the school stand-
ards.

This year .Ieri will probably con-
centrate on the 880, the mile, and
the relay teams.
