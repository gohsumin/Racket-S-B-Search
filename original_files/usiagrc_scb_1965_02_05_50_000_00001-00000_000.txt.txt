Drunk Siudeni Fires .22: Booied

By Tom

The discharging of a .22 caliber
revolver in the basement of Lan—
gan hall has resulted in the dis-
missal of the 'student concerned.

Two weeks ago the Langan sen-
Ior became, as he termed it,
“bombed out of my mind" and shot
two holes in the wall of his room.
one in o trash can in the hall, and
one in the ceiling of another stu-
dent's room.

The student had several guns in
his room at the time, none of which
had been registered with the Dean
of Men as prescribed in Article V.
section 3, of the men's house rules.

After the incident, a meeting
was held by the members of Lan—
gan basement and the student was
offered two alternatives, He could
turn himself over to the Men's
Primary Court, or he could hope
that he would get away with the
shootings by using a cover of si-
lence pledged by the meeting of
Langan basement.

The student chose the latter and
the next day he took his guns off
campus and put them in the care
of a friend,

0n the morning of Wednesday,
Jan, 27, 5. Eugene Thompson,
dean of men, went to the student’s
room and stated the lacts that the
dean said he had learned "from a
llalirdozen different sources in the
span of a couple of days."

Dean Thompson told the student
that the Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs would meet that af«
temoon, The dean recommended
that the student begin packing im-
mediately because he wanted the
student out of town that day.

Thompson said that the student
asked for a civil trial where he
could confront his accusel's, but
the dean told him. "Not a chance,
In dismissal it is to the advantage
of all parties concerned to get out
as fast as possible.” The student
was escorted to the bus station
later that evening.

The dean said that he learned of

A Langan hall senior has
been suspended for one month
for appearing in the College
Forum intoxicated and for us-
ing offensive language to the
Forum Director, Mrs. Jewell
Hawk.

The student went to the For-
um last Week in the Company
of several other students, all of
whom apparently had been
drinking, When Mrs. Hawk had
the student escorted out, he be—
gan to use obscene language.

S. Eugene Thompson, dean
of men, termed the incident
“an outrageous way to be-
have." He stated that the sus-
pension came, as all suspen-
sions must, through the Facul-
ty Committee on Student Af-
fairs, and was effective immed»
iaiely, ‘

Thompson said that “there
has been some trouble with
drunks in the Forum.” He
added that the CofHP has pr0<
posed that house presidents be
allowed to handle the problem
by having its members spend
time at the Forum “ushering
out drunks."

“It might help the issue to
have students, rather than non-
students, working on the prob-
lem," Thompson said.

Referring to the suspended
student, Thompson said, “I
don't think he planned the inci—
dent. The student isn‘t a chronic
trouble maker. He just didn't
handle himself well, His sus-
pension is a result of the Whole
affair, not any one aspect."

Saturday is the absolute dealt
line for paying the $3 fee to
have junior and senior pictures
included in the ’65 Cyclone.

Behavior Insliluie
Receives $26,935

Grinnell has received a $26,935
grant from the National Science
Foundation for the Iourth Grinnell

Behavior Science Institute.

Scheduled for nine weeks, the in-
stitute will run from Sunday, June

A science training program in
experimental psychology for high-
ability secondary school students,
the institute will attract approxi-
mately 48 youths who have com-
peted their junior, but not their
senior, year in high school and
who have good backgrounds in sci-
ence and mathematics,

The institute’s purposes are to
identity secondary students who
have potential for becoming sci-
entists, to accelerate their scholar-
1y development through instruction
by scientists of recognized stature,
and to develop cooperation between
colleges and high schools in in-
creasing the quality of education
in the sciences.

Instruction will be offered by
Kent, D. w. Tyler (psychology),
and visiting scientists in seven
courses not normally offered at the
high school level:

“Philosophy of Science and His-
tory of Experimental Psychology,"
“The Experimental Analysis of Be-
havior," ”Introduction to Psycho-
logical Research," “Descriptive
and Inferential Statistics,” “Sen-
sory Processes,” “Physiological
Psychology,” and “The Psychology
of Leaming."

Lectures will be supplemented by
intensive laboratory work and pro-
grammed learning material. Dun
ing the final two weeks of the ses
sion, students will have an oppor-
tunity to execute an independent
study ot their own design,

The first such program in the
country to be supported by the
N.S.F., the Grinnell Behavior Sci-
ence Institute began in 1962 with
a $20,750 NSF, grant and con-
tinued in 1963 and 1964 with awards
of $24,890 and $28,987.

In its rirst three years, the in<
stitute attracted 132 students from
32 of the 50 states.

on Labor Day, Sept. 6

The last day of exams for first
semester will be Dec, 18. The sec-
ond semester will begin J an, 12 af.
ter Christmas vacation, with senior

ministered Jan. 10 and 11. The"
will be no interim period.

No date has been set aside for
the Junior Liberal Arts exam.
Stauss said that continuing study
or the JLA is going on and that ll
the exam is given next year it
will be at the same time as comps.

There will be a two week sprln‘
recess, but no ﬁrm dates (or thh
break have been established.

Commencement exercises will M
held on May 22, Stauss explained
that completing the school year at
this early date might give student!
a break in securing summer Ell'h
ployment.

Under the new schedule, than
will be 14 weeks of classes in tho
ﬁrst semester and my, weeks of
classes in the second term. Tbi‘
amounts to 1% additional old
weeks: the added class time w
take up the slack caused by dropy
ping the interim session.

stauss explained that the interim i

was being dropped because M
faculty feels its disadvantages mu-
weigh its advantages.

Final details of the new calend‘
