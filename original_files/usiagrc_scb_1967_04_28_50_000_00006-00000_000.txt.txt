Folkdanners to present concert

By John When

The Grinneli Foikdancers will miter
their third annual spring program tu-
night at 7 p.m. and Saturday night at
a pm. in Roberts Theatre, The com-
pany at 71 dancers will present a di-
verse program or international dances
representative or at least 14 different
countries,

Mood, style, and costume will vary
from the quiet grace of “At Va'ani" _
I slaw Israeli circle dance performed
by women — to the explosive energy
of “Mazur” — the Polish ﬁnale num-
ber: Spirited, rollicking music will set
the mood of such lively dances as
"Bruder Lustig" and “Shuddlehux” —
of Teutonic origin. On the other hand,
markedly more restrained precision will
characterize the lighter choreography or
the Scottish medley numbers.

Among the special highlights or this
ear's program will be the Castilonean

edding dance “Espunyolet,” the Phil<
lppine “Tinlkllng” danced over,
Iround, and between moving bamboo
poles — and the “Highland Fling,"
which will be accompanied by a guest
bagpiper from the University of Iowa,
The woman “Fool’s Jig” is an his-
torical English morris dance, originally
performed in conjunction with ancient
fertility celebrations in “merrie aids
England."

Scottish kilts, Austrian Iederhosen,
Groutian head scarves, Spanish castaa
nets, and Peruvian masks are among
the many distinctive costumes and
properties which will be used to enhance
both the variety and the individuality
of the dances — as Well as of the dif-

Dear Adrienne Lemnions and David
Dillon,

I am sincerely regrettui or recent
happenings by a group of students,
myselt among them. This group, tea
gether as a group, lost its individual
intellectual competence to make deci-
sions, and thus proceeded in a die
graceful manner. You two will certain-
ly get over the events before we do,
tor we have ourselves always present.

The rollowiug lo a statement by the
interim Court explaining their deci»
sion in the case involving David Dil-
Ion, Adrienne Lemmons, and ﬁve
Cowiea null members.

The Student Interim Court, in
recommending the renewing penal-
ties, tound it impossible to consider
this case and the actions on “Spring
Riot Night" b the ﬁve male students
as an isolate incident. We found it
necessary to consider this incident in
the context or recurrent behavior over
a number or years. The court exam-
ined not only specific testimony deal-
ing with this case, but also bacic
gmund material.

It was recommended that two stu—
dents receive conduct probation which
carries a ritten notification ot snelsi
irmponsi lity to college and student
adm tnators and to parents or the
ind idudi, It is intended to be a time
or positive reevaluation of the indi-
vidual and his relation to the commu-
nity. to this case the conduct or the
individuals will be reviewed by the
court in the middle of next semester.

it was recommended that three
students (one at whom will also re

oeive conduct probation) receive so»
cral expulsion which carries a con-
sure by the student court concern~
ing the individual's antisocial beho—
viorr It is intended to be a social pun-
ishment hopefully with little academ<
lo repercussion. The students in this
case will arrange to take finals and
comprehensive examinations n w a y
from the community.

Expulsion was recommended for
one student because of the gravity or
this incident and because of recurrent
antisocial behavior in complete nppo<
sition to the goals and standards in-
ward which the college strives

The court reels that the community
of Grinnell cannot tolerate anti-social
behavior or a destructive and malici-
ous nature, When an individual in-
fringes upon the rights and freedom
of others through physical and psycho-
logical brutality, he should be se-
verely censured. The court sincerely
hopes that as a result or its recom-
mendation, a period or critical evaiu<
ation will ensue not only for the stu-
dents involved, but also tor the com-
munity as a whole.

lic apology for the events at ”Spring

humiliation. I sincerely regret those
acts, and now promise the Gl‘innell
College community as a whole that they
will not Ieoceul'.

Dale Massey

To whom It may concern,

I publicly wish to apologize to both
David Dillon and Adrienne Lemmons
for any role I played ’ their harass-
ment "Spring Riot Night." I would
also like to apologize to the men of

owlﬁ Hall who have had In) endure
thoughtless actions on my part during
the past three years. Having reevalu-
ated my attitude toward others, I hope
to improve myself and to become I
more Worthwhile member of the oom«
