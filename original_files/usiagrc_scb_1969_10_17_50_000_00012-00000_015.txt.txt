was knocked to the ground and kicked

in the neck. When assistant counsel
Zucker attempted to come to his aid, he,
too, was attacked before police arrived
and subdued the Weathermen. Elrod, a
close personal friend of Mayor Daley,
was taken to a hospital immediately,
where it was later announced that his
neck was broken and that he was para—
lyzed from the neck down.

The fighting lasted about 15 minutes,
principally in the three block area on
Madison between LaSalle and State.

Some demonstrators managed to avoid the
police by merging with the crowds that

jammed the street corners. Others fled
the area or boarded buses and subways.

A total of more than 180 demonstrators

were arrested. Over 30 policemen were

injured.

Relatively little material damage oc—
curred. Aside from the Railway Express
window, only the large plate glass front
of Maxim's Restaurant and a handful of
small shop and car windows were broken.
A large brick was hurled at a window of
the 1st National Bank, but it only chip—
ped the glass.

By 2:30 police were attempting to
clear the area. "All persons move out
of this area," announced one officer.
"If you do not do this, you are violat-
ing police orders and will be arrested."

As the streets cleared, a Weatherman
leader walked down the sidewalk, unnot—
iced by the police. "We're not fin—
ished yet," he said. "If you see any
of our people, tell them groups of twos
and threes. " ‘
