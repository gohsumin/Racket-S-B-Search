New Head Waitress, Waiter Reign;
0am] Welcomes Georgia and Greg

By Pam Clay

, April 8th saw two new
people In control of the Quad
tuning room. Actually they are
not new to any of us; Georgia
Mickey and Greg Mace have
lbeen working into their new

gobs for months, and on April
they took over by them-
.elves. Sue Carpenter and Lar-

y Skogerson have been re-
Enquishing their duties and

elping the new head waiter
nd waitress get the feel of be-

g in command.

Sue, commenting about her
former job as head waitress,
told, ”The head waitress is re-
sponsible for all the waitress-
es; she has to make out the
Ichedule, do the payroll, and
try to keep people happy at
the same time.” Though she is
only responsible for working
lerved meals, Sue explained
that she always feels respon-
sible tor the Quad dining room
and is always aware of her re-
Iponsihilities.

“We (Larry and herself)
mostly watch to see how peo»
ple work, what their attitude is,
and correct any mistakes Ac-
tually, I work for Saga rather
than the college,” she said,
“We are mediators between the
student workers and Saga; it
is a middle-supervisory posi-
tion. Once you have the job you
can’t get away from it. People
come to you with their prob-
lems; they expect you to know
What is for dinner, who works
Where and why, etc. it is im-
possiblel But it is only as much
work as you make it~and it is
fun!”

“Two things bother me,"
Ihe laughed, ”Sometimes peo-
ple brush past me and say,
“Excuse me, Georgia! 1 hope
I have not lost my identity that
much, Birthday cakes are just
one of the crosses I bear; one
is okay, but when there are
three the same night. it is
Work!"

Larry Skogerson also had a

 

few things to say about his life
at the Quad. Something diners
don’t often realize is the job
he and Al Murray have of co-
ordinating between the kitchv

en and the dining room, The
food gets in and out pretty
fast sometimes!

”Of course, we work during
Commencement w e e k and
alumni weekend,” he said. “It
is especially fun to work when
the alums are here because
they have lots of memories to
bring up.” Larry is storing up
a tew memories of his own: it
seems that when he was a
sophomore, the lights went out
in the midst of a formal din-
ner. “It was not bad in the
dining room ‘since it was a
candlelight dinner,” he
laughed, “but it was not too
good in the kitchen—and it is
a good thing they came on be-
fore we had to wash dishes!
What peeves me? I guess it is
when people reserve a table
and don't come!”

Everyone agreed that there
is no formal training program
for the new head waiter and
waitress. It is mostly gradual-
ly letting them do the work and
get accustomed to the routine
so they are aware if a problem
or irregularity arises; it is ac-
quiring a feeling for the job.

Greg is looking forward to
his job as a good experience
in organization and human re-
lations. “As a character build»
er it will make me or break
me!” he joked, “The frustratv
ing thing is that we don’t real-
ly do anything with our hands.”
Greg did mention a few vices
Commonly noted in the Quad:
“They (the girls) wander
around on cloud nine at any
cafeteria meal and haven’t the
dimmest recollection of the
seating plan. And all that com-
plaining about a long line!
There are Continual little crises
——llke waiters not showing up
and dishes breakingibut the
job is actually a labor of love
and marvelously stimulating."

 

Georgia has numerous small
details to occupy all her spare
time. Hair nets, no crumbs,
clean tables, etc... are very Irn-

portant for a smooth running,
disciplined dining room, and to
preserve an image of gracious
living.

Georgia agreed that most’of
their training is just the con-
stant awareness that occurs
through practice and familiar-
ity. Her peeves were, “the con-
stant complaining about the
long line. . . .., they have no
idea of the breakfast seating
arrangement. . . ., and com-
plaining to me about the food—
which does absolutely no
good!"

In spite of the “hardships"
all four enjoy their work in
