Ford Describes
Republican Role

By Pam Clay

House minority leader Ger-
ald Ford spoke via telephone
to the Grinnell Young Repuhli
cans Wednesday on "The John-
son Legislation —— A Republi~
can Alternative,"

Ford Said that the Republi-
cans in the legislative branch
are raced with overwhelming
opposition in Congress and
awesome strength in the execu-
live.

He enumerated five respone
sibilities of the minority party:
1) exert its influence in both
branches of Congress for the
Republican goals of freedom,
national security, and peace;
2) support the Democratic ad-
ministration When we think it
is right and oppose it when we
think it is Wrong; 3) point out
any failures of the Democratic
administration: 4) continue and
expand our efforts for a strong
two party system; 5) work to
maintain and expand unity in
the Republican ranks.

A major innovation is the
Task Force System on a ma-
jor scale—vworking on research
in depth on agriculture, voting
rights, education. etc. It aims
toward long range solutions to
national and international
problems.

Representative Ford stressed

that the Republican Party‘s in-
fluence ”must be not only per-
sistent oppositioanhis is too
narrow and limited." An ex-
ample oi Republican backing
of an administrative position
is the agreement on the policy
for Viet Nam. The Republicans
agreed with the stepped up ac-
tion and the refusal to with-
draw. “There is a big differ—
ence in defense on the United
States ten yard line rather than
the enemy's."
, Republicans have offered al-
ternatives to several adminis-
trative programs, including
that on Federal Aid to Educa-
tion and Medicare The Repub-
lican alternative to Medicare
has already been recognized
as better by the Committee on
Ways and Means. In this case
the administration is on the de-
fensiv .
