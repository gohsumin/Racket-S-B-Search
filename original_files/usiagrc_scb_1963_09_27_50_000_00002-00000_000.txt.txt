Widely publi /.ed through all the l‘l‘lld‘
west news media, this is the type of Stile
dcllt action that has an immediate and last,
ing’ effect on tllat nebulous force termed
the “Grinnell image.”

However, is this the type of activity
that we would like to present as charaete
lstic oi‘ the Grinnell student body?

Given the supposed above average in—

telligence alid maturity ol‘ the Grinnell stun ’

dent, do we want the “public to see and
come in contact with this pa ticular small
group of studrnts and ti ouch them colnc

to belive tllat here is a true representation ,

ol‘ the ivllole college”?

Our answer a resounding YES! ’l‘li'
is exactly the l lid of responsible action,
intelligent organ tion, and active concern
for the rights at lnall that we would like
to see become automatically assoc ated with
Grinnell and its student body whenever
they receive public mention,

We applaud the Grinnellians who w 'e
active participants ill this demonst iition
of sympathy and respect for human beings
and their rights and hope that the p: 'tlcu-
lar facet of the “Grinnell Image” which
they have helped to develop will continue
to grow and actually become the core of

Grinnell College and all it represents

Problems 01‘ Jrhe 'ln Loco Parern’rs' Theory

Oberlin, Carleton, and Grinnell. These
v'ere three ol the schools whose students
took deep, probing locks last year at their
lespectire college rules.

At Carleton the students debated open
rooms, women’s hours, chapel requirements,
and misuse of the student press. At Ober-
'l the emphasis was on open dorms. At
Grinnell women's hou open dorms, the
schola ip repayment rule, the car rule.
'sexnal misconduct, alld the liquor rule were
all debated.

While the pii'ticnlar rules discussed at
these schools varied, the underlying theme
was a deliberate student challenge of the
age old college operating- theory of “in loco
parentis."

Is the college responsible for the stil-
dents in the absence oi" the parents? It' so,
to what degree are they responsible? These
Questions are difficult til answer. While
we'd like to jump in and say, “01" course
‘tiie college shouldn't be responsible for the
actions of each student,” we can’t. We
realize all too well that plessure has been
exerted upon President Bowen to take the
parental responsibilitle. il‘or many students
i.t Grinnelliespecially in the case of par-
ents who send their children to Grinnell
with the understanding. that this institution
will provide a home-like atmosphere and
discipline '

However, there are others. There are
the parents who say, “You’re on your own
now, my boy (or daughterh” And then

these parents send their children off to
Grinnell wllere they are far from on their
own.

Thus the school of thought which preA
scribes to “in loco parentis” is incompatible
with the “student independence" school.

Statingr the problem is easier than stilt-J

ing‘ the resolution. Some of the most vocal
groups on the Grinnell campus believe that
their individual freedoms are being denied
by the present rules, while on the other
hand the most vocal group of parents and
alumni seclll to think Grinnell is turning
into some kind of haven for beatnll
immoral sinners.

This “hole discussion of‘ the incompati-
bil y of the two schools of thought, ill loco
palentis as opposed to complete student in
dependence, has posed a threat to the whole
theory of a residence college. Currently,

Grinnell has students from more than half)

the states and several foreign counties.
If campus discussions are any indication,
these students have failed to .iell illto a
homogeneous society in which the student
from the socially liberal home lives happily
along‘ side his more conservative neighbor.
We feel that if Grinnell is going to at-
tain the spirit of the college community
which ascribes to, it is 'oing to have to
convince its backers that immorality doesn't
start with a couple alone in a student’s
rooln, and that it will have to make more
of a provision [or individual freedom.

Students So are (as!)

in early August or this year, the United
States National Student Association invested $15.7
000 in the purchase or a boni: cooperative This
cooperative h ~ operated independently [or [he
lust two years at the University oi Chicago under
l'ae titlc “Inlernational Student Cooperative
Union " The purpose of the err-0p is to provide
books to member students at about a we; rer
ductioli in price,

Stores will be operated ior the coming year at
the Univc _ y oi Chicago. Northwestern, the
,University at Illinois and the University of Mich-
igan. All other schools which are members or
USNSA will participate through mail orders.
Any student at a school which is a member of
U'SNSA is automatically 'h lllemlier’of the coop»
erative and has iull privileges in its use

The procedures involved are relatively sim-

ple. A student or organization sends an order
to one or the coop stores, which then processes
the order and sends out the proper books. The
student pays the full price with his order.
but at the end or each Ilirec-manlh pcriml. he
will receive at least :4 10% rebate on all books
purchased in Hunt quarter. Time spent inimi-
eessl g orders is cut to n minimum by the ex-
ten ‘ a use or IBM equipment. ‘

, 10‘75~ rebate is sent out. This. delay willrbev

Books from all publishers in the United States
may be purchased. There is also a roulrnciurul
relationship with TimerLlic publishers and with
several record distributors, Negotiations are
presently under way whh other publishels tn
the magazine field and with Several record cont
panics The goal of the cooperative is m inure
any book, magazine, or record available [0 incl“-
ber students at reduced prices.

It is not expected that Gllrlnell students will,

buy the great majority oi their books through
the cooperative as long as our orders have to
be processed through the mall There is an un.
avoidable time period before receipt oi the or-
dcr, and an additional period of time bctore [he
ceptable to some. “

A certain number of confirmed browsers will
also remain nlooi from the program, finding
tlleJlappy hours spent in front oi shin VVossom's
book shelves more important than any old 10%
reduction in publisher's price

Nevertheless, this service should prove useful
to many Grinnell students and oi'ganizalions
