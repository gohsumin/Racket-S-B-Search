Throughout the first quarter

the Grinnell defense. After
twelve minutes Wheaten scored
on an indirect penalty kick,
Grinnell got its only shot of the
first quarter after nineteen
minutes. '

In the middle of the second
quarter Grinnell’s offense be-
gan to operate, A little after
a Wheatdn shot Went off the
post, Vince Anku just missed
a goal on a near breakaway,
Late in the quarter Anku
scored when be‘raced to the
goal and kicked the ball past
the diving goalie,

As the second half started,
Grinnell just missed a goal
when a Wheaton defenseman
made a save after the goalie

had been faked out of position.
Then Wheaten came back and
scored when the Grinnell de-
ferlsemen went into a tempor-
ary lapse and watched Wheat-
on retake the lead. Wheaton
also added an insurance goal
just before the third quarter
ended.

This war. the most skillfully
played game that Grinnell fans
have seen this year. Wheaten
had a tough defense that
ganged up on Vince Anku and
kept him from getting the ball
too much. In turn Grinnell kept
Wheaton’s big offensive men
from getting the short easy
shots that are nearly impos-
sible for the goalie to stop.

 

ed incidents of brutality. foul
play, and unsportsmanlike con»
duct seem to have placed the
future of 1M football in jeopar-
dy. The questions which seem
partciilariy relevant to the is-
sue are: To what extent are
these incidents representative
of the whole program? Are these
reports! in fact, exaggerated?
Dr. 3., could you give us some
indication on the faculty attitude
towards this issue?

Dr. B: Well, I definitely think . . .
uh, in my position, as i see it
. . r gee, as an interested observ-
er . . . actually, the facts seem
to have eluded me. The last time
I saw a game was in 1948.

Playboy: Some inferences have
been made regarding insider
quately trained and underpaid
reierees to be the seat of the
problem. Cliff, as a professional
referee, is there any Validity in
(his allegation?

Cliff: Whaddaya mean inadequate
ly trained? I know a football
when i see one. As for compen-
sation, my 50c a game is put-
ting me through college

Playboy: Fred, is the brutality
and unsportsrnanlike conduct
really as prevalent as reports
indicate?

Fred: Duh, yeah, you betchem
Red Rider, Some nasty bended
my pinkyi Then some poor sport
called me a “science tools”

Playboy: Duane, do you think these
apparently isolated reports fairy
1y reflect or typify the program
as a whole?

Duane: N0.

Playboy: Now the all important-
question: Wilfred, should IM
football be banned?

Wilfred: Football band? Yeah, I
