Coed Reports from Morgan State

Institute for Political Education

To the Editor:

Many Grinnellians are un-
aware ol the unique institute
tor Political Education at Mor»
gan State College in Baltimo e,
Maryland, where I am a v' t-
ing scholar {mm Grinnell this
year.

The Institute for Political
Education attempts to interest
the Morgan campus, which is
predominantly Negro, and the
community in practical politics.
Twenty Institute scholars, in-
cluding tour oi us visiting from
other schools, participate intenr
slvely in the program for one
year. All of us receive Ford
Foundation scholarships.

in our regular workshops
lasting two hours every Tues-
day afternoon we discuss topa
ics ranging from political boss»
ism to national elections, and
always devote some time to the
perennial question “What has
happened of political signifir
cance since last We met?” In-
dividual assignments take one
hour each week and often conr
sist oi clipping newspapers, In
addition, We have been to
Washington and Annapolis (the
capital of Maryland), lectured
at public schools, worked dur~
iiig the election, and helped plan
other Institute programs.

Campus activities oi the lnsti-
tute Lhis year have included a
mock Presidential election, a
presidential election prediction
contest, a political birthday
party for
voting age in 1965, and speak
or: including Nicholas Katzenr
back, Carl Rowan, and the two
Senatorial candidates in the
last election from Maryland.

The Morgan community,
spread Out over Baltimore be
cause about 2/3 of the approxi-
mately 3,000 students commute,
is hetereogeneous, Morgan stu-
dents are often older than Grin-
nell students, Many of them
have been in the service, or
have worked before coming to
college. They come from vari-
ous socio-eoonomic classes, and
many of them come from over
seas.

Race, as at Grinnell recently
(according to the many letters
and articles in the SEKB de-
voted to it), is often a topic of
conversation, popping up in

classes. in the canteen, in the ‘

dorms, virtually any time or
place, Sometimes the question
seem to be belabored all nau-
seuni (“If only . , ."), but a
problem Can’t be solved by ior-
getting about it, and this prob-
lem certainly can’t be forgotten
at a predominantly Negro col-
lege.

As a white student here I’ve
had no traumatic problems, but

I can't say that I haven’t gone
nirough some changes. No
amount of open - mindedness
could prevent my feeling a bit
self-conscious. at first, of my
high social visibility. But after
a short while I became so used
to it that on my first exper-
iences in predominantly white
groups I could not help but
think of Howard Zinn’s com-
ment: “My God, What are all

Through my experiences
here as a visiting scholar with
the Institute for Political Edu-

cation, l have gained not only-

a deeper understanding of the
racial situation in America, but
also some insight into practical
politics, and spent a productive
and worthwhile year.

To the Editor:

With all the recent construction
of new buildings and facilities at
.Grinnell College, it is amazing to
‘me that the old white building
and its enclosed swimming pool
remains in existence. The pool
was built as years ago by the
United States Army as a tempo-
rnry structure in order to train
soldiers.

Having been a member of the
iGrinnell swim team, I remember
the pool's “all or nothing” heat-
ing with temperatures either on
or 100. I remember the quality of
the stagnant air in the “white
house” with 100 per cent humid-
ity and the chlorine odor, I re-
member the splinters on the sales
or my tea: tram the bleacher area
floors i remember the crowded
shower rooms and dressing areas
With no locker facilities. I rememr
her the walls with the paint peel—
ing nit irnm the humidity i re
member the plastic storm win-
dows flapping loosely allowing the
cold wind to whistle through the
building. With these thoughts lin-
gering in my mind, i recently visA
