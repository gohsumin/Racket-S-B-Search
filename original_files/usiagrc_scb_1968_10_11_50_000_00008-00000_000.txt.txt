HAWKEYES OVER UNDERGRADS

GRAY MATTE

By BILL GRAY

What with the World Series
and the football gnmes on Sat-
urday and Sunday and the im~
pending Olympics, it is becom<
ing increasingly easy to sit
around and allow sports activ-
ity to come to us.

It is with pleasure, ihereloro,
that we take note of the I. M.
season as it. moves vigorously
through the bracing iall air and
towards its logical conclusion:
indoor sports and the time when
we Will no longer look like
pmnes when we finish our 1. M.
ICtiVlty’.

I noticed that the Off-Campus
team decided that it lacked
competition from the other halls
and, therefore, played a team
made up of faculty members.
This is a good way to pick up
brownie points provided, of
worse, that you don't win.

Upsets were in the making
last week although calling them
upsets is not really doing them
instice. When some of these
teams win, it makes the part-
ing of Lhe'rRed Sea pale in com
yarison. I was informed, prior
to the Clark game, that the
Read machine was ready to
roll again. it then proceeded to
lose to a team that exhibited

little more than the ability to
field eight men Loose and West
cagily held Dibble to 1130th
victories by forfeiting at half<
time, making the official score
1-0.

East defeated West 13-7 in
the annual Goldfish Bowl thus
giving rise to the question of
whether other bowl games of
yesteryear would continue. For
example, who would gain pos-
session of the coveted toilet
neat when Dibble played Smith
In the Toilet Bowl: would South
again beat North in the Animal
Cracker Bowl; and would Raw-
ion top Langan iii the Finger
Bowl? Only time can answer
these questions, which have
bothered men for centuries.

Hockey Knockers
By CINDY ROOT

For two weeks the girls’ field
hockey team has been rela-
1ively idle (which seems to be
the way most people around
here get in shape) preparing
for the match with Graceland
coming up this weekend. These
two weeks of drills and scrim-
mages (attended by the people
who need them least) have
spotlighted the typical Grin-
neli attitude toward sports
(etc?).

A person who could actually
enjoy working, suffering to im-
prove himself, who could ain-
cerely be interested in helping
others reach this goal with him,
must really be screwed upi
Doesn't he know life is a joke
where you try to get away with
all you can, remembering that
it's a lot easier for one to slip
through a hole in the fence than
two. Why, when you can ration-
alize that getting through the
fence is just a lark anyway,
then you don‘t even have to feel
inadequate or a failure, if you
don't make it through (pretty
safe!)

Well, when half a hockey
team (whoops "interest
group”), won’t give what is
necessary for caring, they are
slowly injecting the poison that
weakens a team. At Grinnell
there is World full of people
who have different feelings about
things from mine; that’s great,
that's exciting, but what are
they doing on the hockey field!

DEFEATED 2-0

The Cornell game, played on
a wet, slippery field, was a fine
team effort, according to Coach
John Hemingway. Grinnell’s fine
conditioning showed up often as
the Pioneers overtook their cp-
ponents from behind.

Bruce Graham scored his
fourth goal of the season, re-
taining the team lead. Tom Lin-
coin came through with his first
goal for the other tally, Tom
and Dave North scored assists
and Dim Ferber, Steve Hirsh-
born, Bill Wedding, and Ken
Labowitz put in very fine per-
formances on the slick field.

Sunday, the Pioneers showed
tremendous stamina and fortl.
tudo as U of l edged them 3-2
in the closing minutes.

The Pioneers bore down from
the start. They worked in two
goals before the half on scores
from Steve Korstad (his sec‘
0nd) and Ken Labuwitz (hll
first). The Hawkeyes fought for
one tally before half.

Iowa battled back, working in
for shots with extremely fine
ball handling. Their biggest
strength was in midfield Nu<
merous times they worked in
for shots, only to be stopped by
fullback: Mike Eaton or Bill
Wedding or by a spectaculiar'der
fensive save by goalie Dave
Coron. Finally in the last 10

'minutes the Pioneers, worn by
nearly 180 minutes of soccer in
two days, were outdistanced as
the Hawkeycs scored a goal to
capture the victory.

Bruce Graham, Dave North,
and Marly Wics also played e
fine gamei Dave picked up his
4th assist to lead the squad

Tomorrow the Pioneers host
Carleton in their final home
stand of the season. Coach
Hemingway expects a tough
game. Carleton is strong on
passing, but he feels his PIDv
neers have consistently shown
fine team work and with mini-
mum injuries and a little rest
they will be ready.

To Lead League

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Ripon grabbed the number
one spot in the conference last
Saturday. Aiter beating the Pio<
neers 41-14, they became the
only team to boast an unde<
tented, untied record. (Cornell
was defeated by Monmouth.)

Considering theso facts (and
adding a bit of optimism), care-
ful analysis of the statistics
show that our team didn’t do
nearly as badly as the final
score indicated. In the first
half, we made nine first downs
to their three. By removing just
three plays (hreakaways for
over seventy yards each), the
rushing and passing yardage
statistics an! equal. of course,
we can’t merely neglect those
three bad defensive plays, but
considering t h e m separately
does help explain why Coach
Bowers called our effort “the
best game we've played.”

The offensive line finally got
going in this game and gave
not only pass protection but also
was able to “fire out" and
open holes for ground yardage
(145 yards). Rey Lewis, Brian
Barnes, and Jon Busweli all
looked good carrying the ball.
Brian played his best game so
for both defensively and offen<
lively, and Jon, as well 54 fi-

nally getting some chances ta
carry the ball, made quite a
few key blocks. Gary Jones did
a good job catching some im.
portant passes for critical first
downs, as well as pulling in a
twenty-seven yard touchdown
pass from Gary Johnson. Tom
Lower, who played n great
game, caught Johnson's other
touchdown pass (seven yards).

The most serious problems
we had all day were the in.
juries (which could also be a
factor tomorrow), The most
popular injury of the day
seemed to center around the
knees—of the five received, Al
Clouds is the most serious. He
will be out for at least a couple
of weeks. There are also rui-
mots of bad referee calls
(mainly led by Steve Hutchings,
who was thrown out before half-
time).

The most encouraging aspeol
of the whole game was that the
Pioneers finally began to work'
together as a team There were
still quite a few mistakes, but
we seem to ba ieaming (we
didn't lose any fumblesl). To~
morrow we play a team the!
has ti record similar to bum
Knox will be tough, but If Iaal
week can be seen as an indica-
tion of progress, we could win
