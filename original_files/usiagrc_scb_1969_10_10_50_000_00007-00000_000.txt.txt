iCARLET AND HACK

 

Dissident welfare recipients file in to the Wisconsin Assembly chambers to voice grievances.

old democratic process seemed
to be rolling along. Hope for
communication was hanging
there. A large number of stu—
dents were cooperating to give
the system a. chance. And
slaves to the system were fi-
nally going to be heard.

Thanks to a Representative
'Alionsi, that moment of hope
game to a crashing end, as the
legislator moved to adjourn the
session Despite an overpower-
ing verbal vote of nay, the
chair ruled the meeting die—
missed.

It was as it the legislators
were eireid to express them-
selves in front of the people
they were controlling: they got
neared and ran. It was their
action that turned a chance for
hope in the system and com<
munication into nothing but a
trustrated confrontation. The
legislature made the choice to
make the meeting a confron-
letion situation and not a
Chance for communication.

Why they made that decision

is the ugliest part or the deal:
Thousands of people is a rather
intimidating situation. Don’t
deal with them with reason,
of course, the only control is
possible by bringing in moo

oifensive when the people you
represent enter your sacred
quarters, Also, welfare people
are at your mercy and have
no right to assert themselves.
And anyway, any time you have
students involved, there is no
reason to listen

The legislators could not see
past these immediate problems
and the recent hatred for dis~

situation and their real chance
to do a service to their state
by listening. It is this short-

as possible, “It’s important for
the student body to use this
day for constructive and mean-

said freshman Barry Ziges,
chairman of the committee
“Ending the war in Vietnam
is the most important task
facing America today, and it
is necessary for everybody to

are supponing the Moratorium
on “business as usual," Classes
have been oiiieially cancelled
at Boston University, University
of Oklahoma, Bard College, and
other schools across the nation.

President Leggett has en-
dorsed a statement to the efiect
that “an early end to the Viet-
nam war is urgent national bus-
int-355." The statement has been
signed by numerous college and
university presidents in con-
junction with the Vietnam Mor-
etoriuni. The statement
speciﬁes that the presidents are
endorsing it as individuals, not
as representatives oi their ins
etitutions.

The Vietnam Moratorium has
been endorsed by the student
senate, the Grinlieii Student
Movement, and the see.

Moratorium planners say that
October 15 is only a beginning.
“The idea is that if there is
no change in national Vietnam
policy, a twoday Moratorium
is planned in November, a
three-day one in December, and
so on until the war ends.” zigas
explained.
