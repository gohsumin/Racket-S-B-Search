search in collaboration with
faculty members.

3. To provide specialized re-
search and teaching facilities
which have previously been
impossible because of the lack
of space. These special facili-
ties, 'in addition to the green-
house, will include a "hot” lab-
oratory for working with radio-
active materials, and a con-
stant - temperature laboratory

expand into the area vacated
by the physics department.

“The total science facilities
will be fully air—conditioned
when the project is completed,"
Mr. Stauss noted, “It will pro-
vide space for future faculty in-
creases in each department,
and will permit each faculty
