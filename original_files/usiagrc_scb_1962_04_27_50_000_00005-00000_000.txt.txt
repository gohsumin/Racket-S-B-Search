Diamondmen lost to Cornell lwicef
to face Monmouth and Knox here .

the second game, and hold on to
take a 6-4 victory.

A walk, Phil King's single,
and an error scored _the Pioneer
run in the first inning. Dick
Fisher's single in the second
drove in two more runs. The
final Pioneer tally was scored
in the third on two walks. a
fielder's choice, and two wild
pitches,

Coach Edd Bowers said,
“When you get out hit 134
and 10-5 you can’t expect to
win," Looking ahead, Bowers
said, “We are not out at the
championship race by any'
means. We will he ‘in good
shape if we heat Monmouth
and Knox this weekend." He
pointed out poor hitting and
base running as the Pioneers‘
weak spots in last Saturday's
game.

Today at 3 pm the Pioneers
play Monmouth. Tomorrow at 1
pm. they take on Knox. Both
are home games.

The organization of the Spring
riot Wednesday night disorgan-
ized the Women’s swimming lMs
by removing all the audience
the show might have had, one
timer, and two swimmers. The
audience isn‘t terribly vital, the
timer was easy to replace, but
the swimmers’ absenses may
have seriously changed the re-
