Commencement Disruptions Reviewed Six Trustees Are E'ected

To New Terms On Board

Following student disruptions
or lost May's commencement
ceremony, President Leggett
has asked SGA President
James Lew to appoint a strident
committee as soon as possible
to begin planning early for next
year's commencement actiVit-
ies.

“One at the duties oi the
committee would be to poll
seniors as to who they wont

to speak at commencement,"
Leggett said last week,

Last May's Celemony was iii-
teri-upted several times by dISr
lideiil Students who delivered
unscheduled speeches that Crib
lcized Gi‘ii‘iiiell’s educational
program and protested the
Awarding oi an honorary Doctor
at Humane Letters degree to
Curtlss W. Tarr. new assistant
lecretary oi the Air Force.

shortly atter the honorary de—
gree was conierred on Tarr by
President Leggett, sophomore
i. Theodore (Ted ) Glick leaped
to the speaker's platiorm to
present Tart with what he
called a “Doctor oi Inhumane
Letters degree, in recognition

of your iuture immoral work
as assistant secretary of main
power for the United States Air
Force."

Gllck's appearance drew
icers irom some oi the 1,000
parents and alumni present.
Leggett led Glick cit the plate
iorin as shouts of "Get him
out oi there" and “Drag him
away” rose from the crowd oi
parents and alumni.

Eight oi the graduating
seniors walked out at the cere-
mony alter Torr received his
degree. They returned several
minutes later, strode onto the
platiori-n, and stood silently as
senior Dan Cheitetz harangucd
the audience about “the Wi'DtigA
side priorities of the Gi‘ililiell
education." Cheifetz, too, was
booed and jecretl by some in
the audience.

Cheitetz also awarded I
“Doctorate oi Lite” to senior
Bonnie Tinker, whom the col-
lege retused to give a degree
because she would not take the
required comprehensive ex-
umination in theater. Miss
Tinker wrote a 23-page critique
of the comprehensive examin-
ation program in place oi her
exam.

Miss Tinker picketed the
commencement ceremony and
also made some unscheduled
remarks when Cheifctz intro-
duced her: After the ceremony,
she explained that she was pl'n<
testing “an educational system
that reduces education to con-
ditioning, which equates intel-
Iectual doubt with moral neu-
trality, and which reinscs to
actively participate in the
world."

More than one-third oi the 255
graduates and numerous pro.
iessors wot-e white armhands
over their black gowns to
symbolize their opposition to
the war and the awarding of
a degree to Tarr. The wives
or two faculty members

picketed the ceremony with
signs saying, “Griiinell College
honors another cog in the war
machine."

u. 5. Senator l-iarola Hughes
(Dem., la.) delivered the come
mencement address, in which
he called tor "a continuing
dialog between the older and
younger generation” and slip-
ported students’ rights “To
lawiul, non-Violent protest."

“The vast majority oi dis-
senting students do not want
to destroy the American dream,
they want to redeem it,”
Hughes said.

H u g h e s condemned insur-
rection and illegal Violence by
protesters, but warned that
“the argument that the only
way to maintain order is to club
the innocent along with the
guilty is both ialse and danger-
eous," .

The senator also told the
graduates: “Truly eiicctive
social and institutional change
will occur only from the appli-
cation of trained intellect,
spurred on by commitment and
guided by the values of liberal
learnhig’."

When he is done, he wipes
his mouth and heads ior the
Forum where he reminisces
sadly about days oi yore (last
semester) when some sou stu<
dents signed a petition asking
ior changes in the bookstore,
when a committee of Students
and taculty locked hands and
danced around Bui‘liiig Ba5e<
meiit singing,

“Well, there's a change
in tlle weather,
a change in the sea . .

and when even the President
conceded that tlieie was indeed
something rotten in Carnegie
Oiii' hero duly notes that today
the charismatic Mr. Wassom is
Still siruttm out the Same old
stuti and that the new store
that was to have been btilt‘
downtown this past summer
malliiesied itsell only in Gt‘iil-
ilell folklore.

What exactly happened? Well,
as Mr. Moore concisely sum-
med it up, “Nothing." Why
didn’t anything happen?
Well..uinm....er. uh maybe ’it

had something to do with the
astronauts. And what‘s going to
happen? Well, u'see this com-
mittee member is going to get
in touch with another Commit-
tee member and then KA-
POWIEH More meetings. The
rumor is that something is de-
iinitely going to happen next
semester, Of Course that’s all
old rumor; J. B. Grinnell start-
ed it many years ago.

Anyway, while we are im-
patiently awaiting whatever we
are impatiently awaiting, be it
known that you will have no
better luck iindmg a book this
year than you did last yecr .
less it's a text and ill some
cases even‘ii it is a text.
