the lounges and ioggia all night,
and vice versa," as one parent
envisions, is not necessarily true.
First, certainly the loggia could
be locked as it is now at 10:30
or 12 pm. and the women could
leave and enter through Main
door, signing in and out to in-
dicate their whereabouts to the
college.

AND THE RULES presently
in ettect about men's presence
in the women's dorms and vrcc
versa could continue to be strict—
ly enforced, There would be no
reason to continue a coniplcicly’
tree atmosphere simply because
women were allowed to remain
out beyond midnight

When objection to tree hours
is based on a moral objection
to "free love" most or us want
to ansiver with the question
posed by another parent:
“What is tiiere to do artcr
midnight, anyway, that cannot
be done bcrore?"

The same parent states that
"Rules cxrst in our home, as i
am sure they do in any home
where the parents care about
their children They should not
suddenly cease.” Many or us
agree wholeheartedly w h this
view. One solution. then. is to
allow only juniors and seniors.
or Just seniors, the privilege and
responsibility of regulating their
own hours

The essence or responsible are
eument in layer of extended
freedom for Women is faith Iliat
there will be regulation, but
regulation by the indrvrdual
women instead of by an outside
authority There are many pur.
poses more conventional than
“free love" for which a Grinnell
woman might want to stay out
past. midnight; while most. of
our parents did place some curs
low on us at home, few (if us
had parents who considered 1201
as radically diﬁenent from “:59
as do the Women’s House Rules;
there are numerous and practi~
cal alternatives to an atmos
phere of total license if freedom
were to be granted; and there
are certainly possibilities for
making the assumption of total
responsibility gradual over the
tour-year period.

The most essential point of
controversy, it seems, is how the
students would view their l'c~

Urges action,
not just talk

To the Editor:
We have bccn careiully read»
ing the letters to the editor Lonv
cerning ivoinens hours and have,
noticed that many or the letters
are from the parents ot Ireshm-dn‘
students. We would agree witht
them that freshman women
need hours as (to many sopho’,
more \"oan and some iunior,
women The question. which per-
haps has been overlooked, '
have the scnior omen, who al’c‘
21. or legal age. and have been
away ltoin home for three years,
learned how to it c care of‘
themselves and learned to be‘
responsible Citizens oi both the;
Grinnell campus and or the outer
side worldl Ir they have not
learned in that time, will they‘
ever? \ ‘

What is there to do arter 12
o'eioclm Upon occasion, one is
involved in a discussion which ,
must be cut short instead or r
ending spontaneously. Sonic. l
times err—campus movies last
until alter iiours. These are l
two examples of situationsl
leading to understandable rep 1
sentment against hours. t

We suggest, as one parent
proposed, that a poll oi the slur
dents be laken, dividing llicr
votes by class and sex, If there1
is strong interest concerning the
present iionicn's hours then we:
would like to see a eommittcci
tor-med to study the problem oil
hours in other schools and theirl
solutions; study the opinions ott
parents; and study the ideas oii
the administration. From this in-l
formation the committee eouldl
propose a plan which would ﬁtl
the needs and demands or the,
Crinncll campus.

While i ing letters andi
talking are important in any‘
issue, as long as no positive ac~
tion is tairen, only antagonism
on both sides is aroused.

Training is key says leader of Canada ballet troupe

"In ballet the well trained
body is the instrument or Comp

resident ballet mistress of the
National Ballet or Canada.

“Training begins no later than
10 years oi age. At special board-

“With the‘ company the novices
learn stageeralt and pertect
their techniques, Although cos.

they must buy their own shoe

paint is usually used because
darker makeup becomes black
