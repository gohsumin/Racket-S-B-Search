Mom Felherolf Recommends
Counsel Instead of Dicialion

In the Editor:

My adult life is more tran-
quil, more interesting, than that
of my youth, for l have learned
to say to myself, “Be still and
know mat God is."

Youth is the same today as
it was many yesterdays ago—
yibrant, restless, and eager lor
life.

But if the adults don’t quit
trying to set up a pattern for
youth to follow, We are going
16 arrive at utter chaos in nine
cases out of ten, youth creates
the problems of today because
of pressure brought on by
some people who think they are
wiser and that they know all
the answers Some of the an-
swers are all wrong.

The boy and girl standing on
the threshold Of life and adult—
hood revert back to the youth

of past generationsr Basically
the problems are the same but
in larger proportions. Cocktail
parties, Fort Lauderdale, cars,
etc, given by well-meaning (?)
people, will not make them de—
sirable citizens in their own
world of youth or in the future
World of adulthood
If we send out an 505‘ to
God, be we young or be we
old, we will get an answer pro-
viding we “be still and know
that God is." All can yet be well
wim the world if all of us
pitch in and help. The potential
of our youth is great, but our
adult leaders must counsel in-
stead of dictate.

Esperanto Features
Vocalist Yorbrougli

Folk music will once again
ring out in the Forum when
Martin Yarbrough entertains
informally on the Esperanto
label on Saturday, January 30,
in the South Lounge. The Chi<
cago folk singer, graduate of
Old Town’s “Mother Blues,"
will present two varied per-
formances at 9:30 and ”iii

Yarbrough will appear under
the auspices of Grinnell’s Es-
peranto series, inaugurated last
year to provide professional
and semi-professional enter-
tainment with an emphasis on
variety.

Responsible for Esperanto’s
organization, the 19-member
student F or u in Committee
stresses its informality and
freedom from dating obliga-
tions. “Enthusiasm is high on
the part of the committee for
they see Esperanto as a way
to offer a wide assortment of
performers to the campus with
in the scope of their budget,"
noted Palmer Hartl, social co-
ordinator.

By remaining sensitive to
student opinion and suggesr
tions, the Committee hopes to
season Esperanto and to con-
tinue to bring off-campus en-
tertainment to the college com
munity.

Esperanto performances will
be scheduled about once a
month. Informal entertainment
by Grinnell students under this
program is a distinct possibil-

 

ity in the near future.

Slide Lecture on IVS Tells Students
Aid Needed for Underdeveloped Lands

By Anne Farrer

As most Grinnellians are
probably fully aware, when at-
tending a lecture in student has
to gain understanding of the
topic under consideration by
flexing his imagination more
than by observing physically
active evidence. Not so last
January 12 during a discussion
of foreign service and practi-
cal people to people programs
which was held in the Viewing
room. During the course of
events, one integral part of
which was viewing slides, the
slide feeding mechanism of the
projector went on the blink and
for all practical purposes any
further slide showing was prfit.
Did anyone give up? Did any
lose heart? Certainly not. Two
strong and ablerbodied former
Peace Corpsmen came to the
rescue and keeping in the spirit
of their parent organization and
really showing their stuff, de-
vised a way to manually feed
the slides and proceeded to do
it, So on with the lecture:

Leading the proceedings was
Msgr. Edward O'Rourke of Des
Moines, president of the board
of directors of International
Voluntary Services. He dis-
cussed the organization, which
was founded in 1953 and Was a
forerunner of the Peace Corps,
and its purpose to “develop hur
man resources.” IVS now has
several hundred volunteers in
the field in twelve underdevel-
oped countries, giving technical
assistance and working to bring
the people together to work
out their problems. Real sucA
cess for an IVSrer is achieved
if he can work himself out of
a job—if he can so stimulate

 

the natives to take over his
activity and continue on with
their own development.

The concept behind IVS is the
same as that behind the Peace
Corps: after World War II the
US was quite successful with
its rehabilitation program for
warrdevastated countries, but
found that trying to apply the
same policies to countries
which haven't attained the
same advanced level as those
countries of Western Europe is
a bit ridiculous: What was
needed is a practical program
of economic, technical, and
practical aid. IVS recruits and
sends out people to meet this
need—vigorous, personable, in—
telligent volunteers who ident-
ify with, live with, and help the
people of raw underdeveloped
countries They are ”agents of
change”—by their work they
are changing the image of
America abroad, the concept of
foreign aid, and themselves
personally. It is in this latter
respect that Msgr. O’Rourke
believes that the abilities and.
experience of volunteers—1V5,
Peace Corps or whatever—can
be most fully Utilized. Their
services need not end with their
work in a foreign country, for
when returning to the States
they can form a reserve of
leadership which could be val-
uable in many areas, from civ-
il rights to urban renewall

Msgr. O'Rourke’s talk was
followed by Ann Wright, Grin-
net] ’62 and IVS in Viet Nam,
and Tom Kenwortby, Peace
Corps in Colombia, discussing
their respective programs and
