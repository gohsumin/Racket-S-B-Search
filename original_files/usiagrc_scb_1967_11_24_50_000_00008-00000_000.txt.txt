GRAY MATTER

By Bill Gray

Volleyball has taken over the center stage of l. M. activities
and while it is considered by many as a filler between football and
basketball (primarily those who lose), many others play it with
the vigor and intensity usually reserved for football. South, with
enthusiasm enough to bring down the walls of Jericho, has taken
a commanding lead. At the other end of the spectrum is Dibble
whose enthusiasm wouldn’t have much eliect on a house of cards.

The intro—college bowling league continues to roll along in un-
interrupted obscurity. The lead is now held jointly by the teams
captained by Rick Kuethe and Dave North, their records are
15-5. Senor Perri, who doubles as a Spanish professor when he is
not kegling, holds high game with a me Eill Gray has high series
with 564 and Tom Oppenheimer has the best average, 180.

l have been accosted from all sides for my statement on vol.
leyball and the liberal arts college in the World of change Al-
though I don't think humanity is ready for this philosophical pro
tundity, to placate the masses i will make it public. “The purpose
of the liberal arts college is to prepare us lor the changing outside
world so that when we are thrust into it, we won’t be set up and
spiked," What’s Heidegger got Lhat 1 haven't?
