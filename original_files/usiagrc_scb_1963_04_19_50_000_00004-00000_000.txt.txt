Toynbec stated that the prob

a philosophy is discovering the.
“relation between phenomenal
and the mind which is aware oil
them." ,

What comprises an historical

in answer to another ques

term “challenge and iesponse,"
which was coined by Toynbcc,
was a usetul suinmai-y oi “the

Commenting on the “pattern“

that is evident in history, Toyl-le
bee said that although such a
pattern is discernible. it will
nonetheless be impossible to
predict the luture because of
the change in human life. To

Vocgelin wasn't sure that th

A Grinnell College audieneel
Monday was told that since the.
human mind cannot take in that
universe as a whole, man's.
patchwork mental picture oi
the universe must be a mis—
leading picture of the indivisible
reality.

The speaker was Arnold J.]
Teynbee. visiting Heath profes-
sor of history. in the iii-st of a
series of tour lectures on “The
Philosophy ol History.” Mr.
Toynbee said:

"Owing to this imperleoted.
ness of our intellectual powers,
we cannot avoid partitioning.
our mental map of the uni-
verse into disciplines,

“Human affairs are merely
one discipline, Yet human af—
fall's cannot be undci-stoodprop-
erly except as an inseparable,
part of the indivisible universe
which includes all the nonchu-
man phenomena too. Man, like
other living creatures, is in-
separable trom his total en-
vironment, and is unintelligible
it not studied in his environ—
mental setting"

Using “The lndivisibility and
Unpredictability of Human At—
fairs” as his topic, Dr, Toynbee,
pointed out that the study ot
human altairs is broken down,
into a number or sub-disciplines
such as psychology, anthropol—
ogy, sociology, history, etc. I

“We cannot avoid dividingl
human affairs up into compare,
merits and concentrating on
some single compartment," he‘
said, “but we must never let
ourselves take the dividing

lines between the

“The partitioning into disv
cipiines has been haphazard and
unsysteinatic. But even if it
were rationalized it would still
be an obstacle to understand.
ing.”

Although he argued that we
should study the universe as a
whole all of the time, the his

disciplines

_torian conceded that, as human

beings the humanities have the
tirst call on us,

“The proper study of manv
kind is man," he said, “in the
sense that the first business on
our agenda is to live with olli’~
selves and with each other If
we lail in this, we cannot suc-
ceed in anything else Human
affairs matter supremely to us,
because they are our affairs "

Asserting that “challenge and
response" is a more realistic
rormula than "cause and ettect"
when dealing in human attairs,
the historian said that in hu-
man allairs, unlike astronomy,
the iuturc is unpredictable be»
cause at every encounter there
is not a pie—dctcrmined result,
but a treedom of choice—that is
unpredictable by natui ,

Al'ter citing scrcral “unc
peoted events in human, his
tol'y," Dr. Toynbcc said that
in hu-
man attairs, we cannot predict
the iuturc.

“On the other hand," he said,
when we look back over our
records oi the past, we do tind
