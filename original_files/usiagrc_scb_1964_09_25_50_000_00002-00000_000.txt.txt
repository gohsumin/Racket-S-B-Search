are both in contention for the
vacated end position. The only
ther expected change on of-
ense will be Tom Lannom, a
linebacker last year, replacing
Morgan Michel at center.

' Bowers saw some offensive
bright spots but was not pleased
with the Pioneer defense in Sat-
urday’s scrimmage. The white
team composed mainly of first-
otrlng offensive players de-
feated the red squad 2142 in
the three quarter game.

Besides the defense a major
boncem for the Pioneers in to
inorrow’s opener will be a rash

f injuries. Reserve fullback
ave Imes, defensive tackle
ete Staben a nd offensive
ckles Eric Miller and Rein
srsl all have shoulder in-
uries.

Ringo has sustained a broken

and reserve tackle Rick An-
Eereon has an injured arm. All
are expected to have recovered
sufficiently to play against
Ripon.

Slated to start in the back

eld are Hanssen at quarter-

ck, Ringo at fullback and
‘dhn Shierholz and Elston
_ owers at halfback. Barry An-
derson is expected to see action
at quarterback.

In the line it will be Lannom
at center, Lewis and L. Miller
at guard, Saral and E. Miller
at tackle and Dave Gauger and
Dewitt at the ends. Al Peterson
moved into contentioin for the
and spot after his pass-catching
performance in the intrasquad
game.

Defensively the Pioneers are
not so well set. Bowers plans
to use less platooning this year
in order to take advantage of
the defensive experience of
many of his offensive players.

In the defensive backfield
are expected to be Shierholz,
Hanssen, Bob Watt and Dave
Synhorst. Lewis, Lannom and
Paul Thurston will fill the line-
backer spots. The defensive line
has not been set,

Bowers p l a n 5 no basic
'ohanges from last year’s basic-
ally wing and wing-t offenses.
Defensively the Pioneers should
look very much like last year,
also, using a 5-2-4 or a 5-4-2.

Ripon has had only one im-
portant loss from last year’s
.eam which defeated Gﬂnnell

7-0.

ICARLET AND BLACK

Scarlet Fever

By Dick Lovell
Could Grinnell football teams compete on a respect-
able basis with such schools as Luther, Iowa Wesleyan,
or Wartburg? Such a question invites all sorts of com-

parisons — comparisons of school size, recruiting poli- a

cies, money available and, of course, seasons' records.
The first three categories lay themselves open to a rela-
tively objective evaluation; however, the fourth basis
(and most important) must be forgotten. Not only does
Grinnell not play any of these Iowa Conference schools;
we don't play anyone who does. In fact, there is no
room on our schedule for anything but conference foes
The conference policy of fratricidal scheduling elimi-
Eates any valid evaluation of Midwest Conference foot—
all.

This, however, clears the way for something which
has long been a dream in the minds of many Big Ten
fans — a full round robin schedule with each team
playing each other team once. Well, despite my disap-
pointment at not being able to compare our football
with other small colleges, I must congratulate the con-
ference policy-makers on achieving a really fair meth-
od for naming a conference champion. But wait . . .
it says in the conference rules that only eight games
can be played in any season by any one team. With ten
teams in the conference this means that we have 8/9 of
a perfect round robin. Not only are we the only confer-
ence I know of with no inter-league games, but we are
saddled with an unusually short season.

There are many reasons for this condition: finan-
cial considerations, weather factors and perhaps most
influential, a sense of proportion on the part of the

faculties of the members whose laudable aim is main-
taining competitive athletics as a necessary but limited
phase of member schools’ educational program. No one
who has sat through a Grinnell College game with its
morgue-like atmosphere could have too many serious
worries about football occupying a disproportionately
large place in Grinnell students’ life. We have 89% of
n “ideal situation" Gee, it sure would be nice if . . .

Incidentally, have you noticed the Midwest Confer-
ence prediction in the September 21 issue of Sports 11-
lustrated? (That’s the magazine that picked the Dallas
Cowboys as NFL champions last year, you know.) It
looks like they’re still in the groove with C09, Carle-
ton, St. Olaf, and Cornell as the “contenders” in the
Midwest conference. Notice any omissions?
