JAMES HITS
CITY HOUSING

By SUE T. MILLER

Q: “What do you think of
public houslng In Chicago?”

A: “I would drop a bomb
on 35th through 47th Streets
and start over again."

In talking of the wrongs of
the Chicago housing project,
Director of the Waterloo Human
Rights Commission, Ronald
James addressed a group Wed-
nesday In South Lounge.

“I wouldn’t h D u s e cattle
there," he said. “I went to the
Stockyards at 63rd Street and
they are more roomy, better
built than me projects are. . .
Anyway you look at it, as a
sociological, or an architectural
proposition, those projects are
wrong,"

James was asked it he
wanted to get away from such
low rent charity housing. With
the money Chicago Mayor
Daley “has poured in," James
answered, “no doubt he could
have done better . . . those
with less money and connec-
tions have done better."

The Mayor, James cited, “is
putting Negroes in cracker-
hoxes until they explode."

James also spoke of Adam
Clayton Powell—as “an articu-
Iator of the Negro anger." And
oi Martin Luther King—as "one
remembered as “poor, naive,
ignorant, (who) walked the
streets, talking to young men
with swltchblades. saying ‘what
have you accomplished by
this.’ "

The Waterloo administrator
mentioned one case of a young-
ster with six arrests behind
him, who has “no exposure to
whites."

“No exposure," he pointed
about the South Lounge, “to
this kind of paraphernalia
here,“

“Here Grinnell goes all the
way down to Memphis to help,"
he said, “and it does nothing
in Waterloo,"

James spoke of the best in-
ﬂuence at the college in the
town of Grinnell, tor its prob-
lems in the treatment of Negro
students'there, is the pockeb
book.

“As much economic power as
the college has on the com-
munity, I'm sure there's some
pressure that can be brought
to play."

Other possible methods for
college people to improve the
situation between Negroes and
townies came from audience
comments, Taking pictures,
preaching sermons in the town
churches. and articles in the
papers of specific incidents, to

Debate raged at the Wednes-
day senate meeting over the
proposed Committee at Thirteen
(C of T) and ombudsman.
‘Thum Thomas, Gates, and
Nail Fischer, Langan, members
of the committee that drafted
the new constitution, found
themselves answering to SEV-
eral determined senators who
oppose it.

The C of T would replace the
Senate as the SGA's legislative
body. It would include the C or
HP president, the AWS presi-
dent, the SGA president, and
ten members elected at large.
Ari ombudsman, appointed by
the C of T, would be charged
with the responsibility of di-
iecnng students' ideas through
appropriate channels, and also
adVislng students as to where
they might turn for assistance
on any given matter.

One question raised was
whether there are enough well-
known people on campus to run
for c oi T in an atrlarge elec-
tion, Fischer replied that stu-
dents who are not members oi
the C of T will be statting
various committees, and can
make themselves known in this
capacity. Thus, the structure
provides a merit system at
sorts, he said.

SGA President Ric Mac-
Dowell made it clear that
he s u p p o r t s representation
by halls. To this end, he rec-
ommended an amendment to
the constitution that would give
the Senate the power to initiate
rule changes. Presently, the C
of HP and AWS Board propose
the changes and the Senate
passes them.

Several senators expressed

similar doubts, among them
Ray Horn, Rawson, who felt
that students' ideas follow the
path of least resistance and
thus are likely to come more
easily through senators whom
the students have a chance to
know better.

Thomas countered that one at
the purposes or the new con-
su'tutioii is to get away [ruin
the idea of halls as legislative
districts. Fischer added that
senators generally seek their
jobs not for the purpose of being
a liason between SGA and hail,
but to work on legislation. The
ombudsman's expressed raisori
d’etre is to keep interested
students aware of what is go-
ing on.

MacDowell’s amendment was
tabled until next week.

Doug Tolleisen, Dibble, chair~
man of the admissmns com»
mittee, announced that the com-
mittee is hoping to publish a
booklet for prospectives that
would present student views at
Grinnell. He emphasized that
the booklet would provide both
positive and ne gative view-
points. The booklet would not
be designed to replace other
admissions publications.

Students interested in Con-
tributing should send their work
to the admissions committee be-
fore Christmas. Tolletsen hopes
to have the booklet published
by February.

Ron Cogswell, c of HP presi-
dent, announced that both res-
ident advisors and student ad-
visors might be present in the
halls next year. The stu'leilt
advisors would receive more
extensive training than the cur-
rent hattleboards, and perhaps
would receive some pay.

TUITION RAISE
HIGHEST EVER

By NEIL FISCHER

President Glenn Ieggett an-
nuunced Tuesday that tuition
charges will increase an un-
precedented $200 next year,
jumping from $l925 to $2125
and making the total cost at a
year at Grinnell $3100.

In a letter to parents, Leg<
gett said that the “major rea-
sons” tor the increase are the
competition (or and rising sal-
aries or “highly qualiﬁed schol-
ar-teachers;" higher student
labor and start wages; and the
inflation of academic, service.
and physical plant costs.

“We expect therefore an in<
crease of about $350,000 in
operating costs tor leases (on
top of an increase of about
$450,000 for 1967-68, compared
with 1956-67).” Leggett ex-
plained. “Two-thirds of the
$350,000 Will be met by the in«
crease in the comprehensive
charge."

There are about 1160 stu<
dents at Grinnell. An increase
of $200 per student comes to
$232,000 — exactly two-thirds of
Leggett’s estimate for increased
costs next year.

Leggett said that the EMI—
tlonal third would hopefully he
met by “increased glits ironi
industry, alumni, and friends
or the College.”

Room, board, and fees (ao‘
tivities, college events, and
health fees) are expected to re-
main the same, Leggett noted
in the letter.

The $200 tuition increase is the
largest in the history or Grin-
nell. Tuition for 196768 was
$1925 e only $155 greater than
the 31770 figure {or 1906-67.

The lsoezn figure was only
SISO above the $1640 tuition
charge for 1965-66.

The total cost — including
room, hoard, tuition ,and fees
— of attending Grinnell College
in 1941, the year Chairman or
the Faculty Joseph Wall grad-
uated, was $720 — only one-
third of the tuition costs alono
rpr next year.

Tliition iorty years ago wal
$160. A decade ago it was $700.

Room and board costs at
Grinnell have remained sulr
stantially the same since 1961-
62 — that is, around $910. K

board, and tees was $850,

Leggett said that the True.
tees have authorized an expara
sion of ﬁnancial aid to take
care of “hardship cases" re<

“Though the increased tuln
tion charge is in line with typi.
