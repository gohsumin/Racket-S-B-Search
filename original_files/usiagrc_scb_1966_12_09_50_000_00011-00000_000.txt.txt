This description of Thailand is continued
from n previous issue of the 58:3. Miss
Dendvs, Grinnell, '65, spent last year teach-
ing in Thailand on the Grinnell Fifth Year
Abroad Program.

As we passed the booths, we were greeted by
shouts from our sludems, all urging us to buy
something ~— anything from them, My feeble
protestations were quickly drowned by their on
thusiasm. l managed to escape only after buying
some roasted nuts, a couple handpainted Christ-
mas Cards for the folks back home (showing View
log palm irees), a bamboo pin in the shape of a
butterfly, and an aerial View of Chiengmai.

We ﬁnally found an empty table where We were
joined by some more friends: Chaw Ying Seda,
a Shsn princess from Burma who also teaches
English at Dara, her brother and sister, and
another Shan friend. John. We all ordered satealr,
a meat dish made of pork or beef, The meat is
usually dipped in a sauce or peanut butter and
coconut milk and eaten with a cucumber.and
vinegar relish, 1 also had kwiiayd nam (noodles
in Water, with meat and vegetables, usually bean
sprouts). With the addition of a few extra ina
gradients such as sugar, soy sauce, mmplaa (fish
sauce), pepper, and crushed peanuts, the dish
was ready to eat. We topped off our meal with
some ice cream and hot Ovaltine, another Thai
favorite,

Jungjut glanced at his watch. it was nearly
nine o‘clock — time to get started it we wanted
a good view of the parade. After paying our hill,
we made our way through the noisy holiday
crowd until we reached the badge. The View
was magniﬁcentl To our right, through the cur~
tain of trees lining the river bank, we could see
the shimmering lights of Dara, Straight ahead,
at the distant bend of the dark n'ver, tiny lights
melted and flowed into a stream of gold. Elabor-
ate ﬂoats resembling miniature temples and
boats passed under the bridge, as well as simp-
ier ones made of bark, banana leaves, or paper.
A firecracker exploded nearby. We moved on,
and once more, became part of the surging
crowd.

Ying touched my arm and pointed to a cluster
of people on the bridge, Even at times of festivity
and fun, one can ﬁnd a note of tragedy. A small
boy had fallen through a hole in the bridge and
drowned. For one family, anyway, this Loy Kra-
thong was not a time of joy but of sorrow.

By now, we had crossed the bridge. The street
ahead of us — and the surrounding area —— wns
tightJy packed with people, all anxiously await<
ing the start of the parade. People, people every
where , . , 1 never knew there were so many
people in Thailand, let alone in Cbiengmai. Acts
ually, many of them were visitors who had come
just for the iestivnl. Loy Krathorlg (and many
other festivals) are best seen and celebrated in
Clllellgmai. Thousands of Tllélis from miles
around, even as for as Bangkok, charter buses
and jam uno the hotels (luring llic onuuul inn-s
and festivals, ll's hectic, bill “is Thais seem to
love every minute ol it.

1 spied a couple Dara teachers on a balcony
with an excellent View of the Coming parade.
After ii‘anlic motlolnngs, they saw us and waved
{or us to join them. The owner of the shop es-
corted \IS upstairs where we removed our slides
before entering the llvmg area and the balcony.

The parade, with its huge linens and various
native bands, is a high point in the two-day les-
iivities. Many organizations, clubs, and larger
shops compete in presenting the most beaulilul
and original float. These floats are than actually
launched on the Mae Ping River and float downs
stream past the judges’ stand _ one every 20 or
30 minutes. There were floats representing ani-
mals and depicting Thai legends, A Chinese tire
breathing dragon wound lts way down the street.
There were also floats of a more serious nature
showing agricultural machinery 7 and new wea-
pons, The armed forces contributed to the dc-
casion with a iloot dcpicling military prepared
ness, but also showing the determination of the
Thai people to stand for world peace. The huge
missile on the SEATO float actually fired its
“rockets", creating huge puffs oi billowing grcy
smoke and almost shattering n iew ear drums

along the way. Arid, as in parades everywhere,
beautiful young girls smiled and waved to the
crowds, and were greeted with whistles and
shouts of approval in return,

As the last float disappeared from view, the
crowds began to disperse in search of more an
terlainment and sanuk. Jungjut and his friend
went to play a game of ping pong, while Ying
and I decided to continue through town, heading
for the New Bridge further north. As we ducked
through the crowds, we were thankiul not to
have to ﬁght the usually heavy motorized traffic.
The streets are generally jammed with three-
wheeled taxis and pedicabs, buses, cars, jeeps,
tniclrs, oxcarts, bicycles, and hondas, which go
careenlng crazily down the street, paying abso-
lutely no attention to common sense rules of
safety. The pedestrian is just as bad. How any-
one manages to stay alive in Thai trafﬁc
(whether Bangkok or Chiengmai) is beyond my
understanding. During the festival, however, the
police had blocked off all the main streets and
roads near the river.

Quite a crowd had collected in front of the
government sold or pavilion where another show
was in progress. Half a dozen girls were dancing
the Chiengmai “Nail” Dance, while to the right,
on educational film on hill tribes was being
shown. Music from several bands filled the all,
and a singer crooned a popular Thai love song
into the microphone. Ying and I passed bright,
cheerful shops where customers could be heard
bargaining over goods. Young children played on
the floor, and friends passed the time in amiable
conversation. We were greeted by many of our
students and introduced to their parents and
lriends. They all wished us a wonderful Loy
Krathnng and hoped that l‘d be in Thailand long
enough to enjoy many more.

Ying Seda and I took a side street which looked
inviting, The alley was dark, save for hundreds of
small flickering candles placed around balconies
and on window sills. Here and there, a ray of
light shone from a window or slipped under a
door. I closed my eyes and could almost hear
the soft crunch of soft snow underfoot . . . the
tinkle of tiny bells , , . and the sound 01 children’s
voices singing “Silent Night”. As we walked
along, Ymg, a Buddhist, felt. an equal serenity
and beauty.

At last, we Came to an old Buddhist temple or
Wat surrounded by thick grey walls. We walked
through the gate, guarded by two ilerce lion-
dogs, and beheld a most beautiiul sight. Tiny
lights winde and flickered out of the darkness
like mischievous eyes. They sparkled on tile
chodi or reliquary and on the stairs and on The
naga (serpent) balustrades, They even danced
on the various some images or demons and ani—
inols which dotted the courtyard, Sevcral wor-
shipers were placing rheir candles on the billu-

c hciorc enlel'lng the w' an, the principal
n..t building where the public gathers on holy
tlnys. inside llie nihan, pricsls rll‘onctl their an-
Clellt, snot-ed Sanskrit and roll scriplurcs. To
this rlzly, their deep and monolouous cliontiug
never fails to send a slight slnver down my spine.
Ying bought a candle, sevcrul incensc sticks, and
a small bouquet of red and yellow gcl‘beras. Afr
ler removmg our shoes, we entered the \viharl.
she placed her offerings on the shrine already
blazing with candles and fragrant with incense.
As she prayed, I glanced around me. Upon a
raised throne in the center of the far wall, facing
the entrance, loomed the great gilded bronze
image of the Buddha, it seemed part of the
building itself. It dominated the whole interior,
peacelul, composed, and calm. To the lelt. upon
a low raised platform, sat a group or orange-
robed priests, oblivious to the comings and
goings or the worshipersJ tell under the spell of
the moment a the droning of the priests, the
fragrance of incense, the ﬂickering lights, and
the gentle, benevolent Buddha, smiling down upon
the prostratlng worshipers.

Ying and I slipped out quietly. Outside, we were
lreated to another pleasant surprise. A huge
lounialn oi sparks shot up into the air with a
“whoosh” and a blaze of light, It ﬂared and
sparkled in all its splendor and then, just as sud-
denly, died, leaving only a burned-out shell. We
nodded, and walked through the gate, We found

 

two taxis near the new bridge,
and said goodbye. People were
slowly returning to their homel.
after another beautiful My
Kralhong. This was to be my
last. The cold night air farmed
my face in a gentle farewell
caress. The palms swayed and
rustled softly in the moonlight.
It was 3 am. and, in another
few hours the dawn of another
new day.

Hebrew Taught By
Sophomore Student

“it's like 8 branch on a tree,"
said the instructor of 3 new
course at Grinnell. He was re;
terring to a class in beginning
Hebrew grammar which grew
out of Mr. Crossett's Bible
class. The teacher is sopho-
more student James A. Arietl
and the class membership is
based solely on interest. The re-
ply has been “more than eu-
thusiastic“ said Arieti. The
class now numbers about 15,

This course gives no credit,
being offered purely in the in-
terest of scholarship. Interest
in it developed because of prob-
lems which arose out of am-
biguities in translation. Goal of
the class is to develop the abili-
ty to read the Old Testament in

the language in which it was
written,

PPPE Book Tells
Washington Jobs

Attention was focused on the
possibilities for employment in
Washington, D.C. this coming
summer, in a manual prepared
and distributed by the Program
in Practical Political Educa-
tion this week.

'The employment opportuni-
ties both in congressional of-
fices and in Federal agencies
and installation in the metro
politan area or the Nation’s
Capital are outlined in the
PPPE manual.

The importance of early ac-
tion in making application for
such summer assignments in
Washington is emphasized, since
in the case of the congressional
internships there is intense com-
petition for a limited number
oi positions and since in the
case oi the positions with Fed-
eral agencies a passing score
on either the Office and Scie
ence Assistant Examination or
the Federal Service Entrance
Examination is required. And
the final filing date for ad
mission to both of these test:
is early in January.

A copy of the PFPE manual
may be obtained from C. Ed-
win Gilmour (pol. sci.), PPPE
Director in Room 213, Camegie,
either in person or with a writ-
ten request.
