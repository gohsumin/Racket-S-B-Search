3 Student Government Speaks

By TOM THOMAS

Following petitioning, floor by
ﬂoor discussion and impromptu
meetings, the Senate adopted a
resolution proposing hall de-

' termination of coed lounge use,
In accordance with college leg<
islatlvepmcedures, this pro-
posal will be presented to the
student affairs committee on
Tuesday.

The obvioim questions concern-
lng this matter are what is the
chance of this idea passing and
'Whyvis it different from other
SGA proposals that have failed
in the past. Student desires for
open lounges are nothing new
or particularly exciting to ad-
ministrators or professors. How-
ever, I believe this issue does
bring in something new. That
is, student government is not
just proposing what is wanted,
but also an idea for how to go
about accomplishing it.

In the past, students have
been continually criticized, and
i think rightly so. for present
ing only pleas for change or in-
novation with occasional accom-
panying philosophies. Specific
problems and mechanical ques-
tions have been largely ignored.
Acceptance of student proposals
has often been refused on the
grounds that they were not suf-
ﬁciently ”thought through."

son's open lounge proposal
does have the means of imple-
mentation included. Provision:
are made loi- dealing with
“‘cnrnpits security" and hail

determination. Enforcement
provisions are clearly spelled
out. Philosophical matters
have long been belobured—thls
proposal is directed to meet
faculty and administrative
questions.

In preliminary discussion with
deans and at this week's student
affairs meeting, prospects for
acceptance of the SGA proposal
look hopeful. in any event, reso<
lution of the question should
come quickly: in the event of
passage the matter goes to the
president.

Aside irom the matter of or»
en lounges, the student affairs
Committee, on a broader scale,
is considering the entire ques
tion of student rule structure.
It is the growing consensus that
the present system of regula.
tions, policies and inferences
concerning student life is inade-
quate. Arising from a consider-
ation of the college drug state-
ment, the committee is consider-
ing the formulation of a compre-
hensive statement of college
policy on the “rights and free-
doms" of students. All existing
college regulations and state—
ments could then be reviewed
in the context of these “first
principles." The committee is
approaching this matter in an
open way, and anyone with ideas
on the subject should contact
SGA.

BRIDGE: POST MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY
An example of rather unor-
thodox bidding occurred in the
Forum this week, in which the
contract of 3 NT. was reached
on the strength oi an opening
bid and a long suit. The dealer
opened one diamond with the
following hand:
S A x x
H A x x x
D A Q x x
C X X
His partner jumped to 3 NT.
holding nothing but an incred-
lble length in diamonds:
S x X K
H x x
D K J in x x x x
C x
Declarer's logic behind such
a questionable bid lay in the
hope of enticing a diamond lead
from an opponent who would
interpret the nu trump bid as
showing weakness in diamonds
and, having a singleton or
doubleton, would lead to his
partner's marked strength.
Fortunately for deciarer, this
error actually took place. The
contract, however, would still
have been down if the dummy
'had not had all three aces, for,
after running diamonds, de-
ciarer would be forced to let in
the opposition, who by this time,
,bopeiully, would have discov-
ered the ruse and would attack
the unguarded club suit, wiu-
niilg 5 tricks with a five - five
split, As the cards lay. the
only lead that could deieat the
contract was a club which, ig-
noring the erratic bidding, was
the correct lead against a no
,trump contract, Declarer would

have been down one before he
got in. Furthermore, the open-
er’s hid did not necessarily
promise the ace of diamonds.
the absence of which would
mean almost certain disaster
no matter what. lead was made.

This analysis is not a dia<
tribe against‘all unusual Corr
tracts, but rather a criticism
of an incredibly optimistic bid
which required 3 aces in the
dummy and a misguided lead
by the opposition. The possibil<
ity of a diamond void in the
wrong hand or a king instead
of an ace in dummy would be
enough for most enthusiasts to
be privately astonished at part
net's opening and then, after
entertaining brief thoughts or
game, put the contract at the
proper level of two diamonds.

Campus Events:
Computer Dance,
Powell Lecture

By ALLAN HART

In a continuing effort to
make college activities more
relevant to the outside world
of diversified opinions and in<
terests, the events of coming
week cover the whole range,
from a sampling of the all-
encompassing centralizat i o n
to come (the Computer
Dance), to the dissident voices
of its early victims (Adam
Clayton Powell). Of course you
(encersitlers have been consid-
ered tot), with football films
and a singing group that per
forms everything from Men~
delssohn to Seeger.

Friday, October 4, starts out
the entertainment with a fac<
uliy recital in Herrick Chapel
at 8 pm. James Wyly will play
the harpsichord and Wilma
Zonn the oboe. Then in the South
Lounge of the Forum at 9:30
there will be a folk music con<
cert, featuring Atanas Kolar-
ovski, Also at 9:30. “Rebec-
ca". a Hitchcock film. will be
shown in ARH.

On Saturday the 5th, the
highly regarded Gregg Smith
Singers will perform in Rob-
erts Theatre at 8 pm. The
group sings all kinds of music,
as noted above, and has tray.
eled across the US. and Eur-
ope. At 9:30 the big event of
the week will be held—the
Computer Dance, in the North
Lounge of the Forum. Selec-
tions or dates for participating
students were made by a com-
puter after the students filled
out a very general question-
naire. Music for the dancing,
mechanized party-ites will be
provided by the IBTC, a popu-
lar Iowa band. Finally, at
11:00 in ARI-l [he movre “MD-

be “Race, Poverty, Politics,
”68.” He is an extremely con<
troversial spokesman for the
Black people of America, and
this may be your only chance
to hear what he really thinks,
rather than what the nation's
press thinks of him. Following
his appearance, a little heavy
drama will be provided by a
movie of last weekend's foot-
ball game against Cornell, to
be shown in the South Lounge
of the Forum at in pm. At

pear have been denied.

trovcrsy is over, your mind
can relax on Thursday at a
Bridge lesson in the Forum at
7:30.

Ex Loco Players Reorganize

Two plays, radio plays, and

improvisations are being planned

by a group of students called
the EX Loco Players, The Ex
Loco Players is an oil-campus
theater group not officially con
nected with the college. They
took the name from the student-
run colfee house which closed
at the end of last year. They
have retained the name but are
now looking for a new place for
their performances. The first
play this semester, now being
chosen, will be contemporary
but conventional in nature. The
second will probably be from
the theater of the absurd.

The Ex Loco Players began
last spring when a group of
eight students decided that they
wanted to produce The Birth
day Party by Harold Pinter.
They approached Ned Donahue

(Speech and Theater) with their
idea and asked him to direct
the play. The result was the
performances given at Ex Loco
last spring.

The Ex loco Players operates
much like a theater company.
The members work as a group
win: no one leader. Together
they decide upon the play to be
performed, the director, the
cast, and the set. Donahue serves
as an adviser, not as a leader or
teacher. The emphasis or the
group is on putting on a pru<
duciion rather than learning
about the theater. '.

The Ex Loco Players now has
twenty-five members and wet-
comes anyone interested in help-
ing to produce a play. Persons
to contact are Debbie Abbott,
president, and Bonnie Tinker,
secretary.

Aware Works To Educate
White Community on Blacks

Working with church groups
is one way that AWARE (Asso—
ciation of Whites for the Ad-
vancement of Racial Equality),
is attempting to improve race
relations and understanding
within the Grimell community.

Four members of AWARE

young adults in a discussion or

older Methodist adult group will
participate in a similar pro

the semester is now almost
over and because a decision on
grading will again be made in
January.

concern over precedent— set<
ting was met by the contention
of the Social Studies Staff that
the grading system itself should
not and will not make a major
difference in the Social Studies
course or any other course:
The quality or the students, the
material, and the professors
are still the crucial factors in
course evaluation, Said Poliak.

The principle of grading will
not be eliminated, but evalua-
tion on a two-point instead or
a seven-point scale will "force
the stair to evaluate each stu-
deut iuthvrdually, not just on
[he terms oi individual grades,”
Giti’off stated. Part of the issue
is to see if students work just
for grades, or if initiative “can
be drawn out of them." ex-
plained Neal Mllner (Political
Scrence). Student expression of
interests and needs is also
crucial to the success of the
experiment.

Karen Frank, cry-chairmen of
AWARE, Phil De Jong. Church
Committee chairman, and Mary
Stuart led the discussion.

AWARE also serves as is sup—
port group for the Concerned
Black Students. As co-chairmen
Karen Frank and Nancy Rocks
Well explain AWARE’S func‘
tions and relationship to CBS,
“CBS feels it is not the black
man‘s role to educate the
white. It is the white man's
role to educate himself."

The Education Committee of
AWARE, headed by Andy
Loewi, is suggesting and on
ganizing educational programs
for Grinneil’s elementary, jun‘
ior high and high schools. Black
History seminar, taught by
Murray Nelson, will begin 0c-
tober 29. The course is open to
all high school students, but
they won't receive any credit
for the course because it is in-
dependent of the regular School
system.

The Education Committee
also hopes to bring the first
film in the CBS (television)
summer Series. Of Black Amer.
ica, narrated by Bill Cosby, as
a high school assembly. Book
lists and courses emphasizing
black history are being encour-
aged. AWARE hopes to orgam
iZe educational Skits {or ele«
mentary students and projects
With Uncle Sam's Club and
scout groups as part or ”the
white man’s role to educate
himself" about the black man,

A monthly ne'sletter about
AWARE’S actiV ies will be
published for all Grinnell Col-
lege students. Any questions
concerning AWARE Should he
addressed to box 1297. Alan
Jones of the history department
is the group's sponsor.
