The History of Henry Wilhelm and Krystyna
Neuman at Grinnell College

By MARK SABLEMAN
Pan Two

If Henry Wilhelm were any
other former Grinnell student,
he would have left Grinnell
after the yearbook problem
was finally settled. The whole
controversy about the 1966
yearbook would have been
gradually erased from the
minds of the people at Grins
nell, and no one would really
remember Henry Wilhelm for
very long. But Henry Wilhelm
was not just any other former
student. His father, who had
been a Political Science pro-
lessor here more than fifteen
years ago, still owned a house
in Grinnell, and Henry had
moved into 1408 East Street in
the summer of 1966.

Furthermore, he had no der
sire to leave Grinnell: Krystyna
Neuman and most of me rest
of his friends were here, and
he knew this community as
well as any other. He was born
in Grinnell, and spent his
early childhood here during the
days his father was on the fac-
ulty. He attended kindergarten
and first grade at Cooper
School, across from Quad. (He
remembers it as ”repressive,"
but recalls no controversy over
freedom of expression, the is-
‘sue that has plagued him so
much recently.

Thus, when Henry Wilhelm
and Krystyna Neuman picketed
the 1967 commencement in pro-
test of the "censorship" of
Wilhelm’s yearbook, two of the
men who were there and saw
them — Glenn Leggett, Presi—
dent of the College; and Bill
Peters, Grinnell Chief of P0»
lice — knew that it was not the
last they would see of Henry
Wilhelm and Krystyna Neu-
man. Those men — and, more
importantly, the institutions or
groups they represented: Grina
nell College and the town of
Grinnell — would have to con-
tend with Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman even after
they were no longer students
at Grinnell College.

Perhaps the one most con-
troversial issue that has come
up repeatedly since the year
book is the publication of the
underground newspaper Ptero-
dactyl, and the involvement of
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna Neu»
man, and others at the East
Street Gallery with it, Ptero-
dactyl was begun in the fall

term of 1967 by a group of col- ’

lege students, and during most

of 1968 it was edited by Rich-

ard Schneirov, then a Grinnell

student. Wilhelm did work on'

one of the issues in late 1968,
while Schneirov was studying
for ﬁnals, but outside of that
he was not involved with
New until 1969, after Schneir-
ov was no longer at Grinnell.

During 1969 four issues of
Pterodzctyl were published,
and Henry Wilhelm and Krys-
tyna Neuman, as well as oth-
ers who lived at East Street,
including Larry Frank and Kit
Lederer, worked on them. In
each of these issues, Wilhelm's
philosophy of allowing anyone
to publish anything that he
wanted was followed. Under
this system, one staff member
could have something printed
in the paper even if the other
staff members disagreed with
it. Only this, Wilhelm felt.
could be true freedom of ex
pression, In fact, he said, many
of the things which did appear
in Pterodactyl under this free-
dom of expression" rule were
things that he personally did
disagree with.

Such a newspaper with “com-
plete freedom of expression"
may have been the ideal for
Wilhelm; others did not see it
that way. Iowa Attorney Gen-

eral Richard Turner, who had
been bothered by what he con-
sidered obscene content in
earlier Pteros, arranged to
have the March 13, 1969 issue
seized when Wilhelm and
Larry Frank took the proof
pages to the printer at Wilton
Junction, Iowa. Immediately
after the seizure, which they
thought was illegal, Wilhelm
and Frank filed suit against
Turner in U.S district court in
Des Moines. They asked for
return of their pictures and
copy and $1,000 compensatory
and 310.000 punative damages.
The judge allowed their first
motion, for return of the paper,
but disallowed the damages on
the grounds that Turner had
judicial immunity. The second
half of the decision is current-
ly on appeal to the federal cirs
cuit court of appeals in St.
Louis, and it is being handled
by the lowa Civil Liberties
Union,
