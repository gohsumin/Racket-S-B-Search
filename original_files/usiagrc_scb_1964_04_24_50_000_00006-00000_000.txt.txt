Grinnell‘s track team journeys 'this weekend to the Drake
relays in Des Moines, where they will face some of the tough-
est college competition in the nation. Pioneer Coach Dick
Young has entered his men in five relay events and in three
of the open individual events.

Coach Young will take his ace relay team of Ron Schac-
he], Jeri Langham, John TePaske, and Bruce Beckord, who
will no doubt be facing their toughest opponents of the season.
Coach Young has the quartet entered in the sprint medley
invrtational where theywill run against top relay teams from
schools such as Texas Southern, Lamar Tech, and Lincoln
University.

Young’s relay team will also be defending its 880-yard
and mile relay championships won last year in the Iowa
College division. Grinnellians who braved the elements to
see the team run last year saw Fred Berg make a courageous
finish after pulling a thigh muscle about 50 yards from the
finish line. Berg was able to make it across the line to clinch
the first in the Sad-relay. With Berg out for the day, Coach
Youn had to call trackman Fred Arnold out of the stands to
take erg’s place in the mile relay. The team of Arnold, John
Edgren, Jeri Langham, and Bruce Beckord combined to take
another first with a time of 13:22.3 in the mile event.

Entering the individual events for the Pioneers will be
Rod Brown in the two mile run, Tom Wood in the Javelin,
and Jim Miller in the shot put. Miller, just last week, broke
the college shot put record with a heave of 491%”.

The Pioneers, who haven’t missed a Drake Relay for 51
years, have been named one of the honor teams at the Relays
his year. Grinnell, sharing honors with the University of
Minnesota, will be awarded a plaque by Relavs Director Bob
Karnes at the annual coaches dinner to be held tonight in
Des Moines.

This award, as well as the fact that the Olympics are
coming up this summer in Tokyo, moved this writer to do
a little investigation to see how Grinnell College runners
have done in the past half century, both in the Drake Relays
and in national and world competition.

Probably the best known of the Grinnell greats is Mor-

an Taylor, a hurdlerfwas the only American trackman ever
0 place among the top three in three consecutive Olympic
games. Taylor, ’25, broke the world’s record in winning the
400~meter hurdles at the 1924 games in Paris. In the 1928
games in Amsterdam he placed second, and in 1932, at Los
Angeles, he was able to take a third. Taylor still holds three
Grinnell College track records: 120-yard high hurdles in :14.7,
220-yard high hurdles in 223.2, and the broad jump with a
leap of 25’2".

Taylor’s coach‘, Harry J. (“Doc”) Huff, ’09, was a great
sprinter, clocking a sub ten second hundred yard dash. Huff
beat the country's top sprinters when he won both the 100
and 220-yard dashes in the Olympic tryout finals at James-
kown, Va. The Grinnell College Scarlet and Black reported

is running in-the 1908 Olympics in England as follows: “Soon
after his arrival in England. Huff contracted a severe cold,
due to the peculiar London climate, which with a sprained
ankle received on the second day of training, prevented his
appearing at his best. However, he won preliminaries in both
events, the 100 and 200 meter dashes, and was only narrowly
beaten in the semi-final.“

Other great names in Grinnell College track history in-
clude Charles Hoyt, ’18, national collegiate sprint champion;
Karl Hass, a dasllman who represented the United States in
the Pershing Olympics (Inter-Allied meet in Pershing Sta-
dium, Paris); Leonard Paulu, ’22, a Phi Bete who was a na»
national titlewinning sprinter; and “Iron Mike" Pilbrow, the
NCAA 2-mile champ in 1933. One could go on and on about
the good runners Grinnell has had who haven’t gained na-
tional fame. This would be an overwhelming task and I won’t
even try to begin to list some of these great runners.

Chief starter at the relays this year will again be Les
Duke ‘25, Grinnell track coach‘froin 1927 to 1947, and him»
self quite a trackman for the Pioneers. Mr. Duke is now with
the Ramsey Insurance Agency in Grinnell and is an avid
supporter of Grinnell track activities.

Added incentive for Grinnell students to attend the 1964
Drake Relays (well, at least for the men) will be the special
event Saturday afternoon featuring the “bouffanted” young
ladies from the Texas Track Club. The Texas club will meet
the five best 440Ayard Iowa high school girl’s relay teams.
Sharp-eyed readers of the April 20th issue of Sports Illus-
trated will recall the fetching cover picture and story which
told of the Texas Track Club and their coach who are dedi-
cated to the proposition that a girl can be beautiful and still
run the 100 in 10.9. See you at the Relays!
