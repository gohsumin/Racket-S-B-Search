Alums Visit Campus
, To Trade One-liners

by Jim Alt

The Returnrto-Campus pro-
gram, September 12-13, was
designed to keep "open lines
of communication" between
alumni and the campus. After
the first day of conferences,
panels, and a cocktail party
the alumni had informalvisits
with students at the various
RA'S suites. The raps which
developed were, if nothing
else, highly memorable:

“Do you believe in nuclear
war7"—r(class of thirty).

"I think you all study more
than we did, but you take it
all so seriously."h(class of
fifty).

“Did you lcnow that goldfish
are really undergrown carp?"
"(class of sixty).

Along with suchheavies were
casual inquiries concerning
the closing of the college last
May and the extent ofdruguse
on campus. We did prettywell
(the alumni seemed to think) in
justifying our actions of last
spring. It seems thatthe emo-
tions which flowed so freely
at the time can be quickly re—
called to the defense of that
episode.

Orr efforts were somewhat
less effective in "explaining
the drug situation." Some ale
umni were dismayed to hear
the belief that "marijuana
doesn't really lead straight
to heroin," and that "marl-
juana use doesn’t necessarily
mean a drug problem." Per
haps of greater interest is the
observation that the alumni
always referred to the weed
as "pot” or “grass,” while
we studiously used the term
“marijuana." So who’s cool?
Meanwhile, we were enlighte
ened with stories ofGrinnell‘s
past. Like ”Spring Riots" (an
acceptable jag back in the good
old days), or the time all of
SAGA’s silverware disap
peared, to be discovered at
the bottom of the swimming

Auction To Benefit

King Scholarships

The Martin Luther King, Jr.

World University Service
Auction is to be held this Sat-
urday, at 9:30 p.m., in Darby
Gymnasium. Traditionally the
funds from this auction have
gone to the World University
Service to facilitate the vari~
ous programs that the WUS
maintains. With the inception
of the Martin Luther King
Scholarship fund, however,
the proceeds from the aUCtion
have been divided in a ratio
of,three to one in favor of the
scholarship fund. A major
consideration for the distrie
bution of the funds is the mat-
ching fund that the alumni
have provided. The alums
match every dollar given to
the scholarship fund, doub-
ling the overall effectiveness
of any contribution made.

Of major interest this year
shall be the return of Miss
de LeCluse's chocolate cakes,
which have been the central
feature ofeveryauction. Com~
plementing Miss de LeCluse’s

pool. (Now, next Saturday niv
ght . . .). Then again, North
Campus used to be all male,
and South all female, and ne
ver the twain did . . .

Admittedly, it isn't fair to
take Off-[116‘ cuff remarks out
of context, just to have fun.
So here are some excerpts
from these same alumni’s
class letters which have fall-
en into our possession. One
of the best, and certainlynews
to the S&B:

". . . the college is not pubr
lishing the 5&8 this yearr-it
is having a rest until the fin-
ancial situation is better.
(This may not be the entire
reason.)”- (pre twenties).

On our appearance:

"I would add that I’m not at
all smitten with the style of
clothes theywearor theirbare
feet . . . (but) i saw several
girls very properly attired,
let me advise." --(pre twenr
ties). ;

"The kids at Grinnell are
functionally dressed, and I
must confess that some of it
strikes me as downright funs
ny. NO[ charming, however."
- , (forties).

Qt coed dorms:

“They do have separate bath
rooms."~(twenties).

“The women seem to have
had a good effect on themen.”
- - (forties).

"And since there are no
hours for anyone, there is a
regular free exchange of occu-
pants of the rooms. Ifyou know
what I mean. Iguess we had
the same arrangement, only it
was just a bit riskier!"-~
(mid-sixties).

On closing of the college:

”Most of the radical agita-
tors graduated last springand
this should help . . . Luckily,
reason and rationality pre-
vailed over emotion . . . Yet,
we must remember that the
administration and faculty did
not capitulate to the students.
It was the other way around
. --(twenties).

0n meals:

“We had our meals in the
Quadrangle u and delicious
meals they were." -- (pre-
twenties).

" . . . there is a sit-down
dinner at 5:30, cafeteria style
at 6:15; so you can haveitwith
more peace and ﬂair or more
speed . . . Wewereattheozls,

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Dr. Gregory Falls, executive director of the University of Washington's School of
Drama, who was invited to Grinnell to serve asa scholar—consultant for the theater
program, talks with students interested in drama during a speciallyrarranged lunch
in one of the Forum's private dining rooms. The lunch was sponsored bv Steve Grow’s
campus speaker's committee.

Dr. Falls, Dramatisl, Praises
Grinnell’s Theater Department

by Greg Butcher

”Today many people are exV
ploring nonrverbal, non»logi-
cal, nonrlinea!‘ experiences,
meanings, values; as a result,
we're seeing a quickening inn
terest in the arts."

Dr. Gregory Falls,executive
director of the University of
Washington School of Drama,
was invited to visit the cam-
pus for a weekend as a sch-
olarr consultant by President
Glenn Leggett and James Re-
eder, chairman of the theater
department, to assess Grinn-
ell’s program and to suggest
the direction and scope of its
future.

”Grinnell provides a mar-
velous potential situation for
teaching and studying theater.
I was impressed with the in-
terest and intelligence of ma-
jors. The college has made a
serious commitment in faci-
lities and space.

"The backbone of the drama
department is its production
program," Dr. Falls con*

tinued. "Nonrmajors can get L

Unstructured Free University
Offers Students Alternatives

There seems to be a lot of

question on campus as to ex»
actly what Free University is
and what it is trying to prove.
This reporter would like to
clarify the activity andpur-
pose of Free University on
the Grinnell campus.

Free University is an unofr
ficial, very loosely structured
program oflearningopportunr
ity. Dave Hechler organized
the original meetings, but he
stressed that he spoke as a
participant and not asa leader
since every student interested
has a say in the program.The
Free University attempts to
encourage students to pursue
knowledge on their own, Wilh’
out aprofessor breathingdown
their necks or influencing
their choice of subjects. As
Dave said, "Students are be
coming more and more ser-
vile in our educational sys
tem," and the Free Univer-
sity offers a chance for stu-

dents to participate in their
own education. in this prog-
ram students are able to teach
and learn from other students.
"There are a lot of people
here who have things to offer,
and it's a shame they‘re not
using them," according to Jim
Hartog, who teaches a con-
temporary jazz class for the
Free University. Free Uni-
versity also gives students
and professors an opportunity
to share thoughts and know
ledge with each other on an
equal basis.

The reaction to the classes
by those students participat-
ing has been fairly enthusiar
stic, but Jim fears that not
as many people have partici-
pated as are interested due
to Students associating the
Free University with a so
called ”long-haired, farrout
fringe,” Both Dave and Jim

volved in the total thing. I
would support the idea ofpro-
viding credit for production.
Participating in aplayismore
worthwhile than any term pap—
er on a play could possibly
be."

“The mix of courses in the
department inevitably must
reflect the strengths of the
faculty and the interests ofthe
students. The facultyaretalkr
ing vigorously with each other
and with students;and theyare
arriving at some answers."

“There isa certainminimum
core of knowledge that is the
essence of a theater major;
but when you try to define it,
there is a constant struggle.

from now. last year's notes
that worked so well often have
to be thrown out.”

One of the open questions that
Dr. Falls was to answer was
whether the college should
continue to offer a theater
major. He answered in the
affirmative and added, ”lpre-
dict we'll see the number of
majors and participants inc-
rease and as a result there
will be a demand for more
professors and support peer
ple.”

Summing up his reﬂections
on the department, Dr. Falls
said, "Flexibility is the big
thing. I think a lot of things
are being done right--a lot of
discussion, a great esprit;
that’s the value about this
type department and this type
school."

Group Stays Summer

With the early closing ofthis
college last May, a critical
view of the contemporaryedu»
cational process was under
taken. One of the results of
this analysis was the forma
tion of the Grinnell Freedom
School this pastsummeri This
school was formed by a small
group of Students concerned
with the goals and the means
of the educational process.
According to one of the parti-
cipants, the purpose of the
school was to study the con-
cepts of radical politics, to
crystalize‘these concepts by
an investigation of materials
of interest to radicals, and
ultimately to develop the abiv
lity to communicate these id-
eas to the populace at large.
Approximately eighteen SIU’
dents participated on a full
time basis with a few faculty
members intermittently being
involved. The basic means of
achieving the specified goals
was through the formation of
a collective. With this slrucr
ture, the group was able to
place a special emphasis on
eliminating the conditioned
behavior instilled into indivi-
duals by contemporary Ame
erican Society. Specifically,
the emphasis was placed on
the position of the woman in

today’s world, and her func-
tion in relation to the collect
tive living situation. Aspecial
women's caucus met to fur'
ther the understandingof “wo-
men's liberation” both in re
lation to collective living and
society in general.The exper~
iences and results of the sch-
ool are currently being pub-
lished in a report which Shall
be distributed to college offi~
cials, students, and undergr-
ound newspapers. Theaccom-
plishments of the group were
summed up as: an increase in
the knowledge of radical polir
ticals, a better developed inn
tellectual concept of thesepo-
litics and the establishment of
a favorable living situation,
utilizing the concepts which
had been studied.

Notice to pre-med students:
The annual pre-medical con-
ference for students and ad-
visors will be at the Univer-
sity of Iowa November 6. The
dayrlong conference includes
discussions, tours and talks
