added: “Comprehensive exr
nminations are iar too easy
for a generation of students that
have been taught to take exams
since they were five years old.”

Prof. Luther E. Erickson
(Chemistry) said that “in the
face or apathy and hostility
(towards comps) by students
and faculty. 1 think we have
to study alternatives," Erickson
asserted that “major modifica-
tions must be made in each de-
partment if the comprehensive
examination is to he made an
integrated experience." he
suggested that imposing un-
iform acceptance and proce-
dures ”is impossible, like
Iegislating mcrality."

“I believe the College is in
the process of deciding that it
isn't producing homogrnous
products,” said Prof. Rc'Jert F.
Voertman (Economics). “Both
the educaticnal product and
student interests are increas-
ingly ditruse, Attempts at
lInllCrt‘m requirements are up
for grabs. We are confronted
with question ol whether we can
come up With any uniform re»
quirements."

”Comps aro something that

call be subverted by departr
lrienls who don‘t want to ad-
minister them," instructor
6 r e g c r y Gurctr (History)
remarkec‘, l-L' said that the ad
vantage of Grinnell “is not
general education or comr
munity education, but the flexi-
bility. . .to provide education
tailored to individual students.”

Prof. Alan R. Jones (History)
said that the comp requirement
“has been in trouble: for five
or six years,” Jones maintained
that “the liberal arts idea is
bankrupt because departments
haven't defined it or related to
it."

In other business, Dean Wall
criticized the faculty for “not
eniorcing its own rules.”

”i dm’t care what the rules
are, but once established they
should be enfcrced,” Wall said.
lie is especially concerned with
the high incidence or students
rti2eiving grades ct incomplete
and net completing the course
work by the extended deadlines.

Monday’s iaculty meeting
marked the first time students
were admitted; three reporters
were present. President Glenn
Leggett said that the debate
between faculty members was
”more digniﬁed” than pre-
viously.

PIONEERS SPLIT;
3RD IN CONFERENCE
By Steve Wells

The Grinnell football squad
split its last two games, beating
Beloit 26-7 in the homecoming
match while losing last week to
Goa 3577.

The highpoints of the home-
coming battle were the tough
defense and hard running or
the Pioneers. The defensive
unit gave up only 34 passing
yards and allowed Beloit to
cross the 50-yard line only
three times. John Robinson,
Roy Lewis and Mario Bogs
nanno combined for 230 yards
rushing to help give the Pio»
lleers their best ground game
of the season.

Robinson was the surprise of
the ball game gaining 103 yards
rushing and picking up another
66 yards on a screen pass.

Coe's high-powered offensive
unit struck quickly in last Sat-
urday’s game giving the Ko
hawks a 2H) lead early in the
second quarter.

Roy Lewis got Grinnell on the
scoreboard in the second quar~
ter with a four~yard run but a
minute later Coe scored on a
30ryard pass to Mike l-larris.
