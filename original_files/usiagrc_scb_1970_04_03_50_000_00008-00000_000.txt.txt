Gap , Bu , and Mixed:
Winter Sports Wrap-up

Swimming:

The Midwest Conference
Championship meet wound up the
most successful season in
Grinnell swimming history and
was the most noticable feature
of a generally dull winter season
for Grinnell sports. Coach nay
Obcrmiller termed the team
performance in the loop meet
“ .the greatest team effort I
have ever witnessed,”

The individual performances in
the meet were of sufficient
quality to merit national at-
tention, and accordingly 6
Grinnell Swimmers were invited
by the NCAA to compete in the
College Division Meet in
Rochester, Mich. Four swim-
mers, Rollins, Daley, McBlain.
and Carns, came out of the meet
on March 21 with Alermerican
laurcls.

Rollins tied his own school
record of 22 2 sec, to cop a third
place finish in the 50 yd
freestyle. In a close finish, ht
took sixth place in the 100 yd
freestyle at 49 seconds even.

All four All-Americans com-
peted as a team in the freestyle
relay. The team came in ninth,
qualifying with a time of 3:193
in the finals.

Reggie Graham was entered in
the diving competition, but failed
to place. Steve Ward, scheduled
to compete in the freestyle relay
couldn't do so because of illness,

Obermiller looks forward to a
good season in the new P. a.
complex next year, in spite of
the loss of four senior lettermen.
Leaving are Co-captain Williams,
freestyler McBlain, and divers

THE LABOWITZ REPORT:

Basketball:

A weak Grinnell basketball
team ﬁnished with a season
record of 844 with a 7711 con-
ference record. Nonetheless this
represents the team’s best
performance since 1963-64, when
Grinncll came in withaB-B record
in loop play,

John Pfltsch lays much of the
team’s trouble to “Weak shooting
and a lack of speed. . ,” While
these were partially comr
pensated by hard defense work
and effective rebounding, the
team lacked experience and was
prone occasionally to fold up and
die in the middle of games.

The loss of Terry Holloway due
to a knee injury was detrimental

to team performance. Holloway
lcd last year's cagers in scoring
and rebounding, and many obs
servers felt that even the ex
Cellent performance of Bob
Burnett could not compensate for
this loss.

Burnett led in scoring and
rebounding this year, averaging
17 6 points a game, and sparked
some of the team's best perr
formances. This ranked him
third in conference scoring and
earned him a place on the Allr
Conferencesecond team.

Burnett and Scott Hanson, the
secondrhighest scorer (10.3 points
per game), will return for next
year’s play, as will Bombinski
and Beckman. This should be at
least a solid foundation for future

,teams and for a possibility of

reversing Grinnell's usually
dismal basketball performances.

Preparations Begin For Spring |.M.s

Lessons to Survive By . . .

By John Nigel Pepper

Meditation is a pleasant, if,

sometimes useful occupation.
Folks like George Herbert,
Marcus Aurelius, and the
estimable Mr. Descartes would
sometimes start meditating and
become Immortal before they
properly knew what was hapr
pening. The technique reached
the apogee of the acme of its
Zenith in Saint Ignatius of
Loyola’s Spiritual Calislhcnics
(this, of course, was before the
invention of isometrics).

The technique is essentially to
concentrate all of one's attention
on a single object of com
preliension, and to unpack its
metaphorical implications,
consequences, prerequisites, and
so forth. The object could be a
thing; a navel, for instance, one‘s
own or someone else’s. Or it could
be a sentence, e.g. “Neither a
borrower nor a plumber be,” or
”Pomegranates will be
prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the Law." I found myself
struck with one such recently:

There is a scene in W. C. Fields’
film, ”My Little Chickadee” in
which Fields, having been shown
the door by Mae West, retires
to the sheriff's office of the small
western town in which the film
is supposed to take place. As he
sits down to eat there, a Hayseed
enters. Fields entices the
guileless Rube into a Game of
Cards.

“Is this a game of Chance?,”
inquired the nick,

“Not the way I play it.” Fields
replies,

same thing.

1.2 Imagination is the essential
element of Humor.

1.21 Cause and eftect preclude

1.3 Chance excludes cause and
effect.

1.31 The actuality of causality is
not in question. Chance militates
against cause qua caus'c. A

2.0 Providence depends

Mr. Eddie Robinson to the Dallas
Young Businessmen's Asso-
ciation, 5&8, Feb.6,197ﬂ).

3.1 A good record in Grinnell
Sports is construed as conclusive
proof that God Exists.

4,0 Grinnell sports are about as
humorous as Newton’s Second
Law of Motion slipping on a
banana peel.

humorous.
