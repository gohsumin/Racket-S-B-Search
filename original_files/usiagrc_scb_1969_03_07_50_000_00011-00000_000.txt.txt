GRINNELL, Ia. -— Don
Kraitsik Wlll lead a seven-man
Grinnell College contingent to
the Midwest Conierence wres-
tling meet in Northlield, Minn.
Carleton will host the affair,
which is scheduled [Dr Friday
night and Saturday (March 7-3).

Kraitsik is regarded as one
OI the top Contenders for the 177
pound championship alter post-
ing an 11-3 record in dual meet
competition, One 01 the losses
came at 191 pounds.

The author of a 30-12 career
record, Krailsik copped the 157
pound championship in 1967, but
slipped to third in that class
last winter after missing most
at the season with an injury.

Other Pioneers that Coach
Conney Kimho expects to place
are Mason Klippel 145; and
Steve l-lntchings, 167.

Klippel is 752 for the season.
lititcliings has only a 1.7.2
mark, but has wrestled at 191
or heavyweight most oi the
time.

Grilinell's other entries are

Mike Kawaliara, 123; John
Pedel‘sen, 137; Bob LeBell, 152;
and Ted Click, 160.

A big blow to Pioneer hopes
tor a iirst division spot was
the late season loss of 1677poulltl~
er Bill Wedding by the injury
route. He was the lnup’s num-
ber two man at 160 a year ago,
and this time was expected to
be a top contender at 167.

Cornell is an oddsron iavoriie
to carry home its 25th cham~
pionship in 23 years. Likely to
produce the stiiiest challenges
to the Rams are Carleton and
St. Olai.

By NORRIS STUBBS

The Pioneer Cindermen were
defeated 54720 by Cue in an in-
door dual at Mt. Vernon. The
fact that Grinnell was repre-
sented by only six men was the
biggest iactor tor the loss,

Bill Schoolei‘ was the top
scorer tor the Pioneers taking
second in the long jump and the
400 meter and third in the high
jump. Eric Jahn won the 2 mile
event and Norris Stubbs took
the soyard dash,

is not expected to iinish strong.
However, Norris Slubbs is {a-
vored in the GOAyard dash and
Thur Evenson should finish well
in the high jump. \Vith Stubbs
anchoring the Pioneers will
make a is: class bid for the

lined recently with a pulled
hamstring) will run the second
