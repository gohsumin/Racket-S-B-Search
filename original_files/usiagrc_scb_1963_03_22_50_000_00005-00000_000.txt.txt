“Most studies of the psychol-‘

adequate,” stated Dr. Rollo May,
in his second Gates lccturc last}
Monday morning in Herrick,
Chapel The topic ot this leciul‘el
was "Creativity and Encoulliclx”:

According to Dr. May, manyl
studies of creativity have stress‘

l A serious error in the pSy-‘
chology of creativity, said May,
,has been the attempt to ﬁndl
something in an artist that isl
‘transterred to his work, Inslcad,l
the investigator should seek to,
under-stand both the internall
and external poles oi encounter.

Departing trom the main
topic slightly, May maintained
that today’s emphasis on tech-,‘

Today, May asserted, we let

the encounter; we let bombs and
missiles keep us irom a direct:

Creativity involves passion as,
