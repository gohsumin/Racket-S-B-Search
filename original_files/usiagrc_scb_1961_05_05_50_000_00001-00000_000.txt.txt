Conservative and liberal duel-
ed in Herrick chapel Wednes-
'day morning, illustrating the
many points oi contention
brought out in their two lee»
tures at Grinnell.

William-F. Buckley had lec-
tured Tuesday night on “The
‘Conservative Alternative." H.
lGraham Morison lectured later
‘Wedn day on Political Libelu
alism in Todays Politics "

, In the Wednesday morning
,panel Morison charged that “the
conservatives primary interest
iis in properzy," Liberals believe
is in property. Liberals believe
his purpose oflife isman and in
‘climincting the hariers which
l-tsnd in his way."

Buckley countered that
since 1914, a time when lib.
era! policy has been in cilcct.
“there has been n contraction
or freedom.” He said that the
conservaive believes the econ-
omy will be stabilized accord—
ing to Sey's Law, which was
iormulolcd in the mid.
eighteenth century and says
that n drop in the economy
will take cnrc oi itscli.
“You can not talk
lioreign policy today unless you
talk about foreign economic pol-
icy," Morison said.
