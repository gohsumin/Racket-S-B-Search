However, this evaluation did
not incorporate the distribu'
tion of students and ignored
the demand for each course.
Thus, there was subsmntial
variation in the t0tal enrolls
ment (measured in credit
hours) per instructor and in
the number of credit hours
per instruction point. With a
SLUdEntrfaCulty ratio often to
one, each faculty memberwor
uld be responsible for 320 crer
dits per academic year. How-
ever, the variation from this
norm was substantial, rang
ing from under IUD credit
hours registered for five pro~
fessors, and over 501 credit-
hours registered for thirteen
professors (six ofwhom taught
at least one section of Hume
anities each semester). Thus
the number of credithours per
instruction point ranged from
less than five hours to more
than thirty- five hours for the
year:

on- Humphrey election. At that
time the peak of student in-
volvement was high, and the
results were disappointing.
That, the lack of tangible re
sults from the Vietnam morar
torium, and the slowing ofmo-
mentum following the Kent
State affair have completely
discouraged students from per
litical involvement.

The Kyl-Blobaum race is
said to be one of the ten most
important Congressional el—
ections in the country. Kyl,
the incumbent, has been clas-
sified by the Progressive Mar
gazine as “one of the seven
most vulnerable Republican
hawks in the November elec-
tions."

This would seem grounds for
some slight interest, but when
Blobaum visited the Grinnell
campus, he spoke to a group
of only fifteen people. Grinnell
students it would seem, have
very little interest in Iowa

Therefore, using points as
measures of workloads, the
salary value of each pointwas
a variable involving the rela-
tionship the faculty member's
salary and the total number of
points in his workload: for a
faculty member earning $20,
000 (gross) annually, andcare
rying a twenty-point workloa d,
the cost ofhis instruction wou-
ld be $1000 1361‘ point. Since
points varied in terms ofcre»
dit hours, the cost per credit
hour of a course varied in turn
according to the total regisr
tration in the program. ,
Therefore, the high CDSL per

While it is true that untilre-

, baum's campaign had thought

that student help might be
detrimental to their campaign,
they have since reconsidered.
Grinnell students, the 20 some
involved in this campaign
have recently been canvassing
Marshalltown and, signifi-
cantly, have receivedno negar
tive reactions from the towns-
people. They have also been
helping with voter registration
in and around Grinnelland do-

Princeton Scholar Discusses Russian Culture

(Continued from page 5)

intelligentsia. Since Russia
has only one politiml party,
the intelligentsia is the near
est thing to an opposition. lt
ins what Billington called

“moral authority” in Russian
society. Connected with this,
he made a case‘ for seeing
artistic leaders like Solzhen-
llsyn as "saints who givemo-
rill purity" to the intelligent
tsia. They can give this quav
llty particularly because most
iii the “saints" have suffered
in government camps. This
purged them of “fear and pe-
ttiness" and left them come
pletely ready to challenge the
government. In turn, because‘
these people are considered
“saints," the governmentﬂ-
nds it almost impossible to
seriously harass them.

This is true because the new
artists have the scientists’and
cngineers’ support. Billing-
ton claimed that there is a
real threat of dangerously a1-
ienating the technologists if
the artists are attacked. Since
the Soviet economy, so depen-
dent on these people, isnow in

poor shape, the government
cannot risk a further SIOWr
down by any action to upset
the technical community. Th—
erefore, Billington suggested
that the government will not
prevent Solzhenitsyn from
going to Stockholm for the

Novel Prize. His opinion was
that the Party would disapr
prove but then “look the other
way and take the flak." What—
ever the government's action,
it will give the WeSt a clear
indication of where the Party
now stands on dissent.

Besides considering the
"saints" as focal points for
protest, Billington discussed
various other methods of diet
sent. One which he found par
ticularly signiﬂmnt was the
change in the civil rights moi
vement from distributing ans
nonymous tracts to sending
signed letters to Pravda and
Izvestia. Such action is less
dramatic but may be moreef-
fective. The writers cannot
be accused ofattemptingmar»
tyrdom.

Billington was ofcourse hesr
itant about predicting the odds
for intelligentsia reform of
Soviet society: “We should

n0t underestimate the power
and survival ability of the Co-
mmunist leaders;" they came
out on top of a Revolution and
have been there forhalfa cen-
tury. Still, Eillington saw der
finite positive value in what
the intelligentsia has accom-
plished thus far. He compared
the intellectual to “a battered
defensive lineman on a team
that has been constantly de-
feated. Suddenly he surges ah-
ead, and while he maynoteveu
score, the spectators are th-
rilled at having something to
cheer about . . . (they) take
greater interest in thegame.”

Billington quoted one Russian
who said: ”I feel .much closer
to Pasternal sincehe diedLl'lan
I ever didwhile he wasalive."
Apparently, the intelligentsia
has done something to revita-
lize Soviet seciety, anditsin-
ﬂuence may continue long
after the present generation
of artists. -
