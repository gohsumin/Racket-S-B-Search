xtro" Stirs Spirited Discussion

By HAROLD FUSON

Spirited discussion followed in
the wake of Tuesday's extra edi-
tion of the 5&3. Much of it was
initially conducted along the
lines “What are they trying to
do anyway?"

But as the week were on. it
became clear to most students
that the phrase a “questioning
of the whole community” meant
exactly what it said it did in
the eyes or the students who
initiated ii.

The Executive Cabinet
toured lounga Tuesday
through Thursday discussing
with groups or two or three
halls the ideas presented in
Tuesday’s extra. Tuesday

night‘s session with Loose,
North and South was typical,
it a little more spirited than
some of the discussions.

Steve Kent, SGA President,
opened the session, calling the

“More Than a Dance"

Airplane, Martin Team Movement
for Homecoming Music and Mood

“This year’s homecoming is going to be more than a
dance. It will be a theatrical as well as a unique dancing
experience,” says Boll Johnston, social coordinator. He

describes the audiovisual event
00 be staged on Oct. 22 as “we
ially unlike anything that’s ever
been here belore. it's a new
modern dance; a reflection of
today."

Tho'ambilious event will
bring to Darby gymnasium
Jellerson Airplane, a folk-
rock group, in combination
with the visual projections oi
Anthony Martin or the San
Francisco Iape center at Mills
College.

Movies, slides, and moving
color abstracts Will cover large
screens measuring 80 feet by
17 feet placed along the walls
of the gym, to create an exclt<
ing mood in tune Willi tlte mu-
sic. “We are attempling to cre-
ate an excitement of the mind,”
said Johnston, Marlin presented
some of his visual projections
here last spring at a showing in
Roberts Theater.

Johnston describes this addi.

. tion of visual eitects to llie mu-
sical aspects of a dance atmo-
sphere as “the latest develop~
mom in the pop music iield. Its
purpose is to stimulate in a way
more than just through lriuSIC."

“This will be an event spe-
ciﬁcally geared to the indi-
vidual," stressed Johnston.
“No and should feel that a
date is required to attend."
Ha cited the narrow appeal It

“couples only" as a weak-
ness at this traditional home
coming dance. “This is de-
olgned to appeal to more than
just dancers I hope that the
entire campus will take the
opportunity In see this event
at some time during lhe eve-
ningl"

Music and projections will be
constantly changing throughout
the evening. “We are not rely-
ing on crepe paper to provide
the mood," said Johnston, “but
rather see this inter-media
Combination as the stimulus of
a very alive, moving feeling."

Mchregor On
Rights Movement

By KRYS NEUMAN

Congressman Clark MacGre-
gor (Rep, Minnesota), in a
spirited coffee hour last Friday
on “The Civil Rights Movement
Today," maintained that the
white backlash killed the Civil
Rights Bill of 1966. He predict.
ed that there will be no open
occupancy legislation in the
coming year. MacGregor went
on to say, however, that he
thinks the reaction is just a
temporary “blackliick” in Con-
gress and that the “body politlo
is sympathetic” to the light for
civil rights.

Alan Jones (history), the oth-
er panel member, slated that
the question today is whether or

suggestions — hypotheses to im-
tiate serious discussions.”

Discussion then ranged wide-
ly over all aspects of campus
life: social, academic and per-
sonal.

in the area of women's hours,
much was said about what one
student called “repression by
the system" of the “potential
for responsibility.”

Some students, especially
girls, expressed doubts about
the wisdom ot completely
abolishing hours for freshman
women. As one girl said,
“Girls are not raised the
same way as bays," and need
some form oi guidance.

Karen Lauterbach. AWS
Board President, posed the
question, “Do girls consider
hours a legitimate form or
guidance?” Loud commotion
arose in reply. One girl on-
swered that “guidance should
not be punitive” but “should be
a constructive thing." Another
suggested that maybe "some
kind of initial freshman hours
might be a good thing.”

In the area of extending the
open dorms privilege, the only
real objection came from one
boy who said, “in have to buy
a bathrobe.”

lie was asked if he thought
this was an insoluble problem.
“No," was [he slouthearted re:
ply.

A number or students ques-
tioned the hours proposed for
open dorms" extension. Tho
hours proposed in Tuesday’s
5&3 were 11 arm. in 7 p.m.‘
Monday through Thursday; ll
nun. to 11 p.m. Friday and
Saturday; and 1 [Ln]. lo 1
porn. on Sunday. Many stu-
denls felt that 1 pm. to 0 pm.
might be a more reasonable

period of time on weekdays.
Support seemed unanimous
for some sort of extension of
open dorms to a daily basis.
however. .

In the academic area, I
large majority of hands were
raised when the question was
asked, “How many of yogi
would attend a voluntary lnle -
im session the last week or s
of Christmas vacation?" A go
deal of interest was also
aroused in the idea of holding
interdisciplinary seminars.

Several students expressed
the feeling that the general
lack of responsibility incul-
cated by the rule system led
to irresponsibiilty in the social
and academic areas as well.
As one girl said about the pres-
ent academic structure, thero
is a “general feeling of n lack
of responsibility to what yolf
are already commiited to do.’
Another said, “People are lesl
likely to initiate any kind ol
activity (under the preseni
structure)."

As the discussion closed, it
seemed certain that there was
a great deal yet to be said,
It seemed also that many, it
not most, of the ideas offered

dent body. As Miss Lnutera

bacb said, “None oi us all

cal attitude toward the slain!

Cowles Harvests Felzer Title

By ANDY ISAACS

Darby gym witnessed the tra-
dilicnal Fctzer Sing last Sun-
day night as six mixed choruses
presented their contributions for
publick applause (sic).

Cowles Hall retired the trophy,
having placed first for the lhird
year in a row. Cowles and
Haines presented “Iowa." “Rock
Island Line," “Country Corn
Flakes." and “Little Brown
Church in the Vale," for its
theme of “lows." Dressed as
farmers, the Cowles - l-laines
group was the only group to
write its own words to some of
the songs.

North Younker, having placed
second {or its third consecutive
year, retired its plaque. North
teamed up with James this year
to present “The Mind Speaks,
the Heart Sings," a Collection of
Negro spirituals.

With little doubt, Langan and
Loose deserved the booby prize
for their presentation, “Old Grin-
nell." IL was, by the way, Lan~
gan‘s first entrance since the
revival of the contest. Langan
and Loose offered rho Grinnell
Hymn (with appropriate ges-
lures), an ode to coeducation. a
low giggles, and a director who
was wearing a coat too large
for him. It soon became appar-
ent that the singers were rath-
er hazy about the words to their
songs, and the presentation grew

more amusing as it wore on. Thu
singers sac down to thundei'ou
applause.

Other hall pairs with tho
themes of their presentations
were South-Read. the South and
the Civil War; West-Main, “tho
salt green tossing sea, . . . A
tallship, the wheelslclck, tho
Wind's song, the white salls
shaking . . a "; MearSrDibblo,
Salute to Women.
