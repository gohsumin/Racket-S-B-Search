Two nights before Wolfis switched ulcers with Bob,

The staff got together to finish the job.

So we sat down to write the Noel number twelve,

Into the past, '65, we did delve.

When President Leggett moved into the house,

Not a creature was stirring, not even Dean Stausa.

The Big 23 were all snug and in bed

As Thompson and Winters through Langan did tread.

They searched through a basement that had gone to pot)

They found not the pot, but they found quite a lot.

And then came one of the year's greatest pleasant:

When Dean Slocum gave us her last Christmas
presence.

And old Bobby Sauers is gone, what a pity;

Twas because our sweet freshmen appear rather

spiny?

With old Murray and friends we did cause quite a hli
When our printers botched up the word meant to be
“spit."
Staffers rushed to D. C. for a peace holiday;
Others hung by their heels capturing FCSA.
And then there was Selma and poverty; too,
To take up the time of the 3&3 crew.
Other Big Ones this year included Old Ike—-
eya-Seki, friend Albert, the Grims and the like.
This year marked farewell to our fine SPE,
But we all carried on — there’s a world yet to see.

Academic ideals are all right, we do guess,
But there’s nothing like knowing you’re safely 25
When you flunk all your courses, what's gone is
bygone,
You’ll continue your studies at the U. of Saigon.
It’s twmsevenvthirty for those who return,
But it’s better than war, the things they will learn.

Out attitudes puzzled an all-wet encampment:
“Carl boo—booze be cured by hall system revamp—

The key to the problem turned out to be locks.

And then there are people and things hard to rhyme;
We’ll bunch them together to save lots of time;
W e've got proctors who folk dance and drink at the R91
And a God Squad to guard against B 8: G's hex.
We’ve got Prescott to write us some new JLA‘s
And a science addition for the profusion of plays.
We've got Eldridge directing our biggest spring riot.
And running the Forum, whoever will try it.
The work in Des Moines may be headed by Baay,
But so may the Co—op, for which we Won’t cry.
To Borman and Lovell, Stafford, Schirra—
You‘re closer to heaven than Maher Baba.
And now we are finished, the Noel is done;
John looks up and chortles. the year has been fun.
It could have been better, but what do they say?
“In the end all that counts is your own DNA."

 

Thurston Ouiis Post. Cites Need
In Several Areas, Suggests. Plans

“This evening I'm neither as
embittered or pessimistic as my
two predecessors." said Paul
Thurslon in opening his farewell
address to the Student Senate
Wednesday night.

Thurston accounted ior this at-
titude by What be labeled his
“watchful waiting" policy.

The retiring Coil-[P president
commented that he had had no
special proposals, but rather had
Waited for issues to arise.

Among them were the north
campus residence question, the
need for better mental health ta-
cilities, and a needed academic
challenge.

”Students are ready and willing
to be challenged," said Thurston,
"and are anxious for positive and
creative leadership in this area of

academia. i make this an appeal
to President Leggett."

In discussing his contact with
the north campus question. Thurs-
ton put ioruh his recommendations
for hall change. His plan consists
of sexually integrating north and
south campuses. In addition, the
residents will move between halls
from year to year.

Thurston suggested that fresh-
men dormitories with a resident
adviser living in Ihe housepresi-
dent's suite and having rule en-
forcement responsibilities could be
set up.

“It is also essential," he said,
“that upperclassmen live in the
freshmen dormitories, at about a

JLA: Its History And Future

By DICK SHADY

The Junior Liberal Arts exam
will not be given at the beginning
of next semester.

Last spring the faculty resolved
to place a one-year moratorium
on the exam and asked that “the
ﬁnal disposition of the examina-
tion be considered at some time
in the iuiure in conjunction with
a broad, comprehensive evalua-
tion of the entire curriculum."

The JLA was first proposed by
a special faculty curriculum com»
mittee in February or 1959. The
committee odvocaied that an ex-
uminauon be given to juniors,
with the objectives ot increasing
students' responsibility ior their
own education and stimulating a-
chievement in the liberal arts.

A special committee to design
such an exam was Elected, and
on Nov. 25, 1959, ii proposed a
twopart exam, consisting of the
Area Tests or the Graduate Rec-

 

ords Examination and an essay
section.

The test itself would examine
the ability of the student to “state
and discuss the similarities, analo-
gies, and diiierences among tine
major disciplines."

The original approach (using
specific texts) was abandoned in
favor of a “concepts" test. Nearly
one year later, on Oct. 19. 1960,
the Junior Exam committee prm
posed that each department sub-
mit to the Dean a list of “basic
Concepts and dominant issues" in
each discipline.

In January of 1961, the faculty
approved the proposal which pro<
Vided for Area Tests and a "con-
cepts" test on be given on the
class of ’63 in January, 1962.

The ﬁrst test would be experi-
mental and limited, with the Area
Tests counting twice as much as
the essays in grading. Four grades
uhigh pass, pass, low pass, and

no credit—were m be assigned,
with tour credits awarded [or a
high pass and two credits for pass
or low pass

The experimental and resnrlo
tive nature of the ﬁrst test was
emphasized, along with the fact
that "evaluations will be used in
making judgments regarding the
student’s competence ior graduate
study, employment, etc." Students
were required to take, but not to
pass, the nest, and there was no
eiiect on the grade-point.

The committee selected three
