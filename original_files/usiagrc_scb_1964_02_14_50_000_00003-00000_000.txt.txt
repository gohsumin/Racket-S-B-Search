Play to Be Given Here Feb. 22-23

Paul Claudel spent twenty
year on “Tidings Brought to
Mary” and revised it seven
times The preparations of the
Grinnell Players tor the pre.
sentatlon of this play have been
almost as elaborate, if not so
lengthyr

Cast before Christmas vaca»
tion, the play has been in re-
hearsal six weeks under the di-
rection of Nod Donahoe (dra-
mal). Sets have been designed
by guest technical adviser Wil~
liam Sherman of Bennington
College“ Sherman has also su-
pervised lighting and costumes.
The music for this presentation
of “Tidings Brought to Mary"
is the product of James Yan»
natos (music).

The story concerns Violaine
Vercours who contracts leprosy

apron and told him to chop on her
head and send In io market.

Meanwhile. tho hired hand had ra-
suniod his roareh for on improved
formula.

Ed. Note:

According to Mr, Patter-sum
the subject matter of this let-
ter concerns the Junior Li <
ei‘al Arts Exam-experiment;
and interpretation is left open
to the individual student.

- The Spot to Boycott —ror steak:

 

from a gratuitous kiss she be-
stows on a young man whom
she loves, as they partu Vio-
laine goes to a leper colony.
and the young man ends up
marrying Violaine’s s i s t e r,
Marar On Christmas Eve Mata
brings her dead child to the lep.
er cave where Violaine is liv-
ing, and a miracle occurs; the
child is reborn, The final part of
the play, which occurs after the
death of Violaine, explores the
reaction of the rest of the char-
acters to the realization 0! a
miracle.

Donehoe admonished, “What
happens is not what the play
is about. in a sense ityis an
Easter play set at Christmas-
tide; it is one long metaphor.

“The‘play can easily slip into
a pageant; but if it does, we
will have failed, This play more
than anything must be about
real people who have hands
and feel, and entrails."

The play was chosen in part
because of its relevance to the
times. Donahoe said, “Anyone
may become a martyr when
times get rougherr”

Performances will be given
February 22 and 23 in Roberts
Theatre.
