Beeman Sees Intellectual Potential
In More Faculty-Student Contact

To the Editor:

Just today a list canto into my
hands that was compiled earlier
in the year by the Board ot ite-
ligion. For some reason it was
never distributed to the student
body, at least to my knowledge.

I don’t know how the list was
compiled or what the circum-
stances were that motivated those
who undertook making it up, but
i do know that in the idea behind
its being drawn up is the remedy
tor a problem that exists now on
the Grinnell campus.

Quite simply the list consists of
members of the taculty who would
\he willing to entertain students. or
just talk and discuss with them
outside of the classroom. Beside
many of the names are listed in-
terests that these people have,
ranging from Indians of the South-
west to astronomy.

Freshmen arriving on campus
must really feel cheated to tind
the sad state or attairs that stu-
dent-iaculty relations are in out:
side of the classroom. For the
most part, the contact students
have with their instructors is
limited to the three or four hours
they spend in class with him or
her each week. Somewhere there
is a ritt that keeps any further
Contact from evel‘ developing.
Even in the new Forum one
notices immediately two segregat-
ed groups of coffee drinkers 7
inc lty and students. The recent
serlea of student-few v coffees
un Thursday and Friday after
noons which were designed to
break down this barrier have been
[or the most part total flops in
this respect. Only two or three
taculty members ever show up
at all (despite the fact that simul-
taneously, large groups of them
are paying for their coffee and
segregating themselves in a cor-
ner ot the grill). Even the few
brave souls who do come rarely
return.

students don’t help bridge
this gap either. Too ottcn anyone
who is seen talking to a protessor
is accused of “lll'owmnosmg” or
trying to pad his gradepoint. In
cynical society of his peers it
can‘t be understood that he or
she might really like the man
and have a genuine interest in
his opinions on a subject. We have
some of the finest academic
minds in the country here at Grin»
noll, as well as a student body
selected on the basis 01 their in-
tellectual drive, among other
things, The two in conjunction
with each other could create a
real academic atmosphere 7 not
one that quits tunctioning as soor.
as classes are over on Saturday.

The result could bring some real
excitement to this campus and
community, now condemned by
many as being dead.

We must realize that even in
the wastes ot Iowa, real culture
and intellectual stimulation can he
created. and the most satistying
way to dorthls (also the cheapest)
is simply to let the natural spon-
taileity oi the students come in in-
torinal contact with the people
who get the most pleasure trom
seeing this and working with it7

To the Editor:

it has occurred to me on several

disturbs me is the tact that Light-

coniorm. On a certain level. what
makes good Bach perhaps also
makes good Dylan. However, this
docs not mean that because i like
Bach I must also like Dylan. it
happens that folk music irritates
me. Am 1 then a lesser person
than David?

Yet, variance of taste is not the
question. The real point is an as-
sumption which Lighthourne
makes which is implicit but never-
theless blatant. David seems to
tool that because i am unable to
appreciate Miss Redpath’s talent
I am a crass and superficial crea-
lure. in other words, David ap»
pears to assume that he knows
something about liie that I do
not.

Lighthoul‘ne’s column is clotted
with a ludicrous irony (it irony
can he ludicrous), As a member-
or the jean-Jacket generation, Dar
vid supposedly prides himself on
his enlightened tolerance, That tol~
erance is purportedly hascd on the
realization that a person's clothing,
economic status and mannerisms,
and his taste in music and art are
not valid measurements at a per»
son’s worth 7 and that aesthetic
sensitivity cannot be equated with
intellectual or emotional sensitiv-
ity.

As a man of the world, David
should know that appearance is
precisely what the word meank
that it is only outwarancss. A
beard and sandals can hide a mind
that is sordid and malicious as
well as can the resplendence of
Hart, Shaffner, and Marx. So who
is to say which evterior hides the
honest soul? There is as much
