Although I maintain several major reservations
against the proposed constitution changes adopted
by the Senate, 1 do not necessarily urge defeat of
the proposal through student body ieierendum.

Student government at Grinnell urgently needs
a more viable dperdting mechanism, and the rein-
vesting oi the Senate with legislative authority is
consistent with the idea of distributing govexm
mental power among the Senate and the joint
boardsi With son elections rapidly approaching, a
new method of electing hall officers in conjunction
with residence hall innovations is an immediate ne«

cessity.

I believe an additional positive factor in the pro-
posed revision is the establishment of the office of
student coordinator a position necessitated by the
ever-expanding administrative functions at the SGA
and by the lack of communication between various
faculty and student government committees and the

student body itself,

Putting aside for a moment these practical con-
sideratiuns, there are several facets of the proposed
revision which need careiul scrutinyi Electing the
ten senators tit-large will mean that thirty—one Slu<
dent ofﬁces, or nearly every inﬂuential campus pas
Iition, will be elected by the student body as a

Whole.

Personal acquaintance and an intimate knowl-
edge of views could easily cease to be determining
factors in all lndividual's election. An essential cri~
terion for election In the Senate could become,
Literature, merely the maintenance of a campus

“name” for oneself.

I must also question the ability of these ten at-
large senators to effectively ascertain campus opin-
ion on major issues. Although certain more or less
artificial means for ascertaining this opinion have
been provided, i.e. required attendance by senators
at all house meetings, I feel that hall representa-
tion is inherently better suited for the effective rep-
reseiltatlon oi student viewpoints.

I repeat that the advantages and improvements
suggested by this proposed revision are indeed nu—
merous, certainly more numerous and wellrfounded
than the practical considerations mentioned abovei

A5 Student interest,

Contact. and involvement are

essential components of an eftective student gov-
ernment organization, each student must decide
whether this new Senate and the office at student
coordinator can best promote these components.
