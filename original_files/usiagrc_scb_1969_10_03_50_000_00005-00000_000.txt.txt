October 3. I969

Peterson, received an Identical
letter, but said It would not al-
fect her decision in the case,
The defense subsequently sub-
mitted a motion for a mistrial
when Mrs. Peterson was not
excused, but was overruled.

As the Conspiracy trial con-
tinues, attention is beginning to
focus on the coming “second.
battle of Chicago,” massive
antiwar actions planned for
October 8711 by SDS, the Black
Panthers, and the Young Lords.

TWO "ACTIONS" PLANNED

There will be two separate and
diiierent actions in Chicago,
both aimed at supporting the
Vietnamese and getting the
U.S. out of Southeast Asia.

One action, planned by the
National Office “Weatherman"
faction 0! SDS, includes a mass
rally and march, but will prim-
arily’ focus on mobile street-
lighting, aimed at increasing
the militancy of the white
movement by showing that
whites are willing to light.

The 'other action, called
jointly by the niack Panther
Party, the Young Lords, and
the Revolutionary Youth Move-
ment II (RYMJI) group of
SDS, will consist of a "disc!-
plined mass march” through
black, white and Latin working
class communities, to be pre«
ceded by three days of action.
The build-up includes support
activities for the Black Panther
Breakfast for Children program
and the Lord's Day Care Cen-
ter, a high school and junior
college hoycott and march to the
Board of Education, a rally
around the Chicago Internati0n<
ll Harvester Plant, and an
action intended to protest "in-
human practices of Chicago
hospitals — such as the invol~
untary sterilization of black and
Latin women."

The two sets of plans come

in the wake of the much dis-
cussed SDS "split" last sum.
mer. Aiter purging the PN-
gressivo Labor Party, two
groups were leit contending tor
SDS control —- RYM-II and
Weatherman (from lollisinger
Bob Dylan; "you don’t need a
weatherman to know which
way the wind blows")

SDS unanimously agreed to
a mass action in support or the
Vietnamese people and against
U. s. imperialism to be held
in Chicago roughly coinciding
With the Conspiracy trials.
Planning was left to the
National Office Controlled by
the Weatherman faction.

TO BUILD A “RED ARMY”

Since the summer SDS con-
vention, Weatherman has devel»
oped a plan or action, produced
leaﬂets, and organized urban
working-class communities to
bring people to Chicago. The
Weathermen have been organ-
lzing under the theme of “Bring
the War Home." They see the
action in Chicago as an oppor-
tunity to hegin building a “red
army to fight on the side of
the Vietnamese, the blacks, and
oppressed people everywhere."

The superrmilltancy of
Weatherman, however, has an«
tagonized many 0! the New
Left, The plans {or “mobile
street lighting" are viewed by
some as a masochistic suicidal
attempt to Create “instant
history."

AS a result (if the disenchant—
ment with Weatherman, RYM-
II, the “other" 505 group
formed a quick coalition with
the Panthers and Lords to draw
up alternate plans for the Chi-
cago action. Most observers be-
lieve the RYM-IT Panthericrd
proposals are certain to attract
much larger numbers of par-
ticipants.

Both groups are anticipating

SCARLET AND BLACK

repressive measures by
Chicago’s police.‘ “You could
get busted tor standing on the
comer and saluting the ﬂag,"
commented a Chicago organ-
izer. Demonstration leaders
view the police actions on the
opening day or the trial as
merely a “\varmrup” (or things

CALL TO CHICAGO

While millions have spoken
out against the war, millions
more have remained silent
in their opposition. Recogniz-
ing that these silent millions
can be a great iorco in
bringing the aggressive,
white-supremacist war to an
end, as well as being the
basis or a poweriul antirim-
perlalist movement, we call
for a mass action In Chicago
from Oct. 8 to ll, consisting
oi 4 days of programs and
militant actions designed to
serve the needs oi the people
of the U.S., and to connect
those needs with the fight
against U.S. aggression in
Vietnam. We call {or the ac-
tion to culminate in a mass
militant disciplined march
behind the demand U.S.
GET OUT OF VIETNAM
NOW and other demands
which will link the struggles
oi the exploited and ap—
pressed people of the U.S.
with the struggle of the
Vietnamese.

We call for this action as
the start of the YEAR OF
SOLIDARlTY WITH THE
PEOPLE OF VIETNAM.
