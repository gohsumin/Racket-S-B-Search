To Rose

Rose had a rope,

Tied to a summer tree,

And looped to life.

She learned to leap with her arms,

To grab with her toes, ‘

And to lean with her shoulders

Until the ground became polished pink,
And she was propelled through the wind
With a whoosh . . .

Rose lived on a green and yellow farm in Indiana,
And dreamt of rivers, and of fresh fruit,
And of rape on warm shivering evenings.

When we're sixtye four

Torn clothes~and clean,
Rumbling to the others
Cigar- butt, cane, battered hat
Sufﬂing walk, bent back
Eyes seeing yesterdaynfull of tears
Lot a family though”
Family of man.
“Get out of here old man,
Station's closin‘ up."

“Root- House Blues"

Went to bed at ten, woke up at four
Realized I couldn’t sleep no more.
Pulled on my pants. Put on my shoes.
Figured out I had the Root— House Blues.

Went down to the Root House in the foggy dew.
Figured I‘d get myselfa root or two.

Sky she clouded over and begn to rain.
Shoveled out the silence from inside my brain.

Back at the house, rain on my skin

My brother was inside, he wouldn’t let me in.
Sittin' by the fire, dryin' his boots

The rain fatllin’ down on me and my routs.

”Hell," I finally muttered deep inside my heard

"I think what’s goin' on out here is pretty wierd.
I'm going to watch pneumonia, maybe, can‘t ya see?
If I were God or Jesus, would you do this to me?”

Ipeered through the window, it was a quarter to five.
Iwondered to myself, "Am I really alive?"

I threw a headlong glance up into the sky

To consult the clouds. They said [was going to die.

Just then, St. Peter and a lU-piece band

Came out of the clouds to bring me to the Promised Land.
So I let go my roots with a joyful shout.

Turned around in time to see the sun come out.

Oh yeah.
William Knecht

Rose ran away from home
Every time that she swung on the rope.

Sequel To An Odyssey

Gaunt as a dancer with the club foot
“Is strange, conceives of terror pure
As white as death is pure, is sure
As a mute is sure, is gay, burns,
Eats into himself, dances, returns,
Smiles that here limps one of soot,
Here fire, heath, madness, all are sure,
Cancerous, are carnivors that lust
To wrench the heart from all it must
Have

"So [am all grotesque come home.
Much is happened. In isolation
So quickly one grows old, needs to tow
The odyssey home, the celebration
Returns. Limps. Is strange. Is sure.

, Ed Hirsch

The rocking chair rocks
In memory of one who

Sat there long ago.

Returned

if one to the night
should slip from his bed
while the moon cracks
into parts

and then should awaken

to voices under the north porch
where halfa child goes live
without prayer or thought,

listen. if then there are voices, my voices,
voices of the‘predator, the skeleton,

the deciduous forest mad with decay,
come quickly. a stranger in his I'Jntasies

dances naked under the north sky.

he will be waving his clothes over his head
and these will prove the crude

remnants ofa shell.

be unafraid. is he not simply
an old section of the heart

grown master in its own house?
