RESISTANCE PAN-EL PLANNED

(Ed. Note: Ron Wood. on
off-campus senior psychology
major, is not afﬁliated with
the Iowa Draft Resistance
Urdon or any other political
action organization. Feeling
that “this is an issue that
ought to he mldered at
Grinnell." Wood has organ-
Ized the December 1 panel
discussion an Electoral Pol-
itics, Draft Resistance and
Civil Liberties scheduled for
4 pm. in the South lounge),

By RON W001)

As the second nationallyor-
ganized day of anti—draft demons
strations and resistance ap<
preaches, now seems a good
time to examine alternatives.
1 have asked representatives of
different organizations to come
to Grinneli December 1 to air
the issues.

Steve Morris, a member of
the Iowa City Draft Resistance
Union, (DRU), has agreed to
come representing that organi-
zation. An Air Force veteran.
he was one of three Iowans
to surrender his draft Card to
Federal authorities on October
16.

The position of the Draft Re»
slstance Union is best stated

by a quotation from one or
their handbills:

“The Resistance Is a move
ment of draft ago men who
are opposed to the war in
Vietnam Ind the policies til
the U.S. throughout the Third
World. We are saying that
our dissent and protest has
been ignored. We on saying
that mere dissent and pro-
Iest are no longer enough.
We call on all Americans to
refuse to light this war and
to resist the draft. . . Turn
in your card or join our sup-
port demonstration.”

Randy Miller, a senior history
major at the University of Iowa,
will represent Students for a
Dcmocralic Society (5135). This
organization, which has not
sponsored any national mobili-
zation since the first of the
demonstrations, is a radical
left group. I think its position
should be heard by anyone can-
templatirlg activism.

Dr. David Metzler, professor
of biochemistry at low: State
University and editor of the
Iowa Peace Bulletin, will rep-
resent the Iowa Political Action
Council for Peace (FAX). PAX
—founded at Grinnell only last
Saturday afternoon in the South

and adult organization attempt-
ing to take the peace issue
into every state precinct and
to raise support in both major
parties for peace platforms and
candidates. it includes “old
line” peace workers at well as
potential candidates.

I finally approached mem-
bers of the Iowa Civil Libertieil
Union (ICLU) and have been
assured that a member of the
Executive Board will be pres-
ent here on Dec. 1. He
will speak on the legal and
libertarian aspects oi the var-
ious forms of war protest. They
(the ICLU) need no introduction
as defenders of individual civil
liberties and the democrsno
process.

The Iowa board will have two
cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court this year, one of which
is the Des Moines armband
issue—a political protest in pub-
lic schools where students wear-
ing protest armbands found
themselves in trouble with
school administrators.

Those undecided about the
form of their participation in
practical protests will, hopefully
find the air cleared by thls
discussion; PPFE pays for the
coffee.

A STUDENT OPINION

ANONYMOUS STUDENT
ANSWERED

By CONCERNED BLACK STUDENTS

There is indeed an increasing concern among Negroes on this
campus with the Negro subculture, but it is a concern that is ap«
parently little understood by the white students here.

A sociological survey taken last semester indicates that only
43% of the Negroes' primary group relations are with other Ne-
gmesl This moans that the majority oi these relations (57%) are
found in interaction with white students. We are not really aware
of any groups of Negro students that "eat together. walk together.
talk together, dance together, and generally spend time together
exclusively." .

We feel further, that the reasons you give for the Increased
numbers of Negroes on the Grinnell campus are all but totally er-
roneous. The increasing number of Negroes on this campus has
resulted, in most cases, from the active “recruiting" program of
the college. Regrciiully, the National movement of which you
speak involves a minorlty of American Negroes, and very few, if
any, of the Negroes on this campus. The isolation of a small, white
liberal arts college prevents their participation in this movement
on the level that other Negro college students have entered it.

All of this, combined with the apparent purpose of a “liberal”
education to indoctrinate the intelligent Negro into the White so‘
cieiy, has indeed caused a situation worthy of much concern. For
the Negroes on this campus, are, contrary to what you seem to
believe, painfully lacking in the really important elements of the
American Negro subculture,

The chalky, Sterile Grinnell environment forces the Negro to
relinquish his subcultural ties. He accepts the artificial standards
of the artificial college community in order to survive, in order to
be accepted. But the real crime is that in relinquishing the “old
values," The Grinnell Negro is also asked to relinquish his own
heritage: a heritage he should exhibit with pride, not store away
with his travel luggage.

The ”exclusion of the white world” is not the evil form of dis-
crimination that you describe, The ”self isolation” that you speak
of is imperative to the Negroes' search for an ethnic “soul.” This
inrgroup interaction is a necessity for the Negro if he is to main-
taiu his identity in a world which tries to destroy it. in direct con—
tradiction to what you have said, there is not enough of the Negro
Subculture on this campus, a subculture that actively works to
build the Negro’s pride in himselfl Ethnic pride does not mean so<
clal separation; ethnic apathy can mean social annihilation.

Today the American Negro seeks himsell; we here at Grinnell
are not. too late to start looking.
