However, his subyecls especially the students
drd not, at first, take very kindly to the King's

Offers Proof of Brutality

Last week's S843 Contained a column I wrote
about the Student Nonvrolcnt Coordinating Com-
mittee. Since that. time se eral students have
told me that. the article {Jr dtly overstated the
active. opposition or Southern low-cnlorcemenl
agencies to integration programs They have also
told me tliat>polch brutality does not actually
exist. except in verv isolated instances. I do not
believe it.

In Amm'icus, Georgln, this August, three SNCC

workers were arrested, beaten repeatedly by po—
lice, and chll'ged with ”inciting to insurrection,"
a capital Crime in Geol‘ ' , This charge was last
'sed against Communist Party organizers in the
930’s. _The three were, leading a pcacelul dem-
o -ti-alion in the Negro section 01‘ Americns.
Other demonstrators and spectators were beaten
with clubs and kicked by police. About ten re»
Quired stitches to close head wounds One man
suffered a broken leg, when police officers stood
on h arms and legs and beat him with clubs.
Electric cattle prodders left burns on many of
the demonstrators.

In Albany, Georgia, a Negro minister was

Both were beaten by guards.

A l-ryeur old Negro boy. Wcltcn lticSainc,

These are not the most brulal and disgusting
incidents winch have occurred in the South. bu‘
they get the point across Anyone who believes
that police brutality to Negroes in the South
as not a reality simply has his head stuck in
thc sand.

And why doesn't somebody do something a-
bout it? Given the doubltul premise that the
Kennedy administration really cares what her»
