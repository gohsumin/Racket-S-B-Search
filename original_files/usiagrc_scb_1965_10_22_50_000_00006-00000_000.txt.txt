In this tour or back stage we
have arrived at the person re-
sponsible really, basically respon-
sible for the whole show. It is he
who chooses the play, finds the
actors, delegates the authority for
the technical jobs, oversees both
the from stage and back stage
work and finally worries himself
sick on opening night. who is this
father-iigure. this supreme au«
thority and seat or all knowledge?
The director, or course.

The Grinnell theatre is extreme.
1y lucky to have available two
ﬁne directors; Mr. Edward (Ned)
Donahoe and Mr. Richard (Dick)
Meyer. Donahue is presently on
leave. so Meyer has assumed the
schedule. iie oversees not one play
but many; acting as supervisory
director for student directed workr
shops, balancing Roberts engage-
ments and the budget, and direct-
ing the major productions.

It all started with drama as an
extra-curricular activity in high
school. At Drury College in Spring-
iield, Mo, Meyer majored in Eng-
lish and art. But during this time
he was active in college drama,
and directed the Springfield Com-
mllnity Theatre. One summer va-
cation he acted and directed in a
television play which appeared on
the Eddy Arnold Show. Next, with
liberal arts degree in hand, he
went to Northwestern University.
where he got his master’s in thea-
tre, Arkansas State College
snapped him up. He headed their
drama department for tour years.
Notre Dame next had the good
tortune to have him as proiessor
of radio and television media in
their theatre department. But the
call of the small liberal arts col~
lege proved too much. Meyer leit
Notre Dame to come to Grinnell
in 1957.

On his last leave, Meyer was
assistant to Whitehead and Kazan.
Arthur Miller's newest play Aiter
the Fall was being produced at
Lincoln Center in New York and
Kazan and Whitehead were pro-
ducing it ior Miller. Meyer said at
Kazan: “He is one of the {ow
creative geniuses around. He is a
quiet-spoken man but there is a
ieeling of dynamic energy sur-
rounding him." Other words Mey-
er used were “no-nonsense” and
“magnetic." and there was much

respect in his voice.

When he returned from Lincoln
Center, Meyer wrote a hook on
his experiences in New York. He
has also had some academic pa-
pers published.

Since he has returned to the ac-
tive duty at Grinnell, Meyer has
produced and directed Oedipus
Rex (last fall term) and The
Knock (last week-end).

When he was asked what he
hopes for the iuture oi the drama
department, he spoke of integrat-
ing the theatre with the campus.
"The theatre is a part or life, it
is more than entertainment. It
should generate in campus theatre
a kind of academic enthusiasm al—
so." He also wishes to continue
the weekrinrNew York trips.

There are new tour workshops
in rehearsal: see How They Run,

Majority Leader at the us.
House, when he visits Grlniiell
November 17 and 18 as “Politir
cianrlnrResidence”.

leadership role in the passage oi
medicare, aid-toreducation. and
excise tax cut legislation by the
39th Congress. He also supported
home rule tor the District or C0-
lumbia and repeal of section 14h

He has compiled a liberal voting
record and has protessed faith in

modern America. His Oklahoma

‘Des Moines Proieci' Group
Meets. Determines Leaders

Approximately 35 Grinnell stu-
dents interested ln assisting the
Des Moines Project met Monday
alternoon to discuss the project
and to choose leadership tor the
Grinnell group.

A steering committee was chosen
on a volunteer basis. It is composed
oi chairman Bonnie Tinker, Dave
Gibson, Rick Exner, Nancy Young,
Susan Goldberg, Wendy Foreman
and Jeff Herl. Jean Vandervoort
and Nancy McCanon will act as
advisers to the committee. Jan
Smith and Hilary Fried accepted
the positions of secretary and
treasurer respectively.

To begin the meeting, Andy
Bushnell described his experiences
interviewing residents of the area
under concern. The area is not in
classic slum condition now, he
said, but could deteriorate badly
it its residents were not organized
to express their interests to the
city government.

or particular concern are sev4
eral urban renewal projects which
are planned in the area. rean Vans
dervoort felt that these programs
WDuld result in the construction of
middle income housing and would
force the movement of the present
residents into new depressed
areas.

Bonnie Tinker emphasized that

the project is not a Grinnell~dl~
rected activity. Grinnell students
would work on the project only it
they were asked to do so by Billy
King, the project’s tun-time work-
er.

Various methods or collecting
money were also discussed. Some
of those present advocated asking
for contributions on a hall basis,
while others felt that individual
contributions would be easier to
collect and would avoid conﬂicts
of principle involving the right oi
the majority to allocate lunds
against the will of the minority.
