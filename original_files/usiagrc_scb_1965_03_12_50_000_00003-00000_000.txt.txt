Herzog One Up on Custer,- llis Last
Stand Will Most Likely Go on and . ..

To the Editor:

There has been some ques-
tion as to whether poor, oit-
drooling Herzog held the poi-
sonv pen responsible tor the
demagogic speech suggesting
that student government dis-
solve.

l know poor Herzog and I
like both him and his philos-
ophy. Thus, I was truly upset
that Mr, indignant Faculty
Member cleverly destroyed his
juvenile and demagogic at-
tempt to excite the rabble,

As soon as I finished reading
the Peking Review, the Scar-
let and Black, and the People‘s
World, I searched for poor Her-
zog. For a last stand, the
speech had seemed mild, and
I thought that the letter writer
may have been right in ones
tioning the authorship oi the
nelm'lous document,

But Herzog, as Iremembered
him, no longer eXisted. in-
stead, a blathel‘ing idiot hysV
lerically yelled, “When the
fighting begins, we have to
Clean out Carnegie as well as
Burling basement,” I Criiiged
at the prospect ot a tight on
two ii-onts but obligingly began
to empty beer bottles for the
Molotov cocktails,

”Hcrzog, do you think this
rather militant action is really
justified?” I murmured while
dellantly breaking windows.

Herzog straightened to his
full 5-3 and screamed, holding
his bloody and chatted wrists,
“I do not: wish to appear disc
affected; however, that letter
cleverly crushed our minor,
limited War, and escalation is
the only answer."
l-le blathered on, “They’ve got
between 150 and 200. But we’ve
got 1,100, Their troops are
trained and are our belters in
guerrilla wariare. But the open
war will bring us World-wide
student sympathy in our battle
ior human rights."

I giggled but was roused by

the crazy gleam in Hel‘zog’s
eye. Vaguely, I could picture
iriendly Herzog back beiore it
all began.

Back then he liked people,
held no animosity toward his
fellow man, and didn’t even
drool while talking. Gradually,
the poor all changed, He has
claimed that societal condi
tions have caused his fascinat-
ing but somewhat paranoic
outbursts. His latest Dut-
bursts came after an adminis-
trator asked him if he was
pregnant.

Now l—lerzog has flipped out.
In a few months he could have
leit here — homogenized and
pasteurized and stamped with
the four~year seal oi approval.
But now he's sitting here, unr
fit for the outside world: cli'OOl'
lng fiendisil‘llyv

For a long time Herzog
stared vacantly at Origins of
Totalitarianism, a book now
banned at the college pi'Dpar
ganda outlet. Then tor the
twentieth time he reread Mr.
Member's letter in awe.

l-lerzog ranted. ”Why just
yesterday I saw Mr. i. F. Mem-
ber slitheriiig across campus.
Surely, he couldn’t have utter.
ed such antlrl'evolutionary
drivel. Mr. Member showed
every sign oi being in his right
mind, with his glazed expres-
sion there as usual.

”Surely,“ Herzog spewed on,
”Mr. Member’s juvenile tirade
won’t destroy the value oi my
dialectic."

Having finished a case of
beer as a contribution to the
cause (Molotov cocktails), I
couldn't help bursting out.
l-lerzog, possibly Mr, Member
didn’t write that letter. Maybe
a leftist student wrote it, try—
ing to incite us to further ac-
tion."

That’s when Herzog ran out
the door screaming, “I don‘t
care. This is what I wanted
anyway.”

in closing let me assure the
editor there is no cause to
doubt that Herzog wrote the
speech, but let me caution you
that he has modified his posi-
tion, and 1 would advise keep»
ing all children indoors,

Freshmen Question
Student Enthusiasm

To the Editor:

The other day a question-
naire was placed into the boxes
of various selected freshmen
to formulate suggestions “for
informing more high school
students of Grinnell College.”

Question ll oi this question-
naire asks the selected stu-
dents what nonracademic fea-
ture oi the school they were
most impressed with,

A fitting answer to this ques-
tion would be a history of the
politics on the Grinnell campus
this year. This would provide
an interesting story indeed for
any prospective freshman, and
a most accurate picture of life
as it exists on this campus.

The first Chapter in this his-
tory concerns the reactions of
the Student Government to the
a d m i n is tr a tion restric-
tions placed upon that body
and itsfunctions. The Student
Government Called on the stu~
dents in a special meeting at
the Senate to "demonstrate
Clearly to all that the phrases
in the college catalogue about
the fine and independent stun
dent government are only
empty sale phrases.” The stue
dent body was further called
upon to renounce their apathy
upon this issue by ratiiying a
basic change in the Student
Senate,

This week leaders of the Stu-
dent Government showed their
further enthusiasm and lack of
apathy concerning student ai-
t'airs by not being able to pro-
vide more than one candidate
tor election to SGA president.

The contrast between these
two attitudes is so great that
an intelligent observer would
be led to question the real iac.
tors that occurred in (he decir
sions of the Various qualified
persons to run or not to run
for this office.

If student opinion is any in-
dication, then a second candle
date would at least have pre»

cult to believe, as was stated
before, that the student leaders
who were so avid in promoting
the interests ofustudent govern.

To the Editor:

This is a reply to Felix Lun~
gu’s statement printed in the
March 5 5&3.

Dear Mr. Lungui

Since you have asked that
Americans talk to you about
America, I have decided to take
this opportunity to talk to you.
Your recent comments in the
5&3 are made with a great
deal of justification. No decent
American can justify the action
of Sheriffs Clark or Rainey, of

Wallace. No American can jus-
tify the brutality of Birming-
ham, or Jackson, or the subtle
discrimination of the North,

And indeed you as an African
can more easily see the dispar-
iLy between the noble senti-
ments expressed in the De-
claration of Independence, the
Bill of Rights, the Constitution
and the actual practices oi solne
Americans,

But I do think you overlook
the fact that there are indeed a
good many Americans, or all
races, who also
wrongs in our society. You
have made no allowance (or
the Reverend Deweys, the Jos-
eph Walls, the Senators Doug-
providing that same govern
ment with the competition nec-
essary ioi- the democratic se-
lection oi a leader chosen by
the student body, from whom
Ithese leaders derive their pow
l er.

This letter is by no means in
tended to cast any doubt on
the qualifications of the one
candidate who has placed himr
self up for liominalionr If any-
thing, he deserves praise for
being the one person with
“guts" enough to overcome
this tide oi apathy,

las and Javiis and Bayl-i. You
make no allowance for tho
Grinnell Civil Rights Group, for
SNCC, for the NAACP. for Mar-
tin Luther King’s SCLC. Thes-
too are Americans.

You rightfully deplore tho
iorces which killed John Ken-
nedy and Medgar Evers, but
you forget that Mrl Kennedy
was elected President of the
United States by Americans,
too; and when he was shot, it
was not only you who mourned,
but the vast maiorlty of Amen
icans.

Please remember that while
segregation is approved by
some Americans, those who
fight it are also Americans,
Remember that. the civil rights
drive was actually spurred by
the National Council of Church-
es, which is largely a while or-
ganizalion.

Likewise you should remem-
ber that the CiVil Rights bill of
1964 was passed in both Houses
oi Congress by an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan majority, and
the tremendous pressure exert-
ed on our legislators to pass
that bill was exerted not by Af-
ricans, but by Americans, Fi-
nally, remember that in the re-
cent Presxdential election, the
candidate who subtly appealed
to the white backlash was suc-
cessful only in the Deep South.

All I ask is that While you cori-
demn evil in our society, as in-
deed you should continue to do,
you also remember that there
are Americans who are on your
side,
