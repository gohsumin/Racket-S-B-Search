Features ‘Pop-Op'

"Pop~0p,” an exhibition or is
contemporary paintings asseme
bled by the Leo Castelli Gallery
in New York City, is on display
in Schealier Gallery now until
Oct. 25

The exhibition, which is begin-
ning a series or showings at the
Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west. includes paintings by such
artists as Miles Jensen, Bob Stan-
ley, Jerry Foyster, Mel Ramos,
Ton-i Wesselmann, Elliott Lloyd,
Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy War-
1101.

Pop and op art, the contending
styles among today’s avant-garde
painters, are rooted in the tra-
ditional concerns oi the painter,
according to Robert McMillan
(art).

Pop art, a strange but direct
development from earlier con-
cerns im‘ realism, casts a Curi-
ous, harrcn, uncritical, and objec-
tive eye upon fragments oi Con-
temporary commercial imagery.
Free of intent to please the eye,
it can claim to provoke the mind
to some awareness of the banal
in our time.

01) art, as a style, derives from
a long history of the artist’s cure
iosity toward the mechanics or
vision itself. it utilizes optical
tricks to eontuse the eye and to
surprise the viewer with strange
lifects of line and color, or shape
relationships

The Scheafler Gallery is open
from 7 am, to 11 p.m. Monday
through Saturday and noon to it
p.m. Sundays.

was relieved to discover that all the
challenges to one’s mind ottered

agree, such a movie is in line with
the Great Gl‘innell Society. One
could perceive tit-cu meanings,
such as the basic maii-against-man
conflict, or lust tor power, or the
desire to be recognized in a ”ﬂy
by night" society to which the
poor racketeet was subjected.

It was especially gratitying since
We did not have a magnificent
”Praise INTELLECTUALISM from
which all blessings ﬂow" sermon
by Mr. Eldridge Sunday morning to
stimulate our love and loyalty to
intellects,

l was nervously thinking that:
one Sunday night might have gone
by without our para. tic minds be-
ing able to latch onto something
so typically Grinnelllan. Leave ll:
to the movies committee to assuage
my tears.
