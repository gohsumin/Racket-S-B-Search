Student Power Pro poso]

In this issue appears the proposal of the student
power committee for the establishment of a committee
on curriculum and academic affairs. This proposal,
we are told, is the result of many long and difficult
hours of labor by both students and faculty. The pro—
posal is notable for its relative moderation as compared
to the freenswinging, puerile student manifesto of last
semester. The reason for this may be that the com—
mittee was, in part, composed of‘ faculty members.
Or it may be the case that time tends to make conserva-
tives of us all. Unfortunately, regardless of how moder-
ately we apply a bad principle, we get bad results.
And the principle of student power in academic and
curriculum affairs is very had, indeed.

The committee has carefully made its proposal ac-
cording to a democratic principle. They apparently
believe that because a representative democracy is

» desirable in national government, it is equally desirable
in education. It is not intuitively obvious to us, at least,
that the two situations are identical. The reasoning
behind the committee’s noble intentions leaves a great
deal to be desired. .

The proposal, if accepted, would give students an
equal voice in determining, for example, graduation
and departmental requirements. We would have then
the utterly absurd situation of students who have not
completed their education voting on what would be
needed to complete that education. Let us note that
the proposal does not even exclude freshmen from
voting on the committees.

The faculty will debate and vote on the proposal
sometime after spring vacation. If they vote to accept
it, we believe that they will have taken just one more
step toward the demise of excellent education at Grin»
nell College.

Letters . . .

To Tlle Editors:

In the interest of somewhat
greater accuracy, 1 would like
to make the lollowing two corree
tions of statements which ap-
peared in the article concerning
Cuttington College two issues
ago.

(1) The Colonization Societies
did purchase land from tribal
peoples early in the nineteenth
century, but it was tor the pur-
pose of establishing their settle»
ments. Cuttington College is 120
miles in the interior, and its land
was purchased rrum tribal
peoples in the midrlsso's, as part
at the extensive alienation of land
lrom tribal peoples which began
at that time with the extension
of roadsinto the interior.

(2) The students of tribal back-
ground at Cuttington College
were often educated at missions,
but that does not mean that they

were educated by missionaries,-

Peace Corps Volunteers, Liber-
ian citizens, nationals from other
African nations, EX-PCV'S, and
sometimes ACM graduates, My
point was to indicate that college
students are not recruited from
the government schools for the

most part.
Sincerely yours,
Ronald J. Kurtz
Associated Professor of
Anthropology
To The Editors:

Since l take pains to express
myselt clearly, l seldom reply to
criticisms of my arguments
unless new evidence appears or
new countenarguments are
brought iorward. But my censure
of Mr. Nasser’s review has
roused considerable ire, some of
it from men whom I know and
respect and whose good opinion
I would not willingly iorego.
Hence this reviLy,

'I observe Iirst that not one of
those persons who has called me
such opprobrious names un-
dertakes to say one good word
in behalf of Mr. Nasser's review.
Apparently all believe that it is
enough merely to discredit me.
Such a view contradicts their own
principle 7 that a man‘s views
are irrelevant to his competence.

Second, their method for
discrediling me is exactly that
of which they accuse me:
“personal attack” and
“character assassination." If I
were guilty ct what they assert,
it would be eimer in intent or
in fact or both. Well, since only
i can know my intentions, let me

say, categorically and un-
equivocally, that my censure or
Mr. Nasser’s review was in no
way whatsoever intended to be
a reﬂection on his person or his
character. My argument, in fact,
is this: those who submit to a
body of dogma are to that degree
precluded from having
character, for character is torm-
ed by the sustained and
renewed habit of decision; and
he who submits to dogma abanr
dons his powers at decision.

It would seem that there
are three reasons for the ire
aroused: (l) I used the word
“communist” as being,
possibly a more accurate
description of Mr. Nasser’dt
position than “socialist”; (2) my
statement that Mr. Nasser’s
peculiar mixture of “-isms”
disqualified him for teaching at
a liberal arts college seemed to
be intending civic or legal action
to oust him; (a) the general tone
at my letter was offensive.

To the iirst charge 1 reply that
the Plot of either term 7
“communist" or “socialist" 7
was of minor impormnce to my
argument, which rested on the
meaning of the suffixes “risrn”
and “rist,” If I have caused Mr.
Nasser or other faculty members
undue pain by making a distinc-
tion between “communist”and
“socialist,” I regret it, although
I would argue that the distinction
is a legitimate one. Still, if it will
please Mr. Klein and others for
whom he speaks, I will withdraw
the word ”communist" provided
that Mr. Nasser’s own term
“socialist" be understood to
include advocacy of violence and
revolution, in the manner of the
present governments of Russia
and China: such is what his
review indicates. Until he denies
this interpretation, it seems
legitimate tu make it.
