Pioneers Start Roundball Season
With Jaunts to Knox, Monmouth

The Pioneer basketball team
will be showing some new faces
this weekend when the hoopstets
travel to Knox and Monmouth for
the season openers, Sophomore
center Roger Able has virtually
clinched a starting position along
with returnees Elliott Hibbs and
.iett Frantz. Battling tor the other-
two starting positions are sopho-
mores Greg Rankin, Mike Sch-
wartz and Dick Musser, and lel-
termen Ted Risser and Tom Hill.
Also slated tor action are Dick
Lovell and Bob Watt.

Knox and Monmouth are noi
ranked as two of the strong
teams in the conference but both
have many veteran pcttotmets
back this year.

This year coach Plitsch has de-
clded to change his offense irom
the iastbreak pressing attack at
last year to a more controlled
type. Last year the Pioneers were
able to score but the deleiise and
rebounding was so weak that the

 

Pioneers could win only tive ot
eighteen conietence games.

The new otiense, called the Au-
burn Shuttle, is designed to let
the team set up for the good shot.
Pfitsch also hopes this Will allow
the Pioneers to grab more re
bounds, both oltensiveiy and de
fensively, because they will be
able to get better position uncler
the boards,

With the Friday night and Sat—
urday atlemoon games through-
out: the season last year, Pittsch
thought the Pioneers tired out. It
showed at the end of time season,
when the Pioneers were able to
win unity one game out 01 the
tinal eight.

Ptitscli is happy With the prog-
tess oi the team so far, consider»
ing that tour players started late
because 01 iootball.

The varsity beat the ireshmen
last Saturday 7250 to start the
season. Especially impressive tor
the trash were Tom Lower, Sam
Semi, and Thor Evenson.

pleted their iitth week ot practice

host Dubuque University and
Wartburg College tomorrow at

may be indicative of Grinnell’s
strength. Next week the pioneers

a few of which deserve mention.
A new weight class has been

added so that the range in the

are worth two points (prior to the
change, only the first TD by each
wrestler was Warth two with suc-
ceeding TD’s counting one point).
Also, up to two points may be
gamed tor riding time where
previously only one could be
scored. These changes, as well as
some others, may have an im~
portant bearing on match results.
