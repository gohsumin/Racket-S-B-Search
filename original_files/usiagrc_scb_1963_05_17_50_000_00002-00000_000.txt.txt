Censorship

“The, Faculty Council on Student At-
T. Monday released ii. report in which
i 0 rules of the College were rc- iiiiined
and in which the studellts' iole in iliitiiitilln

The news story told ol‘ a liew mechan-

signllcant changes in the rules )‘OCOlnr
utended by the Council.

Although the report has been ci eilliited
to the eiilty and to so-called “student
leaders.” i has not been released fol the

ag’l'eed with the report at almost evel‘

point and disagreed with each other upon,

occasion.

But what the students Said iii the two

on the final report. The committee paid

little heed to student complaints but only-

formiilized the system by which students
could make more complaints.

The report is not a “liberalization” of
the social rules. The lnodi cations that the
report called for were in academic and

nonvsocial areas.

Forum For Descent

A certain Gilnnell chemisll'v piofessor holds
in a “cyclical theory" or student government
the notion that it always takes about three yeais
for Students to inarshall a one year challenge
to the established order. According to this View,
old issues never die — they just gct buried for
a whi e.

In the words at General MacArthur, “I will
return." But the fact remains that Jack Chair
man will never return. Neither will Edward
Robbins, Al Boston, Cameron Hendershot, 01‘
Bill Halamzi. And so our chemistry professor
may be right.

Either necessarily or not, Grinnell strident
govcinnlelit is essentially an “elitest game”
"Selected Students” recently met with an ad-
)llll‘ilstl‘atianrlacultv committee variously titled
‘Cotlncil on Student Lite" and “Faculty Council

out. Our selected studcllls vcrc kept btisv ini-
quite a while, even though most icit that "nor

Now, a less cunning and subtle fashion or
playing big games was witnessed during the
Senate's notorious deliberations on the budget,

What‘s more tun, obviously is sitting in rar-
iotis advisory capacities or in an everrprolitei‘at-
int: committee system. All the committees, re»
ports. pctty pohtlcklng and political gossiping
provide an ingenious funhotise where real siiidcnt
aiicciivcness gets lost haliway up a trick stair»
case. When anybody seriously tries to _e[[cct
tchangcs in student lite or in the evolution oi
the college, somebody pulls the lever.

The chici expectation of recent student poli-
tics has been the prospect at change, with a ceiu
