Lew Reminds rug @rder; Leggett Denies Pterodactyl Narc Report
Enamels: “‘l ides Wrong”

Following a discussion wlth
President Glenn Leggett last
Friday, Dean Alice Low re-
scinded a controversial re-
definition of the resident ad<
viser role in the college drug
policy that she had issued the
previous Wednesday.

The rescinded policy, which
(lie dean had formulated with.
0th consultation with students,
taculty, or Leggelt, said: “If
we (resident advisers) are reas-
onably certain from our own
observations that a student is
under the inﬂuence or any ille-

Siudenls Organize
For Greater Voioe
In Decision-Making

Coinciding with recent iaculty
consideration of sludént attend-
ance at faculty meetings. a
broadsbased student movement
has been forming on campus
during the past two weeks with
the intent ot gaining more stu-
fem power in all areas of col-
ege decision-making,

The movement originated with
h group of student senators and
other interested students who
were dissatisﬁed with the pre<
sent role of students in college
decision-making. The group has
increased its ranks considerably
during the past weeks

Some one hundred students,
including at least one student
from each ﬂoor of every resi-
dence hall on campus, attended
a meeting last week to decide
how to proceed. Committees
were termed to write up pIeSEIl:
tallons to be delivered at an
open senate meeting next Wed-
nesday in Roberts Theater, and
those present decided to discuss
the decision-making role at stu-
dents with their hallmates and
encourage them to attend the
special senate meeting,

President Glenn Leggett’s
remarks to the faculty corp
cerning student participation
lll decisionrmaking will be

published In next week's
5&3.

gal drug we have no other op-
tion than to report this to the
hearing board.”

Shortly alter Dean Law's re-
definition was announced last
Wednesday, some 250 angry
students gathered in [rent oi
Burllug Library to protest the
statement. The students then
went to the South Lounge where
they coniwnted Deans Low
and Connie Klmbu with ques-
tions and criticized the policy,
which they believed would
have undermined the counsel<
ing lllnction or resident ad-
visers.

“l rescinded the re-(lelinitiun
ml the basis that I felt that the
approach was wrong, although
the intent was not,” Dean Low
explained this week.

“It was being misinterpret-
ed." she continued. “and I
thought it was destroying the
role we had built up for the
resident advisers. It was sim-
pler to say i was wrong and
rescind it."

Asked why the redeﬁnition
was rescinded, Leggett this
week said that “it represented
a change in my understanding
of the function of the residen
advisers. '

“I think Mrs. Low felt that
her instructions to the RA's
were simply an implementation
of my drug policy,” the presi—
dent continued. “While I under-
stand Mrs. Law‘s position, I
can see how interpretation
could have concluded that it
was a new policy"

“At any rate,‘ I think we
need more discussion, and we
ought to leave things as they
are for a while," Leggett said.

P re s i d e nt Glenn Leggett
Tuesday reiuted reports by
Gi'innell's underground news»
paper Pterodactyl that he has
knowledge about a curlelit in-

agents are currently conducting

on the Grinnell campus.”

“1 give a tlat denial to
that,” Leggett told the see.
“As far as i know, no mem-
her of the local canstahulary
or state or federal law en-
forcement agencies is on
campus, or conducting an in-
vestigation.

“That doesn’t necessarily
mean they aren‘t here," Legs
gett added, “butjt agents are
here, they’re here unbe-

t knownst to me

“I'd be surprised it they're
here,” he continued, “but not
totally surprised in view at all
the recent publicity we’ve had."

Asked whether he would
notify students it iniormed that
narcotics agents were on cam«
pus, Leggett replied: “It would
depend upon how I was told.
Il agents appeared at my cities
and said they were conducting
a lullrscale investigation, I'd
seek advice from the college’s
legal counsel petore taking any
action,”
