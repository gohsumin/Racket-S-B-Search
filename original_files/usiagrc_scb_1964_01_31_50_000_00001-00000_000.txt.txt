A precision acrobatic pilot is
one of Grinnell’s featured inter»
lm lecturers.

Nor-wood Russell Hanson is
lecturing not on aerial acrobat-
ics but on Newtonian physics. A
noted authority on the history
and philosophy of science, Han-
son flies for recreation and
transportation.

“As a boy I lived near an air-
port which is probably where I
first became crazy about air-

lanes. I made model planes
out of balsa, too. In 1934 I saw
a demonstration by Al Williams,
one of the best acrobatic pilots
the United States Navy ever
produced; and ever since then
'wanted to fly myself," said
Hanson,

During World War II Hanson
became a Marine Corps flyer
garner based) and was first

eserve Pilot on the first team
of the Blue Angels.

Hanson now owns his own
plane, a F8F<Z Grumman
Bearcat. This was a 1949 na-
val fighter which until 1955
held the world’s record for
climbing — almost 11,000 feet
a minute. In the February is-
sue of FLYING, Hanson has
an article entitled “The Last
of the Red Hot Cats" which
describes the plane and some
of his adventures with it.

During the war Hanson was
also a boxer. In 1942 he won the
Marine Corps Officer’s light
heavyweight championship. He
also was in the Golden Gloves
competition, advancing to the
semifinals in the heavyweight
division. Altogether he had 22
amateur matches, losing only
once in this time. His last fight
was in I952 when he boxed
Gwyn Williams. light heavy-
weight champion of Wales.

Hanson is also a motorcycle
enthusiast.

He said, “1 have a Harley-
Davidson cycle now which I
have souped up. I have done
up to 123 miles an hour on
it; it will do 143, I think. This
cycle is my twelfth. I started
in 1939 and used to race on
sandlots. We wore one iron
shoe which we would put down

“People think that their de-
scription of an event is an ac-
count purely of what is there,"
rem'arked visiting lecturer Ken-
neth Burke. "Actually a tre<
mendons amount of the de-
scription is merely carrying out
the implication of terms.”

Burke, a noted literary crit-
ic, contends that the nature of
terminology determines the na-
ture of observation; that "cer-
tain terms will lead you one
way, other terms will lead an-
other way."

.The deterministic feature of
language was a theme of his
Prologue in Heaven which had
its premiere Sunday evening at
Grinnell.

“This was not written to be
performed,’ confessed Burke.
“It was more an imitation of
a Platonic dialogue, made to
be read with the eye. The dia-
logue is enough on the edges
of drama to be performed,
but in a dialogue the purpose
is to get the sentences said»
to explain a theory. In a dra-
ma the sentences further the
action.”

Burke continued, “It was
acted charmingly. The whole
company did a fine job. Watch-
ing it was rather amusing for
me since I’m used to lecturing,

in which you’re responsible for
everything. That time 1. could
sit back and let others take on
the main responsibility.”

Besides creating his own dra-
ma — dialogue, stories, and
poems, Burke has translated
works of other authors, notably
Thomas Mann All Mann‘s let-
ters to the literary magazine
Dial were translated by Burke
and the first English transla-
tion of Mann’s “Death in Ven-
ice" was Burke's handiwork.

He reCalled, “I had done a
translation of “Deabh in Venice”
for myself, just because i
loved it, and had put it away.
At that time I was affiliated
with Dial magazine, and the
editor cabled from Europe that
they had secured rights to
translate Mann’s "Death in
Venice" into English. As soon
as I saw that, I told the staff
that I could bring in a trans»
lation the next day!”

Burke had always had a

Debate Question

In Women'slniegraiion Movement

Marie Martin, aws Board
president, urges all women to
consider the desirability of
integrated dormitories on the
basis of what is the best resi-
dential situation for freshman
and for upperclass women re-
spectively within the physical
limitations of the living quar-
ters.

In preparation for future ref~
erendum on the issue, women of
the Quad discussed the issue
Monday afternoon in M ain
Lounge. A panel of upperclass
women started the discussion
with brief statements of opin-
ion.

After these opening comments

A J sip a n o s e sociologist.
Hidetoslli Kata, will be the
third Asian-nation scholar to
serve as a visiting professor
on campus this year when he
joins the college’s faculty for
the second semester.

A graduate of Hitosubashi
University in Tokyo, 1952, Kato
will be teaching courses in soc-
iology and history.

Professor Kato has been a r
search associate at Kyoto Uni-
versity, n visiting scholar at
Stanford University, and a VIS-
itingprofessor at Doshisha Un-
iversity.

The author of numerous
books and articles in English
and Japanese, Kato has also
studied at Harvard University
and the University of Chi-
cage,

Professor Kato and his wife,
Takoe, will live with their two
children, Mari, 5, and Fumit—
oshi, 2, in the home of Dr. Dirk
Baby. The Baays will be spend-
ing the Coming year in Africa,
where Dr. Baay (German) will
be a Fulbright-Hayes visiting
professor at Cuttington College,

This week’s Scarlet and

Lynn Denzler with the help
of her permanent staff. It is
the second of two trial issues

new business manager, Jim
McIntyre.

of Frosh Dorms

the discussion was opened to
the whole group.

It w a s mentioned that
freshmen are impressionable,
and that “hall spirit" seems
to s p r e a d contagionsly
throughout a freshman dorm.
While their enthusiasm often
leads to constructive projects,
freshmen sometimes may in-
fluence each other not; to
study. The “stabilizing influ-
ence” of upperclass women
might be beneficial for fresh-
men, -

Some upperclass girls felt
freshman exuberance might
benefit the unintegrated halls,
Others, however, were afraid
freshmen might tend to be ex-
cessively noisy.

In Cleveland and James, the
halls currently integrated, there
is a maximum of six freshmen
on a floor, and these girls some-
times seem to be cut off from
other members of their class.
With total integration of wom-
en's halls the needs for an im-
mediate friendship group and
for individual privacy might
both be met.

The physical problem was im-
portant to upperclass girls too.
They felt it unfair that fresh-
men might be placed in desir-
able rooms such as the connect-
ing singles in Read, while two
seniors might have to share one
of the tiny doubles in Main.

Marie suggested that the
women first consider whether
integrated dorms would better
serve their academic, social
and emotional needs, and if
t h e y decide affirmatively,
then discuss the physical lim-
itations on the integrated SyS‘
tem.

Hoping to stimulate further
discussion on integrated dorms,
Marie distributed a brief state-
ment of the major problems to
be considered.

Eldridge Speaks Sunday

Regular Sunday services will
be held in Herrick Chapel this
week at 11:30 am. College
chaplain Roger Eldridge will
give the'sermon, entitled ”Will
Success Spoil Joe College?”

The subject matter, accord-
ing to Mr, Eldridge, will pre-
sent “a new realism as over
against the romanticism (pos-
ing as ‘realist' and ‘honest')
now so prevalent on camp~

There will be no services in

General Dwight D. Eisenhow-
er wrll be the political lecturer
for the Program in Practical
Political Education next year.
C. Edwin Gilmour, program die
rector, announced this week.

Although definite plans have
not been made, Gilmour has
received word that the former
president will come to Grin-
nell someiime in May 1965.
He will spend two days on
campus as Politician-in-Resi-
dence, and will deliver the an-
nual Political Lectureship, He
will be accompanied on his
trip by his wife, Mamie.

As with former PPPE lec~
turers, Eisenhower will be in
direct contact with students on
both an informal and formal
basisi Plans will include lunch-
eon and dinner meetings with'
students, classroom visits, and.
probably a press conference.
Special plans will also be made
for Mrs. Eisenhower to meat
With students.

The PPPE program. usually
held in the fall, Will be post<
poned until spring next year so
that the Eisenhowers can at-
tend. Gilmour told the 5&3
Wednesday that original plans
had called for the former presi-
dent to be on campus in Octo<
ber, but during an exchange of
letters Eisenhower said he
could not give a definite date
until this summer.

Due to the extensive plan-
ning needed for the program
and the importance of its
guest lecturer, it was decided
that the date wo uld be
changed to sometime in the
spring; Eisenhower then an-
swered that he and his wife
would be leaving California
sometime in mid-May and
that they would stop at Grin-
nell on their way to their
summer home in Gettysburg.

Included in the plans for the
Eisenhower visit is the endow-

ment of an annual Eisenhower
Political Award, employed with
the approval of the former
president. The award would be
presented at Commencement to
the graduating senior who has
best exemplified the ideals and
objectives of the PPPE during
his stay at crinnell. ,
