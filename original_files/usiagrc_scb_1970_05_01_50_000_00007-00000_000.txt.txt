“And that the faculty im»
mediately undertake
modification of the advising
system to make it appropriate for
its new importance.

"Proposal B: That the credit-
iail option be extended to all
students with the provision that
two courses may be taken each
semester on this basis, but with
credltrfall not allowed in the
major ﬁeld except in such special
cases as have been previously
approved."

According to Mr, Clotl'elter
there is a very good reason for
doing something about the
present requirements. “It is most
difficult for a student to eXr
periment with courses in enough
areas early in his career so that
he can try out subjects in which
he might want to major,” said
Clotfelter. Mr, Clotfelter also
listed three reasons why he
thought his proposal would be a
good step for the College to take.

First, the rationale - for
requiring certain courses was to
be sure that all students had an
introduction to many different

current

areas of learning. Clotielter
pointed out that most Students
now come from high school with a
good introduction to most of the
arcas in which Courses are
presently required,

The proposed change would
likely improve the attitude of
students toward their courses,
because they would be taking
courses they felt they ought to
take rather tllan courses they
had to take. it would be the task
of the advisor to persuade his
advisees to take this or that
course

Finally, the advising system
would be improved. Advisor and
student would have to carefully
work out the program of study for
each individual student; hence,
there would be more Contact be
tween advisor and advisee.

The proposal was reierred by
the Executive Council to the Ed-
ucational Policy Committees of
the three Divisions. Their recom-
mendations were to be discussed
and acted upon by the Divisions.

According to Mr. Worley,
Philosophy. the Social Studies
Division agrees overwhelmingly
that the Clotielter proposal would
not damage any- or the depart
ments in the Division if it were
enacted. Mr, Worley believes
that most oi the departments in
the division favor a reduction in
the requirements, although the
question was not put at the

meeting There is a consensus
that if such a proposal is enacted,
laculty members will have to do a
much better job oi advising
students than they are doing at
the present time. Worley felt that
the proposal is not likely to go
through this year, partly because
the staff has already been hired
ior next year based upon an
expected demand ior courses,
and partly because many
questions still remain. in
Worley’s opinion, “the key
question is: What are the re
quirements for a good
education?”

The science Division has
decided not to consider the Clot»
felter proposal this year, ac-
cording to Mr. Delong, Biology.
DeLong also said that it would be
Very difficult to estimate the
effect that the abolishment of re-
quircments would have on the
Biology Department. He did say
that many students who would
not have taken the course if it had
not been required have neverthe-
less said they felt it was a worth-
while course. Mr. Clotfelter said
that he believed there would be
little ctlec't on the total enrollr
ment in the science division. He
said that certain changes could
be made in the present Science ff
course (for instance, two sections
could be offered, one with lab and
one without) to make the courses
more attractive to students and
to conserve faculty time. Stur
dents could be persuaded to take
a broad program or studies both
by their advisors and by a series
or lectures given early each year
to entering students, outlining the

reasons for trying to get a broad
education. Said Clotfelter, ”I
believe that most Grinnell
students are mature enough that
thcy would want to take difficult
courses, even in subjects outside
the area of their immediate ins
tercst.”

Mr. Foster, English, believes
that the Humanities Division is
overwhelmingly opposcd to the
proposal as it now stands. He ielt
that the language departments
and perhaps some oi the fine arts
dopartments would be decreased
in size. The EPC did recommend
a compromise proposal by Miss
Noble, Spanish, which would re-
quire a certain distribution of
courses. According to Foster, the
Division is now considering two
questions: 1. whether or not to
recommend the Noble proposal to
the Executive Council and 2.
whether to defer the decision on
this matter until next year, when
the Divisions can more caretully
consider all the alternatives.

The proposal offered by Miss
Noble would set the following re-
quireinents:

”1. Completion of 124 credits
with an overall cumulative
grade point average of 2.0.

“2. Completion of at least 32 but
not more than 48 credits in a
major field.

“3. Completion of a distribution
requirement oi at least 28 credits
in courses in departments or
Special Programs in the Group in
which the student‘s major does
not fall. No more than 12 hours in
any one department may count
toward the fulfillment of this re
quirement.

In addition, a physical

absolutely necessary to enter a
student‘s room, Unless
restrictions are placed on this
procedure in the Constitution,
students will have no protection
at all from illegal entrances. In
answer to the third point, they
said that the main thrust of the
proposal was to provide “cone
sistellcy and coordination"
between hall judicial councils.
Previously, these councils had
never been officially defined
campusewide.

The iitth point is a common
objection to student government
proposals; but Bill Thomas
pointed out that because the
trustees have declared that the
president has the final say in all
college affairs, students have no
say in the matter. Finally, Bill
and Greg stated that the ap-
parent inconsistency in section A-
SH does not exist upon close
examination. As for sloppiness
and redundancy in the proposal,
each student will have to decide
for himself how valid and how
important that criticism is.
