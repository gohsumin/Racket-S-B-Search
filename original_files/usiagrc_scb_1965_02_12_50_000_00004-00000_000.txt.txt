,member of the “Pepsi generation.”

Archamhault posed the question
of which of the two cultures should
move toward the other. His an-
swer was that the “Pepsi" culture
should move more in the direction
of the Scholar’s style

He noted that faculty-student
bull sessions on "the existential
me" would not do the job.

Erickson shifted the focus to the
conflict between professional pre-
paration and a liberal education.
He said, “The proper iunotion of
a liberal arts college is to de-
velnp professional competence in
the best sense of the wor ,"

Ire significant only in that they af-
lest the student's major field of
study Erickson said he thought
students should know their major
interest at least by the end of
their first year and should work in-
tensively in their major at first.
broadening out only after they
have achieved competence in their
field.

Erickson objected to the idea of
shopping around for two years be»

field.

Haveman was ooncemed with
the problem of scholarship and
teaching. He deﬁned a scholar as
"a person who is actively engaged
in ultimate objects.”

He Said that a teacher‘s duty is
to guide others in scholarship and
added that a faculty member at
Grinneil should be both teacher and
ocholar.

Havemon charged, "There is in—
:uliicient scholarly activity at this
college. You can’t guide if there
isn’t scholarship,

Haveman characterized the Grin-
nell faculty as “a group of tired
young men.” He said they Work
under an umbrella of committee
work when they should be con-
cemed with their academic area.

Concluding the panel presenta-
tion with remarks on the student
body, Haveman said it “lacks
creativity.” He said the interna-
tional outlook has given way to an
obsession with internal problems.
He cited the absence of activity in
civil rights and peace
