A request

A recent memorandum to Grinnell students and facul-
ty from tlle art acquisitions committee closes witll this
1 ragraph:

“With additional purchases and e tended loans of
works of art, the placement of new acquisitions in campus
Buildings \ Il become routille. Because, like ollr temporarv
loan exhibitions, they will be openly displayed, we ask eV-
el‘y member of the campus community to share a feeling
of deep responsibility for their Safety. They are objects
of both material and aesthetic value, and in some cases,
(if g at historic value. All original work of art cannot be
ieplaced."

We can do little more than underline those words and

press deep Concelll and shock at the incident which

prompted the nlelno, alld at a sinll incident which oc-
curred Tuesday.

,Prior to Cllri tmas Vacation. an o .lal John Shirle-
ton Copley Valued at $15,000 was taken from Burling lb»
lal'v where it was being: displayed and hung- in a pl'ecal'io:
position on a campus building.

Tuesday. fine arts staff members rel tell tha‘. ill
an apparent perverted attempt at humor. 21 paper rain-
bow had been taped to the unprotected face of "The
Temptation of St. Anthony," a painting by Max Ernst
which is now on loan to (‘ illnell from tlle New York
Museum of Modern Al'tl

We can find absolutely no justification for such acts.
Anyone who would consider the: “hulllorous” could har ,ly
be said to represent the type of student (‘rrinnell c l claim,
in the overwhelmin; majority, as a member of its com-
rlunity. /

Again we refer to the fine alts acquisitions. commit;
tee's memo in asking; “every member of tile can JllS coin-
rlunity to share a deep feeling of responsibility for the
safety of art works which are and which will be on display
zit Grinnell.

in support of A! Boston

We support Al Boston as a candidate for the Student
Government Association presidency.

It would be untrue to say that he had planned to enter
campaign week with our vote committed. We were waiting
to see ”What the other candidates" would have to say.

But, despite tlle fact that Al is the y alternative
wedon’t feel compelled to support lllmrﬂlltl‘HS, don't feel
lldlculous ill doing so because he's “our only choice.”

In this case, we feel that the quality of the candidate
adequately substitutes for the usual quantity of applicants.

And, if it’ ally consolation to Al, we might point ollt
that his quali cations for office might have been part of
the reason why no one contested him. No one likes to lose.

Al is all extremely capable fellow —— an excellent
speaker and a man with. we think, a practical philosophy
of student government. He has good idea and the qualities
of leadership necessary to see them curlled to the students
of Glinnell. Again, we support Al Boston,

Our post office

We r ally oil 'lt to consider ourselves fortunate. We
do have a post of ce on campus. Of course it’s ill a base,
ment and has only two public entrances, both at the bottom
of narrow open stairways.

And if several persons have fallen on those often ice-
covered steps this winter .lt lei t no one ll} ' been iiliul'ed.

Anyway the ice and snow will soon melt and in two or
three weeks it‘ll even be possible to get our mail without
dashing down through small waterfalls Y s, we certainly
are fortunate to have our own post office.

Now, if we can put a\ ay the acid and write with ink
once more, what we suggest is this: that the college lnake
the best of the post office’s bad location by enclosing the
stairways. This would keep ice from forming (and, if the
enclosures were locked at night, it nlig it even stop those
annual jokesters who fill up the Sir: wells with snow).
in warm weather, the outer door could be removed to
permit e . er access to the stail'niys.

ﬁssion: denial emphasize inquiry
by gene to candidature committee

by Al Boston

It is rather evident that there
is some lack of respect and un.
dersiandlng toward student govA
ernmcnt among the Grinnell
College student body. Certainly
the increased pace and workload
of the Student Senate and Exe»
cutive Cabinet has made those
two groups seem somewhat aloof
and unapproachable

i feel that an insuiiicienl
amount of communicatlon be
tween the student body and its
government is causing this lack
of understanding as to what
student government is attemptr
mg to accomplish,

As president of the Student
Government Association i would
try to inform the entire student
body of the activities and pur-
poses of student government
through periodical reports in the
Scarlet and Blue . Further, a
mid-yea col'l'ec hour with the
SGA president and perhaps others
of the Executive Cabinet would
offer he students another op-
paitunlly to approach the pres
ident with ihcn- ideas and crib
lClSl’tlS,

To determine the role of
student government in national
affairs. i suppose that the Son.
ate's national nlinirs connniuec
evaluate its position wilhin

organizations concerned with
nntloml cnccucns. Cert inly
stllde‘t cove ment h - h i-cr

its responsi y is basically
to siiuulcmcnl and encourage
independent interest.

always has the dnlv to bring

Apropos of Eucli personalities
as Achilles, Moses, Dante and
Abraham Lincoln. i have bccn
wondering who would be the cor.
lcspondlng hero of the twentieth
century.

In fact i have spent the last
inc wccks compiling a list of
heroes from interview with
Various students, 1 have heard
th called an age of despair,
because this era lacks any abso-
lute spiritual standards by which
we can Judge our own lives and
those of othelu.

But i think lhai the very
fccundny of reigning heroes
from our own centu v contradicts
fills sentiment Th. is 3 Sam-
ple from the list i Compiled.

Lloyd wi'ghi, Winsion Chur l-
hill, Franklin Delano noosc.

Parker, Wult Disney, Scymnnr

Bing Crosby and Huey Long.
Locking back over the list
now, 1 think that the person who
mentioned my name was prob-
ably Just ioking and doesn't
really think that 1 quality. Alsc
John Donne doesn't belong on
the list. because he died a long
time ago.

At ﬂIIV rate. we have our
heroes just like any other per-

led in history; one might even
say that we have too many. ll
could be argued that we have
heroes but what we need is a
Hcrc. And I lhink that here too
would be an opportunity for our
great advances in science and
inchgalhering to tacilltate a
choice which would be more repr
resentatibe of the ideal of this
age tllan even Dante or Shakes-
spcnrc were of their times,

The Hero of the Twentieth Cell-
ini-y could be found rm sure by
a kind of Trendex rating Or
perhaps It could be earned oul
in the manner of a political elec-
tlon. The candidates could be
chosen by a referendum and
these Candidates could be placed
in various parties: the literary
pally, the pol-rural party, the
entertainment party. etc.

Ideas for campaign posters and
buiions immediately come ti:
mind. The Hemingway buttons,
for example. could read, "What
we need is more gu in our
myths;” Grace Kelly's slogan
could be taken from the title 01
Horantlo Alger’s book, “Strive
and Sueceed;” Eisenhower
“Prosperity and good will anc
good will;” Walt Disney # “ch—
ereignty rests in the people."

sir Edmund Hillary 7 “This
is the greatest moment of my
life. Tens'ng;” Frank Lloyd
VVrlght — Ban the Bomb" Ray
Charles _ “rin not ang, I'm
just sad:" Henry Ford — “E
Pluribus Unum,”

Seymour Glass 7 “Knowledge
begins with nnlr-arning the un-
ference between things." (On
second thought. that's too long
for a slogan. It would have to

be abbreviated ol' shortened in
order to fit onto a campaign
button.) Calnus‘ slogan could also
be. l-rln not angry: rrn just sud'

Overall, what I would bc
seeking as SGA president is to
determine an efficient. and nat-
ural relationship between the
students and their government.

To the Editor:

We wculd like to make comv
men: on the recent display of
discourtesy and disrepeet shown
by certain inlelduals toward
works of art which Grinnell has
been pl'iV eged to exhibit dur-
ill{; the past few months.

This attitude toward exhibi-
tioils that we are eviremely for-
tunate to have on our campus
does not speak well for the
maturity of Certain pa sons. Re-
gardless of personal ltc or dis-
like, each individual owes a de.
gree of respect to any art work
up for public display.

To the Editor:

The Southern Negro is in the
difficult position of neither hav-
ing equal rights nor the oppor-
tunlty for securing equal rights.
Under the iron hand of white
supremacy, he is forced to
maintain his position. He is re;
slrlcled in many areas, including
the right to vote, attendance at
an integrated school with equal
educational opportunities, and
the freedom of residence,

in trying to gain equal rights
lie may be beaten. imprisoned.
economically boycotted, or per-
seeuted in some other manner.
Yet, most Northern students
stand by, permitting the Negro
to suffer punishment as a mat-
ter of course,

Through our complacent ate
tittlde, we are rendering those
rights guaranteed us by the
Constitution less meaningful to
ourselves and to those who
have a critical eye towards our
democracy. If we tolerate dis.

lminatlon against one minor—
ity group. we will endanger the
rights of all minorities. We lnust
guarantee equal freedoms for
ourselves and for generations to
Come.

There are groups. however,
which stand at the forefront
in helping us to acquire and
maintain democratic ideals.
Among these groups are the
freedom riders. The results
of their struggle, as well as
sit-ins, kneel-ins, Wilde-ins,
etc.. are well worth noilng.
The significance of their at
tempts portrays the highest
ideals of American democracy
— the struggle for the equal-
ity of man, These people are
sacrificing themselves for their
ideals. Yet, the freedom riﬂ-
Ea. for example. face ﬁnes.
imprlsmuncni, and permanent
criminal records which may
mar their futures.

The "Committee of 100," in
support of the NAACP (The Na
tional Association for the Ad.
Vancement of Colored People)
Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, Inc, is defending the 303
freedom riders currently on trial
in Jackson. Mississippi. Legal
expenses for this venture alone
will amount to $75,000. We dc
not have to sacrifice ourselves
to help the freedom riders and
their struggle, but we do have
an obligation to help defend
these people. Contributions to
their cause will be much apprer
cialed. Checks may be made out
to the ”Committee of 100" and
sent to Room 1790, 10 Columbus
Circle, New Yer 19, New York
or. if you desire ,they may be
placed in Box 413,

Here is an opportunity for
students — both conservatives
and liberals 7 who delight in
reciting slogans of human digr
my and justice to gun talking
and do something. ,
