appearance of the deans' state-

quately explains our position,"
According to the Dean, North
Campus Social Chairman David
Shellenbarger met with him
shortly before Christmas vaca-
tion and presented him with
‘vaguo and indefinite" plans
tor the scheduling or open
rooms during North Campus
Weekend. The request tor Visi-

Thompson noted further,
when questioned about whether
decisions as to the nature of
open rooms were presently be-
ing made and whether the cur-
rent weekend veto of Visitation
was symptomatic of adminis»
tration attitude, as follows:

MacDowell

By Rick Schniernv

The lirst edition ol the rein<
carnated Interim session has
been termed a “success" by
Interim Coordinator Rick Mac-
Dowell. MacDowell, a junior,
said he felt the recent interim
session (January 9-H) was suc-
cessiul because it “was student
organized and student run.”

Previous Interim sessions de-
voted to independent student
activity have been coordinated
by the tacuity and adminis-
tration, The last oi these was
held in January, 1965. Lack of
student participation and inter-
est caused discontinuation or
the program.

The program was revived this
year on a voluntary basis under
student control and for a bl’leler
period of time—iive days in-
stead of two weeks. Students
headed by MacDowell handled
all the organizational work.
About 350 students returned ear-
1y lrom Christmas vacation to
participate in the Interim pro
gram.

The program centered around
the lorty student-led discussion
groups. The groups each dealt
with one Of the following six
topics: the God is Dead controa
versy; Population Problems;
William Faulkner; D. H, Law-
rence; Joseph Conrad; and John
Updike. Five to nine students
participated in each or the dis-
cussions.

to MacDDwell and some discus

buted to a more relaxed atmos-

Reaction to the discussions as
expresed in a special Interim
evaluation poll was lovorable. or
those answering. 94 felt that the
student - led discussions were
worthwhile and effective, while
17 did not. 81 would not have

Some discussion groups aroused
such interest that they have
been continuing after Interim.

Other Interim activities includ—
ed coffee hour discussions, the
Roseniield lectures on world
population problems, and social
events.

The coffee hour discussmn on
premarital sex proved highly
popular with about 160 students
crowding into the South Lounge
to hear Mrs. Edith Ray, Iowa
State University; Mr. Ken Bar~
ringer, consultant tor Family-
Lile-Education of Iowa: and Mr.
Bob Weber, Planned Parent-
hood Association of Iowa.

Hauser Discusses Impending
World Overpopulalion Crisis

By Steve Montgomery

Rising population cannot be
ignored it we are to have a
realistic vision of our future en-
vironment, contended Rosen-
Tleld Lecturer Phillip M. Haus-
er, director ot the Population
Research and Training Center
at the University oi Chicago.

According to Dr. Hauser':
discussion of “World Popula<
tion: Trends and Implica-
tions." the ﬁrst in the three lec-
ture series delivered last week,
recent U.N. ﬁgures forecast a
world population of 7 billion in
the year 2000. and a density of
one person per square loot in
6000 years, it the current 2.1%
growth tale continues. In-
creased mortality and de-
creased natality remain the ob-
vious alternatives to the popu-
lation explosion.

Advances in hygiene and
medicine have slashed man’s
mortality rates. In the West
this “Demographic Revolu-
tion" has evolved over several
centuries, but due to man's Cul-
lure-transmitting capabilities,
more primitive areas can now
reap these benelits within a few
years. A ship anchored off Sai-
gon discharges the soap, enti-
biotics, pesticides, and fertillz<
er it took the rest or the world
centuries to develop.

Only under the pressure of
numbers have men focused
their ellorts on fertility control.
Tunisia, Egypt, South Korea.
India, and dominantly-Catholic
Chile have made decreased
natality national concerns. The
Kennedy and Johnson adminis-
trations have initiated a policy
aimed at decreasing the birth
rate to the theoretical optimum
of 2.27 children per couple.

Dr. Hauser noted that the
two major ideologies originally
opposed to birth control—Marx-
ism and Christianity — have
modified their stances. The So-
viet Union has found that over-
population is a brake on even
a healthy socialist economy and
has dropped her attacks on the
“Dismal Theorem” which con-

lends that population will al-
ways outrun tood supply.

Since the 1530's, Protestant:
have greatly revised their duo
trines on birth control, recogu
nizing that sex has implica-
tions beyond mere procreation.
Deliberations now in progress
in Roman Catholic councils in«
dicate their appreciation of the
limited workability of periodic
abstinence (rhythm method) in
combating the population
crisis.

Despite these ﬁrst hopeful
steps, major obstacles still
stymie effective solutions to
man’s lecundity. lnsullicient unA
derstanding of cultural change:
and social interactions and our
meager knowledge about effec-
tive contraception are impedi-
ments to progress that will re<
quire immense resources [or

System To Go

The head residents on Soutli
Campus will be retiring at thI
end of the year. “we are core
talnly grateiul to them tor their
many years or service and their
contributions to the Grinnell
campus, " said Mrs. Alice Lowl
Dean of Women.

stressing that the current
residents are not being sum-
marily dismissed, Dean Low ad-
ded, “Their retirement is com-
parable to what we expect of
faculty members, who teach un<
til at particular‘ age limit is
reached."

To replace the retiring stallf.
the administration is currently
seeking graduate students to
fill four new resident adviser
posts on South Campus. These
advisers, who will each counsel
