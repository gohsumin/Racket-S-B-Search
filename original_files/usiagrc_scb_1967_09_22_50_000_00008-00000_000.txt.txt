GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Monday night brought about a recurrence of the North Campus
Cretin Bowl. Led by the usual campus all-stars, it began as an
exciting yelling match instituted by one of the men’s residence
halls. After a series of scathingly original diatribes whose pur-
pose it was to institute a water fight, a momentary compromise
was reached as a quick offrtackie was run in the direction of South
Campus. As the drooling, slobbering idiots charged toward the
far-distant goal (to the great relief of those left on North campus
and the great dismay of those left on South Campus) some of us
were left to ponder on those arguments which imply that we are
mature enough to take care of ourselves. After this debacle, it
looks as though proctors should be brought back into each room
of North Campus.

Returning to the more legitimate side of North Campus sports,
I. M. football is now in full swing. The games are decidedly
rougher this year with the advent of rag—tag. Most teams seem to
be abidillg by the philosophy, “Pull the flag as you drag them
down but if you can't, just drag them down." More long runs are
in evidence due to this innovation including a 90-yard kick-off re-
turn by Phil “The Flash” Berlenthalr There are some things which
never change, however, including Langan losing football games.
They have dropped three games already this year thus stretching
their anti—win policy through at least two and one-half years.
Coming attractions include the annual bowl games which make
the Hatiield~McCoy feud look like a church social. Included Will bu
the oldest of the games featuring Dibble in the Toilet Bowl with
a new adversary, Smith, and the newest game, the Bird Bowl,
which features Clark and Cowles.

A belated word of congratulations to the homes femmes of
South Campus who daintily walked over the girls from Grace-
lend, 6-2, in ﬁeld hockey Eye-witness accounts say it was the
most brutal event on the Grinneli campus since 1000 students tried
to buy their first semester books at the same time.

iihhiiiERS WEN FERST MEET

in their first meet of the
y e a r, Grinnell's crossecount
team beat Coe, 26-33. Fog, wet
ground, and a defective start-
ing gun hampered the runners
and resulted in disappointing
times being posted.

The starting gun never did
fire as the barriers were false-
ly started several times. The
race finally commenced when
someone produced a whistle to
start them with.

Both the winner and runner-
up were from Cue. Gordon Zu-
brod won with a time of 15:58.6
on the 3 mile course followed
by teammate Earl Williams
with a l7:|JZ clocking. Third
place went to Grinnell's Doug

GRIDDERS MEET FIRST FOE

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Tomorrow is the first game
of the season for the Pioneer
griddersr In a poll of the con-
ference coaches, St, Olaf was
picked to win the conference
championship. This is roman
row's opponent. Guided by two
year veteran signal caller, Paul
Anderson, St. Olaf should be
the toughest test of Coach Edd
Bowers’ squad this year.

Success d a p e n d 5 almost
entirely on the play of veterans.
At present there are only two
non-iettermen on the starting
teamr These are Steve Carroll
and Al Cloud.

Bowers’ Boys were plagued
by an ineffective aerial attack
and a leaky pass defense last
year that resulted in a 2rd sea-
son. ln regard to this Bowers
stated, "we have been concen-
trating on those two phases of
the game and seem to be mak-
ing progress. in Lamb, Krait-
sik and Weeks, we have three
big, strong running backs if
we can pass well enough to
give them some running room,
we will give opponents’ defenses
a lot of trouble."

if this hope becomes a real-
ity Grinnell could improve its
4- record against St. Olaf and
give the students a very pleas-
ing upset victory.

A repeat of Grillnell's 13270
victory over the Des Moines
Y.M.C.A. in 1892 would be un~
likely, howeverr

FROSH HARRIERS
LOOK STRONG

By JEFF SCHECKTER '

Cross-country is at best a
lonely sport and freshmen are
generally the loneliest runners
of all. If this year's irosh
squad feels lonely it is only
because they have outrun every
one else in the race.

Led by Jack Gochenouer, the
ten members of the team pro-
vide strong competition for any
opponent. in last week's varsity
meet against cue, the freshmen
placed two men in the top
eight and came within one
point of topping the cue vatsity
if their score was counted.

The team members are Jack'
Guchenouer (f i f t h overall
against Coe), Ernie Weston
(eighth overall), Eric Jahn,
John Roweil, Tim Power, John
Russell, Bob Fritzlleier. Dim
Cavender, Wayne Luefker and
Erin Friesen.

The game will be held at
1:30 p.m. at Ward Stadium. An
added attraction will be a

cross-country race that is ex-
pected to climax in front of
Ward Stadium during the half
time of the football game.

Eric .Tahn of the Grinnell Frosli,
and tenth place went to a
C09 runner.

In an interview after the meet
Coach Obermiller said he was
particularly pleased with the
performance of his freshman
team. Speaking on the Varsity,
he said they should have a good
season and are in better shape
now than they were at this
time last year. He picked Caries
ton as the overwhelming favu
on'te to win their fifth conseo<
utive conference championship.
Obermiller chose Monmouth,K
Cornell, and Grinnell as posn
sible runner-ups and a chance
that St. Olaf might be in the
running too.

Tomorrow at 1:20, Grinnell
will host St. Olaf in a four
mile run on the Grinnell course.
The Grinnell Freshmen will 17!

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN RAZ

Precision slam bidding and Culbertson Asking aids

in general, there are at least two fundamentally different
kinds of bids: bids which give partner information and bids which
ask partner for information, Very often in slam bidding one need-
to know if partner has the first or second round controls in a par-
ticular suit or suits. These are the aces or voids, the kings or sin-
gletons, the knowledge with which one can decide to sign off at a
safe level or proceed to slam. Thus, very frequently in slam
bidding you need to make an asking bid, asking partner if ha no.
the controls.

The most common asking bid is the Blackwood Convention in
which one player bids 4NT, asking his partner for the number of
his aces. Partner then answers with a step response showing
quantitatively zero. one, two. or three aces. Unfortunately, this
most common slam convention is inadequate for the vast majority
of slams, because it does not give qualitative information (i.e., the
ace of a particular suit) and it cannot convey the distributional
Controls (i.e., the Voids or smgletons) Furthermore, it does not
exploit the full possibilities of the asking bid.

Culbertson did. Introduced in 1935, slam asking bids have be
come, along with the complicated step response conventions of
the continental systems, the most efficient way to bid slams.

Tile asking bid is an artificial forcing bid made in a question.
able Suit in order to find out if partner has control in that stilt.

Initially, the partnership must have an agreed trump suit.
Any suit that has been bid and raised by partner is an agreed
suit. or two bid and raised suits, the last suit is the agreed trump
suit. After a suit has been agreed upon, any bid in a new suit at
the level of four or higher is an asking bid, and is entirely artificial
and is absolutely forcmg one round. The member of the partner-
ship who makes the bid then becomes figuratively the dictator of
the hand since he will finally determine the contract, after which
his partner cannot bid. Thus, one person, usually the possessor of
the stronger hand, becomes the decision maker. The responses to
the first asking bid are shown in the following table:
