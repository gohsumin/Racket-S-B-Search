The Grinnell Pioneers rolled
up new rushing and total offense
records while deteating their
fourth victim, the Beloit Buc-
caneers by the impressive score
of 23—0, Saturday at Ward Field,

All iour of the Scarlet touelr
downs were ground out by a
clicking rushing ottense that
'netted 488 yards before the tinal
gun sounded. The Pioneers scoi»
ed once in each of the first two
quarters, and twice in the third
to compile their winning total

Grinnell received the opening
kickoff, but was unable to move,
and was lorced to punt, Beloit
came out of the huddle with a
surprise, because Pete Lille, nor.
mally a right halfback, was
playing quarterback in place oi
Alleconference Jim Kupllc, The,
Bucs had no better luck than)
Grinnell in getting their oliensci
rolling and also kicked.

With the ball again, the ,
Pioneers posed the first scor—
ing threat of the game when 1
Ron Sandler got a handoff
from quarterback nick Or- ,
chard, on the first play from i
scrimmage and took off 1
around right end tor 67 yards
to the Beloit 13. The march g
dissolved as quickly as it be» 1
gau, for Orchard preparing
to pass, was hit hard by a Buc—
caneer lineman and fumbled,
guard John Jacobson recover-
ing for the opposition on their
own 23 yard liner

Atter regaining possession oil
the pigskin, Pioneer halfback"
Carleton Peterson made seven)
yards, and fullback John Hal'»‘
tung galloped 21 tor a first down‘
at the Belolt in yard stripe. Pour
plays later, Hartung plunged
over from the two to give Grin-I
nell the iii-st of six tallies of the)
contest with 3:07 remaining in]
thalfll‘st quarter. Marty Jacobs

’ 'son booted the extra point, and

the score read 7-0.

As the second quarter began,
so did another Scarlet drive,
which netted five straight first
downs betore the Buccaneer dee
fense tightened. and the Pioneers
missed another iirst by inches
at the Eelolt 3. One casualty re-t
suited from this series of plays
when quarterback Orchard was
injured, and was taken out for
the rest of the game,

The Buc's ofiense rolled for
a short while midway in the
second quarter. Lille’s running
and Kuplic‘s passing picked up
two quick first downs before
the Grinnell line tightened,

Asked just how their partici—

a number oi men said they

time to study and to “socialize”
if they didn’t have daily ath-
letic drills and weekend trips to
contend with. But, they agreed
that the values of participation
In Sports more than compensated
for their lost time. Herc are sortie
at their comments:

Ran Dorr~ (cross country)
“The daily demands of practice
have especially prompted me to
fully use whatever time is or
vailahle during the rest of the
day tor studying, (When not
participating in athletics) 1 tend-
,ed to waste two or three hours
a day belore seriously beginning
or continuing my studies.”

Kirk Van Rooyan: (football)
“I feel that athletics are an ex.
tremely good way to relax from
the constant academic pressures,
to contribute something to the
college and to have a lot of
fun with a group of guys whom
I think are the greatest in the
world.“

Get Thomson: (cross country)
“I believe it is safe to say that
athletics have a negative effect
on my studies . . , (largely be—
cause) . , . of meets, especially
away meets. Friday afternoon
and most of Saturday are rare-
ly spent studying. Over the Sea»
son these “lost weekends” build
up. (Thomson also stated he felt
that if he were to limit his pa~
ticipation in oth 'tl'aecurrl
ular activities, his time spent in

   

:athletlcs would have less detri-
mental effect on 'his studies).

 

The new records set by G ‘
neil broke those made three
weeks earlier against Monmouth.
The old rushing mark of 413

 

l yards was replaced by 483 for

Saturday‘s outing, and the the
yard total offense standard was
erased by a whopping 531 gain-
ed against the Bucs.

John Corns: (football) “My

transfer my mental state from
one fixation to another. in oth
