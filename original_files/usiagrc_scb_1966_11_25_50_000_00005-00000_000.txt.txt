 

Knowlton was seen with the
girl who is now home on medi-
cal leave in the Forum on the
night of November 12. Both he
nnd the girl were slightly drunk
at the time and there was some
trouble with Forum officials but
they were not asked to leave the
Forum as has been rumored.
That night Knowlton and the
girl went to the of! campus
apartment on Sixth Avenue
where both Knowlton and Han-
enberg live.

Michele Anderson, bette r
known on campus as “Mimi,"
was also spending the night at
the apartment. Kenneth Adel.
man, a senior who until
very recently dated the girl who
was with Knowlton, became
aware that she was at the apart-
ment, and Bi about 2:30 arm.
Sunday morning went over to

EETING oi Sim Knni. Karen Lau—
, Bob Johntlen. Bond Faulwell and
the idea of the '
planning (allowed lhir meeting be-

in" originated.

the apartment with a iriend or
his, Nordahl Brue, senior, in an
attempt to get the girl to re—
turn to her dorm. The girl did
not want to leave and a heated
discussion followed between her
and Adelman. She told the 5&3
that some physical force was
used on her by Adelman in the
attempt to make her leave the
apartment. She said she might
have agreed to return to her
dorm ii Adelman had “not been
so pushy” and were it not tor
her tear or being caught trying
to enter the dorm through a
Window. She said that Knowlton
did not try to make her stay;
he leit the decision up to her.
During the disturbance Ander-
son was seen by both Erue and
Adeiman, although Adelman
told the 5&3 he did not know
who she was or that she was
even a student at Grinnell. He
said that he was simply not
concerned with the then uniden-
tified girl. Brue, who did know
Anderson, said that he did not
lnior—m Adelinan at her identity
until Monday morning.
Adelman told the 5&3 that he
had been concerned about the
welfare of his former girlfriend
recently because she was be-
having in a way much different
than she usually does. Adelman
had Called the girl's father sev-
eral times that weekend in an
attempt to get him to do some-
thing to help. Her father asked
her sister. it student in another

Midwest college, to come to
Grinnell to vi 't the girl. The
sister came during the week-
end and checked on the girl but
returned to college Sunday.

Adelman, still concerned about
the tact that nothing was be-
ing done to help the girl, talked
to Henrerork Steiner, English,
Monday in the early afternoon.
Steiner, a personal iriend oi
Adelman’s, told the 5&3 he
thought something should be
done and he went to see Dean
of Women Alice Law that after-
noon. Steiner told the 5&3 that
Adelmsn had mentioned the
presence of “another gir" but
that he did not know whether
she was a town girl or a stu-
dent. Steiner said he passed this
information on to Dean Low and
Dean ot Men S. Eugene Thomp-
son.

Steiner said the other two
people (l-lanenberg and Ander-
son) were Significant to Adel»
man because they would do
nothing to help. Adelman told
the 5&3 that he “was not and
is not now” concerned about
Hanenberg and Anderson.

When Steiner was asked by
the 5&3 ii he thought the then
unknown girl would be in
trouble if she was iound out he
said, "I assumed that it she
was a student and they did find
out there would be trouble —-
this was only a passing consid«
eralibn on my part. it you get
caught you get caught."

Steiner went on to say, "The
issue is not whether students
can experiment with sex — only
how they go about it. For all
practical purposes their crime
(reierrlng to l-lsnenberg and
Anderson) was getting caught. 1
think' for purposes at rationale,
in tern-lab! the committee de-
cision, their crime was that
they did not take some meas-
ures to help these people (re-
ierring tn Adelman and the
girl). I don't think the commit-
tee was upholding a moral
structure. 1 think they were re-
moving {rcm campus people
who are not contributing to the
campus or who are not beneﬁt-
ing from the campus."

Steiner explained. “I haven’t
the slightest idea if suspension
will do these individuals any
good H only time will tell. i
don't think the loss of these
two people (Hanenberg and An-
derson) will do the college any
ham.”

He added, “The major con-
sequence, ! suppose, [mm the
committee’s point at view, is
that the college is willing and
able to maintain the integrity
of its rule structure. The col-
lege is not in u position to
provide an enviromnent that
gets in the way of its primary
function, education. Unlimit-
ed visitation, visitation irom
1:00 A.M. 3:00 A.M., coedu-
cational llvmg arrangements,
are not in the best interests of
education. The college is de-
vised as primarily an institu-
tion of education — not learn-
ing how in live. i think we
can provide boys and girls
with better ways of learning
about each other, but not by
letting them play house."
When asked it he would turn
other violations in to the deans,
Steiner Said, “If I {eel that a
person is doing himselt dam-
age, others damage, or the col

lege damage. I will report him."

The Stu! has deiinite knowledge

that Steiner is personally aware
of at least three other visita-

tions and/or hours violations
that took place recently.
Early this week Steiner was
invited to explain his part in the
case to the members of James
Hall. Some of the girls present
expressed tear or talkin to a
laculty member or admi stra-
tor in a supposed “counselling
situation” about another student
in trouble, even if the student is
"obviously psychotic," w h e n
there are other people involved
that may become implicated.
The students said the chance of
suspension for innocent bystand-
ers is too much of a price to
pay-
,Atter the meeting at James
and atter a talk Tuesday or this
week with Knowlton and CoiHP
President Robert Foote about
Knowlton's part or guilt in the
case, Steiner told the 5&1?
Wednesday morning, “l am now
willing to concede that Frank
(Knowlton) did not know ~ (the
girl now on medical leave) was
sick.”

He went on to say, “I still
ﬁnd this incomprehensible
that the Committee would sus-
pend lhese students tor mere-
ly breaking the visitation rule.
I don’t really think I am ac-
cusing the Deans; i don’t
know What other evidence was
involved.“

At this interview Steiner told
the 5&3, “The Deans knew
there was someone else there
because of my advice." Steiner
added. “i am very worried
about the effect at this on coun»
seling and advising. How can i
ever again go to the Dean's oi—
iice on rule violations — if
someone else innocent is in»
Volved."

When asked about the sus-
pension ni Hanenherg and An-
derson Steiner said, “This is
a price that I‘m still willing
to pay to get help for — (the
girl). But this is an excessive
price to pay in my opinion.
The price is damn, damn,
high.”

The girl on “medical leave”
was taken out of class Monday
by Dean Low and Dean Thomp-
son and taken to a hospital in
Newton for “observation.” Her
father later came and took her
home. At this point it is thought
that Dean Thompson did not
know of the identity Elf Ander-
son, hut there has been specu~
lation that Dean Low found out
while taking the girl to New-
ton. The 5&3 has not yet been
able to verify this.

Hanenberg was called in to
talk with Dean Thompson Tues-
day and according to Hanen-
berg Thompson said, “i sup<
pose you know about this mess.
When Nord and Ken came over
they iound Mimi (Michele) An-
derson in the apartment. is this
true?" Hanenberg said he ad-
mitted it then.

Hanenberg told the 5&3 that
Thompson said he would have to

tollow through on the case be.
cause “too many people already
know about it.” There is much
speculation that Thompson was
bluiiing lianenberg in claiming
to know the girl was Anderson.
it has been pointed out that be-
cause they had been dating tor
so long it would not be Very dif-
ticult to suspect that it Hanen-
berg had a girl in the apart-
ment it would have been Ander-
son.

Gordy MacAlplne, who lives
with Hanenberg and Knowlton,
Said Thompson Called him in at
about 1:30 PM. Tuesday and
asked him a lot of “ambiguous”
questions “as if Thompson
didn’t know anything about it."
MacAlpine said that Thompson
didn't ask him anything spe-
ciiic, “He just let me talk."
When asked by the 58:3 about
Hanenberg and Anderson, Mac-
Alpine said, “[ condone eliery-
thing they have done, because
it has been done in such a way
that It is not degrading to them
or to the caliber ol Grinnell
College students."

He added, “1 think the pen-
alty in this case was much Ion
severe. They are good stuv
dents, they enjoy studying.
they have inquiring minds and
they are serious people. i
don’t see any of them as be-
ing immature or escapist.”

The 5&3 has become aware
that Anderson's identity was
known to a number of people on
campus by Monday night. Han-
enberg and Knowlton went to
talk to Adelman in his room in
Cowles Monday evening. Dllr<
ing the conversation that fol~
lowed the name ‘Mimi” was
overheard by a member or
Cowles, but he told the 5&3
that he "didn't tell anyone
else."

Hanenberg later told the 5&3
that Adelman “promised sever
al times that he wouldn’t re-
port us." The 5&3 has been
able to find no evidence that
Adelman did not keep this
promise, Nord Brue, who knew
Anderson’s identity all along.
told the 5&3, “i think (the name
“Mimi") could have come out
in Dibble. Cowles or in Mimi’s
hall (Cleveland).” The 5&3 has
been aware of a rumor that An-
dersorl's identity “came through
a faculty member through a
student."

The Son attempted to talk
with the Deans indiVldually
about the case, and Dean Rich-
ard Winters and Dean Thompr
son, acting as spokesman tor
the Deans, reinsed to meet with
the 5&3 unless they Could all be

present at the same time. The
5&9 had individual appointo
ments with Winters, Thompson
and Low, which they cancelled
when they became aware or the
topic or discussion. As oi press
time the deans have not agreed
to talk individually with the
5&3 about their participation in
the case.

in a 5&3 interview with the
three suspended students last
Sunday, Anderson told the sap
(concerning her appearance be
fore the committee) “I was coin-
pletely open with the faculty
and deans, like you are in the
student courts, and i think this
was a mistake."

iianenberg said “The rule is
obviously intended to limit pie-
marltal intercourse". He added
"it is very hard to feel guilty
about violating a cultural lag.”
Anderson commented “Dean
Low wants us to go back and
change our morals to in the
rules.”

l-lanenberg was to have played
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto solo
in the orchestra concert tomor-
row night. As the situation
stands he will not be permitted
to do so and because of this
two members of the orchestra
have relused to periorm. Denis
tie Coleau, conductor oi the ore
chestra and chairman pt the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, said he would not bring
anyone else in to replace Han-
enberg, but the concert will
take place as planned.

Another appeal will he made
by the students Saturday to
President Glenn Leggett, who
has been out of town during the
past week. Both Hanenbcrg’s
and Knowlmn’s fathers are in
Grinnell and will appear at the
appeal hearing. As the sea
went to press at 4:00 PM. to

not available for Commen ~
