To the Editor:

Since you have asked for par-
ents’ opinions on “hours" for
women students, l am glad to
add mine. i not only would not
have sent my daughter to a col-
lege with no such restrictions.
but I would not care to send
my son to a school with no
“hours“ for women students.

Such sorcalled “freedom"would
he injurious not only to the inor—
als of many students but certain—
ly to their health and scholastic
records as well.

LET US HOPE that the ad—
ministration will not yield to
any student pressure in making ,
changes in rules which could
only be detrimental to the col<
lege. i am interested in the rep
utation oi the school both as a
parent and an alumnus.

hit frosh hours

To the Editor:

Last Sunday night a number
of people leit the Theater
Workshop (Arena Theatre) in
the middle of a periormance, in
order to comply with Fresh
men Women's Hours. Their de~
parture was particularly annoy.
ing as it was in the midst of
an important scene. In keeping
with the current discussion
a b o u t Women's Hours, we
thought that the iollowlng pas-
sage from ”Gray‘s Analogy”
(with all apologies to Thomas

Gray) was appropriate.

oi parting day,
The lowing herd winds slow-
ly o’er the lea.
The women homeward plod
their weary way
To join, perforce, imprison-
ed sanctity.
