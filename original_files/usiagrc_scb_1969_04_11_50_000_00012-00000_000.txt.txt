that had armbands around their necks.

A Senate resolution and a petition urg-
ing the withdrawal 0i credit from ROTC
were presented by Thomas to faculty
chairman Joseph F. Well before the
meeting.

Thomas said that 400 students, more
than one third oi the students at Grin-
nell, had signed the petition in u 48-
hour period. Earlier petitions posted
in halls had been torn down, Thoma:
said.

Thomas summarized the reasons for
disuccredidation of ROTC in this mali‘
ner:

“First, the college has no actual con<
trol over the ROTC Curriculum accord-
ing to the terms of the ROTC contract
with the college.

“Second, although the presence of the
ROTC option may be consistent with the
liberal arts philosophy, the sanctioning
or that option is perhaps antithetical to
the stated obiectives of the college."

History protessor Gregory Gumif, who
Introduced the faculty motion to with
draw ROTC credit told the Sat! that
some protessors who accepted the arm-
bands entered the meeting and spoke
against the motion. “They thought that

tured.

College President Glenn Leggett, who
presided at the faculty meeting, said
that the demonstration was “orderly and
conducted with good humor."

Leggett conﬁrmed a report that an
American flag with a swastika painted
on it wss found hanging incur a lab desk
in the science lecture hall before the
meeting.

Coach Edd Bowers discovered and re
moved the flag when he entered the
room to attend a brief Executive Coun-
cil meeting that was held before the
faculty meeting.

“This Is not the Grinnell way of doing
things," Leggett said or the ﬂag dese-
cration, which he described as “crudely
done,"

“Grinllell students don't pretend to be
what they are not," he continued.
“They look you straight in the eye.”

“It wasn't the Grinnell style." Leggett
reels, ”And what‘s so enraging about it
is that it is self-defeating. Such actions
can become more fascistic than what i:
being protested."

Leggett also told the S“! that it stus
dent was caught eavesdropping and tnk<
ing notes in a storeroom adjoining the
faculty meeting.

He was discovered by professors Ray-
mond Betts and Wall when they entered
the storeroom to count secret ballots on
the ROTC motion. The student's notebook
was immediately conﬁscated, Leggett
said.

Leggett said that the student later
came to him and identified himself. The
president has decided not to reveal the
name of the student involved, but he
has not decided whether or not action
will be taken against him.

current struggle for liberation emerges.

In terms of action, one must approach
the institutions or the community. Again,
the white individual, and those he will in-
ﬂuence, can exert a marked eitect on
white school boards, white city councils,
white businesses, white corporations, and
white industries where the black man is
tragically limited in access not to men-
tion effect.

Explore City Problems

Rice University in Houston, Texas,
was the host to the Urban Futures USA
conierence held March 2&29. Eighty
Schools were invited to send student
representatives in urban problems. Grins
nell was represented by Bob Schwah, a
senior sociology major, and David Hodg-
man, a senior economics major.

The sun or this project was threefold:
I) To widen student and public under-
standing and interest in the future dos
velopment at American life;

2) To summarize and appraise research

on the trends in American life with re

gard to the future or American cities,

19802000;

3) To review current procedures and
goals in urban stiairs, making suggesr
tions for revised policies, and for re-
vised objectives, in view or our in-
creasing insight about Americs's ur-
banizing society.

The conference was very fortunate to
have been Able to attract a host of excel-
lent speakers. Most notable among these
were: Charles Abrams, noted authority
on housing and urban planning; James
Q. Wilson, well known protessor oi gov-
erument at Harvard University; and
Saul Alinsky, controversial organizer of
the urban poor. In addition [0 the 160‘
tures, each of the delegates participated
in small discussion groups which concern
irated on a single issue in the urban
crisis.

Schwah and l-lodgmnn agree that tho
coniererice gave them some new perspec<
tives on contemporary problems. They
tool that it any consensus was reached
among the delegates, it was on endorse
ment or Alinsky’s approach — that or
community organization in order to torce
policy makers to be more rcspomive to
community needs. Beyond that, innuni<
treble questions were asked, none at
which were answered satisfactorily.
