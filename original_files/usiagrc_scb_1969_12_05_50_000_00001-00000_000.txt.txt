”The Newspaper Iowa Printers Frown Upon”

A NOTE FROM THE EDITOR—~w-As you might have deduced by now, the Scarlet g Black is
encountering difficulties in its attempts to locate a printer in the vicinity of
Grinnell who will print the student newspaper of the college without censoring it.
We terminated our contract with the Newton Daily News after E.K. Shaw,
publisher of the News, deleted words from the No‘. lb and the Nov. 21 issues of

the S&B. Shaw claimed that the words (one of them was ”masturbating”) were

”dirty” and refused to print them in his shop,
t

David Sutherland, of the Sutherland Printing Company in Montezuma, agreed on
Nov. 2b to print today‘s issue of the §§§a At that time he said he would print
anything the college sponsored without censoring it.

However, last Monday Sutherland called Prof, Herbert Prescott (Adviser to
Student Publications) to say that he had changed his mind and would not print the
§§§a According to Prescott, Sutherland said he had consulted his attorney, who
advised him that ”he would get more grief than profit“ if he printed the §§§.
Prescott indicated that Sutherland was concerned with "community pressure" that
might result if he printed the §g§. (Sutherland, by the way, is an alumnus
of Grinnell .)

Prescott said that Sutherland also told him that a linotypist refused to
set any §§§ copy in type, although I had not yet submitted any copy to be set
at Montezuma. Apparently the so—called typesetter got cold feet not because
§§§ copy was "obscene,” but rather because it was ”unseen,"

Anyway, we couldn1t find a new printer in time to publish a regular issue
today. However, Winston Watson, publisher of the Cedar Valley Qaily Eimgg in
Vinton, has agreed to print next week‘s §§§—~uncensored,

In the meantime, I hope this "§§§ Special” will tide things over until next
week. Multilithed at the college‘s Service Bureau, it includes several news briefs
and a letter to the editor from President Glenn Ieggett on what he calls "the
pretection of dissent and the prevention of violence at Grinnell,"

I apologize to §§§ readers for the recent inconvenience, but it's beyond my

control, As far as freedom of the press is concerned, America is a gyp,
