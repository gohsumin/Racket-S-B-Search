THE SCARLET AND BLACK.

Snow White And 7 Freaks To Open

Experimental Children’s Th-
eatre is alive and well at
Grinnell College and plans to
come out of hiding during7:00
p.m. performances November
is and 14 and during a 2:00
matinee performance the 14th
in the Arena theatre. After
making its great debut at Gr-
innell the theatre group will
make a once-insarlifetime
tour of area elementary Sch
0015. The totally improvised
script is entitled only Snow
White because Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs is a copy-
righted title, but is based on
that famous andbelovedstory.

No script was provided the
actors and the entire play was
written by the cast members
themselves as they went ale
ong, having only an idea of
the basic story to guide them.

DANCERS in the delightful plat

The success of the play, then,
depends solely on the ingen-
uity and creativity of the see
tors. These ingenious and
creative thespians are Vicki

Lofquist, Jamie Rosenblatt,
Greg Gaines, Jule Kagsn, Jack
Gay, Jane Freidson, Karen
Auerbach, Phyllis Ganser
Deni Deutsch, Richard Smith,
and Ron Ai. Included in the
illustrious cast are four dan-
cers, Elizabeth Copeland,
Marilyn Musscr, Mary Ellen
Farrant, and Deb Sanden, wht
ose original choreography re-
flects the various moods ofthe
play as the plot unwinds.

The cast is given a helping
hand by Don Boros, new man
in Grinnell's theatre depart-
ment, and assistant Claire

Rosenbusch. Last but surely
not least (as they say) is the

v 1,. 5

role of Jim Spell. Heprovides
a onerman band, but not an
everyday runrof‘the-mill
one-man band: he uses house
hold objects such as pots and
pans, and Other things that
would be familiar to the chil*
dren, to create his own spe~
cial brand of music.

The purpose of this type of
experimental theatre (besides
entertainment, of course) is
to familiarize the actors, as
well as theaudience,withwhat
is involved in the process of
theatre. The actors experi-
ment with various phases of
theatre and in this way learn
more about what makes thea-
tre “tick." Except for the old
basic story, the play is en*
tirely original and will be a
brand new ”Grinnell experi—
ence."

Brown Warns Thot Pollution Affects Climate

green house effect is uncer-

On November 5, Dr. TheoV
dore Brown of the University
of Illinois delivered the lace
me, "People Who Live in
Gas Houses." A mixed group
of faculty and students heard
Brown discuss three ways that
air pollution influences clir
mate. These were theaddition
of infrared absorbants and
particulate matter to the at-
mosphere, the effect of ins
creased energy consumption
and the subsequent addition of
heat to the environment.

The first area he explored
was that of changing the at’
mosphere’s absorption of
infrared energy. The sun
emits energy of a relatively
short wavelength which read-
ily permeates theatmosphere.
This energy is “bounced off"
the earth back to the atmos~
phere where the principle abs
sorbers of it are water and
carbon dioxide. The amountof
carbon dioxide in the ﬂimOS’
phere is particularly import-
ant in determining its ability
to absorb heat. This is known
as the green house effect.
The present extent of the

pain. It appears responsible
for no more than two-tenths
of a degree temperature m,

crease at the most. However,

as we burn more fossil fuels,
adding more carbon dioxide,

the absorption of heat will in-
crease. By the year 2050, we

will have used most of our

known supplies of fossilfuels.

Their burning will have doub-

led the amount of carbon dice

xide in the air. About 60% of

the carbon dioxide will be

quickly absorbed by the sure

face of the oceans, but the
rest will stay in the atmos~

phere for as long as fourhun-

dred years. This carbon dior

xide will‘absorb infrared rays
and prevent their radiation

into space, thus heating the
surface of the earth by about
four degrees. Theresultmight
be to melt the polar ice caps

and raise the level of the CC,

eans. Additionally, the amount

of precipitation in the northern
hemisphere will probably def

crease. Othcrlesspredictable
effects might also occur.

The second area Erown con-
sidered was the effect of larr

ger amounts of particulate
matter in the air. This matter
could decrease the solar rad-
iation reaching the earth and
produce a drop in temper
ature. Again it is difficult to
interpret present data, but tir
ere is evidence that the cool*
ing phenomenon will occur in
the future.

Finally, Brown discussed cl-
imate changes due to energy
consumption. All energy used
on earth eventually becomes
heat added to the environment.
While the heat currently pro
duced is negligible, in the
future areas of concentrated
population, using nuclear ens
ergy, could put outa signifi»
cant amount of heat.

Brown suggested the definite
need for increased research
in the area of energy gener-
ation. All presently known ims
provements in nuclear energy
still leave the problem of th-
ermal pollution. In the future
we may be forced to limit the
consumption of energy. Brown
concluded with the hope that
research in the near future
would nullify all his glumpres
dictions for 2050.

There will be a Hayride and Campfire Friday night,
weather permitting, from 7:30 to 11:30. The cost is
the usual 50¢; please sign up at the Forum desk.

Religion Committee Reports

Last year a Religious Acti-
vities committee was set up
by Dean Wall,under the chair-
manship of James Fudge, to
make recommendations to the
administration baded on a re-
view of campus religious ac
tivities. The other faculty mes
mbers on the committee are
Dennis Haas and Al Jones.
The representatives from the
student body are Ken Labor
witz, a senior, Floyd Slotter'
back, a junior, and Lisa Wentz,
a sophomore.

The committee has continued
meeting this year to finalize
their planned recommenda~
tions to the administration.
There are two points onwhich
the committee is in agree-
ment. The first is the neces-
sity of an interdisciplinary
major in religion. This major
would include Eastern religi-
ons, the Jewish religion, and
other religions as well as the
Christian religion. This major
would be set up so as to meet
the needs of the broadestbase
of students possible, and not
just a group believing in one
basic faith. The second point
is that of the need for some
type of religious services.
The committee has found that
there are enough students on
campus who feel a need for
chapel services to warrant
their continuation. Dennis
Haas, the college chaplain,
has and will continue to offer
a wide variety of religious
services which are designed
to appeal to as many people
as possible. These are desig-
ned not only for the Christian,
but for those ofdifferent faiths
as well. The Religious Acti-
vities committee felt that it
was necessary to appeal to
those of other faiths because
die campus does include peo-
Dle nfall faiths. The commit-

tee has decided that some form
of religious activity is neces»
sary, but has been wrestling
with the problem ofhow to best
serve all Students with these
activities.

Some time within the next
few weeks the committee plans
to present their findings to the
administration; what the ad»
ministration will do with d1em
cannot be said at this time.
The committee, though, is 31.
most done with its assigned
work.

CBS Proposal Asks
Block Studios Moior

One of the major activities
of the Concerned Black Stud-
ents this year will be to try to
establish a Black Studies ma-
jor, comparable to the Amer-
ican Studies major now offer-
ed.

According to Booker Garter,
president, they are investigas
ting the possibility ofrecruit-
ing black professors and dis-
cussing the criteria of such a
major.

The CBS is also sponsoring
the Avi Ailey mncers,ablack
dance troupe. in February.

They are trying to recruit
more black students here and
encouraging the administra'
tion to waive certain scholas»
tic requirements and accept
more students from the hard
core, ghettus.

A library of black literature,
located in the Black Cultural
House, is being assembled.
The material will be open to
the campus when the library
is completed.

In the future, the CBS will
have rap sessions with the
college community and show
films concerning black cul‘
ture.

Elton John And Sly Reviewed

by Ron Medvin

This column begins what I
hope will be a weekly series
reviewing new recordalbums.
My comments will be short,
and obviously, the reviews will
not be professional. lam just
trying to give my opinions of
some of the music beingmade
today.

A name which is being menr
tioned more and more these
days is that of Elton John. His
second album (Elton John“
Uni73090) is being played on,
FM stations across the counr
try, and he even (unfortunate-
ly) has made it to the AM air-
waves with his song entitled,
“Your Song." In England, Eli
ton John is the biggestattrac-
tion of the year, and he should
catch on soon in the States as
more people hear his only Am-
erican album.

There is no doubt about it;
his album is worth listening
to . . . many times. In songs
like “Take Me to the Pilot"
and ”BorderSong”hispo\Verr
ful voice will overwhelm you,
in spite of the orchestration
which sometimes seems to try
to cover him up. “Sixty Years
On" and “The King is Dead",
however, use the orchestra to
Elton‘s advantage as it pro-
vides a beautiful background
to his excellent singing. And
“Your Song" is probably the
most beautiful and poeticsong

heard In a long while. Elton's
voice easily adapts to the in-
timate style of the song, and
die lyrics (written by Bernie
Taupin) are excellent.

Elton John deserves all the
praise he is getting. Ifyouare
wondering why, get a hold of
his album; you will be getting
one of the year's best.

An album released just a
short while ago will no doubt
sell well, and for good reason.
The album is Sly it The Fam-
ily Stone: Greatest Hits (Epic
KESO325) and contains ev-
ery one of their great songs.
”Dance to the Music", “IWant
to Take You Higher" and
“Stand" still are powerful
songs with the driving Stone
beat. Sly’s vocals are of
course excellent, and the rest
of the group matches his vibe
rant style. The instrumentas
tion is also of high qualit '
there is no resisting the mu-
sic of the Family Stone. This
is definately an album for
“fans" of Sly . . . and if you
missed him in Chicago, this
album is a worthy substitute!
(He was great in New York!)

If you have any comments or
criticisms - (or if you want
me to review a specific al-
bum) , please let me know by
writing to Box 717 or write to
the 58:8 office. Also, don't
forget the appearance ofEnoch
Smokey on the 14th; they’ll
be playing at 9:00 in Derby.
