Girls’ Hockey Team
Graces Graceland,

By CINDY ROOT

Graceland College was the
scene of a scoreless day for
the girls’ field hockey team.
Grinnell met Graceland in tho
first round, and neither team
could sneak one by the goalies,

until Graceland whacked one in
with five minutes left to go in
the second half. Poor stickwork
and control slowed the game
down considerably, and proved
quite frustrating to those mem-
bers on the team who have
some idea of what good clean
hockey really is. Although Grim
neil had many chances to score,
we lacked that extra something
that makes a winning team. it
was a dlsllppointlng, but de-
served loss. Maybe now we’ll
get some girls out to practioexr
we obviously need itl

Our second round match was
against Central Missouri State,
who, with their accurate passes
and good stickwork, spurred
out team on to really fight, and
finally we almost clicked. Cathy
Ellis and Marcia David played
superbly on defense, helped by
Narda Cisco and Nancy Eetz,
who were quite effective in
breaking up many of Missouri’s
pass patterns. Goalie Connie
Bcnham, in her typical, res
laxed manner, saved anything
that happened to penetrate this
hard working defense. The for-
wards also made a lot of good
breaks, but couldn’t quite get
the ball in the cage.

We're fired now, though, and
after we shake the kinks from
our muscles, we will be a lot
better tuned for our final home
game against Drake on Thurs<

both teams agreed to play off
the draw. The score remained
even after two five-minute
overtlmes, forcing the game
into ’sudden death’ (the first
team to score wins).

The Pioneer's spurred by the
thought of last year’s humilia<
tion, grabbed a quick lead.
Dave North, left wing for the
Pioneers, scored on an assist
from Korstnd early in the first
half. Bruce Graham booted his
5th goal of the season to put
Gi'inneli ahead 2-0. Carleton
scored twice with a strongly
overloaded ielt side to make it
2-2.

John Videtich, Substituting
for Graham, picked up a loose
pass from Korstad and scored
a key goal to give the Pioneers
a 3-2 edge at halftime.

The second half was domi-
nated by delensive play. Goalie

In remarking on the fine
