Diplomacy

Cont. (rum 1). e

l

democratic leaders an embrace t

It is easy to see why Dr. Cass
tro has such an easy time arous-‘
ing the ire of his fellow Cubans‘
by reieiring to the history of
US»ciiban relations, particularlyl
the Flatt Amendment. The point,
must be made clear that in suchi
cases the imperialism ot the US
was almost entirely economic,
not political, Although there
were several chances, and ab;
ways pressure to do so. the US:
did not annex Cuba, The case:
as many similar ones, has proved
.that this type ot tie is far sti'ongg
er than political ties.

The common Latin American

icture oi the US as the coir»
sciously imperialistic Colossus

or the North is as ialse as tho i

common Us picture of Latin

America as a barely civilized
jungle.

The history oi' the diplomatic
relations between the US and
the Latin American countries Vis‘
much more a story or neglect
than of conscious imperialism
en the part of the US. a story
of coping with diplomatic prob—
lems caused by short-range pol—
icies dictated by immediate self-
interest, a story of mutual ig-
norance and misunderstanding o:
the social, cconornic, and political
conditions which have giveni' e‘
to the historical. political pr :-
snrcs in the US and in Latin
America.

with the revolution in all oi
its aspects: the background. the
present and the future Come
rnunisin and Cuba, agrarian re—
ioin-i, toi ign domination and
presi‘cvolution miscry are taken
up. But because ot its (actual,
relative calm approach, “Anais
oniy" is by far the better of
the two as a study aid for the
Latin American Conicrenco,

Both books show an optimism
toward the progress or the
Cuban revolution. Mills and
Hubei‘man and SW y hold
great hopes tor the admittedly
uncertain future In spite of
this, "Anatomy” implies a rathe-
er disheartening likelihood. If
socialization and naiionallzationl
continue in Latin America, there:
is, according to “Anatomy,”
little hope that ilic United States
will take Cuba as a "lesson” in
bad policy and go on to lead
the rest of Latin America to
political democracy and eco-
nomic independence. ‘

“Big business interests
which are already sutiering
losses as a result of the
Cuban revolution and stand
to lose so much more irom its
spread to Latin America . . .
will not scrapie to use any
and all methods to attain its
ends." '

l
i

In other words. it. as both}
books insist, United States policy:
is strongly influenced or evenl
determined by the interests or
big business it seems that the‘
ideals and principles of demons}
racy have taken a back scat‘
to the probabilities of proiit, This‘
is a slanted opinion but that'
men such as Mills, Sweezy and

Huberinan believe it is reason
enough to give these views full‘
consideration. 1
