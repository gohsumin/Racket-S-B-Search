Seek $1.85-hr. at S.

SAN FRANCISCO, C a l i i.
(CPS) Dining room em—
ployees at San Francisco State
College may become members
of a union shop tilis year, it
predictions ot Tom Mazzolini,
leader of the Organization of
student Employees (0512) are
accurate.

Last semester. the OSE went
on strike against the commons
dining room to protest present
$1.30 to 51.40 per hour wages
and to demand establishment of
a union shop. '

Mazzolini said ﬁnal approval
of the union shop would have
to come from a board govern.
ing the commons, but he was
conﬁdent the board would grant Q
the 035 proposal, It the pro-
posal is passed, any student
employee in the commons or
dining room would have to be»

30 days.

Provided there are no diffi-
culties over a union shop ar»
rangement, Mazzolini will press
for an across—the-board pay
hike to $1.85, "This pay raise,"
Muzolini said, “is desperately
needed to match the rising cost
or living. Seventy—rive per cent
or 052: membership have to
support themselves."

Mazzolini accused commons

year.

Despite these losses, Mazzo—
lini said, the other associated
college concerns are well in
the black. The bookstore, tor
example, makes a proﬁt or
over $10,000. He asked that
part or the proﬁt irorn the
bookstore be used to under-
write a pay hike for student
employees in the commons.
San Francisco State students
are not the first to unionize.
Last year, all student employees
at the University or Michigan
organized, picketed and pro-
tested until the minimum wage
was raised from $1.00 to $1.25.

IDEA“!

Robert W. McMillan, art, direc-
tor oi the gallery.

The prints display the health
or a Polish tradition in graphie
expression that arose from the
early 20th-century European re-
surgence oi printmaking. rho
posters, by leading Polish prac-
titioners of an art form utilized
tor more commercial objectives
in Western Europe and Amer-
ica, are bold, assertive, and
gay, lunctioning like decorative
banners.

“Evidence of a continuing ei-
liance with Western European
thought and reeling could not
he more strikingly revealed,"
McMillan stated.

The exhibition, which was ses
cured through the Smithsonian
Institution In Washington, D.C.,‘
will continue through Nov. 9.

DEAR REE:

lately, every time i call my girl, she's either ”not in" or "not inter-
ested." Last week I called her 23iimes and couldn't even make a
coﬂee dale. The trouble started when she started dating a guy
who owns a Dodge Coronet. Now she goes to parties with him,
dances, football games, etc. Do you think i should call her again,
or should i iorgei her and break her heart?

a date to see the '67 Coronet, the cor that's breaking heoris all

break. Ask her to go for t: ride in your new Coronet. i think she'll
