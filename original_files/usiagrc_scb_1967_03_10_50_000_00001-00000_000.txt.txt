Revised Court Proposal Approved By Senate;
Next Must Pass Faculty. Student Referendum

By Richard Schnelrov

Wednesday night the Senate
approved a slightly revised ver-
sion of the community court
proposal in a marathon three
hour session. The proposal was
made in the form of a sub-
stitution in the judicial and
legislative sections of the SGA
toy—laws. .

The approved proposal will
be presented to a special fac-
ulty meeting Monday. it ap—
proved, the bylaws will be sub-
mitted to'a student referendum
where a so percent majority
Will he required fer ratification.

In its anal torm the proposal
provides for a judicial court of
three students and three facul~
ty members and a policymak-
iilg committee consisting of
three faculty members and the
Executive Cabinet. The policy
making committee will replace
the present FCSA in function,

The approved change in the
by-laws differed in a number
of areas from the proposal sub
mitted to students February 18.
There were no major revisions,
however. Probably the most im-
portant change was in the form
of an amendment that would
allow senators and hail vice-
presidents to be eligible for
membership in the judicial Coun-
cil. Originally. senators and
vice-presidents were eliminated
lrom consideration.

The Senate approved two ad-
ditional changes, The first one
provided that the appointment
or student representatives to
the court would occur on De-
cember 1 anti May 1 instead
of April 15 as previously stip-
ulated. The second change pro-
vided that the chairman of the
court serve a one semester term
and be allowed to succeed him-
seii. ,

In its final form the proposal
does not enumerate specific
procedures for the court.

Rather, it establishes guide
lines within which the court will
exercise considerable ireedom.

Much of the Senate meeting
was taken up by an inrdepth
discussion of two amendments:
one submitted by Senator David
Swee, and the other by Senator
Roger Koenkerr Swee’s amend-

ment raised an important ques-
tion: What will happen in the
court in the case of a tie vote?
His amendment calling for the
court to submit its case to the
President of the college was
rejected by the Senate on the

Apartments for Women Pending;
Finances Will Influence Decision

By Susan Fogg

Ofﬂoampus apartments for
women will he a reality next
year pending a decision by the
Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees. According
to Mrs. Alice Low, Dean of
Women, the decision on the
proposal and on the number
of women to be allowed to live
off campus is limited by ﬁnan-
cial considerations, not policy
or philosophy. The difficulty is
whether or not the college budg-
et can afford to lose the board
money in order to relieve uver<
crowding in the quad.

first week alter spring hreeir.
Dean Low feels that the we-
men will bo chosen by lottern
from the names of those ap-
plying if the number of op-
plicants is more than the Board
of Trustees recommends.

The problem of representas
tion of the off-campus women
on the AWS Board came up
at last Monday's board meeo
ing. a twelfth board'membee
was elected by the South cam-
pus dwellers. If the proposal
does not go into effect, onq
of the present board members
will be forced to step down.
Karen Lauterbach has several
tentative plans for handling
this problem it it should arise,
but she ieels optimistic about
the proposai’s chances.

Applications stating a desirq
to move off-campus, and the
reasons for this move, (and
written parental permission it
necessary) are to be addressed
to the Dean of women. Ape
plicants are not eligible tor

not find an apartment by the
end of the spring semester,
she will then have to pick from
the remaining rooms in the

“Whither goest the C of HP?"
the interviewer asked.

“To Involvement via-Com-
munication," answered Bill Flig-
eltaub, with fin optimism char-
acteristic of C of HP President
Elects.

Queried as to the nature of
this land of Involvement the
new student ”
leader indicat— ‘
ed that, “In-
volve m e n t
doesn't neces-
sorily mean
activity such
as attendance

ings or other

ties, but means keeping the stu~
dents aware of what student
leaders and groups on campus
are doing and keeping them bet-
ter prepared to respond to
campus ideas and proposals."

To foster the Information flow
necessary for student response
to ideas and events, Fligeltaub
intends to implement a four-
point communication program:
(I) The reorganization of u
Council of Hall Vice Presidents
that would meet with resident
advisors to exchange ideas on

problems of common concenu
especially those relating to
freshmen adjustment.

(2) The establishment of reg-
ular meetings between ho
councils and the newly propo
campus Judicial Council to help
clarify issues concerning rule em
forcement.

(a) The Encouragement 0!
house president: to adequately
inform their halls of campuJ
issues. (4) The continuation n!
the process of increased coupon-
ation of the C of HP and till
AWS Board,

On substantive questions, Flig-
eltaub feels that the issue of st
dent privacy should be deal
with through the formation of I
student open dorms committed
that would gather visitation pro.
gram information from othel
campuses and then make ro-
commendations to student lead-
ers. After general campus dice
cussion on the question, the lead-
ers would present a set of “rea-
listic proposals" to the iaculm
and administration.

In regard to rule eniorcemeﬁ,
Fligeltaub contends that a dell:
rlite C of HP enforcement polio]
is contingent upon the clariﬁca-
Lion of the role of a Judicial
Council and of its disc'mlinarl
policies.
