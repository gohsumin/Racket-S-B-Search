OVER 90 DEMONSTRATORS kept nearly—silent vigil outside the Science Lecture Room yesterday
when members or the Faculty Senate came there at 4 pm. to consider a resolution temporarily
banning military recruiting on campus. or protessors like Alan Jones, center, went in, students
lining the corridor walls singleille gave them copies oi a mimeographed rationale tor their protest.
“We hope our presence will reflect our concern . . . Our action is one of concern, not coercion.”

Protestors dispersed atter the leculty meeting began, carrying away signs like the one above

Last week the Cofl‘ passed a resolution against recruiting which comes to an all-campus relen-
lndum today. Marine recruiters, whose scheduled Jan. 26 visit was cancelled by President Leggett
— will come to Grhmell Monday. The USMC is the last recruiting session at any agency or corpor-
ation to he held this year. Although placement director Nick Ryan expects “little disturbance.”
SDS members are expected to protest against the Marines. Many oi them have made appointment:
with the Marines and wlll harangue them instead oi asking about career uppornmities. The leculty
reached no conclusion yesterday after two hours of discussion; another meeting is scheduled for this

Monday, April 3. in support at

He spoke at a large church,
Mason Temple, not far irom

eerie feeling in the audience oi
about a thousand as the light-
ning highlighted his silhouette
and the thunder underlined his
emotion. He was nearly in
tears when he said, “I still
have a dream!" crying out for
brotherhood and the recogni-
tion or equality.

And then King, under a yel-
low neon cross marked “SUN-
SHINE HAND,” stopped lust
dreaming. He said soberly that

Leggeﬂ “MississiBEi' Is Still Part of the U S '
AGM MEETS IN MISS, STIRS CONTROVERSY HERE

By NEIL FISCHER

Longfellow House, in Pasca-
goula, Miss, is a lormer ante<
bellum plantation and now a

h hotel-motel. It has swim-

‘ng, tennis, quaint suites or
rooms and a legend that goes
with than Poet Henry Wads<
Worth Longfellow is said ti)
have spent a summer there
writing “The Building of the
Ship" while looking out on
Pascagoula Bay.

The hotel-motel and cooler-
tnce center is nominally open
on everyone. Actually, it dis-
courages Negot- guests.

Prcndent Glen Leggett re-
turned from the Gulf Coast re-
sort Sunday, and his visit to
Mississippi provoked surrepti-
tious but nonetheless hu'ious
controversy on campus her.
during the rat or the week.

leggett met Monday with
Professor Dennis do Coteeu
(Music) and visiting septist
chaplain at Harvard Ed Wright
—a iormer ministerial intern
It Grinnell.

At the meeting in Leggett's
hurling basement office, Wright
and de Coteau reportedly told
Leggett they didn't think his
trip to Pascagoula “was a very
good idea at all.”

The President went to the
Mississippi resort. to attend a
meeting or the Associated Col~
[ages of the Midwest (ACM)
board of directors, and was at
hongfellow House when news
or Dr. Martin Luther King's
ssassinotion reached the pub-
c.

At the Monday morning meet-
lng. de Coteau questioned the
choice oi Mississippi as an ap-
propriate site to: an ACM
meeting. uay definition," ho
told the 55:13, “the ACM in-
cludes only Midwestern colleges
- and oeﬂahly no college in
lliisslsslppi.”

Leggett told the 5&3 Wednes
day that the meeting was staged
in Pascagoula at the request
of Miller Upton, chairman DI
the ACM board and president
DI Beloit College (Wis), “who
grew up around those parts.”

MEETING PLANNED
BEFORE ASSASSINATION

Upton, a 1933 graduate of
Tulane University, was born
in New Orleans, La.——some 100
miles east at Pascagoula. The
Beloit president could not be
reached this week, but his
secretary, Mrs. Dorothy Knies
tutor-med the son:

"I don't know it he's ever been
there (Pascagnula), but nohody
around his office ever heard
him speak or the place until
the meeting was called there.”

Sumner Hayward, newly
chosen head of ACM, said
Thursday that the meeting in
Mississippi had been planned
as early as January.

“It was nothing more than
I coincidence," he said, “lhlt
we were there at the lime DI
Rev. King’s death — nothing
more than that."

Hayward said the ACM direc-
tors otten meet outside or the
Midwestern United States.

The last. meeting was held in
Minneapolis, Minn.

A previous meeting or the
ACM was held at Arlie House,
Washintoii, D, C., Leggcit said.

Arlie House made national
news earlier this year when
Washington 1 a w y e r William
Higgs investigated it and iuund
it to be tinanced and hugged
by The Central Intelligence
Agency.

WHITE STUDENTS QUOTED

De Coteau would not com-
ment on his meeting with Leg-
gett and Wright, he said Mon-
day night. He did add, how-

ever, tha “. . . many white
students—tint so much black
students; they didn't seem to
know that Leggett went to
Mississippi—have told me they
don't think Leggett should have
gone down there.”

It’s one thing, they say," do
Coteau continued, "for him to
vacation on the Gull Coast. But
it is quite another (or him—as
an official representative of
the College— to attend a meet-
ing all he way down In a state
noted for what Mississippi ta
noted for."

De Coteau explained he gath-
cred that while students think
Leggett should have boycotted
the ACM meeting.

LEGGETT HAS DIFFERENT
VIEW
“Like it or not," Leggett said
Tuesday, “Mississippi is 'li I
part of the United States."

“He (dc Coteau) told me he
didn't think it, my trip, was a
very good idea," Leggett ex-
plained. “M Wright seconded
his mom

”I said I didn't look it it that
Way,” Leggett added.

president Leggeit said he did-
n't think Longiellow House was
segregated and that he thought
there were some Negro guests
there during his stay.

None of the ACM members
present at the tour-day meeting,
which began last Thursday, were
Negroes. There are no ACM col-
leges, Leggett said, who have
Negro presidents.

[in 5&3 telephone inquiry to
Pascagoula Wednesday. found
that Longtellow House —- while
not actually violating the law —
was discriminatory.

“Are your iacilllies segregat-
M?’ Mrs. Betsy walker, assist.
ant manager, was asked.

Heavens know," she replied in
r iriendly, thick drawl.

“How many Negroes did you
have in residence at the time of
the ACM meeting?"

“None," she answered.

“Well. how many Negroes do
you have staying at Longfellow
House right now?"

“Well, none." she replied.

“How many Negro guests have
you had in the last four or ﬁve
months?’ the 5&3 asked.

“well, not very many . . . in
tact, none," the drawl went on,

“Why’s that?”

“Seventeen dollars I day Is
pretty steep tor most of them.”

ACM SMOCKED AT DEATH

Leggett said the ACM group
was “terribly shocked" when
they heard of Dri King's assas-
sination in Memphis. The pros
idem said he telephoned back
to Grinnell to suggat a mo-
morinl service be held Friday
on the mold.

"But," he said. "Dr. (Jo-
seph) Wall had already done
that."

Leggett had College Treasur-
er Donald Lamhie and Director
of Development James Avison
send telegrams to Mrs. King,
Randall Morgan (the Chicago
civil rights leader who was re-
sponsible ior Rev. King's visit
to campus in October), and
several congressmen — includ-
ing John Kyl, who represents
Grimell.

The telegram to (our cone
gressmen asked them to help
“report the civil rights bill
now under consideration out of
nominee."

The ACM directors occupied
twenty-four rooms at: Longfel-
low House for three or tour
days each. Rates at the hatch
motel start at 517.75 per day.

We could feel Dr. King there
smiling with people who were
silent, unarmed and yet equal

I saw Monday a power in de-

There was not one arrest or
