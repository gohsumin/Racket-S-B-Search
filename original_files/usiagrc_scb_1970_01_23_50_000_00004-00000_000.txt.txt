VISTA Needs

Volunteers
For Program

“If you‘re not part of the
solution, you’re part of the
problem." These are the by
words of VISTA, (Volunteers in
Service to America). Volunteers
serving with VISTA help to
counter the ignorance, apathy
and prejudice which have histori-
cally dominated the poor in this
country. Volunteers serve
throughout the United States and
its territories, working in the
heart of decaying urban ghettos
or in the depression and misery
of poverty found in rural areas,
Indian reservations, and migrant
camps. VISTA workers work
long, hard hours with these
people. Their job is a simple one
— find out what the poor want
and need most and try to respond.

VISTA workers are volunteers
for one year. That isn’t a very
long time. They can’t expect to
solve the problems for the poor
in that time, but maybe they can
help the disadvantaged find ways

Social Coordinator
Calls for Use
Of Coffee House

”A college is only as good as
its coffee house.”Anon.

The forum coffee house has
gone unused for too long. At
present, it is only used as a place
to sit when all the tables in the
grill are being used. The very
term “coffee house” should
conjure up visions of good food,
music, decor, and discussion. Our
coffeehouse has all the faults
that seem to go hand in hand
with institutional architecture,
such as uncomfortable furniture,
poor lighting, and cement walls
that defy one to put up posters
and bulletin boards.

The time has come for the
students to convince the powers
that be to repair the espresso
Coffeemaker and allow pastries
or sandwiches to be sold. There
is money available for bringing
in entertainment, putting up
bulletin boards, and buying a
record player.

The social coordinating
committee is looking for students
who are interested in forming a
committee that can, hopefully,
turn the coffee-house into the
center of campus activity that it
should be. If you are interested,
drop a note in P0, box 1059.

Friends of Margaret T. Kuzell
will be sad to learn that she died
last August 15, 1969, from injuries
received in an automobile ac-
cident just outside Johannesburg,
South Africa, where she had gone
on a summer job.

Margaret was a student here
from September 1966 to January
1968. Her parents, Colonel and

Besides, the poor will never be
able to stand alone as equals if

VISTA helps the less advantaged
help themselves. That's what it’s
all about. VISTA isn’t another
giveaway program, another
handout. The only handout in-
volved is the hand extended from

Republicans Plan ‘Action’

Last Sunday eleven leaders of
the Iowa College Republicans
met on the Grinnell campus to
lay plans for their January 30—31
conference in Des Moines and to
discuss their new community
action program, “Action Now.”

The conference will be held in
conjunction with an Iowa Repub—
lican Party “Mission 70" confer-
ence that same weekend. In a
letter to the College GOP chair-
men, Calvin Crane, Chairman of
the College Republicans of Iowa,
said that the purpose of the two
conferences is to launch the or»
ganizational and financial
campaigns [or this election year.
The theme of the College Repuir
lican conference is “Involvement
70.” Plans call for participants
to attend a session of the Iowa
Legislature on Friday and to
pdrticipate fully in the
Republican Party conference on
Saturday. In addition, discussion
groups on topics of special inter-
est to the College Republicans
will be arranged as time permits.

The “Action Now” program is
being directed by Phil Sasich, a
Grinnell College sophomore. Ac-
cording to Mr. Crane, the pro-
gram is to be twofold. First,
Community Action Centers Will
be established in various urban
areas to help improve living
conditions and to open up new
areas of opportunity for dis-

advantaged citizens. These
centers will act as clearing
houses for complaints from local
residents and will attempt to
bring problems to the attention
of government officials who can
help. A similar center has been
operating in the ghetto area of
Detroit for almost threeyears.
The other phase of the “Action
Now” program is to encourage
voluntary community action and
to stress the need for Republicans
to become involved in worthwhile
community projects. National
Republican headquarters will be
conducting an educational
program on the problems of drug
abuse, conservation and pol-
lution. “Local clubs will be asked
to begin projects to correct
whichever problem is more
prevalent in their area,” said
Crane. In a memo to iowa club
chairmen, Sasich asked that local
clubs consult community leaders
and service clubs in their locales

to determine what problems exist

locally and to coordinate their
efforts with local programs. Such
programs could keep College Re-
publicans usefully active be-
tween election years.

During 1970, local College
Republican clubs will be opening
Saturday offices in their com-
munities to coordinate the
“Action Now" programs, to
conduct surveys during the
campaign, and to answer
telephone questions from local
residents about campaign issues.

The ”Involvement 70" Conn
ference will help to organize the
various programs of the Iowa
College Republicans for the
coming year. The Grinnell club
will be sending representatives
to the conference. Details will be
discussed at the meeting next
Sunday evening.

AFROTC Seeks
Early Phasing Out

Tile AFROTC
has petitioned

unit at Grinnell
the college to
accelerate the phasing out of
their program at the college.
What follows is the text of Dean
Wall’s letter to Colonel Steger
notifying him of the Executive
Committee's approval of the
program.

Colonel Jack M. Steger
Department of Aerospace Studies
Grinnell College

Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Colonel Steger:

This is to inform you officially
that both the Faculty Committee
on Academic Standing and the
Executive Council of the College
have approved of the proposal for
an acceleration of the phasing out
of the AFROTC Unit at Grinnell
College, to be effective by 1 Sep-
tember 1971.

This year's class of six
sophomore men now enrolled in
the program, in order to com-
plete the academic requirements
to be commissioned as officers
in the United States Air Force
at the time of their graduation
in May 1971, will have to take
6 hours credit in Aerospace
Studies during the academic year
1970771. The Committee on
Academic Standing gave serious
consideration to these men to
facilitate their completing the
academic requirements of the
program during their junior
year, including petitions for over-
loads and for counting the Aero—
space Studies program as meet
ing their upperclass secondary
field requirement if the cadets
so wish. The Executive Council
has approved of the Committee’s
suggestions.

We shall await further word
from you regarding the phasing
out program.

Sincerely,
Joseph F. Wall
Dean of the College
