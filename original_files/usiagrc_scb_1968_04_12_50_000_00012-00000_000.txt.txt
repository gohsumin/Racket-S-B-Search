BARASCH, PARSELL
FACE DEFERMENT LOSS

' Four Grinnell faculty mem-
bers have been reclassiﬁed LA
in the wake of the selective
service’s crack—down on oc-
cupational deferments.

Mr. David B. Parsell, French
instructor, was reclassified l-A
March 25th.

Mr. Delmar Pettys, music
lecturer and member of the
{cum Quartet, was reclassified
‘ last summer. No action
has been taken since then.

Mr. Stephen H. liarasch, Rus-
slan instructor, was reclassi-
hed LA at the end of March.

Mr. Neal A. Milner, political
science instructor, was reclas-
siﬁed l-A in March. However,

e is over 26 and expects to

changed back to ZeA in
April.

A spokesman no the Jasper
County Draft Board minimized
lie present danger. “They are
reclassifying them but they're
not taking them as yet,” the
lpokesman said. “i guess they
will if it becomes necessary}

“The decision is up to tho
'drait boards," said a spokes-
man at the state headquarters
of the Selective Service. The
National Advisory Committee
advised the Selective Service
that a consideration of the
present economy did not point
out a need for any essential
list of occupational deierments,
he explained.

“The number of potential
Inductees on the faculties is
small.” he said. “We don't
foresee any call for men over 26
Bnyway."

Pettys was told by his draft

DoiT DRUG
STATEMENT

On April iii the Committee
of Thirteen minus Debbie
Friedman, passed nnanlmously
a statement on campus drug
use.

It states that the College,
"must not restrict those free-
ihms of thought, association,
and action which are the pre~

uisites of . . . personal de-
yelopment."

ln the statcment they voiced

belief in a student's right
:3 be free from punishment by

the College for a civil offense,
f the offense does not contra-
him “the educational objectives
if the College."

They urged the College to (1)
refrain from taking action

against students or
lolely bemuse of “drug in-
yolvement." (2) “provide its.
cilities where students can seek

rofessional counseling or med-
ical attenLion without punitive
action." and (3) "protect the
rights of students from searches
without legal warrant, paid in-
formers, and legal invesﬁgntlvo
methods."

The Council urges students
In become more informed on
the effects of dnlgs. as well
Is on laws regulating their use,
Students need to ”accept the
responsibility for their actions
and realize that Grinnell Cola
loge cannot and will not pro-
lect the student from the con-
leouenCBS of use of illegal

Inna."

board that married men were
not being drafted. l-le antici-
pales a return to at 27A clas-
sificatioli.

Mr. Parsell also is married.

Barasch was surprised to be
reclassified since he is ma~
triculateo in a PhD program.
A PhD candidate is usually al—
lowed 5 years, he said, and
he is in his 4th year.

Other faculty members have
had past problems with the
dratt, Mr. George P. Zimmer,
psychology professor, was re-
classified for a short time last
year when he was 26. He was
reinstated, however, after ver-
ifying his teaching position.

One man was told by the
draft board secretary that his
employer (Grinnell College) had
been tardy in sending the nec-
essary statement to them. His
l-A classiﬁcation was given in
an attempt to speed the state
ment to the draft board.

Another reclassified gentle-
man delayed his induction a
year and one-half by showing
that the draft board only gave
8 seconds of consideration to
his case.

A well-w i s h e r complained,
“Guys aren't imaginative
enough to get out of the draft.
I Could do it easy if I had to.
They always say they couldn’t
pass as homosexuals They just
don’t want to, that's all."

when several green-fatigue clad
students entered the buck of
the auditorium with fife and
drum.

in formation and armed with
toy guns, they marched around

lued.

Then, suddenly, WHAM in tho
director's face.

If those involved were unia

lumbia administration, t h e y
will be “faced with immediate
disciplinary action, and if not
students, Columbia will lila

Cg? DADA

(Continued from Page 9)

their conversations. “This icy-
ous slavonic affirmative," says
Richter, “seemed wholly ap-
propriate, . . . .n powerful re-
iteration, ‘da,ila,' ‘yes,yes,‘ to
life."

The anti side of Dada is

much better known. Richter
says, “Our provocations, dema
onstrations, and defiances were
only a means at arousing the
bourgeoisie to rage, and through
rage to a shame-faced self-
awareness. Our real motive
force was not rowdiness, but
the question, basic as it is now,
‘wllat next?" Dada had a
"new artistic e t h l d (which
sometimes took) a positive,
sometimes a negative form, of-
ten appearing as art, and then
again as the negation of art,
at times deeply moral and at
other times totally amoral."
No wonder then that Dada had
no unified formal characteris-
tics like other styles have.

Shock was one of the faVa
or‘lte devices of anti-art Dada.
Works like Duchamp's Bicycle
Wheel had an instant impact
on the viewer~and that was the
end of it. Such pieces belong.
Richter says, in museums, not
galleries. Duchamp would
agree. The distinction is inter-
esting. A museum in for his-
torical relics, but a gallery,
Richter says, “is not there to
be walked through, even if
there are thousands of plc<
tures in them. . . They are
there for meditation—if only
that were still possiblel" Today
galleries are “offering the pub-
lic entertainment rather than
objects of contemplation, which
is what real works of m are.
1 still tblnk that one person
who meditates before I work
of art is worth more than
thousands who just gawk."

Richter notes that the museum
pieces of Duchamp and others
had their place. The bother is
that commercially successful
artists today (erroneously re-
ferred to as Neo-Dadaists) do
not understand that the recog-
nition of shock falls flat. Rich-
ter provides a devastating quo-
tation from Duchamp, "this New
Realism, Pop, assemblage, etc.
is on easy way out, . .when
I discovered ready-mades I
thought to discourage aesthet-
ics. . r they have taken my
rcady-mades and found aes<
thetic beauty in them. I threw
the bottle-rack and the urinal
in their races as a challenge
and now they admire them for
their aesthetic beauty."

The question of why nudia
ences clamor for coke-bottle
and comicastn'p “art" is an in-
teresting one. Richter concludes
that it is a peculiarly American
phenomenon. He quotes Huel-
senback, who laments that the
tools of Dada are being used
by “sensationvhungry galleries
eager for business." Richter
odds, “Art in this xero form has
taken on n . . . soda-psych»
logic-l mooning, no longer
transcendental, but therapeu-
tic.” Such an give: in to and
reﬂects n sick, sterile, society.
It assumes we are mi! of con-
trol of our lives, that “we are
lncapable of altering a hope-
less situation.”

This cynicism is precisely
what Movement artists are

“Let Me Entertain You" should be the theme of the coming
week here on our campus for as it shall become obvious we are

ture series, Six student productions in Arena. the ilairing Skirts
of whirling folk dancers, an excellent selection ol movies and the
mock cOnVemionS scheduled for next Thursday and Friday.

The Museum as Tastemaker in Contemporary Art is the theme
of Grinnell Weekend which began yesterday with lectures on “Art

there are contemporary paintings from India, sculpture, and
various new acquisitions to the Grinnell Permanent Collection on

sion to Wait Until Dark for 50 cents and your activity ticket. 0n

challenging today, with their
lives as well as their art. They
are searching for art forms that
provoke awareness and contrlb<
ute to a revolutionary con-
sciousness. It is these artists
who are the true descendants
ot the pro-life strain of Dada.
In poetry there is Will lnman,
who publishes the poetry maga~
zine Kauri, a beautiful, pain-
ful outpouring of hon<
esty from lnman himself as
well as many other poets.

And there is El Corno Ema
plumado (the Piumed Horn),
the magnificent journal of po-
etry, prose and art, in both
Spanish and English, published
in Mexico by Sergio Mandra-
gon and Margaret Randall (a
superb example of revolutionary
nrt appears in the January is-
sue; it is a poem for Che
Guevara, “Che Comandante,"

by the great Cuban poet Nicolas
Guillcn). There are great signs
at lite in meater, particularly
Peter Schumann's Bread and
Puppet Theater in New York,
a sensitive and powerful group.
Certainly they fulfill Richter's
concept of transcendental and
socially-relevant art.

Even in Washington, D. (I.
there is the American Play-
ground which looks promising,
particularly now that it has a
music director, the young com-
poser James Stepleton, whose
best work surpasses dint of
Kurt Weill. Richter does not
mum these artists, or Ken-
neth Patchen, or even Allen
Glmberg and the rest of the
old San Francisco Renaissance.
But it will be clear to Moves
ment readers a! Richler's book
that yea-saying Dad-ists were
thes- artlsts' lnlecedenu.
