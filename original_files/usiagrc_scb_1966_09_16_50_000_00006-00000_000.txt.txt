. . . NSA Possibilities Aired

(Continued from Page 1)

marks with the announcement
that this will be his third and
last year as faculty adviser to
the Senate. He began on an 6114
couraging note: “I would like to
begin by assuring you that the
decision to retain the Senate as
a legislative body or SGA was a
wise one.” Kurtz said he felt
that the Senate is deﬁnitely an
“appropriate arm oi sea."

In appraising the potential of
the Senate, KuI'tz set forth three
ambitious objectives.

He began by calling for “ar-
ticnlate, manageable" discus

sion groups on campus, saying
that the Senate should serve to
stimulate interest in such
groups. Kut'tz feels it is impop
tant, however, that these dis
cussion groups deal wnh proh-
lems out of the classroom Con<
text.

lll addition to stimulating
discussion, the Senate must
maintain a constructive critical
role on campus. Kurtz ventured
that it is even legitimate tor a
body such as the Senate to be
Critical of the faculty when
there is 21 need for such criti-
msrn. He said it is even more
important to be critical of the

college as a whole -— particu<
larly the way the college “artic-
ulates its aims and purposes."
He went on to praise the con-
cept of the encampment.

Finally, it is crucial that the
Senate help to maintain the
tt‘adItIon of a “social co n.
science.” Kurtz mentioned the
possibility or projects in the
realm or social problems, cit-
ing mental health as one ex.
ample.

In line with Kurtz’s last sug-
gestion, Phil Bertenthal, senator
from North Younker and this
year's National Student Associas
tion coordinator, mapped out
plans for revitalizing the role of
NSA on the Grinnell campus.
Bertenthal reported that there
are tederal workstudy grants
available from the government
for work in off-campus projects.
He mentioned Tama. the Bot.
toms ared in Des Moines, and
work along the lines of Uncle
Sam's Club as several possibili-
ties,

The prospect or getting dele-
gations or foreign students to
visit Grinnell is another area in
which NSA could be helpiul.
Bertenihal said,

In response to a proposal by
Bertenthal. the Senate passed a
resolution to form a committee
that will work with the NSA co-
ordinator in developing ideas in
the realm of public affairs.
