Faculty Votes Hot To Vote; Debate To Continue

(continued from page 1)
clares a major.

2. That the faculty shouldap—
prove of a Freshman Year
Committee consisting of the
Dean of the College; faculty
and student members, which
would supervise the tutorial
program’s development and
execution, draw up a list of
faculty members tobe recom-
mended as tutors, disseminate
to the faculty such suggest-
ions for new programs for the
freshman year as it would in-
itiate or receive from studs
ents or faculty, and supervise
the Underclass Academic Ad-
vising program.

3, That the faculty express
support for the continuation of
existing freshman year coure
ses in the humanities, social
studies and science, or the
development ‘of new courses,
which would be available to
freshmen on anelective basis.

The debate which ensued res
capitulated earlier meetings
in ranging from the technical
to the demunciatory to the es-
chatological.

Faculty secretary Valentine
rose to make some general
remarks about the quality of
the previous debate, which be
termed “careless". Valentine
termed the faculty’s consid*

eration of its own legislation
”far from complete."The Hut
manities Divisions 1572 bloc
v0te for retention of the re
quired Humanities coursewas
not noted once in the debate,
he said, accusing the faculty
of taking depart-mental and
divisional interests as para-
mount in consideration of the
proposed reforms.

According with the maxim
that the time had come to
act, the faculty voted to
consider provision (2d), wh-
ich Mr. Worley then pro-
posed to amend to the ex~
tent that the proposed Fre
eshman year committee
have sovereignty over all
required courses, regard-
less of which year they may
be given.

Mr. Cleaver noted that this
would make little sense were
the lst provision (to estab~
lish the tutorial program) not
to pass.

Hence the faculty decided to
consider provision 1.

However, it was then sugges~
ted that no one would vote on
provision 1 unless the imple-
mentary procedures were
esmblished.

So the faculty voted to cont
sider provisions 1 and 2.

some length, reminding the
faculty rather pointedly that
more of these proposals c0“.
Id be effective without a firm
committment from the faculty
that they work. Further, he
noted, a study of course pop-
ulations at the 100-200 level
as compared to the 3004100
level had shown that faculty
must be willing to give up the
occasional upperelevel sem-
inar to implement the tutorial
program. Moreover, he felt
that faculty would have to ch-
ange the orientation of their
introductory courses; court
ses which he characterized
as offered frequently at "a
high school level.

With a general confusion abs
road as to just whatthe guide-
lines would be--how confin-
ing, how instructivewan at»
tempt was made to call the
question; to bring the original
motion of Wall's to a vote.
The call was voted down, and,
in two tries, the faculty voted
to adjourn.

In voting not to vote the fac-
ulty has extended debate on
the new package of nOtrequ~
irementsrbut-lutorlal hum-
anities and an improved in-
troductory curriculum for
two, maybe three weeks. The
meetings are still open (oh
joyl) to students, and every
minute of two hours long, ste
arting at four o'clock Monday
evening. It is worthnotingthat
the faculty senate has consis-
tently evidenced sincere and
categorical unanimityas to the
time of day.

Man often ﬂaunts his power

Despite all the preparations
that went into the Community

of the man made plans.

the recommendations were
cast aside as the Senate den
bated several motions to re
lower or redistribute the sale
ary money. Finally a motion
by Senator Kit Cage to equals
ize the salaries of the four
members of the SGA execu~
rive board gained support. The
debate dragged on until the
closing minutes of [hemeetr
ing, when Andy Loewi, with a
nervous glance at his watch,
made a briefspeechinsupport
of the motion with some dubs
ious logic about "enhancing
the position of the halls." At
two minutes until twelve o'cl-
ock the Senate then passed
Gage's motion and equalized
the salaries of the Student
Coordinator, SGA President,
C of HP President, and AWS
President at $400 apiece.
