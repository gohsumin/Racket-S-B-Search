PPPE Book Announced

nespoiiers of Democracy by
Clark Mollenhotf has been chosen
as the Program in Practical Po-
litical Education’s Book of the
Month ror April. The book con-

vestigations that have made head-
lines during the past few years.

Mollenlioif, rather a latter-day
miickraker, is concerned about
the extent of decay in American
democracy but “what makes Mr.
Mollenhoff's thesis so surprising
is the picture it reveals or high-
and middle - level collusion,
wrong-headedness, colossal arrow
gaiice, and sometimes shocking
Corruption.” The “characters” ofi
the book are Billie Sol Estes, Sec-
retary or Delense McNamara,
Bobby Baker (and Carol Tyler
and Ellie Rometscll), Otto Otepka,
Under-Secretary oi Delense Ros-
well Gilpatric, Navy Secretary
Fred Korth, and Senator John Wil-
liams —- all no doubt dear to the
hearts of those in PPPE.

Copies of the book may be ob-
tained from William Vandcrpool
(speech and theater).

Exec. (ouncil Proposes Frosli Hulls,
Room Brown 5, Rule Enforcement

Ed. Note: Following is the list of proposals
that the Executive Council handed over to the
ad huc committee on hall reorganization, The
recommendations are only suggestions and will
not necessarily go into effect. Joseph Wall
(history), a member of the executive council.
pointed out that the ad hoc Committee will
carefully scrutinize the list of proposals and
is under no obligation to adopt them.

L The Setting Up of Freshman halls,

We recommend that freshman halls be or-
ganized on both North and South Campus.
Each freshman hall would be under the su-
pervision of an adult resident who would be
a representative of the student dean. Juniors
and seniors, selected by the college, would
live in the freshman halls and act as Coun<
selors; each iipperclasmen given that func-
tion would be responsible for 8 to in students,
and Wmlld be remunérated for his work.

The uppei-class counselors, under the su-
pel‘vision of the adult residents, would be i
sponslble [or rule enforcement. One can
selor in each hall would be selected by the
student dean to act as pi‘esulent of the hall;
this counselor would sit on the CofI-lP or
the AWS Board. and would appomt other
counselors to hall offices

2. Assignment to Uppei-class Halls

Students would be assigned to uppei-class
halls by the student deans at the end of the
fieshman year. The student deans would en-
deavor to honor requests at groups (oi ironi
Z to 8 students each) who wish to enter the
some upperclass hall, to the degree to which
circumstances permit.

3. structure at Upperclass Halls.

Tile Council suggests two possible alterna-
tive plans, both of which have met with sup-
port:

Version A:

The present hail system would coniiiuie,
both on North and South Campus. Greater
mobility would be encouraged, though not en-
forced, on North Campus. Some provisions
would be made to allow groups of from 2 to
3 upperclassmen who wish to join together in
one hall to do so, subject to the approval or
the student dean.

The rollowing changes are recommended
for North Campus hall government: The gov-
erning committee of each hall would consist
of a President and Vice President plus a
number nf members named by the hall pi'esh
(lent (in the manner of South Campus “Baf-
ﬂeboartl”). This committee would be re-
sponsible for rule enforcement, and would
meet regularly with the adult resident of the
hall for Consultation and advice,

Other oliicers may be elected by the ball
(as for example a social chairman and ilitra<
murals chairman), but would not form part
of this committee. Adult head residents liv-
ing in the ’halls would endeavor to make
themselvesavatlable to advise the governing
body of the hall and to give it needed sup-
port.

Version B:

Room drawings would be held each year
on North and South Campus. Students would
thus rotate among the halls; hall presidents
would be elected at: large on both campuses
Other hall Officers would be named and elect<
ed in accord with the procedures now preval-
ent on South Campus

Men's halls would be governed by com-
mittees such as those described ln version A.
Some provisions would be made to allow
groups of students to join together and be
placed in the same hall; these groups would
not exceed 3 students each, and their place
merit would be made subject to the availa-
hility of accommodations and to the approval
of the student deans.

4. Provisions for Certain Upperclass students.

The Council hopes that some special pro-
visions may be made for senior and junior
students who wish to form interest groups.
or have in mind worthwhile residence ar-
rangements which ditier irom the present
residence hall structure. Such provisions
inigiit include housing of groups of men or
groups of women in college houses (such as
1127 Park and the White House), the use of
wings oi dormitories for interest groups, or
the use of off-campus housing. it would be
understood, or course. that any such plans
would be subject to limitations based on the
availability oi space and the need of using
available space; they may also require the
moving of some other students in order to ac-
commodate interest groups.

it is also hoped that the provisions allow-
ing groups oi up to 3 students to enter the
same hall (No 2) or to stay together (No. 313),
will encourage the formation of interest
"groups.” Any specific and rigid attempt to
plan for “interest groups” seems unfeaSible
at the present time, given the uncertainty as
it) how much desire there exists for this kind
of arrangement. This issue, however, should
be given continued attention: it is hoped that
moves in the direction of “interest groups"
will lead to an improvement in the intellec—
tual climate of the campus.

5 Student government

We recommend that the functions of the
student senate as presently defined in iesi»
device liall government be taken over by the
AWS Board and Coil-lP, sitting jointly.

The AWS Board and the CofHP, sitting
as committees and dispensing with the pres-
eni trial procedure used in the pri ‘
courts, should take over the responslb
of the present primary courts. '

The present Student High Court. the Facul-
ty Committee on Student Affairs, and the
Dean's Committee would function as at pres—
ent. Some pmVlslon should be made for the
automatic review by the Dean’s Committee
of all cases handled by student Courts.

Gl Other Matters

Every effort should be made to provide
increased study and recreational space in the
residence halls. Adult head residents should
be employed ior uppei-class halls; their role
would be advisory rather than disciplinary,
but they would make themselves available to
hall presidents and committees and aid in
rule enforcement when called upon.

The role of faculty advisers to freshmen
and sophomores needs to be studied and de-
lined. in particular, more effort and stress
needs to be placed on the advising of sopho—
mores, who are all too often forgotten at the
time at which they are making crucial der
cisions. (Presence ot academically interested
adult head residents in the halls may to some
degree alleviate the problem.)
