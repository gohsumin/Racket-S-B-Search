teachers and by several states
ioi- granting teaching certifi-
cates or licenses.

During the full-day testing
sessron, iuture teachers may
take the common examination,
testing their proiessional knowla
edge and general educational

ternships were in the office

Art Gallery Otters
Show by Talented
Parisian Children

By Ann ‘Showalter

“Close to German expres-
sionism in regard to What they
see in nature and in mature
artists’ responses to nature,”
said Robert w. McMillan (art)
of the painters whose works
are currently on exhibit in the
Schaefier Gallery of the Fine
Arts Building.

The paintings, by Parlsian
school children aged nine to
sixteen, are "crentivn and
free, yet controlled."
McMillan commented that
the paintings seem to show the
Parisian art teachers’ skill at
stimulating and guiding the
children’s freshness of response
to the world.

”This exhibit is not simply a
display of talent, but a display
of the potential which exists in
any group of children and in
adults,” he explained.

One of the problems at art
instructors of all educational
levels is trying to tree their
students from preconceived
ideas of what art should be
and from succumbing to
“someone else‘s sense of or-
der.”

In recent years the philos-
ophy of art instruction has been
changing. Formerly, it was
thought to be most important
to teach the child how to
“draw,” to describe accurately
the things he saw.

“Now art instruction tends
more toward description by
analogy than Strict analytical
d e s c r i p t i o n,“ McMillan
statedaThus, instead or paint-
ing a wateriall exactly as he
sees it, the artist may try to
capture the force behind the
waterfall.

McMillan noted that in
France, as in the United States,
the quality of art education
varies considerably from one
school to another. The current
exhibition is an example of
sophisticated art education
techniques used in the public
schools of Paris.

The paintings of people, still
life, and the Parisian landscape
are being circulated in this
country by the French Em-
bassy.

SCARLET AND BLACK

) Gregg Singers
Continued from Page 1

And then, the.versatile Gregg
Smith Singers followed with
Bach's Motet No. 6, establish-
ing a tradition which even now
characterizes every concert
appearance. R a r e l y , heard-
works of contemporary or early
composers are always balanced
with the classic choral works
and the music of America, tra-
ditionally folk. ‘

That same year, the Gregg
Smith Singers took their first
steps to international recog-
nition with a tour of Europe
that began with their spon-
taneous decision to partici-
pate in the International
Eistedfodd, a centuries-old
choral folk singing competi-
tion held in Wales. Here the
singers presented to continen-
tal music lovers the rich folk
music of our country. An in-
vitation for the group to sing
at the Brussels World Fair
and other concerts followed.

Twentyrﬁve young students,
musiCians, and composers piled
into a chartered bus headed for
New York, On the way they
sang in such widely divergent
U. S. Communities as David
City, Nebraska; Zion National
Park, and Chicago, Illinois.
Then they enplaned for London.
In six weeks they gave concerts
in Wales, France, Italy, Ger
many (including the Mozart-
eum in Salzburg), and Brus-
sels, Belgium.

third time they have been iii-
vited back to appear in
Europe's famous music festi-
vals, including those at Edin-
burgh, Saizburg, Darmstadt’s
Contemporary Music Festi-
val, Kreield, and Berlin.

Almost twosthirds oi the orig
inal Gregg Smith Singers are
still with the choral groupr
Their ages averages between
25 and 26. Every one of the
singers is a graduate of music
from universities or colleges in
Southern California, and a pms
fessional musician, with many

of the group’s singers doubling
as instrumentalists.

An unusual facet of the
group's personality is the pres-
ence of so many composers and
conductors in the membership
At least half a dozen Gregg
Smith Singers have had their
works published or performed,
Several are conductors of their
own church choirs. Smith, B.
composer . conductor himself,
attributes the interest of the
Gregg Smith Singers in new
music to thissfunusual back-
ground.
