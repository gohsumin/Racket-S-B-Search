SCARLET AND BLACK

Can We Really Afford ﬁtness?

By .ioiiti Nigel Pepper

those of you who saw
"lliglischoal." and those of you
ulitt have listened to Allan
Nasser. those ot you who have
read about it and thought about
it slime. will probably realize this
hy iimv. Tite business of
education depends upon and is
itself a part oi the acculturation
process Which means that
education depends upon a degree
or cultural itttegrationto make it
both useful and worthwhile.
Society requires a degree of.
utility tor even its modest eons
tribtition to higher educatiott. and
cultural integration is in
strumeittal to this usefulness.
Furthermore, the tltings which a
liliei‘al education teaches us to
enjoy and to seek are culturally
dclilled, and hence capable of
being otherwise in different cirr
cumslances, and hence not
strictly rational in the
Art oteliansense.

'lliis college has deemed it its
business to provide those things

sums oi money ior resident

This provision or opportunities is

and worthwhile lives,

The paradox or our doing this
at the expense ol the Boo
workers employed at this college
has been pottttcd otit olt cit enough

to have tic-come a truism by now,
so there is hardly any need to
beluhttl' it further. What seems

individual status is as uncertain

or placing an even heavier
burden on the parents who can

There is a corollary to the
above type of aC|IVity, Physical
Education is an example of this.
The college outlay for the

Now why is this money spent7
it is spent because it is a Good
idea. a platitude. in iaet,"tltat
people here be Physically Fit,
and hence it is made a Re-
quiremelil that people here be
Physically Fit, insofar as this can
be decreed. It being thus
required. the college takes the
“liberal" position that the
student he allowed to iuliill it in
a variety or ways. And offering
40 or 50 P. E. courses a year
requires a healthy number or
Instructors, This. friends. is an
object lesson in the creation of
bureaucracy with real and vested
interests in the variety'ol courses
and in the requirements which
fostertt.

The tact is that, quite apart
from the question or to what
extent the President and Deans
ti.e. "the Administration") are
competent tojudge such matters
and entitled to dispose ol large
