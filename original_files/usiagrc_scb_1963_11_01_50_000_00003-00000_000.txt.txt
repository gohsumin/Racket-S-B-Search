Encampment: Promote 'Image

By Ellen Pearce l

Gi-iniiclls reputation
should be an area of concern he 1
cause it detelmines the qualityl
of iaculty that it draws. the
quality of students it attracts,
and the future of its graduates

The following is a summary ,
of the Encampment report by
the Committee on the Grinnell
Image, and all or its ideas and
implications should he considr
ered in the iollowing context.
“We decided that it was nec- ,
essary to put ourselves into
an historical context or chang-
ing niorcs. Thus, in areas re-
lating to the progress in aca-
demic freedom at Grinncll,
where there is deﬁnite criteria
by which to judge, giant
strides can be made without
fear of alienating our ‘Publics.’
However, in marginal or ques- ,
tionable areas, such as social
liberalization, there was some
disagreement over the relative
expedience oi proceeding care
tully, to maintain our reputar
tion versus a continuous striv-
ing to maintain a program
consistent with our liberal and
progressive ideas and philosA
opliy."

The image was deﬁned by:
such synonyms as reﬂection, r-ep-.
rescntation and reputation, andl
the “Public's” tormation ot ourl
image was deﬁned as hearsayi
or. by, and about students, par-‘
ents, friends, alumni; the college
itself; its sports, awards. grants.

publications; and national rat-
ings and surveys.

Grinnell’s status as a private
ly endowed institution also was
thought to give the school a
“great deal more independence"
but at the same time “a more
diversiﬁed public to serve and
satisfy,"

In

l

considering Gl‘innell’s l

reputation in Iowa, the com. '

mittee presented a picture of
a school with an “eastern na—
vor" oi progressivencss set in
a conservative inidwest atmos-
phere resulting in “an extreme

institution that is socially lax.n 1‘

The committee reported the
alumni recliags as ”over-
hear-d lntellectually, w i t h o u t
enough emphasis on char-actor
building " This then concerns ad,
missions standards and empha—
sis on academic achievement on
campus.

Our

“parental public" is a
little worried about murals oli‘
campus, feeling that too much‘
social freedom may exist,”

Thc students retlccted three
areas of concern. The ﬁrst was
the view that the Grrnncll cams.
pus is unreal and isolated. The
problem rests in creating a sense
or community conducive to in-
tellectual pursuits and charactcl‘i
