large, rose covered track shoe),
the rest or us were bowled over by
the sheer majesty of the event. I
was also a member of the only
Grinnell team to mount the
Winner’s platiorm, after having
beaten a team or eight-milers in a
Mil-yard relay.

This year was not the same, it
was rainy, the crowd consisted oi
mostly ex-coaches, starters, etc.
The convertible parade was
rained out, and a poor day was
had by all Grinnell runners with
the exception of Phil Murales,
who placed third in the mile.

Neither wind, nor rain, nor house president elections, nor
B and G strikes could keep lM softball from reaching the halfway
point of the season this week. This actually was a pretty good
woek in 1M5 as far as quality of play and the sociologists could

probably do a study as to why.

Cowles got fine relief pitching

it wasn‘t enough, That same

Dibble. Two great plays in

 

this one — Tommie Gillespie
slammed one over the Ward
Field grandstand for a homer.
Quite a hit, and I haven't
heard of any one else ever do-

he speared a line drive, stepped
on second, and then fired to
Pooh Milliken at first for three
outs. Loose won its first, top-

Penzner. North dropped Cowles
