PROTESTS OPEN LIBRARY?
UP TO LEGGETT

By DON HECKER

Two weeks ago, Larry Frallk
made an appointment to meet
with President Leggett about
keeping the college library open
until 1 a.n1.

Thursday morning last Frank
went in to see Leggett’s secrea
tary about the appointment.
The secretary said she had none
listed and didn‘t know if one
were planned.

Said Frank: “I don’t quite
know how to say this, but un-
less there is some evidence of
progress, the demonstrations
will start again this evening."

The meeting was held that al-
temOOll.

Attending were Frank, David
Swee (of the committee that
held last semester’s library
demonstrations), Ric MacDowell
(SGA President), Pmi. Arnold
Adeiburg (Judicial Council
Chairman), and Dean 5. Eugene
Thompson.

Leggett lirst reviewed the let-
ter sent to him on the third
day of demonstrations. The leta
ter, which urged that the library
be left open until l mm, (with
the circulation desk Closing at
11:30 p.m,), indicated that AWS
Board and C oi HP members
had volunteered tn serve with—
out pay after 11:30 until help
could be found.

It also referred to an earlier

petition, signed by over two stu<
dents. which also requested
longer library hours.

After expressing disappoint—
ment that demonstrations had
been held before the Faculty Li-
brary Committee made an otil-
cial recommendation, Leggett
promised he would turn the is-
sue over to the Student Aliairs
Committee, and to have an an-
swer on the question by Febr»
uary 1.

The 8&3 learned Thursday
from Prof. John Burma (Stu-
dent Affairs Committee Chair-
man) that the committee would
officially recommend to the
President that the library he
lett open until one o’clock.

Frank became concerned late
last semester when he learned
iron-l an SGA oiiicial about a
week before iinals that the li-
brary committee had taken no
official action, but had unoffi-
cially decided not to leave the
library open until 1 a.m.

He talked to John Wiles and
Rio MacDowell, MacDowell told
him: “I didn‘t think it (demon-
strations) would be entirely de-
trimental.”

An Ad Hoc committee of
Frank, David Swee and John
Wiles was termed. “We had no
idea the (library) committee
was doing nothing," Frank ex.

SCARLET AND BLACK

plained. “We wanted to express
our disappointment through the
demonstrations.”

The demonstrations began the
Sunday night beiore finals last
semester. Along with the demon-
strators were several sympathi-
zers who had been studying and
did not leave at the library’s
regular closing hour. Frank esti-
mated about 30 students welo
involved the first night.

Dean Thompson arrived and
demanded that the demonstra-
tors “get the Hell out of here.”

Frank replied that they would
not do this. Thompson then sat
down and wrote out a statement
that the demonstrators had
been told to leave and had re-
(used.

He presented this to Frank to
sign and then got the signatures
of the other demonstrators—a
procedure he repeated on the
second night of the demonstra-
tions.

The demonstrators left at 12:30
am. “We had made our point,"
Frank said, "if nothing was
done, we would stay until one
o’clock the next night."

No action was taken, and the
demonstrations continued Mon»
day night until one o'clock,

On Tuesday, Dean Thompson
asked Larry to sign a statement
declari that he took full re-
sponsib ity tor the condition of
the library after its closing.
Larry asked him to add David
Swee and John Wile’s names,
and then he signed.

The demonstrations had no ef-

GRINNELL’S FIRST DRAFT DODGER

Grinnell Professor Jesse Macy, who created the first department of political science
in the United States at then Iowa College in 1889, was also the college‘s first draft dodger.

Drafted for the Union Army in 1864 while in the “junior preparatory class’" at Grin-
neli, Macy claimed legal exemption from military service as a Quaker.

“The military ofﬁcers refused to honor this exemption," according to Grinnell historian
John S. Nollen, “and insisted on his hearing arms, but he steadily declin

Nollen, in his history of Grinnell College, said that Macy was also denied hospital serv-
ice as a wuscieutim objector.

Macy remained with his army unit and participated, apparently as the only noncom-
bntnnt, in Sherman’s March to the Sea.

The Grinnell student and later instructor despised the military. “His personal contact
with Ihe pretentious rigidity and arrogance of the limited military mind," Nollen conclud-
ed, “was calculated to conﬁrm him in his loyalty to Quaker principles."

Macy was finally given a hospital assignment shortly before the close of the War he-
tween the States, and in 1866 he returned to Grinnell as n [reshmm

OFFICIAL SCHOOL SEAL

NEW DESIGN MOTIF

NEW SEAL UNOFFICIAL

Although it appears on the
Imnt cover of the very latest
Grinnell catalogue and on the
back cover of the most recent
Student Handbook, the modem
new College seal isn't an official
leal at all.

It is merely “A design mo-
ntl." according to Mrs. Pres<
cost, director of the College In-
formation Service.

"The round seal, the old one.
urrying the ‘Christo Duoe’ mot-
lo is still the official seal of tho
Corporation.” she told the 53:3
lust week.

The new design motif, she
said, is being used on College
publications “for a trial peri-
ed."

“The idea, of course. is that
we may adopt the modern de-
sign eventually," she explained,
However, she noted, that would
have to be voted on by the
Trustees.

feet on the library committee’s
position. Before the demonstra-
tions, the Committee had unai-
Iicially decided, in Chairman
Kintner's words, that

“. . . it was the wrong move
to open the library without pro-
tessional personnel.”

Kintner stressed that he was
making no allegations that stu-
dents were less responsible than
professionals,

Librarian Henry Alden felt
there were some difﬁculties
with student Workers. l-le ex-
plained that student uorkers
are hard to get during

which a Student doesn't have.”

In its recommendation to
President Leggett, the library
committee maintained that oth~

able for study (Kinmer ex-
plained that Buriing Library
presented a problem because
study tacilities and books were
not separate).

Ric MacDowell said that the

Response lo Viet Petition

OTHERS SPEAK FOR LBJ

Presidential and Congressmns
al response to the Grinnell Stu-
dent Movement’s (GSM) antl-
wal' petition circulated last
semester “was pretty slim” ac-
cording to the GSM Vietnam
Committee's Ron Miller.

Miller said that by the begin-
ning of Interim (January 12) the
Vietnam Committee had re-
ceived only tour official reac-
lions to the petition. He added
that those reactions, for the
most part, “weren’t exactly
satisfying."

Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-
N. Y.) wrote a short note to
Vietnam Committee members on
January 8.

“Thank you for sending me a
copy of your petition to end lhe
war in Vietnam," Kennedy said,
“i appreciate your thoughdul-
ness in doing so.”

Kennedy also enclosed a re-
print of a recent Look magazine
article he had lead into the
Congressional ltecord on No-
vember 28.

in the article, entitled "What
Can We Do To End the Agony
of Vietnam," the New York sen-
ator called for “negollatlons
as the only possible way out
of the agony of Vietnam.”

Sen. Jacob Javitts (RsN. Y.)
wrote to his “friends" on the
Vietnam Committee on January
4.

“Thank you lor your letter or
November 16,” he said. “I ap-
preclate having your views and
will keep them in mind, you
may be sure."

That was all from Sen. Javlts.

The most encouraging reply,
Miller said, was from Sen.
Charles H. Percy (R-lll.). The
letter irom Percyirlle longest
one yet received by lhe GSM
committee—began by thanking
members “for taking the time
to write me of your concern
over the War in Vietnam.”

“Like you, I am deeply trou-
bled by many aspects of this
cruel conflict," rercy cumin-
ned. “I Inl particularly dis—
trested that innocent women
and children should suffer and
die in a wax which they did not
Start and cannot understand."

“I have repeatedly and force-
fully criticized the Johnson Ad-
ministration for its rigidity [0-
Ward peace initiatives," the
Senator said.

“Let me assure you,” he con-
cluded, "that I shall continue
my ettorts to promote a just
settlement of the war as soon as
possible.”

one copy or Ihe Vietnam Pe-
tition was sent to President

Johnson. The reply, however,
came lrom the Departmenl at
State.

"Thank you Im‘ your recent
letter about VietrNam to Free
ident Johnson,” wrote Dixon
Domlelley, an Assistant Secre
iaiy tor Public Affairs, on De-
cember 20, “which has been
brought to our attention.”

“We share the Fl‘eSldem'r
genuine interest in knowing the
opinions of the American peo»
ple," the Department of State
assistant avowed.

“We wish it were possible to
respond in tun to every letter;
however, the volume of mail
makes necessary this type or
acknowledgement,” the short
note elldeu.

Signed prior to and during the
Grinnell College Convocation in
October, the Vietnam Petition
Said that the Conflict in 50min
East Asia was “immoral in its
useless loss of lives."

It further listed three points
agreed to by all who signed n:
that bombing of Vietnam—
North and South—should cease;
that the U. S. should declare a
unilateral ceasefire; anti that
the U. S. should recognize that
the National Liberation Front
has significant support in the
South and should be allowed to
negotiate.

miller said that about twenty.
live copies of the petition were
mailed to President oohnson,
Cabinet members, and Con-
gressmen (notably Senators uni
representatives on the Armed
Services committees).

The Vietnam Committee had
earlier stated that students who
Wished to have copies or the
signed petition sent to their Con-
gressmen at home could do so
by paying a tee for mailing and
reproduction.

According to Miller, no one
took the GSM up on their offer.

“No one paid us thymll‘lg,"
Miller stated, “but we sent off
some copies free anyway.”

Over ilve»hundred members
of (he Grinneli communityistu-
dents and faculty members-
signed the petition, which was
not mailed until the midtlle 01'
November.

According to ofﬁcials of the
Vietnam Committee, 41 per~
cent of the student body signed
the petition. it was also signed
by several Convocation guests,
including Princeton. N. J, an»
thropologist Ashley Montagu and
Yale dramatist Richard Gilman.
The last signature on the GSM
petition was Marlin Luther

King, Jr.’s.
