A meeting or majors in the
Science division was held on
Monday, rollowing a memoran-
dum from Dean stauss concern
ing the possibility of seating

posal was designed to make
possible taculty consultation
with students on departmental
reaching policies.

Science division, only 25 ats
tended this ﬁrst meeting tor
discussion of the proposal. Stu~
dents who did come brought up
several questions concerning
the mechanics or seating stu<
dent EPC members,

Mr. Walker, chairman of the
Science division, commented
that there was no consensus
at the meeting on the options
offered, He added, “I don‘t con-
sider oileefiftlt oi the group or
majors suggested in the Exec-
utive Council's plan to he rep—
resentativa of the division.”

Walker continued, “I, per-
sonally, am seriously interest

from students, because 1 think
it is extremely important that
a student voice be heard in
curricular affairs}

Yearly Woes Plague
Wrestlers Again

A perennial Grinnell wres-
tling prohlem, lack of depth
and balance, confronts Con-
ney ximbro as he begins his
inaugural season as Pioneer
mentor.

Coach Kimbm's five re-
turning lettermen include a
trio of planets at last year's
Midwest Conference Meet.

Dori Kraitsik, the loop's
1677pdund titlist in 1967,
placed third in that weight
class last winter atter being
sidelined most of the cams
paign by an arm injury. He
returned to action just a
week before the loop meet,
and posted a 6-3 record for
the season.

Bill Wedding capped a
15-4-1 campaign by taking
second at 160, and Joel Rickr
man came in fourth at 123
and compiled an 8-6 mark lor
the Season.

The other Veterans are Bob
LeBell, who was 2716 at 145
and 152, and John Shaw,
1-151 at 130, 145 and 152.

The top sophomore pros-
pects are Ted click, 160-167;
Steve Hutchings, 167: and
Alex Karlin, a 191 pounder
who will have to fill in at
heavyweight much at the
time, They were consistent
winners a year ago as mem-
bers of Grimiell's freshman
team,

 

The Trains Hardly Go By Anymore

Every Monday and Thursday
aitcrnoon a slow ireiglit departs
f1 .ni Llutshalltown, 1a., bound
tor Albia. it is the only rogue
larly scheduled train which still
uses the iron horsepath which
graces central campus. Occa-
sionally, a handcar can be seen.
but the Grinnell College of yes-
tet'yeai' which attracted train-
loving students irom all over
the country is dead. In the
near future, esideace halls niuy
even he using railroad ties to
stoke their fireplaces.

The railroad has had an im<
portant role in the history of
Grinnell. 1. B. Grinnell founded
the city oi Erimiell at the inter
section of the northrsnuth and
the eastrwest railroad lines,
After Horace Greeley told Grin-
iieil to “Go West, young man,"
he did, and in St, Louis he met
Henry Fart-lam, the man who
owned the railroad which built
the nortli~soutlt line through
campus. r'rom him, Griniolt
learned where his line would
cross the Rock Island, and
there he founded Gn'nnell,

When the town was founded,
.1. H. Grinnell laid out its gen-
eral plan. Among other things,
he set. aside the land for Gri .
nell University which he hoped
would be built someday, At that
time the north-south line ran
beside the campus rather than
through it, The College did not

purchase the land east of the
tracks until later. Students who
consider the tracks in central
campus a nuisance may wonder
why Grinnell set aside land
next to the railroad tracks for
a College. No large plot ot land
could have been very far from
rails, especially it it were near
the center oi the Grinnell of
the 1850’s.

in 1863, the ﬁrst passenger
train Came down from the
north. An entry in the diary of
Josephus Eastman for June 27,
186.5, described the event. “The
first passenger car came
through today. This is an era
in the history of Grinnell. It
looks like the Eastern style of
living. Now, tor the first time
in ﬁve years 1 live in a town
where the cars run. Hurrah for
the cars, Hurrah, Hurrahl”

Grinnell had many trains
traveling through until rela-
tively recently. in 1953, the last
passenger train on the north-
south line was dropped. The
students on campus ilagged
down the “Doodlebug" on what
they thought was its last run
and served the crew and the
passengers doughnuts and cof<
lee. Until last Summer the
freiglits ran twice a day from
Marshalltowu to Peoria, and
smith campus residents with
one o'clock classes often had
to watch the train go by.

Swimmers Win 6
0f l4 Con’resis
In Knox Relays

On December 1, the Grinnell
swimming team competed in
the 15th annual Knox Relays,
and won six of fifteen events.
Gi‘innell teams also took second
in four events. No all-around
team scores were kept at this
meet,

Uniortunately, however, this
hopetul earlyrseasdn rodomon.
tade does not quite tell the
whole story. Grinnell still lacks
depth in the allrimportant
sprint races, whereas Mon-
mouth, who was undefeated in
dual meets last season, looks
nearly as strong as ever in this
area. Lawrence, who won the
conterence meet last spring,
did not come to the Knox Re-
lays this year. Cornell, who did
come, looks much improved.

the only Grinnell player
picked for the ins: team
was 1968 CoCaptain Don
Kraitsik as a defensive half-
back. “Bobbie Don" Lillis,
another 1968 C0»Captain, was
a second team chmce as
tackle on oilense and de-
tensc. He was the only player
iiom any school to make the
all-conference team both 017
feiisively and defensively.
Other players making the
Second All-Midwestern Con-
ference unit on offense were:
senior John Wintel‘sonﬁnd,
1968 CorCaptain, senior Jon

Hedger, assisted by Frank
Thomas, at St, Paul's Episcopal
Church last Wednesday, De-
cember 4.

Timothy McKibben
1947 1768

He never came down

to age

and walk on safer ground
and treasure

the memory of what he saw.

So, time will never dim,
for him,

what others lose,

or never had,

or never seek.

He possessed it,
with so much more,
when the earth,
not the vision,
deceived him.

Faculty Delays
Adding Students
To Admissions

,.4 Student representation on the
Admissions Committee was dls<
cussed and voted on at l fac-
ulty meeting Monday. Th
Committee on Faculty Organi-
zation recommended almost
full student representation on
the Admissmns Committee. A1-
thougli the iacuity was general-
ly in favor oi student represen-
tation, it voted against the pro-
posal. Because or concern over
revealing Confidential files on
applicants to students, it dia
rected the Faculty Organiza<
tion Committee to study tiie
idea more and submit a new
proposal aiter the semester
break.

At the well attended meeting,
extreme disagreement was we
pressed irom both sides, and
debate on the issue lasted for
almost the total of the two
hour meeting, The iinal vote,
which failed or a majority was
42 to 34, with many abstentions.

The proposal ol the Faculty
Organization Committee cov<
ered two areas The commit-
tee recommended that students
be given full representation on
the Admissions Committee con-
cerning policy matters. Con-
cerning student participation in
the deciding of special cases
which do not fall within the
policy guidelines, the commit-
tee recommended that Student
members be given voting rep«
resentation but not full access
to the confidential files of ap-
phcants.

The difficulty on this second
point centered on privacy or
files and Whether students
should be allowed to see con-
fidential recommendation and
medical forms, The commit-
tee's proposal on this question
seemed to he a compromise be
tween giving the student mem-
bers voting rights with tull ac-
cess to ﬁles and no voting rep-
resentation at all. Although, ac-
cording to one faculty member,
a good case was made for the
“coding" of information (using
symbols tor proper names)
from confidential forms, the
mood or the iaculty at Mon-
day’s meeting was apparently
towards not allowing any rep-
resentatlon in this area, and
the Committee on Faculty 0P
ganizatioii is expected to come
up with a new preposal of that
nature.

Because of the length of the
discussion on the Admissions
Committee, the iaculty heard
an abbreviated version of Mr.
Magee's report on me Student
Aflairs Committee. his report,
submitted now because he will
M on leave next semester,
called the faculty's role in the
present polarity oi student. and
