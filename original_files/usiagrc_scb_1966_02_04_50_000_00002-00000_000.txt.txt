Prof [ambush S&B's Unification
0f Student Socialslcademic Life

To the Editor:

Congratulations! Just when
Grinnell is threatened with total
Iubmergence in the cant of hyp»
ocrisy the S&B’s dynamic editor
comes through again. You are
quite right to take the faculty
and administration to task for not
having I coherent and uniform
view of students. Down with in-
dividuality and difference! Let's
quit kidding and equate social lite
completely with academic life
and stop trying to make meaning-
less distinctions within the sphere
of "academic experience” The
college authorities have departed
radically from their suspicious
view of the students, of whom they
always suspect the Worst, by
instituting the “credit-fail" sys-
tem. You have courageously
alerted everyone to this and sug-
gested it would be foolish to ex
periment and hope the students
would act with responsibility. Of
course they will abuse the system
and silly ideas that they Won’t
should not be allowed to masquer-
ade under the cover of a suppos-
Idl liberal experiment.

uwever, I also support you in
your call for a new unified view
or the students. Let us assume,
Is they so often tell us, that they
are far more mature than we give
them credit for. Let us abﬂlish all
grades and have a complete cred.
.It-fail system. Let’s get rid of the
hypocrisy of letters of recommen-
dation to grad schools and supply
each professor with a printed
sheet of paper (using a good

stock, of course) whore he can

 

fill in the name of the student
and then check either “recom-
mended" or “not recommended
for graduate Study.” 1 mean, after
all, either a student is or he or
she isn’t. No need for advisors —
who do little anyway but try to
im ose their views on students H
eit err students know what they
want.

Let’s carry this over to social
life, too. Abolish all rules and let
the lowa State Police and Liquor
Commission into the dorms to
handle that question. Forget about
having deans intervene with the
authorities if students get into
trouble, either on campus or
downtown. After all. students are
mature enou h not to need the
protection 0 a ”loco parent".
What is more hypocritical than
cutting our students off from the
way others live and thereby mak-
ing them rpeciall

Counseling emotional problems
and all that jazz are the business
of the students and the parents.
Let’s also make them responsible
for the repair and upkeep of their
living quarters, the way one is in
the real world. This would not
only cut down on the hypocrisy
but eliminate constant tension be
tween the students and 13ch (of
course it might take a while to
find something else to talk about).

in short, a loud hurrah for your
spproachl You didn't quite go far
enough and weren't quite logical
enough but that’s why we are here
~ to help pride you. Please enlist
one enthusiastic supporter and
guide.

A Friendly Faculty Member

Campus Politics, SGA

To the Editor:
The upcoming contest for the
SGA presidency promises to be
our first free, allcampus election
in three years. Since the spring
of 1954, two prospective candr
dates have been prevented from
running for this office by out-
right political intimidation. Cam-
paign costs have grown probi
five to many. Efform in last ycai
Senate to correct this abuse were
squelchcd by those whose mtcr
ests required the exclusion of
others from Sludent government.
The consequences of this neglir
genes are plain to see. The cam»
pus political structure has be
come a closed system, unrespon
sive to creative initiatives irom
the student body. As one example,
the Senate this year twice refused
to provide funds for the Des
Molnes Prolect, although more
than seven hundred students have
agrccd to support this effort by
a onetneal fast Also, no construc-
tivc response has been given to
lacully proposals for tho rciorm

of the hall system. Administra-
tion intervention in this matter
results from a failure of students
and their government to develop
and implement meaningful goals
in community living. One iaculty
member has trenchantly expressed
the current inertia in SSA: “Atter
me, llle delugel"

thn one rates present per.
formance in terms of past achieve
ment at Grinnell, the record of
the Goddard administration is dis
couraging. Coutrasted with the
pioneering guilds of students and
faculty who founded the univen
sittcs of Europe, the story be
comes positively ludicrous. Though
campus respect for our govern-
ment has seriously deteriorated,
one may hope that certain immc
dials changcs by a vigorous 2dr
ministration can reverse the
trend.

The Grudge Pot

In this age of democratic concern over the surplus
quantifies 0t loudstutls that are such an ironic waste
and expense, it is surprising that another sorely-
pressing surplus has been long ignored by the Ameri.
can public. Such august societies as the D.A,R. and
the P.T.A. have no official viewpoint on the subject,
and even recently relevant information has been
scarce.

The problem, of course, is that of an excessive
number of corpses. Doubt of the severity of the prob-
lem now fills most of the even well-informed public
with apathy, and the peace and quiet of contem-
porary cemeteries seem to after a gentle reassur-
ance.

But the truth can be found in the August edition
of The Mortlcian’s Digest (p. 23): “ The corpse sur-
plus is the gruesome counterpart ol the population
explosion . . . it has reached almost epidemic pro-
portions . . . soon our graveyards may look like over-
piled junkyards.”

A serious side-effect, which ultimately may ruin
our medical profession, is the large number of Cadav-
ers now being supplied to medical schools. Jerome
Heart, dean of Jack Hopkins, has much to say on
the subject.

“This Situation is really awtul! It's unbearable.
So many people nowadays think they are doing the
one good deed of their lives when they give their
bodies to science, but they're really just fouling up
our whole program.

“Here at J. Hi we have so many cadavers that we
have to keep our boys up half the night, carving and
slicing and digging away. As you know, you can’t
keep a dead body forever like a can of beans. And

you Can't look a gilt-horse in the mouth, either. So
there we are, stuck With heaps of wrinkly little old
ladies and (at old codgers and such.

“If these people really wanted to do their country
some good, they would live longer. Or they could go
somewhere inconspicuous to die. At least, then, they
would not add to the problem.“

Enlightened commentators on the Situation have
seen some promise in the government's recent recog-
nition of the problem. Through Such modem tech
niques as the war in Viet Nam, bodies are deliveied
to foreign lands and are legally and judiciously disa
posed otr

specialists have noted the extreme suitability of
rice-paddies for mass burials, and the government
has further out the expense of the project by elimi—
nating cold-storage and sending the bodies over
while still alive.

Yet, the disposals in Viet Nam are only a drop
in the bucket when placed in the perspective of the
entire population The Dead Menace still exists, and
if current tlends continue unchecked, by the year
2050 every man, woman, and child can look lDrWald
to only three square inches in which to be buried.

“What can I do?" the responsible citizen must
ask. if only man had the lemming instinct and ran
to the sea, or it he were an elephant with one llllal
resting ground, the citizen could act.

The lasting solution now lies only in the hands of
him whose linger rests over the nuclear button. The
natural and harmonious proportions of mankind can
be restored only by such a purge of fire. Let us pray
that that day comes before our progeny have no

place at all to call a grave

Kirschner Protest Letter Provokes
Swee Discussion of Lack of Privacy

To the Editor'

As was r ‘ognized in Miss
Ku‘schnel’s letter, there 13 )1 ba-
Sic disparity between what this

college purports in do and what
it really does. Tllis is to be ex»
pected. No one can blamc the col-
lege [or trying to present the best
tillage it can. Wth is sad IS that
the catalog is the only basis in
choosing a college to which to
apply. This, of course, leads to
the obvious disappointments But
it seems to me that more is no
leaoon Why the college can't be
made to live up lo its projected
image more fully. i would like
to discuss the main areas of Stu-
dent life, namely study and social
lunctlons, with this lll mind,
Now, while it is true that me
collcge provides a number of
placos to study outside of [he stu»
uenls’ rooms, it is also true that
these areas could be both im-
proved and enlarged upon. For
me, the noisy. glary library does
not have the proper atmosphere
for study. This could be remedied,
partly by more cooperailon on the
part oi the administration to can
[ml the noise level of the offices
situated ill the basement and the
first floor. Purl. of the library's
problem lies in its modern glass
structure. To me. a library is a
place in which you can look for
it certain kind of isolaliun. The

 

large glass windows prevent you

 

from getting any sense of privacy,
except In a few selected seats hid-
deli among the books upstairs.
The glare of the lights also pre-
vents isolation. The glare pro»
duccs an atmosphere of noise and
trivolity, instead of the more aus-
tcro, l'elinell mood of a good li-
brary. Curtains and softer lights
with individual desk lamps could
help here

The rooms in A RH. and Good-
now are not really meant for
studying. The seats in Ah H. are
uncomfortable while the lighting
in Goodnow is poor, The rooms
in the Science building and Car.
negie are excellent. My only com»
plaint is that there aren’t nlore of
them, I say this even though I
know for a iact that they are nev-
er very full. This is because the
feeling of privacy is ruined if
more than a few people are in
these small rooms, Although the
South Lounge is sometimes used
for studying, students should not
feel that they have to whisper
there, for it was originally in-
tended for informal conversation.
It's up to the students themselves
to bring this about

As the college offers the stu-
dents certain places to study. so
does it offer them certain places
to talk. There are many places
where two people can talk a1»

[he wanton slaughter of small
animals in the Grinnell areal
These persons use the biology de»
partmenl as a front to lend their
dastardly enterprise good name
and a legitimate cover. They have
managed to hoodwink the faculty
into assigning them a class time
and the use of facilities or the
school, under the name of a class
in “Animal Ecology."

Days ago, those villains set out
into the fields and vsles of tho
Grinncll area with the purpose oi
setting out crucl mechanical traps
to kill or maim small animals
wand -' g afield in their struggls
for girl ellce. in ten days, they
have caught approximately 140
helpless animals, Why must this
annihilation go on? Shall we per.
mit such pointed cruelty to pro
ceed? What is the purpose of
these fiends? They purport to be
taking a scientific surrey uhicb
needs to measure a cross section
of the animal population. This 1
can understand, but I cannot \In-
derslano why they must be killed.
in my anguish, i asked one of the
crin nals why. He merely rcloricd
with glee, “the little beggars arc
ellslcr to measure when thcy are
irozcn still!" Another time, he
reported with obvious satisfaction
that they had killed a chickadcc.
l-ic wasn't so happy another day
when they caught a bird by the
foot; they lot him go in hopes hc
might irocze to death with a
broken leg.

Picture. gentle reader, an out
mal caught and freezing to death,
The poor dumb animals try to
crawl away. but the demons wire

the traps in place. One or the
trappers grinned and explained
with satanic glee that “When J‘ou
see the trap upsidevdown at the
end. of the Wire, you know you've
got one!” Oh Horrorl! I must loll
you, they chew their legs on to
free themselves, only to freeze to
death or die from loss of blood.
Gentle sir, help me by telling
llle students of fair Grinnell cl
this masquerade, and lead us in
its destruction. Let “5 fight cruel»
