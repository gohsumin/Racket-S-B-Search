 

President’s Report Reviewed

In commenting upon the state
of the college in “The President's
Report,” Mr. Leggett described
the institutional and physical
dianges which have taken place
at Grinnell during the past year
and a half, As this report was
intended for an audience of
alumni and parents, it was
natural that he depict this in-
stitution in a generally favorable
manner. Accordingly, what were
considered ‘positive’ changes
were'emphasized while other
developments were glossed over.
Although I agree with his
analysis of Grinnell as an in-
stitution generally moving in a
positive manner to confront its
difficulties, severai areas of this
report deserve additional
comment.

President Leggett described

Folk Festival and
Workshop To Be Held

There is no need to go to
Newport or Woodstock to hear
authentic foTk music. One week
from today, the Social Coordir
nating Committee will sponsor a
two-day folk music festival here
in Grinnell. Ron Stanford, coordir
nator of the festival, has secured
over a dozen folk musicians and
four folklorists,'reaturing such
singers as Mother Maybelle
Carter of the famous Carter
family, Bukka white, Art Rosen»
baum, Glenn 0hrlin and Joe
Pazour; also John and Grace
Papakee, Keith Dempster and
Fred Martin. Although only
students of old-time traditional
folk music will recognize and
appreciate these names, anyone
can enjoy their music,

The program features a wide
variety of styles, including moun-
tain music, gospel singing, coun-
try and western music and ethnic
folk songs. The first formal
concert, in Robert's theatre, is
on Friday night, from 10:00 PM,-
12100 P.M.; the second on Saturr
day night, from 8:00 P.M.-11:00
P.M. However, the formal
concerts are only one part of the
festival. Informality will pervade
the folk music workshops in
South Lounge, to which all guitar
and banjo enthusiasts are in-
vited. Students will also be free
to meet and socialize with the
performers, who will live in the
dormitories and eat in the dining
halls,

campus as one which, in general,
has been steadily improving
Justiiiably, he pointed to
renovations in buildings, im»
proved landscaping, and the
expansion of the bookstore as
exampies oi the ac-
complishments in this area, The
quality or the college's en
vironment, however, is deter»
mined by far more than land»
scape beautification and building
renovation. it is also dependent
upon adequate academic
facilities which enable the
community to proceed with the
process oi education. The im-
provement oi the bookstore
partially answers this need. It
is, however, difficult to justify the
expenditure of college Iunds on
a physical education complex
while students must rely on
private sources for books in order
to pursue research. Thus it
would seem that the coll'ege
environment might have
benefited more by establishing
the priority of increasing library
expenditures instead of im-
proving in landséaping and
physical education complexes.
Similarly, in a quotation from
Howard R. Bowen which was
cited in this report, Grinnell was
described as an “active, lively,
stimulating, and questioning
place.” Aithough this might
present a pleasing analysis tor
alumni and parents, it does not
bear up to close scrutiny. For
example, Michael Finley

Finally, President Leggett’s

position in the governing of the
college remains unclear. In an
address to the faculty, he stated
that it was necessary to decide
“what is clear and what isn’t,
what makes sense and What

what isn‘t, and what is negotiable
and what isn’t" in relation to the
student position paper. Thus it

The issue is coniused further by
untimely dissemination by the

attacks the entire concept or

Chekov’s ”The Three Sisters”
To Be Performed Later This Semester

Director Robert Ingham has
selected iiiteen students from
lhe thirty-five who auditioned for
the spring production or Chekov’s
“The Three Sisters.” Leading the
cast are Ricki Ravitts, Audrey
Vandercook and Patty L‘oeb, who
play thethree sisters, and Philip
Vaughan, Greg Wallance and
Ray Kantor who play the prinr
cipal male roles. Maunena Carter
is production stage manager.

Duringthe first four weeks, the
entire cast will attend seminars
given twice weekly by the
Russian and History Departs
ments, in order to acquire a
cultural and historical
background of eighteenth cenr
tury Russia. Following that, the
production will go into full
rehearsal with performances on
April 23, 24, and 25 and again
on May 29, 30.

“The Three Sisters,” con-

sidered by many to be Chekov's
greatest work, is chiefly a
psychological study of stultiiied
bourgeois characters and their
futile quest for happiness it
should be interesting to see how
Chekov‘s explanation of their
empty ambitions and apathy
stands in relation to the current
protest movement and alleged
apathy of today's college
students,

lngham chose this modern
classic primarily for the same
reason that Grinncll's guest
director John Ulmer chose “The
Playroom, is. the characters are
close to the actual ages of the
student actors who play them.
The elimination of the age
barrier allows the student to
concentrate on other problems of _
acting, and, with very successful
results, as evidenced by last
semester‘s performances.
