Faculty Reiecls Clolfeller Proposal 4

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

Acting as a committee of the
whole, the faculty narrowly
defeated the Clotfelter Propoe
sal to dropallcourse require-
ments for graduation on Oct.
5. The marginal and contested
4542 vote culminated four
weeks of lackluster debate,
parliamentary boondoggles,
and faculty apathy.
The “Clotfelter Proposal is
technically "Proposal III" of
the report submitted to the
faculty on August 25 by the
Faculty Summer Study Com-
mittee. Its full test is as fole
lows:
Proposal III: A curri-
culum with no fixed
requirements other than
a limitation upon the
number of credits that
may be counted towards
graduation in any one
field and a fixed
number of credits
for graduation.

To this was appended a sub-

Graham To Play
This Weekend

Violist John Graham will
make two appearances at Gre
itinell this weekend, the first
at 8 p.m. Friday with the Fri
ancesco Trio and the second
as a soloist at 8 p.m. Sunday,
both concerts to beperformed
in Herrick Chapel.

Graham lives in New York
City, where he is regularly
heard in recitals andin cham-
ber music concerts. He was
violist with the EEGUX’AI‘tS
String Quartet for five years
and toured the United States,
Canada, Europe and Australia
with the group.

A participant in the 1970
Marlboro Music Festival,
Graham will tour with an en-
semble from the festival this
winter. He plays a rare Amati
viola made in the same 17th
century period asMiss Hampe
ton’s Amati cello. Hehaspere
formed on many occasions
with members of the Fran'
cesco Trio.

Graham earned a degree in
music at the University of
California at Berkeley and
now lectures at the City Col-
lege of New York

stantial rationale written by
Mr. Clotfelter, which empha-
sized general educationas op-
posed to a fixed body of facts
to be known by all graduates,
a thorough revision ofthepren
sent advisory system, and its
replacement with one oriented
towards freshman guidance on
the basis of probable interest.
Noting that this system would
tie students rather more clo-
sely to their departments than
is the case now, Cletfelter
argues that Students would be
protected against "the despm
tic power of the departments
in three ways": credit limir
nation, recognition of inter-
disciplinary majors, anda re
quirement that all depart-
ments "devote some reason*
able part of their manpower
to general education courses,
designed for the nonvmajor."

In its Augnist 28 meeting the
faculty voted 72— It) in favor of
opening meetings discussing
general—education proposals
“to students and other meme
bers of the college commun-
ity," who would be allowed to
speak, but not to vote. How
ever, student attendance and
interest has been even scare
cer than that of the faculty,
and a maximum audience of
about 60 was by far the large
est student contingent. The
faculty further moved to con-
sider in subsequent meetings
"general education require
ments" rather than the pre-
viously stipulated "general
curriculum." This seems lat
ter to have been construed as
excluding from debate the iS*
sue of retaining Physical Ed-
ucation Requirements for
graduation. Defences were
then offered for alternative
proposals:

Mr. Parslow: spoke for the

maintenance of the current
general-education require-
ments as found in the Cata*
logue.

Mr. Erickson2arguedagainst
the Clotfelter Proposal as
presently a false alternative
to the current system. Rather,
he favored a distributionalre—
quirement which would allow
flexibility and increased chr
oice of individual courses,
while requiring ”some study
of several major areas."

Miss Noble: Spoke fora "tri-
partite distribution plan,"whe
ose main features would be a
"core course requirement"
consisting of a 4 credit H“,

manitles course concentrating
on individual student-teacher
contact (no more than 18 stu-
dents allowedper section),and
a distribution requirement of
8 credit hours in each ofthree
groups of departments:

Group A; Biology, chemis-
try, physics, psychology, lane
guage, mathematics.

Group B: Anthropology, ece
onomics, education, history,
political science, sociology.

Group C: Art, communica-
tions, literature, music, philr
osophy, theater.

In addition, the proposal stip-
ulated that PhysicalEducation
requirements be mainmined,

with completionasa prerequi-
site for graduation.

Between Sept. 1 and Oct. 12
position papers were submit-
ted to the faculty by Mssrs.
Erickson, Oelke, Kurtz, Kint-
ner, and Cleaver.

Kurz's positionrpaper-pro-
posal appears to advocate,
with reservations, the clot
felter proposal. It warns ag-
ainst the dangers of "educa‘
tional entrepreneurship", in-
tellectual faddishness and in-
tern divisional competition,
which he sees as detrimental

As Low TurnoulL Shows Apathy

by Jon Stein

On October 6 after conside-
rable discussion and modifie
cation the proposals for in-
creasing student involvement
in the College’s decision-mar
king process were submitted
to the student body. The pro-
posals were largely the work
of three ad hoc committees
and concerned the areas of

social policies and regula-
tions and counseling. Theproe
posals were reviewed and re-
fined by committee A (the
executive cabinet of S.G.A.,
the Deans, and the Chairman
of the Faculty), and are likely
to be approved by the presie
dent in the near future.

IN SHARP CONTRAST TO
THE HUGE TURNOUTS AT
LAST YEAR'S "STUDENT

Town-Gown To Clean Grinnell

by Mark Sableman

Several groups on campus
and in town who have been
working on improving town~
gown relations have set aside
Saturday, Oct. 24, as Commue
nity Day, a day for members
of the Grinnell community to
work together cleaning up Gr-
innell.

The impetus for Community
. l

Day came from the Environ-
ment Committee of the Grin—
nell CommunityPlanning Coue
ncil, a group which includes
Rev. Michael Tan Creti of St.
Paul's Church and ﬁris Nell-
son of the college Develop—
ment Office. Father TanCreti
and Mr. Neilson spoke to the
Student Senate last month, and
later to a meeting ofstudents.

Rev. John Frykman, Dr. Roger Smith and Dr. Andrew Weil were participants in the
drug symposium sponsored here October I and 2. Rev. Frykman, who is a consulting
psychiatrist in Carmel, Calif., spoke Friday afternoon on the “brief therapy" treat-
ment he uses to treat a variety of problems, including bad drug trips. Dr. Smith, a
former criminologist who ran a treatment clinic in the midst of the HaightrAshbury
speed scene, spoke on the background and history of drug attitudes. Dr. Weil is ems
ployed by the National Institutes of Mental Health where he has been studying mari-
juana, and he talked about the ”uninteresting“ pharmacology of the psychoactive drugs.

dent Coordinator, who has
been in charge of most of the
preparation for Community
Day, said that about 70 Slud‘
ents have volunteered to work
so far, and the response from
toWn organizations has been
good. Townspeople and town
organizations and businesses
will contribute tools, equip-
ment, and paint, and towns-
people and students will work
together cleaning up road-
ways, clearing vacant lots,
and painting houses of selecr
ted citizens who are unable
to do it themselves.

Community Day is thought of
by its planners as an activity
that will be made intoa yearly
affair if the response thisyear
is good. William Deminoff,
Director of College Relations,
said he believes it is valuable
as a natural way for people
from the town and the college
to get together and understand
each other, while performing
a useful job for the whole com-
munity.

Deminoff is one ofthe college
representatives on a subcome
mittee of the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission which.is

‘ concerned with townrcollege

relations. (Russell McGregor
is the other member, and a
woman student will be added
soon.) This committee plane
ned a general town-college
meeting that was held last
month, and subsequently re
ported by the Des Moines
Register. Deminoff believes
that the meeting, designed to
alleviate some of the tension
resulting from the early clos-
ing of the College last spring

POWER" MEETINGS THE
TURNOUT FOR THIS HIGH-
LY PUBLICIZED MEETING
TOTALED 34 STUDENTS.
Andy Loewi, S.G.A. presi-
dent, opened .the meeting by
giving a historical perspec-
tive on the student power
movement and the position
paper that emerged from the
ﬂurry. While attacking the
position paper on the grounds
that it was hastily prepared
and that those involved had
“just plugged more students
into existing positions”. Loe~
wi praised its basic ideas.
Bill Thomas, C. of H.P.pre~ .
sident, presented the struc-
ture of the Committee on So~
cial Policies and Regulations
and praised it for its “eco—
nomical" wording. The duties
of the committee will be to
review and recommend chanr
ges in the allecollege social
policies and regulations as
well as provide a forum for
any member of the college
community who wishes to

Committee’s area. The mem-
