A New Name for the S&B

The Sam stair is planning to change the paper’s name in the
next law weeks, We are looking for an appropriate new name and

Itlggestions aie welcome.

We think it’s time the paper’s name represents what it’s sup-
ed to —— the college newspaper. Most newspaper names signify.
two or three words, the locale oi the paper and the fact that it

relates the news, to. the Milwaukee Journal, the Antioch Record,
the Yale Daily News, and the London Times. The present name.
Scarlet or Black, falls a little short on both counts. Nobody knows

What the colors mean,

We think the Grinnell College paper should have a name more
In keeping with the serious character or the school. Colors might
be lino tor telling toothell teams apart, but they have little sig-
niﬁcance to the present day Grinnell College School colors, like
high school and the old Grinnell May Day celebrations, are pretty
much a thing of the past. Even the staid old Alumni Scarlet &
Black is going to change its name and format in the near future.

The start has considered naming the paper the Griiineu Journal
or the Grinnell Weekly; however, we are open to iurther sug-
gestions. Submit ideas to the 5&1! box in the post ofﬁce.

Senate Satire

To the Editor:

1 respoctiuliy suggest that in
her letter last week Miss Cuss-
ler completely missed the point
of my senate satire and the
pointlessness of the revolution-
lry Speech.

My article was directed at
those individuals who are more
concerned with meaningless
rhetoric and 19th century clich-
es, 6. g. “social upheaval,"
than with a specific discussion
of issues that contront this col~
loge, it was directed against
those who uncritically accept
such cliches and act without
clearly - deﬁned and me an-
ingrul goals. it was directed
against an absurd intensity tor
words rather than for sub-
stance, and against an absurd
manner engendered by that
misplaced intensity. Finally, it
was written hecausa it we take
student government too serious-
ly, is we don‘t laugh at our mis-
takes and correct them, we will
never stop talking in clichei
tind the administration will nev-
er stop laughing.

Those like me, who tire easi-
ly oi cliches, want “meaning-
rul dialogue,” Ind want some
specilic issues to he examined
critically. We want ii priority
assigned to those issues, one
that ippreciates Grinnell’s aca-
demic 1ailures, such as poor
teaching and crowded class-
rooms, as well as its social tail-
ures. We want innit disclu-
sions, not intellectual poln<
posity.

Whether our revolutionaries
“succeed” or not doesn‘t in.
terest me. Their goals do. Last
Week's “Open Letter" by the
"Group" was a helptul and posi-
tive act. Hopefully, we've dis-
pensed with cliches; now let’s
speak and act specilically and
intelligently, and perhaps with
a little hut. tr.

Meanwhile, 1 would like to
cordially invite Miss Cussler
up to my room (1032 East)
this Sunday atternoon. Per-
haps we could
plore the possih
“slap-happiness.”

Reply to Prof. Fletcher

To the Editor:

Protessor Fletcher’s letter in
last week’s 8&3 certainly
merits attention hy those who
signed the statement of two
weeks ago and the open letter
to President Leggett of last
week. The oarhcd levity at Mr.
Fletcher’s choice of quotation
leads me to suggest a selection
from the Marxist-inninlst canon
which may indicate that the
method of citation is as humor»
ous as it is endless. One quota-
tion which suggests itselt is
Lenin’s attack on Zinoviev and
Kamenev in October 1917 tor
their (ailure to support the
planned insurrection:

i . . to remain silent in the
race of such unheard of
strikebreaking would he a
crime. The more serious the
practical problem, and the
more responsihle and “promi.
nent” the persons guilty oi
strike-breaking, the more
dangerous it is, the more
resolutely must the strike-
breakers he ejected, and the
more unpnrdonahle would it
he to hesitate even in con-
sideration or the past “ser-
vices” of the rtrikshrenkers.
(Lenin, Selected Worlis, v.1!
part i, p. 191.)

Dr: The Proleetarian nevolu-
lion and the Renegade Kautsky.
Such citations are, or course,
amusing, and may satisfy une’s
penchant toi- pedantry, hut the
process of reasoning is very
reminiscent ol the scholastic
approach to Marxism

While such historical par-
allels are interesting it is un-
fortunate that prolessor Fletch-
er took the phrase “What is to
he done" out oi the context
which was given it in the sen-
iite speech. This sontrihutes to
a general misunderstanding of
the issues involved and may
lead to truitless polemic. Per-
haps it is unfortunate that the
speech ended with that phrase,
but the greater misfortune ii
that the phrase was used by
Mr. Fletcher is a pretext for
dialectical acrobatics, The
phrase was chosen to reﬂect
the sense or irustrstion which
many students feel, not to re-
call the content ot several
generations of Russian radical-
ism. After all, as Protessor
Fletcher linowi well, the
phrase "what is to he done
was used to express their
trustrition ind demand tor
change. Needless to say Lenin’s
adoption or that phrue did not

indicate his adoption of the
previous radicals programs.
The adoption oi that phrase
here does not commit those
who use it to “revolution” in
the sense that Lenin understood
the term.

Mr. Fletcher also describes
the group as “selfrstyled revo-
lutionnries.” This indicate.
clearly — even beyond tho
manner in which he rater-ted
— the depth of the gull be-
tween the content of the letter
and Mr. Fletcher's ipprecin.
tion of that content. For i! on.
sareiully peruse: that stateY
ment there is no mention of
the word "revolution," ratllel
I call [or student revolt. Till.
choice of phrasing was de-
liberate. None 0! the student:
in the group are calling toy
revolution: such a call would
be obvious nonsense. As a For
litical scientist Mr. Fletcher is
aware of the distinction be-
tween the metaphorical use oi
the word. eg. managerial revo-
lution, Negro revolution, etc.,
and the substantive, eg, Rus-
sian Revolution, French Revo-
lution, etc. There can he no
question of students taking
over the administration, hiring,
promoting, and firing laculty,
Such . goal would properly be
called revolution, and those
who proposed it under prevail.
lng conditions would be “in-
fantile adventurers.”

However. it one labels thosa
who call lor student revolt to
actualize ideals which are
stated in the Grinnell Colleg-
Catalog and are implicit in the
liberal tradition itself “revolu-
tional'ies," then one is indlttg<
ing in fantasy. The call for
student revolt is based upon the
failure of the college to achieve
adequate realization of these
ideals. As long as the adminis<
tuition is able to indulge in
