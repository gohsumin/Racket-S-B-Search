Antiquity Questioned Again

Among other notable activities last
Monday, the faculty voted to change
the present social studies requirement.
Faced with a large number of
freshmen and sophomores wllo have
not yet completed the social studies
requirement, as well as with a potentially
enormous freshman class next year, the
faculty adopted the proposal of the anlal
studies EPC as a temporary but experi-
mental program geared to both faculty
and student interests.

All stlldean Will be required to take
in their first two years, elther two one-
semester Social Studies courses offered
under divisional sponsorship, or one of
these plus an introductory course (in
any order), or two introductory courses,
in the sunlai studies division.

This new format, according to Philip
Klntner, chairman of the Social Studies
EFC, should provide leeway for the
faculty in the set-up of courses Instruc<
tors will not have to teach unfamiliar
material planned and outlined by others,
Each faculty member, will formulate
a course outline, syllabus, and biblio-

graphy for a course which will be hopa<
fully interdisciplinary, possibly problem-
oriented; (one section of the social stus
dies course might deal with population.
another with Vietnam). The apploach
and subject matter of the course will be
announced before registration, and a
course would normally close at 25 stu-
dents, and not be offered if less than
eight students signed up.

Some sections of the course will be
offered each semester, although students
may choose to take introductory courses
in different departments instead. These
also will come under review by their
respective departments in an effort to
accommodate both the goals of general
education and those of the specific disci-
pline.

In December of 1970, this social studiel
experiment will be thoroughly evaluated
by the divisional arc. The requirement
may evolve into a totally new course,
revert back to the old format, or remain
essentially the same. In any case, the
changed requirement should provide
students with a choice more suited to
varying individual interests.

Twenty college students, representing
seven Iowa colleges and universities, reg-
istered as lobbyists with the iowa House

of Representatives on April 7 to back a
proposal to lower the voting age from
21 to 19. The students were all members
of the Action Committee to Lower the
Voting Age in iowa, a non-partisan group
organized among the students of the 28
Iowa colleges and universities.

The students in Des Moines on Mon.
day represented the University of Dubu-
one, the University or lowa, Briar Cliff,
Clark, Grinneli, Loras, and Westmsr col-
leges. Sophomore Ken Labowitz repre-
sented Grinnell. Besides those students
at the capitol, statements of support for
the committee’s efforts were received
from the other lowa colleges. Grinnell’s
Student Senate approved a statement
backing the group on April 2.

After registering as lobbyists, the
group's activities consisted of meeting
with ﬁle various members of the town
House who were instrumental in keep
ing the proposed constitutional change
in the Steering Committee of the House.

Friday. April I i, lm

Ten Senators will be
elected Monday, April
14th. Voting will he in
the lunch lines. Candi-
dates will discuss their
platforms Sunduy at
7:00 pm. in the South
Lounge.

The town Senate has already approved a
constitutional amendment lowering the
voting age to 19, and Governor Ray has
expressed his strong support tor such a
measure. In the House, however, Re-
publican forces defeated a move to bring
the proposal before the House on April
3.
The committee of students devoted
their efforts to changing the minds of
those representatives who had blocked
the move to bring the motion before the
full house. The students were successful
in having the blocking motion brought
up for reconsideration, with the likely
possibility of the bill coming before the
full House for debate.

Music Exchange:

While lovers of string quartets and
country fiddle tunes may bemoan the
loss of the Lenox Quartet, the College

is hiring another group to carry the ba-
ton of chamber musio at Grinneli.

President Leggett has announced the
selection of the Francesco Chamber Trio
as the Musicians-in—Residence to succeed
the Lenox Quartet who will leave at the
end of this year. The trio, which has
gained its reputation mainly through per-
formances in the San Francisco area. is
composed of violinist David Abel, cellist
Bonnie Hampton, and pianist Nathan
Schwartz. According to Mr. Don Jones

Four for Three

of the music department, the Francesco
Trio is “one of the finest chamber en-
sembles," He emphasized the group’s
ability as a professional ensemble and
added that each of the musicians is an
excellent soloist.

Jones noted that it is difficult for I
musician to remain professional if the
performer does not have time to pram
tice. Consequently, the group will not be
teaching classes 01 their own, although
the group did express interest in teach-
ing. Their duties will consist of teaching
parts of courses. giving recitals and lean
ture~recitals, offering private lessons,
and coaching student ensembles.
