Two quick goals in the open‘

the Pioneers to overcome as
the Knox Siwash handed them
a 2-1 defeat. The 1055 brought
the Pioneers' record to 1-1.

closing seconds of the game
Steve Korstad, the Pioneer right
wing, ricocheted the ball into
the goal off of a fine corner

successful on the one try.

Once the defense took hold.
Coach Hemingway’s crew played
a steady game. They threatened
several times and controlled the
ball adequately.

Goalie Dave Coron and leit
halfback Mike Eaton played a
commendable game on delense.
Bruce Graham and Dave North

Tomorrow the Pioneers travel
to Mount Vernon to race Cornell.
The rematch should be very eic
citing. While the Pioneers seem-
ingly won going away in the
first meet, Coach Hemingway
feels that the game was much
closer than the score revealed.
Both teams will be up for this
one.

Sunday, the Pioneers will re-
turn home to face the Universi-
ty of Iowa on Soccer Field The
Hawkeya team is described
as “having very fine potential."
While the team consists largely
of graduate students and some
semiapfotessionals, Coach Hern-
fngway expects them to send
primarily their college team.
If this is so, the Pioneers stand
a better than even chance to
win. Should the Hawkeyes come
in full strength, the odds would
be substantially stacked the
other way. But in either case,
the two'teams promise to pre.
sent a 'well-executed’ soccer
game. The beginning insect: is
at 2 pm.

Pioneers Lose

43-22; Ripon Up

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Last Saturday, in their first
home game, the Pioneers were
beaten by Cornell 43-22. Both
sides made many mistakes, but
Cornell was able to take advan-
tage of the Grinnell errors.
Each of our first three fumbles
set up uninterrupted drives for
touchdowns. Once we had them
on their own 29 with first and
ﬁfteen. and once we had to
give up the ball on their 33.
Both times they went in for
scores.

We failed however to use the
numerous breaks we had. Rick
Vranek intercepted a pass on
their 26, later recovered a
tumble on their 33, and inter-
cepted still another pass on
their 20 (good day for Rick);
however, each time the PiD‘
neers failed to do anything in
the succeeding downs. Three
times the defense had them
with third down and over
eleven yards for the first, when
the next play set up a touch-
down.

Cornell’s Lannom (HE from
the town of Grinnell) and Cam-
panelli (E) were the main
headaches that day. Lannom
carried the ball twenty»two
times without losing a yard,
and gaining a total of 133.
Campanelli cought eight pass-
es for a total of one hundred
and fifty one yards (ho has
scored a total of thirty points
this year —- good enough to tie
(or second highest scorer in
the conference).

Despite the score and all of
Cornell’s glory, Grinnell did
have some good moments. Punt

and kickoff returns were much'
better; Lewis booted a beautiful
titty-rive yard kickoff and Vra-
nek averaged fortyaone yards
per punt, with one sailing titty.
iour yards. John Winterson
looked great in the second half
after being subjected to a brus
tal double-teamed first half.
Roy Lewis looked good when
he could find running room,
and Gary Johnson did a “fair“
(Coach Bowers‘ term) jolt
when he was in at quarterback.
Steve Hutchings did a iantastio
job blocking a punt, and Bob
Lillis made an excellent pick-up
and forty-yard touchdown run
—— one of the real high points
of the game. Also, I have to
admire the spirit of a team
that can come back after the
half, down thirty-one to eight,
and display the spirit and dos
termination we did in the sec-
ond half. We never gave up,
and the team even had the fans
cheering when the score was so
had.

Tomorrow, Grinnell faces
Ripon (2.0). and it should be
a tough game. It: will be an
away game, and, barring the
mistakes that killed us last
week, we have the potential to
give them a hard time.
