practicable alternatives in that
situation."

It should be the task of
government and of all men to
prOVlde conditions most
favorable for Creative In»
terchange. “It we cannot solve
the problem oi enabling men to
live together with the power oi
modern technology in a world oi
diverse cultures, we shall an-
Iiihilatethehuman race."

Does Mr, Wieman see any signs
that Creative interchange is
developing? “There are several
hopetul signs, but we can have
no assurance that these will lead
to more Creative Interchange.”
Wieman cited increased concern-
for the poor, the growing ten»
dency of nations to refrain from
war (largely because of the big
nations' recognition of each
other": power), increasing
recognition of the need {or
economic, political, and other
interchange with the Communist
world, growing discussion be
tween blacks and whites over
recognition of the status of Negro
Americans, and the recognition
that students should participate
more in the process of their
education. These signs indicate
to Wieman that “either we are
doomed or headed for something
better than the past." They are

neither all bad nor all good, “but
they hold the potentiality for both
good and bad results.” The mere
recognition of such problems and
diiicrcnces is a step in the right
direction, according to Wieman.

What can the United States do
now to help create a good at»
mosphere for Creative In-
terchange’! “First, we Should get
out of Vietnam. All we are
gaining by our involvement there
is a talse notion of prestige;
we could Withdraw much more
quickly than we are." Another
step would be to open com-
munication with Communist
Cuba. Wieman believes that the
present policy is only driving
Cuba closer to the Communist
black. “There is an insane hate
and [ear or Communism. Surely
it is a bad system, but the only
way to correct it is to open
Communication." Internally the
United States has done a fairly
good job in Wieman‘s opinion.
“For one thing we are
recognizing the need to educate
all men, I don’t think integration
is going to solve the problem oi
educating Negro Americans.
Blacks would like to join the
society as equals, not as his
feriors, so the first task should
be to improve their school
systems.”

“The United States needs to
recognize that its problem is not
to produce wealth, but to develop
the mentality, the sociality, and

the creative energy which will
promote Creative Interchange,"
wieman noted that many ex-
periments are now going on in
American Education One of the
great problems is how to educate
those Students With low IQ'S. Mr.
Wieman believes they can be
taught, but just what and how
he is not sure. “Education should
quicken a student‘s mind so that
he can think [or himself and
develop as an individual."

What is Wieman‘s opinion of
the current student power
movement? “Students should he
encouraged to express their
views to the faculty, but I think
they should not dictate the course
of their education.” Mr, Wieman
believes that the reason for all
the turmoil on collcge campuses
today is that the old traditions
and habits necessary tor
governance of a college have
been to some extent left behind,
but that new traditions and habits
necessary lor governance of a
college with more student par-
tlcipation have not yet developed.
When such traditions develop
Wieman expects more
tranquility,

wiemaii reierred ti-eouently to
a transitional state, which he
believes American Society is
experiencing, This is generally
characterized by a decrease in
respect for a man‘s status, In his
opinion this could lead to a better
situation it, in place of such re-
spect, more respect for per-
sonality were developd. “Of
course in order for a society to
continue there will always need
to be some recognition and
respectioraman’sstatus.“

“Many in our time turn from
God to the universe as the major
concern of religion. There is a
tragic error. The universe as
known to the human mind is a
transitory vision. A thousand
years ago it was very different
trom what it is today. A thousand
years irom now it still be very
different from what it is today

The universe ls known to the
human mind as being con-
tinuously created by expanding
the range of data and creating
morc comprehensive theories.
Thus a knowable universe
emerges from out of the fullness
of being. This iniinite fullness of
being is an unfathomable
mystery forever beyond our
understanding. To call it God is
to claim to know something about
what is unknowahle, But
religious commitment to
Creative Interchange will expand
to the utmost what we can know,
can value, can control and will
resolve the conﬂicts that threaten
our existence."

ML Wieman has not written
any books for two or three years
although he has often been asked,
He cites time as the culprit and
leels he no longer has the
necessary energy. In the future
he intends to relax, think, and
migrate to a warmer climate

Attempting to deal with the
problem of parity of wages and
job opportunities for women,
the Union proposed that job
categories be established along
with the qualification and the
pay tor that job. The proposal
reads: "when a vacancy ac;
ours in any job, the College
agrees to post such vacancy
and allow bids for a period of
four days among the em-
ployees. The applications re-
ceived shall be considered on
the basis of seniority, provided

now this mob of cretins at
Wrigley Field is purportedly
doing it to all the outiielders on
visiting tcains. They want to win
that badly. . .Then the whole
game is going to hell.

Shit: I was wondering. . .irthat
is worse as an indication than
those scorcboards that light up
and shoot on rockets in all
directions. The Astrodome is like
the seventh pit of Hell. ,.

MML: Showbiz. Now, who's
responsible [or that . . .well, i
think it still goes back to the way
the Yankees exploited Ruth and
built the game around him.

But then Bill Veeck picked it
up and. , .I don't know Mr
\Vi-iglcy very well, But I imagine
that, if he’s the hard-nosed old
gcnt that he's supposed to be, that
he won’t put up with another year
oi that crap. Because, as much
as he may appreciate what
Dul‘OChel‘ did [or that club, he
can’t have forgotten that they
blew it. He must have hurt. Don’t
forget, they had a [at lead right
lo the end. . ,He almost had to
work to blow that lead. Granted
that the Mets got hot when the
Cubs got cold 7 I’ll grant you
that, but there are all these other
things that play into it. The Cubs
are supposed to have been an
extremely tired ball club, . .going
out too much, too much nightlife,
too much being lionized.

spilt: Too much T. V.?

MML: Sure. Dinners, T. v.
appearances: too much showbiz.

I think that in and of itself
baseball is a very beautiful
game. For one thing, it’s so
viSlble. . . that’s one thing I
particularly like about it, You
can watch it in a way that you
you can’t watch pro tootball
(which I like very much, too),
