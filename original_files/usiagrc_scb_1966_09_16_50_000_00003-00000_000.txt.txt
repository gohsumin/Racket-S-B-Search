Applications Snur

The annual tall meeting of the
presidents of the Associated
Colleges oi the Midwest (ACM)
was highlighted by a discussion
oi admissions procedures where
cooperative action would bene-
fit the member colleges,

Grinnell President Glenn Leg-
gett said that proposals are un-
der Consideration which would
allow a student to file a single
application and pay a single tea
to receive consideration by two
or more of the ACM schools of
his choice,

“We're all worried about the
problem of multiple applica-
tions." Leggett said. It is hoped
that common admissions policy
might relieve the applicant’s ex-
pense and time spent in apply-
ing to several schools. At the
same time it would relieve the
schools' expenses in processing
the applicatio . By asking the
applicant to indicate his preter-
ence oi schools. the colleges can
gain a better picture or the
number or accepted students
who will actually attend the ac-
cepting school in the tall.

Leggett said that he thought
a pilot program in common ad-
missions Would be forthcoming.

other topics discussed at the
conference held in Grinnell last
Sunday and Monday concerned
the progress and problems or
