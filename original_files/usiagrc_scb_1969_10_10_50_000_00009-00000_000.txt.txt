concerned citizens can devote
time and energy to the impor-
tant work of taking the issue
of peace in Vietnam to the lar-
361' community. “We call upon
all members or the university
community to support the mor-
atorium,” Fr 3 n k continued,
“and We commit ourselves to
organize this effort on our cams
pus and in the larger communv
ity. We ask others to join us."

Frank then discussed the ef-
iects of the war in Vietnam
upon the Grinnell conlniunity~
a loss of lives and a loss of
money for municipal projects.
He requested that “Grinnell in-
dicate to the President and the
Congress that now is the time
to end the confiicr."

councilman Jones spoke on
the resolution and introduced a
letter [mm the Grinnell Student
Committee on the Moratorium
on the war in Vietnam. The
committee requested the city
council’s approval to use down—
town park space to hold a rally
on October 15th. The rally will
include speakers irom the col-
lege Iaculty, college adminis«
tration and from the town of
Grinnell.

Jones requested an acknowl-
edgement oi the principle of
the Vietnam moratorium. "This
is a seriolls and rational at-
tempt to raise a discussion; not
a protest or a demonstration,”
he said. He cited that over 400
academic institutions have re-
spondedi t0 the Call and estimr
cited that two-thirds of the Grin-
nell College laculty and stu-
dents will participate in the
Moratorium. Jones stated that
the city councils acknowledge

.ment of the principle of the

Vietnam Moratorium would not
necessarily support the mora-
torium or Frank’s resolution,
but would "only recognize the
principle a! tree debate and dis-
cussion.”

After the council agreed to
place a two-hour limitation on
the use of Grihnell’s park,
Jones' motion was passed in
a unanimous chorus oi ayes.

A request by Frank that the
council recommend suspension
01 business in Grlnnell on Mora-
torium day was denied. The
council said it would leave to
individual business proprietors
the decision on whether to close
for the day.

Goliege Will Hire
Bookstore Gonsuitant
Before Expansion

The college will hire a praise
clonal bookstore consultant "to
get advice on management,

space, and operation before we
start expanding,” according to
President Glenn Leggett.

"Everybody's agreed til at
the Bookstore needs expanding,
but the question is when to pro-
ceed,“ Leggett said Tuesday.
"I’d like to have it finished by
the first of September next
year,"

"The trustees have approved
expansion of the Eookstore, but
haven’t given any money yet,”
he continued. "I think it: would
be best to get some expert
advice before we proceed."

Leggett said that he plans to
discuss the Bookstore with the
student senate, and said that
he will try to locate a protes-
sional consultant before the
trustees meet in Grinnell Nov.
1-2. He said that the Bookstore
Committee and Library Com-
mittee will also be involved in
planning the expansion.

Some 15 students picketed
outside the Bookstore Sept. 23.

from a present two-thirds to something higher.

(4) increasing the proportion of students who need little
or no financial aid from the college and thus de~
crease the amount of general college funds that
now has to be placed in the financial aids budget.

(5) Studying thoroughly the student and administrative
service budgets to eliminate any expenditures
which, though desirable, are not essential.

The Tnistees are aware that none of these‘iive suggestions ll
independent irorn the others. They hope that a carerul and objeo~
t‘ive study will be given to all or them and their implications for
one another. Questions or pedagogy, of admissions, of our obliga-
tions to minority students, of physical space, or student and tacnlty
weliare and morale generally are clearly involved in the study.
The Trustees believe that only the faculty, including the deans
and president, are protessionally knowledgeable enough to make
such a study. They ask the president to begin at once, with the
advice and cooperation ot the iaculty, the structuring oi a study
or pattern of studies, which will conclude in a series of alternate
recommendations to the Trustees in time for consideration at their
June 1970 meeting. For their part, the Trustees promise a thor-
ough and sympathetic consideration of such recommendations
and a continuing commitment to keeping this college among
that superior group of liberal arts institutions.

I have discussed the request of the Trustees with Deans Wall
and Walker, and in a preliminary way with the chairman of ills
raculty. the divisional chairmen, and representative staff persons.
The Executive Collncil has begun this study as to procedures and
options and will he conferring with departments in the near
future. ‘ .
