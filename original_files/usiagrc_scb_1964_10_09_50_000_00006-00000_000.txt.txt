Three Grime/l Students In South America

By Sue Johnson
/“This is one of the greatest
experiences of my life,” writes
Jeri Langham, one of three
Grinnellians who are currently
doing research in the Costa Ri—

can tropics under the Central '

American Program of the As~
sociated Colleges of the Mid-
west.

Langham, a biology major,
Willard Van Horne, a Grinnell
graduate who majored in Span-
ish Literature and minored in
sociology, and John Pojman, an
economics and Latin American
studies major, are three of the
sixteen students from the Mid-
west who will carry on such
research during the 196465 Se-
mesters,

The Associated Colleges of
the Midwest, founded in 1958,
is an association composed of
ten coeducational, liberal arts
colleges: Beloit, Carleton, Coe,
Cornell, Grimell, Knox, Law-
rence, Monmouth, Ripon, St.
Olaf. It is designed to increase
the educational effectiveness
and operating efficiency of its
members by means of such pro-
grams as me Central American
Program.

The Central American Pro-
gram is a cooperative, interdis-
ciplinary program of advance
training and research in tropi-

cal ecology- and related scien-
tific fields It includes separate
but related studies of the tropie
cal environment from t h e
points of view of biology, geolo-
gy, anthropology» sociology,
and economics.

Theaims of‘the program are
to provide an effective means
by which faculty members can
obtain background for contin-
ued research in Latin America
and to introduce able students
to field study in the tropics
while their plans for fields of
specialization are still fluid

The ACM began developing
this program several years ago
because of the feeling that the
development of tropical science
and scientists is an important
but negleéted aspect of United
States higher education,

Drr Kenneth A. Christiansen,
(biologY) and five others com-
prised the original survey team
which made a tour of Venezu-
ala, Columbia, Panama, Costa
Rica, Guatemala, and Southern
Mexico in search of the best
area for study. Costa Rica was
determined the most acces—
sible, diversified tropical en—
vironment with the most gov-
ernment cooperation, and eight
faculty members from the ACM
went down to determine the
type of program most suitable
for the purpose.

The general design of the pro»
gram was worked out. by Dr.
Robert F. Voertman, associate
professor of economics at Grin—
nell. A fieldrresearchrseminar
program provides for investiga-
tion, and a group of tropical
scientists with significant ex~
perience'is available to serve
on the resident staff. The pro—
gram'is financed by a grant
from the National Science
Foundation, which is matched

in part by funds from non-Fed-
eral sources,

The entire Central American
Program lectures, basic
reading, and interviews of peo-
ple in the fields — is conducted
in Spanish, in which all three
Grinnellians are exceptionally
fluent. The participants begin
the program with preparation
on campus in the language, a
study of the area from the point
of view relevant to their fields
of interest, and outlines of their
research projects Upon arrival
in San Jose, they begin a six
weeks orientation program, af—
ter which they begin their field
Work and analytical reports,

Five students are in Costa
Rica for the first semester
(July 8-December 18, 1964), six
will be in Costa Rica for the
second semester (January 18-
June Ill), 1965), and five of the
students will participate in the

 

program for the entire year.
All but two of the students are
living with Costa Rican fami-
lies; the remaining two elected
to live in the pension.

The first project of field re-
search this year was a study of
biological and economic fea—
tures of pasture dairying as
practiced in Costa Rica.

For his individual project,
Langham, who will be in Costa
Rica for this Semester, chose
designing a field of methodoloe
gy for a reconnaissance study
of vegetational cover and land
vegetation in a series of eight
life zones

Van Horne, who will remain
for the whole year, is doing a
sociological study of the "hu-
aquero" in Costa Rica.
aquero" are men who engage
in excavating the contents of
pre-Colombian Indian graves,

“Hui

 

with or without government liv
censes, for gold and saleable
articles.

Pojman, while doing an ana-
lysis of the pasture dairying
study, is examining the possi-
bility of a research project on
meat production in relation to
the life zones. Pojman will also
participate for the full year.

Members of the ACM hope to
expand the Central American
program, both in numbers and
in the variety of work to be
done, and to begin a series of
on-campus research programs
to assist or correlate with the
field of studies. With expansion,
the program will help build up
a broad interest in and under-
standing of Central American
affairs and will increase the
information presented to the
students and faculty about our
neighbors in the South.
