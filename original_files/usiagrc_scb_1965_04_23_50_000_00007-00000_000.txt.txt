Only to Drop Two laierjn Week

The Grinnell baseball team
started the conference season by
first winning u doubleheader on
Saturday and then losing a double~
header on Tuesday. The Pioneers
beat the Monmouth team twice on
some tight pitching and some gifts
from the Monmouth pitchers. The
Pioneers could only muster two
hits in the doubleheader but still
won 32 and Hi. The SECOnd game
was a nohitter by Denny Hanssen.

Against Cornell the Pioneers again
could only get two hits but this
time they were not so fortunate
and lost 1-0 and 24).

Against Monmouth the Pioneers
scored all their runs on walks and
errors. in the first game the Mon-
mouth pitcher Walked six batters
in the rourth inning to give Grin-
nell its three runs. Monmouth
scored in the first on an error,
Itolen base, sacrifice, and a single
and once in the fifth on a walk and
I long double to left. Dave Schulz
went all the way for the Pioneers
on the mound allowing seven hits,
striking out four, and walking only
two.

in the second game Grinnell
scored the only run of the contest
in the second inning on an error
and three walks. No other Pioneer
runner, though, was able to get
past second base. Vern Robinson
had the only hit of the game, a
sixth inning single.

Denny Hanssen, in pitching his
no»hirter. overpowered Monmouth
with his fastball. He struck out 10
and allowed only four walks. Mons
mouth had seven baserlmners, two
of which gut to third, but Denny
was tough in the clutch and choked
out all [he rallies.

Against Cornell the pitching was
almost as good but unfortunately
the Pioneers could not push across
any runs. Grinnell again only got
two hits in the doubleheader but
this time the opponents did not sup-
ply the Pioneers with any gift
runs.

Dave Schatl pitched the first
game at Cornell and only gave up
four hits but the Rams nicked him
for an unearned run in the first on
two hits and an error and that was
the end of the scoring for that
game John Shierholz got the nnlyl

 

Pioneer hit in the sixth and in that
inning was the only Grinnell runner
to get in third in the entire ball
game.

Denny Hanssen pitched the sec-
ond game and gave up only four
hits but was beaten by two un-
earned runs in the lourth inning.

The Pioneer hit in this game was
notched by Mike Smiler. Again in

only one runner, .lohn Shierhulz, to
third base.

SCARLET AND RACK

—:- Animal Life -:-

After the wild success of the
BurnstineGrossman scene from
Arthur Miller’s After the Fill in
the coffee house last Saturday
night, the 1M chairmen have
caught the “coffee house fever." 1
don't Want to let the cat out of the

'bag, or anything like that, but now

in the planning stage is an exhibi-
tion lM softball game to be put
on there. The field dimensions will
be somewhat abbreviated because

of the limited space, and there will
be certain ground rules — like
anything through a plate glass win-
dow is an automatic home run.
The cover charge will be $32.50 per
person, mostly to covcr the cost
of damages. i understand one of
the most immediate problems is
figuring out how to protect the
pitcher from being clobbered when
the batter swings.

If the exhibition softball game is
successful, and undoubtedly it Win
be, it will ripen the door to I Vir-
tually endless array of possibilities
for our magnificent, john-size u-
presso palace. Alrmdy in the plan-
ning stage is an idea to make the
coffee house the green oi a 10th
hole addition to the gait course.
One clever Grinnellian has sug-
gested that we not call it a green.
but rather a red. (Keep calm, you
young Republicans — he’s now

 

being investigated by the John
Birch Society). The tee~oif area
will be on the 10th avenue softball
field, and the 1M golfers will fol-
low an interesting route over
Cowles, through Darby, and into
the Forum, Sorry. lovers, this new
course addition is strictly for the
use or our golfers.

Who knows what the future may
hold? Perhaps as each season
comes upon us, we may see in the

coffee house no football, volley-
ball. basketball. howling, or, if the
coffee cups are enlarged or little
bit, swimming.

But getting to events at hand
—— softball is developing into quite
an open scramble, As or this writ-
ing, the only two undefeated teams
are Clark and East. i suppose if
things keep up the way they have
been, the winner of the Clark—
East game may very well deter-
mine the winner of_the softball
crown. Actually, of course, as the
result of our tnmendout field fa-
cilities, the winning 1M team will
turn out to be the one with the
most experienced mountain climb-
ers and spelunkers,

And with IM golf soon to be
played. 1 leave you with that oh!
quoted sentiment: “To each red
rose yondery Bees leave our sweet-
est scents."
