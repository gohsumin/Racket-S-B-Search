kinds for whom I could make
Macbeth little more than a good
murder mystery, but I also
had students who could compose
original .onnets which dericd
Cri Clsn’i. When I was not
teaching, i was granted a taste
of teachers’ typical “extra”
duties.

0n the whole my experience
at this school was highly grnti.
lying and quite “untraumotic'n
The only problem I encountered
was convincing the teachers and
students who patrolled the halls
that l was a teacher. Rarely
could I travel through the halls
without hearing the challenge,
“Hey, kid! Where’s your pass?"

The shift from the ﬁrst school
to the second took me irom
the outer to the inneracity, lrom
a middle class environment to
a lower class one. I ieit a
heterogeneous student body ior
an athegro student body, high-
Calibre teachers for mediocre
ones, an erricient administration
ior a chaotic one, and excited.
cooperative students for ape»
thetic ones. > .

Obviously. my unotiicinl wei-
come to this school could not
be considered typical or Chicago
slum schools. Yet, this school
had its share of other sadly
typical problems.

I had heard that the students
or such schools, like so many
widgets being cranked through
an assembly line, could be autos
matic‘aily promoted (ram grade
to grade and deposited in the
world with diplomas in hand
but very little learning in their
brains. Meeting seniors who
could not identity verbs or write
complete sentences proved it to
be true. Former teachers had
given up trying to tight the
obstacles; the only remaining
aim was. at all costs, to get
the students through the system.

Huge enrollment created sev-
eral major problems at this
school. For one thing, it was
next to impossible for the dd-
ministration or the racuity to
ireep tabs on 4000 students, and
consequently the truancy prob-
lem was staggering. The school
administration had great diiii»
culty in keeping so many stu-

icl‘icoi building, and occasion-
ally gang members entered the
building to intimidate teachers
and students Even students
who had had no actual Con-
tact with the gangs round right-
ing a commonplace I had to
stop one light in my own class-
room and I saw altogether too
many others in and around the
school.

The greatest problem I en—
countered woe student apathy.
Most students had nothing rrom
life so tar and could envision
nothing better in the future
They had little time for learn-
ing, and could not see He
point anyway They were con-
vinced their color had mom
trapped in the ghetto. As one
of my students remarke ' “Why
should I learn to write? I don’t
plan to write another word or-
ter I get out of hero unywny,‘

Already my account oi the

slum school is terribly pessi~
mislic, despite the inn that I
haven’t exhausted the list of
its problems. i want to em-
p‘noslze however that my ex—
perience or this school was every
bit as valuable as that I had
in the outer-city school, pri-
marily because it was the only
school that alerted me to al-
most every obstacle a teacher
can encounter.

In my opinion, practice-teach
ing was the most valuable part
at the ACM Urban Semester pros
gram, because it afforded its
participants the chance to test
themselves in the race of a
variety of teaching conditions.
However, the Urban sociology
and Urban Education lemlnars
which supplemented our teach-
ing experiences were also vul-
uable. as was the experience
or living in Chicago for {our
months.
