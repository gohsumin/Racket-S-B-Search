Crandall Won't 60

Grant Crandall has been named A
recipient or the Rhodes Scholarship
which provides ior study at the Univcra
sity of Oxford for men from specified
areas overseas. Crandall is one or thirty-
two American men who were awarded
this scholarship tor excellence in scholas—
tic attainment, spirit, qualities of man-
hood, truth, and courage, success in mark
iy outdoor sports, and instincts to lead.

Due to his dmrt status, Crandall will
not be able to immediately accept the
scholarship and could forfeit it altogeihv
er. It Crandall were to accept the sclioa
larship, he would "almost certainly" be
drained within the year. objecting to
the war in Vietnam, he has elected to
join the Peace Corps and will be going to
Lesotha to do agricultural extension work
later this summer. i-ioperully, his drait
board will grant him a 2A status.

Delays on accepting the scholarship
are given only {or military service. Be-
cause at least one hall oi the Ameri-
can recipients are having severe diart
problems, military related situations
such as the Peace Corps and Vista may
also quality ror delay. it when he coma
pletcs his Peace Corp service the war
in Vietnam is not over, Crundali's con-
aidering leaving the country or going to
jail. In either case he would iorleil his
scholarship.

According to Pentagon statistics six
times as many college students are being
draited this year as compared to last.
Crandall emphasized that his case was
not unique and that most seniors are
having equal difﬁculty in adjusting their
lives around the drart.

Affairs Committee Acls on Housing

By TONI TRIPLE”

in a series of tour meetings, the Stu-
dcnt Atiairs Committee recently made
a number of signiﬁcant policy recom-
mendations. The rirst, dealing with next
year‘s allocation oi the (our college
owned on campus houses, came aiter in-
tel'VlewS With five student groups who
had submitted proposals Ior committee
evaluation.

Taking into account such factors as
innovations, degree or expressed stu-
dent interest, and expected academic
value, the committee recommended that
a co—ed German language group, an Ain-
erican Ioiklore pl‘DyeCK, and a co—ed edu«
cational experiment — the inner Col-
lega — be granted use or the houses. Be-
cause or the anticipated Size oi the Inner
College group, that project was given the
use oi two houses.

These recommendations are not final,
however, and are ultimately subject to
space considerations now being com-
puted by the Dean's Dilice.

Applications ror those students wishing
to live in private on campus housing
next year were due March 15. Mrs. Low
reported that sixty»tive applications were
received by her orricc at that date.

The committee received the report 0!
on ad hoc Residence Hall Planning Com-
mittee (chairman, Doug Ensminger)
and approved the recommendation for
increasing the availability of the co-ed
option. Assuming the existence or funds
ror partial renovation, Loose hall next
year will be a wad dorm with men and
women living on separate ﬂoors or in
adjoining wings.

The student members at the commit-
tee, Tom Thomas, Heather Foote, and
Lee Mani, noted the widespread student
discontent over the content of the cob
lege's contract with SAGA Food Services

Cops on
Campus

By TED CLICK

Saturday night there was quite li stir
among students caused by the presence
ol what seemed like the entire Gx‘lnnell
police rorcc on the Grituicll College cam<
pus. Rest assured, students. The Police
State has not yet Come to Grilinell; this
over-presence or the police was more a
misunderstanding and, as Miss Georgia
Dental put it, a “comedy of errors" than
a conscious attempt py Chier Peters and
his men to intimidate the Grllinell Stu-
dent body.

At some point early Saturday night
there was some minor trouble among
visitors irorn Des Moines. As a precalb
tionary measure, and because there were
to police at the dance in Gardner
Lounge, Ernest Weston inquired about
having a policeman present.

it seems that there was a large amount
oi activity as a result of this request.
Mrs. hawk, director or the Forum, upon
hearing or Westan's request, called Doug
Ensmlnger, R, A. in Younker, and Elis-
minger went to Gardner to check on
the situation. Dale Hawn, director of the
Physical Plant, was also notiﬁed of Wes-
ton's desire tor a policeman. An elec-
trician, working at Gardner, also an
auxiliary policeman, went into uniiorm
alter Weston's request. Hawn then called
Fred Grandstalf. chiei of the auxiliary
police, and three additional auxiliary
policemen, above the two already at
the Forum and [he electrician at Gard—
her, were put into action.

The incident as conveyed to Grandstair
indicated to him that there was a condi-
tion or near»hysteria among the students.
Instead of the officer Weston had re-
quested, there were six policemen roving
around the campus, at times all or
them together and at times three at each
dance. All six were not regular police
but rather auxiliary police, townspeople
who volunteer their services tor the good
or the community

in discussing the policy or having town
oiiiuals at Campus activities, Grinnell
Police Chief Peters Said, "I have 3,200
people to take care or in this town. i
don’t want to go up there. l’d rather let
the college he."

would pass," Sieger said, although h-
did nuL vote for the motion

Stegcr believes that the decision
“threatens the ROTC program at Grin-
hell, but not directly,"

“It doesn't break the contract, but it
will tend to make the program less via<
hie," Stegcr explained.

Steger added that he was “In complet-
Iccord" with the taculty motion estoh-
lishlng a committee to review the ROTC
program at Grinncll.

Wall said that faculty members en-
gaged in “very good debate" over tho
Guroir motion. "It was pretty rational
and well thought out," he said.

Sieger and USAF Capt. Philip 0. Fur-
dom participated “very little" in the de<
hate, according to Wall. “They answered
some questions,” Wall said.

Wall said he thought professors voted
(or the Gurolf motion for “a great
variety or reasons,"

“Some were just in opposition to tho
existence or the military on campu
Others were hopeful that the motion
would result in a rethinking or currlclh
Tum," Wall speculated,

Protessors voted against the motion tor
“a great variety of reasons also,” he
Said. “Some thought it didn’t go far
enough and some thought there hadn't
been an adequate study. Others thought
it was essentially a departmental matter
while others were opposed to the who].
idea because they lilte the status quo."

Asked about his personal leeliligs in re-
gard to the faculty’s actions on the Gus
roli motion, Wall replied, “I'm satisfied,
particularly coupled with the Kissane mo<
lion."

Wall said he has “mixed feelings"
about whether the military should bu
allowed on campus at all.

Gumii said he made the motion be.
cause “the ROTC program stands out-
side the regular program of the col-
lege."

“Now Is the time for the Air Force
to tell us why there should be a ROTC
program at Griiinell and why it warrants
credit, and then let us decide,” Gumﬂ
Commented.

“Given the pasi history of Grinnell,"
Guroli said he was surprised that his mo.
tion was approved. “The faculty is not as
resistant to change as some oi the
younger ioculry had believed"
