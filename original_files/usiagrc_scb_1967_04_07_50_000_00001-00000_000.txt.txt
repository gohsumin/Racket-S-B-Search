Controversy surrounds confused issues
concerning change in theatre directorship

News Analysis
By John Wiles

"The recent resignation of Richard D.
Meyer, director of theatre, is represen-
tative both of a complete shake-up nnd
changeover of personnel in the Grlnltell
College theatre and of an impending

department bear direct relation to and
will have a significant effect upon the
Ontire college community.

Recognition of tlie eminence, as well
as the imminence. of those effects has
aroused considerable studentrfaculty in<
wrest in the facts and issues involved in
these theatre developments. A decided
lack of clarity and consistency in the
Bommunication of said facts and issues.
however, has resulted in markedly Corr
Med impressions of the entire situation.

Controversies have arisen from the
contradictory natures of the following
reported facts: 1.) that Meyer did him-
self, or his own volition, resign, yet ex-
pressed, as well as firm conviction, an
admittedly unhappy reluctance to do so;
2.) that administrative officials respond-
ed with frank regret to their acceptance
oi Meyer’s resignation, yet had admitted-
ly neither invited nor expressly encours
aged him to continue as director of
theatre; 3.) that Meyer's withdrawal of
his application ior director — and also
his eventual resignation —- appear to
have been inseparably related to his oc-
cupation of an unavoidably awkward po-
sition as principal interviewer of all oth-
er candidates — and, therefore. of his
own competitors —« for the directorship
appointment.

It has since proven relatively impos-
lible for The Reporter to ascertain com-
plats explanations for, or to acquire sat-
isiactory Clarifications of these ques-

E oven faculty members to lea e

Eleven Grinnell faculty members will
be quitting their posts at the end oi
this year. They are Thomas H. Charl-
ton (anthropology), Kenyon Knopf (econ-
omics), Oliver Luther (Spanish), Richard
Meyer (theatre), Mario E. Ruiz (Sloane
15h), Thomas Somerville (speech and
theatre), David A. Sutherland (music),
Miss Edith A Sternield (arr), Bruce R.
Thomas (physics), and Marion G. Van-
fossen (sociology). Ned D o n a h o a
(speech and dream), now on leave of
absence, tentatively will not return to
Grinnell.

Bruce Thomas

Bruce Thomas, Assistant Professor of
Physics since September, 1965, is leav-
ing Grinnell after this semester to take
I teaching post at Carleton.

Thomas, whose primary interest is
elementary particles, hasn't been able
to do research here due to lack of
time and Grinnell's isolation. A! Carle<
too, he explained, his lighter classioad
(one class per trlmester) and the in-
terests represented in Carleton's physics
department will allow him more oppor-
tunity for independent work.

Thomas expressed no great dissafis
faction with Grinncll as compared to
Carleton. “The basic commitments of
the two schools are very similar and
they're facing the same problems -—-
problems of student culture, curriculum,
and educational philosophy," he ex.
plained.

Regarding the special problems con—
fronting undergraduate science curricula
and students, Thomas said, "The status
of a science major at a liberal arts
school is under review because the
amount of major-ﬁeld instruction needed

to compete with the universities fill!
the students' time.” He attributed tho
necessity for a heavy course load to
the rapid rate of scientific development.
Citing solid-state physics as an example,
he noted that fifteen years ago it was!
a relatively minor ﬁeld; now, a largo
percentage of physics research mane]
is channeled into solid-slate work,

A 1980 Grinnell graduate, Thomul
earned his doctorate at Comell Univer-
sit .

y David A. Sutherland

David A, Sutherland (music) hﬂl
resigned, due to a change in the dines
tion of his career which will requlm
post-graduate work. Presently is musl-
colngist, he plans to enter the fleld ol
ethnomusicology.

When asked to comment on student
life, Sutherland stated that although he
has experienced some student irresponsi-
bility and realizes that all institution
must act in a considerate manner to-
ward the society oi which it is a part,
he nevertheless takes what he under-
stands to be the liberal position on in:
question of open dorms and other issue:
vital to the student body.

Says Sutherland, “The more responsi-
bility is heaped on the student, tho
more responsible he will be."

Thomas Charlton

Thomas H. Charlton (sociology and
anthropology) has resigned his assistant
professorship at Grinnell to take q
similar position at the University of
low.

Charlton, who will finish the semester
at Grinnell, cited greater opportunity
