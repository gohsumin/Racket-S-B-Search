Donahoe Outlines leMoyne Stay;
Wants Greater Faculty, Exchange

sy Pam Clay

Ned Donahoa (speech and
theatre) is back on the Grin-
nell campus after spending last
semester teaching at LeMoyne
College, Memphis, Tenn. Don-
ahoe said that he hopes more
Grinnell Iaculty will be able to
go to Le‘Moyne and that some
LeMoyne faculty can come to
Grinnell.

Ha lelt that‘his semester at
LeMoyne was a great learning
experience for all concerned
Ind said enthusiastically, "I
wish I were back."

Donahoe's wife and his
daughter accompanied him to
the Negro college with which
Grinnell has an exchange pro-
gram. His seventh — grade
daughter was tutored by col-
lege students rather than at~
tending the public school there.
Scott, the Donahoe's high-school
nged son, stayed here in or-
der to aid the Grinnell high
school basketball team. .
l “I asked that we live on
campus,” said Donahoe. “Much
of the faculty lives in an area
called White Haven, but I
wanted to be easily accessible
to the drama students."

He said that throughout the
semester ﬁle number of stu-

 

had increased and he was de-
cidedly please that he had chos-
en to live on campus.

Dunahoe taught in o d is rn
drama, world literature, and
speech. The speech class was
composed primarily of students
planning to teach who wanted
experience in communicating

“My main job was to make
recommendations as to wheth—
er a drama program was feasv
ible or not,” he said “There
are no dorms at LeMoyne, it
is a ‘streetcar college’ and this
greatly complicates the produc-
tion of a play. The play was
necessarily prefabricated, We
had to work with small sections
whenever the students could get
together and lit the play togeth-
er at the end."

Donahue was told that only
eight people would turn out to
see the play, The Flies. by
Jean Paul Sartre, but. it ran
four nights. ‘

"There was lots or enthusi.
asm there for something worth»
while and lots of untapped dra»
matic ability,’ he said. ,

There is nc permanent dra-
ma program at LeMoyne but,
because of the quality and
quantity of response to the play
he produced, Donahue is writ-
ing and urging that they do in—
augurate a permanent pro-

Thomas Describes
leave in Pakistan

By Anne Fnrror

Returning from an 18 month
leave in Karachi, Pakistan,
Philip S. Thomas, (economics)
rather succinctly sums up the
whole of his experience when
he says he “loved itr"

Besides doing a good deal of
research in the area of inter-
national economics for the
Pakistan Institute of Develop-
ment Economics, Thomas may
also accomplished a new first
for a Grinnetl professor—vhe
was featured in a spread for
Life magazine, which anyone
must admit is a bit of a jump
from the 8&1}.

While vacationing in Kash-
mir, as did the Mogul emper-
ors when they needed to get
away from it all, the Thomas
family happened to bump into a
Life photographer who was
hunting for an American fam-
ily which he could photograph.
and so the photographer had
his pictures and the Thomases
had B "lot of fun.”

Not a newcomer.to the area.
having.worked as a Fulbright
scholarin New. Delhi, Thomas
went to Karachi with the ex-
pressed desire to master the
Irdu language, worked diligent-
ly an hour a day for several
months on it, and was some»
what dismayed to discover that
English is the official language
used in all economic writing
there and Sind is the language

on the problem of importation
