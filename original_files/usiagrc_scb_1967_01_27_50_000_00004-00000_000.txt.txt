) Building

a 24 it. high gymnasium build-
ing connected to a pool building
by several smaller buildings.
The pool is to be built in a
cruciform shape With one length
which meets U.S. standards and
one which meets International
standards. it will be three times
the size iii the present swim-
ming pool, and about five feet
in depth ill ali parts except the
diving area: this is supposed to
facilitate instruction as well as
cut down on initial and main-
tenance expenses.

The gym will be divided into
three sections, anti the center
section walls extend to the ceil-
ing in order to make each room
sound proof.

The floor will he made of a
plastic material called Tartan
which is more durable than
wood ﬂooring so that ii cannot
be damaged by the use of
cleats. Although the initial ex-
pense will be more than for a
wood tloor, maintenance costs
are supposed to be much lower.

Piamiing oi the bitilding has
largely been the work of a com-
mittee composed of the archi-
tects, Mr, Plitsch, Miss Anna
Mae Wack, Mr. Raymond J.
Obermiller, Mrs. Alice Low,
Mr. Edgar R, Mullins and, stu-
dents Richard Wickstrom and
Nancy Loes. President Glenn

there is no notion or reinstating

Mr. Leggett doesn’t foresee an
undue emphasis or “p e." "our
central focus is in no danger
of sliiiting to physical educa.

has gone too far the other way
in past. years # to academics:
Students do not get enough exo

No official decisions have
been made about what to do
with Darby, the Women’s Gym
and the swimming pool, There
are no immediate plans to tear
any or them down. One proposal
was that Darby serve as the
central dining tacility, but it was
round to be stmcturaily inade-
quate. For the same reason, it
would he diﬂicult to conver
Darby into an auditorium. i
will probably be used for in‘
formal recreation, Mr. Pfitsoli
says. The Women's Gym may
become a museum, and the
swimming pool may be built
into the new women’s dorm.

(Io-Ed Housing
Opens at Texas U

A coeducational “college
house" has been established
and operated by University oi
Texas students who were dis-
satisfied with dormitory and
fraternity living. Built with
money from a private founda-
tion and with the consent 0!
the dean of students, the stu-
dents opened the air-campus
living quarters in which they
make their own rules and 5&4
lect residents. The “house" is
a complex of buildings with
coeds and men usually in sep-
arate buildings and a profes-
sor and his family in each
complex.

Influence of the house may
be seen in that the university
no longer requires students We
ing off-campus to stay ill ap4
proved housing and the school
has approved plans for all one

iory.
