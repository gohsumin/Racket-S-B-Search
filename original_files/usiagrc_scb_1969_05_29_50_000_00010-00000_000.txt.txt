Human Biology Seminar — A New Approach

By RON STEINHORN

The seminar in human biology was
first created by Sheldon Parzen to be
a new Approach in leaching various
topics in biology. This year's Science I
sequence for example was based around
the general theme ”evolution ot strut»
lure," and had been less than success-
ful in arousing interest, a: have all the
introductory biology sequences tried here
during the past several yearn. In con~
tmst, the idea of the human biology
course is to organize the traditional
topics or biology; genetics, embryology.
anatomy, physiology. ecology, evolution,
microbiology, and others around their
presence in the human being. The great
advantage at this presentation in an in-
troductory biology course is that interest
can be easily created since the appli-
cation of biological ideas to the stu-
dents themselves is always at the fore
iront. For the non-blo—majnl' in particular
this is useful, because only in this way

is knowledge of tile subject likely to be
useful to them in the future.

To see whether this would be a good
way oi organizing a future course, this
past semester about twelve juniors and
seniors participated in what was Called
the "human biology seminar," which
met with the Parzens every week at
their home. Not everyone in the seminar
was a biologist. One was in psychology
and another in American Studies. As
timo went on, it became obvious that

these ditierent perspectives on the hu-
man being were extremely important tor
the group.

At the slant, the group made a plan of
topics to be covered The general format.
01 a session was that one or several peo:
ple would report on certain of the select-

» ed topics. This worked out so that each

person reported every three or four
weeks. The presentations always pro.
volred much discussion and reaction and
the seminar invariably lasted for about
three hours each time as the result of
the reaction the reports provoked This
bore out the initial feeling that it would
not be necessary for everybody to pre‘
pare material or read for all the ses-
sions, since most of the members had
background! extensive enough so thst
the inmrmation was not without refer-
ence to subjects previously studied.

it is sate to say that everyone who was
in the seminar tell it was a great suo<
cess. Those who had a lot of biologi-
cal training before saw new aspects and
applications of areas previously studied
while the non-biologists felt, perhaps
for the first time, the means and extent
to which biological pmcesses influence
and control our lives These factors,
along with the intense discussion and ex<
cilement which were always present and
which are the mark of any meaningful
learning experience make a course in
human biology seem a real alternative
to traditional ways of biological teaching.
