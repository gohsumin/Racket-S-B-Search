Comment on Faulwell column

To the Editor:

There are certain things about Bond
Fauiwell’s article “0n Irresponsible
Protest" (April 22) that i find quite
disturbing. it seems that he has hardly
thought through his reasons for sup-
porting the Administration's policy in
Vietnam.

First, Mr. raulwell mentions that
the campaign or Mr. Richard Gott, an
antiwar candidate in Great Britain,
was instrumental in changing his he.
lists on Vietnam. 1 do not disagree
with the slow, dritting escalation of
the wars in Vietnam and Thailand
because George Lincoln Rockwell is
her it, nor should I be expected to em-
brace President Johnson: opinions just
because Bettina Aptheker opposes them,
After examining my philosophy, beliefs,
and prejudices, as well as those of the
"experts," l have come to certain con.
clusions about my feelings and thoughts
regarding the war. which space does
not permit me to elaborate upon,
Which brings me to my second point.

You cannot line up and count "ex-
ports," prowar vs. antiwar, prosJohnw
son Vs. anti-Johnson, as Mr. Faulwell
suggests. You must listen to their
views. examine them for fallacies, and
see if thcy are consistent with your be-
liefs. Mr. Faulwell seems to feel that
because those "experts" that believe
th United States is doing the right
thing in Vietnam have the more impres-
sive credentials, he should believe them.
He also says that the “overwhelming ma»
jority (of experts) were from such dis-
ciplines as biology. chemistry, and Eng-
llsh." Hans ltlorganthau, u rhant, Rein-
hold Niebuhr, George Kennan, General
Gavin, Norman Thomas are “specialists
in international artairs and commu-
nism.” But i tear that I may be tailing
into the same trap that Mr. raulwell
has fallen into.

ﬁnally, 1 would like to discuss the
Speak Out, the National Mobilization,
and their relationship. The Speak Out
at Grinnell was not associated in any
way with the spring Mobilization Com.
nlittee to End the War in Vietnam, but
was only in conjunction with hand
Vietnam Week, April 3715. It is untor.
tunate that Mr. raulwell still confused
the National Mobilization with the sepa.
rate and quite independent speak Out
at Grinnell. The tenor was not the
same as that at the national protest,
and we did, “save ‘t trom mere l'epeti»
tion of tired rhet ' and we did try
to “put, it on a higher plane.” Each

speaker spoke on what he felt he was
most qualiﬁed to speak on, and we
tried to vary the subjects. I think the
speakers and the tenor of the Spca
Out were that of an “appreciation o
'grays’ instead or ‘hlacks’ and ‘\Vhites’.
1 think it is you, Mr. Faulwell, who
lack this appreciation

Cleaver on Faulwell

To the Editor:

I wish to point to two possible in!-
lacics in Mr. Bond Faulwell's column
on Vietnam.

1. Many "experts," he says, approvc
oi the war in Vietnam. Let us, there-
fore, be for it. too. Faith in the expert
_ the pro 7 has become the folk su-
perstition of the learned and the semi~
learned. The advice ot “experts” on all
matters, such as automobiles, sex, in-
tel'ior decoration, chitd.raising and
politics, ought to be heard. But to sur-
render to them one’s decisions on
questions ct such irighttul importance
as this war seems to me total and ab-
Ject abdication of one’s responsibility
as a human being. History provides
some sickening lessons of crimes that
whole peoples have committed on the
advice of their experts.

2, Experts in internaﬂonal alfairl
may be in a particular hind. Ponder
the assumptions behind the vocabulary
with which they work. Many political
scientists. in discussing the problem of
maintaining peace, seem to be stuck in
the presuppositions of nationalism.
Their historical model, apparently, is
the manner in which the Congress of
Vienna and the 19th century British
Foreign onicc accommodated their
plans to this nationalistic faith. As a
matter of fact, they don’t even call the
problem one 01 maintaining peace but
rather one of maintaining “national
security," “national honor,“ or “vital
interes ” One hardly needs mention
what tearsome slogans those have he-
