SCARLET 'AND BLACK

Varied Choreography, Live Music
Featured in Annual Orchesis Show

“Orchesis in Concert.” will
be a “varied Show” this year,
according to president Ellie
Smith, And much of the variety
will be as apparent in the ac-
companiment as in the demo
ing.

Accompaniment will feature
live musicians on stage as in-
tegral parts of some of the
dance numbers, an original per-
cussion piece composed es-
pecially for the Orchesis show,
electronic music, and readings,
as well as more traditional
forms. There will also be a
number in the show, a study in
pure movement, which will
have no accompaniment at 311.

Another feature of the show
will be a trilogy -— a series of
three dances, throughout the
program, done to the same
piece of music. In each of
these dances, the soloist is in
conflict with various elements
in the environment.

An udagio number and a bal-
let solo will also be featured.

Advance reservations will be
required for the show which
will be presented next Friday
and Saturday nights in Rob-
erts Theatre.
