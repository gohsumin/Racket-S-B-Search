DES MOINES, March 1 — A
windblown snowstorm swirled
into the state Wednesday, as
highways were painted with a
treacherous coating of ice

The Des Moines Register
reported Thursday that high-
ways in the Central and South-
central sections of Iowa were

“normal to 100
percent i c y
and snow - ca-
vered” — a
statistic cred-
ited to the
Iowa Highway Commission.

Three persons were injured
Wednesday when two cars col-
lided head—on after skidding on
o snow-packed stretch of us.
Highway 30, about three and a
shalt miles west of Jefferson.

Jodi Jensen, 11, or rural Hol-
stein, was listed in critical con-
dition with skull and facial frac—
lures.

Her father, Wendell, :il, sui-
fered a skull fracture of his
ﬁght leg. Cecil i. Oswood was
listed in fair condition with
head and face lacerations.

The U.S. Weather Bureau at
Des Moines told the Register
that weather conditions here for
the weekend are expected to be
similar to prevailing weather
today,

Asked by the 5&3 what the
record highs and lows for this
date were, officials of the Des
Moines paper (The Newspaper
Iowa Depends Upon) said they
ﬁdll‘l know.

High and low pressure cen-
ters met over Grinnell Thurs-
day ailernoon as fair and toul
weather enshrouded the state

LEGGETT PONDERS DORM CHANGE DETAILS
FEARS COLLEGE LACKS NEEDED FUNDS

By RUSSELL ELLIO'IT

It the College can come up
with the new finances needed,
we will probably be living in

.integraled campuses (a takeoff

on alternating dorms) under a
student ndvisor system this
tall.

Last September President Leg-
gett expressed the hope that
“when school opens next fall
the physical arrangement for
student living will at least be
started toward the promise of
being radically different"

Ron Cogswell, C of HP Presl-
den't, sees Leggett as being
“generally dissatisfied with the
present living situation."

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee (headed by the Deans of
the College and the Presidents
of SGA. the Coil-IF, and the
AWS Board) has been working
since September on problems in
the living situation at Grinneil
and possible solutions

on February 16, two weeks
ago, the Committee presented
Leggett with an extensive list
of recommendations which he
will bring before the Executive
Council of the Board of Trustees
early in March.

It Is expected that the T1154
tees will take ﬁnal action no
later than June.

PROPOSALS CITED
The recommendations included

"the integration of men’s and
women's Campuses, the initia-
tion of an allocampus room draw-
ing, the expansion at off-cam-
pus living options ior upper-
classmen, the establishment of
a student advising system, and
the continuation of an extended
resident advising system."

an integrated campuses the
Committee proposes that North
campus have women living in
South Younker, Smith, Langan,
Rawsou. Gales, and men in
North Younker, Cowles, Dibble,
Clark, and the Norrises.

South campus will have wo-
men in James, Cleveland, Main,
Mears, and men in Loose, Reno,
and ﬂames

Changes for which the Com-
mittee recommended that new
funds be allocated include en-
closure of the North campus
loggia trom south of Smith to
Gates, kitchenettes to be built
in the new women's balls on
North campus, and additional
lounge and recrroom furniture.

CO-ED LOUNGES

The Committee sees the com-
mon-use lounge between North
Younlier (boys) and South Youn~
ker (girls) as an exciting tiist
step towards “coeducational
halls at Grinnell."

The student advisor is to be
a paid worker who is responsi.
ble to his resident adviser and
who “should seek to work close<

ly with the da ~today function-
ing of the hal His main re-
sponsibility is to help under-
classmen in adjusting to college
life and its problems

A committee of resident ad-
visors, deans, and student gov-
ernment officials is to select
advisors for next year.

A weekend retreat and I
week of intensive preparation
immediately preceding the fall
semester are seen as opportune
ities for both student and resi-
dent advisors in developing
counseling skills.

These will be supplemented by
weekly sessions throughout the
school year.

STUDENT “ADVISORS”

A program incorporating in
student advisors is envisioned,
meaning there would be one stu-
dent advisor for every 15 stus
dents on campus. Also recom-
mended is the hiring of an ad-
ditional re5ldent advisor and
an intern, or part-time, resident
advisor, which would bring the
total number of R,A.’s to 10.

Another recommendation of
the Committee is “an all-cam-
pus raom drawing using a quota
system for fixing the number
or freshmen, sophomores, jun-
iors, and seniors in a given
hall.”

DETROIT, Feb 24 (LN§) -—
Members of the Wayne Statd
University Student Council rc.
signed Feb. 9 in protest of that
body’s powerless state in uni-
versity affairs,

The students believe that co<
operation between themselves
and the administration is un<
feasible while they are their
representative body have no
power.

The resignations stem from
the Radical Caucus held as a
counter-meeting to the National
Student Assn. conference last
summer. The caucus resolved
to urge campus disaffiliation
with NSA if NSA did not trans-
form itself into a student union
composed of individuals, rather
than elite delegations.

Predictably, NSA did not.

Students here especially want
control over ”student security"
—security files and the campus
police force.

Profiles on each student, In-
cluding such implicating
data as “political deviations”
and “homosexual tendencies,”
which the administration say!
were burned last year, students
here believe are still in exis-
tence.

In addition, students are pro-
testing the existence and ac-
tions of the campus cops, or
Department of Public Safety—
3 Iii-man force, all degree can-
didates in Police Administra-
tion, who patrol the campus
fully armed with clubs and pis-
tols.

The police also have, stu-
dents say, a small arsenal o!
rifles, shotguns, two-way ra-
