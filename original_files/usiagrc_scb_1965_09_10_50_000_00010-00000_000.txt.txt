i It's important for everybody to
go out and read this month's issue
of Esquire magazine, folks, bed
cause Esquire has just done what
we've all been trying to do for
years. They’ve iinaliy placed the
ﬁnger 0! understanding on the
pulse of the college generation.
Freshmen will especially value
this issue, as a guide to life more
than anything else, while uppel'r
classmen will simply decide
whether or not to have an identity
crisis over their ability to agree
with the editors’ conclusions.

In an effort to provide alternar
tives for anybody having particular,
trouble with Esquire's 28 College
Heroes, we here at Griniiell, in
the heart or the stodgy old Mldr
west, tar lrom the wlcked city,
proudly present the hrst annual
list of Grinnell Heroes. Here it is,
gang. just like it is. And remem-
her. it you don’t like it the way
