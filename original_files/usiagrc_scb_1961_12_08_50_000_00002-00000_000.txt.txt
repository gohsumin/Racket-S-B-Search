o muses oi the Christmas time,
An ardent plea to thee is made

For hClp wrtli this eighth Noel rhyme,
A nomenclature iusiliade.

We‘ll sing an opening balulalow
For Donald Jones and Richard Howe,
And synthesize a madrrgal

For James Kissane and Thomas, Phil.

Hark the Herald Angels‘cllol‘us
For Captains, Mandcville and Brunton, Morris,
And let them sing another one,

For M. M. Lieberman and son.

Klausncr, Kimtz and Mr. Allan
or Christmas cheer deserve a gallon
Served in dialectic mugs

And spilt on existential rugs.

For President Bowen we might accord

Another enormous grant lrom Ford

For Ludwig and Kautrnann when Christmas comes
Let their stockings bc stut'ied with attluent alums,

A test tube tilled with mistletoe
For Siiei‘ison. Oclke and Dantoi-th, Joe;
Hang fetal pigs upon the tree

For Walker. Mendoza and Kenneth G.

String popcorn kernels on a thread

For the Pileugerville Pilasli and Bowers, Edd;
And decorate the Girls gym track

18 times 'round for Cox, Leakc, Waclc

Drop the hornb and join the revel
In the shelter with William Nevill;

Everything is Dionysrari,

Winston King has had a vision

,Oi Buddha rising train the sedge

Along the silty river's edge

And screaming “On dancer and Prancer et. al.
(Good cheer to Joseph and Mrs. Wall.)

But up in the sky there arose sirch a clatter
The pentagon tried to examine the matter.
And sent up an Atlas assolilting the air-
Which lodged in the foot ot a reindeer there,
And only Cadet Colonel Letham must know
This topssccret origin oi “missile-toe"

Season’s greetings to the Brrrkles in Japan.

For Snyder and Ballick, a 5 ft. beer,

Bring Kennedy and Khrushchev here to debate.

Give a grit to Hoops and Neuhaus, Shirley

To the students for Peace, and leader, Curley,
And while we linger on agitation

Here's a meal tor the Washington delegation.

Round the tree in circles great
Run this Empowered heads of Statc,
The Three Big H's and Jill perform

For the athletic world of iock

We hang a sweaty Christmas sock

For Presidents 01 every hall

An organized, sanctioned Christmas hr-awl.

To the Editor:

Open Lcttel‘ to Mr. \Nilliom
Halama, President of the Grin-
nell Student Government Asso-

ciation.

Dear Bill: ‘

Student government at Grin.
nell has had to iace its first
major crisis in recent weeks.
While some oi the excitement
has died down, however, the has-
ic issue has not yet been decid—
cd. That is the question wheth-
er student government shall
have the right to express itself
on matters not directly related
to the welfare of students. Some
have felt that only campus idc
reierenda are the proper med.
ium ior the expression of stu-
dent opinion on national and in—
ternational issues. Others icel
that student otircers and Sans
ators. once elected, must have
the irecdom to vote as a body
and express themselves collecA
tively on any subject in which
they are vitally interested

In objecting to ircouent res
iereda. you have expressed
the tear that only a small min-
ority of students might turn out
to vote on a given issue. i would
consider this an argument a.
gainst tl’el‘lucl‘it senate I'esoluV
tioris it a rcterendum does not
give strong backing to a senate
resolution. this is an indication
that on that issue the senate
does not speak- tor the student
body Fol whom, then, does the
senate speak?

When senators argue that they
speak only ior themselves, 2 's
is either insincere or unrealistic.
When senate resolutions receive
widespread coverage in newspaps
ers, on radio and Tv, it is in
eilect taken by the public to
represent strident opinion at
Grinncll. After all. uhen the
senate makes repi ntations to
the college administration on
campus matters. it does mean to
speak for the student body. and
properly so. As the Preamble to
your Constitution states, "the
so A. , . . shall administer and
legislate rules pertaining to all
aspects of student litc, . Stu-
dent oiircers and senators are
elected for that purpose and one
ly with that purpose in mind.

II the senate is inclined to e »
press itseli irequently on issues
oi national and international
concern whrclr will tend to be
controversial and have no pare
ticular relevance to campus his,
then iutirre campus elections
will be run along pzll'ty lines,
Then a candidate will have to
identity himselt as a Republican.
a Democrat, a Liberal, or an
Alllel'iCa—Firstcr. This, you will
agree, would destroy student
government.

Student government should be
strong, It can be strong only it
it enjoys the respect and trust
of the student body. It can ens
joy this position only if it ex»
ercises those iunctrons ior which
