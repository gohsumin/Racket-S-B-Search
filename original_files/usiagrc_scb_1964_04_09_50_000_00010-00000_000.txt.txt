Endgame, One-Act Play by Sam Beckett
Inquiry into Basis Of Human Existence

Endgame, a oneract play by
Samuel Beckett, which con-
tinues the penetrating inquiry
into the very basis of human
existence of the better known
Waiting for Godot, will be pre-
sented as a theatre workshop
project in the Arena theatre,
Sunday, April 12 at 3::30 pin,
and at 8:00 pm and Monday,
April 13 at 8:00 pm

Centered about two charac-
ters, one blind and paralyzed,
the other, his halteson and ser-
vant, the drama explores the
conflicts and relationships be
tween these two as they exist
in an anonymous claustropho-
bic room, the last remnants of
civilization, the survivors, per-
haps, of a halocaust which has
destroyed all of society.

The dialogue of half-phrases,
unanswered questions, and
long pauses, so common to the
so-called “Theatre oi the Ab»
surd," portrays the characters
as they begin to realize the ri—
nal runningdown of their own
existence. It is as critic Martin
Esslin has termed it, “a drar
matic statement of the human
situation itself. . r .'

The cast for Endgame is:
Ken Coleman, Bill Grenzebach,
Eva v Gai’debring, and Robin

 

Konikow. The production was
directed by Sam Grossman, No
advance reservations are neces-
sary
