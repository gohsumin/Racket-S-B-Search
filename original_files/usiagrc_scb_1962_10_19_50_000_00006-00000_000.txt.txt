The ﬁred up hosts gave the
Grinnellialls their ﬁrst real ﬁght
of thc year by holding them to
the lone goal which was beauti—
lully cxccuted by Vincent Anku,
the leading Pioneer scorer.

The Grinnell offense was ullr
able to move the ball as well
as in the two previous matches.
This was because of the very
:strong MaCMul’r’dy iullbacks who

ithe Oles battle at Kno

both holding down second place in the MCAC w h 31
marks have only outside chances for the title.

Both men see the possibility of a Grinnell loss in
Carleton, SI. Olaf, or Cornell. “Don’t you think we‘ll
pmbahly heat Cornell?” I interjectetl. “I don’t know,”
h’ k said. “They’ve got a lot of sophomores and jllll‘

' 5 who, with a little experience, nl‘ 'ht be tough as

'15 by the last game.”

Carleton and St. Olal have almost identical schedules.
The only difference is that Carleton meets Lawrence While
. “Where is Carleton playing this
week?” risked Pfitsch‘. "Ill Olelrille,” replied Mickey, ill-
dicating that he thought Carleton would be knocked out
of the race in the collie ' The other two games for each
school are Grinnell and Monmouth.

A WORRIED LOOK came over Mickey’s face as he
retld oif the Kohtlwks remaining games with Cornell, Molk
mouth, Lawrence, and Beloit, “I can’t see Coe losing from
here on out,” he said, while Pfitsch nodded in agreement.

liipon too had a comparatively easy schedule playing
Lawl ncc, Cornell, Beloit, and Kn "So Lawrence plays
at Ripon this week,” I noted. ”Yes,” said Pfitsch, ”and
Ripon should win, but they’re shaky, and ii Laurence
plays them tight, they might fall apart like they did
against Coe."

'With the toughest remaining~ contests of any Coll<
[erellce club, meeting Ripon, Beloit, Coe, and Cilrleion,
both men expect Lawrence to lose at least one, but pick
the Vikings as (he most likely spoiler. “It certainly
would be nice to see Lawrence knocl off at least one
of the tough miles!" Mickey said optimistically. “Yes,
but we can‘t hope they‘ll go all the way,” l’filscll zldd—
ed. “because if We lose one, then the ll be in."

As the only undefeated team left in the Conference,
