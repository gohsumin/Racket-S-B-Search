Anku on Ghana Economy

By Vince Anku

This week I am dealing with
Ghana’s economic policy which
is alleged by some pseudo-ex-
pel-ts to be communistic, Next
Week We shall examine Ghana's
foreign policy.

There are five sectors in
Ghana's economy: " 1) In the
state’s sector enterprises are
entirely state-owned. This in-
cludes such industries as a soap
factory and a jute bag factory.

The railways and airways are
government owned. in addition
to the food produced by small
private farmers, the govern-
ment produces food on 105 state
farms using modern large-
scale. technological methods.
Four of these are run by So-
yiet experts and three, by is-
I‘ael. The Russians and Israel-
is are not to be the only foreignr
ers to help implement Ghana’s
agricultural revolution—a revo-
lution which is supposed to take
place on the individual farms
as much as on state farms or
cooperatives. The U. S. recent-
ly sent over 250 tons oi agricul-
tural supplies, under the U. 5.
technical assistance program,
to be used at ﬁve new training
centers for farmers,

2) The joint State - private
sector is managed by an agree-

ment between the government

and private investors of copL ‘
tal. Ghana's biggest single in- ‘

dustrial project is the $197 mil-
lion Volta hydroelectric pro-
ject, The new dam is being n-
nanced on a littyeiiity basis by
Ghania‘and tullowing sources:

the World Bank, the United '

States and Britain.

“The following information is
condensed from The New York
Times, January 20, 1964, page
67.

3) In the cooperative sector '

the organizations are affiliated
with the National Cooperative
Council. This is more or less
like American farmers' cooper-
atives. Government subsidies
are available it groups want
them. Some breweries and part
oi the internal transportation

system are owned on such a ,

basis.

4) The private enterprise sec-
tor is a segment of the econo-
my open to private investors.
Many hotels and huge departr
ment stores are in this cate-
gory. Another good example is
the Volta Aluminum Company‘s
smelter at Tema, the most
modern and well-equipped har-
bor on the West African coast.

and the Board of Trustees
would view this increase with
favor if t’he C. of H.P,, A.W.S.
Board, and student Senate give
the program strong support.”

After passing the proposal for
a social increase, Senators be»
gan the tedious task of review-
ing organizations' proposed
budgets for the coming finan-
cial year, Jim Parkison, Speak-
er of the Senate, had the diffi-
cult job of providing the Senate
with a sense of direction dur-
ing this long budgetary meet—
ing, Parkison and the Senate
performed admirably; some or
the more important results of
the meeting follow:

1. The Senate agreed with
the Executive Cabinet that
the Social Coordinator should
receive a salary of $200. The
Social Coordinator worked
without pay last year, but it
was felt that he deserved a
salary since he is responsible
for a budget of over $40,000
and is responsible for the oc-
currence of social events
every week of the school year.

2, The Senate deleted 3l,0|)0
from the proposed Gadabouts
budget. This money was to be
spent on a dance, but the Sen-
ate felt that the College could
either do With one less dance
or without a "name" band.

.3. Five hundred dollars was
added to the proposed budget
of the Informal Social Com-
mittee. This money will be
spent to provide more bowling
and pool and to repair the
cabin at Lake Acre.

4. Four hundred dollars was
added to proposed residence
hall allocations.

5. Although the proposed
5,6 A. budget was passed, in
two weeks the Senate will de-

cide whether it wishes to
spend two hundred and sev-
elityriive dollars to remain in

 

the National Student Associa-

tion,

At 9:30. Marllyn Alt moved
that the Senate appropriate ten
dollars and buy pizza for the
body, There was some debate
as to whether the pizza should
be mushroom or sausage; how-
ever, a “special deal” was
made {or sausage pizza and the
august body was without hunger
by ten o’clock.

Oh yes, a car rule resolution
was also passed:

THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
STUDENT SENATE,

NOTING that the student
body has always understood
that the car-scholarship rule
was a conduct regulation, and
that violations of it would be
punished in the same way as
any other conduct rule, and

NOTlNG that college officials
have handled a recent Violation
of this rule as a ﬁnancial regu—
lation, violation of which is
cause for a loss of scholarship
aid, and

NOTING that considerable
confusion still exists within the
student body as to the intent of
the rule and the consequences
of its violation,

REQUESTS thorough review
of the rule itself, in the light of
this iirst year’s experience, and

REQUESTS that the present
rule be clearly defined, with at-
tention to:

a. The consequences of a
violation of the rule.

b, The offices responsible
for the administration of the
rule,

c. The procedures to be
used in handling any violation
or request for exemption, and
REQUESTS that all other col-
lege regulations be reviewed
for areas of ambiguity and Con-
fusion, and that they be fully
Clarified, and
REQUESTS that these Clarifie
cations be made available to
each member of the student
body.

Lewis Talks to

Rights Group.

Wants to 'Free' Negro People

By Cynthia Brust

”Our job is to liberate an op
pressed people," Jon Lewis de-
clared in Herrick Chapel Sun-
day night. Lewis, chairman of
the Student Non-Violent Coordi-
n a t i n g Committee (SNNC),
spoke to a small, very receptive
audience at a meeting spark
sored by the Gl‘innell Civil
Rights Group.

Lewis began his speech by
listing the major demands of
today's N e g r o movement.
These are adequate income. de~
cent housing, adequate educa-
tion, the right to vote, and
equality of job opportunity. He
urged passage of the adminis-
Lration’s Civil Rights Bill, de-
spite its shortcomings, to give
the Negro people new hope and
a renewed faith in America.
Stresslng the important factor
of “Now" in this struggle, Law
is declared that the Negro
people refuse to be patient, and
will not wait until a new elec-
tion takes place. The Negroes,
he pointed out, are much more
concerned with who is elected
Sheriff and appointed Chief of
Police than with who lives in
the White House.

“This movement started with
demands for hamburgers and
theatre tickets," he reminded
his audience. “Now we are, de-
manding the right to vote and
have a decent job." He de-
Clared that the days of a “tea
and cookie" relationship be-
tween White and Negro
where an articulate, well-edu-
cated member of the Negro so-
ciety met with white leaders to
exchange reassurance: of their
“good" relationships are
past. The masses are involved
now, he emphasized, not just
the welledressed, articulate Nee
gm.

Lewis spoke bitterly or urg-
ings to maintain law and order.
”We’ve had order and no law,"

 

he said. ”That order was ‘be
patient.’ We have a mandate
from history, from our fore-
fathers and from God Almighty
to deliberately disturb this or«
der. . . . We must continue to
agitate."

Urging participation by both
Negroes and Whites, Lewis cler
Clared that “we struggle not
against people, but a system.
This is not a war of hate be-
tween blacks and whites, It
must be nonvviolenl." He fore-
sees a community of brother-
hood and love as the goal.

“The only real and true inte-
gration we have in America to-
day is within the movement it»
self. These people are making
life worth living," Lewis de-
clared. He spoke of the Missis-
sippi Project attacking poverty
and deprivation as a major part
of this ”long, hot and discon-
tented summer oi decision." He
talked about this project of
1000-3000 students as a ”non-
violent army," and a combina-
tion between a “domestic Peace
Corps and guerilla war-fare."
This project is sponsored joint-
ly by tour Civil Rights Groups
and the National Council of
Churches. Its major goals will
be education, social welfare,
and voter registration, Funher
information may be obtained
from Jeff Burnham, president
of the Grinnell Civil Rights
Group.

The Whitecaps, women’s syn-
chronized swimming group, will
be holding workshops next
Tuesday and Thursday eve-
nings at the college pool. Start-
ing at 6:30 p.m, the workshops
are for any girls who might be
interested in joining the group
next fall and who want to learn
some of the routines so that
they can practice over the
summer.

Dr. Murray Krieger
Discusses Criticism

By Mark Schorr

Literary criticism has be-
come so complex in scope that
critics of critics, as well as
“mere" critics, have become a
common phenomenon. Such a
phenomenon, Professor Mur-
ray Krieger, surveyed the criti-
cal scene before the Annual
Writers’ Conference last Friday
and Saturday afternoon.

in his iirst lecture, entitled
"Newer and Older Criticsm,"
Mr. Krieger studied the thorny
dilemma confronting the stu-
dent of literature; must he
choose between the older "his-
torical“ and the newer “con-
textual” approaches to litera.
ture?

In his second lecture, entitled
”The Poetic Context and the
Existential C O n t e X t," MI.
Krieger proposed a solution to
the historical-contextual dilem-
ma; he explained the rudi.
ments of his own critical meth-
odology, which is based on u
c o n c 9 pt of metaphor. Mr.
Krieger explained and applied
this method of dealing with lit-
erature in the last Chapters or
his newest book, entitled “A
Window to Criticism: Shake<
speare's Sonnets and Modern
Poetics.”

Mr. Krieger has style in his
approach to lecturing. but es-
pecially writing. We need only
quote from his impressive
book, “The Tragic Vision," to
demonstrate that style. Finish-
ing his survey of modern liter-
ature, he remarks: ”. , . a rich
yield of the illuminating pow-
ers of literature and its recent
criticism: their powers to illum<
inate the high existential cost of
living and our own endless abil-
ity to pay. . u .
