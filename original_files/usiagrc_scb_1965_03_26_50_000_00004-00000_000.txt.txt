The Pioneer basketball team finished in a tie for last place in
the Midwest conference with Monmouth this year with o poor 513
conference recard~7-15 overall—despite a flock of new scoring records
by Jeff Frantz and the team as a whole.

The most interesting record is the 7M iield goals the Pioneers
made to beat the record Df 703 set by last year's team, which had a 12-
10 record. What happened? This year’s team gave tip 739 field goals and
was outrebounded 994-357 while last year’s team outscored its op.
ponents and set a rebounding record oi1,184.

The most points scored by a Gl'innell opponent until this year
was 102 by Drake, which is a member of one of the toughest basket-,
ball conferences in the country, This year two teams beat that record'
and three others came very close. They were 99 by Bolton, 100 by’
Coe, 101 by Knox, 107 by Beloit again, and 108 by Ripon. ‘

Lack of height docs liui‘L rebounding and defense, of course, but'
lriany small teams make up for that deficiency wuh a scrappy and,
tenacious defense that forces the opponents to take poor and hurricd‘
shots. This keeps the Opponents off balance and allows the defensive
team to grill: rebounds more on y.

hinder tile opponent scoring. It seemed that a disproportionate num-
ber in teams had l‘.0l ll‘ghls against the Pioneers.

Of tlic three teams that tied for first place (Cox’tlcll, St. Olaf, and
Ripon), Olaf Emil Ripon finished fitst and second ill the league in
team dclense, Corncll had such a powerinl scot'lllg und rebounding
corps, led by Jack Grams and Rich Glaslel‘, that they could slack‘
off a little on defense, but they were still sixth iii the league, I

where were the Pioneers in league defense? Buried in last place
75.6 points a game behind Monmouth, 10.1 points behind Coincll. and
a whopping 15.7 and 16A points a game behind cDrCliamplons Ripon andl
St. Olaf.

We also find that Olaf and Ripon are in seventh and eighth re-
spectively in team offense. The Pioneers were way up in third place,
behind only Beloit and Cornell.

The big question lor next year's team is not whether they can
Score —- for [liEy have already shown this ability, and four of the
five iop scorers from this year are returning ~ but whether the team
c'an develop a consistently stronger delense and add to it some tough
rebounders to help Jeff Frantz, who was the only Pioneer at all effective
on the boards. If this happens, Grinnell will be a respected power
in the league and could battle for the Conlerence crown.
