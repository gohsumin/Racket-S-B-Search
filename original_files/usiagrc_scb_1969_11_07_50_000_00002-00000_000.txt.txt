Gadabouls Head Weston ls
criticized For Danae Goals

In a controversy that develr
oped lollowing last month's
Homecoming dance, the prin—
cipal locus of student com-
plaints has been the fact that
Gadahouls Chairman Ernest
Weston paid students a total of
also to decorate Darby Gym-
nasium.

“We just couldn’t find volun-
teers to do the wor ," said
Weston, who is also president
of the Council of House Presi-
dents. “The students were
paid the regular student wage
of $1.30 per hour." Weston
said he had time and wage
figures for all the student
workers if anyone wanted to
see them.

Social Coordinator Jon Stein
told the 58:3 he felt the mat-
ter had been poorly handled,
but pointed out that not just
Weston, “but the whole social
coordinating committee has
had problems ﬁnding people to
work. If a job has to be done
and nobody volunteers to do
it, then you have to pay to
have it done.”

Stein said that his principal
objection, as well as that of
many other students, was the
way in which the students 7
nearly all of them friends of
Weston — were hired. “In the
future, if we decide that Stu-
dents will have to be paid, we
will hire them through the
regular student placement
service," he said.

In previous years, students
have not been paid for dec-

.orating Darby, although stu-
dents who have worked during
the dance itself received a
wage. On occasion student
workers were invited to a
party, which seldom exceeded
330 in cost.

Other recent objections have
come from students who have
speculated that Weston may
have received a kickback for
arranging the contract with
the TS.U. Toranodoes. the
Homecoming band. After re-
ceiving a request for an inves
tigation, the Student Coordi~
nator's otlice is contacting
T e X a S Southern University,
home of the Toranadoes, in-
quiring about the band’s stand-
ard prices. The band received
$2,600 for its Grinnell appear-
ance.

Gommillee Meeting

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee (SAC) held its weekly
meeting Wednesday, with the
discussmll of SAGA optzons the
only item on the agenda, SAGA
supervisors Clluck Hand and
Mike Atkinson were present, in
addition to the regular COI‘rtmliT
tee members.

A report compiled by Ralph
Pomerenk, (Business Manager
and Administrative Supervisor
of the Servtce Bureau), entitled
“Comparative Data on Food
Service and Related Items at
some Liberal Alts Colleges,‘
was distributed.

Eighteen schools, not all
served by SAGA, were l'eprec
sented in the data, Thirteen of
these schools have systems ree
quiring students to show meal
cards or ID cards at meals,
The majority of the schools
have no special options for
students in reSldence halls.

The committee feels students
must realize that runner op
tions for fewer meals may cost
more than the present full
board arrangement. The college
will be considerll'lg various
options after costs have been
estimated. Student opinion Will
be soliclted.

At last week’s SAC meeting,
President Leggett presented
possibilities for a statement on
disruptive activities Within the
college community. Discussion
centered on content, rhetoric
and the necessity of having
such a statement. (Leggett last
week decided not to release the
statement.) The meeting was
attended by regular SAC mem-
bers, the campus Judicial Coun-
cil, President Leggett, and
P r0 f. John Kleillschmidl.

The Senate passed the
IoIIowmg resolution concerning
the Vietnam Moratorium Nov.
1344 at its meeting Wednesday
night:

“The Grinnell
Senate resolves
members or the College —
students, faculty, ad-
ministration, and staff—cease
business as usual Nov. 13-14
in observance of the Vietnam
Moratorium.

“We believe that those
who continue bLsiness as
usual implicitly sanction our
n a 1 i o n ’ 5 continued in-
volvemont in Vietnam.

“This cessation must extend
beyond the closing of classes
to such nonessential services
or the college as the library,
the Forum, maid service, Ihe
bookstore, etc.

“The S e n a t 9. further
resalves that the College not
penalize those eniployes who
do not work Nov, 1344.”

“The Senate believes that
the College should, however,
maintain a minimal B&G
crew and the SAGA food
service.”

The Senate also passed a
motion by senior Tom Thomas
to conduct an opinion evaluation
referendum on the substance of
the Senate resolution.

In Student Power news, the
heralded Student P o s i t i o n
Paper went to the printers cn
Wednesday, and is due for dis-
tribution to the entire campus.
The big Senate meeting in
Roberts Theater next week Will
be on Tuesday or Wednesday,
depending on when the printer
can get the work done.

Last wcek several of the Com-
mittee chairmen in the Power
Movement were ccntacted by
Presidcht Leggett and invited
to a meeting with the Executive
Council. The students responded
by inviting the council to a
meeting that they called. and
at the meeting lniormed the
Executive Council that they
were not prepared to speak for
the student body, and couldn’t
say anything about the Fashion
Paper until it was released and
approved by the student Senate
with the student body in at-
tendance at a mass meeting.

Social Coordinator John Stein
announced the Nov, 12 deadline
for application lor film chair-
man for next semester. In-
terested students should contact
Stein or
Frank Thomas. The Social
Coordinator Committee will be
conducting a survey in the
lunch lines one of these days
to elicit student opinion con-
cerning what type of band they
would like tor the Spring

Frank Thomas announced
that any student who had
business to take before the Stil-

Contact Jim Lew, Frank
Thomas, Ernest Weston, or
Jane West, and arrangements
will probably be made. Come
municatlon between the Student
Affairs Committee and the

nil.

In other action, Tom Thomas
questioned the propriety of the
Social Coordinating Committee
paying students for decorating
Darby oymno um lot the
Homecoming Dance, The total
amount of wages paid was
approximately 3150. Assistant
Coordinator Steve Schwartz
pointed out that ill the past dec-
orators weie given a tree pizza
party, a considerably less ex-
p e n s i v e undertaking. The
Senate passed a motion calling

the Social Coordinating

to formulate a

’c pclicy on this issue,

subject to the approval of the
Senate.

The Senate Tuesday also
passed a resolution urging the
college community to support
the “Chicago Conspiracy a" by
making donations to a campus
fund, and allotted $200 to help
defray expenses for studcnts
planning to attend the National
Vietnam Mobilization March on
Washington On Nov. 15. (See rec
Iatod stories in this issue.)

Finally, Larry Frank informs
me that some 70 or more stu-
dents want to go to Washington
lcr the Mobilization. Anyone
else interested in going should
contact Larry as soon as
possible. The large number of
students interested so far is ab-
solutely incredible. With this
month’s Moratorium looking
very promising this should he
