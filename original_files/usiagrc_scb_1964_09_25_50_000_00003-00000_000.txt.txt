Simone Hopeful—
Experienced Team
Strong in Practice

By Steve Casey

This year’s varsity soccer
team, according to Coach lrv
Simone, has the prospects of be-
ing as good as the 1963 team
that had a 6-2 record. Mr. Si-
mone is pleased with his team’s
practices up until now although
he thinks this team is now ln-'
ferior to the strong 1563 team
in conditioning.

The 1964 team is bolstered by
seven lettermen including the
two ctr-captains, Vincent Anku
and Fred Miller. There is also a
group of promising sophomores
up from last year’s freshmen
team that Coach Simone is
counting on.

The toughest matches for this
year will be on Saturday with
Illinois Normal and late r
matches with three of the top
teams in die area, Wheaten.
MacMurray, and Lake Forest.

The soccer team welcomes all
spectators. The matches start
at 11:30 and are over before the
football games start. There is
no admission fee to see the 1964
soccer team in action.
