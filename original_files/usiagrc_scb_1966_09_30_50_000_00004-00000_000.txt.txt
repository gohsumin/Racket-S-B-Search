seven or eight studenis meeting

diiierent departments. ”Sussex
Is not classroom oriented,"
notes Jones. “The student in
term normally sees tutors twice
a week for 11/5 hours and at-
tends one 11/2 hour seminar per
week.”

A special requirement is
called “the vacation essay,"
3 paper to be produced dur-
ing the summer vacation on
the basis of assigned reading.
Summer for Sussex students
is n time tor travel and study
In round out their formal,
three-year university attend-
unce. To this end, students
may be awarded travel grants
{or the summer.

“An equal ratio 0! men and
women" distinguishes Sussex
from other English universities.
Most students live 3|; miles
away from the university, in
Brighton nets. Tuition, for the
Iew who do not have full state

scholarships, costs them approx-
lmately $220 per year.

Jones feels that in general
Sussex students arrive at the
university better prepared for
undergraduate work than their
American contemporaries.

"Sussex," states J o n e s,
“hasn’t gone to general edu-
cation, but has moved into
ﬁelds of study In their broad-
er, interdisciplinary context."
The history professor charac-
terizes the present 2,500 sill-

' dents as “Intellectually alive”
and the environment as one in
which intellectual conversa-
tion flourishes.

“An American student attend-
Ing Sussex,” cautions Jones.
“would have to make an imme-
diate adjustment to a greater
emphasis on written work and
independent study." He sees the
Sussex pattern of curriculum re-
form as "relevant to some oi
the problems of Grinnell” and
is particularly interested in in-
troducing n modiiied tutorial
system here.

A Stereo Recorder With

{.3 Book-oi-the-Month, the Program
in Practical Political Education
(PPPE) announced this week.

Driiry is the author of the
earlier bestseller Advise and
Consent, which was the first
PPPE Political Book- of - the—
Month selection six years ago.
C, Edwin Gilmour, PPPE Di-
rector, noted.

Copies oi‘the new selection,
with two-week circulation privi-
leges, are available at hurling
Library and in the Caucus
Room or Carnegie Hall.

Drury opts with those who
argue that the best answer to
international Communism is the
responsible use or military
strength and force, rather than
through military restraint and
diplomatic negotiations When,
during a revolution in an emerg-
ing African nation, the insur~
gents kill iiity Americans and
destroy American oil facilities,
President Hudson sends planes
and troops to the area,

The incident triggers wide-
spread outcry and opposition
all over the us, led by a Ia-
mous columnist, Walter Dubius,
Whose influence over the entire
communications industry ap-
pears unchallenged. Dobius ai-
tempts to build California Gov-
ernor Jason as an opponent to
the President, in a campaign

that culminates or a rousing,
rowdy political convention in
the Cow Palace in San Fran-
cisco.

“Although cast in a time a
decade or two hence. the novel
finds many parallels today,
both in the central characters
and dominant theme," Gilmour
said.

Spencer Raises Coin

Three members of the Board
of Religion presented a dramat-
ic reading of "The Brothers” in
College Church last Sunday.
The reading, given by Dennis
Spencer, .ieII Patterson and
Robert Kinsey, is irom “Come
Sweet Death: A Quartet from
Genesis" by E. Davies Napier,
Dean ol the Chapel at Stanford
University.

“The Brothers” places Cain
In a number or contemporary
occupations. Each oi the mod-
em Cains interprets God’s m-
junction to “do well” as mean-
ing “be successful.” In the
end, Cain kills Abel by his indif-
ference, rationalizing, “Am I
my brother’s keeper?"
