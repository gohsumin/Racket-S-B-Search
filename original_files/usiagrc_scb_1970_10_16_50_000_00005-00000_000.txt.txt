Myths 0n Pregnancy, Abortion

_ Modernired Bookstore Opens,

, ‘ Gets‘McBee As New Manager

Grinnell's new bookstore op-
ened August 30 with a new
manager, Mr. Thomas McBee.
McBee, who inheriteda rather
difficult situation last June,
has ambitiously set about im-
proving the bookstore. He
feels very strongly that the
bookstore should serve the
students and be responsive to
their criticisms and ideas. He
also feels that communica-
tions between the bookstore
and the administration, fac-
ulty, and students is extreme-
ly important.

The main problem of college
tookstores today, says McBee,
is the lack of progressive and
competent management. Too
many bookstores are now as
they were twenty years ago.
Because the need for an ade-
quate bookstore is so import
ant to the college, great ef-
forts should be made to see
that Grinnell has a good book-
store.

Its new manager says thathe
would like to see Grinnell have
a bookstore "as good as any
in the country for a college
this size."

The annex to the bookstore
was designed to blend withthe
Skidmore, Owings and Mer-
ril designs of the Forum and
library. A Des Moines cone
SlI'LlCliOn company built the st-
ructure's shell and Grinnell's
physical plant employees did
most of the remaining work.
This included much of the inn
terior and fixtures which Mc-
Bee estimates saved at least
a half of the building’s poten-
tial cost. Work did not start
in earnest until June, sothere
was considerable pressure to
be done by the opening date of
Aug. 30. The store did open
on time but work is still con-

‘ tinuing on the interior fixtures
and the set up and display of

books, as well as on the ex-
terior.

Mr. McBee feels thatthepri-
mary function of a bookstore
is to sell texts. Supplies and
sweatshirts are secondary. He
also wishes to add more sup-
plementary texts and broaden
the available selection.

McBee, who has worked in
several college bookstores
and a private store, wishes to
try new ideas here at Grin-
nell and is always willing to
meet with people and listen to
any of the criticisms of the
store.

Theater Season To Begin Sunday

by Ann Casseit

The theater department he
gan its performing program
on Sunday, October 4, with
the play The Death of Faust,
directed by Ned Donahoe. The
theatre will continue its pr0*
gram of plays witha restor-
ation comedy by William Wy-
cherley, The Country Wife,
under the direction of Mrs.
Voertman on October 22, 23,
and 24.

The Country Wife was writ-
ten in 1675 and is a comment
on English societyatthattime.
The story concerns a man who
hires a quack doctor to spread
the rumor that he has had a
social disease and has been
rendered impotent. He feels
that if he can convince all the
husbands of the society ladies
that his story is true, they
will have no qualms about let-
ting him near their lovely
wives. His feeling proves to
be correct and he proceeds
to seduce and have affairs
with many ladies who, before

though obviously not one we
would want programmed into
everyone's life."

In an undesired pregnancy,

_the alternatives are comples

tion or abortion. Both were
discussed by Dr. Evalyn Gen-
del in the first session of this
year's Sex Education Confer-
ence on October 8. Approxi-
mately fifty students and re-
sident advisors gathered in
South Lounge for the informal
lecture-queStion and answer
presentation. Dr. Gendel's
impressive credentials in-
clude a position with the Di-
vision of Maternal and Child
(lire of the Kansas State Bo-
ard of Health, an assistant
clinical professorship in pre-
ventive medicine at the Uni~
versity of Kansas, and asso~
ciation with SIECUS, the na-
tional organization for sex
education.

Informative and exciting, the
session cleared up several
myths about pregnancy, abor‘
tion, and adoption. Dr. Gendel
concentrated particularly on
the social implications of the
newly liberalized abortion

this time, he had found un-
approachable.

Even today this situation cou-
ld be the basis for hilarious
antics. Imagine the fun they
had with it back in 1675. As
Steven H. Rubin (who?) says
in the introduction to the play,
"It is at once ﬂagrantly ribald
and libertine, and unconven»
tionally but discernably more
al,” or if you prefer it in
Mrs. Voertman’s words, "It's
a dirty play."

A few observations about the
Grinnell production of The
Country Wife are in order.
The scenery was designed by
sophomore Mark Shanstrom
and special music is ‘being
composed by David Wooldrige
of Grinnell’s music depart
ment. A large percentage of
the cast is freshmen; only
four members of the cast,
Larry Grimm, Jim Spell,Ma-
ry Brown, and Greg Gaines,
have ever been seen on the
Grinnell stage before. All the
rest are novices, including
the leading character who is
being played by Don Boros,

laws. For example, 80% of
Amerimn abortions are per-
formed for womenwho already
have one child. Since most of
these women are not widows
or divorcees, Dr. Gendel be-

Student-faculty
Ratio Increased

Definitely noticeable in the
housing crunch, the size of
the freshman class, and the
reduction in the number of
faculty, the student-faculty
ratio at Grinnell this year has
been raised significantly. At
the end of last year the stu-
dent-faculty ratio was down to
9.2, but this fall was raised
to 11.3.

Although Dean Wall, in 8 sp-
eech before the faculty, gave
evidence ofa growinginterest
on the part of students in the
Social Sciences. three Social
Science departments lost me-
mbers this year. Ecomomics
and History dropped by one,
while Political Science drop-
ped by two. French and Span-
ish both dropped by one, and
the English department exper-
ienced the biggest reduction
of all, losing four members.

The biology department gai-
ned one professor, while the
rest of the Science depart-
ments and the Fine Arts de-
partments remained the same.

Small liberal arts colleges
are feeling an impending fin<
ancial crisis and realize that
this may not be solved by
eternally raising the tuition
rates. Thus, the studentfac-
ulty ratio atmany collegesac-
ross the country is being rai-
sed. The administration of
Grinnell ls accomplishing this
through both avenues open to
them: a reduction in the size
of the faculty and a sharp in»
crease‘in the number of stu-
dents.

Academic Improvement Plan
Recipient 0! $200,000 Grant

GRINNELL, IA. ‘- Grinnell
College is the recipient of a
$200,000 grant from the An-
drew W. Mellon Foundation of
New York City, President
Glenn Leggett announced tee
day.

The Mellon grant, which re»
sulted from a proposal pre-
pared by the Grinnell Office
of Development, will help
support the program of edu-
cation in the humanities in-
cluded in the college‘s Aca-
demic Improvement Master-
plan (AIM).

The grant continues support
of Grinnell’s educational pro-
gram initiated by a predec-

a new member of Grinnell's
theatre department.

The theatre department's
next presentation will be an
experimental children's thea-
tre production directedby Don
Boros. The production dates
are November 13 and 14 in
the Arena Theatre and per
formances are planned for
the elementary schools in the
Grinnell area.

The play is based on the
story of Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs, but the script
is being written entirely by
the actors as they rehearse
and improvise. The success
of the play depends entirely
on the actors’ ingenuity and
creativity. Right now they are
trying to understand how a
child's mind works (which sh-
ouldn't be hard for Grinnell
students) by playing children's
games andstudyingtheactions
of children. The process is

entirely experimental and is ‘

designed to teach the actors,
as well as the audience, about
what is really involved in
theatre.

essor of the Mellon Founda-
tion, Dr. Leggett noted. The
Old Dominion Foundation,wh<
ich was merged with the Ava?
ion Foundation into the An-
drew W. Mellon Foundation
in 1969, gave Grinnell $50,
000 for the upgrading of ﬁsc-
ulty salaries in 1965 and aw-
arded the college an addition-
al $100,000 in ‘1967 for the
expansion of faculty study and
research opportunities in the
humanities and fine arts.

Noting that Grinnell is one
of 15 liberal arts colleges in»
cluded in the Mellon Founda-
tion's current program of aid
to higher education, Dr. Leg-
gett said, "This grant under-
lines Grinnell's nationwide
reputation as a college offer-
ing educational opportunities
of the highest quality. Thepo-
sitive response by the Mellon
Foundation to our request for
support is in keepingwithpre~
vious efforts of the Old Dom-
inion and Avalon Foundatlons
to Strengthen the country's
independent colleges."

AIM, which was inaugurated
at Grinnell in 1967, is a com-
prehensive program designed
to meet both the immediate
and long—range needs of the
college.

The five-year $10 million
first phase provides for the
acceleration of academic of-
ferings in all disciplines thr-
ough‘new teaching projects,
expanded research opportun-
ities for both Students and
faculty, the purchase of more
sophistimted science equip-
ment, and the expansion of
library holdings.

Higher faculty salaries and
an accelerated program of
student financial aid are also
being funded by AIM, as are
new construction projects and
the rennovation of older cam-
pus buildings.
