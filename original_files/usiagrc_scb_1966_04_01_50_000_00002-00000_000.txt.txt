Those Proposals

This week the longawaited recommendations by
the Executive Council on residence hall organization
were made public (see page 9). The proposals were of
such a nature that student government leaders and the
deans were prompted to visit the halls on campus and
remind the students that the recommendations were
just that, recommendations (page 9). The SGA offi-
cials and the deans made the visits and offered the ex-
planations lest anyone should read the proposals with
out this knowledge in the front of his mind and, as a
result, storm Burling basement.

The recommendations are terrible. We don’t feel
they represent a very accurate picture of life on North
Campus. It is assumed that anti-intellectualism runs
rampant now on North Campus. If the Executive Coun-
cil thinks that their proposals are going to make heal-
thy, normal twentyayear old men more intellectual than
they are now they are displaying a remarkable naivte.
What the faculty calls a problem on North Campus is
simply the normal behavior of any group like that #
and even at that it’s not as bad as the pictures painted
by its critics.

One particular proposal that we want to discuss
here is their proposal for the establishment of freshmen
dormitories on North Campus. We could spend all of
this April Fools’ Day discussing all of the proposals but
time and space prohibit this. ,

At the start of 1964435 freshmen dormitories on
South Campus were eliminated. Recently the AWS
Board conducted a survey to see what feeling existed
now on South Campus about freshmen dorms. The re—
sults were overwhelmingly in favor of filing freshmen
dorms in the college archives and forgetting a ho ut
them.

Not so with the Executive Council. They would
segregate the freshmen from uperclassmen on North
Campus. No more humanities and historical studies
seminars, no more help on scheduling, no more help in
getting into the swing of Grinnell‘s social life,

Further, I think it would create a new concept of
freshmen in the minds of upperclassmen. Under the
current system freshmen make friends not only with
other freshmen but with upperclassmen. They make
friends by constant, day-today contact in the hall. The
chance of friendships being created between freshmen
and upperclassmen under the Executive Council’s sys-
tem is slim indeed. Rather, freshmen, by being treated
differently by the school. will be treated differently by
the students. Now, after the first few weeks, they are
treated as equals. Under the new proposed system we
think it is inevitable that freshmen will be treated as
lnferiors.

The rest of the proposals are certain to receive
widespread attention in the next few weeks. We are

'hterested in what the students feel about the proposals ‘

and the so~called North Campus problem. Next week
we will distribute a survey about the problem and so-
lutions. We will appreciate it if you will take time to
fill it out and return it to us.

The Grudge Pot

Most people are merely schizophrenic, but Mar-
shall Musier had at least three personalities. This
condition in itself would not have bothered Marshall,
but for the life of him he could not decide which
one he pl-elen-ed.

Sometimes Marshall was a Quaker. Then he was
very quiet and serious, and everyone sneered at
him. The sueers made him feel important. superior,
and persecuted, and so he was very happy.

Sometimes he was a Catholic. This stage oc-
curred every Friday. when Marshall ate plate alter
plate of white perch at Billy‘s Diner (all you can
eat for $1.35). He even ate the bones.

At other times he was a Unitarian. He swore at
the minister and played golf on Sunday mornings
and felt very unholy and free.

Actually, the Quaker liked the Catholic best, but
the Catholic had a iondness for the Unitarian. Of
course, the Unitarian adored the Quaker.

Like Joe Christmas, Marshall also could not de-
cide to which race he belonged. Sometimes, when
he looked Into a mirror at his wan oily white skin,
he knew that he could not be That ugly und so
thought he was a Negro. Other times he was proud
that he did not have to buy skinrwhiteners and that
he was a pure Caucasian. But, when sneaking
through the dark streets and back alleys to Billy’s
Diner, he felt all the scheming and superhuman
subtlety or an Oriental.

The Catholic disliked the Oriental. though. and
often would not go to dinner with him. He liked
the Caucasian. The Unitarian liked the Negro in him
self, but he admired the Orienla] in the Quaker.
The Quaker loathed the Caucasmn in himself but

did not mind it in the Unitarian. In fact. he almost
liked it there.

The Catholic Oriental usually was a good Demu<
oral and voted for Mayor Daley (he had lorgoueu
the guy's real first name» ioul- straight times. al-
though he joined the Goldwater enthusxasts in 1964.
The Unitarian Caucasian Democrat almost killed
him for that, (or he believed in eternal party loyal-
ty, but the Catholic Negro Republican said, “Hog-
wash," and let it go at that.

Marshall made the mistake of marrying in 1959,
which was a bad year In other ways. Marshall had
revealed only his Quaker Caucasian Republican sell
to petite and lovely Molly, and since each of these
despised the others, he had a tough go oi it. Then,
one night in 1961. he weakened as he was falling
asleep and became l Unitarian Negro Democrat
just as Molly rolled over and looked at him.

Molly was disgusted and went home to her moth-
er, Eventually. she remarried a plumber, who was
a permanent Hungarian Baptist Conservative.

Marshall was deeply upset by this failure, and
in 1965 he ran off to theoircus in hope of ﬁnding
reconciliation with himself. He became the star of
the sideshow and changed personalities on the hour
to the sound of a huge gong. and for a while he
was content.

But Marshall Muster fell in love with the lady
snake charmer, who demanded that he become 3
Jewish Socialist. In his heroic attempt to satisfy his
lover, Marshall burst a blood vessel in his brain and
passed swiftly away. His body was cremated, and
the ashes were scattered to where the four winds
blow.

To the Editor:

After reading the sob editorial
or March 11th. “the gross unwlll
ingness bi Goddard to cooperate
with the son" is very clear to me.
Not only do you “make mistakes in
reporting" you also write Very
slanted. biased editorials.

In his speech. JeiTy Goddard
correctly attacked efforts to effect
change “by stirring the students
to an irrational ireuzy or by play-
ing political ipolsy with the col-
lege administration.” Unlike many
people on this campus, he is can
able of realizing that “the par-
ents, the alumni. the trustees, the
faculty" exist as well as the ﬂu
dents.

However, the son is right about
one thing: Goddard did maintain
the status quu (without defending
it) and for a definite reason. His
aim was clearly in establish “a
year of relative calm in student-
administration relations" (unlike
the son, 1 shall quote in context).
I can only speculate on his rear
sons for seeking this calm, but
perhaps one reason is that Grin-
nell does have a new president, a
president who might appreciate
not being jumped on with wild «lev
mantis d ring his first year here.
Another reason might be that good
government consists in part of
slowing down, of occasionally
withdrawing [mm the sound and
the fury.

The son Said that Goddard is
proud of the job he has done this
year, and he should be. for he has
done what he set out to do 7 and
on his own publiclysiaied terms
he has not failed. Perhaps his
terms are not satisfactory to the
sen; nevertheless, Jerry was uu~
her no obligation to conduct his
onlce as the sat-b saw fit.

Perhaps the most perceptive ob-

servation made in a very fine
speech was that the newspaper
staff “should spend less time gaz-
ing at comets and picket lilies and
more time considering their re-
sponsibilities to their readers." It
is a statement whch many. runny
people here agree with.

3&6 Pulls Through:
Benches on Campus

To the Editor:

I wish to praise 3&6 for their
wisdom, their generosity, in plac-
ing two benches on the held be-
tween the women's gym and the
library. it isn‘t often that 8&6 is
praised, but [his act oi theirs. if
none else, proves. be yond any
doubt, [he wcnh oi that organiza»
tion.

Now several weeks ago it was
protested that Gl-inooll provides no
place rol- quiet conversation among
students. The grill was accused of
being too restaurantish, the South
Lounge for being used for study.
and so on. These two old benches
are a beginning to the end of this
deﬁciency.

Now. In the midst oi nature,
there 15 a haven [or conversation.
However. two benches are not
enough. The school should pur-
chase nine or ten more. In this
way. one of the major problems or
the school will be solved, a study
of nature will be encouraged, and
I believe, the value of Grinnell
will be doubled.

curacy in the last issue of the Sikh.
In a story on page i, the 5&8,
both in the headline and the first
paragraph, stated that the faculty
had approved the recommenda-
tions made by the Executive
Council for changes in the or-
ganization of North Campus’ resi-
deuce halls.

The statement is in error: the
faculty did not approve, lol- us
approval was not asked. The red
ommendauons were read to the
faculty, and a very brief discus»
slon followed. During that discus»
slon it was specifically stated to
the [acuity that the faculty's cona
sent was not being asked nol- was
it lo be asked.

Since the changes will, like all
changes, breed a certain amount
of both censure and approval. I
think it only fair to point out that
the faculty is not entitled to any
share of either—at least not of-
l'icially.
