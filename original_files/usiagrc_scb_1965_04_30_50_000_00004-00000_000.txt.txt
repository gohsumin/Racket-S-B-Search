Unidentified thieves caused
a temporary panic at Carleton
College by stealing d'le sign-out
cards from all major women’s
dormitories. When the theft
was discovered, it was ana
nounced that all girls would be
campused until the cards were
returned, and doors locked at
6:30. The student Action Party
immediately scheduled a twen~
Ly-minute protest meeting be-
ginning at 6: 15 for all concerned
women. Two hours later. how-
ever, the clean of women an-
nounced that the remains of
the cards had been found in a
do r m it o r y incineratorr She
added that there would be no
lock-in, that regular hours
would prevail that night, and
that new cards would be issued.

field, Iowa, is a "baby sitter“l
school where parents park
their unwanted children for four
years, the Parsons Portfolio de-
clared in part, “About three
years ago this may have been
true, but today the academic

because onerthird of the enroll-

academic trouble is no cause
for alarm.“

Fifty Yale students held a
seventyatwo hour picket of the
university administration build~
ing recently to protest the
“publish or perish” attitude of
the Yale Tenure Appointment
Committee. The demonstration
was a result of tenure being
denied to R. J. Bernstein, as-
sociate professor of philosophy.
Bernstein, 32, has publislled one
book, another about to be pub-
lished, and is working on a
third. One member of the phil-
osophy department said, “Un-
der the criteria of publications
that were used for Bernstein,
we could not have gotten tenure
for Aristotle when he was 32."

Slaus—s Describes
Tenure al Grinnell

ln light of the recent dem-
onstrations at Yale over the
tenure system, the 5&3 looked '
into the tenure situation here at
Grinnellr

Acting President J a m e s
Stauss said that there is a ten<
ure system at Grinnell, but that
there aren’t any formula-like
for assigning ten/-
ure.

“Tenure comes on the basis
of a system of recommenda-
tions and must be approved by
the Board of Trustees," Stauss
said. I

“Many faculty members en-
gage in scholarly activities,
and this is a factor in the con-
sideration for tenure," Stauss
continued. He stressed, how-
ever, that there is no "publish
or perish" policy at Grinnell.

Tenure means that a faculty
member has a permanent p0~
sition at Grinnell.
