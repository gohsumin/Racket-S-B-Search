Thompson lumbosis
Members of longun

By Jim Herzog

Grinnell's Dean of Men, S. Eu-
gene Thompson, warned the resi
dents ot Langan Hall yesterday
that'any turther damage or rule
disobeyal would bring swift and
massive penalties.

Thompson told members of the

en’s residence hall that “The col-
ege wants a better style of life
than its getting”

He referred to damage and de-
struction of lounge turniture, mis-
use or tire alarms, and drinking,
saying, “It stinks to have a situa—
tion like this on a college campus.”

Thompson said, “People are dis-
gusted by ﬂiis place . . . I don't
trust you to live by the fairly
wretched philosophy you already
have."

Thompson told 35 members of,
the hall of 60 that'there "was no
question about something being
done" He continued "Ii you think
there have been arbitrary actions
before, you haven't seen anything
yet."

“If any more goes on, we just
start shooting people down," said
the Dean. One consideration he
mentioned was putting the entire
hall on probation, with those al-
ready having probationary status
facing even more severe action.

Langan Hall, 'he said, is the
“crummiest place to live on North
campus.

Thompson said he was particular»
1y disturbed by the unwillingness
oi Langan Hail members to report
serious incidents to him, SO that
he could take action.

the incident from several sources.
He said, “It was talked up all
around the campus. Lots of people
knew including several CoiHP
members. They knew the incident
had occurred and they knew who
had done it, but the student was
protected by the students around
im who knew of the incidentl”

Dean Thompson stated, “Some
iaculty members were in favor of
turning the affair over to the Grin-
nell police. I called the station,
without using any names, and
asked about charges and penalties.
The police cited three or tour
charges, each punishable by at
least 30 days. Had the incident OC-
curred some place else in town,
such as a hotel, the student would
have been in considerably more
serious trouble.”

Dean Thompson summed up the
incident and the protection sur-
rounding it as, “Incredible.”

Booth Views Interim Favorably

By Sue Johnson

With the comment that “Interim”
is definitely a misnomer, Protes-
sor Wayne C. Booth stated, “The
highest point of the year should
be this time when you can get free
of instructors and get down to edu-
cation.”

Booth, Dean of the Undergrad-
uate College of the University of
Chicago and Pullman professor oi
English in the graduate depart-
ment, made the above observa»
tions during his stay at Grinnell as
guest lecturer tor the freshman
lecture series. Having worked with
various types of independent study
himself, he was very much in-
terested in Grinnell's Interim, upon
which he feels Grinnell needs to
bmld. He stated that the students
should perhaps be better trained
to study independently, for many
students, unaccustomed to the lack

of supervision and direct pressure, lspent a post-graduate year read-

are incapable of using the time to
good advantage. “The trouble with
American education,” said Booth,
“is that too little attention is given
to building a love or each subject.
The aim of a course should not be
to put in as much as possible, but
to be sure that students will go on
educating themselves in that
area.” Although Booth has com-
plained that his high school and
college education was not rigorous
enough, he acknowledges the fact
that he enjoyed and protlted trom
having enough time to read and
listen to music.

Apparently Booth learned from
his undergraduate work at Brig-
ham Young University and his
graduate work at University or
Chicago how to make the most of
his leisure time. After completing
work on his PhD. in English, he

ing philosophy under a Ford Foun-
dation grant and a Guggenheim
year writing literary criticisms. He
then taught ”practically every—
thing" for nine years at Earlham
College, a liberal arts college very
similar to Grinnell, after which he
returned to the University of Chi—
cago as a protessorl In 1961 he
published The Rhetoric of Fiction,
which is an attempt to deal with
a neglected aspect oi criticism oi
ﬁction. That aspect is the whole
dimension of fiction which makes
it able to communicate ettectively
to an audience, rather than the ob-
jective view which tends to ignore
the audience. The book received
the Christian Gauss Phi Beta
Kappa award in 1962 for being the
most distinguished piece or literary
criticism of the year,

Despite the fact that he is still

 

teaching courses and seminars in
literary criticism, forms of the
novel, problems in the critiusm 0i
tiction, and English, Protessor
Booth’s greatest concern is tul-
illling his duties as Dean of the
College, ior undergraduate educa
tion is his basic love. Worried
about the diminishing amount of
fun in undergraduate life, he wants
to work on the problem of pre-
graduate pressures; as he states
it, “A liberal education should be
a time when you are liberated.”

Busy Bulbs Boost Bill

In a notice to faculty and
staff members recently, Vice
President Merritt Ludwig noted
that the school’s electrical bills
have increased from $46,735 in
1960451 to an estimated 387,000
this school year, Ludwig said
that this increase was duel
mainly to new buildings, im.
proved lighting systems in old-
er buildings, and greater over-
all use of electricity.
