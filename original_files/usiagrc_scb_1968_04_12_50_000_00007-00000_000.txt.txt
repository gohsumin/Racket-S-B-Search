Here are a few comments
Irom the Democratic chairmen:

Jim llarmg, w est Norris

and the Mach Political Con-
ventions, will dellver the open-
ing address to the Mock Delno~
cratic Convention.

Later in the program the
keynote speaker, Hon. Richard
a. listener, mayor or Gary,
will address the Convention.

The first Negro mayor in
Indiana’s history, Hatchei‘ is
presently in his first year of
office.

He was elected to the City
Council in '63, and led the ligllL
for one oi the best. open 00'
cupancy laws in the nation.
The passage oi that law has
resulted in integrated public
housmg in Galy.

 

GOVERNOR John Chaiee, oi Rhoda island, and Mnyor Rich-
ard Hatcher, oi Gary, lndiana, will be the keynote speakers
at campus Republican and Democratic conventions.

Ireshmall, on Kennedy:

“Kennedy is the only white
American who can claim a pile
sitlon of leadership as well as
respect among the Negro pop-
ulaiion of this country.”

“Kennedy has proved hinl~
self to be a leader and an
initiator in progressive legis-
lation. . t I believe he can
and will win."

Phil Bertentttal, North Younk-
or senior, on McCarthy:

"I think we'll Win. But I'm
not sure of it at all.”

“I think we've lost support
in the last couple of weeks.
If we work hard, we'll will."

Andrea Dungy. Haines Soph-
omore, on Dick Gregory:

“I'm very iatalistic. I just
got the buttons last week, but
before we can really work, we
need printed materials that
simply haven't come yet.”

Tom Greenﬁeld, North Youn-
kcr sophomore and Chairman
of the Mock Democratic Corl-
vention, on President Johnson:

“Johnson’s withdrawal had a
peculiar client on the Grinnell
campus. Although he was only a
minor Candidate, with little
chance oi getting any signiﬁ—
cant support at Grinnell, his
withdrawal seemed to bring the
long silent Grinnell Kennedy
[action out of its hibernation."

”All. of a Sudden the RFK
people saw victory—deﬁnitely at
Chicago and maybe at Grin~
nelll"

“The McCarthy campaign is
directed by a small group oi
students who have come to call
themselves “the Grinilell Polit-
lcal Machine.”

“Unless the Kennedy camp
can throw them on balance,
it's McCarthy for President."

Opposed by the entire City
machine, including the leaders
oi his own party, he went on
in '67 to defeat the incumbent
mayor and a well-known buS<
inessmaii to gain the Demo-
cratic mayoral nomination.

Friday night at the Republi-
can Mock Convention, Hon.
John H. Chafee, Governor OI

vote, while President Johnson
was sweeping the state with
81 percent, his highest percent-
age for any state.

Also during the Conventions
the Platform statements will

“the United States should ar-
range immediately with the
National Liberation Front lfor
its takeover of the South Viet-
namese government."

TIME’S
MOGK
PRIMARY

By PHIL SEMAS

Collegiate Press Service

In any election year there all
always numerous mock primar-
ies and elections on collegc
campuses.

In 1968 these llldivIdunI Iocol
primaries will be pushed into
the background by Choice ‘68,
a national primary to be held
April 24 on more than 1,000
college campuses.

The organizers oi the on.
mary say they already have
1,100 schools with four-anda
half million students signed up
to participate, including almost
all of the large schools. They
hope to have at least 1,500,
which would give them a potenv
tial electorate of tive-and-arhall
million. That would make it
the second largest pnmary in
the nation (after California’s).
Some have predicted that they
will get close to 2,000 schools,
which would be nearly every
college in the country.

Choice '65 is the idea of Bob
Harris, a former Michigan Stain
University student body presi-
dent. It occurred to him last
summer that, instead of a hap-
hazard group ot local primaries,
college students ought to veto
at the same time in one nation-
al primary.

He then started going to
various companies to see if ho
could get money to finance tho
program. The ﬁrst place he
went was Time magazine main.

Atter that trip, Time decided
it could be done and gave Har-
ris $100,000 for the project “an

a problem for Choice ’68. Time’s
editorial treatment oi students,
education, and Vietnam has not
exactly made it credible to
many college students and semi
DI that lack of credibility may
rub off on Choice ’68.

But Harris says Time ha:
given him and his board of dis
rectors complete control over
policy. “They do exercise qua].
ity control over how things are
written and so forth," he says,
“but they let us decide on bash:
approaches and policies."

Harris also points out that
there has been no coverage pl
Choice ’68 in Time, except in
Shepley's “publisher's letter"
on the table-ofrcontents page.
The project wasn’t announced
