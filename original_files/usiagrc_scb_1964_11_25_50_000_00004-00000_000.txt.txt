Grinneii Student Senate met and
unanimously adopted the proposal
of Dennis Murphy 0! East to form-

ber of high school students and for
broadening and improving admis
sion standards. Before the formal
vote Murphy told of his recent in-
teereW with Nicholas Ryan.

Mr. Ryan told Murphy that the
admissions office receives between
800 and 1,000 applicants 3 year and
thus accepts nearly one half of
those applying. in explaining the
administration’s receptibiiity to the
bill, Mr. Ryan noted that Grinnell
has no representatives on the West
Coast, and would like to receive
about three hundred more well-
quaiiiied applicants per year from
all parts of the country. while ne-
cessarily maintaining the 54 out
of state-Iowa student ratio imposed
by the admissions office.

Also assured at the meeting was
Grinnell's participation in th e
NUSNAS»COF0 (Council of Free
dom Organization) Fast For Free-
dom program on December 3. Un-
der this program students in col.
leges throughout the country vaium
tarily miss a meal, and the money
saved by their college cafeterias
from food expenses for the meal is
contributed to a general fund to
buy dried and nonperishabie food‘
stuffs for Southern families made
indigent due to participation in ci<
Vii rights activities. The materials
are shipped throughout the South
by the Teamsters Union.

Ari amendment added to this pro-
posai at the recommendation of
Jim Hei'zog of Langan directs
Saga, in the event that enough
students participate in the program
to close one dining room, to pay its
non-students employees their reg-
uiai' salaries if they so desire.

Steve Kent, Chairman of the
Course Evaluation and Finance
Committees saw the farmer‘s final
resolutions easily approved.
