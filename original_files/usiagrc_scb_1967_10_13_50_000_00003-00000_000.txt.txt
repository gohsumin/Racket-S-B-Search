DEAN'S DAY
APPROACHES

With all the publicity about
convocation Weekend, Hal-
Ioween has been somewhat left
out. in fact, it is not even men-
tloned on the student activities
calendar, except in the sym-
bolic orange and black colors.

Aiter myriad visiting dignl.
taries and parents, another try
lng rootball game, and waiting
in long lines for meals, people
are sure to be worn out and
ready for a change. Halloween
offers just such an opportunity
—unplanned, unpubliciLed ao<
tivities without the over-
hanging educational implica‘
tions.

For suggestions of places to
visit, scenic Hazelwoud Ceme<
tery and Arbor Lake come first
to mind. These surroundings
are ideal tor a complete
change in environment. The
woods and gravestones, along
with the ﬂowing spirits sure to
be present on All Saints’ Day
Eve, ought to provide anyone
with enough spooks for an eve-
ning.

To reach the cemetery, take
West Street south to Washing-
ton, tum West and you’re
bound to run into It.

Or perhaps, since Iowa is the
heart of the corn and therefore
the pumpkin belt, a real pump
kin patch might suit your de-
sires. All it takes is a little
searching and you’re bound to
come onto a few of the friendly
jack-o-ianterns.

one such place leads the
searcher south on East Street
past Lake Nyanzn. Go on past
Garfield Street and the Weath-
erworn two story house remi-
niscent or movie homes (or
ghosts. Keep going until you
reach an unassuming brown
house surrounded by the
orange symbols at Halloween,

Who knows, it you wait long
enough and are quiet enough,
you might even see the great
pumpkin arise irorn one or the
vines,

H. T. Main, in commemoration
I‘ll the successful endowment
campaign of 1m.)

, THE GRINNELL REPORTER

LEGGETT T0 RETIRE

Reporter reporters h a v a
pieced together enough informa<
tion to predict with assurance
that President Leggett Will re-
tire soon, The trustees will not
appoint a successor and the
Leggetts will continue to occupy
the collegeowned house on Col~
iege Park Road

The president will not puh<
licly announce that ho is re-
tiring, and the College is not
planning any testimonials as the
event will be considered of little
signiiicanoo. Many other Grim
uell presidents have retired
without reeling the need to make
a public announcement.

Those few students who were

“I wouldn’t trade that two

for a good many things that
the world seems to set a high
price upon,

“My only regret is that the
exigencies of life forced me to
leave college two years too
soon. it isn‘t the loss of a de-
gree that I regret so much«
although I would have prized a
Grinneil sheepskin as much as
the next fellow—but the loss of

queried showed little concern
or even surprises “All adminiea
traiors have to retire eventual.

necessary to leave their office:
sooner than others. That's all.”

No one seemed particularly now
plussed by the impending event.

Like other men in similar p01
sltions, Leggett is believed to be
retiring due to iatigue, The preo-
idency of a college like this to
an extremely tiring job. Tho
Reporter has reason to believe
that Leggett wo uld become
prone to serious exhaustion it
he did not retire.

Even alter retiring, Leggetl
will not give up his article:

participate in Encampment II

Leggett will resume his preo-
Idential duties upon awakening.
