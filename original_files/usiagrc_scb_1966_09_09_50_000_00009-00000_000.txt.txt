with his Lord At the height oi
his public acclaim he wrote the
following note to himself:

of busy action and quiet sensi-
tivity And without an aware-
ness of the double nature of
this responsibility, those who
pursue Liberal education pur-
sue the frivulity that many think
it ls~reading novels, dissecting
fro s, measuring microwaves,
an studying pricerand-waga
structures merely to pass exam-
