clude on the agenda 3 considera-
tion or the encampment reports
and faculty action in regard to the
reports," Dr. Leggett said.

in discussing the residence hall
situation, Dr. Leggett noted. “I
would prefer a situation in which
students ‘dritted’ naturally into
dating situations, and the possibilr
ity or this situation would be in.
creased if the north and south
dorms weren’t entirely separated,

Dr. Leggett pointed out that the
encampment reports included re-
commendations for studying the
possibility oi alternating men’s and

south campus and the possibility
at making one campus a fresllr
man and sophomore campus and

Protessol's at St. John’s Univer-
sity have been picketiitg to protest
the little participation they have
in the iorming of the school’s ed-
ucatlonal policy. The dispute be-
tween laciilty and administration

began during the student demon-
stration last spring at St. John’s
and grew when its new president,
Joseph Cahill, did nothing to pla-
cate the faculty.

After certain appointments were
made, not to the iacuity's lilting,
the American Association 0! Uni-
versity Professors met late in Au
gust and decided as a “minimum
action" In protest to picket. The
prolessors demand a University
Senate, tenure, a new salary scale,
and the election of departmental
chairmen. The proiessors on pick.
et met the students on opening
day oi school and plan to continue
“hill the administration decrdes
favorably on at least one oi their
four demands

A iuss is being raised in Am-
herst over a new SOClal honor code
passed by the Amherst lnterdol'r
mitory Council. It requires each
dormitory resident to sign a pledge
that he ivill be responsible tor the
social conduct of other members
of his (IDI‘m.

This "rat-tink" clause is ob-
jected to by approximately halt the
Amherst stutlents who have not
turned in or signed [Ilelr social
responsibility cards that go along
Wlth this new code. They feel, said
the Amherst newspaper, that stil-
dents should not impose their
standards upon their peers. The
interdoruiitoty council has now
planned to poll the student body
on the Code.

“Mom, this is it—the last straw.
Now they’ve melted my candy!
All of it." “Morn, you really must
come down for Parent's Weekend;
we’re boycotting the laundry and
I’m down to my last pair of
socks." Yup, in 1952 the Grinnell
boys really had it hard, and many
letters home may have contained
exerpts like these.

What was the problem? Well,
centralization — that omnipresent
phenomenon—was botcliing up the
works again. Somebody had der
cided that it would be convenient
to have the laundry, cleaning, and
parcel post agencies located in one
building—the heating plant. Many
others decided that it wouldn't be
convenient at all. Thus. the Iuss.

On October 3, 1952, the 5&3
wrote that “the Grlhnell Student
Council unanimously approved a
resolution for a collegewide boyr
coil of the college laundry and
dry-cleaning agency. . . .Reasoiis
oriered by council members Im‘
the unprecedented boycott are that
the present location or the clean-
ing, laundry, and parcel post agen.
cies is inconvenient and relatively
inaccessible during the muddy
months; that the new centraliza-
tion or these serVices is depriving
students or Jobs; that the lack oi
adequate space and tacilities in
the heating plant creates a bot-
tleneclt during the lunch hours;
and that heat of the building has
led to the spoilage oi iood pan
Eels." One can Imagine hundreds
or students struggling through rain
and Wind and sleet and hall to
retrieve packages lmm home and
laundry and bundles oi dry»clean-
lug—only to drop every bit of it

 

in the mud. They did have a real
complaint. one must admit.

Tile edltorial staff of the 5&3
determined to present both sides
of the issue. however, They wrote,
“When the decision- was made to
combine. services at the heating
plant, there seemed to be advan-
tages tor both the students and the
housekeeping department. For the
students, it would mean a chance
to pick up packages any time dur-
ing the working day. At the same
time, it would eliminate unneces-
sary handling, ireeing trained
laundry personnel irom timecori-
suming tasks.” On the other hand,
“it is a tact, too, that the heat of
the laundry plant has melted can~
dy mailed to students." Clearly,
this was a hot issue.

However, two weeks passed and
the boycott (which, the editor-
said, “has nothing to do with boys
or cots although the confusion is
qulte understandable at this time
or the year") wasn’t put into ei—
Iect. The 5&3 queried, "Since the
Council vote was unanimous, it
appears that representative stu-
dent opinion is likewise unanl-
mous. Why, then, are students
still patronizing the college agen-
cies which they have just legis-
lated against?" Maybe that three-
ieet high pile oi shirts was just
too much to tight.
