Union plans

it is likely that filial plans for the proposed new Stu—
‘dcnt UniOn will be made within tlle next few months. Fac-
l‘liy and administration personnel lime been visiting other
ic'lmpuses to see the latest thing- in unions. This, in itsell'.
assurance that student needs are being considered before

the blueprints are drawn up.

But, nevertheless, it seems to us that Grinnell student
(pinion as to what should be included in tlle building has

‘r-ot yet been satisfactorally

polled.

This is perhaps not the fault ol’ the joint strident-
'ieulty-udministrativc committee which is consideling‘ the

lding plans.

We remember ver well

the meager attendance at a

coffee hour during which President Bowen outlined exten-
sively the plans of the college within the next few years i

:- presentation which

included discussion of

alternative

plans for a U11l01‘l.yHO\\'eVel‘, we still feel that the commit—
tee has the responsibility {or determining student opinion
(n the matter and that it has not completely fulfilled this

responsibility yet.

What we Suggest is this:

that anothe ~ more publicized

coffee hour be presented sometime within the next two
weeks. And that the program merely he a meeting of the
uildingplans committee during or following which quess
lions and proposals may be entertained from the floor.
This, we think, will help to resolve the qllestio 5 0t
l 'hether or not to have studysdate rooms in the Union or
ii'heth‘er to build the proposed Swimming pool as part of

the Union or a field house.

Katayalna Sun was born in 1858
of peasant parents. worked on a
faim and studied at home uiilil
1332 when he moved to Tokyo
There he worked at a printing
plant 10 hours a day (for 71h
cents a day) and studied Chinese
classics at ni ht. In 1884 he ar-
rived in Calitornia wnlr exactly
one dollar in his pocket.

He sludied English in a
Chinese mission in Alameda and
entered Johns Hopkins Academy
at Oakland. From there he wcnl
to Mnryville College, Ten-
neesec. then in 1889, came to
Grinnell. Three years later he
graduated ivillr the class of 1392
Graduate work at Andover for
two years and Yale icr one year

He returned to Japan in 1902
to found Kingslcy Hall and ihe

Katnynma worked
for his living id tuition. The
rcicrcncc book says (hot “this
ordeal prcparcd him for the
nciiviiy of a nrililnnf rebel."
Tlic study of Socialism took
him (o England ior work with
Ferdinand Lnssallc.

Katayama made a historic gcss
lure at (he Geneva niccling by

publicly shaking hands with the
Russian representative, Plek»
hanov. This indication of “in.
(crnnlicnal proletarian solidar-
ity” must have endeared them to
their respective governments.

Tlic Japanese authorities
gave Kaiaynnia and his rcllow
Socialists plenty of trouble,

ncer the tremendously success-
ful streetcar strike which im»
mobilized thc entire city of
Tokyo for five days during the

the strike was settled, the str '6
leaders were arrested, and Ka-
laynin went to jail 1m- nine
months.

Upon his release he soughl
sanctuary in the United States
and worked in New York for
the next ‘11 years uniil 1921
when he went to Russia as a
member of the Execut 'e Com-

To the Editor: ~

Aflcr reading Larry sinuclrcr’s
usual outpouring of garbage and
finding it more poicnl than us-
ual, I had in write this letter.
His “Worsts” Awards of (he
year are the word bunch of
words cver put (ogolhcr and
smiled into the Scarlet and
Black.

For cramplc, Lorry cried Paul

oiirlvright's cartoon as the

in t" of llrc year. i don't
remember seeing any others, but.
that is bcsidc the point. Some-
onc dared lo criticize one of
Larry's projccrs~narurally Lar-
ry doesn't like him! it seems
Larry is taking a parting shot
at Paul before the year is ov—
er.

Larry next cited The Brolh—
crs Four as the worst concert
of the year. Is he so entrench-
cd in his ultra-liberalism that
he can't emoy a program de»
signed for entertainment only?
I enjoyed the program very
much as did most of my friends
It provided us with on oppor-
tunity to iorget the cares of the
world and gci a little fun out
of life.

The fallout shelter issue was
next in line for Larry's blasts.
Thc Administration didn’t agree
with Larry; therefore they are
wrong I think it is wonderful
for us to concenlrnic our cfforis
on the preveniion of war, but
what if all our error fail and
there is war? ii Lal' . had his
way, we'd all die, Unlil a bet-
(rr- alternative is found, fallout
shelters are our best means or
protection in the event of war.

Perhaps Larry should have
paid more heed to the "ol' rear
ist" Maybe the world is going
(o the dogs. but that is no rea-
son ior us to spend our lives
moaning about ii, i prefer to
forget the world's troubles once
in a while and get some fun out
of life.
