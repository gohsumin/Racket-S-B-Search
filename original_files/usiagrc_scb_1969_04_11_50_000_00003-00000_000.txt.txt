Priorities Need Revision

An Open Letter to President Leggert
Dear Mr. Leggett,

This letter is in response to your re«
quest for ideas on your position paper on
Black Education at Grinnell. 1 don't pre~
tend to have more to say than the black
students on this campus about what
their education should be, but I do have
some ideas about Grinnell education in
general which I think are relevant,

It seems that this issue, as so many
others, is being considered ln a vacuum.
One by one, as new problems arise, they
are dealt with, or not dealt with, as the
case may be, and then disappear from
view, What is missing is a comprehensive
outlook on the meaning of education at
Gl'innell, with emphasis on the establish-
ment of a hierarchy of priorities. There
are many areas in which Grinneii is
sadly lacking, and other areas of over-
supply. Rather than deal with problems
piecemeal and solve them if money, and
especially time, is available at the
moment, now is the time for a long-range
look at possible pmblems of the future,
and then make room for the solutions.
Right now on campus we have a desire
for a re-evaluation of senior compre-
hensives and the grading system, and a
desire for furthering the social experi-
ment of coed living facilities, as well as
a desire for more and better black edu-
cation. What we also have on campus
right now is a $35,000 switchboard with
bathrooms, and an overpriced book-
store which most students boycott when<
ever they can, while the only construc-
tivo work that is visible on campus is
the $2 million eyesore behind Darby
gym.

I think it is important to look back on
What our priorities have been in the
past, and change them. It seems to be
a weliperpetuaied myth that the more
buildings Grinnell is comprised of, the
longer it. will endure, It should be oh‘
vious to anyone iomiliar with the de-
mands of rioting students at large unl-
versities that what is essentially going
to mean the difference between the de-
mise and longevity oi any educational in-
stitution in this country will rest on the
quality of the education found within,
and not the strength of the bricks or
the expertise or the architects. Grinnell,
as a small liberal arts college, is far
from the inhuman machinery of the
large urban or state university, Our task
here is not to sit back and gloat over our
superiority, but to make sure we maine
iain, and further, the high standards of
our educational commitment.

Sincerely,
Ann J. Kirschner '69

To the Editor:

There has been much discussion in the
last few weeks concerning the position
of the AFROTC unit on campus. There
has been in addition discussion of the
more limited topic of academic credit
for participation in the AFROTC pro-
gram. The 5&3 "news" story which
headlined the last issue of the newspaper,
which was devoted largely to the ROTC
question, did little to advance the cause
of rational discussion and less for the
cause of objective journalism. My views
were cited a number at times by the
author of the article, but did more to
misrepresent my views than it did to pre-
sent them, The quotations attributed to
me are simply inaccurate. In addition,
I specifically did not indicate any prea
ferellces concerning the AFROTC'S re
action in the event that the faculty ap-
proved the motion to deny academia
credit,

The specitic motion was raised primar-
ily in an attempt to encourage debate
and resolution, if possible, of the col-
lege’s relationship to outside institu-
tions as well as to open lot debate the
nature of the College curriculum and tho
role of academic credit. It was for this
reason that the question of academic
credit was put forth, in Mr. Grey's
terms, on narrow grounds. Clearly the
motion was supported or opposed for
widely divergent reasons. It is unrealis<
tic to assume that policy questions are
so simple that they will be perceived
the same way by all people or that these
questions can be discussed and resolved
without consideration to the broader
philosophical Questions.

On a related topic, I should like to
express my admiration for those who
telt strongly about this issue and took a
public stand — this applies equally to
those who signed and circulated the pe-
titions as well as to those cadets and
other opponents of the motion who puh-
licly articulated their positions. At the
same time I cannot refrain from express-
ing my anger at, contempt tor and dis-
appointment with those who felt it nec-
essary to eavesdrop on the iaculty meet-
ing, to seek publicity through symbolism
oi desecrating and displaying an Ameri-
can flag at the iaculty meeting, or to
send anonymous threatening letters.
These actions are at best counterproduo
tive to the goals supposedly held clear
by their perpetrators, These attempts
to hide behind anonymity, an unwilling
ness to take a stand publicly, bespeak a
moral cowardice. Al. a time when
charges of complicity are being thrown
about, the silence of those who were
aware of these actions and did nothing
to interfere with them might ask theme
selves it they too have engaged in com-
plicity.

The issues which the Grinnell commune
lty is now confronting are perhaps tri-
vial in the greater scheme of things;
nevertheless, the manner in which they
are solved is indicative of the way the
college will solve other problems which
are now and Will continue to confront it.
It is my conviction that these problems
can be met and solved through rational
and public interchange of ideas, and can
be affected only adversely by the re
treat into anonymity and irresponsible
actions.

“Give me ROTC or
give me death!"

(The son was given the following letter
by Mr. Guroii, who found it ill his mail-
box. It is the less obscene or two letters
referred to in Gurott's Letter to the Edi<
lot, The 3&3 feels the letter must be a
gas.)

I am but a man. Born and raised and
where someday I shall die in the United
States at America. I am a proud man.
Proud of my country and at the beliels
for which it Stands. When I came to
Grinnell I was proud. It was a school
where a man's individual liberty was ad-
mired. It was a place where I could see
respect lor liberty, All that has changed
and I, I have set back and watched it
happen. Unbelieving, I have watched my
liberty, my rights, my life be destroyed.
I said they have a right to pursue their
rights, to express their views, to exercise
their liberty and what has happened?
Gone is my liberty! I am no longer ﬁres
to choose my path to happiness.

YOU came to me and said, “I have a
right to demonstrate in an effort to seek
change," and I said, "you have that
right."

You came to me and said, “I have
a right to seek to end the draft," and I
said, “you have that right."

You came to me and said, “I! I don‘t
choose to serve in the armed forces I
have the right not to serve" and 1 said,
“you have the right.”

I came to you and said, “I have the
right to serve in the armed forces of my
country” and you said, “I have not the
right."

I HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO SERVE,

1 cannot belong to AFROTC because it
does not uphold the lofty traditions and
aims of this college, and closer to the
truth because it allows me to serve my
country's anned forces in my best ca-
paelty.

I HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO SERVEI

How dare you take away my rights, I,
who was ready to die for my country,
for the beliefs for which it stands: to
protect your rights, your liberty, and
yet you seek to take from me my most
precious possession, my LIBERTY.

And What am I to do? I have talked
with you. I have pleaded with you. i
have begged you,

I Shall Talk No More.

I Shall Plead No More.

1 Shall Beg No More.

MY LIBERTY is MINE and the Lord's
mercy be on the souls of they who at-
tempt to deprive me or my LIBERTY.

Defends ROTC Alternative

To the Editor:

As the committee appointed by Mr.
Wall studies the question of withdraw
ing academic credit from the AFROTC
program, ! suggest that its members
consider whether the issue would be al-
tered if the year were 1944 instead of
1969. For the sake of Grinnell’s charac<
ter as a liberal arts college, the answer
should not be “yes."

Insisting that the academic content of
courses in all departments meet cer-
tain minimum standards of quality is a
sound principle by which to modiiy the
academic curriculum. But educational
concern should not be a pretext tor the
expression of the current opinions of
some members of the college on immedi-
ate political issues. When the liberal alts
college bases its academic policies up-
on the political atmosphere of the mo-
ment, it denies the essence of its own
being, for it is then no longer I “liberal"
but a partisan institution.

Hey, Grinnell College studentl Are
you tired or taking s-—t from the

town? When you are downtown do you
enjoy jumping out or the way of cars
that seem to be aimed at you? Now
think about why these things happen.
You are arrogant outsiders from big
cities; you descend upon Grinnell for
short lengths or time; while you are
here you look down upon Iowa and its
inhabitants, you criticize and laugh at
Grinnell's relative (nearly absolute)
cultural deprivation, and generally
View with scam the local inhabitants
who call this community their home.

This situation has existed for so long
that the college has institutionalized this
fear and misunderstanding; and the
college community has complacehtly
gone along ”because it's always been
that way." Have you ever been to A
college dance? I have a feeling that
I'm not the only one on this campus
who is uptight about the number of
FIGS on campus every Saturday night.
Why are they there? If you are so up.
tight about your personal safety at coi-
Iega dances that you prefer PIGS to
townies, then you are more paranoid
than this article. I mean, its our turf,
private property, right? PIGS are only
allowed with I search warrant, right?
Bull .

Those PIGS are there because a
bunch of old ladies run the Forum, give
sanction to scheduling of events, and
set down Forum policies in general.
Students just don't make rules like “no
barefoot in the Forum." Why Should
student Forum Workers wear a tie, or
be supervised by some old hag placed
there by the administration? My an-
swers to these questions may seem ob-
vious, but since Grinnell Students don't
grasp the meaning of action as well as
words, I will explicate.

Nothing would do more good for
town-college relations than an open in-
Vilation to teenagers in this town for
them to use college facilities. By tak-
ing responsibility as hosts the student
body would be challenged to confront
town stereotypes in the face, It would
be like meeting a nigger tor the first
time, right? Since we are all liberal!
here, I know that everyone agrees with
me, so far. Such a step would simul-
taneously remove any excuse for PIGS
being on college land. Finally, and
most important, these two steps will
he the first in the inevitable complete
turnover of the Forum's administration
to students, The administration has
their building, the taculty has many,
even B.&G. has two. The Forum is ours
by right of occupancy —— we want it.
