Mock Convention Procedures
To Simulate National Rules

By Anne Bradley

In lormulating the rules for
the Young Democratic Mock
Political Convention an at—
tempt has been made to simu-
late as nearly as possible the
rules used at the Democratic
National Convention. Since
there is a total of 2,316 votes,
there will be approximately
one delegate for each seven
yotes.

States will be given the floor
in alphabetical order to make
nominations for President and
VicevPresident. A state which
does not Wish to make a nom-
ination may either pass or
yield to another state.

Nominating speeches will be
limited to four minutes and
seconding speeches to two min-
utes for each Presidential and
Vice-Presidential Candidate.

A delegation may be polled
during the balloting, but an in-
novatlon from the National
Convention is being introduced
to speed up the polling process.
The convention chairman may
send a representative of the
chair to poll a delegation while
the regular balloting Continues
uninterrupted.

At the National Conventions
the rules and procedures of the
House of Representatives are
utilized, but the Mock Conven-
tion Will use Robert’s Rules of
Order since these are more
familiar to the delegates.

The National Convention re
quires that all delegates sup-
port the Democratic ticket in
November, but this has been
eliminated from these rules
since it has no real significance
for the Mock Convention.

By Jim Parkison

The Rules for the Young Re<
publican Mock Convention are
essentially a combination of the
rules which prevail for the Na-
tional Convention and those
which control the annual Grim
nell Student Government Con-
vention. There are however,
lsome notable exceptions to
these rules which have been
instituted to dlzal with the prob»
lems peculiar, to the Mock Con-
vention.

The most important of these
differences is that no unit rule
will be permitted whereby the
entire votes oi a delegation
would go to a candidate who
in a caucus received a major
ity of the delegation’s votes.
Nomination speeches will be
limited to five minutes in dur-
ation. One three minute sec-
onding speech will be permitted
which may be followed by a
demonstration of five minutes.

The same procedure is to be
followed for the nomination of
the Vice- Presidential candi—
dates except that the nominat-
ing speech may not exceed four
minutes and the demonstration
is to be conducted by (112187
gates in place.

Copies of the rules have been
distributed to the delegation
chairmen and the campaign
managers tor the various can»
didates, The rules will be sub-
mitted to the convention this
evening for consideration and
adoption.

Eugene McCarthy, liberal, intellectual,
Supported for His Experience, Dedication

By Marilyn Alt

The Democratic nominee for
Vice President must be a man
who has an interest in as well
as a knowledge of politics. This
man is Senator Eugene McCar-
thy of Minnesota, McCarthy

sota, graduating from St.
John's College in 1935. He re»
ceived his M. A in economics
from the University of Minne»

McCarthy began his career
of public service during World

Goldwater Speaks

By Mark Ferdinand

The voter cannot expect to
agree with a candidate's total
philosophy, only with his politir
cal philosophy. Moreover, a
vote for a candidate does not
necessarily endorse his entire
political position, only his basic
political principles, Principles
are important, for it is only in
terms of principles that a can-
didate can offer us a program
and indicate his future course,
not by floating abstractions and
contradictory promises about
a miscellaneous Collection of
concrete, short-term issues.
Views on whether the United
States should or should not
withdraw from the United Na-
tions are not principles; views
on whether a nation should or
should not protect its sover-
eignty are princip1e5#prin-
ciples that cover many issues
besides the U, N.

Thus, a principle is an ab-
straction which subsumes a
great number of concretes. It
is only by means oi principles
that men can judge the alterna-
tives conironting them and pro-
ject their future. If a candi-
date does not integrate pieces
meal goals into conceptual
terms, but rather Conducts his
campaign in terms of con-
cretes, he requests the voters
to hand him a blank check for
power. If a candidate evades,
equivocates and hides his stand
under a junkrheap oi random
concretes, it is impossible to
predict his future course of ac-
tion.

With this as a standard, it is

easy to see why Senator Barry ,

Goldwater is the best candidate
in the field today. The major
difference between
and his opponents is this: They
believe that some elements of
ireedom are compatible with
government controls; he be
lieves that some government

controls are compatible with -’

ireedom, In the conscience of a
conservative he wrote. “I have
little interest
government or in making it
more eilicient, for 1 mean to

choice and creativity. I stand
against the gray sameness of
growing government, against
the conformity of collectism,
. r " These principles far out-
weigh the lesser flaws of his
campaign. His direction is
right.

He considers a Civil right “a
right that is asserted and is
therefore protected by some
Valid law," and adds, “There
may be some rights that should

 

also be civil rights. But if we
desire to give such rights the
protection of the law, our re-
course is to a legislature or to
the amendment procedure of
the Constitution. In the mean-
time, we must recognize the
States’ jurisdiction in certain
areas. The definition of States'
Rights is clear in the Constitu-
tion. ”The powers not delegated
to the United States by the
Constitution nor prohibited by
it to the States are reserved to
Lhe States respectively, or to
the people.” Throughout the
present “civil rights“ contro-
versy, for example, States'
Rights implies ”That the States
have a right to act, or not to
act, as they see fit."

Underlying these legal pre<
cepts is the notion that “esserb
tially local problems are best
dealt with by the people most
directly concerned” Goldwat-
er has repeatedly said: “We
can’t pass a law that will make
you like me or me like you.
This has to be done between
us." He makes a sharp distinc-
tion between the civil rights
that are guaranteed under the
Constitution and the rights of
association which are basically
moral issues and cannot be
solved simply by passing unen-
forceable laws.
