‘ Pioneers Held Under In Swim Season;
Finish Seventh At Conference Meet

The Pioneer swimming team
finished a lean season last week-
end, when they took seventh place
in the conference meet at Law-
rence, scoring lo points. Cornell
won the meet easily with 66v,
points.

5' The only bright spot in an other-
wise lackluster performance was
the setting of a conference record
by Ken Adelman in the ZOO-yard
butterﬂy. Previous record was
2:155, which Adelman broke in
the preliminaries with a time of

, 2311.9. The Pioneers altogether
picked up one second, one fourth.
and one sixth to score their ten
points.

Adelman was the tap Pioneer
finisher with a second place time
of 2: 13.2 in the ZOO—yard butterfly
in the finals. Steve Holtze picked
tip the Pioneer fourth in the Zoo

yard individual medley. Hollze and
Adelman then joined Bob Wells
and Bill Lantl an the sixth place
too-yard relay team.

The team has been hindered all
season by its lack of size and
strength and consequent spotty
weaknesses. The team has done a
creditable job of overcoming this
problem all season. but it proved
a crippling handicap at the confer-
ence meet.

Unfortunately, Coach Irv Si-
mone has to how out at a time
when the swimming fortunes are
at a low and when the chances for
improvement are not too encour-
aging. Perhaps the lack of facili—
ties for the swimmers is failing to
attract potential Pioneer swim-
mers, and will contine to hinder
the development of a solid swim-
ming team.

Basketball Season Ends Dismal/y

As Frantz Rewrite: Record Books

The Pioneer basketball team
finished a dismal season last
weekend with a pair of losses to
Knox and Monmouth. Also dismal
is the departure of Jeri Frantz
after this season with its Grinnell

points, more than two hundred ov-
er his nearest competitor. Already
in seventh place on the list after
only his first two years of play-
ing. Jeff easily overlook the first
six with his 412 points this year.
The point-count of this year was a
drop from his record year of 1964-
65 when he poured through 512
points. This can prohahly be ex-
plained by the fact that he Went
out for football this year so that he
had a more ditiicult time getting
in shape for basketball and also
had to spend a great portion of his
time battling lor rebounds which
left less time for scoring. This
way, though, he became the top
rebounder for the Pioneers

Jeff's scon‘ng average over the
three years was 19.33, just a
shade llnder the all-time best Pio
neer murki Jeff also holds the
scoring record of 46 points for a
single game. in addition he holds
five more offensive records, but
he also holds the record for the
