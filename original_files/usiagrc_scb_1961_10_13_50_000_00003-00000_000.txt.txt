Indrani To Present
lndian Dance Forms

by Craig Henderson

Indrani, who faced the moral
censorship of her nation and the
rigors and detail of Indian clas—
sic dance to develop her great
talent Will present several or the
most obscure styles of this fas-
cinating art form in Robertsi
theater Thursda, Oct. 19. Tltis‘
will be part of the regional Cons
iercnce‘on Asian Attairs. Two
performances will be given, at
7:30 and 0 pm. _ ‘

The Indian classic dance in.
volves several of the arts, for
it is music plus dance plus dra—
ma, and the total effect has
been described as ”sculpture in
motion” To the West the dance
is similar to the ancient mime -
a highly stylized llleaterrai'l: in
which every attitude and move-
ment conveys a poetic symbol
which the onlooker can translate
for himself aiid for his own ins‘
spii-ation. ,

The complex rules of the art
date back to the dawn oi civ ,
zation, and today they includc‘
24 movements or single hands,‘

 

13 for combined hands, In arm:

movements, five chest move l
merits, five each of waist, thighi
and hip movements and 36 kinds
of glances for expressing various
sentiments. I

The dance is at a religious
origin and is performed today ,
as a religious expression, The l
movements of the dancer tell
a poem or epic lay of the gods
and goddesses. All oi these de—
tailed movements are beyond
most Westerners, however.
instead they see a “flashing,

kind of Sculpture-in-nlotion. bril-;

New Laundry and Cleaning
Village Opening in Grinnell

The spectacular new development in cleaning clothes —a
sellrscrvice liryclcauiug — will be introduced in Griiinell the
week of October lo and 20 m A SPECTACULAR GRAND
(iPENiNG CELEBRATION AT THE NORGE LAUNDRY
AND CLEANING VILLAGE AT 3RD AND STATE STREET
WITH FREE DRY CLEANING To THE PUBLIC FROM
COUPONS mom THE HERALDVREGISTER AND GRIN.
NELL SCARLET AND BLACK. The new drycleaniiig ser—
vice is amazing. Just toss in an arm load of clothes, insert
six quarters, and the machine (you use your own machine)
whirls gently and quietly through a 45-minute clean and
dry cycle. You can actually watch your clothes being claim-
ed through a window in the door. The new “Village” is pro-
viding complete laundry and cleaning service to the public.
The coinvopcl'ntcd dryulellning iliiit will clean anything trom
a man's suit to a formal evening dress, Eight separate ma—
chines are available for customer convenience.

Housewives will be able to do both laundry and or cleaning
at the new Laundry and Cleaning Village in a single visit. _

The (li'ycleﬂning machines clean eight pounds of garments
(8 to 10 dresses) in approximately 45 minutes i . . for only
$1.50. The dl'yclcancr provides it means for the Consumer to
:dryclcan L'lothus personally. at a quarter of the cost and a
fraction of time normally required.

The cleaner utilizes a specially rormuliited clefuling sol-
vent iroin ii single nitration . stem. The solvent (known as
Norg-Clor) is constantly riitcrod and distilled through
unique purification system.

One or the on tanning abilities of the machine is that
it has "builtrin wi-i lilo—tree cleaning” with only a touching
with a steam ii-on needed at most. Housewives should really
like the new and economical onestop laundry and clean:
ing service.
