'7 . Recreation Unlimited;

_ by Dale Furnish
in a Grinnell college community- wli c one ot‘lhe Sttldciits’
biggest gripes is, “There’s nothing to do," the physical education
departments are trying to do something about it. A program

which was started this (all by the construction of a dual ilCQ‘

rink and ,Ihe acquisition or skis, toboggans and a ski slope, _is
now branching out into other protects, with seemingly onlimit~
ed potential for providing the Grinnellian with something to do
with himself. _ - _

Although the weather has handicapped the skiing and skat—

ing programs tno ski trips have. been possible‘ yet, and only
one skating rink is usable), there are other, more certain activ-
il.es planned for the future by Coach lrv Simone, who is admin—
i.ering the program. » _ ‘ ,
Sunday in the projection room in Bur-ling library’s basement,
there will be tour lialbhotli' meetings starting with sk ng at
7.30 pm. 7 covering skiing, canoe » s, sailing, and ice fishi g
possibilities. Harry Bitter, of Grinnell, an experienced ice fisher—
man who lives on Rock-Creek lake, and several at his friends
have consented la ‘l‘iClp start this activity. _

Bus trips to Town city to see Big Ten athletic contests,
with- a dinner in Amana on the way, are in the ofiing. Three
ddlcs ior basketball games are already tentatively set. Slmone‘
pointed out that similar trips to uLhCr clues to see spol'ilng‘
events, to take advantage of a big name band's presence or to.
attend a play are also possible. . _ _

Plans for alter spring vocation include a one and a half day’
canoe trip every weekend on the lowa rivcr tor some 20 peo-,1
pie. This trip would cover the 30 miles between Tania and Mar»
shalltown and would involve a night of camping out. The trips‘
u-oud be coed, but' before students could go they would haveeto
bc eheck‘ed out for swimmingand canoeing ability: , _ l

- Watch for a “recreational area" on the post ottice bulletin,
hoard. Announcements of lurthei- devlopnients will also be made]
over the radio station and in thaQuad dining room. ‘t

All the possibilities are too numerous to discuss at length,
but in abbreviated form here is the itinerary ot.the program at

So there you have it. Simone and the athletic department
have worked hard setting their program up, and there is a great
deal in it that shotild appeal to Gi-innell students—Certainly
something for all interesisveven sophisticates who might scoff
at riding on a bus, The opportunities for dating and hail func-
tions are there in a scope that has been lacking at this school.

As Simone further points, "We’ll consider any reasonable r ,
quest tron-i any group that has a good idea but needs a means
of transportation and someone to make the arrangements, The
tools are all there. There's no reason to stop here—a spring va-
cation to Sun Valley for skiing ~01‘ a Christmas trip to Florida

>ol* the island of \Nassau wouldn't be out of the question if-

The only limit on this thing is your imagination."
enough students had the time and the money.
