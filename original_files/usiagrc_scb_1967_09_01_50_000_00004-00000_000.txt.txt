GRAY MATTER

It is Fall once again and time
tor the Grinneii campus to
plunge into the alirencompds-

sing world at LM. sports. Tile
Intensity with which they are
played, the bitter personal an-
tagonisms which are built up,
the crushing physical contact,
the halting of officials and the
poetry in motion are all part or
the Grinnell sports scene. 0i
course, not everyone takes it
as seriously as the girls
(chuckle). There is nothing like
an I.M. program to provide
hall spirit, so for the rookies
in camp and tor the beneiit
of tile returning veterans, a
briei recap or last year's ac-
tivities is in order.

The year began with Dibble
Winning tootball, ﬁnishing 9-1.

Gates was a surprise second
at 3-2. In tennis, which was
run concurrently, North won

splashed to a it point victory
over Smith in swimming. This
appeared to be the least pollu-

of eleven halls entered. Norlh

leyball, Smilli look the ﬁrst of
their many trophies as they
captured the badminton title.
Dibble became the First hall [0

Smith won howling tor the
third year in a row while Dibble
finished second (or the third
year in a row. Steve Hunt. had
both high game and high Sei‘<
ies. To ﬁnish the year, East
came on strong to take the
track meet, featuring three
lirsis by Mike Schwartz, and
capture soitball with a 9-1
mark. Smith won goll to end
competition. Smith won the

points in all the I.M. sports.
Dibble finished second, Not‘lh
third and East lourth. Coupled
itith the action emanating [mm
the iemtnine set, the LM. year
was most exciting and di-
verting. But putting the past
behind (which is a good place
tor it) I take pen in hand to
make some rash and totally
untounded predictions lor the
football season.

Counting down an opponent’s original suit distribution is one
at the fundamental techniques used in otiense and defense. In ad-
dition to providing absolute lacts, such as when a player rails to
follow suit, counts Obtained from inferences In the bidding and in-
lerences ti-orii leads and the play at the hand are used to gain it
piclui-e ol the opposing hand.

Against this slam contract, west led the deuce of Hearts. which
was won by East’s ace. Deciarer won the next trick with the Eco
or Diamonds when East returned the king. Apparently the succesi
oi the contract depended upon the successful linesse against the
queen of Clubs, which could be laken either way. Locating the
queen oi Clubs. then, is the key to the contract. and counting
down the hands is the key to locating the Club queen.

Declarer led a Diamond from dummy which was rutied. The
board was rcentered With the trump nine, and another Diamond
was rutied. A second low trump was taken by the diimmy's ten
and the last Diamond was ruffed.

At this point, declarer had a periect count on East’s hand,
Since West was void of ttumps, East must have started with
three. The play or the Diamond suit revealed that each opponent
had four Diamonds, These two counts were definite. The Count of
the Heart suit was by inference. West led the deuce oi his partner"!

East had live Hearts (by inference), three Spades and (our

The ace oi Clubs was laid down to protect against a singleton
