Stein Heads,
Forum Coup

As probably everyone knoivs by
now, The Forum was taken over
by students last Saturday. Ap-
proximately 100 students, plus a
few RA’s and Mr, Crossett, who
was playing bridge, remained
alter the 1:3u AM. closing time
and listened to independence 398
or watched the movie in the
coflee-house, When many did not
leave at 1-30, Assistant Dean,
Dennis Donham was called, He
tlleli called Dean Kimbo, who
arrived at the Forum at ap
proximately 2:00 A M. He agreed
to leave Jon Stein in charge until
the students leit, many oi whom
remained until 3:30 to help clean
up.

The takeover is said to have
been the spontaneous reaction of
students’ objecting to the early
closing time. They ieel that
students shollld be allowed to
take responsibility for their
actions and for the building
without adult supervision. The
administration claims that this
would leave the college open to
liability suits.

Stein and other members of the
Student Forum Committee have
been meeting all week with
members of the administration
in order to have their proposals
considered These include
opening the building at to A M
Sundays, closing it at midnight
Sunday, 1 A M Monday thru
Thursday, and 2 AM. Friday and
Saturday with student supei»
Vision during the extended hours,
If decisions on these matters
have not been reached by
tomorrow, a mass sleeprln with
breakfast served in the coffee-
house is being considered.

“white men with dark skins,”
This kind of assimilation was
designed to keep a subordinate

a minimum of violence," making
it believe it could be accepted
by embracing white culture.

roles in society. When blacks
realized this, their conditioning

ful of white students began
with recordings of two of
King’s most famous speeches
and poetry readings by Irma
McClaurin. Professor E d win
Gilmour, Tom Thomas, Presi-
tlent Glenn Leggett, Professor
Donald Macalady, and David
Lewis all presented their reac-
tions to the position of the
black movement today. This
was followed by a free-wheel—
ing discussion which ended at
noon.

Saturday afternoon’s college
convocation began with open-
ing remarks by Meryl Penson
and a short speech on “This is
America” by Laurence Wright.
A recording oi Dick Gregory's
views of college education and
a film excerpt of King's visit
to Grinnell preceded the main
speaker.

Mr. V. Lonnie Peek, th, div
rector of black studies at
Wayne State Community Col-
lege, spoke on "The Role oi
Black Studelits in a White In-
stitution.” l-le asserted that the
purpose of education is politi-
cal 7 “to prepare people for
sluts in society, Schools will try
to suppress dissideiice; how
ever, blacks must present clee
mauds t0 the administration."

“Black culture is only a
springboard to political action,”
he declared. ”Black students
should have programs based on
political power to gain econom-
ic power, Black studies says
‘black is the ioundation.’ What
people should realize is that
93% oi the black programs will
help the community as a
whole."

Peek also talked about the
black problem in all of Amer
ica. He stated that a “slave
mentality” persists in Amer-
ica. Whites can justify discrim-
ination against blacks by calls
‘ng them “shii'tless” and
