COUNCIL EXPLAINS ROLE

By CRAIG ALLIN

Inst week, Grinnell’s new
student-faculty Judicial Council
convened to talk informally
about its role. The Council is
composed of Professors Joseph
Danforth (Chemistry), Harold
Fletcher (Political Science), and
Arnold Adelberg (Mathematics)
whom the council has chosen
chairman. Sue Dostal, Larry
Frank, and Russell Heucken-
dorf represent the student body.

The faculty members were
appointed by President Leggett,
on the recommendation of the
Chairman of the Faculty, Jos-
eph Wall. The student mem-
bers were chosen by a joint
committee of the AWS Board
and the Council of House Pres-
idents after interviewing appli~
cents. Their appointments were
confirmed by the Senate.

Members of the council talked
extensively about their role in
the community and it was ap-
parent that the campus is in
for a major change in the
handling of judical cases.
Dostal stressed the structural
differences between the Judicial
Council and the old court sys-
tem. The old judicial structure,
with three student courts, the
'deans and the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs, was
characterized as fragmented and
legalistic. D o s t a 1 pointed
out that jurisdictional disputes
were common in the past in
spite of the elaborate jurisdie
tional guidelines set down in
the Student Handbook.

The Judicial Council's char-
ter gives it original jurisdiction
in all cases where jurisdiction
is not with the house councils.
it has appellate jurisdiction in
all cases. Council members em.
phasized that any member of
the campus community could
bring cases before the council
but suggested that they might
return some cases to the house
councils, where the houses have
jurisdiction.

typical tyrannical aspects ap-
peared the more obvious.

The country accents endemic
to Southeast England of the
Corinthian and Theban shep<
herds contrasted beautifully with
the “correct” accents of the
king.

The contrast emphasized the
difference in station between
Oedipus and the peasants, and
the differences between high
and low accents made Oedipus‘
fall the more poignant.

Dr. Amott, a prolessor at the
University of Iowa, and a na»
tive ot ipswlch, England, makes
his oWn puppets.

“In America people accept
puppetry as a media much
more readily," Arnott explained.
“in England I had to fight tra-
dltion to portray the classics.”

He said he intended his pro-
ductions to complement Grinnell
freshman Humanities courses.

Arnutt has prepared a puppet
production of Agamemmnon,
and hopes to complete produc-
tions ofthe Oreslia.

and policy making functions
which has been accomplished.
The old Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs, which now deals
exclusively with policy making,
has been remodeled and now
consists of three representa<
fives each of the faculty, ad-
ministration, and student body.
This separation allows the Ju-
dicial Council to deal with ju-
dicial matters exclusively.

It was evident that all the
council members were eager to
fulfill the highest expectations
of the creators of the new coun-
cil. There was general agree-
ment that a consistent council
policy was essential. This does
not mean however. Flet-
cher stressed, that cases will
not be judged in context, weigh-
ing all relevant tacts. “The
stress," F l e l. c h e r continued,
“must be on problem solving,‘
not on the metlng out of pun-
lshments."

While council members werc
not unaware of their differ-
ences, there was a definite sense
of unity. Fletcher suggested that
the faculty members were just
that, and were not the repre«
sentative of the administration.
To this Heuckendorf added that
it was their hope to escape stu-
dent or‘ faculty parochial inter-
ests and speak for the whole
community. it was evident that
the council member hoped to
achieve unanimity in most of
their decisions.

Several members emphasized
the positive contributions that
the court hoped to make to
c a m p u 5 life. Dostal stress
ed consistency based on under-
tanding which Fletcher point-
ed out would allow for tho
rational appraisal of the con-
sequences of certain violations
based on court decisions. The
council appears to be trying to
orient itself as much as pos-
sible toward a problem solving
approach to its work.

The council was understand-
ably silent about some crucial
specifics of rule adjudication.
it seems probable that only
preliminary discussions have
been held in this area. The fol-
lowing things, however. became
clear during the discussion.
First, the council recognizes the
seriousness of using separation
from the college as a punish-
ment, though the possibility of
its use in particularly serious
cases was not discounted. Sec-
and, the council is cognizant oi
the unsatisfactory and unfortu-
nate allocation of penalties
which occurred under the old
structures. Dostal made it
clear th at she fell, “past
cases have not been marked by
consistency in decisions or equi-
ty in punishments."

The usefulness of this year'l

the college community.
