Women '5' low court elaborates ground rules

The Woman‘s Primary Court would like to offer the follows
ing Clarification of its method of operation in order thzit stun
dents may better understand this branch of their government
and in order that the Court may proceed more eifieienll)’ and
eii'cctil'cly. Any questions which are left unanswered by the (ol—
iowing statement {nay bl: directed to the Chief Magistrate. Myrna
Sillnption, and will be welcomed.

I. CLASSIFICATION OF CASES
Because the W'omen's Primary Court deals with Cases of two
distinct types, there are two different pi'oeedui utilized, The
two types of cases might be labelled “minOl and "major,"
based upon the relative weighting of the offenses involve , but
the chief distinguishing feature is the nature of the evidence
available.

Minor Cascs are those involving “primn fncic" evidence,
that which inconlcsiablv establishes lhc guih of the defendant.
(c. g. lalcncss cases, wherein a card signed upon late entry is
the available evidence). The question in these cases is one of
the circumstances behind the late enli-y, for example, and a
hearing is held to determine the degree of responsibility of the
defendant within the snuafion, In these cases (he prosecutor is
not necessary. However. witnesses may be produced by the de»
fendant. Cases falling into this category are late entries and
sign-in or signvout violations. those winch consiiuiic ihc orci»
whelming majority of the Court's transactions.

Major Cases are those where there is a question of the
guilt of the defendant, where there is no such incontestablc
evidence as a form signed by the defendant. In these cases
a prosecutor presents evidence on behalf of the Executive
Branch in the effort to establish guilt and ordinary trial pre-
ccdul'e is followed as it is outlined below.

II. PROCEDURE BY “’HICH A CASE COMES TO THE COURT

A. A charge is filed by the apprehending officer with the
AWS Board. ’

B. The AWS Board eltlrilics the charge and scnds it to the
Court Secrelai‘yi through the olticc of the Dean of Women:

C. The Cfiurt Secretary notifies the defendant of (hc charges
and the date of the hearing, and obtains a preliminary plea

D. The Court Secretary notifies the Prosecutor of the plea
in order that she may prepare for a hearing if the plea is
“guilty" or a trial if the plea is “not guilty".

(In cases of the “minor" type the evidence e.g. the late entry
card signed by the (lefendantris Sent directly to the office
of the Dean of Women by the Night Check Monitor and from
there is forwarded to the Court),

CLARIFICATIONS OF THIS. COUKT‘S POSITION

A The Women's Primary Court is a student court, ins'
tuted (o eneouiage conlorimty with our student rules, as legis
lated by the Senate, We cannot, fhcrcforc, integrally involve
sfaff personnel such as Housemothers in Court proceedings.

B. In cases where [he only defense witness is the defendant
herself and where the arresting officer is a duly empowered
student official, the word of this otticcr will be Considered to
establish the Circumstances unless the Court rules that the
situation was one in which the officer might reasonably have
been mistaken.

C. Precedents ensure Continuity of the law and equal treat—

thereby introducing rigidity and injustice into the system.

D. Information given by the deIendant to a member of the
Administration or other College Staff personnel in private con»
fel'eiice will not be considered admissable evidence for the pros
ecution.

E Enforcement of Court imposed penalties is a function of the
Evccufn-c Branch. since strict. supervision in pcnaliics such
as hail conhncincni would place a burden on the executive
oiiicar equal to (hai on the dcfcndani, it is e pected that pen-
aiucs will be accepted and served voluntarily with minimum
supervision and maximum rospccl for the integrity of the ins
(lividuals involved.
F Cooperation with (he Court and our Student Government
Association is nccessm-y for ihc cxisicncc and effective opera~
(ion of these systems if is expected. therefore, that anyone
who pleads “not guilty" buf is subsequently proven guilty by
the evidence will he subiccf to a more severe penalty.
