Ed. Notei While scrounging around
[he files the other night, the editors
cams across this bit oi historical
muckracking. Though it was written
last spring _ yes, VirgInia, there is is
spring In lows — it retains relevance
for our changeridden campus.

By Anne Farrer

The 5&3. in a zealous burst of jour-
nalistic crusading, this week presents
the history of prepping at Grinneli.

With typical 5&8 rhetoric, we editor-
ialized on February 27, 1929: "Prepping
makes an institution more than an edu-
cation factory . t is part oi the sugar
coating on the pi oi wisdom.” This
came hot on the heels of President
Main's plea to do away with hazing.
However tradition dies hard and there
fore prepping didn't —« prepping was
carried on from the first day of school
til the last, with one Hell Week each
semester. However, slight modification
was made in the prep pragramithere
could be no hazing activity for two
hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday respectively; the tire drill
(preps running a gauniet oi paddles up
and down ﬁre escapes) was discontinued
because it was thought to endanger
various trosh lives with “some plung-
lng down full flights of stairs”; and "at-
tempting to limit destruction to the
campus area.“

By 193061 one house mother threatened
to pack up and leave because of prep«
ping activities and In 1933 prep days
were suspended because the Dean of Wo-
men died.

Prepping Dying Difﬁcult Death

in 1932 the purposes of prepping were
defined as follows: orienting the fresir
men, aiding them in meeting everyday
problems with the proper mental atti-
iude, aiding them in maintaining good
scholastic standing, imbuing them with
the Grinnell spirit, and impressing upon
them respect tor their elders, Or as
the 58.3 so aptly put it: “Kinks In his
character may be ironed out by pre-
sentiitg him to himseli as others see
him." The prepping program at this
point consisted or six branches: upper-
classmen acting as advisors tor iresh-
men, a course in social etiquette based
on the West Point Code, menial duties
(such as giving up beds for visiting alum<
hi and sleeping in the eave troughs),
observance of rules, probation days, and
a formal dinner and initation.

In 193334 a “New Deal” for freshmen
was instituted. Stemming from several
uniurtunate incidents — a stunt per-
formed by freshmen upon which the
5&3 did not elaborate but only Stated,
“Men avoided meeting the eyes of coeds
and snickered sell-consciously" and a
lreshman breaking Into the Quad and
entering rooms alter hours — the er~
gram stressed the status aspect of weara
ing a beanie and paddling was ceased.
Although wearing a beanie was only a
“privilege," there were penalties for not
doing so: first violation, — a warning,
second—withdrawal of social privileges,
third expulsion from one's hall, fuurth~
expulsion tram school.

Grinneii supposedly being the forerun-
ner of educational liberalism west of
the Mississippi, extensive prepping at

women began in 1937-38. The most overt
aspect or this was the Grinnell Stoup‘
on sight of an upperclassman, the
freshman girl dropped her books, bit
the dust in a nifty curtsy while slmul<
taneously putting an orange (required)
bow in her hair.

Again in 194142 a new Grinnellizatlon
program was instituted, based on a point
system —- alter earning 1000 points the
freshman no longer had to wear his
beanie. 75 points could be had for learn-
ing all the school songs, 100 points for
earning a 1.75 g.p.a, and 100 points at
whatever time each freshman had had
at least one date.

From that time on prepping has gone
relatively down hill—calisthenics. mida
night hikes, and a couple at “Good God,
what's the younger generation coming
to" incidents have occurred, but on the
whole, the save troughs havs been un-
inhabited tor quite some time, as stress
is now placed on the socialization of
the freshman to his hall and the college.
