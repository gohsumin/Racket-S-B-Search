Ludwig pointed out, the college
enjoyed a rather limited regional
reputation.

“The stimulus of changing lead-
ership is very good for a college
lihe Grinnell. When new people
come they bring a hesh approach
to the institution,” Ludwig said,
expressing confidence in the cal-
lege's future under President
Glenn Leggett.

“ ‘nell is a great college,"
Ludwig said. “Probably greater
than most of the students realize,"

Grillnell's president Glenn Leg-
gett said that the college is be
ginning to get applications for
Lutlwig's position but that as of yet
there is no candidate.

“He's going to be difficult to re-
place," was Leggelt's comment,

were Bill Batschelet, 200 and 500

“We‘ve got several good individ-
