Leggett Nixes
Senate Call for
Business Halt

Despite o student senate
rmlutinn urging that “stu»
dents, faculty, administration
and staff cease business as
usual Nov. 13-14 in observance
of the Vietnam Moratorium.“
President Glenn Leggett said
Monday, “We're not going to
close up.”

In a memorandum released
Wednesday Leggett announced,
”I have directed that not only
the food and heating facilities
remain open but also that other
services (including the library,
the Forum, maid service,
health services, and the
Bookstore) remain open
November 13 and 14.”

The Nov, 3 senate resolution
had asked that all “non-
essential services" be closed for
the Moratorium and said “that
those who continue business as
usual implicitly sanction our
nation’s continued involvement
in Viemam.“

in an opinion referendum held
in lunch lines Monday. a
majority of the students voting
expressed support for the
senate position. The final vote
was: Agree-390; Disagree-315;
Undecided-ll).

in the memorandum Leggett
also said that he had asked
“supervisors of non-in-
structional departments to give
their employees the option of
working or not working. . ."

Leggett's memorandum ex-
plained that the decision on
whether or not to maintain
services had to be based not
on “the question of majority
versus minority opinion” but
rather “on the nature of a free
and liberal college, which does
not deny its members access
to normal services and
prerogatives simply because
some of the members have
opinions different from those of
others."

The president Monday ex-
pressed concern about ”all
kinds [If rumors that students
are planning to close down
operations by taking over the
library and the Forum."

“1 don't know what kind of
precautions could be taken." he
said “If it happens we’ll have
to deal with it as it happens."

Faculty Retains Moratorium Policy

in a special meeting Monday
the faculty approved by a 60-25
written vote the following
resolution regarding the Nov.
13-14 Vietnam Moratorium:

‘ ‘ T h e Grinnell faculty
recognizes the significance of
the Vietnam Moratorium by
emphasizing each individual
faculty member‘s and student's
option to observe the
Moratorium as he chooses."

The resolution is identical to
the one passed by the faculty
in regard to the October 15
Moratorium.

According to Asst. Prof. John
H. Wurley, faculty secretary, it
is implicit in the resolution that
students or faculty members
who do not attend classes
during the Moratorium will not
be penalized

However, Dean Joseph Wall
issued a memoradum on the
faculty decision Monday that
said: “The college does have
a contractual relationship with
its students regarding class
instruction, and the faculty
in e m b e r should make
provisions with the students in
the classes he has missed, for
whatever reason, to cover the
work, either through special
meetings of the class or in-
dividual conferences with the
students who desire such
meetings."

in Monday’s meeting Wall
asked the faculty in taking
action to separate the Novem»
ber Moratorium from the Dec»
ember Moratorium. which may
coincide with the final
examination period.

“If that happened, it would

call for a different kind of in-
stitutional consideration.” Wall
said He asked that faculty
allow the Academic Standing
Committee “to consider
alternatives" so that it can then
recommend a faculty position
on the December, and other
future Moratoriums, which are
expected to last until the War
ends, increasing in length by
one day each successive monthr

Polarization was evident
Monday as the faculty debated
the Moratorium issue.

Prof. Neal w. Klausner
(Philosophy) took the floor to
say that although he opposed
the War and “the stupid fulmin-
aticns of (Vice President Spiro)
Agnew,” he planned to hold
classes as scheduled. “I will
protest in my own manner,"

Klausner declared, “i don’t in-
tend to be threatened or
coerced by the senate statement
or by anybody."

Klausner was referring to a
student senate resolution urging
that Grinnellians cease business
as usual during the Morator-

ium. The resolution said that
“those who continue business as
usual implicitly sanction our
nation‘s continued involvement
in Vietnam."

Profs John R. Kleinschmidt
(French), chairman of the
faculty, reminded the faculty to
consider the “question of the col-
lege's contract with students”
and the “possible effects of sus-

Students Canvass
local Residents
In Nov. Action

By Mark Graeser

Some 150 college students and
a smattering of high-school stu-
dents and townspeople went into
town last night to talk with
people about the war. The can
vassing of the toWn was the
main thrust of the November
Vietnam Moratorium which
began yesterday and is con-
tinuing today.

Moratorium organizers, led
by freshman Berry Zigas,
divided Grinnell’s estimated
2000 resident units into blocks
of 20 units Students were urged
to go in pairs. preferably a boy
and a girl. Actual canvassing
got underway at 7 p.m. last
night.

Earlier yesterday afternoon
each unit was leafletted with
mimeographed “fact sheets,"
giving information and
statistics on the Vietnam war.
Another leaflet, entitled “The
Johnson-Nixon policy in Viet-
nam continues," was adapted
from an article in LF. Stone's
Weekly, “The Con Game of
‘Withdrawal’ From Vietnam.”

Organizers hoped the leaflets
would facilitate discussion later
Thursday when students went
to speak to townspeople about
the war.

The emphasis of the town-
gown dialogue was expressed
by junior John Otto at a Thurs-
day morning meeting of the
Moratorium Committee: “We
can’t force ourselves on them
(townspeople). We have to
speak in their language and not
use big words. We have to leave
their country alone. They must
see us as patriots trying to
improve their Country."

Zigas urged people to wear
a suit and tie if possible,
“Because people judge you on
your appearance." For some,
the desire to be accepted into
town homes led to hair-cuts,
which were administered in
North Lounge by a crew of
nimble-fingered barberettes.

if all the preparation paid off
and students gained access to
a house, they were instructed
to project friendlinms and an
open mind. As Zigas put it,
”tell people you are concerned
about the war and you want
to know how they feel."

In the event or a person ex-
pressing dissatisfaction at the
way Nixon is handling the war,
particularily if the person wants
a more rapid withdrawal, they
are being urged to write to
their elected officials in Wash-
ington, and in addition are
