The problem or the overseas
Chinese as a minority group is
present in Thailand as els -
where in Southeast Asia. it is
:- complex and serious problem,
one that affects young Chinese
students like my girls at Jane
Mays School,

Chinese communities have

and t~pe of noise in (he'
streets. Though the Thai peo-
ple originally came, iron.
China, the modern Chinese
riving- here are a distinct
group, and that is the way
they, at least the elders
among them, choose to keep
it.

munity of Bangkok live my

heavy metal gate across it and
inside is the family shop - a
room toll of bolts of cloth, mir-
rors. or grocery goods

Jane Chats ramily are third
generation Chinese in Thailand,
Annually they pay their “fares
igncrs" tax to the government
and their rent to the Indian

their home rests A Chinese
cannot own land unless, her
brother conridcd, he is clever
and puts it in the name oi his
Thai wife or adopted Thai
child. t
Jane Chal’s ramily is
but it cannot compare with"
Patama's for she has many
brothers who have married and‘
made their home in her father’s
ouse. Luckily the mirror bus-t

Until the Thai government
closed them, most Chinese
young people attended specs
ial Chinese schools. Even now
many parents require their
children to take evening class-
es in Mandarin, the orricial
national language of China,
Chinese history and custon .
tn addit' n to their regular
school work, this is a burden.

Now that they must attendl
the Thai schools these girls mlx‘
rwith Thai students and learn
the Thai language. As a result
some ot them tool as much
“Thai” as “Chinese," Seine girls,
the Jane Chai and Patama. are

try to escape being associatedr
with the Chinese: they willt

figures to prove it, either na—

more schools, and they are more

The Chziggzi people are rich,

plant coffee on their small plots,
They did, and today there are
about 50,000 growers, growing
an average or 400 pounds and
getting an average of 160.

The small amounts produced
by individual tarmers are not
enough to market protitably:
this is where the cooperative
societies come in. Each grower

belongs to a cooperative society,

and the eolicc produced by each
society is handled as one unlli

The main food or the people
is bananas (cooking banaliasi
more like potatoes than like
““sweet bananas," as the kind

grow on trees, and the little
