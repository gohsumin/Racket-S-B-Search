Concern Over Viet Nam

Suddenly the demonstrators have made us, the
Grinnell students, realize the concern over Viet Nam
more clearly.

They’re real students now, not just unseen critics.
VAnd they are students who have shared America with
us for about 20 years and who share our “conditioning"
to the problem of war.

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds have been led to re-
alize that many of the traditional views of war don't
fit the modern situation. Why, with the advances in
weaponry, are we fighting a “traditional” war? Why,
with advances in communications between nations, are
we fighting any war?

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds have been taught to
be open minded, and so we respect the views of people
who have lived through traditional wars, people who
think that demonstrations against the government's
stand in time of war is wrong.

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds ought to be respon-
sible to our government. It would be foolish to want to
try to undermine a system that allows the opportunity
to demonstrate as students are now doing.

Supposedly, also, we 20-year»olds have a commit-
ment to tell others how we feel a situation like Viet
Nam ought or ought not be handled. And why should
we let the rest of the country forget our feelings when
the deci on has been made against our favor?

Many students are demonstrating from a non-tra-
ditional, open-minded, edified, and idealistic stand-
point.

But they are being called cowards and communists.
They are detested and arrested. They burn draft cards
and get no understanding. They criticize and lower the
morale of our troops.

Is the student demonstrator being treated the right
way? By the time he is beaten by the angry survivors
of other wars, by the time he is called communist by
his government leaders, by the time he is fined lor
burning an insigniﬁcant piece of paper, he will prob-
lbly come to have doubts not only about the Viet Nam
situation but also about the intrinsic worth of a species
that knows what it is doing is wrong but that keeps it
up while bemoaning the lack of alternatives.

 

Educare Gives Faculty-Student Panel
Views Voiced on Discipline, Freedom

"Freedom and Discipline in
Higher Education” was the topic
or the second discussion sponsored
by Edueare. A panel consisting oi
Raymond liens (history) and Wal-

do Walker (biology) and students
Karen Lauicrbzich and Pete Koll-

Walker stated that ‘ nitial dis-
cipline is necessary to establish
the basic currency oi any held or
study." There was virtual agree-
ment on this point, but disagree-
ment over the extent to which
“entertainment” should be used to
motivate students.

invitation to individuals who wish

this a reasonable concern, when
one considers that the dogmatlsm
and conformism of the Party are
completely alien to l democratic
order? or is the Justice Depart-
ment seeking isolated incidents to
damage the reputation oi rll stu-
dent social and peace movements?

The second sltcmativc seems
more plausible: once again, the
power structure is leveling a cor-
porete innuendo sgzihst those who
do not follow its line. no iirst
