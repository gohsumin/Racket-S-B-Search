as the novel projects a radical im-
age of “man against the wall of
life.”

Ha proceeded to examine each of
the principle characters in, the
book, calling Jason, “one of the
ugliest people I‘ve ever met in fic-
tion," and applauding the Negro
maid Dilcey as the symbol of
“goodness and grace—the suffering
'servant."

“Only Dilcey understands and
endures," he continued crediting
her peace to her faith in an eternal
order. “She alone is whole and
healthy -— characteristics which
are a manifestation of her faith
and religion," he said.

As 1 Lay Dying he lauded as
Faulkner's “warmest, kindliest,
and most affectionate novel." Ex»
amining the plot which involves
the combined efforts of a family
to bury its mother according to her
wishes, he termed it “the height
of moral seriousness. Here the
tragic and humerous mingle and
the sublime and folkish come to
gether. The overall motive pushes
the action along."

Concluding his remarks by ap-
plying them to the dilemma of
modern man, Dean Miller said,
“We find it difficult to identify the
principles of realities in religion.
There seems to be no relevance to
the run of the mill existence."

As in the faith of fiction in
Faulkner, he stressed that the fun-
damental task of religion was “to
pay attention to life, not self."

“Religion at best is not con-

 

cerned with religion," he said. “it
is concerned with the clarification
of confusion of life and inner re-
lationships, of the evidences of
transcendence, and the fallen na-
ture of man as well as man's alien-
ation with himself.”

Clown With C

Dean Miller moved from the
large~scale metaphor of Faulkner
to “the walking symbol of the
clown" in_his final lecture of the
series Tuesday morning

“In the clown we can see reflec~
tion of reality normally not evi-
dent to us,” he said referring to
the prevalence of clown characters
in the arts of modern times.

Dr. Miller called Charlie Chaplin
“perhaps the greatest clown of our
age" and Emmett Kelley “the
greatest American clown," and
went on to examine the various
clown roles in modern literature.

“The clown has almost a religi-
ous significance," he said. “We
can see in him what we have re-
fused to see in Christ. In this same
context he said that the clown ex-
plores the mythology of self and
expands the dimensions of con-
sciousness. ,

“The clown deals with the cer-
tain categories of ,human exper-
ience that we see as mys-
teries," he continued. He termed
the role of the clown as a transcen-
dent one in relating these mys-
teries.

Tracing the character of Don
Quixote, Dean Miller said that in
having all the characters of a fool,
Cervantes‘ clown was Everyman.

”A fool is a fool, but what about

 

the fool who is wise? Don Quixote
has the intelligent moderation and
kindness to go with the absurd ex-
cesses. This is not in accord with
sheer comedy,” he said.

“Don Quixote acts out of a re
source beyond the banal routine of
facile conformity — in him the
various worlds collide."

Dr. Miller described the inspira-
tion of the clown as "solemn and
naive” and described his as a man
walking on a tightrope — “this is
life" he said.

Discussing Winston Bregner‘s
Doubtlng Thomas, in which all hu-
man action is routinized and every-
thing is computerized, he traced
the actions of the main characteri
Once each year, during a national
holiday, Thomas would escape his
rigid routine. disguise himself as a
clown, and mingle among the
crowds

"After ten years of this he was
held in deep affection — the peo«
ple looked forward to his advent,"
Dr. Miller continued. “In this char-
acter, mankind was redeemed by
the actions of its weakness in the
clown character, He reminded man
of his essential humanity and in
this way mankind is saved,"

According to the lecturer, man
sees in the clown what he prefers
not to see in himself. “The clown
recovers for us the nature of our
humanity,” he said turning to a
discussion of Wallace Steven's
poem, “The Comedian as a Capi-
tal C."

“This poem represents the myth-
ology of self —- man's absurd re-
lationship with the World," he said.

direct reference to Christianity
when he discussed the role of the
ciown as man’s “redeemer.”
“His is a salvation once uttered in
a term we no longer know how to
use — repent," he said

He claimed that the clown brings
mankind back to a two-level world:
“one in the dust and one in the
sky." He called the violence in-tn-
day's entertainment a product of
the one level world. Violence, he
said, is the substitute for humor.

Concluding with a discussion of
Christ in the “clown' role, Dean
Miller drew parallels. “Like the
clown, there is so little‘room in
the world for Christ; he too was in-
cognito — disguised in the flesh, a
nobody. He was despised and re-
jected. The drama of his crucifix-
ion is played against all the pre-
tensions of hispuwer.
