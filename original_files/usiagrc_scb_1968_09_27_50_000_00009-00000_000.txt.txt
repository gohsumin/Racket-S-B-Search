IN A CRISIS, it takes courage to
be a leader . . . courage to speak out
. . . to point the Way to say,
"Follow life!" In it crisis, it takes
action to survive . . . the kind of de-
cisive action that comes from a man
of sound itull‘nct, as well as intelli-
_gence.

If America is to survive this crisis
,. . . if the youth of America are to
‘inherit a sane and even promising
;world, we must have courageous:
'constructive leadzrihip. The kind of
leadership that only George C.
Wallace—of all Presidential can-
didates—has to offer._That’s why

THEY KNOW that it takes cour-
age to stand up for America against
the pseudo - intellectual professors;
the hippies, the press and the entire
liberal Establishment. And they’ve
got that courage.

Thousands and thousands of
tomorrow's Ieaders~the thinking
young men and women of America
who have courage and who are
willing to act—are joining
YOUTH FOR WALLACE. Y rm
should join, too.

CHEM DEP’T. PLANS RESEARCH

By CAROL BRADFORD

The Chemistry Department Is
involved in basic research with
potential practical applications
as well as curriculum improve-
ment. Professors Swensan, Dan-
torlh, Erickson, and Oelke are
continuing their works The two
new members of the depart-
ment. Professors Macalady and
Wubbeis, are expecting to begin
projects.

J a c k Swanson, chairman
at the department, Is studying
New Lossen Rearrangement
Precursors. His is a new ups
pmach using a long understood
reaction. The research is highly
theoretical now, HS he is at-
tempting to iind precursors
which are more stable and less
reactive than the chemicals
currently used. Eventually the
research may have important
practical applications as a
means of preparing industrially
usetnl lsocyanates lo be used in
making urethane {Dam polym-
ers.

Luther Erickson is on
leave to oonlmue his research
on Platinum (i1) Complexes

lates indirectly to cancer chem-

otherapyt The work of Erickson
and Neville (now at Purdue in-
dlanapolis Regional Campus) is
part of the National Institutes at
Health supported cancer pro—
gram. The research is not ban
to but could lead to important
discoveries in the understanding
and treatment of cancer.

Joseph Dantorth is con-
tinuing studies on the decompo-
sition of inorganic salts at rot
Iatively low temperatures Thin
research was conducted over
the summers During the year
Daniorth will continue his or:-
ginal and fundamental research,
He has invented a piece or
equipment which makes this re-
search possible, opening up an
entirely new area of study. Dan-
rnrth also worked on the devel-
opment of the new curriculum
for the Science Ii course which
he is new teaching

William Oelke was en-
gaged in two projects during the

course aiiered by the Depart-
merit. oelke is also editor and_
