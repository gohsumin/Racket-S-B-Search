Militant Columnist

I had a disquieting talk with one of my columv
nlsts the other day Paul Roberts came shuffling in
(he hardly ever does anything but shuffle), sat in my
chair and put his feet on my desk. ”You got your feet
on my desk,” I opened, trying to get on the offensive
before he did.

“Why are you still in school” I knew then it was
going to be one of those talks.

“The same reason you are."

“No. I’m quitting.” He kicked his loafers off. One
landed in a pile of photographs bending the top one be-
yond repair.

“Listen, Roberts, don’t hand me that. You’ve
been saying now for three years you’re going to quit
and you keep saying it in your column but I know bet-
ter." I had the offensive.

“No, this time I mean it. Why stay here? I don't
like to study, I like to sit under trees, I don’t like pre-
tending that I understand Sartre. I’ll never understand
Sartre.”

“But what will you do if you quit school? What
can you do for a living?” That stopped him pretty
good and he slowly tore the damaged print to shreds
as he tried to think of an answer.

“l’ll enlist,” he finally stated, tossing the pieces
of picture into the air, obviously relieved that he had
found an answer. “I‘ll fulfill my obligation to my
society. Why should other people have to risk their
lives while I sit here in Iowa and am pampered? That’s
what I’ll do. I’ll join the army and serve society.”

Poor Roberts. I knew this time he had gone too
far. I discarded yesterday’s Christian Science Monitor
that I had been skimming and turned on him, ready
for a really big fight. I found him standing in the cor-
ner doing the manual of arms with my extra-long lay-
out ruler. “Roberts, cut that out and sit down for God’s
sake.” I was afraid for him. “You don't want to join
the army and become an animal and kill and maim."

”What do I want to do, stay here and become a
leader and order others to do my killing?”

“What?"

“Should I become a big-wig in the State Depart-
ment and send other lesser slobs out to kill the lesser
slobs from other countries? No, as long as the killing
is going to be done I want: to do it.”

“But you don’t want any killing to go on at all.
do you? No. of course you don’t. Why don’t you try to
stop it. Try to end war.”

“End war! You muddle-headed, poison-pen mm-
on. People have been trying to do that since the start of
time and have failed. It's here to stay. We need it. And
as long as we’re a member of this damned society
we’re contributing to the killing.

“It's really a gas but: that’s how it is and I’m not
going to sit here and let someone else do my dirty
work.”

He stomped out of my office~with my ruler over
his shoulder—and I haven’t seen him since.

Cold Spring Day

To the Editor:

As i sit, on this cold "Spring Day" after-
noon, working lllrough the piles oi paper ac-
cumulaled over half a semester, it occurred
lo me lliat some of my faculty colleagues might
be diinking ol exerting pressure lo restore lhe
earlier tradition oi having Spilng Day on the
first really warm afternoon in late April, Let
me be the first in raise uiy voice in cpposiiion
in such an archaic plan.

‘ Were we to reiurn to that tradition, my Wife
would be gently encouraging me to paint the
badly weathered porch wall, my children
would he notasugenily encouraging me to go
on on during and picnic, my athletically luv
clined faculty colleagues would be after me for
tennis or golf and I would be sorely iempted to
spend the day in my garden. The present en-
lightened policy recognizes Spring Day {or
what it is, a (lay for faculty members to catch
up (in work alld ior students lo recover from a
night of i'evelry.

I have Just one question? Since weather is
not a significanr variable, why Can't Sprlng
Day appear on the college calendar [0 elimi»
nate the conlusion alld uncertainty which con-
tribute liorhing to its effectiveness?

To the Editor:

haying been an employee of Gl'innell Col-
legs: for some time, with eleven years spent
working in the North Campus halls, i ieel
that the problems of student drinking, along
wiui rowdylsm and ihe lack of hall discipline
are Ones that have been With us for quite
some time.

To me, the present student body has av-
eraged mit much better than some in the
years gone by.

There have always been North Campus
problems ihai come up from year to year, but
somehow as lime goes by, they rend [u be-
come minimized with something else coming
up to take the spotlight.

In any group of nearly 600 men students,
[here \Vlll always be a few lionﬂinformists
who will insist on rocking the boat. 50 l feel
that ii there is any particular problem at the
present, ihoi It will be iaken care of in due
time.

There are former students who will at-
test to lhe fact that we used to have some Wild
times during the period that they were North
Campus residents.

There were times when I looked over the
mess in the halls alter a pony held the night
belone lllal l doubted whether ihese boys
would ever grow up. But they grew older and
wiser. and now many of these men hold posts
of trust and lesponsibility.

So give Ihe students their due: the greater
majority ol them are pi'elly good Joes most
of the time,

AN ODE TO AN UNKNOWN CO-ED

To the petite, pretty co-ed
Wiui Raven black hair:
Whither ail ihou going

in ihis brisk morning air?

Going bird watching she says;
Thinks 1: it's too dark

To see the redbreasted Robin
Ol‘ the gay Meadow Lark:

She (ripped on her way,
Her head held on high,

A glance o’er her shoulder
in see who’s near by;

So my dear preny maiden
Beware where you walk;
Be Sure ihni your actions
Don't cause any talk;

To those who read this,
You needn‘t be shocked;
The clock is on six,

And ihe Loggia's unlocked;

Ah, now it's all clear,
That the sweetest bird calls

Friday. May 5. WM

Come down from the trees
Up by the Men’s Halls;

Take care. than young lady;
And lhis you should know:
It‘s much, much too early
To go Visit your Beau;

For Mother Nature in Grinnell
is the same as New York,
The bird that you discover
Might be the Stork.

if you should print this
As space tiller let's say,
Please keep it anonymouSA
Might be better that way.

'Nous' Return

To the Editor:

i was delighled to see that you earned an
editorial note on Nous. It should never have
been iniemipied, and i am glad to see such
Vigorous leadership in reviving iii

However, word has got round that it was
Esoteric, and with a Small circulation. lt’s
press run was only a low hundred. that's
[not But you should also stress that its wni<
ers were not limited to majors in philosophy
and religion. For example, i have before me
issues No. 15 and No. 16, March and June of
1963, when Arnold Toynbee was here. There
were appropriate articles on the philosophy of
history by history majors.

Recently the editorial board of History and
Theory saw the issues. This is the inter-
national journal in the field, with the highest
professional standards. The report from the
executive editor. Richard T. Vani‘i is:

“Thank you for lelling us look at these two
interesting issues of Nous. The articles by
:he undergraduates were also of very high
standard, and you are to be congratulated on
having such a ihriving publication." (Letter of
April 29, 1365)

It did not die, as Was said, a “quiet death."
A lew of us fought for what we thought ex-
cellent, but found little support from those
who Could have helped. From those who could
have helped most, there was less man no sup.
