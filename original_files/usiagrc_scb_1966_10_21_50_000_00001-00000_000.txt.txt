Higher Wages? Senate Offers Support

Walkout Planned;

Strike Tomorrow?

By ALAN AXELROD

At the end of a two-hour
Wednesday night session, the
Senate approved a resolution to
let SAGA workers know that
the Senate is sympathetic to
their requests for higher Wages.

The resolution came in re-
sponse to a report submitted by
Craig Allin, Chairman of the
Senate Food Service and Wage
Scale Committee, in which he
told oi plans by workers at the
Quadrangle dining hall to go on
strike starting Saturday at 12
noon.

Allin had been planning to
submit proposals to Dean Rich-
ard Winters and Donald Lam-
bie, vice-president ot the col-
lege, when he was scooped by
a letter that Lamhie sent to all

THESE CAPTURED North Vietnamese women were in South Viet Nam to help the Viet
Cong win people over to their side. These young women and others like them are re.
terred to as "entertainers" in Viet Nam. They are pictured here ina ooyernrnentprison

5&3 editor Bob Hodierne, who quit rchool last year to become a war correspondent.

SAGA workers announcing that
wages would be increased from
as to 95 cents per hour. Allin,
however, felt that this oifer was
merely "tokenism," and ap-
proached Lamhie with a gradu<

BU LLETI N

College Vice President
Donald Lambie yesterday
announced a further increase
in Saga wages.

According to the new pay
schedule, retroactive to 0c-
(ﬁber 15, Saga workers will
be paid at these graduated
rules:

Students in lst year or
work for Saga: $1.01) per hour

Students in 2nd year: $1.05
per hour

Students in 3rd or 4th year:
31.10 per hour

Lamhie emphasized that
the rates were temporary.
He said there is a probabil-
ity ot a board charge in-
crease for the 2nd semester
to cover the added cost.

ated wage plan in which SAGA
workers would initially receive
$1 per hour, with five-cent
raises coming at the end of the
firSt. third, ﬁlth, and seventh
semesters of service to SAGA.

Allin was told that such a
plan would necessitate raising
the annual board tee, and that
it would have to be ap-
proved by the trustees. Allin
reported to the Senate that the
plan would constitute an addi-
tional expense of $8.25 per stu-
dent per year.

in response to Senator David
Swee's remarks about the strike
negatively allecting ute col-
lege's attitude toward the pro
posed increases, Aws Board
President K a r e n Lauterbach
said she felt sure that the strike
would be looked upon as a re
sponsible protest against the
present SAGA wage scale.

The resolution states that the
Senate, feeling that SAGA
wages are unrealistic, approve!
of Such measures as are neces-
sary to alleviate the present
situation.

Prior to passing the SAGA
resolution, the Senate approved
resolutions concerning the re-
sponsibility of SGA in reime
bursing halls for stolen or dam-
aged property and the practice
or reserving study desks in the
library by keeping books there
ovemight.

Steve Kent lead a statement
by the Executive Cabinet that
came in answer to a request by
East Norris Hall that the Sen-
ate appropriate $50 from Gen-
eral Budget and Reserve to
partially pay for the replace-
ment or an amplifier and speak-
ers, part of a hall~owned stereo
system, that were stolen over
inaugural weekend last year.

The Executive Cabinet cun-

' tended that SGA cannot assume

responsibility tor reimbursing
individuals or groups for loss of
or damage to privately owned
property. The statement went
on to say that all residence
halls Should be made aware or
the necessity oi insuring such-
hallrowned appliances as ste-
reos. televisions, and refrigera-
(01's.

in regard to the library situ-
ation, the Senate passed a reso-
lution introduced by Senator
Chuck Wall. The resolution ex-
presses to the library the tie
sire oi the Senate “to have all
books removed from all desks
at the end or each day and
placed along the empty shelves
located either in the book cases
or along the walls, This is to
allow every student and not just
a tow to have access to library
desks.”
