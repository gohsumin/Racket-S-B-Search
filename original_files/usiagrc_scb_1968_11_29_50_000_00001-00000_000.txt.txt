Grinrlell House, Presidents' Home

(mi-w of two an‘l’cles)
By STEPHEN GROW

Gt'iitnell House, until 1961 the
President's Home, stands state-
ly and gracious on the corner
0! Park Street and Filth Ave-
nue. The house has been inti-
mately connected with Grinnell
tradition Since it was built in
1917, a tradition which some-
how pervades its atmosphere.
it is commonly the scene of
prestigious events —- the recent
Phi Beta Kappa ceremony. an
nccaslonzil concert or recital,
ur the meeting or the Board or
Trustees, This splendid struc-
ture has an interesting past.

The President’s House stands
on property which the College
has owned since 1887. Before it
was built in 1917, at a Cost of

at

titty-six thousand dollars, an-
other house, the Little House,
occupied the property and
sewed as the home or Presi-
dents Gates, Main. and Brad-
ley. The Little House was built
by an early resident oi Grin-
nell, a businessman and mayor,
aiter whom it was named.
Around 1916 the building was
in such bad repair that Presi»
dent Main and his iamily
moved out of the house. The
building was razed and the
present Griiinell house built in
1917.

in a letter to the “Brethren
and Sisters or the Fellowship
or Grinnell and Friends or Pres
ideiit Main" the Grinnell col-
lege Foundation stated the rea<

Chambers Visils

Campus; Reports
On Black Power

Ernest Chambers, a black
power speaker ironi Omaha,
Nebraska, visited the campus
last Friday and Saturday to
address both integrated and
black audiences, attend classes,
and counsel individual students
on the meaning 0! black power.
His working definition of the
term, as he explained to a press
conference, is “A well-loaded
gun in the hands or a man who
knows who the enemy is."

The real enemy. Chambers
stressed ilt campus appear-
ances, is the American system,
whose laws, morality, and struc»
ture he heels are all geared to-
ward whites.

During his Italy, Chambers
lived in a mom in East Norris
Hall. His Visit, sponsored by
CBS, the Initiative fund, and
other sources. brought him into
contact with many individual
students and small groups or
students in the Forum, in his
dormitory room, and on the
campus. “1 prefer talking
to black students," he added,
saying there was a need to unity
black college students behind
the ideas of black power, He ad-
dressed several integrated au-
diences, however, and explained
his interpretation of black hiss
wry—as distinct from American
historyeand what he saw as the
need for violent social relorm.

His 8:00 lecture in Roberts
Theatre on “Alternatives loi-
Black and white People” war
delivered to an audience or 600.
Chambers' indictment oi the
Christian religion as inheiently
white and racist was strongly
worded The ”alternative"
Chambers saw was one oi racial
pride by blacks, preceded by a
violent rejection of American
white culture and history.

SGA Leaders See
Leggett Proposal
As Mixed Blessing

Reaction to President Leg-
gett’s proposal tor open dorms
34 hours per week has met with
split opinion trnm student Gov-
ernment. Varying opinions as to
whether the policy should be
accepted and as to how much
the new policy should be en-
iorced occur both among the
SGA leaders and the various
house presidents.

SGA leaders Tom Thomas.
Lee Maril, and Heather Foote
appear split in their opinions
as to what, it anything, should
he done to achieve a more lib-
eral position than Leggett's.
Tom Thomas felt that the pro-
posal contained a “potential tor
coming up with u very work-
able situation,” and at it was
acceptable to a majority or the
students, considering the close—
ness ot the vote in the recent
SGA reterenduni on opens. He
ielt that the major emphasis 01
Student Government Should be
towards the implementation or
the new rule. Thomas said that
“within his (Leggett’s) broad
guidelines, there is an awful
lot that can go either way,"
concerning particulars such as
entorcement and a Student Bill
of Rights and Responsibilities.
Tom Thomas emphasized, how-
ever, that SGA is “up in the
air as far as an ofﬁcial posi-
tion.” and that his position will
vary with student opinion and
the willingness or others to
compromise.

C of HP President Lee Maril
would not comment on his po-
sition, saying that it is his “pol-
icy iiot to have interviews with
the 58:3,” He said that he had
been misquoted by the sun
just atter he became C ot HP
President, and that now, “all
communications (with the Scar-
let and Black) must be writ-
ten." It was learned, however,
that Marti was against accept-
