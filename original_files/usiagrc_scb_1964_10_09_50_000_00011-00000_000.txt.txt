Soccer Team Tests
Perfect Record

The only unbeaten Pioneer
sports team, Coach Irv Si-
mone's soccer 11, will be point-
ing for win number four when
it faces always tough MacMur-
ray at Jackson, 111., on Satur-
day. l

The match will be the third
straight on the re ad for the
Pioneers. They whipped Law-
rence 4-1 and Ripon 7~l on a
Wisconsin invasion last week-
end to up their mark 3-0.

MacMurray, which fields no
football team and has soccer as
its major fall sport, represents
by iar the toughest test yet for
Grinnell and could be the turn-
ing point of the season for his
Pioneers, according to Simone.

“A victory over MacMurray‘
could give us the boost we will,

need if we hope to upset Wheat-
on and Lake Forest, two mid-
west powers, in later games,”
he stated,

“We are improving, but still
have an awful long way to go,”
Simone added.

Improved scoring balance
was one of the highlights of the
Wisconsin trip. Five Pioneers—
Vince Anku, Frank Chilingulo,
John Emery, Felix Lungu, and
Fred Miller—shared ll goals at
Lawrence and Riponl

a game of skill. Some of the

abilities {or at least a week or
two. They play such fast games
that occasionally as many as
two innings are completed be
