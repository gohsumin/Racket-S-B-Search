Student Leaders Write Johnson;
Voice Doubts About War Ettorts

S.GrA. President, Steve Kent,
was one of 100 college and uni-
versity s t u d e n t leaders last
month who signed u letter ex-
pressing concern to President
Johnson about the war in Viet-
nam. The letter, which devel-
oped trout discussions at last

summer’s meeting or the Na-
tional Student Association, ques-
tioned certain U.S, policies and
appealed for freer discussion
and clearer governmental ex-
planatiun.

The leaders called for an ex-
tension of the holiday truce in
Vietnam. They expmsed in-
creasing disturbance about the
discrepancy between their per-
sonal convictions and their mil<
itary obligations, ‘as well as
About the war itself. They criti-
clzed the draft law, citing the
“a l m ost universal conviction
that the present Selective Serv-

The letter questioned the need
of a “growing commitment" to
protect America's “vital inter-

or the military to create a
“stable and prosperous Viet-
nam." The student leaders
voiced doubts about U.S. willinga

negotiations.

The students were concerned
about whether the U.S. would

Senate Hears Dean on Drugs. Draft

Wednesday night Dean
Thompson spoke to the Senate
on drugs and the dish. Thompa
son had recently attended two
canierences on the problems.
The draft conlerenoe. held at An-
tioch, was an “uncomfortable"
experience. he said, because of
the reluctance oi the partici-
pants to discuss the Selective
Service Act itseli rather than
other is S u e 5 like Vietnam.
Whether student protests re-
garding the dratt would have
any eilect on the law, he said,
is questionable, The not expire:
this June, but he doubted any
"revolutionary" new law will
be adopted,

0n drugs, he said, any com—
ment is dllllcult because the
subject is loaded with common
misconceptions and prejudiced
terms. The effects ot drugs, he
said, were Variable and little
known. Doctors know there are
risks in taking drugs, but what
the risks are tor dinerent people
is still unclear. He said it was
more uselul to talk of drug
abuse and habituation rather
than addiction, and disagreed
with the sensational articles on
drugs in Lite. The drug cona
ierence he termed “the most
useful" and said the policy
statement on drugs issued last
spring by the administration

would be slightly modiﬁed He
did not elaborate.

In Senate action. Rick Mara
dowell gave an iniormal report
an Interim. “Interim,” he said,
“showed that Grinnell students
have the maturity and the re-
sponsibility to carry on some-
thing successfully by them<
selves." He was disappointed, he
said, at the faculty's response,

In an Executive Cabinet re
port, Steve Kent said applica.
tions for the election commission
are open until Friday midnight.
The Senate also confirmed the
appointments or Bill Fligeltaub
and Russ Allen to the Men‘l

DEAR REB:

I'm or wellsknown composer, and I need a new car.
The trouble is, I'm iust too Bizet to pick one out. And
what‘s more, many of the new cars I see are OFlen<
buch in the garage for repairs. But i do have cr good
friend who is pleased with his new '67 Dodge Dart.
He was given an excellent deal and Berlioz any
money on it. My Each is to the well. Can you help me?

DEAR lUDWlG:

lUDWlG

My advice is that you let yourself Ravel in the enioy-
ment of driving the sporty, all-new Dart for '67.
You'll ﬁnd its Liszt price is a lot lower than you'd

expect. And even though it's
bigger inside this year, Dart's
Handel.

Here's the swinging, mun-sized compact for '67 that's got three B's of
its ownt Bold, Brassy and Beautiful. Dart has been completely restyled
this year, inside and out. It's longer, roomier, more powerful. But still at
that snug compact price. Drop in at your nearest Dodge Dealer's and

try it out for yourself.,
