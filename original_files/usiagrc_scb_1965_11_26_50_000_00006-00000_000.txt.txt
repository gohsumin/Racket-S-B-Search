Play Achieves Dramatic Effect
By Incongruities Between Acts

By MARY MALCOLM

The physlcists, presented last
weekend by the Grinnell Players,
began with a deceptively simple
ﬁrst act taking, in typical Dur-
renmatt form, it grotesquely
shocking twist thereafter,

The performance DI the start-
ling second act took me by wind
as an impressive and highly dra-
matlc departure from the kind of
ﬂoundering hallrsuccess achieved
in the ﬁrst.

The script itsell provides an
ambiguous, ironical farce in the
ﬁrst act as the foundation of an
entirely ditlerent kind at drama
in the second. The Physicists, as
it ﬁnds expression in the second
act, is a powerful, almost over-
stated comment on the useless sil~

The dichotomy and total ab»
sauce of continuity between hrs:
and second act is intentional and
effective. It demonstrates the au-
thor’s almost too simple concern
with the normal appearance or a
very sick world. We cannot ask
the director to instill something
in a play purposely omitted by
the playwright, so Denms Rich
deserves rather more credit than
criticism tor the abrupt change
in the tone of the acting between
these two acts. Nevertheless, it is
difficult {or ﬁre audience to make
this quick switch as confidently
as the cast does.

playwright, director and actors

ence's newes are at a breaking

is lel‘rific, it is small compared
with chat on the actors. The four
characters in the final portion at
the last act—played by Richard
Roehlk (MDbius), Bonnie Tinker
(Doctor Van Zhand), Theo Le-

and James Arieti (Ernestl or

ness in the final performance.
The {act that I am inclined to
lump them into one unit indicates
that they functioned so. As a
member of the audience tiist and
a critic second, I found it un-
natural to take them separately
and dissect gestures and speech,
The more versatile and well-do
ﬁned characters, by the gilt of
script and superb acting, were
those portrayed by Miss Tinker
and Raehlk. Both demonstrated a
dramatic range and maturity
promising for the Grinnell Play—
ers, since they are freshmen.

Stepping hack into the very
different kind of job done in act
one, i realize that I reacted more
as critic tlhan audience, and justly
so. There was some poor acting
done, coupled with opening night’s
nervous slips and sturterings.
Even the outstanding Tour or the
ﬁnal act floulldered somewhat
here.

As tor the others, one tended
rather to wtnce whenever they

opened their mouths, because of
the unhappy combination of ear-
nest over-acting and clumsy in-
congrutty.
