Gar-rod woke exceedingly early
the next morning, and his heart
was thumping and growling
with such velocity that he could
barely lace up his doublet. He
raced down the winding mala-
chite staircase, and seized upon
Maximilian, who was staidly wa-
tering the potted dalmatian.

“Hey," said the Prince, “is she
up yet? Roxana?"

Maximilian replied that the
Princess had not as yet descend-
ed from the fateful chamber,
and upon accruing this informa—
tion Garrod began fitfully pacing
the palace floor, muttering to
himself and chewing the upper
edge of his undershirt. In this
manner he was soon joined by
his father the King, who paced
and muttered similarly three or
four inches to his rear.

AFTER WHAT seemed an in-
terminable long time, Garrod at
last sighted the hem of his be~
loved's sequined dressing gown,
at the very top of the staircase.
Breathless with consternation, he
stopped dead in his tracks,
whereupon his royal father
crashed into his back and sent
him reeling against the dalma-
tian, causing a nasty hip bruise
and inciting the wrath of the
innocent plant. By the time are
der was restored, Roxena of Tar
valonia stood at the very foot
of the staircase, her raven
tresses glinting in the morning
light. Jeez. thought the Prince.

”l-Iaehow did you sleep, baby?”
asked Garrod, attempting the
while to hide his agitation by
placing his left hand over his
face. The Princess yawned lan-
guidly,

illall at the throng of royalty,
{nobility and servility assembled
,there for her pleasure, she blew
,her nose into a large checkered}
handkerchief produced from her
lcoat pocket, and then addressed’
the company at large.

“So which one is the Prince?"

Immediately after the proper
introductions the great least be-l
gen. and Garrod and Marina,
seated side by side, chattered
gaily and ate and drank with
gusto throughout. Toward the
end of the sumptuous repast, the
young Prince leaned over to the
,v’Princess and whispered to her
lin a sincere toner

"HEY, WHERE’D you get thati
pith helmet?” l i

“Picked it up down the thtol‘e,',
thilly!” she shrieked, poundingl
her knee in delight with one
hand and with the other Squeez-
ling a small syringe, which caus-
'ed a clear stream of seltzer wa-
iter to erupt from the aforemen-
tioned flower in her lapel and
strike the unsuspecting GarrodI
slightly to the left of his nose.
lThat settled it. ’He liked this
'chick.

Upstairs, the faithful Maximil-
ian placed the boiled pea be.
neath the very bottom of the-
eight mattresses. And beneath,
the very top mattress he placed
ten pineapples, a starred marmo—
lset, seven pairs of andirons,
three chamberpots and a hookah,

Righ+s denial

JForce: Braden

By Dim Friedlander
5&8 Staff Writer

Carl Braden, characterized as
a professional revolution-
ary, spoke Tuesday on “The
American Revolution: The Rise
of the Negro in the South.” J

Braden told of the efforﬁ of.
Negro and white integrationist
leaders in the South to Chal-l
lenge a way of life which has.
changed little since the Civill
War. ,
By the denial of the Bill of 1
Rights, particularly the first
amendment, thesauthernnon-
Violent revolution now occur-
ring may be compelled to turn t
toward violence, Braden said. i

The House Un-American AC-l
tivities Committee (HUAC) and
its children, the State UAC’S,
were cited as the main obstacles
to this peaceful revolution.
These committees, Braden said,
in an attempt to divrde the rac-
es, have accused white integrae
tionists of being traitors or Sub-
versives and thus, by their loge
ic, Communists In Mississippi
every integrationist was accus—
ed of being a Communist, he
said.

ln an attempt to negate the
Constitution, Alabama has tried
to pass an injunction barring all
integrationist activities. The logs
ic is that since demonstrations
often are met with white mob
violence they threaten the
“peace and tranquility" of Ala-.
bama, When riots ,erupt the
demonstrators are invariably are
rested instead of the instigators
of the violence.

AN EXAMPLE of violence oc—

curred recently when a state
representative shot and killed a
Negro truck driver who had
participated in a voter registra-l
tion campaign. Not only was
there no prosecution but a
witness was later slugged by a
state trooper and then accused
of assault and fined $25.
It is impossible to attain jus-
tice in the South since the
courts, as well as the mass
media, are controlled by the
owners of the land and indus-
try, They have a vested inter
est in segregation.

BEADEN EXPLAINED that
he believes that 90 per cent of
Southern Negroes are lor in-
tegration and 40 per cent are
militant. About a third of the
Southern whites are fed up
with segregation, only 10 to 15
per cent supporting this policy.

Braden thinks the Kennedy
Administration has been slow
in civil rights action but has
reacted more quickly since
Oxford. But he Stressed the
Administratinn will not move
any faster than the people
demand.

Braden proposed several im-
mediate measures to help inte-
gration in the South. One was
increased federal intervention if
necessary to avoid violence. Ark
other was the abolition of the
HUAC and the Senate Internal
Investigating Sub - Committee,
which, with the Dixiecrats, has

To the Editor:

The Chinese invasion of india
is extremely distressing, not
only to those who have friends
lthere, but to all of us, both for
{humanitarian reasons and be-
'cause lndia is the largest demr
ocracy in the world.

It is difficutt to understand
what motivates the Chinese in
this instance, and equally dime
cult to know what we as indi-
viduals can do to help

It has recently come to my i
attention that the Embassy of t

India has set up branches of
the NATIONAL DEFENSE
FUND and of the BORDER i
OPERATIONS RELIEF FUND
in the us. for the collection
of voluntary contributions
from India citizens resident .
here and from Americans who
are sympathetic to their cause.
I wish to call these funds to‘
the attention of the Grinnell
community for whatever action
persons may wish to take.

ing apprehension the overriding
liberalization of the women’s
living rules as proposed by the
‘Dormitory Committee of the
AWS. To believe that the wom-
en students on this campus, none
of whom are over 23, should
have the right to put rugs or
carpets in their rooms and to
hang one utility shelf possessing
the horrendous proportions of 3
feet by eight inches seriously
underlines the decaying moral
ﬁber of this campus.

We are highly suspicions of
the sudden necessity for these
shelves and rugs Obviously,
this is the action of in small,
but vociferous, minority who
believe in free-shelving and
free—rugg'ing. What could these
shelves possibly be used for
if not for books? What type of
lightweight objects does this
vocal minority have in mind?
We fear that this new lihera -
ity in shelves and rugs will
have a stupendous effect on
South campus’ after-hours ac-
tivities
We are diametrically opposed
to these uncalled for changes.
After all, if this continues, how
long will it be until shag rugs
are permitted in the women's
living quarters?

We would never allow
