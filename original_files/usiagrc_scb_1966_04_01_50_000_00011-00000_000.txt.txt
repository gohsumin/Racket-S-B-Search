} Withdrawal

(Continued from Page 1)

cluding drinking in tile Fore
um, property destruction and
attempted illegal entry into
the Quad.

The Main girl was not on
probation and, according to
her, her only offense while at
Grinnell was a charge of ties»
truction of property during
Spring Riot last year.

The girl said “i was as
tounded. My reaction was
there was nothing I could do
about it.” She went on to say
that she didn’t think it was
fair in light of her record that
she should be asked to with-
draw.

The Clevelalld girl was also
surprised at the action saying
“I had no idea whatsoever
that this was cooling.”

The deans, however, say
the girls had been told in ad»
vance that they were in jeop-
ardy of being dismissed from
school.

Therefore, the record of
the two girls and this final
incident were the reasons for

their forced withdrawal.

The deans’ office also
stressed that they alid the
Faculty Committee on Stu»
dent Affairs had talked the
case over with a number of
students before coming to

- their decision,

Both girls indicated that
they are considering reapply-
ing to Grinnell for the second
semester next year. The indi—
cation from the deans’ office
was that anyone has a right
to reapply for admission after
they had been dismissed.

stated, “there is a greater urban
population at Grinnell, more stu»
dents from large metropolitan
areas tllan all the farm or out of

the iacroty.

“There also seems to be a change
of emphasis; when I came here,
Grinnell was known as a Chris-
tian liberal arts college, closely
aiiiliated with the congregational
church This has obviously change

I encountered upon coming here."

In answer to the question of
whether he was still being chal»
lenged at Grinnell, xuiitz replied
that he was challenged more and
more from every angle. He cited
the philosophy club as “one or the
best in the country, second
none.” He also spoke oi the lore

Kuntz's activities at
College have been extremely di-

experience, he has helghtened the"

contributions to the 5&8 (over
