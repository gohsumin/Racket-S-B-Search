I’E Complex To Blame For Deficit

in general institutional and
public relations costs. Plant
maintenance costs were about
the median, and our library
expenditures were close to
the bottom.

The question everyone is
asking is, of course, what is
going to be cut7W'hile theans-
wer is primarily up to the

_Budget Priority Planning Cor
mmittee which willmskemost
of its decisions in January,
Walker mentioned some ofthe
vulnerable areas to the faculty
at Monday afternoon's budget
briefing. Primary areas men-
tioned by Walker include aca~
demic equipment (except in the
sciences, which is covered by
a grant), staffmembers,stud-
ent services, financial aidand
concert series. Already cut
this year were faculty mem»
bers, student services,mm~
pus programs (theater prog-
rams, PPPE. art acquisitions
and international studies) and
placement and financial aid.
Other primary areas ofatmck
must include thephysicaledu-
cation budget and general ad-
ministrative and maintenance
expenses.

Ultimately the blame for the
entire austerityprogram must
return to the Plant Fund Der
ficit. The following table will
show from where the deficit

total deficit is $1.5 million.
Therefore, if the physical ed-
ucation complex had not been
built, the total debt would be
$400,000. Nevertheless, Wal-'
ker asserts that the trustees
believe the complex is a wise
investment (due to the federal
grant and loan) and that they

would probably make the same
decision to build today.

The final question that re-
mains is whether the col-
lege's existence is threatened
by the current financial cri~
sis. That problem mu be ap—
proached from two angles.
First of all, from the "no"
side:

The college's endowment is
currently $13.5 million (plus
the value of the dormitories,
which are no longer being in-
cluded). This is smaller than
that of Oberlin, Swarthmore,
Carleton, Macalester andilé-
wrence but probably equal to
or considerably larger than

The ‘Plant Fund Deficit can
probably be repaid within five
years if anywhere nearly the
current effort is made and
capital improvements are kept
at a minimum.

However, at a symposium for
educators at Williams Col»
lege, one of the main speakers
cited three factors which will
decide which small schools
will eventually survive. They
are: 1) high academic qual—
ity; Z) a national reputation;
and 3) a $25 million endowe
ment. The last figure would
make Grinnell half the size L
it should be to survive. 1

major types of Tennyson's
poems “ lyric, verse narrar
tive, and dramatic. _

According to the publisher’s
description, Kissane's meth-
od "provides a useful frame
work for surveying the entire
range of Tennyson's work."
in this effort, the book “at
tains both breadth andbalance
in examining Tennyson's ex-
tensive and many-sided adi-
ievement" and provides “a
lucid tracing of Tennyson’s
literary reputation and an as
sessment of his merits and
deficiencies."

Cerauthor (with S. P. Zimer
and M. M. Liberman) of A
Preface to Literary Analysis
and The Practice of Criti-
cism (beth published by Scott
Foresman), Kissane is the
author of scholarly articles
on a variety of 19th-century
subjects, including Victorian
mythology, Jane Austen, Wil-
liam Wordsworth, Herman
Melville, and Sherlock Hol-
mes.
