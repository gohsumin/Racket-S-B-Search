Off-Campus students seek sacs option; Vote probable

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

l Off-campus seniors may be
able to forego their board fees
this year, thus giving up their
"privilege" to eat SAGA food
in the dining halls, If an all-
Itudent referendum proposed
Tuesday by the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) indi-
cates support for the measure.
The referendum will determine
it the majority of the student
body is willing to pay a alight
increase in board fees that
would enable their offrcampus
peers to say goodbye to SAGA
and fend for themselvesi

The recent action by the SAC
is only the latest in a series of
measures taken to explore the
possibilities of giving students
options to the present policy of
mandatory board fees. At the
present time, all students must
pay for board except married
students and those originally
mm the city of Grinnell.

Last spring, alter complaints
by future off-campus seniors
and in light of the response to
the SAGA committee’s ques-
tionnaire (where students indi-
cated a desire to be able to
forego the blanket board fee),
the SAC issued a list of sug-
gestions to the administration,
asking them to find speciric in-
formation about various pos-
sible options. About a month
later, on May la, the commit~
tee issued a recommendation
to President Leggett for a tem-
porary plan tor the tall semes—
ter: they asked that “students
not in college housing be given
the option of not paying the

board fee, and thus not eating
in the campus dining hall."
this proposal was for the loss—
70 school year only, until a
more satisfactory plan could be
worked out, The committee
malized that there “may be
some problems in the imple-
mentation of the recommenda-
tion. ”

Problems there were. Be-
cause of the late date of the
suggestion and the illness of
one of the key personnel in-
volved, nothing was done about
answering nr approving the
proposal until this 1811. Mean-
while, about seven offrcampus
seniors decided to refuse to pay
their board fees at registration,
hoping to put pressure on the
administration to do something

immediately about the recom-
mendation. After being sent to
talk to six diltereht adminisr
traticn oliicials, the students
were given an ultimatum to

pay their board fees by Mona ,

day, Sept 8th, or they would
not be considered students at
the college. (All have paid;
students they still are.) They
were also told that the deans
were currently considering the
recommendation.

Considering it they were. On
September 5, following otiicial
procedure, President Leggett
sent Professor Edgar Mullins,
chairman of the SAC, a re-
sponse to the suggestion of last
spring. in it he stated that he
saw problems in the implemen-
tation of the request, and that

he had asked the deans to take
certain measures to “begin the
necessary analyses that would
provide us with descriptions of
Viable options for long- range
food service arrangements for
all students. ”

Leggett cited the possibility
of a rise in board charges next
semester and thereafter for
those excused to make up for
those exempted from paying
board (the fewer students pay-
ing, the higher the individual
board cost will be), and the
possible need of a checking
system In the dining halls, He
felt that because of these pos-
sibilities, every student should
be informed and be able to
have a say in the issua.

One of Leggett's requests to
the deans was to find out exacts
ly how many seniors presently
living off-campus would take
advantage of the option now
under consideration, so that the
business office and the SAGA
business manager could figur¢
out the difference this would
maké'in the SAGA proiit and
thus compute the possible risé
in board charges next semes~
ter.

in accordance with this, Data
Low held a meeting Mohda
afternoon (Sept. 8) of the Stu:
dents interested in the option,
Nineteen seniors signed theii
names to a statement saying
that, if they had the chance
they would choose to forego that;
board charges. Mrs Low prom
ised that when and if the op.
tion went into effect they
would be refunded their board
lees with the price of the meals
that they had already (presum-
ably) eaten deducted.

With some 20 students (mar.
Iigned the list later)‘ not pay-
ing board, the fees per student
would go up about $5.00 a set
mester, it was reported at the
SAC meeting. The administra-
tion would absorb the cost thil
semester, but since next se~
mester the board fees of those
not excused would be attected,
the committee believed tha|
students should be able to have
a say in whemer the option it
instituted or not. The matter
of checking procedures in the
dining halls might also be u
problem that would affect the
rest of the students, who might
be asked to show an ldenilﬁrv
cation card at all meals.

probably never to regain the
honored status I once had (H-
S). Accordingly 1 am up against
it (the system).

I knew full well what might
happen last May when i had
my dratt card sent in, Well,
then, why was i so stupid to do
it? Alter all Grinnell provides
a warm motherly womb for
fou r years, and after
that . . . But that's in the
Iuture to be worried about when
the time comes.

Of course, prison also pro-
vides a protective womb that
insulates a person irom the rest
or the world. The system takes
good care at its own.

A few people who were here

last May, like Mike Eaton and
Ted Glick, are no longer. In
another semester I Will
probably be gone, too, This is
rather sad, naturally, but most
people are still at Grinnell, pur-
suing they know not what, but
determined to have a good Jag
in the meantime. And that’s
what’s really sad.

Obviously, a person can go
to school and still follow his
conscience as it pertains lo
alleviating world problems.
After all, Gl‘innell provides a
stimulating environment which
nurtures one: potential into full
bloom, and after Grinnell. . .

. But that's in the future to
be worried about when the lime
comes.
