Tie Closes Soccer Season

The soccer types completed
their first season under Coach
Keith Fisher and undernewlyr
established varsity status by
tying Drake University at l- l.
The final game of the 1970
campaign featured many ofthe
aspects that made this a frus'
trating season for Keith and
the team‘rfailure to capital-
ize on breaks and an inability
to score while generally con-
trolling midfield and playing
aggressive defense. This last
game was enjoyable however,
as the team played well des—
pite blowing snow and (BU-def
gree temperatures and a poor
set of directions which got
most of the team to the game
45 minutes late.

The game was barely a min-
ute old when a Drake attacker
«(in a gold stocking mp) broke
through the asyet—unorgan-
ized Grinnell defense to put
one in. it looked like another
long afternoon for the Scarlet
and Black, but Dave Coron
scored the first goal of his
Grinnell career within a cour
pie of minutes of Drake’s,
tying the score for the rest of
the afternoon as it turned out.
The Grinnell defense quickly
got it together and shut out the
Drake attack effectively.

Howard Reid played goal for
the Pioneers, and turned in an
outstanding performance des-
pite adverse conditions and
limited experience. He deserr

ves much» of the credit for the
Grinnell showing in this yme,
as he made many fine saves
against experienced Drake
attackers.

The soccer team closed at
37472, which was not as good
a showing as was hoped for
when the team assembled in
September. The loss of Steve
Hirshorn hurt, as did a gen-
eral letdown which appeared
midway through the season.

In any case, the team lost or
tied its last five games after
a fast start. Keith can look
forward to next season and
the return of his scoringstars
Tom Lincoln and Steve Kore
stad and the hopeful return
of Hirshorn. Saturday's game
was the last for seniors Bruce
Graham, J-C Labowitz, Jim
Dix, Howard Reid, Craig Gorr
don and Dean Swift.

Too little, Too late

Knox Shaves Grinnell

Grinneil’s Pioneers contin-
ued their losing skein at Knox
in the final game of the sea-
son. Both teams,going into the
game, had identical league
records of 4-3 and were tied
for fourth place, but Knox
walked away the better, 28’25.

Grinnell drew firstblood ona
19 yard field goal by Twinkle
toes Roy Lewis, but from then
on, the game was dominated
by Knox, as they struck for
TDs in each of the four quart
ters. Mike Eslick broke for
77 yards and a touchdown in
the first quarter, and Kelly
Cahoon scored from 13 yards
out in the second quarter to
leave Knox on top 14—3 at the
half.

in the third quarter, Bob
Boiler scored on a one yard
drive, and early in the final
frame, John Hubner plunged
over, also from the one. Thus
Knox led 28-3 in the fourth
quarter before Grinnell could
get started.

The Pioneers never fully
gve up, however, despite the
met that theballgame hadbeen
rendered meaningless by their
previous two losses. Grinnell
finally got an offense going
following Hubner’s score, as
they drove 56 yards with Wa-

Pope: Students Must Save "As

To: Students of Grinnell
From: Dick Pipe, IM Director
Re: Article by the C. Kid

First let me say this is not
the article that I had written
after reading the article on
lM’s. My initial impression
was that of dire wrath, but
that has since been dispelled
through conversation with the
anonymous writer. [had read
the article gettingthe impres-
sion that it was a personalat-
tack upon the directors of the
[M program, as I think others
also assumed.

But upon the conversation of
tonight I realized that thearti~
cle was not intended to be so,
but was rather intended to help
us and to get other Students to
help us in the restructuring
program of lM’s, a task wh-
ich has met much difficulty
and won’t get off the ground
unless the students sodemand
it. The 1M program this year
has been far from satisfac—
tory, in fact it has been one
of the bleakest on record,
save for some Sterling per‘
formances in the past couple
of years. This has been the
result of the restructuring of
the old hall system, and the
shift in interests of the stu-
dent body from the archaic
"win for the old hall” spirit.

I’m not saying this isn’t good,
but too many people feel they
must win no matter how they
do it, and this detracts from
the enjoyment that should be
derived. it has also led to
many people not wanting to
participate, as they have no
desire to be stomped on by

Jollie Rollie and the rest of
the gang of Clark, but would
rather go out and have fun
and enjoy themselves. Butthis
again is not the basis of the
problem confronting IM’s.

The crisis can be solved by
adequate and upsto-date lear
dership. Craig and myself
seem to be willing to give it,
but the powers that be balk
from the chore. It is no secs
ret that the system needs ov~
erhauling. We need a system
base on interest groups as
was suggested in the article,
not one based on the hall sys*
tem. There is not enough ins
terest within most halls to
conduct a worthwhile 1M pro
gram:

'ihis idea is not new. Idis~
cussed it this summer with
the powers, but the idea was
cast aside. Perhaps this was
my fault for not emphasizing
its emphasis, perhaps the bi-
ame should lie with thepowers
for wanting to stick with a
crumbling empire. That mat-
tors not. What matters is that
something needs to get done.
it needs to be done rather
soon before the program disr
appears entirely. Our hands
are tied. We must deal with
our superiors, and thatseems
to be out of date.

People complain of no offis
cials for volleyball. With the
monetary situation of the coir
lege, we can’t afford to pay
people to officiate. A member
of North suggested that we
might give PE majors for of-
ficiating so that there will be
an incentive involved. One

power said it isn’t a “carry-

over” sport so we can’t do it.
I'm not saying it deserves a
major; i do think it involves
enough for a minor, but they
will only give, and this has
not been approved, one team
sport towards the team sport
requirement. This was not
enough incentive for anyone

to volunteer.
If you have a complaint or

suggestion, come to Craig or
myself with it. We know what
is happening with theprogram
and can accommodate the sug-
gestion. Otherwise your sug-
gestion or complaint becomes
part of a verbal attack upon
us as to why we're not doing
our job. They aren’t proces-
sed to assess the value of
them. They are used as wea-
pons. Come to us. We can
help and are willing to. We
want to see theprog—ram work.
We want to change it so itwiil
work. But with our hands tied,
we become part of the upper
echelon who directs and
doesn't listen. Think about the
program, not about who is
writing this and why he might
seem bitter.

Perhaps the C. Kid is right.
By remaining anonymouspeo-
ple will think about what he
says, and won't try to ration-
alize it by lmowing who wrote
it. The program is for the
students, and it needs help. it
is up to the students to save it.

shington ”Baby Bull" Alston
, going over from the two. The
pass for the two point conver—
sion failed. Followinga fumr
ble recovery, the Baby Bull
scored from Knox’s 16, then
ran for two points. A poor
punt set up Grinnell’s final
score as the Pioneers took
over on Knox’s 44. Gorgeous
Gary Johnson hit Henry ”the

Flash” Corona with a 16 yard
scoring Strike, and " ack"
Robinson ran for the twopoint
conversion to run the count
to 28—25, Knox. However, th-
ere were just 16 seconds left
in the game, and Knox killed
the clock.

The game was, thus, a case
of too little, too late. Grinnell
proved in the fourth quarter
they could score, yet they did
so too late to mean anything.
The Pioneers just didn't get
aroused over this meaningless
game until the fourth quarter.

An important factor is that
Grinnell had to play without
two starters, Jim Pirolli and
Randy Sarver. Both suffered
ankle injuries againstSt. Olaf.
All in all, however, the season
wasn't a total loss, as the
team stayed at .500 and per
formed as the experts predics
ted they would.

IM Revolution

(yawn) and North is in third,
(Tra-la). But what is this?
West Norris Hall seems to be
trying to create a revolution
in the ranks of the 1M stand—
ings. It has the audacity to tie
North for third position in the
V-Ball league! Excuse me for
getting so carried away, but I
was almost under the impresa
sion that their were only three
winning teams in the league.
Right On West. Smith Hall is
also a winning team witha ll- 7
record, that ties them withthe
Profs. The rest of the “leaf

The upset ofthe weekwas last
Monday night, when the men of
Haines overtook the Cla rkHall
‘A' volleyball team 21 in
games. The sorry part of the
story is that Haines did n0t
have enough hall members for
a ‘B’ team and lost the series
4‘2 games.

The only concern I received
as to my last week's article
on the 1M system came from
an [M head. So in response he
has addressed himself to the
claims and suggestions that l
have made. Any response to
his article would be welcomed
by myself and the sports staff.
