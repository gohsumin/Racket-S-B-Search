Football game halftime ac~
tivities last Saturday were hi-
lighted by a head-butting
contest between junior
“Penguin” Dave Feldman, and
sophomore Jim Demopulos,
better known as “The Fox."

Penguin Dave and The Fox,
both members of Grinnells 0b
Squad cheering section, claimed
to have Set the new world
record at 690 head butts.
Previously Feldman and
Demopulos claimed to have
held the world record of 150
butts, set during the first home
football game oi this season.

The Fox explained head»
butting as something that “Has
to be experienced.” The best
d iptlon this reporter could
give would be two people
literally putting their heads
together.

The contest began about live
minutes into halftime in the
section of the stands occupied
by the 0b Squad. 0b Squad
members encouraged both
butters by keeping count of the
number ol times their heads
cluliked together, and a base
drum helped to keep the
rhythm.

”The last butt was just as
exciting as the first,” explainr
ed Penguin Dave when the
butting contest was over. “It
could have gone on forever,”
agreed the Fox.

Both men and women can
par lolpale in head butting, The
Fox revealed. "It's a give and
take experience, a new form
of communication. There is no
physical pain involved; in fact
it‘s one of the most ecstatic
feelings one can have. It’s a
mutal experlence that is best
enjoyed when the two people
are willing to give equally of
themselves.”

Both butters are considering
entering the record in the .
“Guinness Book of World
Records.” but had not yet come
to a decision.

choice of headebutting as an
activity, The Fox replied,
“Why? Cause it was there”

Head-butting could be just the
answer President Nixon is
looking for. The Fox stated his
position as “I think if everyone
took time to head-butt, we
would have all the world
problems solved.”

Just imagine Richard Nixon
butting heads with Jerry Rubin!

Asked why he had chosen to
engage in headrbutting, The
Fox smiled. placed his hand on
his head, and replied:

“Why? Because it

While in town the trustees
had lunch with student leaders
from SGA and student media,

The Board of Trustees, a
self-perpetuating body, sched-

January 17 and 15 to discuss
its own composition. Leggett
said that the trustees are “dis-
satisfied with their Committee

with matters such as the
geographical background and
and age of trustees, and the
possibility of student represen-
