STONY BROOK

AFTERMATH OF A BUST

NEW YORK CITY, Feb. 28
(CPS)—Charges at nun~couper—
ation by university administra-
tors and “Gestapo-like police
tactics" were aired here last
week as two New York legisla-
tive committees began investi-
gating the use of drugs on cam-
pus.

The investigations grew out or
a Jan. 17 raid at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Stony
Brook in which 21 students were
arrested on various charges.

The Joint Legislative Commit-
tee on Crime heard Suffolk
County Police Commissioner
.lohn Barry testiiy that school
officials at Stony Brook had not
been informed of the impending
raid because "they had refused
to cooperate with the police in
the past.”

Stony Brook President John
Toll denied the charges of ham
cooperation and explained how
each example cited by police
was “in fact, an attempt to
work with police olficials."

Especially at issue was an in.
cident that took place in March
when the police received an
anonymous tip that a "put par-
ty" was taking place on the
campus.

President Toll testiﬁed that
the incident was an attempt to
frame an associate dean who

found a packet containing marl.
juana placed under his door.

Commissioner Barry claimed
that the administration warned
students at the alleged party
that the raid was to take place.
Retuting Barry‘s testimony
point by point, Toll claimed that
“I know -I can never catch up
with the impression that was
given . . ." by claims against
the university.

The committee came under
criticism for hearing testimony
publicly without ﬁrst determin-
ing its validity in private.

Senator John H. Hughes,
chairman of the committee, ad-
mitted the crime committee had
permitted heresay evidence to
be aired.

The Joint Legislative Commit
tee on Crime was also accused
of “smear" tactics by a lawyer
representing twelve Stony Brook
faculty members, who have ﬁg-
ured in a grand jury inquiry
into drug use by the Stony
Brook faculty, The lawyer ob
tained a court order to prevent
them from being subpoenaed by
the committee.

At another hearing, the Joint
Legislative Committee on Edu-
cation heard criticisms of police
actions used in the Stony Brook
raids.

American Civil Liberties Union

representative Hyman Herman
said that police violated a sec.
tion at the state penal code by
disclosing secret indictments
against students to the press be-
fore those students had been
taken into custody.

He also criticized the police
for allowing the press to accom-
pany them on the raid and to
take pictures of the arrests on
the grounds that most ol the
Students qualified for youthful
offender status.

Assemblyman Joseph Kottler
questioned Commissioner Barry
on the contents or a lM—page
mimeographed plan tor the raid
entitled “Operation Stony
Brook.”

The plan contained personal
information on each of the Sui)-
jects and was made available
to members of the press at a
brieﬁng before the pre-dawn
raid,

Barry explained that the docu-
ment had only been circulated
to police ofﬁcials, but that one
copy had been carried away by
a reporter. An unnamed news-
paper has since published ii
“book review" or the report.

Kottler claimed that Time and
Newsweek magazines had also
been furnished copies of the
documents.

A force of 198 dectectives in
72 police cars participated in
the Jan, 17 raid, They arrived
on campus at 5 am, armed
with pass keys and warrants.

FIRE DEPT SAVES HEDGER HOUSE

KATZ FETCHED FROM HOT HOUSETOP

By a Start Writer

Robert Katz (off-campus sen-
ior) suffered a narrow escape
Monday when men from the
Grinnell Fire Department had
to extricate him from the roof
of his burning residence at
1221 Broad Street.

Katz. who had been talking
on the telephone in his third-
ﬂoot rented room in the house

owned by Reverend John Hed—
ger, heard shouts about 4:30
pm, and tried to walk down-
stairs to investigate.

He was driven back by smoke
and heat [mm a ﬁre that had
already s p re a d through the
Hedger living room and hall to
the foot of the stairs leading
to his room.

After crawling out on the

FIREMEN BEGIN PACKING up their equipment after
quenching a blaze at 1221 Broad Street Monday. The ﬁre at
the residence or Episcopal minister John Hedger began when
one of his children was playing with matches. Senior Robert
Katz, who rooms on the third ﬂoor of the Hedger house, waited
on the ledge of his window until firemen put up the two lad-
ders enabling him to descend to salety,

ledge, Kat: waited until the
firemen arrived and set up
ladders. The Grinnell math ma-
jor then stepped down one
ladder to the root overhanging
the first story of the house and
down a second to the ground.

The blaze apparently started,
witnesses said, when one of the
Hedger youngsters began play-
ing with matches. “A fire
started," Mrs. Hedger told the
5&3, “and Luke (her son, 5
yeais oi age) came and told me
about it.”

Katz, Mrs, Hedger, tour of
her children, and a foster child
were all in the house when the
fire began. One or the children
screamed that there was a fire
in the living room. Mrs. Hedger
ran upstairs and carried her
babies downstairs and led the
other children out through the
back door.

Reverend Hedger is minister
of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church
here and has been involved in
discussion on campus of the
Town vs. Negro student Prob-
lem and the boycott incident
last month.

The fire department put out
the blaze in a few minutes, alter
an engine arrived at the house
and police cordoned on the
block. No one was injured, but
damage to the ﬁrst floor was
extensive.

Furniture in the living room
was destroyed, walls were
charred, and there was damage
from smoke to the rest or the
first ﬂoor.

Fire Chief Fred Taylor gave
no estimate of the damage, but
other firemen in the house com-
pared it to results of a fire in
Grinnell last week which totaled
$5,000.

GREGG NARBER,, COWLES SENIOR, LOOKS 0N as
senior Rick Sprott‘s ID. is checked by an unidentiﬁed
Grirutell police oiticer at the Longhorns nickel-beer at-
fair midnight Thursday, the 22nd. The Longhorn res-
taurant and bar, located at 1011 Main Street in Grinnell,

was commemorating George Washington’s

Birthday

when the Grinnell police raided the place. Also celebrat-
ing the affair was William 17. Alexander (Political
Science), who was escorted out of the Longhorn to his
home at 1221 Park Street, Grinnell, for lack of an ID.
Police thought that Alexander, unlike the many students
there with “proper" l.D.‘s, was under-age. None of the
students at the Longhorn volunteered to identity the 15-

year old prof.

he mused, “she wouldn’t Speak
to me for days."

The history professor revealed
that he had frequently played
the game tor six or seven hours
and “had never come to the
paint where a person does con-
trol most of Europe."

“It is the opening iive or six
moves that are important (in
the learning process)," Parss-
inen theorized. It is in them
that one “extracts the principle
involved."

“You can‘t read it like a
book," concluded Parssinen, “It
is only valuable when you re-
heat on it with something else,
like a narrative history of real
diplomacy.”

One major failing that Pat'-
ssinen noted among students
in playing the game is a lack or
knowledge of geography.

“At least it teaches them the
dillerence between Apoulia and
Tet-roliaiwhich they have to
know to play the game. It can't
be all bad."

Leggeit De-furreil
In ‘2600 Heist

Two turs valued at more than
$2,600 were taken last Friday
afternoon from President Glenn
Leggeit’s residence at 16130 Park
Street.

A coat and a cape of natural
b r o w n mink—both insured—
were stolen between 3 p.m..
when Mrs. Leggett left the house
tor a iaculty tea, and 4 pm,
when one or the Leggett girls
returned home from school.

Leggett told the 3&3 that
three metal file boxes—contain-
ing birth certificates, passports
and insurance policies—were al-
so taken.

Although the president origin-
ally estimated the value of the
stolen IUI‘S at $2,600. Leggett
told the 5&1; Tuesday night
night that he could not cite the
exact value.

“You see," he said, “they
took the insurance policies that
evaluated the turs." They were
apparently among documents in
the stolen ﬁle boxes.

Grinnell police have not been
able to identify the burglar or
burglars, who apparently en-
tered the house through an un-
locked door.

Police Chief Bill Peters re-
ported that no ﬁngerprints were
found although smudges indi-
cated that the burglar wore
gloves.
