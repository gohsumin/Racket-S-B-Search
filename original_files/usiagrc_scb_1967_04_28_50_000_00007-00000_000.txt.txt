There are more Grinnell men
out {or the Soccer Club than
ior any oiticial varsity and
freshman sport. The win-loss
record of the student-organized,
studentcoached group would be
the envy of any Grinnell team.

What, and who, is behind the
success of the Soccer Club? The
answer would seem to have
some bearing on the dilemma of
our ofﬁcial teams, and on the
role of intercollegiate athletics
at Grinnell. Next week’s Report-
er will include a feature on the
Soccer Club, and a discussion
of the value of intercollegiate
alhletics.

Now lot the intercollegiate
sports report: The track team
lost, 117-28, to State College of
laws Tuesday. Rich Weeks was
the only winner with a 165’9"
javelin toss. He also took third
in discus. Thor Evenson placed
second in the high jump and
440 hurdles, and Ric Machws
ell took seconds in the 380 and
mile. The Pioneer squad at the
Drake Relays this weekend will
be the smallest in years enter-
