The Pioneers will try to prove

touch, And the gridders will

Drake Team Overwhelms Harriers

Hopes that Grinnell c r o s s
country harriers would be first
in the nation, ﬁrst In the Mid-
west, or even first [in lows
came to a grinding halt last;
Friday. slaughtered by a very
potent Drake team. the Pio
neers pulled down only the last
iive places in the meet, suffer.
ing a 15 - 50 defeat.

The cross country team this
weekend will be able to try to
redeem itself against a team
that should be more equally
matched to the Pioneer—Cor-
nell.

Coach Ray Obermlller, not
greatly upset over the Drake
meet, said that it was no dis<
grace to lose to a team so out<
standing. Overmiller added that

with him last 8 e a S o n. De-
partees include end Rick
Schimmel, the league’s leading
scorer, and three all - confer
ence choices: halfback Mike
Vinyard, center Bob Martin,
and tackle Jack Woodman,

Although the Rams, with
thirty - six gridders, have the
conference’s smallest squad,
there are still many excellent
players in their ranks including
all - conference halfback Duane
Schultz.

the Drake coach told him the
aim of the Bulldogs squad is
to stand among the top five
national teams by the end of
the yeart Coach Obermiller ad-
dad that he thinks Drake will
make it.

Tile top finisher for the Pit)-
neers was John Sharpe, in ninth
place. He was followed by
Doug Dray, Steve orlnmall,
Spencer Clark, and Steve Mont-
gomery, in tenth, eleventh,
thirteenth, and fourteenth re-
spectively.

Obermiller is counting on the
Cornell meet to indicate how
his team will shape up in the
conference. Running against
Drake, he feels, tells very lite
the about the Grinnell team as
far as conference action is con.
cerned.

A new rule has been added
to the conterence this year that
will help Obermiller's evaluation.
Every team will now be requir-
ed to send results of all their
meets to the ether nine teams
in the conference.

Pleased with the freshmen
results in their meet against
Drake, Obermiller remains op-
timistic. Although they last, he
noted, they averaged a gain of
abattt thirty seconds over their
best previous time.
