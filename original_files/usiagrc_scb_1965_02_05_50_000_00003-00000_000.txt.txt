SCARLET AND BLACK

David Lighthourne —
letters to M other

Although this column is really nothing more than
a chance for my mother to hear from me once a
week, the awful pressures of society are some-
times Just so great that I'm forced to sit down and
set things straight around here. By sheer coincir
deuce, the new Forum is an awiully good target
for a little bit of compulsive intelligence.

The first Lhing that should be pointed out is
that Gtinnell students still don’t have a student
union, "they haven't had one since the old one was
torn down, Temporary facilties were ﬁrst set up
in Main basement and then in that new building
there in front of the library. Someday, mother,
maybe some day . ..

In the meantime, though. there's no need to make
the situation more difficult. If students Want to use
the showroom and window displays in the new
building, they ought to cooperate with the ad-
ministration hirelings who also use the place. On
the other hand, I think it would only be polite lor
the students to be given proper respect.

The [list obvious problem has to do with the grace
and gentility that's running rampant over there.
Please don't. misunderstand me; I think grace and
genrihty has its place in hie, along with golr shoes,
clock bottles, and anything else. Grinnell House

is full of it, and that’s fine with me. What l want
to know is what that has to do With students? There’ll
be plenty or time tor grace and gentility in later
years, when we can‘t ﬁnd anything better to do.
At the moment, however we are presumably con
cerned with more interesting and more important
matters.

Aside rrom all the petty little ways in which pre-
tentious formality has been dropped over there—
dropped like lace handkerchiefs soaked in cheap
perfume — the incident in which a Grinnell student
was suspended from college is of the most interest.

The decision of the dean cannot be criticized, The
student involved directed unmistakably abusive lan-
guage at a lady. The dean or men characterized the
incident as “outrageous," which it was. But it was
also more outrageous than the dean of men has
apparently considered. The incident could not have
occurred in anything but an outrageous situation.

The student was asked to leave the building in a
manner which was both unprovoked and thoroughly
ungentile (please ignore the irony). There was
neither right nor reason for this i concealed in-
sult. It occurs to me that “ludicrous" might have
been a better choice or words in the dean 0! men's
remarks.

Tom Pope, the student math

found that the plushness of the

is too ritzy; a lot of students
say they are awed by the

Perched atop the flat, mid-
western Grinnell College cam-
pus is the college's Cafie del

While about 80 per cent of the'
