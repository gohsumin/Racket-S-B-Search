is there anyone out there who
didn’t dig the B. B. King con<
oertdance last Saturday night?
If there is, he or she must feel
very lonely. Seldom, if ever,
has Grinnell ever seen so many
people together in one place

One-ﬂail Band Here
For Saturday concert

Tomorrow at 9 o’clock in the
South Lounge, Grinnellians will
have the rare opportunity to
hear “The Lone Cat," Jesse
Fuller. Fuller, a native Geor-
gian who now lives in San Fran»
cisco, has gained prominence
as a one-man hand during the
last ﬁfteen years, but he has
played music for more than a
halfrcenturty.

Fuller simultaneously plays a
myriad of instruments, includ
ing an electric guitar, foot cym-
bals, harmonica, kazoo, and a
homemade bass called a fol-
della. The “good—time blues"
which Jesse Fuller performs
are nearly all his own compo<
siiions, the most popular of
which are “-You're No Good"
and “San Francisco Bay
Blues."

enjoying such universally good
vibrations. Miss Georgia Den-
tel, the college's Activities

Counselor, called it “the most
successful concert we’ve ever
had." It was a beautilul scenei

B, B. King gets around. The
weekend before he came to
Gl'irlnell he headlined an in-
credible all-blues Show at New
York's Fillmore East that fea-
tured Albert King and Bobby
“Blue” Bland (with guest ap-
pearances by blues greats T-
bone Walker and Oils Spann),
The night before his Grinnell
appearance, he gave a concert
In St. Louis; the night after
his Grimell concert he did a
gig in Chicago. in other words,
Grinnell was not exactly the
highlight of his itinerary # but
you couldn’t have told that
from the performance he gave.
King's performance was a
triumph from the moment he
walked on stage; in fact, he
received a standing ovation
just for appearing, and it was
uphill from there. When he
picked up his guitar, Lucille,
and started playing “Everyday
1 Have the Blues,” people
started to jump, scream, dance
and fall on the floor, and It
kept on in that joyous vein for
two hours.

King's back—up hand, Sonny
Freeman and the Unusuals,
was impressively together, in
spite of the fact that his
pianist almost didn't have a
piano and his bassist almost

didnt have a bass amp. But,
oi couise, it was B. B. who
knocked everyone out, with
his singing, his guitar playing,
and his amazing ability to com
municate with his audience. A
rock freak friend of mine said
to me the next day, “it's in<
credible . . .he actually talks
through his guitar! Hes the
best guitarist in the world] He
makes Clapton look sickl" Yes,
he does.

Almost as amazing as his
performance was the fact that,
after the concert, he sat around
for over an hour rapping casu-
ally for n KDIC interview.
There's no telling how long he
would have talked if we hadn't
all been asked to leave Darby
Gym at one in the morning.

Not only is o. a. King a
brilliant artist, he Is a genu-
inely warm and friendly human
being. That’s a rare combina-
tion, as they say, and Grinnell
was fortunate to have him here
for an evening.
