Cartoonist Coplivoies Audience —
Draws. Talks. Jokes at Lecture

By Pam Clay

r “My normal working day
starts at the office at 9:00—
just in time to take a coffee
break at Bishops," said Frank
Miller, cartoonist for The Des
Moines Register and Tribune.
“1 try to return to the office
in Lime to leave for lunch; then
I go back and draw for about
two hours!" Mr. Miller said
that this ”daily schedule" does
point up one important thing
about editorial cartoonists, “To
{lave an idea one must have
omething to say; 90% of the
work and time is getting ideas."

Mr. Miller was graduated
from the University of Kansas
with a degree in fine arts. He
went on to study at the Ram
Ens City Art institute. He came
to Des Moines about ten years
ago after working on the Kan<
ﬂas City Star.

To prove that his artistic tal-
Dnts have never been ignored,
Mr. Miller explained how he

ainted everything possible dur-

g his five year stint with
Uncle Sam. What artistic cre<
Btion it took to stencil names
on thousands of helmets, to
stencil stripes, oak leaves, and
stars for the officers; the air
Iorce (unofficially) even do-
manded pin-up girls on the
noses of their planesl ”The
armed forces have this neces-
sity called a latrine, and every
time we moved I painted a sign
“LATRINE CLOSED OUTi"
.Why, my art work is in Ger-
many, France, Korea . . .1”

Mr. Miller used visual aids
to the best advantage through-
out his lecture. The first car-
toon he drew showed the typi-
cal image of a cartoonist: be-
ret, long hair, sunglasses, and
landals. He has received vari-
ous comments about his career
such as: “You don’t look like
one,” ”You actually make a
living doing that?” and, “Why

 

don’t you say something fun»
ny?"

He demonstrated some typi-
cal commercial cartoons and
then gave his own version— en-
tirely different but much more
truthfull Mr. Miller said his
cartoons are drawn “the way
I see life"

“The editorial cartoonist gets
lots of help from world lead-
ers." he said. To illustrate his
point he mentioned Castro’s
beard and boots, and Johnson‘s
ranch and hat.

The beginning of a cartoon of
Khrushchev was guessed by
sophomore Phil Bernstein. He
got to keep the original but per-
haps guessed a little too soon;
all he got was one line indicat~
ing a bald crown.

Mr. Miller said that he and
other cartoonists have been at-
tacked by members of the John
Birch society because “humor
is a luxury we cannot afford in
th e s e terrible times.” He
claimed that Americans have
always had humor and that it
is now a necessity. Paul Revere
and Benjamin Franklin were
the first American editorial car-
toonists. but even the cave
drawings. which record how
people lived, are editorial car<
toons, he pointed out.

Mr. Miller’s technique is the
old-fashioned one of pen and ink
9“ smooth paper; he is not tech-
nically correct but feels free to
dream up his own images of a
locomotive, character, or set-
ting. ”We must think, read, lis-
ten. and then speak and act,’
he said. ”Everyone must do
this, not only the cartoonists
and reporters. In Russia the
press is a tool of propaganda—
it can happen here.”

Reading from former Pres-
dent Kennedy’s tribute to Rob»
ert Frost, Mr. Miller quoted,
". . . art established the basic
human truths. . ."

”Drawing cartoons is a job
I love; I can’t think of any-
thing I would rather do."
