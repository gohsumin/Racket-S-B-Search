Dull Summer Replaced b y Excitement of Service, Tri

By CYNTHIA BRUST

“‘1?” did you do this sum-
moi" This traditional Grinneil
ice-breaker and New Students
Days time-killer often leads to in~
temsting results. Aside from a
date with that heat boy, you
might also find yourself discussing
trips to Europe or social service
projects, as well as life in a fac-
tory and the speed of summer
school classes.

"Vacationing" Grinnellians sat
in classrooms from coast to coast,
and then some. Some took classes
for fun, and some used the oppor~
tunity to fulfill requirements for
graduation or for teacher certiii-
cation. Judy Roberts, senior, was
one of the few lucky ones whose
summer school was far more than
classes, for she studied in France
Ind lived with a French family.
Tarra Hookham, senior, studied in
California at an artist’s colony un-
081' Marguerite Wildenhair, one
of the world's leading potters.

Several summer opportunities
Ire provided by various depart-
ments at Grinnell, and provide ac-
ademic credit, a salary, or both.
Typical of these is the nineweek
program at a biology field station
in northern Minnesota, attended
this year by Dave lines and Shar-
on Sheumaker, seniors, and Peg
Gerber, junior. Careers in social
work provided jobs and practical
axperience in the field for Holly
Hoebel, senior, and Beth Whit-
tnore, junior, who worked in Chi-
lagu and Cleveland, respectively.

Nine weeks of teaching at Le-
Moyne College earned credit for
practice teaching for Rin Yeisley

 

and Barb Plager, as well as conr
tinuing one important area of the
college’s exchange program with
Grinnell. Steve Shender and
George Wittgraf and Steve Kent,
juniors. worked in Washington,
D.C. as this year’s PPPE interns.

For those who found working a
necessity during the summer, a
wide range of usual and unusual
jobs were ﬁlled by Grinnellians.
Jim Drasdo, junior, teaching surf-
ing at a Hawaiian hotel, and Steve
Tilly, working on a farm in
France, Cﬂver the eeremes. Grin-
nelilans also served as lemon pick-
ers (Janet Poland, sophomore).
French teachers (Jim Bruce, jun~
ior, at Phillips Exeter), and re-
search assistants (Jane Flad, jun-
inr, in a cancer research lab). The
workings of the theatre drew at
least two Grinneli girls; Pat
Smith, a freshman who worked
backstage at the Santa Fe Opera.
and Melinda Ward, junior, who
worked in the box»ottice at the
summer theatre in Nyack, N.Y.

Dave D o n a h o o, sophomore,
whose official title was Grain Sam-
pler I for the State of Minnesota,
took samples of boxcar: of grain,
in order to fix price and quality of
the grain. Jim Wilson, sopho-
more, sprayed Chicago area parks
and forest preserves for the mos-
quito abatement program. Gary
Wilson, senior, may take the
year's award for most desirable
job; he was ticketman for the
girlie show at the all-Iowa Fair at
Cedar Rapids.

New York drew many Griiinell
students who desired a change
from the cornfields of Iowa. Anne
