"Second Annual' IM Banquet Held Tracksters Seek To Defend Title

23 Years After the First One!

Associate Dean Richard Win-
, ters and Dean of Men 5 Eu-
gene Thompson were special
guests Wednesday evening at
the Second Annual Grinnell
College Student intramural Ath—
letic Awards Banquet, where
the keynote was participation.
Six speakers participated in the
‘_ presentation program itself, be-
stowing more than a donm in-
dividual and team trophies on
the 17 attending hau represen-
r natives.

Master of Ceremonies ‘Panth-
er’ Anderson explained that this
tradition—now elated to be I
yearly campus “lair—was be-
gun with the First Annual LM.
Awards Banquet. held in 1941
Presumably the theme was
'particlpation' in those days.
too; the people in charge just
didn't do a very good job of get-
ting it across. Twenty-three
years later, Jeri Langharn
praised the high level of l.M.
participation now existing.

Lnnghain then pointed out
that if East Norris — eighth-
place linlsher in I.M. tennis
this season—had sent represen—
tatives to all of their scheduled
matches. they would have col-
lected enough forfeits to place
fourth. Langham also men-
tioned that of Clark Hall's 24

nor

victories in the LM gnlf
matches. 20 of them were by
forfeit. The last seven place-
winners in the gulf standings
were arranged according to
which team had the fewest for-
feits, Langham noted before
closing; three halls having rur-
feited all 30 matches. Coach
Edd Bowers than praised the
high level of LM. participation
now existing.

Bowers also presented the
MacMurmy and Truesdale tro-
phies to Smith Hall, overall
paint leader for 196586. This
was Smith's third straight year

nhling them to retire the present

the past year by Jim Randall.
I preview of the 196567 season
by Dan Marklnhnn. and a short,
change-oi—pace talk by Athletic
Director John Pﬁtsch on the
philosophy of intramural sports
rounded out the program.

The absence from the dinner
of President G l e n it Leg-
gett served coincidentally in il-
lustrate the paint Langham and
the other speakers had tried to
make: by not attending, Leg—
gett missed a chance to gain a
forfeit on Dean of Women Jean
Slocum. She was not the re
either.
