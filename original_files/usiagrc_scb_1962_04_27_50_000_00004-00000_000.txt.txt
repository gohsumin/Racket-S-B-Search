Courl' ruling favors Norris men

by John Williams

The High Court, ruling on the
case of Young vs. West Norris,
last Wednesday upheld lay a 470
vote the supremacy of a duly
approved hall constitution over
the actions of the house council,

The Court ruled that the West

Norris house council acted out.
side oi its area of jurisdiction
when it voted to delete a sec-
tion of the preamble to the West
Norris constitution. The decision,
written by Chief Justice John
Broeker, stated that any hall
possessed the right to guide the
actions of its house council
through a written constitution,
and that such a constitution, if
consistent with the SGA con.
stitution, house rules, and Cole
lege policy, may not he over—
ruled lay the action of the house
council alone.

The decision set forth three
questions oonoorning the posi—

onstration." _

No official extension was made
on women‘s hours although plans
for 3 “systematic check-in” ‘had
:been mader Dean of Women
Evelyn lGal-dner would issue nu
report of the number or women
who had n0t signed in at mid-
night or who were missed aiter
that time. One unofficial source
said that only 79 women were
in the Quadrangle at hours. An-
other source estimated that some
200 women were Still absent at
2 am.

At the same time the men’s

Presidents were heing spirited
to the schoolhouse, another
group succeeded in capturing

members of the women’s coun-
terpart for the Coll-1P, the As-
sociated Women Students Board.

The Women Presidents were
taken to a tool shed at Rock
Creek cemetery Where they
were held until about 1:30 am.

Estimates of how many stu-
dents were involved in the "riot”
’planning ran from so to zoo.
One of the ten involved in the
“kidnap” phase said plans were
being laid as early as February
this year,
iMimcographed notices explain-
ing the procedure for the “riot"
were passed out among students
early Wednesday evening. Sign.
ed day “The Spring Riot Com»
mittee,“ they listed a schedule
or late evening activities includ—
ing a movie on North Campus,
music and refreshments,

the SGA cimstitution binding
on the entire student body;
second, does the house council
possess cemin rights which
may not be taken away by the
hall; and (ﬁnally, must the
hall yield to the house council
though the two are in dis»
agreement.

The Court upheld the supreme
racy of the ‘SGA constitution and
its delegations of authority, par-

ticularly to house councils, hutl
the house council,

ruled that
could not override the desires
of the hall when codiﬁed in a
hall constitution. The Court
found nothing in any superior
document or policy which denied
this right to a hall and declared
that existing SGA policy imr
plied the responsibility of the
house council to the hall in sev-
eral instances.

Associate Justices Dick Ander-
son, Eire Duhitshy, and Toni Kor
loski concurred in the decision.

Orchesis, ‘Grinnell’s modern
dance organization, will present
its spring concert tonight and
tomorrow at a pm. in Roberts
