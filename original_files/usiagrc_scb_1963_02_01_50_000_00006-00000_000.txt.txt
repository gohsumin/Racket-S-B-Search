The Grinnell basketball team
brought its record over the .500)
-mark with victories over Lawn
rence and Coe last Saturday and
-Tuesday in Darby gym.

”In Saturday's 92-67 rent, the
Vikings were [he ﬁrst to break
the scoring ice, but from that
'polnt the PiOHEGI‘s tool: complete
charge. Aiter the opening has-
ket, Grinnell connected for 20
straight points, holding the vi
itors scoreless for 6V2 minutes. .

The Pioneers increased their
lead slightly as the half drew
to a close, the score at the
midpoint being 50727. In this

period both squads took 40

Shuts at the basket, with the

Scarlets hitting on 50 per cent

oi theirs, against Lawrence’s

32 per cent

In the second half the Pioneers
ran up a Soapoint lead,
cleared the bench, coasting in
for the ﬁnal game total of 92
points. I

JIM MIFFLIN led the Grlnnell
point collectors with a total of
20 markers, while John Sundell
was second with 16. The ‘Pioneer
defense held the Vikings' high
scoring guard, Joel Ungrodt, to
only 13 points.

in Tuesday’s contest, Grinnell
held a Slim lead throughout the
early part of the ﬁrst halt, but
broke away after a ﬁVCApoint
play. Mitilin was fouled while
shooting, and a technical foul
was called against Coe's Jim
Beckman. Mimin connected on
each of. the three charity tosses.
and the Pioneers scored againl
after taking the ball from out all
-_bounds. ,

Hitting on 45 per cent of "
their held goal attempts (and i
44 per cent for the game)
Grinncll ran up a 12-point, 57-
43 leid. Miﬂlin’s 11 free
throws for the half kept the
Pioneers well ahead.

Grinnell increased its lead to‘
20 points in the second liali, but
a prcss by the Kohawks met
with some success. Coe came
within nine markers. then drop—
ped farther- behind the hot-
shooting Pioneers. When the bio-
hawks began their press, Grin-
riell slowed the tempo of the:
contest down, waiting for good
opportunities before shooting.
The ﬁnal score was 92-76. i

Mimin led Grinnell in seoringi
with 33. But it was Suiidell,
playing with tour Iouls most of
the second half, who saved the,
contest by pulling down the im—x
portant rebounds when the K0-
hawks’ threat was most severe.

Sophomore Skip Swan led Coe
With 18 points, while the leading
scorer tor the ’Kohawks. Wylan
Wittc, was held to three.

“Coach, I‘m sorry, but ever
since I"ve been out for basket-
ball. my grades have been fail-

.‘ing. I'm going to have to quit." ‘

How many coaches have
heard this “I'm sorry, coach"
speech? How many have vainly
tried to convince athletes that
intercollegiate athletic competi-

‘tion has little effect on grades?

A study which supports this
claim has been conducted by
E. G. Booth, in, professor oi
physical education at Simpson
College. From his research, he.
was able to conclude, “In this
particular study, participation
in athletics did not ahect aca»
demic achievement by lower-
ing grades"

The study. conducted at a
small (1,000) liberal arts college}
gives coaches and supporters all
intercollegiate athletics evidence
which can be fired at critics

so students who did not particiv
pate in intercollegiate athletics,

But the Pioneers couldn’t keep

Football lottermcn's grades
rose little during periods ot

average at the mid—semester

was slightly below so. These
grades coincided with the end
of the tootball season. Their

grades were, like nothixtllletes,
slightly higher, the average
being 81. ,
