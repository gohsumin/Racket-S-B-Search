CAMPUS
ENQUIRER

by Ken .Suhiif

Men on campus were asked. \

In your opinion, what it
any, are the changes brought ;
about by the resumption of nu-
clear testing, and what are the
‘possible and results or such a
program?

Capt, Dean K. Mandcville: in
view oi recent world events, it
would appear that our resump-
tion of nuclear testing is a neces-
sary step to insure ourselves or

a military instrument capable or nation and to consult with Thaiicern over
onieiais as to the means where ‘-

supportmg our national
tives '7

Mike nor-watt. ‘63: The most
fundamental sue involved in
the resumption or nuclear test-
ing is whet

oblece

vc: or it he is able
to survwe, \Hll he be able to
withstand the deleterious efi'ects
of strontium so.

it is a sad thing when two
nations, both proclaiming hu-
manistic goals, set themselves
to the task of finding the best
way to.,destroy humanity. It
silt betrayed her total la
sincerity through her rcsump- 4‘
tion of testing.

The United States iiol. only

‘would have a basis of euphort

to protesting nations, but also
would sustain a valuable stategic
and propaganda advantage by
continuing its moritorium on nu-
clear testing,

Ray Horton. '52: It merely
brings home the direction in
which we are travelling. and its,
value, it any. lies in the tact that;
it may wake certain people, not
only in the government but
throughout the country, to the
pos bility of a nuclear war.

Dean Wood: The Russian de
cision to resume testing is a bru»
tai decision, however one looks
at it. The original unilateral den,

,cision to stop testing was used!

to serve specitic purposes oi the
Russian state. it is possible that
this decision was entirely Krus
cllcv’s, consciou y
bring about a s ategic advante
age. .

If, however, Khruschev was ‘
forced into this decision by ,
more militant factions of the ,
Russian regime the implica—
tions are born 3mg. It means
that Russia is in a state of dan- t
gerous instability and even
Khruschev has little control
over itussiau nuclear polio

i feel that the United Sta es
decision to resume testing even
on a limited basis was not to our

‘ advaniage. We could have beIlCi'

rurthered our position by lianele‘
hug the issue as a negotiation
taetor in our tavor and as a
means of winning greater ptlbel
lic approval. ,

Charles Cleaver: The first nlJ~l
vioiis change is a notable iu-l

icrease in leaf and a new kind
‘ol uneasiness in foreign diplo-

macy. This uneasiness could lead
to one of two possible end r
suits, total war or a more rea—
sonable consideration ot the a
race. An obvious third po. '

ity is that we will learn to hrc‘,
with this tension. '
