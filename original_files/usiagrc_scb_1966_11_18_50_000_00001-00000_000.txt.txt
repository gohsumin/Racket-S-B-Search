This Tuesday, Nov. 22, at 4:15
p.m. inthe South Lounge, senior
Steve Shender and sophomore
Joseph F. Kennedy will debate
the question: “Shall We Stand
in Viet Nam?" Kennedy will
take the aiflrmative and Shen-
der the negative. Charles Ran.
som, editorial writer tor the
Des Moines Register and Trib-
une, will be the moderator.

“The reason i organized this
debate,” said Kennedy, "is that
I feel only one side of the Viet
Nam question has been ade-
quately presented on this can'l~
pus. While 1 sympathize with
those who oppose our Viet Nam
policy and while some of their
reasons ore legitimate, on the
Whole l think their Views are
shortsighted. Generally I don't
think the domino theory has
been disproven and what is at
stake ill Asia is the fate of 325
million people."

Shender declined to make any
comment on the topic beiore
the debate Tuesday.

The debate will consist of two
litteen minute speeches by

An AWS Board-CofHP proposal eliminating women's hours
passed the Student Senate Wednesday night. The Faculty Commit-

tee on Student Ailairs, to re
ceive the resolution Tuesday,
will have 30 days In which to
recommend and refer it to
President Leggett, who will
present the measure to the
trustees.

The tollowing remarks pret-
aced the hours‘ elimination pro-
posai;

”Reassessment oi the stu-
dent role in the college com-
munity has resulted in a real<
lzalion or basic philosophic ins
consistencies regarding expec-
tations of students and a fur-
ther realization oi the need
to overcome these inconsis-
tencies by changes in the
rules governing student con-
duct. . .

“Emphasis in discus-
sion has been placed on the
individual, his needs and his
potentialities and the impor-
tance or permitting him to
express and develop them. Al<
lowing students to exercise
irecdom or choice and person-
al judgment becomes is neces-
sary, calculated risk, depend-
out upon trust and conﬁdence
in the student, and the under-
standing and cooperation oi
the other members of the col<
lege community. . .

“The demands ior uncriti-
coi acceptance oi general
standards necessitated by n
rigid social system are lacun-
slstent with the critical anal-

ysis demanded in academic
areas or the community.”

Both the AWS Board and the
Coil-lP passed resolutions ask-
ing that the change in hours be
instituted at the beglnning of
second semester. Although the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs has met with the AWS
Board and the CofHP, and the
trustees are aware that the pro-
posal is under consideration,
President Leggett has not yet
been involved in discussions of
the measure.

The principle recommenda-
tions of the Student Senate pro
posai read as ioliows:

“In line with the elimina-
tion of Women’s hours, the
following suggestions regard-
ing closing hours tor the Quad
are proposed:

The loggia will be locked at
midnight during the week and
It 1:00 AM. on Friday and
Saturday nights. Women leav-
ing or returning after loggi-
ciosing hours will do so at
Maln door. Men must be out
oi the loggiu by closing hours,
and are not permitted in wom-
en’s residence halls after 10:30
during the week and 1:01] A.M.
on Friday on it Saturday
nights.” ,

Freshmen women will be
subject to loggia closing hours,
