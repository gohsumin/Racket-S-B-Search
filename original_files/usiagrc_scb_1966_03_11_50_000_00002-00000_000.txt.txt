Editorial
_.Goddard's Promises

‘ Wednesday night Jerry Goddard delivered the
traditional president’s farewell address to the Senate
Klee age 1) and his speech bears examination for it
roves r Goddard’s failure as an SGA president.

' Goddard pointed with pride to promises he made
In September. He promised maintenance of the status
quo, promised students would not “hear a lot of discus-
Ilon about what SGA is up to this time," promised no
search for “sweeping reforms,” and promised “rela—
tlvo calm" Goddard kept these promises,

' Goddard maintained the status quo. However, the
Item: quo, in his own words, lacked “dynamism” and
I "willingness to move ahead with more liberal pro-
grams. . .” Goddard complained bitterly in his speech
that in» the days of Dr. Bowen the campus made tre-
mendous progress “toward the ideal of a truly liberal
arts college" and that that “aspect of Grinnell College
. . . has been at least forgotten, if not lost entirely."

The reason progress has stopped is people like
Goddard who lack the ability and resolve to regain
lthis lost “dynamism" and ”willingness to move ahead
with more liberal programs. . .” The reason progress
has stopped is SGA presidents like Goddard who are
proud of maintaining the status quo but who at the
same time attack it. Goddard’s speech is filled with ref-
erence: to what is wrong with the status quo.

Goddard promised that there would not he a “lot
of discussion about what SGA is up to this time.” God-
dard did not seek discussion or, for that matter, partici-
pation. As all the SGA candidates this spring said,
Goddard’s administration lacked widespread student
“involvement.”

Along the same line of limited discussion. Goddard
accused the 5&1! of inaccurate reporting. We make mis-
takes in reporting, and most of them deal with SGA.
The reason for this has been the gross unwillingness of
Goddard to cooperate with the 58:13. Had the 58:3 been
sharply critical of Goddard, his stubborn refusal to help
us would have been understandable. What is so remark-
able is that his unwillingness to help seemed to lack
motive,

Another Goddard promise was not to “lead cru-
lades for sweeping reforms.” And he didn’t, His speech
called for reform of what he tagged the “if-you-don’t-
like-it-get-out attitude” of administration towards stu~
dents.

No leadership to back this much needed reform
was provided by Goddard. He was too busy maintaining

the status quo.

Goddard was proud of the “relative calm” that
existed this yeari We feel the "calm” could more accu-
rately be called boredom.

Goddard said that the college “has fallen prey to
all the conservative forces that plague an institution
without purpose” Goddard himself was one of those
“conservative forces” He sought to conserve or main-
taina system whose lack of progress he lashed out
against Wednesday night. We are not going to label
Goddard a failure. He did it for us.

To Perform Varied Selections

The Riverside Singers, an excit-
ing vocal ensemble, will perform
in Roberts Theater tonight at 82%
p.m. Since [heir debut in 1958, the
group has won high praise
throughout lhe Eastern, Southern,
and Mid - Western United States,
where they have toured annually
for the past five seasons.

The six solocaliber vocalists are
Eileen Laurence, soprano; Joan
Mey, soprano; Barbara Crouch,
mezzo-soprano; Mui-iin Lies, Ten-
or; Alan Baker, baritone; and
Anthony Tamburello, bass - bari-
tone. Most of them received their
early training at the Juilliard
School of Music in New York.
Since their debut they have ap-
peared on some of ihe nation’s
leading concert stages including
The National Gallery in Washing-
ton, and New York's Town Hall.

The group performs in a variety
oi voice combinations, including
solos, duets, trius, quartets, quin-

ensemhle. Most
of ihe music is unaccompanied,
ranging from the Renaissance
through the Classical and Roman-
)tic periods. included also in the

ary works, some of which have
been written expressly for the

tels, and lull

Michael Miller, and Thomas Wag
ner.

Cited as a rare. highly polished
group with regard to balance,
[one quality. and elegance oi
style, their presence on the Grill-
nell musical scene is wilhoui ques-
tion a noteworthy event. The vocal
chamber music repel oire is ex-
tremely rich and varied; ihe Riv-
erside Chamber Singers do we]—
come justice to its many aspects
and styles.
