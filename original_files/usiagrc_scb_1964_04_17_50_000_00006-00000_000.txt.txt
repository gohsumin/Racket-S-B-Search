Hatfield Stresses
McGee Evaluates

By Susan Taylor

“Ours is a challenge to enun-
ciate the cause of liberty and
freedom,” Governor Mark Hat-
field of Oregon told a Republi-
can audience at the Republican
Mock Political Convention last
Friday night, Hatfield was the
keynote speaker at. the conven-
tion which nominated a Lodge-
Hatfield ticket for the ’64 elec-
tion campaign.

“Can we as Americans and
Republicans oppose the rising
tide of materialism Within our
society, the erosion of liberty
and of freedom, in institutions
and beliefs?” Hatfield asked.
“We have to look beyond the
'ibread-and—butter’ issues to a
declaration of faith in mese is
ones of liberty and freedom,"
he declared.

“We as the minority party
cannot be content with being
merely against. We have to
come forth with the alterna~
tives, with a program that pre-
sents to the American public a

ositive approach and not mere-
y a negative attack,” he said.

He further emphasized the
role of the minority party say—
Ing, “A determined, well-knit»
minority can overcome a com-
placent, lazy majority." “Con-
frontation is our theme at this
moment."

“Ours is indeed the party of
human rights,” Hatfield said.
“There has 'been an erosion
here, We can and We should leg»
[slate men’s actions to eliminate
discrimination. But we have to
serve as an example to elimi-
nate discrimination at the
source.” He charged that the
Democratic administration has
acted against its declared pole
icy. ”We have to do everything
we can to stop the disillusion»
ment of those who think the
possible passage of tile civil
rights bill will bring an end to
the evil," he said.

He Called attention to an
“erosion in our country as to
the moral foundations in our
nation."

“Not what we hold in our
hands, necessarily, but What We
believe in our hearts is that in
which we place our trust,“ Hate
field said. “We have the Cause
and the commitment to re-
claim for America her faith,"
he said of Lhe Republican party.

 

Minority Role:
World Changes

By Ann Showalter

Gale McGee, senator from
Wyoming, launched the Demo-
cratic Mock Political Conven-
tion Saturday by evaluating
some of the changes that have
occurred in the world during
the last four years.

“People no longer speculate
about who will Start the third
world war," he pointed out.

Since the Cuba showdown of
1962, when Kennedy's policy
showed the United States would
risk nuclear war to preserve
freedom in this hemisphere,
“the men in Moscow no long-
er dare to press a bluff in the
confidence that we won’t dare
to call it." _

The United States has fos~
tered the gaining of independ-
ence by many countries dur-
ing the past four years. McGee
feels, “The freedom of these
nations is the greatest single
barrier against Communism.”
He observed, "Not one of these
new nations has turned to Comv
munism."

“Never has our country been
stronger or freer from groups
dedicated to the overthrow of
the government," he asserted.

He attacked name-callingand
labeling as “substitutes for
thinking." When a new idea is
introduced, people may call it
socialistic, communistic, or
unAmcrican without trying to
understand it.

“Liberals wrote the Declara-
tion of Independence, but con-
servatives wrote the Constitu—
tion,” he stated. “Neither Side
has a monopoly on brains."

He called on young people to
meet the challenge of a world
which ”looks to the youth that
is the heartbeat of our his
tory.”

 

Sioux City, he was a candidate
for State Chairman of the Col-
lege YR’s. For the past two
years, he has worked closely
with the Poweshiek County Re-
publican Party, in several cam-
paigns and elections.

Home], Gates, is a member
of the Young Democrats, the
IRC, and the Civil Rights
Group. He is a state delegation
chairman and a campaign
chairman for the Democratic
Mock Convention, and has been
active in church and civil rights
programs, on and off campus.

Johnson, West Norris, is Hall
vice—president and has been a
member of his hall House Coun-
cil for two years. He has been
a young Republican member
since his Freshman year, has
attended State YR Conventions,
and helped organize [or the
YR’s in the 7th Congressional
District.

Clymei‘ will intern with
Jerome Ziegler, Democratic
candidate for Congress in the
14th Congressional District OI
Illinois. Johnson will serve his
internship with Evan I-Iultman,
Republican candidate for,Gov-
ernor of Iowa, and Homel will
intern with Ray Rybacki,
Democratic candidate for Con-
gress from Illinois' Fourth
Congressional District. Ferris'
internship will be with the Re-
publican State Headquarters at
Des Moines.

Each Intern will receive a
grant of $500 for the formal
twormonths internship, with the
expectation that he will be
placed on the host's payroll for
the third Summer month.

Collection of Etchings hy Gian Pirunesi
OH View in Schaeffer Through Apr. 27

Now on view in Scheaffer
Gallery in the Fine Arts Center
is a collection of 82 etchings by
the 18th-century Italian artist
Gian Battista Piranesi.

The prints were a 1962 gift
from Mrs. Marjorie C. Mur-
phy and her daughter. Mrs.
Elizabeth Carter, in memory of
John Frederick Murphy, ’10,

The exhibition includes the
famous ”Carceri" (prisons) se-
ries, which features 16 etchings
of imaginary prison interiors
through which the artist ex-

ploited his fascination with pere
spective in the creation of in.
terior spaces of overwhelming
and oppressive scale.

Another series of 16 prints
represents imaginative recon-
structions of Roman ruins. Pin
ranesi’s youthful ambition to
be an architect was never grat-
ified. As an artist he indulged
himself in picturing what his
time could not patronize—mans
umental architecture.

Piranesi's etchings will be on
view through April 2.
