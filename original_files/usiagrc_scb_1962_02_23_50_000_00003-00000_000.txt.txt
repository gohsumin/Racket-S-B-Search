by John Bi'ltckcr

The student auditors otfiec
this past year handled the
.counts of sonic eighty eampus‘
lol‘gammtiulls. From the period
iof Feb. 1, 1961. to Feb. 1, 1962.
lsome 2,300 checks were
ltotaling 'cr slothooo, In this
some period some 500 deposits
were received totaling slightly
over stoma (this iigure‘includes
a total’ of $40,000 taken in from
the activity Ices).

In addition to the above func-
‘tions the following duties \ e
added to the job of the audito 5
office this year:

1) The issuance or vouchers

to cover all purchases
made by student organi
cations.
The increase of office
hunt: to 11,4.» hours daily.
The job of completely
auditing the books or eve
