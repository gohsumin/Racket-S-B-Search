religious diversity, and Negro
slavery.

Comment on Black

Theater Presentation

Hy Nada Mungialclli

II' a drama is derived either
ii-om the author's imagination or
irom actual, real events, then the
hlack theater presentation
directed by actor-inrresidence
Errol Jones contained no drama,
11 acting is the trained evocation
ill emotions and actions of lic-
lional character, then the
presentation also contained no
acting in other words, this was
not theater.

lt is, thereiore, inappropriate
to criticize the presentation as
theater. What is important and
adm able is that this non-
tlicatrical presentation strongly
held the audience‘s attention and
got them thinking. The material,
writings oi great black leaders,
was not fictional but instead very
real. The presentation or these
readings was also real. because
the actors were not pretending
to be someone else involved in
a hypothetical situation, feeling
hypothetical emotions. They
were in tlte situation and actually
did feel the emotions. They got
Ilieirmessage across.

Henry Wiemun, Famous American Theologian
Now Living in Grinnell, Interviewed by S& B

By Slow Grow

One ol Grinnell's distinguished
residents is Henry Nelson
Wiemaii, a WellvkliDWn 20th
century American theologian.
Mr. Wieman taught at the
University or Chicago until his
retirement twenty years ago.
Since then he has
taught ten years at the
University of Southern Illinois,
several at the University of
Oregon, and at the University of
llouston, and for one year at
Grinnell College, Grinneli
College awarded him an
honorary degree in 1964, Mr.
Wieman is the author of several
books on the philosophy of
religion including Man’s
Ulliinnlc Commitment and The
Source of Human Good. His books
deal with the problem of defining
a new faith which is adaptable
to modern industrial civilization.
Martin Luther King wrote his
doctoral dissertation on the
works of Mr. Wiernan and those
of Paul Tillich. In an interview
with the 8&5, Mr. Wleman
discussed his views On religion
and on certain problems in
modern society.

Wieman noted that traditional
religions which look ,to another
hie and rely on a personal god
are declining in iniluence, largely
because ”there is no adequate
evidence” that such a god exists.
church attendance may continue’
but these religions do not el-
fectively influence the decisions
shaping the course of our
civilization. Mr, Wieman ad-
vocates a religious philosophy of
“Creative Interchange." “This is
a creativity always present in
human lite to some degree and
at some level, it is the way every
new born infant acquires a
human mind. It Creates and
sustains human existence and, to
the degree this creativity
prevails over counter processes.
transforms human life toward
the fullest content of value ever
to be attained. The problem is
to give this creativity tirst
priority in times or major
decision by always seeking that

“This creativity is a kind of
interaction between individuals,
groups, nations, and cultures
which does four things: (1)
creates in each participant some
sense of the values, interests,
ideas activating the other party
t2) these values derived from

time equipped with ever more

“Creative communication has
