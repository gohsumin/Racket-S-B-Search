, in the resolution of black stu.
'dent problems on college cam-
puses, Grinnell has been as ras
inarkable in its calm as others
have in their turmoil. Changes

that have been accompanied by
yiolonoe on scores or campusol
have occurred at Grinneli quiet-

and seemingly without prob.
‘ms, These changes are the
result of black student “recom-
riendstions" made to a Ma
0 meeting of the college trus -
oes in Chicago.
» A resolution paged by tho
trustees at that time stated the
intent of the college “to deal,
in all reasonable ways, with tho
hhallonge of developing a goal»
ity pmgraiu of higher education
{or black students and . . .
to approve such budgetary de<
iiciencies as may be deemed
by itself and the president to
be necessary and appro note
to implement this policy.’

“Specifically, the Board en-
dorses the president’s present
Intent to continue the axlstin
scholarship program [or black
students and to recruit necess-
pry faculty and staif preferably
black, to develop a studies pro-
gram (both academically and
extra-curriculerly) so as to im-
prove and make more relevant
the intellectual and emotional
environment of the Grinnell
College community tor all stu-
dents, faculty and stall, both
black and white.“

The recolilnicndatlons, which

both black and administration
sources preferred to term “ile-
clarationsoi need," were, in
addition to mose stated in the
trustee resolution: additional
black professors in all fields,
black advisors and counselors
in both Admissions and Deans
offices, special consideration of
black students from poor secon-
dary education backgrounds b
the Admissions cities, an of
campus Black Culture House,
a minimum at sixteeon black
freshmen in the class of 1973
and future years, and college
supplementation of tho Rockoa
teller Foundation grants to min<
ority students (the Rockefeller
grants had been scheduled for
a complete phaseout in two to
three years.)

Changes Underway W

Implementation of all these
recommendations is under-
way, although each ls in
a diflerent stage of devel-
opment. Additional black pros
icssors and a comprehensive
black studies program are still
in embryonic stages due to keen
competition for “qualified" per-
sons. At present only a "Specia}
General Education Program1
exists in AtroAi-narican Studies,
but it is hoped that by second
semester is tentative major will
be available.

A lectureship series in Black
Studies is planned for this sem-
ester, and possible speakers
will be Saunders Reddillg, a
Morehouse College historian.

 

It's a great lime.

author with Stokely Carmichael
of Black Power. l

Both the Dean's and Ad-
missions Oiiices have under.
gone changes since last spring,
the result being greater re-
sponslverless to black student
needs. There are two new black
faces ill the Dean's ofilce, Con-
ney M. Kimbo, Associate Dean
of Students; and Mrs. Dorothy
'P. Guy, counselor to women
students.

“Dean Kimbo was hired be-
cause he is highly qualified, not
because he is black." asserted
Dean Alice Low. Kimbo's duties
will coincide with those of for-
mer Dean 5, Eugene Thompson
(except for the editorship of tho
Grlnnell Magazine, plus soma
additional responsibilities. Hil
blackness is not being emphas-
ized, and he wants to be seen
as an all-campus advisor.

“I doubt if the black students
knew l was going to be hired
until it. happened," said Dean
Kimbo, smiling.

Counselors Appointed

Mr. and Mrs. Charles R. any
will be Grilmeli's black couple
in residence. Before coming to
Grinneli, the Guy's taught in
Mississippi. Guy will work in
the Admissions oriice, Mrs.
Guy in the Dean's Office. Her
title is listed in the catalog as
“Advisor to Black Women Stu-
dents," but Mrs, bow assures
that she will be available to
all women students.

Mrs. Guy will fill a real
vacuum in student advising.
Whereas black men have at
least had a few black professors
with Whom to identity and seek
adVlce, black women have had
no one. M. Charles Seller,
Associate Dean of Administra~
lion, put it this way: ”women
who are black have had no peru
son with whom they may disa
cuss their situation. They feel
particularly isolated."

To serve in a general ad-
visory capacity to black stu-
dents, there will he a joint.
Black Student Coordinating
Committee, representing the
Student Government Associa-
tion, the Concerned Black Stirs
dents (CBS), the Student Coord-
inator's office, the faculty and
the administration.

in regard to self»advisillg, the
black student organization on
campus, Concerned Black Stu-
dents, has also undergone “134
jor restructuring. Instead of a
president shoulderillg the ad
ministrative burden as in past
years, there will be a governing
triumvirate, c o in p o s e d of
sophomore Linda Copeland, and
seniors Frank Thomas and
Gregg Coggs.

“Protectorate oi! the People"
This new governing body for
CBS will be called “kotol-ro,"
on African term of unknown ol'<
igin meaning “protectorate or
the people”, when asked if he
thought black students at Grin-
nell need protection, Thomas
replied, “I think Black students
everywhere need protection."
With all of their requests
acceded to by the adminis-
tration. CBS's future policy is
uncertain. Asked what specific
plans they have for this year,

nest Weston said, “we don’t
know yet.” Frank Thomas says
the most immediate. though
less tangible, probleln to be
solved by black students “is to
develop a better understand“:
of ourselves and our potential.‘

The most visible of the new
developments millteting toward
this ideal oi pride and sell-con-
fidenco is the Black Culture
House. It is located on the
corner of Tenth and Park
streets, adjacent to the soccer
lield.

its focus will be, simply,
black culture, and all that it
entails. A library, artistic dis-
plays oi all kinds, discussion
groups and seminars are
planned to explore the cultures
of black people in America and
elsewhere. Two students will
live there as caretakers, and
presently sophomores K a r e n

ooldridge and Pat Baird are
serving in this capacity.

Administration and black' Stun
dent spokesmen emphasized the
“openness” of the new house.
“it is not for blacks only,” am-
phasized Dean Kimbo, Thomas
also emphasized that aspect oi

As Dean Seller stated, “We

Dean Seller oommented furs

“The black students made I
very constructive effort and the
college listened to what they

KDIC Resumes

Peg Morrison, manager of
KDIC, looks forward to the
campus radio station's second
year or broadcasting. KDIC,
Grinnell's lorwatt educational
radio station at 89.5 on the EM.

dial began broadcasting early
last week,

KDIC’s broadcasting history
began in May, 1968, when it
presented a brief schedule of
programs, going all the air im-
mediately alter Alumni Week-
end. Continuing last; school
year, under the managership
of Al Cloud, it completed its
iirst full year of broadcasting
in the small studio built over
Darby gym — a waiting room,
record library, and Z-room

studio, KDIC’s first broadcast'

this school year, from this
studio, was on Wednesday,
Sept. 3, at 4:00 pm, when
sophomore Pat Corbett went on
the air,

Peg Morrison and executive
board member Paul Lewis
agree that there are some for-
tuitous changes in station pol-
icy since the last show of last
year.

Miss Morrison summarized,
“it’s no longer a new station;
it should concentrate on being
a responsible and reliable sta-
tion,” .

Paul Lewis is KDIC's Pro‘
gram Director. He is eager.
and vocal, about the potential
role at the radio station as a

creative outlet for the student

body.

“The radio station exists by
and tor the student body," he

Broadcasting

said, “it can and should be a
creative outlet, particularly in
the formal areas of music and

drama. but also in the informal
areas, like the talk shows.”

Student personnel last year
numbered nearly 100, or 1 out
at every 17 or 18 students. it,
is expected to remain at this
level during the year.

The disc jockeys and newsu
casters work on a 7-day-arweek
programming schedule, from 4
to 12 each afternoon. Their prlr
grams are divided into several
categories to provide’a cross-
section or campus listening i
terest. Reviews and previews
at events Will be interspersed
in a format leaturing rock,
classical, blues, and country-
western music.

Plans are underway for a
more campuscrlented approach
in broadcasting than last year,
with emphasis being placed on
campus news and talents. Use
of “distributive services” will
be reduced. Services such as
the BBC, Radio Fairs, and the
intercollegiate Broadcast Serve
ice with their prerecorded
shows, may be largely re-
placed by presentations or the
viewpoints of faculty and ad‘
ministration. “it's a thrust to
im p r o v e communication," a
staff member remarked.

Interviews for disc jockeys.
technical and production people,
and newscasters begin on Mon-
day, September 15, Professor
