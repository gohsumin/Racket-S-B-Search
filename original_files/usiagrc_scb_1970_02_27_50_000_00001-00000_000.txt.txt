Faculty Meeting

At last Monday’s faculty
meeting Dean Wall reported the
following statistics concerning
Studentrteacher ratios at Grin-
nell. In me years 1959-60 Grinnell
had so faculty members and 1,002
students the first semester and
962 students the second
semester; in the year 1965-66
there were 103 faculty members
and 1,155 students the first
semester and 1,101 students the
second semester; for the year
1969770 the iigures were 132
faculty and 1,144 and 1,107
students. Dean Wall pointed out
that the large increase in faculty

students was unjustifiable ac-
cording to Grinnell's present
financial condition.

We 'mar Symposium Opens

By Steve Grow

On Tuesday evening Professor
Eric Kollman began the Sym-
posium on Weimar Culture with
a lecture, “Weimar Germany in
Historical Perspective.“
Professor Kollman, who is now
teaching at Cornell College, grew
up in Austria during the Weimar
Republic. A Jew, he came to Iowa
thirty years ago to escape from
Hitler.

Professor Kollman once
thought that the Weimar
Republic was born too late ill
Germany’s history; now he
thinks it was born too early. in
1947 Kollman prophesied that the
new German Republic would
have as little chance of survival
as the Weimar Republic, because

Professor Kollmzn spoke to a large crowd in

conditions in Germany after the
second World War were worse
than after the first, and those
conditions had handicapped the
Weimar Republic from its
beginning,

Germany had not faced its
defeat after World War I. Its
people had not expected collapse
of the army, and the Versailles
Treaty was called an “ar-
mistice" when it should have
been called an “unconditional
surrender." So the German
pcople retained the illusion that
they had not been defeated in
battle. From the start the
Republic was hated by those who
thought the harsh terms of the
Versailles Treaty unjust, which

included nearly everyone in
Germany. The Republic itself
was said (falsely) to have been
responsible for the “stab in the
back" at Versailles.

The government never had
control over the army. In fact,
the army became an independent
right wing force opposed to the
democracy. Kollman Cited the
failure to disband the army alter
the war and to build a new
democratic military force as a
mistake.

Germany was also confronted
with a split in her working class.
No one took it too seriously at
the time, expecting that the split
would heal, but it did not heal.
The differences were too fun
damental. There were as many
political parties in Germany as
there were points of view, and
the coalition governments that
were formed were inept and
unstable, for the German
politicians did not believe in
compromise. During the whole ol
the Weimar Republic no great
leader got the power in Germany.

Professor Kollman was quick
to add that conditions in Weimar
Germany were not unique, since
other European countries had
suffered great damage and
manpower loss during the war.
The great depression, which
caused “nightmarish inflation"
in Germany, also affected Britain
and the United States, but the
Weimar Republic was unable to
meet the crisis.

Kollman would not compare
Germany of 1913 to Russia at
1917, but instead to France in
1370. There had been a military
defeat, there was little one
thusiasm for the Republic, there
had been territorial losses, and
there were many radical political
groups. There were, however,
some differences: The Franco-
Prusslan War was a short one
and had not done nearly so much
damage. France had a
revolutionary tradition, whereas
Germany did not, The French
Third Republic had had time to
recover from the war; Germany
was hit by the depression almost
immediately.

What is the place of the Weimar
Republic in German history?
Was it merely a prelude to
Hitler” Kollman maintained that
Hitler’s rise was not inevitable.
There were many turning points
during the Republic when the
course of German history could
have been changed: for example,
a democratic army could have
been formed.

The Weimar Republic was a
very creative period for Ger-
many, as German scientists and
artists made great contributions
to [he world. Professor Kollman
