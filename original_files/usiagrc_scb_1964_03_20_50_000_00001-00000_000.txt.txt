Bowen Announcement Illustrates Efficient Work‘
Of Public Relations. Information Service Staffs

“A c om p l e t e emergency
situation that came out of the
woodwork," was the descrip-
tion given this week by Fred
C. Hess, director of college
public relations, concerning
the announcement made last
Friday that President Howard
R. Bowen had just been named
president at the State Univer-
sity of Iowa.

The public relations depart-
ment had been informed at

noon that day that the an-
nouncement of Dr. Bowen's ap-
pointment would be made the
following morning at ll) arm.
simultaneously with the cam-

r *

pus convocation called by the
President.

Hess, along with Mrs. Ruth
Prescott, director of the Infor-
mation Service, were in the
process of briefing their staff
about the weekend news story,
when a call came in from the
bureau chief of United Press
international.

"He said that the announce
ment of Dr. Bowen's appoint-
ment had just‘been made in
Des Moines," Hess said. The
rumor was checked out quick-
ly, and the Grinnell depart-
ment was soon well aware that
the announcement had been
prematurely made.

"For more than three solid

hours not one telephone line in
these offices was open for
three seconds at a time," said
Mrs. Prescott. “The Board of
Regents had apparently decid-
ed in Des Moines that once the
decision concerning SUI’s new
president had been made, they
couldn’t prevent an overnight
leak.”

"Actually, this was SUI’s big
story. They were set to oper-
ate, and we were set to co-oper-
ate," remarked Hess. The early
announcement, h o w e v e r,
caught newspapers, radio and
TV stations without material
