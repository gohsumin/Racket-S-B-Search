Five Elected T0
Phi Beta Kappa

Honor Society

On Wednesday evening, Nov.
13, the presentation of the fall
Phi Beta Kappa awards and the
Sophomore Book Awards was
held in Grinnell House. Phi Beta
Kappa, a national Scholastic
honor society, elects members
twice a year at Grinnell. The
fall elections, which are limited
to the top 215% at the senior
class, are held, according to
Phi Beta Kappa Secretary John
Cl'ossett, so that the chapter
will include seniors who will be
going to Grinnell for another
semester after the award.

Tha ﬁve new Phi Beta Kappa
designates, elected earlier this
tall from a senior class of 262,
are Grant Crandall, Michael
Domjan, Eleonora Spiegel, Don-
ald Stump, and Nancy Young.

The teatureri speaker was
Miss Evelyn Gardner, Professor
Emerita of English and iormer
Dean of Women. Miss Gardner
based much or her speech on ex-
periences in India. Her topic
was “The Peacock Rider".

The membership certificates
and book awards were then
presented by Mr. William
Roecker, chapter president, and
Mr. Crossett.

Sophomore book awards went
to five students this fall, because
a tie between two girls prevents
ed the usual selection of the two
girls and two boys with the high-
est grade point average in the
class. Recipients were: Robert
Dorsett, Randy Price, Margaret
Schottstaedt, Susan Seeder, and
Margaret Wait.

The award, a $15 carte
blanche tor the purchase oi

tended to buy one of Mr. Cros-
sett's books, Mr. Roecker as-
sured the sophomores.

phases oi operations with the
computer are not completely
organized. Plans are still in

The Monroe Hotel: Fiction, Elegy, and Satire

(First of two ports)

By MARK SABLEMAN and
PAUL ROTHMAN

Believe it or not, in down-
town Grinnell, there is a
building containing more his-
tory and more storybook leg-
end than one would assume
there could he in a town oi
this size. Reputed to be “the
largest wooden structure west
oi the Mississippi” at one
time, the Monroe Hotel, south
of the College on Park Street,
is surrounded by a mystique
that would bu hard to dupli-
cats anywhere.

The Monroe's iii‘st owner
was A Mrs. Gertrude Capron,
better known as “Old Lady
Capron." 1n the 1580’s and
1890's, just after she had come
to Grinncil from her native
New England, she bought in
building next to the railroad
tracks and made it into a ho-

tel. In 1898, she sold that hotel
and built a new one on the
east side of Park Street, be-
tween Josiah B. Grinnell's
house and the railroad tracks.
She gave this hotel her maid—
en name. Monroe, In 1908 or
1909. after J. B. Grinnell's
house had been moved south
on Park street to just past the
lumberyard, she built an ad-
dition on the north of the Hotel
which nearly tripled its capac.
ity.
Mutiny on the Bounty

While Mrs. Capron owned
and managed the Monroe, it
was a very prosperous and
Well known establishment—in
more ways than one. One stu-
dent who worked there as a
waiter in 19136 and 1901 was
James Norman Hail, the write
er and coauthor of Mutiny on
the Bounty. In his autobiogra-
phy, My Island Home, Hall
devotes a chapter to the Hotel

and his experiences there. He
describes Mrs. Capron as be-
ing “around sixtyriive at this
time . . . Her face had the
color or old parchment and
was so crisscrossed with fine
wrinkles as to be quite ex-
pressionless: but her eyes
were as blue and cold as p0<
lat ice, and her smile had all
the warmth of late aileritoon
sunlight in Siberian snow in
the dead of winter."

“A Howdy House"

Mrs. Capron’s ownership and
management or the Hotel
must have been a very excit-
ing and interesting period
both for the Hotel and {or the
town. In his autobiography,
Hall relates that the regular
dining room stair consisted of
girls ranging in age from the
middle twenties to the early

Unknown Gunner
Shoots at Town,
Campus Buildings

An unidentified person driv-
ing through town early Sun-
day morning tired a shotgun
into the room of Gregory Hill,
a sophomore living in West
Norris Hall.

Hill let: his lamp on when
he went to sleep and was a.
wakened at about 5:00 Sunday
morning to iind his wrist cut
by splintered glass.

Hill had left open the por-
tion of his curtain beside his
desk, and that part at the
picture window was full of
small holes. Further investi-
gation revealed nearly a hun-
dred holes in that and adja‘
cent windows. The desk was
covered with glass splinters
and shotgun pellets, Three or
the pellets ricocheted Dfi oi
the cement Wall behind the
desk, hitting the panelling a.
bove the closet at the head of
Hill's bed.

West Norris, who were in the
room directly below Hill’s. Te<

Sch neirov Leaves

Dormitory Room

This Monday, Richard SchneL
Iov vacated his room in Loose
Hall. This action complied with
the decision of President Leg-
gett on the Schneimv visitation
case.

In an interview, Schneirov
stated that he lives for the good
or society. He claims he would,
as a humanitarian, give his his
to the cause—the "great revolu-
tion." He was not. however,
willing to face possible expul-
sion ior reiusing to vacate his
room as ordered because, he
said, he felt it was not worth
fighting over. He realized that
he was losing some or the sup-
port oi the students, and he
did not want to undo all the
work he had accomplished. he
stated that his main purpose in
publicizing his trial was to get
students interested in having
longer opens‘ hours. According
to Schneirov, it was he who
started all the excitement about
having more opens, and he ac-
tually had to convince Lee Mar-
ii at the idea as Maril was com-

SGA Plotn Wins;
Voting Heotvy

In the allrcampiis referendum
held Monday, the majority oi the
Gi-innell students voting iavoi-ed
determination oi coed visitation
hours on a hall basis, with no
restriction on the number or
hours allowed. Of the 781 votes
cast, 413 or 53% favored the tick
limit home rule proposal while
318 or 41% voted for hall selfa
determination within the limit:
oi twelve hours a day on week.
days and sixteen hours a day on
weekends. There were titty
votes, 6% oi the total, favoring
no change at all,

Now that the vote has been
taken, the proposal will go to
the iaculty Student Affairs come
mittee. where it carries no more
oiiicial weight than any other
proposal.

Tom Thomas, SGA President,
pleased with the results or the
voting, warned, however, that
the vote will be meaningless un-
less the student body acts upon
it immediately. “The vote in it-
self is worthless,” he said, "un«
less we set up hall judicial coun-
cils, determine hours, and take
upon ourselves the responsibility
of dealing with violators.”

Administration reaction is ex-
pected to hinge upon the an.
swers to two crucial questions.
First, can the students set up a
workable system of governing
themselves to replace the pre-
sent, unsatisiactory system es-
tablished by the administration?
Second, under the system, will
the students choose to havo
twenty-tour hour opens, and if
so, can and will the adminis-
tration, backed by the trustee:
and alumni, sanction such a sit-
uatiun?
