Temporary union plans he yea/e ;
history of present building given

The latest in a long line of “temporary"
student unions at Grinnell wlll begin operation
on March it in the newly remodeled basement
of Main Hall, Merritt c, Ludwig (vice president)
annonuced today. Main basement will be the
campus social center pending completion in last
of the new Grinnell College Forum on which
constru 'on will start this spring. ‘

Activities in the old union building will be
dispersed to new locations by the end ot Febe
ruary Cyclone and 5&8 otfices will be moved

to 1022 Park SL: the food service office will
occupy remodeled space in Mears basement; the
oiiices of Georgia Dental (activities counselor).
the strident auditor, and social and SGA. com—
mittees will be moved to ARH. anne . and the
union grille and lounge will be moved to Main
basement

Most of the moving will take place during
the last week in February. “Although we will
try to keep the grille ope ting as long as pos-
siblc," Ludwig c id, “it. will probably be neces
sary to curtail, il not suspend, some activities in
the building that week,”

The college is contracting for removal ot the
old building during March. Dismantling will

probably start soon after March it.

The present building is the only real student
union building the college ever had. Ludwig said.
It is the suitcassor at several smaller social ce
tcrs once operating in such places as the “Y’
building (now Steiner Hall). the White House,
and the residence at 1206 Broad St., now the
home of John Kleinschmidt (modern foreign
language), Union operations in these locations
were pretty much limited to refreshments and
maybe some checkers and ping pong, Ludwig
commented.

Dismantled and hauled by truck some 235
miles from the Sioux City Air Base, the pres—
ent building was a war surplus structure given
to Grinnell by the government along with
several otlmr barracks buildings used to ac»
commodate the post—ww n student population.

The building was formally opened, complete
with ribbon—cutting, on Nov. 15'. 1947, Only
the first iloor was used ior socialepurposes;
classrooms and taculty oiticcs were on the see
ond floor.

In a student contest to name the building,
“Pioneer Pub” won out. but the name didn't
Stick. However, “Elbow Room.” the name given
to the back portion of tlic grille is still used by
some students and faculty.

At the grand opening of the union much at.
tention was given to a new popcorn machine,
and a unique donut making machine s 'd to turn
out up to 75 dozen dounts per hour.

“Everyone has always thought of the studentl

union as it ’ternpcrary' building,” Ludwig coin
mented. “Student generations since 1947 have
been telling visitors somewhat apologetically
that Grinnell is going to build a new social celle
ter soon, and no one expected the old bullding
to remain almost it: years’

Main Hall basement. the temporary ”union”
until September of 1964, has undergone major
remodeling: during the past 60 days. Tile former
little theater is converted to a large lounge area
with terrace A new outside entrance w s con-
structed at the northeast, and a new 211in r h to
the private dining room was provided.

The Whole area, including the private dining
room, is air condltionnd. New rest rooms and a
(oat storage roonl have also been Constlu ‘ted.

The former private dinlng room pantt'yrstor—
age space will become a temporary grille kitchen

wtih tlic picket”) counter just outside the PDR _

doors. Saga plans to offer the same rclreshment
menu. but soft drinks, candy, and cigarettes will
be rended by machine due to the cramped space
for counter ervice.

Furnishings from the present Union lounge
will be moved to the new lountze area, and rooms
adjoinlng the lounge will be used for television

and bumper Deal. The private dining room will'
he the grille seating area using the present FDR,

tcébles and chairs. Some booths will also be adde
e ,

The college expects to continue use of the prie
vate dining room for toreign language and othcr
group dining, Ludwig said. which means only
the lounge area and vending machine scrvicc
will be available during the noon and evening
meal hours most days.

Opening and closing hours and other details
concerning operation of the ncw union will be
annonuccd later.
