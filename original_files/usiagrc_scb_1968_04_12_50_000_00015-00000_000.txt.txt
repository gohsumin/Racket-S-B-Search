sympathy to Dr. King's iamily.

Black students on some white
campuses also held demonstra-
tions. At Western Michigan Uni-
versity in Kalamazoo, Mich,
about Ion black students entered
the student Center about 6:30
am. the day after the assassi-
nation, and closed the building.

Students left the building only
after the Administration met
a list of six demands, including
a promise to re-examine the
“racist curriculum.”

Students at the University of
Maryland held a rally on cam-
pus, and there were calls for
racial harmony and more Negro
history courses. The students
sang, “We Shall Overcome."

About 3,000 students at the
University of California at 1.05
Angeles listened to a tape-re-
corded speech by Dr. King.
Black student leader Artie Ivie
said, “if Martin Luther King
can be shot down, it shows the
goals and techniques that black
people will have to use.”

A BLOODY DREAM

At San Francisco Stale Col-
lege, a huge sign was placed
In front of the school cafeteria.
The sign read, “He had a
dream." Red drops symbolizing
blood were painted around the
word dream.

All campuses of the City Uni
versity oi New York were closed.

About 5,000 high school and
college students gathered in
Central Park to mourn Dr.
King's death.

One speaker, Jarvis Tyner,
national secretary of the WEB.
DquiS Clubs said, “Give me
treedom or give me death, be-
cause that's what it will take
to change America.”

About 300 police watched the
demonstration.

Black students at Wayne Slate
University in Detroit gathered
In the Student Center under a
picture of black militant l-l. Rap
brown and were belligerent to
white students. Also in Detroit,
three fires were started in the
Cass Technical High School
building.

OFFICIAL END OF
NON-VIOLENCE

in Washington, D. (2., slur
dents trom Georgetown Uni-
versity marched on the White
House asking President John-
son to declare a national day of
mourning.

The students were unaware
that the President had made
such a decision just as their
demonstration began.

The Georgetown University
Law School had to be closed af-
ter riots erupted in a nearby
section of the city.

About 60 students It MISSIS-
lippl Stale Unlversity held a
peace vigil around the sum
or Confederate General Stephen
D. Lee, who was the ﬁrst presl<
dent «I MSU. one student lend-
er. termed the crowd i)! all "not
only surprising but remark-
Ible."

Many black students said the
Initial reaction to the assassiv
nation was only the beginning.

Adrienne Manns, editor of the
student newspaper at Howard
University in Washington, D. C.,
predicted Dr. King’s death will
represent “the modal end of
non-violence."

DRAFT CARDS POUR IN
DURING APRIL 3 RESISTANCE

BOSTON, April 5 (LNS) —
Approximately 550 drait cards
were turned in at demonstra-
tions this week, almost all ol
them on Wednesday, the third
national day bi man resistance
held during lhls academic year.

This brings the total number
n! draft cards that have been
turned in or burned this year
to about 1,300 according to the
Resistance. More than 1,000
were turned in on the first
drati resislance day, October
16, and an additional 150 on
December 4.

The three major demonstra-
tions Wednesday were in Boston,
San Francisco, and New York.

In Boston about 200 persons
turned in draft cards at a de-
monstration 0n the Boston Com-
mon before a crowd 0i 12,000.
The cards were sent in Presi-
dential candidate Robert F.
Kennedy, rather than to the
Justice Department as is usual.
Three persons also turned in
their induction papers.

In San Francisco draft resis-
ters him throughout the Bay
Area turned in 144 draft cards
to 92 women, 13 clergyman, and
12 veterans who Will mail them
to the Justice Department, mak-
ing lhem liable for aiding drait
resisters. About 2,000 people at-
tended the rally at the iederal
building “1 San Francisco.

In New York so cards were
turned in at a demonstration
before a crowd of 1,500 in Cen-
Iral Park. Another 501 persons
signed cards indicating compli-
city with the resisters. Four
cards were turned in at Man-
hasset on Long island and about
20 cards are expected to be
turned in at II demonstration in
Ithaca, New York on Friday.

In Chicago about I5 persons
mailed their draft cards to the

credits can be earned in a
program requiring regular par-
ticipation during a school year;
one credit would be given [or
an activity demanding inten-
sive but irregular participation
during a year or regular par.
licipation during a semester,
A maximum of 4 credits may
be earned in one activity, and
no more than B such credits
will counll toward graduation.
These hours would carry no
grade-point evaluation.

These changes were engi-
neered with the intention of pro
moting interdisciplinary studies
and discouraging heavy spec-
ialixation. How do graduate
schools, with their tendency to
stress narrow concentration, re-
act in this type of liberal prep-
aration?

Wall noted that several lead-
ing universities, such as Har-
yard, Wisconsin, and Brandeis
have created interdepartmental
programs at Ihe graduate lev-
el. If the top schools begin,
Wall feels, others will soon
follow.

Another six persons turned In
tllelr draft cards during a Ser-
vice of Conscience with several
local ministers at the University
of lllinois. The cards were
leit on a desk at the Champaign-
Urbana draft board.

There were demonstrations in
three other major cities With
24 cards turned in in Philadel-
phia, eight in Los Angeles, and
14 in Minneapolis. in Minneapo-
lis one card was also burned
while two other persons burned
army discharge papers. One at
the Los Angeles resistors had
three possible determents: as a
student, a minister, and a vet-
eran.

College towns were the sight
of the other demonstrations
with 30 Cards turned in at Yale
University in New Haven.
Conn; eight at the University
at Michigan, three at Princeton
Theological Seminary in New
Jersey; two at: the University
OI North Carolina; and four at
the University of New Mexico.
in New Mexico the FBI an-
nounced it was conducting an
“appropriate investigation” and
one Air Force enlisted man who
was carrying a sign saying
“hell, no, I won't go" was ur-
rested by military police.

Demonstrations were also
planned iur Cincinnati, St.
Louis, and Syracuse, N. Y., but
all were canceled.

As expected, there was an
increase over the number of
Cards turned In in December,
probably due primarily to the
abolition of graduate student
deferments, which draft resis-
tance leaders say has greatly
increased student inlerest in
their efforts.

EX LOCO
DYING

By RUSSELL ELLIOTT
5&3 Staff Writer

Ex Loco Parentis is dying.

According to Mike Pcnzner,
Smith sophomore and manager
oi the coffeehouse, “We can no
longer atiord the present estab-
lishment at 829 Broad. Our
lease is up in May."

In the past about 32000 has
been raised, largely through
grants from the Board of Re
llglon, SGA, and the Student
Initiative Fundr Other con-
trlbulors were alumni, iaculty,
students, President Glenn beg-
gett ($100), urea churches, and
the Class of ’61.

This money has paid for little
more than the heat bill and
rent, totalling about $1700, for
the two and a halt semester:
during which the Coffeehouse
has been open.

Penzner does not anticipate
receiving the funds needed m
keep Ex Loco alive next year.
He sees the prospects of find
ing a place that is cheaper and
closer to campus as being
“very dim."

“At times we've had prob-
Iems with publicity and pro
grams,” he admitted, “but
when we’ve been successlul,
the response has been tremen-
done."

have been given complete free-
dOm to delermine which candia
dates and issues go on the bal-
lot, as well as oiher policies.

That does seem to be the way
It is working. When the board
of directors met last week In
the Washington Hilton, there
was no one from Time at the
meeting as they wrangled over
the ﬁnal candidates and issues
which will go on Ihe ballot.

The directors were In Wash-
Ington for tour days. In between
meetings with everyone 1mm
President Johnson (“He looked
like a ghost," said one) to
leaders or the Young Republl»
cans, they spent long hours
picking the candidates, choos-
lng which questions would go
on the ballot, and wording the
questions.

with mostly liberals on till
board, they need special pro-
Menu in trying to make sure
that conservatives were new
ed ruirly on the ballot For
example, they had their hardest
time working the “hawks” al-
ternatives In Vietnam, which
most of them oppose (although
they generally refuse to give
their personal pos us on the
war and are obligated not to
endorse or work for any can-
did-ate).

FOUR CONSERVATIVE
CANDIDATES

They wound up with only two
conservatives on the ballot—
Reagan and Wallace, plus Nixon
and Johnson, who Will draw
many conservative votes. The
rest of the 14 candidates are
“moderate to liberal." Having
fewer candidates may work to
the right Wing's advantage,
however, Since moderate and
liberal votes will probably be
more fragmented.

At one point, when there were
about 20 people still on the bal-
lot, only three of them hard-line
conservatives, Harris told the
board, “Sometimes I wish I
hadn‘t picked all student lead-
ers and had just picked some
students out of the middle of a
big lecture hall. That list is
balanced much too heavily to
[he left.”

The candidates will all be
listed Iogether in alphabetical
order. Students will pick their
ﬁrst, second, and third choices.
The first choices will be used
to determine the winner, while
the second and third choices
will be used ior analysis.
Write-ins will be permitted.

Listed on the ballot lor Pres-
ident will be Democrats Robert
Kennedy, and Eugene McCar-
thy; Republicans Richard
Nixon. George Romney, Nelson
Rockefeller, Ronald Reagan,
Marla Hatﬁeld, John Lindsay.
Charles Percy, and Harold
stassen; plus iormer Alabama
Gav. Gearge Wallace (Ameri—
can Independent Party) and
Fred Halstead of the Socialist
Workers Party.

The directors wound up drop-
ping several other candidates,
including J, William Fullbrigl’lt,
Texas’ conservative Sen. John
Tower, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
and Gen. James Gavin, They
decided not to pare the list too
sharply, however, because they
wanted to give students a wide
variety. “The question,” said
Wisconsin student body president
Mike Fullwaod, "in whose

my rights. One wonders, l0!
Mr. Schnerov is no Psycho.

i do not wish, in lhese pal-ab
graphs, to attack or defend the
action of Ihe United States in
Vietnam. Horrible as that ac~
tian may be, it is a transient
and local matter, beneath
which lie principles or perma-
nent importance. My point is
to expose the iallaciuus rea-
sons given by so many of those
Involved tor their decisions and
actions.

If we are going to opposq
the “war”, than we ought to
do it on sound ground. Ali
alheistical or unnatural appeal
to conscience is fallacious, 9
two edged “petard” on which
the resisters will find them-
selves hclst if they but stop
to think. Perhaps drinking will
sickly them n'er and result in
just such a devastating paraly-
sis as grips Hamlet—but at
least then they would have th
grim consolation that they ha ,
joined in with the great tragic
heroes of the Western worldI
with Achilles. with Hamlet. A!
It stands, their model is real-
ly a misunderstood and dim
wrted Aeneas.

Western culture and civiliza-
tion have given us, in the great
books. models for all forms 01
conduct. By applying con:
sciousness we will, I believe'
be able to solve this particular
problem of conscience which
now disturbs us all, both inter-
nally and externally. in Shortg
I am arguing that paldeia—even
that debased form of paidell
which is the modern small
liberal arts college—is the pro-
per means by which to reach
the end. And so far as I can
tell from the illiterate state~
merits generally made about
conscience, damned few of those
who appeal to conscience haVI
tried this means.

choice is Choice, our choice or.
the students' choice?”

AVOID RADICAL BOYCOTT

They also spend a good deal or
time trying to avoid a boycott
of the electlon by campus radi-
cals. Harris said he found radi-
cals cool to the idea in hll
visits to campuses. Most rad-
icals reject electoral politics as
a means oi changing policy.
They are also likely to be skop.
tical of an election involving
large numbers of college stu.
dents, most of whom are moder-
ale and unlikely to vote radical.

So. although a number or
doves made the ballot almost
automatically, the directors de»
cided that there might not be
enough involved radicals, As an
answer they added Fred Hal-
stad, who is running for Presi-
dent from the Socialist Worker.
Pany on a plattorm of black
power and immediate with-
drawal from Vietnam.

One of liarris’ answers to rad»
lcals is that “tworand-arhalt
million Americans ought lo be
able to have some impact on
the policy or the country." That,
then, is the key question about
Choice ’58: will it have any im-
pact on American policy and on
the election? If it doesn't (and
it has so far been ignored at
least by most of the press),
then radicals will have addition-
al prooi at their view that stu-
dents must take direct action
to inﬂuence policy.
