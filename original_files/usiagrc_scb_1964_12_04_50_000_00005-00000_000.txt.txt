Sthwengel Calls for
Moderation in GOP

Republican Congressman Fred
Schwengel (Iowa, ﬁrst dist.) told
an audience here Wednesday night
that “the only way out at the Re-
publican dilemma Is to accept the
creed of moderation."

Speaking in Roberts Theatre as a
guest of the campus Young Repub-
licans, Schwengel said that "the
moderates did not get organized
and center on a candidate for the
Republican national convention last
summer at San Francisco They
were not sufficiently concerned I
hope they have learned their les<
son."

Schwengel was narrowly defeat-
ed In the Nov. 3 election as he
sought his sixth term in Congress
Democrats, behind Gov. Harold E.
Hughes, generally swept the state
of Iowa in that election

. Continuing his stand tor moder-
ation, Schwengel said, “We eam-
, estly believe and give to concemed
people the asurance that modera-
tion is best because it is a spirit
that does not press advantage too
far — it is an attitude that seeks
to understand and will respect the
inﬂuences that drive people to ex-
tremes — it is a reeling that senses
a need for a unity of all people -—
it is arspirit that recognizes the
common fate and aspirations of
human beings with a faith in the
sacredness of man"
