Concerning Senate ‘Change . . .

One of the basic policies endorsed by the newly-elected
SGA president is.that of structural change within the Senate.
The idea of electing part of the Senate body from student
elections at large is directed at getting more interested and
competent people in Senate seats.

There has been increased dissatisfaction among student
leaders this year concerning the apathy of many senators.
The present speaker has laid most of the blame at the door
of south campus. In the 5&3 last fall he stated that the women
senators were uninformed, inactive, and too severely restrict-
ed by their halls. ‘

If the focus of senate problems is on south campus, we
would suggest that reform he done iii this area rather than
on a campus wide basis. The problem should be attacked di-
rectly rather than by an indirect route which would only

a-create more problems.

Dividing the senate into two factions consisting of hall
representation, as it is now, and of a group elected at large
would only tend to decentralize the method and purpose
of the senate action. Likewise, electing senators at large on
a campus wide basis would create a group of junio ' presidents
of SGA if campaign methods remain as they have in the past.

Tile maiii concern is with the women senators. This is
the problem that should be solved.

The lnaiii weakness in the south campus senate system

is the conditions under which the senators are chosen. House
council elections are held at the beginning of each‘year.
The women change their residences every year, so that the
-indiVidual communities electing their representative have
a constant population flux. At the beginning of the year,
many of the people don’t know each other’s names, let alone
their interests and abilities Senate elections often result in
popularity contests or simple elimination events. A girl really
Interested in senate work might be defeated because she has
no backing, while a less competent member is elected because
the group is generally aware that she has served as senator
before.
' We would propose that women senators should be
elected in the spring, when hallmates are aware of their in-
terests and abilities. While campaigns and voting should be
limited to individual halls, the representation would be shift~
ed around after room drawings. In a sense, the south campus
senate representation would be elected at home, but would be
lervmg at large.

Freshmen senators remain a problem because they must
represent their halls, but the circumstances surrounding their
election are completely inadequate. If the dorms are inte-
grated, however, there would be no longer a need for fresh-

en women to serve as senators, for each hall would still
have the chance for representation.

It would seem that representing each individual hall on
south campus is not nearly as important, under the shifting
living conditions, as adequate and competent representation
of the women students as a whole. Therefore, we see an im-

mediate need for revising the manner in which women sena-

tors are chosen.

Letters to the Editor
Students Want To Know What The Grinnell Image Is

To the Editor:

Question: Is the Grinnell
education considered excep-
tional by graduate and other
undergraduate institutions?
This ”question was assaulted

in a discussion we had with an
interested and informed facul-
ty»administration member, to
whom we are grateful for his
sincerity and help. We feel,
however, that some questions
remain that must be answered
if Grinnell College is to be hon-
est with itself and with the for-
times of its student members.
These questions relate to the
student’s image of Grinnell as
perpetuated by the administra-
tion and perpetuated by him-
self.

”As a private college of
high standing Grinnell. . .3’

“As a high-quality college
it (Grinnell) has distinctive
characteristics which are
especially conducive to the
education of gifted young
people.” .

“Selection makes possible
high academic standards and
keen academic competition,"
(From College Bulletin l963~
1964)

This is the college we think
we are attending. Is this the
college the graduate schools
think we are attending?

 

How high is Grinnell ranked
and by whom?

What is the significance and
eifect of this rank?

Are the demands of Grinnell
more rigorous than, for exam»
ple,’those of Coe, Riporl, Cor-
nell, Beloit, I. S. ll, S. U. 1.?

Would Grinnell students get
better grades at other schools?

How do Grinnell graduates
fare in competition for gradu-
ate admission with students
from the above schools: Does
a 2.8 from Grinnell allow you
actively to compete with 3 M]
from “lower ranked" schools?

Are the grades given at Grin-
nell commensurate with an ed-
ucational program "designed
especially for students of sur
perior ability and talent?"

How do Grinnell graduates
perform in graduate school
compared with graduates from
other schools?

How does Grinnell measure
these various ratings, quantita-
tively?

Finally, how can Grinnell stu-
dents, faculty, and administrar
tion work together to raise the
rank and reputation of their col-
lege?

We would suggest that a
place to begin would be with
quantitative answers to the
above questions. We believe

Miscellany and Digression

Those people who showed an
interest in the column which
dealt with the interim session
may also be interested to learn
that others Who are in no way
connected with the College have
shown an interest in that col-
umn. In a sense, one might say
that. the preceding sentence was
an interesting sentence.

To get back to the subject,
which by the way is non-exist<
ent this week, Hollywood is
bidding for the’rights to that
column. The word is that they
want to turn it into a musical-
comedy western medical spec-
tacular.

Their latest telegram deals
Wim their efforts to line up "a
cast of thousands for the big-
gest extravaganza since The
Great Train Robbery.” They
are communicating with Sena-
tor Barry Goldwater to play the
part of Josiah Bushnell Grina
nell. There is no final decision
yet since Goldwater's latest
message has not arrived due to
adverse weather conditions
which have delayed his pony
express rider.

Tuesday Weld, in what would
be by far her most challenging
role to date, is scheduled to
play the New English Diction-
ary of Historical Principles.
Pat Boone and Bert Parks will
play the tyrannical administra-
tion, While Lon Chaney Jr. and
Slim Pickens will play the ID-
phisticated and intellectual
student body. The invisible man
will make a brief appearance
as the head of the administra-
tion.

The script writers buys found

 

that they will have to take
some liberties with the events
in order to make a good mo-
tion plclut‘gvTa make the story
more believable they have al-
ready had to invent some in
telligent dialogue for the stu-
dent body.

The movie will feature two of
Hollywood's hottest stars, Hor-
ace Heidt and his brother
Faren. Presently, the pictuFe ls
expected to he of normal length
for a spectacular. The produo
ers have promised along inter-
mission on Wednesdays.

To simulate Grinnell’s atmos»
phenc conditions, the movie
Will be shot at a United States
Government wind tunnel. Set
designer, Gene Yus, has said he
has been unable to find any
trees with brass nameplate: in
them.

The movie may not be able
to receive approval (mm the
motion picture code authority.
Censors‘ are particularly Con.
cerned with the realistic por-
trayal of the brutal scenes of
the post office when grades are
being distributed.

All in all, the movie should
be one of the surprising rea
leases of the future. College of-
liciuls have promised the stu-
dios all the help which the stu-
dios might need. Right now the
college has their IBM machines
Working full time to select the
average personality traits of
the average Grinnell man and
woman. This information will
prove extremely valuable in the
scene where it is shown that
Grinnell students are treated
in indiyiduals rather than num-
berlc

 

that this college is one of the
finest institutions of highel’
learning in the country. How-
ever, we want to be reassured
with data, data which once re-
corded can be actively used by
the College to enhance its repu<
tatan; and specifically, to bet-
ter the bargaining position or
Grinnell st u d e n t s pursuing
graduate school admission.

‘l'llicit' Press Item
To the Editor:

The recent rhetorical oul-
pourings of that celebrated
Federalist, Publius, reminded
me somewhat of a sample of
illicit press sent lo me by a
friend at Colorado College. I
am submitting it to the see,
not so much to show Publlus
that nonrsanctioned publica-
tions can be well typed, as to
provide a model for future Pub-
lii to use. It should make their
unsigned treatises more inter-
esting, if less crude.

Jay Williams
Dear Al,

Since you have inquired as to
how 1 am achieving CC’s final so-
lulion to the student problem.

First, the student body must be
subjected to a lot of silly regula-
tions. At cc, of course, we have
rcaliled the difference between
boys and girls, and have therefore
established different regulations
for each. Once each week we make
every male student, in his broun
shirt and green BVD’s, strut
around with a useless stick which
he is laid is the ultimate weapon
in modern \varlare. We do better
with the girls; we give them 24
hour protection. By day we check
their dress, and by night we check
their address.

This unthinking submission
makes it easier lo apply control on
more important matters. We look
the girls up as much as possible.
After 211, boys will be boys, and if
we don't do something about ii,
girls will be mothers. We can
exert this control only because no
force all the girls in live on camp-
us.

Over the years i have found that
student reaction is best overcome
by giving the students useless
tasks which they feel are impor.
tant. Among those front ol'ganua-
tions, a puppet student government
is a must. “Student leaders” must
be elected democratically as role
ing is the American Way. or
course, students must be encour-
aged to establish committees on
administrative matters. Never fear,
this policy is foolproof, for if these
committee ever do anything, you
can easily dissolve them.

it is good to cultivate the solid,
conventional members of the cam-
pus community to serve as your
stooges. Just provide them with
plenty of status — that’s all it
takes. They believe in “freedom
with responsibility” (use that
phrase, it’s catchy!) and as they
have no responsibility, they ask
for no freedom. The students will
want publications. Unfortunately,
freedom of the press is the Amer'
can Way. However. subtle pres-
sure on the editors can achieve
your ends. At all costs, never cen-
501' any publication. it one offend:
you, abolish it. Any illicit publica-
tion must be mihlessly squashed
before the seeds of dissension an
sown. ,
sincerely.
