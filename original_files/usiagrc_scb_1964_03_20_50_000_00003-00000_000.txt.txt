Ashmon Slashes Ford Letter.
Pueslions Editorial Censorship

To the Editor:

When the new editorial staff
took office this semester, the
Student body was led to be-
lieve that the editors would ex-
ercise good judgment in select-
ing representative but respon-
sible letters for publication, In
at least one particular In—
stance, the staff has failed to
live up to its promise.

I am referring to a letter
written by Dan Friedlander
criticizing the administration. I
do not deny 'that on a great

Letter Intimates
Daniel Was Faced
With Something?

To the Editor:

“Daniel Prince" of the House
of Woe has just succumbed to
the hideous laughter of the
masses and has died in the

lion's den. The theater-goers
and party-goers have found few
difficulties in toiling his at-
tempt to crash them, and have
now returned for the next act,
only to come back again to
live in their “real" world. Dan<
iel has been dragged into his
dream by the disgusting put—
on intimacy of that lovely
woman of the theater, Annette
duBois. . . dragged onto the
muddy track where he couldn't
see or attain the finality he
thought was in view, He was
trapped with no direction, with
no sympathy, with no love; in
fact, the venerable one who he
thought was his sympathizer,
the one man who had been
able to overcome the world of
triviallty, had tried, only to
be forced into solitary horror.
Bravo, bravo, we shall all be
signed to an unlimited con»
tract, from where we are to
where we are going. And thus,
it was only fitting that naive
Madelaine Sotisse should ab-
sentrmindly push Danny from
his last foothold. from aca-
demia into. . .

many issues the administration
deserve criticism. Dan’s letter
went far beyond the bounds of
criticism It was an overly
emotional, overly sarcastic
collection of lies and nasty
insinuations. At no time did
Dan support his accusations,
did he even attempt to justify
his position to either the admin-
istration or the student body.
Surely, what he says isn't as
obvious as he seems to imply.
I, for one, fail to see that his
arguments (I use this term for
want of a more appropriate
one) have any grounds whatso-
ever.

Apparently Dan isn't aware
that the SKtB is circulated
among parents, alumni, trus~
tees, and the people who make
grants to the college. Such un-
supported accusations as Dan
makes concerning the use of
money, etc. can not help but
create doubt in the minds of
these individuals. This certain—
1y wouldn’t help the college or
the students.

Knowing Dan, I can well see
how he may have been tempted
to write such a letter, but I
Cannot possibly see how the
5&3 editors could have pub-
lished it without requesting the
writer to make certain modifi-
cations, This is not living up
to editorial responsibility.

Following Is the text of Dr.
Bowen's convocation address
given before the Grinnell
student body last Saturday
morning after the announce-
ment had been made that he
would take the position of
president at the State Univer-
sity of Iowa.

I had intended this to be in
the form of an announcement
which I would make to you in
person prior to the public an-
nouncement, The timing of the
public announcement was,
h c we ve r, unexpectedly ad-
vanced, and so the news came
to you by radio, newspaper,
and grapevine,

The first thing I want you to
know is that Mrs. Bowen and I
have a deep sense of regret at
leaving Grinnell. This college
has a way of drawing people
very close to it and of foster-
ing friendships of great value.
I know that you all realize this,
but you will realize it even
more as your time to leave ap—
proaches. Our relations with
the faculty, trustees, and alum<
ni have been and continue to
be most cordial and friendly,
and we have always had a spec-
ial interest and affection for
Grinnell students. This college
attracts a special breed of stu<
dents who are earnest. hard-

 

 

Brown Thanks Robertson for Clarifying
Effect of Gravity on Blood Circulation

To the Editor:

I heartily thank Dr. Rob
ertson for the interest in Yoga
that his letter showed, and,
more importantly, for not let-

ting a mistaken assumption
slip by. I was personally mis-
informed about the role grav-
ity plays in the circulation of
the blood, and this led to some
incorrect conclusion on my
part. I am grateful to Dr. Rob-
ertson for straightening me
out.

It is all too easy to be mis-
informed nbout the exact bene-
fits of specific Hatha Yoga asa-
nas or postures. This is pri-
marily because there is a very
limited scientific knowledge or
understanding of why the Yoga
system is biologically as effec-

tive as it is. I never suffered
under the delusion that the
heart receives a rest in the
headstand position, however,
Yoga is a system of Controlled
exercise, and most of the pos-
tures cause various kinds of
definite stresses on the body
in one way or another. This
is the basis for all purposeful
physical developmentimeas-
ured stress.

Regardless of what is said
about Yoga as a religious,
psychological discipline, Hat<
ha Yoga remains the only com-
plete physical culture system
which offers a concrete path
towards conscious mastery of
the body and its functions, This
is not a Claim, but. a fact with
a 3000 year history.

To Participate Fully

To the students of Grinnell:

ment of Mock Political conven-
tions across the country with
considerable interest and sans
faction.

It Will be Wonderful to be
with you for the beginning of
your convention. Our San Fran
cisco delegates can learn much
from what is discussed by you
and your colleagues,

And so it is with die hope you
will enter fully into the spirit
of realism and apply your best
efforts to what is done that I
come to Grinnell as a member
of a party that has great po-
tential to draw upon for its

I am grateful for the oppor-

of these activities and men-l0!u

working, interested in ideas,
and curious,

Grinnell students are {men
getic almost to a fault and col—
lectively they carry on a pro-
gram of activities in discus-
sion, sports, music, drama,
art, student government, jour-
nalism, etc, that is almost un-
paralleled in American educa-
tion. They are incorrigible
idealists. Grinnell students are
interested in the college and
they spend endless hours dis-
cussing it, criticizing it, and re-
forming it. They help make a
lively Campus life where there
is education of the highest or-
der not only in academic pur-
suits, but also in personal char-
acter, human relationships, and
general culture. This is not to
say that you are all/perfect or
that Grinnell could not be im-
proved, But it does suggest
why Mrs. Bowen and I have
enjoyed working and associat-
ing with you, and it also sug~
gests that our leaving is not
due to any negative factor here.
Everyone has been kind, gen-
erous, and tolerant of us, and
we are deeply appreciative.

Looking ahead, I think that
Grinnell has a brilliant future.
It is recognized today through-
out the educational world as
one of the most distinguished
liberal arts colleges of the
United States, You are well
aware of that. But I think there
are many important accom-
plishments ahead, I hops and
expect we shall be able to
carry forward our plans in the
education of Negroes. When I
was in India, and Mr. Barna-
bas here, preliminary arrange-
ments were made for close and
continuing collaboration be.-
tween Ahmednagar College and
Grinnell. In both of these pro-
jects, student participation will
be very important.

Regarding buildings, progress
is still being made. The Forum
Should be ready for use next
fall, and the trustees have just
given the go-ahead on construc-
tion of another science build
ing. Groundbreaking should
occur this summer and the
building should be occupied in
1965. The trustees have also

approved serious study of the
proposal to increase dormitory
space, partly to increase space
for current student body and
partly to achieve a modest in-
crease in enrollment. The tac-
ulty is being further strength-
ened by the appointment of a
few new members this year,
and it will continue to be one
of the outstanding faculties in
the United States.

I look forward also to furth<
er progress in the curriculum.
We have perhaps a problem in
the area of student affairs, but
I believe we have achieved a
period of calm, objectivity, and
good will in which these mat-
ters can be worked out, in a
way that will be reasonable for
students and for the welfare of
the college.

The trustees will be looking
(or a new president without
delay, A group of them will be
meeting on Monday to begin
the selection process, and there
is no doubt of their ability to
make a wise decision, Their
job will be eased by the fact
that the presidency of Grinnell
is a very attractive position,
for the very reasons that it has
been a pleasant one for me and
one that I sincerely regret
leaving. The situation is also
strengthened by the fact that
the college is fortunate to have
a corps of exceptionally able
administrative personnel to
support the new president, .

Having told you how much I
regret leaving Grinnell and
how good Grinnell is, you may
well ask: “Why then are you
leaving?" Without attempting to
plumb the depths of subrcon-
scious motivation, I shall try
to give you the reasons. First,
I should point out that I did not
in any way seek the new posi-
tion, and the fact that I was
under consideration came as a
great surprise to me. The State
University of Iowa is an out;
standing university, with many
areas of distinction. It is per-
haps among the top dozen or so
universities in the United
States. It has the capacity for
