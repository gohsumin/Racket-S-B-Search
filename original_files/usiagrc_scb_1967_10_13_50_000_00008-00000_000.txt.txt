GRAY MATTER

in nu. GRAY

There is something innately unfair about forcing athletes of
he genre to play athletes who are schooled in another sport. There
r5 also something innately llnfair about making girls play boys
in a game which is built around speed. Be that as it may, one
can hardly say that the two handicaps balance out, besides, any
one with any sense knows better than to bet against the girls‘ tield
hockey team. The game of field hockey is played on a large red
tangular field with goals at either end. One wouldn't have known
this, though, if the ﬁrst game watched turned out to be the cone
test between the girls and the boys' soccer team because the pre-
dominance of action was centered around the beleaguered goal of
the woefully outmanned (outgirled?) soccer team, The only thing
I can say to the girls is to repeat the traditional cry of the over<
,whelmed opposition: “Pick on somebody your own size (shape?)."
It has six starters over 6'3", it has three starters that weigh
over 220 pounds. Who is it? Why, it is the Langan football team
that brought glory to its hall by winning a football game this year.
It is also the team that has violated the Cardinal rule of l. M.'s by
forfeiting two of its games. While we must appreciate their con-
oern that they might get hurt (i’), we must deplore their lack of
competitive spirit which is the heart of l. M. sports.

The l. M. season is now almost over and the championship has
boiled clown to a battle between Dibble and Smith. This Showdown
will occur Sunday at 3:00 on the Soccer Field with the annual
none: Bowl.

THE WILL TO WIN . . .

' Grinnell lost its third football
ame of the season, 47-7, at tho
ands of the Ripon Redmen.

The Pioneers on the field and

in the stands are undoubtedly

upset by the results of the first
three Grimiell contests.

But let’s remember that Grin—
nell faced, in its first three
games, the three toughest teams
in the Midwest Conference. Tn-
morrow’s game pits the Plo-

HARRIERS
OllT AGAIN

Gl'inncll's cross country team
will be trying to bounce back
from a disappointing perform-
ance at its own Les Duke In.
Vitational when it hosts Knox
ill a Midwest Conference dual
Saturday.

The Pioneers finished eighth
in the 13-team field at the ln-
yitational last Saturday, and
had only one runner place

among the top in individual
finishers. Doug Dray was 18th.

The Pioneers also lost to
Carleton 16-46, and the Univer-
sity of Chicago, 27-23, in dual
meets tabulated from the in‘
dividual placing in the invita<
tional. They were losses num-
ber four and five against one
Wm.

“Despite our disappointing
record, we are making steady
progress." said Coach Ray
Oben'niller. “But, we haven‘t
been able to come up with a
really outstanding team effort
yet. In every meet. one or two
boys have performed below
par, and this has cost us at
least two victories. Hopefully,
we are saving that one out‘
standing team perfonnance for
the conference meet."

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN on

Do you play bridge just to get good hands? If you do the odds
are stacked against you. Take for example the following hypotheti-
cal situation: you are dealer and you deal yourself a hand without
looking at it. What are the. odds for getting a good hand?

One hand in four will be good enough for an opening bid (thir.
teen or more high card points). Of the other three, two hands wrli
fall between seven and twelve points, and the remaining hand in
four will have six or less points.

of your opening hands, only three iii eight will have sixteen or
more points; which is about one hand out of every ten that you
get. it you play Goren (strong) two—bids, only one hand in one
hundred and twenty-five will have the necessary twenty-one or
more high card points necessary to open that bid.

Well then, you play bridge to get distributional hands. Under
those circumstances you’re just about as bad off. one hand in three.
you Won’t have a five-card suit. Thirteen hands ill twenty Won't
have a singleton or void, where only one hand in twenty-five will
have a void. ‘i‘llree hands out of eight will have a two biddable
suits; and only one hand in seven Will have ten or more cards in
two suits. One hand in mirty»three will have at least a seven card
suit.

But all these odds are based upon it perieetly random deal
which. of course, you say. is impossible. That’s true, but a deck
is inclined to run “stale" or “cold" rather than “warm”. The
manner in which cards are played in tricks, placed together and
“insufficiently shuffled" inhibits the possibility of random deals.
To solve that situation, you can try playing a couple hands of soll<
taire, or dealing “goulash,” Le. dealing five to each player, five
again and then three. Generally speaking, though, the bridge
player is condemned to eat his staple of average hands, which
brings up a good point. Contract bridge is a game of mileage, The
better you do with the cards you get, the more miles to the gallon
in your game. Every bridge player over the long run will get about
ten points per hand, but some bridge players will score more
points.
