torial written by Jim Hat-

reevaluated with an eye to

Srinnell College President

assed so many alumni and
stees read the paper, but he
nd out. Donors and other
ands of the college unloaded
1r wrath upon him wherever
went.
'resident Bowen told the stu-
1ts to settle down and con-
er the overall aspects of
ir Community, and they
n t; so, he formed a faculty
nrnitiee.
he committee studied rules,
iound they were a good
ng—so good in fact that they
engthened a few. President
wen invited “student lead-
lo attend a meeting and
’cuss the group’s study. By
s time “radical" leaders,
ck Chapman, Marie Martin,
d Peter Cohan, had been
*cted by sizeable majorities,
d they were unwilling to ac-
t the report or the reasoning
ich went with it.
fter the student leaders had
-n consulted, the committee
.nged the preliminary re-
rt. It added the sentence:
he Council. . . has held two
gthy sessions with student
ders.’
his report vindicated the
sent rules. Penalties for rule
ractions were, in fact. stif-
ed. Men's open lounges were
‘s open. Breakiasting at the
ad was ended for men. Sen-

esident Bowen sent the com-
ttee report to parents and to

ed the report but the students

ort, President Bowen pre-
ted it to the students at a
y, 1963, convocation — first

He also mollified the students
by revising the report, with-
drawing the proposed punish-
ments and promising to bring
the drinking rule change to the
trustees. . . And on that com-
promising, arrow-in-theloack
note the year ended.

Under sunny fall skies the
student government continued
to talk about rule change, but
no one could hear them—from
the golf course. Then at (the
Ceremonial Boar's Head Christ-
mas dinner the students said
their own special good—bye to
rule change.

That dinner irritated the fac-
ulty which had previously as-
sumed a dormant attitude to-
wards student affairs, and ev-
eryone started talking about
attitude problems — and rule
change was forgotten.

The three SGA President Can-
didates decided the problem
with Grinnell was student gov-
ernment attitude and as to
rules promised to be passive
until fired upon. . . And so end-
ed the students’ threat to Ford,
God, and Midwest morality.

Faculty Invited To
Expose Opinions in
New Chapel Series

Members of the Grinnell EEC-
ulty and administration will air
their views of Grinnell life and
will attempt to Clarify the 001-
lege’s ideas of the ends and
means of a liberal arts educa»
tion in the Faculty Chapel se-
ries which began today.

The program, which this
week featured Joseph D. Dan-
forth (chem.) and William A.
Roecker (German), is held in
Herrick Chapel Friday mom-
ings at II.

“We hope the students will
not feel that we are running
the topic into the ground," said
Ann Klein, chairman of the
Church and Chapel Committee,
which is planning the series.

She continued, saying that,
though students and “faculty
have both discussed the topic
in one guise or another, her
committee felt that short talks
by Faculty and administration
could give a whole new slant
and open a new area of investi-
gation.

The goal of the series is to
deepen, strengthen, and ad-
vance the current discussion of
student behavior and student-
faculty relations by means of
a series of talks about the ulti-
mate goals of liberal arts edu-
cation,

 

Pogo Three

56A Convention — Routine Circus

By Cynthia Brunt

“Sex is Sick," blnred a Cleve-
land hall sign, carried by a vir-
tuous maiden in white. “Sup
port Open-open Cells." retort-
ed the sign of a white-sheeted
Mean hall nun. “Every day
will be Skip-day," promised
“Saga‘s Favorite Son." Roman
senators played bridge with
girls in pajamas. It was that
day again; Grinnell students
were nominating the candidates
for its highest student govern-
ment office.

There was serious business at
hand, but not before the 273
delegates had played the con-
vention game to its hilt. it’s an
unwritten law at Grinnell that
nothing serious be done until
the evening session, and this
year’s delegates were not about
to break this rule, at leastl For
three wild hours, a Weird mix-
ture of convention routine and
circus Side-Show filled Darby
gym with brass bands, parades,
and wild laughter.

With costumes and posters to
decorate the court, the Pun
reigned as king of the events,
with Parody as his queen.
Campus problems, world af-
fairs, and the Beatles provided
inspiration for the jag candi~
dates and their speeches, as
well as for the jag ballots of
the delegates.

"Saga‘Skip" Weyrauch was
the first candidate to be offi-
cially nominated. Mike Ml-
nard's nomination speech in
cluded Skip’s platform, “Every-
thing eats," and his promise of
unlimited second helpings. Skip
himself made a triumphant ap-
pearance from the depths of a
“birthday Cake" for George

Washington, after Larry Hultr.

gren and Tom Wenner seconded
his nomination, revealing SAGA
as the Society for Acceptable
Government Administrations,
James hall members, With
little-girl bows in their hair, fol-
lowed Clark hall men in wait
er‘s jackets as Skip’s support-
ers walked, jumped rope, and
skipped around the gym. Add-
ed attractions included the
famous Boar’s Head and a

- “Skip 3 head" on platters, and

trays of Cookies for the dele-
gates.

“Hallelujah Hannah," this
year’s second jag candidate,
soon got her chance. Cleve-
land's delegation of “fallen"
women and/“saved" maidens
lustily cheered as Georgia Mic-
key recited several of the 69
varieties of Galloping Puritan-
ism, the ideological basis of
Lynne Simcox’s campaign.

Lloyd Fritlmeier, Grinnell’s
answer to Ringo Starr, second-
ed Hannah's nomination with
an impassioned plea for camp-
us chastity and discretion. He

extolled the virtue: of one
campus co-ed who achieved
fame with her skill as an‘
bldexteroul lechergetter," and
advocated changing the design
of the Student Forum to a cir-
cle—to remove the possibility
of necking in the corners. Louie
Pearce, one of the Cleveland
girls, “saved" by Hannah’s
preaching, came forth to attest
to the changes her conversion
to Galloping Puritanism had
caused in her life.

The .instructed ballot, a tra-
ditional mixture of wit and
double meanings, proceeded as
smoothly as is expected. Halls
with “favorite son" candidates
cast all votes for their own
“Scurvy Orvie” received many
votes in fond memory of last
year’s rollicking campaign to

popularize lechery as a camp—

_dedicated four of its votes to
the proposition of g o t t l n g
Scurvy together with Hallelujah
Hannah. [A3053 hall—in tradi-
tiomal black as the Know- Noth-
ing Party (more often appear-
ing as “No, Nothing“)—joined
Dibble men in casting votes for
Tom Wenner, “the true presi-
dent of the senior class."
French House cast its first
ballot for Charles de Gaulle.
Haines hall, as the Social Plan-
ning Party, cast votes for Scur-
vy Orvie for his “honesty in
perversion," and one for tho
