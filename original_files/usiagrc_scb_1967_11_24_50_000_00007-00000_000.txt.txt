Animal Behavior is more than
the name of a column in the
oldest college newspaper east
of Rock Creek Lake. some
psychologists are concerned
with understanding the physio-
logical events that underlie be
havior.

billion. The money presently
going to health, Education and
Welfare, he cited, only one
tenth of the military expenses,
§8.6 billion. At least $31 billion
of the military expense, he
said, was going to the war in
Vietnam.

This amount of money "could
provide all the state needs, in—
stea ," Hoover said. it could
also replace one million hous-
ing units, Think oi the jobs oi
those in the military, tor this
(employment), instead.”

Hoover ielt that the Republi-
cans must "push (or a new
lace, unite the factions," and
rally support so that neither
Johnson nor a prowar Repulr
iican is elected in 1968.

William Plymat, object of a
"Draft Plymat for Senate Draft
Committee" campaign, also ad-
dressed the group. An insur-
ance executive by occupation,
Plymat said that he has been
active in the Civil Rights move«
ment, and has also helped in
the iormation at a bill keeping
gambling and alcohol out of
Iowa.

He later added that even a
major number of hawkish
preachers might vote for him
because of his ‘gambling—booze'
issue.

Although the major empha-
sis is, of course, on the ap-
proaching presidential election
in 1968, Plymat said that “we
must not lose all interest in the
senatorial races. The only pre-
occupation now seems to be
with the Presidency. it is as
though we are electing a [our-
year dictator."

Asked about his prospective
candidacy, Plymat said: “1
ieel like taking a reading or
this group — would you sup-
port me? I am not anxious to
do it (run for Senator) unless
in my careful judgment it is
wonh it. . . . It would not be
good for the peace movement
(it I would just) divert votes
born the other two (candi-
dates)."

Plymat stated the opinions
oi some toward his running as
merely to “divide the anti-
iiichenlooper (present Senator)
iorces." He said that, if he did
run “there would be no pussy-
tooting around about it."

The GSM Committee to end
the war in Vietnam made an
announcement near adjourn-
ment time concerning fund-rais-
ing tor twn California scientist:
researching white corpuscles. In
other words, injected one of the
Council members. ”It’s good
tor the image. We‘re not just
against, but {or something."

An analysis of relationships
between what goes on inside an
animal and what we see him
do may help to clarify our
knowledge of the variables con—
trolling behavior. George Zim<
mar (Psychology) is presently
doing research in this area.
Aversive (“painful") stlmu~
lation produces emotional be-
havior in men and other organ-
isms. One theory oi emotion
holds that some structures in
the brain (primarily those in

SCARLET AND BLACK

the limbic system and olfactory
brain) are involved in mediating
emotional behavior and learn
ing. Some stnictures inhibit
these types of responses, others
facilitate them. Zimmal‘ is pl'i<
marily interested in electrically
and chemically Stimulating the
brain and observing changes
produced in learned emotional
behavior.

Acetylcholine, a chemical
iound at nerve synapses, also
serves as a transmitter Sub-
stance in the brain itself. What
will happen to learned emotional
behavior ii the “emotional”
structures are Stimulated with
acetylcholine?

Memory traces are thought
to be changes in the nervous

system associated with learning.
In some cases, acetylcholine
may facilitate the formation of
these memory traces, in other
structures acetylcholine inhibits
memory traces. Facilitation and
inhibition are iniel‘l’ed through
observable changes in learned
emotional behavior Sll'lCe recent
research in men and other
animals indicates that StruC<
tures mediating emotion and
memory are closely related.
Zilnmal"s procedure will enable
him to evaluate the efiect of
acetylcholine on the “short-term
memory” that may be involved
in this sort of behavior.
Research at a small liberal
arts college, says Zimmar, has
some limitations. The iacilities

are good, the students oiten
inspiring but Zimmar {eels the
lack of what he terms “pres
iessional consultation".

it he were, for example, to
study the effects of early brain
damage on primates (apes or
monkeys). Zimmar would need
to consult with other profes-
sionals about diseases in the
colony, brain histology (tissue
structure) and other problems
involved in doing research oi
this type.

At a large university, vetet‘.
inarians, histologists and tech-
nicians are readily available.
Nevertheless, Zimmar [eels the
importance of teaching students
outweighs the disadvantages of
research at Grinnelli
