C of HP Election No Mandate

By Steve Shender

In splle of the desolate cries
of despair raised by campus
liberals that the recent CDfHF
election has proved beyond a
doubt the immutably conserva-
tive nature oi North Campus,
there ls much in the Campaign
and the election to suggest
quite the contrary. when one
considers that Theo Le Maire,
a relative unknown, came Wilh-
in 28 votes or heating a for-
mldable opponent who had had
long experience on the West
Norris House Council and myr-
iad contacts with students all
over North Campus, then it at
onoe appears that grounds for
liberal optimism are not unjus-
tified. Last Week’s CanP elec-
tion was not a mandate for
conservatism on North Campus.
Indeed. if anyihing, it evidenced
a nearly even split among the
men o1 North Campus; liberal-
ism on North Campus is any—
thing but a dead horse.

The new COEHP president will
have to take lilis Obvious schism
into account in the coming year.
He will be unable to pursue
Ii path totally to his own lik<

would risk losing the support
or nearly half or his constie
uents, thus undermining his
position vis-a-vis the adminis—
tration. Nor, even if he sud-
denly became so inclined, would
he be able to tread in Mr, Lo
Maire’s liberal path, for again
he would prejudice his position
in the eyes at the other hail
of his consntuency,

Clearly. the new Coil-1P pres-
ident must carelully tread a
middle path; he must play the
role or a masler politician. This
will be no easy task; it re-
quires a great deal or political
virtue — tact, cunning, ﬂexibil»
lty — a willingness to devote
many hours a week to the tasks
or explaining, negotiating, pla-
cating, and so on. The awesome-

ness oi the task becomes even
more impressive when one cona
slders the Conn> President's
anomalous position between ad<
ministration, students, and other
student leaders, as he operates
within the context oi that po-
litical iniemo called son.

One must hope that the CDin"
presidentrelect will take all
of this into consideration as he
prepares to take olﬁce after
vacation. As for the defeated.
but undaunted Mr. Le Maire,
one can only commend him on

his fervent desire to be of serw
ice to the campus, and hops
that this narrow electoral up<
set will not discourage him
irom continued active partici-
pation in campus affairs.

The play is a spoof on every-
