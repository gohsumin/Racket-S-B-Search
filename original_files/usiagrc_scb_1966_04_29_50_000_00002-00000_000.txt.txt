Editorial

Grass Protest

“How far shall we carry this demonstration? I
mean are we going to sit here all night and stop eat-
ing, too?”

From a Civil Rights sit-in in Selma? From a free
speech protest at Berkeley? From a demonstration for
academic freedom at St. Johns? No, quite uncharac-
teristically this question of strategy was posed here on
our own sometimes sun-lit campus.

The cause of the protest? Asphalt blight. Or as
Millard Sheets would have described it, a lack of “cul-
tural integrity.” More simply the cause of the demone
stration was the start of construction of a new parking
lot. The proposed sight for this conflict-producing new
parking lot is just east of the already existing Burling
parking lot.

Yesterday a handful of hard core demonstrators
(already someone has suggested that they are being
manipulated by outside forces) sat on the Stump of a
now defunct elm tree and prevented construction
workers from proceeding with their work.

At the same time the demonstrations outside
were taking place a small cadre of well-trained ex-
perts (some have suggested the training took place
on a nameless Latin American island country) were
conducting negotiations with the administration.

Officially the college is taking the position that
the demonstrators can do anything they want to make
their point except slow up work on the parking lot.
Unofficially they are saying that nothing must he done
to slow-up Grinnell’s entrance into the parking lot
race.

"We have a parking lot gap and we know it,” said
one official who wanted his name withheld. “What are
we going to do, say, if Carleton or Oberlin or Antioch
gets ahead of us in parking lot space, How do you
think that’s going to affect the uncommitted high
school students?”

The demonstrators, meanwhile, were making
plans for camping at the construction site. “We aren't
trying to hurt the college‘s position with regard to the
uncommitted high school students,” said a spokesman
for the unusually clean~cut student group. “All we
want to do is preserve the grass. It’s a moral issue for
us and has nothing to do with intercollegiate rivalry.”

The demonstrators also speak of the cost of such
a program. “Do you know how many tulips you could
buy with the money they’re spending on the asphalt?”

At cocktail parties officials will confide 7 strict—
ly off the record if that they too don’t see the impor-
tance of narrowing the parking lot gap. They are quick
to add, however, that it would involve great loss of
face if we were to pull out at this late date. “We have
committed ourselves to being able to accommodate
just as much chrome as other schools. We can’t be con-
sidered a second rate power.”

The Grudge Pot

l lihally made the scene. I hadn't wanted in.
George said u great many amusing, fascinat—
ing, lively, important people would be there;
no I accepted the challenge of boredom and
drove through the quiet village streets to the
house on the little hill.

Mary took my coat at the door, and I never
law it again. I never saw Mary again, either,
although she was a nice girl. She had a slight
lisp which turned out to he leprosy, and on
some weekends Arthur or Morry pretend to
visit her at the sanitorlum. We all miss her
infectious lisp.

George introduced me in a stranger who
claimed that the world was to end in 90 days.
After he had had his vision of this event, he
decided not to shave till Doomsday, and the
stubble already made him look like a bum.

I sat in a comiortable chair in the corner of
a huge, empty room and waited for the inn
to begin. The roaring lire in [he screenedﬂﬂ
ﬁreplace was Cinders by the time a handsome
young man hobbled across the rug (in crutches.
and he paused in from of me.

Silently, i tried in ignore him, but he would
not leave. l pretended to awake from a nap
and glanced up and said. “Hello, who are you?
What happened to you?"

“I’m Fred,” he replied cheerfully. “I use
crutches to symbolize and dramatize the fact
that] am an embrinnul cripple. These crutches

represent the psychological disorders, and they
serve to demonstrate the need for understand-
ing and assistance that all of my type share."

“What would happen it I grabbed one or
those crutches and threw it HCNSS the room?"
I asked, my interest somewhat aroused.

"I would fall." he answered Immediately.
“But,“ he added, “someday I may lay them
aside of my own accord — or maybe I won't.
It all depends on the situation — if ii-wiil
have some world-wide effect, a dramatic sav-
ing gesture or something of that son,"

He slumped in the ﬂoor and crossed his legs.
seeming very depressed. “Why doesn’t some-
one else join the cause?" he asked Without
wanting a reply. “Damnahle sticks!” He
ﬂung the crutches toward the ﬁreplace.

“This is an age that lacks relevance," said
Constance Duggs, as she sneaked up and be
gan strangling poor Fred. '

“Gasp' Glul'pl Blah!” choked Fred. He
wrilhed on the floor like a dumb eel pulled out
of water, and his lace tumed while, then
purple. But Constance Doggs controlled him,
her long tenticlerlike fingers entwined about
his neck.

\Vhen Fred was dead, i asked. “Wily did you
do that. Constance Doggs?”

“This is an age that wants relevance," she
replied and commenced strangling me, while
Visions of eschatology, like sugarplums, danced
in my head,

Study Finds Protesters Primaril y
(unearned Wit/i Campus Problems

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Recent reports have indicated that across
the country, niimms on college students‘ Cull-
nary tastes have sparked almost as many
demonstrations as has discrimination in the
South, and that protests against the war in
Viei Nam have barely been more widespread
than those against dormitory regulations.

The Scope oi Organized Student Protest in
193445, published by Educational Testing
Service in Princeton. N.J,, has altered some
statistics on the subject. They are based on
the answers given by deans oi students at 849
oi the country's 1,000 tour-year colleges and
universities, The study Was Wriiiei‘i by Rich-
ard E. Peterson. an ETS associate research
psychologist,

Peterson based his results oil the examina-

letters.

(ion of 27 issues. He found that in all of the
issues, no more than eight per cent of the dif-
ferent student bodies were involved in protests.
The top PIOIESL figure was in response to (lor-
niuory rules. Second in line were complaints
about liquor rules,

or the 849 colleges questioned, 38 per cent
reported prolesls over civil rights, but these
demonstrations included only six per cent of
the students. Twenty-live per cent or me col<
ieges had undergone protests about loud, in-
VOlVing under 7 per Cent of the students. Less
than 5 per cent of the students at 21 per cent
or the colleges had demonstrated against lhe
war in Viet Nam. Twentyreigllt per cent or the
institutions reported protests in the South in the
summer of 1964, but only 4 per cent of the stu-
dents were engaged in Southem civil riglns
work. This is half as many siudenis as par-
iiClpaicd m quarrels over dormiroiy rules.

“Relatively iew smdenis were engaged in
protesting mailers dealing with insll‘uclion,
raculiy, and ireedom of expl‘essxon at lhe rein
lively iew colleges where such pmresrs were
in fact reported," says the Peterson slurly.
Seven per cent oi lhe colleges reported pru
tests on behalf oi academic freedom for pro-
iessors, and 4 per cent on rules regarding con—
troversial speakers.

Developments, published by the Educational
Testing Service, commented that the results
oi the study “make clear that the demise of
apathy has been exaggerated.” It also Said,
“At preseni, then, the much-vaunted strident
protest movement seems in be neither a sun-
rise nor a conflagration, but only a flickering
candle." However, Peterson himself says,
“There obviously are substantial numbers of
students Willing lo make known publicly [heir
antagonism lo existing situations 7 especially
those situations where [here is a perceived
moral contradiction or hypocrisy. And there is
every indication that the numbers or student
activists have been multiplying in the past
live years," He also says, “The Current surge
oi student unrest and active protest must cer-
laiiily be among the most significant develop-
menis in higher education, perhaps in Ameris
can soClety, oi the mid-19605."
