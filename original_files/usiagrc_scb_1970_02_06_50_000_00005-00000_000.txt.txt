LIBERAL EDUCATION

communication and discussion to
the mutual benefit of both par
ties, nor the possibility of error
on the part of the party who has
the right to decrde. In general,
then, if A and B differ in their
qualifications and enter into a
relation, decisions by A and by
B which are based on the dif-
ferences between A and B and
which are required in that
relation cannot be based on the
same kind of right. If all citizens
are given the same right to
decide without qualification,
there will be no distinction be-
tween a doctor and a patient, a
president and another citizen,
Order will give way to chaos, and
the state will cease to exist.
Exceptions to good decisions will
always exist as long as man is
not perfect; and mough the at-
tempt to approach perfection is
a virtue, the expectation of
reaching it or demanding it
betrays alack of realism. Human
affairs do not possess the per-
fection OI mathematics. One who
deals with human affairs must
expect some deviation.

Similar remarks apply to the
terms in the other contrarieties

and in general between a good
decrsions and a bad decision.
and to other such terms. Such
terms, then, cannot function as
clear principles of what is true,
good, or beautiful; for a principle
is by definition a starting point
or a criterion for judging, and
a bad beginning leads to a bad
result, An initial error of one
degree in direction by an airplane
leads to an increasing deviation
from the target.

clear and adequate definition of
a liberal education. A definition,
as stated earlier, is a principle,
and though a liberal education
is admitted to he important to
students entering colleges like
Grlnnell, there seems to be
something elusive about what
such education is. Some of the
problems facing colleges today
are due to the lack oi a clear
and explicit statement of what
they are supposed to do: to give
the students a liberal education,
of course, but what this is and
how it can be acquired, these are
the two main problems

5.5 per cent expected to drop out
temporarily during their college
career. This is somewhat above
the national average.

Almost 40 per cent of the class
grew up in the suburbs of a large
city. Only 22.9 per cent or the
national sample came from
suburbs. Grlnnell College has
only one third as many freshmen
who were raised on a farm as
the national sample One third
of the entering class lives over
one thousand miles away. Fewer
Grlnnell students come from
small or moderate si‘zed towns
47 per cent of the Grlnnell
students' fathers have
postgraduate degrees, and 27 per
cent have college degrees without
a post-graduate degree. These
two categories added together
equal nearly three times that oi
the national sample. The fathers
of 19 per cent of the Grinnell
students are either doctors,
dentists, or college teachers
compared to 3 per cent of the
national sample. Their families
are more affluent than average.
43 per cent of Grinnell‘s freshmen
estimated their parents’ yearly
income to be more than twenty
thousand dollars. The national
percentage was 14 per cent.
Another 38 per cent estimated
income between ten and twenty

The racial balance of the class:
92,5 per cent Caucasian, 4.5 per
cent Negro, 2.0 per cent Oriental,
1 per cent other. The racial
balance of the national sample:
89.8 per cent Caucasian, 8.3 per
cent Negro, 0.2 per cent
American indian, 0,3 per cent
Oriental, 0.8 per cent other, All
but 11 per cent of the freshmen
have some “religious
background," but41 per cent said
they had no religious preference
when the survey was taken last
September, 12 per cent of the
national sample listed no
religious preference.

A larger percentage of the
Grlnnell freshmen than of the
national sample thought the
followrng goals were important:
to achieve in a performing art,
to influence the political struc-
ture, to write original works, to
create Works of art. The Grinnell
freshmen were about average in
their opinion of the importance
of the following goals: .to develop
a philosophy of life, to be an
authority in a field, to have
friends different from themr
selves, and to help others in
difficulty. A smaller percentage
of the Grinnell freshmen thought
the following goals were imr
portant: to raise a family, to
have an active social life (33 per
cent at Grinnell, as per cent
nationally), to be “ad-
ministratively responsible” (9
per cent, 23 per cent), to be very
wellrofi financially, to become a
community leader, and to sue
ceed m a private business (19 per
cent,41percent).

75 per cent of the Grlnnell
freshmen classified their
political preferences as “left” or
“liberal,” 25 per cent as
“moderate,” “moderately
conservative," or “strongly
conservative." Nationally 34 per
cent of the freshmen labeled
themselves “left” or “liberal,”
and 66 per cent “moderate,”
“moderately conservative," or
“strongly conservative.” This
seems to raise an important
question: is the spectrum of
political views represented on
this campus as fully as they
should be? Another: 0n the
whole, do Students’ political
opinions really differ
significantly from those of their
parents, at this stage or ever?
Is there a ”generation gap" in
political views?

One part of the survey asked
the students to indicate the
statements with which they
”agreed strongly or somewhat ”
Some of the results: that all
scientific findings should be
published (67 per cent Grinnell,
54 per cent nationally), that the
college should control students
ofi campus (7 per cent, 20 per
cent), that the benefit of college
is monetary (16 per cent, 47 per
cent), that student publications
should be regulated (12 per cent,
51 per cent), that marijuana
should be legalized (65 per cent,
24 per cent), that'colleges are
too lax on student protest (16 per
cent, 60 per cent), that divorce
laws should be liberalized (93 per
cent, 76 per cent), that abortion
should be legalized (93 per cent,
76 per cent), that courts protect
the ciminal too much (21 per-
cent, 53 per cent.).

For those who advocate the 19-
year-old vote, there are some
interesting statistics. Only half of
the Grinnell freshmen and 23 per
cent of the national sample said
they had discussed politics in the
previous year, a national election
year. How would this compare
to the over»2l’s? Other things
they had done during the
previous year: Attended a
religious service (76 per cent, 91
per cent), argued with a teacher
in class (79 per cent, 55 per cent),
arranged a date for another
student (29 per cent, 49 per cent),
protested racial policy (as per
cent, 13 per cent), protested
us. military policy (26 per cent,
7 per cent), protested against a
high school administration (43
per cent, 25 per cent), read
poetry outside of a course (78 per
cent, 63 per cent), visited an art
gallery or museum (37 per cent,
63 per cent), discussed sports (30
per cent, 44 per cent).

Provided the results of the
survey give a reasonably ac
curate picture, they provide
some valuable information both
to the college in framing its
policies and to students in
discussing themselves and the
college. It would be interesting
to compare this to surveys of
other freshmen classes that have
entered Grinnell and to See
whether and how these students
change during the next four
years. We might also raise the
question: Is the Grinnell student
body sufficiently diverse to
provide the best education for
each of its members?
