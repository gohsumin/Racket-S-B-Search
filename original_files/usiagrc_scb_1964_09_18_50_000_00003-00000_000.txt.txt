The request for an SB-per-
student increase in the college
activity fee has been turned
down by the Board of Trus-
tees. Meeting in June. the
Board gave the following rea-
sons (or denying the roquestx

“l. The fees for 1964-55
have been announced and it
would be awkward to change
them at this date.

2. Since the opening of tho
Forum may change the social
and recreational needs in un-
expected ways, it would be
desirable to adjust fees after
rather than before the open<
ing of the Forum.

a. The Trustees felt that
improved budgetary proced-

ure and auditing should be
introduced b e f o r 9 rather
than after any Change in fee.

4. The college. from fund]
other than student fees, is
making a major effort in the
cultural area at considerable
expense and further increase
in funds for concerts, etc..
may not be of the highest
priority."

Had the proposed increase
passed last June, it would haw
meant additional funds amount-
ing to $10,000 for the 1954.35

.academic year.

The Executive Cabinet is cur-
rently working with the Stua-
dent Auditor to prepare a new
budget based on the available
funds.
