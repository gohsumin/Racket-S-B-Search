ference title, Grinnell posted their best season in over 30 years,
In 1929, the Pioneers finished their cfmpaign with a 5-1-2 mark,
r a .

Pioneer football coach Edd Bowers won the honor of doingt’
the best coaching job in Iowa this season, according to Buck Turne‘
hull of the ”Des Moines Register. ‘
Grinnell was also a hardsluck team, being only 1 minute 50‘
seconds and 3 points from an undefeated season In the Pioneers’
10-0 loss to C05. the Koshawks' winning field goal came with only.‘
15 seconds remaining. St, Olal scored with 1:35 showing on the

clock to defeat Grinnell 22-21, l
r s e

 

it was a week toi- upsets in college football, as four oirtlie-
nation’s top to teams were beaten. Two 01' those. Missouri and.
Georgia Tech, dropped out at the first ten, while the remaining.
pair, Colorado and Michigan State, hung onto the cightti andl
ninth positions, respectively, by a hair. i
e e e
Special recogn on should be extended to the Purdue ll,l
which pulled its second big upset within two weeks by defeating
Michigan State 7-6, subsequently it moved into seventh position in

In the Midwest Conference Cross—country meet last Saturday.
Jim Chesbro of Carleton, sprinting for 6th position, collapsed 50
feet from his goal. Undaunted, he pulled himself to his feet, and
staggered across the line in 22nd place. it took a great deal of
determination for him to run to complete exhaustion so near the
end, and even more guts to attempt to finish. 1

The Pioneers led the Midwest Conference in both the rushing
and total offense departments piling up 272 and 350 yards per
game, respectively. in each division. On the ground. Grinnell gains
ed 35 more yards per contest than their nearest rival, Coe. On
defense, the Pioneers ranked second behind Coe, allowing 201
yards in each game.
