is misdirected in the manner
otten evidenced, in my opinion,
in certain activities. We may
rightly object to standard, easy
answers to complex issues; yet
We too often do not seem to hon-
estly pursue the discovery and
appreciation of alternative possi-
bilities which may allow us to
choose a personal "answer" to t
given issue.

As a specific example, 1 men-
tionthe Interim coffeerhour dis-
cussimi concerning pro-marital
sex. Perhaps because we had
previously placed ourselves on
the liberal side of the issue and
because we found one member
of the panel “on our Side,” it
seemed unnecessary to do other
than attack the Methodist minr
ister's Position. Certainly he did
not help matters by allowing
himself to become confused and
defensive, but we gave him lit-
tle opportunity to explain his
stand. When he asked to whom
a specific query was addressed.
the answer “You might as well
answer it; everyone seems to be
picking on you anyway” was on-

SGA Approves
Election Rules

Wednesday night the Senate
approved the SGA convention
rules submitted by the Election
Commission. The SGA conven<
tion will be held Sunday, Feblu

uary 19. provided that more
than two candidates file for
the office of SGA president. The
election will then be held on
Tuesday, February 21. Petitions
for candidates will be available
on February 4.

The Senate also appropriated
a fund of $30 for serious candi-
dates and $15 for jag candidates
to help defray the cost of the
election.

In Executive Cabinet reports,
AWS Board President Karen
Lauterbach announced that
plans are being completed for
a sex education program in the
spring. Steve Kent announced
the appointment of Lilah Morton
as a temporary member of the
Board of Publications, The ep«
pointment was confirmed by the
Senate.

in other Senate action, Roger
Koenker gave a speech entitled,
“What Is to be Done."

ly too true. During the ques-
tion-answer period, most of the
“questions" appeared less con-
ceriied with securing “answers"
or eliciting information than
with destr ing this conserva-
tive position.

A peculiarly appropriate con-
clusion to the session was pro-
vided by, as 1 later discovered,
a professor who described at
length the ambiguities and mis-
takes which had marred the dis-
cussion. Rather than inform us
early enough to rc-direct the
discussion. or suggest some fin-
a1 observations for us to_ con-
sider in any subsequent discus-
sioii of the subject, his untime-
ly remarks seemed only to inti-
mate that students and panel
had been wasting our. and his,
time,

I am reminded at an episode
in “Beetle Bailey" when Beetle.
referring to Plato, who was as.
suming his characteristic pose
of asking rhetorical questions
while propped against a tree,
remarked, “I wonder if Plate is
really so smart; for you see, all
he ever does is ask questions,
and he never answers any.” c

i am not opposed to construe
tive dialectic lone may ask if
Socrates knew the answers),
but rather am concerned with
the destructive use of inquir~
lug minds.

A Student Comments

The “Revolution" Began

Ed. Notel Our Senate ro-
porter couldn't take Wednes-
day night's “revolutionaries“
seriously. His opinions are not
necessarily Ihose of the edi-
tor staff.

By Don Wlnney

“Mr. Speaker," said the quak-
ing voice, “I would like to ad-
dress the Senate." The solemn
voice echoed throughout the
solemn hody, convened in the
solemn ARI-l speechroom.

To be Carlyle, this reporter
thoughts, to be able to captuio
this historic moment of seeth»
lng solemnity for posterity. My
hand trembled.

“The time has come," Roger
Koenker lntOned, “to establish
the student revolution at Grin-
nell." The senate hushed. Then.
as Mr. Koenket‘ wrapped his
audience in an old toga ol wrin«
kled rhetoric, as he bent over
his manuscript with a sena-
torial decorum unbeknownst
Dan Bucks. a faint cough ema<
nated from a far comer. “Stu-
dents must rise in opposition,"
Roger droned,

“We pledge our lives." he
continued, and one thought of
Thomas lelierscn. One thought
of all those immortal revolu-
tionaries who passed the torch
to a new generation, One
thought of Robespierre.

“One must choose between
the mediocrity of complacency
or the greatness of a social up-
heaval,” he said. Then the ul-
timale moment came. “what,"
asked Roger. “is to be done?"
Roger sat down. A profound sl-
lence pervaded the assemblagu
while everyone thought.

Then suddenly, charging from
the throng like Prometheus un<
hound, pushing aside both
friend and toe, that beautiful
Brutus, that nonsenator—inen-
ile, Steve Shender, addressed
the gathering.

“We cannot ignore," sald
Steve. ”the violent overtones of
this speech. What is to be done
is the question that makes this
speech irrelevant. ! am against
irrelevant radicalism. I am
against radicalism for radical-
ism's sake."

The senators sitting in the
speech room were speechless.
But there was one man who
wasn’t. There was one who
knew the evil that men do often
lives alter them, There was
Ron Gatton who arose to Rog-
er's otlense.

“Mr. Shender," said Ron,
(licking the ashes interred ill
his Cigarette. “Mr. Shender is
ignorant oi the issues." Then
he smiled. “But i could go rat-
tling on all night.”

The Senate then agreed on
what was to be done: it ad-
journed.
