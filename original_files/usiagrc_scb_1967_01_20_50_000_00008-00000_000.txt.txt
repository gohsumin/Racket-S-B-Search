‘3 Gropplers Will Fate Conference Foes Grinnell Tankers

Cagers in Conference Cellar;
Face Tough Foes This Weekend

The Pioneer basketball team
dropped their sixteenth and sev-
enteenth consecutive games last
Weekend and will face two rough
teams this weekend as they at-
tempt to get out oi the con-
Iei‘ence cellar.

The seventeen losses included
two in the Colorado Christmas
tournament and two conference
losses during Christmas break.
A: Colorado the Pioneers lost
to Knox 82-53 and Chicago 52-42,
in the two conierence games
they lost to Knox again 33768
and to Monmouth 6654.

Last weekend the Pioneers
dropped their toutth and titth
conference games to Ripon 92—
85 and to 'Lawrence 73-7Zr

The Pioneers were hurt by
cold shooting and inconsistent
rebounding over the (our games

at Christmas break. In the {our
games they could hit only as per
cent and were beaten badly on
the boards, Coach Pfitsch has
said that the Pioneers had to
hit around 45 per cent to win.
Pfitsch, though, was a little
happier about the games the
team played at Monmouth and
Knox and was hoping to pick up
a couple of victories during the
current live game homestand.
Unfortunately the easier part
of the homestand is over and

Walker, a 1956 Grinnell grad~
uate who is directing the Pion-
ears for the first time, will have
only five lettei'men in his line-
up. But the presence of some
talented sophomores has raised
his hopes and he anticipates a
“good dual meet team."

“It’s hard for a new coach
to tell much about his team qu<
til it’s had a few meets,” Walker
said. “We have some weak spots
but are coming along reasonably
well, We at least have a man
in every weight class”

“Do you use the folk music
idiom to communicate a so-

g) ciai or political message?"

“Absolutely not. The only
reason 1 play for people as far
as I'm concerned is for their
pleasure and enjoyment, not to
try to convey any particular

political thing across . . , Be-
cause you can be misunder-
stood . . and have a lot at
people dislike you that wouldn‘t
ordinarily.”

“What do you thing are the
reasons tor the relatively sud-
den interest in traditional
folk music?"

“l’ve had that question
asked to me, i guess at least

two hundred times in the past
three years. and I've answered
it in every kind of way but the
right way — i honestly don’t
know. I like old time country
music because to me it’s a part
of the people who, so to speak,
carved the country out of a wil-
derness. . . . Everything they
had, they made by hand . . .
so the music was sort of hand
made. too — just like antique
furniture or an antique car —
you like it because it sorta' has
a personality — or a lot of per-
sonalities put together, . t .
I'd say maybe that the city
folks , . t have the same feel-
ing about the music it gets to
them — maybe they don't quite
understand why."

“What, in your opinion, is
the future of oral tradition
under contemporary commer-
cial influence?"

“Well, that’s hard to say,
because, for instance, the re-

vival of old time country mu-
sic wasn't until the Kingstons,

. . It was brought to mind,
so to speak, by a commercial
group. r r . Then when the
Friends or Old'Time Music, in
New York, started their little
movement . . it caught on . . .
Since it is sort oi like antique
iumiture, maybe the commere
cial aspect or folk music won't
have much effect on it one way
or the other, maybe it’ll just
hang on for a while I hope it
does.”

Will Host Relays

Grini'iell College’s swimmers
swing back into action today af<
ter a sot-week break in their
schedule

The Pioneers, who haven't had
a meet since dropping a 5861
decision to Midwest Conference
Champion Cornell Dec. 9, will
host Luther, State College of
Iowa, and Wayne State (Nebras-
ka) in the first Grinnell Relays.

Diving preliminaries are
slated for 2:30 p.m. with the
swimming competition and div-
ing hnais beginning at 4:00 pm.

Only relays competition is
Slated, There Will be eight Var-
sity and two freshman relays
along with 2 tworman diving
competition on the varsity level.

In addition to a championship
trophy which goes to the winning
team, medals will be presented
to the members of each first
place relay unit.

Wayne State ranks as a
heavy favorite to carry away
the trophy. The Nebraska out-
fit, which boasts 10 letterman
plus several talented newcomers
defeated both Grinnell and Luth-
er in a triangular a year ago.

Aided by two weeks of heavy
practice, the P i u n e e r s are
rounding into top notch physical
shape, according to Coach Ray
Obermiller. But, he fears his
team‘s lack of depth, always a
p r o b 1 e m . will be especially
troublesome this week.
