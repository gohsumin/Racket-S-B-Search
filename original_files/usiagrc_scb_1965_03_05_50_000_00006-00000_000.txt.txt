Hungu Views American Brutality

(Continued from Page 3)

also by the establishment of the
forces which cut down the in-
nocent personalities of John F.
Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Mal-
colm X, the Negro children in
a Birmingham Sunday school
class, and other numerous bru-
talities that are so characteris-
tic of American everyday life
at large. To the free African
these are the forces of imper-
ialism and colonialism, the
forces he hates most. He knows
that they are the same type
of forces which killed Africa’s
beloved Patrice Lumumba. Af-
ter all it’s the burial of these
forces that we 'celebrate on
every independence anniver-
sary. We will never voluntar-
ily allow ourselves to be de-
voured by them again for the
second time. We are free, a
fact which every good African,
black or white, knows. We are
on the move to free the whole
of Africa; we know someday
all Africa will be free! The
words of my country’s Prime
Minister, vocalizcd on the oc-
casion of Malawi’s admission
into the United Nations, have
great meaning, “History has
shown that no peoples can be
held in subjugation forever.”
And so nobody will!

What confounds the African
Negro even more is how a
country so professedly dedi‘
cated to the virtues of freedom,

 

liberty and justice (whatever
these terms mean) can still
have Clarkism as its sheriff. If
by any means you think I don’t
understand the situation, which
is probably true everything
confounds me, please talk to
me that I may understand! I
am here to understand not Only
academic America but current
America 100. So let's know
each other, knowing itself won't
hurt at all.

However, in spite of all the
inhumanity that goes on here,
African pastors pray day and
night that America may be-
come a better place for all hu-
manity; and also that America
may come to our aid when we
embark on that step to destroy
and abolish the horse and rider
racial relationship that stenches
all Angola, Mozambique, Rho.
desia, South Africa, and some
other parts of the “civilized"
world. For those of you who
don’t know about the horse and
rider relationship, the African
is the one under the saddle,
and the one on the saddle is the
European or anyone who can
easily be mistaken for a Euro-
pean.

Whether the pastors' prayers
are being received by the God
of all humanity, we’ll know bet-
ter in due time. But I think the
earlier we know the better for
all concerned, believers or un-
believers, pagans or nonpa-
gans. . '
