Explore'Purposes of Interim Session

By Karen Adkinson

The end of exams, a week
from next Tuesday, signals the
beginning of the interim period,
a recent innovation at Grinnell.

The interim was one of the

results of a comprehensive cur-
riculum study by the faculty
several years ago. This study
produced not only the germ of
the present JLA system, but
also, in an unrelated sugges
tion, the concept of a reading
period. The system as it: now
stands came out of long dis-
cussions by the entire faculty

as well as work by several
committees and the Executive
Council. ,

Waldo Walker, ‘associate
dean, who is in charge of the
.lnterim program, commented
“The faculty felt that it was
fairly important that students
do something for themselves
with time freed from the regi-
mentatlon or classes. During
this free time, it was felt, stu-
dents might explore aspects
of education which could not
be explored through class-
work. The timing of the inter-
im session reveals its non-

course orientation, 5 i n o e
some schools place their
reading p e r I o d s before
exams."

The interim this year will
feature Kenneth Burke, noted
literary critic, and Dr. Norwood
Russell Hansen of Yale, as well
as Rosenfield lecturer, Stanley
Hoffmann,

Walker noted, “The featured
lecturers were chosen from
speakers whom we had heard
were effective on other college
campuses.

Notes Regulation
0n ARH Smoking

T0,,the editorl

Because of the tire hazard
and because of insurance re~
quirements, the Administra-
tion has repeatedly asked the
SGA to remind students that
no smoking is allowed in ARH
Auditorium, especially during
movies. Although this regula~
tion is posted, some students
still persist in smoking. The
Movies Committee has been in—
formed that this must stop if
it is to continue to show films
there. Unfortunately, this re-
quires that the noVsmoking rule
be strictly enforced. In the fu~
ture if anyone in the audience
lights up, the movie will be

stopped. Please save yourself,

embarrassment and smoke out-
side the Auditorium.

Dr. Hansen is holder of seven

Besides lecturers, a normal
schedule of social events is be.
ing planned including an extenr
sive'program of movies. Miss
Georgia Dentel end Mr. Irwin
Simone have been working in
coordination with Walker in
planning the nonacademic pro.
gram.

“The junior liberal arts
exam, which so many stu-
dents think the Interim ls
built around, is only one part
of this program. The fresh-
men have their series linking
humanities and historical
studies. The sophomores hav.
their lecture series. The JLK
should not be casting a black
shadow over the interim,"
said Walker.

He continued. "Last year’-
reading period was successful,
gauged by the attendance at
lectures, Instead of falling off
it actually increased, especially
in the case of Rapeport. De-
spite the length of free time
there was a heavy majority of
students remaining on campus
for the entire period. On the
whole, the faculty felt the time
was a success."
