Berg,'Frank Relate Experiences
Al Argonne National Laboratory

By John Wolf

Grinnell seniors Fred Berg
and James Frank have recent-
ly returned from a semester of
ytudy at the Argonne Nation-

1 Laboratory near Chicago.
Ewing their stay at Argonne,

ey had the opportunity of be-
ing part of a research com-
munity.

”Its almost impossible”.
Berg commented ”to do real re-
search in physics at a small col-
lege becauserthe needed equip-
rnent is so expensive. At Ar-

onnc I was able to do rewarda
Tug research in physics; al~

though of course, our freedom
in using the equipment was lim~

Ited because it was so expen-
’ sive and because we lacked the

necessary training. "

“We had three obligations
ﬁuring our stay at krgonne,”
Frank noted. ”First, each stu-
kIent selected a project and
? supervisor from among the
ull-time Argonne researchers.
’A paper concerning the project
had to be'written at the end
pf the semester.

“Second, we had to attend
Eeriodic seminars in our major
ield—either bielosy. chemistry,
or physics. In my biology sem-
inar, all seven students gave
Dnerand-one-half hours talks on
a series of general topics which
were researched in Argonne’s
.xcellent‘ libraries.

/ ‘jFinally, there were weekly

interdisciplinary seminars dur-
ing which we were exposed to
the different facets of the lab,
within the limits of our back-
ground.”

Frank’s project was the de-
termination ot the changes of
effective density of diOXyribon-
ucleic acid (DNA) at varying
pH levels. He recalled that,

”one machine, a $26 000 ultra—
centrifuge, gave me some trou-
ble. ”

Berg 5 paper was titled “The
Nuclear Zeeman Effect in
NbiiSnllQ.”

“I was trying to determine
the superconducting regions in
niobium tin, If they existed. The
experiment involved using the
Mossbauer Effect.”

Berg also assisted his adviser
in other experiments.

“We had to complete one six-
week experiment in two weeks
because they were closing down
one of the reactors for repair.
To add to the rush, the radio«
active material we were using
had a short half~life. So, each
time we needed the radioac-
tive material, I had to rush
over in a special cart, get the
material from the reactor, and
rush back. We even had people
holding open doors "

“There was generally very
little pressure on us from our
supervisors," F r a n k said.
“That doesn’t mean that we

 

had time on our hands, how-

ever. In fact, we didn‘t even
get a Christmas vacation.”

Students participating in the
Argonne Semester live on the
grounds of the laboratory. Stu-
dents from all schools in the
Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west are eligible; those select-
ed pay tuition to their home
school and pay room and board
to Argonne. Participants re-
ceive up to 15 hours of credit
toward their _graduation re-
quirement. Each student re-
ceives $40 a week for a 20-hour
work week.

Very little classified Work is
being done at Argonne at pres-
ent; consequently security is

not tight, Frank‘noted. Berg
did mention, however, that
badges were required for en
trance in the evening and that
there were spot checks of em-
ployees’ cars.

Both returnees felt that their
experiences at Argonne have
given them a first-hand under
standing of the demands of re-
search. Both advised any stu-
dent at all interested in re-
search to look into the pro-
gram.

Since the Argonne program
began In 1960, eight Grinnell-
ions have participated as stu<
d e n t research associates.
James Clapp in mathematics-
chemistry and Michael Schul-
hof in physics were Grinnell’s
participants in the spring 1963
session.
