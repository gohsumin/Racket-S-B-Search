Cagers Lose to Calls, ﬂies; Meet Beloit, Coe

By Pete Kollman

The Glinnell Pioneers, once
(lo-holders of 2nd place in Mid-
west Conference play, dropped
two heartbreakers here last
weekend to the visitors from
Northfield, Carleton and St,
Olaf.

This was the fourth Pioneer
loss in the last five conference
outings; however, all but the
Cornell game were lost by 4
points or less,

On Friday night Gi'innell
took the floor against the
Carls and it looked as if the
game would be no contest.
The Pioneers zoomed off to
B 10 point lead. The lead re-
mained around the 12 point
mark until late in the half
when the Carls began a come-
back. They cut Grimell‘s
margin to 42-37 and hit again
just before the halftime ham
to go to the dressing room
.h'ailing by just three points.

The Pioneers started out well

in the 2nd half and increased ;

their margin to 8 before Carla»
ton went to work again The
Cal‘ls edged up on Grinnell,
passed them and built up a 9
point lead, which they held un-
til the Pioneers came to life
Wlth four minutes remaining.

Aided by three missed free
Iihrows by Carleton’s Jack Ars-
do, Grinnell cut the margin to
three and were threatening at
the end before they finally suc-
cumbed, 89786.

Both teams hit very well for
the evening, Grinnell making
41 per cent of its field goal at-
tempts and Carleton 50 per
cent, including a 57 per cent
performance in the second
half. Grinnell hit 32 per Cent
(14-17) and Carleton 11 percent
(17-24) from the foul line.

Outstanding pErfonnnnces
were turned in by senior co<
captain, Jim Mifflin and soph-
nmore Jeff Frantz. Miiflin
scored 29 points, a Pioneer
season high, and Frantz hit
13 field goals, also a season
high, and lead Grinnell’s final
surge before fouling out.

The Saturday afternoon con-
test was another frustrating
one for the Pioneers. After
spurting off to an early lead,
they were caught by St. Olaf
and the game turned into a see-
saw battle. At halftime both
teams had 40 points.

Neither team was able to
amass more than a four point
lead in the second half. With
three minutes to go the Oles
had a two point lead and tried
to stall but the Pioneers stole
tho ball and Jim Mifflin put in
the tying basket with a little
less than two minutes remain-
ing. St. Olaf Stalled until 6 sec-
onds remained when Eric
Grimsrud, Ole guard popped in
the winning’ basket. Grinnell
tried in vain to get a shot off
in the seconds remaining

As the night before, both
teams scored anlequal number
of field goals, the margin com-
ing from the foul line, Grinnell
hit 42 per cent from the field;
St. Olaf connected on 43 per
cent of its tries. Once again
Mifflin and Fi‘antz led the Pio-
neers, the senior forward hit-
ting l9, and the sophomore
guard, 21.

Midwest Conference Siale Full;
Redmen Play Host in Lawrence

In What Could be the key
games of the Week in the Mid-
west Conference, Coe will be
at Cornell and Lawrence at
league leading Ripon on Friday
night. Both Coe and Lawrence
figure to play the role of the
spoilers in this pair.

Cornell, headed by the scor-
ing of Jack Grams and Dick
Calbow, and the strong all-
around play of Dal Zierk and
John Shillinglaw, will have to
stop the onertwo scoring punch
of Coe's Wylan Witte and Skip
Swan,

The first time around, Ripon
had little trouble with neighbor-
ing Lawrence, but since then,
the Vikings have got their of-
tense rolling, with Joel Ungrodt
and Earl Hoover leading the
way, they have moved into the
thick of things If the injured
Tom Steinmetz is ready, Law-
rence could be tough

Ripon really depends on no
one in its balanced attackl Gary
Mevis is the top scorer now,
but Jack Ankerson, Jim Car
hoon, and Willie Alexander
have all racked up their share
of points,

While the Redmen have but
one league game facing them
this weekend, Cornell has to go
to Belolt on Saturday night to
face the Dave Hendricks and
Bob Rudolph led Bucs, who
find themselves right in the
middle of the pack,

Facing Beloit on Friday night
will be the slumping Grinnell
Pioneers who have had trouble
finding scoring support for its
onertwo punch of Jim Mifflin
and Jeff Frantz, who moved in-
to the league's leadingrscorer

 

list for the first time since the
first couple weeks of the sea-
son,

On Saturday night, the Pio~
neers face traditional rival C0!
in Cedar Rapids for a rematch
in the first one, Grinnell won
73-71 on a last second buckctl

Meanwhile, the Illinois pair,
Knox and Monmouth go to
Northlield, Minn, to try St Olaf
and Carleton, First on the
docket are Monmouth and Car»
latch, and Knox and St. Olaf.

Monmouth could take a big
step toward getting out of the
basement with a sweep over the
up and Coming Carls and Oles.
The bulk Of the Scot attack is
built around the shooting tal-
ents of Gary Gilliland, Harold
Rathgeb, and Dick Rodgers.

Carleton has been getting
steady performances out of
little Jack Arado. However,
coming on fast of late have been
Ron Sanders, Mike Tierney, and
Jack Chap. Both Tierney and
Chap are ever-present under
the boards

Knox is probably the hottest
offensive machine in the Mid-
west right” now with three
straight games over the 100
mark — 118, 106, and 105. ND
one in particular has been find-
ing the bucket for the Siwash,
just everyone at once, Leader
right now is Brandon Piper who
has exploded for 49 points in
the last two league games.

Their last faint hopes of o
conterence title put to flight a
week ago, Gnnnell’s varsity
basketball squad now zeros in
on the thick of a three-team
race tor second place with a
two-day road trip to Beloit and
Coe. The Pioneers take on the
Bucs tonight and move on to
Cedar Rapids for another night
game against Coe tomorrow.
P lo n e e r mentor John
Pfitsch indicated earlier this
week that he plans to continue
to experiment to try and iind
a winning combination, John
Sundell, the league‘s leading
rebounder, appears fit again
after a bout of illness which
limited him to 21 total re-'
bounds in the last two games
— about halt his average.

.Tim Mifflln, the team’s lead-
ing scorer with a 20.4 mark, and
Jeff Frantz, who netted 47
points against the invaders
from Northficld to up his av-
erage to 17.0, appeal- to be cer-
tain starters. Pfitsch was also
pleased with the work of re-
serve Ted kisser and tabs RisV
ser for more action this week
end.

Beloit, tonight’s opponent,
is currently tied for fifth in
the Midwest Conference and
a win over the Pioneers could
move Coach Bill Knapton’s
crew into fourth, The Bucs
are sparked by forward Bob
Rudolph and guard Dave Hen-

Odricks, both with 16 point
averages. Belait also has a
revenge motive working tor
them since Grinnell cooled
off the hot-shooting Wiscon-
sin team earlier this year by
an 83-76 count.

Coe, although mired in ninth
place with a 4.9 record, pos-
sesses perhaps the most potent
172 punch in the league this
season .in Wylan Witto (19.4
points per game) and Skip
Swan (19.3 points per game).
Moreover, the Kuhawks have
good depth Pioneer fans can
attest to this after the Grinnell
team held Witte to eight points
in their 73-71 cliffhanger win
last month, only to have guard
Bob Beckman toss in 20 points
to almost pull the game 0th of
the fire for the Kohawks.

Optimistically, Coach Pfitsch
sees a good chance for a double
victory this trip. The Pioneers .
have downed both teams before
and. oddly enough, are playing
better ball on the road so far
this year than at home.
