matmen continue their confer—
ence competition this afternoon

in Derby gym. On Saturday aft.
emoon at 1:30 the gtapplers
take on itipon. Coach Terry
Moore reports that the team may
be short as many as three regu-
lar wrestlers this weekend. Ken
Clymer, 147-1b. Pioneer, will
probably not see action due to
an infection, and lat—pounder
John Gaarde will not wrestle.

1 Furthermore, undefeated heavy-

weight Morgan Michel may be
out with a shoulder injury suf-
feted in practice. However,
Coach Moore hopes that by shift»
ing a few wrestlers the matmen
will be able to stop Lawrence
and possibly Ripon. Lawrence,

travel to Northheld, Minn, to
play the Carleton and St. Olaf
freshmen tomorrow and Sunday.
Both schools have intercollegiate
hockey.

Grinnell will be playing at
full strength for the first time
since their opening game a-
gainst the Des Moines All-
Stars. In the second contest
Russ Harden was unable to
play, and in the last outing
Dave lrnes was absent.

The starting lineup for the
two weekend encounters will
probably be Harden, Imes, Jeri
Langham, Bob Dyer, Mike Bech—
ert, and goalie Bart Dunning.

DUE TO THE unusually warm
weather, the club was only able
to have chalh talks and omit-le-
ice workouts this week. Coach

'Langham had no idea how strong

the two freshman squads would
be, but felt assured of some good
