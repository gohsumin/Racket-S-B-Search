“The student shouldn’t be-

“A danger lies in the tendehcy
to judge everyone by personal

in fact they often aren’t yet big‘

the main controversy concerns
in the upemdorm

ing.

This policy is one uhich has
been disc ssed on campus, yet
rs obviously being interpreted
in various ways. From talking
with students it is evident that
many halls are accepting this

‘policy not for nightly open-room
‘p vileges—but ’lre consenting
‘pxm‘larily because of the option
,clause, which permits a hall to

limit [he hours that the dolmi-
tory might be open. Few people
with whom l have talked would
care to have the rooms open
every night.

It is my reeling that a more
mutual interpretation should be
established, and that it people.I
