Calling the Kennedy Admin
stration’s handling of Cuban r
latlons a “comedy of mistakes,”
Senator Barry Goldwater (Rep,
Ariz.) lashed out at current lpol~
icy Wednesday in a student press
conference.

Goldwater told a “standing
room only” audience in Rob-
erts theater that America’s “be
firm with Cuba" policy had
been “far short of what was
needed since the ﬁrst inetiec-
tive embargo on Cuba."

He further said, “I don’t think
Russia wants to ﬁght over Cuba.
lf 1 were Khrushchev, l would
not risk losing everything when
I’m winning."

THE CONFERENCE which was
modeled after Washington Presi—
dential press conferences was co.
sponsored by Sigma Delta chi
and Theta Sigma Phi, men’s and
women’s professional journalism
fraternities.

Goldwater defended “brink-
manship" as the means of keep-
ing the peace. He compared air
supremacy of the United States
—the power behind brinkman~
ship—to the English naval su-
premacy which guaranteed "a
fair degree of peace” in Europe
for two centuries.

Describing the conditions nec~
essary for disarmament, Gold-
water demanded complete inspec—
tion privileges. He thought in-
spection might he best accom—
plished by a network of spy sat.
ellites.

He called the disarmament
proposals of President Kenne-
dy “dangerous and threatening
to the national security," con—
cluding the fundamental road-

block to disarmament to he
“We just can't trust them."
Moving to domestic issues,
Goldwater outlined his policy
on the i ississippi incident. He
attacked the intervention of the
Federal Government on the
grounds of constitutionality. The
senator argued that “the 1054
Supreme Court decision on seg—

rcgation did not go far enough,"
because it did not reserve the
power of enforcement to the
Federal Government and that it
is therefore reserved to the
states by the 10th amendment.
He found the actions of Covert
nor Barnett constitutionally valid;
but morally wrong by his own
standards.

Goldwater claimed that freer

issue of our times, the 1962 elec—

THE SENATOR urged Ameri—
cans to reject materialism and
to recognizestheir spiritual tra—
dition. Goldwater said. “The
great gulf between the U.S. and
Russia is theological. For the
Communists, man is a creature
who wants his belly ﬁlled and

The Senator argued that for

The Senator wamed Ameri-
cans not to overlook the prin-
ciples of the founding fathers,
especially inalienable rights.
“Man has natural rights, be.

The dignity of man, liberty

Cuba resolution
wired Kennedy
by Peace Group

In the light of the 'Cuban
crisis, the Grinnell Student
Peace Group met in an Emer-
gency meeting last Wednesday
evening. The group decided on
a threefold plan of action.

First, the group organized at
telegram campaign at Grinnelll
in order for students to express

on the issue. Secondly, they deal
cided to call other schools
around the country in order to
make this telegram campaign
nationwide.

Thirdly, by unanimous votet
the group approved a resolution]
to be sent to President Ken~|
nedy, in the name of the Grin—
nell Student Peace Group, as
well as major newspapers inl
this country and abroad.

The resolution reads as fol-
ln the past anxious days the

brink of war. The world looks
to President Kennedy for lead-
ership. Immediate action must
be taken to relieve world tens
Sions and remove the imminent
threat of war.

We urge the president to
Seize the initiative and official-
ly call a summit meeting. to
make good his Monday evening
offer to negotiate the Cuba
crisis.

We must be prepared to go
beyond the immediate questions
of the hoped-for negotiations,
the US. quarantine of Cuba and
the Soviet military build-up in
that country.

Discussion must be opened on
the future status of overseas}
military bases of both powers.

 

,Our government Should enter-,Alumni office will help

tain the possibility of removing
American missile bases in the
Middle East, if we are to make
our demands for the removal of
Soviet bases valid. 3

Summit conferences of the,’
past have worked but not
well enough. An infusion of,
imagination could turn a new,
Summit into a more permanent'
cure for the ills of brinkman-l
ship. We see no more favorablel
moment for avoiding futurel
brinks that at a time when the
consequences ‘of war have been
conjured up so vividly in the‘
minds of men l
