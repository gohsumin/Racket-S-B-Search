Scarlet Fever

When Denny Asby was elected a co—captain of the
basketball team it made him the second man in modern
Gl‘innell athletics history to be named a captain in two
sports.

The only other dllalrcaptain was John Copeland, Wlloi
graduated in 1959 after holding the captaincy of the fool:-
hall and basketball teams.

Asby, however, has one added distinction—he will
be the first oil-captain ever at Grinnell to help lead two do»
fending champions. ‘
