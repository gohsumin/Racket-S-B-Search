By J. VON BRIESEN RAZ

At the beginning of a game of Chess the two opposing sides
are equal. At the end of the game one side has accumulated cer-
tain advantages and Can iorce a Checkmate or neither side has
accumulated sufﬁcient advantages and the game has endediin a
draw. The following several articles will examine the kinds of
advantages that go into the making of a won game.

Masters throughout the history at the game have learned to
distinguish iour elements which form the matter [if the game;
lime, measured in units of moves useful to development called
“tempi”; space, ireedom of movement and measured as- Larry
Evans suggests by thenumher oi squares oi the opponent’s hall
of the board which one strikes e.g., a bishop on Q3 attacks K35,
KNB, KR7, QN5, QRe, tor a total or iive squares or space; pawn
structure, the skeleton of the game; and material or force, the
pawns and the pieces. Time and space are dynamic elements and-
can change quickly; pawn stnicture and iorce are static chang-
ing gradually during the game. . _

Advantages in these different elements are fluid during the
play or the game — one can be translated in“) the other, cir-
cumstances permitting -— and it is the master who knows how
to get the advantages and knows when and, how to. translate
them into the ﬁnal checkmate. ' ,

The tuiiowing examples are taken from the openings. Notice
how advantages and disadvantages are translated irom the
ideally equal position.
