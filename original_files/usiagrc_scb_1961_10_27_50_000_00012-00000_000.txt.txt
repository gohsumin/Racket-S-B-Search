lJoe Okumu Views Problem 0f Pan-Alricanism

by Joe Okumu
This article is one of many

monthly contributions I make ‘
to the Student Press Center l

in eastern and central Airic .
it is written for readers who
hav firm foundations in the
African movement. For this
reason, if any reader should
ﬁnd anything ambiguous, I
shall he most willing to dis-
cuss the assumed details.

When speaking of Pan-Afri-
loanisin, Ono’s attitude should not
‘ be shrouded by the mist of the
past, Everyone knows of the
heroic Fall-African movement;
, Dirbors, Blaisc Diagne, Fads
‘ more, Kwame Nkhruma and Jo-
,mo Kenyatta are great names
which will go down in history
with it.

The most important thing is to
consider the present forms and
contents of PansAt'l‘iCallisnl, its
political, social and economic
aspects and particularly its res
lations lo the student movement
in Africa,

Today one cannot detach the
Pan-African movement from its
colonial context. Colonialism still
makes for an unhappy atmoss
phel'e in which Africa exists,
The question is how to ﬁght

A coherent’ and strong move-
ment is needed for all the Afri-
can states still under abject
‘subjugation, a movement that
,will make for an unshakahlc
solidarity that eventually will
be transformed into an ideology.

Tire African states under Mr
lonialism have labored under
common experiences. They
have lived under oppressive
conditions too dehased to de-
serve a .mention. Their devel»

”You don't have to he a cone
torticnist to practice and to any
joy a beginning experience with
Yoga", explains West Norris
sophomore Phil Brown, who
has initiated a Yoga interest
group on campus.

Although Yoga, a form of
Hinduism, has philosophic impli—
cations, Brown‘s instruction will
focus on Hatha Yoga. the Yoga
of physical \vellrbeing. Tire idea
for the beginner is to hold one
of the basic yoga positions {or
a length of time while taking
deep, measured breaths, a whole
ly different approach to physi
cal training than in the Western
World, where emphasis is on
repetition rather than retention

When studying the character.
istics of political make-up in
Africa, one is bound to meet
two tendencies: the tendency io
individual well—being as distinct
from tlrc tendency to community
welfare. FansAfncanism in the
present African context, with
its many political. social and
economic complexities, should
seek to accommodate the two
East and West tendencies.

Tile important thing is intake
advantage of the East~West d
vision. Because, for the A
can states, and inspired by the
Bandung Conference, the world
should be looked upon as be-
ing divided into ltwo regions.
The developed and the develop.
ing countries always seek to
extend their spheres of inﬂuence
and paternalism. So, the good
will be coming by itself, and
there is no need to beg for
economic assistance.

There is no need to ingl‘aiiv

or the West. There is what we
call “positive tralrsm” to
cater for it, Posit ~c neutralism

But our- lirst task will be to

The PansAfl'lcall student conIe —

influence as the PanrAl‘rlcan
conference, on Africa. Students
coming to these conferences
have a dirty to see that such
conferences succeed. If we have
failed ill the past. it is because
long divided, We have not been
‘able to accommodate oach oth«

We must therefore strive as
assiduously as possible to ﬁnd
and determine common areas

is to emerge to greatness and
