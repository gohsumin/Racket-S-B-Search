A student proposal -—

Reform for North Campus

ED. NOTE: This column is written
in response to a letter Chairman
of the Faculty Joseph Wall distribut-
ed this week. In the letter, Wall out-
llnes the Faculty Student Affairs com-
mittee’s basic support for the Interim
Court’s actions in recent disciplinary
bases and explained the Committee’s
reasons for modifying the Court’s pro-
posed penalties. Wail also suggested
that this “unlmppy episode" stressed
the need tor the creation 0! a joint
Modem-faculty Judiciary Council and
revisions in the present hall system.

By Adrienne Lenin-ans and David Dillon

in regard to last week's court deci-
sion, we agree with you mat the situa-
tlon which came to light cannot be
tolerated, and that “any system which
rosters or even permits such conditions
must be altered." While the corrective
measures taken allow us a short r9-
prieve, they can nnly prepare the way
for more essential structural reforms.
We therefore wish to present some spe-
oliic recommendations for considera-
tion by the entire campus community.
They are outlined in two categories.
The first of these should be enacted
promptly, perhaps by September, 1969.
The second series reflect more long-
renge, but equally urgent goals, and
might well be implemented by Septem-
ber, 1972. The former are delineated
below:

1. Present forms of association all
North Campus impose an artiﬁcial con-
formity, stifling spontaneous social re-
lationsbips. Prepping and other exces<
slve manifestations or “hall spirit” bo-
oome respectable fronts for the isola-
tion and mistreatment of selected in-
dividuals. A static, closed system bo-
gets inbred cults and styles; the stem
types thus engendered discourage gen-
uine personal Contact. Residential so-
ciety must therefore be made ﬂuid,
adaptable and liberal. With this aim in
view, we suggest that room drawings
and the election at the Com? be con-
ducted at large, so that hall life may
become a truly open society. informal
clusters of friends and decentralized
lloor gatherings (including a House
Council member) would carry on the
“socialization" now improperly borne
by house government and “traditions."
This balance seeks at once a closer as-
sociation within the hall and an exten—
:ion of ties which are independent of
residential separation.

2. To encourage interaction between
houses, an initiative bonus would I‘E-
place the present senate fund. Each
hall could augment its regular social
allotment by joint planning With an-

other residence. Up to a maximum llm<
it, 10% or the cost of each event would
be reimbursed to both halls from a spe-
cial fund; die bonus could be used for
any social activity at the discretion of
the house membership. Money for this
purpose might be raised by a $5 in-
crease in the student activities fee.

3. The sanctity of every personality
is the essence or humane learning. Thus
we propose the following regulation be
adopted and published in the Student
Handbook.

Physical harassment or psychological
brutality toward any student is not
tolerated on the Grinneu campus,
whether expressed in isolated no-
ti us or in patterns of covert beha»

vror. Complaints of such treatment
may be brought to the Community

Court by the deans, the house presi-
dents, or the victims themselves.
Conviction for this ntlcuse will re.
suit in conduct probation after the
ﬁrst instance, and social expulsion in
the event of repetition. in cases of
recurrent abuse, the house president
may be required by the Court to sub-
rnit regular reports on the situation
until the Court deems the problem
resolved.

4. The negative aspects oi the North
Campus milieu are exacerbated by a
barracks or boarding school atmosphere.
This condition may be improved by a
liberalization of open dorms pohcy, cork
ducive to less formalized coed relation-
ships. Emphasis needs to be shifted to
include studying. billl sessions, and
group recreation, as well as dating. For-
rrler Cot'HP president Bob Foote's origi-
nal suggestion for legal Visitation on
weekdays (11:00 A.M. - 7:01] P.M., Mona
day . Thursday. 11:00 A. M. . 11:00 PM,
Friday - Saturday) offers the greatest
promise tor such a development.

5. Opportunities tor psychological
guidance remain grossly inadequate
The college should maintain a resident
psychiatrist whose services would be
available to any student without cost.
Hall advisers should also assume a
greater counseling role.

These immediate steps ought to be
reiniorced in long—term community
planning: 1. The residence system must
encompass a wider diversity. At least
three alternatives should be provided
— traditional dorms for men and wom-
en, oft campus rooms and apartments,
and co-educational balls,

2. Facilities are needed at all hours
for study or conversation in private.
Since hall lounges do not serve this
function well, Smaller, enclosed area!
ought to be provided tor the purposo.
Hopefully, the adoption of these pro-
posals would cause student culture morn
fully to reflect our academic values
and pursuits.

 

} Senate
(Continued from Page l)

the Opens committee is pessimistic
about their chances to get extended open
moms, “Considering the attitude of the
administration. most people don't be-
lieve extended opens are possible,“ he
said.

Mary Malcom, Cleveland, suggested
that student bedrooms will have to
double as living rooms again next year
because tho college cannot afford to
build both. Jefl Fern, Norm, felt that
the current opens policy punishes law
abiding people and that it was hypo-
nrltical for those fortunate enough to
have certain rooms to be allowed to
have opens while others cannot.

Horn suggested the Opens Committee
might better spend 15 time Considering
other ways or providing some degree at
privacy on dates.

The Senate approved With two revision:

the creation of a new Community Court.
The revisions were:

Cases which affect only one hall and
not the campus as a whole will be
handled within the individual halls, sub-
ject to appeal,

The three student members of the
court will be appointed by the AWS and
CofHP in joint agreement. Their ap<
pointment is subject to Senate approval.

John Zarwan, East, renewed all old can—
troversy when he questioned whether the
Court's makeup of three students and
an equal number of faculty members
wouldn‘t result in trequent ties.

in the lengthy argument that tollowed,
several senators noted that court mem-
bers are not supposed tn vote individually
on a case, but rather they are to come
to an agreement through discussion. The
Senators suggested that the Court be
balanced in membership to encourage
an attitude of trust in the Court and
olimltiata any suspicion of favoritism.

A Review —

'The Red Deserl"

By Sue Pransky

Oi The Red Desert, directed by
Michangelo Antonioni, a critic for The
New Republlc said, “it would be quite
a wrong emphasis, but one could say
that the trim is worth seeing for its
color alone." Antonioni focuses on the
neurotic and neglected wire or an elec-
tronics engineer (Monica Vitti). Tho
lactory town they live in irritates her,
and she is suffering from the shock of
an earlier automobile accident. The story
Concerns her brief love affair with a
mining engineer (Richard Harris). The
wife abruptly breaks off the relation-
sllip when she finds that her lover ll
not a catharsis for her mental state.

The technique of the film is directed
toward a penetran'ng vision or the in-
dividual's thoughts and feelings and his
relation to his environment, It is to
these ends that Antonioni makes his won-
derful, original, and unique use or color.

The Red Desert is the ltalian di-
rectors first color film; it was considered
a cinema breakthrough, Following it with .
his latest color venture, Blow-Up, Ann
[onioni has given new depth to the film
medium. The movie has been interl-
nationally acclaimed and should be
worth seeing both in of itself and an
