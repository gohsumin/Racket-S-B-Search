Court Rules Guilty
3 Get Conduct Pro

By HENRY WILHELM

In the first court case of the
year, two girls and one boy
were sentenced to one semester
of conduct probation for a “visi-
tation violation" by a joint ses—
sion of the Men’s and Women's
Primary courts. The boy was
caught “about haltway through
the window” of Haines Hall late
last Friday evening by the
w a t c h m a 11. He voluntarily
turned himself in to CofHP
President Bob Foote the next
morning. The girls involved
turned themselves in to AWS
Board President Karen Lauter-
bach.

The defendants pleaded guilty
to the charges against them
but asked that the penalty be
limited to conduct probation.
Karen Lauterbach had originab
1y suggested to the court that
in addition to conduct proba-
tion open dorm privileges for
the defendants should be sus-
pended ror a semester, but this
was dropped after deliberation.
The boy told the court that he
thought conduct probation would
be sufficient to deter him from
doing such a thing again. He
noted that the stated function
of the court is to be “preventa-
tive rather than punitive." its
added that in this case restrict-
ing open dorms would be “kind
of silly."

Lauterbach told the court that
this case was “just a matter or
illegal entry” and that there
were no extenuating circum-
stances. Karen told the session,
which was attended by Dean of
Men, Eugene Thompson, and
Dean of Women, Alice Low,
that the defendants “showed a
remarkable lack or judgment
and responsibility" in their ac-
tions. None of the defendants

Knopf, Economics, spoke to the
Senate. Knopf, former Chalr<

with curriculum evaluation.

Knopf's report dealt iirst with
recent faculty committee re~
ports on the curriculum. in 1964
an ad hoc faculty committee re-
ported that “much is wrong
with the senior comprehensive
examination, with the major
program as preparation for it
and with the senior year in gen-
eral.” Several other such
studies have been launched in
recent years, but except for the
study of Speciflc questions about
