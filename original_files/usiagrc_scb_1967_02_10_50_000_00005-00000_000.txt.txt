not one word about the Grinnell Aeroplane Com-
pany appeared in the Herald. It is known that in
August 1918, an exact duplicate of Robinson’s
engine -— manufactured by the Dodge Tool Com-
pany of Grinnell — was block tested at Dayton,
Ohio, for the Aircraft Division of the United
States Ordnance Department. A note attached to
that engine, which is now owned by Grinnell Col-
lege, sadly reports that “the Armistice was
signed before any decision was made concerning
air-cooled engines." Lacking Robinson’s spirit and
skill and unable to compete with the Curtisses
and Wrights, the Grinneli Aeroplane Company
faded from existence.

Grinnell has never iorgotten Billy Robinson.
In 1930, llle Herald ublished a letter from an
aviator who noted: t just struck me that the
late Wm. Robinson had more claim to fame than
most early birds After the two Wright brothers
and Glen Curtiss had by flight demonstrated
their respective models, endless copies were
made by people who made a living at country
meets until they were killed, as happened in

most cases, or till there was no money in the
game. However, while the planes were home-
made Contraptions, the power plant was invari-
ably bought from sonic manufacturer. Wm. Rob-
inson is the only other instance, beside the three
earliest birds, who made himself also the engine
that powered the plane. Sure line company to
have been in.”

The same year, Herald editor w. G. Ray
wrote of Robinson, “indeed next to his me-
chanical genius, the enthusiasm for his pro-
fession combined with unlimited courage was
the most prominent trait of his character.”
Two friends of Robinson still live in Grinneli.

Ml‘. Carl Child and Mr; Ross Colitis both remem-
ber Robinson as a mechanical genius.

Mr. Couits continues, “But he didn’t know
anything about business. if he had a dollar he
spent it on a gadget for his plane." .

"He was headstrong and hard to handle. i
remember when he finished his monoplane in
1914, he brought it downtown to have it weighed
on my scales. Why, he wouldn't let anyone touch
the plane except himself."

aeinre his death, Robinson had applied for
patents on his revolutionary light motor. These
patents were apparently never granted. It has
never been determined what happened to Rob-
inson’s plans and drawings, but an article in the
Herald in i918 pointed olit that the engine that
carried Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic in
1E27 was mighty similar to the one lhat ilew Billy
Robinson to indiana 13 years earlier,

situation: the possible basis for negotiations; the
international context; the Ky government and the
constitutional convention; military escalation and
bombings; and our ultimate objectives and in
tentions in Vietnam. In each case the Secretary’s
remarks did not differ significantly from the po—
sitions he has taken publicly on numerous occa-
Sions.
—— Geneva —

The secretary reiterated his pledge to “go to
Geneva tomorrow" if someone will be there to
talk peace with him and restated the “fourteen
points" (Dept. of State Bulletin, Jan. 24, 1966, p.
116) as the basis for any negotiated settlement.
He pointed to several recent alterations in the
Vietnam situation which he felt were encourag-
ing. These included the military and political
progress of the joint American-South Vietnamese
effort; the persistent interest of the Soviet Union
in favor of a prompt and peaceful resolution of
the Conﬂict; and the internal unrest in China
which may give Hanoi a freer hand with which to
negotiate.

In response to a comment by one of the stu-
dents that military dictators are seldom willing to
step down for a democraticallyrelected govern-
ment, the Secretary said, with a smile, that it
would be all the greater credit to Premier Ky
when he did.

— Continuation —

The Secretary confirmed what he has said re-
peatedly in public that the United States has no
desire to escalate the war effort and does so only
in response to increased aggression from the
North. The bombings were justified as a neces<
sary incentive to bring Hanoi to the conference
table.

The Secretary indicated that the US. has no
ulterior motives for being in South Vietnam. WI
are honoring a commitment, according to Mr.
Rush, and seek nothing other than the right of
selfoetermination for the South Vietnamese. He
feels failure to honor our commitment in Viet-
nam would undermine the worth of our word
throughout the world.

Rusk urged that further thought be given by
us to the concessions we would expect Hanoi to
make at the bargaining table and to the basin
question which he felt had receded too far into
the background, “How do you organize a durable
peace?”

The atmosphere was cordial, with a slightly
academic flavor as befitted a group of students
and an exrprofessor. The Secretary was most rec
ceptive to our opinions and was honest in his an-
awers to our questions

-—- Doubts Remained —-

Despite his candor and obvious sincerity, the
Secretary failed to alleviate the doubts of those
present. As our chosen spokesman, Bob Powell
of North Carolina, said in a press conference that
followed the Rusk meeting, “We had hoped that
Mr. Rusk would help us resolve our anxieties.
After our meeting with him, we regret to report
that he only confounded many of our misgivings
and generated many others.”

The general impression of the group was that
the United States is "clearly pursuing a military
solution" to the Vietnam problem and that, whiio
our leaders are sincere in their efforts to seek a
negotiated settlement, they are unwilling to make
the compromises necessary for that to be a real
possibility. In representing the opinion of the
group, Bob Powell articulated our fears that the
us. was unrealistically insisting on a “complete
surrender of the goals and ambitions of the other
side as opposed to a partial accommodation of
those interests“ at rid called the Secretary’l
“middle course” nothing more than a slow and
inevitable military escalation.

I think that the participants came out of the
discussion thinking pretty much the same as
when they went in. Those who previously had
been outraged at the Government’s policies con~
tlnued in their vehement protestations Those who
had been perplexed, as I had been, about the
course of action in Vietnam remained so. All
were concerned about Mr. Rusk‘s basic question,
“How do you organize a durable peace in the
world?” and somewhat distraught to find that
he and the Government seem no closer to an
answer than we are.

Comment On
Student Revolt

Iowa Governor Harold
Hughes and University of Iowa
President Howard Bowen were
quoted by the February 5 Du
Molnes Sunday Register in
supporting dissident American
youth in their revolt against
older generations.

Said Hughes in a speech at
Des Moines: “I believe that
young people feel that they have
been deceived and cheated by
having been fed a saccharin
folklore that doesn’t square with
the realities of a world that iii
tarnished by war, bigotry, pov-
erty, violence, materialism and
broken pledges.

“We have failed to tell them
the truth,” continued the gov—
ernor, “that there are no so-
lutlons, only the seeking or
tllem, and that this is what
iifeisabout." .

Speaking at the 0 rs mid-'
year commencement ceremoib
ies Saturday, Bowen, who is a
former Grinnell president, said.
“We need peace, racial har-
mony, a spiritual life and in-
dividuality. We need them
more than we need comfortable
suburban living, or a trillion~
dollar gross national product."
Bowen urged graduates to
"hold on to your discontents"
so that they may enact changel
when they move into position.
