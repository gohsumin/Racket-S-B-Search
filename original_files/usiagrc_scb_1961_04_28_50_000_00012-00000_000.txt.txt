The coming of the European
to Africa coincided with a
new orientation in education.
leading to new institutions. This
process has been conditioned by
five main factors:

1. The imperialists and colon-

lonial governments and white

minority populations have rev
acted in two ways with in
between variations.

First, the educational admine
lstl‘allon departments With neg-
ligible African representation,
have sought to regulate African
education on nictropolitian con—
cepts with no adaptation iieecs-
sai-y under African conditions.
Thus they ariogotcd to than»
selves the right to decide how
many Africans shall receive
education at uliich institutions
under what conditions.

Secondly. other gov'cl‘nmients
with a cynical power on and
the abuse of the African ap-

proach, have proclaimed educa-.

tion with an unfounded illusion
that it is “Western” to be the
monopoly of the white race and
have denounced the Afr an to
debasemcnt and indoctrination
in an attempt to enslave his
mentality and condemn him to
perpetual subjection. South At-
rica is a notorious example.

lin view of the foregoing
facts, my attitude takes con»
sideration of the following
points. I feel that political
independence and self.deterin-
initiation are a prerequisite for
full educational opportunities
for the African people, and
the struggle for their achieve—
ments should always bear this
in mind.

A democratic reallocation of
,resources, both before and after
independence, is a vital condi-
1tional for the equality of edu-

licrman said, in response t
a question, that a raise in th

stablished in African countries

baron says that students and

ialists in the early days, inter
ested only in economic and po-
litical exploitation. had no plans
for African education. The .efe
fects of their activities broke
down the indigenous orienta—
tion of African education, for,
by removing people from the
lands they conquered to labor

areas of their choice, they de—_

strayed the coherence of the see
eiety which was the basis of

that education.

As time Went on, the imperial-‘
ists and Colonialists discovered.

that to make exploitation more
efficient, it
give the Africans

ed the basic approach to Ali
can education in colonial Afr
rice,

2. The missionaries who pi .
ceded the imperialists. paving
the way for them accidentally
or by design, saw education as
a basic factor in thereonversion
of the African to Christianity.

Though this has also remai -
ed a substantial aspect of their
approach, the missionaries ex»
panded educational services for
the African more rapidly than
colonial governments, and ca
ried this responsibility for a
long tune with no sympathy
or subsidy from those govern-
ments,

For the role which the mis-
sionaries have played in At-
rican education we put on
record our grateful apprecia.

3. After the impact of
two factors above, the All-leans
were faced with the inevitabil-
ity of change, They discovered
in the new educational orienta-
tion positive
represented progress, These ele-
ments indicated a historical
process through which educa-
tion spread over
tries and civilizations, acquiring
new attributes, building up
heritage for mankind with no
respect to race, color, or creed.

The result was an active enr
thusiasm y Africans to further-
the cause of education, an ac-
tivc desire which has cxpi-css
cd itself through every sacii-
ficc and short to acquire edu—

The A.A.U.P, is a 47 year old,
as. elation with a membership
of 46,000 college and university
professors which has been a
vigorous fighter for academic
freedom in this country. The
organization investigates cases
which seem to violate principles
of academic freedom in colleges
and universities.

 

if they find actual violations,
the A.A.U.P. will censure the ad
ministration of these institutions
and will keep it on the cen-

Baron, such action has proved
to be quite effective.
