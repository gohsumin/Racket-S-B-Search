Thornton Explores Relationship
Between Psychology and Religion

Psychological insights into the
nature oi religion were explored
by G. l... Thornton, psychology,
in a lecture and discussion last
Sunday night.

Thornton cited four essential
components or religion. These
are recognition of a superior,
controlling force; the percep-
tion or man as subject to this
power; a need to understand
and explain man's position rel-
ative to this force; and appeals
to this supernatural torce for
assistance. support and guid-
once.

He then traced the role of
psychology in explaining re-
iigion, beginning with John Wat-
son, who denied the psychologi-
cal value of consciousness, thus
separating psychology (mm re-
iiglon. The acceptance ol evolu-
tion eliminated psychology, as
well as biologyi as a way to
understand man as a religious
being, Freud treated religion as
neurosis, an explanation not
very well accepted in theologi-
cal circles.

Thornton indicated that his
thoughts would be those of a be-
haviorist psychologist, saying
that “methods. logic, techniques
and skills that have proved ei-
iective in explaining and undeb
standing many areas of human
behavior can also be applied
with no apologies to the area
or religious behavior." The psy—
chologist attempts to under-
stand and predict human beha—
vior which the individual per-
ceives as being religious, taking
as an essential premise the tact
that all religious behavior is
learned and that there is no in-
stinctive religious impulse.

Religious experience, worship
and prayer were the three areas
of religious behavior discussed.
In the first case, Thornton cited
instances of a supernatural be«
ing communicating with man,
or oi man experiencing visions
or, more appropriately, halluci-
nations. Saul’s experience of en-
countering an earthly manifes<
tation of the supernatural force
can he explained in terms oi the
physical stresses produced by a
period oi extreme heat which
has been known to cause per-
ceptual distortions. It is noted
that visions are always cultur-
ally relevant. What is halluci-
nated is some foml of what is
already known to the person.
For instance, the most devout
Hindu mystic has never con-
jured up a vision or the Blessed
Virgin. Thornton also mentioned
the use of LSD and other drugs
as producing psychologically
and physiologically similar re-
sults.

“Worship as an overt mani-
festation of religion provides the
individual with the feeling that
he is instrumental in‘ some
small way in controlling a pow-

ertiil force which is seen as
both destructive and benevo-
lent," said Thornton. “The
signs and trappings or his re-
ligious group are powertully re-
iniorcing in that they provide
a source of identity. The acts of
his religion reinlorce and
strengthen his commitment to
his particular religious group.”
Such acts initially were a re
sponse to [ear and anxiety. A
cause and effect relation was
established between the per-
forming of a certain act and
the termination at a ieariul phe-
nomenon, such as a hurricane.
Prayer operates in the same
way. “Petitiunary prayers pera
sist, not because they are ‘an-
swered,’ but because they have
value as a psychological device
to reduce anxiety, provide se-
curity, and give the individual
the impression he is doing
something.”
