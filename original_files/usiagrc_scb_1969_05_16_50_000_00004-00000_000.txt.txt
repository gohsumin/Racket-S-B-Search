men and 30 women were selected as
student adviser-s for next year. The se<
lection committee, four resident advisers
and lour student advisers, tried to
choose a cr'usssectlon oi students. Al»
though looking for [lie qualities of “lile
iriaiive, dependability, flexnbility, anti
social sensitivity," they avoided stress-
ing any one personality type.

Each class has a nearly equal num

iii halls according to special abilities
and interests alter room drnwin ». Res
ident adviser Marilyn Cochran, chair-
man of the committee, noted that due to
the large number of qualilied applicants,
several highly recommended people
weren’t selected. She urged interested
students to reapply next year.

Several students told the 5&1} that
they think the S.A. selection committee
rejected them because of their lerrist
political beliefs. The sludenis indicated
that the committee probably believed
that there would be natural communi-
cation barriers between students ulth
leftist tendencres and their adviseesi

This Weekend two S.A. orientation ses-
sions were held in Darby andahe \Vom-
ens’ Gym, The selected students hecanre

tions, goals, and subtleties" oi the pro»
