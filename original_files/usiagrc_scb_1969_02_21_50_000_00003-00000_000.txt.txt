Gray on Scarlet and Black

Letter to the Editor:

It has been my policy, during
my tour years at Grinnell, to
air my grievances privately to
a small, but diminishing, group
or friends Having, however. ac-
quired the exalted rank of sen-
lot, I would like to take it upon
myself to comment upon the
quality. or lack of the same, at
writing and editing in the 5&3.

There are some publications
in which the style or writing
and content of the articles are
of such calibre that one is
tempted to overlook occasional
technical errors in the presen-
tation. This, alas, is not the
case with our student news
paper. While I realize that the
paper is put out by people who
are not necessarily accorm
plished editors or journalists,
this cannot overshadow the fact
that the paper, with last week‘s
edition serving as a prime ex—
ample, was incredibly poor in
its technica: aspects. While I do
not protess to be a protcssional
proofreader, I counted 14 errors
of a purely technical nature.
included among these was the
misspelling of 9 words.

Some of the other, more
notable, errors included two in-
coherent seniem‘es and one that
was totally insipid. In the form-
er category was that classic,

them. Different kinds of per-
sonalities show their owu in<
dividual ideas if given a chance
to, and may be anything but
political. But you begin to sense
that a lot oi people are saying
the same lands or things, only
in diiterent ways. The structure
of (the) movement could prnﬁb
nhly expand to include a few of
these difllﬂetlt viewpoints. You
might call it non—political revo<
lution.

was the most meaningful dem-
onstration as directed against
Brice Draper, representative or
Playboy, was tairly inellecu
tive." In the latter section came
the statement that President
Loggett would select a dean
from either inside or outside the
college (Page 1, Column 1). But,
lest l be accused oi nllpicking,
allow me to go on to examine
the content of the articles and
their point at View for, it seems
to me, a questioning oi this is
long overdue.

In the article “Implications
of Demonstration," it was noted
that members of the Woman’s
Liberation Movement and tho
Guerilla Theater met to decide
on action to be taken to show
opposition to the Playboy value
system, David Bryan supported
the protest and the form that it
took. Apparently not considered
by either the formulators of the
protest or the author of the arti<
cle was the rather old~lashioned
play or discussing opposing
Viewpoins in order to allow
those listening to make indivi-
dual value judgments. 1, my-
self, do not agree with many
aspects oi the Playboy ethic
but it I were unable to attack
its fallacies fully clothed, I
would consider my protest to be,
indeed, feeble

I would also like to comment
on the growing use of the pro-
noun “we" when the singular
"I" would seem to be mom
correct, Included here are
David Bryan, , . we thank
you, people." and David Lind-
hlom, “We suggest that the
attorney general get the hell
out oi Grinuell College . . I,
personally, neither thanked nor
suggested and I have talked
with many people who have had
trouble identiiymg this ethereal
"u ." I would suggest, in the
future, that care be taken to
present individual views as
such,

31200. To raise the needed
funds, benefit and donation
tables are being planned. On
Friday, Feb. 21, a folk and

inspired, allow me to comment
on the article on the sit»in at
the University or Chicago. I
was especially interested in the
four “non-negotiable” demands
of the students and the tactics
used to obtain their ends. It is,
it seems to me, a fine example
of the iascism oi the New Left.
This theory, that these stu-
dents are not far-removed from
their generation in Berlin in the
1930's, is receiving much at-
tention and consideration (all of
it coming, no doubt, tram the
true Nazi pigs). 1 was also
struck by the name of the or-
ganizing group of this sit-
the ‘Commitiee of 85' I would
suppose they drew their inspira-
tion from that liberal and hu<
manitarian ‘Committee of Pub-
lic Saiety' which so efficiently
ran France alter their revolu<
tion.

There are other areas which
deserve comment but which a
lack of time and space force
me to pass by. Nonetheless i
hope that my comments may
provoke some change in the
format at the 5&3.
