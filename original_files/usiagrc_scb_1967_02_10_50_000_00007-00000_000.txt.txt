An Interview With Nadas

The Artist in Person

pus last week, Nadas talked
freely about his mission as an
artist and teacher.

Teaching, says the well-
imuwn pianist, is more than
simply giving piano lessons. “1
am interested in my students
as human beings, not just as
mobile lBM cards, .Every
teacher is a counselor. You
can‘t detach yourself In cold
blood from the very essence
or your students, who are hu-
man beings needing guidance.
That doesn’t mean that you
have to become deeply involv-
ed in the students’ problems,
but you have to do more than
simply ignore them."

Teaching, he continued, must
be a contact between human
personalities, since the devela
opment or artist and human
being must go hand in hand.

—Concert Performance—

Being a concert pcriormer,
to him, is a way of life to
which one is called, rather
than a profession which is
chosen. “Being an artist de-
mands a great deal of intro-
spection, humility, and dedica-
tion to your art. That leaves
no time to feel proud, con<
ceited, or superior to your fel-
low man...

“I’m only the wire that trans-
mits the message. People are
not interested in whether the
wire is made of copper or
zinc or aluminum or iron.
They’re interested in what the
message is. In interpreting a
masterpiece. the artist must
search thoroughly and humbly
and honestly to see what the
composer wants."

—-Formal Training—
Nadds began his rormal

piano training at the age ol
ten in Budapest, Hungary. In

three years he was ready for
the government-operated acad-
emy. The work there was rig<
omus, and the competition was
fierce. In tour years, piano
students were expected to learn
all 32 or Beethoven’s piano
sonalas, Bach's complete key-
hoard works, and 16 piano con-
certi—all memorized

To enter the academy at
such an early age, Nadas had
to get special permission from
the Minister of Public Educa-
tion to complete hls high school
education by means of private
tutor; one oi the conditions was
that he had to finish in the
upper lo per cent or his class.
High school tor a Hungarian
youngster included trigonomet-
ry. chemistry, physics, inte-
gral and diilerential calculus,
eight years or Latin, eight
years or German, and four
years of either French, Italian
or English. Nadas chose Eng-
lish. Every year, a state exam
was required, which consisted
of two days of written examr
inatlons and two days of orals.

At the same time, while lie
was spending his days at the
academy and his evenings with
his tutor, he studied piano with
Bartok.

Alter his graduation from the
academy, Nadas was captured
by the gestapo and spent three
years in a concentration camp
in Austria. He was one of 140
to survive out of 28,000.

—Transilion—-

After World War ll he went
to Italy and 1mm there to
South America, He was first
head of a piano master class
in Caracas, Venezuela. and
later director of one of the
national conservatories. in 1952
he was invited by Loyola Uni-
versity, in New Orleans, to be
artist in residence and head
or the piano department, He
has spent the past seven years
at San Francisco State College.

In addition to private piano
lessons, Nadas teaches a course
in piano literature and gives
many lectures on various com-
posers at San Francisco State
and elsewhere. He believes in
spontaneity as opposed to the
“Cerebrullsm” of a lecture
planned to the Smallest details.

People, says Nadas, are the
