JOHN MARTELL

John Marlell, resident advisor
for Cowles and Dibble, [eels that
Grinneil’s main shortcoming is
isolation and the “small college
paternalism" that accompanies
institutional living.

Martell, who earned his BA.
and MA. in English Literature
at Western Michigan University,
tavors apartment living because
it enables students to set their
own standards as they must in
later liie.

increased open dorms would
be ai improvement over existing
conditions, he asserted, caution-
iiig, however, that opens and
women’s hours are trappings
that distract lroni the real prob-
lem: “that it’s institutional liv-
ing "

Unlortiinately, he continued, it
is apparently impossible in Grub
Hell’s ease to eliminate the insti~
tutionalism.

or present conflict between

student leaders and administra-
lion he said, “i don’t think it's
a matter of the administration
trying to suppress the students."

Martell sees his "somewhat
nebulous position of resident ad-
visor" as a counseling iunction
although “we’re not trained as
psychiatrists." He is available
to discuss problems with stu-
dents who don‘t want to talk
with administratinn or other
students.

”The resident advisur,” he
stressed, “is not a policeman or
a spy for the administration.”

said he thought residents
were a good idea, especially
for the residents. About Grinnell
he had this to say: “There

In tact, the whole school would
be great it they put it on a dolly
and wheeled it off to Cam-
bridge." Joe has had some an-
nual stories published. When
asked it they were for Children
or adults, Joe replied, “or
course, they’re for adults. Kids
are too young [or animal stor-

“porn" books. Adults already
know too much about sex; they
