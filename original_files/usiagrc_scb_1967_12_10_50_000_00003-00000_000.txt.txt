GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

AS everyone must know by now, South emerged victorious in
the volleyball wars by deieating North and Rawson in what was
a rather close race. The Victory was the first in recent years for
South in sports or major importance. Their best previous finish
was second in The Civil War but, of course, Tommy Gillespie
didn’t play tor them in that one.

Wednesday marked the opening and closing of the T, M. bad-
minton tournament. Last. year’s champion, Phil (Barrel-Bod)
Woodward, returned to defend his championship against the one
slailghl of other profiment birdie batterers. I was asked to be in
attendance when they threw out the first bird but it was ﬁnally
decided I would be too heavy for the racquets so I was excused
from participation.

 

The iinal week or college bowling rolls around with only three
points separating the top three teams. Six games will be bowled
today to determine team and individual standings. Rick
Wickstrom had a 599 to take over the high series and the team
captained by Dave Noith staged a late season rally to take over
first.

After being threatened by physical Violence and mental har»
rassment, I have deemed it advisable to retract my statement of
last Week which referred to Bruce Rollins as an oak tree that
jumps like a pogo stick. I personally thought it was a great com-
pliment but, if it is not appreciated, so be it. Let me say instead
that he is a ti - and blood human being with reelings and emoa
lions and sensitivities and desires and muscles and tendons and
ligaments and toes and arms. In other word, he is just like the
rest of us; only more so.

since this is the last issue of the semester, i would like to
thank my vast reading audience tor the tremendous support they
have given me during the trying times through which I have
stmggled. It’s not easy to stay at home and write when I could
be out obstructing traffic. or breaking laws, or going to the Pizza
Pub, or going into a drilgrinduced trance, or attacking townies.
Without your loyal support, I would not have resisted temptation.
But I did, thanks to you, Mother. Now may I have enough money
for bus Tare home?

SATURDAY IN DARBY

ROOT WINS, PIONEERS LOSE

By A GIRL STAFF WRITER

As a part at Saturday evee
ning’s entertainment in Darby
Gym, Homecoming Queen Cindy
Root slashed out a badminton
game with Coach Gene Kowert.
Attired in a yellowmgrwhite 2
piece outiit, Coach Gene came
in a notrtooeclose second. The
iinal score was 114, Cindy’s
favor. _

Cindy (”wuiv, she plays bad-
minton, too") Root quickly had
the support of the audience be-
hind her. !n a perky white
tennis dress, Cindy’s motions
were quick and frisky.

Before and alter the bad-
minton game, a few highlights
or the evening’s entertainment
were provided by the Grinnell-
C u l v e r Stockton basketball
game. With a iinal score or
92-86, Grinliell did it again;
LOST, The time reading on the
scoreboard at the game‘s close
was the immortal “00:00 ”

Starting with a horn similar
to the ”Charge” bugle call in
the Houston Asti'odnme, the
fighters take their sides. No. 24,
Mike Schwartz, is first to touch
the ball. Treasure the moment.
After passing it about a while,
it was promptly returned to
him, because he had it first,
and he made the first red
(Grinnell) basket. The first foul
was called on 41, Tony Robert-
son, ot the opposition. (Yay,
Pilgrims—er, Pioneers!)

In spite of calls of “foul"
play, though, the game was
played pretty iairly. The two
teams even traded sides every
time one had a chance to excel.

Next, the oppositions Wayne
Puckett made a basket, and
then Grinnell’s Terry Holloway,
you see, they took turns like
that.

Terry Holloway later made a
drop shot, that was. according
to an audience member behind
me, “beautiful."

Schwartz then decided to get
the ball out oi the way, so he
hit it to the blue. whereupon
their Tony Robertson promptly
made a basket. Schwartz de-
serves at least some of the
credit for his teamwork in mak
ing the ball go through.

If you like long-shots,
Schwartz provided a couple. He
also provided Culver with a iew
touishots by hitting the ball out
or the guy’s hand while shoot-
ing, so these pretty much can-
celled each other out.

Thor Evenson provided a very
pretty shot when he, in juxtapos-
ing himself so as not to go Out
of bounds with the ball, swayed
a little, and then hit the ball
in backwards for a basket. Ev-
enson was virtually under, it
not behind the basket, but it
Went in.

A foul was called on Hollo-
way when he bounced the ball
on his foot. Now why would he
want to do that?

Evenson later put in a good!

longrshot, and as ever, the im-
partial ball switched sideS,

One spicy tidbit or advice
emerging from the blue coach
(now turning purple) was “You
oughta hit him, Tony."

Whell the red ball was later
swiped by blue—he took it out
of Ted's hands, the cry rose
up from the red sidelines, “what
to ya hafta do, draw blood,
Ref?”

From the benefit of my knowl-
ege concerning those clever
reieree signals. I shall pass onto
the dear reader a couple. Ral-
ling one’s hands around each
other repeatedly, as it ravel-
ling yarn, means "travelling,”
and when the relerree starts
waving both hands at you, it's

just his way of saying “Hi.”-

Later the relerree made a
chopping motion at his arm

with his right hand, that looked
like something vulgar. By the

groans when he did, it, I think
it was. . .

made by Grinnell’s Roger Able

TIiE iiIDITZED

By JOHN iiAz

The inability oi the beginning bridge player to successlully
convey to or solicit irom his partner the illegal intormation so
necessary to his game, can only be regarded within the context or
his more general inability to perlorm the simplest of decisions ot-
tered by the more elementary problems oi the game.

Both are characterized by a certain impetuosity which is
given to his libidinous drives rather than his more rational facul-
ties (SIC). It is the former inability that this iinal column will
serve to redress.

First. strategy must be contemplated. If you want your part-
ner to take a particular action and it the communication of that
action is illegal and thereiore gaining ior your side an uniair ad-
vantage (cheating) it is best that you not tell him directly. tor
the opponents may overhear, and if they do mind, surprise on
you, there are penalties ior your behavior.

The correct strategy, then. is to be discreet — give your part-
ner subtle hints, interences which he will hardly be able to ignore
and which will guide him into the proper action.

For example, consider all the possible bids available to you
at a given bid. If you are discreet. these should include the hesi—
tating pass, the hopeless pass, the disgusted pass. the lightning
pass. the vacillating declaration, the ﬁrm declaration, the bounce

up and down and smile at the opponents declaration, the “John,
come look at this hand declaration," the I think I’ll double. the
hairpin trigger double. the I’ll iix you double. the ominous re-
double, the I'll get back at you redouble and the daggers irom the
eyes rescue bid. Think of the possibilities ior creative expression.

Or if you want your partner to lead a particular suit just as
he is pulling out the wrong card to lead, drop your hand on the
ﬂoor and Say (as you pick up the cards), “don't wait for me,_
I'm playing small."

If he doesn’t get the message pull a card out or your hand
and stare at the dummy until someone at the table is so rude as
to interrupt your deep concentration. Undauntedly think, one, two,
and say “Oh, what’s the lead?” replace the card, play to the
trick and go back to staring. if he still doesn’t get the message
take a card, preterably a low one and insert it under the me
vioiisly played cards. When declarer or partner picks up the trick
ask to see it again and carefully remove a prearranged speck of
dirt irom your card.

or course these examples although uselul are only particua
lars, and a general case. a catch-all method, is needed to come
bat all of the possible conditions under which an inierence is
needed. To this problem, I have iound a simple solution in which
the beginning player need perform only a simple operation. Next
to the “WE-THEY" column construct a crude scaiiold as in the
diagram. Whenever your partner makes or attempts to make an
incorrect bid or play. Raise the pencil in your hand. If he is per.
sistent, each time he makes an error add a limb to the stick man.
Although this iigure is usually used in a different context, it is
appropriately named “Hang the Butcher,” Think oi the possibili-
ties for creative expression. Think of two beginners with separate
scoring pads.
