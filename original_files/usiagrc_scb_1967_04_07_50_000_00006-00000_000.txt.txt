Friday. April 1. my

Hughes and the legislators—

By Craig Allin

Governor Harold Hughes and six
prominent legislators descended on Grin~
neil yaterday tor the fourth State Legis-
lative Seminar.

The tripartite seminar consisted of
two panels and dinner remarks by the
Governor. The afternoon session was de-
voted 00 "Motor issues at the 1967 IOWA
General Assembly — The Legislamr'l
View."

Director at Program in Practical Po-
littcol Education Edwin Gilmour set the
tone for the seminar by suggesting that
the participants were present at can
slderablo expense to themselves and to
the legislature. It was apparent that
most enjoyed the vacation.

The first session witnessed thl are
pected emphases: Democrats for strong
administration and Republicans tor leg-
lslative process,

High points of the afternoon were the
persistent attempts oi Maurice Barin-
ger, Speaker at the Iowa House, who
was billed as "a 45 year old business-
man with A Master’s degree," to cast
doubt on his credentials. in response to
a point by Senator Frommelt Mr. Bar-
inger proffered, “Democracy is govern-
ment as close to the people as possible."
No one asked how the voter could be ef-
leciiva at the county level but Lieuten<
ant Governor Fulton accomplished the
same noble purpose with a vehement "I
say baloney!"

The dinner remarks oi Governor
Hughes possessed considerable more
dignity. He praised legislators at both
parties, He defended the student's right
to tree expression but called for contribu-
tlon rather than protest.

The evening session was a partisan
freeior-all. There was general agroe~
rnent on the need for more stat! and to
Search facilities for legislators. Tho Gov-
ernor's reason: “I think they’d be bets
ter iniormed and agree more.”

Senator Rigler argued that all the staff
in the world would not help as much as
electing Republicans. Nor was speaker
Baringer idle. When Senator Rigier
asked the Governor “Why don’t. you
admit your mistake and come back to
our party?", the Speaker was heard to
mutter “He couldn’t win the primary."
