HARD TO PLEASE

A poll was conducted to de-
termine what were student exe
pectatiuns oi the Sim tor the
coming year. some opinions
follow:

“I expect worthwhile caver-
age or campus sports; that
kind at thing is important.

“First and foremost, an in
Sightiul analysis of all national
news. Number two, ~(lDOi' to
door delivery.”

“I expect publications of
quite a few opinions contem-
ing campus altaitrs H like a
sectinn at the paper where
people can feel completely
tree to express any npiniun
they have. And l think it
would be guild ii there were
some public cnmmunicatian
between administration and
raculty on problems."

“I’d like to see analysis and
coverage of campus events
And i hope they'll cover nation-
al events and have nationally
syndicated columns."

“I‘d like in see a conglom-
eratinn of three things: edi-
lorials involving umpus and
off—campus issues, lactual ac-
counts of what‘s going on in
the world, and some tor-m oi
creative writing.”

“I would like tn see a paper
that covers the issues an carn-
pus as opposed to a major em-
phasis being put on national
events. I would like to see at-
ticles that stimulate discussion
on campus issues.“
