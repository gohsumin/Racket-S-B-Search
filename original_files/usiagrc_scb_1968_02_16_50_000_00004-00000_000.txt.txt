heads and bodies of the Cau-
casians. it must be clarified
here that most of the men who
were now in the middle of this
chaos were men who were guilty
or nothing more than coming
ll'om their jobs to eat the noon
meal and in so doing were
trapped in the melee.

FUN BEGINS BELOW

Alter the Negro population
were herded into their respec-
tive housing units and were
locked in cells, the fun began
in the lower yard. There in the
middle of the football field, 700
to 1,000 convicts were shot at
without mercy. There is no real
cause for it as there is nothing
in the center of that field which
could have been damaged.

Nine (9) men were Shot alive
and wounded. The report later
stated that “these men were
hit by glancing bullets” (boun-
cing on the soft mud that was
on the field). I am sure combat
veterans could argue that paint,
or even a human Late that
night the men were back in their
cells (a job that could have
been accomplished in several
hours at the most). In the
weeks that iollowed Custody

is no real reason for it other
than it appeared the hacks

BIG RED ARRIVES

Several months after the Jan-
uary riots, Warden Wilson was
relieved and Big Red Nelson
(now Warden) was transported
to the scene, Mri Nelson has a
record of being one oi the hard-
est wardens in the country. He
boasts dictatorship and iron.
grip rule. He has bragged puha
licly oi it. He stated upon ar-
rival his intention to make San
Quentin a sale place to live.

Since his elevation to Warden,
beatings, killings and harass-
ment have almost doubled. The
population is going up and ten-
sioli is the biggest thing so iar
created. A milliomlollar pro
gram which offered hope to
thousands or convicts, through
rehabilitation, was stopped at
the snap of Red Nelson's lin-
gers, , . ile overrode Legisla-
tion and many other men higher
up than himself to do this.

PRISONS AND PROFITS

Prison industry, in theory at
least. is not supposed to com<
pete with the private sector of
the economy. Products of con«
vict labor, again in theory, go
only to government agencies.

This should be true of the
cotton textile mill at San Quen-
tin, but a document liberated
by inmates from prison ac-
counting records shnws that con-
vict work sometimes has other
uses They call it slave labor:

Now here is an interesting
little item which substantiates
our charge of slave labor and
larceny, to say nothing of mis-
appropriation oi state property.
It is a sales receipt made out
to:
Sanka Corporation,

EVERYONE GETS BILKED

Now this little transaction
caused an awful lot of people
to be bilked. There was first
and ioremost the taxpayer who
paid {or the cotton mill, the
ioreman’s salary, the raw cot»
ton, etc. The private manu-
facturers were bilked because
they cannot compete with sub-

sidized slave labor working with
statenwned m a t e ria l s, and
last but not least were you tela
low convicts who must Work for
such degrading wages.

I do not exaggerate when i
say that material could not be
made tor 30 cents a yard lie-
cause the raw unginited cotton
it is made from costs more than
that. now. I ask you, could any
private business under our
“iree” enterprise system com-
pete with such as this?

Now, everything. materials.
lalior, and machinery has been
paid out oi tax dollars and the
tinished products are supposed
to be made available to state-
operated institutions. Tell us.
Mr. Thorp, is the Sanlto Cor-
poration oi Osaka, Japan, a
state agency of some sort? 1
think Not.
