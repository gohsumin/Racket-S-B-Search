Responsibility and the rules

It's ll difficult thing for students to make tlle transi7
tion from home, where rllles are understood because tlley
are established on a personal basis which allows flexibility,
l-nd college where 1200 persons must live ill close pro. imr
i’v under rules which oftentimes seem to have no meaning
ior the individual.

. CASE 1N POINT is the hours rule which is llCCeSSlr
thed by the fact tllat the college is l‘ sponsibile for
safety and reputation of its students as well as its own
leputation as their lrdiall. I don't believe any Grinnell
:.tlm'listrator is illterc tell ill seeing the hours lllles obey
ed fol any other reason.

They agree that students must be allowed to make
their own deci
r lere those decisions involve the responsibility of the col-
lege.

However, tlle college cannot expect students to help
meet this responsibility unless it respects their own sense
what is right and wllat is wrong.

Valid suggestions for rule changes collie only from a

n ajoi'ity of those involved—in this case the students who

e under them, the parents who make it possible for their

children to do so and the friends of the college who further
slpport it.

But as long as rules exist they nlust be obeyed.

It the rule is unrealistic, such as the drinking: rule
seems by many to be, then it should not be broken
bllt should be changed through effort ill the proper
manner.

The “proper manner" is not to argue that a rule
“cannot” be obeyed alld then prove it by not adhering to
I But, to argue that the rule "should not" be obeyed and
obtain a majority opinion. A campus referendum is the
first step in this direction.

BUT NO INDICATION of what the campus thinks
“should” be done will be respected by the Administration
Lnless a sense of responsibility is shown toward obeying
the rules which exist now.

The drinking rule is not being enforced properly. Hall
presidents who run on the nonrelltol-cement ticket are tak-
-ing the easy and wrong Way around an unpopular rule.

Despite the fact that the Administration has said
no to extension of hours and to a change ill the drink-
ing rule. the possibility for change in the future re»
mains.

There has been considerable discussion of the initiation

of honor plans to stimulate student responsibility towardl

rules.

The proponents of those plans are, first of all, asking~
the majority of Grinnell students to reaffirm attitudes
which they already hold and which are a direct result of
the type of education which Grinnell oli‘ers.

SUCH AN AFFIRh‘IATION is valueless, except for
college publicity reasons, and is insulting to the student
who is attempting to live according to his own, sincerely
formulated standard of conduct. The students who would
l'lolate cul ellt regulations will violate an honor code
VIS‘t as e: ily.

But what the proposer: of the codes are over-
looking most (if all is (llili there is no universal per
sonal standard of student behavior. Ullirer ll behavior
can only be regulated by rules and so it is the rules
themselves which lllold student attitudes, not the re-
verse.

IT SHOULD BE the responsib tr of the strident gm
ernment and the administl tioll to turtlier investigate the
d 'llking rule and the possibility of extension 01‘ hours so
that they might present students with rules which not
only “should” be obeyed but which “can” be obeyed by
every Grinnell student because he sincerely feels that lie
is doing so for his own good and for the good of the com—
lnllllity. '

Horwal-iL sugges’rs procedure
\ for changing regulations

By Mike llorwatt

In i-ccciil weeks there has been
a barrage of protest against wo-

this CritiClsm has been directed
toward the AWS Board. Foi-
they are his governing
