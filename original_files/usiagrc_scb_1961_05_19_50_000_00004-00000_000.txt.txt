Mi: McManus and Mr Hunt
are included in such groups as
“Believers in US. foreign poli-
Cy,” “Sluggers of CofHP mem—

Of course, this is only a small
sample of the number of groups
that reside among the lump sum
oi lost). The number of groups
here, “the other 20," would pro-
bably be relatively as large.

In fact, it seems to me that it
we must divide people up, we
might as well go all the way.
I think that i would come out
with far more groups than peo
ple. But this is all relative and
probably quite personal.

The problem comes when you
demand stratification oi groups.
When one group starts to exclude
another. then i think it is time
to make diVlsions as I have done
above. Then, because it somehow
happened that there is only one
person in each ot the groups, 1
have suggested. to advocate class

separation would be to demand‘

personal isolation

I offer a new commandment:
Let not one class differentiate
against anotherr Differentiate not
lest you be differentiated We
must do this,
brotherhood.

You see i have this strange
aversion that I must conquer; I
feel like writing a letter to the
Register and telling the world
not to worry, most of us aren’t
