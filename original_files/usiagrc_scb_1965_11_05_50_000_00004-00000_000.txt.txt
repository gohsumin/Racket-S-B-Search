Knox-Monmouth Rivalry Inspires Pranks

By PAUL BRADLEY

For the last month the Univer-
5in of Rochester has been having
security problems. In October such
incidents as an attempted rape, a
town and gown ﬁght, and frater-
nity quarrels were not prevented
or even broken up by the college
Pinkerwna.

M I result of these and other
[domains the school is now plan—
lips to double its force oi Pinker-
tm guards on patrol at night, has
appointed a permanent group of
bouncers to function at troteriiity
parties, has decided to ban beer

blasts, and niied that only guests
can attend fraternity parties.

Two professors at M.I.T. have
refused to sign oaths of loyalty to
the Constitution of the United
States and Massachusetts They
oppose the Massachusetts state
law requiring all applicants for
teaching position to sign such an
oath.

They an new soliciting funds to
take the case to the Massachusetts
State Superior Court where they
hope the oaths will be declared un-
constitutional. The professors claim

the state should not discriminate
between teaching and other pro-

fessions.

Every year, the week before the
annual football game between
arch-rivals Knox and Monmouth is
ﬁlled with all sorts of pranks. This
year Knox made a special eiiort
in that direction,

On the Wednesday before the big
battle, the Bronze Turkey. the
trophy given to the winner at the
annual classic. was stolen from
Monrnouth’s trophy case. No re-
taliatiou took place the next day.

Friday morning a Knox mock
edition of the Monmouth Oracle
was delivered to Monmouth stu-
dents. The ialse Oracle was printed
on the back of that week's Knox
Student and was clever enough to
fool many. That afternoon Mon-
mouth made up a fake Student
and delivered it to Knox students.
Knox retaliated with a rain of tur-
key leathers nn the Monmouth
football iield where the game was
to be played the next day.

Finally the big game took place,
the Siwashers beating the Scots
14-6.

Obviously, Old: 4-4-2 crammed for its ﬁnals. It masters miles with a 400-cubic7inch V-B,
Alt-barrel carb and a rumbling pair of pipes. Cools corners with heavy-duty suspension
and front and rear stabilizers. Goes to the head of its class with the sportiest conﬁguration
ever to top four red-line tires. All this, and straight A’s in economics, too. . .
