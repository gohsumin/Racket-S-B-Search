A POP IN THE CORN

We enjoyed Convocation. We didn’t enjoy the lines, the score
of the football game. the early ending of a rather undanceable
Dance, or having Saga workers and Requiem people miss many

events.

But for most people, most 01 the time, there was something

to learn, to amuse. to move.

Convocation knocked Grinnell off its usual apathetic strlde. ‘

Students reacted to the change. The Peace‘Raliy was an exciting
successr Offrcampus parties ﬂourished. We lived a different life

. . r for three days.

in a week or so, Convocation will just be a memory: I heard
this one, talked to that one, got drunk with the other.

It was it oneshot thing. A big pop in the corn.

We’d better get back to the books . . .

A STUDENT OPINION

ENLIGHTENMENT FROM OONVO

By HERBERT U. PEGUES

one historian has said, “it is
historical fact as well as bio-
logical theory that the past—of
ten the distant past—lives on in
the present."

This resounding idea hung
over the heads of hundreds this
past weekend. Some ignored it;
to others it was a shocking re-
ality, and still others, a true
awareness

The historical links were put
beinre you so plainly. i need
not repeat the slavery of the
Negro and countless injustices
toward him for some 348 years.
These in a nutshell are facts
that have bred the forms of
racial uproar in America to
hay.

This is why the Negro thinks
the way he thinks, this is why
he lives the way he does, and
this is why he revolts the way

he does. Hopefully you know
all Americans, both black and
white, suffer the consequences
oi past and present "America
the free."

Admittedly. there are some
redeeming tactors. We can 0v»
ercome the grim historical re~
minders, or at least lessen
their severity, by reevaluating
our value system. Salvation
lies in your own mind. Wisdom
is a wonderful thing.

out in all your getting, you
must get understanding. All of
you really needed those racial.
1y oriented topics or the Con-
vocation, if just for peace of
mind. The intellectual Grinnell,
with the rest of America, can-
not rise above itself without un-
derstanding, the God — given
rights of all humanity. All men
are equal, as human beings,
under the sun.

loclal progress is that legisla-
Iion cannot change people's
morals; you have to change
the heart. “The law cannot re-
strain the heartless, but it can
prevent them from lynching
me,” the Baptist mlnis~
ler mused.

The last myth assumed by
the sleepers, is that the Negro
can lift himself by his boot~
straps. Like the other imml~

ant groups coming tn the

.S., the Negro should be able
10 help himself.

“No other group has had
their color made a social stig-
ma. It is a cruel last to tell a
bootless man to lift himself up
by his bootstraps."

Riots, King cited, are neith-
er the most practical nor the
most moral way But condemned
the conditions oi today that have

The next issue of the 5&5

People today seem more con-
cerned with “quietude, and
the status quo, than to help ni-
leviate them"

The immorality oi the Viet-
Nam war, and the possibility
of its leading to a third World
War constituted King‘s next
comment.

in justifying his link between
the civil rights and the anti-
war movements, King said that
it is silly to be concerned about
integrated schools, and not be
concerned about the survival
01 the world to be integratedl

“These people are maladjust-
ed in society, but there are cer-
tain aspects of society that
should always merit maladjust-
meni.

Jesus Chlist was maladjust-
ed when he stated that “he who
lives by the sword shall perish
by the sword," King concluded.

not sleep during a social revo-
lution, should be created the

I would like to comment
briefly on Mr. Marquardt's and
Mr. Tice‘s column in the Oct.
27 5&3. They refer to the seven
required courses envisioned in
the Curriculum Report as “lec-
ture courses.”

Even a hasty reading of the
report indicates, in my opinion,
that most required courses
would be taught in small sec-
tions, The proposed Humanities
course, for example, would
continue the work of the pres-
ent one, which is now taught
in sections averaging 18 stu-
dents. Emphasis in this course
is on literary analysis in depth
through the frequent writing of
papers which are thoroughly
criticized by the instructor,
and through conferences. (1
can testify that l have had stu~
dents in that course who ap-
proached literature in greater
depth than did some juniors
and seniors; hence I would
never call the course vague
and impersonal.)

Likewise the language cours-
es envisioned in the report (as
those now taught) would be of-
fered in small sections; and
the Social Studies and Humani-
ties In (Fine Arts) course!
would also involve work done
in sections.

1 am not here defending the
specific proposals of the re-
port; but I thought it might be
usetul to have someone not
connected with the committee
point out what seems to be a
factual inaccuracy in the col-
umn of Mr. Marquardt and Mr.
Tice.

To The Editor:

Circulating on our campus is
n criminal element which pro-
poses to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of the Bulshevik
Revolution which will occur on
November 7th. in anticipation
or this event, may 1 rec-
ommend a viable alternative
to those of us here at Grinnell
who do not tind wearing red
stars, brandishing posters of
Lenin and Trotsky, and drink-
ing vodka, to their political
taste.

it is ironic that Novem-
ber 7th just happens to be the
day before November 8th. No«
vember Hill of this year—inter-
estingly enough — commemort
ates the fortyrfourth anniver-
sary of the Munich Beer Hall
Pulsch which was the first mil-
jor attempt by the thenstmg-
gling National Socialist Ger-
man \Vorkers’ Party to attain
political prominence.

Needless to say, the whole at-
lair was a sham, but the fact
that this became a red letter
day in Nazi Germany replete
with the old-line guard partici-
pants oi the event marching
down towards the shrine of
those who liatl fallen in 1923.
leads me to believe that some
here at Grimtell might find this
the perfect antithesis to the
Russian Revolution!

Any number 01 those inter-
ested may participate. All that
will be needed to commemor-
ate this glorious throwback of

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Neil Fitch!

Conscientious administrators and functionaries are constantly
doing their duties here at Grinneil.

They protect college property from misuse and abuse

They keep the college running . . . like water , . . m‘ It ,
machine

Their public relations techniques for improving the Grinnell
image are timeless and without measure.

Someday I’d like to swing a column in their praises. But this
week they ought to be cut down.

Somewhere in the midst of their concern for college prop-
erty and their concern for Grinnell P.R.. they have lost nil
concern for the general welfare of the students who live here.

Convocauon offered a case or two in point:

Now it's nice to feed all the trustees on time. and it's nice to
make a good impression on the alumni.

But it‘s even nicer to reed Saga workers, and It the Quad
that simply didn’t happen during Super Weekend.

"By the time we had time to eat." one Quad waiter told me,
"all that was left were a few stale Danish pastries, I had to miss
three meals straight so I could help lat alums feed their faces.”

One hell of a lot of Saga workers and Verdi Requiem par.
formers were finagied into weekend work and rehearsal scheduler
precluding any benefit from Convocation.

“Martin Luther King got to see more of Grinneli Convocation
than i did," a student Requiem singer stated, “and he was only
here a few hours,"

Said another Quad worker. “Some girls worked breakfast all
morning. were given a whole half-hour for I break, and then had
to work lunch for two hours"

Lack of admirdstrative concern for student welfare, horr-
ovtr, isn’t just an accident or one busy weekend.

About two weeks ago, Cleveland freshman Louise Peick had
the misfortune to trip and cut the side of her head open in the
Forum music room.

Witnesses said they thought she was about to go into shock,
In they made her lie down on the floor.

And we all know what happens when you lie down on the
floor in the Forum.

Immediately the forces of concern (for college property, that
in) surged into action

The "Forum Lady" -— that is to say. the lady who work:
the desk and makes people keep their shoes on and sit up straight
(the epithet has the same connotation as "Avon Lady" or “Fullei
Brush Man”) — instantly arrived to console Louise.

Quoth the “Forum Lady," according to one witness:

“I’m sorry you cut your head open, but could you please
try not to bleed on my carpet?”

Quoih Louise: “I really wasn’t thinking about where I was
bleeding at the time.” ’

I understand that college telephone operators are just it little
busier these days than they were at the beginning of November
last year.

They are busy because they are still looking up telephone
numbers for students.

They are still looking up telephone numbers for students
because the Herd Books haven’t been printed yet.

”Why haven’t the Herd Books been 11th yet?” you
nsk. “Why aren‘t the new 1937-68 analogues out yet?”

Well, yoii know. I’d ask Mrsr Prescott over in Public Rela-
tions about that, but I’m afraid she‘s still a little tired from
pumping out Convocation schedules, Convocation programs. Com
vocation booklets, and Convocation news releases.

But now that Super Weekend is bagged, maybe she can work
I little on something to help students here —like a catalogue or I
herd book.

Now that the slums are gone, maybe Sage will have time
to feed Saga workers too.

Now that the college is a college again and not just I
convocation cluster, maybe it can begin looking out for its
college students.

Anyway, if you crntlr your skull in the Forum try to keep
your blood off the carpet, will you? Because they’ll probably
raise my tuition to pay 3er for cleaning it up.
