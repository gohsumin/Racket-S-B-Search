Cohan promised what Grinnell students have long beenl
tiliuliing about: an end to llypocri 3/, rules which agree
with nlodern Americnn moral standards. Collon, like lhe‘
other three candidates, campaigned for an office which

seemingly invoted an ultimatum to the ndmillistration:
“in the event that student proposals are vetoed, I think
it would be obvious that there is no student government.”
Cohen since that time has compromised his platform, and

Radio and tclcvrsiou can no more replace new

At Grinncll the situation is different Thc

the only “formal dialogue" that anybody can
hear The school had a radio station at one tune,
and tho rddlo station was an important voice in
the college, But that voice slowly began to inch.-

Yet every oncc in n whilc somebody decides
to try revivmg that voice, This happens when-
cvci- people got urcd of the area’s commeiciol

event which is moi-c effectively rcporlcd by radio
