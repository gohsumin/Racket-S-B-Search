DuPont Researcher Explains Advances
In Synlhelics lo Grinnell Chemists

ucts made possible by the new
liber technology,

The chemists laced a problem
when they discovered that a fiber
which was beautifully constructed
from I chemical point would not
take a dye, Mordants were devel-
oped which were responsive to
only certain types at dye: thus it
was possible by alternating dit-
Ierently mordanted Iibﬂs in the
weaving process. to put a white
iabric into a dye bath and pull
out a striped flag. This same pro
cess is used in making heather
sweaters.

As Hicks presented the ﬁeld, all
sorrs of people seem to beneﬁt
from the synthetic ﬁbers, Girls
wanting to preserve their houiiant
sweaters can step into their lycra~
spun turtlenecks. Astronauts. an
sons, and Buddhist nionks may
wish to consider the advantages
of DuPont's lireprool suits.

The next meeting of the chemi-
Cal society will be Tuesday. Nov.
23. at which time the students who
worked in Grinnell's labs this
summer will tell about their re-
search.
