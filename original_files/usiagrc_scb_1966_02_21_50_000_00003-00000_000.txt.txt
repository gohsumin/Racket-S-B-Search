Shender Throws

Support to Kent

As Convention Stands and Cheers

By ANN KIRSCHNER

"I lived with both of them this
Bummer and I know which man I
think can best lead student govern
Item.“

That was Steve Shender’s part—
ing shot to the SGA convention
Saturday. Shender was the candi-

"Le who was eliminated Irom the
running by the convention

Shender went into Saturday’s
convention with the support of

1ilh Hall, most of Main, half of
Dibble, and most of West, Shend-
er's own hall.

Gets Twenty-One Votes

Although the first ballot was jag,
Shender got 21 serious votes, nine
less than Wittgrat and six more

an Kent. The tension grew dur-
ing the secondvand last—ballot.
Half-way through the voting hall
after hall switched their v o t e s
from Shender to the other two
candidates Just after West Norris
swung its twelve Shender votes to
Kent, Jerry Goddard recognized

liender himself.

As he approached the lectern, the
convention rose to its feet and
gave him long, loud applause.

’ Shender spoke briefly, He said,
“At the beginning of the week I
didn’t believe anyone else could do
the job, but over the week i reale
ized that there is only one person
I want [0 see at the head of SGA
next year, and that is—Steve Kenti
I will give to him all my support
and I ask you to do the same”

Rims Underdog Campaign

“Most of Steve’s support was
outside the convention. We ran an
underdog campaign that reached
its peak Thursday night, but most
or the Bucks supporters switched
to Kent and Wittgraf, and that is
when we started to lose ground.
Steve would have had a much
greater chance in a popular pri-
mary" That was the opinion of
Steve Johnson, Shender’l carn-
psign manager.

Junior Ron Gatton gave the
nominating speech for Shender. He
asked “Will student government

continue to be Ineffective, insensi-
tive, and oligarchical, or will it
become a viable representation of
the concerns of the student body?”
He went on to say that Shender
would best fulfill the main pur-
poses oi an S.G.A. president: cre-
ating and sustaining active cone
com, and fostering good relations
with the administration,

otters Dynamism, Action

Gatton said that only when ser«
ious concern and popular support
are shown‘ do committees and
diplomacy take on meaning.
“Steve offers dynamism that pro-
mises action and accomplishment.
He will raise and clarify issues,
not bury them in a stiﬂing, bureau-
cratic structure."

argue, if Bucks and Shender had
both been in the running, both
would have come from convention,

There were several manuevers
during the convention that bear
noticing.

At one point, Steve Johnson, who
was the head oi the Dibble deler
gation and who also managed
Shender's campaign, reported that
his delegation was 9-1 for Shender.
A polling was demanded and it was
learned that the actual vote at the
Dibble delegation was five for
Wittgrai, two for Kent and two for
Shender (see page iour).

At another point, the West Nor-
ris delegation reported themselves
unanimously behind Shender, who

manded a poll and it was revealed
that one West delegate was tor

that during the West caucus all of

Alum Named as New Vice President;
Will Aid in College's Long-Range Plans

A 37 year old Grinnell graduate
has been named Vice President
for planning and development at
Grinnell. The announcement of
Russell w. Fridley's appointment
to that position was made this at-
ternoon by President Glenn Leg-
gett.

Fridley, who will join the Staff
May 1. will act as administrative
supervisor of public relations, de-
velopment and alumni departments.
In addition, he Will Work with
Leggett and Dean James H. Stauss
in long-range institutional plan-
ning, both physical and academic,

The position that Fridley will fill
is not the same one that Merritt
Ludwig now occupies. Ludwig, who
is a vice president, announced

January 14 that he was resigning
in order to take a job at the Uni-
versity of lowa. Fridley’s position
ls something of a combination of
Ludwig’s job and the job held by
John McFarland, a vice president,
who resigned last year. Ludwig
has acted as business manager of
the college, a duty that Fridley
will not handle. The position of
business manager of the college
and perhaps another position in
the development area are still open.

Fridley graduated from Grinnell
in 1950, has been associated with
the Minnesota Historical Society
tor the past 13 years, serving as
director or the society since 1955
Fridley is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, studied at Columbia Uni-

versity as a Lydia Roberts groom
ate fellow and received a Gi‘inneII
College Trustees Award for Merit
in 1957‘

“We are fortunate to obtain I
man 0! Mr. Fridley's exceptional
qualifications,” Leggett said, "A:
an alumnus, he has a thorough
knowledge of the aims and objec-
tives of the college. His adminis-
trative duties With the Minnesota
Historical Society complement his
educational background and qual-
ity him admirably ior his new
responsibilities at Grinnell."

Fridley, who is listed in “Who’l
Who in the Midwest" and “Who's
Who in Minnesota," to the author
of several books concerning Minna
sota.
