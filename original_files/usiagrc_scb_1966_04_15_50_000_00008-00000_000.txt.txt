a doubleheader played on the Grinnell ball yard last Saturday. The Pioneers split for the day,
winning the first one on the fourrhit. shutout pitching of Steve Tilly. I-0. and losing the night.
cap l9-3. Tilly was iust as tough with the shillelagh in his hand as he was with the pellet
and his soupbone. He found the converter two out of three times at bat and won his own
game in the third by singling in Jim Stuart who had walked and advanced to second and
third on an error and a passed ball. The Grinnellians suffered their first and only loss thus
far in the season in the second game to the Kohawlrs, last year's Southern Di-
vision champions. In the thick of this barrage right fielder Greg Dean collected three hits
in three trips including a triple. on Tuesday Coach Kowert's “group" traveled to lndianola
to take on the Simpson Redmen. After a little blood and pulp, Kowert's “hand" finished in
the winning beat for their third win of this young season. The team really found the con-
verter as Dean. Bob Seller, and Gary Wilson each pounded out two hits. Dean's output in-
cluded a bloody homerun (two Simpson players collided and were haspitalixedl and he was
also the winning pitcher. Captain John Shierholx was caught trying to lead off home plate
twice (stepped over plate while attempting to bunt] and ‘l’lle second time the urnp ex-
claimed. "You're out AGAIN!"
