Y Cabinet Strives for New Image:
Program to Stress World Issues.

By Cynthia Brust

"A new look and a great
year ahead” are the key words
or the Grinneli College YWCA
this year, according to the
Qabinet members. Many plans
have been made and'much of
the Y’s program is already
underway.

The IBM-’65 Cabinet hopes to
change the image of the Y, al-
jhough the organization and
basic purposes remain the
name. They hope to shake loose
the idea that the Y represents
nnly teas, white candlelight

inners and selling food in the
. uad on Monday nights. The
. WCA is actually a movement
hctively concerned and in-
I\iolved with current issues con—
fronting the world and, in parti-

ular, the women of the world.

uch aspects of the YWCA pro-

ram as work, education, sex
and moral education, the social
group, civil rights and the role
of the church in any or all of
these, will be taken up.

The basic structure of the

ampus Y will remain almost
ﬁle same as in the past. Margie

ayeda, vice - president and
rogram committee chairman,
as been directing all program

lanning activities. E v e n t s
pcheduled include a reception
{or the LeMoyne exchange stu-

 

dents, a senior forum, a series
of programs in summer jobs,
and information concerning op-
portunities in the national Y or-
ganization.

Dodi Holcher Will be in charge
of the social committee which
will not only involve social func-
tions but aso social action pro-
grams—civil rights, etc. Uncle
Sam’s Club, coordinated by
Judy Roberts and Jerri Lynn
Hart and sponsored by the Y,
will continue to send college
students from both campuses
to the club house to guide pro-
grams for the town children.

Darlene Keelier, head of the
worship committee, co-oper-
ates with the Board of Religion
in developing the campus wor-
ship program. This committee
is considered one of the most es-
sential for it will bring the Y
closest to realizing its stated
purpose: ‘. . . to realize a full
and Creative life through a
growing knowledge of God and
making‘ithis life possible for all
people,"

Nancy Fawcett, Sidelines
chairman, and treasurer Ginny
Harford will work together to
build up the financial status of
the Y. The Grinnell Y chapter
contributes to the support of
Ollie, a Finnish orphan, and
the Anatolia College in India,

 

Carrie Smiley will represent
the Y on the core committee
planning the WUS auction in
late October, an ail-campus
money-raising event.

Freshmen Commission, head-
ed by Sandy Hoth. will be
made up of selected freshmen.
All girls interested in mem-
bership should apply 2.0 Sandy.
The main purpose is to inform
the commission members, and
through them all freshmen. of
the nature and workings of the
Y on a local and national level.
Service projects include the
sale of Homecoming buttons,
and a. newsletter of Y informa»
tion. Jeanne Beck, chairman of
the Buddies Committee, has
been responsible for matching
each new woman student with
a Big Buddy. The Buddies Bar-
B»Q was the kick-off event of
the Buddies Program. This
committee was also responsible
for the candlelight dinner and
chapel service held on Wednes-
day evening,

Katy Compete and Nan Ru-
dolph will work with their com-
mittees on promoting the Y
program. Donna Dagenais, club
president is very hopeful about
this year’s “new"’ program:
“This year may make or break
the Y and We’re going to try
our hardest to make It!”

 

Mrs. Raviiis New Hosiess In Mears~
Finds GrinneII ‘InIeIIecIuaIIy Exciting'

By Ann Showalter

“When I told my friends in
Chicago I was coming to Grin-
neli, they all told me I would
like it here,” states Mrs. Mar-
jorie , Ravltts, Meal‘s‘s new
hostess. “So far this prediction
has been quite accurate.”

“The students have been so
helpful and friendly in answer-
ing my questions. I ask a lot
of questions; I want to know

[Where things are, how things

are done, what courses Hie stu-
dents are taking.”

She finds the students “alert
and inquiring,” the academic
program “intellectually excit«
ing."

She also had praise for the
student government operation.
"It looked rather complicated
on paper, but it is running very
smoothly In the hall.”

Saga Food Service is another
operation she considers out»
standing.

Mrs. Ravit‘ts has been con-
nected with the University of
Chicago for the past 14 years.
She went there first as a grad-
uate student working under the
Committee on Human Develop-
ment. which spans three grad-
uate study divisions directly
concerned with human life:
biology, sociology, and psychol-
Ogy.

 

She was a head resident in a
women’s dormitory at Chicago
for 11 years and served as As-
sistant Director of Student Ac-
tivities and Director of Housing
for Women at different times.

She thinks Grinnell probably
has the same kind of academic
pressures as Chicago, but feels
“a serenity and a solidity” In
the atmosphere here. She hopes
and intends to audit some
courses in the future.

Mrs. Ravitts conceives of
learning as a lifelong process.
“I learn so much from and
with the students, sometimes I
think of myself as a senior col-
league."

She believes learning is a con-
tinual striving towards wisdom.
and that wisdom includes “the
integration of emotional and in»
teliectuai responses.” She ex-
plained, “So often we know
intellectually that a thing is
right or true, but we have dif-
ficulty in accepting it emotion-
ally. We move toward this goal
of integration as we learn from
our own experiences and from
the ideas and experiences of
those who have lived in the
past.”

Mrs. June A. Main, 43 hostess
for East and West Norris for
the last four years, is now host-
ess in Main Hall.
