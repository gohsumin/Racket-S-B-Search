Monmouth Shuts out Pioneers, 21-0;
Lawrence Game Ends Season Saturday

By Steve Wells

Grinnell dropped its second
game in a row last Saturday
losing to conierence co-lender
Monmouth 21-0. Grinnell's des
tense played an excellent game,
holding the tough Monmouth
offense to 219 yards. The deiense
was particularly hard on Mon
month’s allrconference fullback
Charley Corie allowing him only
56 yards in 18 carries. The Pio-
neer offense did much better,
however, limiting the Scot’s do
tense to only 149 yards and one
one touchdown.

Grinnell seemed to be the
superior team in the first quarr
ter, not allowing Monmouth to
move the ball while driving in-
side the Scot’s twenty yard line
twice. Their first time with the
ball the Pioneers drove to the
Monmouth 11 before they were
stopped. Late in the quarter
Grinnell drove 40 yards to the
Monmouth 17 where Roy Lewis
was thrown for a 13-yard loss
on a field goal attempt. Mon»

- mouth took the ball on the 30
and drove 70 yards for a score
with the touchdown coming on
a 51 yard pass and an or) halts
time lead.

The Pioneer deleiise kept
Monmouth bottled the rest oi
the half while Grinnell’s of-
iense drove deep into the
Scots’ territory twice only to
be stopped by incomplete and
intercepted passes.

Near the end oi a scoreless
third quarter Bruce Rollins
dropped back to punt for Grin-
nell. He was smothered be
fore he could get the ball Off
and Monmouth took over on the
Grinnell 162 One play later the
Scots scored on a sweep around
left end.

With nine minutes left in the
game Grinnell drove from their
20 to the Monmouth 29 where a
halfback pass by Bill Dicks was
intercepted and returned 71
yards for Monmouth's linal
score.

Grinnell Went to the air in
a last effort to catch up, but
quarterback Johnson had two
more passes intercepted to halt
the drives.

The one came in the final secs
ends of the game after the Pior
neers had gained a ﬁrst and
goal on the Monmouth eight.

Soccer Club Knocks Knox, 4-1

By Steve Wells
in what was undoubtably its
best game this year, Grinnell
soccer club picked up its second
win or the season deieating
Knox 471. The entire team
played well in the Pioneers first
victory over Knox in at least
lour years.

Grinnell used a new iorma-
tion to give the team added
strength on defense. Shifting
Bruce Graham from a iorward
to a halfback, the Pioneers
were able to contain Knox on
defense while maintaining a
potent scoring punch.

Steve Korstad got Grinnell oil
to a quick lead, heading in a
goal in the opening minutes at
play. Both teams scored mid
way through the half with Gra—
ham moving up irom his half-
back spot to score lor the
Pioneers.

Ron Lord, helped uy Tom
Lincoln's assist, scored near the
end of the half to give Grinnell
a 371 halftime lead. Lincoln took
the goalie out of position by
taking a shot oil or Lord’s pass
while actually letting the ball
pass between his legs for the
score.

Steve Hirshon scored the
Pioneers' final goal late in the
Second half to givc Grinnell the
lit victory.

we did not score against Moro
mouth, and feel that we could
have it we had been able to
come up with a more effective
ground game to complement
our passing attack,” coach Bow-
ers said. “Naturally, i was dis-
appointed that we lost,” Bowers
stated.

“This was a game we really
wanted to win. i think we will
bounce back and give Lawrence

a good game," the coach said.
“The morale is good, we are in
the best physical shape of the
year, and a victory would give
us a 673 record that we would
all be very proud of.“

The Lawrence-Grinnell game
will wrap up the season for both
first division clubs.

Graceland 16-31,

Levy tended the nets ior Grin-

tributed heavily to the Pioneer
