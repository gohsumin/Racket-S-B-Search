Hello Freshmen - -

I After six days on the Grinnell campus you must
feel pretty welcome. Everything has been geared to
your wants and needs; group leaders, faculty members,
college officials and various upperclassmen have been

on hand to help you keep up with the fast pace of New
Student Day activities. In short, the service has been

.wonderful.

Our purpose here is not to add any more time-worn
phrases of welcome. You know you are. We don’t need
to extol the glories of Grinnell college; the catalogue
does that; neither do we need to elaborate on the exten—
sive talents and capacities of the in-coming studentse
your own records have already done that You know

what Grinnell can do FOR you and you’re ready for it,
But are you ready for what Grinnell can do TO you?

‘ In some ways Grinnell is like a giant “self service"

store — you walk around in the midst of extensive mer—
chandise and reach out and take according to your de-
sires, Things are attractive and they're at your disposal,
if you just take the time to reach out and grab,

But soon you start to take too much time, because
there’s so much you want. And you aren’t satisfied with
what you can profitably use and benefit from. You
must take more and more from the shelf, and as you
pile it around you, you become isolated from others
Walking around the same store. You don’t have time
for them because you have to keep reaching out for
more things on the shelves. And the more you pile
around you, the less you care what the others are doing
as long as they don't interfere with your visit to the
store.

This college is an institution; you and your fellows
are its community The shelves of the institution are
well stocked; and the members of its community are
serving themselves. In order for the institution to be
able to provide anything worthwhile from its shelves,
the community must henefitas a whole after each mem-
ber has done his part to equip himself adequately to
serve as part of that whole. But look at all the parts
which are working over~time to serve only themselves.
They will eventually break down from over—exertion
and all their grabbing will have gained them nothing,
And, by then, the shelves will be empty.

3) sophisticated entertain-
ment for self and friends.
‘ He then called for a "full
consciousness of commitments”
—among the student body to
provide the image that Grin-
nell is apparently lacking,

Students who had come to
hear positive statements on
what plans were made in social
reglulations on campus didn’t
receive definite answers, but
were neverthlass aware of an
administrative tone that called
for joint effort in the area of
rules and enforcement, as well
as an appeal for Increased acv
quiescence rather than need-
less conflict.

In an opening statement be-
fore the Dean’s address, Ken~
you A. Knopf, chairman of the
faculty, stated that Grinnell’s
goal for the year should be
“liberal learning” He spoke of
responsible behavior as a ne»
cessity for survival and pro—
grass of moiety and in refer»
ence to joint effort in pursuit
of the goal of liberal learning,
asked for a workable relation-
ship between separate groups.

The same tone appeared later
in the convocation when the
Dean spoke of me Grinnell
style of living in the realm
of liberal education. "There is
a need for the style of living to
be a strong, supporting, integral
part The reSldents in liberal
education are not full in the
culture of liberal education.
There is a mixture here:‘too
much is alien to liberal educa-
tion.”

Obviously referring to the
record of dispute between stu-
dents and administration over
the social living regulations,
Stnuss Stated that in matters of
conflict, there must be an
equilibrium of policies, “The
trustees don’t get everything
they want; the faculty doesn’t
get everything it Wants; the
administration doesn't get ev-
erything it wants. and the stu-
dents don’t get everything they
want," he continued.

ministrator [oi- the college, the
Dean said that college govern-
ment, the trustees. administra-
tion, and faculty should have
primacy, while the students
have influence. Conclusions, he
stated, would come out of this
lprocess of Self-restraint and
common sense.

Sensing probably dissatisfac-
Lion among student leaders and
members who are still looking
for some definite answers to
obvious conflicts, Dean Stauss
aslced his audience for belief
in the sincerity of purpose in
his statements. He showed ex-
press concern for the health of
the college community, stating
that any role in a young per
sons life for the period of four
years is a serious assignment.
He stressed that there is 3 del-
initc place for ,conservative
guidelines, and concluded:

policies he might take as 311- i

ience has great yalidity and
offers insight."

The convocation, a regular
feature of the New Student
Days program, featured an aca-
demic procession as well as
the addresses by Knopf and
Dean Stauss. The Grinnell Col.
lege Choir. under the direction
of Don Jones, made its first
formal appearance of the yea!
singing four selected Psalms.
Music was provided by Elbert
Smith, college organist. Do-
spite a heavy mist and consist-
ent rain, the Chapel was filled
for the occasion with many
students having to stand in the
back. It was the first official
appearance of Dean Stauss be-
fore the student body since the
resignation of former president
Howard R. Bowen July 1.

 

Next weekend leaders of stu~
dent government and faculty
and administration members
with positions which are in~
volved with student affairs
will gather at a camp near
Boone for the Student Leader-
ship Encampment.

These 40 students and 20
members of faculty and admin
istration will spend the weekend
trying to work out some of
their problems and to lay the
ground work for some of their
activities for the year. It IS
hoped that the weekend will be
profitable to all and that it will
save much time throughout the
year.

Though there will also be
some recreational activities and
free time, much of the week-
end will be devoted to discus-
sion group meetings. Each par-
ticipant has been assigned to a
discussion group in the area of
his activities and interests.
These groups will be chaired
