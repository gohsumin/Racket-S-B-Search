Frosh Cagers
Whip Knights

Although handicapped by a
lack of height and by spotty m-
bounding, Grinnell’s freshman
basketball team bounced back
in the second half last Satur-
day to hand the Wartburg Col-
lege fresh an 80774 defeat in
Darby Gym.

Throughout the first half the
junior Pioneers were held in
check by the taller Knight
squad. In the second half for-
ward Dick Lovell and center
Jim Rhodes sparked the Scar-
let eifort with their fine [‘87
bounding, While guard Elliott
Hibbs poured in most 01 his 28
points. The Pioneers took over
the lead for good with nine
minutes remaining and built up
a six point margin.

Coach Dick Young cited Lov-
ell’s rebounding and Hibbs' fine
over-all play as two reasons
for the good showing in the
second half. “During the first
half we tried some of the var-
sity plays but we weren’t too
successful so we settled down
in the second half to our basic
stuff and it payed eff," com-
mented Young. “1 think our
better conditioning also helped
us a lot. offhand I‘d say this
is fundamentally the best
freshman team we've had here
in several years."

The frosh played A tough
Central Contingent last night at
Pella. '
