LIBERATION NEWS
SERVICE

After midnight on July 14,
1967, l and my companions
were driving in my station Wa'
gnn, talking and listening to the
radio. As we reached the cor-
ner of South Orange Ave, which
was on our direct route home,
we were stopped by at least two
carloads of white-helmeted po-
lice with shotguns and several
detectives. They advanced on
our van; we thought that at
most they would check us out,
ask ibr identiﬁcations, etc,
then let us go.

We were told to come out of
the car. When i opened the
door and stepped down, one de-
tective, whom i recognized as
having once attended Harrig-
get High School while i was
there, reached up to me,
acreaming that "we were the
bastards" who had been shoot-
ing at them. “Yes," he said.
“a blue panel truck." (My
station wagon is an olive-green
camper bus.) I said that we
had not been shooting at any-
one. I told the officer that I
thought i remembered him
from high school — whereupon
he hit me in the face and threw
me up against the side of the
truck. (The others had also
been taken from the truck.)

The detective then began to
tab me as hard as he could
with his pistol in my stomach,
asking, “Where are the guns?"
I told him there were no guns.
Suddenly it seemed that five
or six of the officers surround-
ed me and began to beat me.
i was hit perhaps rive times
on top of my head by night-
sticks, and when I tell, some of
the officers Went about me-
thodically trying to break my
hands, elbows and shoulders.
One oiticer tried to kick me in
the groin — and there were
many punches thrown. As they
beat, they kept calling me,
"Animal,” and asking me,
“Where are the guns?” Inside
the wagon, the beating con-
tinued. They took us from the
wagon and as I was pushed
up the stairs at Police Head~
quarters, an officer called out,
"Wait a minute,” then punched
me in the pit of the stomach.

I fell to the ground clutching
my stomach.

Inside the station, Mr. Spfna
(the Police Director) was
standing behind the desk. I
asked him had he ordered me
beaten. He replied, “They got
you, didn't they?” — smiling.
An officer then grabbed me,
asked me to take off my belt.
He ran his hand in my pocket,
pulling out my wallet . . . later
I discovered that the officer
had taken about $65.00 and I
checkbook out of the wallet.

We were taken to City Hos
pital; i was dragged in and
handcuffed in a wheelchair.
The “doctors" put in eight or
nine Stitches. (At no time were
we allowed to make a phone
call. At no time were we read
our rights.)

We were then taken to police
headquarters on Franklin St.,
iingerpdnted and brought into
the courtroom and arraigned.
The prosecutor asked for $25.-
000 bail for me, which the judge
allowed. I was taken to Essex
County jail and put into solitary
confinement, where i remained
until I was released. (All mo-
tions for lowering the bail were
denied.)

disastrous, as any good show
sells out long in advance.

The NEC feels that the black
audience it does develop will be
an audience raised on quality
theatre. “They Won’t be getv
ting Broadway reruns, or Ne-
gro versions of “Hello, Dolly,"
a company spokesman said.
“They'll be a better group of
theater goers.” The NEC finds
predominantly black audiences
more responsive than predom-
inantly white audiences. They
find that black people come to
the theater with less precon-
cepticins than do white people,
and that their reactions are
"freer.”

The first play chosen by the
Negro Ensemble Company was
by a white man, Peter Weiss,
the German born, Swedish
author of “Marat/Sade.”

The group claims it has no
established policy towards the
type of play it plans to do. it
says ‘it is trying hard not to
start with a set political view
point.

urged all members of the Col<

to him their views on the mat-

College policy. in the interest
of consistency, we might do
well as we prepare to state
those views to Consider also the
case of the cigarette com-

Sir: The “new" 5&3 is great!
Nice to hear about something
besides the track meet and the
Lenox Quartet. The addition of
protessional cartoons, interna-
tional news and news from oth-
er colleges is going to give The
Paper a run for its money. Our
Congratulations! For God’s
sake don't print thisl

—Eleanor Cautley, ’11

Sir: i want to congratulate
you on the January 26 issue of
the 5&3. I am sure that we will
have strong editorial differ-
ences on occasion, but at least
during the coming semester the
son promises to add much to
campus life instead oi being a
bland reflection of it. Once
again, congratulations and good
luck.

Approval or Argument?
Sir: This semester’s Scarlet

'i'i-iE dIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

You will have noticed that Mr. Clark Clifford, our forthcoming
Secretary of Defense, has been coy on the question whether he in
a hawk or ii dove, disdaining, as he put it, “such ornithological
categories." But the wisemen in Washington tell us that he is Com
vinced of the tightness of the Vietnam war, and indeed it is on:
likely that President Johnson would have appointed to sit at hll
left hand someone who substantially disagreed with him on so im-
portant a question. It has even been whispered that Mr. Clifford
will pursue the objectives of victory in Vietnam more wholeheart-
edly than Mr. McNamara did, about whom the insider: tell of
great agonizing over the entire matter, an agonizing which can-
not compare with the agonizing of American soldiers as they hear
shells drop over them which were manufactured in the Soviet
Union and found their way to the war front because Mr. McNa-
mara — and Mr. Johnson -— agnnlze over world opinion.

But let us assume that the conduct of the Vietnam war will
proceed more or less at the pace or the last year or two, and hope
that the cumulative pressures on North Vietnam will begin to tell.
and that before long the military creaking and groaning will abate.
What then? What; will we see after it is over in Vietnam? A period

of peace in the Southeast Asian part of the world we are entitled to
expect.

But history teaches us the unlikelihood that there will be peacd
everywhere in the world. And all the less likely considering the
techniques of the modern revolutionists, who have learned to cause
so much disturbance with so few men.

The Sty-called wars of liberation are certain to prove to be lit.
military Model A Ford of the 20th Century — cheap, durable, and
ubiquitous. All It takes is a couple of thousand guerrillas. I pipe-
line to the soviet union, a local Che Guevara, and you are in
business. Inasmuch as the United States is primarily charged with
the responsibilities of counteraction, it is we who need to think be-
yond the Vietnam war and ask ourselves whether we are willing
again in pay so lilgh - price as we will have paid in Vietnam in
order to contain other national liberation fronts in other parts of
the world.

Mr. Clifford should turn his attention to the problem, and sure-
ly the place to start would be by announcing a future commitment
to the volunteer army. If you like, to the mercenary army. The
arguments in favor of it have been frequently rehearsed, as re-
cently as in 1964 by both the presidential candidates. As is so often
the case with election year promises, nothing has been done, noth-
ing in this case to phase out the draft. Perhaps the reason why is
the great manpower demands of the Vietnam war. But that is no
reason tor putting off a public discussion of the volunteer military,
and it is always appropriate to bigthink about strategic matters
upon taking the oath of niiice.

The conventional arguments are that, e) a professional force
renders professional services. As things now stand, an American
technician becomes highly qualified, highly useful. by let us say
June, and in September his tour of duty is over. b) The extra cost
or luring men into a professional military force is not likely to
exceed the great cost of continually training the millions of young
men whose services are used over so short a period. To which con-
venrional argument should he added, {1) the great commotion
caused by a draft, and the influence Of that commotion on the
formulation of an effective foreign policy backed up by a mobile
armed iorce. ii the United States is going to help out next year in
Brazil, the year after in the Sudan, and the year after that in Ni-
geria, surely we do nor want to replay the tensions of the existing
war? it is bad enough to contemplate another haltrcentury of ti-
nancing resistance to the Communists throughout the world, but it
is more than flesh and blood can bear to contemplate a Slyyear
old Dwight Macdonald relusing ills 25th consecutive invitation to
the White House.

The influence of American youth and their epigoni. ihe inlel~
ieciuais, the academicians, the opinion-makers, the noisemakers,
on foreign policy is considerable, and in some ways heallhy. Their
indisposition to go and fight in these grubby wars in grubby parts
of life \Vnrld is altogether understandable. But until we simply
give up on the rest of the world, we have got to help out. And the
way to do that is primarily by making arms available, and also
small, professional forces which will absorb the Shock until such
moment as the locals are trained to attend to their own defense.

Perhaps someone in Washington will be good enough to quel-
tion Mr. Clifford on the matter at his next press conference.
