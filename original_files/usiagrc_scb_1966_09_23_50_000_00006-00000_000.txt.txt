a committee be termed to pro
coed with a more complete
study, aimed at producing more
wide-ranging curriculum revi-
sions to be acted upon by the
fall of 1967.

Knopf's report suggested a
number of ideas for change in
particular areas of the curricu.
lum. Knopf said the curriculum
should be designed to make the
most of "the combination of
small size and focus on general
pducation” which contrast the
liberal arts college to larger
universities. General education.
according to Knopf, should “em-

phasize the individual under-
standing himself, the world he
lives in, and the change that
will occur in himself and his
world.”

Knopf does not believe that
Grinnell is now making the most
of its position as a liberal arts
college “We should look t0
strengthening general education
in the sense of humans rele<
Vance in each of our individual
courses, as well as general edu-
cation in the sense of breadth
of material that the typical stu-
dent confronts in his entire col-
lege program," Knopf said.

ent historical studies and hu<

The other required areas of

Viewed with an eye toward in-
suring breadth of coverage

Knopf suggested that we
might be getting to the point
“where foreign language can be
treated as we have treated
mathematics, that is with more
stringent admissions stand-
ards.”

“In science,” Knopf recom-
mended, “serious study should
be made of the possibility of a
one-year course for the non-
science major which would pro<
vide knowledge of much that
the layman should know about
science,”

All departments, Knopf urged.
should study their courses to
“determine if the development
of the discipline and the rele-
vance of the discipline are giv.
en sufficient attention."

To further insure breadth of
study, Knopf suggested that
“maximum as well as mini-
mum credits be established for
the departmental majorr“

He suggested a program of
major-related study in which
the student has a wide range of
choice of coursesY but for which
each student with his advisor
must provide a satisfactory ra-
tionale, This might lead to the
development of course group-
ings of four or ﬁve courses.
one of which would be a senior
seminar or independent study
course “designed. to take the
student into material related to
the major, but from at strong

out course groupings could
“provide a better general edu-
cation titan the random cafe-
teria selection of introductory
courses that often is chosen
now, and because some such
senior course as suggested
would help to strengthen the
senior year."

Knopf urged special attention
to the senior year in all areas
of Curriculum study “because it
is now the weakest for many
students."

Knopf concluded the report
with a recommendation that
curriculum 5 t u d y committee
should do something to curtail
“the treadmill of deadlines"
faced by many students due to
the emphasis on work done out
side of class. Knopf feels that
this “treadmill” prevents what
he calls a “certain kind of inde-
pendence" on the part of the
student.

The curriculum study group
which Knopf recommended is
now in the process of formation
it will form part of President
Glenn Leggett's program to de-
velop a comprehensive long-
range plan for the college.
