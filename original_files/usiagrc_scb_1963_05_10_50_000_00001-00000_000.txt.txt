'July 22, 1941

The “Gene” of the signature
is playwright Eugcnc O'Neill.
“This play of old sorrow" is
“‘Long Day's Journey into
lNight.” The drama is intensified
by its autobiographical nature,
which ensured O’Neill’s involve»
‘ment and extreme dedication to
his task. Thematically, the play
deals with the tragic lack at
understanding which divides
and isolates the members of a
ifamily from each other.

Long Day's Journey Into

Night will be presented today,
tomorrow, and Sunday at 7:00
p.m. in Roberts Theatre. The
play is an extremely long one,
and refreshments will be served
between the third and fourth
iacts.
