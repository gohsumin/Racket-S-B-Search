Encampment Scenes, Opinions

Two startling conclusions de-
veloped out of last weekend's
encampment, It was first noted
that the chairman of the board
of trustees is. or at least was,
a disciplinary problem. Shortly
thereafter, the discovery was
made that trampolines are not
an unmixed blessing.

But though these two con.
clusions are of overwhelming
import for most Grinnellians, it
15 best to dwell on more mun-
dane discoveries.

Encampment is tirst of all a
highly personal experience for
the students and faculty who

we

actually participate in it. In that
alone. it probably justifies the
$675 expense (after all, Godfrey
Cambridge cost $2,000).

The full glory of the northern
lowa weeds in their autumn
colors provides a backdrop for-
bidding to the narrow misunder-
standing which usually exists on
both sides of the faculty»student
fence. Somehow. there is an ele-
ment of true liberalization which
forces itself even on such as
the Dean of Men; he looked
really human standing at the
end of his bunk muttering dis-
paragingly “dormitory life. "

The stated purpose of this
year‘s encampment was to ex-
amine the aims and goals of
the Grinnell education. At the
opening session on Friday night,
Steve Kent, President or the
Student Government Associa-
tion stated these goals briefly:
“First to acquaint the student
with the world or knowledge,
Second to teach the student how
to approach this world. Third
a moral element. to help the
student develop within himself
a coherent conception oi the
world.”

Nebulus, yes, it \vas, but it
was a starting point and such
an undertaking seldom achieves
precision.

Mr, Steiner, English, asked
what advantage we as a liberal
arts school have over the lib-
eral arts college of a university.
ray Williams pointed to the en-
tire atmosphere or many uni-

gverslties "the antirintellectual.

anti - thinking. anti » anything"
tone so prevalent in the univer-
sity dormitory.

Perhaps, suggested Hank Bal-
ikov. it is because Gtinnell
"preserves the back-w- the-
womb family type atmosphere
of high school." But Jane Strake
countered. "i don’t know that

'anybody came here wanting to

be isolated from the rest of the
world” to which Mr. Knopf. eco-
nomics, was heard to shout
“Hear! Heart"

Reference was also made (0

called "that masterpiece of
propaganda." the catalog,

But as Shender suggested
later “I don’t think that this

business or being out in a com-
field" is all that crucial. More
important we have little free-
dam to follow our interests be-
cause there is “too much of a
course mentality: You don’t
have much time to develop
yourself outside your courses."
Shender suggested; "you don’t
want to pick up Balzac. i think
it's the course load not the iso<
lotion."

Bob Johnson carried the dis-
cussion a step further: “I’m
questioning Whether Grinnell is
freeing the student’s mind.”
And Dan Bucks questioned
whether the system allows the
student to develop the critical
attitude or does the student sim«
ply fail to take advantage of .

Perhaps, the next morning's
breakfast conversation was
more enlightening w the true
nature of the Grinnellian's (Ill-
emma:

A student: "i feel like i got
bombed last night, not had an
intellectual discussion."

Two taculty members: "l
wonder if my wife had the pres-
ence of mind to go out and res-
cue trom the treat those peppers
i worked so diligently growing."
To which it was replied "You're
pretty chipper, aren't you."

Two faculty members: “We’re
so far out. in the country why
do \ve need to retreat from it."

"i don't know, why couldn’t
we just go over to the Forum."

“1 otter the hypothesis that
it began when Christ went oil in
the wilderness for forty days."

And, perhaps, that last state-
ment is as accurate an apprais-
al of encampment as any other.
For encampment is not really
victory any more than was
Christ's confrontation with Sa-
tan. ‘l‘he ascension is yet to
come. Sadly, perhaps, so is the
crucifixion.
