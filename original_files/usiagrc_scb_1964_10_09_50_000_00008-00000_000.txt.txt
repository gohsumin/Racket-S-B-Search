McMillan Explains Aims. Deiails
0i Arts and Crafts Workshops

By Nancy Gromko

To provide students with the
opportunity to work creatively
while developing the manual
skills traditionally associated
with arts and crafts is the aim
of the alt workshops.” states
Robert McMillan, chairman of
the program.

The program, in its fourth
year offers two hour weekly
workshops in ceramics, metal-
ry, drawing, watercolor painta
ing and printmaking. Enroll-
ment is limited to ten in each
class.

“An unfortunate division is
sometimes made between the
arts and crafts," McMillan
states. “Through participation
in the workshops one recog-
miles that working with utilitar—
ian crafts snems from the same
artistic inclination as the more
aspiring products of the fine
arts.”

in ceramics, the students
Work with basic clay bodies
and glaze. “By making simple
pots one learns the nature of
clay and how to work within
the limits of its strength and
stability."

Pencils, crayon, and charcoal
are among a great variety of
instruments employed in draw-
ing workshops. Compositions
are based on various visual re
sponses to one’s surroundings.

Using sterling silver and
ebony, teak or rosewood, stu-
dents in metalry workshops

_ may fashion pins or pendants
based on free-form designs.
"The first problem” states
Louis Zirkle, instructor “is to
get a workable design on pa
per. Then comes the problem of
craftsmanship."

Mono-prints, linoleum prints
and wood-cuts will be the pro-
?ducts of activity in the graphics
workshop. In the watercolor
group a casein medium will be
employed,

Tara Hookham art major at-
tributes her interest in the
(traits to previous participation
in the metalry and ceramics
workshops “You become a pen
fectionistl You can' just slap
something together."

"Working with metal and

ceramics satisfies two different
urges,“ Miss Hookham states.
“Metal is a resistant medium
and requires a great deal of
precision. The clay bends to
your will."
‘ She encourages participation
in the workshops. “Anyone can
make something. It‘s justa
matter of patience and precis-
ion.”

Chemistry major Mary Sue
Wilson finds the workshops a
pleasant diversion from study-‘
ing. “You can do something enl
joyable without having artistic,
talent.” l

Contrasting the difference ini
media, she explains, “in met-
