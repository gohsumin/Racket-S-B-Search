Rally Call for Student Power

"Every student on this cam-
pus needs at determining role
in making college decisions,"
student senator Bill Thomas
told some 200 students at a
rally In front of the Forum last
Friday (Octr 3).

"Committees w i t h student
representatives don’t deal with
the basic, central decisions
that affect the college, but with
the smaller petty things,"
Thomas asserted. “Students
have to get together, with the
goal of more student decision-
making power.

“Nothing is going to be done
it the majority of students al-
low only the activists and radi-
£215 to take action,” he con-
tinued, “The need for unity is
paramount."

The rally was originally cali<
ed to discuss Dean Alice Low’s
re-definition oi the resident ad—
viser role in the college drug
olicy. However, because Dean

ow rescinded the policy sev-
eral hours before the rally,
speakers shiited the focus of
their remarks to the matter of
the students’ role in college do-
clsion-malring.

“Grinnell students are sati5<
tied, orderly, docile, happy,
and conventional," Instructor
Alan G. Nasser (Philosophy)
told the crowd.

“There is a myth on the East
Coast that Grinnell College is
full of students who are social-
ly aware and politically con-
scious," Nasser said, “but this
place isn’t anything lilre its
reputation tor being alive and
Vital.

“It is possible for students

to be aware of their powerless-
ness, but you people are not
aware." N a s s e r continued.
“Students here seem to acqui-
esce in the tact that they have
no power to participate in the
decisions that affect them.”
Nasser also said that tradi—
tlonaily the faculty has wielded
the greatest power at Grinnell.
“It's my perception that they
set policy,” he commented.
“You should get together and
make a formal decision as to
whether or not you want to par-
ticipate in the power structure
here,” Nasser told the students.

"I would hope that a Con»
sciotts group would emerge
from the student body and
start talking, conferring, and
acting on the basis at reflection
on matters such as these,"
Nasser Concluded.

Senior Tom Thomas told the
crowd that students are pres-
ently involved in “a tokenistic
system of decision-making.” He
urged students to organize and
exert pressure on faculty and
administration for equal stu-
dent representation in decision-
making.

“You must let them know
that you don’t recognize the
present decision-making proc—
ess as valid," he said.

Junior student senator Bill
stranger told those at the
rally that "Grinnell College in-
stitutionalizes adolescence.”

“when we come to Grinneil
we have a new set of parents

Faculty Supports
Moratorium, Will

confronted the faculty at a
meeting late Thursday after-
noon, and was met by a mod-
erate declaration of support.
“The college supports it," said
Prof. John Worley (Phil.), sec-
retary oi the taculty, atter the
meeting, “but will not impose
It on the college community.”
The Moratorium motion, which
was approved by the fac-
ulty “overwhelmingly,” guaran
tees that no penalties will be
imposed on protessors for not
teaching classes, or on stu-
dents for not attending them
on Oct. 15. The support or the
Moratorium did not include a
comprehensive policy statement
by the faculty, however, and
such a policy statement did not
come up for general debate.

“This is a declaration of both
support and freedom,” Worley
added. “There is an option tor
the student and the professor
to take part in anything or his
own choice.”

Jltoélmatc ﬂoat

By Henry Schetf

Now that my weekly report
from the student senate is a
column, the editor informs me
that I may editorialize occa-
sionally if i deem it appropri<
ate to do so. However, I do
feel that I owe the readers 01'
this paper a factual report of
what the senate is doing. I will
try to keep the distinction be-
tween fact and opinion as clear
as possibler

The most interesting occur-
rence at Tuesday's meeting
was a move by Grinneli Wom-
en’s Lib ion to eliminate
the institution of the Homecom-
Ing Queen. Sally l-lamann told
the Senate that the idea behind
the Homecoming Queen is in-
suiting and degrading to wom<
en. She pointed out that the
queen is judged by how she
looks, not what kind of woman
she is. The woman is viewed
as an object rather than as a
person. Furthermore, nomina-
tions are made only by males,
and the queen usually ends up
n Caucasian because of our
culture's artificial standard of
what. is beautiiul.

She pointed out that the land-
slide victory of Dick "The
Kid" Meliman for Homecoming
Queen last year is an indica-
tion that the students do not
want a Homecoming Queen.
However, there was some feel-
Ing expressed by some students
at the meeting that The Kid
was elected as a jag end that
a majority or students might
want a Homecoming Queen.
After 45 minutes of debate and
discussion, the Senate officially
recommended to the Student
Affairs Committee and Presi-
dent Leggett sbolishment or the
institution of Ho rn e c om in g
Queen at Grinneli College. A
reterendum on this question
Will be held later this semester.

The Senate approved student
representatives on the Library

and Admissions committees,
and also approved sophomore
Jon Stein as the new Social
Coordinator, to fill the vacancy
created by senior Lee Sham-
berg's resignation.

Senator Bill Thomas asked
the senate to approve a mo-
tion calling for telephone votes
to approve remaining commit-
tee positions as fast as pos-
sible. This motion passed, the
senate realizing that these
committees should have been
ﬁlled sooner.

Student coordinator Frank
Thomas brought to the Senate
a proposal by Dean Connie
Kimbro dealing with “the park-
ing ploblem” on campus. It
called for the registration ot
all cars with the Deans, who
would issue parking stickers to
authorized students, according
to the motor vehicle rules
stated in the Student Handbook.
illegal parking would be the
able, with the Physical Plant
issuing tines unless the senate
wanted to take over this func<
tion and appoint student en-
forcers. A number of senators
questioned the need for this
whole procedure, and wanted
to talk to Kimbo about whether
the “problem” was severe
enough to merit the rather
strict measure.

The student Coordinator’s of-
fice has received numerous
complaints about line cutting at
the dining halls. Line cutters
are subject to $1 tines as they
were in the past, with house
presidents and senators enforc-
ing the rule and collecting the
tines. which go to SGA.

Finally, I have been asked
to inform the student body that
next week’s Senate Meeting,
Tuesday, Oct. 14, will be held
at 9:30 in Roberts Theater.
I urge all students to attend
[his meeting. The meeting will
question the role of the student
at the college.
