Ballinger sees Africa borro wmg,

modifying Western democracy

by Paul Courtright
“When we talk about democ—
racy for the newly emergent nae
tious of Africa, we must ask,
what do we mean‘ by democ-
racy?" pointed out .Dr, Ronald
Balingei- in an interview. ‘

This semester, Bollingcr, visit—
ing prolessor from the Univer-
s‘ y of the Witwatersrand, South
Africa. has been teaching the
course, ”1an duction to the
Study of Afr a," and giving a
series oi lectures on Afi‘icall
problems.

on the question oi the prospect
for democracy in modern Arri~
ca. he had this to. sa We
must remember that democracy
is thc product of essentially
Western 'Etll‘opean historical de-
velopment. Alricans are not un-
conscious of this and are not
unconscious of its advantages.”

lit pointing out the problems
in the new African state and
tire role or democracy in solv-
ing these problems, ’Balllnger
commented, “The question ' is
whether or not commencement
of rapid modernization will ren-
der them impatient of the checks
and difficulties which stem lrom
the basis of tribal societies. a
problem or whether the aspira—
tions of a coastal elite 01‘ a
privileged tribe more exposed
to modern Western technology-
aud education can be reconciled
with the slower moving tradi—
tional pattern of the older so-
ciety. There is also the question
cl how tar the traditional stronge
holds really represent not mere-
1y a threat to material advance
but to the structure or the state
as well"

Democracy in Africa will car‘-
iamly take a dilrei-ent lorm of
development than in Western
Europe and the United States,i
Ballingel- said. "Democracy must
be related not only to the West.
ern Colonial tradition but to
the deep Atrican political hc-
itage within its traditional struc-
tul‘esiAmei‘lCanS or Europeans
must constantly keep this cons
sideralion before them," he urg—i
ed, "if they are to make any;

ical development along its ease

In comparison with VVESfern

“In both the Uuitcd States and

the tears at the South African

“The present gov rnineut posi-

Visil' +0 play

nex’r Friday, Saiurclay, Sunday

by Ray Obstlcld

Fl'iedr' h Ducrreninatt's play
“The Visit” will be presented in
Robert's theater on May 12, 13
and it at 3-30 pm. Duerrcnmatt
is a succcsstul Swiss author who
has several other plays to his
credit, though “The Visit" is the
best known of his works.

The play won the
Critics’ Circle Award

Drama
in 1959,

g" had this to say about m .The story of a cold and calcu-

African situatio “Historically
we can see that in Western
societies, the building or the
state and the struggle ior p0-
liticai liberties have grown
side by side: T is only means
that the po ically conscious
Airicaris not in the govern—
ment will have to struggle ior
those liberties at the some
time in some kind oi opposi-
tion group, which has been
the case in many Airican .
states mid still is."

Ballinger conﬁned his belief
in the future or the basic demu—
cratic framework tor Atrican na—
tions, “At the some time, it is
at least likely that the leaders'
of the new states are conscious
of this problem and will wish
to preserve Western political
traditions and institutions ”

The University or Witwaterssl
rand, near Johannesburg in thel,
heart of South Africa’s indus-
trial‘ complex, is the home of Di:
Ballinger and his family, Hel
holds the post ol senior lecturer-l
in history. ' ‘

 

lated revenge for a crime al—
most torgottcn, “The visit” is
a gripping drama which holds
the audience in a vice ot iron.

The parts ot Anton Schill and
Claire Zachanassian will heplay—
ed by Al Stanley and Nancy

,Game, Max will be portrayed by

Phil Powell, while Eon Green-
spou and Dave Palmer will give
their renditions of the charac—
ters Mike and Bobby, rcspcc-
tively.

Kobby and may are Ken

Schill and Sam Schumau. The
part of the Burgomcister will
he played by Peter Cohon. Trau
Schill and Frau Burgomeister
will be portrayed by Gail Zivih
and Carol Shaver. Schill's chih
dren will be played
Phelps and Nick Murray. Mike
Burr and John Williams will
take the parts oi teacher and
pastor.

The play is a study both in
the character of individuals in
crisis and oi a mass of people
when contronted by a strong
temptation. A strange play in
many ways, “The Visit” should
prove both enjoyable and pro.
vocative. The play is directed
by Ned Donahoe (drama) and
the technical direction and sets
are by Richard Meyer (drama).

Tickets lor the production may
he obtained upon presentation
ol an activity ticket in the Uh-
ion Monday, Tuesday and Wed
nesday.
