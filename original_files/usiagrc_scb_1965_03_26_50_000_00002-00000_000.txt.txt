All Issues Important

To the Editor:

I was somewhat dismayed by
the letter in last week’s 5&3 in
which live Grinnellians advocated
that the issue concerning civil

rights in this country was not as
pressing as the United States’ po-
lition in South Viet Nam.

I would like to point out to these
five (unless i misunderstood the
tenor of their letter) that both me
civil rights movement in this
country and the situation in South
Viet Nam should be given equal
attention and not he pitted against
each other in order to determine
which has precedence over the
other. Both issues are vital in their
respective concerns, and hence we
at Grinnell should refrain from
overemphasizing one issue at the
expense of neglecting the other.

does not advocate immediate with
drawal.

Betts questioned one point, say-
ing that the implications of the
situation make this more than a
“local war.” He viewed the US.
failure as resulting from incon—
sistent foreign policy and said that
this policy may prove instrument-
al in forcing the U.S. to extricate
itself from the confusion of the
situation.

Jones termed President John-
son’s bombing raids “understand-
able” despite realistic evaluations
of American success. “Everybody
realizes we will have to get out.
Nobody in Washington believes we

‘ can make South Viet Nam demo-
cratic,” he said. Because of the
political and prestige defeat which
would follow withdrawal, Jones
said he hopes the us. can nego:
tiate a withdrawal under terms
such that Viet Nam would remain
neutral, if only temporarily,

Views of these four panelists
were reflected by Voertman, who
agreed that the Us. is at war
with the Civilians and that our
foreign policy is at fault.

 

Viei Nam Headline
Angers Committee

To the Editorr

Jeremy Wilson’s letter is based
on a misunderstanding created by
the erroneous headline placed
over our letter of last week. A
close reading of our letter will re-
veal that we applaud President
Johnson’s action in Ala ama and
see expanding possib ties for
progress. We hardly advocate
“forgetting civil rights” or even
subordinating that struggle to the
task of making public our criti-
cism of present Viet Nam policy.
It goes without saying that the
struggle is not over; in fact, it has
hardly begun,

Rather, we stated that "there is
another issue present today that
looms over the domestic ﬁght for
civil rights and social equality and
threatens to hinder its progress."
This point was brought up at
Monday‘s faculty-student coffee
hour on Viet Nam. Let me spell
out three dangers that today’s
wrungrheaded pulley poses to prog-
ress at home,

First is the possibility of escala-
tion into thermonuclear war. Then
there is the disastrous effect of a
limited general war in Southeast
Asia. Civil rights are forgotten
during war emergencies. Remem-
ber World War ll?

Finally. if destructive bombing,
gas, and whatever the Joint Chiefs
of Staff have left in their arsenal
don‘t somehow get us to the bar-
gaining table with what is left of
North Viet Nam, then we may
have to pull out — because we will
be forced out. Such a fiasco —- to-
ward which we seem to be headed
— would render great damage to
the President's support at home
and his chances for two terms in
office during which to continue the
drive toward a Great Society.

We hope that all these dangers
will be kept in mind by students
as they also consider the civil
rights struggle. International poli-

tics does have a strong impact on'

domestic policy.

School for Young Apes

(Continued from last week)

For a time things became peaceful again and
faculty and students returned to more mundane af-
fairs such as classes. informal games, and so on.
The underlying tension created by the conflict, how-
ever, did not disappear.

The matter came to a head two weeks later,
during mating season. During this time, according
to tradition, the female apes were locked in their
compound earlier than usual at night, and a heavy
faculty guard stood watch in the surrounding jungle.
(These precautions were not taken to keep the
male apes out so much as they were taken to
keep the females in for everyone knows that dur-
ing this time, no female ape can he held responsible
for her Virtue.) However, one intrepid coed suc-
ceeded in scaling the compound wall and success
fully evaded three faculty members. Stealthily, she
made her way to the male compound, where she
attacked the first ape to come along, dragging
him into the bushes and having her way with him
in spite of his shrill Cries.

Within the week she was brought before the tri-
burial, fined twenty conch shells, and sentenced to
not less than three weeks of social approbation
However, the FTS was again unsatisfied. The coed
was not responsible for her actions, they said, and
they expelled the male ape. This blew the lid off the
kettle, so to speak, and the more militant members
of the student body, who had been crying for DEFIN-
ITlVE ACTION. began to make their influence felt.
Under extreme pressure, the AST Tribal Committee
issued a directive calling for unified student censure
of the faculty, including a boycott of all classes.
The FTS, speaking for the entire faculty, retaliated
by cancelling all classes.‘

After this. blows and counterblows came with

terrifying swlltness. A student demonstration pro-
testing the faculty's refusal to Conduct classes was
broken up by the Goon Squad, a subcommittee of
the FTS. A subsequent faculty demonstration, pro<
testing against students who wanted to come or
classes, was dispersed by the SPG (Student Peace
Group). The tribal chief, still convinced of the POW-
ER 0F REASON. submitted a bitter protest to both
sides against interference with the right of lawful
assembly. The FTS and see countered by selling
him to the Bronx zoo.

The last voice of reason in the student body
having been carted away. screaming in a cage, the
militants took complete control of the AST. Thalr
first move was to seize all of the slingshots and
polished coconut husks which belonged to the ballis—
tical sciences department.

Thus armed, they marched en masse in the di-
rection of the faculty compound, some five hundred
yards northwest of the campus. The Truth Squad,
however, was not caught napping. Arming the facul-
ty wid1 clubs and rocks, they began a flanking move-
ment, hoping to catch the students by surprise be-
fore they reached the compound. An advanced guard
of the AST discovered this move, and the students
spread out in order to counter it. Their strategy hav-
ing failed, the faculty resolved to face the students
ape to ape. As the two dark lines of grim-aced
primates approached each other, lit only by a few
torches, one young ape jumped forward from the
student lines and cried to both sides, “Waitl What
are we doing? This is an enlightened academic
community, not the junglel Aren't we forgetting its

» real purpose?”

“YES I” screamed both sides,

Commencement exercises were indefinitely post-
poned that year.
