Berry Enioins

.To the editor:

The statement In paragraph
ﬁve of the letter from Wolf, Ad-
kinson, Jacobson and Steven-
son was not well thought out.
If the journalistic integrity of
.Wolf et al has been criticized,
they can only confirm the
criticism by finking out on edi-
tor Denzler. If they feel that
“the editor makes the paper,”
they are only admitting how
insignificant their work is —
which is not true. I feel their

Stuff to Stay

work has been good, and that
such good work is not really
related to who the particular
editor is They, and not an inn
experienced editor, will consti-
tute the drop in the level of
58:3 journalism if they bail out.
Anobher pointi John Wolf.
who was a candidate for edi-
tor, has no business pointing
out the possible shortcomings
of Denzler.
Have pity on this girl, groupl

Letter Provokes Reply from Clymer

To the editon

As an interested observer
connected in a minor way with
the SSzB. ! find myself some-

what dismayed at the ramer
irresponsible and childish et—
titude of the editor and certain
members of his staff in regard
to the editor-elect. I get the
impression that Jim Herzog is
behaving like a spoiled child
who has just had his favorite
toy taken away.

I was interested to note that
the new editor will be permit-
ted to publish issues No. 13 and
No 15 at the discretion of
Herzog, Issue No. 13 will ap-
pear the first week after va-
cationi Not only will this be a
short week for the newspaper
staff (they cannot begin work
before Monday), but the job
of getting out the paper will be
even more difficult due to final
examinations the following
week Issue No. 15 will appear
during the interim period, a
time singularly devoid of news.
By selecting these two difficult
issues for Lynn Denzler, Herr
zog demonstrates his lack of
maturity

Why was Merrit Ludwig’s
personal memo to the editor
published? It was obviously not
intended for publication but ap-
peared to be simply a personal
request for information on
some important questions i
believe the editor has every
right to editorialize on any
topic from the situation in
Lower Slobbovia, to a liberal-
ization of the car rule, to the
change in editorship of the
S&B..I do object however. to
editorials in the form of news
stories. memos not intended
for publication, etc.
