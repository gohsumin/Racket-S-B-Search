President Glenn H. Leggett ap-
peared on the iront page or a
recent issue or “The Carletoni-
In," Carieton's student news-
paper, The headline, "Grinnell's
President An Outspoken Man"
referred to remarks made by
Leggatt in a speech beiors Grin-
neii parean and alumni in
which he said, “The desire of
students to manage their own
society is quite proper."

In an interview with n "Cal'-
Ietunlan” staii writer, Leggett
commented on the need for I
change in women‘s hours, self-
govemment in the residence
halls, the need to reexamine
the system oi majors, and the
duty or the president to secure
the best possible faculty. The
article mentioned that Presi-
dent Leggett regularly meets
intonnally with student lead-
ers and deans, and that he
values student opinion, as
shown in the formation at the
credit~tail system and the in-
terim session. The article
concluded by saying that the
president’s enthusiasm and at-
mosphere of involvement on
campus make his approval or
“the solid talk or students
about how they should live"
seem real.
