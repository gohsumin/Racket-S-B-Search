Can Poem Be Serious And light?
Kuntz Calls For Readers Verdict

To the Editor:

The poet E. L. Mayo of Drake
University spoke in the Fine Arts
Series on November 5 Among the
questions that bothered students.
one was put to him at lunch: “All
your‘ poems are very serious. Do
you ever write light versez” He
answered “no," and now I'm
puzzled by “The Mole," which ap-
pears in The Diver, published by
the yniversity of Minnesota press,
and copyrighted in 1947:

“The Mole”

When the mole goes digging
He never meets a soul;
The stars are inattentive
To the motions of the mole.

Peace Corps Exam
Offered in Burling

A Peace Corps placement ex«
amination. which is the first Step
toward possible Peace Corps as-
signments, will be given next Sat<
urday, Nov. 21, at 8:30 am. in
Buriing Library.

Persons interested in taking the
exam must first contact Dale B.
Terry, college registrar, or Le-
torne Sequeira, director 01 place-
ment and student aid.

 

He digs his frantic tunnel

Through chalk and clay and
slime

i-iis never-ending tunnel

A mouthful at a time.

Alone; no planet bothers
To tell him where to dig.
For males are very little
And worlds are very big.

And when his tunnel ceases
The little mole lies stark.
And at his back Is dimness,
And at his head, the dark.

So to the mole all honor

And the labors of the mole,

With doubtfulness for tunnel

And ignorance for goal.

My puzzle is this; first I thought
it very amusing. But now my col-
leagues say it's a serious poem,
about philosophers, or about phil-
osophers of certain kinds

Perhaps you readers can decide.
Can a poem be both serious and
light, amusing and very sad?
