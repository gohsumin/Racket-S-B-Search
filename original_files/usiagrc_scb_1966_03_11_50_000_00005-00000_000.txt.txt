of people satisfactorily. its mem»
bers must be able to feel a part
of the hall and be themselves; but
tit the same time, the hall must
meet certain requirements for pri-
vacy and isolation. She believes
that group activities should not be
stifled because of interest in
maintaining a chance for privacy,
and that this would be the job
of the house council Ultimately,
there should be an equal balance
between privacy and participation.

Paula Stephan-Loose

“It is the house president’s re-
sponsibiiity to ascertain people‘s
interests and encourage or re-
spect them. it is important to ap-
peal to those who want to particia
pate, While respecting the privacy
of others." Miss Stephan sees no
conflict of interest here, and that
with a good house Council there
will be no real problem.

She would encourage improved
communication with the Senate,
and more student-faculty inter-
changes within the hall.

Miss Stephan views the board
as serving in a creative capacity,
not just as an executive body. She
favors increased communication
with and respect for the Dean of
Women and the rest oi the admin-
istration in working out problems
such as graduated hours and the
lack of privacy on campus.

Cris Swanson-Homes

“Each person is an individual,
but given this system or dormi-
tory liie, every girl has an obli-
gation to recognize the rights of
the people with whom she is liv-
ing.” Miss Swanson believes that
everyone has the right to he
“fired up” over activities, but she
would not force anyone to do so.

She would like to see a reor-
ganization oi the house council to
make ottices such as music chair-
man and social chairman more
useiuL On the campus level, she
would like the rule system to be
brought into greater Contact with
reality.

Jenn TePuanrnes

Miss TePaske believes that 11%
pie should be tolerant of and in-
terested in each other. "Enthusi-
asm should be generated so some
can participate, but each girl
should be able to do more or
iesl what she wants to in the hall.”
She thinks that there has been a
lack of communication among the

such as lM sports and house par-
ties. come out oi the hall. She
feel that it is of primary import-
ance to make information about
campus activities available either
informally or through the presi-
dent or the house council.

Miss Ward believes that the em-
phasis oi the hall should be on
the individual floors. “It is impos-
sible to get a large group together
to get things going, so such ar-
rangements should be made
through the Baiiieboard. The Bat-
ileboard can most easily get to

.know the people in the hall, es-

pecially freshmen.

She thinks that respect toward
every individual comes from the
attitude of the president and the
Baiileboard. “A hall guides itself
through the way people make
iriendships,” she said.

out all firsttlme violations of this
rule without lining the individual
involved. But Bob Geller of North
Younker gave the prevailing atti-
tudé of most presidents when he
said that the first violation would
be punished with a tine, the sec
and with action in primary court.
All presidents said that the Cof-
HP would definitely take some
step in liberalization of hall hours.

BM} Problem

B&G's excessive tines was ans
other area in which the hall pres-
idents hoped the CotHP would
take some positive action. All said
that the three-member committee
to which appeals are made by stu-
dents should be abolished since it
is controlled by those who ﬁrst
fix the amount of tine. Many
would like to see in its place the
three North Campus resident ads
visors take over responsibility ol
ruling on appeals Concei‘nlngvex‘
cessivc fines. Chief complaints
about 3&6 policies were the 'min-
imum labor charge ct two dollars
an hour ior only five minutes work
and the liguring oi depreciation in

 

the lines which B&G will give to
students.

Car Rule

All presidents agreed that the car
rule should be given to juniors, but
Dick Faxon of Dibble thinks that
a junior car rule is not as neces»
sary as a college provision tor
more cars to be available to stun
dents {or use in trips to special
events and oil campus house par- :
ties ,

Since the number of seniors
owning cars is small in compari-
son to the size of the class, and
since there probably will not be
many more juniors with cars, he
thinks that more college cars is
the only answer it student trans—
portation is to he adequate.

six juniors and five sophomores
