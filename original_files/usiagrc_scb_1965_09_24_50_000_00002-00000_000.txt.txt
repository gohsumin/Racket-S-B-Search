Grinnell Women's Behavior on For
With Freeman's National Findings

By BOB HODIERNE

As a iooruote to last week's story on the sex survey on Grinuell
campus, the 5&8 offers the results of a nationwide survey mm the same
topic.

Marvin B. Freeman, assistant dealt of undergraduate education
and research associate at the Institute for the Study oi Human Prob-
lems at Stanford University, conducted a survey from which he COHv
cluded that sexual permissiveness has not swept the American college
campus.

Among his findings was the discovery that threertourths of unmar.

Tied College women are virgins. The survey taken on the Grinnelt cam-i

pus last spring, a survey which was part of a sociology independent
project, found that 77 per cent of thnnell women were virgins.
Another finding in Freeman's survey which comcided with the Grin<
nell survey was the fact that premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future husbands.
Freeman said, “It is probable that the incidence of non—virginity
unong college women has increased , . . little since the 1930‘s."

Freeman went on to say that it may be that American college stu-
dents have evolved patterns of sexual behavior that will remain stable
for some time to come. The behavior consists of petting, intercourse
among engaged Couples, and early marriage."

Freeman concluded that virginity, as an abstract value, has little
meaning to women students. Premarital intercourse is shunned by the
great majority for personal or interpersonal reasons, according to
Freeman.

The reasons that Freeman said the coeds listed for not engaging
in intercourse diiiered somewhat irom the reasons given by Grinnell
women.

Freeman said that fear oi pregnancy, feelings of guilt, emotional
upset or loss of self~respect, and ”lack of certainty about the perma-
nence of relationships" were the reasons given by most college women
for not engaging in sexual intercourse.

The Grinnell survey said that the reasons given by Grinnell women
for not.having sexual intercourse were tear of pregnancy, lack of op»
portunity, lack of an appropriate setting and uncertainty about attitudes.

 

Encampmen’r. Coniinued

Last weekend‘s encampment was designed to bring
selected students and faculty into contact on a non-aca-
demic level. In this respect, the encampment. was a big
success.

Each year, however, the planners of the encamp—
ment are faced with “bringing the spirit of Encamp-
ment back to Grinnell."

This year’s encampment committee, headed by
Karen Lauterbach, is planning to keep the encamp—
ment going on the Grinnell campus.

Coffeehours with discussion group participants
hopefully will be held throughout the semester.

Re~meetings of the original discussion groups may'

allow them to come up with workable ideas instead of
off-the-top-of»the-head suggestions.

The final reports of the five groups should provide
a solid base for general discussion.

And it would seem that the non~encampers of the
Grinnell community would have some interest in seeing
that the $600 spent. to provide a pleasant atmosphere
for 60 persons for two days was well used.

And Then The Letters Came...

Eldridge . . .

To the Editor:

“Sexual Behavior of American
College Women," published in the
Merrillel’almer Quarterly, January
1965 by M. B. Freeman concludes
that there has been little shift in
the sexual behavior oi college ii
men in the past so years: “the pi
portion of non-virgins among Cole
lege females has remained relative
ly constant . . , College women
change tho‘ attitudes towards
sexuality during the college years
generally in a more liberal direc-
tion. The code of behavior they
end with, however, is a relatively
conservative one tor themselves.
but a tolerant one for others.”
Thus a real researcher shows that
Gael Greene (Sex and the College
Girl) doals more in impressionism
than fact. He also provides us
with some perspective on our
own “23 per Cent.”

Not all promiscuous people incur
subsequent traumas. but i great
majority do, less because they feel
that they have violated a moral
rule than because they realize that
their promiscuity was an indica-
tion or an egocentric condition of
character. The bipolar egocentrici-
ty of two people is no less debili»
tating than that of one; mutuality
of consent is not a saving gracel
But ersons with a spotless past
who arshly judge and disdain the
23 per cent display their own varie-
ty of egocentricity, which is one
reason why l think more tolerance
in this area is a good thing. We
need to remember the “throwing
the first stone" parable, An egocen
trio condition of Character seems
to me to be the basic problem and
it may or may not correlate with
sex practices. This is why a lot of
the discussion of Grinnell’s 23 per
cent which I have heard the last
few days seems superficial.

To the Editor:
1 have heard the sentiment ex
pressed in the last few days on
north campus that the publication
of the “Grinnell Kinseyrlike sur-
\‘ey” was unfortunate. It is feared
that Grinnell women will be a.
fraid of any sort of social inter»
course, because they do not want
to become members of a minority

group.

'SDS-Type Program' Leader
Interprets Group's Purpose

To the Editor:
As one of the lustigators of last
Wednesday's socalled SDS meet
ing, i would like to amend the
view presented in the pages of this
newspaper. First and foremost. the
meeting was not an SDS meeting;
it was rather the second meeting of
an unaffiliated group interested in
civil rights and SDSrtype programs,
several of whose members have
worked for SDS. The purpose of
this meeting was neither to or-
ganize an SDS chapter nor to make
any kind of policy statement, but
rather to talk to Billy King, a visit.
ing SDS worker, and to throw a»
round some ideas about possible
projects. We were neither ex ect-
ing nor prepared to say anyt iu
delinite to the large number 0
students (much less the press) who
suddenly appeared. All this is not
to say that we are not most happy
to have attracted the interest of a
large number of students. or that

we are not most happy to have
been given trout page coverage in
the 5&3, but rather to reassure
those who might have been disap-
pointed by Ihe meetings lock of
organization and program. Natur-
ally we hope that increasing hum.
bets of students (and faculty) will
sllow an interest in the type ol
concern and commitment which
originally brought our group to-
gether, and, indeed, the arousing
of such interest is one of the goals
of the group. Perhaps if such meet»
ings and issues as these continue
to make the front page of the sail:
soniethiii can be done to raise the
level of iscussion on this campus
from the amazing low point of re-
cent years. Certainly any article on
SDS, however misconstrued, is bet-
ter than the insipid and asilline
drivel of last year's “sad fresh»
man” and “youthful upperclass-

Gilmour, Iowa Anti-Poverty Director,
Cites Conservative Appeal of Program

The director of the Iowa “War
on Poverty” has described that
program as “tailormade tor the
Conservatives of Iowa."

Dr. C. Edwin Gilmour (political
science), who has mken a year's
leave of absence to become “Di-
rector of the Otﬁce of Economic
Opportunity" in Des Moines. re
turned to Grinnell last Friday to
speak before a meeting of the
League of Woman Voters.

Gllmolll‘ said that the new anti—
poverty program was made [or
conservatives “politically because
it is decentralized and ecomlnica -
ly because it insists on iull Value
lor every dollar sperm"

l-le blamed the communications
media for creating the misunder»
standing that the program was
“just another Federal program
with hordes of employees and
ridden with politics." The Des
Molnes Register in particular was
guilty at "soclally irresponsible
reporting and lack of perspective"
in its coverage of the program in
lowa, Gilmour added.

He then reviewed the need for
the program nationally and the
progress already made in Powe-
sheik county. Gilmour sulnmarizs
ed the “War on Poverty” as “the
most promising smial prsgram of
our lifetime."

To the Editor:

Though rm hardly in the habit
of writing letters to friends. n-ln
tives, or editors, I did feel i should
express lny views on the “Kins

The article, 1 felt, was unnecessary
and demeaning to the college and
its students, although I do not
imagine it crime as any great. sur.
prise to them. However, i am most
concerned with the effect it must
have had on the parents who sub»
scribe to the paper. Surely it uas
not. necessary to alarm and tits-
tress them by publishing this mili-
er worthless survey. To prove my
point, I enclose a letter I receivf‘d
from an aunt. after she read the
article. is any notoriety gained by
the article worth this poor lady‘s
distress?
