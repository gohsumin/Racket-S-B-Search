Special Supplement

In the longest issue of the
paper in over four years, the
Sud; staff has prepared an
eightspage supplement in which
we focus on the slum conditions
of three Cities — Chicago, Des
Moines, and Grinnell. The sup-
plement comprises pages 5
through 12 of this week’s 5&3.
Two teams of photographers
and reporters spent the mid-
semester break in researching
the stories for the supplement.

Special thanks go to Sue Tay-
lor and Krys Neiiman for as-
sisting in gathering information
in Chicago. Thanks also go to
our printers, who were kind
enough not to yell at us.

proach to the issues from varying
frames of reference might lead
to greater understanding of the
problem, as well as raise the tenor
of political commentary to a new
level of responsibilityK legitimacy
and vane.”

up into three smaller study
groups, called international Sys
tems, Social Change and Econom-
ic Development, and Revolution»
ary Warfare. Faculty members

tems study group are: Charles
