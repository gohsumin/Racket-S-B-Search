equally of Asia and the Middle
East, that the democratic pro-
cedures known in Northwestern
Europe offer no substitute for
‘strong government’ during
the transitional period after in—
dependence.

“But even if one understands
why single-party rule is inevit-
able under present circum-
stances, that is not reason for
believing that democracy has
no future in Africa. There was
a time when democracy had no
place in Europe. Democracy,
where it exists has only
emerged out of prolonged strug-
gles for power,

My readers may recall that
the United States had only one
party for the first eight years
after her Independence. Even
as late as 1820 James Monroe
was elected President without
any opposition. The absence of
opposition is not unusual in
young countries. Ghana is not
the first one-party state in Af-
rica and I am sure, it will not
be the last, since unity is ab-
solutely necessary at the early
stages of our national life.

Post, Janaury 26, 1964).

Six Mefusequoius
Thrive on Campus

Six Metasequoia trees, dis-
tant relatives of the California
sequoias, have survived their
first winter on the Grinnell
campus, Ben Graham (biol.)
has announced.

The Metasequoia,‘aiso known
as dawn redwood, was known
only from fossil remains until
1941 when living specimens
were discovered in China dur-
ing explorations for natural me
I o u r a a s in underdeveloped
areas during the Japanese in-
vasion of the mainland.

Since 1948 the tree has spread
to many other parts of the
world. Graham believes that
the several specimens in the
Grinnell area represent the
only outdoor planting of Met-
asequoia in Iowa.

The trees were planted last
spring. There are three west
of the swimming pool and three
south of the fine arts center.

Graham explained that while
the tree is a conifer, it is also
deciduous, losing its leaves in
the winter. Graham noted that
the Grinnell specimens have
begun putting out new needles
this spring,

The Metasequoia is related to
the cyprus of southeastern Unit-
ed States and'less closely re-
lated to the California red-
wood. Metasequoia originated
in the late Cretaceous, more
than 60 million years ago.

Grinnell has other examples
of “living fossils” in male and
female ginkgo trees near the
fine arts center. Believed to
have been extinct, the ginkgo
was also discovered in China.

Dean of the College, he had
been informed that the number
of faculty members teaching
next semester would be ap-
proximately the same as the
number of professors employed
by the college during previous
semesters.

Phil Johnson reported that ”a
number of faculty members are
responsive to a course evalua-
tion system.” Johnson also
noted that there would be a
student march on Washington
on June ninth. The organizers
of this march expect 10,000
