'I’m impressed with the call-
her of the student body as a
whole and the variety of things
oiiered to Students at Grinnell,"
wmments Christie O’Luughlin,
resident advisor [or Medrs and
ltlain halls.

Miss O'Loughlin comes from
Boston, attended Smith as an
undergraduate, and received
her master’s degree in mod-
em Chinese history from the
Mniversity oi Washington in
teattle.

She learned about the posit-
lion open at Grinnell from Dean
’Alice Low’s daughter, a student
at the university

Considering studying tor it
Boctorate in guidance and coun-
Ieling in colleges, Christie want-
ed a job living with students.
She previously worked as a res-
ident advisor at the University
pt Washington.

in addition to her duties as
jovisor and counselor, Christie
is Working in the admission'
oitice. She feels her primary
duty is to represent the admin<
lstration in the residence hall
and serve as an intermediary
between administration and stu-
dents.

 

JAGK MILLER

Jack Miller, newly arrived ad-
visor to Clark and the Norrises,
is also a member or the depart-
ment of education. He Will teach
a course next semester; this se-
mester he is an observer of stu-
dents who are practice - teach-
ing in the Grinnell p u b l i c
schools.

Miller hails from Kansas City,
received his BA. from the Uni-
versity of Missouri (spent his
junior year at the University oi
Vienna) and an M.A. from Hans
vardr

Asked about his reaction to
Grinnell. Miller said that it ll
pretty much what he expected.
“1 had few preconceived no-
tions. although i did expect it to
be rather conservative" He
noted that the other advisors ho
had talked to seemed to have
expected Grinnell to be in tho
toreiront of Midwestern liberal-
ism—something akin to Antioch.

He 16615 that the atmosphere
he has encountered here is some-
thing ot a cross between that of
a state university and the ivy
League. The days he has met
are quite similar in interests to
those he knew as an undergradu-
ate at Missouri,

Miller sees his rule as an ad-

visor, not as a policeman. He
disagrees with those advisers
who feel that simply because
rules have been made, they
should be enforced. Rather, stu-
dents need to arrange their own
lives so that they do not bother
others. No other restrictions are
necessary. If he made any pre-
tense ni entorcing rules. Miller
suggests. he would lose the conii<
dencs of students and he un<
able to advise them.

ZELTE GRAWFORIJ

“As a resident adviser i see
my role as still nebulous. This
is what makes the job flexible
and attentive. Structure would
restrict freedom and stifle com.
munication.”

Zeito Crawiord, resident ad-
visor [or South, North, and
Smith halls. sees this as an im-

rtant aspect of his counsel-
ng work.

Zelte gained experience in
counseling before his position
here working in a mental hos-
pital and for the Job Corps. He
also has a varied background
in the liberal arts. with con-
centrations in philosophy. so-
uiaiogy, psychology, English and
Il‘t.

Working within the context ct
ﬂexibility, Zelte hopes to es-
tablish a rapport with the stu-
dents so that he can communi-
cate with the people that need
help.

“These persons should be able
to bring in problems openly
and honestly because I'm not
going to be a rule enforcer.
The students must assume re‘
sponsibility tor their own ac-
tions.”

While having been here only
a short time, Mr. Crawford
closed with a comment on the
campus living conditions.
“North Campus is less hypo<
critical than South Campus be- ‘
cause North Campus seems
more concerned with making
ideas and actions synonymous."
