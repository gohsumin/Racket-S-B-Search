Two Year Cui-
ls Considered
For AFROTC

The Air Force has proposed
the idea of telescoping the has
ditional four year AFROTC
course into a two year program.
This program would be called

the Air Force Officer Education.

program.

A two year
ship” of about $1,le per school
year for each selected candidate
for commission is; part or the
Air Force proposal. This money
would be paid to the individual
at the beginning of each school
year.

The new program has been ap-
proved by the air start and is
now awaiting review by the
Department of Defense for leg.
islation. It would eliminate the
two year basic course which Air
Force officials regard as a bar-
rier to attracting needed cata—
gories of college students.

Under the proposed plan,

college students would enter
AFROTC training in their jun-
ior year. Subjects now taught

in the basic course would be
taken in two summer camps.

The first camp would come
between the sophomore and
junior years, the second, he'-
tween the junior and senior
years. Participants would be
lpaid for their time in camp.

Two reasons for dropping the
basic course requirements are
the high cost of producing a
ROTC graduate and the increas—
ed study load heaped on science

and engineering students. A two.

year program would enable

transfer and junior college stue‘

> dents to participate in ROTC.

According to Capt. Morris C.
Brunton (air science), the r .
quire'ments for participation in
the proposed program would be
similar to those for “the
Force academyiphysicai a n (1
mental tests, results of college
Iboard examinations and career
intentions.
