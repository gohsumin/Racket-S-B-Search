SCARLET AND BLACK

 

THE GARRISON CAMPUS

By PHIL SEMAS
Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON — American Students have long been second
only to American Negroes as an oppressed class in this country.
Many writers have recently iocused on that oppression—Nat lien-
toii with “Youth: the Oppressed Majority" bt Playboy and the Loo
Angeles Free Press with its widely quoted “Students are Niggers"
article.

For years students were denied basic rights available to most
other citizens, as were Negroes. Lately, colleges have been grant-
ing students more or their rights, such as authority over rules oi
conduct and sometimes even a voice in making educational policies
— just as a rapid succession oi civil rights laws have given Ne-
groes many paper rights.

But Negroes have always been faced wilh a diiiei'ent kind of
oppression: police with cattle prods, tear gas, dogs, and guns.
American students have seldom had to face that — until this year.
Now, at the same time as US. cities are arming to maintain “law
and order" this summer, many campuses are moving closer to
becoming armed garrisuns.

understandably, black students tare the greatest danger, since
they are simultaneously members oi two oppressed groups. Thus
we have several hundred police attacking the campus oI Texas
Southern University. And we have police shooting down unarmed
students at South Carolina State in Orangeburg.

Many black leaders have said that such violence will he con-
fined to black schools, that black students will continue to he shot
down but white students won’tt They may be right. But there are
some dangerous signs on white campuses; they have already seen
police violence and they could see some killing.

Last fall, in the face at dozens of disruptive dellionstrntiorls
against campus recruiting by the military and Dow Chemical
Company, administrations at the University or Wisconsin, Brook-
lyn College, and several other colleges called in outside police to
“deal" with the demonstrators. Students were teargassed, beaten,
and bullied.

Now more campuses are arming. Campus police at the Uni-
versity of Utah and Colorado State are now armed with Chemical
mace. It has actually been used on students at Colorado Stale. At
some schools the campus police now carry guns.

some administrations. oi course, don‘t want their campuses
turned into armed camps. But they otten ilnd the garrison philos-
ophy being imposed irom the outside.

Thus, San Francisco State College President John Summer-
skill was attacked by Governor Ronald Reagan, legislators and
college trustees ior not calling in the police during a disruptive
campus demonstration. ,

And California is now considering creation of n state-wide cam-
pus police, under the command or Governor Reagan, not campus
administrators.

And there is LBJ’s GIBaL Drug War. Supposedly part ot a new
effort against “crime,” his proposed legislation is aimed not at
organized underworld drug protiteers but at the people who use
drugs, mainly students. Under the new law a student who loans a
pep pill to a triend during finals is a tederal criminal. The new
legislation would make pot busts like the mass police raid at Stony
Brook, NY. an almost common occurrence. And it will also prob-
ably mean even more campus iniiltration by narcotics agean.

Just as many blacks have called Johnson‘s “crime message”
this year’s civil rights hill, so might students call it this year’s
education message

The causes of this situation should be obvious. Students have
turned to disruptive protests because they are ted up with their
schools’ complicity with what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex. That complex promulgates war and
killing ior proilt and students rightly argue that universities ought
to have nothing to do with it. Instead at providing the complex
with services such as research and a place to recruit manpower,
universities ought to be fighting it, students have argued.

But not many university administrations _ and certainly not
the military-industrial complex itself — can afford that kind of
dissent. At tirst they answered with empty words about ireedom,
the ireadom that the military-industrial complex is destroying in
America and around the world. Now they are beginning to answer
with iorce just as they have answered the Negro’s demand tor
more than paper rights with force.

Oppression of students is not yet at severe as that attire

American Negro. Not yet.

Because many students had

THE RIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

1 note with sorrow that Mr: Howard K. Smith has qult tho
column-willing business because oi his general disgust with com
temporary toul'nulism. Particularly, he cites the buildup that
has been given to Stokely Carmichael, insisting that by giving
lnm such attention as we have, we are all oi us Frankensteius,
busily creating our own little monsters.

Now Mr. Smith himscli has been given to a strange produc-
tion or two, as when he invited Alger Htss ot all people to join a
television panel to discuss the tall oi Richard Nixon after his
detect in 1962. Mr. Hlss is about as qualitied to discuss the short-
comings oi lvir. Nixon as Mr. Oswald would have been to discuss
those at Mr, kennedy.

Still, he has a point worth contemplating. He gave another
example, namely the notorious photograph oi a month ago de~
picling the police Clitel's execution oi a Vet Cong. “Not even a
perinnctory acknowledgment was made at the tact that such
executtons. en masse, are the Vet Cong \Vay ot war.”

He quoted his own sun in Vietnam, leit for dead by the Com-
munists, who witnessed the execution by the enemy oi a dozen
U.S. soldiers in unilorm. Note that the Viet Cong was nut in
nnitorm, and hence was subject to execution. To be sure, aiter a
trial.

The interesting question is, how do you hold trials in a city
that is burning up with insurgency? The answer is that, as a
matter at fact, you don't usually have trials in such circumstances.
Thai. is one ot the reasons why wars are so hateiul.

It is interesting that the critics of the Vietnam war tend to
criticize it because war is dreadful, but [hell they tend to criticize
that which goes to make war dreadlul. it it were possible to wage
wars without killing people, or destroyingeiarms, houses, water-
works, and schools, then wai‘ wouldn't be dreadful. is it loo much
to ask that they at least accept the ontological structure of war,
and then criticize it?

l do not know whether, at the time Mr. Smith resigned, ho
had seen the NbC telecast, on the war, whose transcript 1 now
have, with master ot ceremonies Edwin Newman, and expert
guests. 1 should think it would have accelerated his decision.
(Professor Seymour Mclman weighed in with his criticism or
the alorementioned execution.)

The most striking aspect of it was the brief historical rum
down by Mr. Newman which went, so help me,

“National elections to reunlly Vietnam were to be held in
1955. Agreements were not signed by South Vietnam or the United
States, which (ltd not want to approve a settlement that legiti-
mized Communist rule in another country, or even half a country.
The United States did promise uni. m use iorce to overturn the
Geneva Agreement. After the division of Vietnam, Bat) Dal was
soon nudged aside by the man who was to dominate South Viet-
11am for almost a decade, Ngo Dinli Diem."

“Willi American sponsorship, advice, and economic help, he
consolidated his power around his family and his Catholic co.
religlomsts, many oi them irom the North. There seems little
doubt that Ho Chi Minh would have won the nationwide election!
scheduled for l95li, but Diem refused to hold the election. The
United States supported hurt and said the elecitons could not
possibly have been tan- in the North. Diem also continued to
crush all opposition.”

It is easier to rebuild Hue than that travesty.

No mention oi the grisly purges conducted by no that caused
a million North Vietnamese to flee south; no mention that Ho's
popularity in 1954 was like Castro's on New Year's Day 1959.
Both were popular, None, ninety clays aiter achieving power,
would have risked a tl‘uly free election. No mention that Diem
conducted two elections and won both oi them.

None that his government requested U.S. aid. No mention
that South Vlelnilm had been set up as n separate state in 1946,
and that the majority oi the United Nations were disposed to grant
it membership in 1952 and again in 1957 and would have except
for a Soviet veto.

To observe that Diem “crushed” the opposirion without men.
tioning that the North took care at its opposition by killing them,
or chasing them south; is — well, akin to staring at the picture
of the viet Cong in Saigon and cluckrcltlcklng about the cruelitlea
oi the South Vietnamese.

Mr. Smith is on to something. We seem to Want. to believe
that we are very evil people, supporttng other people who are
very evrl. some people get a kick out oi that, excluding. ! am
glad to note, Mr. Howard K, Smith.
