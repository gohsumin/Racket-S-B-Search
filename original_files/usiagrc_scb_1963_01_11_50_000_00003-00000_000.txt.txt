lone stand against the opinion.
DOUGLAS FEELS that this
type oi laws is “plainly an aid
to all organized religions, bring-
ing to heel anyone who violates:
the religious scruples of the ma-l
joi-ity by seeking ,his salvation

Douglas's deep belief in per- ,
sonal freedum has led to many
contmvelsial statcments an

creep into our way of lite.
Douglas asks, ”Eut.what pur—
pose is leit in this soft, easy life

like all other men?”

A TRAVELER and conserva—
tionist. Douglas has written
many books and articles about
his journeys.

He states in his “Russian
Journey" that he was anxious to
his part. In his most recent see what socialism under a to.
booklet, “Freedom oi the ,‘talitarian regime had done to
Mind," he tells oi his opposi- iRussia and the impact of a po—
tion to banning a book because lice state on the individual. He

He states. “Sex cannot be sur—
pressed in life. Should it be at.
tempted in literature?"

Douglas, in the same publica.
tion, contends that the Fifth
Amendment was intended "to.
make the government produce

Union in his lecture, “Russiai
Today,” 1
Douglas is a critic of Ameri—
ca’s loreign policy. He presents,
his views on this subject in “De
tmocracy’s Manifesto." In the in ,
troduction he states:
“WE HAVE BEEN on the de

In this book he goes on toi
criticize our government, Cspeol
ialally the Central lntelligencel
iAgency, for supporting icudal
governments in underdeveloped
countries. “I have never visited
ta village in Asia where America,
‘was revered as a symbol of free-

a man or a women on the rack
and squeezing out of him or her
the stuff to convict them,"

He also declared that news
papers are somewhat to blame
for the decline in personal free—
dom because they do not “ex-
ploit" their guaranteed freedom
but instead are out to make
money.

IN ANOTHER book, “Americal
Challenged,” Douglas discusses
several more of his beliefs.

Dissent is one right he baolrs
heavily in this hook. “it is es-
sential to the operation of a
free press. The aliairs of gov» l
ernmeut could not be conduct-
ed without it . , . It is the
right to dissent, not the right I
