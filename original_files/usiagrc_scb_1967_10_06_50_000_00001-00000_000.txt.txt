M. P. IAGKSON
0N MID EAST

By GERALD SWANSON

“The world is constantly on
a precipice and the Middle
Eastern crisis could push it over
the edge."

The importance or this prob-
lem to the countries directly
involved and to the world sit-
uation in general were the to
cal points of Hon. Colin Jack-
son’s lecture Tuesday evening
in the south lounge.

The Hon. Mr. Jackson, a
Labour Representative in Brl-
taiii's House of Commons and
Chairman of the Fabian Soci-
Ity‘s International Bureau, used
not only his knowledge as a
specialist in foreign aiiairs but
also that. of a Irequent visitor
to the Middle East in his
analysis or the problem.

His suggested solution to the
problem is that the Arabs and
the Jews negotiate under U.N.
auspices, with a realistic ap<
praisal of what each side has
to gain or lose in continuing
conflict,

"These negotiations must lead
to a pact which guarantees
Israel access to the Suez Canal
and the Gulf of Aquaba, re-
turns conquered lands to the
Arabs, and places the Holy City
under U.N. control,"

Mr. Jackson's visit to Grin-
nell was sponsored by the In-
ternational Studies Program
and the Departments of Politia
cal Science and History.

HETTLINGEII ON

SEXUAL

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Does love make it right? Dr.
Richard F. Hettllnger, author
of Living with Sex: The Stuv
dent’s Dilemma, addressed him-
self to this question in an hour-
long lectlure which high-lighted
his visit to Grinnell last week-
end.

Hettlinger made some twelve
hours of appearances, including
an informal discussion at Ex
Loco Parentis Saturday night,
a sermon in Herrick Chapel
Sunday morning, a meeting
with student government oili-
cials and other interested stu-
dents that atternoon, and a dis-
cussion in the South Lounge fol-
lowing his talk In ARI-i Audi-
torium.

In his lecture, Hettlinger took
iihe position that love some-
times does make it right, and
offered some guidelines {or de-
termining when this is the case.

Sex is oiten engaged in for
purely selfish reasons by peo-
ple who are incapable of true
affection, Love, which forms a
more appropriate context for
sex, implies a recognition of
the other person involved as a
personality and not merely as
a “convenient physical body",

Concern for the other person
involved will lead us to com
slder some of the ramifications
of the sexual relationship, which
extend far beyond the physr
cal act.

With today's trend toward
postgraduate study, premari-
Ilal intercourse is sometimes the
only adequate expression of love

VALUES

between couples whose mar-
riage, for economic reasons,
must be delayed, In cases like
this, avoiding intercourse oc-
casionally causes the couple to
become preoccupied with each
other as objects of unsatisiled
physical desire; in this manner
sexual attraction can obscure
other aspects of the personal-
ities involved.

On the other hand, difficul-
ties ot various kinds can arise
tram premarital coitus.

LOW 0N OPENS

By Don nacxan

The issue in favor this year
seems to be open dorms, and
that is a situation that Alice
Low, Dean of Women, very
much regrets.

Her position, which she
makes very clear, is that open
dorms, as an issue, is only one
of the aspects of on-campus
“living and total social interac-
tion.H

Because of her belief that
open dorms is only part of the
total issue, Dean Low l5 reti-
cent about discussing only that
issue. Her personal stand -
which, as she points out, is the
official stand of the administra-
tion or Grinnell — Is against

SENATE

FIIGEITAUB RESIGNS
AS CoIHP PRESIDENT

RAWSON PROPOSAL PASSES

By BARRY ANCONA

Bill Fligeitaub resigned as
President of the Council of
House Presidents Wednesday.
In a speech to the Senate, Fligel-
taub cited “pressures for total
neglect of the . i . rules” on
north campus, and said that he
considered “an irritating rule a
poor excuse for shunning one's
duty to honesty and responsi-
bility."

(Tex't ot Fligeltaub's speech
Dn page 7)

The RaWsDn Hall Proposal
Ior open dorms and a human
values class passed in the Sen-
ate when Speaker Phil Barten-
thai broke the twentystwenty
deadlock.

Before debate was opened on
the Proposal, Bertenthal ex-
plained that the Senate could
take several courses: the bill
could be rejected entirely; it
could be passed as a resolu-
tion; it could be sent to the
AWS Board and C of HP to
initiate the chain or thirty day
consideration periods that lead
through the faculty and the
president to the tnlstees; it
could be sent to faculty com-
mittees. or course, it the pro-

posal were sent to faculty com-
mittees, it would be broken upil
opens going to the Student Life
committee and the course gm
ing to the Academic Life com-
mittee.

The proposal was debated tor
thirty minutes before the vote.
David Swee (West) called the
proposal “minute and lragmen-
ted” and said that opens war
“not a primary issue” at this
time. Roger Koenker (Smith)
said the proposal contained too
much, that the course should
be eliminated, and that ho
couldn’t see "forcing professor:
with distinguished academic
records" to teach it. Darcy
Kelly (Main) noted that “thl
Deans say we want Ireedom
without guidance." The course
is the guidance needed, and
she felt that we should “makQ
the poor professors demean
themselves by talking about peo-
ple instead oi historyi”

Ray Horn, author oi the pun
posal, answered questions and
debated the detractors oi the
bill. The most interesting ques-
tion came from Derrick TePaske
(East) who asked “Do you ex-
pect Leggett to pass this?"
Hom said no.
