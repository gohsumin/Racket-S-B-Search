[0119- Campus Shifts in Emphasis

from Herrick to Burling libr ry

By Susan Taylor

“I think the way in which the _ ..

college sees itself has changed,"
Dr. Winston L. King, Rand Pro«

fessur of Applied Christianity
and Roberts Honor Professor

for 1963-64, said when asked _

about the’changes he has ob-

served in Grinnell over his fif» ‘

teen-year teaching career here.
“There was a stronger tenden-
oy when 1 first came in 1949 to

think of Grinnell as a church~ ‘

related college,” he said.
"There was more of a religious
context.”

King, who will be leaving
Gl’lnnell to assume teaching
duties at Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, Tennessee, in the
fall, came to Grinnell in the
194950 school year to assume
the position of Dean of the
Chapelea position
held until this year when he was
relieved of his pastoral duties
to devote more time to teach»
ing and writing.

Explaining the combination
of the religious and the academ-
it; in the very nature of the po-
sitlon of Dean of the Chapel,
King commented that he was
intrigued by the mixing of these
two areas. As the position itself
has changed over the years,
with increasing emphasis on
the academic, King also has
noticed a similar change in the
nature of the college.

Grinnell has evolved from a
Christian Liberal Arts College
to a Liberal Arts College; he
said. "I really don’t know What
Grinnell thinks it is now."

King explained that the insti-
tutional expressions of religion
mean less to this student gen-
eration than to Grinnell stu-

Honored at Dinner

On May 13, the 255th Air
Force ROTC Cadet Squadron of
Grinnell held a Military Din-
Ing-ln at the Ronneburg Inn,
Amana Colonies. Guest speaker
for the event was Major Bob
Ray USAF (R). One purpose of
the dining-in was to present
yarious awards to the outstand<
ing cadets of the past year.

The Grinnell College Military
Medal was presented to Cadets
Nordahl L. Brue (Bronze med-
al), John J. Pojman (Silver).
and Lawrence R. Rinderknecht,
for being the most outstanding
cadets militarily in their re-
spective classes.

Cadets Richard S. Schoen-
Ieldt, Robert C. Mack, and
Stephen D. Rockwood received
the Bronze, Silver, and Gold
Reserve Officers' Association
Medal, respectively, while the
General Dynamics Air Force
ROTC Cadet Award went to
Cadet John E. Kelsey.

The Cadet Commander's
Commendation Ribbon was
awarded to Cadet Lawrence R.
Riliderknecht, and Cadet Jeri
M. Langham received the Ex-
emplary Perlorlllance Ribbon.
Cadet Arthur H. \Veyrauch was
presented his Category 1? Pl]-
ots' Wings as the only cadet
eligible for Pilot Training.

dents in '49-’50. Most students
do have nominal church connec-
tions, he said, but he noted a
“change in o’he religious cli-
mate from institutional to
something else.”

“Students today are much
more concerned about the areas
of social justice,” King said.
The early fifties were more
placid, ”I notice increasing
concern on the part of students
in the areas of politics, integra-
tion, and specific social con‘
cerns,” he commented. He saw
the student body as ”much
more alive now than it was
then” in these areas. “This so-
cial concern has become a mor-
al equivalent for religion," he
said.

King saw “not a true irrell-
giousity. but a shifting into oth<
er channels.” He said there is
a “good bit of unstructured,
non—institutionalized religious
interest and concern." Students
are facing basic questions such
as the meaning of life and mor-
als, and of what personal re-
lationships should be.

”This indicates a greater
moral sensitivity on the part of

students,” he said. Explaining,

that this sensitivity is “spot-
ty" in that students can become
very concerned about the
meaning of life and yet Still
steal $7,000 worth of library
books annually, King said this
indicated a ”strange unconcern
about other people." ‘
Other changes in the campus
noted by King included an in-
crease in‘ cultural programs.
This, he said, gives the reli-
gious programming more com-
petition, because it cannot as<
sume an open field. There has
also been a shift in the signifi-
cance and the status of the
Board of Religion, according to
Dr. King. “In the early years

 

that I was here, it had a great

deal of prestige, many went on
from the presidency of the
Board to the presidenCy of the
Student Council.“

King also noted a “more
highly professionalized attitude
on the part of the Grinnell Fac-
ulty" in the last fifteen years.
There has become an emphasis
on “proficiency in one's special-
ty,” he said. This leads to a
tension with the traditional Con-
cept of liberal arts education.

Grinnell, he said, has also be»
come somewhat less of an Iowa
college. There are more stu-
dents from the Eastern sea-
board communities. Also more
students from Grinnell are go-
ing on to graduate school.

Grinnell has always had a
great “esprit de corps" accord-
ing to Dr. King. However, he
commented that perhaps this
sense of community has not
been associated with the col-
lege, yet a significant amount
of it still remains, though faced

Recently the 5&3 quoted pro-
fessor Alan Jones as saying stu-
dents should spend more time
having fun and pay less atten-
tion to work. I would agree
wholeheartedly. One way pro-
fessor Jones could make sure
that students follow his sug»
gestion would be to convince
his colleagues on the faculty
that finals and comprehensives
and fun do not mix.

Everyone knows that many
American cities owe their
names to the Indians and other

' foreigners who lived in Ameri-

ca before the arrival of the
Americans. One such city is
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. This
city was named by an lndian at
the finish of an endurance
hike.

This Indian had traversed
over 200 miles when he stag-
gered into a clearing in the
forest. As he made his way
painfully through the clearing
and small village it was clear
to the townspeople that the lu-

They were right: the Indian
collapsed and died. The city
which grew around his grave
was named after his last words
which were: “Ah con no mo’e

Maybe the college could solve
the problem it apparently is
having in attracting and main-
taining the highest quality fac-
ulty members, which it so ob-
viously needs for its brilliant
student body, by diverting some
of the money spent for poorly
attended lectures. A college
can be only as good as its fac<
ulty. Top priority should be
given to the essentials rather
than the extras of education.

The repeated use of concrete
and. glass in each new building
constructed on campus is be-
coming monotonous. Besides
looking somewhat like fish-
bowls, these buildings raise an
unpleasant question: What if
the extensive use of glass is the
result of pressures from the
psychology department which
is carrying out some sort of
dastardly experiment on the
Grinnell student body?
