é MILLION PE CONTRACT AWARDED
WALLACE AD STIRS DEBATE

The Scarlet and Black this week was faced
with a major policy decision when The National
Educational Advertising Service sent an ad for
George Wallace’s presidential campaign. There was

considerable turmoil among the
editorial staff on whether to
print the ad or send it back

the advertisement by the cam-

us if it were to be published.

he no for Wallace was the
only political ad received by

a business manager's office.

he business staff of the paper
advocated its publication for fi<
llancial reasons and because it
bias the best policy to accept all
advertisements

The editorial staff argued
that the problem was not clean
out, that there were people on
campus who would be seriously
offended by the ad, and that
their sensitivities ought to be
respected. However, there were
Questions of the responsibility of
the newspaper to allow free-
dom of the press, and whether
the suppression oi the adver-
tisement might be a form of
political censorship.

The editor decided it would
be best to seek advice on the
issue. Mr. Prescott, the Ed-
visor to the paper, Mr. Bow-
man. the Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Publications, and the
Concerned Black Students
(CBS) were all consulted on
the possible repercussions and
advisability oi publishing the
Wallace ad,

CBS said that they would be
satisfied if ads for all the ma-
jor candidates would be puh<

Later, the police were checking
the ID'S of the Longhotn’s
younger clients. Recognizing
her, they deterred any action
until they could establish her
age. She was telephoned and
asked to come down to the sta-

technical because no warrant
was ever drawn up.

Lambie said that the book-
store is not a money-making
venture. It exists only as a
convenience to the students,

If the intent of the store is
not to make money, why then
are prices so high? Wassom
said that prices are set by the
publishers. The wholesale pnCB
is only 20% less than list. The
expenses for transportation and

Gilbert Inc. Gets Largest

Grinnell College has announced the awarding

of a $2,158,250 contract

for the construction of a

physical education complex. Gilbert Builders, Inc.

9 PROPOSALS

The Concerned Black Students
(CBS) met and elected its staff
on Sept. 12. Elected as Presi-
dent woa Emest T. Weston.
Chairman of its four committees
—Admisslon, Placement, Fi-
nance. and Public Relations—
were Debby Green, Merryll Pen-
son, Frank Thomas, and Greg-
ory Coggs, respectively. Mr.
Raymond Fl Bets will serve as
faculty advisor.

Only 4.6 per cent of the us.
College population is black, and
the black students of Grinnell,
estimated in number as approx~
imately 43. constitute no more
than 4.6 per cent of the Grinnell
College population. CBS offers
the iollowmg o proposals in
order to remedy this situation
at Grinnell:

The first of the nine points
is the extension of the LeMoyns
College Exchange Program
from one semester to a full
year. for both students and pro-
fessors. Weston feels that the
present one semester program
is “just tokenism," since this
does not give the student time
to adjust to Grinnel] socially or
academically. Since. by tradi-
tion, only four LeMoyne stu-
dents attend Grinncll. wllich has
the capacity for eight. cos sug-
gests that exchange programs
with other black colleges be
initiated.

Weston complains that black
prolessors from LeMoyne are
not encouraged to come to
Grinnell, and urges that Le-
Moyne professors and professors
from other black Colleges be

building which will house the
physical education facilities of
both men and women.

Construction of the complex
is scheduled to begin next
week. If the construction were
not to have started before 0cto<
her 23. the federal grant which
is providing a large part oi the
funds for the project would
have been withdrawn. The
building is scheduled to be
completed in June, 1970.

The PE Complex is being fl-
nanced by an $340,000 loan, a
$30,000 Higher Education Fa-
cilities Commission grant, and
a loan and grant of $380,000
which has been applied for. The
college will raise another
$14,000 on its own

The 2.1 million dollar build-
ing will be the most expensive
one ever constructed by the
college. It will contain a cruci-
iorrn swimming pool (50 meters
in one direction and so yards
in another), much more class:
room space than is provided in
Darby Gymnasium, and a large
Tartan-surlaced area for sports
like basketball, tennis, and
track.

The present physical educa-
tion facilities do not allow for
the teaching or more than one
sport at a time in the gym
during the winter months, and
this often causes conflicts in
scheduling as well as inade-
quate training for athletes in
spring sports.

The new PE Complex will
downgrade the present empha-
sis on team sports, which are
now highly ranked on account
of the difficulties of accommo-
dation in the limited space
available.

According to John Pfitsch
(Physical Education), the com-
plex “can accommodate an em
rollment of at least 2,000.” The
