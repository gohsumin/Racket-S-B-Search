that “everyone" follows. That®———

is, we miss it for a little while.

After a while the thought no-
casionally occurs that Thailand
will soon have to become a part
of the modern world and that
you really ought to prepare
them in some more basic way
than teaching English, but the
thought passes and is replaced
by a secret desire that some
of this peace and relaxation
could clog up the welloiled
wheels of civilization and that
you're out of the country betore
the terrible effects of Western
materialism hit the land of
“never mind."
