Senators Cohen and Ward

Speak on Campus Affairs

Following their recent election
to the Senate, Alan Cohen and
Johanna Ward were interviewed
by the 5&3 to determine why
they ran. what they thought of
the Senate, and where they
thought the Senate should be

. heading,

Alan Cohen: ”I originally ran
because I thought the Senate had
been handling only small ad-
ministrative matters. Students
would ask what the Senate has
done, and the answer would be
nothing, All they had done was
give out money and pass a few
resolutions.

“i want the Senate to address
itself to the things that are
bothering students, I believe that
students are worried about the
academic situation: require-
ments. the possibility oi optional
grades, relevance of courses, and
so on, Last week three new
Senate committees were formed
anti live more became Senate
committees. They cover such
areas as requirements, ireshman
year, and the dormitories. The
Senate must act on the recom-
mendations of these com-
mittees."

”Another problem is com~
munication between Senators
and halls, Each senator is
responsible to two or three halls.
but they rarely meet with these
halls, Senators should provide
leadership to mobilize student
support ior issues. They also
shouldsolicilStudentopinions."

”l uni-kin! nit the Student

Position Paper 7 I’m definitely
in favor of it,” Alan finished his
interview with a harsh blast at
the S&B's anti»Senate editorial
(See last Week’s “Letters to the
Editors" tor other Senate opinion
on the editorial).

Johanna Ward: “Before this
year i heard more about the
Senate than lknew about it, Last
year pcoplc didn‘t think it was
doing anything or could do
anything. Havtng sat in on the
Student Position Paper. I've
found out that the Senate is the
best place for student opinion to
be heard.”

“I’d like to see the Senate at-
tempt to activate the student
body and keep it informed — like
about the Senate Position Paper.
One of the biggest faults of the
Senate in die past is it lack of
communication with students. If
they don’t know what‘s going on.
they can’t be interested! ”

“I'd like to see the entire
student body 7 Senate, Council
of House Presidents, Association
of Women Students 7 work on
developing this fine report we’re
supposed to have with the
faculty.”

“1 support the Student Position
Paper. but there’s a lot oi iaculty
opposition to it. it's an idealistic
paper. To get what we want, we
have to spend a lot of time to
fill positions adequately.”

“I think the drug issue 7 the
school's policy on drugs 7 is one
of the most important issues on
tuil"i)\l$

College, for which he expressed
great aiiection, respect and
loyalty. He also expressed his
friendship with, and well wishes
and respect ior, the College
administration and all the
members oi his Department.
“Tile College has been good to
us. especially in the friendships
we have established. and we will
never target it or them." Mrs.
Dorothy Burma was iormerly
Chairman of the Women's
Physical Education Department.
Acting Dean of Women one year,
and several times Social
Chairman of the faculty College
Club,

Professor Burma has accepted
a position as Professor of

Panthers Speak

A birthday party ior Huey P.
Newton. the Black Panther
Party‘s jailed Minister of
Defense, was held Saturday
aiternoon, February 14, in the
South Lounge. Featured events
were a speech by E. c. Smith,
Deputy Minister oi information
[or the Des Moines branch of the
Black Panther Party, and a docu7
mentary film of Bobby Seale in
prison.

E. C. Smith discussed the his-
tory of the Black Panther Party,
its ten-point program, the repres-
sion oithe party by the Establish
merit, and other topics pertaining
to the black liberation struggle.

As enunciated by Smith, the
(1) com-
niunity control. (2) iull employ-
mcnt (3) an end to capitalism
and imperialism, (4) decent
housing, 15) true, relevant educa-
tion, (6) no military service for
black people, (7) an end to police-
brutality and murder of black
people, (St the release of all black
prisoners, (9) black juries for

black defendants, and (10) a UN-
supervised plcbescite among
blacks to determine their
national destiny,

Among E C Smith's points
were the following: “The Party
is not racist We're notjust going
to kill the white pigs, That‘s a
lie. We’re going to kill the black
ones too because they’re
making life miserable in the
community,"

“They are trying to either
minate the Panthers not because
they have guns 7 no, niggers
have had guns beiore — but
because they have politics, We’re
talking about people organizing
to overthrow the system. We’re
talking about revolution."

Mary Rehm addressed herself
both to the general struggle and
to the plight of Huey P. Newton.
“The three levels oi oppression
are the demagogic politician, the
avaricious businessman, and the
pig-cop on the street."
