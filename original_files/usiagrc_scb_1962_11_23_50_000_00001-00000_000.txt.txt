SGA President Boston presents
academic honor plan to senate

By Richard Ohlemeyer
S at B Staff Writer

This week the student senate
meeting consisted of two officers’
reports, Terry ParSSinen, speaker
of the senate, reported that men-
ey from the soda machines which
would ordinarily go into the spe—
cial income fund is being with~
held to pay for broken or unre-

turned soda bottles.

PARSSINEN requested that
students return bottles promptly
and avoid breaking them. Mon-
ey from the special income fund
pays part of the expenses of
Grinnell's ioreign students.

Al Boston, Student Govern-
ment Association president,
presented some ideas for later
consideration. Among these
was a suggestion that a col-
lege-wide academic honor sys-
tem be instituted.

Under the system, all persons

would take an oath to conduct
themselves honorably and prom.
ise not to indulge in any form
of cheating. in addition, persons
taking the oath would assume
the responsibility of seeing that
others do not cheat. Boston men-
tioned that he expected the part
about taking responsibility for
the honesty of others would
meet with more opposition than
the rest oi the system.

ANOTHER IDEA presented by
Boston was a proposal for an
independent symposium entitled
“The Democratic Process in a
Time of Crisis." Such a sympo-
sium could be made up of study
groups trom campus organizes
tions.

The third idea Boston spoke
on was the establishment of a
campus charity fund to contri -
ute to recognized charities which
we do not already contribute to
as a campus.
