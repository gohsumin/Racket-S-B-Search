BIG TEN INVESTIGATES
BONUS BABY SCANDAL

ANN ARBOR, Mich” Feb. 28
[(CPs) — Charges that Universi-
ty of Michigan athletes have
been given discounts, and even

gifts, by Ann Arbor business-
men are being investigated by
the Big Ten here.

John D. Dewey, assistant com<
missioner of the Big Ten, has
been questioning athletes,
coaches, and businessmen in-
volved to find out if Big Ten or
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation rules have been vio-
iated.

Dewey’s investigation began
after the Michigan Daily re-
ported in a copyrighted story
that Ann Arbor clothing stores,
a restaurant, and a movie thea-
tre had given athletes discounts.

Two days later it was report-
ed that Michigan State Uni-
.versity athletes were getting
similar benefits.

Dewey said he will go to
M.S.U. to investigate the situa-
tion there after finishing his
probe in Ann Arbor.

At Michigan State, the Daily
reported that —- in addition to
Discounts -— athletes there were
allowed to charge long-dis-
lance phone calls to the number
oi one of the football coaches
and were given "grill passes"
[or use at campus snack bars.

It also reported that Duffy
Daughterty head football coach
ut M.s.u., had paid for a trip
to the school for parents of n

football-playing prospective stu-
dent.

Under Big Ten rules it is il~
legal for member schools to pay
for such trips.

After reading the Dally story
Daughterty said he might sue
for libel, Since then, however,
he has not indicated whether or
not he intends to go ahead with
the suit.

Doughterty and other coaches
at the two schools could be sub-
ject to discipline by the Big
Ten if the investigation shows
the discounts and other benefits
were used to help recruiting.

Several athletes said they were
informed of the discounts dur-
ing recruitment.

I' Today’s lesson is, “How I found Happiness by belng Obnoxious
during 1. M. Basketball" or “What to do when the other team is
Wretched.”

Take, for example, the case of Langsu and South playing the
Bates “B” team. One cannot fully understand the illustration un-
less they have been fortunate enough to see Gates play, but an
inalOgous situation would be to correlate Gates to the March of
Dimes poster girl; any other team to Bob Hayes and then stage
n footrace. Gates takes the apparently outmoded view that I. M.‘s
I; for fun and, therefore, the “n" learn is out to have a good
1 2.

Enter the Villain (Stage Left). "If we put on a fullconrt press,
we could probably score lot) points and that would prove that we
Ire really good.“ 50 South scores 103 and Langan scores 10] and
a good time is had by all, right? Please pardon my reticence but
I'm apparently not up-to-date with the new I. M. philosophy.

Give me a chance, though, I‘ve got a ping-pong match sched-
uled with a double amputee.

Smith took a commanding lead in the basketball standings by
Mating Dibble twice. The next night Dibble beat West in both
games to regain second place. Smith has lost one game; Dibble
three; West four.

There are only two unbeaten teams left in the league, East
"A" and smith “B”. with the quality of competition at a seem.
Ingly higher level this year, these records are quite enviable.

l. M. ping-pong will be held this Sunday with Doug Gilbertson
If East back to defend his singles title. In other miscellaneous
news, the top five teams in the college bowling league are within
two points of each other.

WRESTLING WRAP-UP

G-MEN MMTEB F03 LAW OF DENH

By JEFF SCHECKTER
5&1; Pioneer Analyst

It is ﬁnally time to take a
look at the Grinnell Wrestling
team, now that only the Midwest
Conference Championships are
left in the season.

The Wrestlers feel, apparently,
that it is infeasible for a Pio-
neer team to win more than
two contests in any season. Like
the football team and the basket-
ball team, the wrestling team
has won only two meets and
now has a 2-12 dual meet rec-
ord. As Coach Pfitsch recently
said, “Iowa’s ‘ Fe b ru ary
weather is frigid and Grinnell
College‘s sports have not been
much better.”

Most of the wrestling team‘s
problems stem not from poor
wrestling but from a lack of
depth. with only eight regular
varsity wrestlers, the squad is
forced to give up between fif-
teen and twenty points a
match.

Looking back to the beginning
of the semester, the grapplers
lost to Knox 2642 on January
26. The Pioneers won four of
the six matches wrestled but
gave up 20 points in forfeits.
Winners for Grinnell were Mike
Martinson (123), Joel Richman
(130), Bob Jenkins (145) and
Bill Wedding (167).

On February 5, the team took
on Cornell, the best team in
the conference, and lost 32-9.
Martinson won EH), Jenkins 673
and Wedding 6~Z for the Grin-
nell points. The Pioneers also
lost on the following Saturday
to the same Cornell team in
a quad meet. Grinnell was
fourth behind Cornell, Drake
and Coe. Bob Jenkins was the
only winner for Grinnell.

On February 14, Simpson and
Drake arrived to battle the
Pioneers. Grlnnell lost to Drake
2341 but beat Simpson 19-15.
Jenkins, Richman and Wedding
had double wins (or the Grim
nell squad. Other winners for
the Pioneers were Mike Mar-
tlnson with a win and u draw,
and Lou Kelley by forfeit.

Three days later, Grinnell
lost to Western Illinois 298
and Monmouth 21-14. In the
Western lllinois match, Rich-
rnan won $3, Wedding won by
forfeit and three Pioneer wres-
tlers were pinned. Monmouth
lost bouts to Martinson 3—0,
Jenkins 3-0, Shaw (draw), Wed-
ding 4-3, and Swnrtwood 6‘1.

In the most recent matches.
Grinnell lost conference match-

The Pioneers stand quite a
good chance in the Midwest
Conference Championships. Bob
Jenkins and Bill Wedding am
undefeated in conference coma
petition and should have a very
good chance at taking the gold
medals. Don Kraitslk is defend-

ing champion at 157 pounds and
has a good chance to repeat
with a little luck. Joel Richman
and Mike Martinson are our
other hopefuls, but the 115 and
123 weight classes are very
tough this year.
