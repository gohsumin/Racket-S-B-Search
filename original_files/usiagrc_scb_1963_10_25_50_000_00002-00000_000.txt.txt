i Apathy and Need for Reform

The students or the United States rarely get
\zl‘y involved in things political. Now and their
t'icre will be a small demonstration in tront ot
the Wirite House, or yuuperative rcsolutrons
pissed by scatter-ed student seirates, but seldonr

any concerted action taken by any large group

students The closest thing Lo 3 student move-

nt that this country has seen in recent years is
the present struggle tor civil rights. Uniortunate—
ly, however, the activists in civil rights are iew
and tar between. Most at us are happy to give our
opinions, but tew icel concerned enough to get in.
v ilvcd in doing anything,

The most important explanation ior this lack

. involvemcnt by the US. student community is

s:iuply the tact that there is no distinct student

community. In many countries oi the world, uni»

varsity students are very conscious that they are

a separate classin the society. wrth ways at think-
irg and sets at valu - all oi their own.

Th is especially true in the stilHleveL
oping nations. Through the process oi chum»
tion, students in these countries became aware
that there are alternatives to the way things
are happening. They become aware that de-
mocrncy is an alternative to repressive gov-
ernment. and that social and economic rc-
ior-in is air alternative to the miserable liic oi
the great majority or their people. The result
is usually an intense impatience with the
way things are being rrrn. otten this dissﬁts
istaetion blossoms into rebellion,

In Por-tugcse Airica today, the students oi Ana
grin and other territories are in open revolt
against their colonial governments, which havn
instituted a repressive caste system and reiuscd
education to the mascs

Students iii Iran have engaged in nonsviolenl
demonstrations against thoIShah's brutal reprcs
son or educational and religious ircctlom.

The National Union oi Iraqi Students
was an active iorce in the success at the revs
olutiou of February, 1963, which overturned

the regime oi Gencral Kassern. Tlrc NUIS is
now working with tiic new government, at.
tempting to set up a tree and open society in
tree.

The Dtiwrliel‘ r gime in Haiti has or solved
all student organizations and has made the Uni-
vc ty oi Haiti into a State Institution, attcr his
policies were opposed by Urrivcrsrty students

In Paraguay, the government has moved to

destroy the national union oi students, FUP, antl‘

has forced FUP I‘rcsldcnt Osvaldo
exile,

The national union or students oi South Airica
is engaged in an intense struggle against the
apartheid policies at the pi sent government. They
are demanding iull social and political eduality
tor all the people oi their country. Almost all oi
the students involved are whites.

More cxarnplcs could be cited, but they all
have the same two common elements: (1) There

Rosas into

is intense and unified political action by students, ,

and (El this action is directed toward social re.
form.

. Does this occur because other students
are more conccrned about their country and
their people than are the students or the 11.5.?
I t'lou't think so. And there certainly are
enough oi us ready to rebel, given the a. use.
The big diiierence is the tact that there is no
widely iclt need ior major rcioi-ms in this
country. except perhaps in the area oi civil
rights. We have driited along withorrt ever
doing much, because there was never very
much we needed to do.

The danger is that, alter all ot these ycars,
we may not rccogliide a real problem when we
see one, Many studcnts see such an issue in the
battle ior civil rights, whether this is a widely
held conviction has yet to be tound out. (Maybe.
as a bare stari to check on this scntiment. let's
count how many people are willing to part with
some oi their old books, vitally needed to educate
other Americans)

i In the long- run. how advantageous is it to

iLet there be no question that the USSR. is otrr

The summer wheat crop in the USSR. has
tailed miserably; Khrushchev’s agricultural pro

Agl culture Freeman made a trip to farming re—
gions oi the Soviet Union in mid-July, only to re—
port a lrlghly ineii'icient tar-m program, This
crucial economic [ailure rcllects directly upon
the drawbacks oi the communist system. since
the Soviets are trying to outdo the United States
economically, this agricultural tailure is a signitie

By selling them wheat. even at a domestic
pilce, we would be bailing the Russian Come
munists out of a serious problem, Surely the
United States needs the gold from such a wheat
sale, but do we need 'it at the expense oi
strengthening the Communist regime" isn‘t this a
step that might help to bring about the reality ol‘
Khrushchev's boast: ‘We will bury you!" Would
the sale symbolize the tree-world‘s resistance to
communism?

How can the United States expect the tree
