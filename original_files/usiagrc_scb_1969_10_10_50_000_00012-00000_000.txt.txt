win total or last year’s squad,
with live games left to play.

The Pioneers were able to
stay with St. Olaf tor a halt.
but were unable to stop the Oles
in the latter part or the game.
St. Olai, led by their star full<
back Gunderson, tallied 34
points on the scoreboard in the
last halt, while reruslng to yield
a single point to the Pioneers.
The hot weather, St. Olai’a
large numerical edge, and
injuries were probably the
major causes of the Pioneer
downfall.

ing as well as a deieat. Jim
Edwards, Scott Hanson. Tum

third game in a row the Pio-
neers jumped on to a quick
lead on first hali goals by Tom
Lincoln, Bruce Graham and
Hugh Magee.

lead disappear when lSU scored
three goals in the first twenty
minutes of the second hall. The
Pioneers had several scoring
chances later in the second half

Pioneers have seen three games
go up in smoke because of
second half defensive mistakes,
There have been several
position changes on the squad
with Dave Caron being moved
to fullback and Don Peterson
becoming the new goalie.

Climb Rocks on Cedar River

and get climbing experience on
the palisades next to the waten

At the practice lock in Pall-
sades-Kepler, Asst. Prolessor
Robert Christiansen (math) was
showing new rock climbers the
ropes.

“0n belay," called the be-
ginner, inspecting the bowlina
knot around his middle. That
meant that he had one end of a
rope securely holding him.

“On belay,” irom overhead.
Thai mean that another climber
tied to a tree on top. had the
other end secure, to stop ialls.

"Climbing."

“Climb." He found iingers
holds and lodges as he went up
the practice rock. His belayer
took up the slack rope irnm
above. ~

“Fallingi” the Climber yelled.
He wasn’t really in a precariour
position. This was a practice
rail. Wondering it this belaying
thing was really going to work,
he grabbed the rope and pushed
away from the rock. Dangling,
ha yelled “Slack.” The belayer
let him down easy.

Everyone took a turn belaying

one hand to save someone else
from falling. But it worked
every time.

It was also scary to back off

though the rig ior “rappelling"
looks reasonable, it is a matterI
at taking your life in your brake
hand.

Rappeiling is a way ior a
climber to lower himself down
a cliii on a rope. He is attached
to the rope with another rope
sling and some hardware which
exerts friction. The rappel rope,
in one method, runs behind one
leg, held in front with the brake
hand (gloved ior skin's sake.)
The brake hand can control the
speed as the climber slides
down the rope, He pushes him-
seli away from the rock with
outstretched ieet, as he lowers.

One beginner forget her
