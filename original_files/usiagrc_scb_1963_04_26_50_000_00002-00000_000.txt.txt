social budgets were invented.

The SGA President was able to ensure a SGA budgeti

ever had. He even has an undefined symposium listedl

The Scarlet and Black, unrepresented in the Executive
Cabinet, was given $5,300. The‘ Editor didn’t get to sit

Cabinet recommended the cut. the damage was done.

It must be remembered, how»l
ever, that Grinnell is an educa-l
‘tional institution, where social,
lattivxty is and should be scc
ondal'y; and it is doubtful. at
least according to President
Bowen’s tigurcs, that girls here
have suiIiClent time to devote
‘to being sexy.

‘ In placing the blame for our
present social stagnation entires
,ly on the i-csidcnts oi south
campus, Miss Sutlcy has ignor-
ed one-halt oi the total situa-‘
tion. The fact is, rm sad to‘
say, that ii colllronted by a
charming. feminine. and sexy
young woman, many Grinncll
“men" wouldn't know what to
do with her. on or off campus.l
