NSA and the national atiaii-s
committee of the senate, Elec-
tion oi the delegates to the
NSA convention is now by
campus vote. This means that
the candidates tor president oi
SGA (who used to bc a dele-
gate automatically) are not
forced to run on their stands
regarding national issues and
partisan politics.

Boston hopes to arouse inter-7
est in the election ot the doles
gates in the spring. He suggest-
ed the possibility oi a Conven»
tion at which each candidate
would express his opinion on the
issues that are certain to come
up at the national convention.
He would also like to see the
organization or the regional NSA
made more cheetivc.

Evalutioii of the relation oi
the national aliairs committee
to other campus organizations
which deal with national and
political issues (Young Demos
crats, Young Republicans, IRC,
etc.) is important, Boston feels.
It can then disseminate value
able intormation to these groups.
(He cited as an example that
the committee has been receiv-
ing an average at two letters a
week trom NSA concerning segv
i-rgaticii.)

“The Senate has gone Iurtllr

million to public junior colleges,
authorized $1.2 billion to be
used tor scholrrslilps to able
but needy students. The bills
must now be reconciled in joint

‘Ccmmiltee.

“It is most important that
the bill be reported Substantialr

ly as passed in the Senate. The
need tor ﬁnancial assistance tor
college attendance is great. As
president Kennedy pointed out
in his February a message to
Congress, a college education

Queried about, whether the
act primarily on
campus or national oilairs, he
replied that he feels its primary
concern should be to govern
the student body and make stua

plcasant liowevcr, it should

the possibility or broadcasting

doubts tlic value of this ior

they tend to be lengthy Often
a controversial issue is not con-

Regarding student interest in

he is not sure oi the reason or

to we Republicans blastedSunday

by Dave Golden
lowa Republicanism and the
adininistrationn ot Governor Nor-
nian Erbc underwent iiitensc
criticism here Sunday when
“Campaign issues for 1962‘
were discussed by three state
Democratic legislators in Youn-
Iker lounge. They were Andrew
30. Frommclt, Democratic llooi
'leader in (he lowa Senate, Scott
iSwlshcr, Democratic floor lead-
er in the Iowa House, and C.
Edwin Gilmour (political s
fence), lowa state senator tor
Powoshick and Keokuk counties

The discussion closed the day:

in lowa with a discussion o
the contiovcrsial Shall plan loi-
representative rcapportionment
Citing rcapportionmeiit as being
lesseiitial to the “rebirth" ol lowa
they urged that the Shall plan
Passed by both houses of the
lowa General Assembly last Ses»
sion, be dctcatcd when it comes
up next session tor the required
second Assembly approval.

If the Shatt Plan is passed.
the roles ot the two legislative
houses will be reversed, Senate
seats would be assigned on a
population distribution basis,
and the House would become
an area body with one Ropi-
sentetivc per county. Senators;
would retain their tour, year
term oi otiice, and Represent-
atives their two year term. ,

Fl'ommelt stated that this
plan, advocated by the con-
servative Farm Bureau, would
give the rural areas cvcii
greatci- coiitrol- over the state
and would tend to iiinkc the
entire c neral Assembly more
conservative in nature.

‘ Two courses of action were
lsuggcsted by the panel to counr
lter the Shalt Plan. The first
.would be to amend the plan in
lthe General Assembly. Senatoi

Frommelt accused Erlie of
iiscal irresponsibility by al-
lowing the state‘s money rc—
serves to dwinille to $15 mil—
lion —— $9 million less than the
stiﬂe treasurer stated was
needed to keep Iowa solvent.
This overexpendilurc forced
Erbe to borrow from the Rand

Use Tax Fund.

Fl’ommclt urged that the vet-
ers elect people who will raise
the needed revenues to pay for

the state's expenditures, instczld‘

of lowering them as Erbc did, By
lowering the state property tax,
ri-oiniuelt pointed out that the

burden for old age welfare ant"

school aid programs was being
shitted to the counties,

Swisher continued the attack
by stating that the Republican
party in lowa is run by and tor
the benciit ol big business alone,
that the Republican party laces
modern problems with 19th
Century slogans such as “Clean
as a hound's tooth," and “No
lips that touch liquor will touch
mine."

Swisher cmphnsizcd the
point that the Democratic par-
ty is the party oi progress,—
