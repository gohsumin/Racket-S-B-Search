LIBRARY COMPROMISE

President Glenn Leggett announced his promised Feb. 1 de-

cision on library closing hours early Thursday evening In a letter
to iaculty and students, Leggett indicated that the Library would
remain open until 12 midnight on all nights except Saturday.

During ﬁnal papers and examinations, however, the library

WIII remain open until at least 1:00 A.M, or later.

Tho decision represents l compromise between the demands

oi many students that the library stay open until 1:00 AM. and
the recommendation or the Faculty Library Committee that the
library maintain its present 11:15 PM, closing time.

Closing hours for all classroom buildings (except Darby Gym-

nasium) — now 11:00 P.Mi — will in revised depending on cost
and availability of BM} stain

The letter also stated that Forum and North Campus Inungl

closing hours would remain the same, and that South Campus
lounges Will remain open until twelvn midnight subject to th!

quest ot hurling Library desk).

AS a poet, Borges has been
credited with beginning new
trends since 1923 when his first
collection oi works appeared,
As a critic, he is responsible
for the introduction of the
works oi many Anglo-Saxon
writers into Latin America,

Borges conception oi the re
liltionshlp between the writer
and his reader is perhaps best
summarized in his preface to
Fervol- de Buenos Aires:

“II the pages oi this collec-
tion oiier some spark oi poetry,
please iorgive one ion the dis-
courtesy of being iirst in ap-
propriatlng it. Your nothingness
and mine differ but little. TIlE
fact that you are the reader
and I the writer . . . is an ac<
Eident.”
