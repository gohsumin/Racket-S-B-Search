‘Committee on Student Affairs
Defines Its Function. Position

For the past several weeks, the
Faculty Committee on Student‘Af-
fairs has been cooperating with the

5&1! preparing statements in an»
swer to questions prepared by the
paper in an attempt to make the
committee, its functions, and its
position in the college community
more clear to the student body.
The Committee on Student Af-
inirs is a standing committee of
the Faculty established by the
Faculty and the President.

The purpose at the Committee on
Student Affairs are (l) to advise
the President on policies, pro
eedures, rules, and penalties in the
area of student conduct and dis-
cipline; (2) to participate in the
process or changing “basic rules
and penalties," as provided by the
legislation of the Trustees; and
(a) to consider and decide cases
within its purview and, under ap-
propriate conditions, to review its
decisions. In its function of ad-
iudicating cases, the Committee
has duties specified in the legisla-
tion of the Faculty (approved by
the President) establishing the
Committee.

The Committee’s responsibility
is to use procedures which accord
with standards of fairness and
which meet the college's need for
general observance of policies and
rules pertaining to conduct in col-
lege.

The Committee on Student Af-
fairs, insofar as its duties extend
into the adjudication of cases, has
an administrative function. Specifi-
cally, its relationships to adminis-
trative officials stated in its list of
duties.

The Committee does not con-
sider every rule violation. As the
statement of its duties indicates,
it will consider and decide cases
which come to it (1) upon a recom-
mendation of suspension or dismis-
sal, or (2) upon a specification
that the case is within the Com-
mittee’s purview.

The committee may find grounds
for suspension or dismissal in the
facts of a violation of rules of Con»
duct stated in the Student Hand-
book.

The Committee will make its
ground rules for hearing cases.
This is a question that the Commit-
tee should answer with reference
details and with due regrad to
standards of fairness.

The Committee on Student Af-
fairs has authority to review its
own decisions. No formal pro-
eedure for appeal is provided.

This committee was created by
the faculty in the fall of 1963 as a
standing committee, but its duties

Students Chosen to
Leave for LeMoyne

The final selection of stu—
dents to attend LeMDyne Col-
. iege next semester was an-
nounced by Dale Terry (regis
trar) just before Christmas va-
cation. Those who will attend
are Mike Fort and Cynthia
artist, juniors, and Jim Steph-
ens .and Margaret Bluhm, soph»
ornores. They will be the first
Grinnell students to attend Le
Moyne as part of the new ex-.
._change program.

 

were substantially revised in the
fall of 1964. The committee is
standing, but its membership and
its particular concerns may he
changed by the faculty upon the
recommendation of the Committee
itself.

Faculty concern and fairly di-
rect involvement in student affairs
has been a part of the Grinnell
scene for many years. Certainly
the College is now profiting by in-
creased concern on the part of
everyone about the “style of
life” of Grinnell students (or some
Grinnell students) and about a dis-
parity that appears to exist be»
tween the academic and social ef-
fectiveness of the College.

The committee was asked also
to comment on whether they were
considering any major organiza-
tional changes for North campus.
The following is their statement
on this matter.

“Various ideas (wished - {or
changes in student government,
the presence of adults in the dorms
BS advisers, better distribution 0f
classes within the halls, less
rigidity in hall dividing-lines. etc.)
have been discussed and studied,
but at present there are no plans
as such, especially since the Com-
mittee cannot, by itself, effect or-
ganizational changes. Any changes
will no doubt come about through
the usual process of consultation
with all elements of the College
community, including students.
Such consultation is in fact now
going on (these questions and re
sponses being a part of it)."

More answers will emerge as the
Committee goes about its business
of fulfilling its duties. It cannot set
out a code or regulations designed
to specify in advance the details
of every possible Violation of rules
and the details of the solution of
every case. Law is not made that
way, either outside the college or
within the college. The Commit-
tee’s job, in considering and de-
oiding cases which come to it, is
to apply the reasonable clear rules
(stated in the Student Handbook)
in ways which will safeguard the
college and a system of living in
which Student responsibility meas-
ures up to the freedom which stu-
dents have under the rules.
