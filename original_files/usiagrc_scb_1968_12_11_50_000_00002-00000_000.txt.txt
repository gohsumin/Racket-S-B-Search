The Semester’s End

The semester has been a tempes-
tuous one. There was the Schneirov
trial, the declarations of home rule,
the President’s proposal on visitations,
the addition of students to faculty
committees, and the course evaluation
form. For every extraordinary event
that happened, countless routine ones
occurred. But history is concerned
with the ”great and wonderful deeds
of men," and a newspaper is con<
cerned with what is new, whether it
be great and wonderful or ugly and
base, It is generally through what is
extraordinary and unusual that we
come to an appreciation of an era.

Students have shown the charac-
teristics of students everywhere. They
may have become famous for their
more sensational and foolish deeds,
but they have also done a few con-
structive things. Events that are sen-
sational, such as scandals having to do
with visitations, may appear often in
the national papers, but they are no
more important than such enterprises
as the Course Evaluation Committee,
which, despite the numerous short-
comings of its evaluation form,
showed a genuine interest in improv-
ing what ought to be the primary con-
cern of the student—his curriculum.

For every good thing that the stu-
dents do, they probably do at least
two bad things, for they are young,
and Zeus’ second urn is twice as large
as his first. But such is the destiny of
students, and of all mankind, and we
should not, perhaps, be too hard on
them.

A Correction

Last week we printed a story on
the meeting of the Humanities Divi-
sion which contained numerous er-
rors. We attributed certain remarks to
Mr. Zitner Which were erroneous. We
reported that professors were invited
to the meeting. The meeting was for
the chairman of the division, the
chairman of the division's E.P.C., and
junior and senior maiors only. For our
errors, unintentional yet serious, we
apologize.

The Last Editorial

An editor’s first editoral has the
characteristics of youth — it is more
idealistic than it ought to be, it re-
veals impossible expectations, and it
often falsely assumes a knowledge of
men’s motivations. An editor’s last
editorial has the marks of old age—it
is cynical, and the editor, having been
frustrated in his expectations more of-
ten than not, and having discovered
the weakness of the word in influenc-
ing the behavior of men, and having
learned, as Aristotle said, that most
human things turn out to be worth not
much, usually complains of the lack
of support given his newspaper.

In this, my last editorial, I shall
neither deny that I have been frus-
trated in my expectations, nor shall
I complain that working on the news-
paper has been unrewarding and
miserable. I shall simply whisper my
gratitude to those who helped this
newspaper to appear.

The people of Buildings and
Grounds, who generously allowed us
a use of the college wagon and
helped us to overcome bureaucratic
obstacles in obtaining the car, are
thanked. I thank the countless peo-
ple who, because I myself do not
know how to drive, drove me to
Newton, where our paper is printed.
Mr. Turek, and the other printers,
must be thanked for putting up with
our youthful and inexperienced in-
competence.

Our many writers, who had to
endure moderately strict deadlines
and my own grouchiness, are thanked
for their dedication and tolerance.
John Gardner and Mark Sableman,
who showed great zeal and willing-
ness to do news stories, are particular—
ly acknowledged, Thanks go also to
Don Hooker and Sue Miller, who, dur-
ing my first week with the S&B, pro-
vided advice and many hours of as-
sistance to the new editor, who had
no previous experience in journalism,
except for the publication of the David
M. Gibson Memorial Newsletter. To
the others who helped with headlines,
proof-reading, and general advice, I
give my sincere thanks.

No thanks can signify the extent
of my gratitude to Katherine New-
kirk, the managing editor, for her ex-
cellent work,

Well, to the new editor, Susan
Kaeser, I wish good luck, and to all, a
pleasant vacation.

BRIDGE: POST MORTEMﬁ

Hy .iOl-llv GORDLEY

For those who still have last
week's paper, try counting the
errors made by the author as
a test of your awareness of the
absurd. Then add one for allow-
ing the “boy wonder” to Write
the column in the first place.

To finish off the semester
properly, here is a description
of new conventions and plays
invented by the bridge enthu-
slasts of the Forum.

1) The Goftlieb 3 Spadesl
played by Marcus Goulieb,
holder of the Alpha Bridge Cen-
ter Booby Prize. After a one
spade bid by partner, lump (0
three spades with less than live
points and three spades below
the ten in hand.

2) The Shaw Club Coup: or-
lginated by John Shaw, distin-
guished Classical Languages
major, this play involves lead-
ing a low club from hoard miss-
ing the Ace»King. When the op
poneni in second position plays
low, cover with the Queen in
hand. When the other opponent,
who hasn't been paying aiien~
flan, asks who played this

Queen, immediately inform him
that It was his panner and take
the trick us he plays low from
his King.

a) The Mannheimer 2-sult fl-
nesse; initiated by the lamoul
Des Moines miracle, this spa.
cializecl play requires the Ace.
Queen oi Spades and low dia-
menu: In hands and low spade!
and the AcerQueen of diamond:
on the board. [inadvertently
leading a low spade instead of
diamond, and seeing it covered
by the Jack, play the Queen 01
diamonds in hopes that the 0px
position won’t notice.

4) The Gottlieb Twoway FL
hesse: after having successful-
ly flnessed the King of Hearts
from board to hand, lead a low
heart to the jack in dummy.
hoping to catch the opponent
with the King off guard.

These are only a few or the
many variations brazenly at.
tempted this semester in the
Forum. But with the limitless
imagination 01 our players, the
possibilities for unortho-
dox bridge are excellent for
next year.

tellers lo the Editor

Approves Bangel‘l’s

‘Freedom of Speech'

To die Editorl

i would like to applaud Mr.
Bangert for the line sentiment
shown in his letter to the S“!
of Nov. 29, I also believe that
it is the duly oi every member
or the community lo express his
beliefs, however contrary these
might be lo the opinions of the
community at large. This is one
of the reasons that I feel that
students who are dissatisfied
with the nature of the social
and academic atmosphere of
Grinnell College have a “right
and a responsibility" to seek an
elimination of the archaic
values (morality, if you will)
upon which this institution seems
to rest.

i do have a “sneakng suspi-
cion that morality is important,"
but i also have a sneaking sus-
picion that when one attempts
to impose his morality on others
one may find himself ”convert-
ing the infidel" or “making the
world safe for Democracy."
While i don’t wish to go on re-
cord as completely condemning
all attempts at moral activism,
I wlll cite the fact that the great»
est sins perpetrated upon man<
kind were misguided attempts
of men who felt it was their
duty to correct the wrongs of
society. But please don't con-
fuse the opinions of the outspok-
en majority (if i may call them
ihat) with such attempts io im-
pose a morality on the entire
student body, They are only
seeking to eliminate artiﬁciality
of a system which divests them
oi freedom and encourages ir-
responsibility (for freedom en—
tails responsibility), and this in-
dlvniual freedom is not synon»
immls with a lack oi morality.
Certainly all signiﬁcant human
activlty involves moral deci-
sions. Society seeks in place
those incapable of making such
decisions correctly in its eyes

(which like human eyes aren't
perfect) into prison or mental
institutions. While Grinnell
might bare a resemblance lo
both aforementioned vehicles, it
doesn't profess in be either.
Theoretically it should (Within
legal institutional iimits—nelil’h
er oi which are as rigorous as
our Student Handbook would
lead one to believe) grant its
reasonably intelligent and ma-
lure student body at least that
degree of freedom to which it
is entitled by the society apart
from Grinnell.

Admittedly in some areas it
grants us more, for which we
should be thankful, but it should
strive to change those aspects
which are deficient. Every stu-
dent, regardless oi his opinion,
should have something to say
while such changes are under~
taken and l lirmly agree wilh
Mr. Bangert that everyonu
should speak out.

Judges Ethics, Social
Sludies Courses

To the Editor:

I must express my personal
opinion of the merit of tho
seminar in ethical discussion
course, especially the insiruo—
wr's role as a resource person in
the field of group dynamics.
We were not limited to any
one method of Class discussion.
I looked forward to the evening
meetings just to see what Haas
and Worley had come up wirh
this time. Then they did some-
thing really revolutionary, i
think H they asked us what
we wanted to do. And we did
it. We’ve been through the
classical approach — you know.
Aristotle, Plato, Hume, Mill.
Kant, ad lnﬁnitum. We chucked
that after a quarter; men the
Students did ihcir thing. Yep,
