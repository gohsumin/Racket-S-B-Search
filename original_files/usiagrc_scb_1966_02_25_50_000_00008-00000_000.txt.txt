Cagers Fall to 1-12 Conference Mark

Pioneers Succumb
To Beloit and Coe

’ The Pioneer basketball
team, experiencing another
frigid weekend in shooting,
lost twice more to fall to 1-12
in the conference.

Friday Beloit humiliated
the Pioneers 98-70 and Satur-
day Coe avenged their earlier
defeat 76-68.

Lawrence and Ripon
This weekend the hoopsters
will travel to Lawrence and
Ripon, two teams that have
ﬁlready registered wins at
arby.
The team is hopeful of at

least a win at Lawrence, be-
cause they are one of the
weaker teams in the confer-
ence.

Any dreams of an upset of
Beloit were overturned early
as the Bucs roared out to a
commanding lead right away
and then held it for the rest
of the game.

The ha me score was 49-
24, while in the second half
with substitutes going for
both sides, the Pioneers were
only outscored 49-46.

Pool" Shooting

Poor shooting was again
the villain. Beloit only took
one more shot than the Pio-
neers but made twelve more
field goals. The rebounding

was good though — the Pio-
neers matched the Bucs 45-45.

The Ode game was close
most of the way until the K0-
hawks’ John Valentine sank
a coupleof baskets near the
end of the game.

At the half the Pioneers
were down 39-36. While stay-
ing close in the second half,
the hoopsters were never able
to tie or take the lead. Finally
Coe pulled away for the 76-
68 win.

This time the Pioneers got
only five fewer field goals
than their opponent, but they
shot thirteen more times.

Leading scorer over the
weekend was Elliott Hibbs
who notched 27 points. Tom
Hill was next with 24.

As Conference Meet Looms Ahead

The Grinnell track team yester-
day lost what was being billed as

Mermen Face ‘0lympic' Challenge

Final Meet Serves

As League Tune-up

Rapped by Knox and Cornell in
their last two outings, the Grinnell
Collegeswimmers will be trying to
get back on the beam when they
compete in Augustana's viking o-
lympics at Rock Island, 111., to-
morrow.

The Olympics close Grinnelrs
regular season schedule and pro
vide a final tuneup for the Mid-
west Conference meet March 45.

Through Experimenting

“We’re through experimenting,"
said Coach lrv Simone. “We now
know what we want to do for the
conference meet and will concen-
trate on those areas at Augustana
and in practice next week, it we
can get ourselves untracked psy-
chologically and put the final edge
on our physical conditioning, we
could pull a few surprises at the
conference."

Top Pioneer bets for points at
the Augustana meat, which always
draws a strong field, appear to be
Ken Adelman and Steve Holtze.

Holtze Gets First

Holtze edged out Bob Reimers.
medley champ, for Grinnell's only
first at Cornell.

After having a bad day at Knox.
butterflyer Adelman rebounded for
a good race at Cornell and was
just touched out by Phil Gibbs, also

 

a defending league tltlist. The set»
backs were the first for Adelman
in two seasons of dual meet com-
petition.

The Olympics will also offer
sprinter Bill Lontz some of the
action he badly needs after miss-
ing a week of practice because or
two burned hands. Though the time
he lost came at the most critical
stage of the season, Simone is hop-
ing Lontz can regain enough of
his conditioning to be a threat at
the conierence meet.

rnament Match

was accepted at the 123 lb. divis-
ion.
Strubler, Sharpe Win

Ken Strubler and John Sharpe
won easily by identical 14-3 scores.
Gary Wilson also won by decision
heating last year's conference
champion. 8-4. Bob Geller drew at
the 177 lb. level,

The season's last dual meets
prior to conference will take place
here Saturday at 1:00. Grinnell
Will host a double dual with Cornell
and Grinnell vs, Carleton and St.
Olaf.

Coach Moore, pleased with the
turnout and support given the mat-
men against Cornell earlier this
month, hopes to see an even larger
crowd tomorrow afternoon.

Title Contenders

With three conference title can
tenders purportedly on hand,
Moore ensures an eventful day.

Carleton, too, may prove tough,
for in the past they have proven
themselves comparable to St, Olaf
scorewise when both wrestled the
same team.

St, Olaf, though considered A
power, is also still somewhat of a
question mark. They do have a
fine team, but just where there
strength lies is uncertain.

Saturday will enable Grinnell to
evaluate more accurately just
what its chances tor a conterence
crown are next week at Beloii.

 

Four-Way Battle to

Four teams remained snarled a-
top the overall standings as the
LM. basketball season neared its
close this week. Crucial action in
the ‘A' division sow Dibble and
Cowles shaded out of contention,
while Smith‘s resurgent ‘B’ squad
boosted them into second place.
Clark's ‘A' unlt rode Bill Lee's 23
points past Smith, 66-58, to keep its
hopes olive, and North held on by
sweeping a pair from Cowles.
Darkhorse Rawsun has already finA
ished with a surprising record of
1+6, including a soar upset or
North's undefeated ‘3' team.

tested (and liberallyofficiated) bat-
ties of the year, Smith‘s or group
