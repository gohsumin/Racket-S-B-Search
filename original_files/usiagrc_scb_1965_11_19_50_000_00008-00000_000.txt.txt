Pioneers ﬁnish Season Victorious

To Take Conference Runner-up

The Pioneer gridmen finished
off their season last Saturday with
a hard-fought 42720 victory over
Carleton to secure second place
in the conference. Relying heavily
on Dick Lamb running, Barry An-
derson passing, and Carleton rnis-
Cues, the Pioneers were able to
fight off a Carleton rally in the
fourth quarter when they had only
a precarious 27-20 lead. They fi-
naily scored two insurance touche
downs to sew up the victory.

the Pioneers got two more breaks.
Paul Thurston recovered a film-

But the Pioneers were forced to

scored on a forty yard pass to tie
the score.

The tie was soon broken after
Jim Cearnal had electrified the
crowd with a 71 yard kick—off re-

eight. Three plays later fullback
Jon Buswell bucked into the end
zone. A Barry Anderson to John
Shierholz pass on the conversion
gave the Pioneers a 146 lead.

The play turned a little sloppy
when, on three consecutive drives,
passes were intercepted. Rich
Weeks picked off the first one for
the Pioneers. But after the Pie:

game. The inspired Carls quickly
forced the Pioneers to punt after
the kick-off. In six plays, four of

drove 85 yards and made a two

gain that it was tough on the run-
ning and short yardage situations
while its pass defense was a little
less stingy. Carleton was only able
to gain 24 yards in 38 carries on
the ground but were able to pass
for 240 yards in 31 attempts.
These figures are slightly decopa
tive though because the Carls had
a good passer in John Worcester
and an excellent receiver in jun.

gathered in ten passes.
