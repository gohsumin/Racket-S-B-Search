Double Duol Faces
Mormon Tomorrow

With most of the kinks
worked out following a month
and a half break, Grinnell's
matmen will open a heavy
February schedule by facing
Upper Iowa and Simpson in a
double dual at Indianola to-
morrow.

“We seem to be in good
health and fairly good condi-
tion,” observed Coach Edd
Bowers. The team warmed up
for the double dual by taking
the freshmen in a practice meet
last Saturday.

The probable Grinnell line-
up will have Bill Barnes at 123;

Gomez Reminisces
Al Honor 6 Dinner

By A] Gummerson

Lefty Gomez, whose fast ball
may now lack a little zip but
whose wit is still sharp, played
the George Jessel bit at. the
Honor G banquet January 27.
Introduced by Tom Bucliholtz
as the “depression era of Bo
Belinsky," Lefty spent half an
hour explaining how not to do
it in the big leagues. At the end
many were wondering how one
guy could do so many things
wrong and still spend 13 years
with the Yankees; his modesty
came as quite a surprise to
those who associate “former
major league pitcher" with
Dizzy Dean,

About all Lefty would take
credit for was getting other
guys into the Hall of Fame.
Like Jimmy Foxx, who hit over
600 home runs; Lefty takes
credit for serving up 49 of
them, Or Joe DiMaggio; Lefty
claims that if he hadn't been
pitching, no one would have
known that Joe could run back
on a ball. Joe was a member
of that “fast, friendly outfield"
which, along with clean livin’,
Lefty claims were the secrets
of his success. Lefty, like Mari-
lyn Monroe, is a former room-
mate of the Yankee Clipper.

Like 01’ D12, though, Lefty's
favorite topic of conversation
is his hitting, not his pitching.
He can recall getting only two
doubles in his entire career,
And one of those times he took
a foot lead off second and got
picked on. Well, knowing that
there was a sure tine waiting for
him if he went back to the
bench, he tried hanging around
second, promising the umpire
that he ”wouldn’t get in the
way." It didn't work, he went
back, he got fined, Then there
was the time that he was bat-
ting against a pitcher who threw
a blooper ball, a pitch Lefty

from these four plus the return
to health of Ringo and the de—
velopment of sophomores Dowl—
ing, Deatherage, and Geller
during the remainder of the
schedule, Ringo split a pair of
early season matches though
slowed by multiple injuries.
Deatherage and Geller each
has one decision to his credit.

By Nick Nonas and Jim Ramsey

It is with hesitation that any
sports writer attempts a pro-season

basketball prediction, and we too
have our misgivings about the outa
come of the 1965 IM action. The
diificulty lies in finding a suitable
criterion on which to judge the
worth of a team. Certain writers
will maintain that 3 teams shooting
eiiiciency is somewhat commena
surate to how abundantly endowed
its players are with chest hair, but
this is somewhat 3 Gross Point.
Others are of the persuasion that
there exists a positive correlation
between innate athletic ability and
high board scores. But the authen-
ticity or such determinants as veri-
ﬁable criterion is still dubious.
Thus, until this year, sports writ-
ers and general athletic supporters
alike were iorced to rely on their
crystal balls and any number of
educated guesses. But at last, some
thoughtful and astute sage has pro«
vided us with what would appear

to be a ioniproot scheme ior ac-
curate predictions: the number or

games a basketball team wins will
hear an inversely proportional re-
lationshlp to the number or instate
players on that team.

Since we are left in the dark as
to why this phenomena exists, we
must hypothesize on our own, Let
us assume from the outset that the
activation syndrome of in-state
basketball players is more sensitive
to the decibal level of home crowd
enthusiasm and noise, due to cer-
tain emotional ties (God, mother,
State, etc). A physical maniiesta.
tion of this syndrome is profuse
perspiration, hampering a cager's
over-all play. Have you ever tried
to shoot and dribble with sweaty
palms. On the basis of this logical
exposition and on a careiul statisti-
cal evaluation ot the geographical
distribution of the in players in
each hall, it is our prediction that
Loose Hall will walk away' with
the Basketball crown.

 

describes as looking like a
rainbow, like you were pitching
over a shed, When the hall
came down over the plate Lefty
grabbed it, threw it up and hit
it fungo~style. The ump, lacking
a sense of humor, tossed him
out of the game and fined him
$100. Another time in Cleveland
it was dark and raining and
the Indians were ahead, but
they were trying to finish off
the top of the fifth inning be-
fore calling the game so Cleve-
land would win. Lefty walked
up to the plate and lit a match,
explaining to the umpire that
he just wanted to make sure
the pitcher knew where he was.
Again he got a trip to the show-
ers which cost him a hundred.

 

We think of the fifties and six-
ties as the Era of the Big Bon-
us, but Lefty must have had a
nest-egg stashed away from
somewhere to fall back on
every time an antic "cost him
a hundred.”

All in all, it was the start
of a good evening, sitting
around with your Honor G
iriends, lighting each others
cigarettes, listening to Lefty
reminisce. But I guess for the
Honor G boys the evening was
only beginni since I heard
talk of “festi ties" which were
to commence at nine o’clock.
Probably some sort of a party
celebrating the entrance of sev-
eral new members into the
club.

 

Karate Lessons to Begin Soon

Karate lessons for beginning students will begin next Friday.
Instructor Jim Young urges anyone who is seeking a good con-
ditioner that is also a practical carry-aver sport to place a card
bearing his name and post office box number in box 1256 by
next Thursday morning. The size of the Class will be limited, so
acceptance will be in order of receipt of replies.

A feature article about the karate club will appear in next

week’s 5&3.
