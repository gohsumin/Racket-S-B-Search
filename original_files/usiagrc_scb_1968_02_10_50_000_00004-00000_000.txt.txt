DEFENDS GOP

By SUE MILLER

"The progressive way to deal
with racial moderation in the
‘deep South is not to talk about
it,” said Alabama Congressman
Jack Edwards at a South lounge
cotiee hour Monday afternoon,

Edwards, sponsored by the
Grinnell Young Republicans, and
brought here by the RSVP (Re-
pllbllcans Speak on vital Prob-
lems) group, was asked to speak
on the problem oi “The Future
DI the GDP in the South."

“Until more Negroes are reg-
istered.” he said, “a candidate
is not going to be out preaching
integration.”

“This is not my personal teelv
ing, but a person can't preach
it and win in the deep South."
“Again,” he emphasized, “l'm
taking practical politics to you;;
the Candidate that wins is not
going to say ‘I believe in inte-
gration.‘ "

"Calloway (Beau Galloway
who ran tor Republican governor
at Georgia) ignored the racial
moderation issue and almost
won, and Richard Flowers came
closest to anyone I know talking
about racial moderation, and lost
miserably."

Edwards himself, who, when
ﬁrst elected to Congress in 1964,
"had got less than one per cent
or the Negro vote in my dia-
trici,” in his 1966 re-eleclion, got
to per cent of the Negro vote
there.

"This was not too different
irom other Republican elections
In the Sout ,” he said.

In 1964, Edwards explained.
“We didn’t know any (Negroes),
nor (lid we ask them to vote.
Those Goldwater had asked, left
the party.”

In 1966, on the other hand,
“we made a conscious to do
what was right.”

“Military appointments were
made to Negro men in our high
schools,” he cited as an ex-
ample, “and we will have Ne-
groes as members or our county
committee.”

”This may not mean much to
you,” he continued, “but it you
can understand my part at the

including parts or it in concerts,
bind lhen had to learn other
songs to all up a program.
That's when we started writing
our own songs.”

Before she Joined her husband
as a performer, Caroline had
never sung “except in the bath-
tub." A lyric soprano reminis-
cent of Joan Baez, she was “dis—

heard her sing at a party.

country, its leading to the
proper inroads in doing what's
right tor the people, in assum-
ing the proper role in our gov-
erument.”

Edwards related three areas
or the Republican party group
in the deep South.

The first era, as Edwards sees
it, was the "Post Oliice Era."

“The Republicans in the South
never did anything, except meet
once a year to pick who'd go
to the national convention."

When there was a Republican
lor president (to, Eisenhower)
“they could decide who’d be
postmaster, carrier, etc.”

“They never really got inter-
ested in building the Republi-
can Party in the South.”

"They did start to build it
in 1960 in the Kennedy-Nixon
race," Edwards commented.
“Many border states and middle
states voted for Nixon."

The secund era was
Goldwater Era."

“The South’s big boost," Ed-
wards regarded the Goldwater
era as “the basic on which we
(Republicans) could start to
grow.“

“My own county, Mobile,
turned out eighty-five per cent
registered voters. In 1964 this
was unheard of in the South—
where the primaries were usual<
ly the election” — where the
person chosen by the primaries
became the candidate without
any problem."

“Many Republicans washed
right back out on that tide when
Goldwater lost. Many are now
in the Wallace campaign." he
added, bringing up the third
era — ”The Wallace Era." Bet-
ter known as "the last hoorah,"
Edwards Commented, it will ac-
culminate in Wallace’s running
for President on the Alabama
Democratic ticket.

“Wallace will head the tlc»
ket," he said, “not LBJ." “it
an the ballot at all, "LBJ will
be a third party candidate. In
1954 on the ballot in Alabama
were Wallace and Goldwater."

“Wallace can probably pick
up 45-50 electoral votes,“ he
predicted “and then they”

POLL SAYS
SAVE NORTH CAMPUS

Most of the 119 students who
responded to last week’s SEE
poll an alternating dorms
agreed that the brick walls
blocking idea was not what the
Student Affairs Committee had
originally intended for alter-
nating dorms.

Student response this week——
roughly ten per cent or the
student body~was double what
it was last week.

Five at the ill answering
question seven thought that the
brick wall separation did re-
tlect what was originally meant
by alternating dorms, and 110
said no, this was not what they
believed to be the original in-
tention. (It must be noted that
not all questions or those re-
turned in the 5&3 were tilled in,
and so me results may not
necessarily tally with the
total,

In student comments the
brick wall was regarded by one
as “a Puritan blockade.” by
another as “the Berlin wall,"
and by a third party—a girl—
as “not a deterrent (against
Iv's), but an interesting chal-
lenge.”

Basic agreement also existed
on questions six and three —_
whether there should be an all-
cnmpus relerendum, and
whether IV's warrant a reorgan-
ization or the dorm system.
