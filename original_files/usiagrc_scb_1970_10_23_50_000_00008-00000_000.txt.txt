Gridders Spoil Rums’
'Kill A Freak Week’

One of the fraternity houses
overlooking Cornell's football
stadium had a sign on it as
part of Cornell's Homecom-
ing decorations saying some-
thing to the effect that Grint
nell College was a Commun-
ist plot. Grinnell's gruesome
gaggle, the Ob Squad, taking
this as their leading cheer
(“Grinnell's a Commie PIA
ot"), got the twoeplusbusloads
of fans from hippiedom up for
the observance of the success
ful dissolution of Cornell’s
Homecoming festivities; by
those Marxists from Grinnell,
the football Pioneers. The fit
nal score was Pinkoes 28,
Cornell 24.

Things looked bleak early in
the game for the hairy Pion'
eers as Cornell rammed the
ball down our throats for two
quick field goals and a 6’0
lead. “Gorgeous" Gary John-
son finally got Grinnell’s of-
fense going with a Screenpass
to “Hurricane" Henry Corona
for long yardage. The boyish
quarterback then fired a bomb
to "Jimmy Jet" Pirolli for
a TD and Grinnell was on top
7-6.

After both teams failed to
move for awhile, Cornell fins
ally got a drive going and sct
ored to go back up 13-7. Late
in the first half, however,
Cornell got mlled for inter-
ference in the end zone, and
“Gorgeous" Cary tookadvarr
rage of this award to ease the
ball in by handing to Closeline
Alston for a touchdown and a
14-13 lead for the hippies.
Cornell then came right back
with what appeared to be a
scoring drive in the waning
seconds of the half, only to
have Nick “the Conserva-
tive" Russo intercept quar-
terback Steger's pass in the
endzone. “

At the start of the second
half, the hippies from Grinv
nell threatened to blow the
game apart as they scored in
their first drive on a ‘flea-
ﬂicker’ from ”6.0." to "Hu~
rricane" with ”Right: on" Ed
Hirsch at the pivot. The an-
archists made it 28-13 on an-
other bomb from Johnson to
"Jimmy Jet".

Cornell was not to be beaten
so easily, however. The Rams
came back with a touchdown
of their own and added a two-
point conversion to run the
count to 28-21. A fourth quar-
ter field goal by Cornell put
the confrontation’s outcome
in doubt at 28-24. However,
in the final moments of the
game, after letting Cornell
off the hook twice on fourth
down situations. the Big Red
Machine finally held and re-

Grinnell's jolly joggers fleXt
ed their calf muscles last
weekend by defeating Cornell
emphatically, 15-43. Stinging
from last week's 5&5 article,
the Pioneers ”skunked” the
Rams by taking the first five
individual places. To add to
the humiliation, our "hairy
ers" even had a few of our
“super-scrubs”, (alias the
"pushers", a‘ completely le-
gal group), place ahead of
their Varsity.

Coach Obermiller had been
called out oftown for theweek,
so the team worked out on their
own. Responding to the relief
of not hearing terrible jokes
and puns, the “thinnies” all
had their best personaltimes.
Each of the top five runners
finished under twentyttwo mi-
nutes, for an all-time record
performance for a Grinnell
Croschountry team. if the
team does not perform aswell
this week, Coach Ois planning
on taking a permanent vacaa
tion.

"Hair— God" Eric Jahn tame
out ahead of Charlie McGrath
in this week's entanglement.
Charlie was suffering from a
“toothietach" and will have it
taken care ofl Monday. Super
Prep Phil Frank came in th-
ird, followed by ”Oscar the
Mechanic" and Johnny ”Red
Cap" Russel.

Having helped the football
team ruin ”KILL A FREAK
WEEK", at Cornell, the boys
are headed Friday to Cedar
Rapids and the Coe Invitationt
31. Victory is in the wind, if
the team can avoid injuries.
Now in the training kit, Coach
0 carries a "toothrtoughen*
er" and has gotten rid of the
lollipops he was using to re
ward the men (7).

Soccer Stars Stumble, 7-l Here

Coming off the worst defeat
in recent history at the hands
of Beloit last Saturday, the
Grinnell soccer team will try
to put it back together tomorr
row against Knox. The game
will be played on the Tenth
Street soccer fieldat 1:30pm.
Knox beat the Pioneers at Knox
four weeks ago, 1’0. The game
was played at Knox on a small
and rough football field. Gtitr
nell's larger regulation field
may give the Pione rs the
necessary room to outmaneur
ver their bitter rivals. In last
year's game with Knox in Cr
innell, the Pioneers were vic~
torious 41.

Last week's game turned out
to be an original Grinnell dis-
aster at the hands of Beloit
College. The home fans had
something to cheer about in
the first quarter when Grin~
nell went ahead on CraigGort
don's first goal of the season.
It took a great fake (he fell
down) before Gordon could
shake loose from the Beloit
fullback and put a shot into the
far corner of the goal.

A goal can often provide a
great lift to get an offense
moving; unfortunately, it was
the Beloit offense that scored
two goals in the next fivemint
utes, not Grinnell. Beloit led
4-1 at halftime, and Grinnell
looked tired and ragged thr-
oughout most of the last half.
The final score was Belolt 7,
Grinnell 1. It was the first
Pioneer defeat at home since

I M Corner: Football

The IM football champion‘
ship has, for all intents and
purposes, been decided. The
only things remaining are
team pride and the everprer
sent lust for blood. Clarkl-lall,
with a record of 9-0, clinched
the title Sunday with its 26-18
victory over Read.

Clark eliminated Off- Campr
us 18*0 in a game publicized
as the ”Blood Bowl.” Not [0
disappoint the fans, players
dropped all over the battle-
field. After unforgettable pl-
ays, such as a phantom rush-
ing onto the field and decking
the opposing quarterback, the
game was finally called be-
cause of a headton-colllsion.
Beth teams and the various
partisan onlookers agree that
this decision was probably the
only right call of the after-

n-- .

In an earlier game, OffACa~
mpus had eliminated North in
a close 2218 contest. The
season has been marred by
unnecessary roughness, spec-
tators trying to run thegames,
numerous forfeits, and a lack
of sufficient refereelng. Two
tough games still remain. Hai-
nes challenges the Clark Crer
tins Wednesday and North ta-
kes on the secondtplace Read
Gents.

Now that the 1M footballsear
son hasabout breathed its last,
the volleyball season is about
to begin. What a season that
should be! The profs have de*
cided to try their hand at the
game. They may need more
than hands now that the "B”
league has been made coed.

So IM moves INdoors. _

Grinnell's record is now 3-2.
The Grinnell offense has sco‘
red the same number of goals
as their opponents, ten. Most
of Grinnell's scoringhas come
from the inside forward posi-
tions, where Tom Lincoln has
5 and Steve Korstad has 2.
Each of the wings, Jim Dix
and Craig Gordon, has added
one goal. Steve Hirshon, who
is currently out of action with

torn cartilage in his knee,
scored the other goalfrom his
right halfbackposition. Repla—
cing Steve is Dave Klaus, who
joins Captain Bruce Graham
and Marty Wice at halfback.
The fullbacks are John Vider
rich, Ken (JC) Labowitz, Jack
Couch, and Dave Pritchard.
Dave Coron, with help from
Dave Kaus, is handling the
goal protecting chores.

The Grinnell soccer team is aiming for twelve victor~
ies this season, as evidenced by the number on this
footman's back. Unfortunately, they forgot to schedule

that many games.

The little Pink Toy Falls

The Freshmen Footballteam
is 0.2 so far on the season.
Suffering under their inability
to score and play defense,
(play football (7)), they have
been put down by the Frosh of
Cornell and Knox Colleges.
Against Cornell in their home
opencr, the Little Red lost by
the score of 3370, a very ex»
citing game for the Cornell
fans present. Against Knox. . .
no one on the team willdivulge
the score, but it is rumored
it was over 5070, less than
1000, approximately 7670.

There are a few bright spots
on this untraditional squad,
which follows three undcfcat
ted prep football teams. Finc

efforts are coming from John

“Flower” Potts, "Badman"
George Blakeslcy, and “Fire
plug 11” Don Eognanno. The
truth is that almost half ofthe
team has neverplayetl football
in pads before, giving Coach
Pfitsch a decided handicap.
Carl Cage is also finding this
season very distressing, as
Coach Pfitsch has already Ch‘
owed-up two towels.

In spite of theirtwo “moral"
victories, the “Little Pink
Windtup Toy" will be in 30*
tion again today at Coe. And
will somebody take thatPrep-
player off the locker room
