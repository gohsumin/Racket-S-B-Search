KING PREACHES AWAKENING

By SUE MILLER

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
delivered his Sunday sermon to
a capacity audience of almost
4,000 in Darby Gymnasium.

Delayed by ﬂight trouble
en route from Chicago, King
arrived one hour past me
scheduled sermon time at
10:45.

King, ”a prophet in the twen-
tieth century“ according to
Benjamin Mays, “is one who
does not seek popular causes,
but right ones."

”Few men in our time," the

‘President Emeritus of More—-

house College slated, are “as
persuasive and as consistent
in pointing out the social injus-
tices and modern issues of our
day."

King apologized tor his com-
ing in on a “dash-in, daslwut
basis," but said he must face
ﬁve more days of jail (his 19th
jail sentence) as a result of his
action in the 1963 Birmingham
movement which brought about
the Civil Rights legislation of
1964.

Speaking or “Remaining A-
wake Through 8. Revolution,"
King compared Rip Van Winka
le's predicament to our own.

His zoycar long nap has par-
tially obscured a more import-
ant issue or the story~that or
sleeping through a revolution,
King said.

Rip Van Winkle, who passed
a picture of King George III at
England when he climbed the
mountain to sleep, King said,
came down to find that George
Washington’s picture was
there.

We are today who are finding
ourselves in a great period of so-
cial change, but who (all to de
velop a new attitude and men.
tal outlook of the social order,
The challenge today, he stated,
is to develop and maintain a
world perspective; any individ
ual .. or nation — today that
feels. he can live alone is sleep-
ing through a revolution.

“Although: we have made of
the world a neighborhood. we
have not yet developed the ethi-
cal wmmitrnent to make it n
brotherhood."

All mankind is caught up In
the “inescapable network of
mutuality." King said, “and
whatever ailects one directly,
affects all indirectly."

“Each of us lives in two
worlds, the Within and the With-
out, by which we live, gov-
em our religious and spiritual
‘within.’ We must," K i n g
concluded, “never let the means
{or which we live outdistance
the ends for which we live,”

We “must struggle passion
Ately and umelentingly to get
rid at every aspect oi racial
injustice," King continued, or
we Will bring “the current of
doom down on civilization."

MONTAGU CALLS FOR
JOHNSON'S IMPEACHMENT

Alter dubbing the Vietnam
War “the most immoral and il<
legal conflict in the history of
America," Princeton, New Jer-
sey anthropologist Ashley Mona
tagu informed a capacity
crowd in ARI-l auditorium Sun-
day that President Johnson
“ought to be impeached.“

“1968 is the moth anniversary
or the impeachment of the irrst
president Johnson," Montagu
told an estimated 550 students,
visitors, and tacuity members
at Sunday’s Vietnam Rally.

“And i suggest to you that it
would be a good idea to pro-
ceed with the publishing 0i
grounds for the impeachment
of the second President John-
Son.”

Montagu outlined eleven
points as grounds tor the im-
peachment of Johnson:

1. “Violation of U. N. Char-
ter, which says that one can
legitimately only use force
against armed attack."

2. “Violation of OAS Treaty
which says that states cannot
intervene in the affairs of other
peoples without consultation."

3. "The assumption by the
executive oi unprecedented
powers for determining policy.
. . Johnson is waging a war
without a declaration of war.”

4, “Outraging the Geneva
Conventions In the use of na-
palm, the treatment ot prison<
crs, area bombing. . ., the
heating of tunnels to 1000 de-
grees to kill Viet Cong.

5. “The outraging oi the
Hague Conventions of 1399 and
1907 which speclly the rules or
war."

6. ”The breaking Oi the Ge«

neva Agreements 0! 1954 and
1962."

7. “The complete disregard
of the principles and declara-
tions of the Nuremberg Trial.
which stated that the greatest
crime against mankind was the
waging oi an illegal war."

8. “The bombing of Cambodia
and Laos."

9. “Presence of our troops in
Bolivia."

m “The use of power promis-
cuously."

ll. "Malversation in a posi.
tion or trust."

Montagu concluded his shot!
address pointing to “the harm
this one man has done."

Montagu also gave a lecture
in Darby gym Saturday on
“Race, Science, and Humani-
ty." “Until we can regress the
wrongs we've done in educa.
tion and sociological prob-
lems," Montagu iniormed, “we
won't serve the race problem,
the human problem."

Also a keynote speaker at
the rally, sponsored by tho
Grinuell Student Movement
and its Vietnam Committee,
was Yale drama protessor and
critic Richard Gllman.

“You are a generation with
a social Consciousness, and that
is rare.” Gilman told tho
crowd. “I hope you don’t lose
it.”

Montagu and Gilmnn were in-
Lroduoed by Chairman of the
Faculty Joseph Wall. SGA
President Ric MacDowell also
addressed the rally.

Professor Ezra Mendelsohn
(history) told the rally crowd
that the peace rally was “like
it tootball rally."

“My friends already agree
with me, and my enemies won’t
be persuaded here," be ‘con.

. eluded.

The Sunday- atternoon meet-‘
ing was presided over by Viet-
nam Committee’s Ron Miller.

Over five hundred students
signed the GSM’s anti-war po-
tition, according to Miller.

Montagu, Gilmali, and about
40 iaculty members signed,
stating that the war was "rm.
moral in its useless destruction
oi human lives. . ."

The last signature on the pe-
tition, a GSM representative
told the rally, “is Martin Luth-
er King Jr."

The rally was origin-any
scheduled to be held on Barber
Plaza 12:30 - 1:30 Sunday. In<
clement weather and the late
arrival of Dr. King forced the
GSM to move it to ARE tol-
lawlng the special chapel serv-
ice in Darby Gym.
