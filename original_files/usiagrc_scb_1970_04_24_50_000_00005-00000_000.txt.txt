government just doesn’t tell us
anything.”

These statements are not
unusual or enlightening in
themselves, unless they are
remarkable in coniorming so
exactly to the stereotype of rural
people‘s, but the sincerity,
honesty, and deep feeling with
which the statements were made
unusual. By the end oi the
evening, alter several hours of
talking about everything from
war to religion to drugs, people oi
Mitchellville were convinced of
one thing at least: despite the
clothes the marchers were and
the length oi their hair, they were
“regular folks” 7' and they were
not going to tear down the
church.

A day later the iiiteen arrived
in Des Moines and added their
voices to a large demonstration
in front of Veterans’ Memorial
Auditorium. Many members of
the group ielt that the chanting
and the posters at the demon-
stration made it a success,
serving to ont some people out of
their apathetic or complacent
attitudes, while others felt the
noise had anmgonized people
more can it had opened their
minds. The marchers agreed,

however, that their conversations :

with, thepeople oi Mitchellville
had been extremely worthwhile,
and that such dialogue is
probably more valuable than
even the biggest demonstration.
