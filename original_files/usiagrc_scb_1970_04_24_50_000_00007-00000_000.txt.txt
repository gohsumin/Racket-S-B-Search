by approving the
new RE. complex and by
building the academic sched-
me around the spring meets,
it is clear that here is the one
“non-negotiable" demand made
by the administration and the
iaculty. Any attempt by the
advocates of “pupil power".
who have obviously subverted
the sports editor or the 5&3,
to undermine this unalterable
commitment to P.E. will be
regarded by both the adminis-
tration and the faculty as a
“breach of faith". This is not
(to quote Andy Loewx) “a
threat”. Harassment of minor
lties like those of the admin
istration and the faculty will
lead to a solidarity and a
united front which the pupils
have just cause to tear. I need
only point to the uninterrupted
prowess of the faculty as mani-
tested in its athletic victories
over pupil teams in all manner
of good sports.

“War," said Thomas Aqu-
inas. “is the moral equivalent
