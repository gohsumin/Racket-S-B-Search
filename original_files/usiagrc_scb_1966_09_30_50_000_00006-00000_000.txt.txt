student deans and hail advisers,
two new faculty members will
serve in a guidance capacity.
50th College Chaplain Dennis
W. Haas, who replaces Mr. Rog-
er Eldridge, and Coach Ray-
mond J. Oberrniller have had
previous experience advising
students about personal prob-
lems. Both are available each
day for several hours or com
lultation in Steiner Hall.

Haas gained guidance expe-
rience last year as Chaplain at
Franklin Marshall College in
Pennsylvania, and during his
six years as a church minister,
when he was called upon to orn-
ploy his ministerial resources in

roblems of “great diversity.”
item at Grinnell, in addition to
his chapel and advisory duties,
he will teach and work with the
Board of Religion,

Coach Obermiller was former-
ly employed at a high school in

Sioux City. He supervised four
counselors in a guidance, test-
ing and advisory program
there, in addition to his coach-
ing duties. His official position
at Grinnell is that of track and
swimming coach, but his morn-
ings are to be free {or advis-
ing students. Mr. Obermiller
has completed some postgradu-
ate work in counseling. along
with his physical education

A Senate Committee on coun~
seling began to function last
spring. There was not suiilcient
time to meet for more than
four sessions, but the commie
tee was able to set up a public
hearing for student, taculty and
administration in e m b e r s to
voice opinions on the counseling
situation.

The inadequacy of the Newton
arran ement and the desirabil-
lty o having a professional
witllln easier access were re-
lated issues raised. Students ex-
pressed the dlsire to be able
to consult an adult who would
represent less at an authority

Former Chaplain Eldridge
catagorized other student prob»
lems as social, ethical and mor-
al. He stated his opinion that
Gl‘innell has more diiiicnlty in
meeting student need in this
area than in dealing wuh the
less common acute emotional

disturbances. Both Eldridge and
Winters expressed concern for
the student who largely avoids
much social contact during his
stay at Grinnell.

Winters stated that some stu<
dents come to Grinnell “as
naive 17-year-olds and leave
without ever having batted
brains together." The Dean sug-
gested the establishment or a
continuing committee on cam~
pus to deal with improvements
in Grinnell environment.

Eldridge suggests an increase
in small group activity to pro«
Vide better opportunities to: ex—
change between both male and
female students and between
students and faculty. He stated
his belief that the College should
take "a more aggressive role"
in encouraging such activity.
Eldridge and Winters both ia-
Vcred the idea of the hiring of
an activities counselor.

The Senate Counseling Com-
mittee is continuing its work
this year. Last year's chair-
man, i-iank Ballkov, says the
committee will concentrate on
a study or the possibilities or
professional psychiatric help on
campus. From correspondence
with psychologists and counsel-
ors at other colleges, commit-
tee members hope in “get a
competent proicssional opinion
on adequate counseling facili-
ties tor this college,"

brought home with brutal force
to Saga workers last Septem-
ber 21. That morning, at about
3:30, a rat made its appearance
in the kitchen of the Quad
dining hall.

Things were proceeding nor-
mally that morning, when the
Saga employes were startled by
the cooks cries, A black furry
creature was seen scampering
across the floor. “It looked like
a rat,” one oi those present
told this reporter,

The rat scampered around
the kitchen for about five min<

attempts by the busboys to
trap it or step on it proved
unsuccessful, As we go to
press, the rat is reported still
at large.
