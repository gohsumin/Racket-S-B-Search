The strikcbreakers and the
maids worked until 4 pm
cleaning the residue.

The strike leaders decided
that to encourage further action
along these lines would be in
jurious to their cause, and so
at dinner that night they spoke
to the students in the meal line,
asking them to “take as much
food as you can tit on a tray,
use as many dishes as possible,
and stay as long as you can,”
thus taking the destructive hint
from their urgings.

Asking the students to stay
late held up the clearing of
tables because they are usual-
ly not cleared until the diners
have leit, By the time doors to
the Quad were closed, tables
were covered with stacks of
dirty dishes and surrounded by
students singing. playing cards,
and conversing. The atmos-
pliere was lighthearted and jo-
vial except for some quiet but
angry disputes between strikers
and strike-breakers and the
strike songs led by groups or
students,

Education Dep’l.
Starts Magazine

Mrl Dennis K, Murphy or the
Education Department is the
editor and publisher of the re<
cently initiated Midwest Edu-

cation Review, a quarterly
journal whose purpose is to en-
courage oetter teaching and
teachers in the college and sec-
nndai‘yrschool levels in the Mid-
west, .

The scholarly journal was
initiated in January 1963 as a
result of a workshop held here
for professors of the Education
Department and secondary-
school teachers in the area. Be-
cause of the SUCCESS Of thls
conference, and because there
is no journal on education pub-
lished within the ACM, Mr.
Murphy started compiling ar-
ticles for a review of current
educational ideas. The first is-
sue of the Review appeared
this week.

Although the distribution and
contributions to the journal are
nationwide, Mr. Murphy stated
that it will especially appeal to
Midwestern college and secon-
daryeschool educators

The result of these discus-
sions is a basic recommendation
that as many as three students
be placed on each of the com-
mitlees.

The proposal will come up for
a Vote oi the entire faculty soon,
either separately or in conjunc-

dents on the EPCSr

Mr. Alan Jones, head of the
committee of Faculty 0rgani~
Zatlons, has Said, “This would
be a major change toward stu-
dent participation in important
areas or college decision mak-
ing."

There have been no major
proolenis encountered by this
proposall it is hoped that the
students will be able to particl-
pale on tullrscale basis and
maybe “breathe some new lilo
into some of the committees"
Mr. Jones reported.

more communication and un.
derstanding.

"The New Land", the hrs!
lecture, dealt with the probleml
of students and of [he univelﬁ
sity, defined as “the whole insti<
tution of higher learning in all
its forms." Dr, Napier said that
the university, which should be
the leader in helping the indivi-
dual, the nation, and the world
“to ﬁnd himself” or itself, was
moving in “perilously slow mo-
tion” in overcoming [lie “dehu‘
manization" and “powerlessr
tiess" of students.

Speaking at student revolt.
Napier encouraged the protest,
calling student indignation at
America's immoraiity “hope
tul", At the same time, be en-
couraged restraint among young
people.

In his second lecture, “The
New People”, Drr Napier listed
the problems lacing America
and three things that he thought
we must do to begin to solve
them. Some problems named
were the tremendous differences
“between black and white, be.
tween the poor and the comforts
able, and between developing
and advanced nations”. The p05«
siblllty 0t selfrdestructmn by
nuclear weapons, the political
triction in the world, the popula<
tion explosion, air pollution,
chaotic cities, and attitudes of
“conformity and apathy, smug-
ness and hypocrisy" were also
named as problems lacing us.

Napier called for “a return
to sympathy”, more “lunctlon
of perception", and more “cor-
porate celebration or changes
in the lives of individuals and of
nations.”

Dr. Napier's final lecture, “A
New Language", explored “the
need of man in a fractured
world to find new ways of com-
municating and understanding".
He said that, in order to create
this “more humane world", the
people “are called to the now
absolutely critical leadership or
new creation, and we must be
about the business or creating a
whole new people and a whole
new language"
