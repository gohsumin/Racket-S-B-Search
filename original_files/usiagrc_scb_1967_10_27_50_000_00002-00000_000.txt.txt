TiiE PAPER AND THE Follllhf

The staff of The Paper, the unofficial student newspaper of
Grinnell College, has been denied permission to distribute Copies
of the October 26 issue in the College Forum.

There are several arguments for barring The Paper from the
registration area in the Forum ~ We find them all absurd.

The primary objection is lack of space, voiced by Mrs. Hawk
and Miss Mary Jones (the Alumni Secretary, who is responsible
for the registration operations). The Soil editor offered to share
his table with The Paper. Permission to do this was denied by
Miss Jones.

The content of The Paper was the next objection. It is obvious—
ly not lit for human consumption, according to the administration
people involved. Mrsi Hawk was reported to the 5&8 as having
said: “I haven’t read it, but I’ve heard about it.” Mr. Hess (pulp
llcity director) said that he’d seen the first issue. The big thing
on Mr. Hess’ mind was the cartoon on the last page.

And, explained Mn Hess and Mr. Avison (development direc-
tor), when Miss Jones referred the 5&3 editor to them for a final
decision, the college has no control over the editor of The Paper.

Let us consider parallel situations ll the editor of the 5&3
displeases the college sufficiently, he can be lired by the Commit-
tee on Student Publications and lose his salary. The present editor
could take the monetary loss easily If, however, the editor of The
Paper displeases the college sufficiently, the only recourse is to
throw him out of school This means a one-way ticket to one of
ﬁcneral Hershey’s “summer schools.”

It seems, then, that the 5&3 editor actually has less at stake
than the editor of The Paper, and thus the college has less control
over him.

There is also the absurdity of this decision regarding freedom
of expression being made by the Alumni Secretary, and ultimately,
the directors of publicity and development. That such a decision
was not effected by the Deans of the college, or by the faculty, is
my amazing.

But the decision has been made.

The 5&1! urges all visitors to the campus who consider them-
Ielves friends of Grinnell to find a copy of The Paper and read it.

You may not like it. You may not even be impressed But a
group of students have taken the time to organize and publish
their ideas, and as people interested in the college, you should
lead it as soon as you would read the 5&3.

If you don’t find a representative of The Paper walking on
campus, drop down to the Sim office in the north end of the For-
um Basementi We‘ll have some copies for you,

TOWN AND COLLEGE

The administration, spurred by complaints from students, is at
last beginning to take steps to curb anti-college and anti-Negro oc-
llvities in town.

President Leggett and Dean Winters are planning to meet
with the local church council and with “Frosty” Mitchell (KGRN)
Ind Al Finder (Herald-Register) to discuss the problem

The S“? wishes to thank the administration for its efforts, but
feels they are in vain, Racial and social prejudice have shown
themselves time and again to be too deeply intrenched to be
reached by the pulpit or by mass media. Such efforts often serve
to further antagonize the antagonizes.

The only way to meet the problem of college student —townie
lelations is head on — with a direct confrontation between the two
groups.

The confrontation may take two fonnsl It may be violent, with
ouch side retaliating for alleged insults received Or it may be
peaceful, with people from both sides meeting to try to understand
oach other and work out a solution

Peace through understanding is difficult, if not impossible,
when dealing with large groups of people. But with a small college
and a small town, it may work. And it must.

The 5&3 would like to see a commission composed of college
ltudents and young townspeople, with college administrators and
parents as observers (not supervisors), established to examine the
problem and propose solutions.

The young people on each side are the one: who stand to gain
or lose, and their direct involvement is the only way to resolution.

NOTES FROM THE
GIRGULAR FILE

The sun would like to apologize for an error in last week's
paper. Quoting the anti-war petition, we referred to the war as
"immoral and a useless destruction of human lives.“ It should
have been “immoral in its useless destruction of human lives.” \

The distinction is subtle, but important. If the story had re-
mained on Campus, we might have overlooked it.

But the information Service, without consulting the editor of
the 58:3, Neil Fischer (the author of the story), 01‘ Ron Miller
:(GSM member who was interviewed), turned the story into a news
release and sent it to the four corners of the earth.

if we’re writing for siicll a large audience, we’d like to get paid
tor it Or at least get a credit. And we’ll get; very careful on our
quotes.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

niiiiilliiiiiiliiiiillitiiilllltiiiilliiiililiiiiiIIiiiiilliiiiiliiiiiilliiiiilliil

I’m not a person who suilics
after the melliiluous praises of
professors. For most of my
years at Grinnell my scholar“
ship has reaped no soft or hou-
eyed phrases; and I don‘t care,
I don't care,

The petty rewards vouch-
safed by the pedant class ~
those insipid certificates, those
maritricious laurels, holds out
no real glory for my desires for
recognition

Miss Wormkee, my third
grade teacher, never puts a
silver star next to my name —
and i don’t care, I don’t care.
Arthur, my six year old broth-
er, laughs at me and kicks me
when i come home from Suhool
because I never receive even
the slightest acknowledgment.
But understand, I don’t care, I
don't care.

What are all these things
next to that quintescenco of
awards -— that necklace of
precious metal and solid wis-
dom. I am privately aware that
in my own scholarship, l have
stood at the head of my guild
during these past few years at
Grinnell. So it has been an an-
nual pain to me to see Grinnell
confer on aggregate of awards
and scholarships upon persons
of small and temporary conse-
quence — persons of local and
evanescent notoriety, persons
who drift into obscurity and are
forgotten inside of ten years —
and never a medallion offered
to me!

What is mere to work for —
nay, to live for if not the Pres‘
ldent’s medallion? And yet, I
would have as unflinchingly
taken the matching earrings
and bracelet as I emancipated
the medallion.

So as not to be dealt that last
blow of ineffable disappointment
when it would be given away
to some charlitnn, some bogus
student, 1 procurred it myself]

Arthur won’t laugh at me
anymore. Miss Wormkce will
really be sorry. And after I
show it to the representative
from Dow Chemical he will
really be impressedl

The possession of this neck<
lace consummates the Grinnell
upenenw.

Sincerely,
(nuns withheld)

Attention kiddies! (also parents, administrators, trustees, and
faculty members)

i have finally resolved Grinnell’s greatest paradox, omnipres.
ent wherever people talk about or attempt to analyze this school
— viz., Why the hell do people who have never lived in conserva.
tive Gril'iliell think that this is a liberal school?

Or, more specifically, why or how are liberal, radical (and
therefore interesting) students deluded into coming here . . .
even alter many have visited as prospectives? 1

Because, to the visitor, Grlnnell College must look like a l
perpetual “sit-in.”

Every time you turn around at Grinnell — especially around
Convocation when visitors abound -— you see students sitting
around.

What are they protesting?

Nothing. They are waiting in line for meals. They am!
waiting in line for tickets. They are Waiting in line for regis.
tration. some are just waiting in line to be waiting in line.

Students and faculty members began waiting in lino for Verdi
Requiem tickets at the Forum desk at 1 pm. Tuesday.

The tickets weren’t distributed until 7 pm.

The Requiem line impeded student traffic and Saga and For.
urn administrators' errands (May bands of angels sing them on
their flights!) everywhere from the North Lounge doors to tho
South Lounge music room.

The South Lounge was ﬁlled with ticket—seekers from 4- 3 pan.
Tuesday, piecluding study or TV or anything else. The wholo
thing had the same effect as a “shin"; all normal activity we.
prevented.

By 5:30 pm people In line were ordering pizzas. '

Drawing on Convocan’on, I’d like to make a point about linesti

Sometimes lines have their place . . . like in geometry . . a
maybe . . . and I’m hardly suggesting that we abolish them an,
resort to total anarchy, and all make for the Cowles door at lino.
for late dinner,

But at Grinnell hues are like Chicken Man — “They’re everyu
where; they're everywherel” ,
And they're getting longer. And they’re getting ridiculous.

Students who got up at 5:30 am. Registration morning to get
a place in the front of the line were surprised to find ADO people
already ahead of them. Some pitched tents in front of Darby,
Gym.

1 hope to heaven that these campers didn’t get any of the
courses they wanted.

1 got to Roberts Theatre at 7:30 pm. for the Mime Troupe
lhow scheduled for a pm.

Already three-quarters of the seats were taken — not by,
bodies, but with words.

About every fifth seat in Roberts had an uvaut—ganle automa-
ton sitting in it. About every twenty seconds the automaton me.
chanlcally mouthed: ,

“I‘m sorry, but I'm raving (hm twelve seats for in] t
friends." ‘

The friends, I assume, were home relaxing. showering, enf-
lng, and would eventually arrive in their own sweet time to claim
“their" seats.

Well i have a little announcement to make to those people
— from now on, as far as I'm oonoemed, any seat that doesn’t
have a warm body in it is my seat . . . no matter who’s saving it.

And this week, you even have oonstructive suggestions from
my roommate (they’re not from me, again, because i don’t mk-
nuggestions — I just point out lines): computerize registration no-
oording to student preference, abolish specified hours for meals,
and rule out the saving of seats at events. That's 81L

If you do that, I suppose, we might stop looking like profu-
Iional peace demonstrators and we will stop putting in a per-
petual masquerade.
