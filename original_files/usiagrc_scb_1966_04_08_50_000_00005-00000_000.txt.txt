Tomorrow night at s p.m., 74
dancers will whirl on stage in the
colorful pageantry or Grinnelrs
second annual Folkdance Concert.

avllali program with dances as dl~
verse as the 14 countries they rep-
resent, Tempo and mood ra nge

gay German polka, Settenherger.
The graceiul, controlled Yovarlo
Yovanka a Macedonian dance rep-
resents in mood and style another
group or the world’s people. Be-
cause oi its torm, Yovano has
earned the folkdancers' pet name,
“the harem one." Displaying pro
per social distance between the

from the stately, imperial, Rus- { sexes, the dance IS done in a line
Stan waltz, Alexandrovslta, to theiletl by the men and followed by a

 

 

 

 

longer line oi women connected
via the last man's handkerchief.

The concert will open with an
Israeli medley of 14 daitces,the
first of which will be Ken Yovdu.
Literally, Ken Yovdu means “thus
they will perish.” The lolkdance
leader and teacher, Mrs. Pierko
Roecker. explains that ”the ‘thus
will they perish' refers to the ene-
mies of Israel.” She describes it
as a “militant, defiant dance.“
Ken andu will be [allowed by Nad
llan, a calmer Women’s dance
done in the familiar Israeli Circle
form.

Other highlights or the perfor-
mance includes Hasapikos, a
men’s dance from Pyrea which is
very similar to the Cretan danc—
ing recently poputarized tn Zorba

vakian national dance, is a com-
bination oi eight different dances
from dillerent parts of the coun-
try,

One or the most interesting tolk
histories behind a dance is the
derivation of Constant Billy. This
is one or a group oi ancient Eng-
lish men's fertility dances known
as Morris dances (from the word
Moorish). Every village had its
Morris men, which was a respect-
ed hereditary position, Each
spring. the Morris men performed
their dances and ritual on the
green, with sticks and bells, and
sometimes parts for a tool. a
horse, and a woman (always
played by a man). ,

bara Siebenschub, and John Wiles.
