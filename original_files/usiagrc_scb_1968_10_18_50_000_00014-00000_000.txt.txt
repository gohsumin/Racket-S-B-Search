Odette de Lecluse: Franco
America's Chef d’Oeuvre

By ODETTE DE LECLUSE

When anyone travels thmugh France and stops in a small town
or Village for a meal, the usual reaction oi the traveler is a double
one: delight and surprise The tirst is an enjoyable reeling, the
second is an amazed awareness when the tourist compares the
iood to the dreadiul fare dispensed by the places which advertise
themselves as cafes, snack bars, sip 9L bite, and sometimes just
EATS! The last term is appropriate as tar as the actual motion of
putting load in one’x stomach is concerned, although indigestion
hllnws in due time.

Regional cooking in France has always been a source of
pride to the natives We have it in this country but choose tha
easy way out, catering to the tastes of people l shall call “finger-
eateis." Even the rolls and buns sheltering dry hamburgers or
dull hot dogs are soft and soggy, and Just as tasteless ~ they need
wmething strong and pungent to camouﬂage the whole concoction
Ind enable the customer to swallow it along with large gulps of
Iome kind of sweet fizzy liquid oiten called “soda," about as use-
tul as the less tasty powder iorm. This is alien accompanied by
thick mealy “french fries,” which are neither French nor fried,
but strips ot raw potatoes steamed in grease. To top it oh then
is a piece of pie with an anemic undercooked crust at the bottom
or made soggy by starchy ice cream, and vollai

I always take this suspicious, even cynical, approach to the
hot meal offered by these places when it includes a piece of meat
under it piece or solt bread drowning under a starchy gravy along
with potatoes tasting somewhat like wet paper with more or the
lame gravy.

Yet these same places do have rather good Sandwiches land
crisp salads, perhaps because the cooking has been done before by
people who know their job and the vegetables have been lett alone,
One can always reiuse the special "gourmet fancy” dressings that
might ruin the salads.

It is a iact that the steam tables are partly responsible for a
great deal of this tasteless food. Also responsible is the state of
hurry prevalent in the 20th century. One does not want in wait or
uannot wait an hour or more to have something prepared, but there
are quick orders such as omlets, scrambled eggs, liver and kid
neys, and lean cuts oi nieat, all for people who shun waiting.
There are wonderiul soups, stews, and many vegetables which
become even better with the waiting,

Good desserts need not be complicated but can vary (mm the

aigns, and the same basic ice cream With fancy names and follow.
ing the same pattern.

Good food should really lit the adjective and does not requlrn
l diploma or an extraordinary talent if one is provided with th-
right ingredients and is willing to take a little care.

Eye appeal should not be the loremost achievement, and when
someone exclaims,about the lovely picture a dish makes 1 am
tomewhat leery of discovering what is under the lovely decor.

And now, to coin the old adage: “The prooi is in the pudding,"
I am including some recipes to prove my point as fat as soups url
concerned.

Politics Fashions Grinnell Styles
If It Suits The Individual Taste

By BARBARA WEiTZ

Despite the fact that Grlnneil
is not overwhelmed with a vari-
ety oi publications, or other
media, which stress the ﬂuctu—
aliens and hits 0! the fashion
world, we cannot be completely
oblivious oi the trends in taste
that emanate from centers of
this higher art. Although the
topic is not iashionable, it is
still interesting to reflect on
the fashion cycles of Grinnell.
in an attempt to understand
what the Grinnell fashion or
nonriashicn is.

but im their individual ability
to somehow silt through the en-
tire world of fashion, to disre-

AEROBICS: TOOTHBRUSH OF THE BODY

By JEAN KING

(Women’l Physical
Education Department)

Few Grinnell coeds get out
and exercise hard enough and
otten enough to be physically
ht. vigorous physical exercise
is needed by everyone —"mutor
moron" or “jock". The most
important parts of the body to
keep in top shape are the heart
and lungs, l.e., the circulatory
and respiratory systems. Aero-
bic exercises—those that talc
the heart and lungs—are a
must.

Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, auth-
or oi Aerobics, says;

The American woman il
less interested in her health

than in her looks. She wnn't
spend in minutes on a track,
but she'll spend four hours in
a beauty parlorr . ,if they'd
do the things they should do
to benefit their essential
health, they'd beneﬁt their
looks as well, especially their
figures, and more especially
their dispositions.

Exercise must be done icgu.
iarly; daily is best, but at least
three times a week. There are

no vacations—no one considers
vacationing from tooth biushing
—neither does one “vacatiml”
from regular exercise. Dr. Coop
Ir writes:

. r , even ii it is unladylike,
and it isn't, i can still recom<
mend running as the best and
quickest way to work up a
worthwhile sweat . , . swim-
ming is second best and delin-
iteiy iadylike .cycling is
beneficial . . . Rope skipping
and running in place are also
good and can be done at home
. . . There are many other
activities such as golf, tennis.
skating and skiing where you
can euslly exercise your heart
and lungs and have run,

Every one at us at Grin-
nell should:

i. Exercisevrun, hike, cycle,
swim, run in place, etc.

As You Sew, So
Shall You Guiher

By NAN LOWER

There is no ad more insulting
than the one in Which 3 Holly-
wood starlet appears stating.
obnoxiously, the tamiliar
phrase, “It i can sew, you can
sew."

Sewmg is not an adventure
that guarantees a masterpiece
in two hours. it takes time and
patience. Yet even the greatest
eifort cannot succeed unless
one begins with two tunda
mentals: a proper iitting pat
tern and a fabric suitable to the
design.

Today, pattern books can-
sist of two systems of sizing.
The older patterns are those
simply geared to measure-
ments. A general rule for a
girl to iind her size here is to
take one size larger than her
ready-made garment size. This
newer alternative, called “New
Sizing," is the product ol the
industry's awakening to the
problems created by their old
system. This sizing now cop
responds to the manulacturer's
sizes. For example, it one
wears a size 10 in ready-mades,
her old pattern size would be 12
and her new size would be ID.

Simply taking one': measure-
ments and comparing them to
the chart at the back or a pat.
tern book is not enough for a
well-titted creation. Hardly any-
one is a perfect size. Since pat-
terns usually are cut slightly
on the large size, some prob<
items are alleviated. if you an
more than one inch larger, sim-
ply divide the umount by four
and add to the (mm and back
side seams. it is important to
chose to nne's manufactured
size for proper {it of the shoul-
tiers.

whether you be short or long
waisted, lilies are marked on
the pattern pieces to guide one
in adjusting the waist. This is
an important step which too
many forget.

To aid in the selection of
fabric, one can consult the back
of any pattern for a list of
suitable iabric types. General-
ly stated also are those fabric!
which professional cutters hava
found not suitable to the de-
lign. For example, the list
might include plaids or stripes.

Often the choice of proper
patwri'i and fabric, the main
problems or sewing are solved.
Directions in the pattern are
enough to help one begin mak-
ing a well made garment.

On Women:

That's the nature of women
. i . not to love when we love
them, and to love when we
love them not.

Cervantes, Don QuLwio
d-bri-rl—bri-M-

l have said that the religion
preached by Jesus, now totally
extinct in this world, was high
Iy favorable to women. This
was not saying, of course, that
women have returned the com-
pliment by adopting it.
