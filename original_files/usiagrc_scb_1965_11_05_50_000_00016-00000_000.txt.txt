loit and Lawrence in the con-
erence \vith a 472 record. Jelf

produced the ﬁnal score of the
game,

But against Lawrence the Pio-
neers got their oifense back in gear
and ground out 338 yards. Leading
rushers in the game were Bob
Watt and Dick Lamb with 84 and
59 yards respectively.

Also in this game Barry Ander-
son set three Pioneer career pass-
ing records. His 245 attempts, 121
completions and 1223 yards all
eclipsed the old standards.

The Pioneers started out at
Lawrence like they were going to
have another bad afternoon. The
first two times they got the ball
they fumbled once and had a pass
intercepted the other time. The
first time the Pioneer defense held,
but on the interception the Viking
back gave the defense no chance
as he went 58 yards to score.

Pioneers Roll

The third time they got the ball
though the Pioneers got their of-
fense rolling. Relyingl-leavily on
the running of Lamb and John
Shierholz, the Pioneers drove 73
yards for a touchdown. But an in-
complete pass after a fake place-
ment on the extra point left the
Pioneers down 7-6. But they quick-
ly drove in for another score. Tom
Lannom recovered a fumble on the
Lawrence 37 to set up the drive.
The score came by Watt’s loyard
scamper.

The Vikings came back and
scored on a 54-yard pass, that was
barely missed by the pioneer de-
fender. Then after they picked off
an errant pass, the Vikings scored
a field goal to take a 16-12 half-
time lead.

Wlnning Score

After a scoreless third quarter,
the Frantz—Anderson combination
got together on a ten yard pass for
the Winning score. The defense
th e it stopped three Lawrence
thrusts, The first one was stopped
when Lawrence missed a field
goal from the 35, The second was
halted by an interception, and the
third was checked on downs.

The Pioneers will end ﬁre season
with two home games — Coe and
Carleton. Tomorrow the Kohawks
will invade Grilmell fresh from two
consecutive wins over Cornell and
Knox. Coe was also victorious over
the Pioneers last year 21-15.

By Trouncing Lawrence. 19-42

Tomorrow the varsity cross
country team will have its “mo-
ment of truth" at the conference
meet in Chicago. This is the end
towards which the team has been
working for the past ten weeks.

In preparation for tomorrow's
contest the varsity trounced Law-
rence at Appleton, Wisconsin, by
a score of 19742. Jeri Langham,
who has developed into one of
the top runners in the conference,
captured first place for the har-
riers. In doing so he set the four
mile course record with a time
Of 21:43, Steve Brintnall was the
next Pioneer to cross the finish
line, placing third in 22:23. Bob
Grant, John Sharpe, and Doug
Dray, in the fourth through sixth
spots, trailed Brintnall by 16, 17,
and 23 seconds respectively. Bob
Dyer and Ric MacDowell rounded
out the squad in eighth and ninth

places respectively, with times of
13:08 and 23:25.

The freshman team closed their
season by dropping a duel meet
to State College of Iowa by a
score of 1345. Mike Hanson led
the Grinnell runners, placing
third with a time of 16:10. Bob
Coon was the next ﬁnisher for the
Pioneers, in eighth place with a
clocking of 18:22. Steve Montgom-
ery, Alan Hanawalt, and Preston
Gilson finished in the tenth, elev-
enth, and twelfth spots respective-
ly.

Carlton has to be considered
Grinnell’s strongest opponent in
the conference meet. They have
five runners who have run im-
pressive times, all having broken
22 minutes for four miles, Carl~
son of Monmouth is favored to
capture the individual competi-
tion.

 

Dibble Gives Up No Poinl'sr_
Takes IM Football Crown.

By ELLIOTT HIBBS

It was back on November 16,
1957, that Bud Wilkinson’s Okla-
homa Sooner: entertained the
“fighting irish" of Notre name
at Norman, Oklahoma. The 0k-
lahomans were riding a record
streak of 47 consecutive triumphs,
Notre Dame, on the other hand.
was rebounding from its worst
season in history. Moreover, 0k-
lahoma had not been shut—out in
123 straight contests. The “fight-
ing lrishmen," noted for their
ability to win big games, rose to
the occasion and fashioned a tough
7-0 win over the Sooners, and re-
bounded to a 7-3 record and back
into football's elite.

Clark Hall was never quite as
powerful as the Sooners, but they
threatened to establish a streak of
unbeaten games which was close
to Wilkinson’s fabulous record,
They had gone through three sea<
sons Without a defeat, a couple
of ties the only mars on their rec-
0rd. But, as 1965 rUIIEd around,
Mike Stuart (the Bud Wilkinson of
Clark Hall) found himself with an
untried crop of rookies with very
few veterans. They began the sea-
son by dumping South, is con-
tender in pre-Season talk, 13c,
Then their luck ran out as Gates
and Cowles each won close games.

Oklahoma went on to post a
9-1 record in 1957, but Clark real-
ly fell posting a lowly 451 record
which tied for eighth in the final
standings. With the rest of the
league looking tougher, it looks as
If Clark might see a lot of the
lower half of the TM ,iootball
standings.

In case you didn't hear, nibble
won the season quite handily scor-

 

 

ing 152 points and allowing none.
Dibble might have some thoughts
about starting a streak, but its
losing a few of its big boys and
a few halls will be wanting a
crack at them next year. It's my
guess they won't be undefeated
and unscored on next year,

Langan proved to be the most
futile team in the league, scoring
two touchdowns for 12 points and
giving up a whopping 280 points.
Their defense might have been
worse, but they managed to hold
Cowles to a 141 forfeit by not
showing up, It's my guess they
will be shooting to top that 280
next year,
