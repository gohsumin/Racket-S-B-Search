by Dave Buck

Three walks and two singles
alter two were out in the eighth
inning spelled defeat Tuesday
for the Griniiell baseball team
against Simpson College of Inr
dionola. 10—9.

Grinnell iuniped to an early
270 lead in the first inning on

a single and two stolen bases by‘

Jack Frcter and a double by
Dale Furnish, but Simpson
came book to knot it up at 2-2
in the top of the second inning

Both teams scored one run in
the third and Simpson added
one each in the fourth and filth
innings to go ahead 573. The
Pioneers then rallied ior two
runs in the sixth inning with
the main blow being a double
by Chris Sprung and three
walks.

Crinnell made a valiant ef—
sort to tie things up again
aiter the disasterous five-run
eighth with four runs of their
own, but they tell short when
a Grinnell batter struek out
with the bases jammed.

to the game Grinuell had only
_9 hits in three games.

Another bright spot in the
Grinnell effort was the cons
tinueot fine base running of
soph Freter and company. Free
.ter now has six stolen bases to
his credit in six tries, and he
is,just one shy of the Grinnell
record set in 1957 by Dick
Bollannon. Knamiller also got

two stolen bases and Jim Low- '

ry one.
