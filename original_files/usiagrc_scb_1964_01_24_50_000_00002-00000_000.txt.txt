In Our Opinion . . .

l With the inauguration of any new administration
some statement of policy is always in order. In the
case of the campus newspaper it seems especially ap-
propriate because of the prevalent conception that the
Scarlet and Black has no policy or that its policy as
such isn’t worth much.

Shortly after the election of a new editor it be-
came apparent that some students feared the editorial
licy would be pro-administration ~— a policy which
hey stated, would violate the concept of a “student
press.” Their reasoning demanded that a student se—
ected by students put out a newspaper representing
the students .

, Although such a policy seems logical on the sur—
face, the flaw, on this campus, exists in the idea that
such a ”student” paper must be violently opposed to
anything the administration does or says, because this
represents the “student” stand.

While supposed supporters of the “student” stand
make their position known by individual noises in their
respective offices on campus, the majority of students,
who are simply interested in having a good, informa-
tive, and entertaining newspaper, stand by and shake
their heads.

Ever since it was announced that a new editor
wouldassume the top position on the S and B masthead
for 1964, one of the hotly discussed issues on campus
concerned whether the paper would be pro»administra-
tion or pro—students, or in other words, would the Week-
1y rag be a scandal sheet or a house organ?

Does it seem impossible, in light of this debate, to
introduce a policy whereby the S&B would be a news-
paper with news in the reported columns, side~choosing
In the opinion columns, and a general, overall practice
of representing each group and individual related to the
college? This, we feel, is the news function of a good
college newspaper, This will be the foundation of edi~
torial policy for the 5&8 during 1964.

We will attempt to do an objective job of covering
“all" the news. The individual columns and the “letters
to the editor" department will be the campus forum
for opinion, discussion and debate. The editorial col-
umn will present the editorial voice and opinions of
the S&B on those issues we feel have particular signi-
ﬁcance for the Grinnell College community.

He can triumph in his failure:

who have been outstanding in
their respective fields over the
past year. Some of these
awards receive great publicity
such as the Nobel and Pulitzer
Prizes.

There are also awards which
receive little publicity such as
the award by the National
P i c kl a Foundation which
awards a year’s supply oi
pickles to the indiVIdual who
managed to get out or the big-
gest pickle of the year.

In this latter category of
awards are those given by the

dation founded by Abner Sul‘d

FROM TIME MAGAZINE

If the most popular of the lib.
eral arts is the art of snowing
the grader on exams, how
should the grader respond?
During December 'this question
cropped up in the first exami-
nation of examinations at Harl-
vard in 15 years.

The answer given by William
G. Perry, Jr., director of Har-
vard's-Bureau of Study Coun—
sel, is that snowbound student
bluebooks should be divided in-
to two Classes. “Bull" is opinv
lori without supporting (actl.
“Cow” is fact: without under»
standing. It the grader has to
make a choice between these
two categories, says Perry. ho
should take bull every time.

According to Perry, “bull in
pure form is rare: there is usu.
ally some “contamination by
data." But even in its purest
form, bulling “expresses an im-
portant part of what a plural-
ist university holds dear, sure-
ly a more important part than
the collecting of ‘facts that are
facts,’ which schoolboys learn
to do.”

Unlike the cower, says Perry.
the bullor is close to being “in
a strong position to learn com
lent rapidly and meaning hilly,
and retain it. I have learned to
be less concerned about the
education of a Student who has
come to understand the nature
of man’s knowledge, even
though he has not yet com.
mitted himself to hard work,
than I am about the education
of the student who, after one
or two terms at Harvard, is
working desperately hard and
still believes that collected

 

"facts” constitute knowledge.“
