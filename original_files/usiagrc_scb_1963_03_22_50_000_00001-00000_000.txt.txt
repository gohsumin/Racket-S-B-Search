«Mail Must Face li's Anxiety

By Lynn Dcuzlel'

The main characteristic ot the
modern existentiolist movement
is a rebellion against the loss of
freedom, or the deliulllanizatioli
or man, according to Dr. Rollo
May, noted educator and my
chctherapist.

Beginning the annual Gates
Lecture Series sponsored by the
Department of Philosophy and
Religion. Dr. May spokc before
an overflow crowd in Herrick
Chapel Sunday evening on the

.subicct, “Existential Psychology
and Human Freedom."

“The concern with freedom
in the 20th century is with the

danger of losing it. to machines‘

_-which we have built,” he said.
”This is especially important in
the field of psychology where
the emphasis is on control of
the mind and personality."

Dr. May emphasized the prob.
lem of anxiety and its relation-
ship to freedom. Good mental
health results from the ability

. to face normal anxiety and the,

. relation of anxiety and freedom
rests in the capacity to accept
and bear it.

“It normal anxiety cannot be
faced, it needs to be avoided.”
he continued. “This leads to
neurotic anxiety ” He credited a
great deal of the apathy in Cur-
rent society to this same exp! .
sioii oi neurotic anxiety. With
the overbearing threat of there
monuclear war, apathy emerges
as a social symptom —

ety ol the historical situation."

Rate increases for student ems
ployinent to go into effect next
fall were announced today by
Robert. c. Sauers, Director of
Admissions and Student Aid,

Jobs now paying 75¢ per

those paying at present two.
