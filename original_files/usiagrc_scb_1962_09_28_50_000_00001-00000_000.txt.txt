Dove Golden: I think the best‘

part ot President Bowen’s plan
is that it will allow students
more time to do independent re-
search on subjects of interest to
them.

Gordon Kinkead: i think the
idea of less hours is good, but
I don’t think the students
would take advantage of the

Kathy Friend: On the whole,

his proposals for more independ
ent study on the part or the
students are good ones. How-
ever, i wonder if the students
are prepared for this degree of
academic freedom.

Heide Wolker: I think his

proposals are very good. but it
will take several years to pul
them through

Paul Coilrtright: I agree with

him in general about the em-
phasis on comprehensive edu-
cation. By living in a technical
age where the emphasis is or
speleiC education, there is a
need tor students with a broad
philosophical background to
have an understanding tor the
problems of our age and to
solve them. I like the idea ot-
shilting responsibility more on
the student

Linda Guthrie: I think that

they are great ideas and i hope
they can be put into effect
soon. This creative approach
should hopefully be put into ef-
fest immediately.

Ellis Simberloli': I thought the‘
proposals were a bit radical butl
