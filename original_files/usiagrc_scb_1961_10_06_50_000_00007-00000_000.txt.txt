The M iootball season had
one or its more memorable days
‘estel'day with three games oi
varying signiﬁcance, From the
percentage standpoint, the big
game was Smit ’s [H] victory
over North, giving the former
undisputed possession of second
lace, their 3—0—1 record ’falllng
’ust short of Dibble's 3.0-0,

Gates rolled up the biggest
score or the season as they
Villtzed South, 464). Jim Jenlts
caught four touchdown passes

trom Cat Collier to pace Gates, _'

who won their third game
against a single loss.

The other game on the
schedule provided au interest—
ing rebuttal to those purists
who say that north campus
akes l‘M‘s too seriously. iRIlW‘
son defeated East 19.1, but
the score was only a minor
part of the story. »

.Rawson built up a 13—0 lead
in the ﬁrst half, then pulled
their ﬁrst. string and sent in
their celebrated “Chinese Ban-
dit” unit, which succeeded in
racking up a phenomenal nume
her of penalties, plus one spec-
tacular, if somewhat accidental,
touchdown, before being merci—

removed from combat.

only touchdown, inci-
'lentally, was scored against the
Rawson varsity, indicative of

something.

‘The football standings began
to take on a very surprising
appearance, with two teams, in
particular, resting in unaccus-
oined positions Clark, with a
i‘z—o win over Langan, climbed
into a tie with Rawson and
Gates for third place and show-
ed signs of causing some trouble
or the rest or the ﬁrst division.

Cowles was surprising in a‘
dinerent directionas they went
through another futile week,

In the lopsided win Thomson

l Bowers added that he was
hesitant to single out any one
player as outstanding in the
Monmouth contest because he
felt “a ﬁne team eﬁozt" was re-

was particularly pleased with
the ﬁne blocking or his oftensive

lalso with the ﬁne play of Van

Coach Dick Young felt that the
team gave a poor eifort in the
meet, He was satisiied only with
Thomson’s consistency and Nort
en's improvement.
llighlighting the meet were
the times turned in by two
frosh, raul Patterson and Rod

Brown, who grabbed the ﬁrst l

two places respectively. Pate
terson‘s winning time of 16:44

was 25 seconds faster than the l

winning (varsity) tinie.

Druce Beckord and Jeri Lang—
hom also ran well. Coach Young
was satisiicd with these tour
freshmen because this was their
first experience at the three milc
distance

Tomorrow Grinncll will run
against the Lawrence Vikings,
“They have the best potential or
any team in the colllel'cllce,”
said Coach Young, drawing on
the tact that they have their
whole squad returning They
have two boys who beat Tliome
son in the Conference meet last
year. it is doubtful, however,
that they will be in too good con-
dition this early in the season.
