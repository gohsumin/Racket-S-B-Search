Coffee Hour Topic

Abolish north campus? Separate
by class instead or by sex? Debate
raged over this question tor nearly
an hour Wednesday night in the
South Lounge oi the Forum.

The discussion was generated
after the encampment planning
committee had presented a report

on the 1965 encampment, After
each discussion group chairman
had reviewed the proposals made
by his committee, questions truth
the ﬂoor were opened to the au-
dience of about 50‘

The topic immediately became
the main proposal or the “College
and the Students" group, chaired
by Rick Edwards: “D ide the
campus between low8r division and
upper division.” in other words,
house all freshmen and sopho-
mDres on one campus and the
upperclassmen on the other.

This topic monopolized the dis-
cussion ior 50 minutes. Arguments
about the relative maturity at the
campus, the desirability of con-
tact between them. and the possi-
bility of a system or graduated
regulations were presented and
refuted.

Nelson. Sutherland. Thomas
New Grinnell Professors

“The kind of education at a good
liberal arts school is as close to
one kind of an educational ideal
as possible, which is one or the
things that brought me to Grin-
nell,” Malcolm A. Nelson, new
assistant protessor of English,
said.

Nelson. who received his mas»
ler‘s and doctorate at Northwes
tern after completing undergradu-
ate work at Williams, went on to
say that the size of the school and
the outlook on undergraduate ed-
ucation which he described as
“fairly broad and general," avail
both students and teachers of the
opportunity to become more aware
of things and people outside their
own area.

niter working as a graduate as.
sistant at Northwestern and teach-
ing tor six years at Miami in
Oxford, Ohio, Nelson ﬁnds Grin-
nell a place where people are not
segregated by their specialty, and
so less limited in their approach
to education.

years, first as a graduate assis-
tant and then as a teaching ieliow.
at Michigan where he was also
assistant conductor of the univeiu
sity symphony orchestra.

Sutherland's initial reaction to
Grinnell is good. He emphasizes
the importance or pertorming
groups as well as starting classes
in music. “Emphasis in a liberal
arts college such as this can get
a little misplaced. That danger
has been waided Off here." he

Asked about his reasons (or
choosing to teach at his alma
mater, Thomas replied “You should
be able to answer [hat tor yours
Self."

Specifically. Thomas pointed out
two advantages possessed by Grins
nell or a college of Grinnell's type,
He reierred to the importance
placed upon teaching (as opposed
to research) and the close rela-
tionships possible between iacuity
and students

“The commitment to teaching
mat is present in a small school
is lacking in a large one," he con-
tinued. “In a research-orientated
atmosphere there is no time left
ior teaching."
