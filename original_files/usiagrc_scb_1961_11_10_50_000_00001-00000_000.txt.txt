Senate Passes i
‘No Tesl' Plea

by Paul Samuel

Standingsroomronly is the;
word which describes room 125
ot the Science building last Mon
day night as the Student Son.
ate roiod 2947 in tavor oi a
resolution opposing the riestlmps
tioii oi atmospheric nuclear test-
ing hy the United States.

The resolution Was a rewr ‘
ten version M the one which:
had been presented to the Sens
ate on Nov. 2 and which had,
been taken back to the halls fort
consideration by hall members i
The language of the old resolu-
tion had been cleared up and.
made less flowel‘y‘ but to all

intents and purposes, the resolu-‘ .

tion was the same.

 

The resolution consists of foul"
parts—tact, principle, declaration[
and mandate. The declarationl

te Here

US. Senators Hubert, H. Hum-

 

Capehart, Humphrey Delia

proposes that “We, the Studenti

Senate of Grinnell College, op
pose resumption of atmosph

to nuclear testing by the Unit-
ed states," (An amendment
during debate inserted
phrase. y a Vote of . to

after "Grlnnell College, ) l

The mandate empowers “the
appropriate student govern-
ment oiiicers to send copies at
this resolution to such deiense
and military oiiicials as the
president, Secretary of De-
icnse, the Secretary of Health.
Education and Welfare, the
Joint Cliiers oi Stati and the
Chairman oi the Atomic Encr—
gy Commission." 2

These officers are furtherl
empowered “on ,belialt of the
Student Senate ot the Student
Government Association to ex-l
press the decision at the Senate‘
on this matter as they see ﬁt."

Quizzed as to What the words
“as they see fit" meant, SGA
president Bill Halamzt explained)
that the Student Government

l
Association planned to seek ins;

ter 'ews with important state
otticials and possibly to hold a‘
“press conference" which might
be picked up by the wire serv-i
iccs. He said hc hoped the idea
would then snowball to other

colleges across the country. 1

Debate on the resolution, lastr
ing more than two hours, was
restrained and wellspresentedl
Senate Speaker Cameron Hen—
dershot characterized the debate
as “the finest that l have ever
seen since 1 took ottice."

Arguments tor and against ‘
the resolution seemed to iol- ,
low live diiierent lines oi l
thought. Those senators speak—
ing on the pro side emphasized
that, iirst, genetic detects will l
occur it testing is continued; t
second, that the biological eh i
iects oi fall»out are harmful, ‘
even in small amounts i
Third. the resolution does not;

protest against
testing and is not a sign of}
