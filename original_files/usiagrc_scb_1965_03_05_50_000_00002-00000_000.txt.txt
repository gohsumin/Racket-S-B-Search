The FCSA

We don’t quite understand why the faculty, through the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, has taken upon itself
to administer law and order on the Grinnell campus.

What troubles us most is that, unlike administration of-
ficials, we can’t even talk to the FCSA. To be sure, we did
receive a vague written statement on the committee‘s duties
that appeared in the first issue of the 5&3 after Christmas,
but we have never been granted an interview.

To heighten our irritation, in its most recent statement
the FCSA observed that its lninutes show that the committee
had indeed made a recommendation on the problem of ju 's-
diction at a January meeting and that the problem was dis-
cussed at other meetings Then the report blasts the students:
“Student ignorance of this fact does not excuse the charges
that have been made against the committee.”

Still, the FCSA has consistently refused to discuss
the business of its meetings with the 5&3.

Our records show that three of the eight FCSA members
do not subscribe to the 8&8, which does at least give an indi-
cation of present campus attitudes. Are not the non-subscrib-
ers failing to inform themselves of Student Affairs, even
though such information is easily available?

Finally, we just cannot see why any faculty member
would want to get involved in an undertaking that adds so
greatly to a schedule that apparently has most professors
teaching too many classes.

So let’s give up on the FCSA and give back to the admin-
istration that which the administration says it possesses—
the right to judge student conduct. The actions of the admin-
istration, at least, are understandable, even if not agreed with,

A New Love for This Modern Romantic

Friday. March 5. l9“

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

it came to pass, in a land in;
the cold and bleak regions of
Scandinavia, that there lived a
race of exceeding tall and fair
people, noted ror their good-l
nature and slow wit,

And it also came to pass
that there lived among these
people an exceeding short and
dark youth noted for his foul-
nature and quick wit. '

nature was far from pleasing,
the King, tall and slow-witted,
Was able to perceive some
worth in having such a person
as counsel, And so the King
made the little man Chief
Counsel, a great honor indeed
for one so young.

And, it being a time of war,

to negotiate a complex but
valued treaty. And, as so rare-
ly happens in government, the
Chief Counsel was the person
best able to negotiate the
treaty, for not only was he the
fastest Wit in the natlon, but the
tar southern land was a land
of his own people.

The Emperor of the southern
land, a mighty potentate, was
surprised when he saw the
counsel sent to him by his
friends of the North. He was
surprised by the Counsel’s
youth. He was surprised by
the Counsel’s stature. And,
most of all, he was surprised
by the Counsel’s complexion.

The Emperor was surprised,
but impressed and much in-
clined to be amenable to the

quick wit also, could not resist
a little humor in a business so
serious. Said he, “Does your
King send to me, a mighty po~
ientate, a beardless youth to ne-
gotiate so complex and valued
a treaty?”

And the youthful Counsel,
being of foul-nature, said, “Had
my King known that you im-
puted wisdom to a heard, he
most certainly would have sent
a goat."

Now one can only go so
with an emperor, a mighty
tentate, and it seemed that
Counsel had gone too far,
forthwith the Emperor had
youth’s head removed.

Which all goes to prove even
if you are of exceeding quick
wit, among you own kind, and

far

it fell upon the Chief Counsel

And while this youth's {dull

The Emperor, being or e

favorably received; nobody
likes a foulvi-iature.

A Parable 0/ Just Deserts '

One day, under a glaring sun, in the middle of
a scorched desert, a young scientist, an elderly
philosopher, and a camel driver chanced to meet.
“Where are you going?” asked the camel driver.

“Why, my good man," replied the philosopher,
“that isn’t a relevant question atall. It matters
little where I am going as i haven’t gotten there
yet. Rather, you should inquire as to where l have
been in order to discover the relationship between
my previous situation and my present, more tan-
glble (even it just as much transient) locus. In this
way, through an orderly investigation or all relaled
properties you would be able to understand the sig-
nlncancc of my being independent or any tempor-
ary goal.”

“I am researching,” said the young scientist. "i
am not going anywhere, Being here is important in
itself. Who knows what I may discover,” he said
and began sitting the sand with a sieve,

“ineVltably,” replied’the philosopher to the sci-
entist, “you will discover the limits of your knowl-
edge. It is necessary to divorce oneself from lhe
immediate in order to gain a complete vision. one
cannot know; one can only speculate. The essence

lol the problem is to remain apart and malntclln

one’s objectivity. in the course of events one Will
undoubtedly ﬁnd that once solid connectlons become
tenuous and that things once considered periecl lice
come flawed. in any case, one must remain flex-
able.” «

"The more you know," replied the scientist, “the

more accumie your entire picture becomes."

“And indeed, more difﬁcult to assemble," nn-
swered the philosopher. "That is why i am here.
Someone must discover lhe relationship of the parts
to the whole, But it must be done without involve
ment with any one of the parts. Such an involve-
menr would tend [0 result in a biased universal, an
immersion of the whole in the single pail. it one
truly seeks veritas, one must seek it in comparative
darkness."

“I say," Said the sclenllst. who had not been
listening, “this is ouicksandl Help me get out!"

“Darkness,” repeated the philosopher. “Darkness
is unfortunately lhe suit! true conceptions are made

need one ray at a time, or else we become lost in
the chaos oi many. We can accept only so much
mVla at any given moment. else we become
drowned in it.”

“I say, help!” screamed lhe young scientist,

“Drowned, yes I said drowned,” continued the
philospher smiling beatiﬁcially. “In the scheme of
the universe, the surprising is commonplace and in-
iinity is the yardstick. We can only hope to grab
some solid object, to reach some high ground in
order to maintain, it only for a moment, a stale
oi stability in a situation in which the norm is
ilux. In this way, and only in this way, may we
gain an understanding or the true order of nature."

“Help," screamed the Scientist, trying to grab
the philosophers leg. The camel driver, who ﬁnally
was awakened by the scientist's anguished cry
leaped to the ground and hurried over to him. To~
gather with the philosopher, whom he aroused
irom his reverie. he helped the scientist out or (he
quicksand.

“We may indeed iii-ill that there is nothing solid
outside at ourselves,” said the philosopher as the
scienllst was Wiping the muck from his clothing.
“in which case we must turn in upon our own be-
ing for the stability necessary to ‘draw order 1mm
ihe Chant": universe about us."

”My goodness," said the scientist, picking up his
sieve again, “I shall have to do my research some
where else . , . perhaps that dune over there.”

“You will iiiid nothing but quicksarld my good
man," replied lhe philosopher. “One can which
stand the essence of that hill from here much bet-
ter than when one is immersed in it. The meme
physical interrelation of the integral parts is berler
appreciated at a distance; the whole is apparent
only to the detached.”

The camel driver had mounted again and was
whipping his animal into motion. As he picked his
way around the quicksand that the solentlst had
inllen into, the philosopher and the scientist
choruscd. “Wait, yoll haven't told us where you‘re
going."

The camel driver contemplated the vastness or
the desert in (rent or him. “To get out or ibis

of. We tend to be blinded by too much light. We

damned heat," he replied, and rode all. And he (lid.
