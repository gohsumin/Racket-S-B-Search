Seniors Start in last Home Game;
Hoopsters Will End Year on Road

By Bob Kat:

After watching our basket-
ball team Complete its home
season by beating Monmouth,
then losing to Knox and Core
nell, one can’t help wondering
what next year will bring.
We’ve played heads-up, hustling
ball this year. The fans have
been treated to many an excit-
ing game, regardless of the
eventual outcome. Our only
problems have been lack of ex-
perience and not putting the
ball through the basket enough
times. The two go handin-
hand. With the new confidence
and unity that this season will
hopefully instill in the team for
next year, I can see only forty
minutes a game of good, solid
basketball for next year.

It was only fitting that we
beat Monmouth. From Ted Ris-
ser'p lay-up at the opening
jump. to Clyde Smith's tap»in
with seventy seconds left to
play, the team showed more
than once that it was ready to
play serious basketball. But the
old nemesis, failure to score,
took its toll in the closing min-
utes Of the first half, as Mon-
mouth sneaked a 46-42 advan-
tage into the locker room, after
we had led for the first 19 min-
utes. Three minutes and twenty
seconds into the second half,
the score was tied. For the
next nine minutes we were in
control, until the Scots hit nine
points to our two to turn a 71-
66 deficit into I 75-73 lead, Then
Elliott Hibbs popped three
jump shots to take the game
into a 79-79 deadlock with two
minutes to go; then Clyde
Smith took matters into his
hands with the gamewinning
tap and a key steal that al-
lowed us to take a three point
lead with thirty seconds to play.
Fate was with us as we held
on for an 83-81 victory. All five
starters hit double figures,
Hibbs leading the way with 22,
Jeff Frant’t with 20, and Tom
Hill with 13.

Hill started the Knox game
all over the floor, hitting two
baskets, iorcing a jump ball
three times, and making a fine

steal within the first four min-
utes. The team caught fire,
building up several eight-point
leads. but lost its edge at the
conclusion of the half, leaving
with a scant 43-41 margin.
Knox took nine seconds to tie
up the score as the second half
started, and went ahead to stay
latter six minutes. We moved to
within three points with five
minutes
had its troubles scoring under
the basket, but the Swishers
finished with a ill-l outburst,
and took home an 81-66 deci-
sion. The bright note of the
game was Jeff Frantz's setting
of a new school season scor<
ing record, as he connected for
18 markers. Hibbs, Smith and
Risser also hit double figures.

Tuesday night was the final
home game of the season, and
Coach John Pfitsch started his
four seniors, along with Frantz,
in commemoration. Of the four,
Dave Seliergren, Clyde Smith,
Randy Morgan, and Dick Ul-
rich, Smith was the only regu-
lar, but the others played like
starters as they fought to n 31-
33 haifvtime deficit against a

title. All four hit double figures,
Morgan leading the way with
18, as they capped their Grin-
nell home basketball careers.
Sellergren hit long jump shots
and showed good hustle in get—
ting 15 points; and Ulrich
played a fine floor game while
amassing his 13. Smith played
the pivot like a pro, while hit-
ting for 10. The second half
started Well, as we had a 39-38
lead with 17:15 to play, but all-
oonference Jack Grams took
the Rams to a ten-point advan-
tage with twelve minutes to
play, from which we never re-
covered, the game ending 77-
71. The seniors played most of
the game,

job.
