Gridders Will Host Buccaneersi

Pass defense will be the order
of the week as the Grinnell Pio—
neers prepare to meet aerial—
minded Beloit here on Ward
Field at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.

For each club it will be the
fifth Midwest Conference game,
with the Grinnellians resting in
second place with a 3—1 mark
and Beloit in a tie for eighth
with a 1-3 record.

Although the Bucs have won
only one game, they have one
of the best passing attacks in the
loop, led by allsConference quai»
terback Jim Kupllc,

“After what happened last
week, and recalling what he
(Kuplic) did to us last year, we
should be more than ready to
work on pass defense this week,"
Coach Edd Bowers sai .

Last week One hit on three
straight long passes in the last
minute of the first half to
score. And again, late in the
game, the Kohawks used
passes to puu them into posi-
tion for the three-point field
goal which clinched their was
victory.

Last year Kuplic. with his
club down 23-0 ,began firing the
long pass, pulling the Bucs back
into the game. only to see Grine
nell hang on and win 29%, .,

Coach Bowers also said he
planned to work more on the
Pioneers’ upsandrcomlng passing,
attack this week, in the last two
outings for the Grinnellians,
quarterbacks Art Peterson and
Dick Orchard have been hitting
ends Gene Kowert and Fred
Arnold with regularity.

So far this season. Orchard is
the leader, finding the target 11
times in 24 tries for 150 yards.
Peterson has hit on s of 19 air
tempts for 112 yards. 1n half as
many games, these two pitchers
have compiled only 45 fewer
yards than Grinnell gained pass-
ing all last year.

The ground attack, led by
John Hartung and Ryd Waller-
stedt, still provides Bowers l
with his main offensive threat,
The two have rambled for a

total of 614 yards in the four
games, with nartung holding a
344-270 edge over the fleet’
Wallerstedt. t

Though the Coe game was ai

tough contest, the Pioneers came
out in good physical shape and
should be at their physical peak
for Beloit.

Coach Bowers is expected tot
start the same offensive outfitl
against Beloit that he did last
week againet Coe, including:
ends Kowert and Arnold, tackles
Arlan Danne and Dennis Asby,
guards Dick Harris and John,
Hentzel, center Kirk Van Rooy-
an, and backs Art Peterson,
Carlton Peterson. Wallerstedt
and Hartung.

When Grinnell regained pos-
session of the ball, both quar—
terbacks, Art Peterson and
Dick Orchard, led a march sus-
tained by a well-clicking aerial
attack to the (Joe five yard

Kohawks moved the pigskin

afternoon. Ryd Wallerstedt

The previously unbeaten Grin-
nell Pioneers suffered their first
defeat of the season at the hands

before a crowd of 2000 at Cedar
Rapids, Saturday. The heavy,
powerful Kohawks line and the
spotty defensive play of the Pier
neer backfield were key factors
in the loss.

Out to make a good showing
on their Parents Day, the Coe
gridders came through in the
clutch, scoring all their points
with less than 30 seconds to go
in each half. The loss dropped
Grinnell into a second place tie
with St. Olaf in the Midwest
Conference standings, while Core
nell secured sole possession of
the top spot by swamping Bee
loit 25-7,

Coe took the opening kickoff
and began a drive which netted
four quick first downs before the
Grinnell line stiffened on a

, The Pioneer fans who made the trip to Coe last_ week
lwel‘e shown a perfect example of the actions of an imma-
tlll'e college community. As the Grinnell rockers lined up on
ltlle field to welcome their team bitch onto the gridiron at the
islal‘l. of the second half, a large portion of the Coe students
lstormed out of their seats, across the field and forced the
Pioneers back onto the track next to the stands, They then
jeered and hollered to drown out the cheers of the Pioneer
cheerleaders.

Let us hope that we at Grinnell will continue to treat
the opposing teams and their rooting sections with the re—
‘spect that good sportsmanship demands.

far” according to Coe coach Glenn Drahn. Let’s hope the
Kohawks can keep up for Cornell. Coe has defeated Cornell
