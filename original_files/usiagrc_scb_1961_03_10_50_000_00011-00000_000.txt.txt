Saed met me at the bottom
ot the hill to take me to her
apartment. We had a dclightul
time struggling to communicate
iii Turkish, liaiian. Spanish. and
English. In the process 1 dis
covered that she was Turkish!
She had 19' ned ltaliaii in a
private school,

, Hall an hour later Stied's
aunt and cousin Behan arrived.
Behan is a student at the col-
lege so she tran ted tor us.
Their curiosity led to such div
rcct question as "Do you have
boyl end. and "What is your
salaryll‘ They couldn’t. believe
I was not being paid, I think
tliev thought 1 was avoiding the
issue,

They were as direct about
giving direct compliments as
asking personal questions. I
ﬁgured out later, though,
that the reason they thought
I looked like an American
iashion model was that I was
wo ring American clothes and
not that i looked like a model.

Betsy invited us to a peanut

ourselves craving favorite Amer-

‘ As I was walking through the

main square in town today I
saw some boys playing soccer
with an orange, 1 mentally note
ed it as something 1 hadn’t. seen
beiore, The thought came to
me again that living in a for-
eign country and trying to cone
vey my lite to people at home
makes me more sensitive to the
dittercnces and unusual things
because they are entertaining.
Yet; taken collectively the una
usual experiences and aspects
a not representative of my lite
here, Much ol my time is spent
doing the. same things i would

lbe doing in the States. This is

particularly true because 1 am
teaching a school sponsored by
Americans.

I also realize, though, that I
have become used to lstanhul
enough to take many things toi-
granted that seemed ditterei-it at
first the donkey cart do
1' .ing groceries, the cobble-
and the Turkish lang—
uage environment ot the city.

January 4, 1961

I was tloorcd to
message between classes that
John Backus and Art Wycott
wanted me to call, They had
taken seriously my casual inc
vitatioa to visit lstanbul at the
end ot their Christmas vacation
in Greece. it was almost impos—
sible to believe that we were
walking down the street together
in Turkey and yet it was so
natural They only stayed two
days, it was tun to introduce
them to the city as my iii-st
experience of trying to guide
instead of being guided. it it
hadn’t been for John's French
we would have been, lost two

or three times.
