A Student

Newspaper

Scarlet & Black is the student newspaper of Grinnell
College. It is written to be read by Grinnell students, and
all others who read it must bear this in mind.

Feature topics and editorial positions may not meet
with the reader’s approval, but the responsibility of the
paper will not be questioned. Scarlet {it Black intends to
be bound by relevancy, taste, credibility and law, but by
nothing else. A good paper must have inner discipline
rather than an imposed outer harness. Scarlet & Black
may cause anger or pleasure, but it will be consistent in
its awareness of its responsmility to provide Grinnell stu-
dents with accurate and relevant news and comment.

Women's Hours

The elimination of women’s hours was long awaited,
and is a welcome liberalization of college rules. In rec-
ognition of this signal occasion, discussion of Grinnell’s
remaining social problems will be suspended until next

week.

 

There will he ii short meeting tor new and returning stu-
dents interested in working tor the 5&3 in any capacity.
The meeting will be held Sunday at 2:15 p.m. in the 5&3

5 (north end oi the Forum basement).
