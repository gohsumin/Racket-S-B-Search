Positions Are Open
On Campus Courts

Applications are now being ac-
cepted for openings on the High
Court. According to Bill l-lalama,
SGA president, two positions,
those vacated by Tonia Kolosky‘
and Lee Weisel will have to
be filled. The terms of both Miss
Kolosky and Weisel come to an
end this month, according to
tenure of office for the High}
Court as set up in the new SGA
constitution,

Those wishing to apply should
submit written statements to the
Executive Cabinet stating theii
background qualifications and
reasons for wanting the pop
Deadline for applications is
Thursday. The Executive Cabinet
will then make its appointments,
which will be subject to Senate
approval on November 1. Appli-
cants must have at least second
semester sophomore standing.

The duties of the High Court
are two—fold. First, it acts as an
appelate court. Any student or
group of students who has been
fined by a Primary Court may
appeal the decision to the High
Court. Such cases are open or
closed as the defendant wishes,
and the decision of the 'High
Court is final (unless the student
takes the case to the administra—
tion). .

A decision must always be
made first by the Primary

Court. The High Court has

original jurisdiction only when

a member of the Primary

Court has been involved in _a
misdemeanor.

The other duty of the High
Court is to serve as an interprer
ter of the SGA constitution. The
Court has the right to veto as
unconstitutional any act of legis—
lation passed by the Senate.
Such cases are open to the pub—
lic' and, in case of a Court veto,
the law becomes null and void;
there is no appeal.

Arguments, both pro and con.
are presented at an opening
hearing. The verdict is made
public and each justice’s vote
is stated, Maiority and disent-
ing opinions are also written
and are presented to the Scarlet
and Black for publication.

Two positions on both the
men’s and women's Primary
Courts are now open, accord
ing to Calm president Ray
Horton and Aws Board presi-
dent Jill Dennington.

Term of oifice for the four
positions is one year. Applir
cants, who must have at least
second semester sophomore
standing, should file their
names and qualifications on
or before Thursday with Hor-
ton or Miss Dennington
