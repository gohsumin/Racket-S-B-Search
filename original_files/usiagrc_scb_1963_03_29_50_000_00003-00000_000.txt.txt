Individual Evaluation Might Lead
to Eltra curricular Participation

To the Editor.

This is a time of evaluation
on campus, All of the various
organizations are involved in an
evaluation and a culmination of
the year’s activities before the
transition at spring vacation.

This evaluation process is
good. Organizations will proﬁt
from it. But it must be accom—
panied by a similar process on
the part of the individual stus
dent. This is the time of year
when he must do some evaluat—
ing of his "Grinnell experience."

Four years at a small liberal
arts college in the middle of
Iowa will make a big differenc
in his life. The person he has
become when he receives that
coveted B.A. is partly determin—
ed by what he has done during
the four preceding years. Actvi—
ties both in and out of the class—
room are important.

SOME or THE latent abili-
ties of an entering student are

developed at Crinnell. The im-,

portant thing to realize, though,
is that the choice as to whether

his latent abilities are developed,

rests with each individual stu-
dent. His choice of activities, or
his choice of no activities, is his
own. However, when he says.
“I’ll wait and see how much
time I have.” and then, rather
unconsciously, never gets involv—
ed, he’s putting off a decision.
By deciding not to decide. he
usually makes a decision not to
participate.

Our college community has a
wealth of ﬁne extra—curricular
activities. Each offers many op—
portunities for service and lead—
ership. Now each organization
is concerned with the problem
of student apathy. It‘s a tragic

situation, but the tragedy is on,

the individual level. ln the long
run, not the organization, but
the individual student, suffers.
Four years at Grinnell cost
exactly the same in time and
dollars no matter what one does
while he’s here. It’s easy to
pass up opportunities, or to put
off the decision. The hard thing
to do, it seems, is to make that
active decision to participate;
this is the time of year to make

,it . .

This is not a plea for a com—
munity of ioiners. Nor is it an
anti- Burling treatise. But it is
inspired by a real concern that
Imany students are passing up
once in a- lifetime opportun' ies
by just never making a positive
decision to get into extracurric-
ular activities.

The way to get to know peo—
ple and the way to develop la—
tent personal qualities is to
jump in with both feet, to do
some work, and to make a real
contribution to the community.
Active participation in selected
extracurricular activities will in-
lﬁnitely enrich our Grinnell ex-
perience. It's a necessary sup-
plement to academic activities.
Let’s bring the beforesspring-va-
cation evaluation down to an
individual level and then per-
sonally and actively launch the
various programs for next year.

Ultra-conservative Beliefs

By John Wolf
5&3 Ass’t News Editor
The visitor to Des Momes lastl
Friday evening could find manyl
things to do Besides hosting,
the semiﬁnals in the boys statel
basketball tournament, the city
was also the site of an ultra-
conservative political rally. The
main attractions of the rally,
“Operation Midnight Ride,"were
General Edwin A. Walker—for.
mer army general who resigned
following a controversy over
his John Birch views and more
recently involved in rioting at‘
the University of Mississippiil
and Dr. Billy James Hargis, head

Even the basketball semiﬁnals
were not enough competition for
Walker and Hargis. Approxi-
mately 1400 people, including
ﬁve from Grinnell College, ﬁlled
Hoyt—Sherman auditorium to
hear the threc»hour marathon.

Hargis spoke ﬁrst on the in-
ternal threat of communism (ac-
tually going beyond communism
to include all organizations
which are “anti»Chl‘ist">.

l-largis covered a variety of
topics in the hour he had left.
He complained that too many
communists were being allowed
on college campuses because this
is “academic freedom." On the
other hand, it is “nnscholarly”
to allow anti-communists to
speak.

Expounding on another sub—
ect, Hargis exclaimed that he
Couldn’t think of a worse paper
in the country than the ”ultra-
liberal Des Moines Register-
Tribune."

American Activities (not the

Committee, stressed Hargis) re-

it is basically a good system
and must be fulﬁlling its mis—
sion, since it is now the No. 4
target on the international com-
munist hate list.

The National Council of‘
Churches was the next target.
Hargis cited a statement by

Arens (page 1303, Feb. 20 1960,

General Walker concluded the

‘program with a ll/zAhOLIX‘ disser-

tation on external
threats.

The UN. came in for the bit-
terest attack. of the evening.
Among other things, Walker as-
serted that “The UN. has no
future, because no future is in-
tended. it is only a propaganda
front.”

claimed that that organization
has laid the U. 5. "wide open to
invasion and occupation” (un-
doubtedly referring to Alaska,
which he said earlier is not hard
to take and which we are not
prepared to defend).

The constant reference to the
U.N. brought applause
some of the more liberal mem—
bers of the audience. Walker
drew the largest ovation of the
evening from the generally re.
ceptive audience when he said
that the hecklers just proved his
internal subversion
was possible in this country.

Following the talks, this re-
porter collected some literature,
including a copy of the propos-
ed “Liberty Amendment,” which
would repeal income tax and
take government out of “free
enterprise." The two actions
would hopefully offset one an-
other since the federal govern.

The literature claimed, “The

Toynbee described this as be-
ing one of the decisive ques-
tions for the future of the hu—
man race: “Are the newly inde-
pendent pecple going to prove
capable of running their coun-
tries in a modern way?

“To develop themselves, the
newly independent countries need
large capital investments from
abroad. Will the rich countries
be willing to invest? Will the
poor countries be willing to re-
ceive foreign investments with
conditions attached?

“The newly independent coun—
tries are naturally sensitive a—

ment on their independence. At

power and wealth are in the
