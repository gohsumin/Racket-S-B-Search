By DAVID SWEE

in a recent interview with the 55:3,
the outgoing SGA executive cabinet
sharply criticized the administration a.
they talked about the frustrations that
they enoountered in their year in oﬂica.

Tom Thomas, outgoing SGA president,
complained that the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC), is used to legitimize,
in the guise of decisions made by it
student—facultyvadminlstratlon commit-
tee, programs already decided upon by
the dean's office. Lee Mari], outgoing
CoiHP president, claims that the stu-
dents don’t need the SGA. the adminis-

tration, or many segments at the facul-
ty. And Heather Foote, outgoing Aws
president. talked about how the adminis-
tration keeps the students under control
by staying an inch ahead or them. "Peo-
ple have been inching along the ruler,
but if they don't watch out. the ruler is
going to break."

They all agreed that their biggest dis-
illusionment came in finding that the
SAC has no real power. Although it is
thought to be the iinal decision making
body next to President Leggett, both
the students and the faculty have found
that the important decisions are made by
the Deans outside the committee, which
is then lctt to work out the petty details.
As Tom Thomas said, “The power of the
SAC is merely peripheral, since it con-
cerns itself only with minor details." He
pointed out that the iaculty members also
have reservations about the committee
being merely a “butter" to placate stu»
dents.

in concluding their discussion at the
SAC, the executive cabinet warned of
the dangers in the present committee.
As Tom said, “Problems are brought to
the sac simply because it exists. in-
stead oi this approach, students should
be demonstrating and bringing pressure
to bear on President Leggett, where it
may have some eiiect." Lee added.
“The committee is basically all Uncle
Tom committee.” And Heather conclud-
ed with a few more concrete examples.
"Loose is already designated as a co-ed
dorm, although the committee hasn't

Considered it. And adiiiiiiisti‘ation has
also decided that one oi the women’s
halls will be turned into a men's hall. All
that is left to the committee is to decide
which particular ball will be changed,
and even that is dependent on size and
which RAs are to be hired, so that there
are only a lew alternatives.”

There then followed a discussion at
some oi the things the executive cabinet
felt they had accomplished. They all
agreed that Tom Triplett has been an ex-
cellent and helpful Student Coordinator,
Lee felt that the four at them had accel-
erated the “scheduled time-table con-
cemlng rules." He thought it was good
that they had “hassled people and made
them think.” Tom thought that their
biggest contribution was in changing
the concept of the SGA 1mm a monolithic
student voice to a more realistic coali»
tion of interested studentsi Lee added
that they had succeeded in not falling
into the traditional role of SGA, but
tailed in expecting too much irom the
CDIHP. AWS Boards.

Part of the problem is that the admin-
istration is used to student body presiv
dents with the style at a Ric McDowell,
who released administrative secrets only
when appropriate, and was a close friend
ot President Leggett. Heather pointed out
that this year's executive cabinet tried
to do away with the aura surrounding
student leadership, "to do away with
the facade that you are expected to put
on. ‘You must iteep your distance be
cause you have administrative secrets.’ "
Tom added that when the Deans coma
piained to him about remembering “that
when ! speak in public, i'm not Tom
Thomas, but an SGA president. What
they don’t remember is that I was elect-
ed SGA president because I am Tom
Thomas.” None of the SGA executive

No More Regular

There used to be time when one could
buy plain or “regular" Yoghurt at the
forum grill. But last week the forum
quit stocking regular yoghurt. When
asked why, the grill women replied,
“we said so much that We couldn't keep

kingdom oi the adult world.

As mentioned before. Tom sees an im—
poriant change in the SGA role, “lactate,
the SGA was consensus of student
Opinion, especially as reﬂected in the stilr
dent senate. But that myth has been
abandoned. We now deal with diversi—
fied needs and limited interests." Heatir
er added that a reflection of this is the
trading oi house presidents as the student
leaders. As she sees 1t, her job has
evolved to a student “who has more
contacts. and is thus able to ask better
questions." Lee sees his role as “reflect-
ing ways people are thinking, or at
least some people." Tom talked about
a student leader's job as deceiving in
that “As long as students think they
are talking to the power structure,
they are not going to get anywhere, es
pecially when the power structure hands
down decisions disguised as compro—
mises.”

in talking about the future. Tom said
that “we’re only haltrway there, for we
haven't even realized the potential of
students acting cohesively.” Heather re-
sponded explaining that the SGA will not
even be needed in the future, and she
envisioned some student pressure groups
in the iorm oi student unions. “My job
should melt away in a few years.” Les
said that, “What we have here is {I
growing population of middleclass. ali—
enated people, 18 through 22, and I
don’t think they’re going to take the
we’ve been getting, much longer.
Maybe it Slocum had stayed, and kids
had been forced to rebel, we would have
been much farther along already.
The administration has now evolved into
an institutionalized paciiier, always one
step ahead oi student demands.”

The SGA executive cabinet warned that
the new SGA will never be effective I( it
doesn’t learn to handle the money issue
which they reel is at the root of mmly
campus ills. As Tom said, “Right now,
we have a seii-deieating system, what we
might call the prime-thepump theory or
college finance. we spend our money in
ways that attract more money. And we
spend that money so that we will at-
tract even more money. it never stops.
And thus we get a gym and a reception
center. The student seems to be a third
party who is scarcely considered.”
