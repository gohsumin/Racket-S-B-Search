SCORE FLYING PUCKS

By ALAN BERNHARDT
5&3 staff Writer

Mike Schafier, an enterpris
log sophomore, has brought a
new sound to the Grinnell cam~
pus. No, he’s not the organizer
of a band, but of a hockey club.
The sound is of a shap shot re-
sounding off the boards of Bar-
ber Plaza Ice Arena.

The sign on the side of the
rink warns: “No games of ally
kind", but Mike has Changed
that. He has made arrangements
for the hockey club to practice,
bought equipment, scheduled

, games, secured funds and is
teaching people to play hockey.

There are now twenty-two

, members who practice two
nights a week.

They played three games last

- semester and have played again
this semester. s.

Last year Mike and Steve
Gausebeck got the idea of get-
ring some interested students
together a couple of times a
week to play hockey. They se-

cured permission irom Miss
King to use the rink two nights
a week from 10 to 12 pint, and
Sunday morning.

At that time there were about
eight or ten people who played.

The only problem they en-
countered was that B&G men
kept kicking them Off the rink,
explaining they had not heard
anything about hockey being
permitted.

This year about twice as many
people have been playing.

At an organizational meeting
the group decided to join the
US. Amateur Hockey Associa-
tion as the Grinnell Blades.

The meeting also elected
Schsfier captain - coach.

When Schaiier told President
Leggett about the club's plans
to play teams from other schools,
Leggett was so enthusiastic he
volunteered free use of the col-
lege wagons and box lunches
for team trips.

Schafier then went to local
merchants to secure money.
Over $120 was collected. The

After seeing my column elevated to the status where one can‘t
read the title, I feel somewhat inadequate (but not too much) in
the face of the pressure placed upon me by having an old English
lay—line, in any event. I will continue my policy of printing all the

news that’s fit to print.

Basketball commenced last Wednesday to the usual strains
of the losers trudging off the court mumbling. “It's just a game,”
and the winners triumphantly singing, “(Rawson West, South,
etc.) uber alles.” In any event, good luck to all (in greater and

lesser degrees, or course).

The Grinnell Blades (what blatant megaiomania) returned in-
tact but somewhat weary from their hockey excursion to North.
field. It is even rumored that part of the fatigue was due to the
hockey. keeping with the Grinnell tradition, all games were lost.

Recently, NBC Sports did a special photographic show of
Bernie Casey, L. A. Rams flanker, to demonstrate the poetry in
motion found in professional football. The show was largely 3 Sue
cess with the major problem being that Bernie Casey was a man.

Therefore, in order to provide a view of the poetry in motion
or the other gender, the w. it. A. has Ihoughtfuliy produced, for
campus consumption, Women‘s Dance 1. M.’s. To say that this
event is a must on your calendar is superfluous, I need only re<
mind you that it is not every day that you are privileged to sea
luscious lovelies frolicking around in abbreviated attire.

The theme is, “Happiness is . r and among the suggested
answers are a dry martini (or even a wet one) by Loose and a
trip by Main. The trip is not further explicated but it is assumed
it will be something exciting like a trip to Montezuma or maybe

even Newton.

In any event, attendance is mandatory and roll will be taken
:(there may even be a short quiz next Tuesday).

apolis, and brought it back over
midsemester break.

Although the team has lost‘

several games and tied one,
Coach Schaffer is confident that
the team is at least as good as
other hockey clubs in Iowa. He
hopes to do well against other
teams in the state at the tourna-
ment to he played in February.

Two of the stars on the team,
instructor Terry (“Terror")
Parsinnen and Tom (“Rocket")
Jackson both played on the
Grinnell hockey team in 1562.
Hockey was a regular varsity
‘sport at that time.

Other outstanding players are
Mel Thompson, Joel (“Joque”)
Lamont, Al (“Gutsy") Heirnann
(who plays goalie), reii (“Boom
Boom") Millikan, and Steve
(“Khinook”) Gausebeck. Betsy
Heron is mascot, locker room
attendant, manager and score-
keeper.

Approximately hali oi the
members of the club never
played hockey before and half
of those had never skated before.

Mike would like to see even
more people become interested,
regardless oi their ability, and
he plans to form two teams com-
peting on their own ability lev-
el. “My purpose is to show peoa
pie a good time and teach them
a new sport," says Mike.

The group will be practicing
on Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 1042 pm. at night,

A position it in

ii the player to move
must make a move that
will bring on his defeat.

By J. VON BRIESEN RAZ

The American economy is, perhaps. the only economy in the
World which has afforded Itself the luxury of flooding its chess
market with “indescribably bad" chess literature. As is the case
with Contract Bridge literature, publishers are content to saturate
bookstores with garbage. satisfied with the knowledge that accord-
ing to recent sales trends the public appetite is up, and justified
by the Conviction that their actions are good for the GNP. In addi«
tion to the twothirds of the world population that goes to sleep
hungry every night may be added the chess playing public.

It is a sad but olten true fact that the beginning chess player
must attain a certain proliciency in the game before he is able to
discriminate between the wealth of refuse unlit ior human Con-
sumption and the few genuine works written ior the serious player
by masters with legitimate credentials. In response to this prob
lem, Zugzwang pliers the iollowing bibliography for the expert as
well as the uninitiated. the beginner as well as the casual player.

The best beginning books have been written by the intemation~
al grandmasters: Lasker’s Manuel of Chess, by Emanuel Lasker,
The Game of Chess, by Raoul Capablanca. Abracadabra chess by
Larry Evans (found in the “American Chess Quarterly")

Concerning the diiierent phases of the game, Reuben Fine's
Basic Chess Endings is the definitive work in endgame scholar-
ships; Larry Evans' New Ideas in Chess, Aron Nlmzovich’s My
System and Chess Praxls are among the best on the middlegame;
Reuben Fine’s The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings and Proo-
tloal Chess Openings rank under the compendium, Tenth Edition
oi Modern Chess Openings, for the opening phase of the game.

Insight into the brilliant chess‘mlnds or the past century may
be gained by an investigation of Znosko—Borovsky’s The Art of
Chess Combination.

The best anthologies oi games include Aielthine's two volumes
My Best Games of Chess, Botvinnik’s 100 Selected Games of Chess,
Fisbher's Best Games of Chess, and depending upon the player’s
taste several other grandmaster: made available in Dover Publi-
cations.

For the historically minded, Modern Ideas in Chess by Richard
Reti and Imre Konig's Chess irom Morphy to Botvlnnlk: A Cen-
tury of Chess Evolution deal with chess evolution irom a fairly
technical point of view while Edward Lasker‘s The Adventure of
Chess is interesting reading for the layman.
