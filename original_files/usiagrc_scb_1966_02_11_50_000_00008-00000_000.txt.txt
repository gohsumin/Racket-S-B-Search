Student Voices Questions

lTo the Editor:
, why did one halt of Grinnell’s
lpernianent coaching statt resign
.within a week?

Are steps being taken to secure
lnren of equal talent and expe
ience to fill these positions or will
inexperienced assistants be given
head coach positions as in the
past in wrestling and baseball?
