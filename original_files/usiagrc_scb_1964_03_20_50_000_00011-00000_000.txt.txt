Record Book

The individual and team sec-
tions of the Grinnell College
basketball record book were re-
written with reckless abandon
this year as 14_marks fell and
another was tied,

Even though Coach John
Piitsch's outfit could finish no
better than fifth in the Midwest
Conference with a 9-9 mark, it
still established seven new team
standards for a season, includ-
ing field goals (703), points
(1.739), and rebounds (1,184)

“We outshot, outrebmmd-
ed, and outscored our oppo-
nents on the season," Pﬁtsch
noted. “Yet we won only 12
or our 22 games. This just
points out the fallacy of statis-
ticsl”

This was the hard-luck year
{or the Pioneers. Of the'nine
conference defeats, six were by
a total of 18 points and one
nonrconference loss was by two
points in an overtime.

On the individual front, John
Sundell the backbone of the
team for three years, got a fist
full of new records, three for
rebounds, including one game
(31), season (443), and career
(1.031). He also has the best
season shooting percentage
(51.7) and most fouls for ca-
reer (200),

Right behind is Jim Mifflin,
the conference’s leading scor-
er, who tied the career point-
making record or 1,103 and
broke the career free throwing
standard of 357.

The last one belongs to Jeff
Frantz, who came up with
391 points, a new sophomore
standard. Frantz pushed by
the total by gathering in 83
markers in the last three
games.

On the season, Mifflin was
the team’s leading scorer with
438, including a single game
high of 37. This gave Mifilin a
19.9 average for the 22 games,

Cassius X pulled one of the
biggest upsets or the century,
but right here in our pleasant
little instltution for higher

became a reality. The Lip de-

Four years or deprivation
has stimulated the West boys
to throw off all notorious

are. But beware West, the rest
or the halls are eager to prove
that your new image is a nuke,
