Grinnell Visitors Seek Insights

Into Indian College's Problems

Visiting on campus this week
were Mr. and Mrs, S J. Savar-
trayan, [mm the American College
in Madurai, South India,

Savarirayan wound up the ma-
JOr stops in his two month United
States [Our Willi his visit here, after
spending time at Beioit, Carleton,
and Oberlin.

He summed up the purpose of
the trip as an chart “to learn
from colleges ot a size similar to
ours and aims Similar to Ours.” As
mericztn College is a small liberal
arts college in lndia, originally
founded by United States mission-
arics.

Savarirayan has been studying
American colleges irom tour main

. vantage points, he said. First, he
is observing what colleges here
are doing along the line or student
guidance and counseling, and how
successfully. Second, he is inter-
ested in studying the position ot
religion on a campus. He has no«
[iced similar tendencies in India
and the United States tor reiigion's
role to change, it not diminish,
even in schools that are religious
in Origin.

A survey of instructional facilities
is the Indian educator’s third in-
terest Finally, and most impor-
tant, he is trying to discover what

 

methods United States colleges
employ to make students think ior
themselves, express their own
ideas, and become intellectually
aware

The examination system in india
presents a real barrier to cultivat-
ing intellectual awareness, he
pointed out. Students become Ol'iA
ented toward passing exams rath-
er than educating themselves. He
said he was particularity interest-
ed in Grinnell‘s limited ci'edit-iztil
system.

In addition to these speciﬁc pur-
poses, Savarirayan said that his
trip was directed in a more gen-
eral way towards getting a reeling
about the whole American way oi
life and attitudes.

He said that he has already
gained more insights irom the tour
than he had originaliy expected.

in addition to visiting college
campuses, Savarirayan and his
wife have seen Harvard, Columbia,
and Rochester universities, and
plans a stop at Staniord before l'e-
turning to india.

India’s s p e C i f i 0 educational
problems include the language
problem, the relative newness or
higher education in lndia, the dif-
iicuity of a central control board
over all Indian colleges, and the
dominance of examinations.

Steiner's Independent Drama Proiect
Will Be Williams' ‘Glass Menagerie’

Henry - York Steiner is directing
an independent theatre project this
semester, The Glass Menagerie.
Th'i'e cast is Karyn Zimmerman as
Amanda Wingfield; Ken Hicks and
Debbie Abbott as Amanda’s chil-
dren Tom and Laura; and Chuck
Burns as Jim, the gentleman call-
er.

The play is set in St. Louis, now
and the past. Tennessee Williams
describes his characters in the
tollowing way:

Amanda - “A little woman oi
great but coniused vitality cling-
ing frantically to another time
and place.”

Laura - “Laura's separation
(from reality) increases till she is
like a piece or her own glass col-

lection, too exquisitely fragile to
move from the shelf.”

Tom - ”A poet with a job in a
warehouse. His nature is not.re-‘
morseless, but to escape from I
trap he has to act without pity."

Jim - “A nice, ordinary, young
man.”

The action centers around A-
manda's desperate attempts to
hold on to the past, She tries to
relive her life as a vivacious belle
through her shy. crippled daugh-
ter, telling her that she is not really
crippled, but only has a “slight
deformity". She asks, “So what
are we going to do the rest of our
lives? Stay home and watch the
parades go by? Amuse ourselves
with the glass rnenagerie, dar-
ling?“
