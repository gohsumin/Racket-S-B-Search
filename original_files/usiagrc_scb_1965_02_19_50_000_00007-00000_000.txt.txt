All?

By Paul Trigg

How [he Grinnell College basketball team could lose to St.
Olaf by 17 points and Carleton by 1|) points at Northfleld is a
real poser indeedr Losses to C02 5053 and Beloit 107-77 only
augment the dilemma; and it is everyone' 5 hope of course,
that we will not be shown the answer when these two teams in-
vade Darby arena this weekend.

The mystery of the Grinnell basketball team began with the
Cornell game, which seemed to prove all pre-beason pessimists
wrong. However, any optimistic hopes were dispelled just as
quickly with the two disastrous road trips to Northfield and
Cedar Rapids-Beloit,

Thus, last Friday night many students trooped over [0 Dar-
by hoping they would not want to exit at half-time and head
for Lolita. (Word has it that one person did leave at the half,
but rather than going to the movie he went to the library.)
Instead of being blitzed, however, the Pioneers extended the
Oles to the fullest.

Again Saturday, thinking Friday night to be an act of God,
students marched back to the gym only to see their heroes rout
Carleton 81-65 despite the efforts of a 6" 7" sophomore center
from (of all places!) Crosby—ironton, Minn. The obvious ques<
Lion asked by all was how did this apparent metamorphosis oc-
cur? The following is an amateur’s attempt at evaluating the
team and what happened last weekend.

In the past four years we have seen quite a variety of has
ketball player-types here. There has been a guard who could
shoot the eyes out of the basket, but played defense like one of
his feet was nailed to the floor; a forward Who could also shoot
well, but tended to dribble the ball off his metatarsals rather
frequently; a center who could rebound and dunk, but was not
quite rangy enough to stuii his foul shots; and a host of others.
These gentlemen were obviously played for their strengths and
in spite of their weaknesses. BeCause of this, it was easy to be-
come quite exasperated watching their weaknesses exploited
by opposing teams.

This year’s team is somewhat different than these past
teams, however. There is hardly an outstanding shooter, passer
or rebounder on the entire team, but they are a group of good
all-around basketball players who don't happen to have a man
over 6' 3” amongst them, Thus, they are forced to work hard
for every basket because they lack che physical strength and tal-
ent of most other teams. Last weekend this is precisely what
they did, harassing. driving, and generally out-hustling their
opponents.

The encouraging aspect of this turn of events is that the
average Grinnell tan seems to appreciate the effort that is being
put forth by the team. One of the loudest cheers or the weekend
occurred after Bob Watt's symbolic theft of the ball from the
hands of St. Olaf's very fine guard Eric Grimsrud.

At home this team is young, exuberant, and aggressive. One
possible explanation for the away games might be that the youth
turns to immaturity, the exuberance to disillusionment, and the
aggressiveness to docility. Without these ingredients in abun—
dance, the team Cannot do battle with the recruit-Infested squads
in the rest of the conference (For the record, these last prepo-
sitional phrases are in jest).
