The Buildings and Grounds workers have gone
on sti'i c. The Tcamsters’ Union and the College
have been unable to agree on a contract for these
employees. The College argues that its proposal is
lair within the bounds of its financial resources and
the current labor market. The Union argues that the
College can allol'd more and that the employees de-
serve more money and benefits. Student and fac-
ulty support for the strike has ranged from benign
sympathy to active participation in picketing and,
in several instances, to boycotting of classes.

The matters of the College’s financial resources
and financial commitments are complex ones. No
one, we believe, can make a decision on the justncss
of the position of either side without a thorough
examination of these. This week we have attended
both student and faculty meetings at which the
question of the strike was considered. It is pain-
fully obvious that a number of people are perfectly
willing to support the Buildings and Grounds work-
ers with little or no knowledge of the facts. At
neither of these meetings was the possibility serious-
ly considered that the Union is making unjust and
unreasonable demands. This is surely an example
of a degenerate kind of liberalism. It is compassion

without thought.

We do not categorically support either the Col-
lege or the Union in this matter. By the time this
editorial appears, some settlement may be reached.
We believe, however, activists to the contrary not-
withstanding, that the proper position for students
and faculty to take is one of respectful silence. As
for those faculty members who have refused to hold
Classes in support of the strike, we accuse them of
intolerable professional incompetence. A riLuTiber of
students and faculty have shown that their capacity
for righteous indignation far exceeds their desire

for reasoned action.

To The Editors:

Allhough democracy may be
ulijusl on a national level, it is
completely equitable here
at Gi'lilnell. The recent defeat
of Juslice Carswell showed that
lhe U S Senate is too narrow
minded to allow mediocrity in the
Supreme Couri. Thank God our
seiiale elections at Grinnell af-
lirm lhal nicdiocrily, loo, has lhe
