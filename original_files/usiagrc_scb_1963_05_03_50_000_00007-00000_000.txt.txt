will try to come back in a big
weekend oi conterence pla
with a meet against Ripon tee

In the lowa State meet the‘

After three lull weeks of play.
thC baseball round robin is sure
prisingly close to being on sched—
ule. with yesterday's raineut,
the lag is only two impossible
days to make up ‘

Three teams remained zit the
top, all With 4-1 marks. Those in}
this elite Club are Clai'k. Dib-
ble, and South. Ollc game back
are Rawson and Cowlcs with 3-2
records

Ron Turner posted the great,
est number oi strike—outs tor a
game last Friday when he whil‘f—t

mound tor Claik.

 

Harris Goldstein of East qualiel
ﬁed for the long hitters Club,

with a ball hit over the fence}

Jim Ramsey of Nai‘th has ask
ed to have the Nui'thsCIal‘kt
game wi‘ilten up this week. Afts

er a few heated arguments over,

close calls in the ri ’l inning,l
especially by the Clark livi chairs
man. both teams and the umps
cooled oil and Clark won 21—15.

The lM board vetoed a
posal that the golt‘ meet he star-t-
ed in the morning because or
changing weather conditions. or
course they tail to consider that
something like a windy rain
might alter the conditions late
in the atternoon. so things wel‘e~
n't equal anyway. it would make
the schedule less tight if the
rounds were begun in the morn—
ing, and it conditions were difv
ierent, tough, It's the way things
have to be done in other tour-
naments, why not ours?

Arter the ﬁrst nine holes,
South is ter in the lead with a
165 total, Ted Risser of South

The golf meet proved who were
the hardiest players, though;
while the college men were
hurrying off the course in the‘
rain, a group ot high school
girls were Just teeing on at [he
rirst hole.

At the beginning ot the soil-
ball season, each halt IM chair.
man was supposed to turn in a'
list of three men who would be
willing to umpire the games,
So far three halls, Clark, Raw—l
son, and North, have had a IUD-ll
nopoiy on otiicials. mostly be
cause the IM managers are in
these halls, THE Animal teels
that it a hall doesn‘t turnish
three men who are willing to,

points tor the sport, l

THE Animal also suggests that
umpires become well acquainted,
with the rules of softball beiore
they attempt to climate it,
would cut down the number ot
arguments at each game consid-t
orably.

Furthermore, prospective um»
pircs should be given or class in
the job they are going to do.
It they are going to be paid tor
the work, at least they should,
know their job., '
