'Cervene speaks ,
on modern art

in lecture series

5&3 stall Writer
By Jim Terrai

Richard Cervene (are) pre-
sented a lecturc lgst Friday in
Roberts Theater, entitled “Notes.
on Action painting." Cervcne'sl

.talk was the fourth in the
Board oi Religioll’s series,
Critique ot American Cultureﬂl

“The need to communicate,”
said Cervene, “has in all men
at all times been strong. neare
ly to the point of compulsion.
For the artist, the problem oi l
communication is relatively .
simple as long as he uses iair~ 1
1y conventional iornis and ‘
color combinations." ‘l

”In such a case, it is possible
for ll‘tc artist to communicate
with his audience‘” Cel’Vellel
said, “even if the latter Commits
the Sin of insensitivity, because
the canventlonai can appeal to
the inlellect." l

CERVENE POINTED o u t ,‘
however, that many artists to,
day consciously avoid the usei
ot iamiliar object and ordinary
colors. Theresult is that com—
munication is considerably more
diiiieult and quite olten it sim-l
ply does not take place, Car—i
vene laid the blame in this on
the public. “It is the responsi-
bility oi every’sensitive Observ-i
er,” he said, “to bring with:
him a certain degree oi ilexei
ibility." l

As viewers, we are apt to‘
make communication betwccni
ourselves and the artist impose‘
siblc by our very attempts to
intellectualize the content oi a
painting, he said. The way to_
abstract art is not, Cervene
said, through our intellect or
through an understanding oi
the historical background of a
painting. although both oi these
may occasionally be of
help.

soiiic‘

"The way to abstract art is
through an emotional reac-
tion between the painting and
the observers» In deiense oi
this emotional reaction, CCr- ‘
veno observed that ”emotion
can convince us to a point ‘
where, even without ii logical .
proof, we are willing to be-
lievei”

Cervcne then came to the res
cuc oi So~called Action Painting,
which derives its name irom
the “‘moritevigol‘oussthan-u s u a 1
methods" that its exponents enle
ploy in applying paint to can
vas. "It is the end product,"
he said, ”that should be approv-
ed, not thc technique." He went
on to point out that most Crilr
ics seem ignorant oi this point,

CURVENE CONCLUDED by
quoting Henry Miller ("Tropici
oi Cancer") who said that the
artist's problem is to had, in the‘
chaos around him. a personal-i
1y meaningiul order.

(Writer's note: In view or
the last .that Cervene was
lecturing in a series entitled
”A Critique oi American Culv
true" it may be pertinent to
point out that there was no

, explicit reiercnce to this point
in his ”Notes on Action Painte ,
ing.” Although oei-venc did
not. denounce art as “bad
poetry," liis iailure to adopt a

have been intended to rein ,
ioi-ce a point that Sheldon ‘
Zitner (English) made in the

weeks ago: that poetry is

sociologists gather evidence j

not misconstrue the context oi
