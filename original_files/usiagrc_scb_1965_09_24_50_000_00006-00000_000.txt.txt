Jean Vandervoort, past vice
president or the Students tor a
Democratic Society c h a p t e r,
urged participation in the project,
spoke of the need tor student come
niitinent, and said that a project
oi this kind was an excellent op-
pm‘lunity for students to see how
a political power structure works.

Nancy McCannon, as an 'anti-
note to the expression that the
Civil Rights Group never does
anything but talk, said, ”II you
Want to do something, work on
this project.”

Hampered by the fact that the
students are students and must at-
tend classes, the project workers
will be able to be in Des Memes
only Saturday and Sunday. Group
leaders said that the project prob-
ably would be conducted over
vacation periods.

Although the possibility oi stu-
dent demonstrations in Des Moines
was not ruled out, Karen Olson
said, "The emphasis in civil
rights in the North has changed a
great deal since the passage of
the civil rights law: therefore,
the problems are more subtle and
demonstrations are not necessar-
ily the most eﬂective way of
dealing with them."

Meg Bluhm, Cynthia Ernst, and
Jim Stephens, who attended Le-
Moyne College last year, told
those assembled about their ex-
periences as northern white col-
lege students attending a Negro

Baﬁleboard . .
. . . ll's Origins

“Oil Why do they call a Baf-
fleboard a Balileboard i . . 7'

it all started quite a long
time ago, according to former
Dean of Women Evelyn Gardr
her, when the collective body
or women house presidents
were called the League Board.
Back in those days, the room-
mates oi the League Board
started a sort of mock-league
Board of their own which tra<
ditionally met in secret at a tacub
iy home each year, for a party.
The secrecy of the party apparents
iy "battled" the League Board,
and the expression inspired the
mock<Leaguel Board to christen
themselves the “Baffleboard.”
(According to Miss Gardner, the
Baiileooard took great pleasure
in matching posted announce—
ments {or the League Board with
their own witty parodies of same.)

The name Baffleboard immedi<
ately became an unofficial tradh
tion, but for about fifteen years
after its debut it was mostly a
joke. Its members included only
the roommates of house presidents.
who were not included in the cone
stitution, and whose duties were
strictly unoiricial. Eventually,
however, ihe duties of the Baffle-
board came to be considered
worthy of oliicial constitutional
provision. Hence the establishment
of the present system requiring
the residence of two Bafﬂeboal‘d
members on every ﬂoor of every
women's hall.
