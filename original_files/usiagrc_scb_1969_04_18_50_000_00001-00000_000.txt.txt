Black Position Disputed

New left Panel Divided

By TED GLICK

"The enemy to all of us is the group
controlling the wealth of the world, and
this group doesn’t mind oppressing any-
one to maintain their power.” So spoke
Andrew Young, Executive Director of
the Southern Christian Leadership Con-
terence, in Herrick Chapel on Wednes<
day night.

Ernest Chambers, black militant from
Omaha, agreed with Young but was
cynical or any whites taking the steps
which he ielt necessary to achieve an
end to this oppression and exploitation.
in speaking of whites in the audience he
said, "if i were to get up and say you
should tight for tlle flag, [or A. T. Sc T.-
ror the United Fruit Company. you'd
be stonipln' and cheerin’ ”.

Chambers also [tell that Young’s belief
that those who are paying taxes are
thereby complying with the war in Vlet—
nam to be of little consequence to the
issue of “black liberation”. He said,
“How can you equate paying taxes with
being a Slaveholder?”.

in the question-and-answer session aft-
erwards, the main topic was the feasibil~
lty of Violence as opposed to non-violence
to achleve black freedom.

Chambers used the Bible to show that
the violence was not that of blacks but
rather that of whites. He said, “The

REV. ANDREW YOUNG, SCLC

Bible is like a two-edged sword — you
can use it to shackle us, but I can hand
it back to your . .The Bible is iull 01
blood and violence People who tell me
to be non-violent are the same ones who
put stock in the Bible.”

Young first stated that the use of the
word non-Violence was misleading. He
pi-eierred to use the term “unarmed
struggle" to refer to what is commonly
called non-violence. Young further be-
lieved that the issue of Violence and
"unarmed struggle" has been used to
divide the black community, He said,
"The talk of black violence has created
an atmosphere of repression The propa-
ganda oi the mass media has said that
it is the blacks that are violent, but lit-
reality it is the whites who are the vitr
lent ones.” He believed that this is evi-
dent in the white establishment’s swltt
reaction to any movement among blacks
addressing itselt to the issue or tree
dam from the slavery they have suffered
tor over 300 years.

The Wednesday night panel discussion
was part of this week’s Conference on
New Politicsi Thls afternoon at 4:15 Jer-
ry Rubin will speak, and at 8:00 tonight
I—lal Draper. of the magazine New Polb
tics, will give an address —- both talks
being so Herrick Chapel.

IN US FIRST MEETING, the Senate appointed a committee to screen appli-
cants for standing committees, and decided to put up a bulletin board in the post
oitice to uhlicize senate activities. They also appointed a committee to investigate

the possi

lily of general campus wide assemblies, and passed a resolution support-

ing the current petition regarding student attendance at faculty meetings.

‘Somebod Has to be Creative"

New Look to Senate

By ALICE ROGOFF

On Monday, April 14, approximately
66% of the student body cast their votes
and elected Lynn Aldrich, Andrew Brill,
Reggie Graham, Andy Loewi, Bill Thom~
as, Allen Hammond, Art Knowles, David
Broadwell, write-in candidates, have
Feldman, and Bill Stranger, as then“
new Senate.

The night before the Senate elections,
the candidates and about titty interested
students sprawled around the South
Lounge to exchange their Views. A clus-
ter of students surrounded each candi-
dale in an attempt to understand what
the role of the Senate could be.

Some oi the candidates suggested using
the Senate as a creative force to initiate
student interest; as a “sounding board";
or as a coordinating committee tor stu-
dent ideas. Many students questioned
how the amorphous aims tor student
participation and communication could
he changed into practical programs ol
action,

The candidates welcomed greater int
voivement in student government and
offered ways tn obtain it. Andy Loewi’s
approach would be “to go out and but-
tonhole people {or ideas." Bill Thomas
concluded that students want to be repre-

he represented about. Thomas felt that
“the Senate should serve as an lllim‘lliér
tion body to tell the student body what
they can do . Responsibility lies in
student attitudes; students have to be
made aware that they can go to the
Senate."

Proposed ways of improving communi-

cation between the student body and
the Senate included having Senators go
to hall meetings, open Senate meetings,
general assemblies, and the distribution
oi pamphlets with the questions to be
discussed at each Senate meeting before
the meeting it was generally tell. that
the Senate meetings need more publicity
to attract the attention and interest of
the student body.

Changes in both academic and hail
life were supported by the candidates.
Innovations that were discussed were a
noagrade Option, more student initiated
courses, more housing alternatives, and
inner college, and a counselling service,
It was hoped that academic life and hall
life could become more related to each
other by using residences for educational
projects. Andrew Brill summed up the

Air Force Undermines
Faculty Stand on ROTC

The Air Force recently announced
plans to discontinue ROTC at eight uni<
versities and colleges, Grlnnell included.
The minimum required Out-put of fifteen
officers had not been met at these
schools. The Air Force maintains that
this is due to lack of student interest
and denied that the Air Force is under
pressure irom anti-war groups or facility
members. The schools dispensing with
the program are: Butler University, Ins
dianapolis. lndiana, Capital University,
Columbus, Ohio, Illinois institute of
Technology, Chicago, Kenyon College,
Gambler, Ohio, Lawrence Universny oi
Wisconson. Appleton, Wisconsin. Tuits
University, Medlord, Massachusetts, and
Grinnell.

Despite the removal of ROTC ii-om sev.
eral campuses, 157 units remain on cam4
puses throughout the nation General
Westmoreland reported that Almy mid
is in demand and several new detach-
merits will be initiated within the nexl
year,

The decision of the Air Force com
tlicts slightly with the movement by
the faculty at Grinnell to discredit the
course. The committee headed by Mr.
Kissane, developed to consider the ad-
visabilicy of continuing the College's
contract with the AFROTC, wlll be dis«

the “phasing out” of the program. Thu
Air Force plans to withdraw by the
summer oi 1972, suspending enrollment
of new students as of September 1969.

The faculty voted to remove credit
from the ROTC unit in the fall of 1970.
A petition, signed by 445 students and
read at Monday's faculty meeting, re
quested iaculiy reconsideration of their.
decision to discredit ROTC. The petition
supported continuance of credit until the
detachment withdraws. This will allow
freshmen and sophomores now in the
program to complete the program With
credit. The faculty committee on Aem<
space will examine this possibility and
make recommendations to the iaculty.

would help assume this tnnction.

 

2 Students Attend Closed Meeting

Faculty Hears Case for Open Meetings

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The proposal that students be allowed
to attend faculty meetings was formally
presented to the faculty Monday after-
noon by Mike Brandon and Dan ClleiietZ,
representing the SGA. Before the meet-
ing, copies of their proposal Were dis-
tributed to each iaculty member, stat-
ing the reasons for the request.

Brandon and Cheitetz said they be-
lieved that students “should have the
opportunity to participate in the decision-
making processes that aiiect their edu<
cation and the college community of
which they are a segment.” They feel
that student presence at faculty meetings
“would not only improve communication
between faculty and students in matters
or mutual concern, but would also pro-
mote responsible student involvement ill
academic afiairs." Open meetings would
“insure the greatest degree of student

participation and faculty-student come
munication."

Instead of asking that all students
be able to attend these meetings. they
asked that at least the Council of Thin
teen (the Senate) be allowed to attend.
They also asked that the three student
presidents (C of HP, AWS, SGA) be al-
lowed to speak at the meetings. Brandon
explained that this was a “tactical man-
euver" employed because they felt the
iaculty would he more reluctant to admit
the whole student body, rather than a
small segment. They do not see this as
an “elitist" move, but rather a minimum
request, for they actually ieei that an
students should be allowed to observe
the meetings,

The matter was discussed at consider-
able length at the Monday meeting, but
no vote was taken. Another proposal
that would allow any student to attend
the meetings was also suggested by I
faculty member.
