ON THE RIGHT

by William

Now the son oi the gov»
ernnr oi New Jersey has
been arrested ior smoking pot,
and the son of the man who
aspires to be Governor of New
York In the latter case, it
transpires that two oi the eight
children have ”experimented”
with marijuana, A Congressman
informs me that. there is sudden
interest by the legislature in the
Koch Bill (which would set up
a presidential commission to
inquire scientiiically into the
eiiects oi the use at pot),
resulting iroin many
Congressmen’s having come to
know that their own sons and
daughters are taking pot. And,
oi course, the new crime bill,
which awaits action by the House
of Representatives. calls for
reducing the penalty tor smoking
pot , though by no means
elimiiiatiiigit.

How tempting it is to say
merely that pot should be
legalized That, for instance, Is
the recommendation of Mr.
Joseph Alsop, who comes back
from a viSit to Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and reports that
it is easier for a minor to obtain
marijuana than to obtain a bottle
oi beer One has merely to say
a) that the problem oi en-
[orcement is insuperable, and bl
that anyway, the doctors haven't
come up with any truly cone
vincing arguments that have to
do with the physical harm done
by the smoking ot marijuana ,
thcreiore, why not yield to three,
iiiajeiu-e, and maybe even enjoy
it?

F. Buckley, Jr.’

Those arguments are cogent,
but they pay iiisuiiicient ale
teniioii to the psychic dimension
oi the problem Here are three
examples.

A senior in college advises me
that a classmate in an adjacent
room, who in the ﬁrst two years
oi college liic participated ac-
tivcty in sports and journalism,
non smokes pot instead. 1 say
instead because the boy in
question smokes tour or iive
times a week, beginning shortly
otter dinner The potsmoker (or
certainly this particular one)
becomes thoroughly absorbed in
his euphoria, Alter while, he does
not readily comprehend the book
he is reading, which is in any
casca distraction: bettci- just the
pot, and the music. Now four or
live days in which you give over
to pot tour or live hours per day
oiyo‘ur time, means about twenty
hoiu-s per week in which you are
withdrawn from actual intellec»
lual, social, athletic, or extracur-
rieular activity. it is the opinion
of my friend that his friend has,
titract,cllanged.

Case number two is aliother
student who began his career as
a well integrated freshman, with
orderly and rewarding ties to the
principal institutions of the west
~ his family, his friends, his
country, his church. These are
now in shambles. He smokes pot
regularly , Post pot proptcr pot?

Case number three is two
young ealiiornians who were
active over several years in
political activity After a while
they began acting rathcr

strangely , the cmnpulsivcgbsen—
tires. the weir-doing of
politics, a sort or hippyization or
life in general Their friends and
their political iollowers began
quietly to express their concern
over the lackadaisieai and QC,
casionally iaiistical nature oi
thcir disposition. ch you
guessed it, they both smoke pot.

Now these could be coin-
cidental, let us hastily agree. But
our experience with pot isn’t
suiticient to permit us to know
whether it is or isn't. We are
living in an age when the
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare decrees that it is
dangerous to drink Tab Surely
in such an age that Secretary
owes us more than we are getting
about the psychic consequences
oiusingpot?

There are a lot oi people in
jail these days sentenced there
tor life, or tor ten or twenty
years. Prisoners have cooperated
beiorc in medical experiments
Why not get them to cooperate
in pot-smoking under ob-
servation? That would be a
standingroom only volunteer
project, needless to say. But
surcly trained psychiatrists and
clinicians, as also trained ob»
servers oi the prisoners on whom
the cxpcriments were conducted,
would give us a great deal oi
information without which we
cantiot speak intelligently? The
consumption or LSD, one hears,
Is down: because the kids
themselves came to know
something about the danger of
using LSD. But they simply do
not know the danger oi the other,
it there is a danger: which
danger, it appears, is psychic
rattler than biological. Couldn’t
the Koch Bill go iurtiier to urge
the use oi prisoners ior such
experiments?

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

Several times in the course of
the last year this column has sugr
ested that Senator Fred Harris,
whatever his personal merits,
“as not the man to be Chairman
of the Democratic National
Committee Tllclirst tlmeI made
this observation, former Vice
President l-lubert l-lumphrey took
strong exception and deiended
Harris with his characteristic
enthusiasm. Subsequently, as
recent newspaper inter-views
with Humphrey indicate, Harris
appears to have lost the cone
fldcnee of Ills initial patron. The
disastrous failure of the Miami
Beach “Gala Performance and
Ball” on February 5, which had
been billed as the biggest iunde
raiser in history and ended up
as a iiasco, would suggest that
Harris’ days are numbered.

In a rational world run by
logicians this would undoubtedly
be the case. But politics, to the
despair ci logical purists,
operates on somewhat different
premises which, by the way,
are not lacking in cold logic oi
their own, though it is oiten
concealed behind a smoke screen
oi diversionary rhetoric Right
now, while all hands protess
loyalty to the Party and the
D,N.C ,lhe Democrats are busily
implementing the enclave
theory. Local organizations are
desperately trying to deiend
themselves against\growing
Republican power; whatever
money they raise is put in the
pot tor the 1970 elections in their
own bailiwicks.

As far as the D.N.C. is
concerned, the word is out, “Who
needs it?" In addition, extremely
powerful elements oi the
Democratic coalition are quite
happy to leave Harris as the
trustee in bankruptcy. Efforts to
unseat him have been discussed,
but the general ieeling among
critics is that until at least 1971

tand possibly through 1974)
Harris is periectly qualitied to
be custodian of the $7 million debt
run up in 1968 Humphrey’s
generous gesture in suggesting
that the DN.C. should pick up
the tab in Eugene McCarthy’s
and Robert Kennedy's primary
expenscs was a major cause oi
disaiicction. As one Humphrey
stalwart put it, ”Whoever heard
oi putting the opposition on the
payrolli"

Not only does Harris have them
on the payroll, but in a burst oi
ecumenical zeal he appointed -
obviously with Humphrey’s
approval , a number oi the more
acerbic advocates of the “new
politics” to the Democratic
Advisory Council. This makes for
good clean fun - Ken Galbraith
is no mean entertainer, and
Gloria Stein does add a certain
decor - but it automatically
converts the D.A.C. into a
debating society. Serious
Democrats in 1970 can hardly
spend their time arguing whether
Senator Gale McGee’s defeat in
Wyoming (for supporting the war
in Vietnam) should be top
priority, They have no time to
spend for children’s games.

So the “Titanic” sails on, Fred
Harris at the helm, leaving
behind on the pier two vital
components iii any possible
Democratic majority: the loyal
Democrats from the South,
Southwest, and Border states
who are valiantly righting a two-
iront war against George
Wallace on one side and the
G.O,P. on the other, and the AFIr
CIO, which has taken a grim
reading or the iacts of political
lite and is preparing tor a siege.

From their vantage point.
these groups are fighting for
simple political survival. To
them the revolution that the
spokesmen oi the “new polities”
were heralding in 1968 has
already come , but from the
opposite direction, the right in-
stead oitheleit. The key question
is therelore not “Where do We
advance?” but “Can we hold?”
