New Church Service

By Nada Maniginletti

In an experiment to reverse the
diminishing size of me college
congregation, Reverend Haas
has turned over Sunday worship
service to the Students.

The first “self-service ser-
vice," last Sunday, replaced the
weekly choral concert with in-
iormal, group folk singing. Oh
fine, I thought, Nothing is more
vapid than a hip, withit, sugar-
coated, Christian service, But
when a heated discussion on the
meaning of communion replaced
the usual, soporific sermon, I
began to have second thoughts.
Some people emphasized the
worship of Christ in communion,
while others stressed the “good
feeling” at union and Comrades
ship among the congregation.
Still others denied any dichotomy
between the two. With the
problem yet unresolved, the ma-
jority of the Congregation sang
their way up to the altar to take
communion. For me, who ordir
narily sits through Sunday wor-
ship with my lower lip stuck out
as tar as possible, this com—
munion was a unique religious
experience

acting exercise primarily for the
beneﬁt olthe student actors. Last
Sunday's premiere of “The Play-
room" was indeed a demon
stration OI skillful directing and
acting. But to choose a play on
the basis of its suitability for
acting drills, to the exclusion of
its worth for a general audience
unwisef Acting exercises
should be conﬁned to acting
classes and workshops. A major
college production should he as
much for the entire college
audience as for the actors and
theatre majors.

”The Playroom,” a mildly in-
teresting, “well-made” melo-
drama, was not unlike an advens
lure story which might appear
on television on the evening
prime time slot. The plot was
fairly suspenseful; the character
development non-existent. This is
not to say that an audience
cannot enjoy such a play, any
more than a viewer cannot enjoy
prime time adventure stories.
But such an insigniﬁcant play.
has no lasting effect, either
positive or negative, on its
audience.
