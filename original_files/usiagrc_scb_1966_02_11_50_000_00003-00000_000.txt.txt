Contraceptive Muddie at Antioch;
Minnesota/s Dispensed ior Years

“There are a lot of Antioclnans
who don't know up irom down
about contraception, and a lot oi
girls are ending up pregnant," the
faculty member Said at an infor-
mal Antioch student meeting.
They were gathered to discuss
contraceptives and pregnancy in
View or the rising number or
pregnancies among Antioch girls.
Such a weekly discussion group
was organized informally since
Ohio state law forbids an official
birth control education program
or the providing of contraceptives
to students by the college clinici

since the report last tall or
Pembroke girls receiving birth
control information 1 rom the
Brown University Health Service,
many campuses have been exam-
ining their own practices with re-
gard to birth control information.
Universities seem to have a policy
of handling such cases individual-
ly and will give girls, who seek
it, iuiormation concerning birth
control. The health director at the

University of Minnesota said tiiat
birth control inlormatiou and pre-
scriptions have been passed out to
the Minnesota co—eds tor many
years without attracting atten<
tion. However, otticials at Mt.
Holyoke can do nothing in this
case since a Massachusetts state
law similar to the Ohio state law
forbids the distribution of contra-
ceptive devices or medication.
Computer Data

A Computer Date Night took
place two weeks ago at Carleton.
That Saturday morning men re-
ceived cards through the campus
mail, each with a number corres—
ponding to some girl. At an ap-
pointed ttme that night each man
was to give the dormitory tele-
phone girl his numbEr, And she
would summon the proper girl.

Although three-fourths of the
girls submitted applications, sixty<
iive boys remained unmatched.
As tar as is known. only three
steadily dating couples were re
matched by the computer. A very

 

tall freshman was matched with
a 5'4" girl because she lied about
her height, and there was the guy
who told the telephone girl, “it's
she’s twentyvone, tell her to bring

New Kind 0* College

A plan for student liie and ed-
ucational policy at the funire
Hampshire College has been draft-
ed by Amherst and Smith students
in response to their prolessors'
“The New College Plan."

The plan stressed a need for
unity or student lite and the edu-
cational process. The college
would be divided into five auton-
omous “villages; " e a c h would
function as both an educational
and a social centeri Seminars and
group courses would be taught
within the villages by iaculty
members assigned to each village
as student advisors. Close rela-
tionships could be expected to de-
develop between advisor and stu-
dents.

 

Ex-Prol Talks on Social Analysis

Protessor Muni Frumhartz, lor-
merly oi the sociology and anthro
pology department here at Grinr
Hell, and now at Carleton Univer-
sity in Ottawa, Canada, lectured
Monday night on “The Role of
Comparative Analysis in the So-
ctal Sciences." There was some
contusion at the beginning as to
what was going to be discussed.
and in attempting to get it cleared
up, everyone got more contused.

Once things were straightened
out, Professor Frumhartz exA
plained the process or compara-
live analysis, from the viewpoint
of the social scientist, as the use
or the logic or experimentation
Without the actual physical act. He
stated that since it is impossible
to create cultures containing a set
number of variables, one must at-
tempt tn find existing societies, or
societies that have existed in the
past, with a large number ot sim-
ilarities. In this way, the reasons
for their differences may be de-
duced. The major dilficlllty in
pertorming what the protessor
called “intellectual or mental ex-
periments" lies in finding these
alternate SDCieties.

Professor Frumhartz went on to
note that while the United States
is the nation that is most ad-
vanced in social science technique
and. as a result the most thor-

oughly studied, Canada, the nation
most similar to the us. socially,
politically, and economically, has
been practically ignored by Amer-
ican social scientists. The main

point or the lecture was the sug-
gestion that ditierences between
the two cultures, which are at
least as numerous as the similari-
ties, should be investigated. Pro-
iessor Frumhartz claimed that a
comparative analysis of these
points would help us understand
why our society has developed as
it has and provide some insight
into the directions it will take in
the future
