day, Get. 9, at. 4:15 pm., in
Younker Lounge. Students, (ace
ulty. and staff are invited to at

discussion led by members or
the Planning Committee.

Committee members include
John c. Dawson tcconomiesl,
James Kissatic tEitglislt), E. it.

and Merritt Ct Ludwig, tviee

Detailed floor plans or the
building are still in process ot
study aitd revision, according to
Ludwig, The basic a itecturai
design, however, has received
the Committee's appioval, and
will be considered by the col—
lcgc Trustees at their Oct. 15
meeting.

COST OF the two—level struc—
ture is tentatively estimated at
$800,000. Although the date tor
groundbreaking is as yet un-
determined, construction is ex-
pected to require about 15
months.

The present Student Union

site has been selected as the lo.
cation for the new building, and
plans are. underway to remodel
the “Little Theater"
Hall basement as a provisional
social center. The remodeled
space will later be used for so-
Cial and banquet occasions.

in developing a concept of
the student center’s purposes
and iunctions, the Committee
has taken into account iuturc

an overall Socialrrccl'eationalr

complex, though probably not
directly adiaceiit to the student

you?

Mei-rill Eckstciu: “I think tl-e
principle way the discussion

helped me to gain an insight
,into the varying opinions which
llhe students as individua‘s
held”

Margaret Brewer: “I think the
big trcshnien assemblies were or
very little value because they
just skimmed the topics. The
Ismail discussion groups wheic
,we discussed the books were of
:more value because the profess
lSDl'S probed the books and we
were given an opportunity to

Ann Pctcrsn : "The treshm o

of the conversations were moi

Bob Lanicr: “I got to knov

did not help me."

Rebecca Hi] "There wcie
