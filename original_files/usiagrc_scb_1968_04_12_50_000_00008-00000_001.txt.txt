THREE WINS WENT to Ric
Macoowell, senior, at last
week’s track meet The Pio‘
neers lost despite Macoow-
e I l ‘ s spectacular periorm-
once;

Carroll took the discus with
a toss ot 130-1, Evenson cap
tured the high jump at oz and
Abel Won the 220 in 22.5

Grinnell could take only one
second — Doug Dray's finish
in the twonnile run, Doug also
took third in the mile. Other
thirds were turned in by Thor
Evenson in the 440 intermedi«
ate hurdles and Bob Swortwood
in the pole vault.

Evenson also placed in the
120 high hurdles taking fourth
as did Carroll in the javelin
and Chuck Burns in the pole
vault.

The Pioneers were complete-
ly closed out in the shot put,
long jump, triple jump, 100
yard dash, 440, 440 yard relay
and the mile relay.

with only tour lettermen re-
turning on the entire track
Squad. Grinnell will be hard
pressed the maintain its record
or not finishing out of the Mid
west Conference’s first division
during the last eight years.

Three of the letterlnen are
involved in the distance or mid-
dle-distance events and new
coach Dick Walker has a great
lock or experienced manpower
in the hurdles, sprints and field
events,

Leader for the Pioneers is
Thor Evenson, who scored in
five events —— 440 intermediate
hurdles, high jump, pole vault,
long jump and 120 high hurdles
—and ran on relay teams a
year ago. Thor was conference
champion in the 440 intermedi-
ates and tied for third in the
high jump during the 1961
Championship Meet.

Evenson jumped 64 during an
indoor meet this winter and
looks like a sure bet to break
the school mark oi 64V2 set by
Kent Rogerson in 1961.

Four 1. M. championships were decided in the last two week-
belore Spring Vacation and how our athletes prepare to leap into
the softball wars as spring is about to spring (what a flair tor

words).

Smith clinched basketball as they closed out their season with
only two losses The Smith “B” team was the only quintet in

either section to go undefeated.

The Dibble "n” teens won their division as nibble captured

the second spot with a 155 mark.

East successiully detended its ping- pong championship but
was iorced to share it with South. Doug Gilbertson (East) defeated
Henry Wingate (Smith) 3-1 to retain his singles championship.
The South doubles team look first to lorge the first place tie.

I. M. howling was won by Dibble in a Walkaway as they shot
2,605 for me men to top second- place Cowles by 342 pins. Jolui
HoleIt (Dibble) had the high Series, a 565 Other high series'
were rolled by Rich Wickstrorrl (Rawson) 551, Bill Glay (Dibble)
542; Rick Klieihe (Cow 195) 533;M1ke Grant (Dibble) 521; Mikﬁ
Redd (East) 515- and Phil Jones (Cowles) 5116. The win made
Dibble the ﬁrst hall this year to capture thiee team sports.

I. M wmslling was predictably brutal but no one ngured
kay Mendel would have 20 stitches taken in his leg; or course,

he got these when hit by a car

Nonetheless they proved quite costly as he was forced to
forfeit his championship match and, hence, East edged Dibble by

In 0 points.

Notable champions were T J Smith (Gates) in the heavy-
weight division and long, lean Phil (Barrel- Bod) Woodward in the

180—190 Class.

There is a rumor going around campus that it is traditional
for warm weather to begin at this time of year The Senate,
however decided u-lis was incompatible with freedom as they
see it so while they are determining what kind of people we can
see, lhey are also dictating our weather ior us. A hearty
thanks for protecting our interests.
