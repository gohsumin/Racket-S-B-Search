Scarlet Fever

by Len Calodney
Although idle, Grillnell remained at the top of the
heap of Iowa. college basketbifll teams with a 10-1 record.
The Pioneers’ closest competitor for number 1 honors was
Buena Vista College sporting a 14-2 mark. l

 

 

Peter Enell’s (New Zealand) 3:544 mile and John
Uelses’ (Quantico Marines) 15—10 1/4 effort in the pole
vault are both new records which far surpass two of
track’s “impossibles,” the {minute mile and 15 ft. pole
vault.

Both new records show what a little competition, hard
work and desire can do for an athlete. Snell bettered hisi
previous best time by 6.8 sec. and Uelses upped his formerl
top pioduction by 3-3/4". It is men like Uelses that keep
sportsmen from predicting the impossability of the 16 ft.i‘
pole vault mark. .

 

A . 'eat deal of credit and congratulations are duerI

to Jackie Robinson because of his recent election to base-i
hall's Hall of Fame. It is good to know that the man who i
made our national sport one that truly represents all 1
Americans in now an immortal part of the game. Robin—
son would get many people’s note for the greatest show
of courage over the past two decades. l
Frank Lane, former major league baseball g'elierall
manager, has added his two-cents worth to the feud be-l
tween baseball and football over which is the No. 1 sport?
He sees football’s increased attendence due only to the factil
that it is played once a week, while baseball is played on;
four consecutive days in one city, yet still drawing welli

But it appears to me that Lane, along with all the; '

others involved in the controversy, have overlooked one!
important fact, that the two sports 2 e not competitors.
The only conclusion one can draw from all the nonsense>
is that in their respective seasons, each one ranks at the‘

The Wooden Goat, famed prize for the winner of the‘
St. Olaf-Carleton intra~city basketball rivalry, was again
retained by the Oles, who have held it since the 195859
season, Tile two teams split the games of the series, but
it would have taken a double victory by Carleton to snatch
the trophy away from their Ell‘Clll’lVZilS.
