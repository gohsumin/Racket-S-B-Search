J/Lcé‘imattc ﬂoat

By Henry Scheff

At a mass‘meeting attended
by some 250'students Tuesday
night in-Roberts Theatre,
the Grinnell Student Senate
passed _.a resolution endorsing
the basic philosophy of the
Student Positiori' Paper. The
students at the rneeting'elected
a six»man steering committee
to sort‘ through amendments
and to Inlake recommendations
at an open ’h—leeting next week.
After the senate has acted on
the amendments, the Position
Paper will be submitted to the
student body for an all-campus
referendum.

The six members elected to
the steering committee are
Phil Mears, Bill -Stranger,
“Gene” Prewo (who impressed
the meeting with his incisive
criticisms), Steve Schwartz,
Bruce Nissen, and Mick
Schaalman. Specifically, they
have the following powers:

1) They will divide the
amendments into two groups,
substantive amendments and
“nit - picking” amendments.
They will make block recom»
mendations on tihe "nit-
pickers” to the Senate,
moving that they accept the
amendments that they feel ap-
propriate and reject the others.
Then, the Senate will consider
the substantive amendments
one at a time for approval.

2) They will have immediate
negotiating and discussion
power and authority, so that
they may meet with adminis-
trators and faculty without
delay. There are many areas
of college governance that the
student body is ignorant of,
and this committee can begin
to work on these matters. The
faculty and administration are
anxious to begin discussions
with the students.

The steering committee will
also have the duty of informing
the student body of the sub-
stance of the discussions that
ﬂiey will be carrying out with
the administration and faculty.
This liaison function is crucial
to maintaining student interest
and support for the issues
raised by the Position Paper.

A number of suggestions and
amendments were made at the
beginning of the meeting, but
basically only a couple of im-
portant things were cleared
up. The preamble will be
“cleaned up” by the steering
committee because it is gram-
matically weak. The wording
of one sentence was changed,
and more will probably be
done. The essence of the pre
amble is at this date un-
changed.

The most important debate
of the meeting concerned the
necessity of including Section I
of the Proposals for Structural
Change, the creation of the Co
ordinating Council of the Col-
lege. Gene Prewo argued that
if the purpose of the paper
was to democratize or decen-
tralize the decisionrmaking
power of the college, then the
proposed Coordinating Council
was inconsistent with this phil-
osophy, and it ought to be
eliminated.

Bruce Nissen was sympa-
thetic to Frewo’s argument,
but he felt that the student-

faculty-administration commit-
tee was needed at the top as
a check on President Leggett,
who legally has the final pow.
er in college decisions.

Tom Thomas pointed out
that the Council as proposed
did not wield very much pow-
er; it could make recommen-
dations and had veto power
which could be overturned by
a two-thirds vote.

The students at the meeting
felt that the advantages of hav-
ing a Coordinating Council out-
weighed the disadvantages,
and voted to keep Section I
as part of the proposed docu-
ment.

There were several impor-
tant amendments to the section
on the All-Campus Judicial
Council, Section IV, Part C,
Number 3, '(Procedures)
clauses “d" and “er” Clause
“d” was amended to state that
written records of Judicial
Council proceedings shall be
kept, and the defendant has
the option of having his name
on the record or not. The ra-
tionale for this is that the
council needs records of all
cases to establish clear prece-
dents, but should still protect
the individual from further
harassment due to any punish-
ment that he may have re-
ceived from the Council,

Clause ”e” was amended to
clarify the fact that the
President in appeal cases does
not have the power to increase
punishment. He may uphold
the Judicial Council decision,
lighten the punishment, or dis-
miss punishment completely if
he so desires, at his own dis-
cretion.

If any student has amendr
ments to the document, submit
them immediately if not soon
er to one of the members of
the steering committee, Come
to the next couple of senate
meetings if you are interested
in what happens to the amend-
mentsi When the referendum
is announced. study the amend-
ed document carefully and
then vote. Power to the people!

The senate has gotten into
the habit of holding quicky
meetings before the large Stu-
dent Body meetings, and Tues»
day’s meeting was no excep-
tion. The senate Tuesday acted
on a number of important
matters. First, the Senate al-
lotted an additional 550 for the
Conspiracy 8. Contribu-
tions were rather poor during
John Froines' Visit, totaling
maybe $100. The PPPE was
expected to kick in another
$100 to help defray costs, but
for some reason the PPFE de-
cided that this was not an ap-
propriate way to use their
money.

The Senate had originally al-
located $150 from the speakers
fund. With the extra $50, that
gives the Conspiracy about
$300, out of which they had
to pay Froines‘ expenses. Con-
'sidering the importance of the
trial. this “outpouring" was
pathetic indeed. Only $100 in
direct contributions” although,
as Froines so painfully stated.
we are all on trial in Chicago.

Senator Dave Eroadwell
submitted a motion to strike
the controversial “implicit sup

was passed last week, in a

Weston Denies Kickback Rumors

Gadabouis Chairman Ernest
T. Weston Tuesday denied alle-
gations that he received kickr
backs from the T.S.Ui Tora-
nadoes following their per-
formance at the Homecoming
Dance, Oct. 18.

“The idea that I got money

Students voted overwhelming

ly Tuesday to have a rock band
at the spring dance next
semester.

Final results of a preference
poll taken at lunch lines by the
Social Coordinating Committee
were: Rock-353; Soulr74; Big

from them is completely false,"
said Weston. “The only money
I have received this year is

my first semester salary as
Gadabouts Chairman. The Gadr
abouts Chairman is responsibile
for only one event during the
first semester, Homecoming,
and since that is over, I wrote
the check for my salary.”

The charges of kickbacks
were raised last week by
several students dissatisfied
with the cost of the Home
coming dance. The Student
Coordinator’s office is current-
ly investigating the charges.

being asked to write on a post-
card in 25 words or less why
they are against the war. These
postcards Will then be sent in
bulk to the Moratorium office
in Washington, D.C., where they
will be sent to the White House.

Plans for today included
continued canvassing of the
town and a scheduled collection
of garbage around Lake Nyanza
Park on the south edge of town.
Evidently some townspeople
suggested the action as a
means of improving campus-
community relations, and the
Moratorium Committee felt it
would be in keeping with the
aim of the Moratorium. Its
aim, expressed in a statement
released Wednesday, “is to di-
rect our energy into the com
munity.”

That statement further ems
phasized that the Moratorium
is to be an individual commit-
ment, and not an attempt to
close down the institution of
Grinnell college “simply for
the sake of shutting it down.”

Class attendance seemed
markedly decreased Thursday
morning, but to what degree
“business as usual” was halted
is impossible to determine.
Asked to estimate how many
professors held classes
yesterday, Dean Joseph F. Wall
replied, “I have no idea.”

Moratorium days were not
business as usual, however, for
an estimated 80 Grinnell stu-
dents who went to Washington
for the “March Against Death,”
nor for another 46 students who
went to Des Moines last night
to picket a speech by Vice
President Spiro Agnew.
