“ Discuss Purpose.

Tu the Editor:

We have just returned from the
March in Washington to end the
war in Viet Nam sponsored by Stu~

dents for a Democratic Society.
Riding the long bus trip with us
were concerned people troni vari—
ails areas o1 iowa and Nebraska.
Tile bus was not tilled because of
student apathy and because people
dropped out without warning less
than five hours beiore the bus
was to depart; and therefore, a
number or students who were go-
ing to Washington tor other rea-
sons were accepted.

In Washington we oined with
20.000 (ligure quoted in the Wash.
ington Post), other students and
adults to protest United states
policy in Viet Nam. The march
was not intended to propose any
particular long—range solution, but
rather to express our discontent
with the perilous immediate situa—
tion and to encourage negotiations.

president Johnson, in his John

Stance of Protest

Hopkins speech, stated that he was
willing to negotiate unconditional-
ly with North and South Viet Noni.
At the same time, however, he
stepped up our bombings of North
Viet Nam producing conditions
definitely not conducive to iiogotia»
tions, Furthermore, his offer to
negotiate should have been made
as well to the National Liberation
Front (against whom we are tight
ing),

By the slogan of the march ”end
the war in Viet Nam,” we do not
mean. unconditional withdrawal.
,We desire a cease-fire and the tics
sihle neutralization of Viet Nam,
and free elections under the aus-
pices of the United Nations. we
cannot realize the goal oi having
a tree selldetermining Viet Nam
by ravaging its countryside with
bonnhs, napalm, and all oi the oth-
er instruments of war.

b—Marchers Mostly

(Continued trom Page 1)

there were a lot of people
there; enough to spread over
(the width of the entire 16 block
mall between the Washington
Monument and the Capitol
Building.

A majority or the crowd were
college students, many of whom
had traveled all night to ar-
rive on Saturday morning and
others who had liitchehiked
il’Dln such distances as Iowa
and Nebraska.

Groups represented various
SchoolsiOberlln, Duke, Harv-
ard, McGill, University of 0k-
]alloma, Berkeley, and Univer-
sity of Toronto. Many civil
rights workers from Mississippi
and Alabama who had been in
Washington tor conlei-ences the
day before participated in the
march, A iew high schools
were represented.

Most newspapers ignored the
fact that adults made up at
least onethird oi the group.

Students

The Women’s Strike for Peace
brought two special trains and
several busloads of people from
New York. Various unions
identified themselves With ban-
ners as did teachers’ and farm
organizations. Also in the crowd
were college professors, cler-
gymen, local residents with
their families and sympathetic
tourists,

Tile crowd picketed the White
House in the morning, then
marched to the Sylvan Theater,
behlnd the Washington Monu~
ment, for a rally in the after-
noon. Guest speakers were I,
F. Stone, editor of I. F. Stone’s
Weekly, and Sen. Ernest Gruela
ing (D., Alaska). Stone de.
nounced the fact that the na-
non is expected to consent
lblindly to administration deci-
lslons on Viet Nam.

RoberL Moses, spokesman
tor the civil rights movement
in Mississippi, also addressed
the group.

Moses related injustice in the
South to the continuing war in
Viet Nam. He suggested that
those who deliberately plan and
execute murders of Negroes
and civil rights workers are
not moral idiots, but products
of a society which condones
bombing and killing in accord-
ance with a policy which is ill-
defined and the appropriate-
ness of which is dubious.

Interspersed between the
speeches was entertainment by
Judy Collins, Joan Baez, Phil

 

Ochs, and the Freedom Voices.

Noone spoke to Grinllell students

”We can be tough because they
can't say ‘we won’t vote (or you
at the next UN. meeting’ or ‘you
can't land your planes on my
soil'," Noone said.

The World Bank loans money to
countries at low 0!‘ no interest. The
money is used for development or
the country. Tlie‘ bank's “tough-
ness" has resulted in it being
hailed as a great success in ‘aidlng
thc underdeveloped countries of the
world.

Said Noone about aiding under-
developed countries:

“For a long time the word de-
velopment and industrialization
have been synonymous. The pro-
