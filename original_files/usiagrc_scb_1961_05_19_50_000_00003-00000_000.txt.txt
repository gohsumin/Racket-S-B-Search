LETTERS

Cont, from p 2

Communists condemned, but for
mer Communists must suffer for
their past — unless they actively
turn against their onetime asso—
ciates. And the ostracism or pun—
ishment extends to those who,
though not party members, agree
with some of the party’s pro—l
gram, or will not expressly disso—l
ciate themselves from the pre—
scribed group, Accordingly, a
person of liberal views is often
impelled to say “but I am no
Communist," forgetting .that he
is thus reenforcing the biased
feeling of others.

it is surely unnecessary e es—
pecially after Professor Eurkle’s
sermon — to say much about the
harm which this blanket condem~
nation does to our foreign policy,

What are some outstanding fear

,tures of states which proclaim
themselves communistic? There
is in them very little opportunity
for wealth to give a man or a,
group control over the lives oil
others. The state is generous in
educating the most able. To be‘
sure, “ability” often includes ac—l
ceptance of the nation’s political
system (as those receiving gov—
ernment fellowships here are ‘
screened as to their associations),
and education is. in part, distorte,
ed by partisan bias. Medical carel
depends far less on ability to payl
than with us There is but onc
party, elections are meaningless
(but we should learn more aboutl
popular influence on the choice
of candidates). Religion is dis
couraged.

Practices of communist coun—
tries are such a mixture of those
we admire and those we detest
that a discerning person will call
himself neither pro—nor—amlr
communist. He will, however, see
that undiscriminating hostility is
almost sure to reentorce those
features which we should like to
see disappear,
