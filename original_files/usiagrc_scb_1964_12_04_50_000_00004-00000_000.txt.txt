if Carl Otis Gray

This week I again call time out
no continue with a general hodge-
podge of digression and what not
Before beginning to continue, I
would like to thank Mr. William
I-lazelton oi Alexandria, Virginia
for his warm hospitality in extend»
my to me an invitation for Spring
.Vacation. I have accepted this in-
vitation tentatively, until my pass
port into Virginia is cleared

I would like to call your atten-
tion to a movie that will soon be
playing at our neighborhood thea-
tre, “One Potato," TWO Potato.”
This clearly is a rnone that has
been aimed at your lacrymal
glands and does indeed, hit the
target. With a relatively undistin—
guished cast, it manages to kill
the sacred cow of racial intermar-
riage Lhroughon unescapable ap-
peal to the emotions. No believer
in God, country and American
motherhood can remain unmoved.
The little blond coed sitting in back
of me in the Minneapolis theatre
where I saw the movie, gave me a
little hope that there was really
an America as she moaned softly
to her equally blond date, “Poor
Sammy Davis.”

For those of you out there who
are wondering why yours truly has
not joined the Grinnell Civil Rights

 

Shades of Gray.

Group: it; is not, as was rumored,
that I did not have the fifty cents
membership dues. The facts are
that I consider it totally ineffective.

There are many reasons for my
belief: 1) Although in the past and
present the officers of this group
have exhibited good judgment, i
feel that alliance with an organi-
zation such as the NAACP neces-
sarily limits the activity of the
group, 2) Since we are in Iowa —
rather, since we are in Grinnell—
the racial problem, by virtue of
the dearth of local persons of color,
is nonexistent, 3) Voter registra-
tion trips to Des Moines have not
proved to be anything more than
Saturday excursions .tor civic
minded matrons. 4) Campus speak-
ers on Civil Rights, sponsored by
the GGRG this year have been few,
in fact, none.

Now then, let's examine these
one by one, in order to clear up
any misconceptions Mr. Burnham
and his entourage may arrive at
otter reading'Gray’s 4 theses

Firstly, like it or not, the

NAACP represents the must con-'

servative 'of all the major civil
rights groups (The Urban League
and the Black Muslims are OUT).
Its conservatism is manifested
mainly in its reliance on cuurt
cases and legal procedures. These
in themselves'are well and good,

SCARLET ,AND BLACK

And Furthermore

there is a place {or them - not
here.

As students, it would seem that
we would naturally'lall into the
category of “flaming romanticists"
and reel a bit hampered by the per-
haps middle-aged moderate mud<
eratlon offered by this group. SNCC
and CORE represent what I believe
to be student thought. steeped in
mid-westernism though we are, l
believe that as students the words
“action” and “demonstration”
should have an uncontrollable ap-
peal to us.

Next, although we are limited by
our environment as to the extent
of our activities, a more active
role in a more active organization
would open new doors. A test case
here and there, a letter writing
campaign, {and raising drives
might prove to he more lruitlul
than registering white Republicans
in Des Moines.

Finally, a more extensive PR
campaign with speakers and pub-
licity galore, not only on campus
but in town. For example, after
numerous incidents the clientele
of the Dixie Inn might benefit
from a few lessons in them” of
Americanism,

Thus, Grinneil’s highest unpaid
professional Negro puts in his bid
tor the presidency’ot next year's
version of the GCRG—that is if he
can dig up titty cents to join it.
