NSA Congress—Lari lll

, One of the maior problems}
that currently faces the Unitcd‘
States National Student ASSOCiar
tion is the lack of contact, co-op.
eration, and cowrdinallon be.
tween the member college and
the region, and more serious, be“
tween the region and nationall
office.

The problem is especially acute
in the IowarNcbI‘aska region,
The reasons are varied: (1) pasli
officers have been very inactive
and uninterested in. the region‘s
progress, and (2) the region it,
self lacks interest and activities,
due to the number and type ol
schools affiliated with USNSA.

For the 1961762 school year a;
new type of regional program rel,
being initiated by the member‘

 

schools of the IcowEl-I\Iel)l"dska~
Region eniitled “Operation Ops
pol‘tuniliy." Originally it was

planned as an Iowa—centered re-‘
search program that would study
the question: Why do 50 per centl,
of the young men and women bee]
tween the ages of 18 and 35 leave
the state of Iowa. This program
has, ,already received a grant
from the Iowa Development
Commission to cover the costs‘
of conducting such a study and
also the holding of a regional
meeting concerning the finding.
of the, study.

However, Grinnell’s part in
the program is unique. Due to
the fact that Grinncll and
Drake University have large
out of state populations, the
program has been broadened to
provide Grinnell with that
chance to conduct local investi»
gation on problems that con-
cern the entire nation.

Orinnell may choose to inves—
tigate racial discrimination Ite-
cent events have indicated that
such discrimination is not unique_
to the South, Grinnell wouldl
conduct a study to\disco\ler~ii
discrimination does exist in eats
mg places, barber shops, sleepil
ing facilities, etc., in Iowa. ‘

In addition, the study of racial‘
discrimination in Iowa would
also be of interest to the state
government, At the present time
there is a law that declares raciall
discrimination unlawful in the
state of Iowa.

The commission that is set up‘
to carry out this law is under-

, staffed and consequently can
conduct investigation in only the
larger cities. It is readily evi—
dent that a report concerningl
discrimination in the smaller;
towns of the state would be read
with great interest by the Come,
mission,

The results of the study wouldl
be included in the regional re—
port and would also serve as re—
search information for commit
tees on racial discrimination at
the national congress of USNSA,

Two very important aspects o
the program. must be stressed
First, the choice of topics to
study is unlimited. Examples in-i
elude the migrant farm labor
problem in Iowa. the situation
concerning public housing and
the previously mentioned racial
discrimination question.

The second aspect of the pro-
gram is that it is designed to

PPESIONS

Felluw freshmen:

The president of this freshmen class will be con—
fronted with two important responsibil' ies. First, he
will represent the entire class in the Grinnell student
Senate, and second, he will have the task of stifrtulat-
ing the development of class productivity and unity\

Every candidate, as a potential officerWhas a re—
sponsibility to familiarize himself with the office and
the campus issues with which he will be required to
deal. This I have attempted to do by exploring the ,
issues now before the senate and by discussing them
with the s. G, A. president and a number of senators.
Thus, I feel prepared to represent our class in a sena—
torial capacity. _ _

Each of us must ask himself certain questions con<
ccrning class productivity and unity-What can we do
for the college?.What can Grinnell do for us? What can
we do for ourselves? ' '

' It is traditional and appropriate that each freshman
class undertake a. project which will load toward _an
adequate answer to these questions, In a discussion with
an upperclassman who has organized a freshman class
project (in this case to raise money to bring a foreign
student to Grinnell), I found that far too often a proiect
such as this results in an accumulation of work on a
few individuals, rather than being truly the response
of the entire class. Obviously, this freshman proicct
needs a fresh outlook, _ _ ‘

Soon the student Senate will be discussing the my
stitution of a program toward the development of an
better place to begin than with the incoming freshman
“honor code" system at Grinnell. I feel that there is no
class. This would be a worthwhile and stimulating class
project, and would benefit the college, the class, and
each of us as individuals. . -

The freshman orientation program has been the

-siibject of much criticism and discussion in many cir—
cles. Some of the aspects which require detailed study
this year by all of us, especially by the leaders of the
freshman class, are: -

1. Tire test required of women students upon cam-

pletioii of the program. . _

The notable lack of freshman representation _

especially for the men students _ in the Stun
dcnt Senate.

3. The rather high schoolish organization and pre-

sentation of orientation lectures, ‘

I have definite suggestions to improve this program,
one of which is specifically designed to give freshman
more signifignnce in student government. I plan to pre—
sent these programs at the mass meeting- Sunday‘ eve—

iiin .

gEvery freshman should attend this meeting and _
consider carefully the platform of every candidate so
that a wise choice can he made. This is your responsi—

hility.

Sincerely, ‘
Jack Hurwitz
