will be a person whom I can work with,
Whom the Senate can work with, who
will represent the ideas of the Senate."
He also stated, “I don't want the power
or the Finance Committee this year to
be like it was last year."

The Publications Committee has chos<
en Mike Brandon as editor of the 33:3
and has named Paul Lewis, Marshall
Barber, Marian Race, Peggy Morrison
and John Ellmore to the executive bDard
of the radio station. The editors of
Nous and the Cyclone have not been
chosen yet.

Most decisions about next year's puh<
llcations will be made after this year’s
Cyclone comes out. The enthusiasm at
student response to the Cyclone will de-
termine its late. There is the possibility
that the Cyclone will be discontinued
and the money that previously was tund-
ed to it will be transferred to Nous.
Another possibility is that Nous will be-
come a 16-page supplement to the 58d!
it the Cyclone is continued. In this case,
Nous would be distributed to all stu-
dents, although not necessarily with the
53:1].

The committee has approved a "state-
ment or policies and procedures for
student publications and radio." Thil
statement was written to implement a
iaculty mandate expressing the facul-
ty's conception oi the function oi the

tee’s statement will serve as a sourco
oi reference concerning structure and
procedures. It outlines the duties at the
publisher, editor and broadcaster and
the Committee's external control at

By JONATHAN STEIN

The book store committee is almost
ready to give their iinal recommenda-
(ions concerning next year's Bookstore.
The committee, comprised oi Mr. Moore,
Mr. Parslnnen, Mr. Muchmote, Mark
Kass, Henry Scheft, and Jonathan Stein
will make the following proposals.

The College should conceive of the
Bookstore as a service to the college
community. There is no place within 50
miles of Grinneil where quality books
and periodicals can be purchased and
access to quality books and periodicals
is essential to a liberal arts education,
It is obvious that the college can never
have an adequate Bookstore in the space
now allocated. The women's Gym, when
available and properly renovated, will be
ideal. Until the Gym in available. tha
Bookstore should be located in one oi
the vacant ﬂoors in the oiiice building:
on 5th street.

We are aware that this temporary lo-
cation will be somewhat inconvenient,
but the need of a good Bookstore is so
urgent that the temporary inconvenience
is more than onset by the availability oi
adequate space. .

The committee also will recommend
that texts required for college courses
be distributed irom behind the counter
at a special center on campus. Prear-
ranged bundles of books for Each course
should be made up in advance to speed
up the distribution. It would also he pos-
sible to buy any book singly at the center
but considering that the majority oi stu~
dents buy their books at one time this

plan would speed up the entire operas
tioil.

This plan would be more convenient
ior students, since there would be less
crowding, searching for books, standing
in line with heavy loads, etc. and should
cut down considerably on thettr This
special distribution center would be open
for the first two or three weeks of each
semester; alter this time a few copies
of each text would be kept in the Book-
store for late purchases.

The committee will also recommend
that there should be a standing com-
mittee, probably three faculty and thre-
students, to work with the Bookstore
manager on stocking books and mater-
ials.

The committee strongly recommends
that any student should be able to order
any book at any time through the book-
store. Such is not the case at the present
time.

Quality magazines and periodicals da-
ilnltely belong in tha bookstore.

Students should be hired when opening:
are available in bookstore personnel.

Used books, new and used records.
posters, prints, and art materials will
hopefully be included in the new book»-
store.

The Committee emphasizes the need
for a quality bookstore that will be an
integral part or the intellectual environ-
ment of Grinnell College.

The need for a better bookstore has
existed too long. It is hoped that the ad-
ministration will give the matter top pri-
ority so that R quality bookstore will be
a reality in September.
