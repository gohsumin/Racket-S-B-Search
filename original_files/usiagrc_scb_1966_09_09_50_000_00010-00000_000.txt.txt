no one I think that each lib<

ill have to answer in its own

available to it. It is here that

is only by the combined inter-

faculty and administrative staff
working eiieciively together for
the common goal or educational
excellence that will give vital-

Bigness is no virtue unless

laboratory equipment and not
just in the quantity ot student

VIRGIN (A’s..-

Wisconsin and a few other
large state universities, how.
ever, have known how to uti-
lize bigness so that it has corp
tributed to educational excel-
lence.

we who as iacully, students
or administrators at Grinnell
College have committed our
talents and/or a sizable part
of our tather's salary check to
the small liberal arts college
must in the same way try to
utilize our smallness so that lt
may contribute to educational
excellence more effectively
and imaginatively than we
have so far done.

Or I could cite the example,
last tail, of an attempt upon
the part or some students to
establish several small dISCuS<
sion groups to deal with the
Viet Nam question in which in
each group there would be
joint participation oi students
and iaculty representing sever-
al different areas of concentra
tion. This was an excn‘lng idea,
for we were to deal with the
most pressing and controvers-
slal issue on the contemporary
scene in a far more education
ally constructive manner than
by picket lines or armbands,
however sympathetic i may be
to those terms or protest. The
groups were iormed. an elabor-
ate bibliography was compiled,
but then the faculty members
became involved in their regu-
Iar teaching assignments and
committee duties, the students
tound themselves irantically
caught up in the regular roue
tine oi papers, lab reports and
examinations. There was no
one to push the proiect, and an
important educational idea
died aborning.

In short. we have not eliec~
tively and imaginatively made
use of our smallness to my
mate a liberal arts education.
Our failure is not for want of
ideas. Pi-oiessor Magee has tor
the last year and a halt pro
moled the idea of inter < dis-
ciplinary seminars in which at
least two iaculty members,
representing dlflerent dis -
pliiies, would conduct a semb
nar for from ten to iitteen up<
perclass students on such top-

Some people say iliey wouldn't
walk across his sheet on our pix-
Ia. Others say ilrey wouldn‘t even
go to lheir lounges for it But you

don't have to H we‘ll deliver to

ice as existentialism, race rela-
tions, or the problems or new
developing nations in which
an inter-disciplinary approach
would quite obviously be the
most eifectlve devise for deals
ing wrth the subject matter.
Faculty members participating
in these joint seminars would,
of course, receive full teaching
credit for their participation.
Protessor Alan Jones, recently
returned irom the University or
Sussex, has proposed to me the
possibility ol combining the
traditional American class-
room and the British tutorial
situation by which experimenta-
tion and variety could he intro«
duced into the routine semester
course as it now exists.

“Grinnell, our catalogue says
and in italics so that it cannot
be missed, “is a small col-
lege." But smallness, as Presi-
dent Leggett has said, is no
virtue in itself. There is Very
little educational signiiicance
in having only lzoo as opposed
to 2000 soudents on a college
campus. But smallness does
begin to acquire educational
signiﬁcance it we can say that
there are never more than
twenty students in a single
class section

What my colleagues and I
are suggesting is, of course,
expensive education, but Grim
neli is already expensive, We
would I think find it easier to
justify a somewhat higher tui-
tion than the present already
high tuition. it by so doing we
could more effectively utilize
the community lhat is the col—
lege with all oi its possibilities
for experimentation and the ex-
change of ideas.

Finally, as an essential part
of this idea of communitas is
the necessity for an accurate.
rair and even critical presenta»
tion to our alumni and to the
world at large through the
various publication media of
the college as to what we are
doing at the college now, and
what our plans and aspirations
for the iuture may be. This
requires the closest kind or
cooperation between students,
faculty and administrative
start. Our respective hopes and

goals for this college are not,
1 think, as different and con-
tradictory as they sometimes
appear when we compare loi-
example. what appears in the
regular student SEtB with what
appears in the Alumni 5&3.
This college, like all colleges,
is more than a place, a
physical envrronment it is es<
sentially an idea — the idea
of educational excellence that
is held in common by all who
serve it in whatever capacity.
And it is the particular tomi pt
that idea as it continues to de-
velop here that we are seeking
to express to borers. Certainly
