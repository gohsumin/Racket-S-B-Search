SCARLET AND BLACK

 

House Cleaning»-

The Scarlet & Black is cleaning house. The de-
arture of the former editor calls for a reassessment of
.he S&B role. This reassessment cannot be completed
until the Board of Student Publications names its
choice for new editor. In the meantime, however, sev-
eral things seem clear.

First, the 5&3 should continue to be a radical
voice in the Grinnell community. It should not be
afraid to step on the toes of administration and faculty,
and it should also be prepared to step on student toes.
The 5&3 editor and his staff members have access to
more information about all aspects of the campus than
any other group or individual. They should be pre-
pared to use this information to expose weaknesses
and promote strength throughout the community

Second, the S&B should become a responsible
voice in the community. Muckraking is sometimes
necessary, but it can only be effective if the community
has confidence in the reliability and honesty of the
8&3. Too often in the past the 58:8 has found itself in
the role of the little boy who cried wolf. To overcome
this role, the 5&3 must strive for accuracy and techni-
cal strength, not sensationalism.

Finally, the 58:3 staff should not be a social
clique. Much about the nature of the S&B’s operation
tends to foster a tightly knit staff. Nevertheless, in so
far as it is technically feasible the S&B should be sup-

orted by a large staff of interested students. It is up
0 the S&B leadership to encourage widespread par-
ti ipation in the production of the paper; it is up to
the student body to be ready to spend time and effort
to make the S&B a strong voice in the community,

These three areas, radicalism, responsibility and
participation, seem from this viewpoint to be the most
vital concerns of the S&B in the semester ahead. They
have been sketched only broadly above. Hopefully,
circumstances will make it possible to expand on them
in the weeks to come. The first step must come Sunday
night at the first staff meeting of the year. The im-
portance of this meeting and the evidence of student
support which the attendance will show cannot be
stressed too heavily. If you care about the future of the
Scarlet & Black and are willing to devote time and of»
fort to its success, you will be in the S&B office at 8:30
pm. tomorrow.

“The cops also smashed a TV
camera and tried tu take my film
away from me. The cops are so
little that you sort or growl at
them and make sure that none of
them sneak up on you from be
hind. All this took place when the
government police surrounded a
school where a group of anti-gov»
emment Buddhists were having a
meeting. All three networks, three
wire services, and many news-
papers were there — quite a
gathering really.

“Anyway, they told us to leave
and we said no. They don’t like
in have their handling or disslr
dents photographed (they are none
loo gentle).

“About our ambassador: The re-
porter that got beat up was British
and Within two hours after notify-
ing the British Embassy the em-
bassy ﬁled a very slrong note of
protest. The next day another of
our photographers, Steve Van
Meter, got beat up. We notified
the American officials and they
said that they would look into it.
They never did do anything. The
embassy and high military people
don’t like newsman, I’m afraid."

nodierne says that as of yet he
is in no position to comment ex-
pertly on the Vlet Nam situation,
“I didn’t really come here to do
that.” He went on to say, “All my
previous expectations about life
here were wrong. Before I came
over I read nothing which pre-
pared me ior this place, it's such
a complete shift from the 11.5. in
almost every respect. People try
to understand it in terms oi U.S.
standards, which simply do not
apply.”

In early July Hodierne was
wounded, though not very serious-
ly. while out on patrol with an
American armored column. “I
was riding in this personnel car-
rler (APC) and our artillery was
iiring protective rounds along the
jungle on either side of the road
(keeps Charlie back away from us
and helps protect us from amr
bushes). Anyway, they ﬁred one
volley rub close and I look schrap-
nel in my left arm and in my
chest near my right shoulder. Bled
like a Sun of a bitch but didn’t
hurt and I was back out in the
jungle n day and a half later. 1

lingers of my lelt hand."

a senior this year, just barely

5&3 Hodleme wrote, “You may
see a notable increase in concern
about things that happen outside
our sequestered Skinner box on
the prairie. You may, in tact,
find an editor who is quite bored
with things that have concerned
campalgning editors ol bygone
days. l'm not likely to become up-
set about SGA elections and the
like."

Hodieme often expressed his
discontent With college life at
Grinnell and wrote several col~
umns and editorials in Ihe 5&1}
about this. In one he wrote of a
nineteen-year—old soldier who was
shot in a Viet Cong ambush: “Hel

one, too, ought to get someplace
where he’s really afraid for his

He concluded that letter, "l can

large Crop of leilermen
Favors Bright Grid Season

With a team built around 21 let-
termen, Grinnell is expected to be
in the thick of what shapes up as
the Midwest Conference’s wildest
football race in years,

The lettermen comprise more
than half of the 40-man Squad
which began drills last week. The
Pioneers open their season against
Cornell at Mt. Vernon Sept. 24.

Twenty of the veterans were
members of last year’s club,
which won six of eight games to
place second in the loop. The let
one lettered in 1964, but missed
lasl season while on an off-campus
study project,

"This year’s race should be a
real battle,” says Pioneer Coach
Edd Bowers. “Defending champ
ion Ripon has to get the nod, Grin-
uell, Belolt, Lawrence, and St.
Olaf all have a good chance to un-
seat the Reilmen. And Carleton
Cue, and Cornell will be tough too.

“We should be better than last
year because ui our experience
and could be very good,” Bowers
noted, but [lien cautioned, “we
could also hnish with a poorer
record because of the high level
of competition."

Bowers has experienced gridders
returning at every posllioh, with
the heaviest concentrations at and
(six letlel'men), guard (four), tear
kle and halfback (three apiece),
and fullback (two).

The big trouble spots are line-
backer, where all-conference per-
formers Tom Lannom and Paul
Thurston must be replaced, and
quarterback, where Barry Ander-
son, who set four Pioneer career
passing marks, has departed.

Veteran Rich Weeks and sopho-

 

more Tom Lower are expected to

battle for the quarterback lob.
Both are ranked as better run-
ners than passers, so one of Bow-
ers’ major tasks will be to de-
velop an aerial game to go along
with an anticipated strong ground
attack.

The Pioneers will again he on
the small side — only four of ihem
lop 200 pounds — but will be quick.

‘We did a good job of compen-
sating for our lack of size with
the quickness last year and I think
we can do the same this fall,”
Bowers stated.

5&3 Needs Help

The ﬁrst staff meeting or the
new school year will be held in
the 5&3 office in the north end
of the Forum Basement nr s 0

tomorrow evening. All in»
terested students are urged to

Due to the departure or (he
former editor, the 5&3 is un—
dergoing many changes in staff
and procedure and many op-
portunities exist for sludents
with journalistic interest. No
previous experience is nec-
essary and freshmen as well
as upperclassmeii are needed.

5&3 Needs Editor

The Board of Publicalions is
now accepling applications for
