By Renate Reicha

From “Honey" with a bebop
beat to “Grinnell. Grinnell"
the Searleteers present a pleas-
ing variety of music. Craig
Welterlen, senior, the leader of
the group, describes' them as
“a bunch of guys singing to-
gether for the fun of it." Dick
Bailly, Jim Stith, and Al Ross-
rnan, juniors; Tom Pope, Bill
Hughes, Dick Lovell, anti John
Phillips, sophomores, comprise]
this year’s Scarleieers, a'

While not affiliated with Grin-
nell, College, the Scarleteers'
are all Grinnell students and
most of them are active in
other campus musical activi-
ties. They also make tradition-
al appearances on campus,
such as their annual Mother's
Day performance. The group
also performs off-campus en-
gagements, utilizing a variety
of music from traditional bar~
bershop to serious Brahms.
Practices are held Weekly. rer

group has an engagement, and
the Scarleteers arrange much
of their own music. Entertain-
ment value is stressed and
songs are accommodated to fit
the audience, A typical per-
former will usually include
so me barbershop harmony,
semi-serious music, and a spec-
iall‘y number.

Tryouts for the Scarleteers
are held in the spring. No pre-
vious experience is required,
but sought-after qualities are
music comprehension, stage
presence, and the ability to
blend well with the group. The
main objective, as Welterlen
stressed, is to give a good per-
and have a good
tlme while doing it. This spir-
it was plainly exemplified dure
ing Dance 1. ME: for, whether
in gold Presley coats and sun
glasses or traditional scarlet,
the group clearly had a good
time, and. as is typical of Sear-
leteers performances, the aud—

The Quad’s counterpart to
the Scarleteers are the Tanagr
ers, a vocal group consisting
of nine girl singers. Dodi
Holcher, Donna Dagenais, Peg-
gy Ziegenhagen, Ruth Unruh,
and Becky Reetz, seniors; Mar-
cia James and Holly Hoebel,‘
juniors; Ginger Clark and
Cris Swanson, sophomores, are
the members of,tllis year's
group. ’

The Tanagers, who startedi
life long ago as the Debonairs,
are also not affiliated with
Grinnell College, although they
represent it indirectly as Grin-
nell Students, They perform at
various Oifvcampus engage-
ments, utilizing a music range.

The group writes some of its
own music, and tries for a
balance of light and semi~ser-
ious numbers. Practices are
held on Tuesday nights at 6:30.

Marcia James, as the group
leader, arranges the group’s
performances, sets rehearsal
times, and decides on the final
selection of the music.

As in the case of the Scar-
leteei‘s, the Tanagers are in
the group because they enjoy
lsinging and giving perform-
lances. Most of the group, Miss
[James feels, will continue sing-
ring in various actiVlties after
‘they leave Grinnell. The name,
incidentally, is derived from
called the Scarlet
,Tanager, who, unlike Grinnell's
group, cannot sing a note,
