Transcript of President Leggeii's Letter

1 wish in this letter to take
up three matters of concern to
students, Iaculty, and the Col-
lege Administration: (1) a re-
sponse to the proposal or your
committee for coeducational
use of common-use lounges;
:(2) a statement or matters I
consider essential to a long-rim
workable solution of our resi-
dance hall "problem”; and (3)
a discussion of the “reieren-
dtlm-proposal” oi the Student
Government Assocration of 11
November lor the management
of residence halls between now
and the time (a period that
has come to be known as the
“interim”) when a definite
policy can be worked out by
your committee, then approved
by the College Administration
and then implemented. Items
2 and 3 are dililcult to keep
leparable and discrete and
lhould perhaps be taken as n
oingle statement.

Proposal for the
co—educational use of
common-use lounges

On 22 October your commlt~
'th referred to me the lollowing
recommendations for the co-
educational use of commoneuse
lounges:

l — All halls, each fall, shall
set their own hours {or the coed
use of their commoneuse lounge.

2 — voting on the setting or
hours tor Coed use shall be by
Iecret ballot. A simple major-
Ity oi hall members shall be re-
quired to set hours between
I:Ol] 3.111. and midnight. A 2/3
majority of hall members shall
be required to set hours of use
It other times,

3 — Upon a regular motion
In hall meetings or upon peti-
Iion of 30% of the hall, the
question of lounge use may be
reopened for possible modifi-
cation. Voting procedure lor
revision shall be the same as
outlined under No. 1

4 — After locking hours, only
those men accompanied by
women students shall be per-
mitted in women’s residence
halls.
in point 4 or the recommenda-
tion I prefer that the statement

read as follow: Alter locking
hours, only those men accom-
panied by women students shall
be permitted in the common-
use lounges oi the women’s
residence halls. The bold
phrase is the addition and is
necessary lor clarity,

With the change just indi~
cated, the recommendations
have my approval and may be
implemented as soon as you
[ind it feasible [0 (lo 504

Essentials for a
workable solution of the
resident hall “problem.”

You may recall that in my
letter to faculty and students
at 30 October regarding the de-
ciSlon about Mr. Schneirov I
included the lollowing para-
graph:

As I see It, we need in the
residence halls

i — a mode of living and
regulation consistent won the
mental and physical health of
students, one which will serve
the best interests of the aca-
demic program or the College
and so permit students to work
eﬂectively as students (that is
to say, with sufficient rest,
quiet, emotional security, and
privacy to enable them to do
their best academic work);

2 — a set of standards for
behavior, and enforcement of
such standards, that assure
the trustees, the Iaculty, the
students, and me that neither
tyranny nor anarchy can oper-
ate in the residence halls:

3 — enough variety oi living
options designed by the College
community so that n divergen-
cy in temperament and person»
:11 style can obtain in both pres-
ent and prospective students;
and

4 — a means for the Judicial
Council and, where necessary,
the deans, to deal quickly
(either by removal from the
residence halls or from the col-
lege) with a student or group
of students whn Can not abide
by any regulation, either those
oi their peers or those at the
College.

items 1 and 2 are chiefly dif-
ferent ways of saying Ihe same

thing, ior each refers to the
need to have a style or hie in
the residence halls Ihat at the
very minimum does not inter-
{are with the ability oi Students
to get their academic work
done. item Ii rclers to the need
to create and maintain enough
diilerences in the regulations
of individual halls so that both
present and prospective stu<
dents oi ditterent expectations
and sophisticanons can be ac-
commodated. Item 4 reiers to
the need tor disciplinary and
enforcement procedures which
can operate both iairly and
quickly, Though none oi the
items gets to the crucial ques-
rions or how and when, they do
add up to a statement of broad
policy which the trustees at
their meeting of Z and 3 No-
vember subscribed to as a
Board, as did the Executive
Council oi the Faculty at its 13
November meeting.

A variety of points or view
exists among students and lac-
ulty and the College Adminis-
tration about specific defini-
tions of the terms in the (our
items, as well as about what
ways oi implementing the gen~
eral policy. And this statement
leads to another: that there are
differences in concerns about
the residence halls that have
to be recognized and then taken
into account by three groups or
people — students, laculty, and
the C o l l e g e administration
(which may be said In repre-
sent not only the trustees and
the president but through them,
though imperlectly, alumul,
parents, and prospective stu-
dents).

Discussion of this three-way
net of Concerns begins with the
recognition that this College,
like almost any other or its
kind, has found It very diffi-
cult in the last decade to sup-
port the notion, which once was
a matter of lailh, that residence
hall management ought chiefly
to reﬂect Ii kind at remedial-

parenthood (in loco parentls)
environment: in other words,
that the residence halls are a
central part or a character-to
mation or finishing-school m
sion (or the institution. But this
admisston oi change is a state-
ment quite dependent on the
next one, which is that the Col-
lege cannot endorse an anarchic
system which will inevitably
result in “every man lor him-
self.” Roughly speaking, the
pattern oi residence hall regu-
lations exists lot reasons not
exclusively in [he Interests at
students or their leelings about
sell-education; there are other
reasons, the sources of which
lie in history. economics, archi-
tectural limitations, and society
tit-larger Nu matter what
changes in speciiic regulations
may become appropriate, the
College must always house the
majority of its students in a rash-
ion that attends to their mental
and physical health In such a
way that the life in the halls at
its best contributes to campus
llie and at its worst does not de-
tract from it. When it dna
work, a residence hall system
lucceeds in uniting with a de-
gree of practical reasonable
ness the essential concerns of
the faculty, the wishes of stu-
dents, and what can be Called
the “accountability of the Col-
lege administration"

Faculty concerns range from
n disinterest in the residence
halls to a concern that laculty
members themselves do all
they can individually and col-
lectively to help students and
deans bring a positive and per-
vasive “inlellectualism” into
the halls. Between the two ch
tremes are a variety ol‘ indi-
vidual faculty attitudes, all of
which are natural reﬂections of
the fact that the Grinnell lac-
ulty consists of persons of dif-
Ierent temperaments who can
be said to have varying styles
of talking with students. But it
is safe to say that whatever their

all faculty members are in
agreement that life in the Resie

mum, Should not interfere with
the educational program of the
College,

Let me speak now or student a
wishes. Students are chaling
under restrictions on dormitory
visitation which in many "1-
stances may be more conserva-
tive than those “at home” or
in many surrounding schools or
our size and type, and even
somewhat more restrictive than
those in the dormitories of ma-

t . . . . s
yor state universities, Including
those in luwa. As the demand
or study and the seriousness
or purpose or our students have
increased, the amount of en-
ergy and time once given with
good humor to adjustment to
“hall life” has decreased; and
the diversity of personalities
and codes of morality now rep; h
