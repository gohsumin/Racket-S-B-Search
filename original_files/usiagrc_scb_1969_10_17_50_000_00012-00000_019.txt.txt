al Action. Many of those joining the
demonstration were from the surrounding
communities. As the march moved down
the street, many more joined, within

a short time bringing the total to more
than 2500. Those who did not join
cheered from windows and porches as the
march passed.

Throughout the early part of the
march a police car accompanied the de—
monstrators repeating over and over, in
both Spanish and Edglish, that the mar—
chers did not have a permit and were
violating the law by marching in the
street. The demonstrators paid no heed.
The procession was now more than two
blocks long. A file of police flanked
the marchers on the left side, as they
only occupied the right half of the
street.

The march route was over five miles
long and ended in Humboldt Park on the
far west side of Chicago. There another
rally was held at which more speakers,
again, principally Young Lords, addres—
sed the crowd.

Following the rally police arrested
Mike Klonsky, who had also spoken brief—
ly. "The only reason they arrested him
is because he is white," said one mar—
cher. The people wouldn't have let
them arrested anybody else, not in
this area."

Following the two marches, a large
crowd began to gather in Grant Park.

By A:OO over 200 were present, many sur—
rounding the statue of General Logan.

At one end of the park members of the
American Nazi Party demonstrated carry—
ing signs proclaiming "Gas the Red Trai—
tors," "Support White Police," and "We
Killed Ho Chi Minh."

National Guard vehicles circled the
area. A large squad of helmeted police
stood in formation across Michigan Ave.
which borders the park. Throughout the

nearby Loop area, police officers stood
guard at every block and a cordon of po—
lice surrounded City Hall.

Shortly after h100 Deputy Chief of
Patrol James Riordan arrived with sev—
eral squads of police and about 15 de—
tectives. Riordan approached the crowd

with a portable loudspeaker and announ—
ced:

"There are people in this crowd who
will be indentified by officers as be—-
ing guilty of assault. Those people
will be arrested. It is expected that
they will surrender with no resistance.
If there is resistance or if anyone
tries to aid a prisoner, there will be
further arrests. There is no need to
run or to panic."

It had been rumored that the Weather—
men would hold one last rally at Grant
Park. Riordan had with him officers who
had been in the fighting little more
than an hour before.

The squad of about 75 officers, in
formation, moved up to the statue. An—
other group of police formed a wider
ring about the entire crowd. The offi—
cers identified no one and left after
about five minutes as the youth about
the statue sang "Mickey Mouse" and blew
soap bubbles.

Another contingent of officers moved
in and one person was arrested. A some—
what ludicrous scene followed as 50
grim faced, helmeted officers, formed
in double file, escorted the youth to a
paddy wagon. Again the officers drew
loud jeers. Most of the police departed
from the area a short time later.

About fifteen minutes following the
arrest, a Weatherman spokesman addres—
sed the crowd. "In the last four days,"
he began, "we have learned some impor—
tant lessons."

"The most important lesson is that
we can fight, too — that we have a role
to play — that's a tremendous lesson."

"We have learned that the spirit of
the people is greater than the man's
technology . "

People in the crowd, at least one of
them an undercover policeman, began to
heckle the speaker. He ignored them.
”We did what we have to do every time,"
he continued .

"We have shown the pigs that we can
fight. We have shown the pigs that they
have to overextend themselves on another
front. We have taken the movement a
qualitiative step forward."

"We are now going to split into
groups of four and five and take to the
subways and buses. We are going to
take the lessons we have learned here
in Chicago home with us as we go back,
we are going to bring the war home!"
