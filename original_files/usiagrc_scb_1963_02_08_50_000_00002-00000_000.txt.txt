Grinnell A. F. (after Fordl

"By now, most of the anguished outcl'ies arising from
President Bowen’s November pronouncement that there
will be no rule changes this year have died down. Perhaps
with the subsiding of passions we can better see what the
lasting effect of that decision will be.

In reality its real importance is not that we won’t
have liberalization of the drinking rule or women’s hours
this year, nor that the decision was made by administrative
fiat even before the students could present specific pro~
posals; but that the decision was made on the basis of its
effect on the public, not on the merits of the proposals
themselves

This concern for Grinnell‘s image seems to be a pro-
duct 01) the Ford Foundation fund-raising drive. And it‘
seems to many of us that if this is the effect the Ford
grant will have on Grinnell, the college can just as Well do
without the money. ‘

Before the Ford drive began, it was thought that one
of the aims of the college was to provide an atmosphere of
intellectual freedom, where a student could pursue anyl
idea to its logical conclusion, no matter how unpopularl
that idea might be with the public. i

But now the students are prevented from pursuing the‘
idea of li eralization of rules to the logical end of present-
ing specific proposals, because the administration fears
that it will discourage the public from contributing to the
college’s fund drive.

Before the possibility of a Ford grant was considered,
Grinnell distinguished itself from most of the colleges in
the country by its attitude toward intellectual freedom. It
ditﬁfered from those colleges that frown upon religious un-
orthodoxy; it differed from colleges like Beloit which re—
cently refused to let Gus Hall speak on its campus be-
cause of his political views. However, the present concern
for Grinnell’s image, if continued, would eventually extend
to control over the speakers we invite to this campus and

is one who takes pleasure in a virtuous life, a
sinful man one who takes pleasure in a sinful
life. That’s very terse, absolutely correct, and it
has a lot of implications.

sible to lead a virtuous life and still be a very
sinful man (sinful means nasty and greedy, if
you insist I define my terms.) I don’t think I
need to elaborate much on this. because we all
know nasty and greedy men who lead virtuous
lives. The point is simply that their virtue isn’t
worth a fig, because rather than taking pleasure
in virtue itself, they take pleasure in the things
it can bring them; their goodness is not a joy but
a burden, undertaken for the sake of its profit-
able results.

nice, and generous) And this is possible because

To the Editor:

If anything was clear in the
editorial “Independent Study" of
last week‘s sen, it was the
,feeiing that “study” and ”school”
are diﬁicult things, that one
llives through, and then, having
survived, one relaxes and rath-
er hesitatingly worries about the
next semester. This attitude and
its appearance in the “lack of
enthusiasm" for the interim ses—
sion reﬂect a deeper and more
limportant attitude on the part of
““5 “who student body of Grinnell.

This is the idea, and a rather
vague one, that a degree from
Grinnell will enable a student
to enter some graduate school
or lake up some business posi-
tion so that he may find a

What, after all, are we “liberal-

Not only do some students fail
to respond “enthusiastically" to
an interim session for “inde-
pendent study," but some fail to
respond in that manner to any
study. Witness the English stu-
dents making only feeble at-
tempts in science, and the sci-
ence students doing likewise in
literature. As if this were not
lenough, consider the students in
their own majors, who do not
really care to ﬁnd out much
more than is necessary for their
classes! This is indicative not
only of a “lack of enthusiasm"

but of no real concept of what
a student is. This is certainly
not a characteristic of the intel-
lectually curious student. Why
even come to school?

This whole attitude toward
study shows a false concept of
education, for study becomes the
means by which one acquires a
grade, and the grade is lhe
means into graduate school, and
so forth up the ladder of “suc-
cess." This, perhaps, is the rev-

over the ideas we discuss here because they may alienate
those who donate to the college. When that happens, Grin~
nell College will probably be rich, but certainly not dis-
tinguished.

Let’s abandon the policy that has arisen since then
of tlying to stifle discussion of embarrassing ideas in or-
der to protect the college’s reputation. Let’s return to the
goal of intellectual freedom, return to the goal of becoming,
one of the great intellectual institutions of the country, a
goal which the Ford Foundation, in 1961 at least, thought‘
we had the potential to achieve.

The scholarship rule

“Through the generosity of donors, Grinnell is able
to award about $200,000 annually in scholarships and
grants-in—aid.” (1960 Grinnell College Bulletin) And gene
erous Glinnell t‘hen lists in the Bulletin the conditions
which govern the giving of scholarships:

fulfill this expectation. If he transfers to another college
prior to his graduation from Grinnell, all money he hasl
received in scholarships or grants-maid shall be due to be
repaid immediately. A transcript of the student’s record is
not issued until all his financial obligations are discharged."

Suppose a student may discover that he does not want
to continue his education at Grinnell. Suppose his reason is
not substantial. Say, he wants to take aquatic engineeling
at the University of New Mexico, and he feels he is neither

The chances are very good that this student Will notl

The repayable scholarship rule is not old and ready to
die. It was instituted to apply to students admitted in 1959
or later. This rule is morally wrong. Grinnell College did not
institute its scholarship program to force dissatisfied in-
dividuals to stay merely because they can’t afford to leave.

They probably instituted this rule because it considers,
scholarship students as investments. This rule then violates l
the purpose of a scholarshipito further an individual‘sl

their fame and fortune into the lap of the college.
