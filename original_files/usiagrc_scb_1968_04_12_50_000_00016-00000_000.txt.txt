SCARLET AND BLACK

WHERE

Grinnell started his town on
the prairie where he thought
northesouth and east-west rall-
mads would cross. A century
later, the North Western and
Rock Island trains Sllll rum-
ble through town, beckoning
the restless to travel on.

The C&NW offers two freight
trains north and south dallyt
sauth in the early morning
north in the late morning;

both ways in the middle Elf the
afternoons

The CREW alters a more
vaned dlet: twu passenger
trains (2:29 p.m. and 2:44
p.m.); two mail trams (2:22
am, and 4:21 a.m.); seven reg-
ular freight trains running
throughout the day: extra
iraights running anytime.

Your last glimpses of Grin-
nell are captured In this photo
assay by Lllalt Morton.
