ally—speaking members had al-
ready been supported by a
large portion oi the iaculty.

The proposed student voting
privilege also introduced the
problem at a veto at u go-ahead
trom a body which had not here-

Joseph F. Wall commented,

if students were simply allowed
to attend, it would not require

by the iaculty, its ’ ial approval
would necessitate major changes
in the college b laws. and the

This consideration entered in-
to the faculty’s discussion oi the
Bells committee recommenda-
tions, and, accortliog to
Wall, some professors thought

earliest possible date for the
implementation or the right
would probably be at the end of
the ﬁrst semester, since it would
wait upon the action or the trus-
tees, whose next meeting is not
until mid-Novemberi

Asst, Proiessor John H. Wor-
iey (philosophy). the secretory
oi the faculty, estimates that
taculty discussion iollowing
Betts’ presentation lasted an
hour, or tor the greater part or
the ‘meeting. in the debate, sev-
e ral conilicting viewpoints
clashed, according to Worley,
and the wording oi the proposal
was argued back and iorth.

One outstanding objection,
voiced later in an interview with
Prolessor John R. Kleinschmidt,
chairman oi the iaculty, is that
to allow student mg would
he tantamount to c nging the
conceptitrom a faculty meeting
to a community meeting.

“In the View 0i some," Klein-
scltmidt Said, “a public meeting
does not provide the kind or frce<
(km to not only so, what i want
now , but to consider the matter
now and later, to change my
mind, to not gec prematurely
ovelxcommitted."

Wall commented that another

objection voiced by some ia-
cuity members was that the
two parts—faculty and students
#maklng up the “new” iaculty
meetings might be accused or
tokemsm, since the ratio of stu-
dents to lacuity would be 1 to 12.
They would also, he said, he on
a very ditterent touting, The
elected students would be re
presentatives # charged repre-
sentatives # in an otherwise
democratic body made up or all
iaculiy iroin Instructors to Pro-
tessot's.

The Bells committee stood on
the other Side, firmly behind
the idea ol students expressing
student viewpoints in a body di—
rectly concerned with their
courses and daily routines. On
the committee, besides Belts,
are Professor Kenneth A, Chris-
tianson (Bio.),'Associate Pro—
fessor Eugene A, Harman
(Mathematics), Associate Pm<
lessor Karl DeLorig (Bio,), and
Asst. Protessot‘ Neal A. Milner
(Political Science).

in the course oi the debate,
an amendment came up to de-
lete the se ion on voting, and
both the original motion and the
amendment were totally tabled
following a motion by win Klein-
schmidt; the debate was
terminated.

In an interview with an 5&3
reporter on Tuesday, Klein-
schmidt responded to questions
about students in iaculty meet-
ings. One question was what
kinds of restrictions he sees as
necessary (or attendance. His
answer:

”Suppose someone, some pro-
iessor proposes a plan which is
popular, catches on ~ it gets out
as an idea — an outside group
runs with that ball, and expecta-

tions arise among the student:
mat certain things are going to
happen. 1! it's not. approved in
the long run, there will he re-
sentment, protest, a feeling or
‘why not?’. At best, that kind or
protest creates a divisiveness
that is not necessary," Klein-
schmidt also commented upon
an incident at Harvard Univer-
sity several years ago when the
lacuity there passed a rule
against publicizing any decision
until it was acted upon.

“I don‘t advocate this," Klein-
schmidt said, “but. I can see a
certain sense in reducing pre-
mature expectations and reac-
tions to things that have not
been worked out iully.”

Does Kleinschmidt see any
parallels between the current
controversy at Grinnell and
those occurring at other
schools? He told the 5&3:

“There has been a great deal
OT discussion and action in col-
leges and universities here and
in Canada, for example, to pro«
vide mechanisms such as stu-
dents on the boards of trustees.
it may be. on both sides, some-
thing or riding a popular idea,
a lad. . , .Although i think the
iaculty here could live with stu-
dents attending its meetings. I
personally can't get my mind
around to the proposal or a
student vote. This makes it an
entirely different ball-game."

Dean Wall expects that this
student, attendance proposal
might come up tor raculty dis-
cussion several times before it
is ultimately acted upon. He
said, ”It’s all up in the air now,
because the (acuity tabled it —
it will no doubt come up at the
October 6 meeting (the next
one)."
