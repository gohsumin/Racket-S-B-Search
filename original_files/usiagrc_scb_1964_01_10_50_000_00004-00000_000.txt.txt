In MCAC Play

Joel U n g r o d.t, Lawrence’s
little guard, hung onto his Mide
west Conference scoring lead
85 he led his Vikings to a two‘
game roadsweep last weekend.
the first road wins for Law-
rence in three seasons.

Making the biggest jump in

'ihe individual department was
Cornell’s Dick Calbow, who
vaulted from 13th spot before
the holiday break to third place
this w e e k, mainly on the
strength of a 36 point perform-
ance against Monmouth, the

’league high for the year.

Busiest teams of the week
will be Carleton and St. Olaf.
Each has three games, starting
eon Tuesday when they tangle
with each other on the Olca‘
home court.

On the weekend, these two
play host to Cornell and Grin-
nell. the second and third place
teams in the loop. Cornell goes
to St. Olaf and Grinnell to Car-
leton on Friday. It is change
partners on Saturday afternoon.

Cornell’s vaunted offense is
back on the track now after
stuttering during the holiday
recess. It features the deadly
shooting of Jack Grams and the
all-around play of Calbow. Dal
Zierk, a starting guard, should
be back after undergomg minor
surgery.

Grinnell has three of the top
scorers in the league ~ Jim
leflin, Gordon Klnkead, and
Jeff Frantz ~ and the leading
rebounder in John Sllndell, who

has plucked off over 20 stray ‘
shots a game, and |S currently:

fourth in that department in the
nation.

Lawrence, about the llottesu

team in the league right now,
gets its biggest test oi the year
Saturday when Ripon goes to
Appleton, Wis.

C h i o a g 0 Holiday Basketball
Tournament in Chicago. The
last minute victory in the finals
followed a semi-final, 68-61, win
over Colorado College.

Thanks, primarily, to superb
second half efforts in the
championship game by sopho-
more guard Gordy Kinkead, at
5’9”, the shortest man on the
court, and senior center John
Sundel‘l, at 6’7”, the tallest
player on ﬁle floor, the Pio-
neers were able to overtake
Knox for the first time with 1
min. 26 secs. left to play and
held on to cop the tournament
trophy.

Kinkead, scoring 19 a d e r
against Colorado the night be—
fore, tallied 16 big points in the

second half against the Siwash
to pull the Pioneers out of a
scoring drought that put them
nine points behind with less
Chain 10 minutes left to play.
Ten of Kinkead’s 22 total points
were scored in the last nine
minutes of the contest.
Sundell, held to only two
points and seven rebounds in
the first period against Knox,
came alive in the second-half
to pull down is rebounds and
tally six key points. His final

utes to playfput Grinnell in the
lead to stay. In an outstanding
effort to keep the Pioneers’
hopes alive, Sundell collected

All,

By Len Calodney

In setting up the experiment to test the benefit’of
face guards for 1M football helmets, two methods
might be tried. ,

First, two halls could be given the strings of hel-
mets with the guards to use throughout the season. In
this way it could be directly seen whether the face
guards caused a reduction in the number of facial in-
juries for that particular hall by comparing yearly fig-
ures. An immediate objection to this idea stems from
the number of head injuries reported each year. Since
there are an average of eleven injuries a season in this
area, or an average of about one per hall per year, the
fact that one hall may or may not get its quota can
not be significant on such a small number of cases.

The second possibility would be to use the two
strings of special helmets on one field all year. In this
way, one-third of the games (or more if Mac field is
used as the standard) played will involve the use for
the face guards rather than oneafifth by the other plan.

One or two preparations must be made by the In-
tramural department before the experiment can go
into effect. The IM managers, students in charge of
each field during each game, would have to keep a
close record of all head and facial injuries, especially
the kind that wouldn’t be reported to the nurse. The
latter category would include the minor bloody noses
or split lips that often occurl This information could
be briefly stated on a sheet listing name and nature of
injury.

Secondly, since the face guards do present a con-
venient hand-hold, referees would have to be briefed
about watching this type of offense closely. A tighten-
ing of the rules might also be coupled with this provid-
ing for removal from the game of anyone committing
two such offenses. ,

If the tests are carried out diligently, maybe we
will find that there is a positive correlation between
face guards and fewer injuries.

Swimmers Go
To Augusiana

Grinnell’s swimming team
travels to Rock Island, 111., to-
morrow for a meet with Augus-
tana, the first after Christmas
vacation.

With several revisions of
squad members made in the
last week the lineup for Augus-
tana is still undecided. Mike
Fort suffered a turned ankle
early in the week and his en-
trance in the sprint events to-
morrow is doubtful.

Pete Barry and Ralph Pray
are tentatively scheduled to
swim the 200 and 500 freestyle
events. Tony Horton and Dave
Lundberg will swim the 200
backstroke, Wiilh John Kraai
and Terry Maynard scheduled
to go in the 200 breaststroke.
Eric Jacobson will swim the 200
butterfly. Howie Schein will
compete in the sprint events.

Horton, Kraai and Lundberg
are scheduled to swim the first
three legs of the medley relay.
Ton-i Pester and Roger Ahen-
droth will represent the Pier
users in the diving competition
and Kraai will Swim the indi-
vidual medley. Other positions
for the meet have not yet been
filled.

The Iowa Wesleyan meet
scheduled for Mount Pleasant

and rebounding, They collected
54 rebounds to Gnnnell's ~12.

In the end, however, the Si-
wash were undone by their own
aggressiveness. They w o r a
charged with 18 personal fouls
in the second half to Grinnell’a
10. This enabled the Pioneers
to pick up badly needed points
at the free throw line.

Leading scorer in the contest
was Kinkead with 22. Next on
the list was sophomore forward
Jeff Frantz with 17.

The final order of finish in
the tournament was (1) Grin-
nell. (2) Knox, (3) Univeralty
