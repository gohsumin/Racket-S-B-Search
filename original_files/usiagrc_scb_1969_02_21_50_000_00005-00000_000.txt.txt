Know Your Neighbor or "Gidgel Goes Io Monmouth"

GARY GIDDENS

0n the evening at February 14, three
members of the Grinneli student body
embarked on a perilous search for truth,
justice and the American way at Mon
mouth College. The students were mild-
mannerod SGA president Thomas Thom-
as. (it’s a rough task but one that all
honest men should aspire to"), that loves
ly and austere newspaper editor Susan
Kaeser (“Those presses are my life,
by golly, and I‘ll go anywhere for a
good scoopr"). and me, your jolly social
coordinator (“Ba yabada oolla, Ba
yabada oolia coo”).

The trip was motivated by an ACM
oonierence sponsored by Monmouth and
u desire to get the hell out of Grinnell,
sponsored by the Attorney General of
Iowa. Should the meetings be successiul.
we intended to return to Grinnell with
new ideas and broader vistas in the areas
of editing, good writing and dictating.
Should the meetings be a failure. . .weu,
there‘s a great little hamburger stand on
the outskirts of Monmouth.

We arrived at the college (after stop-
ping at the hamburger stand) at about
9:00. Representatives of Monmouth were
to be awaiting us at the student union.
Alter decoding the rather enigmatic di-
Tections given to us by a fat little Mon-
mouthian carrying a bowling ball, we
tound the appointed place. There we
were greeted by reps from Cornell as
well as Monmouth. They eagerly shook
our hands and asked if “they" really
took their clothes off. The three of us
debated brieﬂy as to whether we should
dismbe, light a joint, and copulate —
menage a‘ trois — on the floor. thereby
living up to our reputations, but de-
cided against it on the grounds that it
might alienate them at the meetings.
(Have you readers felt that Grlnnell —
the “Gem of the Cornfield” -—— breeds in-
tolerance?) They decided to postpone the
meeting long enough for us to be housed.
Susan was taken oif to room with the
iemale SGA candidate and Thomas and l
were taken to that old zippo-bang frat
house, TKE. TKE-house is a marvelous
example of where it‘s at in contemporary
America. A brief questioning of the in
habitants brought out the (act that they
could have rA—hour opens it they desired

but that they voted against having girls
allowed past first floor because their
rooms are usually dirty and. well, you
know. Each room — all of them quads
which may be another season why girls
can't get up there -— has a zippy title
like The Bowery, The Pub, The Ghetto
and others not so imaginative. Each floor
has a mutual lounge where a set or bar-
bell: is at everyone's disposal. The frat
guys look disarmlngly alike. They have
short blond hair, pepsodent teeth, wear
gray V-neck sweaters with T-shirts and
tennis sneakers and speak a highly eso-
teric jargon: "Gosh," “Golly,” “Gee,"
“Darn," “Heck," and “Hi0." l was to
iind out what the latter term meant at
a party latter that night.

Back at the union we discovered that
students from Ripon had joined us and
that Knox would be represented Satur-
day. We were invited to sit around a
much too large table on which pads and
water pitchers were distributed. l have-
n’t had enough time to sort out my im-
pressions of that meeting, but the water
was very good. After the meeting we
were invited to the off campus residence
of a student, There, we were scheduled
to “party." Each of the colleges segre-
gated themselves into a comer oi the
room and began to drink. The room was
conspicuously decorated with an elab<
orate stereo system with (our records
and a two loot hooka placed on the col-
fee table lor show and use as an ashtray.
Unlike Susan and Thomas, this reporter
can proudly say that he made a sincere
and dutiful attempt to get in to the ieel
or things for a deeper understanding at
his hostsx l bravely consumed a bottle
of Wine.

The next morning we ate breakfast at
10:00 (not all SAGA systems are run
like Grinnell’s), and went to a meeting
at the union. I don't know What the
presidents or the editors discussed. but
the coordinators found little to agree on
in terms of block booking. Monmouth’s
major concerts were The Brothers Four,
Ferranti and Teicher, and Peaches and
Herb. ’l‘he “Ides at March” made the
front page of the Ripon newspaper
when they appeared there and one line
from that article read. "Anyone who
misbehaves. will be asked to leave the
dance, and lined ten dollars.” Among
the other interesting bits of information
revealed were the facts that Monmouth-
ians have a tendency to be chubby, girls

at Monmouth have hours. and when
they have opens on weekends they‘re
really open (the door hall-way and the
lights on; this is enforced). and Men-
mouth does not: have a drug "problem."
Everybody’s too busy drinking.

We then paused for lunch and the
food was good, SAGA Chuck would be
awed at how good the loud was.

We all got together for the next and
last meeting in the Alumni room, and
discussed tor two hours when the next
meeting would be held. They insisted on
avoiding speciﬁcs, although they finally
agreed that we should send a notice to
all ACM schools as to whether they
would like to block book Bully St. Marie,
thereby lowering her price. The results
of that are yet to be seen.

Driving hack to Grinneli we had much
to think about. Frat liie for example
was a revelation. You wake up, lift
weights, eat, lift weights, eat, get drunk,
throw up, go to sleep, wake up, lift
weights, etc., etc. We also mourned
over the fact, goshdarnit, that Grinnell
doesn’t have things like winter weekend,
spring Olympics and tall pick-up-sticks.
And how come Only the Scarleteers get
to wear bright red blazers around here?
There was much indeed to ponder as we
drove through the tenebrous portals of
this great institution.

O“ St, Johns, but for some unexplained
reason was not able to dock.

Larry was selected by Liberation
News Service to go to Cuba as a part
