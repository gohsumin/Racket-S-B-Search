NSF GRANT

'Grinnell College has been a-
Warded a tissue grant by the
National Science Foundation
for biology research.

The grant, which was eiiec-
iive Sept. 1 for a two~year per-
lad, is for research on “The Ei-
iect of Manipulation of Social
Structure on the Rate of Popu-
lotion IncreaseJn Small Mam<
mals” by Karl DeLong, assist-
mt professor of biology.

Dr. DeLong, who uses lei'al

search, has been working in
this area for five years. This

particular project grew out of
research conducted ior his Ph-
D. dissertation,

man and woman involved is A
complex matter. Lester Kiriren-
dall, in a sandy 0! this prob-
lem, found that in several in-
stances a relationship was
weakened, or even broken, as a
result of intercourse. How this
happens is not clear. When it
happens, the girl is oiten in a
difficult position: many men
who have no qualms about re-
ducing the supply of virgins
prefer to marry girls with no
sexual experience, or no exper-
ience with men other than
themselves.

S e r i o u s misunderstandings
can result from physiological
and psychological differences
between the sexes, unless the
intentions of the individuals cori-

cemed are completely under-
stood. Hettlinger cited a Kin-
sey study showing that the
need of men for physical sata
isiaction in sex reaches its peak
in the late teens, while this
peak in women occurs about
ten years later.

This means that the college-
age man is likely to be con-
cerned largely with sexual de-
sire, while the girl will more

probably be thinking in terms

of a lasting relationship. while
her gestures may be intended
to show her affection for him,
he might interpret them as sig-
niiying sexual excitement. Be-
ing excited himself, he may
find it impossible no stop when
she asks him to. While he can
get a purely physical enjoyment
from sex, she cannot, and may
be disgusted by sexual actions

which do not express love. if he
sincerely loves her, he must
keep these differences in mind
if he is to avoid forcing his
desires on her.

Despite medical advances in
the area of birth control, one
premarital sexual liaison in
ﬁve results in an accidental
pregnancy. Since those who are
most promiscuous are usually
the most careful in their con-
traceptive measures, they are
less likely to get "in trouble"
than those who don’t really plan
to have intercourse, but prog-
ress to it from petting.

The ethical problems of stu-
dent sexual relationships. says
Hettlinger, can be directly at-
tributed to the mixedup moral-
ity of the older generation. By
social pressure and intensive
indoctrination from the mass

media, society encourage:
young people to "exhaust their
repertoire" in the early stages
of heterosexual involvement 4
and then forbids intercourse.
Unable to explain their attitude
in any reasonable manner, pars
ents leave their children with'
vague feelings that sex is wrong
while Madison Avenue constant:
ly portrays it as something
glamourous and attractive.

In revolt against this double
standard, peer group pressure
among students often results in
the formation of a "conformity
Di sexual freedom." Even slus
dents who do not accept tradi~
tional mores, however. tend to
reject promiscuity and insist on
“high standards of love and
loyalty."

Hettlinger is Chairman of the
Department of Religion at Ken.
yon College, Gambier, Ohio.
Born in England. he studied at
Cambridge University. He has
taught ln Toronto, Canada, and
Canterbury, England. in l959,
Hettlinger came to the U.S. for
graduate work at Yale Univer.
sity, and a year later he was
appointed Chaplain and Asso-
ciate Professor of Religion at
Kenyon. In the fall of 1963, he
gave a series of lectures on
“Sex and the Single Student",
and the enthusiastic reaction
from students and faculty led
him to expand the talks into
his book, Living with Sex. H0
intends to write another book,
aimed at high-school students, to
be called Growing Up with Sex.

DANFORTH
0N CATALYSTS

'A catalyst is a chemical
agent which acts to speed up
specific reactions. They are
found in the cells of plants and
animals, and take part in th-
metabolic process. Catalyst!
are also used by industry in the
manufacture of such products
as ammonia and plastics, and
in the cracking of petroleum to
gasoline.

This last reaction was the
Iubject of last week's lecture
by Dr. Joseph Danforth of the
chemistry department. Dr,
Danforth worked for Universal
Oil Products before coming to
Grinnell, and has conducted re—
search here on the petroleum
catalysts, the silica-aluminas.

He Spoke on his most recent
attempts to discover the site on
the molecule where catalytic
cracking takes place, using as
lecture aids models of [he
crystal structure of the zeoiile
clays (the same as the struc-
ture of the modern synthetic
silicaraluminas).

In his research, Dr. Danforth
found, purely by chance, that
only upon the addition of water
would his catalysts react (in
this case with isopropyl hen-
zene). The degree oi reaction
was recorded by a device cre-
ated by Dr. Dantonh which
measured the quantity of the
reaction products that came
off. He concluded that the wat-
er removes phenol (benzene
plus a hydrogen atom) and
leaves a hydroxide radical at
the specific site of activity.
This site is as yet undeter-
mined.

Dr. Daniorth will publish nit-
Qr the final conﬁrmation of his
results by means of infra-red
analysis.
