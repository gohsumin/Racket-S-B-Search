Faculty Approves Motion
To Speed Policy Decisions

By BENSON SMITH

Last Monday the faculty voted
in iavor of a motion requstcrl by
the Social Science Division that
will greatly centralize the pro
cedure determining educational
policy within
NEWS that: division
ANALYSIS Educational
Policy com-
mittees (EPC) exist in every
division. One member from
each department in the divl<
sion is on the committee. The
function of these committees is
to consider new course pro-
posals, plans to reorganize cur-
riculum, and suggestions to add
or drup Courses. The considera-
tions made hy the committee
are then discussed and voted on
by the entire faculty within the
division.

The motion passed Monday
eliminates the necessity or a
faculty Vote in the Social
Sciences Division. The action
taken by the EPC will now in

the approval at the Executiv-
Council, Division meeting: on

The motion was unanimously
adopted by the Social Selene.

members were uninlormed last

improve the situation? A gen—

changes is vital on a small
campus. The division meetings
served as a means in increase
this general awareness.

However, the most valuable
possession or all men is time.
The new resolution will save
valuable time and its strength
lies in this quality. To deter
