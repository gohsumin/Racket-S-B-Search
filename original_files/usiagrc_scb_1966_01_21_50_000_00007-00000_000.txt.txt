t Eais Lunch With Dennys

(Continued from Page 3)

Guest House. where the Dennys
are staying. and eat lunch with
them. By eating with them, i am
able to get somewhat better iood
than I would be getting in the local
canteens, pllis the fact that there
is a lot less chance of me getting
sick.

After lunch I came back to my
room for a short rest and a look
at my new TIME magazine, which
comes every Saturday. TIME
might not be the greatest maga-
zine in the world, but I read it
from cover to cover every week,
because it is the only written
news I have that tells me about
what is taking place in America,

' besides the iniormation sent [a me
every once in a while by the
United States Information Service.
I am able to listen to radio broad-
casts from Voice of America and
the British Broadcasting System,
as well as English language
broadcasts from India, Pakistan,
and China on a radio the college
has loaned me, so I do have other
sources of news. I also get an
lndian newspaper, which tells me
what is happening in India, but
not much about the rest: of the
world.

At about 3 pm i got up and
started to wash my clothes. One
either sends his clothes to laun-
drymen (dhohis), who beat the
clothes against rocks or cement
beside a waterhole to get them
clean, or does them himself with
the use of buckets of cold water
and detergent. I use the latter
method for most of my clothes.
However, I do usually send my
shirts and trousers to the dhobi,
because he does iron them after
he finishes beating them against
the rocks.

 

After doing the laundry, I de-
cided to straighten up my room a
little bit. Since I live right next to
the college hostels (dormitories),
I do have various college servants
that come to my room each day
to do various cleaning jobs. One
cleans the bathroom every day;
another sweeps the floor about
every third day; still another one
brings me good drinking water.
makes my bed, and shines my
shoes. However, there are certain
other jobs, like dusting the furni-
ture and straightening up my
books, which must be done by me
or they don’t get done at all. This
means that most of the time they
don’t get done at all. but once in
a while I do get around to doing
these tasks.

At 4:30 this Saturday afternoon
a Catholic priest was scheduled to
talk to the college Student Christa
ian Movement. The SCM is made
up of all the Christian Protestant
students that go to school here
and is quite active, at least com-
pared to any similar groups at
Gl‘innell, Since I am an adviser
to this group, at about 4:25 I took
the bicycle the college has loaned
to me and pedalleti over to the
college’s beautiful new chapel.
When 1 arrived, the guest speak-
er was there, but not a student
was in sight. However, there was
no reason to panic, for such things
otten happen around here. Even in
my psychology class, which is sup-
posed to start at 7:30, I am never
able to start until 7:40 or even
later because the students don’t
arrive until then. After about It)
minutes to 5:00, torty or so students
had arrived, so We were able to
start the priest's talk.

to participate in the chapel ser-
vice tomorrow. Students read the
scripture lessons at the English
language chapel services each
Sunday morning, and it is my job
to see that the English used by
them when they read is reason-
ably understandable. This is an
easy job with some of the stu-
dents, but with others I have to
work quite hard and often never
really do succeed.

After spending about half an
hour with these students, I was
free to go back to room, talk to
some of the students informally,
and listen to the radio. A little
later, I went over to the Guest
House for my evening meal. After
my meal I walked over to the
middle of campus to watch an old
Gary Cooper movie which was be—
ing shown outside to the college
students, Marathi, Hindi, or Eng-
lish movies are shown on many
weekends during the year.

When the movie was over, I
went back to my room, recruited
some of the members of the hostel
English Society, and they and I
hustled over to the auditorium
and stage where we worked on a
couple of skits that were going to
be put on for Hostel Day on De-
cember 4th. The English Society is
a group of boys who are trying to
learn how to speak and think in
English better. Some of them
know English quite Well; others
have trouble expressing themsel-
ves in simple sentences. They
used to meet with me two or
three nights a week to hold dis—
cussions and give talks in Eng-
lish. Now we are working togeth-
er in order to ﬁgure out: how to
put on some skits for the rest of
the boys in the hostel.

After a short practice, we all
walked downtown to one of the
restaurants there so that we could
have some lunch. India has a great
variety of sweet and spicy snacks.
Although a few are a little too
spicy tor the Western tongue, most
of them are Very delicious. TD-
night I had some "gulab jambu“,
which are little egg-shaped wheat
cakes drenched in sugary syrup. or
course, as usual, a cup of tea an
companied the snacks. Then it
was time to head back to the col-
lege.

The boys split up, Some went
to bed; others had studying to do.
As ior myself, I can hardly keep
my eyes open. And when 1 think
about tomorrow morning, I am all
the more ready for bed. Two col<
lege boys from one of the color-tul
nomadic tribes that populate rur»
31 India, have promised to call at
my room at 6:30 am. and take
me to visit. some of their tribes-

Goddard Explains Proposed lie-vamp;

Efficient, Effective

By GERALD GODDARD
SGA President

It Is the business of student gov-
ernment above all else to govern
as efficiently and as effectively
as possible within the context of
the campus community. This must
be Its major task and it 15 toward
this end that student government
must move In the next few weeks,

The Executive Cabinet proposed
to the Senate Wednesday a plan
for general student government
reorganization which will reduce
the personnel and steps which now
impede a rapid response to im-
mediate problems. This plan re-
places the Senate with a joint
council of the AWS Board and the
CofI-IP and transfers to this council
the present Senate functions of
policy- tormation, budgeting, and
nominations. The result is that
those who are most immediately
affected by changes in student gov-
ernment policy, the Cam? and
the AWS Board, will play a total
role in the formation of that policy.
The structure of student govern-
ment is changed to the working
realities of the existing system,
concentrating power over policy
in those groups, the AWS Board
and CofHP, who actually carry
on the important business of stu-
dent government at Grinnell.

The functions of the SGA Presi-
dent and the Executive Cabinet Will
remain the same as under the pre—
sent system. They will continue
to serve as liason between student
government and college oitioials,
and coordinate the work of the
various offices and Committees of
student govemment.

After lengthy discussion in the
Senate over the court system, it
was tentatively decided to retain
the present system of three inde-
pendent courts rather than inte-
grate the primary court tunction
into the joint council.

The Executive Cabinet proposed
these changes in very general form

men who are camping on the out-
skirts of town. It will probably be
a very enjoyable experience, but
a good sleep in my bed seems
like it would be an even more en-
joyable experience right now. So,
aiter l iinish writing this last Sen~
teuce, t can take a quick bath
using the bucket of water that is
now heating on nty stove, and then
I can settle down on my hard bed
to dream about television, choice
beef steaks, hot Water heaters,
and homogenized milk, all of
which seem more like a tigment
at my imagination than anything
that really exists.

(ion on this matter. After all, it
would be nice it we had an issue.
in this year's SGA elections.”

Goddard closed the discussion by
naming Senators Barrow, Stracke,
and Ray Horn to help the Execu<
tive Cabinet draw up the formal
proposals.

In other Senate matters Wednes-
clay, Goddard announced that the
election for SGA president would
he Feb. 21, with the convention
on Feb. 19. Petitions for candida:
cy will be available Feb. 7 and
will be due Feb. 11.

Goddard also said that, cons
trary to opinion, the ﬁnal recom-
mendations ot the faculty Execu-
tive Council in regard to hall reor-
ganization had not been issued
yet. ).

AWS Board President Chris Pets
erson said that the possibilities of
late minutes for women (on the
order of 15 minutes per semester)
were being discussed with admins
istratlon officials. .

Lee Schmidt was confirmed as
student auditor, and Dan Macon
was okayed as assistant auditor.
Chuck Wall was elected to the post
of SGA treasurer; he replaces
Andy Bushnell. .

A resolution to subsidize SGA
presidential candidates for their.
campaign expenses was defeated.

During the discussion on the
matter, Senator Roger Clow noted
that there was no way of limiting
the number of candidates and
that any number might run just
to collect the subsidy.

Cllrls Peterson countered Clow’:
contention. saying, “I don’t see
that there is a chance that so many
people will run, because they aL
ways stand a chance oi be-
ing elected.”

The proposal was defeated. (les-
pite Miss Peterson's argument.
