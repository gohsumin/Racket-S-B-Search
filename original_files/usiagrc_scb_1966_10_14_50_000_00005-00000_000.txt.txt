dent cafeterias. and co-
tive stores.

World University Service op—
erates in more than sixty
countries in cooperation with
a number of United Nations of-
fices, including UNESCO, the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agricultural Organi-
zation, and the UN High Com-
missioner tor Refugees. it also
cooperates with the Interna-
tion Student Conference.

Vespers

A break from studying: tit.
teen minutes or contemplative
relaxation; an opportunity (or
meditation and introspection: a
chance to be alone with your
private pleasure or pain; each
student has his own viewpoint
toward Grinnell's vespersr

Vesper services are held by
candlelight every Tuesday and
Thursday evening trom 9:45 to
10:01]. Generally, the Tuesday
evening service is given over to
music, the one on Thursday
evening to some sort of read»
ing.

The Board of Religion has
stated that any student's con-
tribution is welcome. whether
he wishes to sing, play all in-
strument, read a poem, or
merely make a suggestion.
Each participant or participat-
ing group is given virtually
complete treedorn as to how it
arranges the service

Chaplain Haas has noted that
most Vesper services are well<
attended. and takes this as an
indication that students appre»
ciate them. While attendance is
reasonably high, however, lew
litudents have volunteered to
conduct the service.

The Board of Religion has
expressed the hope or holding
additional services each week,
if student response is sutii»
cientiy strong. The Board is
also considering the use of re:
corded music for some serv-
ices.

Costa Rica: Student Research Opportunities

By ANN KlRSCHNER

Three Grinnell students spent parts of last year in
Costa Rico in the slums, in agricultural youth groups and

among the Meiastomataceae
family.

Nancy Moritz, Charles Schnell
and Paul Thurston were partici‘
pants in the Central American
Field Program sponsored by the

Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west and the National Science
Foundation, The program is a
research project in the natural
and social sciences, based at
the Tropical Science Center in
San Jose, the capital oi Costa
Rica. ,

Miss Moritz, a sociology ma-
Jor, spent the entire year

working on two projects. The
first was entitled “Socio-Ecu
nomic Factors inﬂuencing the
Success ur Failure of 4-5 Clubs
in Two Costa Rican Villages."
(The 4-5 clubs are somewhat
equivalent to our 4-H clubs.) The
second, on which she collabo
rated with Betty Schnell, was
“Educational Attitudes and Am-
bitions of Mothers for Their
Children in Selected Areas of
San Jose." In this project they
took a sample item the “tuguri-
os” (slums) and compared it to
a middle-income sample. They
iound that the attitudes were
class-linked in that greater in-
come and higher education
among parents tended to pro—
mote stronger ambitions for

Mr. Schnell, a biology major,
conducted studies on the ecol»
ogy oi the Melastomataceae;
one or the larger plant families
in the world.

Rural-Urban Migration

Mr. Thurston, who was there
second semester, is a history
major who made a sociological
and economic study oi the
slums in San Jose. He concen-
trated (in patterns or ruralvur-
ban migration and on income-
cost analysis, interviewing 75
families, and inund that over
50% were born outside San
Jose This is generally believed
to be because people in the
rural areas think they will ﬁnd
a better life in the cities. There
are, however, instances of ur-
ban-rural migration. Costa Rica
does not have as concentrated
a slum area as other parts of
Latin America, in which it
ranks about 7th in riches. it is
the richest in Central America.

Stable Democracy

Costa Rica maintains a stable,
democratic political system.
President Trejos is pro-Ameri-
can. The last political disturb-
lance occurred in 1947 and since
then democratic elections have
continued normally. The Grin-
nellians were in San Jose for
the national election last year
and said that one of thelr land-
ladies dragged her mattress
around to the back of her house
because she didn’t believe that
there was not going to be a
revolution.

The size or West Virginia,
Costa Rica has a varied
geography. There are cold
mountainous areas as well as
tropical jungles. Students doing
studies in the natural sciences
did extensive traveling, and
those in other iields had oppor-
tunities to accompany them.

Robert F. Voertman, econom-
lcs. organized the program and
is the coordinator for all the
participating colleges. The re
are three permanent staff mem-
bers in San Jose and a rotating
staff from A.C.M. Each student
carries out his project under
three advisers.

The program is designed to
get students interested in work-

that the Agricultural Extension
Service helped her greatly in

merit; gaining self-confidence
and learning about independent
research, and having the oppor-
tunity to “step into another cuis
