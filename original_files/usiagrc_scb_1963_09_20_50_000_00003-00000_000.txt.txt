F mm For

As Grinnell’s only married beatnik entering
his fifth year at this institution, l have been
requested to write a short article, directed to»
wards the incoming freshmen. So here it is.

You freshmen have received a great deal of
,talk from various dignitaries during the past
two weeks, concerned with what your Liie at
Grinnell will be like, what percentage of you
can be expected to have a Positive Experience
here and so forth. 1 would like here to simply
add a small list of practical hints to the welter
of statistics and reassurances; I hope they will
he of some value to some of you.

Practical Hints
1) Don’t worry about your clothes.

2) Don't call up girls you don’t like and
ask them out,

3) If you are sitting in a room full of peo—
‘ple who are boring you, do not stay there
smoking innumerable cigarettes and trying to
think of anecdotes from your high school days.
Leave.

4) Don’t be afraid to eat breakfast alone.
5) Don‘t fall prey to the suspicion that all

Descent

upperclassmen know something you don’t.
6) Don’t turn anybody in.

7) Paint your own pictures, and hang them
on the wall.

8) Don’t wear a beanie, unless you ordinar—
ily wear a beanie. Nobody can do anything to
'yol}.

9) no not at any time assume the adminis—
tration of this school to be either unduly wise
or unduly benevolent, Be very careful when
committing serious crimes.

10) if you happen to be walking down the
sidewalk singing and someone approaches you
going the other way, don't stop singing.

Some of these things, notably numbers three,
eight, and ten, may prove to be very difficult.
If you think they prove too difficult, the remedy
for this is to screw your courage to the sticking'
point. Finally. in case anyone thinks I’m acting»
holier than thou l s’nould like it known that U
have been guilty of every error and negligence
outlined above; and the only reward l have for
all of it is the ability to compile a list like this,l
which I hereby bequeath to you, the class of 1967. i

Panel Agrees Nu

By Phil Bernstein

A coffee hour on the subzcct
of “Extra Curricular Activities:
Boon or Boondoggle?” was held
in Younker lounge on Wednes
day. Directed primarilyvat fresh-
men, the program was a panel
discussion in which SGA Pres-
ident Jack Chapman, IRC Pres»
ident Curt Lamb, Speaker. of the
Senate Ed Robbins and the Grin-
nell Student Peace Group lead-
er Nick Dicken debated the var
ious merits and drawbacks of
the extracurricular program at
Grinnell.

Chapman argued that there
are, on campus, too many clubs
and, as a result, most have
mediocre programs. ”Too few
Clubs." he said, “do anything
but bring in speakers for cof-

mber of Clubs I

Affects Good Program Planning

fee hours and lectures." He
added that many students at-
i tend these coffee hours only
‘ to escape from work.

This last point was echoed by
the other three panelists nl.
though they all pointed out that
the coffee hour could be a source
of intellectual stimulation on
campus if given better prepara—
tion.

Chapman’s remedy to the sit—
uation would be cut down on
the number of coffee hours and
to concentrate on a few well<
planned events each year.

Touching on the issue or SGA,
Chapman cited the mushroom-
ing bureaucracy that now
plagues our student government
in which nearly one out of four
Grinnellians serve in some ca—
,pacity.

 

Plan to Charter
European Flights

Two charter ﬂights to Europ
have been proposed to give Mid
west Conference students, ad
ministration personnel, and fac.
relatively inex—
pensive transportation to Europe.

A night originating in Chicago

and Frankfort, and there will
be a return flight in late August.

Another flight will leave Chi-
cago in late July and will re-
turn in late August. This ﬂight
will land in London and Paris.

The estimated cost for the

in late June will ﬂy to London:

ﬂights is between $320 and $35M
