Five Students Face FCSA
0n Illegal Visitation Charge

Three Langan hall students Wednesday
night were given the option of withdrawing
from school or being dismissed, and two
Read hall students were suspended for the
remainder of the academic year as the
result of an incident last Friday night when
the ﬁve were found together in one of the
men's rooms after hours by Dean of Men
5, Eugene Thompson and Assoclate Dean
Richard Wintel‘s.

The penalties, as issued by the faculty
committee on student allairs, were original-
ly to have included the dismissal of the
men and optional withdrawal by the women,
but individual appeals to the FCSA led to
a lessening of the punishments.

All five students will be allowed to peti-

 

 

 

 

 

 

tion the committee for the right to take
final examinations for this semester in
absentia.

According to Thompson, he and Winters
had informed Langan president Richard
Relchmann that sometime in the future they
would come to the hall to look for tran-
sients who were believed to be staying with
students in Langan basement. Relchmann
said that earlier that Friday he had told
residents of the basement that Thompson
might come over at any time.

When the two deans arrived, they found
the ﬁve students. Because the five were
apprehended by administration officials, the
Case went immediately to the FCSA instead
of to the student courts.

Yolk’s on SAGA, Bul Eggheads Fry

The first conduct probation pen—
alties of the year were handed out
recently by the Dean of Men’s oi-
ficc to tour north campus residents
who splattered eggs in the Saga
office in Cowles hall late last
month. ,

S. Eugene Thompson, dean of
men, said that the four — two sen-
iors, and or junior, and a sopho-
more « returned to campus and
messed up the ollice after town
police had apprehended them for

throwing eggs at automobiles in
downtown Grinnell. ‘

Police filed no charges against
the tour, although they reported
the incident to Thompson. Thomp-
son learned of their involvement in
the Sega office incident when he
questioned the four about the down
town episode,

One senior was placed on pro-
bation tor the rest of the school
year. The others will be on proba-
tinn until the end of the semester.

 

North Campus Problem
Assessment Underway

By BOB HODIERNE

Discussion Conolnuas about the
“North Campus Problem" wheth-
er it exists and, if it does, what
to do about it.

Grinnell’s President Glenn Leg-
gelt said in an intervtew last
week that “Dean Winters and I
both are persuaded that the res-
idence hull system is working well
in some halls and not so well in
others."

“The ‘North Campus Problem’
has a variety of causes, some ol
which have no relation to the res-
idenco hall system," said Dr. Leg-
gett, Some of the causes he liso
ed included a small town loca-
tion, the level or academic pres-
sure, nonexistent supervision ex-
cept by students, students having
been reared in a permisslve at-
mosphere, and pressure from
the general state of the world,
especially the threat that the war
in Viet Nam presents to college
men.

When asked if he was dlSSEtlSe
lied With the way the Student
Government Association had en-
larced rules, Dr. Leggett said,
“Yes, In some cases. But what I
don’t know is if it's the system
or unfortunate leaders."

The Executive Council of the
laculty, which has been discussing
the problem “very informally”
for about a month now, feels that
“anti-intellectualism is pretty pre-
valent on north campus," ac-
cording w Dr. Leggett. “There is
excessive moral neutrality in the
residence hall system," he added.

Calling himself an “idealist."
Dr. Leggett said the halls ought

 

to “satisfy two needs-one practi-
cal, one idealistic."

The practical needs, said Dr.
Leggett, include being “quiet o-
nough for study, orderly and tidy
enough to be clean, and well
enough regulated idl- respect for
privacy, personalities, and prop-
am,”

The idealistic needs of the halls
as outlined by Dr. Leggeit includ-
ed a reflection at the “ongoing
academic and educational pm-
gram, The transition from class,
library and lectures to hall life
should be natural. It should not be
from one life to another."

The president went on to say,
in the same idealistic vein, that
“there Should be a feeling of a
community of young scholars."

He also stressed that he is
“eager not to be represented as
a man who has a ‘thing' about
the residencs nail system.“

Several o! the proposals that
have been discussed by the Exec
utive Council at one time or an-
other included arranging the halls
by class. One suggestion was to
put all the freshmen together in
several halls With upperclass ad-
visers. A second suggestion would
have had the seniors living to
gelher with relaxed housing regu-
lations. "I haven't heard much
about lihese proposals recently,"
said Dr. Leggett.

Dr. Leggett commented that
whatever change is selected—
and it seems certain that some
change will be made—the “Valid-
ity of the program should relate
to how it improves the education<
al almosphere and not be just a
group of ‘don'ts‘ for students."

Grinnell Sends Twenty Students to D.C.
To Join March Aguinsl Viel Nam War

20 Grinnell students left Wednes~
day afternoon on a chartered bus

ing immediate ceasefire and de-

Realm of FCSA in Changes
Confined lo Mere 'Courl'esy'

“Our role in the proposed
changes in the hall system is min-
imal. I think we are being con-
sulted out at courtesy more than
anything else," said John Burma
(sociology). chairman of the lac-
ulty committee on student affairs.

Burma sald this Week that his
committee has been discussing
possible changes in hall structure
and that witllin two weeks the
FCSA will make a recommenda-
tion to the Executive Council of
the faculty.

President Glenn Leggett has
asked the Executlve Council to
make a wide-ranging investigation
of the present hall set-up at Grin-
hell.

Burma noted that the FCSA will
be consulted in the event that any

pants will be made shortly.

 

hall system reorganization should
require concomitant changes in
such areas as the student courts.

Ed. note: In the Oct. 15,1965,
issue of the 5&3, Burma said
that his committee saw its
major duty in the area or pol~
lcy rather than in speciﬁcs.

The FCSA, he said, would not
handle such matters as a pos-
sible exlension of women‘s
hours by 30 minutes on Friday
nights, but “we would be con-
cerned with a possible change
lrl hall system pollcyl”
