FIFTY -T0 DES MOINES RALLY

Fiity Grinnell students par-
tlcipated in a peace march in
downtown Des Moines Monday
alternoon. The group was joined
by about forty students from
other central Iowa colleges, i
cluding Simpson and the U11
versity of lawn.

Senior James 5. (“Trip“)
Kennedy III was one at six stil—
dents who deposited their draft
cards at the 11.5. Marshal’s oi-
iice in the Federal CourthOUSE.
East First and Walnut streets.

Although the Grinnell contin-
gent was the largest. the march
was coordinated by students
irnm Iowa City. including
Bruce Clark, head of the S.D.S.
group there.

Leaﬂets protesting the Viet
nam war and announcing the
march were distributed at two
Des Moines high schools and in
the downtown area.

The march began with a
rally at Riverside park, where
the demonstrators were ad-
dressed by five speakers. More
than a dozen students from Des
Moines Technical High School
(one of the leaﬂetted schools)
attended the rally. Several of
the students heckled, while
others discussed the protest
with demonstrators. Most oi the

high school students Iavored
the war.

During the rally. the Vice-
principal oi Tech arrived and
announced to the high school
students that they were all sus-
pended Ior cutting classes.

The demonstrators walked
north toward the courthouse at
about two o‘clock under the
eyes of newsmen and plain.
clothes detectives. A University
or lowa ireshman. Dale Repp.
dressed in a black cloak and
carrying a scythe, led the
march.

While the demonstrators Wait-
ed outside the courthouse, U.S.
Marshal Charles Eendlage told
the group turning in their selec—
tive service credentials that he
was not authorized to accept
the cards. The cards were
placed on the oiiice counter and
the students left.

Alter the departure oi the
students, the cards were turned
over to assistant us. attorney
Jerry Williams. Neither he nor
Bendlage had any comment as
to the disposition of the mate-
rial, althcugh it was believed
that the cards would be turned
over to the F.B.l, who would
nctily state draft boards and
the selective service ofﬁce in
Washington.

 

 

The demonstrators w a l k e d
through downtown Des Moines
to Tech High School, to protest
the suspension ol the students
at the rally. it was reported
later that the Students would
not. be suspended, but would be
given detention Ior classes
missed, the usual penalty for
cutting.

When high school students
left the building at 3:30 pm.
they were conironted with post-
ers and leaflets opposing the
war. The issue of their fellow
students who had cut classes
was confused by lack of iniora
matinn and the inability oi the
demonstrators to communicate
with the students as fast as
they emptied from the high
school.

In the heckling and shouting
that Iolluwed, several posters
and leaflets were set on ﬁre
by high school students.

After most of the students
had left the building, and the
crowd diminished in size, sev-
eral demonstrators were able
to have quiet discussions ivith
Tech students. The demonstra-
tors departed about tour
D'chck.

During the entire altemoan
there were no incidents or ar-
rests.

GRILL ELEVEN ON WATCHED POT

POLICE QUESTION STUDENTS
ON CAMPUS DRUG USE

Eleven Grinnell students re-
ceived a jolt Wednesday alter-
noon when they were questioned
by the local police concerning
drug usage.

At least Iiiteen students were
"iniormally asked to come down
and answer questions," the Stu-
dent Senate was told at a regu-
lar meeting in ARH Wednesday
night.

Eleven were questioned, ac-
cording tD Police Chief Bill Pet-
ers.

“Today about 2 p.m. we start-
ed having Grinnell students take
en down to the local police and
questioned about drug usage.”
Student Government Associa-
tion president Ric MacDowell
told the Senate.

MacDoWell said that these
persons were “apparently sus-
pected oi being regular man'-
juana users." He added that the
local police merely warned
them and said that ”this is be-
ing done by the city. not the
State or Federal Government."

Chief Peters said he “just
called down a tow people to tell
them there had better not be
any people smoking marijuana
on the Grinnell campus.“ He
added that he read the law con-
cerning marijuana to the eleven
be questioned.

Students who said they were
interviewed by the Grinnell
police told the 5&8 that. they
were asked it they smoke mari—
juana. it they knew at other
“users." and if they knew who
was selling “put" on campus.

They were then contronted

anything. Almost 200 people.
mostly middle-aged townspeople
and little kids, came out to be
stirred by 50 per cent at the
cheerleading squad. It has been
said that you shouldn't bring
your high school days with you
to Grinnell and that’s true.
Every high school basketball
game ever seen by this re-
porter had at least a quarter
of the student body present.

At Grinnell, if you can lire
up do per cent at the people
tor something it’s a real big
deal. Everybody is so involved
with something or other con-
cerning themselves that very
lew have time to come out and
cheer someone playing or fight-
ing to uphold their school’s
honor. Instead at talking about
how bad the teams are, why
not help them do something for
the college. Stop waiting for the
college to deliver everything to
you.

with a list of students' names
and asked ii anyone on the list
smoked or sold marijuana.

Asked where he got the list.
Chief Peters told the 581B: “A
bird gave it to me." He re-
fused to name the individuals
on the list.

“We are here to keep people
out of trouble," Peters said,
“but if we’re pushed there’s
going to be a lot of triuble.”

Peters added that the students
he questioned did not seem
“particularly impressed.”

Dean Thompson told the 5&5
late Wednesday that he had
not scheduled meetings With
either the police or with any
of the students involved, but
added ”I suppose I’ll be hearing
{rum the students scan.”

MacDowell told the senators
that the college was not “a guar-
dian" when it came to drugs.
“The college cannot protect
you.” he said.

“If you know people on the
outskirts OI the drug traltic
scene at Grinnell," MacDolyeIl
told the representatives or the
student government. “please tell

 

them to keep quiet. This Is the
kind of thing that could lead
to Search and arrest on cani-
pus.”

Rumor and apprehension was
widespread Thursday as SGA
members and students discussed
the possibility oi narcotics
agents being on campus.

By noon Thursday seven
“concerned individuals" had
called the 5&3 Difices. most of
them seeking to ”play down
drugs here and cool it.”

One of the callers wanted
information as to whether stu-
dents had a right to reluse to
answer questions when inter-
viewed by the police.

A drug statement tram the
Deans’ Otiices Issued at. Grin-
nell in September stated that
the college "intends to regard
any student lound to be can.
tributing to the (drug) problem
by misuse or drugs or contribut-
ing to others' misuse 0t drugs
as . . . subject to separation
from the College.”

Studenls invited to the local
police oliice for questioning are
urged to seek legal counsel.
