'loolr Back In Anger' Competent,
Kurascli Says in Review of Play

By Don Kurasch

This week's performance of
John Osbome’s “Look Back In
Anger” was adequately dramatic,
occasionally convincing, but a
had choice of plays to present. The
three actors and two actresses in
this Donahoerdirected drama were
always at least competent, and
occasionally bordered on th e
excellent.

The play was obviously directed
toward an English audience. as it
dealt with certain frustrating con-
ﬂicts regarding class conscious-
nessr The plot revolved around
Jimmy Porter, 3 man from the
lower Classes, an educated man
who married into a higher class,
yet who feels more comfortable
in the presence of Cliff, a close
friend of his Own social stratum.
A rather complete knowledge of
English society and education
would have been necessary to ap-
preciate the impact of this par.
ticular play.

Mike Arnow played Jimmy. Ar-
now’s difficult task was to por-
tray 3. sadistic, frustrated. angry
young man without numbing his
audience to the effect of his con-
stant, often drone~like invective.
This he accomplished through his
actions, as when he was playing
his little games with Cliff, when

ture, or when walking into the
area of the audience to stare
through an imaginary window.
Though occasionally the staging of
his antics was too obvious, the
overall effect of maintaining the
audience's attention was achieved.

“Lovely" was Lucia Lynner’s
nickname in the play, and as Jim<
my’s wife she was indeed that.
The attractive actress had merely
to be there in the presence of
Jimmy's vituperation to evoke the
audience’s sympathy. And in the
first act, with her often-weak de-
liverance of lines and unmotivated
outbursts, this was the only basis
for that sympathy.

A slightly stronger version of
Lovely was evident in the second
act Miss Lynner's return to the
scene of her best friend embrac—
ing her spouse was powerful, and

the climactic follow-up, when she
crawled in anguish into the arms
of her husband, was the highlight
both of the play and or Miss Lyn-
ner‘s own pedormance.

Deb Bernstine‘s portrayal of
Helena was adequate, though she
never quite proved to be the
“bitch" Jimmy called her before
her arrival. To act convincingly as
one capable ot controlling the
separation and reunion of Jimmy
and Allison, 115 she did, a slightly
5 t r o n g e r characterization was
called for.

As the third corner of an un-
usual triangle, Max Helfgott, in
the role of CH“, did a good job.
Though he occasionally tell prey
to such sluw scenes, as when he
bandaged Allison's arm and was
nearly impossible to hear, Helfgott
convinced the audience of his

equal concern for both of the main
characters.

by Dick Reichmann. Reichmann’s
voice was too young and breathy,
though his slow movements and
fatherly concern bordered on the
believable.

“Look Back In Anger” was a
bad play to do, but a good one to
do in Arena Theatre The set and
lighting were simple, but apropos
to the stark, simple reality of Os-
borne’s play. It was a play, not
so much of plot, but of ideas and
characterization — and at least in
terms of characterization. the ac-
tors and actresses did pull it off.
