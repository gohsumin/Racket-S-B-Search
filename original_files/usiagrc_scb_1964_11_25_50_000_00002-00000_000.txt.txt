As We See If .V . .

The hurried week-end of meetings and so-called “news-
breaks” has kept members of the Scarlet and Black staff on
the run. Our first and last intention was to give our readers
a comprehensive view of what had occurred without dealing in
the extensive realm of emotion or supposition. Pressed by an
early publication date due to the holiday this week, we are at
this time unable to comment in full in any analysis of events,

' nor are we even sure that such commentary is necessary. We
feel that we have given the students and the administration a
fair representation in our news columns. We are now waiting
to see what might further develop. For the time being we will
stand as follows:

The Committee on Student Affairs acted within its juris-
diction when lt dealt with the South Younker case. Likewise,
members of student government acted in good faith in their
attempts to achieve what they considered the fullest measure
of justice for the students involved in the penalty. We do not
at this time see any need for alarm concerning the administra-
tion’s possible usurpation of student government powers. In
the event of a future crack-down on rule enforcement at the
college, we can- see the role of student government changing,
but we would not necessarily object to such a change. To those
students most directly involved, with due respect for their
honest concern with serving their fellows to the best of their
ability, we would only issue a reminder that they are still
Itudents, with an educational objective that does not include

running the college.

ICARLET AND ILACK

To the Editor:

Do you suppose a mossy, ex-
Grinnell jock (non - intellectual
type) would dare engage Paul
Trigg in an academic discourse re-
garding his November lath Scarlet
Fever article? l'm wondering if
such former Grinuell lettermen as
Gar Smith, Dick Orchard, Kirk
VanRoyan, Denny Asby, Bill Par-
sons, Bob Musser, etc. are of the
non-academic type athletes Paul
Trigg is talking about? it is hard
for me to believe that these indi-
viduals (and I can think of many
more) were the hon-intellectual
jock' variety when they arrived on
campus; possibly, during their on-
suing 'stay at Grinnell, they be-
came intellectuals?

Let us take the Championship
1960-61 basketball squad as an ex-
ample, According to my personal
knowledge (1 did get to know most
of them personally) about to per
cent of them went on to acceptable
graduate schools. ls thisnonAaca-
demic image? Could these Honor
G athletes be of the jockrimage
Coach Bowers and the School Bul-
letin purport to convey to the gen-
eral public? Following Grinnell
football rather closely these past 4
5 years now, becoming acquainted
with most of the squad members as
I have, i would hazard a guess
that something less than l per cent
(and I believe you will find even
Carleton with the same percent«
age) of these squad members
might be classified in the ‘Trigg’
category of questionable, Honor 6,
image-type athlete. Possibly Paul
Trigg's definition of non-intellectual
lock is different than mine.

Regarding the geographical syn-

opsis: in looking over a Carleton
1962-63 basketball program, find
over 75 per cent of their squad
from the states of Minnesota and
Illinois. Coach Young’s 1963 track

roster reveals 32 athletes listed, 11
states represented and 12 members
from the state of laws. Maybe
trackmen aren’t considered in the
lock category? Or has anyone seen
soul-rent Lawrence football roster
and noticed the people from the
state of Wisconsin? (Yes, I think
most academicians would consider
Lawrence in the same class with
Carleton and Grinnell). Living as
close to Northfieid, Minn. as l have
these past two years and being
somewhat alert to Midwest Confer-
ence athletic activities, i am more
acquainted with the Carleton ath-
letic image and their recruiting
practices (i use the term loosely).

Despite the fact that Grinnell has
a ‘Special interests‘ man in their
admissions office, lbelieve you will
find little or no difference in the
two schools approach to prospec-
tlva high school students be it ath-
lete or otherwise. By the way, be
sure and notice a rather talented,
rangy sophomore center on this
year’s Carleton basketball team;
he comes from (all places!) Cros-
by—lronton, Minnesota, and I as-
sure you he was courted and
lunched just like any 800 board-
score prospect. Wonder if we
should question Carleton (our
chief academic rival) or whether
scholarship or admission was
granted on strictly academic
grounds?

functions for a long period of

 

 

time).

The provisions for conduct
probation, as stated in the Stu-
dent Handbook are as follows:

"Conduct probation is a rec-
agnition of general lack of co-
operation in citizenship, or the
breaking of some specific rule.
The terms of this probation are
defined in each case by the ad-
ministrative ofﬁcials imposing
the probation penalty.

“This probation is a warning
that severe discipline will be
imposed if a student is again
reported for a similar lack of
cooperation or for violation of a
social rule of the college.”

In the case or South Younker,
the provisions of the probation
will be the following. A letter
announcing the probation will
be sent to the student and his
parents, and will be placed in
the files of the student in the
Dean’s office. The members of
the hall who hold campus of—
fices will be allowed to keep
them. The period of probation
will continue until June 4, 1965,
at. which time the letter will he
removed from the files. The
probation in no way affects a
student’s permanent record. it
does, however, mean that a
major violation of the rules of
the college during this time

would place him under consid-
eration for suspension.

The Dean of Men explained
that this penalty was felt by the
committee to rest heavily on
”those who are accident
prone," and have little or no
effect on those students who
make it a habit to obey the col-
lege rules anyway. He ex-
plained that the college has to
provide a deterrent for gross
violations, and that with this
action by the FCSA, "the word
is informally out that the col-
lege stands ready to dismiss
students, if necessary, for
gross violations of its rules."

“There is no such thing as
hall responsibility in the ab-
stract sense,” he said the com-
mittee decided. “It's always
people's violations," Ha furth-
er explained that this particu-
lar penalty was felt to be the
“only way of designating re-
sponsibility to the people there
rather than to the hall as a
theoretical concept. Fining the

hall is not a good way to dis- ‘ ‘

charge the social responsibility.
Removing s o c i 31 privileges
wouldn‘t fill the educational
purpose of a penalty."

Letters to the Editor
Parents Reply lo Trigg on ‘Non-lnlelleclual Jock'

To the Editor:

As a parent of an athlete at
Grinnell, I feel compelled to reply
to Mr. Trigg's column in the No-
vember 13 issue, attacking the
Grinnell athletes. i am trying to
be restrained in my reply, hoping
that Mr. 'i‘rigg was writing with
tongue-incheek, but I am desper-
ately afraid he was not. His ooh
umn carries the wistful hope that
Grinnell is somehow, in some mam
ner, comparable to Carleton, No
amount of hoping will change the
awful truth.

i am also a parent of a recent
Carleton graduate and athlete. The
second son, although welcomed to
Carleton because of respectable
College Board scores unfortunately
(in my opinion) chose Grinnell, He
received no scholarship, no aid, no
nothing. He is still receiving noth-
ing. Nothing in educational com-
petence and nothing in leadership
guidance or support either from
the administration or from his col-
leagues.

Mr. Trigg believes that Grinnell
would be improved by a larger per-
centage of lowa’s com-fed, 800 plus
College Board-students. Mr. Trigg
is wrong. Grinnell is suffering and
suffocating from its present 600
to 700 plus students from the great
com state. The school, the Scarlet
and Black, the students and the
administration already have too
much com, Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Stanford and others seem to be
surviving with a fair supply of ath-
letes from lilinois.(as well as other
states) who, in addition to being
able to discipline themselves suf-
ficiently to participate in athletics,
also have l.Q.'s comparable to the
best “hybrids” from Iowa.

If Grinnell has any future, and
after seeing it sag for three years
i doubt if it has, it lies in those
students who meet its undeservedly
high academic standards and still
have time and desire enough to
want to have some physical compe-
tence and competition. Carleton
and the other good schools seem to
recognize this. Even the University
of Chicago, my aima mater.
learned the same thing, the hard
way.
