House Leader
To Talia Here

November 17713 will bring this
politician in residence—
Carl Albert, House Majority Leada
er, whose major topic has been
tentatively set as the role of a
majority leader in promoting ad-
ministration legislation.

Tile 5’4” Rhodes scholar and nan
tive of Bug Tussle (since renamed
Flowery Mound), Okla., deals With
what Time dubbed “the most lop-
sided Democratic Congress since
the one that convened in 1937.”

After winning his first election
to the House in 1946. Albert
crossed the Red River to visit and
be advised by Sam Rayburn who
informed him that “muse that go
along, get along.” Albert duly apr
plied himself, studied the House
and its members carefully, and
became Whip in 1955.

The Program in Practical Politi-
cal Education is also considering a
conference on poverty, to be led
by Congressman Quie from Minne-
sets in late October, but this is
contingent on the date Congress ad-
joums.

 

Report on Encampment Released;
Student Responsibility Discussed

Now that the Encampment Plan-
ning Committee has issued a report
on the conclusions reached by the
five discussion groups, the aver-
age Grinnell student can also mull
over the problems or lite on the
campus,

The encampment at Boone Sept.
i7-i9 seemed to center attention
more on trying to understand gen-
eral problems rather than pre-
senting concrete proposals.

One of the major problems dis-
cussed was that of student re-
sponsibility. The group on Hall
Lite said in the final report that
more freedom from the college as
a whole was desirable. One way
to help achieve this, they decided,
was through open dorms. It was
realized, however, that greater
confidence would have to exist be
tween students and administration
before this would be feasible. A-
long this same line, the committee
was hopeful that action could be
taken to obtain more college wag-

‘. . . Virginia Woolf?’ Receives Special Recognition

By CONNIE SIMON

Freshman Theatre Workshops
performances, presented in Arena
Theatre this week, gave, on the
whole, the impression that there
is plenty or acting potential at-
mong this year’s crop oi dramatic
hopefuls.

In all, four scenes from {our dif-
ferent plays were presented.
These included Murray Schisgal’s
Luv, Arthur L. Kopit's 0h Dad,
Poor Dad, Jean Kerr's Mary, Mary
and Who‘s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf? by Edward Albee. The
quality of individual performances

varied a good deal, as could be ex-
pected, although at least one out
standing performer appeared in
each scene.

The indisputable climax of the
evening came at the end, however
with the performance of Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 0n the
basis of overall fine characterize»
tions, dramatic intensity. and
depth of portrayal, this scene and
the people involved in it deserve
special recognition.

The scene, which required an
enormous amount of sophistication
and understanding on the part oi
its cast and director. involved the

portrayal of numerous challenging
emotions and the like. Brenda
Thomas, who had the female lead,
played the part of an alcoholic
woman driven almost mad be-
cause of her own sterility. Others
in the play, Bill Downey, Debby
Abbott, and Dennis Rich, were re
quired to create equally complex
illusions in the form of difficult
character portrayals The scene
was ably directed by Dennis
Rich, a junior drama major, who
also took over the role at George
in the play when the person orig-
inally cast became unable to per-
form. ,

ans and/or to liberalize the drlvl
ing regulations,

The possibility ot integrated
campuses was discussed by both
the committees on Hall Life and
The College and the Students,
Under the present system, the
only areas for relaxed coreducar
tional contact are the classrooms,
the library, and the Forum. By
integrating the campuses these
areas would be enlarged to include
going back and forth to classes,
dining. and meeting informally in
the residence lounges.

Perhaps the most provocative
solution offered was that of divid-
in the campus between lower
division (freshmen and sophos
mores) and upper division (itin-
iors and seniors). Such a plan, it
was felt, would abolish the present
artificial division by sex. Separate
regulations would be established,
allowing the college to place some-
what restrictive regulations on
underclassmen, but also permit:
ting a greater degree of freedom
to the upperclassmen.
