Aleksandai‘ Petkovic, Yugosla-
vian journalist and world traveler,
commented on Communist Youth
Organizations, the Yugoslavian ate
tempt to walk a tight line between
the East and west. Gel-man reun-
ification, and Viet Nam during a
question and answer period with
interested students last Friday af~
ternoon. As Fetkovu: exclaimed,

Petkovw feels that the war in
Viet Nam is more serious today
than ever before. He said that the
divisions in Viet Nam and Korea
have resulted from the divisions
of the world. “Before we can end
the division of the world, we must
end the smalirscale divisions."

He [eels that Viet Nam should
be left to her own people, without

it was “like a Washington press
conference !”

The Alliance of Yugoslavian
Youth is a politically educational
mass movement, strongest in cit-
ies and schools, he explained. As
members it boasts unerfourth oi
the population between the ages
of 15 and 20.

As the result or a continuing
independent policy, Yugoslavia
has been able to “balance" be-
tween East and West. Her first
interest is peace in the world as
a basis {or International politics;
the second is traditional national
pride

interference from China or the
United States. They should have
the full freedom to decide for
themselves.

Petkovlc commented thoughtful-
ly that a strong, whole Germany
has been the cause of two World
Wars, A new, united Germany
could cause the third. He said that
though France and England claim
they want a united Germany, deep
down they feel dilierently. They
both want to be leading powers
and a reunited Germany would be
athreat.

When asked to comment on Yu-
goslavia’s position on the Russo»
Chinese split, Pelkovic said that
Yugoslavia is constantly split with
somebody, and olten within her-
self. The split, he said, “is has“?
ally in an international labor and
Communist movement." China
thinks war and revolution is the
only way to peace; Yugoslavia‘s
policy is based on active peaceiul
coexistence and the advance of
the world to socialism.

Petkavic observed that youth
normally dislikes discipline and

slavia everyone of age, who is
healthy, is drained. They remain
in the military ior lrom one to
three years, determined by the ser-
vice in which they enl|SL

There is no censorship in Yugo
