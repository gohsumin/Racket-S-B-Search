Candles Plus Hawk
Equal No Romance

To The Editorl

There is one place on this
Bampus where small groups of
people can gather in privacy
and comfort for a relaxing
evening away from the usual
atmosphere of this campus: in

one of the private dining rooms

in the Forum. So one night
four of us tried this new treat
and found it leaving too much
to the imagination.

In a futile attempt to create a
romantic atmosphere (the effort
is limited by a large picture
window facing a sidewalk and
Burling Library, through which
you can see your friends pass-
ing by and the library where
you really ought to be studying),
we planted a large candle on
the dining room table and ex-
tinguished the lights. After din<
nor and clean-up, we settled in
The dining room for a leisurely
evening of bridge. We discov-
ered that this one candle was
sufficient to see iihe cards by,
so we left the other lights out
in the dining room but did leave
the light on in the connecting
kitchenette.

After a brief interval, the
peace of the evening was
shattered by a piercing poundr
ing on the door, followed by a
sharp command, “Lights have
to be on at all times."

Now I will grudgingly admit
that some light is apparently
necessary to protect the female
members of our college society
from being violated against
their wishes. Yet it is a verifi-
able fact (that even the most
minimum of light in such a
mom allows all who would pass
by the expansive window the
opportunity to witness every
movement (or lack thereof) of
the occupants. The necessity of
having some large light beam-
ing into our faces seems ridicur
lous, as well as successfully
destroying any Romantic (note
the capital letter) dreams we
may have about life, love, and
candlelight dinners.

I have been told that the
Forum Committee never dis-
cussed this point or agreed
on this policy. If this is so, then
I hope that the students on the
committee will request such a
discussion.

And even if in some brief mo.
ment of antirRomantic madness
they unwittingly agree to such
a policy, I hope that in retro-
spect they will review their de
cision and reverse it.

Until then, many Hawkish
eyes protect our fair young
maidens from any undesired
violation of their innocence.

Quickie Cook's Tour of LeMoyne
Relayed from S&B Correspondent

Ed. Note: This is the second
of a series of articles by
Cynthia Brust, one of the
four Grinnell students par-
ticipating in an exchange pro—
gram at LcMoyne College
this semester.

“Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen! Welcome to the
Cook’s tour of the LeMoyne
College campus. Tile time is
now 9:00. We will complete our
tour in sixnandvarhalf minutes,
and then proceed with our tour

of Memphis itselfr Follow me,
please . . ."

And it could be done in six
and a half minutes, tor the cam-
pus is tiny. Even if we stop at
the green house Where Mike
and Jim live, and walk up the
street to the 4-Way Grill where
we eat when we don’t want to
cook, we could make it; in 10
minutes. But come with me on
a Grinnell tour instead, and
really look at LeMoyne Col-
lege.

We’ll start from Walker Ave-
nue, and enter the campus un
der the arch which tells the
world that this is LeMoyne.
Across a plot of grass strugr
gling to turn green is the impos-
ing Brownlee Halll This is the
architectural and academic
center of campus. Most of the
classrooms and all of the ad-
ministration offices are here, as
well as the bookstore and a stu-
dent lounge. It is built like a
Souuhern mansion, complete
with four columns in front In»
side the main door is the foyer.
And the bulletin board. When-
ever you want to spend time,
or want to find out something,
this is the place. This bulletin
board is noon announcements,
the post office throwaways,
and the 5&8, mlled into one.

Back out on campus, we turn
left and find Steele Hall, the
science building. Since I make
it a practice to stay away from
places like that, i haven’t the
vaguest idea what it's like.
Maybe someday one of the boys
will tell you.

Across from Steele Hall is

the Hollis F. Price Library, the
pride of the campus. This is
where you go if you are looking
for anyone. The inside of the
tworstory library is dominated
by a gigantic mural which
faces the doorl Created by Ben
Shahn, it Carries the biblical
verse which begins, “Behold
how good it is for brethren to
dwell together in peace.” It’s
a beautiful and fascinating piece
of art; you can spend hours
staring at it instead of reading.

Diagonally across campus,
near where we began, is Presi-
dent Price’s home. It is red
brick, and built very much like
Brownlee, but without the pil-
lars. Next is an old gray frame
house which serves as the So-
cial Science Building. It also
houses the only art lab room on
campus, and a few professors.

And then the Commons.
(That's their fancy word for
Union.) The cafeteria occupies
one room, and the rest of the L»
shaped structure holds tables,
chairs, and a juke box that is
hardly ever silent, Lunch time
is the time for socializing on
this campus, and no one just
