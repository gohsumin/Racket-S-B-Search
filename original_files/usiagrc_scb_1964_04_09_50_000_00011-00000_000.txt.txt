About twenty-five Grinnell College students trekked out to
the Grinnell High School gym Monday night to see what
could probably be called one of the most exciting, or at least
most “starvstudded” basketball games of the 1963-64 season.

The benefit game saw the Iowa All»Stars, led by Drake
star McCoy McLemore down the Iowa Hawkeye seniors by
a score of 81-68. The game was played before a crowd of
about 400 spectators who were able to see some of the state's
best basketball players in action.

The contest, sponsored by the Grinnell Jaycees, was a
money raising project for the Dr. Robert Norton Fund. Dr.
Norton, son of Grinnell Professor Homer Norton, operates a
hospital in the Me Kong Delta of Viet Nam, only a few miles
from much of the guerrilla warfare.

The Grinnell Chamber of Commerce, along with the Grin-
nell Ministerial Association has undertaken this project to
raise $7,500 to help pay for much needed equipment and slip»
plies for Dr. Norton’s hospital.

The lineup for the All-Stars included Grinnell‘s co-cap-
tains Jim Mifflin and John Sundell, McLelnore, Billy Foster,
and Ray Quinn (ex-Drake) of Drake University, and John
Carle, former little All-American from Central College. Mif—
flin and Sundell both were chosen to the All-Conference first
team the Midwest Conference, and McLemore was named
to the All-Conference first team this year in the tough Mis-
souri Valley Conference.

The lowa Hawkeye Seniors fielded a team consisting
of Dave Roach, Joe Reddington, Paul Krause, Bill Skea, Terry
Lyon, and John Raffensberger. All but Krause and Raffens—
berger were members of this year‘s ‘University of Iowa has»
ketball team. Raffensberger was a star at State College of
Iowa several years ago, and Krause starred as a flanker back
on Iowa’s football team, Krause was picked as second round
draft choice by the Washington Redskins of the National Foot-
ball League. -

The main bit of excitement calne in the pregame drills
as 6’9” Ray Quinn, decked out in red knee-high stockings and
With red shoelaces in his white basketball shoes, dunked the
ball a little too hard and broke the glass backboard. The game
finally got underway after a half an hour delay to replace the
backboard.

The first half found the two teams fairly evenly
matched, neither team hitting too well from the floor, and the
half ended with the score at 34-34.

_Early in the second half the Alletars took over the lead
behind the hot shooting of McLemore and the long jump
shots, and the fancy ball handling of Drake’s Billy Foster. The
final gun sounded with the All-Stars well in front, 81-68.

Baseball Team to Open Conference Season

By Jack Harrod

Desplte the return of his
veteran pitching staff, Pioneer
baseball coach John Pfitsch
rests his hopes for the 1964 sea-
son on the development of his
crew of sophomores, five of
whom were in the lineup for the
season opener against Central
College last Wednesday.

The experienced mound corps
is led by Denny Hanssen, one
of the best hurlcrs in the con-
iel'ence last year. Hanssen won
only three of eight decisions in
1963 but compiled a fine L40
ERA While allowing just 36 hits
in 64 innings on the mound. He
also struck out 75.

Another junior, Barry M. An
derson, picked up the remain
ing Grinnell win while losing
three and recorded a 3.10 ERA.

Cal Collier, one of only a
handfull of seniors on the
squad. is counted on to bounce
back to the topilight form of his
sophomore year. Last season

 

Collier had his share of trouble
and ended up 074.

All three pitchers are Solid
hitters and can also double in
the outfield or at first base.

Steve Tilly, the top thrower
for the fresh last year, adds
extra punch to the. pitching
staff but will most likely be
used at shortstop most of the
season. Tilly rate as one of the
top fielders on the club.

At the other positions. veterr

capable hand at second or
third. Collier and Jim Jenks,
last year’s leading hitters. pro-
vide insurance at first. Pfitsch
also can boast experienced
bench Strength at third in Phil
King and John McDonald.

Rounding out the picture are
the other sophomores. Nick
Nonas is expected to take over
the catching chores for the
Pioneers, a spot that plagued
them in l963. Juniors Don MC-
Wethy and Vern Robinson will
back up Nonas.

In the outfield Dave Synhorst,

John Shierholz and Barry R.
Anderson are tabbed as likely
regulars. All are fast but did
not play last season and need
to prove themselves at the
plate. Anderson also provides
a sure hand around third. Kris
Nash, a good hitter, also seems
likely to See a lot of action in
the outfield.

in the infield three other
sophs are set for back-up roles.
Steve Farber will see action at
short if Tilly pitches and can
hurl creditably himself. Mike
Stollex‘ and Keith Zolla will
back up the starters at third
and first respectively.

Open This Week

To Take on Kohawks. Wm. Penn

Four newcomers and two let,-
termen will open the tennis
season for Grinnell College this
Saturday when they play host

to Coe at 1 pm, and William
Penn at 4 pm.

Weather has been the biggest
obstacle this fal‘, limiting Coach
Edd Bowers to just a couple
good looks at his young club—
there are no seniors listed on
the roster.

“This will definitely be a
building year for us," Bowers
says. “with no seniors around,
whatever we do this year will

give us a little something to
go on next season.”

Opening at the No. l spot will
be Larry Shannon, who went
undefeated in dual matches last
year, playing in the No. 3 spot.
Right behind him is Ken Cly-
mer, who played in the No. 4
and 5 spots last year.

Currently holding down the
third position is Mike Green-
field, a sophomore who played
in the top spot for tl\e yearlings
last year.

Battling for the other three
spots are Jon Schwartz, Dick
Metzler, and Roger Abendroth.
Schwartz and Metzler were on
the team last year, but saw
little action. Abendroth, Bows
ers thinks, could move up in
the group if he can develop a
game to go with his strong
service.

 

were also undefeated in ninl
matches.

Besides Sellergren the likely
regulars are Eric Miller, who
tied for fourth in the confer-
ence meet, and Russ Harder-
who tied for sixth. The other
spots are still open but the
strongest challengers are Dave
Baetz who was fourth man on
the squad last year and Al
Wheeler. the top freshman
player last season.

Ted Risser and Al Peterson
are the other likely starters.
Other members of the squad
are Mike Miller, a junior, Jeri
Kohlman and Tom Lane, both
sophomores.

Coach Crawford feels that
Knox will again offer the
toughest competition as their
top four men are returning.
Cornell, Carleton, Beloit and
Ripon are other likely chal-
lengers.

As far as the outlook for this
season is concerned Crawford
said that, “We'll be right in
there." He looks forward to
some improvement, and feels
that this year's team will be a
“little better" than the 1963
squad. .

The Pioneers open their sea-
son Saturday as they host
Knox and Monmouth at the
Grinnell Country Club course.
