Nuts!

Last night's circus had everything bllt elephants, and
tiley'd probably have been on the scene it" the politlcs ill-
l'olved had been of the Republican brand. (Wait ‘til next
Week.)

The Program in Practical Political Education put on a
good show, no one can deny that. But somehow, after tlle
List hilzzah for tile Demos in '62 died away, there seemed-
to be something missing. _

Let’s see. What was n ssing‘? Words‘7 No, there were
plenty of those. Criticism oi" what’s over and done with ill
American politics? Nope. There was plenty of that. What
was missing? ‘

Maybe it was tll’ . Maybe it was an honest. specif-
ic nnucnflescendine, di lies on of the state of the na—
tion today and ullat's to be (lone about fixing it up.

That’s what I wanted to hear. I wanted to hear what
5 key American Senator thinks ought to be (lone about
Cuba. About Berlin. About the racial problem. About the
i am problem.

I wanted to be stimulated somewhere within the
cerebellum, not the viscera.

Senator Goldwater, if you read this betel-e you speal:

The pace at peace

The lfour year old Grin ell ”pe‘ce movement” has
played an excitingly radical El all, crying; ollt of an intense
involvement with nuclear realties to a majority of per—
plexed, synnathetic or outraged st‘udent onlookers. The
“movement” get organized as Grinnell Students for Peace
some time back, and lots 01' people worked on the less
spectacular details of administration. But a preponderance
of wandering enthusiasm m'er practicality left the “move»
Inent” swimming between weakness and strength, between
the adherence of the barberless, faithful few and the crew
cot hundred.

This year the “movement" has hitched up its or-
ganizational belt as the Grinnell Student Peace Group,
because the “for Peace" (male might presume unfairly
that nonmlembers were ipso facto for war. The pr
ent Version has produced one at" the ﬁnest conbrete
accomplishments of the “movement‘s“ stormy ex t»
ence, a series of faculty members talks entitled, “Is
Disarmament Possible." This emphasis, which Presir
dent Mike Home“ has been kicking around in his vis-
Ions for a few years, 'liltIS at focusing the insights of
different academic dis iplines on (lisarnlament’s prn
ti ill aspect Professor Joseph Wall took the histol-
an’s standpoint ill a lively introduction to the series
Tuesday night

For many of us the intermittent eruptions of ”peace
l’ioVelnent" action stand as landmarks ill Grlnnell’s en»
coumging struggle to come alive.

It all began one fine sprlng‘ night ill 1960, when about

rty piclleting students decided to make the all-campus ,

ml itary ball their scene of protest. ROTC has seen fit to
use a Very private, women’s gym ever since. The following
fall a larger group marched at the capitol building in Des
Mojnes, and next morning’s “Register" left Iowa gaping
at this pullky threat to its peace of mind.

lst year fourteen students decided that a stand
against nuclear testing was worth a meal, or maybe even
three meal-less days making their Voices heard in Ameri‘
ca’s capitol. Over 300 Grinnell students back home skipped
a, meal to Show their solidarity. And all the time between
these valuable outbursts, the peace movement talked, dis-
cussed and collapsed into listless exhaustion.

This observer congratulates the present group for
carrying through an effort which can give continuity to
the "movement,” bllt those spasms ot’ plotest are still
damn necessarv not onlv because Grinnell needs the perie
odic jolt (but al 0 for two rather sobering reasons: The

(3| ACCORDING To Tm:
Edgren Amendment, passed
by last year’s Scum, there
are (we methods of initiat-
-ing .1 referendum: one by a
decision of the Executive
Cabinet, and the other by
obtaining the names of 25%
of the student hotly on a
petition culling for :1 refer»

Surely, if Messrs. Halland
and Pilgrim represent even a
si eable Interested minority
desiring u referendum, they
are only too free to utilize
this latter method.

So it occurs to me that the
(lelnngoguery ot' the Harlan and
Pilgrim letter is guilty ot all the
evils they attributed to Mr. 505*
ton and the Executive Cabinet.

Or was u a Joke after all?

To the Editor:

As parents of a freshman stu—
dent at Gr lnell, we thoroughly
may your publlcuhou. It gives
us a piclulc oi the school aboul
which we still have much to
learn. However the issue just
received (Oct. )) dissipated
some of the good feeling we had
in regard to general attitudes on
campus In the quucl- of pl'cpr
plum I am referring particu-
larly to the lehglhy and rather
silly comments in the letters to
the Editor

MR. LARSON bIIGIIT want
an answer to the uuouluu posed
.u the end of his somewhat noll‘
sensical ospousal of pro )ing.
Our answer i~ ‘yes" 7 tnis is
evaclly the kind of institution
we hope our son is attending.
though I must say Mr. Larson
raised a few doubts in my mind,
that is u his attitute toward
such an outdated, childish ac
tivity is representative.

To the E(l.tot.

I had to be rather amused by
the suupbuv pcech of Johns
Harlan and Pilgrim in last
week's 5&1}. Since it ignored all
the pertinent facts relating to
the Executive Cabinet's velo or
a referendum on the Mlssissi
pl resolution. I‘ve decided
must be a joke,

it

However. just to clear things
up, here are the facts:

(1) THE RESOLUTION 31'
the Senate was not, and can—
not constitutionally be, a man-
(late upon the Cabinet to hold
a referendum. It is but the
recommendation of one branch
of student government to an-
other. As a result, it is up to
the discretion of the Cabinet
whether or not it will deem
such a recommended refer-
endum necessary.

(2) THESE ARE THE rea-
sons Mr. Boston gave to the
Senate (of which both Hurr
Ian and Pilgrim are members)
for tlle.Cabinet’s vein: The
Cabinet did not feel there is
sufficieul opposition to the
Senate's passage of the l‘eso'
lution to warrant a referen—
duln on those grounds, upl-
dld it feel that a resolution
which in essence commended

We hope that the opportun-
ity tor :1 college education is
something more than an “aca-
demic rat race"; that “2mm
tionnl and physical release” is
served by lav better means
(huh prepping stunts: fhut de-
pendent thinking and the abil-
ity to get along with one's
fellow man doesn’t depend on
such shallow reasoning as
these letters displayed.

One exception — our colnpli»
ments to Mr. Snyder and Lnngan
Hall. Apparently there are
some people on campus as stu—
dents who are discovering what
u means to put away childish
things, Discussion of both Sides

WE ARE BEGINNING a horseback riding program this week-
end with tree rides sponsored by the Informal Social Committee
Sului-dav afternoon. The stables were subsidized last year by the
college and were used extensively for much lower rates than
those at present. It is our hope that the stables will eventually
be subsidized again, but the only method by which we can prove
to the college that there is need for their help is by our interest
and participation in the available program. Your opportunity to
discover the fun in hoiseback riding 15 at hand Saturday after-

A Parent Reader

To the Editor:

I appreciate the opportunity
to comment as a parent on the
hurtling issue of women‘s hours
I will first answer your specific
questions. I think the Gl'innell
administration should act in RCA
cordance wifh its own judgment
in this matter. When my daughr
tor planned to go Grinnell. I
did not ask specifically about:
women's hours: I was interested
generally in the administration,
the laculty. the student body
and the alumni: I received very
favorable reports on all of
these groups then. and outside
the pages of 5&3 I receive very
favorable i‘epor on them new

AT HOME, my daughter
would not be permitted to star
out all night or to entertain
boys in her bedroom, The quesV
(iuu could never arise. since
such things are not done in our
community. They are done. of
course, by a few rebels, and
they are done generally in a
few rebellious communities, I
have not observed that the reb-
cls. either individually or (:01-

College has nobler purposes
than preparing a painless (mush
lion into the adult world. If
will do no harm, however, to
realize that there are few op-
portunities in that world to in-
dulge “basic rights" entirely
free from regulations. s

An Illinois parent

To the Editor:

As parents of a Grinnell co-ed
we strongly protest any move
to abolish women's hours. The
answer to your question as to
whether we would have refused
to let our daughter come to
Grinnell with no hours regulaA
tions is an unqualified yes, We
are greatly distressed because of
the increasmg trend toward be
laxation of all college rules and
regulations as evidenced by the
hazing incidents. open open
dorms, unrestricted liquor in
dor moi-(es, repons of girls in
men's dormitory rooms all night.
and how the pressure for elimi-
nation oi curfew for the women.

Everywhere we are com-
pelled to live by rules and un—
der restrictions. Society would
simply break down without
them, and life at :1 college is
no excehtion. Laws are neces—
sary for the protection of those
who want to abide by the cor-
rect standards of behavior.

We are curious. Why else do
you want to rel v the houls but
for “free love“ School activities
are over. the library and student
union closed. No hours at the
wonle s dorms would mean no
restrictions at all on boys being
in the lounges and loggi: all
night. and \‘ice versa—the girls
in the be ' dorm, How liberal
can one get?

It . our feeling that all this
agitation is being made by a
small but vociferous minority
and (hul the average level-head
cd student is not opposed to rear
sonn‘ole rcstricuons. It is too bad
that u {cw sludents can damage
the reputation and prestige of
the college, which is what. is
happening right how.
