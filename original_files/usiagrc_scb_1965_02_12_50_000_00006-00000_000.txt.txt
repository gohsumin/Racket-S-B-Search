Exam came at about the same
time, and that the JLA was
created to accommodate the
kind of incentive that would
lead to independent study.

"A time for studying for the
JLA and comps. however, has
been kept in the new calen-
dar,”he said. referring to the
three-week Christmas recess.
“Furthermore. the Rosent‘eld
lecture series will continue
along with other lectures and
programs that will be offered
during the academic year."

Knopf believes that the at-
tendance at the lectures will
be maintained, “but with a dif-
ferent kind of participation—-
for example, people who find
certain lectures relate to ma-
ierial they are covering in
class. Forcing attendance by
covering these lectures on ex-
unis would defeat the Whole
purpose of independent study.
However, I think we can en-
courage independent s t u d y
without imposing any threats.

”Perhaps discusion of lec-
ture topics in class would stim-
ulate more student interest.
However, we must realize that
the initiative for independent
study can not come from out-
side sources, but only from
the Student himself," Knopf
said.

will be on campus from Sun-

narians Program sponsored by
the Board of Religion.

The seminarians will stay
in residence halls on North
and South Campus, participat-
ing With students and faculty
in discussions and conversa-
tions.

A panel considering the ques-
tion “ls Religion Going to
Church?” will be held Sunday

Lounge of the Forum. The
panel will consist of the five
seminarians with a student
moderator and it will kick of!

T h a following seminarians

school.

Housewright will give the
sermon in College Chapel Sun-
day morning at ll:00 on the

As the seminarians are from
schools of widely varying tra-
ditions. a broad range of outa
look is expected by the Board

'of Religion.

Two general meanings of the
question under consideration
are “Is the religious life con-
stituted in attendance at wor-
ship services?” and “Is res
gious concern becoming trapped
or stratified in 8nd identifiable
only with a sterile institution?"

Other questions under con-
sideration, and related areas
will be “What constitutes re-
ligious life?” “How important
are formal religious observ~
ances?" “What, exactly, is the
nature of religious observance
in the various traditions of
faith?" “What relevance has
institutional religion to the life
of the college student?" and
"What are the goals of the in-
stitutional ministry and the na-
ture and worth of seminary
education?"

T h e seminarians will be
staying in college dormitories
and dining with students while
they are here. In addition. gen-
erous opportunities will be
available for individual confer-
ences with interested students,
as well as informal conversa<
tion.

Schedules will be posted in
the halls, and there will be a
student in each hall who will
be able to answer questions.
