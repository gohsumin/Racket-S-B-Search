At Ford Motor Company we're always looking
for better ideas. But not with a crystal ball.

We do it with background and brain

We do it by seeking answers tor down-to-
earth questions such as: Should a profitable central
Cl'ly dealership be relocated to a growing suburban
location? What‘s the sales potential for a new,
personal car?

And we do it by trying to solve problems that
haven't been faced till now. Problems such as: is an
electric car the answer to city trattic? How will
people travel in the year 2000?

In short, our better ideas come from better
people. And we take extra steps to get them. Ford
Motor Company has a College Graduate Program

“which provides immediate opportunities for indi-
vidual development, in our rotational assignment
system graduates are assured broad training and
constant visrbility to management, Right now, new

new marketing programs, new subsidiary

products,
