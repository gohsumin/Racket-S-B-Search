“Hypocrisy has been an oft-heard cry on the
Grinnell campus concerning a wide variety of subjects.
I would like, however, to explore the “hypocrisy is-
sue" in still another area — that of the Grinnell ath-
letic world. This issue, of course, could be philosophical-
1y discussed as to the place of athletics at a liberal
arts institution such as Grinnell. However, I just wish
to examine the hypothesis that Grinnell purports a
level of athletic competition which, in fact, does not
exist. Whether the level of competition which in ac-
tuality does exist is good or evil is not my concern
here, I am merely asserting its existence.

Let me begin by quoting first the Grinnell College
Bulletin “Athletic competition is not allowed to inter—
fere with the student’s primary purpose at Grinnell,
that of obtaining a good liberal arts education,” and
secondly Football Coach Edd Bowers in the Bill Bry-
son column of the Des Moines Tribune (May 7, 1962),
“Not a one of them (Grinnell athletes) was recruited,
and not a one is here on an athletic scholarship. Every
scholarship is strictly academic" It is this image of
“keeping athletics in their proper place" that I believe
Grinnell attempts to project to the public.

In reality, however, we are a school which staffs an
admissions man who, among other things, is assigned
to recruiting (I use the term loosely) athletes The
coaches and interested officials can often be seen eat-
ing lunch with prospective GrinnelI athletes, and
courting them about campus in a way which could
be reserved for those with 800 College Board'Scores.

The effectiveness of our “recruiting" program is
exhibited by the fact that although only some 50% of
the student body claim Iowa or Illinois as their home
state, 25 of 32 or 78% of the football players must do
so. Of the remaining seven, three hail from Minnesota
and one lived in Iowa when he started here as a fresh—
man, Meanwhile Carleton supposedly our chief aca-
demic rival in the Midwest Conference claims only 19
of 45 from Minnesota, 8 from Illinois, 5 from Wiscon-
sin, and in all 13 states and Canada are represented on
their roster. As a result of this program, although I
have no specific information, I question whether
scholarship or admission is granted on “strictly" aca-
demic grounds.

In addition, there exists an opportunity for the
newly arrived non-intellectual “jock" to exist and in-
deed often to thrive on Grinnell society. The “jock”

AnkuEnds Career;
Good Soccer Year

Another heavy barrage of

goals by Vince Anku led Grim
nell to its fourth straight win~
mng soccer season since the
sport was returned to the Plo-
neer athletic program in the
fall of 1961.
,Coach Irv Simone's Pioneers
won five of eight matches this
year, upping their four-year
mark to 22-7-11 The three loss-
es were to long established Illi-
nois powers Lake Forest,
MacMurray, and Wheaten

Holder of all Pioneer score
ing records, Anku, this season
upped his single game stand—
ard to six goals and increased
his career mark to 68.

Anku twice notched six goals
in a match this fall—against
Northern Illinois in the opener
and later against Carleton Be-
fore getting 51X, he wrote the
old school mark of flve.’

In all, Anku kiCked in 21 of
Grinnell's 35 goals this year.
The! other Pioneer markers
were claimed by Fred Miller
and Frank Chilinmllo, four
apiece; Ted Cole, three; Felix
Lungu, two: and John Emery,
one.

A star from his first appear-
ance/in a Pioneer uniform—
he tallied four times that after-
noon—Anku collected his 68
goals in 23 matches—an aver-
age of almost three per outing.
Only once was he shut out, in a
1-0 victory over Lake Forest in
1962.

Anku chalked up a new
school one-season mark of 21
goals in 1952 and raised it to
26 a year ago

In addition to sharing the
number two spot in the scar
ing wlumn, Miller was the
team‘s playmaker.

Anku will be the big gradu<
ation 1055, Also departing via
graduation will be Chilingulo
arid a third regular—Tony Hor-
ton—plus reserve Ed Jones.
