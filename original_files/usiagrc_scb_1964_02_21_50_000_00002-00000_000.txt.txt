The final selection of

an SGA president will de-

pend more on personalities than on issues, because the
candidates don‘t differ a great deal on the issues.

It is not particularly distressing to see that the can-
didates are crowding the middle of the road. Grinnell
students have certainly had their share of empty prom-
ises, and the fact that all three candidates can see a
common goal adds to the validity of that goal.

Generally speaking, the goal is one of attitude
change. We would agree with the candidates that the
last year has been one of conﬂict and misunderstand-
ing. Unfortunately, the conflict was necessary because
of the prevailing attitude that students and administra-
tion cannotthink alike or serve each other.

We look forward to an SGA president who not
only respects his position as a student, but who respects
the positions of those who work in administrative posts
above him. We look forward to an SGA president who
will concern himself with rule enforcement before rule
creation. We look forward to a year of accomplishment

rather than waste.

 

Faculty Articles Are in Professional Journals

Dr. John H. Burma (soc),
has had two articles published
in recent professional journals.

“The Journal of American
Folklore" has printed his
study of a secret flagellant
brotherhood found among the
Hispanos of northeastern New
Mexico, entitled, “c a c r u s
.Whips and Wooden Crosses."

His “Inlerethnic Marriage in
Los Angeles, 1948-59," a tabu-
lation and description of the in-
termarriage of whites with Ne-
g r o e s, Filipinos, Japanese
Americans, Chinese Americans,
and Indians, appears in the cur-
rent issue of “Social Forces."

. Japanese Art Work

Given by Sch romms

A group of 16 art gifts has
been presented to Grinnell by

Mr. and Mrs. James 5.
Schramm of Burlington, Iowa.

The new Collection, valued at
over $4,300, includes contem-
porary Japanese woodblock
prints, aquatints, drypoints and
lithographs. It brings to 25 the
number of pieces the Schramms
have given to the college dur»
ing the past few years.

Quartet Scheduled

String quartets by Hayden,
Mozart, and Beethoven will be
performed by the Lenox Quar-
let in ii public concert at 3 p.m.
in Herrick Chapel this Sunday.

Members of the group, who
are artists-in-residence at Grlnr
cell for the second successive

car, are Peter Marsh and

heodora Mantl, violins; Paul
ﬂersh, viola; and Donald MC'
Call, cello.

 

“Setting the Stage for Lin-
coin Theatre,” an article writ-
ten by Grinnell’s Richard D.
Meyer (theatre) and his wife,
Nancy, was a feature of the
January issue of Theatre Arts.

While on leave from Grinnell,
Meyer is working this year with
Elia Kazan at the Lincoln Cen-
ter Repertory Theatre in New
York City.

The Meyers’ article describes
the entire preparation for the
Theatre’s opening production,
“After the Fall," by Arthur
Miller, which opened on Jan
uary 23.

JLA Program.
Urges Thought

To the Editor:

As Dryden so aptly wrote:
“Errors, like straws, upon
the surface flow,
He who would search for
pearls, must dive below."
Thus the interim session.

The JLAE and bedfellows
have been subjected to won-
drous and ingenious criticism
by strange and marvelous
minds. Amid this clamor, as is
usual, no sound’or reason is
anywhere to be detected, for.
as is the liberally educated stu-
dents‘ wont. there is little com-
prehension on their part of
what education is. This, how-
ever, is not the point or this
letter, ior we’ve already heard
enough nonsense on the subject.

Meyer Sees Interim Projects Offering Four Advantages

To the Editor:

There has been a great deal
of crilicism, these past few
weeks, of lhe interim session.
Lack of student incentive,’ the
wasting of time, and so on are
the general complaints. Maybe
we are not using our lime to the
best advantage (although I
don’t feel that catching up on
reading the news, sleep, and
just talking are such a criminal
waste of time). Perhaps we
don't have much incentive—but
is whether or not we study
such a gross lack of intellectual-
Does all this really add up to
such a gross lack of intellectual-
lsm and interests?

Let me answer by making
a proposal. I suggest that in
future interim sessions each
student be required to regis-
ter with the college a particu-
larvindependent project he in-
tends to carry out during in-

 

terim. This project can he on
any topic, may or may not re-
sult in a final product, and may
he as absolutely free and in-
dependent as the student
wishes. The purpose of regis
tl‘ation is two fold: first, the
student is more likely to Carry
out his project if he has ac-
tually registered it and it is
not merely a vague idea in his
head, and secondly, this would
provide lists of students and
the general areas in which they
are studying. These lists could
be both posted, that the stu»
dents could make Contact with
others interested in the same
area, and given to faculty, so
that students could seek help
and guidance from them,
should they so desire.

There are four major advan-
tages to this kind of interim
session. First, it gives the
freshmen and sophomores a

 

friedlander Says Grant From Ford
Curtails Administration's flexibility

To the Editor:

Let us indulge in some sim-
ple arithmetic. Most of us de-
sire to attend Grinnell for four
years. For this privilege we
must , contribute $2,400 per
year, with an annual increase
of $150, so the endowment
which must progress one direc-
tion or the oLher, is not totally
depleted. Meanwhile the admin-
istration, brave souls, launch
into a campaign, soon to be
completed, to solicit (did your
parents contribute?) four mil-
lldn dollars |n less than three
years. That is about four theirs-
and for each and every stu-
dent, l.;l thousand dollars per
year per student. (We will not
here discuss to whose benefit
this \money is used but Will
Submit that the administration
is painfully anxious ro continue
the flow.)

But maybe this is not really
so bad. Are not the curtailment
of student government and the
arbitrary actions of the admin
istration the necessary price to
attain the free two million
dollars which the Ford promr
ises us. Imagine, $500 for ev»
my student! ! Yes, we may
get handsome buildings and
personable {BM machines, but
let us never forget that the
Ford has kindly. Offered us the
option on another matching
fund. The administration will,
without doubr, accept in our
name. No lower tuition, no re'
laxalion, since each new mil-
lion will be harder to court.

Now who really creates these
impressive Sums? The admin»
istration would argue for its
fine corps of busmessmen and
our fine president who expend
immeasurable quamiues of
brain energy to entice the like-
ly With the old “Grmnell stu-
dents run the college” bit. Up
on reflection, however, it may
be readily seen, that it is we,
the students, who grease the
wheel that makes the cart col-
lect.

 

 

What would the administra-
tion do without students?
Die/l 1! It is true that they
would probably, at first, initi-
ate, with the money saved
from expenditures on students,
a stupendous fund~raislng specs
tacular—“the student does not
even feel he is going to a col-
lege" bit—but we may rest as-
sured that some innocent conA
tributor will finally notice the
disappearance of all buildings
but Burling Library with its
basement.

And what would happen to
the students if the administrav
tion disappeared tomorrow? We
would, quite naturally, go to
another college. (At first. it is
true, we might try it alone; but
who would be Dean of Men,
a necessary pillar for any lib-
era] institution.) it may be
argued that the administration
would also find new jobs but
where, may we ask, could a
busmessman find such a se-
cure job. So upon cursory ex-
amination, it may be seen that
it is we, the students, not the
administration, who make the
college. We are the ones who
study. while on the basis of
our accomplishments thoy
speak of their achievements.

So let the dollars and sense
be recognized. The students
and administration have a muv
tual dependence. Should we
also not have mutual oblige»
tions and rights? Ii this is not
the case, and it most certainly
is not, the dollar sign may be
seen behind it.

(All this may sound too sim-
ple, and it is, so we must warn
anyone whose ire is unduly eler
vated to work it Off at 651: an
hour for Saga and contribute
the sum to the Ford. Work
only 4,405,881 hours and the
president will shake your hand
and know your name, too.) God
bless the faculty, may we com-
municate.

Second, this kind of interim
program should provide guid-
ance for those who need and
Want it. I think that part of this
lack of interest of incentive so
often mentioned in conneclion
with interim is caused by a
lack of self-discipline coupled
with a lack of knowledge about
how to do independent study.
One of the main complaints of
students is that the faculty
don’t seem interested enough in
students. The faculty reply that
they don’t have the time.

Third, in this kind of interim.
the faculty would have no
classroom responsibility and
would have more time to give
to the students. I cannot think
of a more perfect way of
getting to know a professor, or
students interested in one’l
field than through a good in-
formal discussion over coffee
during interim. Another com-
plaint often voiced is the lack
of intellectual d i a o u 55 i o n l
among students on campus.
This kind of interim would pro-
vide an excellent opportunity
to meet and talk to people who
are interested in the Sam.
kinds of things as you are.

Under this plan the basic in-
terim would not have changed.
There would be no one to check
up on you to see what you had
accomplished; there would be
no outside pressure to accom-
plish anything linal. It would
be a time of relation and of
study. There would still be
moVics, lectures, the JLA,
comps, etc. The essential dif-
ference would be that there
would be guidance for those
who wanted it. With this sort
ol interim program. 1 think you
would find that most of the so-
called Student apathy, lack of
incentive, and lack of intelleC<
tual curiosity would disappear.
