l For What It’s Worth]

by Tom Frantz
When John Hartung gained 189 yards last; week against
St. Olaf, he passed two milestones. His season total of 834
yards surpassed the Grinnell record of 745 yards in one
season and the 1798 yards he has gained during the past
three years means he has ground out over a mile of yard-

age in his career at Grinnell.
