As ROTC Falls Tolls Knees

By ANNE FARRER

As has been frequently
the bureaucratic structure of

noted by those engaged in
the armed services, there is

duality inherent in the adaption of the military to their
social situation, Because of its mobility, service life is not
conducive to becoming integrated into the community
where the family is stationed; yet the services command
facilities and experience unique to the average Citizen and
which may benefit the community.

To counteract alienation and
develop a social consciousness,
and ioilowing the example at
military who act as good will
ambassadors to foreign commu-
nities, the AFROTC Cadet Corps
is presently on its knees in the

utters of Gl'innell, painting ad-
dress numbers on the curbs of
the 2,000 houses in town,

Utilizing their unique re.
sources, experience and mus-
cles, the cadets have thus far
painted 15o house numbers.
The project Is “the first of this
scope and about which we are
quite optimistic.” according
to Major Albert Omer. As well
as developing in these young
men a social conscience, the
project is of merit to the
cadets in an additional re-
spect — money.

Although it might violate
their budding socialawareness
to charge for their services,
the cadets ask for voluntary
contributions — to date 3130,
the means lot the individual

cadet being Ba per curb. As
Major Omer noted, this is
roughly concomitant with col-
lege wages, but “dues provide
the cadet with the oppor-
tunity or earning an additional
stipend towards the cost of
education.” lieierring to sen-
ior Jeffrey Cook’s s15 gain,
the implication is that the
cadet now has at his disposal
the means to consume [50 ice
cream cones.

The end, in short, of thls mas-
sive undertaking is that the
fire trucks, or truck as the case
may be, or Grinnell will no long—
er pursue their way unguided
through the confusion of Grim
neli house numbers, and with
the money lelr over alter de-
fraying costs, renumeratlng ca-
dets and perhaps balldaglng a

selous knee caps, a fund (or the
Cadet Corps for projects not
nominally covered by the Air
Force or Grinnell will be estab-
lished.

Marauders Liberate Cornell Bell

At 1:30 am. Sunday mom-
tng, or band or eleven Smith
Hall raiders left Grime“ in
two cars to invade the Cor-
nell College campus. At 4:00
a.m., eleven raiders in one
and a half cars arrived at the
destination.

Braving a cold rain, two men
crept past the men’s dorms and
cut the chain that burned en-

trance to the Cornell football

field. Five raiders emerged
from the woods and poured
through the gate. Bolts were
removed; the object was head
all its platform. The cars
backed onto the field and the
object was loaded. Mission ac—
complished, the party escaped
back to Grinnell. Art 800 pound
Cornell victory bell had been
liberated.

The group had planned to re.
paint the bell red and black,
with “Grinneli” on one side
and the Smith Hail seal on the
other. The hell would be dis-
played at this week's game and
at the Cornell basketball game
it still in Smith’s possession.

But by 11:00 Monday mom-

lng, the bell had been recap<

tured from the smith lounge

— not by [rate Cornell stu-
dents, but rather by a host
or 8&6 employees. The bell
will be returned unpainted be-
fore this weekend.

having guessed where the
bell was by early Monday morn-
ing, the Cornell Dean of Men
called Dean Thompson and
asked about it, Thompson was
then inlormed where the bell
was by 3&5 and instructed
them to pick it up.

The Grinnell student courts
anticipate a revision or the coi<
lege handbook and the judicial
system by next spring. They
will spend this year in export
mentation with new policies.

According to Tlm Dailey,
Chief Magistrate of the Men’s
Court, “The court system has
been viewed in Ihe past as too
formal and bogged down in
red Iape." Both representa-
tives of the court and the ad-
ministration agree that sec-
tions at the handbook pertain
ing to court jurisdiction and
penalties are often unneces-
sary and ambiguous. The
courts, consequently, it a v u
been forced, in many cases,
to create a legislative philos-
ophy from case to case.

Barriers between the courts
and the Dean's Committee and
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Allairs have complicated
the problems. Several years
ago, the Chiet Magistrate ot the
Men’s Court resigned, stating
that the “itncalledrfor over<
stepping ol jurisdictional lines
by the administration and fac-
uity" toroed his job and respon-
sibility into “obsolescence."

Linda Neal, Chief Magistrate
or the present Women's Court,
says that court members, the
Faculty Committee tor Student
Affairs and the Deans' Com-
mittee are all working Closely
together this year to try to
break down the Conflict of in-
terest. Miss Neal states that
“there is not so much hopeless-
ness about change this year."

Added Linda, “Both admin-i
lstrative and court personnel
realize the gap that has ex-
isted between rules and what
people do. We want to em-
phasizc that conduct is a per-
sunnl responsibility. if Stu-
dents tind rules unacceptable
we want to encourage them
to change them, not to break
them and eliminate them-
selves from Grinnell society.
We don’t want all Ihnse who
challenge the system to be
suspended. But it works two
ways. We want to keep those
who can responsibly change

Weekend Events

The campus movie sched-
uled tor showing tonight and
Sunday at 9:00 pm, stars
Alan Hates. The movie.
“Nothing But the Best," is
the portrayal or a young
man’s ruthless climb through
England's social strata.

On the lighter side, the
tor-um will teature three
Charlie Chaplin illms Satur~
day at 10:15. “Easy Street,"
“The Cure," and “The Immi-
grant" are scheduled,

tlt'ulgs."

The Women‘s Court has vira
tually eliminated hall contine-
ment as a penalty. Failure to
sign in and out is no longer a
court onense; responsibility for
women students who go out at
town is being shifted from the
college back to the student her-
sell. (Under 21 women must
have a blanket permission from
their parents, however.)

Men's court will increase
its eitlclency by eliminating
most iinlng penalties (the we
vious ruling in the frequent
cases of men lacked in the
women‘s loggia after hours).
Hereafter, violations or such
rules will be handled primar-
lly in the halls through warns
lngs, More serious violation oi
rules will result in conduct
probation. According to Miss
Neal, the probation penalty
is intended by the court to he
a period or personal evalua-
tion rather than intimidating
surveillance.

Conﬂict liver jurisdiction and
rules has previously caused the
unfortunate use of Student of-
fenders as “examples.” A
“conuminity"rm’lented court has
been suggested as a possibility
tor prevention of such conilicts.
A combined Men's and Warm 3
en's Court would solve some of
the iragmentauon oi interest on
campus. Another proposal is a
body composed or representa~
lives from the student body, the
iaculty and the administration.

Miss Neal suggests that such
a group might act in an advis-
ory, not legislative, capacity
and that the student concur
in what he Considers the most
applicable penalty ior his situ-
atian. But she cautions, “There
is a great deal of faith and risk

Dean of Men 8. Eugene
Thompson supports some typo

be some rough rationals to
