a This interpretation seems un—

ist, an observer and recorder,
not an interpreter. The story
does not persuade, but our

drive us to action.

The photography of the ﬁlm‘

was ctlcctive. it

most cinematographic cliches, In
many places the photography

and the use of symbols which
were not Zolil‘s condensed the
story with fidelity to the orig

one slight dramatic how.

in Zola's hook the daughter,
Nana, was grown and had lcit

or course Nana was not as
important in the movie as in
the hook and existed in the
ﬁlm more to illuminate Gers

an individual statement.

The acting was all good. A
lack of weakness in ‘the cast

the ﬁne direction of Rene Clea
merit. Maria Scllell‘s portrayal
of Gervaise can be attributed
wnly (o genius.
