located to Lhe initiative (nod
to maintain the $1400 leveli
$4450 was also allocated to the
halls.

Debate on the recommenda-
tion was contused and tedi-
ous, occasionally lightened
and enlightened by caustic
comments. Most a g r e e d
with Phil Bertenihai, repre-
senting the ﬁnance commie
tee, who felt that the initia-

ning" iirst semester. Although
he recognized there were
problems in any new pro<

ported.

Bob Joh'nston, retiring Social

Luose’s student-iaculty picnic,
for example. it takes time tor
a new idea to prove itseii. It's
uniair to expect people on
campus to be completely at-
tuned to a new social idea in
one semester. We should give
the hind a chance to develop a
new atmosphere or the halls
will [all back in the same old
rut.”

Mike Pill, Stanley Wezelman,
and Ray Horn argued against
maintaining the initiative hind
at 51400. Arguing for “greater
individual responsibility," Pill
wanted a cut in the fund “to
turn a little or the responsibility
back to the hallr”

Arguing against die emphasir
on inter-hall activtty, asserting
the halls have shown their abili-
ty on creative social planning.
Horn pleaded, “Don't. use the
fund as a club to heat the halls
into submission for inter-hall
activity." Horn wanted the sen-
ate ”to have Confidence in their
fellow students.”

Wezelman sought more in-
dividual hall planning 50 that
social planning would be “con-
sistent” With the hours proposal
and other plans that show con-

bility.”

Pill, rererring to hall plan-
ning, then declared, ”We have
enough faith in ourselves.” To
which Roger Koenker replied
that Pill el al wanted a return
to the “pastoral ideal social
program we had beiore the in-
itiative fund." Knenker im-
plied they were being “pare

the hall,”

Johnston then remarked,
“If we do reinstate the past-
toral ideal and return to nor.
