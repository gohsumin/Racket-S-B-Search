Nudes Protest “Body Commercialism"

'A group of ten demonstrators stripped
Wednesday in response to the appear-
hnce of a representative of Playboy
magazine on the Grinnell Campus. The
action took place at a questionranswer
uession held in Gates lounge scheduled

r 4:00. After about a ten minute dia-
ogue between Brice Draper and a few
M the 70 students and resident ad-
visors present, the group began to re-
move their clothes.

They had entered the lounge bearing
signs, and at the beginning of their dem-
onstration, a number of their clothed
aympathizers circulated notices explain-
inging their actions. The questioning
with Draper was interrupted tor only a
few minutes while the demonstrators
sang “You Gotta Walks That Lonesome
Valey." Ric Exner accompanied them
with his guitar. The demonstration was
quiet and hardly disruptive. The non<
participants remained calm with no
overt reaction though a slight nervous~
tress was perceptible. The questioning
continued as soon as the singing ended,
although the demonstrators remained
nude for another fifteen minutes.

The notice which the group circulated
explained that the demonstratng group
was objecting to the ”dehumanizing and
‘depersonalizing" attitude at the Playboy
philosophy. lt stated: “We protest Play-
boy's images of lapdog female play-

things with idealized proportions and
their junior-executive-on-therwny»up pos-
sessors." They were protesting against
the concept of women as “objects” in<
stand or humans. The questions which
followed the demonstration coming from
the demonstrators and the rest 0! the
audience indicated antagonism against;
“exploitation of sex" in the magazine
and the creation of a “philosophy" and
human ideal for proiit purposes.

Kit Leder, one or the participants, la~
ter explained that the action was in-
tended not only to dissent tram the Play-
boy philosophy but also to assert their
own human dignity.

The participant also later told or what
she called ”an undress rehearsal" be-
ing called the night before to build up
trust and courage among participants.
She also explained that during the dam
onstration she concentrated on singing
rather than her own nudity. Rather than
reeling antagonism tor Draper, the par-
ticipant telt sympathy for his having
“such an uncreative job” and {or his
being a ”cog in the Playboy philosophy,
a victim of the establishmen

in general, the strippers Seemed to
ieel that their pomt was made with ease
and naturalliess and felt no embarass-
rnent. Draper later commented that he
was not oﬂended by the nudity but he

could not agree with the dissenters ob-
jections to Playboy magazine.

Although Draper was not upset, Pres-
ident Legget is concerned with the mo
tivation behind a “disruptive and ex-

hibitionist protest". After the protestors
have been identified the administration
will decide it the matter should be
brought before the Judicial Council, Ex-
treme action seems improbable.

Democracy Elects New Elite

On Thursday night the Grinnell Stu-
' ent body turned our in rousing Iashiou

elect two new senators. The two new

‘elltists," elected on two ballots, are
Michael Brandon and Mike Saeger. The
ﬁeld was narrowed lrom tho original
«wen candidates to Brandon. Saeger,
ion Castore, and Ted Glick. Both the
lrst and second ballots were extremely
“we.

The Grinnell students turned out 181
people to vote on the first ballot, a su-
berb turnout compared to the 40 people
bxpected by Tom Thomas, S.G.A. pres-
ident. The student body cams closer to
:‘l'homas' prediction on the second and
tinal ballot by responding with 100
hotels. Since the election was extreme‘

1y close and Thomas indicated that at
least twenty students cast votes {or non-
candidates on the first ballot, it seems
teasable that the two new senators could
have won the election on twenty~ona
Votes apiece.

it is certainly obvious that twentyone
votes from l,200 students is not a re-
sounding show oi support for the new
senators In a tremendous “vote apathy’
the student body in actuallity has cast
a vote for the present “elitist" structure
oi student government. There will be no
change in the relationship between the
students and the Senate and thus, this
election was merely another student
government farce under the ever present
guise oi representation.

Playboy Interview: Draper Confronted By 5&8

By JON STEIN

in conjunction with the continuing pro.
gram on sex education, Wednesday after-
noon Brice Draper, a representative or
playboy magazine visited the campus.
He spoke at Haines and Gates Hall to
students interested in the Playboy Philo-
sophy. The iollowing is an interview
that took place at Homes lounge.

5&3 — To begin with, I’d like to know
what department you work ior.

Playboy —— I’m involved in promotions
specifically on college campuses. I visit
approximately seventy campuses a year,
promoting products for our advertisers
and doing public relations work tor the
magazine,

5&3 —— How important is the college
student to your circulation and to what
age group do you try to appeal to?

Playboy ~ We aim our magazine at
the 18434 year old, well educated, urban
male.

5&3 — Could you tell me what ele-
ments of the magazine you consider im-
portant?

Playboy — There are no elements that
are singularly important, it is a package
of articles, reviews, interviews and pic<
wrials.

5&3 — How important is the center
ioldout?

Playboy — Not very. . .

SﬂtB — Do you have any idea of the
readers you'd lose it you discontinued
the ioldout?

Playboy — Well. . .an independent re-
search group has inlormed us that we
would lose 15% of our readers if we took
out the ioldout; alter a while, 5% would
return.

5&3 — How does that relate to your
proﬁts?

Playboy —I don't know, it depends. . .

5&3 — My point is that the playmate
is a trademark of sorts, used to sell
everything from bath towels to the Play-
boy Clubs. Your. supposed appreciation oi!

the human form is in reality common
elalism.

Playboy — We try to present the play-
mate as a well-rounded person and not
merely as a body—

siirB >— How do you view women in
general?

Playboy —— We look at the role of wo-
man as someone who is a companion, u
compliment to the mall.

5&3 — Is attractiveness important?

Playboy — Yes, sexual attractiveness
enhances the enjoyment between parF
ners.

5&3 — The human body is beautiful,
but isn’t Playboy guilty of stereotyping
beauty and exaggerating the playmale’s
accessibility?

Playboy — I thilik you're over-emphzu
sizing the importance or the told-out.
What we're trying to do is put together
a total entertainment package tor young
men, and until the time comes when
