SCARLET AND BLACK

 

llhkhdi LhdlEkS thhlih tidied

The law says that we are responsible
For every bad thing that we do;
But college oliicials in lawn

Are taking a much diiierent View.

It seems that they think we are morons

Or spoiled and irrational brats

When they condescend to have words with us
Our discussions are kindergarten chats.

Kindergarten Chats, Kindergarten Chats

How does one converse with the young?

These kindergarten brats will show you where it’s at
But first, we’ll have a little iun,

(In case you might be anguishing
Over where the treasure's languishing
The necklace made of sterling

Is somewhere here in Hurling.)

s or a

In Humanities we learn very much about Hell
And how it applies to our life at Grinnell

But imagine, if you think you’re not doing well,
Spending Thirty Years as President or Budmell.

a t is

I’m pleased to announce the Foundation of Ford
Has given Grinnell still another award

To research a field in which they know most

(At a school like Grimell, that’s no idle boast)
The stipend is worth seven thousand (no, wait —-
1 think Henry said that he might give us eight)
To be spent in a field in which we're well-knownli
In Victorian Studies. Grinnell stands alone.

u a o

A peculiar game at this college

1s discussing in loitiest tones

Not the advancement of knowledge
Instead it’s the search for unknowns.

We call it a search for ‘community'
Paul Goodman has said it exists
To foster the myth ot a unity;

We iind it not hard to resist

Sn ihereiore let’s not say community

It's a Quest or the Infinite, not

Too real in this state of disunlty;

Glenn, be happy with that which you’ve got.

a a t

In the evening when the sun goes down
hurling Basement lights are burning bright
It’s the twilight people in their twilight world
Plotting how best to wield their might.

People at the Twilight, People at the Twilight

They’re not true teachers, but they hate students, too;'
People of the Twilight. denied the glow of Tmth's light
Be careful when you pass them, they may be cursing you.

l-lawn, who assumed the po-
sition on Oct. 16, holds a BS.
degree in civil engineering lrom
Iowa State University and is lir
censed to practice structural
and architectural engineering in
IOWCL

Thanks to the Deans, we now all know

About LSD and why poppies grow

But it the narcotics boys only would try,

They’d soon learn the secret or how we get high
The hares think we smoke marijuana alone
Would they be surprised ii the real truth were known!
A trip is so easy if you know where to look,
Try Burling and ask for the Mushroom Book.
In the beginning came J. B. Grimell

A young man hound westward we know

His journey was shortened, he rested a spell

In mid-Iowa long long ago.

And he founded a college that still lives today
But J. B. would Cry if he saw

l-low modem Grinnellians are turning away
From the concept 0! God’s divine law.

0h, sad, how we‘ve renounced religion
Congmgaiionalist Grinnell, God, is dead;
We have strayed from the field of believers
And become Godless pinkoes instead.

a i- o

Peaceful are the tree-lined streets
As we. walk through the square;
Silent are the iolks we greet

To see their hostile stare;

Painful are the wounds we feel
When assaulted in the night;
Hated are the ones who steal
And think that it’s all right,

l’m sure you know it well
rm speaking of Grlnnell
For violence in the streets
Chicago can’t compete
New York, despite renown
Cannot match our Town.

s s c

We wonder when the daylight is fading

what our upright leaders like to do;

Do they just spend their evening hours evading
Problems like the Annex, Pit, and Zoo?

And it they try iorgetting, how‘s it done?

Watching Peyton Place upon their TV screen?

i think their leisure’s spent in having fun

Vicariously thinking Lay Thoughts at a Dean.
r u e

Grinnell is a college that’s said to be so ﬁne

The prois are enlightened, and we grow ivy vines;

The school‘s reputation's made academically;

We wonder why you’re spending so much on P.E.

It’s clear that the students are not the Phy. Ed kind

Instead oi playing tennis, they’d rather blow their mind

The class of 61 was hardly too athletic

The showing or the varsity is pretty near pathetic

So why are you building a temple to gymnastics?

When we‘d rather be known as Senior in Scholuties.
- u o

It’s said that the Deans are the Victorians

But I’d like to say a word for Mr. Alden;

Though Candy and Lolita are bestsellers

He'd only let us read such things as Walden.

Though books by D, H, Lawrence are called classics
They can't be sent to us by US. Mails;
Arriving, they are hidden in the ofﬁce
Where asking for them makes a student quail.
We advocate a reconsideration
or what we lhink is Burling's tragic ilaw
We'ask that you digest the information
Relating to Pornography and the Law.
