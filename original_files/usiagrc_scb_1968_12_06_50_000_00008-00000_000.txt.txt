.Varsiiy Sandbag Frosh 72-25;
Rollins Sets New Free Record

By CLIFFORD FROLICH

In the annual Freshman-Var-
llty Swimming Meet held at
Grinneil on Friday, November
29, the varsity sandbagged the
:reshmen by a score of 72 to

5.

Bruce Rollins of the varsity
Won three events, and set a
new Grinnell record in the 200
free with a time at 1255.3. The
old record of 156.2 was set last
year by John MeBlain, who
also swam in Friday's race
against Rollins, but placed
third.

The results of the meet bode
well for the team this year.
The winning varsity times in
the 100 free, the 200 free, the
individual medley, and the hut<
terily were as good or better
t h a n Grinneil’s mid-season
times of a year ago, and the
varsity had three divers score
more than 160 points. For the
freshmen, Mike Daley, who
won the 500 free, and Steve
Ward, who won the breast-
stroke, both beat veteran var-
rity swimmers; while John
Weins, in the butterfly, and
Ward, in the individual med-
ley, nearly won their respec-
tive events, but ultimately tin-
ished second in excellent times.

Generally, the Grinnell swim
teams look very strong. and
times seem exceedingly fast
tor this early in the season.

Freshmen Lose to Varsity 85—49
After ’Suove’ Defense Fails

' ’As the semester draws to a
close. the winter sports at Grin-
nell make their debut. Novem—
ber 30 will be remembered a:
the gala event of the opening
winter season. Darby gym host-
ed the lighting Grinneil Varsity
basketball team and their op-
ponents, the fetal frosh. The
audience was able to get a sneak

review or not only the viva<
pious jocks but also the peppy
oheerieaders who led the great
Ipirit which undulated from the
midst of the multitude who wit-
nessed the game.

The first half showed the pos-
Iibiiities of a strong freshman
team this year. They hit 39%
from the floor and held the var-
aity down to only 36%. Coach
Boyd stated that if the trash
play the entile season like they

layed during the first half, the

e a m may be conference
champs.

if we look at the second half,
however, is different Christmas
light shines on our stars.

Coach Pfitsch‘s varsity began
laying an oiiensive game.
.1 hey successfully shot 70% irom
the court. The fresh completely
test their suave defense. The
. arsity appeared to be going
through their pregame warm-

ups as one player would score
with a lay-up, another would
rebound and hand the ball off
to another player for a lay-up.

For the varsity, Evenson was
top scorer totaling 12 whole
points, This feat was accom-
plished by making a out of a
field goal attempts. wingate.
Pederson, and Hanson each
scored 10 points. The entire
team saw some action during
the game and produced a val<
iant team effort. High scorers
for the frosh were Meyer, with
14 points, Hirsch, with 3 points,
and Gilbert with 6. The fresh
showed a definite inability
to hit successfully as the min-
utes flew by. In the second half,
the team hit only 14% of their
attempts. Hirsch made 3 out of
11 attempts, Gilbert 3 out or
9, Meyer 6 out of 15 (yeai) and
Jordan 2 out n! 7.

l-lalitime found the Varsity
leading 3629, and the final score
gave the varsity as points and
the fresh 49.

The varsity, however, will see
action this coming weekend in
Chicago, and the fresh won't
see conference action until late
in January. Is the Varsity ready
for VarSlty ball??? Will the
trash improve by 69”}

py Line of Tom Jackson, Bruce

at 1-1 with only a minute left in
the first period. in a scramble
in front of the Grinnell net. the

4 in the second period, Grinnell

the game. But one of Des
Moines' shots bounced off Sigel'l
shoulder and into the net to give

Moines two-Leone. The ice
Hawks' goal tender stopped 24

Greater Size, Depfll Bode Well ;
For Basketball Team This Year

By JEFF conzarr

On December 7. the Grinneli
College Pioneers will put on the
court the best basketball team
we have had in years. The two
reasons for this year's inn
proved Pioneer squad are the
increased size of the players
and a greater depth of person
nei.

For the first time in several
seasons the Pioneers will have
several players taller than as.
Accompanying Terry Holloway
will be 6—7 Greg Beckman, 8-6
Scott Henson, 8-4 Quinton Pheh,
and 64 Gary Dukes. All four
players are fine shooterl and
passers, and play good defense.
Furthermore, all four are
sophomores; so we can look
forward to three years of good
basketball.

As for depth, the presence of
senior Henry Wingete and
sophomores Gary Johnson and
Brian Carroll will let Coach
Pfitsch field two equal teams.
These two factors plus the re
turn of Thor Evenson, Whitey
Christensen, Don Peterson, and
three other lettermen leads
Coach Pfitsch to believe that
the loss of Mike Swariz, the
conference's fourth leading
scorer, will not be crippling.

Because of the team's greater
height and depth, the Pioneers
will change their style of has-

ketball to a form of fast break
end a pressing defense. Another
result of the team: changed
complexion will be more No
bounds and better shooting.

Despite these improvements,
the Pioneers will still have
trouble improving their confen
ence record because the Mid-
west Conference is the toughest
it has been in years. Beioit, last
year's champion, is favored to
repeat with Cornell and Mons
mouth, last year's second place
teams, lighting Beloit for the
top. St. Olaf, last year’s third
place finisher, and Knox are
expected to be the other top
contenders. Coe or Carleton il
picked to be the conference
derkhorse. The experts' pres
season pick for Grinnell is last
place.

Coach Piitsch neverthelesl
believe: the pro-season {om
cast is wrong for several rea-
sons. The first is that the rest
of the conference does not know
of the return of Henry Wingate
or of the addition of the strong
sophomore crop. Lastly. Coach
Pfitsch has declared that the
Pioneers’ team play and em
thusiasm are much better this
year. If the team keeps im<
proving as it has, we can look
for at least a first division ﬁne
lsh, and maybe higher. Regard-
less, we will certainly surprise
a lot of teams this year.

 

SWIMMERS EXORIATE COE 72—22

On Wednesday, December 4,
the Grinnell swimming team
excol'ieted Coo College 72 to 22.
Coo won only two events.

isting Grinnell swimming rec‘
old, 28,2. set by Norman in

tied his own record of 50.3 Seth
ands, set last year.
