‘hlti Play

“No plzvy has ever mmlc tiicl
public ilizlddcr,” scitl Richard}
Meyer (drama) of Arthur Miller
now play “After the Fall” at the
line arts lecture yesterday. Mcycrl
was closely involved in the New‘
itorlt production of the play at the
Liilcaln Center Repertoire Theatre
while (in sabbatical leave 1962363.
His lecture traced the Creative
work trom the impulse in the cre-
ator to its presentation to the pub-
lie.

“The question was,” explained
Meyer of the critics' reaction,
“should it have been Written at
all?” “Alter the Fall” is a thinly
veiled, autebiographic drama of
Miller’s lite and inner struggle
through two marriages, Miller's
second wile was Marilyn Monroe,
who ended their marriage aiter
rive years by suicide. The play’s
unusual artistic formifragmentary
construction and open staging —‘
and the obvious identity or thel
characters led the critics to ones-i
tion Millers motives in writing it.

Meyer, who knew and workedl
with Miller on the production, re-l
filled this criticism leveled against
the playwright when the playl
opened. “He did not write the play
tor sensationalisin or money. He‘
worked lroin sincere, deeprfelt, and
honorable motives."

Meyer's lecture explained the
history or the play through the lite
of its autliur. Citing Miller’s ear-
Iier plays, “All My Sons,”

"Dedlh of a Stiles’mt‘in,“ tilitl “The
Crumble“ ver said tlli’lL lli
“Crucible” it seemed that man liiltl
reached the high point oi moral
cvullltlun. Bcloic his next pliiy
came the “joltlllg realization" of
the “inability of all his will to
save his Marilyn.”

“Miller is a full time intellect-
ual,” asserted Meyer, who is
afraid of his emotions and WhOSe
only release is to quickly put them
into words. Thus explained, the
play was a painiul and tliiticult
but necessary creation of Miller’s.

“ ‘After the Fall” is rooted in
guilt." Meyer said. It is the pro-
duct of Miller’s “quest Within him-
self” following his Wife's suicu‘le.
‘He recovered her time and again
irom death," Meyer said

In the play, Quinton is in the
role of the savior. He believes that
If there is love, it must be limit-
less. But Maggie will not allow
him to save her. He pleads with
her, “You eat those pills tu blind
yourselii Do the hardest thing or
all — see your guilt and live!" But
iinally he sees that to embrace his
idea of limitless love is to be God.
Limitless love is impossible for
main, And as the probable third
Wile says, “One must finally take
ni'ie's life In one’s own arms."

Meyer told at how Miller him-
seli had explained the message or
“After the Fall” on opening night.
“ ‘Guilt is the false face one gives
one’s knowledge or responsibility
Guilt is an Evasion.

T0 the Ediltti':

it is i'dlhet‘ interesting, in the
light ot eiirront indications on the
part oi Sccrctory ot Detensc lilo
Namai'a that our troop commit-
merit in Viet Nam will soon be
increased, to take iiotc oi a recent
statement by Secret y of State
Rusk at Rio De Janeiro as to the
naturc ol our commitment in Viet
Nam. According to an AP article
which appeared in the Des Moines
Register, Secretary Rusk defined
our commitment as ﬁlm oi prov
ing to the Communists that wars
oI liberation are bound to be tin»
succcssiul, and that, “When that
type of aggression is turned back,
as it will be, then the clouds of
war will begin to dissipate and
men will be able to look ahead
with confidence and hope."

There is implicit in this state-
merit a commitment on the part
of the United States to combat
these “wars or liberation" where»
over lhey occur on the grounds
that they are all part of a long-run
strategy for global domination
which his bcoii iorniuloted in Pe-t
king oi Moscow. This might or;
seen as logic extension oi the.
containment policy toimulated byi
Gcoigc Kclinan in the immediate;
po an era but it is not it isi
moie increasing inflexibility of oi
comiiiitinciit in Viet Nam and out i
general commitment to ultimately'
disprove the theory of world domi-
nation through “wars or libero
tion" which is evident in a further
statement by Rusk that “the iii-
tegrity of the American govcri

men at stnirc in the outcome
or our present policy.

It is the belief of this writer
that the Clliicnl. commitment as
detined by Rusk (and thus sup
posedly the administration), is too
gcncial to he sustained. and thus
is unrealistic. Victory in Viet Nam
may not, in actuality, result in a
dissipation of the clouds of war.
The present failure of the United
States policymakers to discrimi»
hate between indigenous national-
ist revolutions and global “‘Cum»
munist conspiracy” is likely to as-
sure our continued participation in
wars of the Vietnamese type ior
years to come.

The neighboring nations in
Southeast Asia are not lnvulner-
able to the kind or upheaval which
is being experienced by South Viet
Nam. As the process of economic
development accelerates and the

impact of modern industrial tech-
iiology makes itself incrcusiiigiv
felt in these areas, they become
more susceptible to the kind or
social unrest which gives rise to
revolutions. It is not important
whether these revolutions are fu-
inented by Peking or not, what is
important is the ivay Washington
views them. If we continue to view
all national insurrections in which
Communists are participating as
being directed by Peking then we
are committed, according to the
above statements by Rusk, to con.
tinuous intervention and blood;-
shcd around the globe. Whether
or not this kind or intorterencc in
other nations' business is right or
not is not at issue hero The point
