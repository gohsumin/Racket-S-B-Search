Nelson A. Rockefeller ls Named as Best GOP Possibility
To Provide Contrast to Present Administration's Tenor

Nelson A. Rockefeller, Gov-
ernor of New York, is far and
away the best man for the Re-
publican presidential nomina-
tion. To provide a contrast to
the dull, sluggish Democratic

ROCKEFELLER

YAdministration, the Republi-
cans need a liberal, dynamic,
experienced candidate. Turn-
ing to an extremist candidate
would not be to the advantage
of the party; the American
people want a man as president
who recognizes and knows how
to meet the problems of our
largely urbanized, complex so-

 

ciety, The place for a sincere
conservative like Barry Gold-
water is the Senate, where he
can do his rabble-rousing with
out ,seriously affecting the
course of our nation,

Governor Rockefeller, is the
most qualified person for the
office of president. Six years as
executive head of New York
has certainly given him great
experience in dealing with
problems that an executive
must face, His re-election in
1962, when the Democrats dom-
inated the New York Senate
and House races, showed the
confidence the people of New
York have in him and indicated
their approval of the job he has
done.

Since the problems of the
United 'States—ever-lncreasing
urbanization with strong rural
interests—are present in minia-
ture in New York, Governor
Rockefeller has in the past 6
years been dealing with prob-
lems similar to those which
would face him if elected pres-
ident.

Rocketeller‘s a o c o mplish-
ments as governor of N. Y. are
too numerous to mention, but
some of the more outstanding
are: (1) He wiped out a $700,-
000,000 deficit inherited from
the Democratic Administra-
tion; (1) By 1962, per Capita
income in the state reached a
new high, about 25% over the

 

national average; (3) School
aid from the state to local
districts nearly doubled from
1958‘t0 1562; (4) accomplished
a more than ten-fold increase
in the housing program for
middle-income families.

Rockefeller has served as an
aide to 3 previous presidents
of the United States, Only 32
years old in 1940, he was ap-
pointed Assistant Secretary of
State for Latin American af~
fairs by F, D. R. Later he
played an instrumental part in
planning Truman’s Point Four
foreign aid program, which
many people in Washington re
garded as a Rockefeller crer
ation. Under Eisenhower, he
drew up a blueprint for the
first dept of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, served as its
first vicepresident, planned a
reorganization of the Defense
Dept. and became assistant in
charge of cold war strategy

Rockefeller’s political and
administrative experience ‘is
quite diversified. having served
in 2 Democratic and l Republi-
can administrations and 6
years as governor of a politi-
cally lei-polarized statel His
initial job as Assistant Secre-
tary of State has given him
experience in and a knowledge
of foreign affairs, which he
has aptly demonstrated in the
past and present presidential
campaigns.

 

lodge Has Tradition of Ability in Diplomacy, Politics;’
Became Well Known While Eisenhower's UN Ambassador

Millions of nationally con-
lcious Americans between the
years of 1952 and 1960 saw, in
Henry Cabot Lodge's public
natements addressed from the
United Nations, 3 much needed,
consistent statement of the
United States foreign policy
within the context of the "cold
war." In 1960, as the Vice-Pres-
idential running mate of Rich-
ard Nixon, he continued to em-
phasize the difficulties of the in-
ternatlonal situations

Now, just several weeks past,
the people who had followed
Lodge’s long diplomatic back—

ound joined with others who

tely had come to view him as
most capable of uniting the Re
publican effort, and together
they brought about a remark-
able victory for Lodge in the
New Hampshire primary. His
success in New Hampshire was
even more remarkable in that
Lodge was not personally pres-
ent to lead his supporters; he
did not issue an official word
on his own behalfl

What is it about Lodge that
calls for his kind of loyal sup-
port? What enigma does Henry
Cabot Lodge Jr., present to the
political analyst? What kind of
a program does he offer to the
,voter?

 

Above all, Lodge is a diplo»
mat. His interest in foreign
affairs carries an aura of tra-
dition, for his grandfather,

Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., him-
self a famous United States
Senator from Massachusetts,

 

LODGE

was quite vocally involved in
a period of international cri-
sisl But the senior Lodge had
distingushed himself under T.
Roosevelt and Wilson as an
isolationist, a position that his
grandson adopted at the begin-

 

ning of his senatorial careers
It is to Lodge, Jrl’s credit that

he was able to make an about-
face in response to the post
World War international prob»
lem; after 1944 he became a
strong internationalist, on rec-
ord in favor of the North At-
lantic Treaty and the Marshall
Plan.

Following his thirteen years
as a U. S. Senator from Massa-
chusetts (1932-1952 with a break
for war service), Lodge was
chosen by Dwight D Eisen-
hower to be his ”chief liaison
officer on all government mat—
ters except the budget,"—to a
position which later in that
year led Lodge to the post of
head of the United States Mis-
sion to the United Nations, He
served as head of the UN dele-
gation for eight years A back-
ground journalism (Harvard)
followed by eight years on the
political news and editorial
staff of the New York Herald
Tribune served him well, as his
ability to handle difficult prob-
lems of foreign policy evi-
denced, He was straight for-
ward; he could communicated

It was these qualities, as
much as political considera-
