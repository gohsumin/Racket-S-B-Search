“The normal penalty for the

illg hours ror one week. Dur-
mg the period ot penalty a
woman must be checked in by
the monitor in her own hall,"

Al Boston told about the
Midwest College Student GovA
ernnient Association conlcrence
he attended last weekend. Al-
though only six out or ten cola
leges were able to send rep-
resentatives, Boston was able
to obtain inrormation in sev—
eral areas or interest.
According to him, Grinnell has
a niedurn position with regard
to women’s hours. Some schools
have later weekend hours but
on the other hand one college
has 7:30 hours for trcshman wo—
men for the ﬁrst nine weeks.

Grinneil had the largest. student,

budget or any of the colleges
represented (Boston
our budget ot about $46,000 to
the $3,000 budget or another“
school).

it is the only one of the c0171
leges represented which pays
student government employees,
and none of the others have a
position which corresponds toi

our position of student auditor. 1

1Dr Amstutz presents an optimistic
1view for‘ toxic literature' readers

By Nick Murray

In a lecture delivered last
1Friday entitled “Sickness, Evil
1and Theology in Sat ~e, Camus
1and Katha," Dr. Jakob Ainstutz
or the University of Bern, Swims
zcriand, spoke of sin-called “toxic
llitel‘ature” and contrasted the
ietrects produced by it with the
intentions of three of its best
,kiiown authors: Jean-Paul Sar—
‘trc, Albert Camus, and Franz
.Kaﬂta.

Amstutz stated that by “sicle
iness” he meant a sickness oi the
1“ ill, in which men either lacked
1any development of will or had
channeled it into the service or
perverse ends- and that by “evil”
he meant the "external compul—
sion" ol will.

HE WENT 0N to deﬁne three
sicknesses produced in society
-by the misunderstanding of this
11itcrature: ( ) “snobbisln,” an
‘attitude taken by those who ac-
cept the apparently pessimistic

:message of “toxic literature” and

travel in it as fashionable, agl’eev
ing that. there is nothing to be
done, and taking sophisticated
pride in their knowledge;

(2) “deleatism.” a feeling or
hopelessness engendered in the

1gcneral’public by its acceptance
1of these books at tace value; and

(3) a “theological malady” colic

1sisting of an Eflol‘t on the part;
‘of some churchmen to take ad-

vantage of the effects produced
by this literature by reattirming
the powerlessness of men as de-
pictcd in it, and arguing the
more strongly tor the surrender
of the individual will to the
will of God as expressed in
church dogma.

Amstutz then said that. the in-
tentions of Saltre, Camus and
Kafka had been to produce just
the revcise effect supporting hisi
statement by reference to ther
non ﬁctional Writings of each au-‘
thor, in which all speak in some1
way of the power and freedom
of the individual mil.
