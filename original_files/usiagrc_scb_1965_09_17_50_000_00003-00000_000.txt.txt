The report also concludes that
most individuals who felt guilty
about their sexual activity ceased
to feel guilty about future actlv~

lauds Distributing
S&B’s to Faculty

To the Editor:

r should like to thank you, and
through you the ap ropriate col~
legiate agencies, tor t e new policy
ogtdistributing the 5&3 to the fac
u y.

Such a policy—which l have
urged since my arrival here —
seems to me to he sensible. just.
and beneficial. You will not, of
Icourse, reap any immediate har-
vests of sympathy and understand-
ing: but over the years 1 believe
that taculty and students will be
closer as a result. And the posi-
tion of the 5&8 as the organ oi
communication will be enhanced,
so Ihat its own standards will be-
come higher in accord with its
new responsibilities. _
