As New SGA Wind: Up Year

The year was not a spectacu-
lar one tor the scar Except tor
the week before the convention
this spring, student government
continued normal operations,
largely out of Sight and out of
mind for the campus at large,

The Encampment was held in
September, when to students
and 20 faculty and administra-
tion members “retreated" to a
church camp near Boone, They
spent two days discussing cam-
pus problems, with attention
centered on the North Campus
Problem.

Partimpaltts expressed cone

and responsibility on North

» Also in October the Senate re-
sed, by a vote oi 17-3, to an
ropriate any money for the
es Moines Project. The main
bbjection was that this would
mount to using student social
hnds to subsidize a political
brogram.

The North Campus Problem
.was again brought to the atten-
lion of students when SGA

President Jerry Goddard Vis-
ited houseniectings to circulate
a petition. Goddard obtained 830
signatures on the petition, which
objected to the way in which
students were being excluded
irom decisionrmaking on resi~
dence hall changes Goddard
presented the petition to Presi-
dent Leggett, who commented
that he had “every intention"
of consulting students betore he
made any changes.
