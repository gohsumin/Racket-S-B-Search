Well, welii We ﬁnally made it back from Christmas vacation
and the awful boredom which goes with a month of separation
from our natural environment has been supplanted by eager an-
ticipation of coming events. Now that we are free to resume our
activities. I. M. sports once again leap to the ioreiront of campus
thought.

The last sport to be contested was badminton which was held
just before Christmas. Brent Dubach supplanted Phil Woodward
as the singles champion While a team from Smith took the doubles
trophy. Dibble took first handily to become the first hall this year
to capture two team trophies.

Basketball now moves to the center stage and the season
promises to be one of the most bitterly contested in recent history
(but, at the same time, in the spirit of goodwill and gamesman-
Ihi ).

GOLFERS JUDGED.
0N CLOSED CIRCUIT

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Grinneil's golfers are on television. Closed—circuit, that is.

Coach Edd Bowers, using videotape experimentally as a
teaching device, found it effective in showing students what's
wrong (or right) with their teeing techniques.

“In football coaching, television tapes are more economical
than the movies currently in use,” Bowers said. When movies
outlive their usefulness, he added, nothing can be done with the
old film. TV tapes, on the other hand, can be erased and reused,
he said.

The TV equipment, which includes a camera and a monitor
set, was lent to Bowers by Ray Slanderwick. a 1952 alumnus
who played iontball and basketball under coach John A. Ptitsch.

Standerwick, now living in Grinnell, sells classroom furnish—
Lngs, including television sets designed for educational use.

Bowers was not fully satisﬁed with the equipment models be
used Though he obtained “excellent” results using it with his
golf class, he found that football pictures were somewhat unclear.
“Besides," he said, he was unable “to replay the tapes in slow
motion, and this proved to be a major drawback."

Bowers is keeping his eyes open for improvements which will
provide clearer photographs and enable him to use slow motion.
Such a machine, he said, would cost about $2500, while the one
he now uses sells for around $1500.

it might be a good idea, he suggested, for the college to boy
its own closed-Circuit. Available on a school-wide basis, it could
be useful in several other departments in addition to athletics,
Bowers said

”There will always be the problem, of course, of athletes
who would rather be TV comedians,” stated the Grinnell coach.
"Instead at concentrating on their swings or their passes, some
will prefer to clown for the beneiit of whoever might be watch-
Ing.”

But videotape, at least, can always be erasedl he concluded.

cago's Holiday Tournament. in
the iirst game, Grinnell lost to

time lead but they only shot
29 percent in the second half.

21 points in the first half, Thor
Evenson had 10 of 16 and Mike

The Grinnell team’s ﬁnest
hour so far occurred on January

be called a surprise upset over
Carleton, 65-64. A 35 foot jump
shot by Mike Schwartz in the
last few seconds won the game
after the Pioneers had trailed
by as much as 15 points in the
second half.

Down by 15 early in the secs
0nd half, the Scarlet and Black
