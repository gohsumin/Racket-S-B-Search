Donulloe, Four Exchange Students Tell
Coffee Hour of leMoyne Experiences

By Pam Clay

Ned Donahoe (speech and
theater) began the coffee hour
about LeMoyne last Tuesday
afternoon in his customary di-
rect fashion, The mood was set
when he burst out asking
where we Were during Christ-
mas vacation while students
from Oberlin and other col-
leges went south to help re-
build churches. “There are
more things to be done than
marching,” he said. “As edur
cated people you have some-
thing to offer. Education is im-
portant, and if you want to do
something to help, that is what
you can do."

When asked why he went to
LeMoyne, Donahoe retorted,
"Why does someone go to Le-
Moyne? That’s none of your
business!” He responded to
another question with, "I
learned things at first hand. i
learned a lot of things to hate
— povertyI grubbiness.“

The four students from Le-
Moyne Lois McGowan,
Dorothy Harris, Louis Harvey,
and Frank Patterson—were al»
so present to answer questions
and comment on both LeMoyne
and Grinnell. Answers to an
inquiry as to why they came
to Grinnell ranged from curi-
osity, a Wanderlust, and a de-
sire for a superior education,
to Frank’s statement that he
was here because “the boy
who was supposed to come
couldn’tl"

Dorothy made a smiling
complaint about the Saturday
classes here and then elaborat-
ed on the LeMoyne class sche-
dule. They have several two-
hour classes, and these are
held throughout the day —- for
instance one German class
ends at 7:30 p.m. One big dif~
ference at Grinnell.that Lois
noted was that “Here kids
neck all over . . . on the stair-
way, in the lounges. . . l" The
girls both laughed but said that
at LeMoyne no one is ever
seen kissing.

All of the students from Le-
Moyne commented that they
had many friends (some had
most of their friends) outside
the college. Since LeMoyne has
no dorms, the unity of the col-
lege and the amount of activity
(e.g. student government)
which takes place within it Is
limited.

Donahue spoke of LeMoyne
students in general as the
"chosen few" and said that
many of them “did not know
where they were going but
knew they had to learn" They
realized that they will have to
be leaders and they are seri-
ous about learning LeMoyne

students have a ”double duty.”
he explained. They have to
catch up (from a generally in-
ferior high school back-
ground), and then they have to
go ahead from there.

Finally the discussion turned
to me Grinnellian at LeMoyne
and what his ourpose must be.
"Do not go down there to be
a torpedo and change Mem-
phis!" was the Clear word of
warning. Donahoe said that the
primary motive must be edu-
cation; "Then you will find
concern and find something to
do.” There is prejudice in
Memphis, not always obvious
but always there. The public
library, where ”we know we
are allowed but we know we
are not wanted," was cited as
an example of the need for a
mood of relaxation to combat
unfriendly staresr

“I wish we exchanged not
only students, but also teach-
ers," Donahoe said as he end-
ed the discussion.

A llrrtlnna report on the Sel-
ma situation, received by the son
last night by telephone from four
Grinnell students, is rested in the
Forum lobby.

Literacy Can't Go,
Father ’Ong States

“We can’t let the age of lit-
eracy go after all,” concluded
Father Walter Ong, noted scllol-
ar and teacher from St. Louis
University during the annual
Nollen L e c t u r e Wednesday
night.

Speaking on the possibility of
an end to the age of literacy
brought on by the new electron-
ic age, Father Ong said,
“Printing and writing are no
longer uniquely central but
part of a larger complex that
gives communication new or—
ganization himerto unknown.

“The human being can’t have
thinking without language be-
cause thinking implies the ex~
istence of other people," ex-
plained Father Ong in an ex-
tended discussion of communi-
cation.

“Our electronic age has
brought on a new world of
sound,” he said. “In scanning
the space age, sight will not
suffice." In thus admitting that
the manuscript age has given
way to the sound age, Father
Ong emphasized that one media
can succeed another without
canceling it, saying ”When we
started writing, we didn't stop

Pesticides Provide

By Anne Farrer

Although the speech by Dr,
0. Hale Fletchall, University of
Missouri agronomist, to Grin-
nell science bugs on March 4
may not have been considered
a topic of universal import by
most liberal arts tools, the
topic—pesticides—actually was
pertinent to the Grinnell situa-
tion.

For Instance, no one active
and responsible in student gov-
ernment would advocate fumi-
gating the entire higher heir-
archy of Grinnell; nonetheless
there are a few points that SGA
officials might find handy for
future reference.

For example,’ toxicity is a
matter of dosage, and all chem-
icals are toxic if taken in large
enough amounts. This could be

Possible Answer

a real saving in any future
SGA administration confronta-
tion, for by shrewd analysis of
the general character of an of-
ficial, the minimum dosage
could be determined readily.
H o w e ve r, Dr. Fletchall did
point out that “there is no such
things as absolute safety" in
the use of pesticides, of which
fact SGA-ers should he cogni-
zant.

One other point mentioned
by Dr. Fletchall is already quite
familiar to most Grinnellians.
In discussing the difference be
tween biological co'ntrol of pests
and the use of pesticides, Dr.
Fleichall made one last rele-
vant statement:

"It just all depends whose
drainboard the c o c k roaches
are on."

Excerpt from Grinnell Primer

By Don Knrasch

It is snowing. It is a Grin-
nell snowy day. Look, lookr See
the snow. There is very much
snow.

Look, look. Look up. See the
Grinnell boys on Younker roof.
They are dropping snow on
Grinnell students. They are
big Grinnell boys. They are
very smart. They want atten-
tion. Everybody look up. Give
the boys attention. Smart.
smart boys. Very clever.
Clever, clever.

Oh, look. Look and see.
There are some more big Grin-
nell boys. They are piling snow
in front of Langan door. They
are giggling as they play. Lis-
ten to them giggle. Giggle,
giggle. They sound like little
girls. They are very funny.
Very clever. Laugh.

Oh no! Look and see. There
are some more Grinnell chil-
dren playing. They are throw-
ing snowballs. They are run-
ning. They are screaming
Some of the big. brave boys
are over the Cowles archway.
We should look up again. Run,
run. Throw, throw. Throw and
run.

See John. John Is a big,
brave Grinnell boy. He throws
snowballs at Grinnell students.
Then he runs home. Run, run.
Run fast, John. John is very
smart.

Oh, oh. Look over there. Now
there are broken windows.
Dear, dear. Now the big Grin-
nell boys must be scolded.
Bad, bad boys. You will be
punished. You are very bad
boys.

Say, Grinnell boys. Why do
Grinnell student groups say
mey don't have any money?
Grinnell must be very rich.
We can afford to break 18
windows in two days.

Grinnell boys are very
smart. They are successfulr
They have attention. They
have impressed everybody. Es-
pecially Grinnell girls. Look,
Grinnell girls. Give the boys
attention. Be impressed.

Grinnell is a very smart
school. They have very smart
boys. They drop snow from
rooftops. They pile snow in
front of doors. They have
fights with the snow. They
even break windows. They
giggle. Giggle, giggle. Smart
Grinnell boys.
