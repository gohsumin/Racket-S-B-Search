Dewey described the atmos-
phere ”behind the lines" as a
camp meeting or homecoming.
He said people were milling
around and there was a “ter-
rific community spirit and fel-
lowship."

The rope and the bridge have
become symbols for the civil
rights demonstrators. and
Dewey noted, “This movement

“Another fear of the white
Citizens in the South is that
Negro emancipation is causing
loss of his status and dignity."
Dewey continued. Dewey point-
ed out that if Negroes are
enfranchised, influential men in
the Selma community, like
Sheriff James Clark, will be
removed from power.

“Releasing the white man

concern of the Southern Chris
tian Leadership Conference’s
non-violent philosophy,” Dewey
noted. “In this sense, human
rights, not just civil rights, are
at stake."

Speaking of his own expert
ences, Dewey said that he
spent his first two days in Sel-

led by the “Berlin Wall"

doesn’t precipitate violent situa-

does occur, it creates another

Dewey also participated in
the attempted integration of a
Selma church last Sunday.
Dewey said the minister of the
church refused entrance to the
{integrated group, saying, “You
‘are making a mockery of our
religion," but that several
members of the church and
other Selma citizens offered
verbal encouragement to the
group.

When President Johnson de-

Dewey was seated near Mars

Sieve Shender
School for Young Apes

There was once, in a farmf jungle, B survival
school for young apes. It was a small school, as
these things go, but it was a very famous one, and
young apes, male and female, flocked to it from
all parts of the jungle. The school’s curriculum, ac-
cording to its catalogue, was designed to educate
the students in all aspects of LIFE. The wide spec»
trum of courses offered included such refined ones
as “History of Ape Thought" and “Ape Art —- From
Ugh to Oobanga," as well as practical courses in
jungle survival such as “Lower Order Group Con-
trol," dealing mainly with herd psychology, and
“Digital Manipulation 222" for advanced inﬁghting
with clubs and rocks.

However, in spite of the Wide and varied cur-
riculum. it came to he felt by the faculty and the
students that the school was not adequately prepar-
ing its scholars for the REAL THING. When the
young apes returned to their homes during vacations,
they were impressed by the vast gap between life at
the school, to which may had become accustomed,
and the Vicious, ape—eatrape chimp race of LIFE
in the rest of the jungle. The faculty had long been
aware of this problem, and although they themselves
were not particularly upset by it, they were some-
what concerned for the sake of those young apes
who were not destined to become academicians.
Some iaculty members suggested the curriculum
be expanded to include new courses such as “Ad-
vanced Breast Beating” or “Group Cooperation,"
but this was not what the students wanted.

“We can't escape this gilded palm tree by tak-
ing more courses." grunted one young ape. "The
problem is that when we come here we simply sub-
stitute the conmil of the faculty for the control of
our kinrgl'oup. What we need is more independence
and the right to run our own affairs." Alter much
hair tearing and breast thumping on the part of
the students and discussion on the part of the facul-
ty, it was finally agreed that the young ape had a
valid point and the students were allowed to estab-
lish their own government, the AST (Associated
Student Tribe). »

For a time. everyone was convinced that a
happy solution had been found which would allow
the young apes to learn about LlFE and get an
education at the same time. But alas, this happy
interlude was only the proverbial calm before the
storm, and when the storm broke, the coconuts
began to fall thick and fast.

A seemingly innocent misdemeanor on the part

of one freshman ape marked the beginning of the
tempest. One night, during mid-semester exams
he was seen swinging through the trees in ihe
males’ compound, at a speed well over the pre-
scribed limit, dropping coconut rinds and banana
peels indiscriminately on the heads of sleepers be»
low. it was later established by fellow students,
after his apprehension, that he had become de-
pressed after “bombing" his exam in lion psychol-
ogy and had proceeded to get soused on a quart of
fermented coconut milk.

being justly proud of their new right to govern
themselves rather than hush the incident in order
to protect the offender from severe faculty recrlm-
inations, his fellow students took him before the AST
Tribunal. That august body, after much deliberation,
fined him ten couch shells and warned him that in
case of a second offense, he would not escape With
sucll a light punishment. The matter was considered
done with, and the students, pleased by their ability
to render JUSTICE, returned to their Studies.

However, in the eyes of the FTS (the Faculty
Truth Squad, a committee established by the pro~
fessors in order to keep tabs on the AST), the case
was far from concluded. In a secret meeting, cone
ducted at night in the heights of a secluded palm
tree, they decided that the punishment had been too
mild and that it was necessary to intervene in order
to remind the students who was really running the
school. The young offender was subsequently sus<
pended for three weeks.

Reaction from the student body was Swift “1
coming. The AST tribunal chief lodged a formal
protest with the faculty, saying that the Truth Squad
had violated a fundamental area of student jurisdic»
lion, and furthermore, that the Squad’s very ex-
isiniice was a insult to student integrity. The FTS
replied with the statement that the students didn't
have any rights other than ihnse the faculty chose
to grant them, and that “there's no such thing as
‘siudent integrity,‘ ”

Still hoping to resolve the conflict through an
appeal to reason, the AST issued a rather extensive
statement which said in essence that student-faculty
relations Could only be based on trust and that Stu—
dents could hardly be expected to be responsible
when the FTS refused to recognize them as mature
monkeys, There was no reply by the faculty at this

Shades of Gray
Shooting From the Hip

By Carl Otis Gray

What’s hipness? it seems that hipness implies
an awareness of being of your own time and having
the ability to communicate it. A hipster is some»
one who is aware, very much‘ aware, of what could
happen and what should happen in his particular
flow of experience. So say the experts who in {his
case happen to be The Village Voice, Greenwich
Village’s own peculiar version of the Scarlet and
Black.

Using the definitions put forth and current
trends in American student opinion I can only
reach the conclusion that hipness is very desirable,
extremely glamorous and highly prestigious among
this college generation. This is as it should be,
After all we are a generation spawned during a
world war, weened during an international police
action, and matured during a period of hostility
whose overt manifestations Could mean total de-
struction of our planet. During our lifetimes it is
doubtful that we have ever experienced one day
when a human life was not taken as a result of
international conflict. I therefore assume ihat we
have a right and a duty to be hip.

Awareness of one's tllne suggests a recognition
of ‘rill the social, political, and personal issues that
affect us. The ability to communicate suggests an
involvement. It IS obvious that it is impossible to
lake thcse sintements literally and attempt to em-
brace the problems of the world one by one. What
is necessary is a certain abstraction, a neat gener-
alization that can serve as the basis [or the indi-
viduals functioning as a hipster.

i It).

Whether or not I consider myself a hipster is
not in question here. but looking around me l can
discern, in this pioneer of the midwestern educa-
tional traditions, very few. lf we are aware of the
problems we certainly don’t go out of our way to
communicate this awareness. Far from playing
the sophisticated Easterner in the wilderness of
midwestern traditionalism, provincialism, and iso-
lationism, I am appalled by our complacency and
apathy here at Grinnell. From the success of the
Grinnell Civil Rights Group and the reaction to
U.S. military actions in Viet Nam, I can only see
looming in large neon lighting that obscenity at
Obscenities — SQUARE.

Let’s face it. We are unable to look beyond the
physical boundaries of this institution. Even in our
dealings with our own internal problEms we lack
the sophistication and imagination in deal with
thESE issues in a creative manner. We lack the
initiative to take firm stands: we possess a wonder-
ful ability to procrastinate and vaccilate. if all
these symptoms are merely a local phenomenon,
as I am convmcod they are, then 1 suggest we
voluntarily quarantine ourselves — apathy is con-
tagious.

Like apathy, hipness is also contagious -
pruhably their only common factors. If other insil~
tutions of similar merit have been struck with III
it’s our turn to contract it. With the loss of apalhy
should go our own naive conceptions and illusions
about ourselves and our society. With the advent of
hipness should come some dynamism and leader-
ship.

Come on, hipness is sweeping the country ——
let's get into the mainstream.
