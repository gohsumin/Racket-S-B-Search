Jags and Juniors Converge Upon Convention

The current week has been-
one of political concentration
on campus issues and consider-
ation toward a future campus
leader, Tomorrow’s convention
will demand the serious atten-
tion of the student body for the
purpose of selecting the final
candidates for SGA president.

But a convention would be
both long and dull without the
folly produced by the “not-so-
serious” mind. For this reason
Grinnell students welcome the

.platforms and the antics of the
jag candidates.

Perhaps the most serious jag
candidate of them all was
~"Binky" Barnes, who was run-
ning in 1943. Barnes was a ser-
lous contender for president un-
til it was disCovered that he
was one credit hour short of be-
Ing eligible for office.

Sixteen years later a group
known by the mysterious ini-
tials DFVA announced, “We,
the members of the DFVA,
feel the need of an absolute

dictatorship.” Working under
the banner of the crescent and
wrench, tho DFVA advocated
appointment of all officers by
their leader known only as
-“Big Daddy.”

The year 1957 had a bumper
crop of jag candidates, 16 in
all; but back in is“ a more
unusual thing happened. Out of
10 presidential candidates only
one was male.

Perhaps the most famous jag ‘

Sister Contrasts Reilect Thieme of Claudel Play;

- candidate was nominated in
1959. His campaign manager
reasoned, “If Mr. Gary Cooper
is elected, we will be able to
beat out Oberlin for first place
in the Chicago Tribune’s ‘Rank
the Colleges' poll.” ’

However, Cooper declined
graciously in a telegram to the
8&3 editor: “Deeply honored
to be asked to participate in
student. elections, but commit-
ments keep me from accepting,

Pictured above during final rehearsals for "Tidings Brought to Mary." are Gretchen Geyer
and Ken Freedman who will have leading roles in the performances this weekend by

lhe Grinnell Players.

Production ‘Both Human and Supernatural Drama'

Two incongruous s i s t e r s,
sweet Violaina (Gretchen Gey-
er) and jealous Mara (Susan
Monto), will command the at-
tention of local armchair t’hes-

pians Saturday and Sunday
nights when the Grinnell Col-
lege Players present the French
liturgical play, by Paul Claudel,
“The Tidings B r o u g h I To
Mary," iii-Roberts Theatre.
The action of the production,
translated into English by Wal—
lace Fowlie, revolves around
the relationship between the
two sisters, Violaine and Mara,
who are' totally different in
temperament and yet who are
indissolubly joined. Violaine is
the good sister who represents
Christian Charity in its fullest
sense. Mara, whose name
means “bitter" in Hebrew, is
the violently jealous sister who
becomes a murderess.
Claudel’s circumspect and
sensitive development of the re-

lationship between these sis-
ters helps to make “The Tid-
ings Brought To Mary" E hue
man and supernatural drama
at the same time.

Included in the small cast are
Keith Felton as Jacques, Ken
Freedman as Pierre, Sue Early
as the mother. Terence McCoy
as the father, and Karen Hardy,
Robin Kornkow, Ariane Sylva,
Howard Harned and Nan Dona—
hoe as the Woods People.

Claudel w o r k e d, reworked
and. revised this play innumer-
able times over a period of 56
years before its final version
was produced on the stage, The
first version was published in
1892, but it wasn’t until 1948
when the definItive Version used
by the Grinnell Players was fin-
ished. According to Claude] it
was ”the work I was the most
attached to, the one for which
I had the most constant afteCA
tion.”
