urday, will serve as a final
warm up before the Pioneers

ference run is that I can enter
three in each event," says
Coach Dick Young. "The top
two finishers will get spots on
the team that goes to Cedar
Rapids."

Animal Life -:-

By Don Kurasch
“Rain, rain, go away;

Come again some other
day. . ."

This song was emotionally
sung in the hearts of each and
every one of the brave 1M
athletes who last weekend had
to face the nightmarish reality
of being rained. out of the Track

and Golf meets. Many a quiver
ing lip and dampened cheek
was seen on North campus, and
many of these otherwise non—
emotional men, who had so self-
lessly given up smoking and
done their pushups and squat-
thrusts daily for months and
months in preparation for this
momentous weekend, were giv-
en to uncontrollable tantrums.

Why, practically every night
I saw the golfers going out to
the golf course to daily check
the layout of the course. And
the tracksters usually joined
them for the exercise, and I
understand they made out real
well,

Just last Tuesday night I saw.
some of the really mature,
brave, aild bold lM athletes
getting into shape by pelting
Cowles hall with mudballs. and
I realized how very clever lhe

 

animals oi North campus can

be when they really try. Shame
on those who accused these
stalwart souls of regression.

Well, today and tomorrow
are the Golf and Track meets,
and if the prayers of all North
campus ainmals are answered,
there will be no rain. I do hope
those prayers are answered.

As far as softball goes, I’m
really not too sure, As near as
I can tell, the standings are
relatively unchanged; the
numbers in the win-lose col-
umn are just a little bigger.
I’ll try to ﬁnd out by next
week exactly how the animal
heap stands.

Until then, fellow animals,
cheer up—Spring Day is com-
ing soon,

Bobby For Roger

NEW YORK (AP) a Despite
troubles with the press and pub-
lic, Roger Maris will have a
big year, predicts second base~
man Bobby Richardson oi the
Yankees,

Richardson says Maris has
become something of a forgot-
ten man this spring because he
shies away from interviews.
Fans booed Marin in the Yank-
ee's opening game but Richard-
son points out that right field
was muddy‘after spring rains
and Maris couldn't run as hard
‘as he usually does.
