LEST WE FORGET . . .

Grinnell is residential. All but a few students live in the cola
lege's residence halls on the campus. Residence of students in
college is needed to create a sense of community, to emancipate
students from adolescent interests, to tree them from prejudices,
to foster independence, and to provide new experiences, perspeCs
lives, and aspirations.

Grlluiell Is located ill a rural setting. Its location apart irom
large population centers reduces distractions, promotes hard work,
encourages primary attention to studies. and favors participation
in the life of the campus. Flaming and execution of social activ-
ities depend to a large extent upon student leadership and initia-
tive rather than commercial entertainment. Thus, the use of leis-
ure time itself becomes a worthwhile educational experience.

Grinnell’s style at lite is simple. Social, cultural, and extra-
curricular activities flourish in number and variety on the Grin-
nell campus. Yet the style In which they are Conducted is simple
and unpretentious. Expensive wardrobes, cars, and large amounts
of spending money are not necessary {or success in the student
society. In fact, there is no social stratification among students.
and every social activity is open to all without charge, Grinnell
has no sororities or iratemities, but the advantages of small-group
living are present in its unique residence system.

Grinnell is informal Ind flexible in policies and administration.
As a small college with an exceptionally able student body, the
college is able to experiment in education, to change and to adapt
readily. it employs tiexibiiity in the organization of curriculum
and diversity in the methods oi instruction. All members of the
community, including students, participate in governing the com-
munity's aiiairs, which are conducted in a democratic and non-
bureaucratic fashion,

Griunell is independent. As an independent college Grinneli is

an atmosphere all members of the community have the oppor-
tunity —— and the responsibility —- to test the merit of ideas in the
light of truth, assured of respect (or their honest inquiry irom all
other members of the community.

‘ LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

lliiiiiilliiiiiliiiiiiliiiiiilliiiilliiiiilIIIiiiiiltiiiililiiiiiniiiiiliiiiiitﬁ
To the Editor:

As I now conclude my sec«
ond semester ot Humanities, I
believe that l have come to
some understanding of the ped-
agogical strategy with which
the stall approaches the
course. Between lectures and
classes, dozens oi people have
come before me in an attempt
to get me to think critically
about the readings and to em-
pathize with the characters
therein.

I have concluded that the
more one is able to understand
and ieel the experiences of a
literary character, the greater
will be the reader's apprecia-
tiun of the Works It is in light
at this conclusion that 1 rec‘
ommend a minimum oi one
act of sexual intercourse as a
pie-requisite for all students
taking Humanities lOl»lOZ.

How can a student iully ap-
preciate the immobility ot
Odysseus after seven years or
indulgence with Kalypso, ii the
reader himself has no more
than a textbook knowledge oi
their relationship? Can the pas-
sion of Dido be iully compre«
hended when the student can
claim to be no more than an
innocent bystander? Are not
the woes of Paolo and Frances-
ca aesthetically meaningless to
the uninitiated? And as for
Donne, well, let's be realistic,

I realize, of course, that the
above statements are not sui-
iicient to warrant such a revos
Iutionary change in the admina
istration's academic policy. i
do, however. propose that Grin-
neli conduct a test which will
unquestionably prove the rela-
tive merits of my theory.

The test involves assigning
those teachers who have two
Humanities classes one section
comprised of students who
have had sexual experience
and'one section comprised or
students who have had no sex-
ual experience. During the
course of the two semesters,
simple comparison of the pen
iotmances of each class should,
'i believe. provide copious evi-
dence as to the merit of my
thesis.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Neil Fischer
DIRGE FOR STIFLED MINDS

for John Crosselt (Classics)

(To be chanted aloud In didactic decryllo to the mol-
oely of "You Oughta Be Loved By Me and Nobody Else” of
to the essence of "One More For the Rodi")

CANTO 1.
Why can’t people be like ME?
I'm so reasonable and so righti'
Everything is clear to ME.
.The world is so full of stupidity
and blindness as not to see my
esoteric sublimity.
“Theirs is not to reason why. but
to lie beneath my sky.”
CANTO II.
My world is lull ot bitterness and
needless inconstancy.
If only people would see like ME
there would be no inconstancy.
All would be beauty and light so
bright where my might is right.
CANTO 111.
Take for example the printed Word - lt’l
absurd that my word is not heard.
For It everyone were like ME,
they could see.
For truly, they could hear ME
and endear ME;
Their inconstancy would be o‘erwhelmed
through ME.
CANTO IV.
Who are you to disagree with ME?
HOW can anyone disagree with ME?
How . . . you?”
PM so reasonable and so right —
can’t you see?
CANTO V.
Won’t you consent to be content?
Do not rave and rant —— just accept my cant.
And you can’t fail to see.
Through ME, .
That you were no toll of stupidity as to o'erloolt
my esoteric sublimity.
CANTO Vi.
Nero saw MY way . . . see? . . .
Wheeeeeeeeeeeel
CANTO VII.
0n and on to set ME iree: World War Three.
CANTO VIII.
Why can't people think like ME?
I’m so reasonable and so right;
Everything is clear to ME.
.‘lou are full of blindness and stupidity
not to hear my esoteric sublimity.
“Yours is not to reason why, but
only to lie beneath my sky!”
