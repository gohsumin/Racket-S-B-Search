was the topic for a South
Lounge coltee hour Wednesday
afternoon.

Speaking on the problem as

Sociology.

All three gentlemen agreed
that a problem of poverty er

flect this change. We 5 h o u i (i
think big. That’s why I'm in
agreement with this idea.

Mr. Schwartz believes the
plan to be economically teasi-
ble but sees it only as a "stop
gap measure" necessary to
keep the labor market iiuid.
“Job changes today are rapid
and people need money to live
on while they are changing
jobs or moving to new areas."

The sociologist, Mr. Gold-

transition time in young lives
and the world in which we live
has certainly compounded and
confused this process.

It was necessary to abolish
women’s hours, because of the
necessity for decision . making
by our young people. At the
same time, 1 should like to
urge that the Forum be kept
open later than at present to
provide a gathering place,
rather than the alternative oi
cars, bars and dorms.

There seems to be a compell-

of the University of Montreal
may have found a way for stu-
dents to effectively protest tu-
ition increases.

Montreal student body president

17,000 students asking them to
ignore a $30 increase in tees
and send the university the old
tuition “in trust."

But university otticiais say
the full tuition must he paid
before registration.

Dore responds that students
do not need to fear reprisals it
they present a common iront
to the university.
