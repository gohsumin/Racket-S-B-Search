ln itself, the discussion was
not a particularly noteworthy
event, but the situation was
complicated by the time: It
was shortly alter midnight and
amidst the harmless discussion
of Dante the students were
committing the otiense oi illegal
visitation. The guilty persons
had already done their duty as
campus enforcement oiiiciais
and had apprehended them-
selves for the Violation. Their
case is now pending belore the
student courts,

Earlier in the same evening,
701] students gathered in ARH
auditorium to hear SGA Pres-
lder: Steve Kent explain the
rationale for a deliberate Vio-

For Visitations Violations

By HENRY WILHELM

The controversial caseuof ll-
legal Visitatinns, which résulted
in the suspension of three stu-
dents {or the remainder of this
semester and all of next semes-
ter, is the result of a Complex
chain of events in which good
intentions on the part of many
students and some faculty mem-
bers went awry when the case
became enmeshed in me col~

Last Friday the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs, com-
posed ot tour voting taculty
members, advised by the deans
and Joseph Wail, (history),
chairman oi the iacuity, sus-
pended Robert Hanenberg,
Frank Knowllon and Michele
Anderson, all juniors, for a visi.

' Hanenberg spent the night

in his oﬁvcan-ipus apartment

Wllll Anderson, his girlfriend

for nearly two years, and

Knowlton was with a girl

home on “medical leave” [or
psychiatric reasons.

The three students appealed
the Friday decision of the com-
mittee and the case was heard
again on Tuesday. The commit.-
tee rejected the appeal.

.The 5&8, through various
sources. has definite knowledge
that when the committee first
heard the case, the members
voted unanimously in lavor oi
suspending the students for the
rest of this semester, and to
prohibit them from taking their
final semester exams, This
wuuld have meant the students
would receive no academic
credit for the semesters’ work
