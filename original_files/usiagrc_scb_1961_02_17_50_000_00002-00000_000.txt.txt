Our “Choice”

. Amid cries of "Iowa llber alles,’
loud Gatcs' speaker descr ing the Witch, and the blarc of
the Witch descry ng celibacy, three student council presi-
dential candidates have here and there managed to get a
serious word in edgewise.

Now we‘ve'heard them, and we’re still not very excit-
ed. The big,y problem as we see it, is, neither are they. In
none of tlle candidates have we been able to see the en-
thusiasm and true leadership qualities which charactei'ed
out—going; president, Duane Ki'ohnke; the fire just isn’t
tllere.

it’s no easy job, when the candidates appear to be
equally innocuous to choose 'the least innocuous. Our
attempts are only feeble ones at best. However, this is
the race aiid its problems as we see them. The most im-
portant questions seem to concern the 'NSA closely asso—
ci~ ted with the whole matter of national affairs discussed
here last week, and the new constitution problems, that is,
how to translate all those many new directions into action.
Both call for strong leadership. Tnere are among the
three platforms some flashes of keen insight into student
government, and at once some of the dllllest, most unorig-
inal “padding” we have heard since the times of “milksop
Student Councilism.”

Cameron Hendershot returns resplendent with know-
lcllgc from an enlightening semester at American 'liVe)‘~

alone does not make him a candidate of the same metal.
Ilendershot may bring to theoffice a good academic back
ground iii politics; and theoretically anyway, the best know .
ledge of what student government might to be However,
as we see it, student government must be mole than an
end in itself. The Hendershot approach, though certainly.
we will admit, a more adamant-one than Thomsons oi"
rlzllama‘s, seems a little and pedestrian. His stand
against NSA membership and the limits he attaches to tlle‘

scope of student government seem short-sighted to us, and rupresenlulivc, two-party cystem.’presldcnl grow- lushly in every

definitely not imbued with the Krohnke spirit we admire.
If Mr. Hendershot has the best instincts of a leader, llis‘
narrow platform prevents lls from whole-hearted support‘
of this candidate from Dibble. l

Gof Thomson's platform at this point looks muclli
better than it did a week ago, when he couldn't make up
his mind whether he favored prepping or not, or lusl}

situation and is equipped with more experience andl

lllltinns than the others. He is willinlr to take a:
