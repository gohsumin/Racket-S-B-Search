$l700 Scholarships
Offered by K. Gibbs‘

Two national scholarships iot-
college senior girls are offered for:
1965-1966 by the Katharine Gibbs
School. These awards were estab-
lished in 1935 as a memorial to
Mrs. Katharine Gibbs, founder
and Iirst president or the school.

Each scholarship consists of lull
tuition ($1,200) tor the secretarial
tramlng course, plus an additionali
cash award of $500 [otallng $1,700,
The winners may select any one
of the tour Gibbs schools for their
trainingiBoston, New York, Mout-
tlall‘, or Providence.

Winners are chosen by the Schol-
Il'slllp Committee on the basis of.‘
college academic record, personal
and character qualilications, finan-
cial need, and potentialities for
success in business.

Each college or university may:
recommend two candidates, andl
each candidate must have this on}
ﬁcial endorsement. Students who)
may be interested in competing for]
one of these Katharine Gibbs;
awards may obtain iull intormation i
from llle college placement bureau.

 

Members. of the committee
are: Donna Dagenals, Peggy
Gerber, Anne Hoganson. Joan
Lovejoy, Daria Fredericks,
Larinda Yeisley, Janice Linnell,
Christina Swanson, Ellen Det-
ertng and lrene Blaser.

They will work on two pro-
jects. The llrst will be an at-
tempt to simplify the forms
presently used when women
students leave town and return.
It is hoped that this will facili-
tate the use of the forms so
that all women will be accur-
ately signed out when they
leave. Sign-out forms are used
mainly so that contact with the
student can be made easily in
case or an emergency,

The second project will be
the possibility or an over-all

parental permission form to be
maintained on tile for each stu-
dentl This would eliminate the
need for express written per
mission from the woman’s par-
ents each time she wishes to
visit off campus

The committee will use in-
formation gathered by a simi-
lar group last spring. and also
has many examples of the
forms used at other colleges.
Miss Young explained when a
plan is established, it will be
submitted for Senate approval.
Appropriate handbook changes
would then be made and the
plan put into use. This will most
likely not be ﬁnished until
spring, so that the plan would,
be in use leginning in Septemr
her next yrar.
