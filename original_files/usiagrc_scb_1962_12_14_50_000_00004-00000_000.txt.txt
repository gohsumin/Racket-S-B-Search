After dropping two away cone
tests, to Lawrence and Ripon,
,Knox drubbed both highly rated
iCoe and Beloit last weekend,

THE SIWASHEns rely main—
ly on a fast break, passing of-
fense, and employ a zone and

tense.

Grinnell coach John Pfitsch
expects to run up against a zone
defense tonight, since the Pin»
neers were unable to fathom
simIlar defenses used by Carle-
ton and Cornell.

PFITSCH FEELS that the
Knox game will be a real chal-
lenge. Having taken only one of
,the first four contests has led
to a morale problem on the team,
and a victory now is necessary
if the boys are to snap out of it

He said the squad recognizes
the “need to come back", and
declares “We’re not throwing
in the sponge. People will
know about us before welre
through this year."

Following the game tonight
the team WIIl get a short vaca—

part in a holiday tournament to
be held in Grinnell December
23 29 The Pioneers won the
tournament last year, beating out
’Knox, Chicago, and Colorado
College, who are also this years
entrants.

On January 3 the Pioneers

,will play at Beloit.
