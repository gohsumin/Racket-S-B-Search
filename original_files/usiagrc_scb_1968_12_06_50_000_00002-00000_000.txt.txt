in the Social Studies division,
the major innovation has been
the creation of the Social Stu-
dies course, a required 2-semes-
(er course which replaces last
year‘s Historical Studies

The Haveman Report has
caused the History Department
to consider the need tor more
basic courses in European his-
tory. Such courses are being
planned. The department has
also dropped the required senior
leminar and increased the num»
ber of seminars open to Juniors.
{this semester, seminars on
Imperialism are being oilered.
Next semester the topics are
urban problems and modem
Russia. Other trends in the (le-
partment include presenting
courses with language work, and
increasing course work in Afro-
American history.

The American Studies Depart-
ment has stopped requiring that
majors take courses in an, phi-
losophy, and sociology. instead,
American Studies majors will
take upper division general edu-
cation courses in areas other
than American Studies.

Mn Nichols, a guest professor
next semester, will teach two
courses in Alrookmerican lit<
erature, which may become per-
manent parts of the curriculum.

The newest development in
the Anthropology Department
next semester will be the course
“Anthropology of the Soviet
Union and Satellites.”

Other changes brought about
by the Haveman Report have
been more subtle. In many
courses, emphasis has been
shifted as a result of the com-
mittee's work. It has been
looked upon by many iaculty
members as a mandate to
Iearch for new ways of pre-
[renting course material and
Ideas.

By JONATHAN JENKINS

The six private dining rooms
in the Forum which seat from
four to twenty people may be
reserved by campus organiza
tions, committees, and other
student or faculty groups for
lunch or dinner, Monday
through Friday, and may be
used for small group meetings
as well as tor dining. Adjoining
the dining rooms are two kitch-
enettes which students may re-
serve to prepare their own din—
hers.

Mrs. Hawk, the Forum direc-
tor, said that both the kitchen-
ettes and the dining rooms were
being used more than ever this
year. The private dining rooms
are used by the Student Allairs
committee, by dormitories that
invite faculty members and
their wives to have dinner with
them, by the ﬁnance commit-
tee, by such groups as the
Y.R.’s, Lhe Y.D.’s, the Grinnell
College Christian Fellowship,
as well as the Friars, the MM-
tar anrd, and AWS. They are
also used for discussion groups
who wish to meet with guest
speakers or lecturers, and ac-
casionally tor bridge lessons in
the evening.

Students use the kitchenettes
frequently for making dinners
with dates, and for small
parties; a few use them simply
for baking. 0n the whole, they
seem to enjoy rising them and
find them very well equipped.

One of the complaints that
students have concerns the lack
or privacy in the kitchenettes.
There is a rule that when the

Carleton

Labor and management are
negotiating their ﬁrst contract
at Carleton College this year.
The non-student service em-
ployees ot the college voted to
ulllanize last month, and have
presented their tirst demands.
The position or the college is
that it granted generous wage
increases at the start of the
year and the budget lor the lis-
cal year is already set. The
union reportedly is seeking in»
creases in wages of up to forty
percent.

kitchenettes are in use. the our»
tains may not be pulled. Even
it they were closed, they are,
according to one student, like
a Iishrnet, so that it is possible
to see through them. Several
students brought this problem
111); one girl said that the
kitchenette: are “like small
ﬁshbowls which everyone can
see in.” The only other toult
which was found with them was
the ﬁve dollar deposit Which is
required betore students may
use the kitchenettes. One stu-
dent telt that there should be
some other way to get students
who have broken something to
pay.

The private dining rooms and
hitchenettes seem to be serving
a purpose in providing not only
a place where students can
meet with other students and
faculty members, but also a
place where various organiza-
tions can get together. They are
quite popular; however, it
seems that their success would
be even greater if more privacy
could be provided.
