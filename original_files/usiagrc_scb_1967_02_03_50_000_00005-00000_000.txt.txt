Indian Intonation

By Jane Geffken

Bobbie Welser

South lndian Classical music,
as exemplified by Friday
night’s concert, Is like a psy-
chedelic experience without
psychedelics. It is hard to de»
scribe the essence of the
music: kaleidoscopic a p h r o
dislac? liberating? inebriating’i’
Truly, it had to be heard to
be described. However. the
group’s MC, Dr. Robert Brown,
ethnomusicologist at Wesleyan
University. did answer some
general questions about the
background of the music and
the training of the musicians.

South Indian classical music
ls essentially religious in char
acter. In India, the sacred is
not separate (tom the secular;
rather, both are part of a
religious sensibility which is a
way or llie. The text at indian
music is devotional, and some
Sanscrit texts originated with
the Vedas in 3000 EC. How-
ever the musical form I5 con-
stantly developing, and some
compositions are quite recent.

An Indian child. it chosen by
his parents to become a musi-
cian, begins studying at the
age at rive or six when he
goes to live with his teacher. .
It is the parents' responsibility
to select a good instructor; if
the Child fails. the parents
are blamed. The teacher sup-
ports the child, and the child
periorms menial labors in ad-
dition to his intensive study.

Females may also be chosen
for the profession; many he-
come singers or vena players.
interestingly, the young musi-
cian-inrtraining is not taught

Although there is no discern-
lble correlation between West-
em and Indian solieggio, (syl-
lahles applied to scale degrees),
it is possible that our western
solieggio was derived from the
lndian system. As Dr. Brown
explained, the Greeks claim
that their music comes from
India. Since we have derived
many oi our iundamentals or
music from Greek modes and
notation, it Is possible that our
system is in some way derived
trom lndian origins.

One of the components of the
ensemble consists of the tame
bore, or drone, which provides
a continuum ot underlying
tones; a relerenoe point, or, in
Dr. Brown's Words, "the cash
vas on which the picture is
painted." The other components
are the drum, which is largely
improvisational, the violin, and
the voice.
