Lecturer Amstutz Gives Talk
About Sickness, Evil, Theology

Jakob Amstutz, Swiss prolessol-
and theologian now a visiting prtr
tessor at Pittsburg University, lec-
tured to a near-capacity audi-
ence in Roberts Theatre last
Thursday, Nov. 4. In the first ape
peat-ance or his 4—day visit, Am-
htutl dealt with the subject “Sick-
ness. Evil, and Theology," based
on the works or Sartre, Camus,
Ind Kafka.

According to Amstutz, a great
deal of modern literature, exem-
pliiied by that DI the three au-
thors above, is “toxic" literature,
dealing with sickness and evil as
major themes. He admitted that
this type of literature had always
been with us, citing authors such
as Goethe, Rilke and Peer He
reels, however, that these early
examples were mainly unpremed.
itated explosions of intensity and
emotion, otten serving a cathartic
purpose tor the author. in con-
trasr. the last 25 years have seen
an increase in the “number and
crudeness of descriptions of sick-
ness and evil. . ,," and this “down-
ward pointing" literature seems
to be "conscious and systematic. .

He described the sickness por-
trayed in these works as a “lack
of inner control of man over him-
self. . 4" either a lack of moral
strength or a strength that con-
sists of perversion.

Evil is defined as any external
compulsion which degrades and
dehumanizes man. This may be
animalization, machinery, or an
evil person or persons

Amstutz felt this “toxic" or
“black" literature causes three
slcknesses among those who are
not trained to read it correctly,
The first is snobhishness: the cre-
ation of virtue from necessity, the
pride in pessimism as a sign of
intelligence. The defeatist has
much the same attitude as the
snob, but lacks his sense of virtue
and is left with nothing but a tech

ing of ”, . .tl'le senselessness of
opposing it."

The third sickness is a theologi-
cal one, employing black litera-
ture as support tor the view or
man's weakness and evil, and his
complete dependance on the grace
or God. This leads to rigid dogma

Phi Beta Kappa Lecturer Compares
Arthurian Legends and ‘Beasi Epics'

Professor W. T. Hr Jackson of
Columbia University spoke on
Thursday, NWT 4, at the annual
Phi Beta Kappa lecture. Jackson
spoke on the topic “Shining
Knights and VFiltby Beasts,” two
views or medieval society.

In his analysis of medieval lit-
erature, Jackson dlﬂerentiated be-
tween the two major schools of

medieval literature, the Arthurian
romance and the “beast epic."
The latter school refers to a series
or stories in which animals take
on h u m a n characteristics Al-
though the Arthurian romances
with their myths have endured, the
beast-epic presents a more realis<
tic picture of medieval society,
according to Jackson.
