mitted to the Senate for ap-
proval. The meeting was orig-
inally scheduled for Nov. 4: it
will now take place on Nov.
11. All of the committees have
submitted rough drafts oI their
proposals, and synthesis and
organization of the material is
now taking place, with various
members [tom the committees
participating in a rather un-
structured way. The target
date for getting the printed
statement to the student body
is Nov. 4, giving students a
week to discuss the paper
among themselves and to con-
struct amendments to the
slatement that they may feel
are necessary.

In other senate news, an
election board was set up to
plan for elections to fill the
seat or Senator Lynn Aldrich

In business last week, the
Senate requested that the Stu-
dent Coordinator’s office con-
tinue its investigation on the
possibility of having student ID
cards, The main question now
is whether the cards will be
required or optional.

Also last week. the senate
heard laculty complaints that
student government has been
lax in filling student vacancies
on studentrfaculty committees.
The senators apologized for the
delay. and attributed it large-
ly to the delay in elections last
year that denied the new sen-
ate the opportunity to fill the
committees last year.

The Senate and Student Co-
ordinator have heard come
Dlaints about the quality of
the homecoming band, the
TSU Toronados. i can only say
that I add my name to the
list oi dissatisfied students. L.

right on!

Cont. from Pg. 1
of the students, senior Larry
Frank, objected. "We want you
to stay out or this altogether,"
lie said. Most oI the students
nrcsent agreed with Frank.
“Just by calling this meeting
you're getting more involved
than you have to be. If the
FBI calls again we want you
to tell them you aren‘t going
to do anything,” Frank added.

Dean Low responded that
what the dean‘s office did the
next time the FBI called would
depend ”on the circum-
stances." The Clean oi students
also advised the students of
their legal rights, including
their right not to even see the
FBI unless subpr‘naed. Dean
Low gave the students the
FBI number in Des Moines
and told them they could “call
collect" il they wanted to talk
to the agents. She also iniorm-
ed the students that the col-
lege would not turnlsh any stu—
dent records to the FBI unless
legally ioroed to do so. “Even
in that case we would probably
fight it,” Said Low.

Frank and five other stu-
dents met with Leggett Tues-
day atternoon to ask that the
college cease its “intermediary
role” Dean Wall also attended
the meeting. Both Leggett and
Wall later told the 8&3 that
they did not at first see the
distinction the students had in
mind. After extended discus
sion, however, it was agreed
that the college would no

“I think the college still has
an obligation to tell a student
that the FBI is looking for him
it we know that. Also, just as
the college provides counsel-
ling on dratt iniormation. we
have an obligation, ! think, to
advise students of their legal
rights.” said Wall.

“We have asked the FBI to
notify us it they will be on
campus,” added Leggett. “in
this way we can hopefully
contact students and advise
them of their rights before
they are contacted by the
FBI."

According to
who had talked with FBI
agents, the investigators are
looking into the possibility of
charges tor “crossing state
lines to incite a riot.” This is
a federal offense under which
the Conspiracy 8, national
anti»war leaders, are current
ly being tried in a Controver-
sial Chicago trial.

The student told :1 Des
Moines Register reporter that
the agent told her at ”my
moral duty to my country" and

asked her when her room»
mate “loll for Chicago, how
she got there, who she left
with, and whether or not she
was usually in her room at
night."

Her roommate, Kay Sophar,
was found guilty of disorderly
conduct and resisting arrest in
Chicago on Oct. 24. She said
she pleaded guilty alter the
prosecuting attorney said
that he would “amend the
charges” against her it she
requested a jury trial, The
prosecutor, shortly before the
trial, told Miss Sophar he
would ask a $500 fine if She
pleaded guilty and {or the
maximum penalty or $1,000 if
she pleaded innocent. She was
fined $500.

in another Chicago court
case involving a Grinnell stu-
dent, freshman Deborah Feldr
man had charges dismissed
when the prosecution claimed
no contest, Miss Feldman,
whose trial was also on Oct.
24, was originally charged
with “ninning from the scene
of a broken Window." The
charge was later changed to
disorderly conduct.
