Frosh tie, Varsity lose
in Monmouth meet

The varsity track team lost a dual
with Monmouth 8357, Tuesday, but the
freshmen squad tied the Scots 6137.

Thor Evenson led the Pioneer effort,
winning the pole vault at 9‘6” and the
440 intermediate hurdles with a 57.3.
He took seconds in the high jump, broad
jump, and 120 highs, Rich Weeks won
the javclin with a 162’11" and the discus
with a 130’6”r He placed second in the
shot put. Jon Buswell took the broad
jump with zc'ic", and Doug Dray tin-
ished second in the mile and two—mile,
The varsity goes to Mt. Vernon to meet
Cornell Tuesday.

The freshman effort was marked more
by a desire to compete than by actual
proficiency. if a Pioneer frosh wanted
to try an event, the chances were that
some poor Monmouth competition could
be found. Showing admirable courage
was Grinnell's Art Andrews, who enter-
ed the 440 hurdles with no previous ex-
perience. He won, with a 1:07.5r Andrews
also won the high jump. Ralph Graham
took the pole Vault, Chris Meyer won
the shot put, Jack Rued threw the win-
ning javelin, and Steve Carroll hurled
the best discus.

l IM sports

North Campus continues to plod along,
hampered only slightly by the inclement
weather which typifies a Grinneil spring.
Surprises have been many, and with the
season halt over, the number of teams
with a chance tor the championship has
dwindled to about six. Smith has had
the hardest time of the contenders,
dropping three games since l picked
them to Win (there has to be some cor-
relation). East duitiped them first which
was not entirely unexpected but then
West handed them thalr second loss. The
victory by West must rook with the part-
ing or the Red Sea as one or the all-time
great miracles. Rawson then continued
the string by handing them iheir third
setback in four games Cowles saw their
winning streak ended as they dropped
a henrthreaker to Rawson, 241. They
followed this up with a loss to South.
Dibble, since an opening day loss, has
knocked off five opponents in a row
and. along with East is now in the
driver’s seat in addition to softball,
golt and paddle tennis are currently
being played with no iinal iigures avail-
able as to their outcome. The last sport-
ing event oi the year will be the annual
track meet which. although not quite
in the class of the Drake Relays, is
usually one or the better run events at
the year.
