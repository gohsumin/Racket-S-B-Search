Pioneers lose to [09 Injured Harriers

34-28 A: Season Ends

By REGGIE GRAHAM

with six minutes left in last
Saturday's game, the score was
tied, 2&28. The whole game had
been very close, as the lead
changed hands seven times. A
bad play by our defensive back-
field, and a nice catch by Coa
junior letterman Mike Harris
(total receptions: 8 for 166
yards!) was good for 3s yards,
setting up the final touchdown.
Our last. slender hopes were
snuffed when, with 55 seconds
left, Gary Johnson’s 34 yard
pass was intercepted on the Coo
eight yard line.

Coe had a tough team this
year. They downed St. Olaf, Cor-
hell, and Knox and stayed ahead
of conference winner Ripon until
the last two minutes of that

ame. Both the} Pioneers and the
ohawks had identical 34 sea-
son records, going into the
game. The statistics of the Grin.
neii-Coe game show the equality
Hi the two teams. While they
were able to gain almost twice
as many yards passing, 183
yards to our 93, we were able to
gain a net of 165 yards on the
ground to their 137. We also
made 21 first downs; they, only
thirteen,

The second half began with
a Cos 62-yard touchdown drive,
followed by a Grinnell 62-yard
touchdown drive, Coe bounced
back 64 yards to scorex
not to be outdone, the Pioneers
took the ball on their 36 and
drove 64 yards to score, and
move ahead 2&2], During the
first 19 minutes of the second
half, both teams had the ball
twice, and each scored twice.
The Kohawks knotted the score
at ZE-all and ﬁnally rallied to
win on a 3 yard run by Gerstner.

The pioneer offense played an
excellent game, amassing 258
yards—165 rushing and 93 pass-
ing. Three regular offensive lined
men were out with injuries. Ra-
piacements Ralph Clayman,
Roger Roe, and Ernie Rose were
able to fill. the gaps quite well
though. Jim Edwards and Jack
Buel, who complete the middle
line, ﬁnished up very successful
seasons.

in the backfield. the team's
most valuable back, .ion Bus<

MCAC. Brian Barnes rushed 71
yards in 2o carries. Brian played
an excellent game, outrunnlng
and eluding the entire Cos de<
tense to score on a 64 yard punt
return. Roy Lewis threw a key
block which helped Brian get
started. Torn Lower had a great
day, averaging 7 yards per
carry for 21 yards.

John Winterson, one of the
finest ends to come out of Grin-
nell in a long time, finished out
his football career well, catch-
ing three passes for a total of 42
yards, one touchdown, and one
two-point conversion, John fin-
ished eleventh in conference
with 30 points.

Rick Vranek and Doll Kraitsik
both played well. Each inter-
cepted one pass on defense.

"Our team has improved
steadily since the first practice”
Coach Bowers said. This was to
be expected with so many in-
experienced yet capable sopho-
mores. Racked with injuries as
we were, however, the trend
could have easily reversed it«
self. Determination and spirit
were able to overcome this
tendency and we were able to
.iinish up with a “good season."
Coach Bowers says that he goel
away from this season with a
feeling of "enthusiasm,” with
the knowledge that the win-loss
record doesn’t tell the whole
story, and with the hope for an
even better year coming up.

The fact that all three of
next year‘s captains, Jim Ed-
wards, Larry Grimm, and Gary
Johnson, are sophomores is
some indication as to where our
strength will lie, and the addi-
tien of this year’s undefeated
prep team could mean those
hopes might be more than ”pips
dreams,"

SDS Confronts ROTC
In Football, Wins 7-6

Monday at 4:15, ROTC
and arch-enemy sos got to
gether long enough to play
a football game. After 15
minutes of play, ROTC
made the first touchdown for
six points. Immediately aft-
erwards, Brian Barnes of
the SDS team charged so
yards for a touchdown. His
extra point broke the tie,
making the score SDS 7.
ROTC 8. The game ended
without additional scoring.

Rooters for SDS. led by
cheerleaders, seemed to out~
number ROTC supporters.
But in spite of the political
differences of the players
and spectators, the atmos-
pher of the game was
friendly.

End Grim Season

By vvon sroaxuax
(Sports Editor)

The Pioneer harriers wrapped
up their 1968 season last Satur-
day in Chicago. The Grinnell
seven, slumped by injuries,
wound up a miserable eighth
out of the nine teams which
competed in the Midwest Con-
ferenca meet.

The league crown was caps
tured by St, Olaf With 42 points.
Carleton, who had won the title
seven years running, finished
second with 46 points. Coo
claimed third place (87); Mon-
mouth, fonrth (133); and Cox‘-
neil, fifth (138).

Mike Steiner, a senior at Cain
leton from Minneionka, Minns<
sofa, finished first individually.
This was Steiner's third Cori.
secutiva first place conference
finish. He, along with {our
other runners, broke the pre-
vious conference record of
20:41.3 Set in 1965 by Belolt'l

.Mlke Hartman. Steiner's rec.

ord setting performance on tho
d-mila course was 19:53.

The Grinnell story this fall
has been injuries. While they
began the season with much
promise, winning two of their
first four duals, and showed
much improvement with every
meet, injuries struck and hobs
bled the team. Four of the
seven varsity runners carried
leg injuries into the confer-
ence meet.

Eric John, a soph from Lo~
gansport, Indiana. led the team
all season. His best four mile
effort was 21:39. John Russell
(soph) and John Asbille (jun-
ior) ran well most of the sea-
son. Their best times were 22:]!
and 12:27 respectively. Round-
lng out the team were Tim
Power, soph (22.55); Bruce
Lueke, senior (23:50); John
Siekett, junior (23:50); and Bob
Dorsett, soph (24 0). it wal
Bob's first year out.

The outlook for next year ll
very exciting. Losing only one
letterman and anticipating I
healthy team, the Pioneers
could shape up as a real chal-
lenge to perennial conference
powerhouses. The fresh have
exceptional potential and should
add much needed depth to the
varsity squad.

Chuck McGrath, from Eel-
wood, Illinois, led the Trash to
a ﬁrst place finish in the
Southern Conference meet; a
Victory in their meet with the
University of Northem iowa _.
their only dual; a third place
finish in the Gl'innell Fresh«
man Invitational (6 teams)”
and third in the conference.

“He was our lead runner,"
commented Coach Obermiller,
"and potentially one of the best
distance men in Grinnell his<
wry." Chuck broke the pre-
vious freshman 3-mila record
of 16:17 with a fun of 15:09, He
topped the old f-mile mark
(22:34) in 20:39.

Phil Morales of Milwaukee
was generally the second man
on the team. His best effom
this season were 16:07 (El-mile)
and 22:05 (4-mile). Oscar Rat-
tenborg (16:44), Mark Nissan
(17: 10), Mike Daley (17:37) and
John Weins (17:47) rounded 00‘
the seven starters.

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

it is said that absence makes the heart grow Yonder, so, con-
lequently, since my column was noticably absent last week i
suppose everyone is eagerly awaiting its arrival. '

The most popular sport so far appears to be a new game
which is called musical opens. it is very similar to the game we
all played in kindergarten called musical chairs with the sole en-
ception being that musical chairs had rules. While I am, admitted-
ly, on the outside looking in, i think the object of the game is u:
have each floor in each hall determine its own rules for the game
in order to prove conclusively that people are different Such being
the case it is, of course, impossible to have any overall rules since
they would interfere with personal freedom . . . or something like
that. I obviously don't seem to have the hang of the game but
you can be sure i am making every effort to learn the rules, or
anti-rules as the case may be_ The most interesting outcome of
this new pastime came about when it was decided that each room
should have the final say in the question, A double was divided
into two rather extreme factions with one opting for 24-hour opens
and tile other for no opens. The ensuing discussion degenerated into
a street fight type of affair which, interestingly enough, also has

no rules.

Returning to the more familiar sports, Read captured LM1
swimming by a narrow margin over Dibble. or all the sports,
this one seems to have one of the smaller followings as evinced
by the fact that Dibble took second with a massive three-man

contingent.

I. M. volleyball is in full swing and, true to my predictiom
the games are characterized by enthusiasm, desire, and totally
wretched playing. At least it has the advantage of being a sport
where physical injuries are kept to a minimum unless, of course
you are rabid enough to become entangled in die net.

I hear that I. M. wrestling is in the offing again this year.
Mr_ Conney M. Kimbo has graciously consented to teach all those
interested some of the finer points of this most grueling of spam,
What is most necessary for the success of the sport is, however,
not training but paper bags. The winners can use them to deposit
their cookies in after the match and the 1. M. chairmen can usl
them to carry home losers in after their match.

Cindy’s Cinderellos Capture Trophy

By cmoy ROOT

At noon Saturday, two little
Grinneli cars. dwarfed by the
buses of the opposing teams
pulled into the Ames parking
lot, and a motley mob of min-
utemen piled out. Nobody paid

much attention. They should
have. Once on the field, the
shabby sweatpants and tat~
tered T—shlrts were forgotten
as the Grinnell girls’ hockey
team was transformed into a
finely tuned machine that
surpassed all other teams in
Iowa in finesse and stickwork.
(Are you sure you have no
RE. majors?)

Our first game against in.
we State saw the ball being
constantly bombarded at their
dismayed goalie, without an
overwhelming amount of suc-
cess, in other words—no
goals. Finally, in the last 3
minutes, Mimi broke the spell
and slammed one in—whewi

Our next rival, Drake Uni-
versity, offered no competition
and paved our way to Luther.
who was also still undefeated.
We fast remedied that, and
With the help of the defensive
cuts and passes, Mimi and
Cindy (who had been running
the ball down the field and

ADDRESS HEREI

whacking away at the goal all
day) easily put two in. Thll
third smear of the day earned
the Grinnell girls the right to
the finals—and boy! Were wl
fired! Here we met the iowa
Wesleyan Bruisers, who were
seething for revenge after,
their sound dunking of last
week. A little speed and
stickwork, left them far he-

.hind, and we easily scored I
2.0 victory. They are to be
commended, though, as the
only team who even got a shot
off during the four games-
and gave our poor starving
goalie Connie a chance to put
her stick on the ball.

The high points of the day
werei a goal by defenseman
Narda—who still can't believe
it: our hoi-tey . pokay dance
which completely obliterated
our opponents; and the huge
trophy which Mimi has been
mothering for the last three
days, undoubtedly getting it
ready for front and center
spot in our team picture. I‘d
say we looked ferocious
enough to scare away . . . I
mouse maybe, which just goes
to show in what's inside that
counts — or don't underestis
mate the Grinnell girlsl
