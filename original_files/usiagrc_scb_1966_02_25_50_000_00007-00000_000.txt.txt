AWS Board President Chris Pets
arson said that she was not sure
whether the new weekend loggi-
locklng system would take effect
this weekend.

Only Four Open

The new system calls for only
four South Campus inggia doors to
be open at hours on weekends.
These doors will be Main, Hairles,
Haines driveway, and Loose. The
other doors will be closed prior to
hours, the exact time to be desig-
nated later.

The Senate also considered a
proposal by Clark hall senator Ron
Ficus that phone home on North
and South Campus be extended to
ll or 11:30 pm. on weeknights.

SGA President Jerry Goddard
said that it would take “many
committees and many, many weeks
before we could get anywhere"
with extending phone hours. He
agreed. however, to discuss the
plan with the deans‘ committee.

Voting Privilege:

Discussion at extending voting
privileges to students in the infirm~
aly was another order of business
at the meeting. Dick Baiiiy, Cowlea
house president, said that there
should be some method devised to
issue absentee ballots to persons
Conlmed in the health center. Sen-
ator Jane Stl'acke of Main hall ad-
ded that SAGA workers whose
schedules do not permit time to
vote should also be given a way to
vote.

Goddard put the ideas into reso-
lution form stating that the elec-
tion board will investigate the pos-
sibililies oi extendlng voting priv-
ileges to infirmary patients and
SAGA workers.
