Weyrauch Concocts Menu for Good Student Government
Mainlngredient—Appetizing Fare of Meaty Leadership

Lately, people have been
coming up and talking to me on
central campus about the un-
savory student government at
Grinnell. The consensus seems
to be that there is an unsatis-
fied hunger for government that
is not in bad taste.

I have applied a great deal
of thought to this problem, and

it has boiled down to the fact '
that the only way to bring good ‘

taste back into student govern-
ment is for me to run for SGA
president as SAGA’S Fayorite
Son.

After carefully studying the '

Various candidates and their
platforms, I sincerely feel that
I am the only man with the
right recipe to Vitaminize the
malnutrition which is so 'de-
spairingly evident at Grinnell,

I feel that the piece de re-
sistance in the present refec-
tion of student life is the SGA
presidency. This is THE ingred-

 

ient that needs to be spiced
up! As a very flavorful leader,
I am sure that in no time I can

 

"SKIP-IT"

find where the tasty seasonings
have been mislaid. With this
knowledge in my hands, any of-
fenders of my menu will be
stewed in their own juice.

with these more lipssmacking
measures, the first steps will be
taken towards the creation of
a new festive board for Grinnell
students, which in turn will
lead to a more culinary atmos-
phere in which the college, a la
cane, will be fed a fare of
meaty leadership that they can
really lick their chops over.

Everyone who has eaten
SAGA food knows how SAGA
reaches the heart with burning
insistency. Let me, with my
recipe for student government,
get to the heart of the probs
lems at Grinnell. If I am SGA
president, the trouble makers
in unappetizing government of-
fices will soon find their gooses
cooked.

Hannah Advocates Sinlessness via Galloping Puritanism:
Help Stamp Out Sex Alcohol, and Pseudo-lntellectualism

Before any responsible stu-
dent government is possible
there must be REVIVAL—re-
vival of the individual as a per-
so revival of the balanced in-
diVldual, campus, and govern-
ment association. I maintain
that the only possible way to
save ourselves, and our hal-
lowed school, is to repent of the
evil and wickedness to which
we have sold ourselves and
adopt the policy of Galloping
Puritanism. As earlier aspir-
ants for this office I also am
against Puritanism that merely
creeps. Concern for Puritan-
ism must not be allotted to a
Faculty - Student committee
where it will be
around for a year or two,
dropped in disgust and frus-
tration, and then forgotten as
the committee members leave
Grinnell. Galloping Puritanism
must be inspired Within each
heart so that as capable indi-
viduals we may act in a rea-
sonable and responsible way.

On this campus there are
four major vices that have
claimed the hearts, minds, and
souls of many of the brethren.
Sex, alcohol, over or pseudo-

b attered‘

 

intellectuallsm, and the desire
for the powers of government
and legislation over fellow stu-
dents. Sin, yes my brethern I
said SIN, is the selling of the
totality of the Whole person,
spirit, mind, body, and desires
to one of these evils. The only
way that it is possible for you
to wipe this evil and sin from
your hearts, minds, and ac-
tions is to adopt Galloping
Purltanism completely and
practice it until once again,
with Hannah’s help, you are
able to see in perspective the
full human possibility.

That goyernment is best
which governs, and does not
lose itself in oiling and nour-
ishing the machine. As presi-
dent Of the SGA I intend to put
this principle into practice.
Open rooms at all times that
when the brethern feel the spir-
it they may gather for hymn
sings. Weekly trips, via Cov-
ered Wagon, into various sin-
ful Grinnell suburbs that those
who have sold themselves into
intellectualism may remember
that try as they might they
are still in and of this world.
One half hour compulsory re-

vival services held before
classes that we may go forth
with the joy of salvation in our
hearts and some common relies
ious ground on which to build
a student life and government.

Oh yes Brethren, REPENT!
Forsake the ways of Main’s
passion pit and dimly lit Una
ion. Purge thyself of the evils
of alcohol, rescue thyself from
the fate of an individual traded
in for a beaker of brew. Leave
off concern for your next meal
for it is merely sustainance for
the true living experience. .
Pledge yourself to spend at
least two hours a day away
from the evils of losing your
seli in the pursuit of words,
pages, and grades. Remember
that it does not take twenty
sets of senate committees and
courts to interpret a simple one
sentence rule that we accepted
when we joined ourselves to
Grinnell and that exists simply
that there may be some order
in the chaos of existence (apol-
ogies to PGK).

REPENT! Forsake unworthy
ultimales! Follow Hannah to
the true way! Hallelujah!

 

Hallelujah Hannah
