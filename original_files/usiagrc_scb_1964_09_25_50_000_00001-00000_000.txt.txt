Brogan looks at British Politics,
Predicts Close General Election

ay sun Taylor

The results of the British
General Election will be close.
Sir Dennis Brogan, visiting pro-
fessor of American Studies,
predicted in the first of a series
of lectures Tuesday night. Bro-
gan, who is a prolific writer
and holder of multiple degrees,
also emphasized that he makes
no claim to be a political
prophet and will not predict
which of the two m'ajor parties
in Great Britain will be suc-
cessful in its bid for control of
the government.

Eight months ago. he said.
the polls showed the liberals
with about a seventy per cent
majority. Now the parties are
running about fifty-fifty.

Brogan explained that no
matter which party wins the
election. there will probably be
a recasting of British politics,

 

Beset By Injuries, Pioneers Open Season Against Ripon;
loss of Lettermen Opens Five Key Positions on Squad

After last Saturday’s intra—
squad game Grinnell’s football
team opens the season for real
against Ripon on Ward Field
tomorrow.

Facing the problem of filling
five key positions coach Edd
Bowers has built a team with
size, depffh and experience. The
Pioneers will probably field an
all ietterman offensive team
and a defensive unit with only

one or two non-lettermen,

Missing from last year’s
squad are all conference guards
Steve Warrick and Pete Hein-
zelman, fullback Joel Goldman,
quarterback Dick Orchard and
end .Tl’m McKlveen. All were
offensive starters,

Bowers has moved J eff
Lewis from the defensive line
to team wich Larry Miller, who
saw offensive action last year

when Heinzelman was injured,
to fill in at guard. Marty Rin-
go, hampered last year by in-
juries, is slated to replace
Goldman while Denny Hanssen
and Barry Anderson are ex—
pected to provide a double
threat at quarterback.

To Our Readers:

We ask your indulgence—
the 5&1} is going through I
period of re - organization

Meanwhile, you might consi -

split in that party. The left
wing of the liberal party may
become more socialist, he
said, and the rest may become
something like the American
Democratic Party.

On the other hand, Brogan
suggested that if the Conserva~
tive Party were to lose the gen-

 

eral election, they would prob'<
ably survive the defeat better.
but there would be a fight f0!
power among the leaders of the

party.

Explaining some of the mac
chanics and issues of the eieo-
tion, he emphasized that tho
British people see experience
in Government as important be-
cause when one party is in
power, it does not, as Ameri-
can parties sometimes do, see
lect cabinet members from the
other. Thus a limited group ol
people in the party in power
actually have any experience
particular in i n t e r nation
events.

Brogan said that British poll-
tics are becoming more presi-
dential, He explained that till
personality of the candidate
matters little, but that his im-
age is very important Tho
party name wins the votes, be-
cause the man running is only
the leader of his party

He also commented that there
has' been a somewhat revived
interest in local contests devel-
oping in recent elections.
