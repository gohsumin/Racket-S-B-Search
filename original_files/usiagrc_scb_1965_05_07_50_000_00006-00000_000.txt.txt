; Grinnellians View Modern Monas

By David Dillon

' “All of us left Conception
with a firm conviction that a
new priesthood has risen up in
American Catholicism.” This
comment by Paul Kuntz (phil-
osophy) aptly sums up the im~
pressions oi the ten Philosophy
Club members who, along with
Kuntz, visited Conception Ab-
bey and Seminary, a Benedic~
tine monastery and college
near Maryville, Missouri, Sat-
urday and Sunday, April 24th
and 25th.

Because F ath e r Gabriel
Franks ol' Conceptlm was un-
able to come to Grinneli to
speak on the philosophy of
Aquinas, the ten students left
Grinnell Saturday morning, ar-
riving at Conception in mid-ai-
ternoon. These included: Phyl-
is Lamb, Judy Johnson, Elaine
Cook, Martha Goodman, Ken
Adelman, David Dillon, Bob
Barrow, Bob Calltwell, Ron
Lane, and Don Bogue, as well
as Kuntz,

After their reception at theE

guest house of the Benedictine
Sisters of Clyde, they drove to
the seminary, meeting Father
Gabriel and a number of stu—
dents in the candy shop—an
informal union where Seminal“
ians may gather for refresh—
ments. Our hosts were college
students much like Ourselves,
participating in a fourryear lib-
eral arts undergraduate pro-
gram with a major in philos-
ophy. Following this, they plan

to complete another four
years of graduate study in
theology, after which they will
be ordained.

Father Gabriel discussed
“Thomas Aquinas and the Mod-
ern World,” Saturday after—
noon, He reminded his audience
that Christian philosophy in the
ancient and early medieval
worlds had followed the dual-
istic Concepts of Plato and his
ﬁo‘llower Plotinus, There was a
drastic division between a
man's physical body and his im-
mortal spirit. An early hymn
referred to the body as a “pris<
on” from which to escape. St
Augustine wrote of a rational
mind within a mortal body.
This point of view, which p
meated Benedictine monastic-
ism, ran counter to early Jew-
ish belief and the Christian con-
viction that me Son of God was
incarnated as a complete hu—
man being. Yet this dualism
still persisted, and is reflected
in such existentiallst works as
Sartre‘s Nausea and in the con-
cept oi pDSiLivlsm—the belief

,that all phenomena may be ex-

pressed in material or quantita
tive terms.

Thomas, however, affirmed
that the body and soul were of
one substance, although the
spirit was immortal. The ma-
terial world was good—some-
thing not to be escaped, but to
be embraced, This concept of
essential unity in the universe

and perhaps Whitehead—«Father
Gabriel believed to be the only
tenable viewpoints in the face
of modern technology.

The question was raised as
to whether Thomas or Teilhard
dc Chairdm could properly
c o m bin e philosophical and
scientific language. More gen—
erally, can concepts such as
aesthetic beauty and moral
goodness, usmg different scales
of measuremeni, be correlated?
Dr. Manly, a colleague of Fa-
ther Gabriel's, took pains to
demonstrate Thomas’ separa-
tion of philosophy and science
as specilic subjects, although
he was willing to affirm along
with Father Gabriel the concept
of “unity in diversity.”

The lecture and discussion
were followed by Mass in the
monastery church, an example
or the Romanesque revival.
The Mass was carried out in
concelebration; that is, several
priests represented the con-
gregation in accepting the sac
rament. Also noteworthy were
the many hymns and responses
in English,
