A Hankie To Shipley

A handkerchief to Ml Shiplev so he can nipe the
mail from his eyes. Conti 1y to some populai opinlo: s
we think Shipley has done a satisfactory Joli. In spite of.
accusations of hanl1’_ panky, dealing under the table and
from the bottom of the deck. Shipley's last two concerts
have proved to be pleasant entertainment.

job. a thankless and most difficult one, has its
pi'lililem The student bodv is seldom pleased before a'
concert. To the social co—oldinatcl' falls the job of being
leader, educator and new—idea man, rather than the re-
flector (if all campus opinion (whatever that may be). We
have often wondered how Shipley has managed to retain
a mildrmannerecl (sometimes perhaps too mild-mannered)
countenance when faced by the good ole hummin’ an‘
strummin’ an’ singing" Josh White crew who have never
seen Anna Russell or the Gomez dancers, and “darn we”
aren’t going to!” Shipley is to be commended for rising
above the good-ole»let’s notetryea11ythiiig-henxcauseit’s—iiot~
sale tradition.

One thing which Shipley has done we would like to see
more (if. The correlation between concert enterdinment.
and other events on campus as in the Gomez t1'oupe»LAC-
e\pe1iment (and how they all screamed aliunt that one)
we thinkvl was most succe'sflll and deserve further consid-

in. This sort of thino’ might be looked into before
the spring fine-arts fe‘ i\al.

A second area in which Shipley was less succe 111 is
coiioeined with that much- Allietlv‘dlmlllrlnlt-neVel'rn'luCh-'
done -about suwgestion of securing cheaper, not so well-
11111111111 enteltainment. What ever happened to a second
Cene Bluestein concert?

The difficulty here, of course. 5 that we can’t have
our cake and eat ll.«t00. Right now there is only so much'
money; it's either a lot of small concerts or one big one.
Furthermore, this sort of approach requires of the social
eo-urdinator a wealth of experience and a good deal more
digging: than has previously been done.

One w v out could be the recently suggested laise in
the acti\lt1ts fee. We would favol 'uch an increase were
it kept well uithin leasun and new it used l'lil some 1eall
solid enteitainnient such as tli t Shipley ha‘ bloulg'ht. We
would not favor an incr which \\1iul1i lie used for more'
lounge parties. Union parties, women's gym parties, mens
locker room parties, boiler room parties et al.

I11 any case we wish the new co-ordinatur Eill Herman
much luck and suggest that perhaps he should lingin
building on the groundwork that Shipler has already
(llllte_ahly provided.
