Last Sunday, Monday and Tiles-
day, Orin F. Nolting, Executive
Director of the International City
Manager's Association: Visited the
Grinnell campus as the 1966 Mur-
ray Seasongood Good Government
lecturer. Monday night Nolllng
spoke in Souih Lounge in slu-
denls and inculty members on
“New Horizons and Challenges in
Urban Development.”

Nolling discussed lhe major eco-
nomic and social changes taking
place in the country today and
spoke of government attempts to
set up regional economic districts.
He also emphasized the increasing
importance at and necessuy for
more city managerial systems in
cope with problems arising in ur-
baii aliairs,

One of [hesa problems concerns
the outgrowth oi suburban areas
from the major cities. By 1980 it
is predicied that the suburbs will
have 60 million more people than
the city proper,

”in the past twenty years,"
Noliing said, “suburbs have
grown forty times as fast as the
central cities. Today many subur-
banites work in the suburbs rath-
er than in the central city.”

The increasing n u m b e r of
younger iamilies living in the sub
urban areas have given support on

 

city manager systems, because

lhese people “are more ready in
accept city planning." A problem
arises since the major cities be-
come hemmed in by the other in-
corporated cities and can’t expand
because of them. “The suburbs
don’t want to give up their gov-
ernment and become part of the
bigger clues," Nolling said,

He stated ihal there is an in-
creasing role at the federal gov-
ernment In city chairs {a decrease
the amount oi “local autonomy.”
In the lield of cultural activities,
for example, the trend is “more
and more toward _help from the
government in local aclivilies in
planning and ﬁnances.”

Several plansare being consid-
ered to deal with the various llr<
ban diiiicullies according to Nolt<
ing. The ﬁrst plan is to slrihc a
balance between the local and fed-
eral governments by turning parl-
nerships. Next. there should be
planning for wider areas on sub-
jects oi public Works and welfare.
Third, the existing conli'ols should
he reshaped by adopting a build.
ing code and zoning controls. Then
the fiscal system‘should be re-

marked thal. not enough people

He stressed the need ior a college
education to work in public ser-
vice but implied that graduate
studies aren’t as necessary and
said, “City management is more
of an art man a selence.”
