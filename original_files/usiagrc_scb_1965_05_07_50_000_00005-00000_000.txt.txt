Labor Organization leader Blanchard

Speaks at ‘Student

By Don Winney

What may be another Grin-
nell tradition, the student-less
coffee hour, was held Wednes-
day afternoon in South Lounge
Three students and th0 re
porters gathered to hear David
5. Blanchard, deputy director
of the Washington, D, C
branch of the lLO (lnternatio

and the pre-law club.

ILO tried to establish an inter
national labor code to deal
with working conditions. Child

abuses. Recognizing die need
for cooperative action to pre-
vent social unrest, the ILO first
concentrated in the industrial
nations, where labor conditions
often fed political turmoil.
Former Secretary of Labor
James Mitchell has Called the
ILO of this period “one of the
strongest weapons against coma
munist actions and ideas.”

Today, affiliated with the UN,
the 11.0 is increasingly con—

omies of underdeveloped coun-
tries. Operating on a {orty mil-
