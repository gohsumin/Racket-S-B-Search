Faculty Council Kills

Interim l970,aproposal con-
ceived by Eugene A. Herman of
the mathematics department,
met last week with ﬂat rejec-
tion. The program, which was
to have taken place between
semesters here atthe college,
was to have involved avariety
of communities and people ,
students, faculty, townspeo-
ple, area alumni, andparents.
The interim wouldhaveallow-
ed for classes and formats
that ordinarily cannot be taut
ght during the regular school
year. Some of the proposed
seminars were similar to Fri
ee University offerings and
included organic farming,
psychology of personality, ph-
ilosophy of psychology, films
and fllmmaking, automobile
mechanics, computer progra-
mming, the military~industrc
ial establishment, black and
white phomgraphy, and waste
disposal problems of Grinnell
industries.

Why was such a proposalree
jected by the Faculty Execu-
tive Council and President
Leggett? Their reasons were
several and widespread. The
contention was that opening
the school for an estimated
270 people at this time would
be too costly and that anearly
opening prior to second sem-
ester would involve problems
in housing, food, social, and
educational facilities. Also,
their decision was partially
based on the poor turnout at
the drug conference and other
recent symposiums. It was
feared that student participa
tion would be lacking. Inaddi-
tion, the Faculty Executive
'Council feared that a failure

These can be only loosely
termed "modifications" of

the Clotfelter proposal, since'

they implicitly reject (by ac
cepting even onerequirement)
the rationale which is the
heart of Clorfelter' s Proposal
III of the FacultySummerStu-
dy Committee.

Time allowed the faculty to
squabble only about the two
semester requirement. Andin
keeping with the gelding ofthe
Clotfelter proposal, discus
sion centered not upon the
suppositions involved in any
specific requirements, but
rather upon the merits of the
humanities courses taught
here.

The debate centered upon
assertions by Edward Moore
and James Kissane (Human-
ities Division) that the course
supplied a common backgrr
ound in ”Great Books" and
provided a general level of
competence in writing and ex-
position. This latterassertion

triggered the bulk of the sub-

and asserted that more could
have been appropriated. They
also felt that the proposal pre
sented an opportunity to im-
prove the college's relations
with town, alumni andparents.
The students, however, voiced
the hope that some sort of ins
terim program will be recon-
sidered in the future.

Gene Wubbles (chemistry)
questioned whether ”writing
skills" were generic, orwher
ther, in fact, the appropriate
skills varied from discipline
to discipline, a different form
of exposition appropriate to

protracted exchange with Kis-
sane that if Humanities did
improve skills in writing, then
most of his students . . must

The question was also raised

as to what proportion of stud*
ents could be expected to take
the course were it not re-
quired. Moore estimated that
about 60% of the students could
be expected to do so.

The debate was stopped only
to allow a vote defeating the

stature to assist us in main-
taining and enhancing the bea‘
uty of the Grinnell campus."

The President also noted
that, in the past few years,
the campus has lostmore than
125 large elm trees as a re-
sult of Dutch elm disease. As
funds become available for the
replacement of these trees,
professional planning will be
important to integrate ncwpl-
antings with the existing land‘
scaping of the campus.

Another major employment
of Tyler's talents and exper-
ience will be in designing the
landscaping of Grinnell's new
physical education complex
and playing fields which are
nearing completion ofthe nor‘
th end of campus.

Tyler established the Kimr
beigly- Barn Floral, Garden
and Landscape Center in1967.
He began his career as a den
signer with the Davenport ar-
chitectural firm of Stewart,
Robison and Laffan.
