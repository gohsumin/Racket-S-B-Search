Liberate The F orum/

Last week we were approached by a student
requesting the support of the newspaper in attempts
which were in progress to gain greater student con-
trol over the management of the Forum. A certain
amount of concern was expressed over the fact that
operation of the Cafe del Foro had been an uphill
battle. Forum personnel had allegedly been making
life difficult for the students who were responsible
for running the coffee house,

We were anxious to do whatever we could in
the way of casting light on dastardly deeds or issu-
ing a clarion call to action in support of a demon-
stration of a student sense of responsibility. We also
suggested a few possible avenues of approach to the
problem of securing greater freedom in operation
of the Cafe del Foro as well as other Forum services,

We think coffee and a place to relax are good
things at three o'clock in the morning as well as
any other time of the day. There are, however, cer-
tain logistical problems involved in keeping the
Forum open late, and we commend the students who
were seeking this goal for their foresight and pa-
tience in looking into these matters. Patience ran
out a little early, however, and the ugly spectre of
“confrontation polities" once more reared its head
on the Grin ell campus.

After visits with a few, but not all, of the ad-
ministrators on this campus who have some say
about the way the Forum is operated proved fruit-
less, it was decided that a demonstration of student
responsibility would have to take place unilaterally.
Accordingly, last Saturday night, when the Forum
was scheduled to close, the students did not leave.
Some of them kept dancing in North Lounge. Some
stayed to watch a movie in South Lounge. Others
just walked around picking up cigarette butts, con-
clusively proving to the administration that they
were responsible adults.

When we asked the students responsible for this
demonstration why it had taken place, they com-
plained with bitterness about the lack of immed-
iate response on the part of the administration to
their demands for longer Forum hours. On asking
questions here and there, we discovered that at no
time had President Leggett been contacted by these
students about their feelings. Since he neither locks
his door nor disconnects his telephone when he sees
students coming, and since he is, after all, the presi-
dent of this college, whose influence would do much
to change the mind of even the most recalcitrant of
administrators, we cannot help but feel that the
students left a few stones unturned when they took
their precipitate action.

Above and beyond the question of whether or
not the action of the students was carefully thought
out is a deeper problem which is far too often com-
pletely ignored in the heat of a desire for concerted
action. The end does not justify the means. This, at
least, we should be able to learn from a liberal ed-
ucation,

In the future, if students wish to demonstrate
their responsibility as adults, it would perhaps be
better if they deign to try reason before venting
their spleen, Otherwise, we would be forced to con-
clude that Aristotle was right when he said, “, .
the young are not fit to be students of political SCI-
ence. For they have no experience of life and con-
duct, and it is these that supply the premises and
subject matter of this branch of philosophy. And
moreover they are led by their feelings; so that they
will study the subject to no purpose or advantage,
since the end of this science is not knowledge but

action.”

Letters to the Editor . . .

To The Editors:

M the editorials you have
written, I have noticed two which
were about subjects with which
I am well acquainted. The pat-
tern in both was (a) to assert
“idols" which were untrue, and
which could easily have been
checked ior accuracy, and (b)
to base opinion on these unlrulhs.

The iirsl was some weeks ago
when you asserted that Miss
Edwards' group independent
project, under American Studies
rubric, excluded males. The
opinion based on this “tact" was
that students should not be ex-
cluded from independent projects
because of sex, i suppose that
you know by now that your [acts
were wrong, though I have seen
no retraction.

Your lead editorial on April 3
is based on two untrutlls rather
than one, First, you say that Mr,
Hancock was invited by CBS to
“come to Grinnell to help come
memorate Black Martyr’s Day ”
That, actually, is a compound
untruih, He was not invited by
CBS, nor was he awarc of Black
Martyr's Day. Then you say,
compounding untruth again, that
“Dean Wall, in presenting the
motion, said that the proposal
had been brought to him by
CBS.” He said that some students
had suggested the degree. In fact,
cas did not, nor were they aware
that such a proposal had been
presented -— at least the people
in CBS with whom I have talked
were not aware of it. These unr
lrulhs, however, are convenient
to your assertion that the faculty
was “pandering” to a minority
group

I also find your opinion, in this
later editorial, open to queslion
7 even if it had been based on
Iucis. Did you object to the
degrees gIVCH to the very young
pliinler and the very young editor
during the same weekend when

Dr. King got his? (There is a
very substantial question about
whether their contributions to me
culture are as important as Mr.
Hancock’s, butthatis yet another
matter.) The level of ac-
complishment oi Grinnell alumni
who have been awarded honorary
degrees is probably somewhat
lower than that oi outsiders; even
so, can you think oi any Grinnell
student since Hallie Flanagan
who has made so substantial a
contribution to the creative field?
Can you think of any alumni who
have been judged best in the ﬁeld
by a national jury, other than Mr.
Hancock?

Taste is yet another matter, i
feel that in this case your taste
was very gross: don’t you supr
pose lhal printng that editorial
somewhat dampened the
homecoming7

The last two paragraphs do not
pertain to the clause in your
contract about ”accepted
Journalistic practice." The first
three (10' facts can be obtained
by a lhreevmlnute telephone call
do not seem to be beyond the
capacity oi either oi you or even
oi your reporters. Do you really
suppose that the freedom to state
opinion given you by the editorial
page includes a ircedom to
misrepresent easxly ascor-
talnable fact?

Charles F. Cleaver-
EDl’l‘ORS NOTE

Dean Wall, recalling his report
lo [he faculty, stated that, though
he had said only’ “some in-
ici-cslcd students" brought the
proposal lo him, he did tell the
incuiiy that Hancock was coming
lo oi-nmeii lo help commemorate
Black Martyrs' Day. A number
of lacully members have told the
5&1; lhal they received the line
presslml ii-om Wall's un-
noimcemenl that the “interested
students" were members of CBS,

Nona as H turns out, CBS did

not initiate the proposal and
Dean Wall was mistaken cone
cerning Hancock's purpose in
visiling Grinnell.

The crucial point was not so
much what was really the case
as what the faculty believed to
betlie case.

Technically, the facts were, in
part, as you stated them. We
sland firm in our criticsm of the
facult)‘simprudentactions,

To The Editors:

To clear up a few points about
Glenn Leggett’s part in the
censorship of the 1966 Grinnell
yearbook in last week’s article:
The Committee on Publications
had liltle if anything to do with
the book's censorship. Leggett
insirucicd the Committee to
instruct me that the book was
cancelled. The Committee never
even voted on the matter. Fur-
tllel‘more, while the manuscript
may have been delivered to the
College lawyer in an unopened
package, the manuscript was
Sitting in an open box in the closet
oi Leggctt’s oriice when we
lllmlly recovered it, And Leggett
did not willingly “hand the
manuscript over to Wilhelm" as
the article implied. When I
originally asked Leggett to
return lhe manuscript he
refused, I then told him that we
were prepared to take the matter
of the manuscripts ownership to
Court immediately if he did not
comply with our request. It was
only after an emotional meeting
wilh Leggetl and Ben Graham,
during which Graham iniormed
me lhal “Wilhelm, you ought to
grow up," that Leggett gave in
and returned the manuscript.

The notion that the book
"belonged to the College"
because, as editor, I was an
ompioyce oi the Committee on
Publlculiuns is patently absurd
