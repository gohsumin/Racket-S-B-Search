Nonetheless, I must take excepr
tion with his figures of speech
concerning the administration and
their policy towards students. it
seems to me that so long as the

Controversy Over Privacy Continues
As Shender Defends forum Planning

To the Etlitar:

I must lake issue with one h‘
peel of Miss Kirschner's letter 01
January 28. 1 am very sorry to
see that Forumhuitingis becomr
ing a new college pastime _ e
pecially when I recall the eagei-
ncbs with which we watched the
Forum tzlko shape in ~Elli-'64, and
the excitement With which we
pressed our noses to the glass a
year ago last tall. it seems ironic
that, once inside, we Wish we
could be solllelvhel'e else. In any
case, Miss Kirschner (through no
fault 01 her own) was not here
then, and cannot but fail to per-
curve the Irony of the general 5
uation or retlcct upon the impli-
cations it otters as to the general
nature of mail. So to be fair to
her, 1 must limit myself to come
menting on the obvious ﬂaws ot
her own reasoning.

To begin with, 1 not greatly up
set by the aspcrsions which have
been cast on the intentions oi lhs
archilect, Netsch Miss Kirschller
writes, ”This sounds like ii coallr
tion of administration and archir
lect against the student's need for
a certain degree ot privacy , .
Netsch is certainly no dolt when
it comes to college architecture.
After all, he has to his Credit Bur-
ling Library, and the Fine Arts
Center, not to mention the Air
Force Academy chapel and the
entire University of Illinms Chi-
cago Cimle campus. It Netsch has
designed the Forum as he has, it
is because he has certain concopr
tions as to what purposes and
goals ii small liberal arts college
such as Gl'inllell is aiming toward.
and a general scheme as to how
to help the college achieve these
ends, as much as possible, through
the mechanics of design. I serious-
ly doubt that he acted as a Bill'-
ling Basement. stooget

Secondly, l am alraid that the
cry ot “No privacyl" is one which
is t-oiecd by people who would not
be happy unless they were com-
plaining about something, and
that the rest of us have hardly
noticed the “defect" After all. do
you suppose the people ot the
TV room really care it they are
hoiiig watched by the people in
the North Lounge? Is it possible
that the even notice when they
are eng ed in the tuner And
does any no seriously believe
that the people in the North
Lounge mind being hatched by
the people in the TV room? Atter
till, don't people dance today be-
cause they want t’l) be seen? And
the people in the game room 7
do they care it the wallilowers
in the North Lounge are staring
at thcm twliile they are staring at

 

the en hall)? Is there anything
really so private going on in the
grill that the people in the game

who is more embarrassed — the

people entwined around each

other on the ﬂoor oi the South

Lounge each night at l .45, or the

people ogllng them from the CM-

t'ee shop and the music room?

Perhap ltliss Kil'schller has ittit‘
really amined both sides at the

question.

Miss Kirschncr writes of the
South Lounge, “ anyone who
talks above a whisper or so much
as plays an arpeggio is booed out
by the people who have taken
over the South Lounge as a study
center." Perhaps we should erect
a sign which states-

THIS LOUNGE
FOR AUDIBLE CONVERSATION
(15-75 DECIBELS)

AND ARPEGGIOS ONLY
But then wouldn’t we be defeating
the goal of ireedom in the liberal
arts community? Atter all, it the
South Lounge is tor quiet media
lation it is by the choice of the
students, and what is so wrong
with that? We have made it what
we want it to be.

or the grill, the authoress says,
“My idea or a place to relax and
meet my irlends is not a restallr
rant.” In reply, there is no law
which says you must stay in the
grill to talk; there is always the
TV room, the North Lounge, and
heaven tor d, the music room or
the Coffee :ihup.

In conclusion. it appears that
hliss Kirschner has lost sight or,
or denies, the real purpose oi the
Forum in the context of the col-
lege community. Of course the
Forum was not designed for pi-i.

markable amount of it in spite

as a place nhere people could hide
from each other. They can do that
in their rooms. The Forum has
designed as a meeting place. as
