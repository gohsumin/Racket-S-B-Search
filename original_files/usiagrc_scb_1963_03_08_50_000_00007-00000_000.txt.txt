No one gave Grinnell a ghost
of a chance. The Pioneer wres—
tlers hadn't had a winning sea»,

year was a respectable but not
outstanding sea, and last year
the team ﬁnished last in the,“

“Carletonlan” breezed, "In het—
test pursuit (of Cornell) will be

stated ﬂatly that “Carleton, Ripe,
on, Knox, and St, Olaf (will,
challenge) the rest oi the pack”
for second place. l

had happened, as it oflcn does:

place just ahead at Carleton.

in the aitcrniath Coach Tore
ry Moore admitted to mixed
emotions, saying, “I always
knew they had the ability and
the desire to win, but because
the team had been weakened
by injury and illness, and lie
cause we hadn’t had a good
season in seven or eight years,
I didn’t quite expect this,
Even when it was all over I
couldn’t quite believe it."

Moore suggested that another
factor Contributing to the team’s

success was a ncw emphasis on Furthermore,

If people tire confused nnw by the Various letter
. awards given to Grinnell athletes, they should give their
= sympathies to those who attended ‘the college prior to the
1930's. Before this decade, each sport had its 'own distin-
‘ guishing emblem, the theory being that with qualifications
being different, letters should be too.
At least five different styles of awards \vere.given
! by different squads. A square block G, a round G similar
' to the present. a lemon shaped character similar to the
Chic go U. elnbleln, an alrl English letter. and the most
famous, it Maltese cross with a block round G in the cen-
ter were all given at one time or ltnother.

The school Colors were another area of protest by the
,students. In 1891 a roar went up about having pink as the
icolleg‘e color. An item from the October 3, issue of the
‘Unit stated that: “pink is not a fit shade for suits, and in
many other ways is a failure as {1 college color.” The pr0<
ytest was taken care of quickly, for two weeks later on
’October 17, the Unit proudly announced "the wceli, natural
fading pinli selected zit hzipehtizztl'tl only it few years ago
‘ (h; ) given place here after to such strong, virile colors as
scarlet and black. , . . Let us one and till strive to make
Scarlet and Black mean in the west what Crimson and

By the turn of the century, Grinnell athletic teams
llllld both letters and colors, but still lacked a team name
‘by which they would be known. Again playing on the com-
petitive nntttre of students, a contest was held in 1919 to
determine :1 nick name. In the contest sponsored by the
Honor G committee. the name “Pioneers” was chosen to
designnle the squads from Grinnelll
