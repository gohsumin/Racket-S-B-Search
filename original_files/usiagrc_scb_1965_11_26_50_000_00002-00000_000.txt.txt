To the Editor:

The Student Senate three weeks
ago rejected by a vote of 14-7 8
groposal to give $15 to the Des
ioines Project. The primary ar-
Xument for not giving money was
that money allocated for social
purposes shouldn’t be used icr any-
thing other than social events. be-
cause of the Senate‘s record in
consistently voting money to the
National 5 t u d e n ts Association,
which certainly doesn’t provide
social opportunities for more than
one or two Gl‘innell students, Ind
the restrictive implications it has
for the jurisdiction ot the senate,

found this argument untenable.
Upon further discussion alter the
meeting, one senator indicated he
used this argument or social funds
only for social purposes merely as
. tront, and he opposed the prey:
eat for another reason. He didn't
think the project was being run
efficiently and involved expendi-
tures of money with few or no sub-
Itan '3], positive results. It is this
criticism of the structure and ei-
iectiverless of the Des Moines
project on which I focused nly ab
tention and traveled to Des Moines
in hopes of learning more about
the program.

I spent about four hours in Des
Moines with Billy King, who is on
ganiling the Des Moines Project.

uring this time we took pictures
of a house that had faulty wiring
and poor rooting. The occupant
was going on rent~5trike until the
house was repaired and wanted a
record of the complaints. We
Ipent the rest of the day visiting
people in the neighborhood. Many
of the people were Billy's friends

and the calls were little more than
social ones. But in the afternoon
we called on strangers, telling
them at the project and inviting
their participation.

The project was far enough
along so that meetings or neigh-
borhood people were held to dis-
cuss their mutual problems and
possible solutions. Discussion top-
ics ranged 1mm neighborhood rec-
reational sites they would like _to
start in order to keep their chil-
dren on the streets to regulations
on pets. 50 tar Billy has been the
main torce behind organizing and
directing these committee meet-
ings. He is presently trying to find
someone from the neighborhood
willing to assume chairmanship of
the committee. Hecause oi the
community’s historical iailure or
participation in the dcmopratic,
selfrgovernment process, this as-
sumption of the chair by one of
the community is very important.
it means that the committee and
neighborhood improvement can
continue well after Billy's depar-
tul'e.

On first glance the personal visi»
tations, the Saturday work projects
where Grinnell students do odd
jobs fixing houses, etc, and even
the neighborhood meetings may
appear insignificant and even mis-
directed in lighting poverty. But
there is a theory behind all these
activities, The theory is that of
community development, which is
used extensively by the Peace
Corps in fighting poverty abroad.

Essentially there are three stages

Budget Suffers from

To the Editor:

More and more these past years
we have been told how important
higher education is. Every medium
oi intormnticn is hill of sugges
tions to the federal government,
the states, the college themselves.
The individual is being told how
much 5 earning power is in
creased, in terms at dollars and
cents. (What a way of evaluating
education: in my way of thinking
it confuses education with job
training.) I tried to do it myself,
and i hit upon at least one snag
which could easily be avoided'

When my daughter was ready
for college, one at her tcachcrs
rccommended a small college as
excellent, and having just the right
courses of study. The yearly fee
(including entire lite on campus)
appeared rather high iur my bud-
get; but we decided that we should
be just about able to carry it.
Well . . ,

When it came to paying the first
year’s rec, there already was an
increase oi $110; the second year
the increase beyond our original
budget was $235; and for the ncxt
year it will be beyond the original

udget by $375. No doubt there
are good reasons tor the increases;
uniortunately, my budget is in no
way geared to that oi the college
And I am rolling hopelessly behind.
The same dilemma most assurcdly
hits hundreds at thousands of pec-
p_'e who try to solve thcir educa-
tlnual problems alone; and they all
can be spared the disappointment,
and possible unpleasant conse
bounces by some plain, practical
dunking (isn’t that the capacity
unich college is supposed to de
Vc'opY); for instance,

To Criticisims

To the Editor:
In reply to the letter from “a
parent" in last week's paper. 1
am amazed that any parent of a
Griuncll student would be so iii-
senaitive as to take exception to
the impressive issue of the 55:15
which discussed the problem oi
poverty in Grinncll, Des Moines
and Chicago. The stair of the sols
deserves commendation for this
issue, not criticism. and I hope
there will be continucd attention
to the problem. The only cominu
nlty relations endangered by a
coiiccin with poverty are the good
opinions pi those individuals who
believe along with the parent of
last week that povcrty strickenl
people are probably “content as.
they are" and that children find[
happiness in "messy barkyards."i
The 8&1} and the college can welll
alibi-d to sacriﬁce the good opin-
ion at such typos,

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

Recently I had an opportunity to inlelylew a lead-
ing oiilcial in one or the iederal government's many
investigative agencies. This particular agency and
(his particular ofﬁcial were concenled With Com-
munist inﬂuence in students protests

Alter his secretary had frisked me. I entered his
office. It was a large, hare, sterile kind of place with
little iumlture and lit only by the single lamp sitting
on the official’s desk. lle was sitting at the desk, his
feet propped upon it, his snap brim hat pushed back
on his head.

"I’m working on a new area of investigation," he
told me, after he turned up his radio, “I‘m looking
Into the sucalled ‘protest songs.‘ i think they clearly
show Communist inﬂuence."

1 caught mysell humming “We Shall Overcome"
and asked him if he had any particular examples
he'd like to talk about.

“Why, yes.” he said, as if he had been waiting
icr that question. “I heard one on my car radio just
today. 1 got in on the middle or it — don't know it’s
title or who does it yer — but l did jot down a tow
at the lyrics.

He pulled a crumpled envelope from his pocket
and began reading to me. n ‘To everything there is
a season and a time to every purpose under the

admitted it did sound familiar. “Yeah, it's familiar
Ill rlght — straight, hard, cold Communist Call to

Now if that isn't the Commie line l don't know it."

i was madly searching my mind ior where i had
heard Lhose lines before. "Get this,” he said. ’A
time to weep and a time to laugh / a time to get
and a time to lose, . .’ Sound like a Commie plan for
a commune?.. ‘a time to luve and a time In

i knew how what he was coming to and l shud-
dered with expectation.

think there's a great iuturc in investigating people
who sing songs like that," he said authoritatively.
“They're all hound (0 be Communists. And who
knows what the people who write them are.“

_ The Grudge Pot

James Blood busied himself with the antique ﬁn-
gemailriile. The handle ended with the golden bust of
Queen Victoria set on a ruby inlaid pedestal, distin-
guishing the tool as a Victorian masterpiece from the
Royal Shops. Blood paused and admired the beauty
of hls pared ringers.

He was careful, as he sat at a table of the popular
London pub, not to cross his legs, (or he knew it
made him look prissy. He was lully conscious of the
tact that a top—notch espionage agent must remain in-
conspicuous — neither proud nor plowed. lie awaited
quietly his drink and the moment that his signal
would call ircm anonymity the other agent, ISL-7.

The drink was his own invention v a James
Bloody Mary. Two jiggers of Walkers, one of any
canned tomato juice, and one of brlefly chilled v.3,
shaken till bruised. with a twist of lemon find.

when the waiter brought the drink, Blood stood
up and slapped it from his hand onto the Hear. “You
peasant," he cursed, “the lemon must be twisted
counter-clockwise!”

Blood did not care about the drlnk but hoped that
the spy hum SMOCK, who had been conspicuously
munching Frims at the bar, would mistake
“counter." as a signal to iorego the rendezvous, Ac-
tually, Blood’s use of his rigllt hand to knock the
drink had indicated that GL7 should walk east from
lhe London Bridge.

As Blood wandered along the leggy banks or the
Thames, he wondered what GL-7 would he like. He
hoped it would be a beautiful girl whom he could se-
duce before his next assignment, but they usually
were rather runty ex-army officers.

We should live in the bum and not the past.
That's the only way to get along. And even Ihuse
who live tor the moment are laggarts. They’re too
close to the dangerous brink at some yesterday.
They might slip over the edge and never take out
liie insurance or sign tor time payments on a car.

BeSldes, we’ve got to forget the past. As if it
never happened. As it that couldn't be the way it
was. It ought to be like some old and longtime gone

but ii you should be sitting by the telephone some
night, talking to someone you haven’t seen in miles,
with some passing remark it can all so quickly re-
uun _. garbled here and there, but still quietly
sinister in its lcrscns and logic.

Suddenly, he tripped over a bulky object and fell
to the ground. Undoubtedly, it was GL-7, he surmised
as be viewed the motionless heap, A large boot (hen
smashed his skull down onto the cobblestone pave-
ment.

"Harrington's Bootery" was lightly etched on the
bottom of the sole. A slight clue, ll he survived.

“Well, Mr. Blood,” said the voice above, husky
and tinged with a Slavic accent, “you should have
ﬁnished your drink." The enemy's harsh Cockle
seemed incongruous with the pretty London night,

James Blood always struck while they were
laughing. With a great short or his body. he hung
his feet upward at the other's temples, He grabbed
the lat calf and gave a hard twist. he snapped back
to the ground like a bow-string to its place and let
out a huge groan.

The sadistic spy laughed again. He laughed even
harder. When he thought oi the Englishman ruining
himself in his feeble attempt to escape, he wept for
joy. lie doubled over in lmcuntmlluble guffaws, Bass
roars alternated with soprano giggles.

James Blood stood up and brushed his dinner
jacket. The ioggy air bothered his sinuses, and he
had to suppress a sneeze. When the SMOCK agent
was completely prostrate with mirth, Blood pressed
the golden iingernaiHile reluctantly into the left
aurlcle. and the laughter slowly faded. Blood casu-
ally left the scene, knowing that the police would
record the event as a simple mugging in which both
the victim and the culprit were killed.

Now the fog began to lift with the dawn, and the
small bust of Queen Victoria looked silently nttmss
the (anions river which once had been hers.

There was, once upon ii time, a summer, in
Maine, perhaps, when the evenings were foolish
around zl piano, or drunken in a hall, down Ll wmtl-
ing gravel road inlo the damp country night, and lit
random through the trees.

It all comes back in confused sequence, but the
mood's Still there, the images of Goethe‘s wonder

behind.
