ly scheduled for 9:30, with the
majestic Gates-Rawson towers
serving as a psychedelic movie

Special Fruit Drink” will be
doled out shortly alter the flick

The SAGA Sleep-In will start
"anytime people reel the need,"
a SAGA spokesman said. The
whole ordeal may terminate
soon afterwards if the Iowa

that are expected.

(A) in its natural concern for
the well-being of its students,
the College has to make un-
equivocably Clear the legal
hazards of drug involvement.
Any person involved in the
possession, use, or distribution
of drugs, except through legiti-
mate drug channels, is poten-
tially subject to serious pen-
alties under federal, state.
and/or local laws; and any stu-
dent involved in illegal drug
use should be aware that at
any time a person or persons
either within or outside of the
campus community may be—
lieve they have such evidence
and thus report it directly or
indirectly to the Civil authoria
ties. It is neither the intention
nor the business at the College
to decide Whether evidence ol
drug use on campus is legally
actionable by civil authorities.
But if the civil authorities do
decide to make investigations.
the College is then in a position
where it cannot protect in-
volved students from the legal
consequences.

as saying. The Omar executive
told Frank that the firms pho—

The company had previously
agreed to do the printing, but

Senate Debates Prof Actions,
Criticizes Health Center

By HENRY SCHEFF

Last Tuesday’s Senate meet-
ing was characterized by long-
windedl debate and few deci-
sions, but several matters were
discussed.

Significant debate revolved
around the Organization Com-
millee’s proposal before the fac-
ulty to allow 10 students, prob-
ably elected at large, to attend
faculty meetings as voting mem-
bers. Senate debate indicated
that there was considerable op-
position to the Committee’s plan,
but a motion asking the Senate
to go on record against the mo-
tion was tabled.

Former SGA President Tom
Thomas asserted that 10 Stu-
dents would make a decisive
difference in only two or three
faculty votes a year, and that
implementation of the proposal
would be male tokenism.
Thomas also cited the difficulty
in finding 10 representative stu-
dents to attend faculty meet-
lugs.

Senator Andrew Loelvl said
that the proposal was side-
stepping a more important issue,
that Of the right of all students
to attend faculty meetings.

Senator William Stranger con-
jeetured that the proposal, it
passed, would weaken the pow-
er of the laculty vis-a-vis the
administration and the trustees.
Stranger asserted that close
votes in faculty meetings might
be Viewed as decisions deter—
mined by the in voting students,
and thus would not he given the
same weight as iacultydomi-
nated decisions. A Senate reso-
lution on the matter or student
participation at iaculty meet
ings will be discussed at next
week’s senate meeting.

In other actions, Senator An-
drew Brill expressed dissatisfae

tion with service at the Health
Center and a three-man com-
mittee was set up to investigat'
the situation and to talk to Mrs.
Irma M. Hall, Administrative
Supervisor of the Health Ser-
vice, the administration, and
other appropriate persons. Com-
mittee members are Senators
Brill, Stranger, and William
Thomas.

Student Coordinator Franlt‘
Thomas announced \ that the
position of Social (bordnator is
unoccupied, following the resig»
nation of senior Lee Shamberg.
Studentsrinterested in applying
tor the position should contact
Frank Thomas or SGA President
James Lew.

In other Senate activity,
Brill outlined the policy for
this year‘s initiative fund.
Because individual residence
halls received smaller allot<
merits than in the past, the ini-
tiative funds will he more avail-
able for hall social events this
year. Brill said that while in
previous years some 65 per
cent of the amount of
money requested was allotted,
this year the initiative Fund
Committee will try to allot 85
