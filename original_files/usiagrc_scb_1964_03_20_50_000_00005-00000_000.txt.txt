IRC Gathering. Seminar on Order
Share Political Scientist Friedrich

By Ann Showalter

The Order-Chaos lecture se-
ties and the International Re-
lations Club
both benefited
irom the visit
Carl Jr Frieda
rich (political
s c i e n c e) of
Harvard and
the University
of Heidelberg.

Lecturing on
“The Dialectic
of Order and
F re a d o m in
Politics" Fri- FRIEBRIC"
day evening in Herrick Chapel,
Friedrich diSCussed the free-
dom of individuals and nations
in relations to the political or-
der.

“Man wants a free order and
he wants an ordered freedom:
therefore, he must accept dis-
order and unfreedom to a cer-
tain extent," he stated, .

He stressed the “continual
dialogue' going on between the
terms “order’ and “freedom."
The conflicts implicit in these
two words are of the essence
of politics in a democracy.

Whether more freedom or
more order will occur in a
given situation depends on the
individuals involved and the
circumstances, but in general,
Friedrich b e l i e V e s, ”The
stronger the man, the more
yalue freedom; the weaker the
man, the more Value orderf”

Since different people re-
quire different amounts of
freedom, one of the problems
in the ordering of a commun-
ity is “to provide the minimum
of freedom for those who want
only a minimum and at the
same time to allow those who
want more freedom to have
it.”

Friedrich cited professors
and students as examples of
people who might require more
freedom than is sometimes af-
fordecl by the political order.

People seek three different
types of freedom. The first is
freedom of independence or
lack of governmental interfer-
ence, The founders of America
were seeking this type of free-
dom. The desire for the second
type of‘freedom, freedom to
participate in one’s govern
ment, has become apparent in
the fight for civil liberties

“Freedom of 'creafion has
become important in recent
years,” said Friedrich. People
desiring this type of freedom
are not trying to keepithe gov»
ernment out of their affairs or
trying to participate in governs
ing themselves; they want the
government to help them in
selfedevelopment through an
Order that Will provide for eds
ucation, employment and
peace.

Since political order must
provide for so many types of
freedom," “Any dynamic or-
der is characterized by emerg-
ing disorder.”

The freedom of a nation may
conflict with the freedom of
the indi duals within it. Thus,
newly independent countries
are sometimes criticized for

 

suspending individual free<

doms.

The mother country may say
the people were freer under
her domuu‘on, The new nation,
however, replies that estab-
lished countries often suspend
individual rights in times of
crises and by this principle the
recently freed nation may with-
draw rights. »

A country thus has the free-
dom to order its Own affairs
even if by doing so it limits
the freedom of the people with.
in it.

In his IECture to the lRC Con-
ference Saturday morning on
“National Interests and World
Government.” Fredrich ex-
plained that ”national inter-
est” is defined differently by
three different groups.

The political technicians in
the State Department conceive
of national interest as main-
taining the position of the Unita
ed States in the World.

The various. specialeinterest
groups representing large or»
ganizations think national in-
terest coincides with their par-
ticular points of View. “For-
eign policy on many issues
emerges as a compromise co-
determined by the various
special-interest groups and the
technicians in the State De,
partment."

The third group the general
public, rarely comes into oper-
ation in formulating foreign
policy, but when it does, as
in the Cuban crisis. its effects
can be devastating.

”Though the public believes
national interest to be in pre-
serving peace and freedom, it
has often stepped in to demand
warlike action," Friedrich stat-
ed.

Taking into account all these
conceptions of national inter-
est, Friedrich considered the
United Nations and regional
groups of nations in relation to
world government. He believes
the UN, European reunification
and the Organization of Ameri-
can States have generally been
advantageous to the United
States.

"If the UN is a precursor to
world government, it is much
closer to the American ideal of
federation than to the Commu-
nist dream of world domina-
tion." He thinks reorganization

of tile UN would go against Us; operates with nations as its

national interests because “the
push for reorganization comes
from countries with ideologies
different from ours."

“Our only hope for world or-
der is likely to come in terms
of about a dozen homogeneous

 

SCARLET AND BLACK

Main Foyer Hosts
Senior Ari Exhiliit
0f Various Works

The new exhibit gracing the
walls of Main foyer is the work
of Grinnell's own talent: the
senior art majors. it is hoped
the Senior Art Exhibit will be-
come an annual activity of the
art department, analogous to
the senior recital given by niu-
sic majors.

Each senior art student
chooses several examples from
his class or independent work
of the last few years, and from
these were selected the pieces
which make up the exhibit.

The works represent almost
all the media and techniques
available to the art student
through the art department:
oils, water colors, prints, ce-
ramics, and silver. There is an
equal variety of styles, and
diverse subjects, ranging from
“Weed" to “Madgalene.” The
most unusual title belongs to a
painting by Judy A. Johnson,
“That which I should have
done I did." The ceramics and
jewelry are the work of Carl
Rattnerf

The art majors are gaining
practical experience by setting
up the exhibit themselves, un-
der the supervision of Mn and
Mrs. Louis Zirkle, art instructa
ors. They matted, framed and
labeled their own pictures,
then arranged them according
to color, style, and medium,
to the advantage of the room,
the lighting and each otherf
They used colored strips of
burlap to unify and organize
the display.

The purpose of the exhibit.
on display from March 7-29, is
to spotlight the work of senior
art majors. This exhibit is one
of ﬂiree ways in which student
work is presented to the stu-
dent public during the year.
The student exhibit, scheduled
for April. 30-May 18, in Scllaef—
fer Gallery, provides an oppor-
tunity for any student to dis-
play his art work, and the stu-
dent sale is held later in the
spring for all students who
wish to sell their work.

cultural entities." He named
India, China, Africa, Europe,
Arabia, Latin America, Great
Britain, the US and USSR as
logical groupings, "rather than
all the ones we have now."
Since international law still

primary grouping and since
the democratic and totalitar-
ian conception of law differs
SO radically, Friedrich feels
that any attempt at world gov-
ernmeiit would do best to play
down law.

Bishop Depicts Pascal's Genius
For Phi Beie Chapel Lecture

The description of a “vivida

and unmistakable phenomenon

of genius“ was

presented at

l a s t Friday‘s

Phi Beta Kap-

pa chapel lec-

t u r e. Morris

Bishop, 1) o e t,

b io g r a pher,

and humorist,

spoke to the 24

new initiates of

the honor soci»

ety and other

“SHOP students and

faculty. He described Blaise

Pascal, the subject of his lec-

ture as the most “authentic
case of genius."

Bishop described Pascal‘s
boyhood and education care-
fully, calling his life a ”pathet-
ic picture of a great mind try-
ing to destroy itself.” He por-
trayed a boy and man with a
restless and unquiet mind that
could never be satisfied With
what others were satisfied
with. . ,"

‘;The quest for certitude”
was the driving force of Pas-
cal’s life, according to Bishopf
The contradictions in this and
in his goal to prove Christian
faith by the power of reason—
are reflected in Pascal’s work,
the Pensees. A scientific and
mathematical prodigy, he is
quoted as saying, “Our only
true science is comprehension
of God's will and obedience to
if.” He also stated that “Faith
is God felt in the heart, not
in the reason."

Given to mysticism, Pascal
included the statement, “I know
the one in whom I have be-
lieved,” on his official seal.
Bishop characterized him as a
man who "tried force of will
to achieve saint-hood. He tried
to abandon man. , , . he could
never escape from his mind,
from that old demon thought"

In conclusion Bishop printed
out the role Pascal‘s upbring-
ing played in his genius He
pointed out that the “informal”
education Pascal received de-
veloped his reason and judg~
ment and encouraged original-
ity. Yet he lacked the sense of

discipline and conformity which
a formal education brings.
“Schools prepare us for liv-
ing in the world," he Said. flu
immediately pointed out, how-
ever, that “group adjustment
will destroy a genius' he must
learn group rejection. . . .
Genius, like all creativity, must
be paid for.” Listing peace of
mind, happiness, comfort, ad
solidarity as the things lost,
Bishop concluded that “the
genius has no choice."
