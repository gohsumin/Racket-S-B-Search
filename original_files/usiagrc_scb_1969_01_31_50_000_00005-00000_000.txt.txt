SEX with Kirkendall

As a part of the current sex education
program, Dr. Lester A. Kirkendall, re-
tired prolessor oi Family Diving at Dre-
gon State University visited the campus
last week. He is a recognized authority
on sex education, and has written exten-
sively, including the hook Premarital In-
tercourse and Interpersonal Relations. In
his lecture, Dr. Klrkendali did not ac-
knowledge his position as a moralistic
one because he refused to designate spe-
ciﬁc acts as either right or wrong. To
so focus upon speciﬁc actions would di-
vert attention from what he considered
the basically important issue, namely,
the meaning of behavior, motivations,
and the significance which these have
for us as human beings. In this sense
sexual behavior is not taken out of its
everyday context; it Cannot and should
not be divorced from the world we live
in. T00 oiten students are handed a pack-
age, In this instance, sex, and then told
to fit it Into their lives any way they can.

Certain limihations are evident in any
lecture. The most obvious is that the
speaker does not reach everyone in the
audience. Perhaps the real value in such
a lecture is the discussions it has prompt-
ed on campus. Here, I believe, lies the
value in having people like Dr. Kirken-
dall visit Grinnell. His lecture has opened
up a whole area of what students want
no talk about; the quanion now remains,
“Are students going up continue to open
that door?"

This student body is capable of the
most pejorative of criticism and yet
regardless of where they place the ob-
ject at issue on Lhe scale or their likes
and dislikes the important point lies in
answering the question, "Where do we
go imm here?“ To talk about an issue,
maybe develop it a little, and then
shelve it when it becomes last week’s
discussion topic is missing the point. And
I believe a lot oi points have been missed
on this campus.

A month in Washington DC. A night-
mare of machine politics, jowlish con-
gressmen, and Pigs in the Street vanish
at the visions of the glowing Capitol
dome, the Lincoln Memorial, and Tas-
ro's Restaurant and Bar (17th and P St.

N.W.). One becomes inspired, even in-
ebriated by the glory that is Our Na-
tion's Capital.

Little did I realize, however, that
Grinnell College, community of which
i am a member, plays such a large
role in this, our iederal government.

One day I wandered through an oilice
building on Pennsylvania Avenue, as l
am wont to do, past ofﬁces of lobbyists
— the Teamsters, the Remember the
Pueblo Committee, the Forget the Pue-
hlo Committee, when what to my won-
dering eyes should appear, but a ma-
hogany door with a bronze plaque which
stated, “Grinnell Associates, Grinnell,
Iowa." Maybe, I thought, they can't
spell ‘College.’ I could think of no rea-
son why Collegium Grinnelli would have
a Washington attire, but the Wayne
Feeds has even less reason for a lob-
byist.

I entered cautiously, trying to expel

fears of T.H.R.U.S.I-I, Dr. No, and secret
CIA subsidies. The receptionist was not
in the room, and I permitted myseli a
generous look at the ofﬁce. The desk
was clear or any papers that could offer
a clue to what Grlnnell Associates real-
ly was or were. In one comer there
stood a filing cabinet, and on the top
drawer the coded initials "RE.” were
pencilled. Poweshiek Eradications? Pa-
gliai Epidemics?

The secretary interrupted my musings
when she entered and asked if She could
help me, I did not know exactly what to

say, so, of course, I asked her it she
was irom Grlnnell, lowa.

“More or less," she replied.

:Do you, uh, know, uh, Floyd Beav-
er."

“Who? Oh, you mean the mayor? No,
I just went to the college there — Grin-
nell College." Just what I needed.

"Well, that's why I stopped here. I’m
a student at Grinnell, and I was just
passing by and saw the sign on the
door. . . Is this an oiﬁce oi the college?"

“Uh, not officially, er, I mean . d .
Wait just a moment, please.”

She walked back to the door through
which she had just entered and leit
tor a tow seconds. She came back smil-
ing and said conﬁdently, “Would you
like to meet the boss?” Without waiting
for an answer, she showed me to the
door and closed it behind me.

There he was. The familiar face
smiled at me from beneath the four
lamiliar rig leaves, this time in bronze.
on the wall to the right were several
autographed photographs nl congress-
men, and to the left, an architect's con-
ception oi the proposed physical educa-
lion complex. We exchanged the usual
pleasanlries, you know, T. S. Eliot: and
all that. Then I took a closer look at the
picture which had become so iamiliar
to me on the Cowles placemats. At the
lower right hand corner were the words,
“Thomas J. Dodd Athletic Center."

Before I had time to recover (mm the
shock oi this discovery, the secretary
entered and said to the boss, “Your
visitor is here, Sir." I left politely, but as
l hurried out through the receptionist’s
Office I heard her say, “You may Come
in now. I'm sure the President will
greatly appreciate your donation, Mr.
Agnew."

DRAFT NOTES

school part lime and work part time,
you may be able to obtain an occu-
pational deferment.)

As predicted, monthly drait quotas
have jumped back to precampaign
levels. The day alter the national elec<
tion, it was announced that during Jan-
uary, 1959, a total or 26,800 conscripts
would be inducted.

On November 21, a “New York
Times” article indicated that the numd
bar or draltees with college degrees has
risen from under 5% to 15%, since the
summation of most deferments {or
graduate students. The situation for stu-
dents may well get a good deal rougher
in the spring. Selective Service oliicialr
predicted that students would make up
as much as 90% of the draft callrupa
in many states. The defense department
said 63% of the total 240,000 predicted
for 196869 would be students. so [at [his

tics. Under present draft regulations;
the oldest males are iirst to go, and
grad students newly classified l—A ard
perfect targets.

In October, General Hershey sug-
gested to state Selective Service direc
tors that local boards postpone the in»
duction orders oi graduate students un-
til the end of the term during which thl
order is received.

Congress and nrait Laws — Senator
Philip A. Hart (D-Mich.). in a speech
to [he fall session of the Yale University
Political Union, has dismissed the idea
or a volunteer army as “practically un-
workable” and urged instead the adop-
tion of national service as an altema-
tive to military service. Hart proposed
a system in which draft Iegistrants
would be given three choices: volunteer-
ing tor three years of national service
in such organizations as the Peace
Corps or VISTA, or, entering a "primo
selection group" irom which one could
be draited-as-needed for a 21/2 year term
or service. Those entering the prime se-
lection group would remain in the group
for one year and would be subject to
call based upon a lottery system. Capi-
tol Hill sources report that a maiur draft
reform bill will be introduced in the 915:
Congress by Hart and other senators.
