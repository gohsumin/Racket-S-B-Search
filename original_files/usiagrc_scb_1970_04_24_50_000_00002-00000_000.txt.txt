Environmental Teach-[n

This week marks the beginning of the First Na-
tional Environmental Teach—In. All over the country
students, teachers, scientists, politicians, and just
plain citizens are gathering at economic, social, and
academic institutions to focus their attention and the
attention of their nation on the problems presented
by the ecological crisis. There is hope that this
week’s events will be the beginning of a popular
movement that will express in deeds and not merely
words a concern for the safety of our environment.

If this happens, it will not be the first such move-
ment. Among other organizations, the Sierra Club
has for years been actively working on a limited
scale for the preservation of the purity of our wil-
derness areas. The masterful and sensitive photo-
graphs of Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter as pub-
lished in the Sierra Club’s books have convinced
many of the need for active concern in these mat-
ters.

These are days, however, when even such pre-
serves as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area are
threatened by encroaching industry. Pollution of
our environment has, in urban, rural, and wilder-
ness areas, reached a level at which it cannot be
ignored. We are awakening to the need for action
at an alarm which we can only hope did not come
too late. We are no longer willing for our environ-
ment “to be handed over to ceaseless, unthinking
development by those who think only of what it
could yield to them today,” in the words of Garrett
De Bell.

Everyone admits that it is “ceaseless, unthinking
development” that has got us into this situation, but
we disagree as to whatito do about it. Suggestions
for action range on all sides from the active and
rational concern of the conservation organizations to
the rash, if sincere, actions of students who con~
scientiously collect tin cans from the roadsides to
empty on the floors of soft drink and beer distribut-
ors. We suggest that this is a time when, more than

at any other, reason is needed, lest we move from
“ceaseless, unthinking development” to ceaseless,
unthinking activity.

Man, the only rational animal, has often acted
before thinking. If we work together to reverse this
trend, we can more effectively work together to
change our treatment of the environment.

Sometime during the previous

received a questionnaire and

the political attitudes of Gl‘innell
College Students.

We have received some
feedback both favorable and
unfavorable. I will concern
myscli with what appears to be
llle most unfavorable criticism of
the questionnaire, that is the
supplying of names of your iellow

To the Editors:

To take on John Nigel Pepper,
cspeciallywvhen he can muster
such reserve forces as the
movie Highschocl and Alan NasV
ser in support of his proposal to
scrap lhe Physical Education
requirement, is a lush at WillCll
even i inighi quail, sull, as me
man who preserved the SWimr
ming requirement the last lime

pie

it was debated at [acuity meet
ing a for which I received the
John Pfitsch Award for Prue
gymnastic Excellence—l guess
it devolves on me to speak up
in behalf of the “body hall" of
the “mind-licdy problem."

Mr. Pepper questions whether
the President and the Deans
are competent to decide on the
value of physical education 7
and this at a time when the
faculty is engaged in turning
over its control of the curri-
culum to the students! If pllySlr
cal ﬁtness be a bad thing, then
the charge of making its bad-
ness requisite must be laid on
the faculty tcc. Let us give dis-
credit where discredit is due.

The faculty and the adminis-
tration have preserved, in the
P.E. requirement, the last ves-
tige of a tradiliun that goes back
beyond Flam, even unto Homer:
that man be a speaker of words
and a doer of deeds. My chjec-
lion to lhe P.E. requirement at
Grinnell lies precisely in die
fact that it is vestigial. What we
need is not less but more RE,
In the present lermcnl aver re-
ViSlng the curriculum, I would
move that we raise the require
mom to 62 of the 124 hours re-
quisile ior graduation, {or only
thus can we achieve the juvenal
ideal oi mans sand in corpora
sano. If the students around
here were tuckered out from
62 hours worth of P.E., we
would see a quick and to the
kind of malevolent high jinks
which we suller in contem-
porary surrogates for Spring
Riots e.g., vandalism in sup-
port or unions. To gain physi-
cal lilness and get rid oi moral
evil in one motion is all econ-
omy worthy of Divine Provir
deuce. Under Gl‘innell's pres-
ent system, we have inverted
the Homeric ideal, and our
