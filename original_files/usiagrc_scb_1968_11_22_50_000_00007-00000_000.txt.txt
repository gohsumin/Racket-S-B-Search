‘AN OPEN LETTER TO
THE COOKS IN COWLES
KITCHEN:

SUBJECT: Your latest cull-
nary abortion.

GENTLEMEN: Although I
have eaten your cooking for
three years, I was astounded
by the poor quality or the
spaghetti-and-cheese concoction
served to the male student
body last Wednesday noon.
.You are to be congratulated on
your clever use or grease.

Also, since my spoontul of
spaghetti (about ﬁve inches
wide) was burned on one side
and tuicooked on the other, I
am convinced that you have
accomplished a rare teat in the
practice of thermodynamics.

I know most of you by your
ﬁrst names, but it is possible
that there is a leprechaun in
your kitchen. Please look into
this at your earliest opportunity.

Non-Machiavellian
“Prince" In Arena

A workshop production of An-
mine de Saint Exupery’s “The
Little Prince" will be presented
in Arena Theatre Sunday
through Wednesday.

Elizabeth Panwitt, ‘69, is di.
recting the play from her own
original script. Original music
lor the play has been composed
by Frederick s. Kuethe, ’69, ii
music major.

No advance tickets are neces-
sary for seating.

A iacet oi the Theatre De-
partment that rarely gets a

measure of its deserved alien-
tion is the modern dance sec
tion. Mrs. Betty Voertmall con-
ducts weekly modern dance
workshop, which may be used
by any student as a part of the
physical education requirement,
and oi-chcsis, the perlorming
dance group which practices
twice a week and presents a
concert once a year.

The workshops are not related
to Orchesls. That is, a student
taklllg a workshop is not re-
quired to pertorin in the con-
cert Ior credit. although he or
she may be invited to do so.
There are two workshops open
to all students each semester:
one tor beginning dancers, and
one ior those who have already
had a semester.

Orchesis (which comes trom
a Greek word meaning, “place
tor the chorus ot dancers") Is
the traditional college dance
group's name. Grinnell’s Orche-
sie has 24 members: 16 Women,
8 men. Membership in the group
is gained through an audition
which includes exercises in tech-
nique and In improvisation.
The members of Orchesis judge
the applicants. Experience in
modern dance is not absolutely
necessary, Those who have had
enough experience in various
areas to develop a love tor
dance and a tree imagination
are looked for. Creativity rather
than proliciency in perionn-
ance is encouraged. Although
students generally come with
some kind of ballet or modern
dance training, the emphasis is
on giving the students a chance
to explore movement and their
own ideas. For this Nissan I
good portion of time is spent
