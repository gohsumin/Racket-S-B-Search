1 While playwrights have dealt
i'with historical and social
[homes since the time ol Aes-
ihylus, Mrt Meyer noted a par
ticular contemporary revival 01
this concern “There is no ques~
lion mat people like Tuchman
are writing almost in the style
of theater," while many current
dramatists follow the lead of
Beriolt Brecht, whose work is
conceived as “an artistic his-
tory of man . . . parables ul
history, with a lesson." More

recen: productions have in-
cluded Rolf Hockhuth's The
Deputy. a documentary play by
Peter Weiss centered on the
Nuremberg Trials, and a work
perlormed in London concert)-
lng the assassination of Presls
dent Kennedy.

War Without End unites re-
corded events and perspectives
with B poetic narrative which
seeks to portray the horror and
purposeless sufiering or World
War It The play is a fusion of
the tragic and the absurd: “We
have produced the play in an
extremely nonreal style which
we hope will reinforce the ng<
tesquerless, stupidity, and to-
tility oi the wart"

“if Grinnell ls unwilling to
grapple boldly and positively
with the problems oi social
change, I wonder about its
institutional guts in the more
vital areas of educational re-

rewriting tho college catalog
to conform to “reality at Grin—
nell,” Kent commented: "I love

the college catalog. It's the
main reason I came here. I
think radier man revise the
catalog we should revise the
colleges”

“I'm no particular advocate
oi student power. Still, if stu-
dents are the only people Will-
ing to take initiative, then they
probably should have power.
Grinnell has to get moving It
a push irom tho studenn is
what is needed, so be it. i have
no regrets.”

CanP President Bnh Foote
stressed his canoem with
“making the student voice rel-
evant" as a segment oi the
college community. He men-
tioned counseling as one area
in which student concern
seems to have provnked ad-
ministrative reevaluation and
expressed hope that revision

would be forthcoming.

Bond Faulwell. speaker of the
Senate, noted that he expected
a resolution supporting the stu-
dent government protest to be
passed at the next regular
meeting. the last of this semes-

would seek clarification of the
administration's action in m-
gards to the recent visitation

camber-January Political Book-
loe-Month, C. Edwin Gil-
mour, PPPE Director an-
nounced last week.

In their central observation of
the volume, Novak and Evans
conclude that Johnson’s place
in history will be determined,
not by his legislative triumphs.
his parliamentary and political
feats, nor his Great Society pro-
grams, but by the outcome of
the Viet Nam War. Viet Nam,
thsy assert, is “the malignant
cancer at the Great Society t . .
a bloody, insoluble dilemma
that does not lend itself to the
brilliant weapons or power de-
veloped by Lyndon Johnson dun
lug his thirtyvlive years in poll-
tics."
