Republican Supports Two Party System
In Telephone Talk to Grinnell Students

ny Glen Ashmon

Every light in the normally
dim South Lounge was ablaze.
Microphones were scattered
around the upper level. and
giant speakers peered down at
the slowly gathering crowd.
The stage was set, the per-
former ready. It was 9 pm.
last Monday. The crowd
hushed. Only the spinning oi
tapes and the beeps of elec-
tronic machines defied Dhe si-
lance.

Then a lone human voice
penetrated through space and
imagination. Senator Jacob
Javits and the Young Republi-
cans had introduced a new con—
Cept in communication to Grin-
nell and Iowa —- the telephonic
lecture.

The Republican Senator from
New York told the Grinnell
audience, “Preservation of the
twosparty system requires that
people have a real alterna-
tive."

He continued that the 1964
brand of conservatism is not
an acceptable choice. Warning
that it is not enough to be dif-
ferent for the sake of being difr
Ierent, Javits called {or a pro-
gram which would be ”differ
ent in line with the national in-
terest.”

Javits recognized reunificar
tion and the rebuilding of the
party image as the immediate

 

problems which Republicans
must tackle. Cautionihg liber~
als against taking satisfaction
in saying. ”I told you so." he
nevertheless agreed that the
1964 election was a tragedy for
the Republicans.

He pointed out that Republi-
cans held their own at the gubr
ernatorial level only because
problems there were essential-
ly local. In Javits’ opinion. the
big question which confronts
the party is. “Can we compete
electorally With Democrats?"

Javits pointed to several
ways to compete with Demo—
crats including recruiting of
young people, mobilizing pub
lic support, and offering an al-
ternative both to President
Johnson's “government first"
approach and also to the “no-
government” approach in refs
erence 10 conservatism.
