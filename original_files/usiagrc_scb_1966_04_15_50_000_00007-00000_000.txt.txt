Berkeley Faculty Committee Advis s
Institution of Freshman Seminars

Three weeks ago a Berkeley
facility committee released a two
hundred page report suggesting
possible changes to improve the
quality of education at that uni-
versity. Tile “Muscatine” report
represents a positive response to
3 need tor change which was so
well demonstrated in the riots of
last year. A few or the forty»two
recommendations of the report in-
cluded:

The institution of ireshman sem-
inars to consist of no more than
twelve students and one faculty
member who would work without
restriction as to subject matter
“as long as the orientation is one
of dialogue and in the spirit of
tree inquiry.”

The institution oi Id hoe courses:
courses which might arise “to sup-
ply the relevant scholarly and in-
tellectunl background to subjects
of active student concern." (e.g.,
“Viet Nam." and “Literary Cen-
sorship").

The proposals that recommenda»
tions for tenure be accompanied
by a formal dossier on the candi-
date’s teaching performance.

Thus the seniors at the Univer-
sity of Rochester have circulated
a protest petition within their
class objecting to the placing of a
“seal of approval” on his ideas
conceniing academic freedom,

(in October 25, 1965, Nixon, in
a speech in New Jersey demand-
ed that Rutgers University of New
Jersey dismiss Professor Gencvese
for giving his personal viewpoints

in. Genovese is reported to have
said that he would welcome a Viet
Cong victory in Viet Nam.

When Drew University did not
renew the contract at one of their
professors who participated in the
teach-in, because of “academic
reasons," Nixon stated that he ad-
mired the subtlety of the Drew
officials, thus giving support to the
idea of using academic pressure

 

to suppress political opinion.

"If I were governor I would not
sit on the sidelines, but i would
remind the Board of Governors of
their responsibility to put the secur-
ity of the nation above the right
of the individual." Nixon said the
same day in supporting the Re—
publican candidate for the New
Jersey govemorship.

The Rochester seniors are not
opposed to the appearance of Nix~
on campus in some other capacity.

deny any political motive in their

Faniasiick Fairy Tale
Produced for Arena

Thursday night at a pm. the
musical The Fantasticks goes on
stage in arena theater. Directed
as an independent project by Deb-
orah Hui-listine, the show com-
bines free verse dialogue and
songs in an adaptation of the
French stoxy The Romantics

The Fantasllcks begins with a
fairy tale act in which boy (Mun
ray Nelson) meets girl (Stephanie
Lewis), and subsequently they fall
in love and marry. Their fathers
(Milt Tootle and Tom Pope) have
successfully rigged the romance,
including a feud to further the love
atlair. To bring about a reconcil-
iation between the “feuding” fa-
thers. a staged abduction is
planned. El Gallo, narrator ot the
musical (Ric MacDowell) is hired
to effect a phony rape.

At the beginning of the second
act the characters are restless and
quarrelsome. As El Gallo presents
the bill for the rape, the mas-
querade is exposed. the lovers
part and the fathers lapse into a
real lend, Significantly enough,
the wall is torn down before it
is erected again. Enter the hero,
as the boy retums from his world-
ly adventures to find the girl has
been deceived by El Gallo. Enter
the theme, as the boy and girl
fail in love again, this time know»
ing what it is to be hurt, and thus
lrncwing better what love means.

Meanwhile, back at the wall, the
fathers have found a common
bond in their mutual affection for
vegetables — because they’re so
predictable, so dependable, unlike
children. They suggest tear-
ing down the wall. but El Gallo
intervenes and insists lhat the wall
must stay and can never be torn
down.

Characters and others instru»
menial to the production include

 

Keith King, musical director;
Anne Hoganson and Janet Hamil-
ton, pianists; Max l-leligott, sec-
ond actor; Ruthie Sternberg,
who portrays various props. Must
cal numbers in the Show include
“Try to Remember." “Much
More,” and “Soon It‘s Gorilla
Rain,”

Previous workshops have been
financed by drama department
funds; however, Miss Burnstine
is breaking precedent by receiv-
ing financial support from SGA.
Miss Bunlstine also broke prece—
dent last year when her produc~
tion of The American Dream
went on the road and was the
first Grinnell play to do so in five
years. The American Dream helped
pave the way for the performance
of The Bourgeoisie at Cornell this
year.

According to Katz there have
been no abrupt changes in the
academic attitude of the student
body during the eight years he
has taught here. He described the
students as proving “fairly homo-
geneolls.”

Kafz loolrs forward to two spe-
clal challenges in his new posi-
tinn. He will he working with a
diiieient type or student body,
since it is an urban community
and most students will be com-
muters.

“1 will be working with the stu-
dent that couldn't go away to
school," stated Kati, “And of
course, part of the excitement and
challenge is going lo those Bos~
wnian libraries!"

College ‘Spiril' Would Shock J. 3.;
Evolves lo Unforeseen Extremes

By ANNE FARRER

There are several approaches
that may be taken when consid-
ering Grinnell. There is the per-
spective's “aren't’the squir-
rels neat, what do you do during
open dorms anyway?“ approach.
There's the hang a lantern in
Goodnow tower, the trustees are
coming approach. And there's the
historical approach, for whatever
Grinnell is, it is the oldest one
of it west of the Mississippi.

Although one now receives the
impression that Giinnell s p r a n 3
fully armed and con-ivfed from the
brow of I. B. Grinnell, it was by
process that Grinnell arrived at its
present state. An example and in-
tegral part oi this process is the
evolution of the present status of
liquor at Grinnell.

In the beginning I. B. Grinnell
created the college and liquor was
immediately placed at a disad-
vantage; lor the original plan
was as iollows: a board was chos~
all and it was provided that the
net proceeds from the lots in the
northwest quarter oi Section is be
given to Grinnell University, “with
the express provision that the lots
should revert to Mr. Grinnell ii
ardent spirits for a beverage
should ever be sold thereon with-
out his consent or that of his legal
representatives.”

Later this stipulation was elr
iecilvely removed by court action,

or the decisions made by depart—
ing faculty, though higherrsalaried
positions were usually accepted,

it was generally felt that at
Grinneli, tenure, a traditional prob.
blcrn in some colleges and uni-
versities, was not an issue at all.
Most proiessors produce enough
material at G inoell to gain na»
ticnal recognition and this was
cited as one of the big factors
in the drawing away of faculty
members; several department
heads said that the places where
the prolessors were going or had
gone should be used as an index
of the desirability of the faculty
and that the departure should not
be counted as a total loss iﬂl' the
college but as a gain in the pres-
tige oi the iaclllly.

The major lactor m llle depatv
z - oi any proiesscr. was clas-
5 ed as one of market. Most oi
the people interviewed empha-
sized tlie lacl that opportunities
in education were increasing at
such a rate that the availability
of a position, especially tor a pro-
lessor coming irom Grinnell, was
almost limitless. The mat et. in
other words, is a seller’s market.
James Kissane (English) noted
that the departments that were in
the best shape were the ones to
lose the best men. He cited Pro-
iessors Fox, Springer, Cole, and
Westiail in previous years. He
went on to say that not many
people leave without an offer.

Joseph Wall (history) said that
stair members usually leave be-
cause of oppoi-runiiies for special-
ization and more time for research
and publication, He said that this
was particularly true at the his-
tol'y department.

One of the largest reasons cited
ior the fact that more proiessors
did not leave was that the college

 

 

but the intent was carried on in
November. 1904, with the estab~
lishment of a local chapter of the
American Prohibition C ollegﬂ
League. In true Grinnell fashion,
the chapter was to attack the so-
cial menace or alcohol by “but.
lining courses of study on variouii
lines dealing with the liquoi
problem and to produce as a re-
sult of study theses and oralions
which shall help the cause of pro
hibition."

The machinery of Grinnell ran
smoothly, though with somewhat oi
a lack of lubrication, until Decem-
ber, 1931, when the council oi
house chairmen began an investi-
gation of the use of liquor on cam-
pus. This el ited a traditional
S lo 3 editorial:

The. scarlet and Black. des-
pite opposition, is today pub-
lishing a story on the liquor in<
vestigaiion now in progress here.
Thls is curried because the his
vesiigation ls news, and action
taken either by studem governing
organizations or by the admin-
lstrative committee is of vital

inlerest to the student body.

Whispered rumors Is to meet-
ings and summons may IS well
be made public it they are true.
Grinnell does not countenanco
drinking by students here, and
letting both the students and
public know that such is the
case can do no harm.

As a result of the investigation
eight Clark men were placed on
social probation, which in 1931
was no dating, day or night, until
the end of the year. Tome of
these Clark men were subject to
dismissal at the end of the year
(it they reacted in true, red»blooded
Grinnell spirit, they probably left
right then).

The Climax in Grinnell's his
cholic history came in 1964 when
at the instigation of SGA. liquor
was legalized on campus tor stu-
dents over 21.

At present, the college is strug-
gling with the rather nebuloul
“North Campus Problem" and in
regard to this, one can best ad-
monish: God grant me the serenity
lo accept the things l can’t change,
the courage to change the things
I can, and the wisdom to liniJW
the difference (the Alcholics Anon-
ymctls prayer).

tiles, in large measure, to meet
the competition in salary and pi)-
sitlon offered by other instliulious.
According to Kissane, the college,
in several Crucial instances, has
done a great deal to keep people
here."

As lat as the specific depart-
ments are concerned, all of llia
professors interviewed ielt that
their departments are stable; with
some expansion most of their aca-
demic stall problems would be
solved; and that they are com-
pletely satisfied with the rlcpui
mental policy and the caliber oi
the faculty and students.

Dean James Slauss issued a Writ-
ten statement to the ski! which
said that lurllover was at “the
normal level" from 1964-65 to 1955-
66. srnuss cited .. Tlpl'oved protes-
sional opportunity.” “desire to
teach ill a larger department in
to live iii an urban area," and
“more promising personal or pro-
iessional satisfactions our other
grounds” as three reasons why
facility leave Grinnell.
