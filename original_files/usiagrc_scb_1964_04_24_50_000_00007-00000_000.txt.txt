Ball Team“ Wins Doubleheader;
Tied for lsl in Southern Division

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell’s diamondmen fresh
from a dual win over Cornell
last week, return home for
three games this weekend
against Monmouth and Knox.
This afternoon the Pioneers
tangle with the Monmouth nine
and on Saturday mark the mid-
way point of the season by op-
posing the Siwash in a twin
bill.

On April 18th the Scarlet
pounded out identical 4-2 vii:-
tories over Cornell's Rams at
Mt. Vernon. Once again, fine
pitching paved the way with
Denny Hanssen going the route
in the opener while Barry M.
Anderson and Cal Collier
teamed up to win the nighteap.
Hanssen also Whiffed 12 batters
in his seven inning stint.

Nick Nonas lead the Pioneer
hitting attack against the
Rams by slamming a bases»
loaded triple in the second
game and driving in a total of
5 runs for the day. Nonas' six
hits in the twin bill boosted his
season batting average up to
.272.

Hanssen, Collier, Dave Syn-
burst and Dick Ulrich, who is
hitting .600, also picked up key
hits for the Scarlet. in a
marked improvement over past
performances, th e Grinnell
squad committed a total of
only one error in both con-
tests.

Grinnell p r u s p e cts with
guarded optimism. "We passed
a crucial test last week,” com-
merited Pfitsch, “but we've got
an important series coming up.
We need at least two wins this
weekend to be a real contend-
er.” Pfitsch attributes the fine
showing so far to a combina-
tion of things. The crew of
sophomores ‘on the roster,
many of whom did not play
frosh ball last year, have come
around at the plate and now
carry much of the hitting load
"If we keep up this hitting and
maintain our improved field-
ing, we might have a really
fine season,” predicted Pfitsch.

The major threat to the Pio-
neers hopes will come from
the Knox team that invades
Grinnell tomorrow. The Siwash
right now are tied with the
Pioneers for the lead in the
MCAC Southern Division, hold-
ing down a 3-1 conference rec-
ord and a [H overall mark.
Picked by the D. M, Register
for a pennant repeat this year,
Knox has most of its veterans
returning mis season, includ-
ing mound star Doug Ziech,
along with some fine hurling
prospects up from 1953’s fresh
squad,

This afternoon's opponent,
Monmouth, handed Knox their
only setback so far in the young
campaign. The Scots figure as
a dark horse in the pennant
race this year.

Slated for pitching duty for
the Pioneers this weekend are
Denny Hanssen, Barry M. An-
derson and Steve Tilly.

Thin Treads for Speed

AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Craig
Breedlove set a world’s land
speed record of 407 miles an
hour in his jet car “Spirit or
America" on tires with paper—
thin treads.

The tires were made that
way because centrifugal force
and heat, not wear. are the
chief problems in driving at
high speeds, says the Goodyear
Cd, designers of the tires.

Well, the baseball season‘s in
full swing eVen'if all of the
mighty 1M batters aren’t.

Even a few cold and dismal
days haven’t deterred the
many hale and hearty athletes
of North Campus, and only
once, last Monday, did Mr.
Truesdale have to restrain the
eager baseball addicts from
rushing the three playing fields
amidst the onslaught of a pun-
ishing rainstorm. Monday's
games were made up last Weds
nesday, however.

Dibble and South were the
teams to beat as of last Wed-
nesday noon, both‘teams boast-
ing a 3-0 record. Rawson and
Smith were up there too, how-
ever, with 2 wins and 1 loss
each. East is next with a 2-2
record. West and Clark are
likewise balanced, but with 1-1
records. North was l-Z, and
Cowles, Gates, and Langan
were doing an especially fine
job of holding down last place,

with 0-3, 0-2, and 0-2 record!
respectively. I’ll tell you some<
thing, though; if they gave
pomts to the team having the
most fun, Langan w o u i (
easily be in the lead.

It’s a little early yet to make
any accurate predictions, but
I'd guess South, East, and
maybe Rawson, if Rein Saral
can control his speedy pitch-
ing. will be among the top Con-
tenders, Dibble and Smith,
though, certainly can’t be dis
counted yet.

Track and Golf meets are
bout coming up. May 2, is the
Track date (May 9, if it rains),
and May i, and s, are the Golf
dates (or May ii, i! one date is
postponed).

in Track, I’d say watch Gates
or Dibble. Golf should be (21058.
but I've got a feeling East will
be tough. Whatever the out-
come, there should be pretty
good participation, and if you‘
possibly can, help out with of»
riciating at the Track meet. Til
next time.
