Asks Contributions for New Pool

.To the Editor:

Jim Adelman was absolutely
correct in his letter to the Scar-
let and Black in which he
pointed out that there is a great

contrast between the dilapi-
dated, totally inadequate swim»
ming pool and the rest of the
campus. The pool is too short,
too narrow, and does not have
Onough lanes. The locker rooms
Ire small and shabby, the air
is hot and muggy, and pro-
visions for audiences are poor
in every sense oi the word. We
have, without the slightest
doubt, the worst pool and pool
building in the Midwest Confer-
ence. The present pool is inade-
quate tor competitive swim-
ming, Red Cross instruction,
White Caps synchronized swim-
ming, and recreational SWlm-
ming.

The administration and Board
of Trustees are well aware of
the existing need for a new pool.
The administration has had
some tentative plans drawn up
for a swimming pool—recreation
building complex. Mr. Stauss
has told me that another capi-
tal fund drive will be launched
in three or four years with the
construction of this building
definitely in mind.

I was happy to learn that the
administration and Trustees are
going to do something about
our swimming pool dilemma.
However, I think We. the stu
dents, should also take an ac-
tive interest in the problem, We
ought to try to convince our
families and other people i -
tcrested and potentially inter-
ested in Grinnell
specify that their donation he

proposed swimming poolrrecre-
ation building. Now is the time
to begin helping Grinnell build
a capital reserve for the proj-
ect. A little contribution of time
and effort in this direction by
each or us will help to prove
that we feel obligated to play a
responsible part in the improve
ment or Grinnell College.

is that God made the white and

neither should White and black

Discrimination and prejudice
can also come from individual
psychological difficulties. Indi-

by something against which
they cannot rebel. This free

used against the Negroes, a

according to Burma.

lungu: Africa Gets Rotten Press

To the Editor:

The treatment 0| Africa and
its n‘AKlOl’I'ttl leaders by the West-
ern press, almost \vithoui ex-
ceptlon, has been little short oi
scandalous, This has been espe-
Clally true since Ghana inaugu-
rated its iirst Africanvled gov
ernment under President Nkru-
mah.

it seems that during this pe
riod of the “Cold War” Amel'ir
cans are not willing to accept
countries and governments
that do not Conform to the
image they desire or whose
economic policies are not a
ceptable to their business i
teresm, Therefore they use the
press and other opinion-forming
agencies to support or destroy
the governments or African
leaders that. do not conform to
the leaders they desire. In the
creation or this image certain
press correspondents are notor»
ions for their animosity toward
certain countries and leaders.
Almost invariably, the leaders
that they hate are those who
seem determined to follow a
policy oi their own choosing.

The role of Correspondents in
destroying these leaders follows
a definite pattern. Although the
pattern has over and over
proved inaccurate or dissipated,
the practice still continues up
to this minute. For example, at
an earlier time Nasser was de-
picted as a "Communist."
When this did not stand up, he
was depicted as a tool for the

open. Applications are due Mon-
day, April 26, to Mr. Verrette.

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

it was spring and, as it so oiien does. it had
instilled the milk OI human klndness in my veins.
I was at peace with the World and all of God’s
creatures The sun had soothed my angry brow
and robin's song and gentle breeze had calmed
my Whiter-rattled nerves.

And 1 went to the bookstore to purchase some
toilet items.

“Leave that book an the shelves."

My reverie was shaitered. “l'm sort-y,
did you say?"

With less palience, “Your book, leave it on the
shelves up there. Can’t you read the Sign” Don't
you know you can’t bring your book into the book-
store?"

“Oh, I'm sorry, i just wasn't thinking. lt’s spring
you know."

“Well, try thinking next lime.”

Her unspi-ing-likc liosnlity shocked the tram my
thoughts or the idyllic months or summer that lay
waiting oulya iew short weeks ahead.

1 put my book or verse that l had so recently
bten reading while sitting under a trce on the
shelves indicated to me,

i went about my business and selected a tooth

gwe Inc a manly scent, and hair tonic that I was
urn-nod [0 use at my own risli lesi it provoke some
girl to unladyrlike behavior. Alter all, it was spring
and my iancy had turned lightly to .

“Yeah liid, it's your turn. That hair tonic is 81

what

cents, the shaving cream 98 cents, and the tootlb
paste is 70 cents. That’s $2.55 plus three cents tax
for a total of $2.58.”

“I’ll need a check . . . from the Poweshiek Coun-
ty National Bank.“

“Didn’t they give you any or youi own?”

“Sure, sure, but I don’t have my book with me."

“Well, you should, Be sure you put your hall,
home address. ramily doctor and blood type under
your signature."

“Sure thing, lust llke always."

"And put your checking account number on it.”

"My checliing account number?” i stopped rilling
out the check,

“Yes, it's printed on your regular checks. Put
it on that one.”

“You mean all those electronic hiei-oglyphics
they have on the bottom? My God, I Can't even
read those let alone write them.” I was already
tearing up my checli.

“I’m sorry. We Citn'l cash the check unless that

number's there,"
“Don’t I even get some credit tor being able to
pronounce Poweshick correctly?" She wasn’tl
amused. 1
"it you can’t pay tor ilic purchase. put the stud
back."

I did. I went downtown and bought the slit“. They
don't give me any trouble uboui a number on the
check They seemed glad to see the money. The_
stuff only Cost me $1.96 downtown.

And they smiled.

 

Communists The fact that Nash
ser had outlawed the Commu-
nist Party in Egypt and was
clearly set out on an independ
ent course made absolutely no
difference!

Incidentally. African leaders
long ago discovered that it isn't
important what steps they take
to demonstrate their independr
ence, if it fits the gimmick of
the Western press to charge
them with being “Communist”
or “Communist Stooges," truth
will have nothing to do with it.
so they pay no attention one
way or another to th ese
charges. and are not in the
least influenced by them.

Africans in the United States
eventually find out that the
American press has only one

concern about Africa as a con-
tincnt, and its leaders, and that
is: where do they tit In the
“cold war”? This is also true
of the individual leaders. If the
press determines that a leader
does not fit into their cold war
plans, they proceed to destroy
him. Felix Lungu

Individualism. Responsibility
Re-examined by Miss Smith

To the Editor

In Miss Yenawine‘s letter of‘

last week the Grinnell sludentsl

were accused of an egocentric in-l

dlvidualism which lacks the (18-:

gree oi personal responsibility
which is, according to her, desir-‘
able. Surely personal responsibi i-
ty cannot be scoffed at — and law ‘
students would I believe, deny that .
it. is desirabi but Miss Yenawinel
has used it interchangeably witbl
responsibility for others, and a dis-
tinction, I think. must be made.
The observance that the new
breed of individualism which has
cropped up in the last several‘
years lacks an element oi respon-l
sibility to others is somewhat well-
founded. There is, among many
students, an unwillingness to take:
responsibility for the behavior or
others or to be responsible to oth-
ers for their own behavior. Per?
sonal responsibility implies a will»
ingness to take responsibility iori

one’s own actions, is it possible to
have both? I doubt it. I can be re—
sponsible for my own behavior
only if i am tree to do so (note,
please, the “positive” use of the
word “free"), and I cannot be free
to do so if I am being constantly
badgered by others who reel equal-
ly called upon to be my guardian.
The only way in which the two
kinds of responsibility can be can
existent to the same degree is it
every individual evaluates his be
havior in the same way as do his
peers. Gl'innell. thank God, is still
far from that situation.

Concern for fellow students' wel-
fare is another of Miss Yenawme's
pleas. Welfare. it seems to me, re-
fers to the Creation of Cami ons
which are conducive to maln-
ing a reasonably stable existence.
Exactly what does this term menu
