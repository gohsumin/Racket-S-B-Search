The total number of re-
sponses to the question exceeds
60, the number of question-
naires returned, because many
people thought that the deci-
sion should be a result of con-
lultatiort from several ele-
menu.

in comments appended to the
questionnaire, many students
registered opposition to obstruc-
tionist tactics oi demonstration,
arguing for the necessity of pro-
tecting. the right or students
who wish to hold job inter
views.

Other comments concerned
the question of “who should de-
cide what recruiters to allow
on campus A junior suggested
a “policy committee." The same
student was in favor of all mili-
tary and industry recruitment
being held oil-campus — a senth
ment repeated also in comments
by other respondents. A fresh-
man thought that students
alone should decide ”since we're
paying for the iacilities here."

The “comments" section also
showed a typical collection at
the currently popular campus
declarations about war, Dow
and recruitment. A senior to
epondent opined, “No college
or university has In obligation
to provide recruitment tuciuties

tor murders (sic) and govern<
meat spies.”
A sophomore penned the fol-

lowing conglomerate. “I do not
believe that an educational in-
stitution should allow military
recruitment on its campus. I
believe that in doing so it in
complying with an unjust war.
It is not the place of a free
thinking institution to take poll-
tical stance. it is an instituﬂon
at many beliefs."

Another student expressed his
reaction to this type of reason-
ing. “it is beyond my under-
standing why the so-called Lih.
eral Zealots are so dedicated
to tree association, but are so
hostile to the practice of that
entity when it goes against their
ideology."

PAPER ERIPERS

NEWTON, Kan, Jan. 31
(ACP) — You could put your
gripe in the student govem-
mellt's suggestion box or write
a letter to the editor of the
college paper. Or you could tell
it to the world from a soapbox.

But at Bethel College in New-
ton, Kansas, the Collegian re-
ports, you go to an old storage
room in the southeast corner oi
the student union.

It's an “hostility room,"
where students release their
hostilities (and entertain them-
selves and others) by writing
on the paper-covered walls.

The hostility room was the
iirst step in a student govem-
merit project at Bethel to im-
pmve communication with the
student body.

RiOT REPORTS

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (CPS)
—'i‘iie Presidential commission
studying last summer’s riots will
deliver its tlnal repolt several
months ahead of its Original
deadline, with much oi its re-
search incomplete, because its
researchers' iindings didn’t jibe
with the kind oi report tho Ad-
ministration wantedt

As is, a newsletter on civil
rights and community action
edited by Dave Steinberg oi the
National Student Association,
says the commission’s admin-
istrative stati suppressed much
of what the researchers had
found.

As an example, As is says

,the researchers round in one

city that “there was no ques<
tlon that the police —- not No.
groes — were the rioters. brlng«
ing a hioodhath to an innocent
Negro community."

AS IS says that faced with
these reports, the Administra-
tive Sta.“ oi the commission,
in consultation with the White
House, decided Il'lat this infor-
mation had to be suppressed be-
cause:

It “would embarrass too many
people in an election year,"

—“There would be too iew
kind words for local police, or
for local political leaders."

H'Ihe report “could only sup‘
port an outcry tor radically im
creased iederal expenditure."
while the President is cuttlng
domestic programs to meet the
expenses at the Woman: war.

So the final deadline for the
commission report was moved
up, This is what happended, ac-
cording to As Is:

the Commission), presumably
in consultation with Governor
Otto Kerner oi lllinois, chair-
man at the Commission, in-
formed Commission members

Activists Beware] Sedentary is the word ior weekend on the
ole Grinnell oampus. Our intellectuals may have something to
blow their minds on, however, because the gist of this weekend‘s
activities ale directed toward stretching their minds. But for those
at you whose minds fatigue more easily than your bodies there are
some events bent on expending all your pent up energies.

Friday night, l'm afraid, will not alleviate the student‘s tediurn
oi reclining or rather draping one’s self all over or in a seat. How
ever, you will iind its mental exercise less exhausting than an av-
erage Biology lecture.

At 8 pm. in South Lounge, Jorge Luis Borges. the prominent
ﬁrgentinian writer and critic will be lecturing on The an or Writ-

g.

This lecture may prove extremely interesting to you buddln
creative writers, however, do not be alarmed ii in the backgroung
you hear those wailing voices of despairing Spanish majors who
are also connoisseurs oi Grinnell’s concert programs.

If it’s not obvious already, Paul Hersh's Piano and Viola R94
cital will be held concurrently in Roberts Theatre, Hersh, a mem.
ber of Grinnell's own LenDX Quartet, will be assisted this evening
by Joan Purswell, an associate oi our Music Department from
iowa City. Their program will include Bach’s ltalian Concerto
Mozart's sonata in A Minor, and Sonata in F Minor for Viola and
Piano by Brahms.

Later at lo pm. and again on Sunday at 9 p.m., you flick tid<
diets will find a short respite in ARH where The Swindler, an early
Fellini production, will be shown, ‘

And last but not least, all you funrseekers may work out All
your frustrations at the Bowladrome from 1 until 12 where you
may bowl tree of charge by the hour.

On Saturday night {or all you terpsicholean fanatics, the
W.R.A., with the assistance of the South Campus Social Chairmen,
will be presenting the traditional Dance lntramurais in Robert:
Theatre at 8 pm. The subject ior this year's extravaganza u
Happiness is . . . Five of the women’s halls will be competing inl-
prizes awarding points toward their annual Intramural trophy.
Mrs. Parssmen, Mrs. Durkee, Mr. Gale, Mrt Ingham and Mr. Hor-
toll will be Judging each hall's dances on technique and composi-
tion, theme and continuity, costumes and music. For your addi-
tional entertainment the Scarleteerli and the Tanagels will be per-
forming.

it by 9:30 Saturday night you have only tired at resting upon
your posterior, migrate to North Lounge where you will ﬁnd the
X L’s, a group from lowa City, pounding out primitive rhythmical
beats. They promise to he as good in Grinnell, lowa, as they were
on the silver screen in Hollywood.

At 10:30 in ARH our Economics majors as well as all you
protagonists followers, will eye-witness a documentary on a Medi.
eval incomedistribution scheme or more mundanely The Adven-
tures of Robin Hood.

And it by now, you have not found the needed panacea for
your study doldrums, i suggest that you find (our dollars and buy
yourself a round—trip Greyhound ticket to Des Moines (or the
weekend.
