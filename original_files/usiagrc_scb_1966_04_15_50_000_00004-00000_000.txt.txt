Cyclone '66

By JOHN WOLF

Last year’s Cyclone editor said.
"it you’re really going to do the
yearbook the way you plan to, you
won't, have time for anything
sister"

She was right about the “any«
thing else," but this year’s editors
ARE doing the Cyclone the way
they planned to,

John Phillips, co-editor of the ’66

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PHILLIPS

Cyclone, leels that “it is our over-
all purpose to give the concept oi
'yearbook’ a new vitality and re-
vive it as a meaningful institution,
It has so much potential; t's time
to take advantage at it.”

Among the major additions to
this year's book are senior por»
traits taken in real-life situations.

Managing editor Susan Barquist,
who has been organizing the tak-
ing of senior portraits, says, "Sen-
iors have been photographed in an
Economics seminar, in the new
greenhouse, at the skating rink, as
well as playing in a Wednesday
,‘night jam session, partaking at
the Rex. watching a basketball
game. working in the library and
in the art department, dissecting
rats in lab, staring on into space
in their looms—8nd this is only
Ihe beginning."

"Faculty pictures are being tak-
en in more or less the same man-
ner as senior pictures, very often
in classroom situatlons." notes coa
editor Henry Wilhelm. “We want to
portray iaculty members in the
way that students are likely to
remember them. We photographed
Mr. Eastman in his home talking
with the Ethics«M0raiity Stu d y

BAROUIST

 

Group, and Mrs Kurtz wants his
picture taken with his family rid-
ing their bicycles down Park
Street. We think this will be a
much more rneaninghrl type of pic.
ture than the usual stilted studio
type portrait. The studenttaeulty
portraits will, by the way of their
varied situations, also show a
great deal of the ‘Grinneli expeb
lence.' ”

In commenting on sales, busi»
ness manager Tim Ablett notes:
“Things are going pretty well;
however we are trying to sell more
books this year than were sold in
past years There are still many
taculty members and seniors who
haven’t ordered a book. We think
that most seniors will want a hook,
especially because ot the g reat
space that will be devoted to senior
portraits, Therefore, we are ex
tending sales another week until
April 25.

“When the 1965 Cyclone came
out there were a surprising num-
her of people who, wanted to buy
a book but who hadn’t ordered
one the year hetore. Next October
we won't have any extra ‘66
Cyclones, and I would hate to see
anyone disappointed. Practically
everyone in Grinneli Will be pic—
tured in one activity or another,
but many people won't realize this
until the book is already out . s .
and by then it will be too late
to do anything about it.”

Phillips and Wilhelm explain:
"An example of how we will cover
an event is the story of SGA—
the convention and the election.
We have been taking pictures at

 

SGA activities for some time—to

the consternation of some of the ,

ofﬁcers~snd these Will be the
background of the story of the
election. What SGA was and was
not doing were important issues
with the various candidates, so all
these things will tie in, We fol-
lowed the candidates during their
c a m p a i g n s and [allowed their
forces during the convention and
then photographed Steve Kent as
he was told that he had Want To
this we added some of the things
that the Kent administration has
been involved in during the rest
ot the year. With appropriate copy,
this method or doing a story
should give some or the feeling of
what is to be “involved" in SGA.

“This is What. we’re trying to do

with this hook-that is, trying to

view student life as a related
whole. Most students don't lead a
compartmentalized life; people are
always doing things and relating
to other people, We’re trying to
go ln depth and get at the es-
sence at Grinnell.

“This will be a book about real
people, not just faces and events."
