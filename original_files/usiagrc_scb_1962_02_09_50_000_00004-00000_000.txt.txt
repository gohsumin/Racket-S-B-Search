t in the revised Constitution,
Article.lv, Section 2., part c. or,
the former Constitution remains
lunchanged. This rule states, “In
the election of the AWS presi—,
dent and the house presidentsl
one freshman vote will be pro-E
lportionale to two-thirds of onel
upper-class vote on the nomiv‘
natlng and flnal ballots." Y
According to Miss Dennington,l|
a poll taken in the quadranglel
during her term of office has}
shown that 300 voted in favor of
retaining the current rule, while
only thirty women‘ opposed
the rule. She encourages those
who still wish to abolish this pro-
vision to make further recom-
mendations. ‘

The procedure tor ma ing ‘
amendments has been revised
in the proposed Constitution.
Instead or requiring women
students to vote on amend-
menLStat mass meetings (Ar-
ticle VIII), the revision states
that special housemeetings may
be called for this purpose.
Another revision provides tor
the enlarging of the Constitution
Bylaws in order to include the‘
IAWS Constitution. 7
Most of the revisions have'
been made so that the AWS Con»
stitution will conform to the pre-
visions; of the SGA Constitution.
Currently at work are the two,
committees which were recently‘
set up by the AWS Board. One
committee is investigating the‘
merits and disadvantages oi
freshman residence halls; the
other is assessing the value or
quadrangle traditions. Each Com~
mittee includes one baffleboard
member from each women’s hall.‘

-the seven or

abroad as dreams come +rue

by Peg Pennington

The dream of a summer in
Europe is becoming a reality tor
millions of college studcn
Such an experience is capable
of giving the student, as no col-
lege course can, an integrated
and graphic picture or the baclc
ground and pro nt state or
Western civ ization.

Con idering the
tial value that such a trip can
,assumo, ll. seems almost tragic
|that with so many students, it
lbecomes a irustrated attempt
to fathom the hearts of individ-
uals and nations in a Ilmiled
lperiod of two or three weeks.
All too often such a trip be-
.comes a named transit through
1numerous cities and countries,
a neve ending tussle with hotel
reservations and ll‘aln connec-
tions.

Classrooms Abroad was
founded in 1955, under the
premise that one can experi—
ence only one area in a suin-
mer with any degree oi thor—
oughness and hope ioi- any
lasting results. Under this
program, students study in-
tensively cithcr French, Ger-
man, Spanish or Italian, while
living with a family in a
characteristic city. The lainily
is instructed to speak only
the language or the country
with its guests.

in 1962, Classrooms Abroad
will consist of eleven groups—
lour French-language g r o u p s,‘
four German-language groups,
two spani h-longuogc groups
and one Italian branch.

Each group will consist of 20
to 30 students who will be in—
structed in small sections or
seven to ten members during
eight weeks of
their residence. The plan is in»
tended to give them at least the
equivalent of one year of col—
lege language training.

The formal instruction will be
supplemented by inlormnl get:

sieat paten-l

itogcthers u-ith rcsidcnts of the
jcities, visits to places of historic
land literary interest, concerts,
theatres and movies, and lec-
by experts in various
holds, The study session in
teach city will be loilowcd by
izm optional two-week trip
through countries in which the
llanguage that has been studied
is spoken.

Thc fee for each participant
,will be $1150 and will include
‘tlie iollowing- ransportation to
and trom Europe by plane,
