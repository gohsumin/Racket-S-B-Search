Magee Relutes Viet Nam Column.

Wants Balanced.

To The Edltor:

Regardless or the proprieties in-
volved, i feel forced to take issue
with Mr. Goddard's recent article
on Viet Nam. It contains that com-
bination of realism, idealism, fac-
tual misstatement, Ialse logic
and an occasional perceptive in-
sight which ls typical of most cur-
rent analysis of the war in Viet
Nam and which succeeds in only
hopelessly confusing our thinking.

He states that one reason Viet
Nam is a poor place to make a
stand is the combination of impener
trable jungles and fragile govern-
ments. He argues that it is tool-
ish to take stands in areas where
topigraphical and strategic condi-
ntlons are unfavorable. First of all,
Viet Nam is by no means all
jungle — the real area of conflict
is the rich rice producing delta of
the Mekong River — and besides
jungles are not really impene-
trable today, especially in South
Viet Nam.

Furthermore, were governments
not fragile, subversion and civil
wars would be unlikely occur-
rences. insisting on taking stands
only where the governments are
“non-fragile" would eliminate the
West from attempting to influence
the situation in much of today's
world. Any government in the un<
derdeveloped world — and India
is a good example — is likely to
become more, rather than less,
fragile if it has to cope with the
problems of rapid modernization
plus subversion partially organized
and supported from the outside.

It is again wishiul thinking to
believe that our enemies or oppon-
nents (leaving mem unidentiiied
for now) Will choose to challenge
us in areas where the strategic
and topographical conditions fa-
vor us. The point about guerrilla
nl' revolutionary warfare is that
it is a weapon that does not re

say, then, what he proposes, but
one can only assume he is suggest-
ing withdrawal, Does this have a
“foundation in political reality,"
however? Or do we then make it
clear to friends and foes alike that
the real lesson from Viet Nam is
that is partially successlul guer-
rlla warfare operation over diffi-
cult terrain in unstable societies
will mean an American (and
therefore probably Western) With-
drawal? Might it not be better to
hang on for as long as possible,
make it as difficult for the enemy
as possible and hopefully learn
some Valuable lessons for the
next encounter — which will sure
ly come? (See the recent report in
the N.Y. Times on the beginnings
in Thailand, February ll, 1965.)

i am not arguing ior this policy
or against it; I am arguing for a
more balanced and factual assess-
ment of the Viet Nam situation
which as Mr. Goddard recognizes
only a simpleton Will have simple
answers for.

By way of conclusion, although
many matters remain that should
be discussed (such as the perva-
siveness of corruption and author«
itarianism of one branch or an-
other in most governments of the
underdeveloped world), Mr. God-
dard has one consolation. If his
analysis proves to be correct, he
obviously wins. But if i have
shown it to be somewhat defec-
tive, he is still excused since he
learned his political science in my
class.

these examples do prove is that it

that South Viet Nam — because of
different circumstances —— looks
even more difficult.

that any hopes of a negotiated
settlement are naive. He does not

‘Shades of Gray'

Too Slanted Says

Anonymous Reader

To The Editor:

I happened to pick up your
paper while visiting a friend’s
home and read the article
“What the New World Hath
Wrought" by Carl Otis Gray,
which I think is downright
nasty or should I say "sick,
sick, sick.”

Mr, Gray should realize that
“time marches on” not only
in beauty aids, but also science.
medicine, foods, etc, But he
should not limit these artificial
beauty aids to the white female
only as you can see these some
products being used by all
races and all to the good. I

might add On television and ,

on the streets you can notice
how the appearance of all
women has improved and has
also aided in securing employ-
ment. So let the’ “non-White
male" take a good look at the
female of his race and he will
find himself “lusting" after
her.

As for as interracial love is
concerned, that too has been
changing toward the better, but
since conditions like this were
existing since days of the cave
man on, there probably will
always exist in all countries
so much of this. Mr. Gray evi-
dently is referring to the Civil
War era and before, but to-
day, in modern times, it is
not a ”cash and carry rela~
tionship” confined only to the
colored races and the white,
but more a matter of choice of
the individual Concerned.

Girls Wonder About Women’s Weekend,
Challenge Appropriateness of Tradition

To The Editori

After observing [W0 Women’s
Weekends, we have come to
question the appropriateness of
continuing the tradition of
Women’s Weekend from the
standpoint of the attitudes ex-
pressed by both men and Wom-
en.

is it appropriate or worth
while to continue a social func-
tion such as Women‘s Weekend
in which dating norms are com-
pletely reversed and both men
and woman are placed in oft-

times awkward and embarrasur
ing situations? We cite the fol»
lowing examples: (a) Making
the date — the embarrassing
complications of neither person
knowing the other; (b) Break-
ing the data — no elucidation
necessary.

Judging from opinions ex-
pressed by both men and wom-
en there are those who are at
best disenchanted and at worst
annoyed by the custom of Worn-
eri's Weekend.
