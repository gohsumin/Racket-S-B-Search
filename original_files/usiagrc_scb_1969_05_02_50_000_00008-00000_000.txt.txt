The 70 per cent of the student body
who voted on Monday was a sharp con-
trast to the sparse turnout at n discusr
siiJn with the candidates held in the
South Lounge on the eve of the election.

“The main purpose of a hall presi-

ent,” Lisa Cheraskin concluded there,

‘is to coordinate the hall into a workable
living situation." Ideas on how to achieve
that goal varied considerably among the
oandldates.

The relative merits of hall unity Vs.
individuality was a prevalent topic. it
was generally telt that hails should pro-
vide for various activities, but only it
its residents wished to participate. Alex
Karlin suggested holding a meeting of
people who select the same hall to de
oide what “direction a hall should go
in.” He stated that problems and disli-
lusionment oiten arise because individu-
als do not clearly understand their pres-
ldent’s position when they became
members of a hail. Suggestions to im-
prove hall unity or spirit would be to
use the lounge as a center, to encourage
halirsponsored discussions with profes-
sors, and to have hail dinners. Hall unity
might be encouraged, but the underly-
ing individuality of each hall member
would be maintained,

Among the women, practical question:
such as "How do you keep the kitchen
clean?” were presented to see how the
candidates would solve the difiicult prob-
lems of rule enforcement, organization
and acquiring the cooperation of every
individual. A prevailing view was ex-
pressed by Frances Gray: “If the house
president is going to be the enforcer of
anything, it should be consideration."

Opinions on the intra-hall illegal use
of drugs ranged from it laissez-fairo at-
titude to a ban-on-drugs hall policy. Car-
ulyn Canfieid said that the illegal use of
drugs within a hail would jeopardize th-
Dther hall members, Most candidate:
iwere characterized by a refusal to taka
any action unless the individuals involv-

ed became ”indiscreet," in which case
they would speak to those individuals.
Giving information to hall residents ti)
acquaint them with all the facts about
dnig use was also advocated by Sonia
candidates.

Plans to have hall members aid each
other in their academic lile would in-
clude hall tutoring programs, having
majors discuss their courses and pro
tessors with prospective majors, and
asking upperciassmert to acquaint rresh-
men with what the general requirement
courses entail, The “gulfH between North
and south campus might be bridged by
lnterhail dinners and a system of “Sis-
ter halls” from the opposite sides or
the campus, someone suggested.

lMlke Penzner affirmed a need [or in‘
formal coed social functions for people
who don’t: date. “We need to generate
an atmosphere to make that. kind of
thing acceptable —— to let people relax
with one anotharl"

The basil: theme of the candidates was
reﬂected in the word “communication,”
or as Roy Lewis put it: ‘People should
try to get together and talk things out.“

Support Breakfast Fund

By KIT LEDER

A drive on campus to raise funds for
the Black Panther Party of Des Moines'
Free Breakfast for Children Program
evoked a response amounting to over
$146 in collections. Money was collected
at tables in lunch and dinner lines, in
the Forum, and in the Post Office dur-
ing a six-day campaign last week,

The Free Breakfast For Children Pro-
gram is the first public service program
instituted by the still young Panthers of
Des Moines it is designed to provide
a free hot breakfast for school children
of Black communities who would other
wise have to sit through each morning
on an empty stomach. The program is
dependent on community response, and
the contributions from Grilmeii are one
step in the direction of promoting a sense
of community between white students
and young Black people.

However, some elements within the
city of Des Moines have no philanthropic
feelings toward the Panthers; last Sat-
urday night their headquarters wal
bombed and several Panthers were ur-
rested for “assaulting" policemen, while
other panthert were maced for standing
too near them on the fmnt porch of the
bombed house. it appears that lines are
being drawn within Des Moines, and the
Panthers are being confronted with
problems which may slow down their
efforts to respond to the pressing needs
of the Black communities.

 

Students Organize
Town Discussions

By KATHY run;

In an effort to communicate with the
town and to encourage discussion about

the war, Grinnell students started tall-o-
ing with members or community organi-
zations this week, The responses have
varied

The First Congregational Church asked
for a discussion or debate, and the Grin~
nell high school student body president
said he would try to set up a panel or
high sohool teachers and, perhaps, obl~
legs professors to discuss the Vietnam
war in an allrschool assembly. He also
said he would circulate an anti-war petlr
tion that will be presented to the city
council.

The American Legion planli a
meeting within a week to consider the
proposed discussions, and the Episcopal
Church has asked for a discussion on
May lot. (This date may have been
changed because Ted Glick’a dralt card
turn—in was scheduled for that night.)

when Mark Graesor called the Cham-
ber oi Commerce to ask if they would ho
interested in helping to set up discussions
about Vietnam, the reply was, “You’re
sick,“ Graesor commented to the 8&5,
“I felt terribly frustrated and saddened.
My stomach was upset. I’m afraid we
underestimated the potential negative re-
action at the town."

Other students are talking with {arm
organizations, Grinnell Democratic and
Republican parties, other churches, and
the League of Women Voters. Senator
Bill Stranger is trying to find a short
film to be shown at the Strand Theater
before the Ieatured movies.

The Grinneli Herald-Register asked
senior Bruce Armstrong, (who has been
talking with Editor Al Finder), to Write
an article to present his “assessment of
what happened.” The article was prinb
ed unedited, in Monday's Register. in
his article, Armstrong stated that the
inverting of the flag was the well-intew
tioned act oi one person (actually, there
were two) and asked that "the concern
of the average citizen" about the war
be voiced. Ted Glick talked with the
chief of police, Bill Peters. Peters said
that the US. hould get out of Vietnam
If it takes 5 million men and an atom
bomb, but does not feel that he can take
a public stand in his position, Glick said.

chuck creamed

The “pied piper" oi the Saga Food
Ben/ice, Clarence “Saga Chuck” Hand,
was smacked with 25 whipped cream
pics at an Apr. 20th Spring Picnic and
Kite-Fly on the Women's Athletic Field.
After putting himself before a student
tiring squad, Chuck’s only comment
was a pathetic, “Are you finished yet?"
The answer was another pie in Chuck's
face. Saga supplied the pies and sport-
sored the activities.
