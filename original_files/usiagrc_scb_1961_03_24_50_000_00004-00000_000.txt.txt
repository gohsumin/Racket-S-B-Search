Piitsch went from the small
junior college to Texas Uni-
versity where he graduated
two years later with a bathe»

Texas U, had the number one
tennis team in the nation while
Pfitsch was there, He was eighth
man on a squad which sent its
top two players to compete as
gninst one another for the ‘NCAA
title one year.

”We picked up a lot of valu-
able experiencc," says Pfitsch,
“from playing matches with
Wilmer Allison and Allen Van
Ryse, members of the Davis Cup
team of 193745, who used to
play on the Texas I]. courts."

Pfitsch got his start in coach»
ing from one of the greatest
men in the business, “PI-log”
Allen of the University of Kaila
|sas. “Dr. Allen brought his has»
kctball team to Texas once,"
said Plitsch, “and i asked him
for a lab He gave it to me."

“Dr. Allen was the greatest
, man I everknew,"saidPiitsch.

“He didn’t have any reason to
take me in at Kansas, but he
did, and he gave me a job as
trainer and let me work out
with his squads just like the
players."

"I learned most of

The theory behind the new
program, stated Bowen, is that
“recreation flourishes when it is,
free and spontaneous rather
than when it is required."

the college will soon have an
artificial skating rink in operas
tion, complete with open fire
place, lights and music.

Plans will also be made for a
new union, swimming pool, wo—I
men‘s gymnasium, field house
and related structures. Bowen:
added, ”I believe that increased,
recreation and physical activity
is very important at Grinnell.
We all lead busy, and on the
whole sedentary lives, and we
need the :release and change of
pace that can be achieved,
through physical activity."

Another forthcoming de-
velopment at Grinnell con-
cerns the fine arts. in conjunc—
tion with the completion of
the Fine Arts building, next
year will see a special em-
phasis on the arts, an in-
creased number of concerts,
recitals, plays, lectures, ex-
hibits and other events.

Bowen said, “The purpose of
this building is not only to ims‘
prove our work in the arts for‘
those students who major in
these fields, but to bring the
arts increasingly into the lives
and consciousness of our entire
student body."

Grinnell, ‘Bawsn continued,
“has been making travel grants,

underdeveloped country. We
have our own Youth Corps
which has anticipated President
Kennedy’s Youth Corps," How-
ever since the federal governs
ment has set up its own prq—,
gram, Grinnell’s will probably
be discontinued. Students ln-l
terestcd in service abroad are‘
advised to apply to the federal
program.

Dr. Bowen concluded his re~.
marks by saying that “much of
our progress has been due to
the student body which has re—i
ponded remarkably to the op-
portunities available here. I
want to thank you for your part I
in the progress of the college
and to wish you a pleasant

:Tennis Hopes

‘ by Tom Fullrner

‘. Led by three returning letters
men and bolstered by an excep—
tional group of sophomores, this
,y-ear's tennis team is looking to
improve on last year's five win
three 1055 record. From that
.squ'dd, which placed third in the
Conference rncct, only Bill Me—
Clung was lost through gradua-
tion. He played in the number
three position,

Edd Bowers, who takes over
the coaching reins this ycar from
[W Simone. will have a lot of
talent to Work with. John Ru-
vaids, number one man from last
season, returns along with other
lcttermen Joel Prescott and Roger
Sternberg. The latter is out at
the present time with a knee in-
jury, but he is expected to return
to action shortly.

Perhaps the grealest interest
lies in this years sophomore
group. Last year's undetected
freshmen squad sends Guy Ash-
ton, li-a Keeshin and Jim Smith,

Coach Bowers rates Ashton as
one of the finest prospects he

has ever seen. The consensus

seems to be that, Ashtan will
immediately step into the num-
ber one position.

Other players expected to add
depth to the team are Bob Bram—
son, Tom Cook, Chip Salmon, Bill
Plan. and Dick Andersan,

The sirength of the rest. of the
Conference is unknown, but
Bowers believes that. this year's
squad will Tank with Grimeli’s

lfmest and can easily be rated as

one of the favorites for the Con-
ference crown.

The varsity will play its first
match at Cornell on April '1.
The following day the six man
traveling squad will journey to
Galesburg, ill. to take on Knox.
