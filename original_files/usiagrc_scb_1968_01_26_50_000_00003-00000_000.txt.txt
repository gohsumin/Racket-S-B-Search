put further burdens on the bud-
get of the private college.
John I-lolt Myers, attorney
with the iirm of Williams,
Myers and Quiggie wrote in
the American Alumni Council's
COMMENTARY: I‘Tha (tax)
regulations as proposed indi-
cate once again that colleges
and universities which now are
not even required to ﬁle in~
come tax retunis are becoming
more and more involved with
the Federal income tax law.

According to the Des Moines
Register: “Average tuition at
the private colleges in iowa
this year is about $1,097, some
$724 higher than at the state
universities.

The gap has been widening
for several years."

Grinncll's tuition ior 1968-69
Will be 32.125. Even beiore the
new tax proposals could take
effect, the private College is at
a disadvantage financially.

The higher tuition costs and
other problems or the small
college were discussed at Grin<
nell's Legislator Dinner last
Thursday the 18th.

Dr, Irwin J. Lubhers, Presi«
dent of the Iowa Association of
Private Colleges and Universi-
ties said that the privately
supported colleges "are really
facing a buZZvSaw, Many are
just scared to death the private
college is going to go the same
way the private academy did."

The President of Drake Uni-
versity, Dr. Paul F. Sharp,
suggested a program of state
grants-in-aid to college students
to put the cost of education at
private colleges within the
reach of more Iowans.

While the three state univer-
sities are overcrowded and
Spending millions of dollars in
tax money to build more iacili<
ties, Sharp said, there are 9,000
spaces available to students in
the 23 private colleges and uni-
versities of lowa.

The estimated cost oi the
grants-in—aid program is $4 < $7
million tor the iirst two years.

If the state universities were
to absorb the 36,505 students
now enrolled in private institu-
tions, the operating costs alone
are computed by Sharp at £32
million.

This does not include addi-
tional classrooms and dorms.

Lamble concluded: “In my
opinion, they (the U.S. govA
ernment) Will have to turn
around and supply higher edu-
cation . . . possibly even to
graduate school.”

The words SCARLET a BLACK in the newspaper’s ﬂag on page one are set in Pill-
DlAN type style, a type race which came into prominence about the time Iowa Coilege
moved rrom Davenport to merge with J. B. Grinneil‘s proposed university.

A Iprgrapber’s manual or Ihe 1870’s said that PHlDlAN “. . . suggests action, even

inspiration

. It is a strong band gloved in velvet."

The Grinnell College newspaper began in 1871 as the iOWA COLLEGE NEWSLETTER
and later incorporated the PULSE, a competing college publication, to tor-m a paper called
THE UNIT. In the early 1890’s, that paper changed its name to the SCARLET & BLACK.

Long noted as ”the oldest college newspaper West or the Mississippi," the 5&3 begins
its 194th semester or publication with portraits or J. n. Grinnell and Horace Greeley in

its nag.

Greeley told Grinnell to go West and thus coined a byword in American history. This
semester‘s editors of the 3&3 consider this newspaper, thereioie, a scion or Greeley‘s in-
ﬂuential New York WEEKLY TRIBUNE, which has itseu become a byword in the his

tory oi American journalism.

THE RIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

The President, it is said, handswrote the version of the Stat.
of the Union address we all heard, and the credibility gap n0t<
withstanding, it is altogether plausible that it is so.

it was a pretty awiul speech, awiul in every sense. in con-
cept, it was utterly unimaginative. in style, totally, relentlessly
lacking in distinction. Mr. Johnson’s deliveryisurely?Ais the
worst in history? My own memory goes back only as tar as FDR,
who was supreme, and they say that President Buchanan was
pretty bad, but sight unseen, I'd listen to James Buchanan read
through the entire encyclopaedia, rather than the incumbent recite
one poem by Edgar Guest,

The principal deficiencies of the speech have been only re-
marked—the lailure to integrate the Vietnam War to our foreign
policy; the iailure to explore the root causes at the restlessness
to which he rleetingly alluded; the encyclopaedic enumeration
of all the blessings he has conferred upon us (the President even
found time to mention his program tor the redwood trees in Calif<
ornta, at which point Mr. Arthur Schlesinger leaned over to mo
and whispered “better redwoods than deadwoods," whereupon I
granted him a plenary indulgence for all his past sins); etc. etc.
etc.

But besides all that, the speech was peppered with irritating
phrases or little moment except insofar as they suggest the proiila
oi the President’s thought.

What are We to make. for instance, of the sentence: “Tonight
our nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever
been accomplished before”? A moment's concentration on that
sentence leads one to the brink of total dismay. Consider, to begin
With the syntax. What does he mean, “tonight”? Apparently. a
synonym — more technically, a synecdoche — for “At this point.”
But the clumsiness is distracting. And then again, on the point or
syntax, it one learns English good like a President should, you
don’t Change from the active voice (“our nation is accomplishing”)
to the passive voice (‘2 . . than has ever been accomplished") un-
less required to by a great national depression. or a world war.

And finally, What is this about “the nation" accomplishing
something for “its people"? The nation is its people. If he meant
to say that the people at America are accomplishing a great deal
tor the people at America, then that's okay, only hardly worth
saying because it is tautolcgtcal. One cannot retrain irom sus-
pecting that what the President had in mind was “the govern-
mentLthat he meant to say that “the government" is accomplish-
ing more tor the people.

whereupon one objects: but THE GOVERNMENT isn't THE
NATION. And don‘t forget Illat, buddy. And tempted moreover
to insist: the people don't belong to the government, so that John<
son should not have referred to the nation’s accomplishing more
tor “its" people.

Let those who Will say that this is nitpicking. I write for those
who care to ponder the President's thought habits, which, ideally,
should be all of the nation's people.

Or consider this: “Surely a nation that can go to the moon
can place a decent home within the reach of its families." Once
again, a statement which, read last, or heard fast, tends to cross
the stage quickly, and disappear into the wings of platitude, But
it is a very foolish thought. In the ﬁrst place, it is a government
that decides whether to go to the moon.

And the way the government gets to the moon is by taking
money from the people which might otherwise have been spent in
building more houses.

It is relentlessly clean that the government of Russia couldn‘t
possibly go to the moon if it permitted the people the freedom to
spend their money as they saw fit, And it is relentlessly clear
that the United States will have fewer house on account of our
decision to go to the moon. _

And again, What is this business about a nation’s “placing" a
decent home within the reach or ”its” (there we go again) iami.
lies? The government has practically nothing to do with houses,
it you consider government-built or subsidized houses as a per
centage of the whole, (Between 1550 and 1960, tree enterprise built
13,000,000 housing units, While the government, net, destroyed
100,000.) The people or America come within reach of houses as
a result of their own exertions, and as a result of the disposition
of other people to save. Whrtt makes it ditiicult ior people to build
their houses is: a) taxes (taken by the government); b) inflation
(caused by the government); and c) restrictive labor union polb
cies (protected by the government.)

Tile most usetul thing the government could do to place de-
oent homes within the reach oi its people, is go away.

And so on. Fortunately, the state or the union is better than
the state oi its President’s mind.
