Widening our perspective

' Tile Scarlet and Black is forming- an editorial board ill
attempt to “iden its perspective, to ploducc from the ct?
forts of several rathcr tllan one, more nlcanillg'ul com—
mental-y on matters of student interest.

, Tile board is not and will not he a closed body — it
\‘ill remain open to any Grillnell student who will give it
1 time.

The “editorial policy" ot' the S&D u ill be determin-

ed, as before. by the editor.

However, space will be provided for any board mem—
ller to present his opinion on any significant matter re-

lrdless of \ihether or not it coincides with that of the
editor or a majority of the board.

Persons currently meeting with the board include
Bruce Porter, Susan Grohs, Ruth Gruenewald, Craig Hell-
6ei'soil, Larry Hoffman, Mike Hal-watt, Vickie Mittlel’ehldt,
Curt Lamb, Barbara Schweuh‘, Sally Singer, Larry Smucke

, and Pete Zwicl

Loard should contact Jim Hatfield, ext. 540.

The cour’r problem

After a full year of operation three areas of basic
problems, three “sore spots" in the student court system.
:re becoming increasingly apparent. Students must honest-

ijl investigate the problems of procedure, personnel and

, lriSdictional distinctions in legal apparatus of the court.
The major problem is procedural. Tlle by-laws of the
courts, both primary and high court, have been written and
rewritten with negli the
court’s handling of cases has (il'lVOllldeel‘lt‘ientS to anger
and caused a confusion for er l'rone concerned that is llll‘
co ducive to an atmosphere 01‘ effective judicial decision.
Procedural inconsistencies have placed the student ill
I disadvantageous position when appearing before the court.
Ignorance and inel iciency in this problem area is making
conducive to all atmosphere of effective judicial decision,
' The personnel “sore spot" is characterized by a kind
of “judicial informality" practiced by the justices outside
the courtroom. Proceeding of the court arevsoinetimes
discussed indiscretely with friends of or the defendants
themselves paralleling the sloppiness within the court
room This does great harm to the prestige of the court
and may render all impartial decision extremely difficult.
In‘flormality is not a luxury in which the court can in-
dulge. l

The problem of court personnel is a thorny one, but
i 5 basis is not in the character of the court justices but
in the peculiar burdens of their office. The outmoded na-
ture 01 some of the rules which must be enforced present
a c is' of conscience on the part of prospective justices
which is hard to resolve holict‘ Who is ”without blame"?
Who can ”cast the first stone“.7

Finally, a distinction must be delinitrely made be
tween the province of college administration jurisdiction

ld student coult jurisdiction. It is becoming clear that
the court will never be completely free of administrative
control, bill the roles of these two elements, the court and
the administration, must be written down.

The unsatisfactory lllodlls operandi now in e'lst'ellcc
must be abandoned; the “rules of the game" have to be
(refined. If the court is to act effectively it must have in-
dependence within its own province. There will be admin,
'st/r tion limits on the court's treedom to act, but these liln-
l s will be set»down and known. The game can then be play
ed accordingly.

First, last dictator
i don't want to make an apolr
ogy of dictatorship here, but it
is necessary to Show that many
dictators have done in some
aspects a good 581 we to their

From 1937 to 1945 this revo-
lutionary leader ruled by de-
tree, but one has to analyze
some or his contradictions,
which we might sup are Latin
American contradictions: he
enacted as a dictator a great
deal of social legislation fnvA

prise coal, iron and steel in-

Sistance. No gun was lired. no
blood shed. in 1950 the then 70
year old dictator was nominated
as candidate to the presidency
and Surpl‘ ingly won with a
large majority of votes. I am
just trying to Show that dicta-
tors are not always hated, and
also have limitations to their
powers, In Latin America no-
body can rule without Complete
support of the Amy, Navy and
All Force, e\en ll regularly
elected. It is sometimes difficult
for the people oi this Country to
realize how and why the Armed
Forces play Such an important
role in LA politics. But the fact
is that they can either oust or
back whoever they want in pow—
er.

Goal; industrialization

The big present goal of any
LA nation is industrialization.
But industrialization is also con-
nected with a lot of problems.
If LA gets suddenly fully indusr
trialized, would not that cause
a depresssion in the U. s. and
Europe? One fact, though, seems
to be true about all LA nations:
if thel is one thing lo be avoidr
ed, h is the status quo. If this
change occurs fast or slowly it
does not seem to mailer. What
really matters is the way it is to
be achieved,

Another tact seems also to
be tru - as m as A gels in-
dustr lizeli there will be less
chance oi communist dictator-
ship. LA nations becoming sell—
sullicienl, providing better
standard of living for their in-
habitniits, the danger of com.
munist autocracy seems to be-
come remote.

When a Latin American looks
at Red China 0)’ Russia, he ﬁnds
some similarity between Soviet
and Chinese leaders and the dice
tutors that they have experience
ed :u home. and the Igenel‘al
goals that they are u- ing to
achieve in China or Russia are
baswally identical to ours. a bet-
ter society The difference lies in
the methods. ii they are how un-

prove that thel v ill not be a

system, as tlle tendencies seem
to indicate. .
