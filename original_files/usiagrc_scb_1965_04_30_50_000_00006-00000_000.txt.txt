Brogan Views Quaint Grinnell

“Grinnell r . . is set in the little
town of Grinnell and is, in tact,
the main and almost only eco-
nomic justification for the exist»
ence of the town." so said Sir
Denis Brogan (now returned to
civilization) about his home for
three months last year.

Brogan authored an article about
(.vl'innell town and college which
was featured in the Feb. 13 issue
of a Glasgow, Scotland, newspa-
per and which round itselr appear
ing in the Grinnell Herald Register
(a “parochial” newspaper, but re-
minding Brogan of the “Rutherv
glen Reformer” of his youth) on
April 15.

The article concluded by claim»
ing that “either Main Street was
not as bad as Sinclair Lewis pre»
tended or it has vastly improved in
the last 40 years.

in reading the feature, the Grin-
nellian is often led to wonder why
Brogan feels there has been any

 

progress, but can only conclude

that what might be taken as criti—
cisms by lowa pioneers are actual-
ly endear-ments to the ruddy gen-
tleman from the Old World

Brogan noted that his proposed
stay in the backwoods probably
caused a stir in the civilized world
and that “sophisticated friends in
Washington or San Francisco or
New York would have been no
more surprised if we had gone to
the Congo than to rural Iowa."

Brogan did have some sympathy
with the college’s primitive archi»
tectural makeup. “The campus
contains buildings of every style,
from the must atrocious Victorian
bogus Romanesque to extremely
elegant modern Bauhaus construc-
Lions."

But-ling library‘s.stock (not the
colonial kind) was Considered good,
“by our (British) standards."

According to Brogan, the col-
lege has antiquated customs re-
garding the sexes. He observed.
“Grinnell segregates them much

more severely than Oxford or Cam-
bridge now do.”

The town itself “is in What the
Americans would call ‘a blind' "
because of the business loss caused
by Interstate 30. Further, “it is
not surprising that they (towns-
people) Ere the main supporters of
Goldwaterism."

And as a tender, understanding
note, Brogan mentioned that “there
were rather touching examples of
the desire to build up the local
‘merchant’ class. Every shop and
store had a label on the door read-
ing either ‘Push for Grinnell’ or
‘Pull lor Grinnell,’ depending on
how the doors opened and shut."

Even the borbarism hasn’t been
removed from the frontier. To be
sure, “there was crime in various
parts of the state, if not in Grine
nell, a good deal or embezzlement,
a good deal of drunkenness ending
in violence and sometimes in
death, a certain amount of hi-
jacking, and even something or the
vice which Macauley optimistical-
ly said ‘satire blushes to name.’ ”

But Brogan held some hope tor
the Midwestern wilderness. The
people, he says, are lriendly, the
Dutch Elm disease hasn’t gotten
to Grinnell yet, the land is prob-
ably as rich as that of East Loth-

Lion and East Anglia, the settlers
, seem remarkably sane in compari-

sion with those of Southern Cali-
fornia, “and the people at lowa
have recently begun the experi-
ment or allowing the sale of spirits
by the drink . . ."

Production of ‘Tea & Sympathy'
Demonstrates Director's Talents

By Don Kurasch

Bruce McConachie is a tal-
ented young man. The presi-
dent oi the Grinnell Players
has previously proved his abil-
ity as an actor, and alter this
week's production of Robert
Anderson's Tea and Sympathy
has shown a deft capacity for
directing.

The most remarkable aspect
of McConachie’s effort was his
handling of the set. The bi-ievel
structure was elaborate, yet
tastefully appropriate, and
made the fullest possible use of
the limited space in Arena The-
atre. But for a few seats on
the side, which were partially
cut oil by a large table lamp.
there were no bad places to sit
within the semicircular ar-
rangement of the audience.

In the roles of Bill and Laura
Reynolds, Howie Harned and
Georgia Mickey worked well
together, The irreconcilable
conflict between the two was
clear—Hamed as the unyield-
ing schoolmaster, afraid that
the “queerness” he thought he
saw in one of his students might
be part of his own nature, and
Miss Mickey as the sympathec
ic Wife who understood her hus-
band, but who was unable to
penetrate the shell he had
drawn over himself. Perhaps

 

Harned could have varied the
delivery of his lines some, and
have come out a little less one-
dimensiunal, and Miss Mickey
might have tried letting her
arms leave her sides occasion—
ally, but in general the two
were strong, and periodically
dramatic.

As the unjustly accused Ton-i
Lee, Dan Burns came across
as the sensitive, misunderstood
student. Though there may have
been some difficulty in deter-
mining how much of the ob-
vious nervousness was Eurns',
and how much was part of the
characterization, he did suc—
ceed in creating a feeling of
general sympathy with his
problems.

The two most consistent and
effective characters in the play
were Lilly Sears, played by
Judy Ginsberg, and Al, played
by Dan Mason. Miss Ginsberg
made the most other small part
as the tastefully vivacious flirt,
and Mason was perfect as the
rocky, understanding room-
mate.

There were a few lines
“dropped," a few “thrown
away,” and several technical
fluffs, but overall, the play
was very enjoyable And the
producing and directing job by
McConachie was truly note-
worthy.
