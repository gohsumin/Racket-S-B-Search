Certain assumptions about sltis

administrator should he made.
Student government is a form
of government which is unique
to ’1he college community. its
major function is the solving of
particular problems in the most
cfficicnt manner. Tire student
must be able to establish freely
his own individual patterns of
bchavior, The student adminis—
trator must attempt to avoid the
excess bureaucratic trivia in
which we are all too often lma
incised.

S Ludcn L government will
have accomplished its goal if
it ﬁrst deals with immediate
problems in a Sensible and ef-
ficient Wily, and second, if it

makes of itself a responsible ‘

Tire orientation program, with
vccl‘taln few restrictions, and the
‘oniol‘cemcnt problems should be
‘left up to the individual halls as
‘mu: as possible. The CofHP, it.
self, would then be primarily a
group of hall enforcement offi-
cers who would formulaic in gen-
eral terms common policy.

3. in order to iinplciiicnt the
court structure of the new cnns
situation the CoflIP must work
closely ivitnlhe courts in lor-

conception that the Col“?
