The march was soon joined by a
number at “floats." One consisted of
three, huge, grlmucing skeletons. On
another was written the words, “This
Is the portrait of people who let women
And children be burned,” The portrait
was a mirror.

In a truck with loudspeakers folk-
linger Pete Seeger led about 100 young
ohildren singing peace songs. A sign
on the truck said, “Children are not for
burning."

Though there were a large number at
older people, the majority or the march-
ers were of college age, So were the
pro-war protesters A group or about lilo
teenagers, members or the Neo-Nazi
American Renaissance Party, ranged
up and down the sidewalks shouting in-
sults at the marchers, and “Better
dead than Red." They all carried A-
merican flags. Their leader, who was
carried in tha air, wore an American
flag in place at a shirt.

Many of the peace demonstrators
carried signs as they marched—some
printed, some original — “Slop the
Bombing," “Bring Home the Troops—
Now," “War Veterans for Peace,” No
More Veterans," “LBJ (limited Vietna-
mese History," “Black People, so per-
cent Dead — 2 per cent of the Bread,
“Nu Vietnamese Ever Called me Nig-
ger," “Burn Pot, not People," ”Love
No ” “Wipe Out Poverty Not Petr
pie," Bobby (Kennedy) Would Try,"
“Be," “The First Casualty of War is
,Truth.“

Though most of the marchers walked
Illently, a highly vocal minority chant-

ed slogans and sang songs. The invar-
ite slogan was “PeaceNow,” repeated
over and over again. When the prowar
demonstrators yelled from the sidewalk,
the marchers drowned them out with
this my

Some of the more prevalent chants
were: “Hey, hey LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today; ” “l, 2, 3, 4, 5- bring
the troops horns alive," and “Hell no,
we won’t go.”

When the march passed the arch-dio-
cese of New York, the cry wan
raised, “Cardinal Spellman, stop bless<
lng bombs," Spellman had previously
endorsed the war in Vietnam.

There was no major violenco during
the march. though there were a num<
ber of minor incidents. As the marchers
passed down Park Avenue, paint and
bags of plaster were thrown down tram
skyscrapers. No one was seriously hurt.
Later, eggs were thrown at the march-
ers.

Prowar spectators on the sidewalks
heckled the marchers as they passed
by. The comments ranged: “Traitors,"
“Commies,” “Queers," “Kill em with
a machine gun.”

Late in the march, a contingent of
Harlem Negroes lncludlng Floyd McKis-
Sick 0! CORE, broke down police barri-
Caries and left the march, shouting Slo-
gans and disrupting iraiiic.

Probably the most conspicuous peo-
ple at the march were Iho hippies.

Dean Strauss, a 1936 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate or Grinnell, speaking to the
question “can the Liberal Arts College
Survive?”, discussed the ability or
small, private baccalaureate colleges to
maintain or high quality education, not
their ability to avoid extinction.

Stauss said that the most pressing
problem threatening the retention at
high quality education in the liberal arts
college is the dualistic characterlzation or
its goals. it must be both a liberal arts
and a prcpmiessional college.

In the past, the emphasis on prepro-
fessional training was not so great and
the demands were easily met. Presently,
the demands are vigorous and the pit-
ialls oi the dualism have become appap
ent. Dean stauss predicted that this
inability to cope with the dualism would
eventually lead to “a pluralistic, sprawl-
lng curriculum . . . a headstart theory
or pre-pmlesslonnl specialization without
a well-developed, Viable rationals of

what the uollege can do in this area
that the graduate school will not do, A
random neglect of patterns of under
graduate education in the major field,
and only modest attention to . . . general
education in the arts and sciences; and
this modest attention limited mainly to
the structure and content or the general
requiremeniu ior graduation." Thin
leads to a general education that pro-
duces intelligent amateurs, which falls
short u! the ideal “tree but responsible
mind.”

A truly liberal education emphasizes
three prime commitments of the indivi<
dual: “to humane understanding, to in-
formed and responsible citizenship, to
sophlstlcated entertainment or himseli
and his friends." Proficiency toward ah
iaining these commitments Is “an in.
dispensable condition of survival: but
not a static condition, as the ideal is not
static. For let us recall, with Justice
Holmes, that ‘the present has a right
to govern itself so far as it can; and it
ought to be remembered that historic
continuity with the past Is not a duty,
It is only a necessity.’ . . r But the ‘lib‘

gel'al' college must do more: it must

speak to the restless, freedom-conscious
temper or man; to his tastes for human
dignity. irccdom, and responsibility. It
must urge vital attention to the relevant
moral concerns and judgments ex-
pressed by the ‘humane past' and tho
‘hiimane present.‘ These, too, are pow
