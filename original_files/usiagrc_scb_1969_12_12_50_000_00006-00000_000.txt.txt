themselves and men with
legitimate demands A woman
who cannot, by virtue other sex,
get a good job or salary. who
cannot safely prevent the birth of
an unwanted child, who cannot
leave or afford to leave her
children in a desirable atmos»
pliere while she works is forced

And by this situation Mr. Finley’s
cartoon women are spawned.

l have greatly oversimplified
many complex problems, but
there is one final matter that
concerns me. Women are in
many cases their own worst
enemies. It is not easy to be a
career woman and a wife and
mother simultaneously. Time is
short and the emotional demands
are great. Most women, Wltll a
tow regrets, quit their jobs when
they marry or have babies, and
employers are understandably
suspicious, particularly of young
women. Again, a woman looking
lor part , time work, who is
concerned primarily with getting
out ot the house or earning a little
extra money, cannot expect an
absorbing position or a
competitive salary.

The double pull is always there
A woman cannot deny her
biological identity Witll all other
women, but she must not deny
her emotional and intellectual
individuality. It is not a new
woman who is being born, but a
woman who understands herself
betler.

as “women’s liberation". This
type or behavior in women has
become widespread and now I’m
afraid that American men expect
their women to be tough, callous,
protane, sloppy, competitive,
insensitive and unemotional:
which causes them to treat us in a
iiidclicatc manner, perpetrating
our insensitivity, which is quite a

To the Editor:

Sally Moore's Declaration is a
hopcful article for more freedom
[or women in society. l-Ier come
ments about life in the home,
huwvvt" sound more tyrannical
than “liberated,” Does liberation
mean that one lives only for one-
self? The woman who
“demands" to have homelile
exactly the way she wants it to be
seems to miss the whole point of
equality. Is she promoting a
constructive equality o1 mutual
respect, or is it really iciiunine
tyranny that evolves? Both
partners in a marriage must
cooperate, not only the man.

Mrs. Moore speaks ot raising
children as “free individuals.”
Does her type oi t'reedom there
also say, “Thou shalt not wash
dishes, daughter, thou shalt not
prepare thyselr to become a good
wile 7 thou shalt be
LIBERATED!” is that freedom?

If Mrs. Moore reels home lite is
a “chore,” then by all means she
should get away trom it as much
as she can. But it is not true that 1
am not a liberated woman
because i enjoy cooking,
sometimes do more than hall the
housework and sometimes less
without demanding my rights
like a spoiled child. Education
brings me the stimulation or
intellectual liberation, What an
opportunity to have a husband to
share ideas with and to learn
tram the ideas he brings to our
relationship as well: Does it
really matter all that much who

The article Five Hundred
Dollar Theit During Sweetivatei-
Concert which appeared in the
Nov. 21 $81“, was in general a fair
and accurate account of that’
uiiloriunutc occurrence But it
was marred by a glaring error
wllich I think needs to be
corrected.

Your rcportcr mentions “the
normal two policemen outside
Darby to kcep ‘outsiders' out or
the dance.” It is true that there
were two auxiliary policemen
Outside of Darby, as there usually
are for concerts and dances
there, hilt they were there [or onc
purpose only: to supervise
parking. lt is neither the desire
nor the policy of the Soctal
Coordinating Committee to keep
anybody out ol events in Darby.
There is ample space in the gym
and it makes no sense to keep
people out justbecause they don‘t
go to school here The BB. King
and Pete Sccgcr concerts were
both attended by many so-called
”outsiders." as was the
Sweetwatcr concert, Everyone is
welcome to these Darby
programs.

The thefts of the night of the
15th have madc it obvious tiiat.
whether we like it or not, it is
necessary to have some kind of
security at these events to pro
Vent the recurrence of such
incidents Blit the word
“security” is in no way
synonymous with keeping people
out, although this assumption is

To the Editor:

It is time for us to outlaw the
use of DDT in Iowa. The
contamination by pesticides was
determined to be worldwide six
years ago When scientists went
to Antarctica, they disccvcrcd
residues of DDT in many
penguins, seals, and sea birds,
Yet the nearest use or pesticides
was thousands of miles away:

How did it get so iar‘l‘ DDT
takes years to break down
chemically, it is also very
mobile, beingable to travel in the
atmosphere and through the seas
quickly,

it has already done damage to
wildlife and to fresh \vatertish, It
has also begun to destroy and
contaminate great quantities ot
the tiny green ocean plants,
which are a very important link
in tlic lood chain. serving as lood
tor lisli. which eventually scrve
as load for man. Ocean fish are
rapidly becoming contaminated
lrom eating fish and plant lile
containing DDT. A prominent
ecologist recently predicted the
and ot the oceans as a signiiicant
source of life and food in only ten
years. iipi-escnt trends continue.
He predicted mass starvation

Why do we need DDT? It has
been proven that an integrated
pest control program will be
safer, just as effective, and much
less costly. This type or program
relies upon beneiieial predator
insects, with limited use of some
chemicals, In California the Cost
01 pest control with strong
chemicals on alfalfa was 12
million dollars a year. but today,
with integrated pest control, it is
only 3 million dollars, with
almost no pest problem
remaining. A similar result was
obtained on the California cotton
crop Wouldn't such a program
make sense in Iowa?

Some states have already
banned DDT. litany lowans,
including some state lawmakers,
are calling for it to be outlawed
here, and tor a through study of
other strong chemical pesticides.

it is true that we are using
much less DDT in Iowa now lllan
in past years. but we still have it,
and did use it on the recent army
worm problem. All use of it
should be stopped.

What can we do? We can write
to our state lawmakers, to
newspapers. and to our governor

We could plan a statewide
moratorium on pesticides, and
pollution in general; plans tor a
national moratorium on pollution
are no being made.

NOW that the use of DDT is
decreasing in Iowa, let’s ban it
completely. I am e lowa
