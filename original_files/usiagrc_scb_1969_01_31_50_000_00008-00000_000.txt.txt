Dems. Reconvene

0n the weekend of January 25th and
26th, Mr. Gilmour, Mika Siegel, and Tod
Friedlander participated in a conference
held in Iowa City to develop a blueprint
for the future of the Iowa Democratic
Party. The conference was attended by
about eighty of the state's leading Demo-
crats — including err-governor Bob Ful-
ton, err—treasurer Paul Franzenhurg,
.Congressman John Culver, and legisla-
tive leaders Bill Gannon and Andrew
Frommelt.

The party is usually considered as
part of "the Establishment." however
Democrats of all viewpoints were ill-
vited to take part in the review of the
party, and the young "radical liberals"
were given an equal voice. At the close
of the conference, those unending were
dlvided into general area task forces in
which they are to propose specific rec-
ommendations for change, and justifi-
cations for them.

I found cause for both hope and dis-
may in the conference. Thu hope lies in
the fact that the conference was called
and more will follow, and in the strong
possibility that many needed and help-
ful changes will be instituted. The dis-
may arises from the bulit»in limitations
of the conference: the young, the Black,
and the poor are not party “leaders."
More representatives of these groups
should be present to mold the party into
a more meaningful and relevant spokes-
man for the people of this country.

Indian Seeks
C.O. Siaius

San Francisco (CPS) — when he was
drafted, Donald H. Britsie, a Navajo
youth, wrote his draft board, “I am an
American Indian. I do not want to be
draft .”

Eleven months later he went on trial
in a court here, pleading that a iooyear-
old treaty between the Navajo nation and
the United States says the Indians “will
never kill or scalp white men nor at«
tempt to do them harm."

Hritsie also said he is a follower of the
Great Spirit, who teaches that men
should not kill other men, and thus is
entitled to conscientious objector status.
“That is the way i live," he said.

But an ail-white jury convicted Britsie
Di induction refusal. He will be sentenced
next month by Judge Lloyd Burke, who
seemed to be troubled by the jury’s ver-
dict. “There were some peculiar cir-
cumstances, not usually encountered, in
this case," he said. “The verdict proba-
bly reﬂects the dtnitude of the community
as a whole."

Do You Lead a Dog's Life?

By LEE MARIE

There are three distinct types or Grin-
nell dogs, the town dog. the college dog.
and the import. I will focus my attention
on the latter two, with the specific in-
tention that the average student often
ignores the indigenous variety in favor of
the educated outsider and the ambitious
insider. By no means do I mean to of-
fend the town dog, it is merely that. I
teel that a detailed description is not
within the scope or intent of this article.
The dog which you might see before
you playing in the snow is not there by
chance. Rather, one might say. he is
predestined by his superior environment
and innate intelligence. Born of middle
or upper-middle class parents. he now
turaiiy gravitate: toward non-athletic.
intellectual endeavors. He spends his
early childhood not as a car-chaser, but
as a time-motion expert. He is interested
in the shoe as an aesthetic piece or leath-
er whose function varies with its owner.
Sam the dog is a typical example. Ai-
lensted from his peers, disowned by his
family, he finds peace and solace in the

NUDES NEEDED

By JONATHAN STEIN

"nlalt they were naked —- and they
were ashamed." How did it come to
Pass that this r-qnnber sound himself
sitting in an art class drawing a retty
young thing who was dressed in ack~
lace leotards, knee-high black boots, and
holding a braided whip?

It should be noted at this point that the
reporter thought he attended a small it-
beraiarte college, not a seminary.

Why can't art classes use nude models
for figures studies? What objections will
be raised it an ant student wishes to
study the beauty or the human form?

Perhaps our Public Relations Dept.
will tear destruction o! town-student,
student-teacher, teacher—town, strident-
studellt, and many other relationships.
Our “Morals" Dept. will surely be ill-
fiamEd. This reporter asked himself how
he would feel ii, while standing in a din-
ner-line. a girl he had been drawing only
a few hours before. came up to him and
tried to cut in line. These and other obs
jecbions, of questionable validity, will be
used to raoionalize the lack of nude
models. However, even if the model must
be imported from out of town and the
college spend a few extra dollars, nothing
can justify the graduation oi an art
major without exposure to this tor-m of
art.

Just think: Had there been nude mod
els in 1960. the open dorm issue might
never have arisen.

isolation which Grinneli College offers.
He is seldom hungry, he beneﬁts enor-
mously from the library (much the same
as a contact high), and he is a confirmed
user of the Barber Plaza ice rink ("YeahI
I skate, what's it to you?"). He corn.

you can eat all the vegetables you want. .

This reporter found it very hard to in.
terview the import. Seldom to be found
in class. in forum garbage cans, or the
newspaper rack in the library, this
unique type of dog prelers to remain in
his oft~campus dwelling. Beulah the dog,
however, was an exception. I found hes.
unite a conversationulist and although it
took several beers before she loosened
up, it was worth the effort. Beulah comes
to us from Oklahoman she still remem-
bers dustbowl times when her parentsI
so she was told, were niten mistaken foe
rabbits. Such experiences have intense
tied her desire to “improve her mind"
and “get ahead" in the real world. She
ll very glad she is at Grinneil and. be- :
ﬂavor that “what Grinne'll can offer I
serious student" should not be tam
lightly. Although Beulah seldom comes
on campus during the day, she does
make it to the Lenox concertS. "especio
ally now that they're leaving." About
school in general she replied, “If they're
going to act ‘ln loco parentir.’ then
why don’t they cook like my mother?"
Her relations with town dogs worry hen
but while she finds it very hard to come
munlcate. "i find that they're dogs like
everyone else."

No story would he complete without a
conclusion, so in conclusion I find it aps'
proprlate to quote the oldest dog east
or the Mississippi. Questionil "Do you
find being a dog at Grinneli personally
satisfying?" Answerl “Well, to tell you
the truth, it's not paradise lost."
