Religion Discussion Plagued
By Failure in Definition

ByJaiietsinith

The Board of Religion this
week brought to the campus
tliree seminarians, holding
radically different theological
views, Sunday, April 5 the topic
of discussion was “theology and
the Community". Allan
Wallerstadt, the moderator,
valiently attempted to suggest
the necessity for a working
definition of community. The
issue was never resolved and
plagued the sessions (attended
by less than 30 students) both
evenings

Each participant presented a
short talk on their personal
religious views and relations to
their community. James Moore
of Trinity Evangelical Divinity
School, Deeriield, lliinois, sup-
ported the “classical protestant
orthodoxy, preached in the 19th
century evangelical revivals”,
feeling confident that his con-
viction spoke for his school, a
tight-knit community. He was
especially concerned about the
alienation of today‘s youth and
saw a need for a new faith, the
faith “[0qu by Luther." He
maintained “For modern man
attempting to remake himself
and his world, the Christian
answer holds great promise:
when you cannot overcome your
condition, God can."

Ted Means of United-Tiler
ologicai Seminary of the Twin
Cities stressed the diversity of
views held at United and 8m-
phasized the tenacity of his own
position. Presently, he was
questioning the G. o. F. values
he grew up with and reinforced
by his near “monastic” un-
dergraduate years at Cornell
College, He does not accept the
divmity of Christ but considered

him a model after which to
pattern his life, a statement'

which caused several to question
his “Christianity,"

Monday evening the program
was entitled ”Theology and
College”, All in some way ad—
vocated structural changes
within the university and saw
major faults in .the Grinnell
community. Jim suggested the
college provide students with
“defined local centers of learning
among which they must choose
and arrange their experiences”.
These would be “nan-fraternities
and neo-sororities 7 each having
its guiding philosophy, its
curriculum, and its student7
faculty steering committee." Ted
delineated the characteristics of
a community, emphasizing ops
enness and trust and formulation
of decisions by the community
as a whole. Grinnell is not a come
munity in that itis a hierarchical
structure, and doesn’t allow
adequate individual freedom.

Stephen Mallingcr of Hebrew
Union Collegertlewish institute of
Religionﬂincinnatl, Ohio, defined
his community as that of all

Jews, stressing the impossibility
of losing one's Jewishness. “Once
a Jew, always a Jew", if only
hy Virtue of circumcision. He‘
acknowledged that it is a little
more difficult to join the Jewish
community, for a convert must
be accepted by the entire com-
munity. '

Well, the theologians got down
off their pedestal and the
discussion rapidly degenerated
into a bull session. Personal
gripes and dissatisfactions about
the educational processes and
Grinnell community were aired,
The words God and' theology
disappeared for the rest of the
evening.

The program’s purposes may
have been accomplished by
exposing the seminarians to
Grinnell College and the Grin-
iiellians to students with a
theological background, through
individual meetings, Theology,
however. was not examined
during the panels. One par-
ticipant evaluated the panels as
"abortions, theologically
speaking." I am inclined to
agree.

And Leggett's idea that . .the
committee’s offer to Wilhelm did
not involve censorship since the
committee was publisher, and a
“publisher cannot censor his own
material" is a typical of
Leggett's doublertalk northink
attitude toward students and
young people in general.

Back when
censored, I tried to deal with the
situation with reason and an
appeal to legal andethical notions
of what is right That all failed
if the same situation occurred
now, lwould probably use other
methods of dealing with it. Like
many young people in Amerika,
I’m getting pretty mad. Like
Johnny Cash‘s song about “What
is Right," the Judge looked down
at the long-haired youth and
didn't hear a word he said. We’ve
had enough of this crap.

To the editors of the Scarlet and
Black:

Regardless of the merits of
giving Herbie Hancock an
honorary degree tronn Grinnell,
the 5&8 editors should do a bit
more research and get the true
facts before they begin to
editoi‘ialize.

First, The Concerned Black
Students did not invite Mr,

Concerts Committee and the
Social Coordinating Committee,
along with the AfrorAmeriCan
Cultural Affairs Committee in-
vited Mr. Hancock. it was pure
co-incidencc that he came on
April ith, Black Martyrs' Day.
He did himself express an inn
tel‘est in talking with Black
students, having been a Black
student at Grinnell, alter having
accepted the engagement at
Gi'innell.

Second, The Concerned Black
Students did not propose to
anyone that Mr, Hancock receive
an honorary degree. So whatever
“minority” you feel the laculty
is pandering to, it is not the
Concerned Black Students as you
haveimplicd.

DcarSlr:

Your last issue’s editorial on
Milovan Djilas aborted visit here
was surely one of your silliest
emotional outbursts, unless, of
course, it was a cynical attempt
to influence logically and
politically underdeveloped
younger students with specious
politicalargument.

The demand that liberals and
radical leftists balance (and
weaken) their criticisms of
American society and foreign
policy with devotion of equal time
to ritualistic denunciation of
Communist governments abroad
is 'a hoary old reactionary
campaign tactic. How many
reactionaries devote equal time
to denouncing rightist military
coups abroad, genocide in In-
donesia, racism in South Africa
and Rhodesia, and the much
worse and more consistent
violations oihuman rights among
our policerstate allies in general?

The typical reactionary cons
ccpt oi civics seems to he that
people should be more concerned
with tyranny in Siberia, sup-
pression of religion in Mongolia,
or frightening quotations (often
piionyt from Lenin or Mao than
with problems of American
foreign or domestic policy that
our right to vote (hopefully at
eighteen) and payment of taxes
should logically make more vital
tous.

Tuesday Night allhe Movies:
The 'Old Senaie' Bows Out

By TOM GREENFIELD

I took on this column originally
because i have nothing to do on
Tuesday nigiits. However, this
past week presented me with a
crisis This week's meeting 7 the
last meeting of the old Senate
7 fell on the same night as the
academy award presentations

It just wouldn'tseem like April
if i didn‘t turn on a tube and
hear John Wayne say “I’m John
Wayne. I work with my clothes
on.“ Dismayed at the possibility
of missing one of my top favorite
spring rituals, i searched the
campus for a solution.

My dilemma was finally solved
by “Big Bertha," Bob
Euygenliausen’s 24 ounce, 2 inch
transistorized television set.

i marched into the Senate
meeting with Bertha at my side.
Setting myself up behind the
Senate table, 1 cast one eye to
the Senate and one eye to the
stars. My report of the evenings’
observations follows,

9:30. Phil Mears, a spokesman
for the student power steering
committee, moves ,to open up a
general assembly of all present
to discuss the ramifications of the
committee‘s revolutionary
:eport, Glen Campbell sings the
theme song to “True Grit."

9:45, Students discuss the
relative merits of the per
formances of the present
Educational Policy Committee,
Johnnie Green’s orchestra plays
an exerpt from the score oi “The
Sterile Cuckoo." «

lu:litt, Mickey Schaalman says
“You have to have a body with
the institutional principle."
Racqucl Weleh presents the
oscar for visual effects to
“Marrooned,”

10:15, Questions on the value
of the whole effort are raised
Bruce Nissen explains some of
the complexities of the steering
committee's report to skeptical
and confused students. “in the

nomination to “Love of Life."

lll::i0. Julie Szabo reads the
text of somebody’s friendly
amendment to something. “Hello
Dolly” wins for best achievement
insound.

10:45, Problems arise as
students seek to articulate the
faculty position on a few
technical points. Mr. Gregory
Guroll' ihistoryt rises to clarify
the faculty philosophy. John
Wayne wins best actor award.

”:00, Students are having
trouble understanding much of
the vague wording in the Steering
Committee document. Phil
Mears and Mickey Schaalman
are kept busy clarifying the
‘muny semantic questions of their
paper. ”Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid" wins for best
writing.

ll:ls,After onehourand fortyr
ive minutes of debate, Andy

tnd to the discussion. George
Iessel receives a citation for

lists, Jon Stein reports on the
progress of the committee to
determine new closing hours for
he Forum, Jon announces that
students “sat-in" at the Forum
until «i AM. Jon explained that
:his “sit-in” was precipitated by
M , Hawk‘s longtime unr
wi ngness to budge on the 12-
12:30 closing times. Apparently
several appeals to Mrs. i-iawk
have yielded no progress at all
in the Forum policy. The best
picture award goes to “Midnight
Cowboy.”
