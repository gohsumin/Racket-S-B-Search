Pfiisch Mourns-Soccer Void:
Blames Disinferest. Finances

By DICK CHADY

There was no soccer team this
year because Grinneli apparently
lacks the players, the coach, and
the money to support one,

In a recent interview, Direcwr
of Athletics John Ptitsch explains
ed the combination of factors that
led the department to curtail the
sport in 1965.

In the first place, “we didn't
have the kind or interest to rein-
force meshalf into thinking of the
program as a going concern."
Turn-out tor the team was high
when Grinnoll began the sport in
1961, but with succeeding years
“it became more 01' a struggle to
get numbers to participate,"

Ptitsch speculated that interest
may have been higher in the tirsi
years because of a number or stu-
dents from the East who had
played before,

However, last year a freshman
team could not be filled, and part
of the varsity was recruited by
coach Simone 1mm his swimming
team. This year Simone is on
leave, and another coach would
have to be found,

The decrease in playerrinterat
and Simone's absence both occur-
red at a time when a reduced
athletic budget dictated a reduc-
tion in activities.

When the department received
a cut of about $1400, it was de-
cided to restrict activities in one
area, instead of aCrDSSvthstaYd,

psrtment submitted its budget to
the college last spring, no pn)
vision was made for a soccer
team.

This year an unofficial ciuﬂ
was organized, with Fred Miller
and AI Rossman as cocaptains.
Eighteen players turned out for
regular practices and paid their
transportation tor two “away”
games at lower and SCI,

Previous Grinnell teams had at
compete wiLh eiLher the very good
or the very bad. Sorne schools
such as WheatDn, MaoMurray, and
Lake Forest had well-established
programs in the sport, while most
of the Iowa schools maintained on,-
ly clubs.

Dirk Baay, who was a part-
time coach and reieree tor the
Club this year, feels “it was a
had time tor us to drop out." He
said that there is a growing in»
latest in soccer and that four or
ﬁve schools in the Midwest Con—
ference now have teams.

Baay noted that even with I
rough schedule, the Pioneers had
a record of 22-7-1 in four years
or competition. He believes that
ii the sport is re-instituted on a
team basis there will be Suiltcient
interest to maintain a good pro-
gram.

Pfltsch said he also favors “a
broad program" and that the
primary reason for the lack of a
team is ﬁnancial. But he also
feels that. a successful team will
require "a teal promoter to re
criiit players."
