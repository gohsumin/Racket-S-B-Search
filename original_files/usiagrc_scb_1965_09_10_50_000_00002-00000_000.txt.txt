2-8 is the magic numbcr-punctuation—letter com-i
hination that makes any personal contact with the Viet
Nam war needless.

A new president promises he will be the president
3 a comforting thought for those who find personal
initiative too hard to take.

The 5&3 is no longer a repository for scatology.

The Albert Schweitzer Society is as close as any
Grinnellian need get to empathizing with humanitarian
work.

The new science building addition soothes our
fears that Grinnell was not meeting recent and rapid
advances in science —« and architecture.

This year’s freshmen were so well pro-adapted to
college life that they have survived even the stigma of
I peculiar graduation date.

Cries of student tumult that have sprung through
the country don’t seem to be in phase with the Grinnell
lituation.

The rules of the college are acceptable,

The student government is having little difficulty.
The campus is pretty.

The quad is safely locked. inside and out.

The Forum has been accepted.

Perhaps only Langan basement holds out against
‘he ascension of complete bliss, and maybe even that
problem will have a solution following next weekend’s
encampment.

But it is nice to be back, isn't it?

This year the Forum is presenting a series of
ﬁlms that will be shown every Monday night at
10-30 in the South Lounge beginning Sept. 13.
They Wlll be (thus by independent American
rum-makers within the last twenty years. These
ﬁlms. unlike the Commercial Hollywood movies,
are short. do not necessarily follow a dramatic
plot line, and are experimental Ill that the film-
maker are exploring the infinile and complex
possibi ties oi him as an art form.

Film. as an art form, has long been ignored
in this country With the advent of Sound and tech-
nical improvements and advancements, movie
makers slrived to make ﬁlm record llfe exactly
as one sees it. Movies, unlike plays, could be
distributed and shown all over the country more
easily and less expensively. The profits to be
gained from this enterprise were great, for
mDVleS became the entertainment for and a
habit or the general public. Because of the large
protits involved. move makers could make more
elaborate productions that necessarlly catered to
the taste of the masses. From this we have the
growth of Hollywood and the star system,

The big business approach to moviemaking
in this country kept film from being realized as
an art form by serious appreciators and palrnns
of the traditional artsr Until recently American
universities have not recognized ﬁlm in the
classroom except for documentary and instruc-
tive purposes. or in their cultural programs ex-
cept as an entertaining Saturday night way of
relaxation.

The serious filmmaker has had to light for
recognition as an artist and support (rpm the
intellectuals and art lovers. They have bad to
struggle against the economic dynasty and the
gross image and concept of what him-making is
that Hollywood has built up. They have had to be
content with a minute audience for their work.
The influential critics barely acknowledge the
progress of avant garde filmmakers. The experi-
mental film-maker has had to work with a low
budget. which does have some advantages. For
instance. he doesn't have to worry about his lilm

being a commercial success — it‘s not intended
lo be. He does the creating, planning. filming.
and editing himself, so he doesn't have [0 com-
promise his al'llSUC sense in order to please the
important box office producers, stars, and movie
companies,

European experimental films have achieved
a certain status as art in this country, Hope-
luliy. this success will change Ille attitude of the
American public and the critics toward (llm,
Many universities. such as NYU, Yale. and Dark
mouth. are offering courses in film technique and
production and film appreciation. More and more
film festivals feature works of the American
avant garde ﬁlmmakers.

defining his art form. for truly film is the an of
the 20th century. The possibilities oi the medhim
are Vast and already dislinct schools of ﬁlm are
developing. The camera can serve as a subjec-
tive eye seeking particulars in order to empha<
size their beauty or slgnificance to the universe,
or it can serve as a stationary objective Viewer
of life and nature.

Film poetry utilizes visual imagery and sym-
bollsm. Editing and the speed of action of camera
and object give film rhythm. The restrictions of
the rectangular image and the two dimensional
picture give film a discipline which film-makers
use to the advantage of their an. Leaps in time
are possible in fllm. In (his way film is like the
mind w while remaining always in the present.
it can dwell on the past and future all in a mat-
ler of seconds. A soundtrack can be used to con-
flict, contrast. 01' harmonize with the Visual
image. The use of color or black and white or
the combination ol the two adds yet another
dimension m the fllm~makers' art.

The Forum lilm program will cover a variety
of [ilmrmakers Who have explored and created
new ways of using him. Movmg-going is a habit
that we have all grown up with. These films make
us more aware of the art and technique we have
been watching for years. Like all art. they should
make us more perceptive to and conscious or our
own lives and the World around usr
