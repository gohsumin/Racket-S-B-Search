Chino Turmoil ls Progress: Hinton

By Harold Fuson

Eeset by the inequities of dry
weather, Pennsylvania farmer
William Hinton took time oil
iron: his regular chores this
winter to, in his words, “or-
range some turbulence in China
to give me a platform from
which to speak,” and set oil on
n speaking tour to discuss the
“Cultural Revolution in Chi<
ha,”

The turbulence was no diifi-
cult matter for Hinton to are
range since, as he pointed out
in his talk to a lull South
Lounge on Monday night, “Sen-
ator Eastiand in 1956 proved in
a three hour speech to the Sen-
ate that I had singlehandedly
organized the Communist take-
over oi China.”

Mr. Hinton himself spent two
and a half hours, mostly de-
voted to answering student
questions, giving what he
called a positive view of the
cultural revolution. “China,"
Hinton maintains, “is at a turn-
ing point — a decade of transi«
tion."

The turbulence now taking
place has grown out of the ex-
pulsion or the old commercial
classes from the Chinese ruling
alliance, and represents a liter
tural transition to the next

stage of the Chinese Socialist
revolution. The revolution, ac-
cording to Hinton, began in the
1340': with the ﬁrst attempts
to overthrow Chinese feudalism
and expel foreign influence.

This first stage was not com-
pleted until 1949, when Mao Tse
Tong led an alliance of work-
ers, intellectuals and commer-
cial classes in overthrowing
Chisng Kai lhek’s Kuomintang
regime.

The expulsion oi the commer-
cial classes thus represents the
next stage in completing the so
oialist Evolution. In Hinton’i
well»iniormed but openly Marx-

ist View, the turbulence now
taking place is not only pre-
dictable but absolutely neces-
sary. Moreover, it is not to be
interpreted as a weakening or
Mao’s grip on power, but as
yet another or the “waves in
which he has transformed
China."

Hinton, who speaks from a
broad background of research
and experience, has just pub-
lished a book describing his ex-
periences in China in the early
iilties, Fanshen, A Documem
tary of Revolution in s Chinese
Village.

Hinton first went to China as
a newspaperman in 1937. Eight
years later he returned as a
propaganda analyst {or the (1.5.
