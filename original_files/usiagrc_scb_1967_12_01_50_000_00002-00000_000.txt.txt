TUITION INCREASE

Tuition has increased again — this time by 5200 —— and it is
assumed students will exhibit the usual aversive action.

And, if things renew the usual pattern, you will probably find
discussions or “guaranteed tuition” plans going on in the halls, the
Forum grill, the lunch and dinner lines.

“Guaranteed tuition” means that students are guaranteed as
freshmen that their room, board, tuition and fee charges will be
the same for all of their four years at school. Several colleges and
universities have such plans, and quite a few more have proposed
them.

The trouble with “guaranteed tuition” is that administrators,
who of course have to meet operational costs. tend to figure up
what costs will be over all {our years (these costs usually increase
substantially each year) and divide by iour. The iigure for the
ireshman year tends to be higher under “guaranteed tuition" than
it would be under the status quo of a place like Grinnell.

As Dean James Stauss told the 5&3: “Such “guaranteed tui-
tion" plans iavor only students who graduate — those who spend
four iull years here — while other students (those who may trans-
ier) have to pay more than they would have for each of their years
here"

But if guaranteed tuition is not desirable for a place like Grin»
hell, it seems the administration in its catalogue and other publb
cations to prospective or entering students might emphasize that
costs do increase each year and that tuition has been increasing
accordingly,

The catalogue tells us that the administration reserves the
right to raise tuition and fees and room and board charges. But
what it doesn't tell is that it is almost certain that Grinnell tuition
will increase every year ilottzoil. it it did, when tuition did in-
crease, at least it wouldn't be totally unexpected and it. wouldn’t
be the tragedy it always seems.

i was distressed by your let-

wrong or round my insight lack-

point so completely. I am sure
the fault lies in my rhetoric, but
perhaps li you had read my
article more careiully, my
meaning would have become
more clean

Your answer directed itseli
to the attitude of mine that the

subculture is undesirable. You
showed that (l) the subculture
ls very limited, (2) is under
great pressure irom the Grin-

in fact, extremely desirable, {or

All MAL BEHAIIIOUII

By Neil Fischer

Three things are for sure and certain at Grinnell - Mr. CNS-
sett drives a While Valiant; President Leggett smokes True timer
and the Coil-1P president stays at Senate meetings precisely one
hour, whereupon he turns into a pumpkin

Actually the last item is Ihe most certain — as vermin u
the present student government is nominally Omnipotent and
notably impotent.

In iact, I suggest you all go to a Senate meeting (just one”?
they're very interesting, very enlightening, very Grinnellt

Take this Wednesday's meeting for example, and take an ex-
emplary iew Senate considerations:

1, Last week Debbie Friedman’s proposal that proceeds from
n Saga fast (scheduled for a week from today) go to the American
Friends Service Committee to help both North and South Vietnam
passed by a margin of a few votes.

Before passing that proposal the Senate talked at great lengths
as to whether concerned students could specify that their contribu—
tions go to North Vietnam, South Vietnam, or both.

This Wednesday the Senate couldn‘t remember what it de-
cidedr Was it in the minutes? Well . . . errr . ahhh . . a not
really. Could anyone figure out what was decided, Well . . . uhhh
. . .. no. But Senate Speaker Phil Berienlhal did a pretty good im-
promptu job of putting off remembering ior another week.

Quoth Phil: “Well, that can be decided when the ﬂyers go out
to the mailboxes and halls belor‘e the fast."

That’s iunny, I thought we decided the whole thing last week.

2. Last week the interim Committee -— headed by SGA presie
dent Ric Machwell -— decided the topics for interimr

i asked Ric why, alter the topics were decided, there were
about 150 unconsidered questionnaires (supposedly used for gaug-
ing student interest in speciiic topics) still in the Interim Box in
Carnegie Post oiiice. That was only two days alter the topics had
been decided.

' s “They didn't get them to us on time, and we had

Question: "How many of the questionnaires did you use in
selecting interim topics?”

Answer — from a committee member: "About 200 of them.”

Really now, people, couldn’t you have waited two days icr 150
more (43% more) answered questionnaires from interested stu-
dents? (Especially when they seemed to iavnr topics you didn’t
choose?) You do like representative samplings from the student
body, don’t you Ric?

3. Don Stump »— former head of a non-Senate committee to
provide a campus bike fleet —— reported that the bikes had been
purchased.

But a perceptive senator incisively noted a highly-important,
fundamental-type problem (paraphrased below):

“In Madison, Wisconsin r . . the police found similar bike:
were not owned by individuals and confiscated them all!”

Goshrarrooney, kiddies, do you think it'll happen at Grinnell?

4. The Senate then departed from its usual format and began
to discuss less signiiicant issues — like changing SGA into an efﬁ—
cient, productive, provocative, and useful body.

Oh, one addendumr Something was kind or important at the
Senate meeting (really, no kidding) at least to my mind.

Doug Tollefsen, who is heading up the student Senate Commit-
tee m1 Admissions, enthusiastically reported that a collection of
student and iaculty comment on Grinnell College will be put to
gether to give pruspectives more than a catalog description of the
college, ‘

Tolleisen said that the publication would present several per-
spectives oi salient aspects or the campus.

“Grinneli is in a slate of flux," he said, "and although there
are drawbacks to coming here we want to attract students who
will contribute constructively to Grinnell's future”

After I told him i might submit a scathing column or two dlSv
secting Grinnell irom my perspective, Tollefsen indicated that
even that sort of contribution is welcome for consideration.

The student Committee on Admissions will edit contribution!
and submit a ilnal draft to the college tor publication.

“We don't think that a true picture of Grinnell will dlSCOHl'ag.
too many applicants,” Tollefsen concluded.

So, after all, the Senate did do something this week. Thing:
seem to be happening in committees — not always good things,
but sometimes . . . like a real picture of this all-torrreal place.

Everything, i guess, happens for the best in that best or all
possible student governments.

Right, Ric?
