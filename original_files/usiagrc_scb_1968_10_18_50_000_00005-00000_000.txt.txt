May Appearance
Set for Cyclone

Cyclone 196869, the Giinnell
College yearbook, will appear
in May. Only one issue of the
Cyclone ls being published this
year. Stephanie Kreuger, Cy-
clone editor, is confident that
the Cyclone can be a publica-
tion that all the students will
appreciate.

The staff is attempting to
strike some sort of medium be-
tween 3 middle - of - the - mad
yearbook and a photographic
essay, instead of using a
“theme," the mood of the cam-
pus will be portrayed by an
essay and candid photographs
of campus life. Although it is
virtually impossible for the Cy-
clone tn be completely objec-
tive, according to the editor,
the enlarged staff of 28 will at-
ford a greater cross-section of
campus opinion.

This year the Cyclones is op-
erating under a new financial
arrangement with the college.
At this point all funds are
coming from the sale of adver-
tisements and subscriptions. If
not subscriptions at $6.00 each
are not sold, the Cyclone will
receive funds from SGA. Miss
Kreuger said that she is iairly
certain that the quote will be
reached and passed.

Miss Kxeuger says that the
yearbook must serve four func-
tions. A yearbook is an artistic
creation which must be journal-
istically responsible. it must be
a marketable item which an
peals to the students and is

worth their investment. The
Cyclone serves as training for
the stall.

Editor Kreuger thinks that
there is a definite need for a
yearbook. The yearbook should
not duplicate the "Sell Grinnell"
approach of the catalogue. In
portraying the “Grinnell un-
derneath,” the Cyclone givel
the students a capsule of the
moods and emotions of a par«
ticular time in their lives.

The staff, pleased with the
response thus far from the stu-

‘dents and administration, hopes

to avoid the mistakes of the
past by remaining financially
solvent and appealing to the
entire student body. ideally.

clone will be a publication in

Modern Music Musings

ay lot-m GARDNER

The first of five contemporary
concerts to be directed thin
year by Paul Zonn was staged
Saturday night at 8:00 in ARH.
It featured very little twelvos
tone music, and combined eleos
Ironic effects with conventional
musical instrumentation in only

one piece, sanctum ill by Mr.
Zonn. Sparse instrumentation
was used in the program, pro-
ducing less an effect of clusters
oi tones than of voices with
separate identities, especially
when very different ranges of
one or two instruments were put
together.

The first composition, "June.
titres" by Mario Davidovsky.
was commissioned by Bowdoin
College and first performed
there in 1966. Davidovsky is
known as a pure electronic or
electronicewith-instrument coni-
poser, and works with the Col-
umhia - Princeton Electronic
Music Center. Mr. Marsh, violin.
Mr. Purswell, flute, and Mr.
Zonn, clarinet, performed the
piece. Wide dynamic range was
suggested by the three instru-
ments. which were rarely used
all together.

Mr. Zonn calls the next num-
ber, "Solo Piece", by Karllns,
“a tried and true piece" aiter
over 100 performances in New
York and Chicago. “It ex-
plores the complete dynamic
range and technical range of
the clarinet," he adds. Employ-
ing flutter—tongue technique in
some passages, “Snlo Piece” is
a good introduction to contems
porary techniques in solo wood.
wind playing. These vary from
composer to composer, and are
constantly added to.

Mr. Zonn comments that com-
posers of innovative music with
new techniques are sending a
considerable amount cl music
to Grinncll “since they know at
it as a center for new music."
This reputation, which has been
built in the last year, was
added to by a Broadcast Music
Incorporated (BMl) article last
May on new music at Grinncli.

The next piece on the par
gram, Sonorurn ill, was scored
for piccolo and two channel

tape recorder. “Senorum”
means sound, and it is a "sound
piece." The ups effects were
electronic manipulations of
some of the piccolo sounds, and
some that could be produced by
the piccolo. Souonnn in fall:

into three sections: 1) slow; 2)
lwinging, with the tape suggest-
ing a jazz combo and the solo
instrument playing a jazz line
above; 3) slow material. Mr.
Zonn wrote it last April, and it
was commissioned by Mr.
Purswell. who played the picco<
lo. Purswell's sound was very
ﬂexible, meandering often be.
tween pitches (which Zonn mcnc
tmns as a Furswell “bag").
The premiere performance of
the 7-minute composition wal
at Johns Hopkins this year.

Lou Harrison's “First Concers
to for Flute and Percussion"
came next on the program.
(Harrison, a west coast com-
poser, is a friend of John Cage)
The piece is scored for 3 small
drums, a bell, and a flute. It
uses a dlatonic kind of scale,
and, like much oriental music
by which it was influenced.
sounds less dlssonant than un-
familiar to the listener. It roe
sembles an Indian raga in that
the same basic pulse is estabs
Iished and used consistently.
Besides the South American
“guil’o,” which is played by
scratching its surface, the ins
stmments also showed distinct
Eastern influence.

The final composition in the
concert was Robert Morris'
“Sangita ’67.” it involved 13
players on flute, strings, and
percussion, ranging from cello
to Celeste. Two conductors co-
ordinated figures played by the
group from music which givel
rhythmical and pitch sugges.
tions. in “Sangita,” also, dice
sonance is avoided in favor of n
floating, oriental kind of hath
monic environment.

At the end at the concert, I
panel composed of Paul Hersh,
Richard Howe, and Patrick
Pursweil discussed the program,
This idea, according to director
Paul Zonn, seemed to work, and
may be used in forthcoming
concerts,
