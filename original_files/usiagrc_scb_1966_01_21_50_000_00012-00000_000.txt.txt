picked up its first win of the year
over the Christmas break by heat-
ing the host school at the Chicago
tournament, 5445. The Pioneers

to a 18 record, Knox beat them in
the finals of the tournament 67-5&
The Pioneers then dropped a pair
of games to Carleton and St. Olaf.
Last Saturday the Pioneers lost
to Cornell 75-71.

The Pioneers‘ rebounding was
improved, and they also cut down
the number of turnovers at the
Chicago meet. The rebounding was
especially pleasing because the
Pioneer starting lineup averaged
under six feet both nights,

Unfortunately the Pioneers were
not so proficient in their shooting.
The Pioneers hit only 34 per cent
item the tield against Chicago and
31 per cent against Knox.
