Vol. LXXIV

Grinnoll, Iowa. Friday, February l0, i967

 

By Steve Kent

Last December I was among 100 co-signers of an open letter
to President Johnson. My fellow signers were all student body presi-
dents at their respective colleges and universities with the excep-
tion of several who were editors or their campus newspapers. Our
purpose was to alert the President to the growing skepticism on
many campuses concerning our present policy in Vietnam and to
initiate a responsible dialogue between the administration and the
American student population in the hope that most students’ doubt:

might prove unwarranted.

In response to our letter, each of the signers
received a letter irom Secretary of State Dean
Rusk in reply to our original question, inviting a

select group from the one hundred of us to come
to Washington to discuss the Vietnam situation.
Tuesday, January 31, was set as the date for our

conference with the Secretary,

early the next day went on to Dunbarion College,
where we were to gather prior to our meeting

—— Early Arrivals —

A group of eighteen early arrivals had met the previous week-
end to draft a second letter to Secretary Rusk and to establish ten-
tatively the guidelines ior our Tuesday meeting Tuesday morning
the inte arrivals, including myself, were brieled by the planners.
Several delegates were designated as spokesmen in order to insure
that certain questions would be raised in the time allowed us with
the Secretary, It was also decided that we would agree to an inform-
al discussion arrangement and promise not to publicly quote or
represent the Secretary's views as expressed in our discussion

Our meeting with the Secretary lasted almost two hours. The
exchange was lively and touched on many aspects of the Vietnam

Judicial Study Group Proposes
Complete Court Reorganization

By Jan Hale

A group organized late last
semester to study the College
judicial system is preparing
proposals for a complete re<
organization oi the judicial
structure. The study group,
initiated by Primary Court
Magistrates Tim Daily and Lin-
da Neal, has been meeting
regularly since the beginning
of the second semester.

in addition to Daily and
Miss Neal, the study group in-
cludes Chairman of the Facul-
ty Joseph F. Wall and Deans
James Stauss, Alice Low, Eu-
gene Thompson and Richard
Winters.

The group’s tentative propos
als reflect a desire to eliminate
overlapping jurisdictions such
as now exist between the stu<
dent courts and the Faculty
Committee on Student Aliairs.
Proposals would also eliminate
such dual and conflicting roles
as now exist in the case of
the deans, who act both as
counselors and disciplinarians,
and in the case oi the faculty
committee, which acts in both
a judicial role and a policy.
making rule. These changes, it

is hoped, would reduce the kind
of reverberating tension the
community experiences as me
es are moved from one level
of judicial authority to another.

The study group is planning
to hold a joint meeting with
the Faculty committee on Stu-
dent Affairs, the Executive
Cabinet and the other members
of the student government. Fol-
lowmg this meeting, the group
hopes to present deiinite pm
posals for judicial reform to
the administration and the stu-
dent body.

Rule Breaker

of a Smith l-lhii sophomore
facing charges 01 illegal visi-

The Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs (FCSA) ruled
that the student should be sus-

withdrew." The student with-

Since December, 1965, every
case of illegal visitation handled
by the FCSA has resulted in
suspension or expulsion, Asso-
ciate Dean Richard Winters
and Dean 5. Eugene Thompson,
however, do not feel ready to
describe the action taken in
this case as a precedent for
procedure in future incidents.

The student involved, when
conircnted with the charges,
made no attempt to deny them.

The girl involved in the case
did not attend Griitnell. She had
been staying in Smith during
her two-day visit to campus.

Grinnell's Trustees, who have
made the autumn fee increase
is distressing custom, felt
“obliged to add to the compre-
hensive charge" in light of in-
flationary operating costs, only
two»thirds of which will be ab-
sorbed by the tee rise.

However, President Leggett
promised parents in his letter
that “to the extent possible the
College will increase its finan-
cial assrstancc to students who
otherwise would not be able to
complete their education at
Grinnell." According to the
President, the College antici-
pates increasing its scholarship
