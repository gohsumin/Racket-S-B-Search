concern iii getting this matter
done right away, so that laeirtty
members can consult seniors
about whom they are concerned

Then the laeulty got right down
to serious business A motion was
submitted by Mr Worley to tips
prove soccer as a varsity sport
lor next year During the dis
Cussion it developed that he had
ulterior motives. It seems he has
been coaching the soccer club tor
the last live years, and oiiiciai
recognition oi the club as a team,

ing Mr Piitsch hastened to point
out that the boys were not dis-
satrsired with Mr. Woriey, they
inereiy wanted a real coach.
when Mr Worley looked hurt,
Pfitsch hastened lurther to point
out that there was nothing wrong
with Worley’s coaching, it was
just that the fellows wanted
someone who knew what he was
talking about. Then he gave up
and sat down, Querled about Mr.
Worley’s abilities as a proiessoi’
oi philosophy, Mr, Klausner
replied. “First string, tirst string

.” The motion passed with a
minimum alter a short goal run,

Next item to be Considered was
the establishment ot a major in
Russian language and literature.
During the discussion Mr. when

alacrity, Mr, Crossett, deciding
to continue the detailed inquiry,
wanted to know if the items in the
library would have to be changed
in accordance with the new sys-
tem of transliteration introduced
by Mr. Whelan and colleagues.

serve as artificial Sitzl'leisch and
opinc on whether Mr. Wall’s sub

motion which was still on the
iloor At this point Mr, Foster
delivered a lengthy paraphrase
of an obscure Section at Robert's
Rules oi order, causing Mr. Leg

run the meetings by Stauss’
Rules of Order, and that was
more or less that. Wall's

candidate insteadof voting in the

she thought some students might
try to vote in more than one

wanted to avoid “A gay swrshing

Mr. Hermann heaved a great
Sigh when he saw all his work on
the Betts proposal going down the
drain, saying, “I don't know why
we have to go through all this . , .,

supplied, “Stupidity is the word
