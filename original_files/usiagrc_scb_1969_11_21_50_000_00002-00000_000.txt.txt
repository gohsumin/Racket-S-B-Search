By Jon Stein

pia " will be shown Friday at
9:30 pm. and Saturday at 8:30
pm. "The White Zombie" will
be shown at 10:30 p.m. Sat»
urday and at 8:00 pm. on Sun-
day,

“Tokyo Olympiad," directed
by Kori Ichikawa (“Fires on
the Plain"), is a 93—minute col-
or documentary on the 1964
Olympics. it is not merely a
sports film, but a magnificent-
ly executed cinematic ode to
the human body and spirit.
Much of the film is pure mon-
tage, borrowing liberally from
Riefenstahl and Eisenstein.
The photography is stunning,
employing a number of spe-
cial effects, such as strobe
shots of the gymnasts, exten«
“£1159 of slow motion, and

some remarkable closeups.

“The White Zombie,” is a su~
perior horror iilm, it was
made during the early Thirties,
the socalled “golden age of

horror film,” Lon Chaney Sr,
was originally scheduled for
the starring role, but because
of his death (still a mystery) it
was given to Bela Lugosi, the
Hungarian actor who had been
brought to the U.S, to star in
“Dracula" (1931). This lS a
“good guy-bad guy” film (hiss),
yet devoid of mood music and
special effects. Yay!

“Notorious," next Wednesday
night at 3:30, is a Hitchcock
film with lngrid Bergman, Cary
Grant, and Claude Rains. More
a study of relationships than
a straight thriller, this is one
of Hitchcock’s best films.

tried in Justice of the Peace
court in Grinnell and 'each
fined $100 on the possession of
beer charge.)

Presently, the Grinnell auxs
iliary police are relied on for
security at concerts and dances
in Darby and the Forum.

Stein pointed out that in
many ways this is not the best
security system, since the
auxiliary police cannot effec-
tively keep outsiders from col-
lege activities.

He also mentioned the high
cost of using the auxiliary por
lice: to guard the Darby dress-
ing room effectively, three or
four policemen (instead of one)
would be needed, and they cost
$15 per man per night.

Thus increasing this kind
of security to the point where
it might be effective would
mean one less concert or
dance each year, Stein said.

Stein suggested that a dif-
ferent kind of security system
be considered, possibly elim-
inating the unnecessary uni-
forms a and guns — of the
auxiliary police, and making
use of student ID cards.

Although he foresaw possible
student opposition to any such
“tightening of security," Stein
said that Grinnell students
”just have to start asking
themselves if we aren't getting
to be a place where you can’t
trust everybody.”

Once upon a time some pilgrims shot some turkeys and shared their feast

with some Indians. However. there was a dissenting Italian among them, He

didn't like turkey. corn pudding, or cranberries. He missed a good Pizza horn

some moderates, who wanted both turkey and pine.

The senate Tuesday night
e n d o r s e d the following
resolution presented by the
Steering Committee for the
Student Position Paper:

“Toward the end of greatly
expanded participation in the
governance of Grinnell College,
we students submit the
following guidelines:

1) Academic policy should be
determined by the faculty and
the students equally. Personnel
matters should be left to the
faculty.

2) Social rules and their
enforcement should be deter
mined by a body having a
student majority,

3) Community service policies
d i r e ct l y allecting students
should be opened to expanded
student participation.

4) Counseling services should
be determined with fifty per-
cent student representation.”

This resolution was sub-
mitted to the student body in
a relerendum today. The reso-
lution is intended to serve
as a basic guideline for the
Steering Committee in its
discussion with the faculty. In
another resolution the Senate
recommended that the Steering
Committee replace the 5
student members presently on
the Student—Faculty
Organization Committw,
chaired by Mr. Betts. The
senate felt that this was ap
propriate since the Steering
Committee is made up of the
elected representatives of the
Student Position Paper.

in other action an election
board consisting of senators
Aldrich, Broadwell, Stranger,
and Thomas was appointed to
run the election to fill the va-
cancy in the senate when Lynn
Aldrich leaves the college at
the end of the semester. Also,
one position will be open on
the Campus Judicial Council.
Interested persons should see
the student coordinator or Jim
Lew.

A large amount of damage
in the halls is becoming a
major problem for SGA. The
present policy on assessing stu-
dents for hall damage is that
persons responsible for the
damage will foot the bill, if they
can be identified. If not. the
hall will pay the bill, If the
hall refuses to pay, the money
will come out of next year's
student government funck,
according to Dean Waldo
Walker. As a deterrent to halls

refusing to pay for damages,
the senate adopted a resolution
proposed by Andrew Brill to the
effect that halls that have out-
standing damago debts will be
eligible for initiative funds for
hall functions only with the alps
proval or the senate, and in
exceptional cases. Halls with
large debts will find it very
difficult to get initiative funds
in the future,

Senators, House Presidents,
and VicerPresidents are author-
ized to fine students 51 for
cutting SAGA lines. Names of
fined students should be sub
mitted to the Student Auditor
so that he may bill the guilty
student. _

Social Coodrinator Jon Stein
is looking for interested stu-
dents to form a Coffee House
Committee to investigate the
possibility or putting the Forum
Coffeehouse to some use,
perhaps serving food and en-
couraging student entertainers
to perform there. if you are
interested see Jeri Stein soon,
as he wants to get things set
up for next semester.

Finally, the senate had a 45-
minute debate on the "drinking
problem” here at Grinnell
(didn’t know we had one, did
you?) According to Ric MacV
Dowell, the Administration and
certain staff are uptight about
students drinking in public,
such as occurred on that warm
fall day a couple of weeks ago
on central campus. The consen-
sus of the senate was that this
is covered by state law, and
the students should be responsi-
ble for their acts, A ruling on
this, it was felt, would just be
another rule in loco parentis (or
“in parentis loco," as Steve
Schwartz put it). I hereby take
it upon myself to inform the
student body that drinking is
a nono because it is against
the law. Thus, when you drink
in public, I urge you not to
get caught by police or un-
friendly administrators! If you
think this is worthless advice,
talk to our illustrious Assistant
Student Coordinator Steve Sch-
Wartz.

canadian Exhibit

“Recent Prints: Canada," an
Exhibition of 47 works by
Canadian painters and sculp
tors, opens Saturday (Nov. 22)
at the Scheafter Gallery in
Grinnell’s Fine Arts Center.

The exhibition, which con-
tinues through Dec. 18. was
organized by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City
in 1967 in honor of the Canadian
Centennial.

“This highly selective survey
suggests the vitality, excite-
ment, and variety of Canadian
art today,” said William S.
Lieberman, director of the
Museum of Modern Art’s
Department of Drawings and
Prints, who selected the works
with Riva Castleman, assistant
curator tor prints,

Due to Thanksgiving, next
week’s 5&8 will be publish-
ed on Saturday, November
