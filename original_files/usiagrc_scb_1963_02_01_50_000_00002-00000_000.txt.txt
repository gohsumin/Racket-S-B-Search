concern was to develop a

which student opinicm could
be directed to the laculty and

orgnnized such a committee
and it is presently iunctiouiug
to dcvclop certain student re.

this with all intenSity no sober man can match.

When you're sober, you walk down the
hall wondering whether or not you ou'ght to say
hello to some guy walking the other way; when
you get right down to it, your basic emotion is
a petty kind ol tear. But when you're .drunk,
you clap him on the shoulder without thinking
at all, and yell friendly things at him. And
your basic emotion is love, brother; you‘ve torn
down all those ridiculous sober walls between
you and everybody else. Drunks aren't petty,
and they're not afraid either. And i ask you.
ain't this the right way to look at things? Ain't
lhrs a truth?

The statements We made about the spiritual
cliccts of liquor are generalizations. and i know
they don't hold for everybody. Some people get
mean when they drink, othels Just get sick;
it usually depends on how much and when, as
well as who.

But damn me if I don‘t speak foul
truths: the sober man learns certain things,
usually through rational process, and the
drunk lcarns other things by joyiul intui-
tion. And any scholar who never hung one
on isn't worth his oats, because there's more
than one Gate to the City.

As a matter of fact, i hate to say it but
drunkenness and sobriety are by no means the
only states in which knowledge can be truitlully
pursued. But for information about certain mar-
velous drugs and anesthetics which help to
reveal things otherwise uiiknowable, I think I'd
better refer you to two scholarly works. “The
Doors ot Perception" by Aldous Hu,

Religious Experience" by William James. 1 must
