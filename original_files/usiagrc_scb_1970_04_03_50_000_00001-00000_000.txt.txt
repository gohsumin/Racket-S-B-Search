Facull'y Poll on S’ruden'l'

Representatives oi the Scarlet
and Black have conducted an
opinion poll among the faculty
of the college to ascertain the
reaction to the proposal oi the
Committee on Curriculum and
Academic Affairs, the text or
which appeared in the last issue
of the newspaper. These opinions
are presented here without
comment for the information of
the Griiinell College community:

Gerald V. Lalonde, Classical
Languages: “Basically it will be
a debate of who is going to run
the school, 1,] for one, still Credit
nie‘phlioso’phy underlying the
constitution of this College, and
any number of other institutions,
in delegating power on the basis
of certain credentials and ex
pcrience, Consequently I am
opposed to any measure which
will weaken or alter the present
status oi the iaculty in the
legislative process of the College.
One of the responsibilities of the
faculty in legislating curricular
and academic affairs is to
provide the most eiiicient
possible channels for student
opinion and to give this opinion
very serious consideration.
ironically, the referendum beiore
the faculty proposes to achieve
this rapport by abrogating the
very legislative power on which
this responsibility is promised.
But the proposal as i see it, with
the mutual veto power of students
and iaculty, and the possibility
ot a breach in the cooperative
relationship oi the faculty and the
President, is potentially less
efficient and more disruptive
than the present state of affairs,
Fortunately, these are not the
only alternatives, The proposal
in question has a number of
commendable points which could
be maintained satisiactorily by
the amendments to be proposed
by Mr. Goldberg i trust that this
will be theoutcome.”

Robert Grey. Political Science:
lam in essential agreement with

the proposal of the Betts come
mittee My support emerges
irom the proposition that
academic decisions should
reflect both the interests of the
educated and whatever special
competence exists in the come
niunity as to what these interests
are and how they may best he
realized Although there are
ditficulties in drawing boun-
daries between areas in which
various groups have competence
and areas in which they do not,
and comparable difficulties in
ascertaining who has most
competence in an area, I find the
Bctts committee’s distinctions
between departmental and allr
college curricular matters the
most satisfactory, albeit vague,
boundary line, Faculty members
have received substantial
training, done substantial
thinking, and conducted research
in their disciplines. This
background gives them a com-
peteiice in departmental matters
which should be reﬂected in
decisions at that level. They have
no comparable background, and
thus no special competence, on
all campus curricular matters.
Since our monopoly oi decision-
making at this level is unjustified
by special competence, and I
know of no other compelling
justiﬁcation, I support student
participation in these decisions.
