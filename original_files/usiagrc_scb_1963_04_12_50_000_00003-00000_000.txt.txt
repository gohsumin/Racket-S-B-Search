the idea that l i at Giirruell must be rustil‘rcd
on the basis or its contribution to college lilo,
intellectual. cultural arid so ial. Further-irror-e. this
contribution must be assessed on a relative basis,
whether FM j - l'r , rrs cost us well as do other
projects new in volume or contemplated,

it is remembered that,

sihle FM programming we’ve made here and the
commonsense notion that Giinlmll's situation
is not iar diiicrent than the colleges just noted, ,
lead to the conclusion FM would be a highly

valuable iulditilm to Gl’illllcll.

The whole argument ior FM made on thc
basis oi the educational value oi its program

An FM statlon could draw upon the resources
of several ol'gzlnltatiuns producing Excellent taped
programs. Some of these: the British Broadcast—
ing Corporation, the National Association of Ed—
ucational Broadcastc the Center of the Study
of Democratic instltl us, and the National Stu-

dent Association.

When one adds to these programs such tear
turcs as good music. lectures and discussions
originating at Grinncll. program exchangcs with
other schools, broadcasts of Grinnell spor clients,

and campus and world ncws, one has a rich and
varied bill of lore. Yet there are strll iurther
rises oi FM. For instanc , FM would provide an
instantaneous method ot all campus cormnunica-
tion without the necessity or gathering everyone
under one root.

in short, the oitcrings oi a College FM sta—
tion would be “educatiu ii" in the same way
