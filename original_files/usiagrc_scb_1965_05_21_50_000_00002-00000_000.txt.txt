late a Settlement at once.

‘ “We cannot assume," Kahin con-
iuded, “that Hanoi controls the
let Cong, and we cannot expect
o exert any Influence as long as
e bomb Hanoi. Bombings only

stitteii the will of Hanoi."

'Scalapino, speaking next, in

cated he was not a spokesman lor

the administration; he would not
defend United States policy with

Diem or at Geneva. But he sharp-

ly disputed Kahlrl's assertion that,

Hanoi and Feking inﬂuence in

South Viet Nam was minimal.
“The viet Cong,” he said, "is a

carbon copy or the Vietminh

which preceded it. This is not to,
say that the Viet Cong does not
have some nationalistic support.

The VietinuiIi also had nlultirfac-

tioiial support. but it was doiiii-

nated by the Communist party in

Hanoi.”

We must negotiate, he said; ilie
administration wants to; but “we
must negotiate with communism
as communism There is no intll-l
cation either the Viet Cong or
Hanoi wants to negotiate."

i In regard to Felting, Scalapin
said, “We cannot ignore the lac-
tor of power, Felting will jump
over to any country where she
can build her power." He ioresaw
. a Peking hegemony ii the Unitedl

States did not counter by power

in Asia. New leaders in North

Viet Nam, be said, are pl‘UrPEr

king; they are not likely to be

very independent lrom Chinese in-‘
terests, “Communism in Asia,” he
concluded, ”IS only partly a prod
tict of nationalism The pressures
of Communist China, unless Collnr
teracted by a balance or power,
will be anti-nationalistic and don-i».
mating in character."

Southern Newspaper
Planned By Students

By Sara Bey

Several Harvard Crimson edi-
tors and 3 Sta“ of 30 Amherst and
Harvard students plan to publish
an independent newspaper, the
Southern Courier, in the Black
Belt area (it the South this stlm<
mer. The Courier will attempt to
counteract the way in which the
local press distorts or omits news
concerning racial problems, the
student editors say, “This unv
ethical journalism makes it diffi-
cult for both the white and Negro
communities to understand—much
less solve—the problems that con-
front them.” The newspaper will
be printed in [our weekly edi-
tions, one each for Alabama,
Georgia, Louisiana, and MlSSlSr
sippi, and will carry not only ra-
cial news but local, national, and
international news, Sports, and tith-
er regular newspaper leatures.
The project will be ﬁnanced by
contributions.
