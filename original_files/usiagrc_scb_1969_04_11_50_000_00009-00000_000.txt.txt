(91ch returned with the feeling that
'demonstrations in the style at last week-
and had passed the point of any signiﬁ-
cant eflectlveness on the nation; they
sen/e now only as inspiration and re«
infurcement for the participants. Glick
personally feels that the movement has
two ways to chomse from in the future.
One is active Civil disobedience and com«
munity organizing; the other is violence.
Both involve a great. deal more risk for
the participants,

Larry Frank views the present situa-
tion as a return to an earlier stage.
Frank ielt this to be the end of the
peace movement's sellimposed morator-
ium which began at the time of Mo-
Carthy’s candidacy. At this point, the
peace movement has in a way gone
back to its beginnings. He stated that
each of the previous changes in the
peace movement would be quickly run
through and more steps will be added
until the nation responds, Some of the
patience is gone. The move, he felt.
would be toward violence. Frank said
however, that he didn't think violence
would come lor a long lime, Since ille
administration was “mu smart." The
threat of violence, he thought, would
produce results.

The peace movement has matured,
become more pragmatic, more cynical,
and more able to organize itselt into nee
tion. There is promise of a great deal of
change in the means of expressing dis-
content with the existing lack of peace.
