hand after being dropped from
the unbeaten ranks last week by
Ripon.

The Scots field a team that is
very similar to the Pioneers as
far as records go. Both have beat-
en Cornell by one point—Mom
'n'iouth, 19-18, and the Pioneers
al-zo—and both have just barely
oqueaked by a weak team in the

nierence—Monmouth over St. O<

two Pioneer touchdowns and an
interception helped snatch a Vic»
tot-y from what almost appeared
to be a disheartening loss.

8-7 Deficit

With only 3:21 leit in the game
Knox had tinaily broken through
the tough Pioneer defense to score,
and when they converted on the
Espnint pass, they turned what had
seemed a fairly safe 7o Pioneer
lead into an 8-7 deficit. But the
Pioneers drove so yards after the
kickoii to paydiri with 52 seconds
remaining. Then after the kickoff,
on the second play the Pioneers
intercepted a pass and returned it
to the tour yard line from which
they scored again with 27 seconds
remaining.

When the game started, the Pio-
neers looked like they were really
going to drive at will. After the
kickoff on the second play, Bob
Watt went around end for 23
yards on a reverse, Then one play
later Watt went eight yards for
a first down on the Knox 32. Here
the Pioneers got a break as Tom
Hill pounced on the tumble of one
of the Pioneer halibacks. But af»

zled out.

Thurston Steals Bull

The Pioneer defense got in
though and immediately
got the ball back as Paul Thurston
stole it from the Knox halfback.
But the offense got nowhere. After
two exchanges oi punts, the Pio-
neers picked up the ball again on
their 42. Then on two plays Jolm
Shierholz lugged the bail to the
Knox 28.

But as the second quarter began
the Pioneers lost 12 yards on a

of gas and Knox took over, A pass

brought the ball to the Pioneer 13
