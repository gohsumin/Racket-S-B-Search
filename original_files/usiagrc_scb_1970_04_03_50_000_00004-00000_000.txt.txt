The History of Henry Wilhelm and

PnrtOne

ByMarkSabieman
Five years ago, both Henry
Wilhelm and Krystyna Neuman
were students at Grillnell College
who pursued their studies and
other interests not too differently
trom other students, Henry was
a second semester freshman
when he went to Selma, Alabama
in March of 1965 to cover Dr.
Martin Luther King’s civil rights
march to Montgomery tor the
Scarlet and Black. Krystyna,
then in her sccond year at Grin

nell, shared with Henry an in '

latest in publications and a devo-
tion to liberal and radical causes;
in fact, she was to take the next
year off from school in order to
work with the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Chica~
go,

Yet all was not really so calm
in that spring term of 1965 as
it might have seemed then. For
when the FacultyStudent Board
of Publications selected John
Phillips and Henry Wilhelm as
the editors for the 1966 Cyclone,
the stage was set for a serious
conflict between Wilhelm and the
College, a conflict that would last
much longer than either would
have expected or hoped for,

That 1966 yearbook, as most
Grinnell students and faculty
know, was never published, ale
though Wilhelm put in a year and
a half of work into it, and flunked
out of school in the process. The
college refused to publish it,
because it was afraid some of
the pictures and copy in the book
7 for example, pictures at a pot~
party a might leave the college
open to libel suits.

Wilhelm did not leave Grinnell
after he flunkecl out of school and
after the college gave him back
the proof pages of the yearbook,
he stayed and opened up the East
Street Gallery of Photography in
his father's old house at 1408 East
Street. in 1957 Krystyna Neuman
joined him and they have been
living together there since then.

In the past lew years, Henry
and Krys, along with various
friends — Susie Kaeser, Richard
Schneirov, Steve Raitt, John
Phillips, Bob Hodierne, Larry
Frank, Kit Leder, and Ken Shai-
ness 7 who have lived at me
East Street Gallery with them,
have been involved in various
ways with the college and the
community.

Either Henry or Krys or both
has been a party to a civil suit
against the state or lowa, a civil
suit against Grinnell College. a

addition, they have filed com-
plaints when townspeople have
harassed them. For two indir
viduals who are often looked on
as “hippies” of “radicals," or as
Krys Neuman would say,
“freaks," they have an una
expected tamiliarityavith, and in
manﬁzways, a tali'th in, the
Amcrican judicial system.

Both of them — Wilhelm
especially a are very good ar~
listic photographers, although
recently they have tried to de-
emphasize their photography
except as a creative process
which gives them individual en-
joymentanosatislaction

They have a patent on a special
kind of photographic print
washer and another for a film
washer, designed especially forl
prolessionals who are interested
in print and negative per»
manence. Henry and Krys‘
produce these film and print
washers in their basement at the
East Street Gallery, and all of
the money from sales goes to run
the Gallery, which may describe
as a “noncompetitive
cooperative community.”

With respect to Henry and
Krys, the town of Grinnell might
be described a “non-cooperative
community.” Many townspeople
— and this includes a good
number of college professors 7
feel that Henry and Krys and the
East Street Gallery are a bad
inﬂuence on the community.
Many would like to see them
leave. .

Not all townspeople or college
laculty members feel this way,
of course Some, like Professor
Bernard Mergen (History), see
them as a positive inﬂuence on
the community and on students
and think it would be very un-
fortunate it the college and town
harassed them into leaving.

Mergen’s view is not the majority
one. Mergen may be right in
seeing a “blind anger and
hatred” on the part oi many
laculty members, and pre-
sumably, townspeople, towards
Henry and Krys. But not every-
one would agree to this, Pro-
fessor H, George Apostle (Math-
ematics) asks, “HOW is it blind?”
There may be, Apostle says,
some anger; not all of it is
“blind”

Questions of anger and blind
ness aside, there are undoubtedly
strong ieelings in the town and
the college community about
