Slightly over a century tigo, the most enjoyable strenuous
activity available was hunting- or just plain hiking.

It was not until about 1366 that two students, Charles
Noah Cooper, ’67, and Mahlan Willett, ‘69, decided to begin
a physical tr ning program, At the start it consisted of
two things: a collection was taken for :1 swing to be hung‘
from a strong tree, and Willett uscd to rise early and take
brisk walks, inducing a score of others to join him regular-

During the 1830’s, most physical exercise was
confined to sawing: lined and doing chores, mixed with
some occa mini hunting. As one student reflected, “We
