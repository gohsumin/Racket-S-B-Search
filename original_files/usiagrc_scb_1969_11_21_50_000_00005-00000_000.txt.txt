supposed to be chanting “1.2,

The crowd eventually gath-

a beginning — for Washington

Mineral Patter: The Rolling Stones

By L.

50 we all went to Chicago to
see the Rolling Stones, even
though it was at the Internation-
al Amphitheatre, and I guess we
all got what we expected—Jag-
ger running around and shaking
his thing, a lot of songs we’d
heard before and some we
hadn’t, a good but not great,
and exciting but not earthshak-
ing show. And it was worth it to
have been there, even more
than a concert; like all major
rock performances, it was the
charisma of the group, like
Cream and Hendrix and Blind
Faith, but like Dilly the Stones
can really put out now, and like
only the Stories ever could.

Because they are and always
will be the super group. The
Beatles have art, the Stones de-
pend more on emotion. Gut mu-
sic seems about the best de-
scription, no pretension, just
sound and feeling. It's these
things, my emotional reactions,
which still make me say that
the Stones are the greatest
rock group in the world, the
only ones in their class, even if
there are people I’d rather lis-
ten to on records and some I'd
rather see live. But I had to see
the Stones, we all did, and we
came away feeling not much
better but in some way fulfilled,
or at least relieved that they’re
still there.

Musically, i can’t judge the

Stones because my reaction to
them is so emotional, They did
songs that I liked and played
them well. The songs from their
new album were impressive, es-
pecially the slow and pretty
“Love in Vain” and the long
and frantic “Midnight Ram-
bier," both in the same great
style, always improving, that
they’ve had from the beginning.
They seem to have matured
just a bit, a little less pushy,
but not too much, sort of the
way a lot of us have changed.
But Jagger, for all his sex
games, lets us know that they're
with us, not just on our side, but
friends we can depend on. He
projects more warmth than I
could imagine. And if his voice
seemed more strained and less
strong than I remembered, he
hasn’t done a whirlwind tour
of one-nighters for a long time.
Mick Taylor hasn‘t yet replaced
Brian in our hearts, but he's a
fine guitar player, as is Keith

with Jagger singing ”Prodigal
Son“ and one other)

but Chuck Berry, the master.
brought the house shouting and
dancing to their feet. Playing
with three white freaks backing
him and sounding just like his
old Chess studio group, he took
us back ten or fifteen years to
the days of our youth. He
played updated but identical
sounding versions of many of his
his, and generally zonked ev-
erybody out. And when the
Stones did “Oh Carol” you could
see how much Jagger owes to
Berry. in music as well as emo-
tional appeal to the audience
and, maybe most notably, life
style. Chuck was getting busted
inr sex and dope things when
Mick and all of us were just
kids, And the Stones couldn’t
get much earthier lyrically
then Berry did in a long, fan-
tastic version of “Reelin’ and
Rockin.’ ” The Stones, however,
live in a different world, a
white jet set world where men
ey isn’t a problem and their
public clamors out if they get
arrested,

But the world has changed

since 1966 (their last Ameri-
can tour) and so have the
Stones. Where was your head
in was? Theirs, like many of
ours, were on-and booze
and starting to be on dope, and
they still are, but now there's
the realization that somebody’s
going to have to fight back or
we can’t have all that good

-we want. So we have
Jagger singing “Street Fighting
Man" like he means it, as much
as he means “Under My
Thumb" and “Satisfaction."
And the response is not from
screaming little girls and boys
but grown men and women,
clenched fists in the air, yelling
not only words of adoration but
“All Power to the People."
(Even the Airplane sings about
Revolution Now! and get kids
in Iowa City to break police
lines.) True, those in Chicago
didn’t all read the Weatherman
leaflets, and when the show was
over they all took to the streets
and went home, not to smash
windows. But they sat in the
Amphitheatre where the Demo-
cratic pigs had held their death
rally, and smoked What little
dope they had, openly. and you
know that somewhere in the
teaming masses of freaks there
was some hope that we can get
our heads together before the
Nixons and Agnews and Tur-
ners and Lows can bring the
axes dawn on our necks.
