Attcr several minutes of wall-

were served but, bcicre they
were finished. were asked to
leave iii order, according to the
operator, to liveid arousing his
customers to Violence and to
free a tilblo fr‘r ll'atllllg pall‘onx.

The couple stated that there
were several tables and booths
vacant at that time, and that
there seemed to be no indication
that a tight might be started.

Several Grinuell students
have since talked to the chic
operator and he has said that
he doesn‘t mind serving Ne-
grues if they are alone, with
a group of people,. or with
another person of their own
sex. He said that he will not
apologize nor will he serve
mixed couples in his establish—

Consideration oi the resolu—
tion was postponed tor one week
in order to ascertain student
feeling toward the proposed
boycott. Halama told the body
that he has written several cilia

policy which it reels would be

l Basie change in the rule, as
‘ Horton explained it, would be
‘ to place the emphasis in the
suture on disorderly conduct
regulations and to strike the

alcoholic beverages. Under the
proposal, drinking would be
legal in student rooms, but not

In discussion or the proposed
change, several Senators asked
whether it would be tlautinﬁ
State law. Horton said that as
long as the College does not
encourage drinking. no law is
broken. He also stated that no
trusts, endowments or other
funds received by the College
are contingent upon a nardrink-
ing policy.

It a hall president will not or
cannot enforce the disorderly
conduct rule, the Dean of the
College, upon recommendation
by the Quill? or the Executive-
Cabinet, would be empowered
to suspend the halls social
privileges.

Horton said that the proposal
ivas not in encouragement of
consumption or alcohol, but
rather, to engender a mature
attitude among students through
a more realistic rule.

The new policy, Horton said,
