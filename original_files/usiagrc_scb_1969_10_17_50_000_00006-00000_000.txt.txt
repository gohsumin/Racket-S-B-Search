a valid reason for hiding out in
their offices. 1 nm led to the
conclusion that most of the
women faculty members don’t
care about the war or the race
problem; or that they don’t care
enough to lay their opinions on
the line, Perhaps, it’s tear or

As ior female students, they
are larger in number as a body,
but not much stronger in voice,
than the women faculty mem-

those loquacmus women of the
stereotype? Perhaps when peo-

answer yes. What else are we

There are only two valid rea-

The Oh Squad: Stomp, liompi and Pomp

By Molly McGuire

With banners blazing and bus
gles blaring, to the merry
strains or “Romplng through the
Swamp," Gnnnell’s iralamous
cheering section, the ”0b
Squad,” promises to make an
other appearance at the Home—
comihg game tomorrow.

The Ob Squad, described by
one spokesman as a "dynamic,
throbbing, progressive asocial
group," has made itselr known
at home tootball games both
this year and last, storming
down from the stands 10 lead
the students in all-beat cheers
and songs. Two weeks ago, they
made a road trip to st. Olal,
where they cheered the team to
its first loss.

Based on the principle that
students do want to Cheer and
enjoy themselves at games but
are turned off by the ”same Old
leitnver—lrom-liigh school rah-
rah yells,” the ob Squad hopes
to give {ans a new way to ex~
press their enthusiasm.

Although it has no definite
membership list, the group has
ﬂourished since its meager be-
ginning last yearr Now the gay
participants may number as
many as 75, but as one member
put it, “For the most part, I
think every student on this
campus is a member at least in
spirit.”

Constantly adding to its re-
pertoire, the group has per-

Superbowl.) Refusing {0 lie
themselves to anything done in
the past, they pride themselves
in being in an “everchanging
state of flux," according to
junior Phil Mears. an 0!) Squad
spokesman,

The group is currently em-
phasizing the aesthetic musical
aspects or their periormances.
0n the St. Olaf roadshow, every-

one was asked to bring some
sort of musical instnlment (or
noisemaker) and they ended up
using, among other things, cym.
bals, bass drums, cowbells,
trumpets, and kazoos.

What’s next? They hope to sea
an enthusiastic revival of the
old, long-torgotten school songs
of Grinnell as published in the
1917 Version of “Songs of tilt
Scarlet and Black"
