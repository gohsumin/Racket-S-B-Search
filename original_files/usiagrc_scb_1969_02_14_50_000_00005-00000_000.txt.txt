Ad. Building Seized In Student Power Play

By BILL RAFFERTY

“I’ve learned how to be cynical about
waiting, committees and about the
‘sacred nature of the institution!’ HOW
much longer do you want us to wait?
It’s about time we were a little realistic.
We’ve waited long enough.”

This statement by Alina Grossman,
an undergraduate at the University ot
Chicago, characterized the majority View
of students who voted to take over the
Admlnistration Building, January 30,
1969. The Students intend to remain in
the building until their demands are
met.

This demonstration called non-vio-
lent disruption hy the students, is the
latest phase in the attempt to gain

student power in making iaculty and
administrative decisions. Although the
movement has been building for some
time, the tiring of sociologist Marlene
Dixon is the main issue in contention.
The students occupying the AdminisA
[ration Building have [our non-negotiable
demands,

L Rehire Miss Dixon.

2. Amnesty tor protestnrs (61 suspen-
sions have been issued).

3. Equal student participation in hir-
ing and ﬁring.

l, Full payment tor school employees
in the Administration Building.

.The demonstrators expected the Ed-
ministrators to comply with the de

mands, forcibly evict the students, or
close the University. However, alter two
weeks, suspensions are ihe‘only visible
reaction. Apparently the administrators
hope the sit-in will die with time.

The number or protestors has
dwindled. The original 400 has dropped
to an estimated 175 actively involved.
Although this seems to justify admin-
istrative hopes, the obstacles the
group has overcome makes a “natural
death” unlikely.

The movement was organized by the
‘Committee of 85'. 0f the ‘85' one-third
were SDS organizers, the remainderim
eluded numerous organizations ranging
from the extremely radical to the
staunchly conservative. Of these, WRAP
(Women’s Radical Action Project), and
the Guerrilla Theater are Oi Special im-
portance.

Those not willing to participate but
still Wish to act have formed a Guerrilla
Theater group. The group has been
instrumental in presenting the issues
to those not actively involved.
The Women's Liberation movement
is responsible tor the negotiable de-
mand for 50% women on the faculty.

lessor in the sociology department in 19

A Do “Yourself Guide To A Successful Sil-In

By SUSAN KAESER

The Administration budding at the
University or Chicago is presently hous-
ing so to 100 students a day. Liie in the
administration building is quite diiterent
from the usual activities that are Con-
ducted there. The student protesters
who took over the building January 30.
have been sleeping in the President’s
oliice and other carpeted rooms. The
fifth floor contains the security center,
the kitchen (a desk with peanut butter,
cold cuts, bread, and cheese), and a
study area (several oilice typewriters
and calculators are being used). School
still goes on so students leave the build-
ing to attend classes, shower, or get a
good night's sleep,

One protester explained that it is not
too dilticult to participate in this sort of
living situation. There are 10 steps that
are usually taken in establishing res-
dence in an administration building

1. Go through all proper channels to
make your demands known.

2. Pamphlet the campus and make
people aware of plans, goals. times and
places.

3. Hold a rally to decide actions and
when to take them.

4. Set up a steering committee to or-

range ior iood, security, telephoning.
and legal aid it necessary.

5. Have someone planted in the bulld-
ing who can case the joint, lmd guards,
make sure things will work. and give
the sign to enter.

6. Meet at appointed time and place,
mill around outside, and wait for a Sign
to enter.

7. Enter building and allow those in
the building to leave.

8. Don’t let administrators back in.

9. Set up security and move in.

10. Stay until your demands are met.

Several diilerent types oi people are
living in the building. One participant
characterized three major groups.
“There are lhxee groups of people, the
two iactions oi SDS who write pamphlets
all da the moderates who don’t. do
anythi g, and the freaks who take care
of security.”

There is no central power group run-
ning the protest. There are several com-
mittees which are responsible tor load,
security, and negotiations. but all deci-
sions about action come from mas:
meetings. According to one student,
