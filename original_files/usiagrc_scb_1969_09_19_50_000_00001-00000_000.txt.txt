Statement on Drug Problem

T0: Students and Faculty
FROMl Glenn Leggett

Below is a statement describing the basic position and pro-
eedures under which the College will proceed with the “drug
ﬁi'oblem." it should be read as a supplement to the already pub-

shed statement in the Student Handbook, pages 18—19.

This supplementary statement was prepared in consultation
with representative faculty and students, with resident advisers,
and With the legal counsel of the College. The problems surround~
ing drug use are very complicated, and I am aware that this
statement is imperfect. Events and continuing discussion will
bring iorth suggestions for improving it; they will he welcome
and considered for incorporation into future Statements. In the
t‘neantime, however, I believe this supplementary statement, which
is effective as of this date, provides us with a defensible position
and a useful series of procedures for supporting it.

Alter the first paragraph, which is largely a rte-statement of
the material in the Grinnell Student Handbook, pages 18-19, the
following is designed to describe the general procedures by which
the College will implement its established position on the illegal
drug problem:

The College expresses deep concern over the possible harm to
Kiudents who may be involved in the use of dangerous and unlawful
drugs, and wishes to make its attitude toward the use of such
drugs as clear as possible. The major concerns are the serious
possibility or damage to the mental and physical health of users,
the legal consequences of involvement in the possession or distri-
bution of drugs, the effect oi drug use on the academic well-being
of students, and the likelihood that drug users will encourage others
in the campus community to become involved. The College will
make efforts to inform students about drug use, by providing both
individual counselling and outside speakers and reading materials.

Students are reminded that private and conﬁdential help
concerning drug problems is available, They are encouraged to
use the confidential services of the Jasper-Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Center; or, if they wish, they may talk with a resident
ldvlser or staff coumellor or student dean or faculty person of
their choice. They will be given all the private and confidential
help the college can provide, and this confidentiality will be
respected. .

with these considerations in mind, the College will proceed as
follows with students involved in illegal drug use:

(1) If there ls alleged to be substantial knowledge that a stu«
dent is using any kind of illegal drug in the residence halls or on
campus, he will be asked to confer with I group composed of
the student deans, a faculty member or a student’of his own
choosing, and a faculty member appointed by the Chairman of
the Faculty.

As a result of this private discussion, the group may decide
on any or more of the following:

(A) The allegations about drug use may not be true, or

(B) The student may be told to seek professional counselling,
or

(C) The student may be told to seek psychiatric help, or

(D) The student may be reprimanded, or
(in 'event of any of these latter three results, the parents or
guardians oi ihe student may be notified if circumstances appear
lo make such action advisable.)

(E) The student may be recommended for disciplinary action
to the president of the College. Any disciplinary action, if
so recommended, may range from social probation through
removal from the residence halls to dismissal from col-
lege. In any of these possibilities, and in accordance with
usual practice in disciplinary matters, the parents or
guardians oi the student will be notified. This practice of
notification is part or the College‘s obligation to parents
and guardians.

Recommendations for disciplinary action will he sent to the
resident of the College. The student so recommended may appeal
is case to the president, or he may first ask for 3 Judicial Coun-

cll hearing. In the latter evem, all information made available to
the private discussion group will in turn be made available to
the Judicial Council. Depending on the recommendation of the
Judicial Council, the student may appeal his ease to the president
of the College.

(2) If a student has an adverse reaction to any drug he should
'0 or his friends should take him directly in Ihe emergency room
Of Grinnell General Hospital — West. Local doctors Ire insistent
upon this point. The College does not have the staff or the facilities

Bdilﬁ Pal/{Y S REVISEE

President Glenn Leggett to-
day issued a supplementary
statement to the Student Hand-
book ”designed to describe the
general procedures by which
the college will implement its
established position on the ille-
gal drug problem."

“I believe this supplementary
statement, which is effective as
of this date, provides us with a
defensible position and a useful
series of procedures for sup-
porting it," Leggett said in a
cover letter released with the
statement,

STATEMENT “lMPERFECT”

Citing the complexity of the
drug problem, Leggett called
the statement “imperfect" and
emphasized that it is subject to
revision as “events and Continu-
ing discussion” make it neces:
sary.

“My essential problem in
writing the statement was to
express all the obligations of
the college in the fairest man-
ner,” Leggett told the 5&3
earlier this week.

Leggett issued the statement
following recent actions by the
deans in three unrelated cases
of student drug involvement.
In those cases, two students
were placed on conduct pro-
bation alter being treated for
adverse reactions to illegal
drugs, and another student
who was allegedly dealing in
mescaline voluntarily withdrew
from the college after consulta-
tion with the deans.

Encouraging students w i t h
drug problems to use the coun-
selling services provided by the
college, Leggett pledged in the
statement that the college will
protect the privacy of students
who seek help,

“They will be given all the
private and confidential help

the college can provide, and
this confidentiality will be re-
spected,” Leggett emphasized.

However, Leggett also said
that the college will take action
“if there is alleged to be Sub-
stantial knowledge that a stu~
dent is using any kind of illegal
drug in the residence halls or
on campus." The statement
outlines the general procedures
the college will follow in deal-
ing with students it suspects of
involvement with illegal drugs.

SEEK MEDICAL All)

Leggett recommended in the
statement that students suffer-
ing from adverse drug reac-
tions be taken directly to the
emergency room of Grinnell
HospitaleeSt and not to the
Health Center, which is made
qualely equipped to handle
such problems,

The president also cautioned

that students should not try to
administer antidotes or rem-
edies oi their own when they
find a fellow student Complains
ing of adverse drug effects.

Warning of the legal hazards
of drug involvement, Leggett
said that the college cannot
protect involved students from
legal consequences if civil
authorities decide to make in<
vestigations on campus.

In an interview last Tuesday,
Leggett expressed c o n c e r it
about Grinneli’s growing drug
problem. “Evidently we have

_ some hardcore users," he said.

“There's no doubt about it

Citing the many difiiculties
involved in handling the drug
problem, Leggett commented,
“The only easy solution is for
students not to use drugs, but
that's no solution because they
do use them,"

Senate Names Dog College Mascot

By ii Siaff Writer

The college that last year pro-
duced the world’s first male
homecoming queen has now
adopted a peacetiik pooch as its
mascot.

“Tory Pioneer," a big,
brown hound owned by student
senator William Stranger, was
appointed by the senate to fill
the Office of Grinnell College
Mascot late Tuesday night.

The senate allotted $15 for the
construction of Tory Pioneer's
dog house, and an additional
$5 to pay [or mascot food.

Tory Pioneer may be the
world's iirst canine pacifist. ACs
cording to the dog's owner, Tory
suffered a broken rear leg last
year when a police car ran into
him at a peace vigil.

Stranger said that ever since
his traumatic runsin with the
law, Tory has dedicated his life
to radical activism

“Tory Pioneer would like to
ilee many reforms made at Grin-

nell," Stranger told the see.
“He wants to have an allspet
coeducational dorm, and he is
very concerned about the ab-
sence of tirehydrarits on cam«
pug”

According to Stranger, the
four-year-old hound is “half Af-
ghan and half wolf, but he inher-
ited the tamer traits of his Af-
ghan mother."

bitch, likes maids, students, and
other breeds of people.

   

year by student Senators Mich-
ael Brandon and Daniel Clleifetz.
Their appearance at a May fa-
culty meeting touched off a de-
bate among the faculty which
was inconcluswe, since it came
at such a late point in the year.

Brandon and Cheiletz's origin-
al proposal was that some stu<
dents be allowed to attend all
faculty meetings, and, if rc-
cognized by the chair, to spealt
at the meetings. At the time, the
proposal was in a very general
form, requesting support of the
principle that students should be
permitted to attend iaculty
meetings, which are now closed
to them. The proposal passed
by an overwhelming voice vote
in the session in which it was
introduced The question then
was reduced to the problem of
deciding how many students
would be allowed to attend the
meetings, and how those stur
dents would be selected.
in the last faculty meeting oi
last year, President Leggett in-
structed the Committee on Fa-
culty Organization to work on a
proposal tor the specincs oi stu-
dent admission to faculty meet-
ings. The report of Mr. Betts‘
meeting, was the response to
Leggeit's instructions.

The recommendations were
that ten student representa-
tives should have the right to
participate in, and vote at, any
regular faculty meeting; that
they would be given one vote
each, and that the ten would
include 9 students elected at-
large, plus the SGA president.
Probably the most controver-
sial mandate was that voting
privileges be given to the stu-
dents, sinea the basin idea
that students would be allowed
to attend faculty meetings. a:
