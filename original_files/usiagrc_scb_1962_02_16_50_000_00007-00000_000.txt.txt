fourth place in the Conference.

The Oles and Carts were pick}
ed to finish first and second in‘
season polls, But both the Mini,
rtesota squads got off to Very,
poor staits and were soon cult
of the conference race.

However, in their last few,
.games they have started to playl
ball like title contenders. Last
week they raised their,1eague
records to 7.5 by defeating
illirdsplacc Cornell, and Bcioit
Shich was then in fourth place.
Carleton beat Cornell new and
Beloit 63-59 while St. Olaf was
knocking off Beloit 73435 and
Cornell 83-65. ,
f Since both the was and-
Chris have to play Gl'innell
and secolld»plnce Monmouth,
these contests could put the
Northfielil schools right in the
’tliiclt of the title race.

Carleton, averaging 71.2 points
a game on offense and 57.2
points‘a game defense, is led by
she conferences third leading!
scorer Cave Current, who has
been pouring in 17.3 markers
per contest.

1 Karl Groth is second in the
scoring racc. averaging LTJI,
points per game. He spearheads
the St. Olaf attack which has
been scoring 70 points a game
illile holding opponents to 67.4. ,

GrinnelL fresh from (he stDl‘Y;I '

team that Coach John Pl‘ifzch
ails potentially the best team
in the Conference, will be ready
for the upset—minded Minneso—

and the most well—balanced at.
tack in the league, the Pioneers
have five men averaging be,
tween ten and 15 points a game‘
—Bob Musser at 14.. Georgei
Gray at 13.2, Jim Mifflin at 12.5,
and Denny Asby and John Sun-
dell at 10.

In addition to the five above, i
Bill Parsons, hero of the ,
