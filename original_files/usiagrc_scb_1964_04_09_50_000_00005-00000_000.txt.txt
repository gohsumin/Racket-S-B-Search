Ouiet Efficiency Qualities Shriver.
World Symbol of Peace. Progress

By Linda Neal

Because the assignments give
In to Sargent Shriver have
characteristically been Com-
pleted quietly, with unobtrusive
eriiciency, few people realize
the extent and diversity of his

background and experience.
Shriver is best known for the

organization and direction of

the late President Kennedy's

SHRIVER

Peace Corps. What is not wide<
Iy known, however, is his per
sonal sponsorship, guidance,
and committment to the Corps.
Taking on the responsibility for
its passage, he met with 363
Congressmen and Senators to
discuss why it was needed and
how it would operate,

With the help of Vice-Presi—
dent Johnson, Shriver discour-
aged Congressional efforts to
attach the Corps to the for-
eign aid bill, and to associate
it with the United States Diplo»
matic Corps, feeling that such
political a n d nationalistic
strings would defeat the pur-
pose of a separately conceived
peace organization. With such
optimistic realism, he ever-
came deep Congressional skep»
ticism to garner the second
largest margin of victory for
an administration proposal:
59732 in the Senate, and 283-
97 In the House.

He then went on to devote
himself wholeheartedly to its
success, making decisions rang-
ing from publicity literature,
to the texts to be used in train-
ing volunteers, and traveling
to SI countries in Central and
South America, Africa, Asia
and the Near East to make all
necessary arrangements tor the
Corps. During the past three
years, he has become intimate-
ly acquainted with the prob-
lems of these underdeveloped
nations and has come to sym-
bolize to these people man’s
desire for peace and progress,

The background of Sargent
Shriver is similarly character
ized by ability and public serv-
ice. Born in 1915 in Maryland,
he attended parochial schools,
and later Canterbury School in
Connecticut. He was admitted
to both Yale University and
Yale Law School on scholar-
,ships. and Was graduated from
lithe latter cum laude in 1938,

During the summers of ’31, '38,
and '39 he led groups of stu-
dents through Fronce and Ger—
many on the Experiment in In-
ternational Living plan, reflect-
ing his deep interest in the
non-American societies of the
world.

On his return from World
War II, Shriver was offered the
Assistant General Manager-
ship of Joseph Kennedy's new~
ly acquired Chicago Merchan-
dise Mart. There he re-organ-
ized the administration of the
Mart, and sought out new
and more internationally di-
verse tenants. After working
ior two years with Eunice Ken-
nedy on the Citizens Committee
on the Control and Prevention
of Juvenile Delinquency, under
the auspices of the Attorney
General, he returned to Chica-
go to become associated with
the administration and fund-
raising of twenty-five educa-
tional, hospital, cultural, wel-
fare, and charitable groups.

In 1955 he was selected as the
President of the Chicago Board

‘of Education, a position he held

until his resignation in 1960.
During that time, he quintupled
publicrschools construction, cut
costs by 17 per cent, up-graded
the school curricula, and suc-
Cessfully lobbied school board
measures through a reluctant
Illinois legislature.

Shriver's importance in John
Kennedy’s 1960 c a m p a i g n
stemmed from his work on
Chicago's Catholic Interracial
CounCll. He and some Negro
friends set up a special civil
rights division, aimed at the
urban Negro, It was his con<
cern that prompted Kennedy to
call the Martin Luther King
family upon King's arrest and
imprisonment.

, Constant effort, and consist-
ently high quality of achieve-
ment in projects undertaken
have earned Shriver wide
praise from Congress and
those with whom he has
worked. This attitude recently
manifested itself in the appr0<
priation of $100 million for the
Corps, an increase of $70 mil-
lion and 10,000 volunteers from
1961; and President Johnsons
appointment of him to head the
Office of Economic Opportun<
ity. In this capacity, Shriver
would be ”directly responsible”
for the new programs in John-
son’s war against poverty, even
though it would "extend his au—
thority into a variety of Cabi-
net dcpartments.” President
Johnson speaks of him as "one
of the most brilliant, most able,
and most competent officials
in government. I regard him as
one or my real confidants."

, While not feeling “equipped:
to classify himself as an intel-
lectual, he describes himself
as “liberal in concern and phil»
osophy.” This Concern can be
seen in the fact that he and his
wife, Eunice, raised three fos-
ter daughters sent to them by
the Chicago Juvenile CourtI in
addition to their own four chil-
dren, The content of his philo-
sophy can be best judged by
his actions, which ‘speak loud-

 

er tlian words.’

Robert Kennedy, Democratic Vice-Presidential Possible,
Characterized as Determined, Knowledgable, Experienced

Robert Francis Kennedy was
born on November 2|), 1925. in
Brookline, Massachusetts. He
lived for a brief period in New
York attending public school
in Bronxville. but his father
then moved to London as the

KENNEDY

United States. Ambassador and
Robert attended successively
the Gibbs School in London,
Portsmouth Priory in Rhode
Island, and Milton Academy in
Massachusetts. From there he
went to Harvard, and finally to
the University of Virginia for
his LLB degree.

Upon graduation from the
law school in Virginia, Kennedy
went straight to work for the
government. He spent seven
months working for the Justice
Department and otherwise has
worked only as counsel for
Congressional committees. In
his words, “I never even cone
sidered anything else.” In 1353
he was hired by the Hoover
Commission investigating the
reorganization of government,
but after a year joined Senator
McCarthy's committee as min-
ority counsel.

Then in 1055, the Democrats
won control of the Senate and
John McClellan of Arkansas
became the committee chair
man. With Kennedy now enter
counsel, che committee first hit
pay dirt with the Harold Tal-
bott and Robert T. Ross con-
flict - of - interest cases. In the
process of investigating govern-
ment contractors. Kennedy
learned of their payoffs to labor
union chiefs. He was intrigued
by labor-management collusion
and went into the subject more
deeply. As a result, the Senate
set up a special committee,
Withr McClellan in command
and Kennedy as counsel, to con-
centrate on this chicanery.

All this made Kennedy a na-
tional figure and brought him
before the public by means of
newspapers, television, and his
best selling book, “The Enemy
Within” which dealt with his
efforts on the Rackets Commit—
tee.

In 1980, after successfully
managing his brother's presi-
dential campaign, he was ap-
pointed to the position of Attor-
ney General. In this capacity
Kennedy displayed his deter—
mination to be successful ill
whatever he undertakes, Im-

mediately he lobbied for new

anti-racketeering laws in Con-
gress_and set up a 54 lawyer
unit to coordinate reports from
the 26 United States investiga-
tive agencies on organized
crime.

He prodded the Internal Rev-
enue intelligence to boost its
time allotment for pursuing
racketeers from four to 47 per
cent, and as a result, racketeelu
ing prosecutions in 1562 were
up 700 per cent over 1960, con-
vtctions were up over 400 per
cent, and 92 civil anti-trust
suits were filed which was an
all-time high. In addition price
fixing indictments were ob-
tained against or companies
and 154 individuals, and the
number of active cases to win
Negroes the vote has quadru-
pled in two years and 23 voting
rights lawsuits have been filed
in strategic positions.

Kennedy’s experience is not
limited to just the above men-
tioned examples, however, De-
scribed by U. S. News St World
Report as "grass roots ambas-
sador to everywhere” and as
knowing" better than any other
member of the administration
what makes people tick in
many capitals far from Wash-

ington,” his duties weren't just
limited to the JustiCe Depart-
ment, He has debated with the
Japanese Communists, helped
to settle the Dutch Indonesian
dispute over West New Guinea,
played a vital role in the furor
over an increase in steel prices,
made a flying trip to Brazil to
discuss her economic crisis
with President Joao Goulart,
took a critical part behind the
scenes in the Cuban prisoner
ransom and directed the, ad-
ministration’s planning on
youth employment and delin-
quency. culminating in the pro-
posal for a domestic Peace
Corps.

Robert E Kennedy has shown
himself to possess a great Varie<
ty of political experiences. a
proven national record, and an
intense dedication to whatever
he undertakes.
