Thincluds Third
Against SUI, Purdue

By Jim Fish

Grinnell’s indoor track team
finished third last Saturday in
a triangular meet against the
University of Iowa‘and Purdue
University. The ﬁnal
found Iowa on top with 72;
points, Purdue second With 65
points and Grinnell third with
27 points.

According to Grinnell
Coach Dick Young, “The
squad as a whole did a fair-
ly good job for this early
in the season. The team had
only been working out for
two weeks. I consider this
month as our conditioning
month and the team appeared
to be in pretty good shape
for this early in the season."
Coach Young was especially
pleased with the performances
of Bruce Beckord, Ron Sella-
Chel, Mike Dewitt, John Sut-
ton, John TePaske, Jim Mil-
ler, and his high jumpers, Mike
Fox, and Tom Wood.

Beckord finished third in the
440 yard dash with a time of
:50.3, only three tenths of a
second off the winning time o!
:50 by Iowa’s Gary Hollings-
worth, last year's Big Ten
quarter mile champ.

Sophomore Jim Miller tossed
the shot 47 feet, two inches,
only a foot less than the Grin-
nell College record.

Coach Young also was
pleased with the performance
of his mile relay team of
Schachel, Jeri Langham, Te-
Paske, and Beckord, which,
although placing third, ran
the mlle ln 14:29.7, only a little
more than a second off the
Midwest Conference record.
Coach Young added‘ that
these early meets help him to
find the right combinations and
that the real season doesn't
Start until the Midwest Confer
ence Indoor Meet, March 71h.
The Pioneer Thinclads travel
tomorrow to Drake Universrty
in Des Moines where they will
meet several other Iowa col-
leges in an invitational meet.

Let's stop criticizing the boys

yelling about the quality of the
referees in lM Hasketball.

The Officials have a tough

try it for yourself. Why is it
always those who prefer not to
officiate who yell the loudest?

Officiating has always been
Iomewhat of a problem. This
year there is a new rule that
states a hall will lose its entry

points if they fail to provide
referees. The role of an official
should not be seen as an obliga-
tion to the hell, but to the SLIC-
cess of the 1M program. So
let’s stop criticizing the refs

gist is likely to tell you that
you're just projecting on to
others the dissatisfaction you
have toward yourself.

It is still early in the Bas-

teams to beat are East, West,

By Ken Clymer

The Pioneer wrestlers ex-
tended their winning streak to

Saturday the Pioneers met a'
strong St. Olaf squad in a
match which went down to the
wire. Barnes began the match
by downing Rundell 4-3 and was
followed by Ken Strubler, who
won by forfeit. However, the
Oles came back with wins in

the next two matches to tie the
score.

Will Van Horne, 157 pounder,_
defeated his Oles opponent 74
and set the stage for a 53 sec«
and pin by Pioneer Larry Mll-
ler, his tenth victory of the
season in as many attempts.
