Scholarships awarded to Grinneil

. Air Force ROTC cadets this fall

will be based primarily on skills

needed by the Air Force, according

to Major Albert C. Omer (new
space studies).

“Financial assistance grants will

be used to attract high quality stu-

dents with particular skills and

abilities of use to the Air Force,"
said Major Omer.

with the exception of the few
scholarships to selected senior
cadets, scholarships will again go
to cadets entering the third year of
the four-year Air Force ROTC pro-
gram. Other minimum qualiﬁca-
tions include a grade point aver-
age or at least 2.5, a 30 percentile
score on the Air Force Officer
Qualifying Test, full physical qual-
ifications, and personal and moral
nttributes expected of Air Force
officers.

Scholarships are made to the in-
dividunl cadet because of his per-
formance and qualifications. He

he transfer to a ditferent school so
long as he remains tully qualified.
His status will be reviewed each
term to determine whether he con-
tinues to be fully qualified.

Initial nominations will he made
by the selection board lat Grinnell.
The board will consist of Air Force
ROTC officers and school officials.

These nominations will be tor-
warded to AFROTC headquarters
where a central selection board
will dete mine the final scholar-
ship recipients on a best quaiitied
basis. Selected cadets will be no-
tiiied not later than May 15 by Air
Force ROTC. Those not selected by
the central board will be consid
ered as alternates for primary selr
lectees, or for scholarships which
may be later vacated by primary
selectees.

Major Omer commented, "Next
year we expect to award at least
two Air Force ROTC scholarships
with a possibility of more. Each
scholarship will pay full tuition
costs, books and fees, and 9° per
