SCARLET AND BLACK

[tigers Begin Drills for Opener

By Peter Kollman

The Grinnell basketball team
ls readying for its opening
games on December 6th and
7th when they travel to Wis-
consin to oppose Lawrence and
defending champion Ripon.

The Pioneers have seven let<
termen returning from last
year’s fourth place teaml Lead-
ing the group are seniors Jim
Mifflin and John Sundell. Miff-
lin, a 6—4 forward, was one of
the conferences | e a din g
scorers last year; his great
ability on offense caused op»
ponents to build their defenses
to stop him.

Sundell, 6-8 and the Pioneer
center, is not as potent an
offensive threat as Mifflin,
but is fast, excellent on do»
fense and very tough on the
boards.

Also lettering last year
were juniors Dave Sellegren,
‘nandy Morgan, Dick Ulrich,
Clyde Smith and Tom nuck-
holtz.

games last year and the other
four saw plenty of action in re-
serve roles. Rounding out the
squad are junior Barry Ander-
son and sophomores Gordon
Kin k e a d, Ted Risser, Jeff
Frantz, Bill Landsberg, Tom
Lane, Al Peterson and Phil
Coons.

A c c or din g to basketball
coach John Pfitsch, the key
1055 from last year's squad was
“in O s i; valuable basketball
player” Gar Smith, also win-
ner of the Dave Theophilus
Trophy, given to the outstand-
ing senior athlete. “We have
players who have Smith's phys-
ical ability and more, but Gar’s
main asset was not physical.

He was the most poised athlete
I’ve ever seen at Grinnell.”

Pfitsch stated that the oth-
er two seniors on last year‘s
team, Kent Rogerson and
Denny Asby, did not have
especially good years and
thus their contribution to last
year’s team would not be as
hard to replace as Smith’s.

Pfitsch emphasized that the
lack of depth at center and the
uncertainty of a replacement
for Gar Smith were his main
problems and felt that if he and
his team could adequately
solve them, they would be con-
tenders for the conference
championship.

ord with wins over Simpson,

weight class, had a 1 l 1 sea-
son record. Co- -captain Van

pound class. finished the dual

ordi Co-captain Al Mac-

 

knight placed third in the 131

Although another 1M football season has ended the in-
convenience and pain from some of the injuries suffered during
it are still being felt. Realizing that some of these injuries are
to be expected due to the nature of the game, one is still led to
wonder why the number remains high or increases every year.
Inquiry into this problem leads directly to a second question:
ls there something that can be done about it?

Escaping the problem by dropping 1M football, as was done
in the 205 is certainly no answer. Banning the program's
most popular sport would probably be committing 1n-
tramural suicide. Extra padding or compulsory practices forc-
ing players to get into shape are also unleasable when one ob-
jectively looks at the IM football jock.

Therefore we must examine each area of injuries, and
by attacking them separately, find some place in which im-
provement is possible. The first step in this direction oc-
curred several years ago when castoff varsity helments
were given to the 1M program. According to John c. Tmes-
dale (men’s physical education), head injuries became so
frequent that the sport was in danger of being eliminated if
something was not done.

While helmets reduced the number of head and facial in.
juries significantly, the rate at which they continued to occur
is alarming in relation to all other afflictions Every fall about
35 athletes are hurt participating in IM football seriously enough
to report to the nurse and see a doctor. These generally cost
the insurance company in the neighborhood of 51000, the total
for the 1962 8935011 being 3960144, (The size of the total is the
result of the one or two serious shoulder and/or knee disloca.
tions every year, costing several hundred dollars apiece). Of
these, one third are localized above the neck and the number
of nose bleeds and split lips not reported that would skyrocket
this total is anybody s guess For these ailments. just under $100
is payed out in insurance money The Ramsey Inurance Agency
parted with $89 for ten facial injuries last season and $96 for
the same number the year before.

The solution to this is really not so difficult, since a simple
plastic-bar face guard would eliminate probably so per cent or
the facial injuries. When someone falls down, the bar would hit
the ground, not the nose or mouth. It would also ward off the oc-

 

casional flying fist or elbow.

(NEXT WEEK: Cost and availability of face guards,
and comments of interested persons.)
