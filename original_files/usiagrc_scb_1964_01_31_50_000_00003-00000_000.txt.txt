Pioneers

By Peter Kolln-ian

Grinnell’s basketball team
was upset by Monmouth here
last Saturday, 83-79. The Scots,
whose 2-5 record was in con-
trast to the Pioneers’ 8-2, led ‘
50-39 at the half. The upset was
all the more unusual because it
occurred on Grinnell’s floor in
a conference where a home

loss by one of the title contend:
ers is almost unheard of.

The Scots, who hit 14 of their
first 17 shots from the field,
jumped off to a lead they never
relinquished. They cooled off
slightly after that but were
shooting at a 55% clip when

CARLET AND BLACK

With hopes of brightening
slightly dimmed title chances,
Grinnell’s basketball team will
try to get back on the winning
track Saturday night when it
plays host to (Joe at 7l30 in
Darby Gym.

After last weekend‘s upset
loss to Monmouth, the Pioneers
are now in third place in the
Midwest Conference with a 3-2
mark, two games back of lead-
ing Ripon. Coe, coming on
strong of late with tremendous
scoring power, is 3-5 in league
play.

Shooting has been the main
order of business for the Pio-

week, after hitting only 31 per
cent of 106 shots in tho Mon-
mouth loss.

“We just have to start
shooting better, that is all,”
Pi‘itsch says. “We still have
a lot of spirit—after all, we
came back from 17 points
down midway through the
second half. With a couple
breaks, we could have won.”
Pfitsch plans no lineup

changes for this one against
Coe, the 94th meeting between
the two schools. However, it il
a foregone conclusion that Tom
Buchholtz will see more action
after his fine relief effort Sat-

they went to the dressing room
at halftime.

The Pioneers, definitely mis-
sing their best shooter and lead-
ing scorer Gordon Kinkead,
who was declared academically
ineligible the previous week,
were exceptionally cold from
the field, hitting only 29% of
their shots. The fact that the
half-time score was as close as
it was was due largely to the
board work of center John Sun-
dell, who hauled in 12 rebounds
in the first 20 minutes of play,

When the second half started,
the Scots took over where mey
had left off, upping their mar-
gin to 17 points, 77-60, with if!
minutes to play. During this
time, the Scots shot ”only”
45%, but did a much better job
on their defensive board, prer
venting the still—cold Pioneers
from getting more than one or
two shots at a time,

Grinnell dominated the final
13 minutes of play and in the
process cut the Monmouth mar
gin to its final 4 points. In the
minute and a half after the
Seots had amassed their largest
margin, the Pioneers cut it
down to ll points. Monmouth
then went into a semiestall,
waiting for a high-percentage
shot and taking it, This kept
their lead around 10 points until
about 5 minutes remained.

Then, Grinnell led by the
shooting of Buchholtz, nar»
rowed the margin and came
within 3 points of catching the
Scots.

Leading the Pioneer stor-
ing were co-captains Jim Miff-
lin‘ and John Sundell with 10
and 18 points, respectively. Slin-
dell also hauled in 25 rebounds

83-79.

Freshmen Lose lo Monmouth

By Don Kurasch

Grinnell's freshman basket-
ball squad suffered a 79-75 set-
back at the hands of a Wellvbalr
anced Monmouth team. The
lead in last Saturday’s game
changed places so many times,
it seemed the win would go to
whomever happened to be
ahead when time ran out.

What would have been a two-
point lead at halftime became
a 3949 tie when Monmouth’s
Bob Pogue connected with only
three seconds left Pogue, a
6'5” center and forward, domi-
nated the rebounding for most
of the game.

A standout performance
was given by Grinnell guard

Elliot Hibbs, whose record

setting 34 points accpunted
for nearly half the frosh total.
The only other Grinnellian to
score with double figures was
Tom Hill, who connected for
16.

High scorer for Monmouth
was Don Carlson, who racked
up 21 points. Monmouth‘s better
balance was evident in the
scoring column, with a total of
[our players hitting in double
figures. Pogue scored 12; Bob
Ellis and‘.,Dennis Rusk scored
19 and ”respectively

The loss was the second in
three starts for the yearlings.
Tomorrow night the team will
try to even out their win-loss
record when they meet Coe at
5 pm. in Darby.
