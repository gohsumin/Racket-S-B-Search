and chants of "Power to The People" and
"Off the Pig." After about an hour
wait the crowd began to get nervous,
wondering if anyone else was going to
come. "This is an awful small group to
start a revolution," commented one hel—
meted student from Oregon.

Three defendents in the Conspiracy
trial were in the park —— Tom Hayden,
Abbie Hoffman, and John Froines. Hayden
told the rally "people have been saying
the Conspiracy 8 are against this dem—
onstration. That is not true. While
there are some differences among the '8',
we are all united in the need to intensfy

Between 9:h5 and 10:15 two more groups the struggle to end the war."

30 members. They marched up to the hon—

F33HTING ON THE STREET:

"We are glad to see people back in
Lincoln Park. We are glad to see the

Weathermen attack a Gold Coast resident as he tries

to protect his car. His mother (partly obscured by man in white jacket)

the crowd electrified. As they broke
into a run, now shouting and scream—

of the streets and in parked cars,
police watched with incredulous
expressions. One officer gasped,

A squad of about to plain—
