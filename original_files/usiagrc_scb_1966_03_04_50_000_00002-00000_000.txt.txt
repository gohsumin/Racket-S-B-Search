The ‘Ad Hoc' Committee

Tentative appointments to President Leggett’s Ad Hoc,
Committee on Hall Reorganization were made this week. The ,

appointments now await Leggett’s approval. The three facul-
ty members named to the committee by chairman of the
committee, associate dean Richard Winters, are Luther Erick-
son (chemistry). R. Homer Norton (history). and Henry-York

Steiner (English) The students named to the committee byl

Jerry Goddard, SGA president, are Steve Kent, SGA president-
elect, Karen Lauterbach, AWS Board presidentelect, and
Bob Foote, CofHP president-elect.

As soon as this committee is approved and meets it will
receive from the Executive Council of the faculty a series of
proposed changes in the housing system. it is upon these
proposals that the committee will act. From these proposals
they will make recommendations to President Leggett. The
nature of these proposals will be of great interest to the en-
tire campus and when they are released it is hoped that the
student representatives on the Ad Hoc committee Will make
a real effort to consult with the students as a whole about

the recommendations.

The working of this Ad Hoc committee should, by all in-

dications, be a very difficult

task. President Leggett, who

called the committee together, has committed himself to
some sort of change in the housing system. He has gone on
the record as saying that “there is excessive moral neutrality
in the residence hall system” and that it lacks the “flexibility

it needs. Leggett has also indicated that the Executive Coun-
cil, which is making the proposals that will be the Ad Hoc com-
mittee’s raw material, feels that ”anti-intellectualisin is pretty

prevalent on Nolth Campus."

0n the other hand, the student members are just as firm-
ly committed to the opposite stands In a letter to the_editor
on October 8, 1965, SGA president-elect StevegKent said that
“Personally I have no gripes with the present hall’systern and
I think there is much to recommend it.” Foote, i_n asimilar
way, feels that the present system should be maintained ~‘
and said so while campaigning for CofHP president.

How this conflict is resolved should be interesting. i
think the Ad Hoe committee should keep the student body
posted on the progress it is making. This, after all, is a prob-
lem with which we’re all concerned.

To Study City During Break

”The Inner City Project is not
I social workers‘ convention," as-
rcrls Dennis Spencer, cochairman
oi the social action committee of
the Board of Religion.

“The students who participate
in the proiecl are not on a mission
to clean up the slums. They will
be going in order to become ac-
quainted wilh the poveriyslricken
sections at large ciries."

The program will take place' in
Chicago, Sr. Louis, and New York
over spring break, and Spencer in-
dicated lhai people who are inter-
ested in the program should con-
tact him or Charlene Ellis by
Tuesday.

Spencer emphasized that sui-
dents will have an opportunity to
go out on their own in who: he
called the “neighborhood plunge."

"They will have a chance to
really lalll with the people and un-
derstand their problems. With all
Lhe talk about the ‘secular city'
there is a growing concern about
the urban situation, The Inner City
Project provides the opporniniiy

 

lot students to leave their ivory
tower and gain an understanding
and appreciation of the problems
that face our society.”

In the ”neighborhood plunge”
studenls can go out on the streets
and just talk to people, or get a
job tor a day as a laborer and
work next lo the people they are
trying to know. Spencer told of
how two Gi'innellians, posing as a
married couple, wenr lrom door to
door last year telling landlords
rhey were looking lor an apartv
merit and talking to the people in
me buildings about living condir
tions and their outlook on life in
general.

One church in each city arranges
for living accommodations. and
while the students Work in a fairly
loose framework, there are planned
events such as a welfare tour, vis-
its to slum schools, and meeiings
w i t h community organizations.
Spencer said that students are ex-
pected to provide their own trails-
poriarion to die cities and should
bring about $25 spending money.

A curious question has arisen out oi the ashes,
dust and blood of Viet Nam. Those who have grown
used to taperrecorded screams, newsreel dismember-
menis and daily liveinch headlines are wondering
it, and those who can recall the joysome and full-
heurted spirit with which America pursued its com-
mitments in the great World Wars are asking it.
Has America become a nation or lilypanis?

Fanatics have long deplored a supposed decadence
in morality and courage, but only recently have
more educated bigots been arguing the same point.
Student prolesls and draft-card conflagrations and
other violent acts express oven hostility to the pres-
ent war effort, and some opinion polls have indicated
that even respectable people do not unanimously
consent to our great Leviathan's policies. Such eviv
dence lhen suggests that our brave soldiers also
would preler not to be in Viet Nam.

A Des Moines Register article from Valentine's
Day, l966, demonstrated dramatically the degenera-
tion from the “Over There!” spirit of WWI to the
modern altitude of “go away, unpleasant nasty
thing." in the Great War (related the article) the
military hierarchy had been so upset by a French
offer of licensed, inspected prostitutes for innocent
American doiighboys that ihey refused to let Presi-
dent Wilson even hear about such a “blatant pru«
position." preferring in let the dry rot take ils na-
tural toll along with the bombs and the bullets. TD<
day, on the contrary, we snicker lewdly and open-
ly at the rate of venereal disease in Viet Nam and
cynically note the fact that prophylactic manufac<
ture is now “essential industry."

What has caused the declenslon from former ideaL
ism and enthusiasm to present nihilism and weak
ness? Prior to World War II, America showed no
great desire to create unhappiness in the world, and
if it had not been (or Pearl Harbor, our wise leaders
would have graciously accepted the occupancy or
southeast Asia and Europe and the removal of six

million Jews on the principle of self-determination of
governments. i.e., any government can determine its
own action as long as they do not interfere with
our plans. Even unprovoked violence, indeed, was in.
sufﬁcient to maintain a natural furor and hatred of
our enemy for three years. and so periodic appeals
to the loathsome innate character of the enemy had
to be made.

while biologists have discovered nothing conclu-
sive about the relative merits of the various racial
and national groups, four district factors gave pl’e»
liminary indications that the Krauts and Nips were
interior classes. (1) They looked funny. (2) They
talked runny, (3) They acted runny, (4) They were
runny. The American public did not have to take the
word or some oilicial ptopagandizer for these iacis,
either, since simpla observations or Kraut and Nip
communities within America confirmed them.

The weakness of our Viet war effort must be ri-
diculously apparent by now. Namely this: There are
no Vietnamese in America to remind us or our
hatred, to congeal our blood in constant loathing,
to foster our outrage lhaz here is one possibility at
human existence that deserves to be exterminaleri
or expunged like a cancerous blight. Not one Viet
Cong shall survive. Then we will blast North Viet
Nam back to the Stone Age. And why slop there?
The South Vietnamese are no better — perhaps worse
tor presuming to our form of govemment — and
after they have aided our victory, they shall be
thanked with an appropriate nuclear devastation
Remember (lo paraphrase the great President wu-
son) — the world that is sales: for democracy is
one without people.

Enough is enough. The suggestion of the proper
attitude has been made. “Survival, security, surplus”
is the universal hierarchy by which to measure the
achievements of nations. and America alone has
gained the topmost rank. Let us not render our great
attainment of the iinal goal worthless by ignoring
and despising the two more basic values.

 

Grace Minutes Theory
Not Progress: Reichs

To the Editor:

Carls Go For 40 (Count ‘Eml Hours C
Di Opens a Week—With Closed Doors

is it possible to grant litieen
“grace minutes” in
approximately five in actuality?
The rider in the Senate bill indi-
cates it is. ii women are given
the grace minutes, but must of the
loggla doors are locked at 10:30
on weekends, rhe ones remaining
open being locked promptly at 12.
all the surplus minutes gained in
racing the night watchman to
Loose are gone. Now, besides main
ing lite dull for the night watch»
man, not in mention Grinnell's
suir sprinters, this idea seems to
,go against the theory of grace
minutes. The people needing grace
minutes are those coming in late;
those coming in late usually try
to make Loorc door; Loose door
is open later than the rest 01 lbs
loggia. if all doors lock promptly
at 12, the women may have
“gained" 15 grace minutes, but
they’ve also lost about half that
time by the door locking process.
This is progress?
Renate .i. Reich!

Locked Doors Policy

Prompts Questions

To the Editor:

Not only is the AWS board
romping backwards in its grace
minutes proposal, but it is drag-
ging everyone else with it! In n
time when responsible people are
striving ior a more liberal policy
on women’s hours. the group suu-
posedly representalive oi South
Campus has come up whh a fine
answer: more locked doors' it is

An expanded open house plan
has been drafted in a joint Carleton
student meeting. The meeting of
the Carleton Men’s League, Woin~
en's League, C.S.A., and me Board
of Proctors approved a proposal of
open houses in all dorms each al-
ternoon from I to 5 with closed
doors, extension of hours tn 7 p,m.
to 11:45 p.m. on Fridays, and 7
p.m. to [2:45 am. on Saturdays.
Dormitories may also choose by a
twothirds vote to have an extra
open house provided they give 2
list of signatures lrorn that dorm to
the dean forty-eight houis in ad-
Vance.

The proposal was submitted to
the StudentrFaculiy~Administration
Council for discussion a week ago.
ii the council approves the pro-
posal, lt will be submitted to the
Faculty — Administration — Tnlstee
Council for serious consideration
and perhaps modification.

An amendment to the proposal
providing the “option lor earlier
closing hours on a given open
house in an individual dorm basis"
removed the opposition of many
girls who ielt they would be incon-
venienced with the extended hours.

No WEEKEND HOURS

The principle or no hours on
weekends for senior women has
been approved by Coe’s Srudeni
Affairs Committee composed oi
iacully members. The AWS-spon~
sored proposal was approved by a
unanimous vole of the committee;
details will be Worked out later.

Coc's Dcan oi Women hopes to
pin the plan inio eilect in lime for.
its spring mm. The college only‘
needs lo iiiiri a proctor to be on

 

duty between the hours of 1 am.
and 6 am on Saturday and Sun-
day mornings. The idea of keys
for senior women was suggested
as an alternative but was rejected
by the AWS board bclore their
proposal even reached the com-
mittee.

REFUSE T0 AID DRAFT

A petition sponsoied by Antioch's
Students for a Democratic Society
urging that the college refuse to
cooperate with the Selective ServA
ice System in ranking male sui-
dents has been presented to An-
tioch’s Administrative Council. In
an SDS-sponsored meeting students
were told that uic college would be
acting “as or harm manager in n
slaughter house" in giving inlor—
mation to local draft boards.

in presenting the petition which
contained 186 student signatures
obtained over a [our-day period,
an SDS member demanded ihat
the college make a public state-
ment opposing Uls. policies in Viet
Nam. Several members of Anti-
Dch’s Administrative Council ex-
pressed doubt that they had his
authority to decide a college posh
lion on the war noting that even it
they had the authority, approwil or
the Board of Trustees would be
necessary.
