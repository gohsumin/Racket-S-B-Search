ture yesterday. told the Shit:
“Bringing these things out in
the open would be beneficial to
everyone involved, My only
rear would be that this might
harden Puritan minorities, and
then. perhaps, nothing would be
gained.”

Many responsible people, in-
cluding the reviewer tor the
5&3, do not agree with Meyer’s
contention that the controver-
sial scene in “The Chairs" so
seriously affected the audience
that they went away thinking
nothing else about the play. He
is entitled to his views, but he
must also allow Tor other opin-
ions. In eensoring the play he
closed the door on rational dis-
cussion.

We think a good edumtional
opportunity was lost when “The
Chairs" was censored. it the
matter had been approached in
an intellectual manner students
could have examined the issues
involved and learn a great deal.
Student directors could gain a
better idea how their audience
reacts on morally questionable
matters. The (acuity could offer
needed guidance. and could also
learn more about “student at.
litudes." Discussion would
also help everyone keep a clear
separation between the student
actor as a character on stage
and as a student they know per~
sonally. We do not believe that
students will be hurt by seeing
something controversial like
"The Chairs."

By eliminating censorship,
faculty and administration
would he spared oi the very
embarrassing and ethically dit<
ficult situation into which Mey<
er and SomerVille put each
other. M a n y knowledgeable
people think Meyer went to the
extreme or overruling another
faculty member because, as
his experience with “The
Knack” indicated, he had to
support the indeiinite but de-
cisive administration position
on obscenity. This is a deplor-
able situation and one that les-
sens stutlent respect ior all in-
Volved.

Some faculty members have
told the 5&3 that they are

"categorically opposed to any
censorship on campus." One
can only speculate what would
happen it a iaculty member
who takes [his stand becomes
involved in a situation like that
of “The Chairs."

We are of the opinion that the
basis oi the problem, and per-
haps the only reason that cen-
sorship still goes on here, is ad-
ministration and faculty cun-
cem for the “morally correct
and nonrcontroversial" image
oi Grinnell College.

Much oi the confusion and
contradiction of past dis
cussion on censorship has
resulted tram attempting to
bypass not only the question oi
what is the “good image” but
how permitting supposedly im-
moral works of art to exist here
effects that image.

These are questions that need
thought and discussion. We do
not think it would be very dil-
iicult to sell the ideas of “artis-
tic freedom” and “freedom of
the press" to the outside world
oi alumni, money givers, trus-
tees, parents, etc. We would
point to the administration’s
handling or the “drug issue" as
the type of constructive ap-
proach needed.

lt censorship on moral
grounds is eliminated the col-
lege need not fear a deluge of
obscene student art. We think
Grinnell students are sensitive
people. And when questionable
matters do arise, student and
iaculty criticism would act as
eflective restraints. As Meyer
told the 5&Bl “I believe that If
we had no censorship there
would be problems, but. this
would not matter in the long
