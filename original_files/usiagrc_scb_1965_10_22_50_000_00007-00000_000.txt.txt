Recent weeks have seen an ed-
ltying series of highly informative
articles concerning Grinnell, un-
illlder the above standard head

writersh You by now should be
tully aware of the state of Grin-
nell during the eras of your moth-
er, Grandfather, and greatruncle-
twiceremovedl i hope you've
caught our subtle editorial com-
ments, both the snide and the
profound Like, we’ve been trying
to tell you that things around here
don't change too much, and that
there is nothing new under the sun,
and such-like. In case not, here
we are again,

Five Years Ago

Something new, this week, how-
ever, . .0 look at the Grinneil we
ﬁrst heard of; the older genera»
tions of us, mat is. Grinnell may
or may not have meant much to
you live years ago, but it was
quite definitely here. And here too
were a lot of familiar-type sights
And gripes, and lot of things that
are now defunct—remembered on-
ly through the legends handed
down by Baffleboards and other
upperciassmen to this year's sen-
iors—with them to be lost or
preserved depending on the vaga—
ries 0t fate, and other eternal
tomes such as bad memories and
apathy. But there are always the
bound copies of the SH to keep
us informed, and to provide ﬁller
when there isn't eight pages of
new: going on in a week. . .

1960 was the year or the Nor-
rises, the construction at the line
art: building, and r new book-
store. The latter was hailed in
vol. 69, number 1 at the 5&3 for
its . .floar plan arranged by
one at the nation‘s foremost dc-
signers in this field.” That was on
page 1; page 4 featured a column
discussing the ins and out of the
honored Mr. Wassom’s distrust of
the student body of Grinnell. .
and nobody bothered to remember
the name of that foremost designv
er, either.

Hypocritieal Liberalily

Open dorms started their second
year of hypocritical liberaiity in
1960, and the first encampment
was held Discussion topics in-
cluded curriculum, an honor code.
religion, social life, and student-
faculty relations The language lab
was opened soon after the begin-
ning oi classes, and the “Covered
Wagon" entered the scene.

Campus problems were few in
1950, mostly dealing with the not-
qnite (mercifully) eternal prep
ping controversy. A large part oi
the Grinneii community that year
found the worldly affairs of the
nonsacademic community more
worthy of their concern. The
rest managed to create a comma
vorsy out of this participation in
world controversy. The 5&3 fea-
tured a political editor in 1960451,

 

and several columnists who found
man's rockets more worthy of
concern than the Rocket Man. The
Kennedy-Nixon campaign, disarm-
ament, and the Cuban invasion
were ample cause [or numerous
meetings, lectures, and picketing
both off campus and on, Even the
Military Ball was picketed.

Cracks in the cloistered walls
of Grinnell’s isolation came in
two now»unavailahle ways during
this yearl KGRW, the college‘s
own radio station, was still a go—
ing concern in those days. (It’s
last gasp, as l remember, was
the broadcast of the SGA conven.
tion in spring of 1963, after a year
of silence.) And there was B col-
iee house, No, it didn’t have glass
walls and an espresso machine of
scandalous expense. It had i. small
cellar in downtown Grinneil,
sandwiches and most coffee-house
type beverages, And folk-singers,

like a part of the real world: and
with BEATNIKS, even.

sounds better than we) present

“Hill sweat shirts are in; laden
coats are out. Green book bags
are still in, and red ones are det-

attempts to change the situation.
Black knee socks are out except
on very cold days when they’re
in.

“Soccer is in, but football is tool
chess and fencing will always be
out; likewise beards (except when
you've just returned from Europe

- and they augment the role).

“Drinking beer at the Rex is

Friendship with faculty members

liberal arts college cannot be all
things to all men and still keep
its integrity of locus and purpose,"
Leggett continued.

The president's speech was en»
titled "The College President as
1 Parent." He began by describing
a typical freshman boy who comes
troll: is relatively secure home en-
vironmeut to the uncertain atmos-
phere of college lite.

President Leggett said, “The
truth is that a college, partly by
accident and partly by tradition
and design, serves as a catalyst,
as an agent for bringing the odds
and ends of emerging maturity
and its correlated confusions and
irustrations to a focus,”

The president reassured parents
by saying, “lt seems to me that
the essential usefulness of parents
increases as their day-hy»day cone
trol over their college-age children
decreases."

In conclusion. President Leggelt
stated, “A college president who
does his job properly looks at a
student through many eyes—
teacher. parent, institutionalist,
emissary tor the future.

“AS a teacher he is interested
in helping the student grow into
discipline and competence; as a
parent he wants to find an ex»

sees the student as part of an
