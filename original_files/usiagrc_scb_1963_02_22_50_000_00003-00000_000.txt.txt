At. a recent meeting or the

To the Editor:
“So like I was sayinl. i was
having to wall: backwards all
the way through the lunch line
today. Now I tranltly don’t mind
ridin’ taeing the wrong way in
the subway, but standing back—
wards in line, that l mind,"

"So what's your problem, hon»

“So it’s about this couple, one
boy. and concomitantly one girl,
what was standin' in (rent or
me.”

“So I think i know the type
you're relei'rin’ to. The type, you
might say, what you see in a
B-rate movie, except live,”

“Yeah - at Main door, like I
always say, — well you know me
and Charlie Howevah, in
the lunch line, that's something
else."

“So to some extents i can take
it, but you have to direct your
line at vision to the ceiling in
order so you won't be embar—
rassed,"

“So you girls think you’ve got
problems! Today 1 found myself
in the passionate and obviously
misdirected embrace of someone
i didn’t even know. Now

S.G.A. President in Boston—
The question is what role will
students accept in regard to the
rule. The administration has
delegated to the students the
power to regulate the student»
living units,

Is there any interest in rc-
responsibiiity, or is increased
liquor consumption the main
interest? The S.G.A. is under
taking with the cooperation of
interested students a general
evaluation or the campus. The
students are evaluating currie-
uiuin. admi ion policies, and
the liquor rule.
