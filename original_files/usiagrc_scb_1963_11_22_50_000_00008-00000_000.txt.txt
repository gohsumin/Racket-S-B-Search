Senate Votes to Limit
Student Car Possession

By Wade Stevenson

After a heated debate Wed~
nesday, the Senate passed on
an amendment to the proposed
‘nr rule by Al Gummerson.
The amendment limited the po-
lession of cars to seniors,

Gummerson stated that ”it is
necessary to use the rule sys-
tem to maintain an egalitarian
atmosphere at Grinnell.” He

lso mentioned that ”the at-

ractiveness of the Grinnell
ommunity is its unrealistic at-
osphere." Gummerson pic<
red Grinnell as a unique com-
unity which . might be de-
ﬁlroyed it more cars were in-
troduced. '

ident, took exception to Gum-

merson’s remarks. wishing
to destroy the myth that
Grinnell is a unlque close-
knit community, Chapman
stated that “at times people
must get away from the col-
legal"

The amendment passed by a
margin of one vote and the
Senate, in order to determine
studeilt opinion on the entire
car rule, postponed the debate

on the rule in its entirety until
the next regular senate meet—
ing.

George Forrest, C‘ of HP
representative, announced that
those men interested in serving
on the Men's primary Court

They believed the fatal
shots were fired by a white
man. about 30, slender of
build, weighing about 165
pounds, and standing 5 feet
10 inches tall.

The murder weapon was
reportedly a 30-30 rifle.

Shortly before Kennedy‘s
death became known, he
was administered the last
rites of the Roman CathO‘
lic Church. He had been the
first Roman Catholic presi-
dent in American history.

Even as two clergymen
hovered over the fallen Pres-
ident in the hospital emer-
gency room, doctors and
nurses administered blood
transfusions.

Kennedy died of a gunshot
wound in the brain at ap-
proximately 1 pm. (CST) ac-
cording to an announcement
by acting White House press
secretary Malcolm Kilduif.

don Johnson, and his wile

later. Newsmen had no op-
portunity to question them.

president in office since
Franklin D. Roosevelt died

. of a cerebral hemorrhage at
Worm Springs, 6a., in April
1945.

Though Mrs. K e n no dy

and despair after her hus«

When he entered the hos-

pital, her clothing was cov-
ered with blood from her
husband’s wounds.

Lt. Erich Kaminskl of the
Secret Service said the assas-

have been a “highpowered
Army or Japanese rifle of
about .25 caliber.” The rifio
had a scope on it, he said.

The entire building where
the sniper was located was
evacuated. People were
working in the building at the
time of the shooting.

Dallas inspector .l. n,
Sawyer Said, “Police found
the remains of fried chicken
and paper on the fifth floor.
Apparently the persons had
been there quite awhile."

After the fatal shots were
fired at Kennedy, the strick-
en President’s Secret Serv-
ice driver raced away from
the scene at top speed _.
heading for the nearest hos-
pital and trying to get the
presidential party out of
range of further gunfire.

Kennedy, Oonnally and
their wives had been riding
together in the President’s
familiar dark blue, bubble-
top convertible. The trans<
parent plastic roof of the vo<
