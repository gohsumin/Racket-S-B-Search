Campus Unrest

At the 48th annual meeting oi the American:
Council on Education last week in Washington, DC,
the main topic of concern was the proper role of stu-i
dents in the formation of university policy.

Two years ago on the Grinnell campus the main
topic of concern was the proper role of students in the
formation of college policy.

College administrators at the ACE meeting were
divided as to how much say the students ought to have.
One college president, for example, felt that students
ought to have a direct role in the selection of curricu‘
lum, while the dean of another school thought that stu-
dents had enough control of their curriculum just by
what they discussed in class.

The discussion at the ACE gathering sprang from
concern over student revolts at Berkeley and other uni—
versities during the last year.

Interestingly, the furor over rule changes subsided
at Grinnell about the time the Berkeley upheaval be~
gan. Nor has there been an upsurge in concern at
Grinnell recently.

‘ Perhaps the college worked out its turmoils satis-
factorily during its apparently premature display of
student unrest, Perhaps problems such as the possible
change in the residence hall system can now be con—
sidered with mutual respect for the opinions of all seg-
ments of the campus.

At any rate, President Glenn Leggett and Dean
James Stauss, who attended the ACE meeting from
Grinnell, must have found the discussion of student re-
volt in unusual contrast to the situation at their school.

Forum Windows

College administrators sometimes ask, in all sin-y
cerity, why it is that students are always cynical about
administration actions

Perhaps it is for little reasons, like not having the
windows of the Forum washed until a few days before
Homecoming and Parents’ Weekend despite the fact
they needed cleaning since the beginning of the school
year.

 

Parent-Poet Wonders About Education

Ed. Note: The following is a poem received in the mall this
wcck. it refers to an article in last week’s 8&3 about George
Eastman loducaiion).
Oh Boy, on Boy, Oh Boy!
or
Teachers Arise—Learn to Speak Gobbledygouk

i thought the problem was my age and my size,
But Eastman convinced meil must “revise."
Anachl'ollistic education is really my pain,

ideas Judeo-Christian clutter my brain,

Both schemas and models I must analyze,
Technology, world views, human problems realize,
iry living and learning have a demarcation line.
And up to now i thought that was ﬁne;

But alas and slack rm fuzzyrn-iillded l see,

Or could it, by chance, he Eastman not me?

To the Editor:

Note: Barry Ancona, pres‘ out
of the Grinnell Religious Lil: ills,
was quoted last week as saying
at their meeting, “This is u liberal
campus only six days a week."
Dear Bari-y,

What precisely is illiberlll
about the seventh day around
here? I don't want to engage in
an “I‘m more liberal than you"
contest, but I do know as well as
you what liberalism ill religion
amounts to, and l can only regard
the statement attributed to you as
out of touch or reckless or both.
Malling such B remark as a stimu-
lus {or thought and discussion has
its appeal, but its inaccuracy makes
it self~defeatihg even as a stim~
ulus. The cause of liberalism in
religion is not Idvanced when the
apostles of liberalism make fool-
ish statements, even if those state-
~{Ijents sound liberal Ind iconoclas-
lc.

Our seventh day has its faults,

sliberalSevenlh

one of them being 8 Somewhat eXr
cessive liberalism and its blood
brother lntellecluallsm (vid Tom
Pope's remark in last Week's is~
sue). Did you hear the sermon “A
Natural Easter” 0r “Albert
Schweitzer on History"? 01‘ "The
Noise of Solemn Assemblies"?
Have you taken time to study the
format of the service, which has
been rather distinctively “lib-
cralized’” It may not all be as
liberal as you personally would
like ii, but i great number of oth-
el‘ people attending don't want it
as liberal as you do, and l have
believed that one of he hallmarks
or the liberal's position is generv
ous tolerance to other people's
viewpoints. The current Chapel
program favors the liberal view-
poini, and i should lhiuk that m-
ther than gratuitously knocking
it, you would take support when
you have it!

Vocal Referendum on Student Life
Features Five Minute ‘Sound Off'

By PAUL BRADLEY

A "Bitchvln on [he Multluniver-
sity," a vocal referendum on the
problems of student life, will be
held at the University of Colorado.
Modeled alter rho leachdns, the
bitch-in will be aimed at attacking
what the student thinks is wrong
with the university and how to
correct these problems.

There will be no formal speeches;
all comments will come d1-
rectly from the students. As each
student enters the auditorium, he
will receive a numbered IBM card
which he will be encouraged to
bend, (Old. Staple, or mutilate. In
numerical order, each Cardholder
will then have five minutes [0
sound all. The bllch—ln is not only
to allow the student “lo get it
off his chest" but also to provide
a set of goals and actions on Slur
dents' problems.

Alter months or debate the trus-
tees of Ohio State University have
altered the controversial speakers
ban ruling. Under the change in
the ruling OSU organizations will
be able to invite desired speakers
to the campus as long as their
laculzy adviser approves. Before
the change administrative approv-
al of invited speakers was re-
quired.

The ninemember board of trus-
tees approved the change in the
ldryearrold ruling by a four-lo-
three vote alter lwo of its meni-
bers, who previously decided a-
gainst [he bill, were absent from
[he meeung.

When alterations in the ban were
voted down last March, student
leaders in the Free Speech From
began a protest movement on the
campus. In May the Free Speech
From invited Marxist speaker
Herbert Aplhker to speak on cam
pus, and in July after the trustees
again decided againsi alterations
in the bail, 300 students marched

on lhe stale capllol at Ohio in

Columbus.

To Eldridge

To the Editor:

Dear Mr. Eldridge,

The statement attributed in mo
in last week’s soil was taken out
of context, and clariﬁcation will,
1 hope, lead to understanding.

The six days of the week rc-
rerrod to the academic life of a
liberal arts college. The scvcnih
day referred to the religious life
of many or my fellow students,
and not, as it might unlol‘tunztely
seem when taken out or the con.
text of lny omor remarks at ihc
meeting, to the college chapel pro-
gram.

1 have had the pleasure and chal-
lenge of attending the chapel. l:
would be ioolish to deny lilac i
may learn cvun in the must coir
servative religious homework, l
have attended churches and uni.
pies or many faiths, and through
undersinnding hope to increasc my
tolerance. And tolerance is nol
enough; 1 must be Able to hnrl a
positive way to work with men oi
all faiths and to love all men. _

I am not asking you to him in
the format of your service, nor its
content, It is your church, and you
are responsible to the (‘gresc
number of people attending’ mid
not to me. I am not seeking to llb-
eralize your religion; I desire I
new liberal religion unto itself.)
will worship in my Way and will
nul seek to destroy your faith or
your church.

it is in an uiicmpi to reach
those people who are_too lnzy in
look your way, or mine, or any
way at all on the seventh day, no
in i wish lur love between men or
ill iairhs. that i hope we arc in

accord,
hurry Ancoun
