INTERVIEW
WITH HAGKES

By GERALD SWANSON

An NBC. Television space
specialist had more to say on
politics, prepping and persua-
sion than on the space program
during his visit to the Grinnell
campus Monday.

Peter Heckes, a former Read
prep and Grinnell graduate
gave his predictions for the
1963 presidential elections in all
interview with the see.

‘It the elections were held
tomorrow Lyndon J o h n s o it
would probably win only be-
cause nobody else would have
time to campaign against him.
Johnson is definitely in tl‘oubIE.
mainly because at the Vietnam
war, which has trapped him in-
to a situation in which there
is nothing he can really do."

The from running candidate
at this time, according to Mr.
Hackes, is Richard Nixon, who
“seems to have the most et‘»
iicient organization.”

Hackes discounted R o ii a I d
Reagan as a possible nominee
because of “his problems with-
in the party” and eliminated
George Romney because “he's
a little on the corny side.
Romney also would be troubled
by his affiliation with the L.D.S.
(Mormon) Church, which has
not yet taken a stand on civil
rights."

MAGAZINE '
T0 REPLACE
ALUMNI S&B

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The traditional Alumni
Scarlet and Black will be re-
placed by a new publication
Called The Grinnell Magazine.
Unlike the old newspaper, a
iour~page publication put out
six times a year, the magazine
will be a quarterly of at least
twenty - eight pages. The new
publication is being edited by
Dean of Men, S. Eugene
Thompson, who worked on the
Scarlet and Black when he was
a student at Grinnell.

When asked about the reason
for the change, Thompson ex.
plained that there had been
strong iaculty interest in a
magazine of this type, In a
magazine format, rather than
that of a newspaper, more em-
pliasis can be given to the ln<
tellectual side of the college,
not just the current news.

In addition to the regulara.
Iumni notes and news briefs
about the college, Thompson

hopes to include longer atti-’

cles dealing with the college,
and also student work. “We
definitely want students to
work on the magazine. The
only real criteria that covers
all instances is that the stuff
be of general interest. I will
be glad to see anything anyone
has oi interest to the maga-
zine." Many colleges, Thomp-
son pointed out, put out Alumni
magazines so interesting that
even people not involved in the
college enjoy reading them. H
would like to See Grillnell’s be-
come one of these.

Dean Thompson does not see
The Grinnell Magazine as a
iund~raising vehicle; merely as
a promotion to those people al-
ready interested.

“Prepping now is nothing

We were prepped like mad,

“This prepping integrated tlte

MQNEY BEING COLLEGTED
PM CAMPUS BIKE FLEET

Grinnell students, long used
to their teet as the only means
or transportation. may soon
have a second choice.

Three Grinnell students, Deb-
by Friedman, Molly Malcolm,
and Don Stump, hope to make
tree bicycles available to Grin-
nellians. The plan developed by
the three students involves a
donation ot twenty-iive cents
from at least a thousand people.
Aside iiom iinancing the plan
by student donation, another
important means of getting
money will be subscriptions to
the Dave Gibson Memorial
Monthly Magazine.

With a minimum of 5250, they
hope to buy fifteen to twenty
bikes.

According to the plan, the
bikes will circulate freely about
the campus. A bike may be
picked up by a student anyv

where on campus, then dropped
when he reaches his destina-
tion. The bikes may also be
taken off campus, but the stu-
dent will be on his honor to
return the bike to campus.

The bikes will be identiﬁable
by some sort of unique design
or odd color,

The organizers of this idea
have talked to representatives
of the Schwinn Bicycle Com-
pany, and hope to get a good
deal on the bicycles.

North Campus students who
have been and will be collect-
ing money are:

Don Stump, Dibble; Gary A-
gisim, Rawson, Tim Bowen.
West; Dave Brian, Langan;
Dick Hartz, Cowles; Art
Knowles, South Younket.

Representatives Will also be
named to make, collections on
South Campus.

l-lackes concluded that pro-
fessional education in journal-
ism is not necessary to become
)1 success in the field. ‘There

isn’t anything in the tools oI
Journalism that you can't learn
in six months working tor a
good newspaper. Pmliably more
important is a good background
in the liberal arts."

GLINIU BRANGH
OPENS HERE

By MARTHA BERKEY

The Jasper-Poweshkk County
Mental Health Center opened
in Grinnell Sept. 5 with offices
in the Community Hospital.
This represents an expansion
of the services of the Jasper
County clinic. Previously, psyo
chiatric counseling tor student!
necessitated traveling to New-
ton. Now, most of the sessions
can be conducted in Grinnell.

The Grinnell office is staffed
by a full-time clinical psychol-
ogist, Dr. John Dani a tull-
time secretary-recep ist; a
partrtlme social worker, carol
Pollock; and part-time doctors
Berryllill (psychiatrist) and
Demorest (psychologist).

The center continues its cons
tract with the college by which
the college pays tor the iirst
six interviews with a student.
However, most student prob-
lems should be handled by
campus counselors and initially
students should go to the resi-
dent advisors, counselors, or
deans who may then rater them
to the center. However, the
ieeling that there exists a hut-
Iine between doctors and deans.
which has bothered students in
the past, may be lessened.

In an interview this week, Dl‘o
Daniel assured tlle 5&3, “Everys
thing the student says here re-
mains contidential. If there is
a problem which we feel should
be discussed with college
personnel, we have to get a
written release of information
from the student."

The Center is open as, Mon.
.Fri.
