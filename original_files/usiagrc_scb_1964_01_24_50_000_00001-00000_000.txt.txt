Diaz was born in Venezuela
in 1923, and started his musical
studies in Caracas. In later
study at the Conservatory of
Music in Madri d he was
awarded the coveted “Prize Ex-
triaordinary."

The young artist pursued his
advanced musical education in
Europe where he was a pupil of
Andres Segovia at the Accade»
mia Musicale Chigi‘ana in Siena,
Italy,

Segovia praised both the mu-
sical and technical mastery of
his pupil and soon appointed
him his assistant in teaching
Accademia classes. At the start
of Diaz’ career, Segovia named
him, “a true artist, free from
any influence extraneous to his
own rich personality."

From September to mid-June,
Diaz tours the world giving
concerts in North and South
America, and throughout the

 

world. He made his New York
debut in 1959 and last. January
presented his latest Town Hall
recital. At that time the New
York Times said:

“Mr. Diaz played with deli—
cacy, formal balance, and a
sense of continuity. It was an
exquisite and aristocratic per—
formance.”

During the summer months
he continues, with Segovia, to
teach at the A‘ccademia, where
students of the classic guitar
come from all parts of the
world.

Holimonn Sees Recognition 0!
Red China As logical Step In
Modern French Foreign Policy

‘ By JOHN WOLF

France's recognition of Red
China was explained as a logi-
cal step in French foreign pol-
icy by Stanley Hoffmann in his
5 e c o n d Rosenfield lecture,
”France, the United States, and
Nato," given yesterday in Her-
rick Chapel.

France, claimed Hoffmann,
realizes the difficulty of fight-
ing in SouDheast Asia; there«
fore France would rather nego-
tiate with Peiping, no matter
how long and difficult negotia-
tions might be.

Further, France would feel
more secure it more than two
super-powers existed in the
world, a united Europe would
offset the power of the U.S.,
and a strong Red China would

stabilize the Communist situ-

ation.

The establishment of an axis
between would-be nuclear na-
tions is another French consid-
eration in establishing relations
with the Peiping government.

The first part of Hoffmann's
lecture was a view of the im-
pact of the U.S. on French so
ciety and on French intellectu-
als Since World War II.

Hoffmann first explained that
between 1945 and 1958, ”Al-
though French foreign policy
generally followed the pattern
set by the U.S., the American
impact was badly received.
Since 1958, however, the situa-
tion has been reversed, and now
France has accepted the Amer-
ican impact but has followed
its own foreign policy.

 

Third Behavior Science lnsiiiuie
Gainers NSF Grani of $28.98?

Under a new grant of $28,987
from th e National Science
Foundation to Grinnell College,
the Grinnell Behavior Science
Institute will be held on cam-
pus this summer for the third
successive year.

Expanded from seven weeks
to nine weeks, the institute will
run from Sunday, June 14,
through Saturday, Aug. is. Its
director again will be Dr. Neil
D, Kent, associate professor of

part one of the Junior Liberal Arts Ex-
ednesday and officially started the in-

 

highsability secondary school
students, the institute began in
1962 with a $20,750 NSF grant
and continued last year with a
524,890 award from the same
source. It is the only such pro-
gram in the country to be sup-
ported by the NSF.

Its purposes are to identify
secondary school students who
have potential for becoming
scientists. to accelerate their
scholarly development through
instruction by scientists of rec
ognized stature. and to develop
cooperation between colleges
and high schools in increasing
the quality of education in the
sciences.

Enrollment will be open to
approximately 45 students of
exceptional ability and promise
who have completed their jun-
ior. but not their senior, year
in high school and who have
good backgrounds in science
and mathematics.

Instruction Will be offered by
Griiinell faculty members and
v i s i t i n g scientists in five
courses: Introduction to the
Philosophy of SClence, Experi-
mental Analysis of Behavior,
introduction to Psychological
Research, Psychological Statis-
tics, a nd General Experi-
mental Psychology.

Lectures Will be supplemented
by intensive laboratory work
and programmed learning ma-
terial. During the last two
weeks of the session Students
will have an opportunity to ex7
ecute an independent study of
their own design.

 

Hoffmann outlined several
changes which have arisen
because of the American im-
pact. A youth culture has ap-
peared, the bourgeois culturo'
has given way to a mass cul-
ture due to mass communica-.
tions, and education has be-
come quantitative rather than
qualitative.

Hoffmann concluded his leo-
ture with an inspection of
Charles de Gaulle's foreign pol:
icy.

First, he stressed, as Gaullc
is not an isolated character in
his (1 e s i r e for grandeur.
“Whereas most French people
might not be concerned with
grandeur, they are very mucli
concerned with decline. There.
fore, the Gaullist appeal to pow-
er goes over very well.”

France’s main concern un-
der de Gaulle has been foreign
affairs. De Gaulle sees France
as perpetually oscillating be-
tween decline and grandeur.
Therefore, France must have

a large world goal in ordev
to keep the country from bick-
ering‘over domestic issues.

De Gaulle sees history of ah
fairs as a play in which til!
countries are the actors.

”It is the duty of statesme -
de Gaulle believes, to see thin
the actors remain themselve-l
