Brzezinski Discusses leadership

(Continued from Page 5)

a partial division of functions
occurred. He became a “gen-
eralist" and sought to integrate
the party and the Russian so»
ciety as a whole, or to “estab<
Iish a sense of personal rela—
tions” between the government
and the people

And because Khrushchev be-
came more popular with the
masses than the party elite
(whom he embarrassed) he be-
came an anachronism. The
Khrushchev style did‘nol fit the
Stalinist system,
geared to simple priorities and
not Do the jurisdictional Con-
flicts occurring under Khrush-
chev. He had come to power
by beating the reformist Mal-
enkov. However, Khrushchev
later realized “that to make
the Soviet system more depend<
able he had to make it less
totalitarian.”

According to Brzezinski, the
new generation signifies the
first qualitative change in So-
viet leadership in 30 years and
the close of the Stalinist period,
All the new leaders are men
younger than Khrushchev
whose “careers developed in
a wholly institutional frame»
work.”

Khrushchev had risen in fluid
days of little cohesion between
institutions, while the new lead—
ers rose in the 305 and 405 are
professional bureaucrats. They
are “individuals interested in
orderly procedures."

which was.

 

It was precisely these pro-
fessional party bureaucrats who
saw Khrushchev as a threat be‘
cause he reached out to society.
One event that upset the bu-
reaucrats was an enlarged
meeting of the Presidium to
legislate priorities for consum-
er goods. This was an obvious
conflict with the professional
party bureaucrats, who “are in-
terested in preserving the pri-
macy of the party.”

The new leaders are charac-
terized by bureaucratic profes-
sionalism; they are more paro-
chial than the leaders of 30
years ago who were interna-
tionally minded. Because the
new elite is provincial and nar-
row~minded, it can understand
neither the need for sharing nor
an international spirit.

The Soviet system is now the
first to be run and headed al-
most entirely by bureaucrats,
while most systems allow for
the introduction of non-bureau-
cratic blood, even at the top.
The important question now is
”Can an ideologically oriented
bureaucracy be the basis for
innovation and change?” Can
those who advance on the basis
of conformity be innovators?

Brzezinski closed by noting,
”The problem facing the So-
viet leaders is establishing the
relevance of the party to a
more commercialized, institu«
tionalized, advanCed, industrial-
ized society."

Brzezinski, began to emerge in-
creasingly as a dominant figure.
Backed initially by the Right
against the Left. he subsequently
haVing destroyed the Left, turned
against the Right.

Khrushchev followed this same
tactic, Brzezinski noted, although
the period of true collective lead-
ership between 1953 and 1955 was
one in which violence was sys—
tematically rooted out from Soviet
politics by the use of violence. “Af-
terward, terror ceased to play an
important role in Soviet politics,"
Brzezinski said.

Commenting on the differences
between Stalin's era and the more
recent past, Brzezinski outlined
several important changes, ”The
range or disagreements between
the top leadership has become
much, much narrower," he said.
“The period of the heroic choices
between dramatic alternatives per-
haps is over." He noted that the
quality oi Soviet leadership has
declined, and that political victims.
no longer dismissed in such a ii-
nal sense as during Stalin’s purges,
sometimes recover former offices.

Brzezinski speculated on certain
alternative means for Soviet cul-
leciive leadership — “which is a
pleasant euphemism ior divided
power" — to solve the problem of
Succession.

“Precisely because the Soviet
Union cannot develop orderly tech-
niques for the translerral of rule.
it has no choice but to continue the
