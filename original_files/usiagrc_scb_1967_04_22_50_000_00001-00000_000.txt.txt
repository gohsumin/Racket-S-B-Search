ill Grinnolilans march in BM.

By Phyllis Murray

“Restrained" was the byword of last
Saturday's peace demonstration in Des
Moines. A group of too marchers, about
100 from Grinnell, walked through the
downtown area to a rally at the Iowa
Statehouse. The Grinnell delegation in-
cluded 16 demonstrators who had
hiked 15 miles from Mitchellville to Des
Moines,

The controlled tone of the march was
set initially by its organizers (the Drake
University Committee on Non-Violent
Alternatives), who passed out mimeo—
graphed statements saying, in part:

“Let us not give the press a‘chance
to cloud over the central thrust of
our demonstration with extraneous irr
relevancies, be they outbursts oi pro-
fanity, Viet Cong flags, smart re-
marks or whatever else.”

This written warning was reinforced
with a pep-talk about the dangers of
violence and the importance of a peace-
ful protest.

As if to corroborate these admoni-
tions, at small group of hecklcrs cap
rying‘ signs proclaiming, “The only
‘good' Red is a dead Red," ”Hughes
backs Red traitors," and, “Get out of
U. N., not v. Nam," accompanied the
line of peace demonstrators, Carrying a
Confederate flag as “a symbol of re-
sistance", the counter - demonstrators,
most Di Whom Claimed to be members
of the American Constitution Party,
spent their time shouting "peace
creeps!" at the marchers. The leader
of the group, identified by the Des
Moines Register as Lee Andre, carried
a gasoline can and a sign with the
words: “Free gasoline and matches for
peace groups.”

A small Grinnell contingent led by
Greg Robinson also demonstrated a-
