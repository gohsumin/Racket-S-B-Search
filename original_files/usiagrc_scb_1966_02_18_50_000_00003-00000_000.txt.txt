Antigone: Excess Intensity Spoils
Characters and Impacts of Play

By DAN MASON

“What one can do, one must do."
HAntigone

Tile Iirst thing I did after the our
tain or Mr. Donaiioe's production
oi Anouilh's Antigone was to take
out my Bic pen and insert a
“t” into the line which appeared
on the program's cover. it should
have read; “What one can't do,
one must do.” Such was the case
in this production.

Comments varied:

“That was a good play, Martha.
Wake up, Jimmy, the play’s over.
Its' time to go home.”

"Mr. Donahoe sure is great,
isn't he? I wish he would direct
me someday.”

“That |hing must have SIIIIered
in translation.”

“Hey Dick, I got the key You
wanta go?”

“They’re all the same. Every
play he directs is the some . .
pseudo-intellectual. . .a messen-
ger coming lroni the audience It

they can’t keep my attention on
stage. . .

“Nolhlng happened. The char--
acters come on playing one part,
and on playing one part. it was
like parallel lines. Creon and An-
tigone. Creon and Guard. An'
gone and lsmene. Creon and Hae-
mou, Haemon and Antigone Anti-
gone and Nurse. They never
met. it was like Antigone keeping
real tight inside, sayingi‘l teel
intense.’ and Creoli sensing his
voice, saying—‘Hey, listen to my
voice.’ There was only one little
passage where two characters ev-
en talked to one another, and i
can't remember where, now."

”That guard was great. wasn’t
lie? Terry McCoy. he’s always in
there stealing the Show, He’s the
only one that really played a part,
I sure couldn't believe that Hae-
mon. Fast cars and loose women,
my xxx. And Helfgott. . .was. . .
Heligolti Bruce did pretty Well,
but 1 don‘t know. . i What did
you think about the set?"

“I don't know. I really can't tell,
anymore. I’ve seen these people
around school so much. Maybe
that's it.”

“The whole thing seemed ster-
lie,"

“1 wish Monto would play some-
thing besides intensity. Fear. or
hate, or joy, or spite, I don’t
know. All that comes across is
intensity.”

“The whole plays that way The
intensity seems to lie Within each
character, yet it constrains the
Whole performance. There’s got to
be conflict in drama. There just
wasn‘t any conflict.”

“Hey, I've got two free tran-
scripts coming to me. What should
i do with 'them?”

The comments varied, I couldn't
help thinking, as l walked away
from Roberts Theater, that plays
are like school, It's not how much
you learn, or even what you learn.
It's what you don't learn that
counts.

 

Frank Gives Views

To the Editor:

An educational institution (in
this case, Grinnell) has a respon
siln ty 7 indeed. an obligation —
to CREATE that environment
which is most conducive to the
student's intellectual and social
maturation. The critical question
is: What is the nature of that en-
vil'onllient? Ann Kil' liner (ill her
letter to the edttor ill the January
28 issue of the 3&3) expresses
her new that Ihe position which
the college takcs. as expressed in
the college catalogue, is a hypo
critical stand; that in reality the
college has not created that en-
vironment which is most conducive
to the stated aims of the college
with rcspect to the development
of what one might call a selfrztct-
ualiZliig personality (see A. H.
Maslow, Motivation and PersonaL
ity, Harper Sc Brothers, New York:
1945). Her argument is Well docua
mcnted and clearly stated, In
hopes that it may serve some pos
itive function, I only wish to add,
train a retrospective position, that
I heartily agree with her stand
(and express my sympathies to
her).

There is no doubt that Gl'inneli
has made innumerable significant
advances in the past years in the
improvement ot its academic pro
gram, its present challenge MUST
be to expand the scope of these
advances into the realm of its
social environment. Any school is
more than its Iaculty and stu»
dents: the intellectual and social
milieu in which the process of
education (in the broad sense oI
the word) continues provides an
all important foundation. Without
neglecting the maintenance of the
academic calibre of Grinnell, I
think that it should be a challenge
to the administration of the coir
lege to begin to lessen the wide
gap which exists between that
which the college aspires to (as

Retired 5&B Editor
ls Complimented

To the Editor:

I would like to take this oppor~
[unity to compliment Mr. John
Wait for his admirable work as
editor of the 3&3 last semester,
His sound Journalistic skill and
deep Insight into the problems of
our multifarious Grlnnell com-
munity were, indeed, of no usual
nature.

It is my hope that the high
standards of editorship exhibited
last semester Will Continue during
the present semester; however,
since the transition to the new
editorship, the 58:3 may have de-
viated trom its worthy tunotion as
a student paper for, and by, the
Grinnell students. It is my desire
that standards of materialism and
selfrinterest will not become char-
aclel tic of our “Much - loved
5&3,"

Wants Buriel (Sic)
For Appailing Paper

To the Editor:

A “current impression” of the
Grinneil “atmosphere” is that it
is polluted with a heavy smog oi
rebellion, whining, poutmg, petty
complaints, Much of this acrld
pail appears to emanate train the
pages of what must surely be the
poorest excuse tor a school news
paper in the history of Journalism.
“If i may he permitted to speak
the absurd” 7 it is the tolerance
of these petulant outpourings as a
substitute iol' news.

Evidently “The oldest college
newspaper west at the Mississippi"
is tai- gone in se ' 'ty. lf tile pa-
thetlc old thing is beyond revival
and rejuvenation it deserves a
decent buriel (sic).

GCSI Warned of Cycles

To the Editor:
it the cyclical pattern of stu~
dent atfairs is to be avoided, i
suggest that the Committee on
Student Involvement study the
essential outcome of past com-
mittees on student involvement,
Thereby the committee members
may avoid the circuitous return
to the state or Nature in which
“involvements” becomes indistin-
qiiishable trom “convolution."

Clarifies Aims at 5. Lounge Meeting

By JUDY scorr

Witll ”involvement" emerging as
the key word during convention
activity. the Grinnell Committee

their new group tor-ward Monday

The committee’s first open
meeting brought approximately 40
people to the Smith Lounge where
GCSl programs were further clatu
ified by committee chairmen

“In light of a new SGA, I am in
hopes that GCSI is not necessary,”
election chairman Jeff Hert told
the group. “But as I view it a
number or articulate, seriously in
terested people can help right
now.”

Herf expressed GCSI hopes to
work with the Senate. Members
were urged to vie for senator-
ships, running not as ocst mem—
bers but as interested students.

Future programs the group
hopes to promote are a student se-
lection committee working with
the book store, a campus radio
station and course extension.

Results from a recent mailbox
questionnaire were presented by

Laurie Woods, Public Altair-s
chairman, who telt results gave
“good indications of campus opin-
ion." Four hundred students and
15 taculty members returned the
questionnaire, Some iaculty mem-
bers showed an interest in \vcrle
ing with GCSI.
