Character of Grinnell
Seen Through History

, By Susan Taylor

‘ "Something of the uncom~
. romising idealism of the
ounders_ of this college is a
lpirit worth maintaining in our
me,” according to Prof. Alan
ones, history. Mr. Jones deliv-
ered the annual History of
ﬁrinnell College lecture to the
new students and other inter-
sted persons in Roberts Thea-
or Wednesday night. ’

Jones interpreted the story
at the college by studying the
thoracter it possessed under
ﬁle leadership of its various
wtstanding presidents, rather
Ihan reciting happenings which
were significant in its physical
growth.

From the beginning, as the
hunders and first trustees
ﬂesired, Grinnell was a center
of liberal ideas in learning, but
Elsa a Christian enterprise, the

'story teacher explained. He
pointed out, however, that the
foals or free inquiry and iso-
lated study which were held
by the first trustees have not
enjoyed a consistent place
here, but rather were present
under~the leadership of some
presidents more than of others

Throughout the history of the
Mllege redefinitions of these
goals have taken place. But

om the beginning Jones ex-
plained, the college “was in-
volved with the spirit of the
West, a dream of quest and of
opportunity.”

"A tradition of free inquiry
.was present from the begin-
ning,” Jones said. “The origins
D! the college as a religious
land moral as well as an intellec<
coal endeavor” were also ex-
plained

Looking back, Jones said,
one can observe the vision of
the trustees when they set up
their plan for an isolated place
[or study, away from the cares
of the world. However, he also
pointed out that as Grinnell
came more into the conscious-
ness of the nations, its involve<
lnent in the affairs of men in-
nreased.

The college, though it gained
I national reputation in the
early part of the 20th century

 

still remained a small school
struggling for its ideals, he
said.

Mr. Jones cited many ex-
amples of the writing of mem-
bers of the college commun-
ity throughout its history to il—
lustrate the ideals which have
been continually held.

He pointed out that the con
sciousness of community in-
creased with the building of the
residence halls,

”Compared to its past,"
Jones commented, “the college
is stronger than ever both in-
tellectually and morally."

Alan Jones graduated from
Grinnell College in 1950 and re-
turned as a member of the his
tory faculty in 1954. He has
been here since.

Dean Thompson:
7 Observations '

By John Won

“The students now are mov-
ing faster; they are more con-
cerned about more things, The
students of the late 50’s, when I
was attending Grinnell, were
pan of the ‘apathetic genera-
tion’; they didn’t take up social
causes," These were among
the first observations of 5. Eu-
gene Thompson, Grinnell’s new
dean of men. _

0n the matter of college reg-
ulations, Thompson explained,
“This is a horrible value judg~
merit and perhaps it is too
early to be making it, but from
What I have heard I think the
students in my time lived with
the social restrictions better
than they do now."

Concerning his policy,
Thompson said that he consid-
ered himself an administrator
of the rules of the college.

Thompson has been meeting
formally and informally with
administration representatives
and SGA members.

“I especially enjoy getting to-
gether with the faculty mem-
bers; nearly half of them were
here when l was a student at
Grinnell. It's good to be bac ."

Freshmen Greater in Number. lisi Social Studies
And Medicine High in Professional Goals - Sauers

The facts and ﬁgures of
Grinnell’s class of 1968 have
been released by Robert Sauers,
director of admissions.

Of the 356 freshmen, 53 per
cent of the men and 63 per cent
of the women were in the upper
lo per cent of their high school
graduating class. Ranking in
the upper quarter of their class
were 83 per cent of the men
and 88 per cent of the women;
94 per cent of the men and 99
per cent of the women were in
the top half.

In other categories, 20 per
cent of the men and 15 per
cent of the women were high
school class officers. Student
council posts were held by 36
per cent of the men and 28 per

cent of ilhe women. Nearly 70
per cent of the men partici-
pated in some form of athletics.
D r a m a and debate were
among the activities of 69 per
cent of the men and 65 per cent
of the women. Nearly half the
men and almost two-thirds of
the women were involved in
high school publications. Inter-
est in music and art was pro—
fessed by 63 per cent of the men
and 78 per cent of the women.
This year Sauers compiled a
list of professional goals among
the freshmen. The breakdown
is as follows: biological sci-
ences, 8 per cent; ﬁne arts, 2
per cent; languages, 9 per
cent; mathematics, 8 per cent;
physical sciences, 3 per cent;

literature, 9 per cent; pre-engi—
neering, 4 per cent; pre-law, 5
per cent; premedical, 12 per
cent; social -studies, 31 per
cent: undecided, 11 per cent.

Sauers noted that the “uncle
aided" category has decreased
from nearly 50 per cent several
years ago to 11 per cent this
yearr Sauers attributes this de
crease to the fact that liberal
arts colleges are tending to-
word a preprotessional smtus.

Sauers said that about 100
more applications were re-
oeived this year than last year.
The number of applications
varies between about 850 and
1200 from year to year and fol-
lows tha population curve very
closely.
