LeMoyne, a primarily Negro college supported

LeMoyne, an opportunity, a challenge, a re-

The uniqueness of LeMoyne College is bound up
in the complexities of its roles, its atmosphere, and its
faculty, administration, and student body.

Founded in 1870 as a normal school for teacher
education, LeMoyne now has the endorsement of the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The road
to accredation has been filled with hard work and many
problems; smoothed only by some of the “Consecration,

Courage, and Truth” which is emblazoned on the school _
emblem. The journey has been dramatic, as has that .

of most colleges founded during the reconstruction. The
1870 founding was possible by a gift of $20,000 from Dr.
Julius LeMoyne, a Washington physician. The school
has been rebuilt, and its philosophy has changed sev-
eral times over the years, but its basic principles remain
the same. Through its years as a high school, teacher-
training school, and liberal arts college, its prime pur-
ose has been “. . . to train youth in effective Christian
iving, clear thinking and aesthetic appreciation."
The college has awarded over 2,000 bachelor de-
grees since its conversion to a four-year liberal arts
college in 1928. Despite this new emphasis on liberal
art, LeMoyne still supplies the public schools of Mem-
phis and Shelby County with a good percentage of their
eachers, just as it did when it was the only school in
the region which trained Negro teachers. The college
is also proud of the increasing number of its graduates
that enter graduate school for further study and pro-
fessional training in medicine, law, the ministry, gov-
ernment work, and college teaching.

LeMoyne is now thoroughly non-sectarian, and
makes no distinction in its admissions policy as to race,

religion, or nationality. It demands of its students a
Standard of excellence which fully equips them for
future careers or further study. Faculty members, 25%
of whom hold Ph.D.’s, concern themselves with their

sophomore who hopes to study
math in graduate school, lives
in Main hall for the semester.
Junior Bobbie Raybourn, who
lives in Read, completes the
LeMoyne quartet united by a

students both as scholars and as individuals. LeMoyne
has retained itsﬁstanding as a commuter college, draw-
ing 95% of its student body of 550 from Memphis and
the surrounding areas. The college provides an exten-
sive program of cultural and social activities and
groups, both for its students and the Negro population
of Memphis. Under its president, Dr. Hollis F. Price,
LeMoyne college has assumed a role of leadership and
a position of excellence among Southern Negro col—
leges. It prides itself on its total commitment to its
students, the Memphis community, and the Negro race.

An exchange program was instituted last spring
between LeMoyne and Grinnell, after a visit to the
Memphis college by former president Howard R. Bow-

en. Under the terms of the program, up to four stu-
dents from each school will receive credit for a semes-
ter at the other institution. Ned Donahoe (Speech and
theatre) is now at LeMoyne under‘ thesfaculty ex—

change which goes along with the student program.

application for semester at LeMoyne.)
