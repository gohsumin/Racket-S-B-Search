resented in the Griilnell student
body doubtless has much to do
with the problems in our pres-
ent situation. Student govern
ment tor the past several
years, tor instance, even with
good intentions, has not been
able to deal with the necessity
oi enforcing rules on a dissent~
iug minority, perhaps for the
understandable reason that
maximum exposure is now pro-
vided in the halls for particu-
larly strong personalities to ex-
ercise an exhibitionism and ag-
gi-ession.

So far as the College admin-
Islratiun is concerned, it has
suiiered from charges or stu-
dents that it cares more about
“public appearance‘Vthan about
students' emotional needs and
thus has not really made its
claim clear for the necessity of
its concerns, which include the
need for emotional and mate
rial support from alumni and
donors, the encouragement of
prospective students and their
parents, the respect and well-
wishes of current parents. and
the good-will oi the immediate
community. Out oi its own
needs, the College administra—
tion has probably embraced
the abstraclion oi “ceinmunitv”

uion of interests among itself.
its iaculty. and its student
body. It has perhaps not talked
enough about the distribution oi
rights and obligations among
the parts oi its “community at
scholars“ but instead ["15 em-
phasized its hopes lor totality
and im- wholeness, probably
because talk about separation
oi powers and “ultimate author
ity" is not comiortable rhet-
one to deans and presidents

But it is necessary now to
admit we need to achieve a
better balance than we have
among the sometimes compet-
ing interests oi students, inc-
ulty, and College administra-
tion. We need to continue to
deiine what we expect oi one
another so that the atmos-
phere oi intellectual and emo—
tional growth that is so stead-
ily being improved at Grinnell
can be maintained, principally
by retaining the remarkably
talented and committed people
who have chosen to gather in
the College,

There are certain conditions
i regard as necessary to such
a balance. They are so pio-
ioundly and permanently inilu-
ential that they have to be
talked out simultaneously With
the formulation of the “inter-
im” period.

Management of the

residence halls during

the “interim” period.

i shall not speak at length
about the student “reieren.
dum” oi ll November. There
have been questions about its
technical validity, its timing.
and the impression it gave.

perhaps inadvertently, that stu-
dents wcre going to decnie the
“interim” arrangement With-
out any reference to the con-
cerns oi iaculty and the Col-
lege administration Bul l was
favorably impressed with the
insistence of the Student Gov-
ernment Association that
among the procedures neces-
sary to implement the rcier-
endum were (I) the need to
determine procedures ior se-
lecting house iudicial councils,
(2) the need to determine en-
iorcement procedures, and (3)
the need to formulate a “bill
at rights and obligations" CDli<
cerning individual behavior in
a dormitory situation. Tiiese all
seem to me to be constructive
and necessary iii-st steps. i
understand they are now under-
way. Many oi these steps,
when reﬁned and discussed in
your committee, will go iar
toward meeting the conditions
or balancing the concerns oi
students, iacuity, and College
administration which I dis-
cussed in general terms above
and now list here as specific
recommendations ior your con-
sidel'atinn:

l 7 The need for a minimal,
workable non-interference in
otllers‘ comiort and privacy
within the dormitories, begin-
ning with students’ lirm pledges
to one another to maintain
“quiet hours" as promised in
the student handbook (even, as
I understand it, to the level of
music. talk, slamming or doors,
and the like): in speaking about
dormitories I include the din-
ing halls, where respect for
the rights oi others is essen-
tial, particularly those rights

or being free from the intimb
dating aspects oi boisterous
behavior, pushing ahead in line'
and acting or urging others to
act in ways unbecoming to the
appetites and digestions of the
great majority oi students.

2 — The need ior expansion
as soon as possible oi the option
oi voluntary departure irom the
residence halls, now repre-
sentcd by the “offscampils”
process which this year placed
nearly a hundred students
(probably the current limit oi
available rental housing) in the
town of Grinnell, ’

:i —— The need tor a general
recognition at the process of
eviction (rain the residence
halls as an oilicial response to
behavior problems as they are
identiﬁed by student govern-
ment or resident advisers or
deans.

4 — The need tor a system
in which elected house presi-
dents provide a rule pattern
for student behavior and a
process of entorcement within
the hall that makes possible
some choice or option for stu»
dents as they are in the process
oi selecting a particular resi-
dence hall. Not all aspects
of residence hall lile can be
settled in this manner, but it
is a device necessary to meet
the needs or that minority
which now must leave the col-
lege or choose not to come to
it initially, As I said previous-
ly, it is my understanding that
SGA ofﬁcers, in consultation
with resident advisors, deans,
and iaculty members, are al-
ready attempting to formulate
such descriptions. to experi<
ment with new devices such as
judicial committees within each
hall, and to renew a commit
ment to good dormitory liie on
a new, more sell-determining
basis.

5 a The need to expand op
portunities, for coeducational
visitation in student rooms to
a maximum of 84 hours per
week provided conditions such
as the above are met and pro-
vided certain administrative
details, such as strict adher—
ence to the stated times as de-
termined by the hall's govern—
ment are attended to, and pro-
Vided that coeducational visV
iting hours will not take place
between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.
on Sunday through Thursday
and between 2 a.m. and 8 a m.
on Friday and Saturday. This
latter point is sellcxplauaiory
to parents, alumni, iacnlty,
and I suspect most students. i
believe. too, that the opening
oi the common-use lounges

weakens any argument tor the.

eta-educational

need to have

v ting in individual room:
during the normal hours ior
sleeping,

This last item, the state-
ment on “open dorms," will no
doubt he a perpetual topic on
this campus, ii ior no other
reason than that it has by now
become highly symbolic and
thus surrounded by tradition.
But i believe that the leelings
or our own student body, a
large segment of which wants
something less than “unlimited
open rooms" would argue ior
some limitation, and 84 hours
per week seems to meet reasona
ably well the iaculty require-
ment that management of the
residence halls pay a regard
to privacy and quiet; it also
serves to satisiy the “account-
ability" oi the College adminis-
tration as it explains our resi-
dence hall program to parents,
alumni, and prospective stu-
dents.

I am aware that I have
given your committee a great
deal to do, and a short time
to do it in ~ that is, Consider
ations involving workable ere
plications or my recommenda<
tions as well as implementa-
tion of judicial and enforce-
ment proceedings; discussions
oi proposals irom individual
residence halls and the relating
of them to one another: all
in all, a continuing review oi
what seems to be working and
what isn't as you attempt to
construct a realistic and Work-
anle “interim" system that
points toward a permanent
system and at the same time
meets the general require-
ments I outlined at the start
of Section II and the specific
recommendations or Conditions
I gave in Section III. But I am
also aware that much construe-
tive work is already underway.
For instance, my understand-
ing is that individual halls, to
a varying degree, have already
prepared statements for the
consideration or your commit-
tee. It remains for each one now
to begin preparing revised pro<
posals within the prescribed
limits oi 34 hours per week or
less. As soon as your commit-
tee is satisfied that an individ-
ual residence hall has its house
in order, it can be told to pro.
cecal Hopeluiiy, when all resi-
deuce halls have reported In,
enough variety in regulatioiu
will have exhibited themselves
to assure the College that we
can continue to appeal to dif-
ferent kinds of Students. Hope<
iully too, within a short time
the house councils and judicial
Councils will have demonstrated
their ability to manage matters
so that the concerns of all of
us # students, faculty, and
College administration _ are
in that reasonable balance that
will let all oi us enjoy the many
good things that make this
College so attractive.
