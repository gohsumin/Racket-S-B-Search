of the Board of Trustees, in a
letter to the faculty this week
reported on the progress in the
selection process for a new
President of the college.

Hewitt reported that a sub-
stantial number of qualified

"Prices are rising astronom-
wally" said Social Coordinator
Palmer Hartl when he asked
the student Senate to approve
an eight dollar social increase
for the 1964-65 financial year.
Hartl also indicated during the
Wednesday night Senate meet-

quantity, but will allow us to
give the students a quality pro—
gram.”

The Senate voted thirty-seven
to one to approve the increase.
Previously, the C. of H.P. and

posed increase; however, final
approval for such a raise in
student fees must come from
the Board of Trustees. Hartl
