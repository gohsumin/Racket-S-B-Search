For the past few weeks the
Student Course Evaluation Com~

inittee has been working long
and hard to develop a question-
naire which would cover the
areas of importance [or evalu-
ation and obtain the support
necessary lrom both faculty and
students. Monday night the fa-
culty voted as a unit to support
the idea of a student course
evaluation and urged all iaculty
members to Cit-operate in dis-
tribution of the questionnaire in
class. A week before, the
Student Senate had also voted
(0 support the idea of a student
course evaluation. Thus the way
has been cleared tor the ques-
tionnaire, almost in final form,
to be handed out to the protes-
Sors.

This questionnaire will be di-
vided into three parts. One part
will ask questions such as “Was
the class lecture, discussion, or
a mixture)". This section will
provide more information for a
student deciding on which
courses he might take the next
semester. This \vill be printed
for distribution to the student
body.

A second part will be con-
cerned with curricular infor-
mation about a course. Two
sample questions are; “From
the instructor's point at view
what are the objectives or the
course?". and “How successful-
ly was each or these objectives
attained?". This inlormatton
will go to those who decide on
the curriculum: the student
Curriculum committee. the de-
partment heads. and/or the edu-
cational policy committee The
information will also go to the
individual instructor.

The third part will be Ci‘iti~
clsms oi the instructor's meth-
ods of teaching, A question such
as “How open-minded was the
instructor in discussion?” is
typical of what the committee
has in mind. This section will
go only to the instructor, not to
Students,

The procedure tor all of this
will be as follows:

Firstly, the Committee, with
the help of other students and
professors experienced in the
use of questionnaires, will make
up the iinal questionnaire. Sec-
ondly, the questionnaires wdi
be distributed to the protes-
sors. Thirdly, the proiessors will
hand them out at their conven-
ience at the end of this semes-
ter- at least it is hoped that all

professors will. It cannot be re«
quired of them.

Fourthly, after the question-
naires have been filled out IN
CLASS the prot will immediately
put them into an envelope and
send them to the post. oirice, to
be stored until after grades have
been handed out. Then. next
semester, the profs will receive
the third section of the question-
naire from the student com<
mittee, which will not look at
that section. Next the stu<
dent committee AND ALL STU-
DENTS WHO WILL BE WIL-
LING TO HELP will compile the
information section and the
section for each individual
class. Lastly. these compilations
Will be distributed to the student
body in the case of the ﬁrst
section, and to the appropriate
CurrIculumrlnvestigating bodies
and the individual instructor in
the case of the second section

Lack oi space precludes ex-
plaining all the intricacies of the
committee's work appropriate

or wait for the questionrand-
answer session which will he
held soon. It will be publicized,
but watch for it.

This evaluation is for you, the
student. It should not be a cov-
ert attempt to “get" a teacher,
The purpose is to get the stu-
dent to think crttically about
his courses and thus, hopefully,
improvement of the course:
would result. The committee
hopes that this questionnaire
will not be your iirsi and last
attempt to evaluate courses;
they hope, instead. that it leads
the student to attempt to investi-
gate and be concerned with h'
courses more, through more in<
dividual contact with the pm-
fessors.

the fact that Grinnell was a

Hotel‘s Decline

Since the late 1950's, a tree

In the past nine years, there
have been many rumors. most
