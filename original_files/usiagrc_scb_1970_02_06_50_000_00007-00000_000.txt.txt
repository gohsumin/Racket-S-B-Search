Senate Weighs
Abortion Laws

The loira legislature niuy pos»
sibly repeal the pr'csent law pro
limiting abortions if the bill can
be passed out of the conservative
Senate Social Services Coins
nnitcc, The act, sponsored by
Charlene Coitklm of Waterloo,
would allow women to receive
abortions for any reason One
minor provision of the bill insures
that doclors or hospitals would
not be forced to perform the
operation without their consent.
Another provides stiffer penalties
for persons performing abortions
without a doctor's license. The
success of the bill‘s passage
depends to a great extent on the
public support it receives.
Congressmen are reluctant to
much a controversial issue in an
election year, unless they feel
thatasufficlentnumberolvoters

newly formed group, the Iowa
Association for the Medical
Control of Abortion, is cam-
palgning quite actively. and has
suggested a number of congress
men to whom to write in order

Luienisf Plays to Capacity Crowd in Herrick

Considering the type oi concert
attendance that Grinnell College
frequently bestows upon its
visiting artists, David Harris
might have been mistaken tor the
Pied Piper of Grinnell Hamlet
when he presented his lute and
classical guitar concert last
Friday evening. Lured by the
promise of an unusual and his
teresting evening, Grinnellians
ventured fourth from their ivys
covered closets and ﬂocked to
Herrick Chapel. But similarities
to the tale of the “Pied Piper
of Hamelin” end there, as the
enthusiastic throng was not
robbed of its expectations. In
fact, David Harris did a very fine
job, presenting a concert con-
sisting primarily of unfamiliar
Renaissance lute music to an
audience that knew little about
the lute or the literature com-
posed for it, and he 1made them
enjoy it. The audience obviously
appreciated not only his music
but also his casual remarks about
tuning, the squeaky chair, his
instrument. and restless
children. He prefaced most of
selections with program notes.
and the only problem with this
was that his voice was barely
audible beyond the tenth row of
pews. Harris is probably ac-
customed to smaller audiences,
as the lute is an intimate in-
strument and is not easily heard
in halls the size of Herrick.

Harris’ performance was not
ﬂawless; his runs were not

always even and he visibly
flubbcd In a few places. But
considering the difficulty of the
instrument (several avid lute
fans have told me that even
Julian Bream has been known to
inuit a passage), one could say
that he maintained a high level
of performance throughout the
concert. I should mention that
besides being a performer,
Harris also has a scholastic in-
terest in the lute. He researches
the music that he plays, and, in
fact, several ot the works per-
formed last Friday had been
discovered by Harris himself. of
the three schools of lute music
that he presented, the English
school seemed to have the most
audience appeal. Its rhydims
were more interesting than those
of either the Italian or Spanish
schools, and the contrapuntal
play between high and low voices
easily captured one’s attention.
I also thought that the “Fan
tasia” by John Duwland was the
best-executed work of his lute
performance. Even though parts
or it were played to the ac
companiment of the 3:35 Rock
Island train whistle, he exhibited
more control over his instrument,
and his runs came through
clearly and evenly,

Harris began the second part
of the concert with three Bach
preludes, two of which were
written for lute. The first of these
he played on the lute, but for the
second the guitar was used. This

Turner stated, as he has many
times, that he didn’t seize the

Wilton Junction printer to take

stated that he originally resisted
the request of the printer, but
added that the printer had
promised the representatives of

type of transcription from lute
to guitar is frequently done,
because the strings of the
Renaissance lute are tuned in
relationships similar to those of
the guitar’s strings He remained
on the guitar for the third prelude
and the two works that followed.
His command of the guitar was
quite impressive, and his ren-
dition of “Hommage au Tombeau
dc Debussy" was very well done.
The three Villa Lobos pieces were
probably the most familiar works
on the program. and they too
were performed with skill, Of
these the ”Prelude No. 4”
presented the most difficulties,
as it contained a passage of,
chime-like harmonics which can
try the patience of the best
classical guitarist.

We will probably hear more of
David Harris. He is releasing an
RCA recording within the next
year and is currently working on
amethod book forlute.l There is
a strong possibility that he will '
be invited back to Grinnell not
only because he gives a good
performance but because he is
willing to spend time lecturing
about music and talking with
students. nis appearance at
Grinnell provided us with a good
introduction to an instrument
that most of us know little about,
and I for one feel that we profited
much from having shared a few
days with him.

the Attorney General's office that
a pot of coffee would be at hand
for them While they Waited for
the copy to arrive, Apparently,
then, the significant variable was
the coffee. The question
becomes: had the printer not
offered a sampling from the
widely-renowned pot, would
Turner’s boys have raided?
Obviously, the answer is that Mr.
Turner would have confiscated
the materials in any case. Far
be it from this phlegmatic pur-
suer of crime to cease and desist
for want of a little caffeine.
Having perceived the disdainfui
ire imprinted on the face of this
distinguished administrator, I
refrained from pursuing the
discussion, for fear that Mr.
Turner might pursue me.

By this time, Richard C.
Turner had succeeded in Die
tending everyone in the room
with both his diplomacy and
logic. Barely cognizant of the
fact, Mr. Turner relented mer-
cifully and said“! hope you (the
students in the room) don’t
always hate me.” This burst of
decency, along with his com-
mittant declaration that he had
been the first state official to
support legalized consumption of
beer for 18 year olds, and his
admission that he drank beer
when he was in college (most
likely for him some sort of ab-
struse puberty rite enacted to the
music of the Alley Cat hubcap
band), induced little solace and
many guffaws among our group,
One fellow was heard to say as
we left the Attorney General’s
office, “No, Mr. Turncr, we won't
always hate you; give us a can
of beer and we'll follow you
