College Forum Gains Recognition
For Modern Architectural Design

The Forum, beginning its second
year as social center and common
haven for Grinnell students, has
ﬁnally been recognized by the out—
side world~tor its modern archi<
tectural design,

In December our newest build
ing on campus was cited in fear
ture stories in two magazines. An
article acclaiming our Forum as
"College Building of the Month"
appeared in "College and Univer-
Iity Business.” In the story, guest

writer Merritt C. Ludwig, vice
president at Grinnell, describes
the special designing of the build-
ing. l-le comments that the Forum
is like other college unions in its
design as the hllb of student re<
creation and social life,”. . .but
with the emphasis an informal ac-
tivity as opposed to elaborate
planning.”

”Progressive Architecture," a
monthly magazine, also published
a story about the Grinnell Forum.
