Pinne Bequeqths $100,000
Collection of Rare Books

A collection or about 0,000
books valued at between $80,000
and $100,000 has been bequeathed
tocrinnell College by Dr, George
F, Pinne, dermatologist, who
died last December at the age oi
as.

The giit, announced by Grinnell ,
College President Glenn Leggett,
consists chieily at a great variety
of first editions in addition tot
volumes with a special emphasis
on history. The rarest item,t
valued at $3,000, is a iirst edition
oi Thomas DeQuincy‘s “Cone
iessions oi an English Opium
Eater.”

Grinnell will receive all the
volumes in the collection except
for the relatively small number
oi medical books which Dr. Pinne
bequeated to the library or the
Univeisity oi Nebraska College
at Medicine at Omaha.

Henry Alden, Grinnell librarian
who iirst became acquainted
with Dr. Pinne and this
remarkable library some live
years ago, says he expects the
collection will not be fully
catalogued betore this tall.
However, he plans an exhibition
at some oi the best items during
the Commencement-Alumni
Reunion Weekend activities here

May 23-31. A group oi the
volumes is to be exhibited at the
Omaha Public Library in May.

Among the rare first editions
are John Locke’s “Essay on
Human Understanding," Adam
Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations,”
Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick,”
Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle
Tom's Cabin," Henry David
Thoreau's “Walden,”
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s
‘The Scarlet Letter," Walt
Whitman‘s “Leaves oi Grass,“
Victor Hugo's “Hernani,”
Charles Dickens' ”David Cop-
perfield,” and Charles Darwin’s
“Origin of Species,”

The collection also embraces
some “fine press" books, in-
eluding a Kelmseolt Press
“Chaucer,” and three incunabula
(books printed before 1501).
There are a tow manuscript
items, too, one at them being a
postcard on which Queen Victoria
wrote the inscription she wanted
on the tombstone of her devoted
Scottish servant, John Brown.

While the unusally valuable
items in the collection will be
given special care, Alden says,
many oi the books will be readily
available ior regular use by
students.

unusual lecture at this show was
the manual slide change. Mr.
Brown changed the slides to
the music its he saw fit, tene
dering each show unlike any
other.

The music that accompanied
the shows was or iairly uni-
formly good quality, mostly
romantic. The slides them-
selves were of consistently good
quality, every one a prize win»
her. The Combination of the
two was always tasteful. never
inappropriate, and more than
good enough to hold the View

fortyethree minutes the show
lasted.

The ilrst sequence of slides,
entitled “Flower Fantasy” and
accompanied by Deb uss y 's
f‘Reveries," was easily the
most engaging. From the very
ﬁrst slide the screen was filled
with the diaphanous patterns of
the small parts of ilowers oi
many types. Sophisticated use
of selected locus had insured
that only a small part of each
slitle was sharp, thus creating
ti pattern almost abstract in its
Coloriul beauty. The slides fol-
lowed the changes in the music
'very closely, making use oi
variations in Color values,
light, depth of iicld, and Care-
rully controlled line quality.
