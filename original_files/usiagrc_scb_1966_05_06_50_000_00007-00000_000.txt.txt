How to make a snap course
out of a tough one!

Obviously, Olds 4—4—2 crammed for its ﬁnals. It masters miles with a 400—cuhic-inch VeS.
4—harrel carb and a rumbling pair of pipes. Cools corners with heavy-duty suspension
and front and rear stabilizers. Goes to the head of its class with the sportiest conﬁguration
ever to top four red-line tires. All this, and straight A's in economics, too. . .

like matching its modest price to your pocket!
