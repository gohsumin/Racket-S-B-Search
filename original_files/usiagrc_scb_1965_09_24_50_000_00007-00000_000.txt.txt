SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Jjwm, Jim. Mutt

By WAYNE STENGEL

24 years ago—tall at 1941—
found Ihe Grinnell student body,
its seen through the eyes of the
5&3, concerned with war, holi-
days, class cuts, prepping, and
what's at the Strand; altogether
bearing an uncanny resemblance
to our interests in the (all 0(1965.

Over the masthead oi the 1941
Thanksgiving edition oi the 5&1;
appeared this memo in doric type:
"Forget not the five buck fee {or
cutting class today". The admin
istration should never have aban-
doned this policy, They really
had something here What senior
wouldn’t rather lose 1/2 of an ex
Lm credit than shell out live
bucks?

Oh, for the good old days when
you could see Ronald Regan at the
Strand in “International Squad-
ron" at a Saturday matinee for
a dime, and not speaking to voters
in California about the interna»
tional conspiracy. Oh, for that
joyous yesteryear when E. E.
Spencer, at Newton contractor,
tried to sue the freshman class for
stealing Loon ieet of lumber as
part of u prepping stunt. But they
shouldn‘t make movies like they
used to, and they don’t make preps
lilre students read about in the De-
cember 5. 1941 edition of the 5513.

It was also late in the fall at
1941, just weeks before Pearl Har-

was iully aroused to the dangers
of Nazism. The 5&B reaction to
this threat was as typically col-
leglate in its iervor as repeated
urgings to remove American
troops irom Viet Nam are today.
To the paper's most ardent critics,
which will include, by May, the
total enrollment of the school mi-
nus the twenty»tliree regular staff
members, this excerpt train a No
vember 21, 1941 edition will make
it evident that, while not neces-
sarily improving in quality, 5&1;
editorials are more sophisticated
in tone The very title, “Hitler
and You" is a tip on to the degree
at personal involvement the writer
wished to elicit in his readers.
1 quote: “Say what you will about
Hitler, you can’t ignore him any-
more than you can do without
your weekly bath! (And don’t
think Grinnell students didn’t try
to do that even in the prevbeatnik
1940s.) Mighty as his Nazi armies
are, the real threat to you is not
to be round in the mighty armor
of the German Reich. Lurking in
the shadows is 2: much greater
factVthat Hitler had succeeded in
moulding a united Germany with
a living, dynamic ideology.” And
so the prophetic voice of doom
moaned melodramatically on,
tinaliy concluding with that most
rabble-rousing nf rhetorical ques-
tions, “Hitler has his Own peculiar
answer to the problem, What is
going to be ours?”

Chem Profs Attend
Society Conference

Four members of the chemistry
department faculty attended the
national meetings oi the American
Chemical Society held sept. 10
through 17 in Atlantic City. Re-
presenting Grinnell among the thir-
ty to {any thousand delegates
were William A. Nevill, Joseph D.
Danfortll, Jack 3. Swenson, and
Luther E. Erickson.

Daniorth helped ln the prepara-
tion of the ACS standardized ex-
amination tor inorganic chemis-
try. He also attended a meeting
ior heads oi ACS approved den
partments which meet the stand-
ards necessary for this approval.

Nevill attended 8 short Course
in contormational analysis or or-
ganic molecules which dealt with
spatial arrangement of molecules.

Erickson presented a technical
paper on “Nuclear Magnetic Rese
nance ot Platinum Complexes."
This subject arose from a cancer
research project which he and
Nevill are conducting under a
government grant trim the Na-
tional Institute of Health, Depart»
ment or Health, Education, and
Welfare.

The tour attended the conven-
tion in a rotation system 01 ab-
sence from teaching responsibili-
ties at Grinnell. Swenson was able
to work in a visit to the New York
Worlds' Fair on his return.
