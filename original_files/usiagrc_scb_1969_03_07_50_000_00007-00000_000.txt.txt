} Theft

Continued from Page I

Although he doesn't like to call stu-
dents thieves, Hand said he has a prob-
lem with students who sneak food out oi
the dinlng halls He explained that he
doesn't mind students who "pick up a
few cookies to eat on the way out,” but
he cannot tolerate those who “are greedy
ll'ICl start wrapping things up in napkin:
to sneak out.’I

Hand said that he realizes that many
Itudents justify stealing trom SAGA be.
cause they think the Food Service takes
advantage of them. “I know how I’m
despised by many students because at
the way I run Cowies, but l’ve got a job
to do land I do it as best I can,” he com-
mented, adding that he receives no
awards trorn SAGA tor his economy
measures. He claimed that SAGA works
within a budget and operates at a proiit
or only three to tive percent at Grin-
nellr He emphasized that if students
were charged only tor the individual
meals they eat rather than the seed
board lee tor the whole year, they
would be spending much more on land.
Lambie contends that SAGA and the
Bookstore do not make excessive proiits,
and he said that oil-campus students are
required to pay the board tee in order
to avoid the necessity of checking student
meal tickets at every meal to see which
ltudents have paid their lee.

Some students also take [God from the
Forum fountain without stopping to pay
the cashier, and Hand is aware oi this.
lie said that he sees no way to prevent
theit from SAGA, because even when he
stops students who are taking lood or

utensils they merely make excuses such
as “l was just borrowing it," or “I lor-
got to pay."

Reception Center bosses 5600 Carpet

Director oi Residences Ralph Pomer-
enk estimates that the value of property
stolen trom'lounges and the Reception
Center and never recovered reaches as
high as $500 in a given year." Although
many items are discovered in student
rooms by maids and returned, Pomerenk
believes there is still ”a very serious
problem"

Among the items stolen and as yet unv
recovered this year are a 5600 carpet
and a wall painting from the Reception
Center, plus several chairs. small ta-
bles and lamps from various lounges
and rec-rooms on campus. Pomerenk at-
tributes the losses “more to students
than to outsiders, although outsiders are
also involved." He said there is "no m8-
gical answer” to prevent theft at College
property, but he suggests that “vigilance
on the part of Students and faculty might
help"

Lamble added beds, mattresses, and
even hassocks from the Fomm‘s South
Lounge to the list or turniture being sml<
en periodically from the College. “I’m
not absolutely certain where it disap
pears to, but there’s probably some stu-
dent involvement," he said. “Perhaps
some of it goes to students living oft-
campus who rented unfurnished apart-
ments."

Thett irom vending machines on cam-
pus is also “of some concern" to Pom-
erenk. He said that last year $100 in mer-
chandise was stolen from the cigarette
machine in Cowles lounge, and this year
$60 Worth of merchandise was stolen
lrorn the machine in Loose laundry

roono 'me [and vending machines on
campus are also irequently damaged by
people who tame the doors open without
paying, according to Pomerenk.

College property is also stolen from
{acuity offices and the Science Building,
Lambie saidr Typewriters, tape record-
ers and other otiioe equipment disap-
peared last year from various offices as
well as a set of binoculars and some
other scienliiio apparatus irom the
Science Building

Students steal from Student:

in addition to college property, hun-
dreds oi dollars worth or personal be-
longings are stolen from Grinncll slu»
dents annually. Recently several coats
were stolen irorn Cowles lounge during
a meal, and several purses left outside
dining halls have also been stolen, Ac-
cording to Lambie, stereos, cameras,
wallets and gel! clubs have been re-
ported stolen from student rooms in the
residence halls. He thinks that outsiders
are otten involved, but there is no way
to be certain Bicycles, phonograph re-
cords, clothes, books and wallets are
items which are irequently stolen, ac-
cording to Doug Ensmingcr, Assistant
Dean of Students.

Dean oi Women Alice low In a tele-
phone interview said that only a dozen
students reported theft of their personal
property last semester, but added that
she feels “many students don’t bother
to report losses through channels." She
said that she urges all students who are
missing items to report to their resident
advisors or to the Deans’ Office and fill
out a iorm. According to Dean Low local
police occasionally recover stolen stu-
dent property which can be identified
irom student descriptions and returned to

the owner. when reported, stolen items
sometimes “get too hot and are left in
campus buildings” where they can be
recovered, she said

Dean Low also recommended that sine
dents lock their rooms and “be alert to
strangers in the residence halls and chal-
lenge them." She said that purses and
other valuables should not be left out~
side dining halls where they can be
easily stolenr .

Speaking about the problem or student
theft in general, Dean Low sald thlt
"several students" were caught shop—
liitlug in downtown Gr‘lnnell last year. in
regard to theft of College property, she
believes that, “although some student:
lhlnk lt’s justifiable to steal from the ill:-
stitution, it’s just as dishonest as other
theft."

Al cloud, student manager or thl
campus radio station, when asked about
theft at KDlC's studio replied, “We do
have a terrible problem." He explained
that the station's problem dates back
to last spring when a mo tape recorder,
a 5160 power amplitier, a set of stereo
headphones, and other smaller pieces
or equipment were stolen from the sta-
tion's studio in Darby Gymnasium, He
said that since the permanent installa<
tion of heavy equipment has been com-
pleted, none has been stolen, but added
that “ n indeterminate number of rec-
ords” still is being stolen.

Speaking pessimistically about then
from KDIC, Cloud made a statement that
is perhaps applicable to the overall
problem of student theft at Gdnnell. He
said: “You have to depend on student
honesty, and hi have to admit that stu-
dent honesty is, well, sort oi question-
able.”
