Grinnell College

Dear Mike:

You and l have talked several times about dissent and disruption at
Grinnell, and I thought I might offer some of my views on these matters for
your readers. You will recall in my remarks to the faculty on the ”state
of the College” {which you reprinted in the November 2l issue of the S"B)
that I touched on some of the problem connected with the emotional climate
of the campus, particularly the difficult one of drawing the line between
the protection of criticism and dissent and the prevention of actions that
would interfere or threaten to interfere with the established and scheduled
programs of the College. whether they be academic or extravcurricular or
social.

All of us here at Grinnell want an environment in which students and
faculty feel free to criticize the policies oi the College or the society
outside. The process of examining. of questioning, of asking why or wh-
not. of free inquiry generally, is crucial to the kind of education G'i
is supposed to stand tor. The right or expres ing criticism and disagi
ment is part of the process So also. we all need to be reminded oc a
ally. i the right to disagree with those who disagree. The name that edu‘
cational institutions most frequently give to 'is process of free inquiry
and the right of students. faculty, and vi itoi to the campus to expreSs
different points of view 5 "academic freedom.” In its application, the
words usually mexn the right of professors to teach what they believe is
pertinent to the ' subject, of scholars to engage in the inquiry and inves~
tigation that serves tu advance knowledge. and of students to learn and to
express their views. free from pressures or interference from outside.

The tradition of Grinnell College as a sanctuary for this kind of aca—
demic freedom i‘ a long one; and careful cultivation of the tradition is
perhaps the chief reason why the College has been able to attract the re-
spect and affection of superior teachers and students. The tradition has
not made the College an especially popular institution: that is. ”popular”
in the sense that its members are regarded as thinking and speaking and
acting in ways that do not upset or threaten conventional or safe uays of
doing things. In fact. the College has taken this risk oy trying to main,
tain an environment in which critic ‘m and dissent may be freely expre-sed.
The result i. a liberal campus. yer; tole ant. and from within and without
