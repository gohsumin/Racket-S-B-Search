“The Problem oi
(Quantity' in an open lecture at
Herrick Chapel. “There has been
a stupendous increase in the
amount or what there is to be
known. but no corresponding in

human mind to know it.

“The measure or capacity
tor knowledge and understand-
illg is the amount or thinking
that a single mind can do in‘
single iiictime." Toynhec
said. “This is so because all
thought takes place in some
individual mind. There are no
such things as collective minke

Davis presented his own cutie

this absolute increase in

“The relevant iact is the ratio
between the individuals capac-
ity and the amount of what

_there is to be known." he said.
“‘and in our time. this has in-

creased out of all proportion to
the increase in the individuals
capactty."

Admitting that no satrsiactory‘

solution oi this intellectual prob-

decried both ~tearn work and
