Greenfield Gamble: For Grade

LOGICAL BLACKJACK

BY DAVE HORWA‘TT
S & B staff Writer

in the final rush of last
lemester when most students
were writing two papers a
night, Tom Greenfield, North
Younker sophomore, was sit-
ting in a dimly lit backmom
playing blackjack.

Greenfield was fulfilling an
assignment in Logic (Phiios
ophy 121).

The professor of the course,
John Worley, gave students the
opportunity to do either an
hourly, or a paper or proiect
dealing with some facet of logic.
Greenfield chose to give a dem-
onstration of a winning strategy
in the game of blackjack.

Several years ago Greenfield
read about Edward 0. Thorpe, a
Professor of Mathematics at the
University of California, who
with the aid of a computer, de-
veloped a system of winning at
blackjack using the casino rules
at Las Vegas,

Thorpe published a book in
1962—13er The Dealer which
advanced several schemes for
coming out ahead in betting on
"twenty-one".

The book was so successful
that Las Vegas gambling houses
made rule changes to try to
compensate.

Greenfield had trouble finding
a copy of Thorpe's book, but
finally got one mailed to him
from a Chicago bookstore. He
selected the ”count-ten” system
for his demonstration.

The game of Blackjack works
like this:

The dealer deals two card:
to himself and to each of the
other players. Usually the deal-
er has one card showing and
the other face down, or “in the
hole." The player receives both
cards down.

Every card has a numerical
value; face cards a value of
ten; the Ace a value of one or
eleven (at the player's discre-
tion); and other cards have
their face value.

The object of the game for

the pin or is to obtain a total
from his cards that is greater
than the dealer's, while not cite
ceeding twenty—one—When he's
“busted”.

An Ace and a Card valued at
ten give the player a “natural
blackjack”. If the player is
dealt a pair then he may play
each card as a separate hand.
Betting can vary from a 25s
minimum to $150. The player
is betting on what he thinks his
advantage is against the dealer.

Thorpe simply enumerate;
methods for examining the
hands of the player and dealer.
Working with probabilities gives
the player a strategy of betting
that will bring him out ahead
over a period of time—any<
where from one to ten percent
ahead.

Essentially the ten count sys<
tem has the player count the
number of tens (there are SIX-
tieen in a full deck,) and non-
tens from cards shown.

As the ratio of non-tens to tens
decreases, the player's chance:
increase.

Thorpe used his ten count
method in Nevada. Working
with 510,000 capital loaned by
two speculative millionaires
Thorpe doubled the capital otter
thirty hours of conservativt
betting.

Tom Greenfield used I verv
rion oi the ten count strategy
from .Bent The .Dealer.. He
played a total of 346 hands us~
ing a minimum bet of 35 and a
maximum of :25. Out of a hypo-
thetical 52.340 bet. Greenfield
won $240 or better than ten per-
cent profit.

However Greenfield only
played about 15 hands with
Worley, which were not enough
to show the advantage of the
player with the Thorpe system.
in the half hour game Green-
field came out a few dollars be-
hind on the betting.

Worley commented on Greeni
field’s brief demonstration. “it’s
like a high-jumper who learns
to jump six feet. When he goes
to show somebody he only
jumps five feet and smacks his
teeth on the bar.”

Worley was pleased that a
student did something creative
with logic, and Tom Greenfield
got an ”A" for his trouble.

PANCAKE PROTEST

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11
(LNS) — Former Stanford Stu-
dent Body President Dave Hal'-
ris led 400 demonstrators this
morning through his second re~
fusal of induction and a pan-

Berkeley.

Harris arrived for induction
on a bus at 6' 15 a.rn. to meet
his supporters, all in a cheery
mood, and an army of the press

About the men facing induc-
tion, he said, “These cats are
not here because they want to
be; they’re here because they're
afraid. This whole society has
made Ulem afraid for the last
19 years.” He added, “Let them
do what they want with my
body. They can't take my
mind."

Ripping up his induction pa-
pers, Harris said, “Those people
I was supposed to kill and those
people going into the army and
all oi you are my brothers . . .
i call on every person registered
with the SS system to refuse to
cooperate with that system;
those who have not registered
to refuse to register; those in
the Army to refuse to cooper-
ate."

At the pancake gig, Hester
Butterfield and Dr. Genevieve
Knupper read statement of sup-
port abetting Lloyd Dennis, who
will refuse induction in Cleve-
land tomorrow. ,
