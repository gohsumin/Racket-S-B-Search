lite at LeMoyne Gets Comment
From Grinnell Exchange Students

By Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens

As exchange students at Lee
Moyna this semester, we‘re of
course interested in the war
for civil rights, seemingly be-
ing waged both in Selma and
in the 5&3. We, like everyone
else, believe we have all an-
swers to the problems at hand
and wish to ofier our services.

The “cook’s tour” offered by
our associate didn’t seem to
quench any insatiable‘scholar-
ly curiosities, so we decided to
pick up where the cook’s tour
left off.

To see LeMoyne in 6% min-
utes is just that: to see Le-
Moyne and not understand any-
thing about the oollege. it is
possible to see Memphis in
three hours or to see the en—
tire breadth of the United
States in 10 hours.

LeMoyne is more than 6V2
minutes; It is people, dedicated
people, thirsty people, striving
people, restless people, hopeful

people. It is Memphis, the gate-
way to the South, and a lead-
er in the civil rights struggle
for the entire Mid-South areal

LeMoyne is located in a
neighborhood which has, in
years past, known violence as
its only law. Across the street
in front of the school is a gov»
ernment housing project which
replaced the poverty of an
earlier slum. Directly behind
the school is a poverty stricken
housing area which is being
considered for Improvement by
the housing authority. In this
setting, LeMoyne represents
the torch of hope for many
students in a world in which a
college education is becoming
a requirement for any person.
The majority of LeMoynltes
are struggling upward against
their impoverished way of life

Ask a LeMoyne student why
he is here and he will reply
that he could not afford to go
anywhere else. Ask him why he
did not go to Memphis State.
a large state university which
was recently integrated and
which is less expensive, and he
will say that LeMoyne is a
better school, which is true,
The LeMoyne faculty is young,
dedicated, and burning with
the desire to help all their stu-
dents find opportunities for ad-
vancement and success.

What about the students?
There is not the academic
orientation here that exists at
Grinnell. The emphasis here is
more practicall Included in the
curriculum is a program that
allows the student to take edu-
cation courses which certify

Campus Individualism Seen as
Negative Rather than Positive

To the Editori

Recent events would seem to
declare a sweeping victory for
the cause of “individualism” on
the Grinnell campus. In €87
sense, this philosophy seems
to state that we are each unique
individuals with unique inter-
ests and needs. Since this is so,
the most desirable atmosphere
for campus living is one which
allows each to pursue his own
interests and satisfy his desires

in the manner which best suits‘

his personality, providing, of
course, in doing so he does not
interfere with the rights of oth-
ers.

There are several elements
in this philosophy which are
deeply disturbing. In adopting
such a philosophy, it would
seem that in reality what is oc-
curring is an abdication of the
responsibility of concern for
one’s fellow student.

I do not believe that an indi-
vidual’s concern for the well-
being of another individual will
disappearl Rather, it would
seem that we are denying any
collective concern or responsi-
bilit for the well-being of an
individual as a member of a
common community Grinnell
individualism seems to be noth-
ing more than ego-centrism un»
der an acceptable name.

This all seems rather ironic
when it is placed in the con-
text in the recent racial cris-
is in Selma, in which all have
declared their common con-
cern for the rights and well-
being of individuals far re-
moved from our community,
and from our daily lives

The second element which
disturbs me is the theme of
“individual freedom” which is
implicit in this new philosophy.

 

This theme could certainly not
be called a new one. However,
Grinnell, as usual, has given
a different slant to it. We seem
to be constantly demanding a
kind of freedom which is “free-
dom from" - freedom from
rules and restrictions, freedom
from demands, freedom from
responsibility.

My conception of true free-
dom, that which cannot be de-
nied, must be “freedom to”
and must be accompanied by
a high degree of personal re-
sponsihility.

Thus it would seem to me
that the philosophy of “indi-
vidualism" at Grinnell is essen-
tially negative rather man pos-
itive

This is not the Grinnell to
which I came as a freshman
Were I a prospective fresh»
man now, I am not sure I would
come.
