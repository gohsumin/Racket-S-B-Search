ings, and visit old friends.

couple before Christmas vaca-
tion. “1 have to be home to
cook Christmas dinner,” Lady
Brogan told one of her class-
es. Sir Denis explained that the
English have caught on to the
American custom of turkey din-
ner for Christmas. They have
quite a turkey business. He
told me that just before the
holiday season there is a great
deal of hijacking of turkeys, es—
pecialiy around London. “It’s
the nearest thing we have to a
wild west,” he said bemused,
“except, of course, train rob-
beries.”

I asked Lady Brogan just
'what she teaches an archaeo-
logy claSs in the middle of
Iowa. “1 tell them about inter-
esting archaeological sights in
the Mediterranean,” she said.
Her first trip to Lybia, where
she has done a great deal of
work, was in 1948, when she
was among the first group of
British archaeologists allowed
in North Africa after World
War 11.

Though he is mainly known
as a historian and so regards
himself. Sir Denis now devotes
considerable time to surveying
contemporary life in Great
Britain, France, and the United
States. Though he is perhaps
more in touch with U. S. here
in Grinnell, I wondered if he
felt less in touch with the world
here than in London. He admit-
ted that this was the case, but
said that as far as news is con-
cerned, one is better off in
Grinnell than in North Afric

When Lady Brogan is _
Noﬂh Africa, she is sometimes
several days away from the
news. She explained that she
only learned of the assassina-
tian of President Kennedy the
following day beCause she
chanced to meet a man who
knew of it.

Sir Denis told of his exper-
ience in England in connec-

 

* ‘k *

(ion with the Kennedy assassi-
nation. He was at the London
airport when he received a
call to report immediately to
a Television Company. The
President died while he was
en route downtown. Brogan
went on the air that night with
a commentary.

He explained that, much to
its continued embarrassment,
BBC was the only network in
the world which played situa-
tion comedies for some time
after the President’s death.
This happened because all the
top men were at a party and
nobody was available with the
authority to change the pro-
gramming,

Sir Denis Brogan was also
featured in a BBC commen-
tary the next day. “1 said about
the same thing both times,” he
told me, "but,” he laughed, "1
got paid twice for it.”

I concluded then that he was
EEC's “expert on American af-
fairs.” Sir Denis smiled and
said “My son does more of
that."

“Why, Denis, you are!" his
wife corrected.

“X‘m paid for it," he replied
modestly, and smiled.

There is a majority of women
in the American studies semi-
nar which he teaches, so I
asked how he liked teaching
them. Sir Denis said that wom-
en in the classroom don’t both»
er him; indeed, one might think
he rather enjoys it. He feels
strongly that women should go
to college, and explained that
though it is harder for them to
get in most colleges at. Cam-
bridge, the university is about
one-sixth female. Oxford draws

about onerfourth of its students

from the fairer sex.

Last week when the seminar
met, Sir Brogan made a plea
that the male students, in parti-
cular, come to see him regard-
ing paper topics. He said that
since he got his office, he has

had many female callers, but
no men. Perhaps this is a com-
ment on the Grinnell social sit-
nation

The Brogans are getting to
know more students as the
semester progresses. They en-

joyed the color of the Home-
coming weekend and comment-
ed particularly aboth the floats
and the ingenuity of them. They
even attended the football
game, which they also enjoyed
——especially since the right
team won.

Both visiting professors are
furthering their contact with
students at weekly dinner meet-
ings with'small groups of stu-
dents
room.

If you chance to meet a white
haired gentleman with a rud—
dy complexion, and probably a
red shirt or vest, accompanied
by his most charming wife, rest
assured that this time the in-
vading red»coats are welcome
and friendly. Take a few min-
utes to get to know them. You’ll
be glad you did.
