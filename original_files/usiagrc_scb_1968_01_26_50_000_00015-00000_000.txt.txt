By J. RAZ

Zugzwang is intended to increase the public appetite for the
game of Chess and to provide wholesome meals in sizable chunks
as well as titiliating tidbits of knowledge. In coordination wiLh the
newly formed Chess Club, Zugzwang wiu otter a menu of delicious

Chess activities and tangy events.

Are you a Chess gourmet and do you have any private
recipes? Mail your games to Box 886.

Suffering from indigestion? if there is a demand, an occasion-
al article may be devoted to Avalon Hill Games, Backgammon,
Risk, Diplomacy, Monopoly, Checkers etc.

Requests for articles should include name, box number, and
telephone number. Articles may also be submitted for complete
inclusion in Zugzwang. For example, ii you feel you know a win-
ning strategy tor the Germans in “The Battle of the Bulge" ieel

free to submit your battle plans.

Are you lonely? Have you acquired useless skills which be-
cause of the lack of an opponent are becoming rusty and even
more useless? Zugzwang can serve you as a public kiosk for such

announcements.

(Zugzwang, by the way, is a Chess term which is used to de-
scribe the unfortunate position which a player is in when any and
every move he makes leads to an immediate weakening of his

position — of loss of material.)

The Chess Club will meet regularly at 8 RM. Thursdays at the
coffee house in the Forum. The Club is organizing a team which
will Compete with other clubs in the area. Courses will be avail-
able for beginners, and the Club will stock any available Chess

publications.

@ RADIO

(continued from Page 7)

editor Barry Ancona will have
a Friday and Saturday allrnighta
er of “folkrrock and witty com—
ments.”

Recordings of Convocation
speeches, Lenox Quartet con—
certs and coffee house perform-
ances, will be broadcast, as well
as Theatre Department plays,
News Department reports ~—
those on drugs, student power,
and Vietnam are in the offering
—and some BBC transcriptions.

To help the disc jockeys
broadcast these shows, says
Cloud, student control operators
will be helping regulate and op—
erate the equipment.

The question OI Student access
to FM radios was brought up
two years ago when the idea of
the present campus radio was
germinated. Students were
pulled on their access to FM
radios,

Roughly 25 per cent of the
student body did not own, or
have access to someone who
owned an FM radio.

Cloud says that the radio
heads are planning to supply at
cost AMAFMVAFC radios to stu<
dents. The cheapest purchase
price for such a radio is esti-
mated at Sis.

initiated by station manager
Armajani two years ago, the
present radio has suffered many
setbacks. Starting with its sup-
posed formationhy SGA in
1566, many big efforts such as
Convocation have taken pre-
cedence with the administration.
Even after soA agreed to fi-
ance the idea, the administra-
tion did not seem to approve,
Armajani indicated before an
open Senate meeting in Novem-
her.

It was not until the end at
Convocation in November, notes
Cloud, that the administration
could devote “full efforts” to
the formation of the amorphous
campus radio station.

At the Open SGA meeting that
Armajani spoke at, he had ex-
plained the board’s en masse
resignations pro—dated January
3. If the radio were operating
by then, he had explained, the
resignations would be with.
drawn. Otherwise Armajani
said he’d reorganize the staff
when the radio would begin op
eration.

The Executive Board, all ex-
cept Program Director Craig
Allin, IS still intact, Allin re—
signed at finals time last so-
mester. The present staff of
over 130, according to Cloud, Is
“pretty much as it was last
spring."

Over The Border

KAMP IN GANADA

By JEAN VANDERVODRT
0f the 5&3’5 Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Canadian radio
greets newcomers warmly.

“There are more people com-
ing into Canada than leaving it.
We welcome these young people
as Canada‘s new life blood,"
broadcasts declare.

Dick Kamp, Grinnell sopho<
more from West Norris Hall,
spent several days during Christ-
mas in Toronto, Canada, with
a group of draft-dodgers. Kemp
disparages Canada’s optimistic
welcome to their “new life
blood."

Canadian resistance centers
report that a minimum of 2,000
American draft-dodgers to a
possible 7,00" are in Canada
now. The drait age Americans
who leave to escape the 05.
perhaps as much as the army
find easy sanctuary, sponsors,
and centers to help locate lodg»
ing and employment there.

The resisters Kamp met could
Live with their situation no bet-
ter In Canada than in the U.
he opined in an interview when
he returned to his home in Chi-
cago atter the trip.

An overcrowded, run-down
house was Kamp’s residence
while in Toronto. A resistor
from New York rented it and
eight others usually stayed
there; three or four who helped
pay rent and three or four who
crashed.

"Only one had a job," Kamp
said. "He worked in a factory."

“They can get jobs pretty
easily, but they don’t have much
ambition at all.”

Kainp along with two Detroit
acquaintances traveled from
there to Toronto. One of the De-
troit men had spent 17 months
in the army.

He was on leave now because
he had chased his barracks
mates out at gunpoint and swal-
lowed an overdose of sleeping
pills when he learned he was
being sent to Vietnam.

The hostility, the extreme
apathy characterized the con-
fusion and fruslratiolt of the re-
sisters for Kamp. The ones who
were running from the dratt,
from the us. government and
who didn’t really think beyond
that were the ones who didn't
do well, he said.

“The ones who have done
well are artists, people who
planned to go to school before
they went, or people skilled in
a trade."

The majority of the resisters

have not yet broken away from
the United States, Kamp thought.

“An American kid in Canada
is not concerned about Canada,
He knows about 50 per cent as
much about Canada as about
the U.S."

“Their friends are in the 11.5.
One had a girl friend in New
York; one had a girl friend in
Detroit, I think, They didn’t
know anyone there. "

Trips back over are the big
thing. "One deserter from the
army — he was a speed-head4
boasted that he had gone over
the border 7 times (at Windsor
—it’s not hard them)."

“He would leave when the
FBI got on to him. They came
in the front door and he left by
the back.”

While some resistors just
exist, others become gang-ho
Canada, Dick observed. They
idealize Canada at the expense
of the United Slates.

"They are becoming Cana-
dian nationals. They don’t rear
lize some things. America al-
most necessarily has a totali.
tarian son of government while
Canada Is small and the govern-
ment doesn’t have to be so com-
plete ~ there’s sort of a pro
vincialism about it.”

“They don’t recognize that
Canadian industry is an exiew
sion of the United States.
Canada is just one more pawn
in the countervailing power
structures and it acts as a
pawn."

It isn’t a new idyllic life they
are starting, Kamp decided.
They carry over their old lite
so much it deadens the new.
“Some of them were Southern,"
Kamp said, “A Negro guy want-
ed to stay at the house, but
when they found out that ha
didn‘t have any money, they
were very condescending. That’s
what got me; they were still
being Americans."

Would he go?

“At least i can think serious-
Iy about it now, i wouldn‘t go
as an American nalional."

One who went was John
Phillips, former Grinneil Col-
lege student. A story about
Phillips and a picture of him
taken by Henry Wilhelm, anoth-
er former Grinnell student, are
printed In this week’s Satur-
day Evening Post.
