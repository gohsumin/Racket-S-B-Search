SCARLET AND BLACK

scholar in Alina.

Operating under the rule. The best way to
know it is to see it," the male contingent of Gr-iniiell
in Africa undertook a satari through East Atrica. This
journey took place during our seven week summer
vacation. The distances being rather great, walking
was out at the question, so we resorted to a tour-
whccled monster known as the Gray Gern. ln lays
man's language this relers to a 1956 Land Rover-
truck, a bit the worse tor wear when we started and
even more so now. With beds. cooking stovc, and Ollie
or equipment we became a sell sulticicnt untt, a fact
which proved very usetul

Malosa school being located in the southern part
or. Nyasaland, we tirst had to traverse the Gun miles
to the northern tip of the country. Roads were ins
troduced here about so years ago but one could hardly
say that an extensive turnpike system had been de—
vcloped. Thus .we bounced along, at times not being
certain which end was tip, over roads that make the
Lake Acre route seem like a super highway. There
are many times when one might question whether
they are even one lane. However. the country through
ivt'hich we passed is some ot the most beautilul l have
ever seen. but at the same time extremely primitive,
These mountains and valleys are from the southern
end of the Great Rirl. Valley, a'phenomenon ot na»
ture quite unique in itsell.

ALL ALONG THE way one sees the typical tiny

quaint that one otteii tor-gets the apalling state ot
povclty which they represent, a tact which can not
help but to arouse the mind oi one coming lroni
Galbrailh's Attlnent Society The urban centers
through winch oire passes are images ol a tr-ontier-
town in the wild west with the row at Asian stores,
police station, and government headquarters or boma
surrounded by native huts

The people themselves are extremely triendlv. al—
tlrouglr a bit shy ot strange characters such as Hoth
and Herman These rural people seem very happy and
clicerl‘ut, and quite unaware ot the rigors ot so-call-
ed civilized modern society. There may be much
truth in the old saying, “ignorance is bliss."

Oh we drive until reaching the custoirrs post,
where after the usual amount of red tape plus coin»
plications over a wrong engine number on the Gray
Ger-ii, we pass into Tanganyika. From here on we are
aware of a noticeable rinprovemcnt in conditions The
land, although still very mountainous, begins to open
up. with much less brush, larger tields, more spacious
huts and better dressed people Here and there we
see sisal and tea estates with some machinery whlcll
makes an old town boy ieel more at home One flat
tire, two electrical tires, onc delay due to tappets
and two days later, we reach the center of Tanganyi-

stock population is considerably heavier, although the
quantity tar outweighs the quality.

From here we push on toward the coast and Dar-

development with many estates and much better
roads, some even paved. We have now come from
the high cool mountains to the low scacoast where
temperatures, humidity, and rainfall show remarkable
increases.

The city ol Dar is an interesting mixture of old
and new: of European, Arab and Atrican. Land is
no problem so the city is spread over a wide area
with government buildings and shopping center in the
middle around the harbor. The whole atmosphere is
very cosmopolitan Having taken advantage of en-
tertainments ot the city, we made preparations tor a
visit to the island of Zanzibar, center ot old Arab
slave trade. Zanzibar is located 45 miles from Dar
and hoping to get the real teel. we chose to go over
by native boat called a dhow.__

As things turned out we get more of a real feel
than expected. These dhows are the present versions
of those used by the Arab traders for many centuries
along the coast. Many still use sails but others like
the one we took have been fitted with engines. They
haul small loads of trcight between the ports along
the coast. The captain and crew were just like out of
a book and of course could speak almost no English
so conversation was limited, We departed at 5 pm,
and arrived in Zanzibar harbor at 1 am. where we
anchored tor the night. it was a wonderful star-lit
night tor sleeping. but trying to sack out on piles oi
rope, oil drums, sacks of grain and fruit made us
