A trilogy dealing with .the
oppression of the Jews and util-
izing Jewish folklore, the play
increases in intensity as it pro-
gresses.

The first drama, “A Tale of
Shelm.” is a “gay, bouncy sort
of thing,” according to Freed-
man. “Though an undercurrent
of humanity and sadness runs
through it, it tends to laugh
away oppression.”

A tone of “gentle criticism"
pervades “Eontche Schweig,"
a drama» of a soul on trial in
heaven. Freedman stated, “In
this second stage of the trilogy

words of the angel for the de-
fense extend the gently critical
tone,

The third part of the trilogy,
”The High School,” is a direct
statement against the oppres-

lieves it deals not only with the
Jewish problem, but with prob—
lems that confront all human-
ity,

“The theme is universal; it
treats the essence of the prob-
lem rather than the outward
manifestations,” the director
stated.
