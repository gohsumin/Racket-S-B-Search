of judging which is better and
which is worse. A carpenter must
know what is _meant by
“straight”, it he is to
manufacture a ruler which,
though not ideally straight, is
almost straight. Similarly, to say
and know that one kind of action
is just and another unjust, one
must have a fair understanding
olwhat justice is; lor if not, what
he considers just action becomes
vague, capricious, varying from
individual to individual, and
finally useless.

Fifth, just as there is an art
of making good chairs, good
violins, and good houses, and
such an art requires knowledge
as well as practice in accordance
with that knowledge, so there is
an art of Coming to know both
me habits which lead to a
pleasant life and the manner of
getting those habits. And just as
the productive arts are not
acquired without discipline and
ellort, so in the case of the proper
lhabits. So allowing students
complete freedom of action in the
name of “selfrrealization” and
other such amorphous terms
amounts to allowing a learner oi

instruction, or a thief to “realize”

pleasures? In general, what are
the various kinds of things called
“good"? Some goods are ex
ternal, for example, houses,
property, money, and the like;
others are in men themselves, lor
example, health, the pleasures of
the mind, and the pleasures of
the senses. There is another way
of sub-dividing good, namely,

into those which are pursued lor
their own sake and are ends in
themselves and into those which
are pursued for the sake of
something else and are means
or instruments to an end.
Evidently, the ends (assuming
they are good) are better than
the means to them. Riding to the
stadium and buying a ticket are
means to an end, which is watch-
ing the game. Similarly, we
buy groceries in 'order‘to enjoy
a good meal; we do not enjoy
eating in order to buy more
groceries. Other activities which
are ends in themselves are these:
listening to music, seeing a
movie, reading a novel, being at
a party, playing a game, in-
venting machines, doing
research, and sex. So students
go to college to get an education.
But why? In order to better
themselves, which implies: in
order to lead an enjoyable lile,
a happy life. This does notmean
that the pursuit of the means is
painful. lt olten is, though it need
not be, and whether it is painful
or not often depends on the
person’s attitude. Still, the end
is usually more pleasurable than
the means. What about health,
is it a means to an end? Health
is in men, and its absence
diminishes or obstructs the
pleasures ol die mind and or the
senses. Anyway, health is a good
thing, and the leeling of health
incrﬁses all the othJ pleasures;
and we need not be too academic
about its nature here. We might

also add this, that many ends
cannot be realized without the
means; so to disregard the
means or to try to achieve the
ends in such a manner that the
means towards those ends are
barred is to make also the at-
tainment ol the ends impossible.

The central problem is whether

To date the prospects are not

To The Editor:

A “Reading guide" to wading
through Crossett‘s latest “con-
tribution” (or “What is Good
Journalism,” 5&3, Feb. 27,
1970): Start at the last paragraph
with, “Each editor starts from
scratch. Some have gotten better-
like Mr. Ancona and Mr. Arieti;
some have gotten worse—like Miss
Neuman and Mr. Brandon” Stop.
Now for “better“ substitute”
“status quo” or ”conservative”
or “reactionary;" for “worse”
use “liberal,” ”leftist,” “pinko-
