By JUDY scorr

SGA began its push tor more
student involvement Wednesday at
a coffee hour called by Steve
Kent to present various organiza-
tions to the campus.

Nine representatives spoke at
the atternooii event, each one
stressing that their particular or—
gaulzations needed more help and
more Willingstoswork members.

Tom Lane, president or the in-
ternational Relations Club, ex-
pressed one general attitude ot the
group in saying he “couldn’t un-
derstand this year’s amount of
apathy."

Dan Bucks of Young Democrats
declared his irritation with people
who oIIered their help until asked
to stuff mailboxes or “other such
dirty work.”

Bucks said he was somewhat
critical or the political program
and was becoming less and less
enamoured of trips to hear politi-

”I wonder about the educational
value of such trips." he said. “i

 

S. S. Grinuell Soils
To Aid in Viel Nom

After Long Rest

Grinnell as a small Midwestern
liberal arts college. in theory it
not practice, remains a bastion of
the traditional American virtues of
patriotism, honesty, and persever-
ance. In honor of this position of

rural respectability and higher
learning, Grinnell had a victory
named alter it during World War
no Perhaps more in keeping with
Grinnell tradition, it was Sophie
Tucker, the last of the red hot
mamas. who christened the S S,
Grinnell Victory 21 years ago.

And as is the coming fate of
Grinnell grade and students, so it
is with Victory —« she has been
called back to duty as in result of
the military build up in Viet Nam.
Displaying those characteristic
which Grinnell so desperately
Strives to instill in its student body,

try well in both World War II and
Korea and in transporting Ameri-
can foreign aid cargoes from 1945
to 1947. It is one of the 21 Victory

also wonder if the newsletter is
that much help or stirs up that
much interest.”

A new political outlook is in the
making for YD‘s according to
Bucks. Campaigns are to move
“more towards the intellectual
grain with more valuable dis
cussions than What has been done
in the past." In the planning stage
are discussions with Joseph Wall
(history) on jury trials in the
South.

Y 0 u n g Republicans' leader
George Wittgrar was inclined to
disagree wtth Bucks, He supported
political trips, declaring he hoped
the YR’s could continue to have
actual contact with Republican
leaders

”We also hope,” he said, “that
our newsletter serves as an im<
portant forum for our group.”

Wittgrat stated that an import.
ant aim of YR‘s in the future
would be to broaden campus poli-
tics [ram a mere partisan levels

5&3 editor Bob Hodieme stated
that besides earnestly needing
people who are looking for a job
with responsibility, the newspaper
would appreciate constructive
criticism and suggestions,

A plea tor girl photographers
was presented by Henry Wilhelm
or the Cyclone. “We need them to
catch the more intimate aspects
at South Campus,” lie explained.

The Cyclone, Wilhelm said, also
needs informed people to write on
ditierent campus organizations. It
needs sales department help and
applicants for nexl year’s editor
and business manager.

Jeanne Cook represented Reach,
a group working with the Grillnell
community teenagers. Tutoring by
college students is its most success-
iul area. Reach, along with Uncle
Sam’s club, works intimately with
me town to spur the imagination
and skills of its young people.

The Board of Religion was pre-
sented by Art Arnold as hoping to
have an increase in social action,
working largely in Gn‘nnell,
