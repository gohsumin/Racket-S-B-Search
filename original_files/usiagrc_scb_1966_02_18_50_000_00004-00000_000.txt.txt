D.M. Project Meeting ,
Emphasizes Expansion

Members of the Des Moines
Project stressed organization and
expansion in their south Lounge
meeting Tuesday evening.

The establishment of permanent
committees, regular open meet-
ings in a more public place and
community organizing orientation
workshops will highlight the
group's attempts, according to Bill
Downey, project chairman.

These eitorts are an “attempt
to iniorm and interest as many
people around Grinnell as we can
in the project," Downey said.

in explaining the group’s pur<
pose, Downey expressed a con-
cern that the poor people in big
cities can be a “forgotten people."

Billy King, community organiz-
er in Des Moines, reviewed the
project's history and outlined iu-
ture plans. The main efforts in
the past have been concerning
housing and the organization oi
block meetings.

King touched on the success oi
rent strikes in the Walnut Hills
aiea, where the project is work-
ing. He expressed the hope oi es-
tablishing a tenants' union.

Other future plans include a free-
dom school, touching on matters
oi Negro history, community or-
ganizing and the weliare system.
King hopes to expand this into a
freedom house where neighbo
hood people could come to talk
over their problems.

Summer research programs are
tentatively planned on the War on
Poverty, board oi education, and
city government structure. King
explained that students would do

the research, but “it will be up
to the neighborhood to decide what
they want to do with it."

Des Moinesproject workers will
participate Saturday in it Work-
shop on Methods of Community
Action. Bernard LaFayette, jr.,
director of the Urban Affairs Pro-
gram oi the American Friends
Service Committee Chicago otfice
will speak. LaFayette has done
community organizing in ,the
South, He is a graduate of Fisk
University.

College workshops on commun-
ity organizing will begin next
Tuesday, directed by Jean Vander-
voort.

The project in Des Moines is
currently atiiliated, through the
Walnut Hills Neighborhood Union
Community improvement Prjoect,
with the War on poverty, Downey
said they have no other aitilia-
tions, but may try to bring in
another full - time organizer
through 5135. Downey added. how-
ever, that the project would re
main “autonomous”.

Written by Tom Jones and Har—
vey Schmidt, The Fantasticks was
projected and designed tor ott-
broadway with a minimal empha-
sis on set and eflects, so that in-
stead oi attempting to artificial-
ly recreate moonlight, the audi-
ence is induced to a state of
“moonlight of the mind.” Accord-
ing to the record jacket blurb,
characters in The Fantasticks inr
elude a boy, a girl, two iathers,
and a wall.

Note Coed Benefits;
It Could Be Worse

To the Editor:

Perhaps the ladies oi South
Campus would be interested to
know that in Ahmednegar, india,
Joan Orr and i recently visited
with Wayne and Clara Denny.
Mr. Denny tphysics) has been
teaching at Ahmednegar College
while on leave irom Grinnell. The
current “scandal" on campus —
which might result in o with-
drawal from college _. was that
a girl had been seen having a con-
versation with a boy. This is, at
course, no reason to iorego pro-
test (such as the bicycle letter)
but it does help, sometimes. to
count our blessings.

Pickets Not News

To the Editor:

Regarding the recent pickcting
at o CIA oiiicial here at Grinnell.
it seems strange that such an un-
spectacular event involving such
a small number oi people could
receive nationwide publicity. The
picketlng had little popular sup-
port :iiid hardly a noticeable im~
pact on the campus and yet it was
considered “nesworthy” by the
Associated Press and news media
around the nation. It seems like-
1y that Grinnell’s student report-
ers have become infatuated with
the sight ot their stories in print
and have sensotionahzcd an oc-
curance as insignificant as the
Tuesday night advanced bridge
