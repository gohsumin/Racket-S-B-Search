GA vs. Faculty Committee in

Resolution Voted,
Protests Dralted
Ry SGA Branches

. By Bob Hodlemo

'A flurry of activity in all
branches oi the SGA with regard
to a dispute with the iaculty and
administration over jurisdictional
Ind due process violations has re-
sulted in one resignation, one
meeting, three stilt letters of com-
plaint, one executive cabinet-pri-
mary court proposal, and one
Student Senate resolution.

The dispute stems from faculty
and administration handling oi
student violations which SGA feels
the primary courts should handle.

Sam Grossman, chiei magis-
trate of the Men’s Primary Court.
resigned, saying in a letter to the
Com? th .

“The office of Chief Magistrate
of the Men's Primary Court seems
to have been proven defunct or
practically non - existent in the
past several months."

A meeting Tuesday afternoon oi
the Faculty Committee on Student
Ailairs, the executive cabinet,
the members of both primary
courts, the acting college presi—
dent, and the taculty chairman to
settle the dispute led the execu-
tive cabinet and the two primary
courts to say, in two separate let-
tors:

It is our impression that the
Committee is unwilling to make
any sort or commitment on points
of jurisdiction and due process,
and preters to maintain the pres-
ent system, which is unacceptable
to us."

Grossman. in his letter put it
more strongly:

“The courses of action, both
executive and judiciary, of the
administration and faculty coin-
mittees have stretched, cramped,
and all but erased the more con
crete delineation of jurisdiction
and due process which are round
in the SGA Constitution.”

Grossman went on to say that
the ”uncalledrior overstepping oi
jurisdictional lines by the admin-

istration and faculty" has been

One Suspended;w
Another in Court

Two women students have re-
cently been involved in disciplin-
ary actions by the college.

One woman was suspended for
three weeks in connection with the
illegal visitation of a nonecollege
man to her room. College stair
members saw what appeared to be
a prowler leaving the window of a
Woman's room about 7:00 a.ml
Feb, 13.

The suspension was handled by
the Faculty Committee on Student
Altairs alter the report was made
to the Dean of Women.

In another case, a woman was
reported for attempted illegal en-
try into the quadrangle alter
hours. The case which was initially
presented to the FCSA was com<
plicated by two previous latenesses
and incorrect representation of the
Iacts. This case, however, has now
been turned over to the Women's
Primary Court. The student court
heard the case last night, and the
decision is pending.

Students Okay
SGA Revisions

Amendments which a re de-
signed to streamline the Grinnell
student government were accepted
yesterday by the student body. By
a margin nt 435733, the students
voted to create an Advisory Coun-
cil to replace the Student Senate.

The amendments, which earlier
were okayed by the Senate 3“,
needed a 60% yes vote to pass;
they received 92%.

Only 43.1% of the students cast
ballots in the lunchline reieren«
dum. ,

in client, the revision makes the
operation at student government
more eiticient by cutting the size
of the legislature and combining
it with the excutlve branch.

The new Advisory Council will
be composed of 21 members — one
member from each hall, the Com?
president, and the SGA president.

it approved by the college ad-
ministration, the new system he-
comes effective after spring vaca-
tion.

- Also on the ballot was an amend-
ment which would allow SGA elec-
tions this year only to be held
later than the constitution calls
tor. This section passed by 96%:

Women's Weekend

B rings. Concerts, Film

By Krys Neumun

Women's Weekend, time of reck<
oning for all Grinnell men, starts
today. It features two concerts, a
Bergman ﬁlm, and a guest chapel
speaker.

Jazz singer Nina Simone per-
iorms Saturday night and the col-
lege orchestra plans a special con-
cert on Sunday. The movie “Virgin
Spring” can be seen Friday and
Sunday. The Reverend George
Suidy ol Oakland, California, will
speak on Sunday at 11 em. in Her-
rick Chapel.

This will be the weekend for all
Grinnell girls finally to chose the
man oi their dreams (or at least
one who happens to be sitting next
to them in physics class). Some
even look upon the whole proce-
dure as a truly educational expe-
rierlce; that is, learning the real
courage that is tested on north
campus every weekend of the year.

The idea of Women's Weekend
is casually to ask him to take a
walk, go swimming, come to open
house or a lounge party or to
study. Looking at pictures together
in the fine arts building or in the
Forum is recommended, as is din-
ner and snack dates (Cafe del Foro
would love the business).

The Forum offers unlimited 1105'
sibillties tor originalrtype dates
that were not available last year.
It’s the Grinnell girl's opportunity
to invade the pool room or TV
room, with escort, of course. It’s
her chance to prove her domestic
ventures in the new private kitch-
enettes and dining rooms. And it
she lasts through a hectic Friday
and Saturday (some girls have
been known to brave ten dates in
the Weekend — with ten different
escorts), she can spend a quiet

 

Sunday listening to folk and jazz
music in the listening room and
take advantage of the special tree
juko box music and special grill
prices Sunday night.

Court Feud

SGA Grills Stauss
0n Court Powers;
Issues Still Vague

By Arthur Yellln

"There are probably a few is-
sues there," was the opinion of
Dean James H. Stauss, Acting
President of the College, on the
dispute over court jurisdiction
in cases 0! student violations.
Stauss spoke in a “question and
answer" period at Wednesday
night’s Senate meeting.

In Stauss’s viewpoint, due proc-
ess does exist at Grinnell, but
governmental processes need im-
proved definition and communica-
tion, Replying to a student’s ques-
tion, he said that he did not think
due process can have the same
lorm in all areas of the college.
Stauss's remarks remained vague:
he did not think jurisdiction could
be defined in a formula-like mane
ner in terms of types of olienses.

Stauss said that student court
handling of some conduct cases
apprehended by the administra-
tion is appropriate. In other cases
student court handling is not ap-
propriate. he had no objections,
however, to the student govem-
ment recommendations related to
due process, except for the right
of the accused person to know the
Source or the accusation. .

Shortened Interim
Possible Next Year

The 1965-66 college calendar
may include an “abbreviated
interim" prior to the start of
the second semester, acting
President James H. Stauss said
this week.

Under the tentative plan, stu-
dents would be able to return
to school after Christmas Vaca-
tion on January 12. The first
two or three days would be
devoted to such concerns as the
Rosenfield Lectures.

Senior comprehensive exams
and the Junior Liberal Arts
Exam would be given January
14 and 15. Classes would begin
January 11.

Stauss said that this plan
would enable juniors and sane
iors to get re-oriented before
taking their Comprehensive
exams.

Stauss also noted that one
consideration in dropping the
regular interim was that it was
too financially burdensome.
