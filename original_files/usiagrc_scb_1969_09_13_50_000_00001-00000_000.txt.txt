drew from the college Wednes<
day afternoon following a con-
rerence with Deans Alice Low
and Conney Kimbo earlier in
the day, the 5828 has learned.

Two other students were
placed on conduct probation by
the Deans earlier this week in
unrelated incidents involving
the use of illegal drugs.

Although the Dean’s Office
refused to provide any infor-
mation regarding the cases, the
S“! has learned that the ale
ieged dealer was given the
choice of withdrawing from the
college or racing immediate
Judicial Council action,

Once the student elected to
withdraw, the deans instructed
him to vacate his room immed-
iately. The student left Grinnell
early Wednesday evening.

According to fairly reliable
5&3 sources. the deans learned
that the student was dealing in
mescalina from an informant
who had purchased a capsule
of the .hallucinogen irom him.

As the result of another inci-
dent Sept. 2. a Cleveland
sophomore was placed on con-
duct probation after being hos-
pitalized for an overdose of
several types of drugs.

While under the influence of
a large amount oi hashisll that
he had smoked earlier in the
day, the student took a double-
dose of mescaiine late that
afternoon, Feeling no immeda
late ellects irom the drug, he
took another doublerdose of
mescaline about fifteen minutes
later.

Fellow students found hlln in
a very disturbed state and
attempted to calm him by ad-

ministering Thorazine, a tran-
quilizer, and some sleeping
pills.

The Student seemed to re-
spond and went to bed, but
shortly alterward he suffered
Violent convulsions. After stu~
dents notified the Health Cen-
ter, an ambulance was suiti—
moned. The patient was taken
to City Hospital in critical con-
dition by Grinnell pplice. (Grin-
nell has no ambulance service.)

The overdose almost resulted
in the youth’s death, doctors
reported, but he recovered and
was released from the hospital
the iollowing day. He was
questioned by the police. but
was not charged.

The student was called to the
dean’s office Sept. 3. Rather than
face the prospect of Judicial
Council action, he allowed the
deans to put him on conduct

probation for a year. The deans
also warned the Student to
aVOld future involvement with
illegal drugs.

in a third incident last Satur-
day, a Conference House
sophomore went to the Health
Center alter taking mescaline
and experiencing painiul side
effects. There have been some
indications that the mescaliile
may have contained strychnine.
a poisonous substance ii taken
in large doses. The student was
also placed on conduct pro-
bation aiter conferring with the
deans.

Administration actions appear

to conform with the revised col< .

lege policy on drugs which
states that ‘ “students are
Warned that they will be subject
to disciplinary action up to and
including dismissal him the

gerous and unlawful drugs, and
that they may be subject to
disciplinary action for possess
ion or use."

The Student Handbook also
states that parents of students
placed on conduct probation
will be notified at the dean:
discretion.

The President's Office will
issue a clarification of the
existing drug statement in the
handbook next week, according
to Dean Low. Although she

,could not ‘discuss the contents

of the forthcoming statement,
she indicated that the president
would, in part, comment on the
necessity of maintaining a late
ltude or options ior handling
cases of drug use.

Convocation Opens New Year;
Leggett Calls for ‘New Limits’

 

By TOM THOMAS

A sparse crowd of several
hundred students and facility
members heard President
Glenn Leggett discuss the “Site
nation in which the small pri-
vate college finds itself" as he
addressed the opening convoca-
tion of the 1969-70 academic
year. Also speaking at the
Sept. 3 event in Herrick Chapel
were Dean Joseph Wail, Pro-
fessor John R. Kleinschmidt,
Chairman oi the Faculty, and
James Lew, President of the
Student Government Associa-
tion.

Referring to the small pri-
vate college as “perhaps the
one unique contribution at
America to higher education,"
Leggett traced the history of
such institutions and raised nu-
merous questions ior the iuture.
Leggett obliquely reierred to
the tumultuous experience of
higher education during the
past year, calling the environ-
ment of the collegiate system
“almost terrifyingly reflective
of national agonies,"

“Every institution . . . now.

lem of raising money, educat-

and retaining faculty. but also

FLAG AT HALF-MAST

The Grinnell College flag is

Hershey’s Selective s e r v i c e
System. by the long delayed re-
volt or the American Black, by
the confusion of pornography
and public obscenity with jour.

merit, and by the nalvete of
our laws on alcohol and drugs."

The President told the midi-
ence that “the inevitability or
living with this complex or
problems is the prize that edu-
cational institutions have Won
by putting themselves success-
fully near the center of national
life.”

alleges that because of actions
by Mrs. Ruth Prescott, DireCa

he was “exposed to public
hatred, contempt, and ridicule"
and suffered “irreparable dain-
age to his reputation as a
photographer.”

PPPE Sponsors Julian Bond

Julian Bond, a Georgia state
legislator who is rapidly gaining
national prominence, visited
the campus this weekend as
politician in residence under
the sponsorship of the college’s
Program in Practical Political
Education (PPPE).

Bond, now 29, gained national
exposure last year tlilringtthe
Democratic Convention.

As cochairman of an insub-
gent Georgia delegation. he
played a leading role in the
unseating of the regular
ceorgia delegation. Later in the
Convention. he was nominated
for the vicerpresident spot on
the Democratic ticket. He with-
drew his name because he
failed to meet the minimum age
requirement for the office.

Bond’s entry into politics was
surrounded by controversy. He
was elected to a reapportion-

ment created seat in the Georgia
House oi Representatives in
1965. However, legislators ob<
jetting to Bond’s statements on
the Vietnam War managed to
