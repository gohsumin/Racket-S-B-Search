SELECTIVE SERVICE: DRAFT DEFERMENTS'

By DON HECKER

In the first or this series
of articles, I gave u- brief
explanation of the Selective
Service System’s philosophy of
"Cllanuelingi" At that time, I
said that according to the sys<
tem this was accomplished by_
use of classifications,

Classifications are' divided in-
to three basic categories, serv-
ice classifications (tho regis<
trani is considered available tor,
certain types or work or mili-

tary service), deferments (term,

porary exemptions from mill-
tary service). or exemptions (a
permanent classification for a
registrant who cart never be
available for military service).
. Deierments are temporary
exemptions, granted to a regis<
trant while he is performing
some action that is In the na-
tional interest, or while he is
temporarily unilt for military
servlce,

Service classifications are
granted when there are no more
applicable deferments H when
the registrant is no longer do-
ing anything in the national in-
teresl, or when he is not dis-
qualified physically or mental-
ly, and when he is not needed
for the survival of a dependent.
Sole surviving sons in families
where one male member of the
family died or was totally disk
abled in military service are
also permanently exempted.

Exemptions are intended to
be permanent, as in the case of
the 1V-F, in Whlch tho regis-
trant has on adverse condition
which is assumed to bo un-
changing, and which prevents
his ever being available for
military duty, Of course, if this
condition ends or considerably
diminishes, them is cause for
the Board to reclassify the reg
istrant.

The local board is required to
place each registrant in the
“lowest" possible classification
for which he is eligible A “low"
classification is a temporary
one, while a "high" classifica-
tion is a more permanent one.
For example, if a tullrtime stu.
dent at a college applies for an
170 (Conscientious O bj e c t«
or) classification, his draft
board may not place him in that
category, but can place him in
the 1175 category (student deter-
ment), since this may be the
lowest classification for which
he is qualified. When the 11-3
is no longer available, the reg.
istrant may apply for, and pos<
sibly receive an PO (or similar
classification).

A special deferment which
is often extremely important to
college students, and which
used to be important to grad
students is the 175(C). The
Hm), also a mandatory clas-
sification, is a deferment-fol- one
academic year. it is granted to
an undergraduate student satis-
factorily pursuing a course at
study who has recelved en in-
duction notice. The deferment
lasts until the end of the aca-
demic year. It is not renewable,
and any student who has been
classiﬁed in this deferment once
can never again lie so classl-

' tied.

.This. classification is very im
portant in View of a practice or
some boards'ot drafting R'SBII"

ior student before he has {in-
ished his last year of unden-
graduate college. Should the
student receive an induction no-
tice, he may request and must
receive, an 1-S(C) until he com-
pletes the year of school that
he is in.

The I—Y classification is a
sort of mild IV—F. This classl-
iication is granted to those
persons who are physically un-
fit ’ior service in the armed
forces except in time of nation-
al emergency. A national emer-
gency incidentally, is most like-
ly only to be a war.

Authority for determining LY
eligibility rests with the Sur-
geon General of the Army The
tests. to determine eligib' 'ty
for this classification are given
by the army at the induction
centers when a registrant re-
ports for a physical examina-
tion.

[LA is a deferment which is
granted for employment that is
considered to be essential to the
national illterest. \vhich employ-
ment is in the national interest
is decided by the Director ot
Selective Service on the advice
of the National Security Coun.
oil.

A ll—C deferment may be one
of the few things in the world
that will make you wish you
had decided to spend the rest
of your life farming. This par.
ticulsr deferment is granted to
persons for "essential agricul-
tural employment," and is
something oi a leftover from
the 1940’s when farm produc-
tion did not result in the hug.
surpluses of today.

The ”-8 deferment is the one
most of us are concerned with,
and the one we are most famil-
iar with. when the proper con<
diu'ons are met, it is a mandala
tory classification. There are
six basic conditions:

1. The Student must [9-
quest this deferment from
his local draft board. .

2. His college has sent a
Form No. 109 to the regi5<
trant’s local board, indicat-
ing the registrant is a lull-
time student.

3. The student is receiving
credits toward a degree.

4. The student is taking a
fulltime course load (as {it}
fined by the college).

5. The student is making
“satisfactory progress,” that
is, at the end of his first
year, he has received 25%
of his credits toward gradu-
aiion, at the end of his sec<
and year he has received
50% of his crediLs toward
graduation, and so on,

6. This deferment does not
extend past the student's
twenty-fourth birthday.

, This classification is also
mandatory 101‘ graduate stu.
dents in the fields of medicme.
dentistry, male nursing. and
allied fields (subject to the ad
vice of the National Security
Council). Going into medicine
in graduate school is not a
means of escaping the draft,
however, for persons in these
fields are subject to the “doc-
tor's draft,” which is even more
stringent than the regular
draft. , , ,

in turn:

school; however, after October,
1967, all persons entering grad<
uato school are subject to im-
mediate drait, unless they am
in the “special fields" category.

III-A is the so-called “lather-
hood deferment." It is granted
to men who are married and
have one child (the child need
not yet be born), so long as the
father actally maintains a fam-
lly relationship with the wife
and child.

This classification is normal.
ly not granted to one who has
received a 11-5, unless he can
prove that his being inducted
into the army would cause his
dependents to suffer extrema
hardship.

lV-B is another mandatory
classification, which is granted
to certain elected officials of
the state or federal government.

Anyone who receives a deier<
ment is automatically in the
“extended liability" category.
This means that he may be
drafted at any time until he
reaches age 35. Theoretically,
this is a means of preventing
a man from ”escaping" the
draft by disappearing into the
educational system until he is
26. Age 26 was the previous cul-
olf point, after which you could
not be drafted. This is Still the
case {or men who have never
received a deferment.

Actually, anyone making it
past age 25 is unlikely to be
drafted even it he is in the cute
tended liability category. The
army is not now taking, nor does
lt plan to take men past the
age of to, The army believes
that the younger a man is, the
better soldier he will be, Am
cording to the theory, a young
man has not yet formed many
definite opinions, and his mind
can therefore best be “molded"
into the proper military way or
thinking.

no classification is ever perm.
aneitt.,The local board, upon re-
ceipt of new information about
the registrant can always change
his Classification.

A registrant has certain rights
of appeal. he has the right to
a personal appearance before
his local board, if he sends the
board a request (or a personal
appearance within thirty days
alter he receives his original
notice of classification.

When he receives a classifica-
tion as the result of a personal
appearance, he may also appeal
that to a state board. The state
board may be either in the state
where his local board is located,
or if that. is inconvenient, he
may request that the appeal be
transferred to the state board
where he is employed, or attench
ing school.
