Defends Draft Card Burning:
Sets Up Memorial Scholarship

“I burned my draft card to cre-
ate a dialogue about the war in
Viet Nam," said Steve Smith, for-
merly a University or lowa stu—
dent, in a speech at the State
College or iowa justil‘ying his rad-
ical action. He ielt the burning of
a draft card was a symbolic pro-
test against the war.

“It the government prohi ts
dralt card burning, it is prohibit-
Ing the right of tree protests Free
speech, including free protest, is
tlle backbone of a democracy."

"The word ‘un—Amerlcan' should
be applied only to those who deny
the freedom of speech” Smith felt
that laws against drait card burn-
ing were comparable to suppres-
sion of free speech and in opptr
sition to the first amendment.

“The draft card is only a piece
of paper. I’ve never heard of any~
one being put in prison ior burning
a piece of currency.” Smith con-
cluded that he would go to jail if
drafted.

On January 4. 1966, Samuel
Younge, jr., a Tuskegee institute
student was murdered while para
tictpating in a civil rights activity.
Since Tuskegee and St. Olaf are
sister schools, the students at St.
Olaf decided to set up a memorial
scholarship for a Tuskegee stu<
dent for a single year as an ex—
pression oi their sympathy.

A fast of one meal was the
manner in which St, Olat's parlia-
ment decided to raise the scholar-
ship money. They then solicited

names of students who would do
without their noon meal for a 5in<
gle day. The result was a limited
number of donors who would iast
out of desire not convenience.

It was then decided that the
breakfast fast would receive Wider
support. which it has. The only
trouble, as the St, Olaf paper
points out, is that the additional
donors gained by changing the
time at the fast to breakfast are
those who sleep through it any-
way.

Second, the North Campus resi-
dence system must be made more
ﬂexible. It has become too self-
contai ed, generating its own anti-
intcllectual ethos. An annual ro-
tatlon of students based upon in-
dividual choice would counteract
this tendency and encourage an
outlook which encompasses the
entire college community. Yet the
advantages or the hall system in
providing a focus 01 identity for
incoming freshmen and serving as
a means or local government must
be preserved. Thus house presi-
dents on North campus must con-
tinue to be elected by the resi-
dents of each llall. Also, there
should be no discrimination ac-
cording to class in the residence
system. Freshmen have had an op-
portunity to demonstrate leader-
ship within an integrated campus;
they should not be isolated as
second-class citizens.

Abolition of the Senate is in-
advisable, since the CofHP and
the AWS Board tend to concern
themselves only with domestic
regulations and lack experience
in iulfilling other areas of stu-
dent concern, Rather, a new Sen-
ate should be composed of all
presidents. plus an equivalent
number of representatives elected
at large, who would serve as
spokesmen for the whole elector-
ate. Legislation could be initiated
within the Senate or by the Cofl-iP
and the AWS Board noting sepa~
rateiy. Passage of major campus
regulations would require en-
dorsement by a majority of both
the student Senate and the facul-

always walking in and out, and
tor another, the lounges are cer-
tainly not centrally located, Also,
a number of them serve as T.v,
rooms which excludes all other
activity. A solution to this lack
at places to talk could be the open-
ing of Gardner lounge to men.

A better solution to this prob-
lem would be having daily open
dorms, There are many pros and
coils concerning this issue which
I would rather not deal with now.
I would only like to try to correct
what seems to me an erroneous
view which thc (aculty and ad-
ministration hold, It is my im-
pression that the faculty and ad-
ministration leel that the students
want extended open dorms purely
for sex. This is not the case! Even
now, with our limited weekly open
dorms many of them are used for
parties of more than two people.
In tact, I would say that most at
them are used in this manner.
Daily open dorms would provide
a place where the students could
go and talk without being dis-
turbed.

The college must recognize that
it cannot lump all of its students
together in one group as “stu-
dents.” If the college provides
Iacillties for those who can study
with noise, then it must also pro-
vide facilities tor those who can't,
If the college provides facilities
for those who enjoy talking ahovo
noise, as in the North Lounge or
the Grill, then it must also provide
facilities for those who enjoy talka
ing in a more relaxed atmosphere.
Even if it doesn’t truly believe
that all the students are “respon.
sible adults," as it says it does, it
must still provide 101' those who
are.

Until the faculty and the admin-
istration lose their seemingly
basic disinterest of the students,
this will never be accomplished.
