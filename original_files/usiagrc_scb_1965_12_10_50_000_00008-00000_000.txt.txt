No Reboumﬁ’ g Weak Offensive
leuo' Fa Two Basketball losses

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneer basketball team,
showing a surprising inetticiency
in their ottense and a riot-sosur-
prising lack of rebounding, suc-
cumbed twice last weekend to
fair teams from Knox and Mon-
mouth. Knox whipped the Pio-
neers Friday, 62-55, and Mon-
mouoh ambushed them Saturday,
3369,

The Pioneers were outrebound—
Ed over the weekend 105-79 and
had a considerable number of
turnovers in their disappointing
openers The Pioneers were also
able to make only forty baskets
compared to seventy for their 01)-
position. Only deadly tree—throw
shooting (44 tor 54, 81 per cent)
kept the Pioneers in the games.

This weekend the Pioneers will
be trying to even their record as
they come back to Darhy to face
Lawrence tonight and Ripon to-
morrow. Lawrence also dropped
two last weekend, but Ripon
picked up two victories to tie tor
the conterence lead. Lawrence lost
to Carleton, 8881, and St, Olaf,
8579, while Ripon was beating
Carleton, 52-83, and St. Olaf, 85-
79.

With high hopes the Pioneers
went against Knox, which was
supposed to be one of the sailor
spols on the schedule. But the Si-
wash quickly jolted the Pioneers
by sprinting out to an early 2210
lead. Alter that the Pioneers were
never able to get closer than sev-
en paints to Knox. The Pioneers
crept to 22.15, but Knox pulled
away to a 3418 lead The hall
ended at 3815.

The Siwash combined a hustling
defense and an oiliense that
worked hard to get good shots to

 

keep the Pioneers at bay all night.

The second ham or the game was
similar to title rirsc as Knox kept
control or the boards and towed
the Pioneers into many bad pass
es. The hoopsters put forth n mild
challenge by drawing within seven
points with eight minutes remain
ing but were never able to get
closer than that

Even after the Knox game, the
Pioneers had high hopes oi get»
ting a split for the weekend. It
looked like they would as they
jumped out to a quick 16-9 lead
against an unorganized Monmouth
team. But the Scots called a time
out and regrouped their forces.
Monmouth then proceeded to reel
oil 14 straight points, many or
them giits because Di poor Pioneer
passes, to lake a me lead. The
Pioneers were only able to pick
up a pair at free throws as the
Scots continued on to build a 31-18
lead. The halI ended at 43-32.

The Pioneers, though, came out

surprise the Scots like they did
at the start of the game. They
looked for a while like they would
succeed In the ilrst three min-
utes the hoopsters reeled oft nine
points to draw within two point:
43-41. The Pioneers were able in
stay close, within tour points, tor
the next ten minutes The deficit
was cur to one point twice, but
the Pioneers never able to get the
clutch basket to take the lead
while the Scots were floundering.

Finally with eight minutes re-
maining, Monmouth broke the
game open huilding up a nine«
point lead. The Pionmrs never
threatened after that.

The leading scorer over the
weekend was Jett Frantz. who
netted 21 points against Knox and
13 against Monmouth, Elliott
Hibbs was next with 10 against
Knox and 13 against Momnouth.
Tom Hill notched 17. against Mon-
mouth to become the only other
Pioneer to score in double ﬁgure

 

oi the locker room with plans to

in either game over the weekend.
