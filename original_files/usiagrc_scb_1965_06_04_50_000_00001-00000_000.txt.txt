Howard Burkle

before more than 1,000 seniors,
parents, alumni, and other
friends of the college.

“Education is a process oc~
curring within a community of
dialogue" Burkle said. “It is
inclusive of all different shades
of opinion, It encourages dis-
sent, it prizes the sort of scepti-
cism which searches for shal-
lowness, provinciality and spe-
cious argumen ."

He continued: “Education is
open to every alternative and,
in a certain sense, continuinglyi
impartial before them. Even
when it has arrived at a con-
clusion, it remains sensitive to
new evidence and is prepared
to open up the case again, The
student, as opposed to the be-
liever, never totally surrenders
himself to his conclusions."
