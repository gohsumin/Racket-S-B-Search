Cricket Crisis Plagues Students
identity Crisis hugs Cricheis

By JOHN GARDNER

"There‘s those two girls in
Loose — you’re not gonna be-
lieve this —— who have about 100
bugs trapped between their win«
(low and screen. .”

“Oh, yes, crickets, Had sever-
al at our lounge party the other
night, they were just getting in
the way of everything. Bad
scene.”

“Well, i know a girl who says
there’s bugs in the Libe, Says
she iinds herseli hugged by
them. .hehrhehﬁY

why is it that everybody
knows somebody who has been
especially bad 0” since the re-
cent cricket invasion on cam-
pus? Or maybe i should say
since our invasion or campus.
The crickets were here first, you
know

I mean, what would you do if
your stamping grounds were all
at once invaded by these huge
people carrying trunks and
things, screaming when they
iound you in their baggage? I!
you were a cricket, would you
go to their parties crawl into
their beer, go to Burling and
scale maids and get trapped in
between windows? And why? All
in the eiiort to be understood by
somebody, anybody. it s a super
identity crisis for cncketsi

All the time, these people ask-
ing why crickets 'don’t stay on
the hearth, just like why women
don't stay in the kitchen or
something. And then when you
do stay on the hearth, like in

Loose lounge, that isn’t too good
either, because preps Zap you
With Homer, and you have to
listen to all their hull anyway
. . .lt’s a hard life. .

Could you really help it if it
was a wet spring and cricket
copulation climbed to a crashing
crescendo? And that you are u
by—product of a copulation ex—
plosion which makes your iden-
tity CI'lSlS all the more imper-
Eonal?

“There is no way to make me
sleep in that bed. What a bum-
mer. Spent all oi last night
swatting these , and the

are crawling under the.
sheets now!”

Mr. Kenneth Christiansen, of
the Bio. department, is an en-
tomologist, and he is probably
closer to the cricket scene than
most people here. Black iield
crickets, he says, don't do much
harm to plants, so iarmers
don't even spray them. We
passed several on the way from
his ofﬁce down to the insect-
rack, or whatever that thing is
in the science department with
oil the bug pinrups.

“Why so many crickets this
year?” I asked

Not an invasion Just, well, a
crashing copulation crescendo.

Sophomore Jake Margolin
says, “The thing with crickets
is that when you step on them,
you get this gooey stuff on your
test which is hard to get on, So,

either abolish crickets or wear
shoes!”

As the incoming crickets of
Grinnell search ior then’ identi-
ties in yet-to-be-tried places
(Dean Low’s house? Saga kite
chens? The concrete or the phy-
sical education complex?), the
cold season approaches. Dark
night of the soul and all that.
You can only be squashed by
humanity so many times. in the
winter. Mr. Christiansen says,
criclreis make for warm, moist
places, like basements and
rooms.

As he told me this, I noticed
him developing a strange tic,
and I wanted to ask him if ho
had a large, moist basement—
but I reirained.

it just wasn’t cricket,

‘ Faculty in Meet. '
Agenda Uncertain

The faculty will meet in their
ﬁrst regular meeting or the year
this coming Monday. A possible
lupic of debate will he student
attendance at the prﬁenily
closed meetings.

A 5-man special committee
has approved a proposal to deal
with the student attendance
question, according to Raymond
Bells, chairman or the group.
“This means very little. it is
up for discussion, amendment,
and ultimately to rejection by
the members of the iaculty,”
Belts said.

Grlniiell will continue to grant
academic credit for Reserve
Oiiicer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses until the Air Force
completes the phasing out-oi

the Grinncll unit on September
1, 1972.

P r e s i d 9 it t Glenn Leggett
announced the decision in a let-
ler sent to all members of the
faculty on June ll His decision
iollowed a discussion or ROTC
accreditation at a icgulatly
scheduled meeting of the board
of trustees the preceding week.

“The effect of this decision
is to permit Gl'innell students
of the classes of 1970, 1971, and
1972 now enrolled or eligible tor
the program (presently 29 stu.
denls, diVided among the three
classes) to take nrnorc
courses for credit in the estab~

.lished sequence until they are

graduated and commissioned,”
Leggett stated. “The 1972 class
will be the iinal commissioned
class at Grinnell, tor on Sep-
tember I, 1972, the AFROTC
unit at Grinnell will be com-
pletely withdrawn irom the
campus."

The president continued:

“It is my own belief, whlcl’i
1 suspect is shared by many
faculty members, that it is
pedagogically unwise to com-
press or tamper with the se-
quence oi ROTC courses so as
to permit sophomores or juniors
to get all or most oi the requir-
ed courses out at the way by
1970 or 1971.

Dr. Leggett reiterated that

the college, in agreement will:
air Force directives, will or
continue the recruiting of so
dents for the Grinneil ROT
program and that no new slut
dents will be enrolled in hJ
program unless they can co
plete the program heiore the
Air Foice withdraws liom canﬁ
pus.

The iaculty on 'April 78
proved by a 47410 vote a row
mendation calling for the co
loge to discontinue the awar
ing of academic credit i1.
ROTC courses on September
1970. 1

Four days later, the Al
Force announced that it wag
discontinuing AFROTC units it}
Grinnell and eight other cob
logos and universities on Sega
[ember l, 1972, because of small
enrollments in the units.

In two subsequent ballots th
iaculty recommended that th
college continue to nwai‘
academic credit for ROT
courses until September 1,197
The Votes were 4734 on MR
19 and 4442 on May 30. ‘i
