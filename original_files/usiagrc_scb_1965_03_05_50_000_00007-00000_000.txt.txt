Union Committee Announces Changes
In Furniture, South Lounge Lighting

Various changes in the lighting
policy of the Forum were made at
last week’s meeting of the ad hoc
union committee, according to
Palmer Hartl, social coordinator.

The lights in the South Lounge
will be dimmed in the evenings, at
10:00 on weeknights and all eve-
ning on Friday and Saturday,
“conducive to quiet conversation
rather than a studyhall atmos-
phere," Hartl said. He said this
was consistent with the policy that
the Forum should be used as a
“recreation hall.”

The lights in the North Lounge,
with the exception of the outside
border, will be tumed off in the
evenings. And the blinking lights
will go, too. Hartl said that the
lights will be “flashed” once at
five minutes before women's hours
each evening.

On the lower level there will be
some changes, too. The committee
affirmed its statement that some
light must be present in the din-
ing rooms when they are in use.
but said that candle light would
be satisfactory.

Food and furniture were also
topics of conversation at the meets
ing. It was explained that the in-
creased prices for doughnuts in
the grill (two for 15 cents) is

necessitated by the upkeep costs
of the iancy grill. It was also an-
nounced that more furniture will
be purchased for the now»darkened
North Lounge.

The ad hoc union committee is
composed of Mrs. Jewell Hawk.
Forum director; Georgia Dentel,
activities counselor; S. Eugene
Thompson, dean of men; Jean M.
Slocum, dean of women; Fred
Huggins, Saga unit manager; Mere
ritt c. Ludwig, vice president of
the college; Steve Buckles, union
committee chairman; Peggy Zieg-
enhagen; Keith King; and Hartl.
The purpose of the committee is
“to review policy decisions on the
new Forum," Hartl said.

Steve (Beaver) Buckles, union
committee chairman. has an
nounced that the committee would
like to encourage the use of the
private dining rooms in the
Forum. He emphasized that the
private dining rooms are open to
groups of students, as well as to
clubs at 25 cents per person. Res-
ervations should be made by Fri-
day of the week preceding the din-
ner with Mrs. Hawk.

The (lining rooms are also availr
able for committee use during the
(layer evening. .Bllckles said.

Antioch College students, headed
by the newly-formed Committee
for Civil Rights Aid, have her-
raged Hattiesburg, Mississippi, of-
ﬁcials with telegrams and lungdis
tance telephone calls requesting
police protection for Antioch stu-
dents working in Hattiesburg for
core (Congress of Federated Or-
ganizations). The telegrams re-
ferred specifically to Antioch
COFO worker Dick Heitler, who
was attacked three times but not
seriously injured. Several of the
telegrams were intercepted and
cancelled after college president
James P. Dixon expressed con-
cern that inflammatory messages
might increase danger to students
in Mississippi.

Antioch College is presently the
target of an organized campaign
to dry us its financial resources.
President Dixon told an assembly
audience. “It is now beginning to
appear that there is a concerted
letter-writing campaign to corpor-
ations saying that ii Antioch is a
recipient of any of their largess,
the letter-writers would turn in

liberoI'Arts Study
For Adult Students

No examinations, no papers to
turn in, no credits or grades.

This is the prospect facing those
attending Grinnell’s second annual
Liberal Arts institute for Adults,
scheduled for Sunday, June 6,
through Saturday, June 12.

Dale B. Terry, registrar and
director of the institute, said the
program has been designed to
provide adult students with a week
of leisurely yet formal study in the
liberal arts.

Terry said four hours of instruc-
tion each day plus special evening
lectures and other activities are
planned. Students will enroll in
two of the four courses offered, and
will be lnstructed by regular mem-
bers of the Grinnell faculty.

Terry said the institute will be
held in the air-conditioned facili-
ties of the college’s Fine Arts Cen-
ter, Hurling Library, and College
Forum.

Courses and instructors are:

“Music in America,” Professor
Denis M. de Coteau (music).

Dangerous Dynamics—The Poli-
tics oi Developing Nations,” pro
fessor James S. Magee (political
science).

“Education for What?" Profes~
sor Reginald D. Archembault (ed-
ucation and philosophy).

“Literature: Characteristics and
Values,” Professor Andrew P. De»
bickl (humanities).

Supplementary evening lectures
will be delivered by Myron M. Lib-
erman (English), Guillermo Men-
doza (biology). and Neal w.
Klausner (philosophy).

A piano recital by Professor
Richard E. Howe (music), will
be presented Sunday night before
classes start.

 

their credit cards," he said. The
college has a serious public rela-
tions problem, Dixon said, “which
is of a nature to threaten the very
things we cherish.” But, he added.
the problem might be created by
the things we cherish.

A Stanford University scandal
over sexual misconduct, triggered
with the publication of a special
student report in the Stanford
Daily, culminated with the resig-
nation of Stanford Dean of Wom-
en Lucille Allen. The report said,
“She (Dean Allen) attributed some
of the problems which occur
among freshmen to salacious ma-
terials they study in Freshman
English and to the erotic ap-
proach adopted by many of the
younger professors . . . They con-
centrate deliberately on the erotic
aspects of literature, in part be-
cause those who are unmarried use
literature as their sexual outlet,
and in part because they wish to
seduce the girls in their classes

 

. . . The professors exercise con-
trol over the girls by virtue of
their grading power; and they can
intimidate a girl who will not com-
ply with their wishes."

Cornell University student:
pirated the Princeton University
newspaper Friday, February 26,
and replaced it with a forgery re—
porting that all-America basket—
ball star Bill Bradley was injured
and would miss the crucial game
against Cornell Saturday. "it was
a pretty good copy," Princetonian
editor John Kretzman Said. “Only
people who know something about
newspapers would detect the dif-
ference.”

Cornell University and the Dis-
trict Attorney of Tompkins Coun-
ty are investigating the use of
marijuana among Comell stu-
dents. University officials do not
yet know how many students are
taking marijuana, but they believe
that some organized narcotics ring
is distributing reefers on campus.
