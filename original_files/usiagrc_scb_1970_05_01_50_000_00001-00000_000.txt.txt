Students Vo+e To Reject
Judicial Council Proposal

By Greg Butcher
Students rejected an amends
merit to the SGA Constitution
concerning the Judicial Council
Article by a narrow margin
Monday noon in the lunch lines. A
positive vote of so per cent was
needed for approval; but out of
512 ballots, 302 (59 per Cent) Voted
in favor, eight short of the
number necessary for approval.
Only 123 students (25 per cent of
those voting) opposed the
proposal, but the 75 abstentions
and seven unmarked ballots
provided the margin of defeat.
The voting followed a KDIC
editorial opposing the amend
rnent and urging the defeat of the
proposal. The editorial attacked
seven aspects of the proposal: (1)
the limit of 20 persons at open
hearings, (2) a section of the bill
of rights which allows entrance
into student rooms, (a) hall
judicial councils remaining
essentially the same as before,
(4) one section which left
defendants open to “double
jeopardy,” (5) the President‘s

veto power over judicial
decisions, (6) one section of the
amendment (had-ll which ape
pears to be contradictory, and t7)
the sloppiness and redundancy of
the entire amendment.

Tuesday night, the Senate,
which had previously approved
the amendment, deleted the
section limiting attendance at
open hearings and voted to
resubmit the proposal to
referendum. A motion to delete
the section allowing double
jeopardy was deieated
unanimously on the grounds that
no parallel could be made be
tween judicial councils and the
U.S. court system and that
therefore the objections were
invalid,

Bill Thomas and Greg Vranicar
defended the amendment against
the other KDIC attacks. Dealing
with the second objection above,
they said that entrance into
student rooms is already college
procedure and that at times it is

Dean’s Office And Senate Committee
Reveal Plans For Residence Halls

Several major changes have
been made in the residence halls
for next year, resulting in a wider
number of options for students,
particularly with respect to co-
ed balls, The changes were made
by the Student Deans office in
cooperation with the Housing
Committee of the Student Senate
in response to the results of a
questionnaire distributed by the
Committee to residents of Loose
and Younker and all other stun
dents except seniors.

Next year, Loose Hall, which
has been co-ed by floors this year,
will be coed by rooms The
rooms will not be exactly alterr
nating, but there will be approxir
mately the same number of men
and women on each floor, spread
throughout the entire iloor,

Cleveland and Langan Halls
will both be made cerd by floor.
Basement and second floor in
Cleveland will be women and
lirst and third men, In Langan,
first and second will be women
and Basement and third men.
These arrangements were made
to keep the number of bed spaces
available and the number of
singles available equal {or both
men and women

In addition to me above
changes, Younker Hall will re
main coeed by wings, and Smith
will become a men’s hall and
Dibble womens,

Mrs, Alice Low, Dean of
Students, told the SKIS that the
changes were made in accord
ance with the belief that “it is
very important to maintain a
variety of living styles on cam

pus." and the questionnaire
circulated by the Student
Housing Committee indicated
that there was a desire for more
Co~ed halls.

Freshmen will be assigned to
all halls on campus; they will be
sent a letter explaining the ale
tcrnatives, and they will have a
chance to indicate their prefer-
enccs.

For returning upperclassmen,
number drawings were held
Thursday night, and room selecr
tions will be made Saturday.

Mrs. Low said that the dormi»
tory arrangement planned for
next year was not planned as a
permanent one, and that she
thinks that ”the 1' ng situation
and use of dormitories should be
evaluated each year."
