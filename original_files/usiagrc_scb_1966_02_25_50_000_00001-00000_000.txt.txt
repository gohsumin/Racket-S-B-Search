Fast Date changed
To Lucrative Meal

The evening meal last originally
scheduled for today has been post-
poned until March 10, according to
Des Moines Project Chairman Bill
Downey.

anney said the reason for
changing the last was to save
SAGA a more expensive meal
and obtain more money from the
fast for the project.

Downey Said he was satisfied
with present rinancial arrange-
ments, but declined to give any
details. He Said SAGA’S Fred Hug-
gins did not want the exact ﬁg-
ures publicized because of possible
changes. Downey added that the
proiect is receiving nearly twice the
original amount SAGA altered for
the fast.

The fast, in which over 700
Grinneii students have pledged to
participate, aroused some contro-
versy because SAGA agreed to
pay only 40 cents per student, con-
siderably less than it was rumored
to have paid tor the Civil Rights
Club iast last year. Apparently
the discrepancy was due to the dif-
ferences in load cost of various
meals.

CoiHP Field Narrowed To Two.
Conduct Pro Disqualifies Paff

By ALAN AXELROD

.The ﬁeld of COMP candidates
was narrowed from three to two
yesterday when Dean Stauss ruled
that Lester Paft is ineligible to
run because he is on conduct pro-
bation. Still bidding for the office
are juniors Bob Fame and Don
Kurasch.

Dean ‘Thompson had originally
given Paif permission to run af-
ter talking with Paris house pres-
ident, Barry Anderson (South
Younker). However, one of the
candidate's questioned Paii‘s elig-
ibility and asked SGA president
Jerry Goddard to investigate the
matter. Since tlle Student Handa
hook explicitly states that a can<
didate tor president of COIHP may
not be on conduct pro. Stauss ruled
that no exceptions should‘be made

the present hall system should be
maintained, he expressed a desire
for allowing greater mobility.

“I believe that some people feel
trapped in the hall that they live
in, but due to a certain stigma at-

are reluctant to change.“ He pro-

proval.

Karen Confesses ‘Siubborn ldeal’ --
Desire for Grinneii Student freedom

"When I was a senior in high
school, Grinneii was writtenrup in
a lot ot newspapers. it was des-
cribed as a school that allowed
the students freedom and treated
them like adults. 1 have a stub-
born ideal—to keep this ideal go-
ing.”

That was how Karen Lauterbach
— AWS B o a r d
president - elect
— described her
motives for run-
ning tor the posi-
tion. She was
elected to that
position Wednes-
day. Deieated
was Kathy Ja-
gow.

With regard to
s e e k in g rule
changes, Mis s
Lauterbach said
that it’s “no: ,
wise to spring a

bach also stress-

ed the importance
of finding out who
will be willing to
work for what
this year.

Many of the
areas of change,
Miss Lauterbach
indicated, will
get settled in
committees, perhaps during the
summer,

The two areas of rule change
in which she is most interested
are common; housing tor sen-
,ior women and .I. program of
graduated lute hours for senior
women, .7: .

Miss Lauterbach is interested in
getting senior women the right to

 

live in apartments. “There are

technical problems or living in
apartments," she said. “but I see
no reason why, it a woman can
find an apartment, she can't live
in it."

Miss Lauterbach also said that:
she thinks oil-campus housing for
women as it is now is “a poor
excuse for privacy." She said
