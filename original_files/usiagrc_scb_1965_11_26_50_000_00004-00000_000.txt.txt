Kunlz Dumns 'Greshamiles'

To the Editor!

I have something to say about
the deoay of the English language,
This past weekend I read about
200 pages of student papers

There is a kind of Gi‘esham's
law of words. Long words drive
out short ones, and with regard
to intellectual coinage. there is a
parallelism to “had money drives
out good money.”

For example, “the Gi-esharriito,"
is i may so call him, says he
“orientates himself in 3 World,"
when there is a simpler, shorter
verb. "to orient oneself." Then he

writes “cl zer," when there is
a word “critic“ And is “analyza-
lion" needed? What’s wrong with
“analysis?"

If a men learned English at 4e,
as did Paul Tillich, then we
should have mercy on his lengths
ened torms such as “resul'recta-
tion" or “salvificntion.” For those
of us who have spoken it in the
nursery and enjoyed the simple
and erteetive speech ol Mother
Goose, the language is lor us to
save. Save it it you can. Damn you
it you can’t.

Projects in Detail

Students involved in summer
chemistry research at Grinnell
discussed their projects Tuesday
night heiore a meeting or the Grin-
nell chapter of the American
Chemical Society.

John Roberts, who is continu-
ing work this semester on a proj-
ect started this summer by Dave
Nehrkorn, explained his Search
for the catalytic site in silica»
alumina compounds, which are
used as catalysts in the petroleum
industry. Working under Joseph
Dantorth. Rubens is trying to syn-
thesize a compound with only one
catalytic site. He is also trying to
prove that the calaIySis are not
necessarily polymers.

In an often to produce a sizeahle
quantity oi nitrogen ylides, John
Watkins spent the summer work.
ing with Jack Swenson on dieye
anocarbine reactions. Watkins ex-
plained that the key to the prob-
lem is in the intermediate steps
of the reactions.

Rick Anderson and John Howie,
who Wurked with William Nevill
and Luther Erickson, talked about.
their research an anticancer com-
pounds. Andcrson explained a syn-
thesis ot a compound that had
never before been prepared, and
lamented the iact that biological
research proved the compound to
be too toxic.

Howie discussed nuclear magnet.
ic resonance spectroscopy of plalh
numramino acid complexes, ex-
plaining his work on determining
the site of camplexing between
metal and base.
