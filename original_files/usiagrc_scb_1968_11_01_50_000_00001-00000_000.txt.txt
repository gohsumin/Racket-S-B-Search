Ordered To Quit

Quad Saga Workers Plan Sa’rurclay S’rrike Dorm by Nov. ll

Student employees of Saga at the Quad are
planning to strike beginning Saturday morning
ll certain demands are not met. In a two-and—one
hall hour meeting on Wednesday afternoon a stue
dent committee presented the students‘ demands
to the administration and to Saga. No sufficient
agreement was reached. The two parties will meet
again Friday afternoon.

on Tuesday the students made the following
three demands: 1. “That all Saga workers receive
at the very least a live cent increment to any
existing base pay alter both the second and ﬁlth
semesters of working tor Saga. 2. That block times
be Split at the discretion of the mealhead (a stu-
dent) among the members oi his crew who sus-
tain an extra load of work should any member or
the crew be signiiicantly late or be absent. a. That
block times be revised immediately to the mutual
Satisfaction of the workers and the management.”

“Block times” refers to one or Saga’s policies.
Each job has been timed and found to take a cer-
tain average amount of time when done satisiac-
torily. it is lor this average amount of time that
a worker is paid when he does a certain job, re-
gardless oi how long it actually takes. According
to Chuck Hand, director of the Food Service, this
helps to maintain a certain level of elllciency.

it is presently Saga’s policy not to pay any ere
tra money to workers who must cover the job or
an absent or late worker. According to Saga Chuck
the meaihead has among his duties making sure

that every job ls covered during a certain shiitr
ii a worker does not appear it is the mealhead's
responsibility to cover the job. His other duties
include filling the milk machine and seeing that
everyone is properly seated However. it two or
more workers tail to appear, Saga does not pay
anyone extra. John Shaw, headwaiter at the Quad
and one of the negotiators for the Students, said
that such absences are “comparatively rare.” One
of the meaiheads at the Quad began splitting
blocks last year without official authorization.

“Neither the College nor Saga would be happy
about a students not being paid tor doing a job,"
stated Ralph Pomerenk, Assistant Business Main
ager of Grinnell College. However, Pomerenk is
presently opposed to changing the policy regard
ing block times, “if you start splitting blocks, you
remove the incentive for the mealheads' having
everyone there," he said.

Would the college save money it a student
had to cover a second job? “I suppose less money
would be paid," stated Pomerenkt

The second major difference concerns the
second and iilth semester increment. Presently
Saga workers are the only ones getting any incre-
ment, live cents alter the second semester. The
present base pay is $1.15 an hour. This wage rate
is standard around campus. Any wage increase ior

At a general housemeeling on
Monday, October 21, Loose Hall
decided to establish a policy or
“self-determination.” It thus be-
came the third dormitory, lol-
lowing the examples of Langan
and Smith, to adopt “home
rule."

Of the 95 men living in Loose
so came to the meeting. The
vote was 44 for sell—deten-nina-
tion, 32 for the present system
of “discretion,” and l for the
continuation of the ofﬁcial pol-
icy of 275 pm on Sunday after-
nouns for open visitation. There
were 12 abstentions.

Following the meeting, floor
meetings were held to establish
rloor policies.

The general housemeeting be-
gan with so minutes of debate.
The debate focused on argu-
ments both for and against
home rule that had been de
veioped in several weeks of dis-
cussion, and in a twrrhour de-
bate which had. been held the
previous week. Opposition to
home rule centered mainly
around the rights or the minor-
ity, alumni sentiment, and the
financial problems that might
arise for the college if the
halls lollowed a policy of self-
determination.

Grant Crandall, ’69, president
of Loose Hall, explained his
idea of how “home rule” would
work. He said that the hall had
decided to allow each ﬂoor to
determine its own policy on the
matter of visiting hours. Ha
stressed that minorities, even
very small ones, shared in the
making of decisions.

Crandall, a firm advocate of
hail sellrdetermination, stated
that he understood that the en4
tire hall would not be prose-
cuted {or the actions of some
of its members.

Sentiment against both the
idea of selirdetermination and
the timing or the declaration
existed alter the meeting was
adjourned. This sentiment im<
mediateiy found its voice in all
open letter, signed by 20 Loose
men, disassocianng the signers
irom the position oi the hall,
Crandall said that most who
signed the letter have now ap.
proved oi the new policy. This
approval came utter Dean 5.
Eugene Thompson said at a
meeting ior student advisers
that no student in the hall would
be prosecuted ior violating the
rules oi the hall unless the stile
dent himsell wanted to take hil
case to the Judicial Council.

Last Wednesday President
Glenn Leggett acted on the Ju-
dicial Council’s "guilty" ver-
dict and sentenced Richard
Schneirov, '70, to conduct pro-
bation and dismissal from his
dormitory or any collegeaowned
residence for the remainder til
the academic year. Schneirov
was given until November 11,
1963 to leave his room.

The president acted one week
after the Judicial Council pre-
sented him with its decision.
The court was deadlocked on
what punishment to prescribe.
The president indicated in his
statement that the court had in-
rormslly asked him to consider
either “no penalty" 0!‘ “conduct
probation" as possible options.

Mr. Leggett said that the case
emphasized “1) the need to
strengthen the procedural meth.
ods and perhaps the organiza«
tion of the Judicial Council, and
2) the need to hasten substan-
tial improvement in the man-
agement of our residence
halls."

in a general statement follow-
ing a statement of the speciiiu
action that would be taken on
the case oi Schneirov, Mr. Leg-
gett noted lour needs oi the
residence halls: “(1) a mode of
living and regulation consistent
with the mental and physical
health of students, one which
will serve the best interests of
the academic program of the
College and so permit students
to work'eriectively as students;
(2) a set or standards for he-
havlor, and enforcement of such
standards, that assure the

Schneirov Case:

By BENSON SMITH

Immediately alter President
Leggett released his decision
concerning the Schnelrov trial,
Richard Schneirov and Bonnie
Tinker met in a room in Bur»
ling basement and prepared a
statement, The statement
charged Leggett with unwilling-
ness and inability to deal with
the fundamental problems of
residential hail iile.

The problems in the residence
system are centered around the
current regulations regarding up-
en dorms. The Student Senate
has referred to the regulation as
unacceptable to the student com-
munity, but has tabled any pro-
posals to change the regulation
until iurthar investigation can
b-mado. .

The Background

At Schneirov’s trial, Lawrence
Frank, chairman of the Judicial
Council, said that the court was
going to review the rule, ior it
the rule was lound to be unjust,
then Schneirov may not have
violated anything. Schneimv ad-
mitted violating the Visitation
rule and said, "The charges are
true but I plead not guilty."
The court subsequently iound
Schneirov guilty or the charge:
as stated but could not agree
on a penalty.

All at the house presldentl
who spoke at the trial said they‘
disagreed with the present rule.

tlon, policies based on discretion
