lists Best Albums Of Tlle Year

(continued from page 1)
beautiful HarrisonrDylan love
song, and Harrison’s gently
whining passages are beauti-
ful, Then, on "Wuh-Wah”(for
Peterson7), Harrison‘s guitar
has the vital driving beat wh—
ich he is so adept atperform~
ing.

There are some surprises on
the album. First of all, Geo‘
rges' lyrics are filled with
optimism and the album is
filled with his love of God
"Forgive me Lord/Please
those years when I ignored
you/Forgive them Lord/Tn
ose that feel they can't af-
ford you." And the song wh-
ich was put on a 45mm is
entitled "My Sweet Lord" is
a rousing gospelrty'pe song,
complete with backrup by the
George O'Hara—Smith Sings
ersl (This is really George
dubbed over and Over about 20
times.) This song sounds am-
azingly like “Oh Happy Day"
and it is impossible to remain
seated when playing it. ”Hear
Me Lord" is another song of
the same type; this is one that
Joe Cocker could really do
well (nor to takeanythingaway
from Harrison). “Wahrvllah”
is a driving song with strong
dissonant chords similar to
"I Want to Tell You" on Re—
volver. ”Apple Scruffs” is
a "tounge-inrcheek” bouncy
son . gharrlson may be spear

king of his fellow Beatles when
he sings, “AppleScruffs/ How
I love you")

There are few faults, if any
on this album. Phil Spector
coeproduced it with Harrison,
however, he has learned his
lesson. Unlike "Let It Be",
he does not overload this air
bum with orchestras filled
with violins and trumpets. Whr
on there is an occasional vio-
lin, it is subtle and fits perr
fectly with the song, suchias
the violin solo in "Isn't It A
Pity". The violins so closely
resemble Harrison's guitar
that it is difficult to tell them
apart.

This album is justin time for
Christmas (or for you New
York City people,,”hanukahl)
And it’s not too "expensive;
it's the perfect gift . . . toask
for! This album,lna sentence,
has to be one of the best a1»
bums in rock history. That's
quite a strong statement, I
realize, but after you hearthe
album a few times you will no
