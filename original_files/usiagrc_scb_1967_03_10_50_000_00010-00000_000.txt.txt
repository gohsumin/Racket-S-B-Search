horn and they wor lore atrald.
The foolish one! had left un-
done thou things which they
ought to have douu and done
these things which they ought
not to have done. And there
was no hope for them. Some
there were in the study room.
These were they who repented
their riotous living, but it
availelh not

Then at the appointed hour
both the foolish and the wlse
arose and walked out as 111th
among wolves, carrying neither
hooks, nor notes, not assign
ments, and they saluted no
faculty member on the way,
Passing through the halls, they
came to the door that opened
to the classroom. Then there
appeared a certain man anion
them called the teacher. An
lifting up his eyes he distribut-
ed the examination papers.

And when he sat down, some
students wrote for one hour,
and others [or two; and many
and varied were the answers
that were written, for some
teaching had fallen on fertile
minds and some on fallow, and
some had fallen flat One wise
man, sitting in the midst of
the students and hearinl that
they murmured, urged they
hasten and write whilst they
had light, that darkness over-
take them not. indeed many
questions were answered but
few were correct,

So shall it be at the end of
the term (or mid-term); leach-
ers shall go out and shall sep»
arate the wise from the fool-
ish and shall cast the foolish
in the same course: next term.
Then the dean shall send Sill-
denls two by two before his
face in every city Ind place
whither they had come saying,
‘60 ye therefore into the high-
way, the college (or univer-
sity) indeed was ready, but the
students were not worth.‘

Then when the students shall
arrive home empty-handed and
unaccredited, there shall be
great tribulation such as not
been round from the beginning
of the world till now.

From this story learn a les-
son; when you shall see all
these things, know ye that the
end of the term is nigh, even
It the doors, AMEN. I Sly to
you, that this month shall not
pass till Iii things he done.
Heaven and earth shall pass,
but some students shall lloi,

But even so, be glad, for

rise themselves, as their new
oundllberalism is a drastic

were in, in high school. The

however, made their underly-

grounds that the President at-
ready had the power to inter
vena. The question still remains
and in all probability its an<
swer will be worked out by the
court itself.

Roger Koenlter’s amendment
centered on the problem of
jurisdiction. According to the
new byrlaws the judicial Court
has “original jurisdiction in all
cases in which Violations of
college regulations are alleged
to have occurred." Koenker was
concerned that a lot at “small"
cases that could easily be han-
dled by hall councils would now
be handled by the court. His
amendment was later withdrawn
because it passed, it would tend
to undermine the authority oi
the judicial court. Koenker’s
point still stands, however. The
jurisdiction of the court extends
to all cases concerning college
regulationsAaveh such cases as
quiet hours violations or minor
damage.

a negative reply by Treasurer

problems for SAGA and the
