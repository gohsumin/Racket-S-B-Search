Photographers taking pictures
of photographers who w e re
filming at photographer who
was taking a picture ot a news-
man virtually disrupted a South
Lounge coffee hour Monday at~
ternoon,

While a student photographer
was snapping a picture oi NBC
space writer Peter S Hackes,
Laverne Hanssen—a town pho<
tographer producing a public
relations film for the college—
set up his movte equipment.

i-lanssen decided to shoot a

iew feet at illm or students _

taking pictures of Hackes—a
typical college scenes

Meanwhile an 3&3 staff pho-
tographer was busy taking pic-
tures of Hanssen and his as-
sistants.

“It reminded me of the ad
where you see a girl looking
into a mirror," coffee hour
speaker Hackes mused after-
,Wards, “Behind her was another
mirror in which the ﬁrst mir-
ror was reflected and on and
on. . . Journalism is an end-
less series or mirrorsr . . "

Moral of the incident, Hackes
agreed: Marshall McLuhan was
right. The medium is the mes‘
sage.

GHAIR BURNS
OUTSIDE QUAD

A discarded cigarette set fire
to a chair and endangered oth-
er items ol furniture stored be
tween James and Haines Halla
about midnight Monday.

Girls irom surrounding halls,
many wearing their niceties,
attempted to put out the small
fire, but were unsuccessful. The
city ilra department responded
to a resident advisor's call and
was able to extinguish the
“blaze" in a. matter of min-
utes,

Furniture from the entire
Quad, recently returned from
summer storage in Des Moines,
was piled along East Street, in
tho alcove between Halnes and
James Most oi the girls had
not yet picked up their items.
in the same alcove were a
number at discarded flamma-
ble packing cartons

An unidentified man walking
along the street ﬂicked a live
cigarette into the chair early in
the evening, Several girls
stamped out the resulting tire,
but it continued to smoulder
until about midnight, when a
heavy cloud of smoke ap-
peared,

Quad residents, including rear
ident advisars, battled the tire
with wastebaskets full at wat-
er. Hall ﬁre extinguishers were
ineffectual due to low pressure.

Haines Resident Advisor Ma<
ry Argenti called the city tire
department, which arrived in a
few minutes and quickly ex-
linguished the ﬁre,

There was no damage in any
items of furniture except the
chair, nor to any buildin
