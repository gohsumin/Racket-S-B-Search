i Describing the small liberal
arts college as “single purpose.
hon-metropolitan, rind resident
ual," Leggett snidi “The three
‘otsntial virtues of the small
h liege are thus its present
roblems. They can be turned
inc real strengths only if some
ard decisions are made about
knalntaining that line between
phange that cannot be resisted
6nd constancy that is crucial

o integrity."

l Leggett outlined such a policy
l" the academic realm by call.
_lng for “a calmer, more oblec<
tive decision-making process
:Mhich preserves the ultimate
,taculty responsibility about edu-
cational policy but allows, in-
:deed welcomes, the pertinent
and useiul educational judg.
merits and perceptions of stus
dents.”

Concluding with a reference
to residentrhall life, Legget‘l
laid, “it is possible to say
many things, to have many

oints of view about this student
l(Debelnun against the in low
parentls lunction or the college,
but whatever the final analysis
may show, we cannot go back
to the time when the limits of
student decisionrmaking were

clearly understood and accept- '

ed by all parts of the campus

community. We have to ﬁnd
the new limits , . ."

Dean Wall echoed several of
the themes of the President’s
speech, but from a markedly
different point of View. Wall,
too, commented on the “special
tensity in the openings of col~
ieges and universities through.
yyt the country,” He said that
'it is as if the nation were pre-
‘aring ior anodier attack upon

t. Sumpter rather than for
that most typical of all autum-
nal scenes in America, the
opening or schools and coin
leges,"

Wail observed the calm that
has marked the nation during
the past summer and said
"there are many who feel that
it only we did not have students
to contend with, we would have
no problems at all.” Wall de-
cried such an attitude, because
"in reality, none of the prob.
lems that brought violence into
the streets have been or have
even begun to be solved."

Explaining the title of his
address, “The Mud Below, The
Sky Above,” the new dean said,
“man is a study in paradox,
every man stands in the mud
and reaches toward the sky.
But it is a little more complex
than that, {or although every
man can see his own bit or sky,
he rarely notices his own lit-
ter. His neighbor's, however,

stinks to high heaven.
“What it seems to me a liber-

at education should be about iS‘

the correction of our sensoly
perceptions. We need to look
obieciively and purposefully at
the mud beneath our own feet,
and at the same time, seek for
some understanding of the
other guy's sky."

Wall touched on the dangers
of extremism, saying, “It is
the absolute certainty of the
extreme right and the extreme
left in their own righteousness

- that make them the antithesis

to'the liberal arts that they
are." Such questions were, in-
deed, the main theme of SGA
President Lew's remarks.

Said Lew: “Our own worst
enemy would be ourselves. We
often have what seem to be
good ideas, yet are unaware or
the consequences that our ac-
tions might have.”

Lew Claimed, “I believe in
logic.” Explaining mat logic,
not altruism is important in the
solution of contemporary prob
lems, Lew added that, “Even
more than logic I believe in
winning."

Pl‘olessar Kleinschmidt sound-
ed the most traditional themes
at the Convocation. He told of
being moved by the resignation
of over twenty [acuity mem-
bars at a Canadian university
because of strident activism,
He pondered the possibility of
such eitects happening here at
Grinnell. Addressing student
activists who would destroy the
college, Kleinschmidt said,
“Buzz oil!"

The taculty chairman re-
peated the theme, “This is not
your college," several times
during his remarks. Referring
to the wider constituency oi' the
college -— alumni, parents, and
{uture students — Kleinschmidt
commented that change must
not be ariccted lmpetuously,
but considered in terms of
“reverence tor the past and
relevance tor the present."

Concluding his address,
Kleinschmidt said, “Sio ’Emi”

 

B. B. King is Scheduled
For Darby Gig Tonight

By PETER KEEPNEWS

The Beale Street Blues Boy
is coming to Grinnell. The old‘
est four-year coeducational lio-
eral arts college west or the
Mississippi has been granted an
audience with the King of the
Blues. in other wordsias if
anyone out there had to be
told ~ B. B. King will be here
tonight.

B. B. King is almost certainly
the most iniluential guitar play-
er around. Twenty years ago
B. B. was playing things on
his guitar Lucille that were to
be picked up on, much later,
by the likes oi Eric Clapton,
Mike Bloomﬁeld, and a Cast of
thousands.

His compositions —liiS most
ianluils is probably “Rock Me,
Babthnve a tendency to be-
come blues classics. His sing-
ing is loi-celiil, emotional,
moving, and he puts on the kind
of show that oiten has Audieiir
ces Jumping up and down and
screaming wuh joy Within a
matter of minutes.

At the Atlantic City Pop Fes-
tival this summer, heroic a

crowd that had been weaned
on rock 'n' roll, King and his
blues drew seven standing ova-
lions.

All [his talent, all this excite-
ment, all this blues will be
happening in Darby Gym
(sometimes known as the Fill—
more Midwest) beginning at
9:30 pm. and going on, most
likely, until B. E. completely
runs out oi energy. He is that
dedicated a perlorrner. Even
through the years and years or
one-nightstands, he has pro-
bably never given a perform<
ance that was less than sensa-
tional. He loves to play and sing
the blues. His audiences, of
Course, love to listen.

B. B. King is at the height
of his popularity, revered the
world over, and now, thanks to
the planning and persistance or
Gal-y Giddlns, Lee Shamberg,
and Miss Georgia Dentei, who
have worked tor over a year
Io get him tor a concert, he
will be periormiug right here at
little Old Grinneli College. Don't
miss it. You owe it to your
Soul [0 be there.

Gifts to College

Despite last year’s wide-
spread fear that sensational
publicity about Grinneli would
discourage wealthy donors from
making contributions, unre.
stricted gills to the college
amounted to more than in any
comparable previous year.

Unrestricted gitts to the col-
lege from all sources during the
10 months ending last June 30
totalled $660,790, a 51 per cent
increase over the 11-month ﬁs-
cal year of 1967-68.

“Why there was an increase
is a question on which anybody
could have an opinion,” Pres
ldent Glenn Leggett said last
week. "Certainly the Develop
ment Oiiice ought to get some
credit for it."

“it could be that at a time
when colleges are in linancial
trouble donors and friends are
responding," Leggett added.

Donald Lambie, Vice Pres-
ident and Treasurer of the col-
lege, attributes the increase to
the Academic improvement
Masterplan, the ”AIM
Program” under which the
Development Oiiice is soliciting
donations.

“We're in a major campaign
that has put more concentration
on alumni responsibility to the
college than in normal years.”
La‘lnble explained. "It would
have been disappointing ii there
hadn't been such a response.”

Both Leggett and Lambie be
lieve that the sensational
publicity surrounding the
Playboy protest resulted in
some loss or potential donors
to the college. “We had several
speCliiC instances oi individuals
withdrawing pledges," Lamuie
commented.

College lunds stem irom three
major sources—student rees,
endowments, and gitts, Gilts
are given mainly by trustees,
alumni, corporations and busi<
nesses, and religious denomin-
utions.

Both the president and vice
president expressed pessimism
about the financial Outlook for
the college this year. “We
aren't going to be as well on -
as we were a year ago," pre-
dlcted Lamblev

increase 51%

i .
"The inflationary trend oi the '

economy is causing all ou «
costs to increase,” he points
out. “The declining stock mar}

. i r
ket will be very detrimental to 37%;“

the college, since donorsoiten
give securities.
”And a. downtrend in ih

_,.
market is still a depressan ﬂ."

even it donors are considerin
monetary gins," he continued,‘
“Good business conditions ilk.
duce a spirit to ive."

Lamhle also said that tax res l-
forms pending

about giving money to educoil

such gifts will be tax deduelr'
able. ‘
