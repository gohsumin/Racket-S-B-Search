teams, and their lack of prac-
tice was obvious.

Coach Gene Kowel‘t Started

went one and a halt innings,
giving up tour runs (only one
of them earned). Dave Schatz
took over the pitching duties,
and had three runs (none
earned) scored against hlm in
two and a half inningsr Bob
Geller pitched two scoreless in«
nlngs but was replaced by Dick
Schneider in the seventh.
Schneider let in two, and was

replaced by Lee Arherman in

hits and errors brought seven
more runs across for the Penn-
men.

Grinnell’s scoring came in
the fifth and seventh innings.
In the fifth, Dave Luthy singled
to right, Ron Gatton grounded
out, and Greg Dean and Boh‘
Geller walked, filling the bases.
Schneider hit into what would
have been a double play, but
the throw to first after the force

enth, a walk and two errors
brought Geller across.

The batsmen take on C0.

and that‘s why we’re part of it. That's why we’re putting
