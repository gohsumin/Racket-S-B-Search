CAMPUS INQUIRER—J
Students offer varied opinions or
question regarding womenls hours

Question: What is your
opinion or women’s
hours regulations? Do
you think they should
bc altered?

Greg Strawn: “Yes. There
shouldn’t be any hours rules.
But since we Can’t have a 110-
hours system, they should at
least be extended on weekends."

Donna Cunningham: “I think
they should be more ﬂexible,

Its silly to be campused it
you‘re one minute late.”

Gretchen Geycr: “I think hours
are unnecessary. i think the
college would ﬁnd that the stu-
dents would establish their own
hours."

Gar Srnith: “1 like the way
they are now. They're liberal
enough. If they (the administra-
tion) would liberalize the car
rules then 11 or 11:30 am on
Friday and Saturday nights
would be good."

Barbara Schwonk: “I think
they‘re a tradition that could
be done away with. ii Grin-
nell is getting the responsible
people they say they’re getting
then they should iccl free to
give thom the responsibility
they deserve.” -

John Karlsson: “I don't think

they could be improved much.
or course it would be nice If
there were no hours at all, but
its a hopeless causc."

the South African government
intend to withdraw trom the
B tish Commonwealth? 2) How
was the dccision to withdraw
made? 3) what are the political
and constitutional implications
both in South Airican and Com—
monwealth affairs?

Bctorc discussing the questions,
Ballingcr gave a histoiical back-
g1ound to the problem. He
pointed out that South Airica

Airikancr Nationalism

Thc asccndcncy or the All‘l-
kaner can be seen in the tact
that every question in cvcry
hold or government action “has
been solved along the lines at
Al'rikaner Nationalism." Ballin»
ger traced the dcvclopmcnt of
the Nationalist party irom its
beginmngs with Hcrtzog, through
its ascendency in 1924. to its den
clinc just before the Second

Davydd Greenwood: "Under

tance. The problem or the worm

or the necessity for a complete

platiorm had
three planks: 1) Leave Atri-
kaners to develop their own
culture, 2) Make South Airica

11 republic, 3) Complete sov-
creignty.

With power, Hertzog became
more conservative, but the war
and the oucsuon of South Alri-
ca's nontrnhty again brought
the qucstion oi complete sot-c1»
cignty to the fore. During the
\val‘, General Smuts led the
country in lighting on the Allied
Side. However, after the war the
Nationahst party 1osc again
uith a campaign for a republic.

Having proclaimed itself a
icpublic South Airica sent a
delegate to the Commonwcaith
ministei s contcrcncc with an air
plication for admittance lo the
Commonwealth as a republic.
Balliligel‘ contends that South
Africa tclt ties with the Come
monwealtli werc tavorablc to
her. She‘ did not rccl that her
sovereignty was lessciicd by be-
ing a member of the Common-
wealth, particularly attcr the
proclamation had been made
that “all member states of the
Commonwealth were tree and
equal."

The question, then, is what
caused her to change her mind
at the coniercnce? Ballinger
stated that while the confer-
ence discussions started anod-
cratciy, there were ministers
present determined to see the
expulsion of South Africa rrom
the Commonwealth because oi
her internal racial policies.
”Probably the most important

o/a ted, according to Ballinger

hroccdural decision oi the con.
lerence was the decision to
discuss the admission of Sour-.1
Afr-lea to. the Commonwealt'i
and her racial policies at the
same time."

As the discussion proceeded a
iormula appeared, If South A

ministcrs would consider h
