The first two weeks of basketball have now been completed

and everybody has lept into the race with all the fervor and ex-
citement that one has come to expect from LM. basketball. Cowles,
after splitting with Gates. lost two games to Rawson. Rawson,
now tied with Smith for first place in the Treusdale race, is burst-
ing with enthusiasm. They met wth a large setback, however. when
the LM. board refused to sanction Dance I. M.’s as a legitimate
North Campus sport. Langan suffered an even greater loss when
Dave Luthy was lost for the season while performing for the
Golden Horde against the ti-eshman team. Langan promptly went
out and dropped two to Dibble. East pulled the big upset or the
year, so far, when they beat the Smith “A” team. The Gates ”A"
team (which was stacked) gave up only nine points to North in
the first half and was still behind. This pretty much typifies the
year Gates is going to have (Wait ’til paddle tennis). Nothing has
been decided, though, so I'm sure my progress reports will be
awaited with eager anticipation (yawnrgaper

Rich Wickstrom has dominated the college bowling league for
the last two weeks by averaging 200 for the last six games. Tho
team captained by yours truly (subtle plug) has leaped into first
place, however, with a N mark. High point of last week's keg-
ling was Mary Kay Earl trying to get a quarter out of a pocket in
her stretch pants. The old bowling league just ain‘t what it used
to be (chucklechuckle).

SCHAFFER'S ICEMEN COMETH

By JEFF SCHECKTER

Goals by Graham, Crandall,
and Jackson gave the Grinnell
Blades a 3-1 victory over Des
Moines at the Des Moines ice
Arena Sunday.

Grinnell dominated play in a
game of excessive roughness.
Des Moines was hindered by
eight penalties, tripping, rough-
ing, crosschecking, and board-
ing, which meant that they had
to play short a man tor a total
oi 16 minutes.

Although a few Blades were
intimidated to fight by an elbow
in the mouth and by a stick
across the back of the head,
it o t h i n g developed, enabling
Grinnell to avoid penalties, and
to play the entire game at full
strength.

Grinnell’s ﬁrst line of Gra-
ham, .l ackson, and Millikin
scored in the first 44 seconds
of the contest. Grinnell con-
trolled the face-off, shooting the
puck into the offensive zone.

Jackson dug the puck out of
the right corner and fed a well-
placed pass to Graham sta<
tioned in front of the Des Moines
net. Graham then beat the goalie
on a quick eight foot shot to
give Grinnell a lo lead.

The second line of Crandall,
Schaffer and Allen upped the
score 270 two minutes later.
Detenseman Joe La Moths
passed to his partner on the
blue line. Steve Gausebeck, who
fired a 60 foot shot. Crandall,
positioned in front of the net,
t o o k Gausebeck's s h u t and
slipped the puck past the Des
Moines goalie iot‘ the 2—D ad-
vantage.

The iirst period ended 2-1 af-
ter Des Moines scored from a
distance of 25 feet on a screened
shot.

Half way into the second
period, Grinnell earned its third
goal. Bruce Graham fished the
puck out lrorn behind the Des
Moines net and passed to Tom
Jackson, standing just outside
the crease. Jackson forced the
puck off the Des Moines goal<
ie's skate into the net.

A combination of good defense,
backchecking. and goal tending
shut out Des Moines during the
second and third periods.

CJEQCJEDCJE‘D

By J. VON ERIESEN RAZ

The chess master combines a unique set of talents, personality
traits, and abstract abilities, which he fashions into a highly dif-
ferentiated system of thinking and playing methods.

initially, he is dealing in a subject matter composed of schee
matic spatial (two- dimensional) possibilities for movement.
To the chess board he brings two capacities which are relatively
discriminating: a high nun-verbal intelligence and a powerful
memory capacity. The high nonverbal intelligence is furthermore
manifested in two forms: a spatial memory and a constructive
spatial imagination. The distinction made here is that the complex
abstract images with which the player works can hardly be con-
sidered either tactile or visual. By analogy, the chess master is to
visual images as the speed reader is to pronouncing each word.

The powerful memory capacity can probably be better under-
stood when it is seen that it enables the master to learn progres<
sively by experience, to refine his operating rules constantly by
means of the mental operations of abstraction and generalization
It a high rate.

The above generalizations are commonly understood by those
who have had relatively little or no experience with the game.
There is, however, another facility possessed by the chess master
which is often overlooked and warrants our attention.

The pendant oi generating hypotheses is testing them. For ex.
ample, over the board the choice of a good move rests largely on
foreseen possibilties for action and on the evaluation of foreseen
results. The thought process is essentially an emperical investiga-
tion — there is no a priori or deductive way to establish with cer<
tainty how much can be attained or how much can be proved (at
this point the problem of chess is strikingly different from that of a
mathematics problem). It is an investigation which terminates in a
decision necessarily based upon incomplete evidence, and neces-
sarily directed towards quantative results.
