Editorial . . .
The Election

In an interview, newly elected C of HP Presi-
dent Lee Maril said he wanted to make the position
as important as the AWS Board head. Only 20%
of the male students voted and he received only
11% of the votes.

This hardly represents a mandate, and he may
find difficulties in achieving his aim. Two conclu-
sions may be drawn, The students failed to partici-
pate in their own governmental system, and, as a
result, Maril will be forced, whether he wants to or
not, into representing his own views rather than
those of the electorate

A Good Change

Although it is said that the proper place of
women is with men, in the past at Grinnell men and
women have been separated. The women, through
the shyness which befits the gentle sex, except on
rare occasions, chose to stay on South Campus. The
men usually preferred to remain in masculine com-
pany on North Campus. In a society in which men
and women are intellectually equal, it is only civ-
ilized for them to be in the company of one another.

The nature of things dictates that women will
have a taming influence upon men. The proximity
of women surely will help to remove some of the
jungle conditions that used to exist in the boys’
dormitories and Cowles dining room.

A Fine Action . . .

Last year one or two students saw an oppor-
tunity for a new course to be offered in the Depart-
ment of Philosophy and Religion, the course in
ethics. Working tediously with the faculty and ad-
ministration, and despite abundant bureaucratic
obstacles, they developed the curriculum of a course
which is currently being taught.

The Scarlet and Black commends this action,
which represents student responsibility in its most
thoughtful and effective form, and it is a sign that
genuine change in the structure of the college is
possible when serious effort is made.

The Community Bicycles

Last year, through the efforts of the David M.
Gibson Memorial Newsletter and some other efforts,
eight bicycles were purchased to be used as com-
munity bicycles. These bicycles, which were to be
markedly distinguished, would be ridden by any
student who happened upon one. The rule was that
the bicycles should be left on campus. Before the
painting of the bicycles, however, two of them per-
manently disappeared. When the remaining six
were placed on campus, they were often misused,
thrown around, left in town, and sometimes taken
for private use.

It was a noble experiment, one depending on
the essential goodness of human nature. Perhaps
because of Adam’s fall, perhaps because of ignor-
ance of the proper way to treat bicycles, the venture
failed. The bicycles remain now by Loose Hall un-
used, broken. and chained.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Collogrophs
Depress Critic

By Mllvn ANDERSON
Ari Major

Reaction to the Glen Alpl
Coiiographs now on exhibit in
Scheaffer Gallery has been un-
fierstandably weak. The works,
which date from 1958 to 1961,
are not the only, nor the best,
representatives of the colic-
graph technique. They are, at
best, explorations into a "new”
printing technique and the
forms suggested by it to the art-
ist’s imagination.

Use of collage and intagiio
in the printing process has pro-
duced a striking range of tex-
tures. Textures and values alone
create form and depth.

Most of Alps‘ works, however,
do not explore depth, and in
many the form is ﬂat and
tricky.

The parts, or pieces, of the
patterns are intriguing, but the
overall effect is unmoving. Con-
scious awareness of materials
and design displaces total aes-
thetic experience, This aware-
ness, in a truly great work, is
analytical and only subsequent
to experience. ln other words,
creative design should evoke an
aesthetic emotion which is
greater than the sum of its
parts.

Alps has come closest to
achieving this in his more or-
ganic and expressionistic works
where an intense linear vitality
creates movement and mood.
in these works depth is most
effectively rendered; the black
ls a distant. haunting shadow;
in the foreground, aggressive,
menacing white forms move.

“Where Th Truth Lles

By DONALD STUMP

The first issue of Pterodactyl
contains s large dose of obscene
words and, to state the case as
fairly as i can, tasteless car-
toons. One drawing depicts pigs
in police helmets preparing to
eat their own excrement and
another shows cops in the act

of raping personifications of
Liberty and Justice.

1 would not bother to hrlng
up the vulgarities, except that
to include such pictures has be-
came a deliberate policy of the
paper; and the policy seems to
be at odds with the express
purpose of the staff to win peo-
ple over to a “radical alterna-
tivai’. The obscenity is apparent«
1y 8 part of that alternative,
and I Wonder why.

It seems to me that to per<
suade people to climb out on a
radical political limb the best
strategy would be to humor the
peoples' sensibilities and avoid
estranging them needlessly. It
is foolish to become involved in
quibbiing over dirty cartoons
during a serious revolution. One
might argue that the sort of
"working classes” the Hero-
dactyi is seeking to attract will
be drawn to such stuff; but
from my own observation many
blue-collar Workers are likely
to be conservative and puritani-
cal in their tastes, and I do not
think the radicals would be
wise to chance offending them
(in ii mere whim.

Now it is an entirely defensi-
ble position that the staff of
the “underground" newspaper
is not wise, that the cartoons
are indeed a whim, and that a
tactical blunder has been mader
But I prefer to give more credit
for cleverness than the editor:
perhaps deserve, for if is better

to overestimate men’s power»
than to underestimate them.

in his article entitled “The
Movement at Grinneil”, Richard
Schnairov explains the failure
of the Grinneil Student Move-
ment in the following way:

“The real issue was and still
is which side will the students
and faculty take. Will they line
up with the oppressed and ex-
ploited people in the country
and around the world or will
they line up with the oppressors
. . . We in the movement com-
pletely failed to pose the real
problem. We failed to polariza
the alfernau‘ves."

It is apparently true that on.
is either with the Movement or
against it. (My revolution, right
or wrong.) And one of the or-
deals of catching up with the
Movement seems to be an ac-
ceptance of the propriety of hav-
ing vulgar cartoons in its news-
paper. If one puts oneself on
the side of Mr. Schnoirov et. al.,
how can he avoid seeming to
approve of the tone of the
Plarodactyi? is he not involved
in an act of complicity in the
vulgarness?

Of course, any polarization of
alternatives forties people to
ignore distinctions and sacrifice
their reason for a particular
dogma; and perhaps in an ef-
fective revolution people must
give up their right to make in-
dividuai judgments about the
proper course of action and be-
come parts in the great liber-
ating machine. But do they havs
to make even such things as
taste, which have nothing to do
with the revolution per so, part
of their political commitment?

Is there here a faint scent of
the totalitarian tendency to con-
sider even the smallest detail:

’1 It Was. Just A Beautiful Thing”

About 40 people Attended the Saturday "wedding" of Paul Jones and Janet Thomas on the lawn
of Conference House. “They felt their rnnr—rylng each other encompassed all of the friends of
each individual,“ says a friend who attended. The two exchanged rings, and performed a wed-
ding dance, in n ceremony they found more no eanlngfiu than their earlier one. Their friends
shared a wedding feast of wine, bread and cheek, Ind sat on the grass in the autumn sun.
