Koenig Finds Academia Helpful

iSts mostly in the minds of
both parties, Koenig said, and
exchanges between the departr
ment and the universities (an
be helpful.

As one step toward bridge
ing the gap, the State Depart»
ment is giving its foreign
service officers leaves of ab-
sence to study and work at
a university, usually with the
political science department.
Here, Koenig said, the diploe
mat has time to think and ex-
change ideas with Others who
often have a different perspct
tive.

One such Diplomatrin-Res-
idence was john Guthrie,prer
sently the number two man
in the Embassy in Sweden,
who was at Grinnell for the
last academic year. Koenig
said that he had heard from
Guthrie, and that he consider-
ed his experiences at Grinr
nell among the richest he has
had. The only problem he saw,
Guthrie told Koenig, was how
to apply what he had learned
at Grinnell at his desk in
Stockholm.

The exchange between the
State Department and the unr
iversities works both ways;
there is also a program for
academics in residence at the

State Department. The aca-
demic who spends eight morr
ths working at the State De
partment might easily conw
elude, as one Pomona pro-
fessor quoted by Koenig, that
the entire atmosphere was
different.

Defense and Deadlines

At the university, the Pom-
ona professor said, work is
directed towards the writing
of a paper as an end. /\t the
State Department, however,
it is only a beginning: the
paper must be defended to all
sorts of experts and com-
mittees, and strict dead

lines are in force throghout Men,

the decision- making process.

These deadlines,Koenigpro-
posed, constitute one of the
most important reasons for
the perhaps irreconcible gap
between the Department of
State and the academic com-
munity. At State, deadlines
are opposed by events, and
quick policy making is im-
perative. The foreign ser
vice officer, who must make
a decision and take respon-
sibility for it, man not take
the time to think it through
as the academian can.

The professor, Koenig said,
is free to say what he thinks,
and he has plenty of time for
contemplation. The diplomat,
on the Other hand, must be
more careful and more spr
eedy in his thoughts and ac
tions, for he must. make 3

decision which will have dire

That gap, then, between the
academic community and the
State Department, is very
much one of time, according
to Koenig. 01 a larger scale,
it is the gap between theory
and application.

Theory and application must
live together Keonig concluded
--the saying that “diplomacy
without policy is aimless; pol-
icy without diplomacy is use-
less' still holds true, he
snide—but they are not by any
means totally reconcillable.

5 Group To Form;
Will Examine Roles

if you are a man who is Gone
cerned about the various sorts
of roles that oursociety trains
you for (ie, father, breadwin‘
nor, rational, unemotional,
sexual agressor, oppressor
of women) and intereSted in
examining these roles and loo-
king for alternatives; and if
you are interested in commur
nicating with other men in an
honest way (ie, no ego games),
please come to ame tiiigSun-
day afternoon at 200 in the
South Lounge. Hopefully an
organization ofsorts can come
out of this meeting, not based
on any existing model (like
Women’s Lib) but creating its
own form to try to relate to
as broad a segment of Grin-
nell males as possible. That’s
Sunday, 2:00 in the South

but you can feed them all of
the time". One word could be
used to sum up the descrip
tions of the food that was dis-
cussed: BAD. The third, {curt
th, and fifth innings saw the
Students bring up complaint
after complaint while the SGA
president tried not to laugh
and Dean Walker felt lucky to
be an administrator for the
first time in his life. TheSAGA
brass restricted their strat-
egy to writing down the com,
plaints and asking questions.

("Is it bigger than a bread
box?"). SAGA finally get on
base by getting a compliment
on the salad bar and a testi-
monial that they now put ore
ange juice into the water.

The sixth and seventh inn-
ings were devoted to mean
line drives over the high g1"
ease content of the food, and
fancy fielding by SAGA. ”Yes,
i would say that there isa dif
ference between frying and
deep-frying". Even the let:
tuce looked green when SAGA
scored their first run on the
compliment, "your brocoli
last Thursday was memorab»
ly good"; however, the Slud’
ents then scored quickly on the
bad coffee and the breaded
veal.

The remaining innings were
lackluster. With most of the
students off the field, the BIG
STARCH MACHINE still
managed to have four more
runs scored against them, by
them.

And so the students won,

right? Wrong. What the play
ers had not realized was that
SAGA owns the ballpark, runs
the league, hires the umpires
and kept the scoring sheets.
So we may never know the
score, because the last time
that i saw the scoring sheet,
it was being coveredwlthpare

. Bureau To Provide
Speakers For Town

The College Relations Come
mittee plans to set up a Spear
kers Bureau for various town
organizations, modeled on the
Des Moines student speakers
bureau this summer in res-
ponse to the campus activism
of last spring.

The Committee feels thatthe
expertise of members of the
college community should be
made available to towns-
people. The opportunity for
sharing college resources al-
ready exists in regular civic
group, church, and service
club meetings appropriate for
topical presentations of gen-
eral or specific interest. The
Committee hopes that through
the establishment of this Sp-
eakers Bureau the current die
vision between college and
town activities can be bridged
and broader community con-
cern can develop.

Any persons who wish to of-
fer their services should con-
tact Mario Bognanno or Care
olyn Canfield for further in-
formation.

times just the knowledge that

can be helpful.

The center is set upasanonr

college can't be held respont
sible for any of its actions.

 

The administration has given
its sanction through financial
assistance. Being independent
from the rest of the college,
the center is not bound togive
any information on particular
students to theadministration.
An informal agreement has
also been reached with the po-
lice; Chief Peters agreed to
analyze or dispose of any
drugs given to him with no
questions asked. Dr. Daniels
has agreed to be a consultant
and attempts are being made
to obtain a local doctor for
consultation. .

case. An organized group from
the town which is concerned
about drugs has been meeting
with the center's staffwith the
hope of setting up their own
center. While no one seeking
help would be turned away,
campus acceptance will have
to be present before the center
is officially opened to the town.

In addition to the counseling
services, the center hopes to
establish an up-to»date refer
ence library on drugs, emo-
tional problems and counselr
ing techniques, and to bring
some exploratory programs to
the campus, utilizing small
group techniques.

The center will be open in
about 4 weeks. Located in
Mears basement, it will be
open Monday through Friday,
4 p.m. to 8 a.m., and 24hours
on Saturday and Sunday. Pr~
ior to its opening, represent—
atives will bring the center’s
policy statement and operat-
ing procedures to floor and
hall meetings and explain the
actual activities.
