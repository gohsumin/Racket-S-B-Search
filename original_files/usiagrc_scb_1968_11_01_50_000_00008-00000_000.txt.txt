PIONEERS EDGE BELOIT;l GRAY MATTER l .
SCOTS SMASH US 50-0

By REGGIE GRAHAM

In an effort to please parents
and alumni. the Pioneers won
their second game of the sea-
son by beating Beloit, 2422. In
case you didn't realize that this
was an upset. the Chicago Trib-
une had Beloit picked 19-6, and
I can't remember another Grin-
nell game the Tribune missed!

Grinnell made one touchdown
per quarter for the first three,
with Johnson's passes adding
two points each time .lon Bus-
well scored twice, once from
thirty-three yards out. Jon
played a fantastic game. carry-
lng the ball seventeen times and
gaining five first downs. Rumor
has it that Steve hutchings
made twenty tackles; he and
Tom Lower played excellent
games at the linebacker spots,
Steve was in on the tackle that
stopped Knox halfback Burch
on the six inch line in their two
point conversion bid (it would
have tied the game)r Alex Kar-
lln and Bob Lillis did well on
the defensive line — Alex’s per.
formance was topped by his re<
ccvery of a Beloit fumble on
our 28, stopping a thirty-eight
yard drive.

Beloit's Young (HR) was our
main headache that day. Alone.
except for one seven yard carry
by Gross, he ran ten straight

downs. driving a total of forty-
ono yards. setting up Beloit'o
first touchdown. During their
second touchdown drive, he
carried the ball seven out of
eleven times gaining 35 of the
53 yards. Beloit made its third
touchdown on a had interfer-
ence call and a trapped ball in
the end zone.

The Pioneers played their
best game of the season against
Beloit. We were aided by some
lucky breaks. such as fumbled
and well timed penalties. We
lost no fumbles and had no
passes intercepted. The defense
played a very good game; and
pass defense was great The
best defensive action of the
game was our ability late in
the second quarter to hold
Beloit for four downs on our 27.

Monmouth’s Homecoming

The game last Saturday
against Monmouth wasn’t nearly
as cheerful for Pioneer fans.
Badly outweighed, the Pioneer
defense was able to hold amaz«
ingly well for the iirst ten min-
utes of the game. Monmouth
couldn't make any yards on the
ground, and got no first downs
(we made three). Late in the
first quarter, however, a long
bomb set them up for their first
touchdown They scored only
one touchdown per quarter for
the iirst three quarters. In the

last quarter. however, Moli-
mouth's first string was able to
run up twenty-seven points after
Coach Bowers took out our
starters.

Monmouth's main scorers
were Schneider, who caught
three touchdown passes from
quarterback Tom Lombardo,
and halfback Coole, who ran two
touchdowns (as well as gaining
another 191 yards). Their kick-
Br, Phil Motzer, kicked five
points afterwards, and one field
goal from the forty-two in the
second quarter.

As far as total yards gained,
the Pioneers looked pretty had.
We managed to make a total of
only 152 yards compared to
their 493. We lost three fumble:
and had one pass intercepted.
but luckily were able to punt
eight times. Grinnell was
up against a team that wall
picked to have a shot at the
number one spot in tha confer.
once. and was just badly out<
played.

This week we play Lawrence,
and although they usually have
a tough team, they are not that
strong this year. The teams will
be up for the game, but with
the quality we showed against
Beloit. plus the same fine
nerve, we might take another
one.

Come see, Saturday 1:30,

Grinneli undoubtedly heard
about the Meilman episode a:
it happened. I learned of this
piece of crowning folly when T
read the wireeservlce story that
the Toronto Daily Star picked
up.

Perhaps his action was de-
signed to test the new Fair Em-
ployment legislation, No men

my understanding of the under

that Mr. Mellman chortled over
his victory with his barber.
“The college spends all this
money on public relations." he
is reported to have said, “but
look how I got into papers all
over the country for $14.00" (the
reported cost of his campaign).

if one can trust 7118 accounts,
the administration’s handling of
the situation was somewhat in-
ept -— or at least lacking in
imagination, Mailman could
have simply been disqualified
on a technicality: a queen is a
woman. and Mr. Mellman is
not. presumably. . . .

One more comment on this
issue seems relevant, from a
distinguished former Grinnell
student, It is from tho noted
west coast student of folklore
and pioneer ethnologist. David

In a lighter vein. on Wednes<

as the bays tried to adjust to
the more feminine rules of field
etiquette. Marty Right Wing
banged one in for the boys in

which closed with the girl:
scoreless. and I little embar-

an advantage in speed and

screaming defense headed by

were scored. The first was I

the second was a penalty bully

KNOX REMATCH UP
FOR SOCCER CLUB

The Grinneli Pioneers will trad
val to Knox tomorrow to face
the Siwash in our final soccer
match of the season. The game
is a rematch of an earlier meet-
ing this season. in which Knox
scored a 3-2 victory.

Coach J o h n Hemingway
thinks that his Pioneers. who
currently have a 3—2 record, will
be up for this game. A victory
would even the score with Knox
for this season and give Grinnell
one of its best records in recent
years.

Harvey Nagpur. the Slwash
leit wing, is expected to be the
biggest threat to tho Pioneers.
According to Coach Hemings
way, he has figured in each of
Knox’s most recent victories
over Grinneli. Says Heming-
way, in commenting on Nagpur,
"He beat us last year and ill
beat us again this year." But
the Pioneers have been drilling
hard and should be ready thil
time.
