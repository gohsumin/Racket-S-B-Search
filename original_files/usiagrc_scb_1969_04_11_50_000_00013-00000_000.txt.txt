Season Wrap-up

Poo Record by Is suit

The heavy burden or iorieit

dual wrestling record, this] sta-
[isthS reveal.

Coach conney Kimbo’s Pio-
neers outscored 16 dual foes
222-206 on the mat, but were
assessed with 205 iorieit points,
The Pioneers had only seven
matmen much or the campaign,
and gave up as many as 25
free points in some engage—
ments,

The team leader was senior
Don Kraitsik who took second
place in the 177-pound class at
the Midwest Conference meet
despite being hampered by an
extremely painful boil. Krait—
sik, who also saw action at 191
and heavyweight during the
campaign, ﬁnished the year
with a 12-4—0 record and
wrapped up his three-year var-
sity career with a 31-130 mark.

at the loop meet as Grinnell
came in sixth. Sophomore Ted
Glick was third at 160 and jun--
lor Mason Klippel was fourth at

year and Klippel had a 7.7»2

Rollins Spirits
Swimmers

A record breaking spree by
sprinter Bruce Rollins high-
lighted Grinnell College’s 1968-
69 swimming season.

The six-toot, seven-inch
sophomore set records in four
ireesiyle events — 5o-yai-d
(22.5), ell-yard (28.0), loo-yard
(50-1), and ZOO-yard (1:533) —
as the Pioneers posted a s3
dual meet record, Won the Grin-
nell Relays, and placed iif'h at
the Midwest Conference meet.

Three other Pioneers wrote
new entries in the Grinnell rec-
ord bookr

Sophomore Dan Meyer set a
new 2113.7 mark in the ZOO-yard
individual medley, He also
fashioned a 1:4 4 standard in
the lanyard individual medley,
only to have freshman Steve
Ward better it with 3 1241.0 ei-
iort later in the campaign. Jun-
ior John McBlain lowered his
own mark in the soeyard tree-
style with a 5:251 clocking.

New school standards were
also set in the iooyard medley
relay and the iooyard ireestyle
relay. Varsity swimmers wu-
liams, Meyer, Dale, and Rol~
lins posted a 3:567 mark in
the medley event while an all-
freshman unit or Ward, Carns,
Wallis, and Daley fashioned a
3:216 entry in the record book.

and Cornell.

Nelmen Optimistic

A "beefed up” Pioneer tennls
team will face conference foes
Lawrence and Ripon, today and
tomorrow, respectively, as they
strive to improve their 1-1 sea-
son record

The team, bolstered by the
arrival or four sophs to the
varsity ranks, dropped their
opener to Luther, 7.2, and
downed Monmouth by the same
tally last Saturday

Leading the Pioneer attack
in the No. 1 slot is Ken Scho-
ﬁeld, ioilowed by Chris Vaughn,
Jim Spell, Doug Gilbertson.
Grant Crandall and Phil Mears.
Spell and Gilbertson are 20 in
singles competition while the
rest of the team is 1-1.

Crandall and Gilberlsun are
Coach Edgar Mullii‘ls’ only re-
turning lettermen. The other
team members are up from an
undeieated (4-0) freshman team
and are expected to help im-
prove last season’s 1-8 record.

Frosh Trockmen
Future Bright

Grinnell has a freshman
track team, and a very good
one at that. During the indoor
season the team was undeieut-
ed in the league and won the
conference championship in the
sprint and distance medley re-
lay events.

With the outdoor season in
progress the freshmen appear
strong in distance with Chuck
McGrath and Phil Morales, in
the sprints with Carl arenner
and Jonathan Stein, middle dis-
tance with Neil Onerheim and
Steve Hil‘shon, as well as with
Jim Pirolli in the hurdles and
Al Hammond in the field
events.

The freshmen will have their
first outdoor meet on Saturday
when they go with the varsity
to the Cornell relays at Mount
Vernon.

Evonson Stars
Pioneers Lose

Thor Evenson, the Pioneer‘s
star high jumper, placed in six
events Tuesday in Grinncll's
first dual meet of the season
against Loras College, Dubur
que.

Evenson won the lzeyd. high
hurdles, the high jump and the
broad jump. But despite his
well-rounded e f f o rt Grinnell
lost the meet, 116-20. The meet
was min during a chilly rain-
fall.

The Pioneers will compete to-
mormw in the Cornell Relays.
Their performance is question—
able since they have not had a
track to train on so far.

Eligibility Question Plagues Frosh

Should freshmen be eligible
for varsity athletics? It so, in
which sports? What is to be
gained by opening varsity com-
petition to frosh?

The question or ireshmon eli-
gibllity is more than a month
away from coming up beiore
the Midwest Collegiate Confer-
ence faculty representatives,
And even then It will only be
in the second stage of a three
part procedure {or final sanc-
lion.

Should it survive the May
meeting oi the MCAC represen-
tatives, it will come to a vote
as a recommendation in the
fail and be presented to the
schools.

Dr. G. Mendoza, Grinnell’s
representative to the MCAC
sees the chances of the issue
surviving as thin. He notes that
support and opposition to the
question vary among represen-
tatives and that there has been
very little comment on the
issue at all.

One of the factors which dis-
courages freshmen eligibility is
