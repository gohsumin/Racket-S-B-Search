“We do not intend to tie»

those churches who did Wel-
come our representatives in
their services," the letter con»
tinued. “But of sixteen
churches in Grinnell, towa, ono
halt ilatly refused to allow the
presence of students to accept
donations or to announce the
rally in support or Dr. King‘s
movement.”

“The justification given by
these pastors,” tlte letter ex-
plained, “has generally been
the ‘Conservation of establish»
ment autonomy,’ that all re-
quests he cleared through the
administrative apparatus or
their ‘church boards] ”

“Has Christianity in Ameri»

“I never intend to adjust my-
self to militancy or the selt~
lacerating eiiecta oi violence,’
King had told the Grinnell
community, ”I constantly raise
my voice against riots. But at-
ter coiideming riots it is Hebe
essaiy to condemn just as vi.
ciotlsly the conditions that iiots
form under."

People who ignore the ciuli
rights cause, Rev. King had
told the more-than-capacity
crowd or 4,000 in Darby Gym-
nasium, “are sleeping through
it revolution."

"Aliy individualaor nation——
today that teels he can live
alone," he had told them, "is

himself to “Iellow members of
What I might call the Young
Negro Intelligentsia."

"Where are you going wllh
your $11,000 educatimt?’ Farbes
asked themr “fake a few secs
nails and stop your learning. . .
Take a long, hard look at what

you."

“For with the death oi Mar-

president concluded, “you will
see more titan just the death

whispered, closing his polemic
in Herrick Friday noon, “so

American society) has been
crushed in the eyes or Negro
youth."
