The youthful Pioneers — only
one of the first seven is a senior—

College in holiday tournament ac-

tion last week to stay at the .500
level.

“I was somewhat disappointed
in our overall play in the tourna<
merit.” Ptltseh revealed. “Our ei-
fort was good, but we were not
well organized. We had too many
lapses — especially mental ones—
on both offense and defense.”

However, Piltsch did have some
kind words tnr his Charges For in-
stance, there was their comeback

i always regretted that the sepa<

Glee Club at Gtinnell were dropped
several years ago

i was a member oi the Mens

seasons, 1913-1916. We always had
a good time singing together just
tor the joy of singing. since then I
have sung with the University Glee
Club of New York tor 45 years. We
still sing for the joy of singing and
it is enjoyed by our audiences.

I hope the Scarleteers and the
Tanagers will increase inrpopulari-

numbers and be fully enjoyed by
the singers and their audiences,

All power to them,
