Childish RIO‘l‘S

During the past week thousands of Ne-
groes peacefully demonstrated in the strilfe—
torn ci V of Birmingham, a crisis was oc—
curl lg in Haiti, and Grinnell students pare
tieip ted in two S1 'lng Riots, a grand wu-
tel' fight, and Sp 'ng Day.

While 2,400 Negroes chanted, "We want
to be free," a few hundred Grinnell stun
dents either condoned or actively aided in
two Spr g Riots. The first of these was
destructive.

Windows and screens were broken
staged the first succesr
ful panty raid in modem Grinnell his-
tory, This raid was a by—product of at-
tempts to spur the women into defying
hours,

The next night a less spontaneous riot
occurred. Dittoefl messages saying, “Toe
night is the real thing;" were distributed.

The Central (Riot) Committee asked the

woman students to be out of the quad till
2 am.

This riot aborted, as too many stu-
dents were in cl ofyan overdose of play
groundelike activi es.

Stephen B. Wood, dean of men, called
the riot “childish,” and for once the Scar»
let and Black would like to go on record as
agreeing with him. The Riots, if they
proved anything, showed that on the whole,
student responsibility is at a low ebb. It
also showed that, at what we claim to be

one of the best educational institutions in

effect afford to give up studying for five
or six days.

The Riots were negative, if they were
anything: They put the Student Govern-
ment Association Preside t, Jack Chapman,
in a bad bal ining posi on when he asks
the administ dtion to delegate more power
to the students. Is this the type of thing
the administration can expect if the stu-
dents al'e granted the power to initiate
rule changes? Thus last week was a big‘
step backward.

Probably the most discouraging thing
about the Riots is that they clearly illusA

Toynbee: Remain in Human World

A Grinnell College audience
Monday was told that the great-
est been of a combined classical
and religious education is that
it is an antidote to the intelleCr
tual error and spi tual sin of
assuming that man is the high—
est spiritual presence in the uni-
verse

“All higher religions and phir
losophies oppose‘ and condemn
this anthropocentric view,", Ar-
nold J. Toynbce, Heath visiting
professor of history, said

to make sortie: from it, drag~
ging his chains, inic otbori
lworlds, Anyone who has had a
Western classical education in
Latin and Greek can look at the
contcmporary world, not, pen
haps, with a Grcck’s or Roman's
eyes, but with a fifteenthcen-g
tury Italian humanist’s eyes,"

Fashimi Allotment

Since the newspaper Is the only permanent
record of the vital issues that confront us from
week to week, we can all probably guess what
this column is going to be about.

One of the most interesting accusations to
arise from this Week’s first Spring Riot was
that it was “uncreative.” Not only that but so
many people were ashamed of the entire enter-
prise that they staged another one the next night,
presumably to make up in organization what
they lost in spon}aneity,

It seems that nobody can quite decide what
they want. A ”creative" riot would evidently
involve something bizarre. like the theft of Darby
gym. On the other hand, this woiild probably
require a certain amount of coordinnicdcffort.
especially in finding someplace to put it; and
such things are contrary to the Grinnell student's
general independence in thinking for himself,
and thus never getting anything like that done.

Those who somehow managed to get away
with it without disappearing forever can boast
of the day when they not only cut oft all the lights
in the library, but also chained up all the doors
and trapped ‘ everybody inside. Of cause, the
gravity of this accomplishment may be exagger-
ated, because nowadays such an act would im»
prison the entire student body instead of just
the students.

But that sort of thing is contrary to the whole
‘dca anyway A riot is supposed to be a violent

order. and so maybe those critics of this Week's
activities can only be ashamed of the lack of vi —
lelice. Mr. Walden, on the other hand, can prob-
ably be somewhat concerned by inc amount of
violence done his window screens, and must only
regret that it’ll be hard to collect the half mil-
lion dollars he figures it’ll cost to get them

Forum For Descent

fixed

The real issue here is the mysterious naiui-c
of Grinnell disorder. It seems that whatever
disorder is created during the day, suddenly
disappears at midnight. Grinncll girls are evi~
dently creatures of habit But because this
punches holes in the earlier notion that people
around here are too independent to function as
a group, we need some kind of new theory for
all future Spring Riots.

1 don't think we ought to take the adminis
'tration to heart when they claim this sort of
thing is childish A proper mature sort of dis-
order would no doubt emulate the attitudes at
Carleton. where the editor of the newspaper
suggested a sit-in of all men in the women’s
halls and vice verse. I somehow imagine such
adult behavior would simply be too much to
contend with.

So I w’ould like to propose that instead of
one riot every year, We take the events of this
week to heart and have two from now on. One
could be a master plot of gigantic proprtions.
involving the disappearance of something im-
portant or valuable. The sophistication of this
enterprise could gradually improve to the point
where a lot of good might even get done, For
next year I suggest a plot to get Dean Wood's.
legendary tape recorder and all its used reels.

The other night of rioting would include such
traditional aspects as the abduction of student
officials and the waiving of women’s hours. Only
from then on there would be no threat of dis-
ciplinary action, because the student body could
use whatever they hzid stolen the night before
with a certain bargaining power. lf any girl
get fined for staying out late. we’d simply to
refuse to return whatever vital' part of the coir
lcge that was missing.

 

Poor Communication Criticized

Delivering the last of a series
of lectures on “The Philosophy
of History,” and using “An Ap-
proach Through 2: Classical Edu-
cation” as his subject, the noted
British historian added:

“This education in a classical
culture and in a higher religion
has a double advantage. It does
not take one out of our human
world into the non—human
world of protons and nebulae.
This is of grcat practical value,
because human beings are good
at dealing with human nature.
Therefore, we cannot afford to
neglect the humanities, To drop
these and fly off into physical
science is a form of escapism
and will bring its nemesis.

”At the same time, a classical
education, while keeping one in
the human world, takes onc out
of the particular contemporary
cell of it in which he happens
to have been located by the ac-
cident of birth.

“or course, one can never
brcak away completely from
his own time and place, but a
classical education enables him

To the Editor:

Several weeks ago there were

labout the quality of dress of the

last week there has been quite
a bit of discussion, mostly in the
Senate. about the Women’s So-
cial Budget, especially the Fash-

The problem. as usual, )5 one
of communication. One of the
things that sets Grinnell above
the run of the mill college is
the generally excellent commune
ication bctwccn faculty and stu~
dents. There are, as i see it, no
great stumbling blocks in the
path of faculty-administration
c o m m u meation. Unfortunately,
there is no communication be-
tween the students and the ad-
ministration.

How might a student at Grin-
neil communicate to the ad
ministration? There seems to be
only one avenue open to such
a student, the avenue cl protest.
Since the student has virtually
nothing to say about any ad-
ministrationul edict, the only
methods by which he can ex-
press his fcclings

either acceptance or protest,

in turn, there is only one
path by which the administrative
personnel of this college can talk
to the students, And that is the
imperative path, the path of

 

giving orders. As l understand students, but the students have

about any ,

 

the rules and regulations of this
institution, there is absolutely
no provision for either the stu
dents or the administration to
discuss, argue, learn, debate, ex»
plain, moderate, compromise,
convince, or be convinced,

Who is to blamclef coursc,
both groups are at fault, but 1
am afraid that the primary bur-
den of guilt must fall upon the
student body, Thc administra-
tion seems to have made several
honest attempts to open an aver
nue of communication with the

openings,

What can be done now? Very
,llttle. it seems to me. The ad-
ministration has apparently ace
ccpted the student's judgment of
himself as an eternal picket. It
is now the student’s responsibil-
ity to modify this role. The ad-
ministration, which has emerged
from this discussion in what is
probably a better light than it
deserves, must decide to listen
to the students, and listen to
them honestly,
