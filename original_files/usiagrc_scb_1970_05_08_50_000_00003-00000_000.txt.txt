Chorus oi Barbarians

The Senators, Wisemen oi
Collegium

Prologue: A crisis hovers over
the kingdom of Collegium. A
proposal is before the Senate, the
acceptance of which will give the
barbarians an equal vote in the
governance oi the kingdom. The
proposal was brought to the
Senate by those who think that
the barbarians are really
Colleagues at heart. The Senate
sits in solemn Conclave to decide
on the late of the kingdom.

Act I:

First Senator: I see that a
number of our young brethren
are missing, Why is that?

Second Senator: They do battle
tor the glory ol Collegium on the
Macus Campus.

First Senator; It is just as well.
The young tight better than they
govern anyway.

Enter King Leggettus.

King Leggettus: According to
the words of the great
philosopher Staussus, “if halt the
people in attendance are here,
that constitutes a quorum." I
agree. We must make progress
today, people of Collegium. The
eyes of the whole country are
upon us.

Senators: Amen.

“HOFFKAN am: Ronni. all hair,

do not expect to be perceived as
beautilul; they expect to be per-
mind as ugly. The animation oi
ugliness, which they personally
epitomize, l: the aesthetic version

They deliberately and icily intend

human being at ihal has been a1.

Act II:

Enter Wallus.

Walllls: We understand that the
Senate is making splendid
progress on the barbarian pro-
blem. best you are soon idle, we
bring to you another solemn
proposal. since this proposal,
which will heretofore be known
as the Clotus Feltus proposal, is
at least twice as important as the
barbarian proposal, it lollows by
iron logic that you will be able to
make a sage decision on it in ones .*
lourth the time, We know your
mettle, people oi Collegium.
Thus, not only will we vote on the
Feltus proposal at the next
solemn conclave, we will try to
leave time [or as little discussion
as possible. You have made
Collegium great, you alone can
preserve her greatness.

Third Senator: You cannot be
serious prince. Surely you jest.

Christianus: Incredible. In-
credible. Incredible. Incredible. I
am surprised.

Gilmour. the Oracle: Hearken!
The winds of change are blowing
through Collegium. The bar-
barians are our friends. We will
have peace in our time.

Act‘l:

Enter Chorus oi Barbarians.

King Leggettus: 0 Captain, my
Captain, speak.

Kleinschlnidt: When I was a
young man, the laws wererjust.
and Collegium like nature herself
formed an ordered hierarchy.
Even Shakespearc, who will not
be born (or at least another 1,500
years, understood it when he will
say.

1 am a Lame-Duck-Captain,
but hearkcn to my words, We
would do ill to let the barbarians
participate in the governance ot
the kingdom. I Cast my lot with
civilization.

Chorus oi barbarians: That is a
mute point.

Gilmour: Hearken. The winds
at meaningful participation blow
through Collegium, The bars
barians can meaningfully par-
ticipate in destroying the corrupt
civilization. They may even
destroy me. Let them. I deserve
to suffer. I am a bleeding heart
liberal. I have been complacent
too long.

Chorus of Barbarians: We may
be barbarians now, but wait until
tomorrow. We deserve to be, we
must be, we demand to be
Collegues. This is not a threat, let
it be understood. We Speak with
reason. Even your own members
