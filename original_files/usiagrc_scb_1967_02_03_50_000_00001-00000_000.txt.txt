New Town Branch to Open

Mental Health Clinic Coming;
Will Serve Grinnell Students

By Paul Nachman

Establishment of a mental
health clinic in Griiinell awaits
only the hiring of personnel
to staif it, The new facility will
be available to students.

The Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Clinic, to be located
in the Grinnell Community HDS~
pital, will be more accessible
[0 students than the Jasper
County Mental Health Center
in Newton, which currently
serves the college.

County otticiais are present-
ly seeking a fullntlnie psycholo-
gist and a halt-time social
worker for the new clinic, to
be a branch at the Jasper
County center, Di: Leroy K.
Bel‘i‘yhill, director and staff
psychiatrist in Newton, will head
the joint operation.

Associate Dean R i c h a r d
H. W i n t e r s explained
that Poweshiek County will not
get a fully-staffed mental health
center because the county's
19.000 population base is too
small to iinancially support
the necessary psychiatrist. in-
stead, the Gl'innell iacility will
be a inst-step clinic for stu-
dents and for county resrdetits.
Each patient will make at
least one trip to the Newton
center for consultation with Dr.
Berryhill, although protracted
treatment may be administered
by the Grinnell stuti after the
evaluative examination in New-
um.

Winters noted that the col-
lege has encouraged the estab-
lishment of a clinic in Grinnell
since 1963, when it helped pro-
vide ﬁnancial backing tor in-
itiation of the Newton center,
“There is increased incidence
of need among students for
psychological and psychiatric
care,” he continued,

Winters attributed this in-
creased incidence to the great»
er pressures on today’s stu«
dents, chieily grades, parental
expectations and worries about
graduate school, as well as
heightened popular awareness
or psychological problems

Winters commented that stu<
dents desiring psychological
consultation have the option or
going directly to the clinic it
they don't want the college
administration to know about
their problems, Most students,
though, are referred to the
clinic through the deans’ oi-
fice. "We don’t tell any stu-
dent he must go unless it is
a critical case," the dean em»
phasized. The college pays the
fees for a student's initial 3-6
Visits to the clinic.

Citing iigures tor the last
three and a halt school years,
Winters noted that approxi-
mately 40 students use the
Newton facilities each year,
each student averaging three
interviews. However, the num<
ber of staifrhours the Newton
center devoted to Grinnell stu-

dents jumped from about 140
in both 1963-64 and $64-65 to
190 in 196566

Twenty-nine students used the
Newton center during the fall
semester for a total of 98
staii-hours, indicating another
substantial increase for this
year, With the opening of the
new Grinnell clinic, Winters
anticipates increased student
use of mental health counsel-
ing “it (or no other reason
than greater convenience.”

At a Monday night meeting
in the Gi'innell Veteran Mem«
orial Center, Dr. Berryliill laud-
ed the Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Association and the
county's Board oi Supervisors
tor the steps taken to initiate
the Poweshiek clinic. The su<
pervisors, at the urging of the
Mental Health Association,

Probable Hours Change Affirmed

Leggett Tells Committee Position;
Final Decision Comes in Spring

By Don Winney

In a formal statement to the senate Wednesday President Legs
gett announced the recommendation of the FCSA to abolish wom-
en's hours, The President said he and the trustees would consider
the proposal and that a decision on the matter would be made

public in the spring.

“1 have concerns about some
aspects oi the proposal,” the
Prestdent said. “but at the
minimum, I expect to take an
aiiil'mative attitude on the mat-
ter of some liberalization in
women's hours." Any new pol-
icy, he said, would take effect
next tall,

The President spoke inform-
ally of the college’s plans ior
the future, both academic and
physical. Mentioning the plans
for a recreational and service
complex. he said, “Darby Gym-
nasium would be redesigned
as a group recreational space
tor bowling, ping pong, and
other activities.”

A women's residence hall,
Leggett said, is being planned
for 150 students, 75 of whom
are now on campus. The hall
will be an extension of Loose
Hall, and the additional space
will provide tor new lounge
areas on South Campus. The
renovation of existing residence
halls is also under considera.
tion as is the construction of
a new men's hall sometime in
the future

The President announced a
proposed iive year program to
raise Ill-12 million dollars {or
the college. Half of the money
will be used for physical con-
struction, the other half for
faculty salaries, new depart-
ments such as an East Asian
one, and liberalized loan and
scholarship programs for stu-
dents

”As college costs rise," said
Mr. Leggett, “we must realize
the danger of attracting stu-
dents only irom the upper mid.
dle class. Grinnell has always
welcomed students from all
social backgrounds,"

The President said the fac-
ulty's educational policy com»
mittee will “hopefully” make
recommendations to him by
June on how to relate Grin-
nell's commitment to liberal
education to the need tor pre-
professional education.

Associate Dean Winters then

service will be established in

Winters also spoke frankly
about the tiring ot the house

dents) people not so far re

ington to see Secretary of stats
