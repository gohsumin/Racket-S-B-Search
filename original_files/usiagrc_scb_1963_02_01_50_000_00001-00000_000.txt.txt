Douglas indicated that this
split might not be purely ideo—
logical. He mentioned that Siber-
ia, just to the north or Red
China, could easily take in one

l On the topic of India, Doug‘-

at some tribunal betcre which
"hey can be made to account ioi
their actions, The only such ei-

I In the lecture, Justice Doug—
‘ las emphasized that while in—
dia has iollowed a pattern oi
remaking the country by po—
litical methods, Red China has
been stressing army might. By
attacking India recently, Red
china has forced iridia to pour
money intended tor peaceiul
projects into the building of

a more eiiective army.

The American policy toward
Formosa was criticized by Doug-
las, He alleged that the govern-
ment oi Chiang K- '.shck is cor—
rupt and that United States and
lie being wasted there. He fur-
l thci- contended that this country
,ought to recognize the cover

it is representative or the ma.
