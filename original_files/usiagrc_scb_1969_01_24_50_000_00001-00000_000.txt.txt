' Registration Questions

Iy LEE MAIIL

Guen‘ﬂe die-aver Qontlmlej to grow
end it doesn't matter that they're not the
San Francisco mime troop. whet does
matter is that people, students, have
formed the beginning: at a group, that
talks and listens to each other in spite of
tho luck of endemic credit, computer
curds, Kumlsed instructions . .their
massage remains general, their goals
ltlll obscure, but it really doesn't mat»

Z ter. They made us think, they made a
joke out or registration, they made us
realize that the only ones who should
take registration seriously are the
clerks, secretaries, and the computer.

“it's nice to see everyone. Here have
some mace. Get your brains here only
3100 dollars. All you have to do is plug

At first sullen seniors full of a week's
studying for comps, worried about their
last oral, thinking about the world out
side Grinnell, pale
faces, girls that lound
themselves crying tor
no reason at all, Christ~
mas somehow isn't what it used to be,
even the mystical magic of sounds and
sights somehow suppressed by grad
school applications, Peace Corps, Vista,
army, and the alternatives seem to be-
come minimized as time runs out. . .
they don't even want to talk about it.
And so they look sadly, it at all, at the
painted clowns with hairy legs and when
the grim reaper hands them a diploma
its not really so tunny, not really so
tunny at all. Four years at Grinnell,
eight registrations, this is the last, and
shades ot the tirst year standing out-
side Darby, some staying all night, you
don't ever forget

And so it’s sounds go away, you're
not funny, Grinnell isn't so bad because
if it. were, I wouldn’t have stayed here
so long. . .but the grim reaper’s plastic
scowl doesn't flinch and staring at him,
even at eight o'clock in the morning, is
something you can't laugh off. The sen-
ior-s didn’t laugh at all,

The morning dragged on and guerilla
theater got better as their voices
warmed up, their bodies moved more
naturally, and the monotonous voice of
the brainseller drilled into faces which

there in a message involved. You nit the
piece or candy Ind the montage slides
down your dry throat musing bit: of
deadened saliva hiding from the usual
gluey breakfast. it's easier to be happy

It's easier to go lltmg with the joke, the
time in line goes lust, and the cold air
is retreshing when its all over.

The younger you are, the bigger the
joke. Freshmen stand Outside in the
Cold oblivious to everything that‘s hap-
pening inside. They don’t have to Stand
outside but they do anyway, its all part
of Standing in line, and you just follow
the guy in front of you and it's so easy
when everything is so simple and yes
Grinnell College is so Simple.

themselves and their iamilles and When
at last everything has been said that
can be. they’ll again sink into the rou-
tlne of a warm library.

We aren’t here to stand in llne, nor to
sit in class and stare at the teacher, but
to realize what is happening to us and to
our lriends. The blurbing paragraphs in
the catalogue which are anxiously read
by high school seniors and somehow,
even though no one will admit it, hoped
and prayed tor by everyone here, remain
words, just words, which have as little
meaning as most oi the academic
courses. its not relevance I'm talking
about, though I think its important, but
something even more general, some
kind of education which allows you to
make your own mistakes tree or grade

his Wooden chair. . .it's the whole idea

From the Lenox Quartet to
Students, Faculty and Admin-
istration.

We wish to announce that
we have accepted an appoint—
ment as Quartet in Residence
at the State University of New
York at Binghamton effective
July, 1969.

Since 1962 we have been
Al‘tists-in—Residence at Grin-
nell College, The relationship
which We have had with the
College has been very gratify-
ing to us. The support and ap—
preciation to the college com-
munity has made our stay here
I very meaningful one It is in
this spirit of contentment and
because of the quality‘ of Grin-
nell College as a liberal arts in-
stitution, that we regret leav-
ing for this new nppointment.

-We simply hope that the Ar-

tists-in-Residence Program is

No. I!

an ideal which the College will
continue.

A major involvement at
SUNY Binghamton will be a
new graduate program in the
performance of chamber music
— the first program of its kind.
We will train string quartets
for careers in this profession.
We feel that this type of pro«
gram is vital to the develop
ment of chamber music in this
country. As in Grinnell we will
also presnet concerts, lecture
recitals. and private instruc-
tion.

Our experience at Grinnell
has been deeply fulfilling. We
will miss our friends Ind col-
leagues very much.

New Cache For Old Boolts

The student used book store has been
in operation tor three years, working as
a student service and making just about
no prorits (375 it loo or so extra books
last year). The store buys textbooks at
60% of cost and sells them at 70% of
Cost Also, at the end oi the year it
buys books from Seniors on a cash basis
at 40% 0t cost. The hours oi the used
book store, which is located in the
basement of the Fine Arts building, are
“sporadic", according to the manpower
that can be obtained. The useil book
store will continue in operation “as long
as students are selling or buying books
. . .or until the theatre department
throws us out",

One at the problems of the used book
store is space and location. “Due to an
expanding volume oi texts" more room
is needed. Also, Tom Thomas, SGA

president, would like to see the store
expand into being more than simply a
temporary thing, limited only to text-
books. This would mean having the
store open. “say, on Monday and Wed-
nesday nights Irom seven to nine"
year-round, sewing not just as a used
book exchange but also as a place tor
records, posters, paper, and new books
to be bought and sold at lower prices
than those found in the book store or on
the open market, It would thus provide
competition with the book store, leading
to possible lowering ot prices time.

it a more central and spacious loca-
tion could be found. it more manpower
could be obtained and it more capital
would be made available, the used book
store could “begin year-round opera-
tion as a useful service to the student
body".
