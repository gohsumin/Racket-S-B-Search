Poor Shooting Leads lo Loss
As Basketball Season Siarls

By Steve Casey

Grinnell started its basketball
season with a 89-76 loss to Angus»
tana on Tuesday night. The game
was close for the iirst half with
Augustana taking a 44—40 lead, But
Grinnell let up at are beginning of
the second half and Augustana
Spurled to a fifteen point lead that
they protected for the rest of the
game.

Poor shooting was a big factor in
the loss. Grinnell got enough shots
but could not make enough of them
to keep the pressure on the Augus-
tano defense. The Grinneli defense
employed a manta-man full court
press for most of the game. This
gave Augustana some easy shots
when a small Grinnell player
Would be forced to guard a tall
Augustana player under the basket.
But Coach Pfitsch was doing some
experimenting to see if he Could de-
velop a defense for the small Pio»
neers to use against some future
tall opponents Grinllell will face.

Coach Ffitsch was pleased with
the work of his front line. Jim
Rhodes seems to have recovered
from a pro-season injury and
played well. Ted Risser and Clyde
Smith also played commendable
games. Pfitsch though was di5<
appointed with the play of the
guards whom he is relying on.

Wrestlers Open Al
Knox This Weekend

A defending champion plus third
and fourth place finishers from a
ear ago will lead the Grinnell
ollege wrestling team when it
opens its 1964455 season at Knox
Invitational in Galesbur‘g, on Fri~
day and Saturday.

Captl Larry Miller, is the defenda
ing champion The 167~pollnder has
lost only one regular season match
in two seasons as a Pioneer, that
at the Knox inVltational two sea-
sons back when he came in sec
and. In 1963, he took the title with
it pin and two decisions.

Other Grinnell placers last year
were Ken Strubler, third at 130,
and Morgan Michel, fourth at
heavyweight. Coach Edd Bowers
is counting on all three to place
high again this year.

Letterman Bill Barnes will be Rt
123 and is another likely placer,
but the rest of the lineup is a ques-
tloxl mark. Mike Deatherage, Cliff
Dowling, and Lynn Richman, all
sophomores, will probably fill the
137., 147., and lsrpounol spots, but
Bowers hasn't decided on the or-
del'.

Bob Geller, another sophomore,
is the likely 177rpounder. At 19l,
veteran Marty Ringo is a question
mark because of a knee injury.

The loss of two certain regulars
has added to Bowers woes. Ken
Clymer, last year's 157-pounder,
dropped from the squad, and Jeff
Lewis, one of the 1963M squad
leaders, hasn't come out. However,
Lewis, a 177-pounder, may join the
squad after Christmas.

Bowers also plans to take nine

rinnell freshmen to me meet.

hey are Mike Martinson, 115; Jim

Klnyon, 123; Joel Richman. 130;
Rich Segool, 137; John Sharpe, 147;
Jeff Patterson, 157; Louis Kelley,
167 Dr 177; Tom McLaughlin, 167
or 177; and Phil Jones, heavy-
Weight.

 

The starting lineup against Cor-
nell Saturday will be Jeff Franz
and Eliot Hibbs at guard, Jim
Rhodes at Center, and Ted Risser
and Tom Hill. at forwards with
Clyde Smith as the sixth marl. Sat-
urday's opponent Cornell is the top
team in the league according to
pro-season forecasts.

As the season reaches the
halfway point, a tight race has
developed for the first spot in
I. M. Volleyball between three
contenders—North, Smith, and
Rawson. North leads the pack
for the third straight week, cur-
rently sporting a 22-2 record,
Smith (20-4) has moved up a
notch from last week to sec-
ond position, dropping Rawson
(24-8) to third. Clark (25-11) is
desperately hanging on to the
fourth spot. Since the impor-
tant headron clashes between
the top three or four teams
haven't taken place yet, it's
too early to count anyone out.
For the time being, anything
can happen.

Basketball Team Has
Five Senior Captains

Grinnell College‘s basketball
team this winter will have more
captains than some armies.

The 16»man squad has named
five captains—the entire sen»
ior contingent-making it pos-
sible for Coach John Pfitsch
to have an entire team of cap-
tains on the floor, , . . or on
the bench in reserve.

The captains are Tom Buch-
holtz, Randy Morgan, Dave
Sellergren, Clyde Smith, and
Dick Ulrich.

Pfitsch hasn’t 'yet decided
whether all five will captain
each game or if they will take
turns. But one thing is cera
tain, any time he shouts, “Hey,
captain!" he will get replies
from all over the gymnasium.
