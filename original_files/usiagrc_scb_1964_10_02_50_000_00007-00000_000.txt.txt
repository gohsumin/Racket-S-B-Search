Grinnell Harriers Defend Tille
In Les Duke Meel Saturday

Coach Dick Young’s Pioneers
will be hard pressed to retain
their championship at Grinnell
College's third annual Les Duke
Invitational c r o s 5 country
meet on Saturday, Oct, 3.

The meet will be run on the
College’s 3-mile course and will
begin at 1:25 p,rn. (CDT) on
Ward Field.

Other teams in the meet will
be Luther. Loras, Graceland,
and Central. All five clubs are
given a chance to capture the
title because of outstanding in-
dividuals or good team balance.

A year ago, Luther, Loras,
and Graceland came in second,
third. and fourth, respectively,
as Grinnell took the crown,
The Pioneers also won in 1962.

But injuries and other disap-
pointments that have continued
since the initial day of practice
have dimmed Grinnell hopes
of a third championship.

 

The meet is named after Les
Duke, is former Grinnell foote
ball, basketball, and track great
who later coached and taught
here. Duke is one of the coun-
try’s top track starters and an-
nually serves in that capacity
at the Drake Relays and Kan-
sas Relays. He’s also a former
commissioner of the Iowa Con-
ference.

eighteen the Pioneers decided
to gamble. Watt pulled down an
lﬂryard pass on the Ripon 49
good enough for the first down.
Anderson connected on three of
tour passes taking the Pioneers
to the 21. Gauger then snared
a toss over the center for the
touchdown with {our and one-
hali minutes left on the clock.

Gridders Face Knox Salurday

By Kenton Clymer

The Pioneers, off to a shaky
start last Saturday against de-
fending champions Ripon, hope’
to get oil on the right loot this
Saturday, when they meet Knox
on Ward field.

On paper. the Pioneers have
the edge. They have more expe-
rience, and a larger squad.
Knox, coached by Al Partin, is
a young team. counting mainly
on the strength of tour sopho-
mores. All four were outstand»
ing last year as freshmen. ,

If they come through in the
clutch, the Siwash could be
tough. They are definitely
stronger than last year, and
their line averages 205 lbs. com-
pared to Grinnell's 199 lbs. Be-
SIdes a strong line, the Siwasll
have more depth in the back-
field than they had last year.

Despite th e improvement,
Knox suffers from a relatively
small team. There are only 25

 

members on the varsity squad.

Coach Edd Bowers of the
Pioneers thinks Knox may be
a dark horse this year, despite
their 1070 loss last .week w
Beloit. He plans to make a few
changes in the lineup, which
he hopes will strengthen the
Pioneers. Morgan Michel will
probably be in the lineup as on
iensive center. and Barry An.
derson will likely see more
action this game. ‘

Larry Miller will be out for
the Knox game, perhaps for
the following Week also. RF:
placing Miller at guard will be
either Rick Anderson or,Skip
Weyrauch.

Coach Bowers is cautiously
optimistic about the outcome.
He expects to see a strong pass-
ing attack from the Siwaslh, and
thinks that, in Order to Win. the
team must develop a stronger
mental attitude toward the
game. ,

Langham will be at fullback.
Alan Rossman will back them

up.
Bruce Kaufmann will. be in
customary spot in the nets.
