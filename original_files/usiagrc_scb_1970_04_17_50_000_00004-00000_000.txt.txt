a minimum amount that students

In the discusston of Benton’s
proposal, both Andy Lowei and
DaVid Htirwatt took positions that
the strike was primarily an eilort
til the union. Loewi said that it
would be important for the union

dignity “that it be their strike”

iii the toliowiiig discussmn, a
number or students expressed
ttissatislaction iiith Benton’s
proposal, some complaining that
it was too specitie and that there
were “too many variables," and
no action was ever taken on it.
Eventually, a motion was made
by John Royal that the Senate,
assembled as a Committee of the
whole, resolve that they support

Lanlbie told students at the

meeting that the college felt the

care ol iii the college's proposal
by the short term contract He
sziitl tllat the college’s refusal to
include cltccksull provisions by
which the union dues would
automatically be deducted from
employees pay checksl was
based on a concern that union
representatives in Des Moines
and the workers might not stay
in close enough contact other-
\l'isC He said that the present
health insurance plan is best
because it gives the individual
more options, and he dcicnded
the college's proposed date to
start tiie contract tJuly l, 1970)
because it is the start of the
coilegc'sliscalyear.

ntier Lambie spoke, a numbel
oi otliors at the meeting attacked
his position Grant Crandail, a
Itli'mer Grinllell student, suit
that a cost oi livnig adjustment,

colleges otters were satisfac-

said. "These are things that have
licen neglected too long. This
should be rctroaetive six years,

Several students also asked
Mr, Lamble about Mr. Dale

Discussion on Cohen‘s proposal
was lively, with some students
in complete agreement with it,
and others opposed to the idea
at "stopping the educational
process" as a desirable way to
support the strike Still others
urged that action he delayed, so
that students could be in it better

credibly egocentric view oi

old relevance, a fervent belief
that any knowledge which lets
one know that. he is really all
right in the long run and basically
accepted by his peers will allow
him to make his way to the top.
Perhaps one day he can himseli

Solutions? One's hands are
thrown up in despair. He who
could seek to curb conformity
could start with the college
campus just as easily as with
middlerclass America; the task,
in any event, is next to hopeless.
What the student can do is to
keep the academy innetioning,
and to keep it innetioning as an
institution of learning rather than
ellloting, Grinttell is lifeless,
some would say. Agreed, and it
grows more so all the time. It
will continue to move in this
direction until the great bubble
bursts, and the cycle begins its
swing to the other side. A culture
based on satiation of the senses,
bombardment of the mind with
till the latest gimmickry, and a
naive belief in the malignity ot
the nation that spawned it cannot
endure forever. The minds that
lime created Western civilization
ill its sorrow and its
ioagiiihcence, can, and they have
proved it, it is really so mon-
strous to propose more required
