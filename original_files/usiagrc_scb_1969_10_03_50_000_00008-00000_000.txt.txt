composed of deans, faculty
members and students,

Some of the students who as
lembied at the library about
4:30 wore signs saying. “We’re
all stoned; What are you going
to do about it." Shortly after-
wards, the group went to the
Forum and crammed into South
Lounge for an informal, discus-
sion about the new statement
with Deans Alice Low and Con-
niu Kimbo.

Several students cursed audle
biy as Mrs. Low tried to answer
questions put to her by the
crowd Asked why the state
ment was necessary, the Dean
replied, “Every smgle student
must know exactly where we

However, attempts by the ad-
ministration to clarify the drug
policy in recent weeks have re-
sulted in much confusion. At
Wednesday’s discussion both
deans said that Leggett's state.
ment and the new resident ads
visers’ statement are “vague."
Dean Low commented, “Every
person must define for himself
how he fits into the policy." The
deans maintained that. the new
statement was merely a clari-
fication or the existing policy.

Many students complained
that the new policy as “clari-
fied” by the resident advisers
would alienate students by

most significant decisions will

body takes them up, i would
argue that the present student
seats are too important to lie
outside student government.

I would suggest that. a consti-
tutional framework be adopted
which does provide tor some
number of residenually elected
members of a student senate,
so that the individual student
is still represented by someone
he elects, but that in addition
all those who successfully peti—

sit in a student senate.

These latter students know
what their committees are con.
sidering and preparing; they
know something of faculty sentie
ment on these matters. They
need to communicate, regularly

the student senate is to be cap
able of passing informed and
weighty legislation in the name
of the student body.

In reply to Mr. Cooper’s
thoughtful letter (printed in
the 8&3 of 27 September), I
can only say that it is quite
true that both committee work
and parliamentary debate are
often slow. It may take a great

and that body may send it back
to committee, table it. for some
Weeks, or in various ways tako
up a great while before actual-
ly passing or killing it (com-
plete with substitutions and
amendments).

But legislation to deal with
a complex problem may itself be
complex if it is to prove work-
able; and even if both issue and
legislation can be tersely
phrased, the considerations to
be weighed may be difficult
and the body divided. Only
time, in which everyone con-
cerned can think the matter
over, make up his mind, and
reconcile himself, perhaps, to
the likely defeat of his position,
can grease the wheels sufficient
1y to allow any new legislation
to emerge at all.

students, of course, who_may

Senior Michael Penzner, presi-

that counselors be separated

Much confusion arose over
exactly who was responsible for
the new interpretation of the
role of the resident advisers.
Many students have charged
that Dean Low formulated the
statement without the R.A.’s
knowledge. Dean Low stated,
.“We (the deans) have never put
a statement out." Apparently,
Dean Low’ instructed the resi-
