SCARLET AND ILACK

Retrospective/y Speaking"
'Iiose, Were The Days]!

By Susan Taylor

When we returned to the campus
in the fall there was a great hole
in the ground where the new union
was supposed to be under con-
llruction.

But small worries had to be re-
pressed in order to take care of
the needs of the ever»present fresh-
men, and after they got through
with registration, we began to set-
lle down to a fairly normal aca-
demic year.

Dr. Bowen introduced us to the
place of women in the world in
his convocation address; we were
made well aware of the new liquor-
by-the-room ordinance; and the
first weekend concert was a per-
formance by Lambert, Hendricks,
and Banan. Well received.

The new thing for the year
seemed to be the Seminar on Or-
der. It went on in a somewhat
orderly manner throughout the
year. See your own notes for its
content.

The first big social event was
Homecoming. We lost the football
game by one point, All of the
traditional festivities went on, i
guess. I don’t remember — i
went home for the four day week-
and.

An ex-President graced the
campus and put us in the national
magazines when he fell down the
steps at Grinnell House and was
initiated to West Norris I-lall. Ken
Richards never knew he would be-
come world famous when he won
that election last spring.

Truman made a little speech and
gave a big press conference. He
made an unmistakable but unde<
finable impression on the camp-
us. And soon the always - non -
partisan PPPE was announcing
that lke and Mamie would besour
guests in the Spring of ’65.

The new college chaplain, brought
a fresh personality to the campus
religious life and also brought well:
remembered sermons: “J a s u s
Loses,” "The Opiate of the Peo-
ple,” “Will Success Spoil Joe Col-
iege?" /

The C of HP and the Dean of
Men had their traditional run—ins
and agreed to limit the number
of ice boxes in the balls.

The fall semester was graced by
the WUS Carnival, Dance 1M5<
which were notable for their birth
day celebrations, the election of
senior class officers, the Sympo-
slum.

On the rainy Friday afternoon
of November 22, we stood by tele-
vision and radio in disbelief of the
news from Dallas. No matter what
our political bent, we grieved for
the assassinated President and We
lived with history. The flag at half
mast until Christmas vacation re-
minded us of our feeling of empti~
ness and our bewilderment at wha
we should do. ' \

But as the Government went on
-—if changed—so did the education-
lil process at Grinnell. We went
about the tests and papers and
daily classroom assignments dif-
ferent, fuller people.

Before Christmas Vacation, we
burned the midnight oil, dined at
‘fformal” dinners and danced and
listened to Satchmo and his trum-
pet.

IWhen we got back from vaca-
tion the new Union was more like

 

a giant concrete cave than the
hole in the ground which had
greeted us in September.

0n into finals and then the In-
terim. JLA —- a movie a day —
Stanley Hoffman, Rosenﬁeld Lec-
turer — sleeping — Norwood Rus—
sell Hanson, Kenneth Burke —
comps — beer —- etc. -« etc. —
etc.

And with registration and the
campus motor cycle club we roared
into the second semester. '

Women's Week, grades, concerts,
civil rights, performances, papers,
letters to the editor tests, coffee
hours, speeches, etc., this was the
second semester. This is any se-
mester.

What stands out? Comps?
They’re over. Politics? The worst
is yet to come. The class of ’64?
They are so much a part of the
campus that we must see it as a
whole. »

Seniors and other interested stu-
dents began early to frequent the
placement office. Just how many
have jobs for next year is any-
one’s guess, but we will all re-
member the conferences with
Zeke.

The Beatles had no less effect
on this campus than they did
across the nation, but there were
still some of us who could proudly
say that we did not watch them
on TV.

There was the interdisciplinary
Seminar on Mr. Magoo, the visit
of the Governors, Fetzer Sing—
but I guess We already had my
say on that.

“Tidings Brought to Mary,"
“Major Barbara," “The World of
Shalom Aleichem." And to end it
all the music department finally
did something light and enjoyable
—“Anything Goes." Will we ever
forget Reno Sweeny?

There was the Orchesis Show.
But the tradition was not followed
— Langan, for the most part.
showed up sober.

The Basketball team came
through with a 1240 record, even
if the last home games were dis-
couraging. Mifflin and S un d ell
were voted to the all conference
team.

The SGA Convention was dom—

lnated by 1”: and J’s. Elected

were Johnson, Edquist, Read,
Hartl—opps? Johnson, Read, Ed-
quist and Hartl. The new regime
took over from the old, and with
the change of personality went a
change in style.

The Mock Political Conventions
were PPPE’s biggest show in four
years. Characterized by all the fan-
fare and some of the worst copy
the S d: B has ever printed—Abe
campaigns were carried on for
months. Hatfield and McGee key-
noted. The GOP nominated Lodge-

 

Hatfield and the Demo ballot was
formed by JohnsonrHumphrey. The
Republicans triumphed in the all
campus vote.

President Bowen announced his
resignation -— or rather the news
leaked out—and we learned that he
will be in Iowa City next year.
There were a few damp eyes at
the convention the next morning.
We will miss the Bowens; the col-
lege is lucky to have had them
for 3 years. -

'Spring Riot and Spring Day
managed to occur in different
weeks. The weather for the riot
was wonderful—as were the legal
2:00 hours; but we can’t say so
much for Spring Day —with all
due apologies to the Social Co-
ordinator.

Then there were finals and
comps . . . and now its mostly
over. But the memories and the
friendships will last.

I guess it’s best to close a story
that really has no end with a
salute to the Class of ’64. You will
be remembered.

And the concrete and steel
framework which may someday be
the Grinnell Forum is assuming a
glass coverin . ~
