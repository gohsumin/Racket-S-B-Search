Debate on Viei Nam Policy:
Domino Theory vs Pluralism

Over the past two years a
raging controversy has swept
America concerning United
States policy in South Viet Nam.
Last Tuesday at the Forum’s
South Lounge this controversy
burst into the Grinnell spot.
light in a debate between
Joseph P. Kennedy and Steve
Shender on the question: Shall
We Stand in Viet Nam?

Kennedy, who supported ad-
ministrative policy, took the po-
sition that “the war in South
viet Nam does not represent an
isolated case of Communist sub-
version and that Communist
China presently constitutes a
serious threat to the peace and
security of Southeast Asia."

Shender, his opponent and
sell-proclaimed “member or the
misguided minority” maintain-
ed that "jusr because a nation
has a Communist government
does not mean it is necessarily
a puppet of Moscow or Peking,
and that while the tendency in

the Communist camp is toward
greater pluralism and dissollh
tron, we continue to posit the
existence of a monolithic Com»
munist bogey-man out to de-
stroy us all.”

To Shender the basic goals oi
our iorergn policy should be 1.
to encourage and promote an
international poliiical environ-
ment in which the Chinese will
feel free to alter their stance to
one of greater flexibility and
moderation, and 2. to promote
economic progress among the
peoples oi Southeast Asia.
Shendei‘ stated that “these goals
are not served by our present
policy which is based on a ra-
ther distorted and myopic ver~
Sion of reality.” He also assert-
ed his disbelief in the "domino
theory” and What he called
“oversimplified analogies be-
tween South Viet Nam and
Munich."

Sllender called for an oiier of
unconditional negotiations. ces-
sation of all bombing. cessation
of offensive military tactics, and
a commitment to disengage our
troops with the commencement
oi negotiations,

Kennedy, on the other hand,
stressed that “Man Tse Tung
has committed himself to the
policy that the best way to ex-
tend Communism throughout the
world is by means oi wars oi
national liberation; and that Ho
Chi Minh has stated that he
would like to lead National Lih«
elation Fronts in Thailand, Bur-
ma, Malaya, Cambodia, and
Laos." Kennedy also pointed to
the recent elections in South
Viet Nam in which 80% of the
registered voters “defied Com-
munist terror and elected a con-
stituent assembly. thus taking
a decisive step toward the even-
iual creation of a truly repre-
sentative South Vietnamese
government.

"In aiding the Ky military re-
gime we are resisting the at—
tempt ot Hanoi to take over
South Viet Nam by force of
arms; and we are attempting
to restore South Viet Nam to the
South Vietnamese people.”

At the conclusion of the two
speeches Mr; Charles Ransom,
editorial writer for the Des
Moines Register and Tribune
