de raptu pauciorum

Last Friday as we returned from Newton with what
we had hoped was to be the antepenultimate issue
of the Scarlet and Black, the campus was in turmoil.
Students were flocking to the polling booths outside
the lunch lines, and the overwhelming majority was
voting to close down the school. We dutifully went
and voted for what we felt was right: preservation
of the academic status quo.

No sooner was the student referendum ended than
a faculty meeting began, during which the issue of
closing down the school was to be discussed. As the
faculty members filed into the room, they were handed
petitions for five different ways to do this by five difs
ferent factions of the faculty and students. Everyone
was apprehensive and uneasily preparing for a four-
hour debate on the details.

When President Leggett arrived to chair the
meeting, he did a very shrewd thing. He presented
a proposal to the faculty for closing the school, but
one which most of the faculty felt combined the best
features of all the other proposals. Most, indeed! The
faculty voted 91 to 4 to endorse it,

Thereupon Mr. Morris presented a resolution to
the faculty for committing itself as a body to
a particular political stance. In spite of the protest
of Mr. Ayers and Miss Noble and a few others, the
proposal passed. In other words, the minority individual
conscience was firmly and vigorously raped. But the
faculty was in a hurry to get over to Darby Gymnasium
and collect its standing ovation from the students.

Now, some seven days later, some members of the
community are having secondtﬁoughts. The procedures
which have been hastily rigged to preserve some sem-
blance of an academic commitment to the students
amidst the shambles of this semester are so compli—
cated and inadequate that even those who wanted to
close the school are grumbling among themselves. A
very dangerous precedent has been set that will
ultimately remove all need for argument when
questions such as credit-fail in requirements and majors
come up, when students want to close down the school
in the fall for elections, when the majority wants to
subscribe the name of the college to a political
movement.

Earlier this year, in a report to the faculty by Mrs.
Helena Ponseti, Spanish, on the Midwest Fulbright Con-
ference on Higher Education held at the University
of Iowa, June 1969, these words were spoken: “Institu-
tionsof higher learning operated under several conflict-
ing guiding principles cannot survive. It is not so much

any more ‘a house divided cannot stand’ as ‘an institu-
tion without clear goals cannot exist’." No one listenedi

The eilitors would like to express their gratitude to all those who
have helped with the paper, this semester and a special vote oi thanks
goes to Proiessor n. o. Apostle, who shared with us his invcsllg
into the nature oi a liberal education, something dear to us all.

Letters to the Editors

To the Editor:

It is an observation
common to mankind that
those who try to do what they

have not done for along time do it
ill So it was with the faculty on
May 5th in its attempt to be
moral, One can perhaps
lneasure the current stresses on
mind and body and soul by obs
serving that the iaculty was
driven, for the first time in my
seven years at the College, to
adopt a moral position. In fact,
Dean Wall informs me that the
faculty has not done such a thing
since 1942.

Mr Klausner, doyen of the
philosophy department, maniully
tried to rescue the iaculty from
its violation of tradition and res»
pect for individual conscience; he
moved to Strike the word
“morality” irom the preamble to
the resolution which was ulti~
matcly passed, The preamble
stated that Grinnell College was
devoted to “reason and moral~
lty,” Mr. Klausner’s motion als
most passed, since there was
general agreement that the
faculty had no idea of what mors
allty was. But hotter heads pres
valled and the word “morality”
was kept on pragmatic grounds. 1
was unable to get the floor to
move that the word “reason"
was, in the context, as suspect as
the word “morality."

Let it be on the record that the
iacully took a hastily drawn-up
and badlysworded resolution
from a minority of the students
lsome fraction of 374 hundred
students out of a total of over
two, approved that resolution as
rcpi-csenting a majority or the
students and faculty, and then
Claimed to represent “Grinnell
College as an institution ” The
faculty's action was probably
illegal and certainly immoral. In
suspending classes as a part of
the motion, the laculty violated
its own commitment to education

and demanded that every indivir
dual faculty member comply
with its wrong action.

Ipoint with humble pride to the
fact that I have viewed with
alarm the steady tendency oi the
faculty to move in this direction.
In the past few years we have
seen a shift or power in the
faculty away irom the
old-line liberals who sure
vived the Stevens’ crisis and
over to a group of young instruc-
lors _ dedicated and aggressive
7 who represent what is called
“the new left." After a couple of
years or jockeying, the old»line
liberals have surrendered to the
new left. The illcoalesced coalis
lion is backed, of course, by a
sizable minority ol students;
their combined intentions and
efforts are aimed at (in their bar-
barous jargon) “politicizing” the
College, Tuesday’s meeting was
the first successful step in
“politiclzation.”

“Folilicizalion” CDnSlstS 01' the
lollowing premises: all actions
are political; no individual or me
stitution can avoid being politir
cal; therefore no individual or in-
stitution should try to avoid being
political, and if either does so try,
it should be lorced into taking
sides.

Those of us who read the an-
cient classics 7 which, as
Fielding says, “steel and harden
lhe mind against the capricious
invasions of fortune — remember
our rhucydid‘es- as long as
human nature remains the Same,
Thucydldes’ history will prove
relevant, We are beginning to see
icon-acted the process of revolu-
tion which took place at Corcyra,
one state of which was what the
“new left” calls "politicizalion,"
that is, creating factions so ops
posed that no middle ground is
lcii for sanity, reason, or moral-
ity Those who attempt to occupy
(his middle ground will find that
their golden mean is steeped in
their own blood, as extremists

from either side destroy them.

in the student takeover of the
AFROTC building we observed
the first real violence on orinnell
campus. That violence is sane
tioned by the faculty‘s resolution,
which does not condemn student
violence but only what it calls
“official repression.” in the sad
iigure oi Mr, Ayers, who was in
timidated into leaving his apart-
lnent (at lhe hack'oi the AFROTC
building) ior fear oi what might
happcn to his wife and iniant
child, we behold Grinnell's iirst
political reiugee, Such are the
ominous firstrfruits of “leftrwing
fascism.” Man’s iirst disobedi-
cnce has already been re-com-
mittcd; the primal sin 7 murder
oi brother by brother 7 lies at

the door.

To the Students of Grinnell:

I have just returned from that
clever interpretation oi Robert's
Rules of Order known as a
student body meeting. 1 alter my
congratulations to that meeting
for passing an undistinguished
piece oi sophistic hypocrisyi it
is undistinguished because it
merges into that fine Grinnell
tradition of negative stands and
statements. It is hypocrsiy
because it proposes the
repression oi education — of
library facilities and class — to
serve notice to the world (or at
least the state of Iowai that we
condemn the repression or
education.

David Lcwis asked the ques
tion: “To whom will this proposal
be significant” I ask: “What
will it signify?" It signifies that
Grinnell can act negatively, that
students can disrupt education as
well as national guardsmen, and
yes, that students are against the
taking of life, Who in the world
