hiackest lie: that this war is
being fought in the name, de-
tense, and honor of the Ameri-

would rebuild the Foundation oi
a genuinely tree electoral sys-
tem by speaking truth to power.

In other words, citizens would
ignore the current electoral
system that forces so many
voters to lie to their govern-
ment, and they would express
their opposition to violence and
hatred in a peaceful, loving,

can kill or die for their country
but not vote for it’s leaders

cannot withhold their ballots or
refuse to let them register for
an election.

(2) Voters do not have to wait
{or the government to call or
allow an election; hence they
can hold an election whenever
they wish.

(3) According to government
policy tor processing the bah
lots oi the new system, voting
booth operators mail the bal-
lots directly to Washington, thus
eliminating the delay involved
in the red tape of the current
system,
