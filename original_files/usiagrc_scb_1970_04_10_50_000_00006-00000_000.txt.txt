the rest of 1969. The third issue
of the year came out Septemr
ber 18, 1969, and it did not gen
erate any oi the controversy
that the previous issue had, or
the next would. The publication
at the final issue of Pterodactyl
on November 11, 1969 resulted
In more legal action. Four
people who were selling Ptero<
dactyl in Cedar Falls, Iowa e
Krystyna Neuman, Kit Leder,
Jacob Margolan (then a Grin-
nell student). and a friend of
Margolan‘s from another colr
lege — were arrested under an
Iowa obscenity law which
makes it a felony to sell mate-
rial that is deemed obscene,

Those four people were are
i'aigned at that time in county
district court in Waterloo, Earr
lier this year it was thought
that the charges might be
dropped; however, a second ar-
raignment was held on March
30, and a trial date was set for
Krystyna Neul-nan and Kit
Leder for May 31, l970, and
for Margolan and the other de-
fendant at a later date. Krys-
tyna Neuman and Kit Leder
are apparently being singled
out for an earlier trial,‘ but it
is not known why.

In February of this year,
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna Neu»
man, and other East Street Gale
lery residents announced that
they were leaving Pterodactyl
for the present because other
staff members a they men-
tioned Bruce Nissen and Sally
Hamann — had imposed major-
ity rule, as opposed to the
”freedom of expression" prin-
ciple, as the rule for determin
ing what material should go
into Ptem. Wilhelm, Krystyna
Neuman and the others cons
cluded their statement with the
words “We will return Irom our
exile."

Shortly alter the Playboy
demonstration of F e b r u a r y,
1969. two students, Neil Fis-
cher and Gregg Schmidt, wrote
an editorial and read it over
KDIC radio which implied that
the demonstration was staged
by Wilhelm, with the idea that
he would be able to profit from
the sale of photographs of it.
After this editorial was broad-
cast, Mrs. Ruth Prescott of the
College at Information Servict
obtained the text of it and hac
copies made, which she sent to
the area news media under a
cover letter explaining, “We

On August 28, 1969, Wilhelm
Iiled a libel suit in Poweshiek
County District Court in Monte-
zuma alleging that because oi
distribution of that letter and
editorial, he was “exposed to
public hatred, contempt, and
ridicule" and suffered “irrep-
arable damage to l’IIS reputation
as a photographer," He named
Mrs. Prescott, President beg-
gett, Dean wall, Chairman oi
the Board of Trustees Robert
Noyce, Vice Chairman Ellen
Pray Maytag, and Treasurer
and Business Manager Donald
W, Lambic as defendants, and
asked for $20,000 general and
315,000 special damages. Late
last year, Wilhelm withdrew
the suit because of financial
problems in retaining legal
counsel; however, he intends to
rctile it as soon as he is able.

In November or last year
Wilhelm was charged with Vio-
lation of a Grinnell zoning ore
dinance which prohibited busi-
nesses in residentially zoned
areas, such as the section of
East Street where he lives. He
was tried and found guilty of
the charge in the court of Grin
nell Justice of the Peace Ed-
win Lincoln.

In that trial, the stais’s eVl
dence consisted of testimony by
Chief of Police Bill Peters and
Grinnell photographer Charles
Sumner, who had bought a photo
washer from Wilhelm, and a
picture of Wilhelm’s house
showing a sign with the words
“East Street Gallery” (having
a sign of a certain size or
larger constitutes a violation ol
the zoning ordinance). The (Ice
tense was represented by Law
hence Frank, who contended that
Wilhelm was not in violation ol
the sense of the zoning ordi-
nance, since none of his neigh-
bors were bothered, Frank said
in his closing statement
which Judge Lincoln later
called “a gem” — that the
charge ol violation of the zen
ing law constituted “a ludir
crous attempt on the part oi
citizens to harass Henry wn-
helm‘.”

Nevertheless, Wilhelm was
[ound guilty on the basis ol the
evidence, and he was fined $25.
Wilhelm intended to appeal the
case to district court in Monte:

zuma. but was unable to raise
the $200 necessary for an ap-
peal bond; therefore, he chose
to pay the penalty by going to
i ' where each day counts as
$3.33 towards the line. There
are those who think that
complaint against Wilhelm on
the basis ol the zoning law cons
stituted harassment by citi
zens 7 is possibly yustiiied.
Several people who are ac
quainted with the case indicated
to the 5&3 that pressure was
put on the Grinnell city council
to take action against Wilhelm
by citizens associated with a
beauty shop operator who had
been found guilty of the same
zoning 0 rd in a n c e several
months before Wilhelm’s case.
Furthermore. two sources, one
which is extremely reliable, ins
dicated that originally pressure
was put on the council to
charge the beauty shop operator
With violation of the ordinance
by one or more college protes-
sors who lived near the beauty
shop. It is, however, impossible
to ascertain with any degree oi
certainty what pressures, ii
any, were involved in the brings
ing of the charge against Wile
helm.

Last fall, after Freda Tepiel,
a former Grinnell student who
lived at the East Street Gallery,
was fired by the owner or a
cafe south of town, she and
Krystyna Neuman went to tall
to her former employer, Mr.
Gene McCurry. While McCurry
and Freda Tepier were talking,
Krystyna Neuman attempted to
take their picture. When he saw
this, according to Krystyna Neu~
man, McCurry went towards her
and he and an assistant grabbed
her camera. Subsequently. shs
filed a complaint against Mc»
Curry asking that he be charged
with assault and battery. Mce
Curry pied not guilty, and a
trial was held in Judge Line
coln's court.

After the first two witnesses
were called, however, Krystyna
Neuman withdrew her com-
plaint because she felt that the
county attorney, Michael Enich,
was not objecting to questions
from McCurry's attorney which
were irrelevant to the case r
lor example, questions about
where she lived. She feels that
Enich's less than vigorous hand-
ling of her case — which was
verified by the reports of others

— was the “grossest example oi
town justice" she has yet en-
countered. Enich told the 58:3
that he tried to do his best on
that case, as he does with all
cases. He said that he recom-
mended that she not file the
case, but that "it might have
been for their own particular
purposes,”

When asked by the 5&3 to
explain why he used the word
“they” when reterring to Krys-
tyna Neuman and the case he
had with her, County Attorney
Enich replied, “They always
travel in a group."

The third and final part of
this story will be published next

“lazy” and claiming that they

"don’t want to work.”
Peek said that a major reason

whites continue to dominate
blacks is that “blacks in high
positions had to prove themv
selves 'niggers' to get those
jobs.” He cited Senator Brooks
of Massachusetts as a nex-
ample. “Senator Brooke‘s cons
stituency is white and his fi-
nancial support is white. If he
goes against his support to
represent the black commtb
nity, he is doomed.”

“Integration of restrooms,
lunch counters, and other facil-
ities was a waste of energy be-
cause it didn't challenge the
social and political power struc-
ture. Integration is a smoke
screen.

”Race is the first thing which
Is determined; it cannot be
changed. Blacks have decided
to be black and to work from
there to assault the power
structure, It you are pro-black,
you don't have enough time to
spend on feelings like racism."

Sunday morning, the Rover
and Joseph H. Williams, guest
speaker, presented a sermon
on "Empty Seats ~ Missing
Brothers.” The Chicago Gos-
pel Ensemble provided music.

The Rev. Williams addressed
himself first to the black mar-
tyrs: ”A martyr is one who
would die rather than set aside
his convictions.” He presented
a long list of black martyrs of
all skin colors. asserting that
“blackness is not a matter of

skin color,
soul."

”The black community ought
to be concerned with black
martyrs because we are the
martyrs. Anyone who stands up
for humanizing people in this
society becomes a martyr.
When Martin Luther King, Jr.
started talking about power for
poor people, about ending the
war in Vietnam, he had to go."

"Racism is a sickness that
pervades America today. There
will be no liberation of black
folks until the middle~class
white folks are liberated. To
them, things are more impore
tant than people:"

Then the Rev. Williams dis-
cussed his maln point -— the
role black people should take
in their liberation movement:
“I'm tired of the statement
‘l'm ready to die.‘ There's too
much to be done. Those people
in the graveyard are no threat
to anyone. If you die while
working to help the commu-
nity, that’s different — you
don't have any control over
that."

The Rev. Williams directed
his conclusion to the black
members of the congregation.
“People don't have to worry
about two kinds of people —
those with no tools and those
who won’t use them. If you
don‘t go back to your commu-
nities and do more than you
could have without your edu-
cation, then you’re wasting
your time.”
