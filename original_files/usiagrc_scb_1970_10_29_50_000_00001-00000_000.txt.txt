Kimbo Describes Broodened Counseling Program

by Marilyn McKenna

Part I

Where is the counselingpros
gram at Grinnell headed? Ac
cording to Grinnell's Dean of
Students, Conney M. Kimbo,
the movement within the pro
gram now is toward providing
as much variety as possible
in the forms of counseling

, available, in order tomeet the
needs of individuals in a het-
erogeneous campus commun-
ity. This is the first ina series
of articles examining these
services and focusing on the
current developments which
will shape counseling at Grins
nell in the future.

Much of the current counsel»
ing activity is related to the
offices of the Deans of Studs
ents. Dean Kimbo, Associate
Dean Jean Hinds, and ASSlSt’
ant Dean Ric MacDowell are

all available to any student
who desires counseling orgui-
dance, although each does
work in separate as well as
interrelated areas.

Kimbo, a teacher for ten
years in the Gary, Indiana
public school system and cur
rently enrolled in a doctoral
program inadministration and
higher 611than at the Unis
versity of Iowa, is actively
involved in the development of
a variety of counseling servir
ces at Grinnell. He believes
it is necessary to have differ-
ent kinds of counselors be‘
cause a personality conflict
may not allow a student to
get the help he needs from a
particular counselor.

The resident-advising sysr
tem, under the guidance ofthe
Deans of Students, exempli-
fies the emphasis on variety.
Concerning selection of the

resident advisors for this
year, Kimbo says thata defr
inite effort was made to get a
well‘qualifled but varied
group of young, interested
people able to work with stud-
ents and relate to their needs.
They are to try, with the SEU'
dents, to improve the living
situations within the halls, not
through disciplinary tactics,
but through a loiowledge ofgr-
oup living. Mr. Kimbo sees
life within the halls and the
R.A.'s role as primary areas
for consideration andimproc
vement in the counseling pro-
gram.

Jean Hinds, Associate Dean,
received a Doctor of Educa-
tion degree in counselingpsys
chology at Columbia Univerr
sity and served as Associate
Director of the University Co-
unseling Service at Howard
University. She too believes in

Senate Raises Officers’ Salaries

by Don Dagenais \

Been to a movie in ARHlate-
ly7 Attended one or the fre~
quent rock concerts in North
Lounge? Listened to the cam-
pus radio smtion, or read an
issue of SStB’I Well,you better
have, because if you haven’t
your Manley is going down the
drain! very year $47 of you
or your parents’ hard earned
msh goes into the Student Gov-
ernment Association budget,
which is allotted bythe Fins
ance Committee to a number
of campus funds which cover
the activities just mentioned
plus many,more. During the
Senate meetings of October 5
and 6 the Senate, largely unr
noticed by the rest ofthe cam—
pus, approved a budget which
allocated $55,335 ofyour mon-
ey to the various funds.

Well over half the budget
(some $32,800) went into the
hands of the Social Coordinar
ting Committee, a group of

' seven salaried students (hea-
ded by Peter Keepnews)whose
job it is to decide what sort of
entertainment will be brought
to campus this year. Besides
$900 for salaries, money was
allotted for movies ($6050),
the Forum Coffee House
($300), small concerts
($4000), informal recreation
($400), and a general Social
Coordinating Fund ($1100).
The largest single chunk($20,
000) went into the Concerts
fund, headed by Concerts ch-
airman RonaldStanford, tobrr
ing to campus such entertain-
ers as the East River Anthor
logy and Big Mama Thornton.

The second largest area of
the budget was Publications
and Radio. KDIC received
$3300, $1800 of which is al»
lotted for the salaries of the
six members of the executive
board. The Scarlet and Black
received an appropriation of
$5500. $1000 of the Scarlet
and Black money is spent for
the salaries of the Editor and
Business Manager.

A tetal of $900 was approp-
riated for the Student Audits
or's office ($500 for the sal-

- ary of Student AudltOI’Rle
Deyo), and $2000 each for the

Speaker's Fund and the newly
created Senate Fund, a "last
chance" fund to which student
groups can apply for money if
their particular request does
not fit under the definition of
any of the other campus funds.
One of the major issues face
ing the Finance Committee
this year was the question of
whether or not the college
should allow student funds to
go for the purchasing ofliquor.
Last year virtually oneethird
of the Initiative Fund money
was spent for alcoholic beV’
erages. After considering the
legal and practical aspects of
the problem, the Finance
Committee voted lhatmoney it
appropriated would not be
spent for any alcoholic beve-
rages, this decision to be
enforced by the Student Audiv
tor, who will carefully scru-
tinize purchase receipts. With
this in mind, the Committee
allotted $4000 for the Initia~
,tive Fund, to be administered
by the Initiative Fund com*
mittee under previously'set
guidelines.

The nature of the Hall A1107
cation fund was changed this
year. Rather than being used
for the purchase ofhallnewsr
paper subscriptions, repairs
of hall damages, and new equr
ipment, the fund is now intend-
ed to be onlya source ofmoney,
for group hall activities, such
as hall parties, dances, etc.
$1800 was appropriated to be
divided among the various
halls. To cover the previous-
ly mentioned hall expendir
tures, a joint Council ofHouse
Presidents , Associated WoV
men Students fund was crea-
ted, to be administered by
both organizations. The total
was set at $1500.

$2535 was also allotted to
the Student Government Asso-
ciation itself, the 1arge part
of it ($2050) for salaries ofthe
various SGA officers. For se-
veral years the traditional
salaries of SGA officers had
been: $300 for SGA President;
$250 each for C of HP Presir
dent, AWS President, and Stu-
dent Coordinator; $200 for the
SGA Secretary; and $100 each

for two Student Coordinator
assistants. This year the Fin-
ance Committee felt that such
salaries were too low in view
of the level of some of the
other salariesaround campus,
specifically those of the SStB
Editor and Business Manager,
the Student Auditor, and the
executive board of the radio
station. The Finance Commit‘
tee recommended incrases
in SGA salaries to the folloWr
ing levels: $500 each for SGA
President and Student Coor-'
dinator, $300 each for the Cof
HP and AWS Presidents, $125
each for the Student Coordine
ator Assisnants, and the prev-
ious level of $200 for the SGA
Secretary.

tions to the student and points
out that this is the only way
to effectively fulfill individual
needs in many different coun-
seling situations. It is also
necessary, Miss Hinds feels,
to constantly reevaluate the
role of a clean in counseling
as well as in other areas, in
relationship to changes in cola
lege life.

Besides extensive work in
counseling in general, Miss
. Hinds is involved in the newly-

developed Career Planning
and Placement Center, oper-
ating from Room 14 in them-
sement of Hurling Library.
She works with Rosemary Ash,
Prudence Milite, and Steve
Mohr in counseling students
concerning theircareerplans.
The center also notifies stu-
dents of on- campus interviews

aduate schools, businesses,
industries, school systems,

' Wall Presents Tutorial Plan

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

The opening tone of this
week’s faculty differed from
the previous 8 meetings de-
voted to reform of academic
requirements for graduation.
In three speeches, it was

Students And Prols Cooperate

In lEAP Ant'

A step in the right direction
in the fight against local pol—
lution is Grinnell's iniZEIdlS’
ciplinary effort, the LEAP
program. This is a core grr
oup of 29 students and five
faculty from several depart-
ments who hope to develop a
package program to combat
pollution which could be of-
fered to other communities
similar to Grinnell.

The LEAP group was organ-
ized last springbutactivedata
gathering and study ofthe pro-
blems in Grinnell diantstart
until this fall. During the sum-
mer a small group ofstudents
and faculty worked on general
outlines for the program and
developed plans for itsactivi‘
ties. A rather extensive bib-
liography of information was
also compiled.

This semester is mainly cons
cerned with the work of data
githering, initial testing, and
analysis. Some ideas for re
cycling and pollution solutions
are alsobeing considered. The
second semester will be or-
iented more towards solving
some of the problems defined
during this fall's investiga-

Pollution Survey

tions. Action will be taken that
will include experimental re-
cycling and other plans. Dur~
ing the second semester es
pecially widespread campus
involvement will be essential
for the program's success.
Student interest and coopera-
tion so far have been very
good and its continuance will
be increasingly vital.

LEAP is composed of sev-
eral main groups each headed
by a faculty member and haw
ing several students as its
core. These groups are: the
solid wastes group headed by
Kenneth Christensen of the
biology department; the chef
mical waste group headed by
Gene Wubbles of the chemis-
try department; the ICE (in
ternal combustion engine)
team, headed by Steve Gold
and the Statistical analysis
and economics group headed
by Robert Voertman ofthe ec-
onomics department which
will study some of the econo-
mic problems of pollution. In
addition to these groups is the
publicity and coordinating
team (which oversees the

made clear that a consensus
to cut finally on some difui-
tive legislations was being
asked. Professor Erickson
formally withdrew hispending
proposal, saying that he felt
it had little chance of pass-
age, and that the faculty sh~
ould be looking for something
that it could pass.

Chairman Joseph Wall spoke
for some ten minutes, review
ing the course by which the
various faculty summer study
committee proposals were
disposed of, and noting the
modification in debate engen-
dered by a plethora of faculty
position papers. He empha-
sizes ”this is the time to
cut."

Mr. Clotfelter,whose earlier
proposal for the complete eliv
mination of requirements was
earlier defeated, rose to pro-
pose a new scheme, the floor
having beenvoidedby thewith-
drawal of the Erickson docu-
ment.

The text of the newproposal,
which appears under Dean
Wall‘s name, is as follows
(in abbreviated form).

1. That the faculty approve
of a Freshman Tutorial pro-
gram as the one college re-
quirement for the freshman
year. Each freshman would
be required to take a tutorial
during the first semester of
his freshman year. Eachfre-
shman would select or be as-
signed to a tutor, and each
tutor would be responsible for
no more than twelve students.
The tutor would ordinarily
serve as the student's under»
class academic advisor, until
such time as the student de-
