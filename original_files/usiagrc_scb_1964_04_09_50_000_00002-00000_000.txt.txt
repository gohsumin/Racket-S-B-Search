The two Mock Conventions being held this week
have involved the work of many students. This issue of
the S & B is an example. Initial planning for the issue
took place in January, assignments for copy were dis-
tributed in February and March, and the bulk of the
copy was in before Spring Vacation. Almost all of the
work has been done by Young Republicans and Young
Democrats who are in charge of some phase of prepara-

-tion for the convention. A special nod of thanks must
go to Tom Fullmer who was over-all supervisor of all

the material going into this

convention issue The date

of publication was advanced so that the paper would
reach the students just prior to the start of the conven-
tion. We would like to congratulate Mr. Gilmour, the
PPPE, and all of the students who have put so much
time and effort into the Mock Political Conventions,

and we would hope that all

students, whether they are

delegates or just observers, would take advantage of
this practical political experience.

 

Approval of Parly Plaiforms
Included in Mock Conventions

By Jack Spence

The Democratic platform
should receive attention un—
precedented in Grinnell Mock
Political Conventions. The ab-
sence of a raceJor the Presi-
dential nomination in the Dem-
ocratic Mock Convention will
permit more time for serious
consideration and debate on
the various planks of the plat-
form.

The Democratic platform
committee expects lively de-
bate on issues such as admis
sion of Red China to the Unit-
ed Nations, Civil Rights. aid to
parochial schools, and Viet
Nam.

Several contradictory goals
make the job of Writing a plat-
form for the Mock Convention
as difficult one. One goal is edu-
cational. The various subcomr
mittees do extensive research
and write planks over broad

‘- areas. But these planks must
also be limited by the time lim-
it considerations at the conven-
tion. Also, they must abandon,
to a certain extent, the schol-
arly approach in favor of a
more colorful presentation at
the convention, a presentation
which will Create interest, con-
ll'oversy, and debate.

The goals of the PPPE and
the Mock Convention indicate
that the process of debating the
platform and bargaining for
votes on various positions are
easily as important a function
as the educational function of.
researching and writing that
platform.

The Democratic platform will
be presented to the convention
Ind voted on Saturday after

 

noon.

By Tom Evans

Formed behind the slogan,
"Republicans Act.” the plat-
form for the Republican Mock
Convention will be presented at
the Republican platform ses-
sion tomorrow afternoon The
document begins by reaffirming
allegiance to the basic prin»
ciples of Republicanism: (l)
the importance of the individ-
ual, (2) equal rights and oppor-
tunities for all, (3) limited gov-
ernment, and (4) fiscal respon-
sibility.

With regard to areas of spe~
cific application, the platform
promises a much stronger and
more directed foreign policy
Republicans believe that the
prestige of tile United States
has fallen badly in the last
four years. They feel that inde-
cision and confusion can be
held mainly responsible for this
decline.

In the area fo civil rights.
Republicans point with pride to
the fact that all of the major
elements of the civil rights bill
passed in the House had been
first proposed in Republican
legislation. Recognizing the
need for even stronger action,
the Republican p arty has
pledged to move ahead in sec
curing equal rights and opporr
tunitles for all.

Action in domestic affairs
will center around a return to
fiscal responsibility and limited
government. It is a long-held
Republican View lhat ihe gov-
ernment’s initial responsibility
is to assure an economic envil'r
onment conducive to the growth
and strengthening of the free
enterprise system.

AGOP Comments on Issues; Wants
Equal Chance for Success for All

. By Phil Johnson

No man's freedom is secure
until all men are free. The goal
of the members of the Republie
can Party is to bring equal op-
portunity to every man. Not
every man wul succeed in all
of his aspirations in life, but
his success Or failure should
be the result of his personal
capacities as a man, not of a
repressive social system, of
legal restrictions, of a lack of
educational opportunities, or of
abject poverty. ~

Civil rights is the most urgent
issue in our domestic life. All
forms of racial discrimination
must be destroyed. Each indi»
vidual Is entitled to equal treatr
ment by all other Americans,
whether by government offi-
cials or by other citizens. He
should be able to vote, live
where he chooses, worklwherr
ever he is qualified, and use
any public facility on the same
basis as any other citizen.

The circle of poverty and
ignorance which binds so many
fellow Americans must be bro-
ken, Educational opportunities
must be provided to the capa-
ble but poor, Training and
placement aid must be extended
to those who do not presently
have the skills to participate
in modern industry. Depressed
areas must be helped back on
their feet, to enable them to
make positive contributions to
the nation.

Wherever possible, these mat-
ters should be dealt with by
local or state governments,
since the federal government is
notoriously inefficient and in-
flexible in operation. However
some states have refused to as-
sume th e i r responsibilities.
Some have themselves actively
violated the principles of equali-
ty which are the strength of our
society. In these cases, there is
no alternative but federal ace
lion,

 

 

In foreign policy, similar
principles apply. The develop-
ing nations should be aided in
reaching economic and political
growth and stability, to the
end that they will become
sound and autonomous citizens
of the world community.

Communism, as it Is pracA
ticed by the Soviet bloc, is a
direct antithesis of all princi-
ples of freedom, both for in-
dividuals and for nations. It
must be resisted actively on all
fronts.

Government itself must be
purged of ihe corruption re
vealed by the scandals of this
administration. The reaction-
aries and obstructionists now
controlling the Democratic
Congressional machine should
be replaced by men anxious to
serve the nation and the princi-
ples of equality which give it
strength.

It is to this end that the Re-
publican Party is dedicated in
1964.

 

Aim of Democrats to Continue.
And Expand Inaugurated Policy

By Marilyn Alt

At this time, the analysis of
campaign issues is difficult
and must be incomplete It
seems most wise to touch on
those issues which are cur»
rently receiving the attention
of the Democratic Party. The
aims of the Democratic pro»
gram are a continuation and
expansion of policies inaugur-
ated during the past four
years.

The tragic death of President
Kennedy in November was a
blow not only to Democrats,
but to the country and the
world. His youthful leadership
had brought a vigor to Ameri-
can politics which had not been
seen for many years. However,
the ascent of Lyndon Johnson
has brought few major
changes. President Johnson
has already demonstrated his
love for and ability in the game
of politics, his commitment to
the programs of President Kenr
nedy, and his willingness to
present policy changes of his
own.

lin‘the midst of plenty. Today
we have seen passed the most
sweeping tax cut in history, one
which will greatly increase
family income. Plans are also
formulated for a second tax cut.
another boost to the economy.
In addition, President Johnson
has moved to cut expenditures
in many other budgetary areas.
These are only examples of
continuing Democratic pro-
gress in the economic sphere.

The field of CiVil rights is
one of the most pressing lac»
ing the United States today.
Under strong Democratic leadr
ership, the past four years have
seen major steps taken in this
area. At present the sweeping
civil rights bill is on the verge
of passage and will be passed
before lhe Congress adjourns
this summer, Passage of this
bill is only a beginning. and
Democrats pledge their contin-
uing support to the fight for
equal rights for all citizens.

Of equal importance is the
current educational crisis. The
number of students pursuing a
higher education is increasing
each year. As the postwar ‘baby
boom' reaches college age, the
problem Will become even
more acute. The federal gov-
eminent niust be willing to
meeL lhls challenge. The last
session of
passage of the maiot ‘brick and
mortar' bill for construction of
higher educational facilities,
and an increase in funds avail-
able for Student loans. We
pledge our continuing suppon
to these and similar programs.

In the field of foreign affairs,
the Democratic Party pledges
its full support to the mainte~
nance of our position as leader
of the free world. In an age

 

Congress say the -

 

such as ours, foreign policy
must be one of strength with
an understanding of others
based u p o n humanitarian
ideals, A major milestone was
reached in the road to peace
with the negotiation and ratifi-
cation of the Test Ban Treaty
last fall. The initiation of the
Peace Corps during the last
four years has been another
major step.

There are many other areas
which are of major concern to
Democrats — unemployment,
medical care for the aged, agri-
cultural problems, to mention
just a few. The Democratic
Party pledges its full support
to continuing progress in all
of the above areas as we move
toward greater peace with
