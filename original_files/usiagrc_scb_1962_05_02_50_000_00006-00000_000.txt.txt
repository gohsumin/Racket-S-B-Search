The performances of the world's first 16-foot pole
vaulter, John Uelses, during the pzlst few weeks, includingl
his appearance at Drake, have brought to mind two obser—
vations concerning athletes inhis position.

The first is that once a man has reached a world re
cord status in no event, he can coast along (in this reput —
tion, continuing to get national publicity whether he pro—
duces up to the capacity he once did or not Since the
time of his record-smashing; leaps
meets in early March, Uelses has barely come within 6” of
his outstanding performances on any occasion since that
time.

However, we do not have the man himself to blame
for this, but rather, we should praise him for doing as well
as‘ he has while following-the tight schedule of mcct lifter
meet without let-up placed upon himi

Uelses worked many months to bring‘ himself to the
point of a world mark, but from then on, the demand for
him as a drawing card at relay meets throughout the coun—
try has undoubtedly kept him constantly on the move.
This brings me to my second point which is wondering how
he has had any time to practice specific parts of his vault
in order to remain at the high standard expected of him.

This lack of adequate practice time was probably on
important factor in his defeat zlt Drake last weekend by
George Davies, at top collegiate VilulLeL Last weekend also
produced the world’s second man to jump over 16 feet, a
fellow marine of Uelses’, Lanny Tork.

Now we must wait to discover if the new champion
will be able to hold up under the conditions that will sur-
round him, or if Uclsos will rise to the occasion and prove
his supremacy in the vaulting field by meeting zind defeat-
ing the new leader.
