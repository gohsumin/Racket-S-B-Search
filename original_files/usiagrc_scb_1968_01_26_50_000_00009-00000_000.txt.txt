INTRODUCING PAT OLIPHANT

By NEIL FISCHER

Pat Ollplnnt 10013 like the little penguin (or whatever it is)
that ornnlpresently can be iound making snide comments in the
corner or an Olipilant cartoon. ,. ,

The first time I snw hint waddiing around the DENVER
POST‘S news room, I knew exactly who he was.

I was I copyboy at the time, and the capyboys worked in n
narrow room lined with wail<to-wall ieletypes from sundry wire

services. It hadn‘t been but a

year since Oliphant had won

his Pulitzer Prize, and he must

‘have been feeling pretty pres-
‘ tlgious.

Rumor was rampant among
the stair — especially the copy-
buys.

“He comes in here and reads
a little wire copy. Gets him
ideas,” alleged one of my com-
rades.

“Then he goes into his office,
does his cartoon in live min-
utes, and stares at the wall for
the rest of the day. i seen him.
He‘s weird."

Well, he isn’t weird. really.
He's just good.

And alter looking for l car-
toonist on campus for over a
year and seeing none, i decided
to go prolcsslonal and buy him
(or my semester on the soil.
'The L05 ANGELES TIMES Syndicate sold him (that is, his

cartoons) to us, Ind I want you all to know he’s damn expensive.
it you scanned his cartoons this week, you know he's good, so
we won't go into that anymore.

- Ollphnnt was already it cartoonist of note when he moved from
South Australia to the United States in 1964. in 1958 he won one of
“IE top two prizes in London‘s “Great Challenge Editorial Cartoon
Competition," an international contest designed to find the lun-
niest editorial artist in the world. All Westem naiinns were rel)
resented in the competition, and Olipliant represented the ADE-
LAlDE (Australia) ADVERTISER

The 29-year~old artist replaced Paul Conrad as cartoonist-in-
residence at the DENVER (Colorado) POST in 1964. In 1966 he
won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Sigma Delta Chi award {or
editorial cartooning.

Olipham still retains his Australian accenl, but his point of
view is strictly American His cartoons are syndicated to over ion
newspapers across the u.sr Most journalists l’ve talked to think
he’s the host American cartoonist tor editorial work next to
Conrail."

conrad appears in THE DES MOINES REGISTER.

The hasis ct Ollphant‘s cartoon is, simply, humor. “In those
instances where a particularly grim subject might indicate a
straight approach," he believes, “the contrast that humor artortis
thrusts the message home with ircsh impact."

Take a look at the Oliphant editorial cartoons in this issue of
the Sim. And then make it a hahit to regulariy enjoy this bright
new work in the oldest college newspaper West of the Mississippi.
