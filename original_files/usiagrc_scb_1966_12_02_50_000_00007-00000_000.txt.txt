Smylie: ‘Reiurn lo Traditions'

By DON Wl'NNEY

Last Friday evening Gover-
nor Robert E. Smylie of idaha
supported the concept of the
Heller plan, which would turn
federal ilunds over to the states
ior their own use. Speaking in
the South Lounge at the annual
PPPE political lectureship,
Smylie also said the 1966 elec-
tion “marked a return in the
great centrist traditions oi the
Republic and a decision to con-
solidate the gains which the na-
tion has made and pericct the
administrative techniques by
which those gains will be pre-
served.

Because of the lack of indi-
v‘d 1, local, and state respon-
s ty, Smylie said, there has
been a great administrative
shift to the lederal government
tor solving social problems The
elecliun shows, however, that
“the American people are will<
ing to measure up to the re
sponsibility at doing things ror
themselves.” Rejecting the
view that states are archaic, he
said, “the preservation of that
system or checks and balances
between hometown and national
capital is ﬁnally and under-
standably important to the
preservation of individual hu-
man rights.”

"The existing areas oi po<
litical aciion,” Smylie said,
“with great new opportunities
ior boldness and creativity
and innovation, will be found
more and more at the state
level. The question heiore us
is whether or not stale and
local governments can keep
abreast of the changing times
and take Ihe lead in solving
these problems.”

That the states have not done
so in the past, Smylie said, is
partly because of malappor-
.ioned legislatures, a problem
idat is currently being solved
.n the courts. it is also because
or the state's inabi 'ty to raise

revenue. The expenditures of
state and local government, he
said, were six tima greater in
’65 Lhan in '47, but the inability
to raise the required revenue
has created a squeeze Federal
grants in aid have too oiten
wasted money on outdated op-
erations. Smylie hoped that the
problem would be solved by a
plan to tunnel iederal iunds in-
to the states With no strings al-
iached.

Finally, Smylie hoped tor the
Republican party to revitalize
the federal system. He warned
the party not “to interpret the
election as a mandate to turn
backward . . . The Republican
opportunity now is to seize the
initiative in structural political
thinking and build a positive
image of periormance {or the
party.

"The election was very ob<
viously an endorsement of a
greater and more positive role
ior stats and local governments
and for private enterprise in
combating the country’s ills."

lion. Aiter the Wednesday
meeting Morton told the 5&3:
“Under present policies or the
Board of Publications (corrr
posed oi live faculty and tour
student members, Mr. Henry-
York Steiner, Chairman) I find
it impossible to iulilll both my
responsibilities as an editor and
as a student.” Morton said she
had been working on getting
some sort of a system of in—
dependent academic credit set
up that could work in cunjllnc~
tion with the yearbook editor-
ship so as to reduce the numv
her of courses she would have
to take while working on the
book. She told the 58d}: “1
brought the subject up (at the
Board meeting) about a month
ago, but Steiner tabled it until
a committee could he formed
to study the problem (a com-
mittee has not yet been estab-
lished). if a system were to be
instituted i might consider tak-
ing the job on again.”

One of the coeditors oi the
"66 yearbook (which is sche~
duled to come out in January),
John Phillips, was not permit
led to return to Grinnell this
year because oi academic rea-
sons.

The Board noted there has
been a shortage of applications
for the position of Cyclone edi-
tor in the past iew years and at
the present time no one has
been found to take over work
on the ’67 book.

Morton commented that “The
Cyclone is dead, but there is
still some chance oi some sort
of a book of pictures if some-
one will do it. There is no staff
now.” Morton told the Board

tips will hurt the students, who
presumably want the best edu~

a hurt that will not show up in
any immediate or dramatic way,
and so, like victims of cancer,
the students will think or them-
selves as not damaged. Those

To the Editor:

Last year i spent my junior
year abroad studying in an

nglish university and since my
return i have maintained a
correspondence with many oi
the iriends that 1 made, both
students and iacnlty. Today I
was thinking how 1 could possia
bly explain to them the rsti n.
ale employed in the suspending
oi three students for “illegal
visitation" or the action that
the Coin? and AWS Boards
were iorccd to take.

1 decided that my task was
an impossible one, since the
rules at the university i at
tended were conspicuous only
by their absence. it is my lirm
heliel that this is the most
successiul system for o coni-
miiiiily oi the Grinnell type to
emulate (i. c, ii it must emur
late and not lead). with a one
hesive community oi our type
the sole ‘rulc’ that must be
kept in mind is that one in-
dividual has no right to in-

ft
that money will be reiunded to
those who have bought subscrip-
tions to the cook. The other ﬁ-
nancial losses incurred this year
will be coveied by a “sinking
iund” made up oi previous
yearbooks’ profits and by the lst
semester contribution from
SGA. Any losses that remain
will be covered by profits from
the ’66 yearbook alter it is is-
suedi Sales for the ’65 yearbook
will be reopened in January's
The Board also approved
Suzanne Gelber as editor of the
5&3 tor the term beginning
next semester. Ameil Fisher
also applied for editor. Henry
Wilhelm, who had previously
applied [or the 5&8 editorship,
was judged “acceptable” by the
Board but was not approved
because oi a ruling or “aca»
demic ineligibility” by Tile Com—
mittee on Academic Standing.
Gelher told the Board she
wants to make the 58:3 “more
oi a journal” with an increase
or “in-depth“ reporting. Slie air
so plans to reorganize the staii
to Create a wider distribution at
responsibility and work.

HANSEN S

iringe on the rights oi othe
The role punishment that t a
college should dispense tor oth
er than academic ottenses II
when an individual is negligent
in respecting the basic rights
or another.

it seems to me that under
this basic type oi system no
restrictions can be justiiied on
such things as women’s hours,
visitation, etc Restrictions such
as these indicate that the col-
lege ieels students are incap-
able at regulating their own
lives. This is t talse presump-
tion; I have icon that an ab-
some at rules leads neither to
chaos nor to anarchy.

What 1 am advocating should
not be constmed as complete
indiiierences by the college to
the nonacademic weliare of the
student. on the contrary, I
think that the college has a
very valid role to play here,
but it is a role that the col-
lege has been lax in periorming.
The college should oiler moral
guidance to students in the
term of a sex education pro.
gram and in the iorm oi trained
counsellors. This is a tar more
positive, useiul, and construe
Live role tor the college to play
than its present method oi at-
tempting to guide students
morally through coercion.

I believe that the student
body wants tacts and guidance,
but as mature, intelligent indi-
viduals the students reject the
very idea oi compulsion in their
liveshivhen this compulsion
delves into matters that ariect
no one but the individuals in
volved.

in a sense 1 think the col-
lege has not us yet completely
committed itseli to a coercive
in loco parentis concept. Thus
the college is tree to lead the
way in assuming the proper
role oi a guiding in loco paren-
