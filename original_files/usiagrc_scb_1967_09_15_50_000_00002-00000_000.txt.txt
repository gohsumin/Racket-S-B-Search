THE COLLEGE CABIN

The college cabin at Rock Creek is being sold. The state Wants
ID expand the facilities at the State Park, and is in the process of
purchasing the land owned by the college

The loss of the Cabin is unfortunate for Grinnell students. Al-
Ihough the steep and often muddy path from the road and the
outmoded restroom facilities detracted somewhat from the cabin’s
popularity, it provided on adequate shelter, privacy. and — most
important —- was privately owned. '

The State Park closes at 10:30 pm, and imposes restrictions
on cooking ﬁres. Other parks with adequate shelters and cooking
iaciliiies are at a iinancially prohibitive distance for casual use.

There are two questions arising from the coming sale of the
cabin. Since the sale is not even near the final stages, why can’t
we use the Cabin this Fall? Lee Arbetman, North Campus Social
Chairman, was told by Dean Winters that the Cabin was in need
of repair. We were told last Fall that the cabin was in need of
repair, yet it was used. Arbetman oliered in help pay for repairs
from the social fund, but Winters said the cabin was closed pezu
manently.

The second question involves the future of oiiscampus property
for social programming. According to Mr. Lambie, business mana-
ger of the college, there has been no discussion of purchasing any
property to replace Lake Acre.

Loss of the cabin Is a further restriction on already limited op-
portunities ior social activities. Failure to secure a new location
for an off»calnpus cabin would be unlorgivable.

REVOLUTION

The September Revolution was shortliveo. Worried house
Iimsidenls stood before their restless flocks, and explained that
‘Leggett was ready ID let It third of the faculty and twothirds of
the students go" in order to maintain the supremacy of the rule:
over upstart students.

The masses were lulled. A catalog of possible college improve—
ments was read at Wednesday’s open Senate meeting by Ric
MacDowell. At that same meeting, Chairman of the Faculty Wall
[aid that the Curriculum Committee repon should reach the stu-
dents in November.

The activists returned to the underground, Part of their work
had been successiul. The idea of revolution had been instilled
upon the minds or the members or the college community.

Few of us would welcome an open revolution and its necessary
repercussions; however, even fewer of us are satisfied with cola
iege social regulations as they stand now. Somewhere between
revolution and maintaining the status quo lies the desirable course
for liberalization. IT We really believe that social rules change is
important, let us not be timid about steering closer to the former.

THE STUDENT HANDBOOK

i got out my Student Handbook the other day. I wanted to
brush up on regulations covering Sunday aiternoon open house.

I was rather surprised to iind that the page designated for
this topic in the Table of Contents was blank.

Looking through the handbook, I noticed a total of four blank
pages. included among the topics to be covered were open house
regulations and the Preamble to the SGA Constitution .

Was this some colossal printing error that went unnoticed, or
did it happen only in my copy?

or aren‘t there any open dorm rules this year?

LONELINESS

To the Editor:

Although back as a senior, i
must suggest after only a week
oi’ encountering a raw hardened
Grinnellians ( h I I sometimes
"aloneness" is cultivated by
the Grinnell student as a lign
of his tough individuality, his
lack of Med for others not like
himself.

Appreciation of variety, par-
ticularly of personal types,
often seems lacking, sometimes
causing paintul hardness and
discourtesies. In turn, these
conditions make “aloneness” a
necessity for some.

I miss my individualistic and
liberal friends the one
who stressed kindness. the one
who admired the courage of
Grinnell's not so well accepted
who looked for the beauty, dig-
nily, humor, irony, and variety
in life, and the one whose cro-
ntive endeavors were visited
upon others. Example can be
tound in the remaining human-
Ists.

Hopefully, Grinnell will not
become a boring, humorless
haven of recluses who come out
only to serve popular causesl
T h e n interpersonal respect
might approach the level of aha
stract social concern on our
campus.

FISCHER’S COLUMN

To The Editor:

Mr. Neil Fischer’s column in
the last issue seemed to me
worthy of comment. As I recall,
last year the student leaders
announced that it was sufficient
to abolish women’s hours at
once; any problems arising from
that action could be taken care
of afterwards with no inconveni-
once.

It would appear that Mr,
Fischer is beginning to See what
others, myself included, argued
all last year — that the action
was too hasty and that inade«
quate planning had been done.

May 1 say that i was struck
by the maturity of Mr. Fischer’s
solution? He writes, ”Get angry,
and tell them what you want."
I believe that the technical name
for such behavior is “tantrum."

QUIET IN
THE LIBRARY

To Tile Editor:

Libraries are traditionally
places in which the maintenance
of quiet is almost religiously ob-
served. The Students here at
Grinnell have found that this il
one tradition worth savmgr Even
during the peak evening study
hours, when hundreds of stir
dents paclt the reading room
and other study areas, there
can be heard only an occasional
murmured conversation.

It is quite distressing, then,
that during the day there are
voices that echo throughout the
library I, and probably many
or my fellow students, would
appreciate from Mn Alden and
the library sialf the same re<
spect and consideration for the
study habits of others that most
Students are careful to observe.

PRAYERS AT OIIAD DINNER'
ARE THEY} NECESSARY?

By DON HECKER

One of the last vestiges of
Grinnell College’s past as a
churchrsponsored institution can
still be seen every night at
5:40 at the Quad. it is
the custom or singing a short
grace before the regular sit-
down dinner,

The singing of grace at the
Quad is, according to Dean
Low, “merely a tradition train
the past.” “This type of cere-
mony is characteristic of pri-
vatelyrowned liberal arts cob
ieges," she explained

She believes the singing or
grace adds to line total atmos-
phere at traditional, gracious
dining.

Last year, South Campus voted
to retain the custom.

One Read junior stated that
she was under the impression
that most people were indiiter-
ent or opposed to the prayers.
She assumed that they would
be discontinued in a few weeks.

For herself, she said: “I feel

that I am singing a solo every
time."

Another girl commented that
It seemed that her friends could
never get through prayers With-
out giggling.

Althuugh there seems to in

little enthusiastic support for
the prayers, Dean low indicated
that she had received no air
jections, and that therelore
there has been no thought to
discontinuing the grace.

At least one of the prayers
is theologically unacceptable to
religious groups that do not ac<
cept the trinitarian doctrine. it is
also opposed to the belicls of
any taith that does not accept
the doctrine of forcing their
beliefs on the general public,
and all noanesiern religions.

Dean Low explained that stu-
dents have a choice, and do
not have to attend sit-down
dinner, but suggested that per
sons who might have Io attend
could only stand silently.

The Quad custom is not com-
parahle to the arrangement at
Cowles, where only a moment
of silence is observed at sil-
downs. The Cowies system al-
lows for wide religious divers-

ity.
