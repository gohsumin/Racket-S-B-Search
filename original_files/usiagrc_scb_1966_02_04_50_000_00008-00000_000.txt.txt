Mendel, and Jeff Patterson scored

pinning. Gary wilson drew with
his opponent while Bill Barnes and
Ken Strublel‘ won by forfeit.

The 53-0 score against lowa
Wesleyan was the highest ever Ill
Pioneer wrestling and only 2
points from a periect mark. The
results need some qualiilcation,
however. as Grinnell received six
forleits. Four of the other five
matches were pins by Barnes,
Strubler, Richman, and Sharpe;
Martinson won by a 5-2 decision.
Ricllman scored the quickest fall

his second match in 1:30 and Pat-
terson in 1:45 against his Knox op-
ponent.

Record-Breaking Ways

Frantz cracked the record early
in the second half, collecting points
number 1,104 and 1,105 on a 25sl00t
jump shot. He added 1|) more the
rest of the game.

With 11 games still to play this
campaign, the Pioneer cocaptain
should be able to raise the mark
to the vicinity of 1,350.

Earlier in his Seyear career
(freshmen do not compete in var-
sity sports), Jeff wrote school
records (or most points in a sea«
son (509), best season average
(23.1), most field goals in a season
(208), most points in a game (46),
and most field goals in a game
(22).

His 391 points as a sophomore
also established a new standard.

In addition to his prolific scor-
ing, Frantz ranks as one or Grin-
nell's all-time top l'ebounders, 512

trial for us."

The Pioneers used only two sub-
stitutes in the whole game and
neither or them scored. Along with
Frantz, three others reached dou-
ble figures. They were forwards
Ted Risser and Tom Hill and guard
Elliott Hibbs.

The leading scorers for Augus-
tana were Gordon Kinkead with 14
and freshman Steve Snow with 17.
Another freshman Bob Hogdon
notched 10 and barely missed a
last-second shot to tie the game.

Defense remains the Pioneers’
number one problem, according to
the coach,

“We didn’t play well defensively
against Augustana," he declared.
“We had too many lapses, includ-
ing a very bad one at the end.
Several times we got ahead by
six or seven points and then let
Augustana catch up because our
defense faltered."

Pfitsch will stick with the start-
ing lineup he has used the last
three games —- Ted Risser and
Tom Hill at forward, Frantz at
center, and Elliott Hibbs and Mike
Schwartz at guard.

All tive are averaging in double
tigures for the three games they
