Thuisday night the title or his
talk was "Can a Liberal Reli-
gion Help to Build a Sane So-
cietyl"

Dr. Fritchmau tirst dciincd rc—
ligion as tlmt-wliicli'“iiian cone
siders his ultimate concern and
his relationship to it" when
‘speaking of his optimism tor
man’s progless' m ,vorkmg eii
'ifectivcly ior his ultimate con-
cern he said, “man may not be
perfeciable; neither is he mcoi»
riglble" Stressing the iinpol‘-,
tance oi individual integrity in
the construction of a good so~
cicty, Dr, Fritchman quoted‘

“Only when theii
pr ate motives lead men to
seek public good can men live
in a good society”

 

in today’s world he tools that
the liberal religions are doing
ithc best job in giving "a (limelr
sion oi depth" to people‘s lives;
Dr. Fritchmaii listed iour quills
liLlCS to 'describc a liberal rec
ligion: 1) reverence ior me; 2)
belief in the “value or human
‘inquii-y“; 3) ”a moral obligation,

Fritcliman criticized organ

concern here on earth" He
considered “morality more
important than dogma" when
speaking at the denomination»

United states'today.

He charged that churches had'
become “lost in red tape," and
that theyhad “lost the ability
to criticize thegovcrninent." He
claimed that “Churches are cap-
tive and must use secular voices
to speak." Finally, Dr. Fritclr
nian aiiirmcd that today “rec
ligion can and must do more to
involve man in the struggle to‘
keep human dignity alive."
-“Thc endemic sickness of the
