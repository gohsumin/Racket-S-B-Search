”: Quartet Plays Brahms, Beethoven, Goren

By Karen Adkinson

A quartet is a handy thing.
It can play not only chamber
music hut also bridge,

“Going through Nebraska on
a train we can get in tour or
ﬁve rubbers".remarked Pater
Marsh, ﬁrst violinist ot the
LCnox Quartet.

The Lenox String Quartet has
returned tor i second year or
resdeney at Grilmcli.

"When we came last year." i
explained Dnniilli McCall, cel—
iist, "we didn’t expect to be
here just one year. A position
of artistina-esidencc usually
implies a tcniire oi some
length. Besides. we came back ,
because we like it here."

This summer the Lenox quar
tet spent nine weeks in rcsi
dcncc at the Aspen Music Fes ‘
tival and School of Music. As
well as performing, the quartet _
coached a dozen sti ig quartets.
Prior to their Aspen engagement
they gave several summer con.
certs in San Francisco sponsor-
ed by Mills College and the San
Francisco Museum of Art.

Over the summer the quartet
made major changcid newt

made in 1635 by Amati, maste
to Stradivarius Before its our-i
chase, the instrument was check.
ed to insure that it blended;
with the other instruments in last Saturday-

Besides their ser-ics oi pei‘a

quartet is teaching the two secs

Arts (music). plus a course on

l reii-eshing to teach. The un»
sophisticated comments oi the
intro stiiilans are often quite
striking.”

Just before Monday dragged'mlo Tuesday, I got a chain and
1 set it down in the TV. room in the (we should be so lucky)
union and waited tor the crowd to gather. And did it gather.
Our common bond was that we were appreciators oi the Kliar

Coutry Music Show out of Cedar Rapids. The show was spon—
sored by a hog feed company, and all the aspiring young wits

look it to task. Whal that show was was "Iowa" with double quoicsl

and a squiggly underline, and we were laughing. We laughed
at hogs feeding, and we laughcd at all the itiniiy strange words
and the funny people, Iias\I-Ias. 1 got a picturc or all the peace
corps guys in one country in deepest, darkest Africa meeting
in a small smokesillled room and laughing at the funny "nae
lives." 1 got a' picture of a bunch ot American students at the
Sorhonne getting together at a little “we serve American food
here” sale and laughing at the stupid French.

Now titre are undoubtedly twenty-seven hundred and three
real reasons why we laughted. And every time 1 wave a torch
