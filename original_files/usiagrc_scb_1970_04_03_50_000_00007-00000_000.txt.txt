yearbook, altllough unavoidable
trom the college’s standpoint,
was unfortunate because it
deprived the community ot what
was a new, creative kind of year-
book and because it alienated
Wilhelm from the college. To
others, the controversy was not
only untortunate [or the college
and its image and Wilhelm but
itwas also unnecessary.

Willlelm thought that libel was
not really an issue in the year
book controversy; the lawyer
that he retained at this time was
or the opinion that there was no
libel in the yearbook. In Wil~
helm’s mind, it was a case of
censorship by President Leggett,
since the yearbook was, ac-
cording to Wilhelm, “critical of
Leggett personally,” and
because it. presented an “ab

iectlve, complete report oi the
college that wasn't quite with the
public relations image or the
college.” The college's action
then, Wilhelm. says, was “an
absolute smear to try to save its
own reputation, and absolutely
despicable."

There are apparently many
faculty now who, looking back on
the situation in 1967, would agree
with Wilhelm that the yearbook
should have been published as
Wilhelm made it originally.
These faculty members and
Wilhelm seem to think that, if
the same kind oi situation oc
curred today, the college would
be forced to act diiterently. Then,
however, the ﬁblications

less assertive ottheir own powers

important, the college was much
more sensitive to the drug

seems to be a good deal of
popular misconception as to what
this committee is really supposed
to be. Is it a “student power

proposal lies, in my opinion, in
this discrepancy between the
committee's purported tunction,
