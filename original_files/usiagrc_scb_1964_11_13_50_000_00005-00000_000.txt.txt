band was also arrested {or run-
ning an unlicensed garage and
stealing electricity (he was fix-
ing a COFO car in the front
yard underneath a tree). The
trial was set for 2 pm. the next
clay. and was held at 10 am.
without his lawyer present, and
he was convicted. He was sen~
tenced to jail plus receiving a
$1,500 fine. When Mrs. Dillon
tried to pay the fine, it was
raised to $2,000. In addition,
Mrsl Dillon had been‘iurther
threatened by the police offi-
cers. (The Di‘llons have two
small children) Her life had
been further threatened for go-
ing to Washington

That night I was taken to her
home in the dark As soon as
I entered the home all the
blinds and the curtains were
pinned tightly shut. This was to
serve a dual purpose: (1)50
no one could see a white per-
son in the house, and (2) so
no one could see accurately to
shoot. That was the situation.
Within that framework of refer-
ence the atmosphere was rath~
er jovial because of me moth-
er’s return and the fact that the
children were safe. What cour-
age these people have!!i! Dur-
ing the night Mrs. Dillon and
I shared the guard duty. Just
as she and I sat with pistols
on our laps, so also were people
in houses across the street and
on either side of us. We all
were waiting for one of the con-
stantly cruising police cars. or
cars with unidentified white
men in them to stop, light a
fuse, and throw a bomb. As I
Write this 1 can again feel
that gripping, tense feeling of
fear that was constantly in the
pit of my stomach all that
night. I can only ask how can
people live day after day in
such a situation? And why do
we allow, so passively, this to
continue???? Who are We
(Americans) anyway? Why do
we allow this to continue? What
is so vital to us that we remain
so unabashed to such events?

members of the Ku Klux Klan,
even the Grand Wizard him—
self, circled around and around
the Freedom House from 1 a.ml
until 5 am. The problem was,
they had heard more white wo-
men were coming in to work
ilhat night.

Now that I am becoming
emotionlly involved in what I
am writing, let me attempt to
attain more distance on the
subject and describe some of
the other things we did

Note: The Negro community
as yet does not shoot to kill,
but how long we whites expect
the violence to be only on our
side is a question we ought to
ask ourselves.

The next days were spent in
advem'sing a mass rally that
COFO was holding to try to
build the morale of the com-
munity. The closer the day of
the rally approached the more
police cars that followed us. On
the afternoon of the rally two

 

policemen spent much of their
time following me from door to
door, I took to waving (refrain-
ing from saying, “Freedom,
now”), but they did not seem
to notice. . . . .

All I can keep reiterating is
the tremendous courage these
people have. They are willing
in risk meir lives for some
semblance of freedom. As one
of the other women who went
to Washington said at the rally
— “it’s not hard to be brave,
but it sure is hard -m be
scared." How about us???”
It’s so easy to escape hack into
