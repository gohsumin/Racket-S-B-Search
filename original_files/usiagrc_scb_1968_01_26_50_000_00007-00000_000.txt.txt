SCARLET AND BLACK

SEW“.

By FRITZ SCHWALLER

In truth the book store is a
ﬁne place in which to purchase.
Spanish dictionaries cost less
there than in Mexico; Harper
Torchbouks are sold at list and
all defective copies are “ex<
changed for perfect copies
without penalty,"

But even though the prices

‘ are those which are suggested
by the companies and the es-
tablishment offers many sun<
dry commodities at equally

_‘ reasonable prices, all is not
Well.

It is the nature of a student
to be overly concerned about
seemingly trivial matters, Yet
the fact remains that certain
institutions Contact us daily,

It is in these routine contacts
that such trivium becomes elk
oeedingly bothersome.

I take as examples two ag-
‘gravating policies of our book
store. The ﬁrst of these is the
insistence upon checking one‘s
name against the role of stu-

ttdEI‘ILS each and every time one
attempts to cash a check. re<
gardlcss of the fact that one
has been there three times al«

'ready that day tor a similar

‘ service, And regardless of the

:fact that one‘s name is printed
on the check with the following
notice: “Grinnell College, Grin-
neli, Iowa, 50112."

The second of these trivial
complaints become much less
trivial and much more impor-
tant the more often it occurs,
The practice in question is that
oi placing a gooey price stick~
er on the cover of each and
every "text" book sold.

The reasoning behind this
practice is clear: so that the
book store will know which
books not to accept for refund,
such as those not sold by them
or sold by them in a previous
semester, The only justification
for placing this sticker on the
cover, as opposed to some-
where else, is to facilitate
pricing-unpacking and check-
out.

But the implications of this
practice to the student are
much greater in scope, This
practice means that all Chem-
istry majors will, for the rest
of their careers, have eimer a
white blotch or a sticky blotch

on their $13.95 Organic Chem- ,

istry hardbouud.

Or that the Spanish majors
will have is ripped spot, where
they had attempted to tear off
the sticker on his copy of The
Generation of 1m paperback.
One can see that this practice
affects the purchaser of paper-
backs and hardbounds who
might want to sell them later.
The crime comes in relation to
u really high quality hardbound
or paperback that is or a type
~that would be kept. This in~
eludes any number of antholo-
gies, science texts. history vol-
umes, and “table top” art
books.

The answer is simple. Put
the sticker on the inner tly
leaf. This is easily accessible
both while unpacking books
and while checking them out.
It offers the advantage of be
ing in a little noticed spot in
a hook, Once the book is pur-
chased the sticker would be in
a location that can be covered
by an "ex lihris."

SLOBS SMOKE GRASS

Compiled from ACP Dispatches
University of North Carolona,
Dec. 2t (ACP)—- “The hippies
are terribly, terribly innocent.
They could have inﬂuence, but
they were defeated by the in-
troduction of drugs."

Dr. Morris Lipton or North
Carolina Memorial Hospital,
who spent the summer in San
Francisco’s Haight—Ashbury dis-
trict, told a coffee-house au-
dience that the flower children
brought on their own destruc-
tion in the form of LSD.

Lipton characterized the hip-
pie movement as “a sweet,
laudable thing.” He called the
movement a reaction to the
materialism oi the Protestant
ethic and middle class values
The hippies, he said, are faced
with an acute conflict between
internal and external controls—
the demands of conscience and
those of society.

Discussing the physiological
effects of LSD, Lipton avowed:
“A! a chemical expert. i can
say that anyone who stays on
acid rain“ or five years ends up
in the nuthouse—penunnentiy."

LSD interferes with the trans-
mission of nervous impulses be-
tween nerve endings, distorts
the signals sent into the central
nervous system, and causes un»

natural responses, the psychia-
trist said.

Continual use, he explained,
ultimately affects the nervous
system‘s “wiring" and drug
users wind up having psyche-
delic experiences without taking
the drug.

Lipton added that drug users
often show schizoid tendencies.

“Chronic marijuana users
eventually become slobs, too,”
he added.

He said he had taken a trip
himself under laboratory coir
diliDnS.

“Oh, it was fun all right," he
commented. ‘l've had LSD and
undergone psychoanalysis. I
found the latter a more reward~
ing experience.”

column, appearing on page
seven is set in SMOKE type
face. Popular In the 1840's,
this style is generally used
sparingly on experimental
columns.

Those of you who bemoan the fact that Grinnell hosts very
few genuinely formal events can rejoice. The greater portion of
this weekend will offer you a chance to unpack those cocktail
dresses delicately wrapped in tissue paper.

Besides that, guys who usually find it diiiicult to iabrlcato
suitable entertainment for dates on one of Gi‘innell’s notably stag-
nant weekends will discover that this North Campus Weekend will
proffer amusements diversified from Baroque to jazz music, from
candlelight in Cowles to red checked tablecloths in the Forum
Grill and Julie Christie in ARH.

A slight discrepancy in the promotion of this year's North
Campus Weekend reveals its actual misnomer; most of the social
events will be held on Central Campus.

Be assured, however, that given the chance to display her very
best iinery in the Grinnell tradition, one may find Central Campus
fashionably attired.

if you're longing for the atmosphere which one finds only in n
nightclub, Friday night may try you in South Lounge from 9 'til
midnight where an Old Town group, the Oscar Lindsay Trio, in
the Ramsey Lewis tradition will be performing for a “dithyramh”
ushering in the iormal weekend. The Trio, fresh tiom an engage-
ment at the Midas Touch in Chicago. should provide some fabuloul
evening entertainment,

Substituting for Booker T, and the MG: Saturday night will
be the fantastic rock group, the Ides of March. The Booker T.
Group, cancelled because oi the marriage oi their drummer, will
be here for a concert on the “lb of February,

For those of you who thrive on the old-fashioned movie date,
Friday night WIll also host the first showing of Billie Liar, a recent
movie starring Julie Christie. This intriguing flick will begin at a
pm in ARH and a repeat showing will be held Sunday at 9:30,

A formal candlelight dinner date in Cowles will initiate the
events of Saturday night. The steak dinner will be served formal-
ly from 6 to 6:45 pm. and is expected to end by 7: (it). Remember,
guys, that you must turn in meal tickets for you and your date to
your nail Social Chairmen. Lounge parties will be iound in every
hall on North Campus swinging imm 7 until it pan. accompanied
by open dorms from 8 to 10 p.m.

At 8 pm. the long-haired crowd will find the Chamhre Orchw
tra, the Grinnell College Choir and the Lenox Quartet presenting A
concert in Robert’s Theatre. The evening’s program will include
one of the Bradenburg Concern and a cnntata hy Purcell.

At 10 pm. couples can gyrate to the heat sound of the [den
oi March, a top recording group also irom Chicago, playing tor the
dance in North Lounge. Meanwhile, the Forum will have gone cafe
style as the Grill adds Italian tablecloths and Candlelight to smoke
and coffee.

All in all this will not be one of Grinnell's more stagnant
weekends,
