Off-Campus Woman Exits Illegally;
‘ Punishment To Be Conduct Probation

Last week the Women’s Primary
Court sentenced a woman to twen~
ty nights of hall continement with
ten nights suspended, and recom-
mended revocation oi ntfrcampus
housing privileges and transler to

r the Quadrangle as soon as possible.

In addition, the Court's recom-
mendation of conduct probation
until the end of the current semes-
ter has been accepted by the
Dean’s Committee

The woman involved was
charged with illegal exit and later
ness in excess at one-and-a-halt
hours. The woman pleaded guilty
to the illegal exit but pleaded in-
nocent to the charge of lateness in
excess of oiie-altd-a-half hours. She
was found guilty of both charges.

The Woman left her residence at
about 1:15 a.m. and returned at
2:30 a.m. The Court said that the
term lateness “is something or a

\misnomer in this case," but went

on to say that “there is no other
charge presently in the hand hook
which Covers the violation.” Late-
ness is counted from hours, in this
instance, 12:30 am.

The Court stated that. at the time
of the case there was not a “truly
appropriate charge“ but that now
that the administration has ap-
proved a charge of "unauthnrized
absence from the Quadrangle" this
problem will not arise again.

The penalty tor an unauthorized
absence between final closing
hours and 6 am. will range

from ﬁve nights of hall contine-
ment to conduct probation. Any
unauthorized absence terminated
later than onesandrarhnlf hours
alter closing time will result in
conduct probation.

An additional change states that
iailure to sign out, or signing out
without a Colinlei'signailil‘e or a-
gainst regulations will be con-
sidered an unauthorized absence.

The suggestion to move the wo-
man back to the Quadrangle sets
a precedent. The Court said this
was done in order to “stress the
need tor responsibility and matur-
ity wuhin oft-campus living quarr
ters." In the words of the Court,
“The delendaiit’s actions Consti-
lute an abuse of these (oil-
campus) privileges.”
