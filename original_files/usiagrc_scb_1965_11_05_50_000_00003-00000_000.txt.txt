Charlie Wu had his rovengel As I dizzily stared

(Continued from last issue.
at my buttonless shirts, I asked the nameless China<
man. “What happened?"
“So solly," he giggled, "Wild mongoose ﬂy in

‘window and eatee, eatee, thinkee they were seed."

He guilawedr

“Mongeese don’t even fly, you lazy punk,” I
snarled. “And each button Will cost you five more
pounds of free laundry." Now, it was my turn to
giggle.

“[ iigure you owe me 150 pounds of free laundry,
and ii 1 don’t get quicker service. I’ll have a court
injunction on you before you can say, ‘Mao Tse
Tung.’ ”

Charlie was impressed, and so were my friends
when I offered to have their laundry done for free.
They were not very impressed when all their shirts
came back without buttons. however.

But when I explained that for every button lost
live nee pounds oi laundering were gained, everyone
immediately shared my enthusiasm for such a good

deal.

At an average of 9 buttons per shirt and 20 shirts
per bag (we soon quit having extraneous apparel
such as underwear washed, since there was nothing
to he gained from anything but shirts), each bag
meant 900 more pounds or tree laundering

Within three weeks, all my acquaintances and
their acquaintances were having their shirts done
tree, for Charlie now owed me 73,745 pounds, and
the number was increasing every minute as he
washed and then vengefully derbuttoned shirt after
shirt.

Newspapers soon picked up the story, and people
on the street began to offer me the Shirts all their
backs. Young ladies hastening to work in only bras
sieres were not uncommon, for few people could
allozd to miss five free pounds of laundering.

Charlie Wu’s business was hooming so iantas
tlcally, in fact, that he had bought out all the other
laundries in Chicago to keep pace with the demand.
He reaped huge proiits hy reselling the cut-oil but<
tons (just as 1 sold the buttonless shirts) to shirt
manufacturers ior ridiculously inﬂated prices. Such
was the demand for shirts for de-buttoning.

Then, one day, the whole thing blew up in my
face. My ﬂeet of semis had picked up their daily
load oi bottomless shirts, when 1 opened the bags and
discovered all the Shirts in shreds, useless for resale.

I returned iniuriated to Charlie Wu's and met
the inevitable Chinaman.

“So soiiy,” he giggled again, and i knew the show
was over. “You notice each buttun still on shirt. Very
careful, this time. So soiiy hout nasty rips, but no
iree laullry for tilat. No free lautiry for dirty Ger
man fascist.”

The stock market crash of 1925 was like a truck
driver’s forgetting to leave a tip in comparison with
the results oi the Chlilaman's iiendish prank. Every«
one wanted their shirts back. hut only rags were ieit.

I sold rangs on street corners and wore rags eV<
erywhere. Girls no longer walked only in brassieres,
and the high neckline was in vogue. Charlie Wu lept
from the top of the Tribune Tower, screaming,
“Dirty capitalist!"

Tragedy filled the air like soot in a steel town,
and the nameless Chinaman only laughed,

Poverty Grant Killed'in While America' Here Tomorrow

A lﬁrdollar appropriation from
student act' es for the Des
Molnes Project was rejected
Wednesday evening by the student
senate.

Tile proposal was made at the
previous meeting by Dibble Hall
which allotted 15 dollars to the
project from hall iunds. Objec-
tions to the senate allocation were
that the project has political over-
tones, inasmuch as it represents
a political action: that the project
is not supported by the general
consensus of Grinlleil student
opinion; and that the project is
not an appropriate activity on
which to spend student funds in-
tended for social activities.
