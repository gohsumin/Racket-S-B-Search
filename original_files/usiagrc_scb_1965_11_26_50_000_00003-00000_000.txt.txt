Edam, Jim. Wadi

Nine years ago, an alert 5&8
columnist noted the possibility of
small-town trauma among the
newer students at Grinriell, As he
put it. . .

“According to the catalog. Grin-
iiell College is situated in ‘Grinr
nell, a city oi nearly 7000 persons

. about 300 miles west oi Chi-
cago and 50 miles east or Des
Moines.‘ This puts us right in the
middle of nowhere, and it has oc-
curred to me that a new student
from a big City might be confused
by this phenomena at the small
American town,

“For this reason, i thought we
might take a short tour at the
town, while I point out some, of
the more interesting features."

Astute Columnist goes on to give
a royal tour of “downtown” Grin-
nell, which has changed little dur-
ing the intervening years. Thus.
to supplement our recent pictorial
View of the town of Gi‘innell, we
present Gene Thompson's
(That's right, he's now Astute
Dean of Men) tour nl town:

“Joe's While Spot is the ﬁrst
place to meet the eye on the use
unl route downtown, The only
word to describe Joe's is “Funca
troiial". . .t-lei-e you can grab a
quick hamburger when you can‘t
hear the thought of gristly stew
or watery macaroni in the dining
room.

“If you turn left after Joe’s. you
find that Broad street unlulds be-
iore you, as tar as the eye can
56%“) the railroad tracks. One
block down Broad Street, we find
the "square," a solid block of
buildings with cars circling as
found it

“After seven pm, on any night
at the week, these cars are driven
by teen-age “soodsLa “seed”
who is trying to be a “hood". . .
They never drive in anything but
second gear, so as to be able to
slow down and stop for any dollie
that might happen to come out
of Davis’ Ice Cream parlor.

“As you walk around the
square, don’t miss the following
attractions. The newstand (Yes-
sir, that's Brownle's very own
Varsity Book Store) is the center
oi Gi‘innell intellectual activity, At

 

last check, they were offering a
wide variety of detective maga-
zines with stories titled ‘Sin,
Scandal, Sex, and Death' and
‘Fourteen Slashes in her Shortie
Nightgown.’

“The Poweshiek bank, on the
next corner, was designed by a
famous architect named Sullivan,
a pioneer in steelrand~concrete
construction, who fancied that this
bank should look like a brick
vault. And it does, I guess, ex-
cept for the little gold lions crawl-
ing all over the front,

“Turning right around the
square: Wayne’s Steak House,
where steaks are fine and the am-
oer rluid flows treely, and Cun-
ningham Drug, where everything
is packaged neatly and displayed
under glaring lights," (it you
are looking for thosHi‘, steaks,
Wayne's has rounded one more
corner during the last lew years.
And ask for the Rex it you want
directions trom any true-blue
Grinnellian.)

“Around the corner again. . the
Strand, which runs the popu-
lar extravaganzas in vista-Vision,
and the Iowa (which is closed, but
that's OK anyway)"

Coed Coroner. Catholic Curricula
Bring ‘Dead' Issues To Campuses

Must there be restrictions on
academic freedom at Str John’s
University because it is a Catholic
school?

The members of St. John's chap-
[er of the American Association
of Professors think not, but the
university's president disagrees. At
the heart of the issue is teaching
procedures in the departments of
theology and philosophy and other
departments where the matters of
faith and morals are vital to the
curriculum.

The professors called the limi-
tations "a philosophy of education
that is medieval in Spirit.” There-
tore, they will not participate in
any administrative decisions until
given full academic teaching tree-
dom, but the president of St. John’s
has refused this request on the
grounds that the college will not.
remain Roman Catholic in its un-
derlying philosophy.

Janet Bond, a student at Mount
l-lolyoke, has been elected coroner
of Mercer County, NJ.

Miss Bond solicited a write-in
vote among a hundred triends and
relatives, and their votes provided
the margin or victory.

Her functions and salary as core
oner are nearly nonexistent. All on-
achronistic law requires the office
to be listed on the ballot, but all

 

the duties of the coroner are now
handled by a professional medical
examiner. However. Miss Bond
does retain the duty to examine
bodies of shipwreck victims of
Mercer County.
