This space, alongside the
essay by George Eastman (eds

President Glenn Leggett since
before Spring Vacation. After
hearing President Leggett at
ten advocate I “master-laps
prentlce” philosophy oi educa—
tion, we Asked him to define
this concept to students in an
essay ior The Reporter. At the
same time, in the interest of
debate, we Asked Mr. Eastman
it he would prepare an essay
on s iundamentally ditterent
educational philosophy — that
philosophy which says that “we
are all learners together."

Though President Leggett
worked on the essay (or several
weeks and promised to submit
it beiore leaving on vacation,
he embarked on his trip thin

Presidendsl Assistant Henry-
York Steiner that he could not
meet his commitment, Accord-

"Fun' 1 ”It rim

To the Editor:
Sotlte weeks ago, one oi us charged
in these pages that “North campus is
a spurious community.” The events
which we witnessed during “Spring
Rial" only coniirm this observation.
Going to David's room in Cowles otter
dinner, we were contnuatly harrassed,
(bombarded with water balloons) and
virtually driven irom the hall, (In the
process, the room was invaded by iorce,
while Adrienne was later grazed by an
egg thrown at her inside the ladies'
restroom). Three students share prime
responsibility tor the whole series oi
incidents: Jim Stewart ("E-Brow"), .lini
Drasdo (“Flush), and Ken Adeiman.

The trouble began as soon as we
entered the room. bciore David could
secure the door, “Flush" had pushed
himseli partway through, water balloon
in hand. By a combination oi shoving
and caioicry, Drasdo was urged back
into the hallway, so the door could be
locked. He then walked through the
ciuiiroom door to the outside root. and
tried lo re-erlter the room through line
window, At this point David asked him
not to spoil other people’s fun — to
let them have a good time. Instead, a
crowd gathered, repeating taunts trom
the outside,

it quickly became apparent that we
needed paper cups, and David also
wished to buy some cigarettes. Staning

out tor the Forum to pick mom up,
he received near misses irom water
balloons, aimed on the root. Upon rc-
turning irom the errand, he had Ad-
rienne let him in, siter which site went
to sit down. immediately iive or six
guys, led by Adclman and supported
by “Brow,” iorced their way into the
room. despite the eitorts oi both Ad
menus and David to resist them at
the door. Shouts went up. “Party in
bat's room," “Free booze!" This re4
mark reierrcd to a pint oi bourbon
which has been given to Adrienne ior
tier twcntyiirst birthday. Meanwhile,
tour mcn stood outside the window with
balloons, as a stream oi people rushed
through the door. Ken gaily asked,
"Do you mind it We use your room as
a passageway?" Following his sugges»
tion, thc crowd slowly milled their way
to the window and crossed over to the

discussion or educational phil-
osophy would be too “rhetori-
cally deﬁnitive," would “close
debate."

Earlier this year, during The
Chelrs censorship controversy,

the student newspaper Asked
Mr. Leggett to express his
views on censorship in an srtl~
(:19 N be published in the pa-
per. After making several Its
tempts to write the article and
alter having several discussions
with newspaper stall mem-
bers and others on the subject,
Mr, Leggett requested that he
would rather discuss unsure
ship directly with the senate
than write In article. The
newspaper not: agreed to this
plan; the senate discussion
was supposed to take place in
the near future, it has yet to
take place.

ligation to discuss the issues

noted that “this it the only way to
communicate with those people.” And
then s parting shot: Adienne was
nearly hit with a water balloon thrown
through the window. when the iiood
began to subside, we locked the door
and windows, expecting to have a drink
and enjoy a smoke. Before we could
begin, a mixture oi water snd beer
slowed into the room from a waste
baskct which had been iilled and then
overturned outside the door.

Upon discovering that the cigarettes
purchased earlier had been stolen,
David decided to go get another pack.
Starting out ior the Forum a second
time. he was again struck with a hat-
loon. Adrienne, remaining behind,
heard such calls as “There goes Dave
Dillon down the stairs," “Is Dave in
thercz", ”Is But in there?" “Hey,
Dave, i want to ask you some ques-
lions." Aiter coming back, we were
able to keep everyone out, but not to
avoid the noise and disturbance.

About 7: 5, we decided that it we
were to enjoy the rest of the evening.
we would have to leave, We made rare-
iul plans, Adrienne, with the bourbon
concealed in her purse, was to hurry
to the restroom on iirst ﬂoor and wait
tor David there, She did this, with Da-
vid following perhaps two minutes
later. l-lit with two more balloons on
the way downstairs, he was conirontcd
with yet another barrage irom Stewart
and Adeiman after reaching the
groundrﬂoor lounge. In iact, two of tire
balloons shot by Ken rebounded irons
his body and fell to the iioor without
breaking. Commenting that “the water
balloons sure hurt" David tried to draw
the two men away irom the hall door,
so that Adrienne could leave the rest-
room, “Brow" remarked that it the
balloons did not hurt. he would go get
an egg, and added that Adrienne had
already been hit with one. When the
coast seemed to be c ar, David called.
“Let's go, Adrienn We both rushed
for the door, being just missed by yet
another balloon as we walked into the
loggia. Aiter getting outside the door,
Adrienne described how one of the as-
sailants in the lounge had entered the
restroom and tossed an egg at her.
linking our way to South Campus, we
were finally able to enjoy the evening.

Women's hours regulations by next fall

Statement from duns‘ Office

The Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, working with the student deans,
proposed to the President that warm
en's hours no longer be regulated, on
a coilegewide basis, at Grinnell. Thu
President, after necessary consultation
with the Trustees. has approved the
proposal which will become eiiactivs
u oi the fall term 1961.

This approval rests on the beliei that
my regulation or college women’s
hours. either by the College or by the
individual, is a matter of security rath<
er than morality and that reasonable se-
curity can be assured within the wom-
en's residences without the necessity of
the College maintaining an arbitrary
“hours" system,

The College is Aware significant
changes have occurred over the years
in Ittitudeu And pracliou which affect

— a rooted indiiisrenoe to personal
relationships. Until Grinnell is ready
to set its house in order, its intellec»
ttul aspirations remain e manic delu—
tion.

1e the Editor:

Typical ot us stodgy, over-30 types,
1 was sorry to see the name oi our
great college paper changed Reverenca
ior tradition was part oi this regret
but 1 also telt the title was s rather sc-
curate description oi the content. Cer-
tainly the picture painted week aier
week is “black" enough, and certain
connotations of “scarlet" seem appm-
prinatc (although the idea oi The Yet.
low and Black does spring to mind).
But i was unprepared im- the ilicreds
ible gradeschoolish banality oi the
title chosen. Still, 1 did hope that, as
promised, we would now get reporting
on criniiell. Imagine my surprise, then,
on iinding most oi the important space
in the April 14 issue given over to

Willllm's deserved recognition as the
fine photographer he is. Since the
FWI is one oi the charities my wiie
and i have contributed to in the past
two years, stories on it have a certain
inerest. But none ot this is really
“Grinnell reporting.” 0h, 1 know Mr.
Allin had a try at relating Donald
Smith to Grinnell in a rather naive
edito~'al but this was not very con.
vincing, (In tact, it his is what Mr.
Allin has gotten irom his political
science major, tine is tempted to sug«
gest that he ought to ask ior his money
back)

Aha, you will say, “Mr, Out” has
missed the whole pointi These articles
are directly related to Grinnell. The
Wilhelm piece reminds us that the col-
lege does not produce people oi real
talent and throws out those who have
it anyway. The Smith piece demon-
strates that the lack oi such a phenome-
tion at Grinnell shows how hopeless
we are and, at the same time, that the
ioi-ces now alter Smith are the same
kind which control students—in league
Win the administration — at Grinnell.
The Full story is really to he read as
a denunciation oi all that Griliriell does
and stands ior.

Okay, but the demands on one's atolls

necdcd to relate these stories directly
to Crrlilllcll is severe. Couldn't thc edi-
tors have done the job more simply?

neither contemporary parental practic-
es nor educational philosophy tends to
support such regulation.

For instance, how a student uses hi!

individuals academic success and st»

person, the time, and the place, From
en academic point oi view it seems
likely that sell-regulation, necessitating
the development or sell-discipline and
sensitivity to priorities and proportion,
has a iirmer educational justiﬁcation

To enable the College to assist the

Though the College atiinns that basic
responsibility ior himseit rests with the

Ten elected Friars

Ten junior men have been elected to
Friars, the men’s senior honor society.
01d members selected the new Friar:
on the merit or their intellectual
achievement (a 3,25 cumulative grade
average) and their interest and contribu-
tions in school affairs. Richard
Heilbmn. president 1966-1967. described
this last qualification as subjective; it in-
voives both an active and curious intels

Friars are primarily an honor group,

Mendoza, Richard Segimi, and John
