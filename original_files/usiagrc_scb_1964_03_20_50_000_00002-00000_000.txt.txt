Integrated Dorms?

The new AWS Board hasn’t wasted any time get
ting involved in campus affairs. They have taken on the
well-worn problem of a south campus integrated dorm
system and are presently aiming at finding some defi»
nite plan to be initiated this spring. (For those of you»
who might confuse integrated dorms with co—ed living,
it should be stated that the system in question involves
only the women. Concern rests with the possibility of
abolishing freshmen dorms and distributing first~year
Grinnell women throughout the quad.)

The latest questionnaire offered to the women
students is pointed at getting the widest selection of
personal opinion — the Board has left itself open to stu-
dent desire — they want to do what the students want

'done. This appears to be the saving grace of both the
questionnaire and any subsequent action that the Board
might take. One of the greatest stumbling blocks in
working with the problem .of integrated dorms has been
trying to find out just what the students want.

' Agreement is widespread on the theoretical value of
integrated dorms. Few see much harm in spreading the
freshmen class out so that their first year contacts are
broadened and deepened. Practically, however, student
opinion is much more divided. Upperclass women are
well aware of the physical limitations that hinder the
integrated dorm idea. The nicest rooms in the quad are
generally found in the upperclass dorms, while the
more limited quarters have been used year after year
for the freshman class. Multiple rooms — triples and
Quads — are also housed in upperclass dorms. Should
the dorm system be integrated, it would be necessary
to put freshmen in the multiple rooms and in many of
the larger doubles and singles. If enrollment is kept
constant, it would also be necessary for upperclass
.women to choose their housing from among the more
crowded quarters along the loggia.

i The questionnaire has already given some indica-
tion that quad women are concerned with the physical
disadvantages of an integrated dorm system: One after
another upperclass student will say that she favors five
or six integrated halls; but that, under such a system,
she would prefer to live in- one of the upperclass dorms.

Thus, the integrated dorm system finds itself faced
with the problem of theoretical vs. practical. The wom-
en are not shutting the door on possible experimenta-
tion, or even a degree of self-sacrifice in order to make
a new system work. They are illustrating the im-

mediate need to deal with the physical problems that
do exist.

The new AWS Board has indicated that physical
problems can be gotten around. Quad opinion seems to
demand that such problems must be worked out simul»
taneous with or before the initiation of an integrated
dorm system. The reality of room drawing dissapoint-
ments should be much more prominent than the theor-
etical advantages of abolishing freshmen dorms. Both
the Dean and the AWS Board should be disturbed by
the fact that the students favor an idea, but don’t really
.Want to commit themselves to live under it.

Peters: lane Boosts Own Career by Defending Oswald

To the Editor:

Recently a part of the Grin-
nell campus has heard a tape
with the speech of a New York
attorney, Mark Lane, on the
guilt of Lee Oswald in the

assassination of the President.
Lane claims the innocence of
Lee Oswald by the means of a
crowd pleaser rather than
those of an attorney at law.

I have heard the address on
the tape by Mark Lane and
read his “Defense Brief” in the
supplement of the weekly news
paper that published his argu-
ments and feel it would be im-
possible to answer all his dis-
tortions of evidence an d
smears in one letter. However.
I give several examples. Mark
Lane states the first murder
weapon that was found was a
German Mauser rifle and that
the police after catching cs.
wald deliberately claimed the
murder Weapon to be an Italian
Carbine just because Oswald
owned and Could be connected
with an Italian Carbine. He
neglects to mention that the
bullets in President Kennedy's
body were of a type that would
be fired by an Italian Carbine.

Mark Lane also presents as
“evidence" that the paraffin

tests registered negativeon
Oswald’s face and therefore
Oswald could not have fired a
rifle. He neglects to point out
that Oswald was able to go
home and change his clothes
before he was apprehended.
During this time Oswald ob-
viously would have tried lo re-
move the gunpowder stains
from his face and hands.
Where did ohe gunpowder
stains on Oswald’s hands come
from? It is clearly established
that Oswald carried a revolver
With him when he Walked away
from his home and that later
Oswald shot and killed a police
officer.

Even Mark Lane does not
really offer any negative argue
ments to the accusation that
Lee Oswald killed patrolman
rippit. Oswald, before he was
killed, admitted that he owned
the revolver that shot rippil.
Lane‘s lame return is that the
person who filed the affidavit
of the murder described the
killer as short, stout, and with
bushy hair. Lane then de-
scribes his Lee Oswald as of
medium height and slender
with wavy hair. For a witness
many yards away from the
scene of the crime, it would he

Patrick Denounces New Policy:
Social Planning Board Usurps
Legislative. Judicial Authority

To the Editor:

It is indeed gratifying to di -
cover that in keeping with Grin-
nell’s tradition of liberalism
and progress there exists here
in an embryonic stage of devel-
opment an organization which
may well revolutionize govern-
mental theory. Its existence
was discovered on or about
February 13, 1564, who the so-
cial Planning Board, an admin
istrafjve agency, advanced into
the legislative realm by out-
lining the legal procedure by
which the open dorms privilege
would be extended to the vari-
ous halls on the Grimell Cam-
pus. The response of SGA re-
minds one of the appeasement
policy of the Allies at Munich,
when, confronted with a fetal
Leviathan, they succumbed
quietly. ‘

But this was merely the be-
ginning. On March 3, 1964, the
Social Planning Board grasp
within its tendrils the Judiciary
Branch of the Student Govern—
ment by defining the court pro-
cedure and legal definitions
necessary for handling open
dorm violations. The entirety of
American political science, for
years naively enslaved by the
apparent advantages of various
federalist models, has no doubt
been stunned by sudden realiza»
tion that here within a com-
paratively closed system is a
living governmental organism
which could quite possibly
completely erase the inefficien-
cy and bureaucratic ponderous-

 

ness of tripartite government.
Having securely grasp the

legislative and judicial branches
of government, it is only a mat»
ter of time before the Social
Planning Board discovers with-
in its mind the fullest outlet for
its dementia praecox, i. e. the
absorption of executive power.
Only then will Grinnell College
realize The New Order.

It is with happy hearts that
we await sublimely the final
consummation of our collective
beings within the magnanimily
of The New Order. Freed of
the necessity of wrestling with
any social or ethical problems
the students will be able to fo-
cus their attentions complete-
ly upon academic pursuits,
basking In the security of en
lightened despotism. Ultimately
we can envision complete iden~
tification between the Board
and the students, so that the
thoughts of eleven become the
thoughts of all.

Although it is true that lhc
Social Planning Board does
have jurisdiction over this so»
cial program, as it is still on a
“trial" basis, it appears that
the Board‘s actions accurate-
ly reflect lwo prevailing aspects
of student-administration con-
flect. First it illustrates a ten-
dency on the part of the admin»
istrauon to avoid direct Con-
fliot With the students and to
deal with them through admin-
istrative agencies. Secondly it
reveals student apathy, a pen
Vasive desire to avoid cnoillct.
Progress and responsibilify not
only involve conflict, but dc»
mand confrontation and com-

 

promise. Robert Patrick

hair of the killer was wavy m-
bushy (it could also be a mat-
ter of semantics), whether he
was of short or medium height
(Oswald looked fairly short la
this letter writer), and wheth<
er the killer was Slender or
stout when he was wearing a
jacket.

Also of grave concern is
What Mark Lane never men—
tioned or rebulted. Oswald was
offered and refused a lie de-
tector test. Oswald was known
to have beat his wife many
times. As a matter of fact,
Marina Oswald once was sep-
arated from her husband be-
cause of this. Also unexplained
is Why Oswald resnsled arrest
and tried to fire his revolver
at Patrolman McDonald when
he was arrested. Neglected too
is Oswald's letter to John Co -
nally, then Secretary of 'he
Navy, promising to revenge
Connally's refusal to reverse
the undesirable discharge of
Oswald from the Marine Corps.

It is hopefully demonstrated
how much some of the facts
have been twisted in the ver-
sion of the killing by Mark
Lane.

It may be that Mark Lane is
not after “justice” or the
“American tradition of juris-
prudence" or any other such
abstraction and really desires
publicity and the applause of
large crowds throughout the
country. His jokes and the
laughter and lhe applause they
aroused could indicate this
possible assertion. Perhaps he
hopes through this case to re-
build the political career lie
had launched earlier and which
for some reason was interrupt-
ed in 1962. However, because
of his conduct in this C1155.
it would not be surprising if he
weze repudiated by the volcrs
for many elections to come.
