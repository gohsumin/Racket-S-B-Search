FLIGELTAUB’S SPEECH T0 SENATE

Last spring, after much de«
liberation, i decided to seek the
office of the President of the
Council of House Presidents. I
recognized the problems assucl‘
ated with the office: however,
I was optimistic, and thought
that through a conscientious ef-
fort. I could iuliill the respon-
sibilitiies, minimize the difficul-
ties, and provide leadership both
for student government and one
student body. As I became more
involved in SGA, I sensed more
acutely the conflict between the
responsibilities and the prob-
lems. Yet. I continued to work
because I believed the conflict
could be resolved without any
drastic personal decision. I now
have arrived at the point that
I can see no resolution for my-
self and can foresee only the
impairment of the C of HP and
SGA leadership if I do not make
that personal decision,

The immediate factor forcing
my decision has developed from
my philosophy concerning stu-
dent responsiblhnies and com-
munity rules. especially those
relating to the open dorms
question. Unlike several student
leaders who have adopted a
philosophy of hall rights, l have
not and, as l interpret the role
of the C of HP presidency, I
can not. I, therefore, have had
the following policy about open
dorms: if I have passed a wo-
man entering the hall or if i
have heard a woman's voice
in the room or it people have
complained to me about the
noise from a coeducational par-
ty in a room. I have asked the
men involved m remove the
women from the hall. I also
have explained to the people in-
volved that after three separ-
ate warnings. I would send them
to the judicial council, (To say

the least, this policy irritates
ntany students and officers who
disdain their responsibilities.)

Yet, with my election. 1 as-
sumed a greater obligation to
be concerned not only with hall
rights and rules but also com-
munity rules and rights. Sim-
ply because a particular ma-
jority in a hall or his officers
decide not to recognize a rule,
I do not lose suddenly my re<
sponsibilities to the entire com<
muniuy. The inseparability of
student responsibilities student
government responsbi ies and
community responsibilities seem
so fundamental to me that l can-
not compromise on this princi-
pie.

Some people have asked me
why, after three years at Grin-
nell, this principle has become
so sacmsanct to me. i have
no definite answer to this ques-
tion. other than that this office
has stimulated some thought in
my formerly indifferent mind.
I, however, do know that now.
both as an individual and as a
student leader, I can not ac-
cept an attitude that completely
negates a rule because it is
disagreeable to several people.
I consider an irritating rule a
poor excuse ror shunning one’s
duty to honesty and responsi<
bility.

Yet, some people have been
pressuring me to adopt that at«
titude. Now, what are the im<
plicahions and alternatives in
their demand. One alternative
would be to compromise the
fundamental principle of stu-
dent responsibility and honesty
within the college community.
Another alternative would be
for me to fightl and defend thiﬂ
principle. with all the conse-
quences that might emerge from
the struggle. A third alterna-

tive would be to reslgn from
my office.

As I stated, the principle of
student honesty and responsibib
ity is essential to my philosophy
about student life in the Grim
nell community. Student parti-
cipants in non-academic areas
is primarily earned or deserved
rather than inherent in the col-
lege situation. i do not believe
in flouting a college rule be-
cause it seems to infringe upon
my freedom, 1 do believe in
changing the rule through dis-
cussion and argumentation —
even if these processes require
much more thought and time.
Thus, especially when l have
the honor to he in a student
leadership role which should de-
mand more responsibility than
the normal individual struggled
with, I can not turn away and
acquiese to pressures for total
neglect of the rule or rules.
You see, therefore. that com-
promise is an unacceptable an-
swer for my problem.

To light and to deiend my
philosophy were the second al-
ternative I suggested. The idea
of a struggle does noti frighten
me, for I love to accept chal<
leiiges of this nature. Nor do
I fear the possibility oi dls<
covering that my views are those
of the minority — after being
Jewish and Catholic for twenty-
one years, I have learned not
to be disturbed with having
minority ideas. I, however, am
reluctant to force discussion of
this principle at this time for
two reasons. During the com-
ing months the entire com-
munity will be deciding on
major reforms in academic,
social, and residential areas.
Stiudent leaders will have the
opportunity to play vital role:
