German Professor Discusses Europe's Future

Last Thursday evening in R0-
berts, Dr. Kartkristoph Schweit-
zer o! Berlin’s Free University
spoke on “Germany, DeGaulle,
and Europa" He viewed West
Germany as a country promot-
ing wider European integration
and De Gaulle as a 19th century
throwback blocking such efforts.
He also altered his own thesis
for understanding German his-
tory of the last seventy years.
These years, he said, have
seen constant neurotic shiits in
German thought from a view
of national superiority to one
or national inferiority. Alter
1948, he said, Germany was set-
tling down to a medium position,
but De Gaulle’s nationalism has
stimulated an incipient German
nationalism.

Dr. Schweitzer said that Ger-
man policy makers, unlike many
foreign policy makers today.
have three general goals. First,
Germany wants to work for an
integrated Europe, a European
community. He cited Article 2A
of the Federal Republic’s consti-
tution which authorizes the gov-
ernment to surrender national
sovereignty to a greater Euro-
pean community. This goal has
been supported by the "greater
majority" or Germans. Second,
West Germany wants reuniﬁca-
[ion of Germany. Third, West
Germany wants peace and has
renounced war as a means of
diplomacy. Despite internation-
al cliches about peace, Dr.
Schweitzer said. “This goal is
taken very seriously in Ger-
many and in Europe.” All par-
ties in W. Germany support
these goals and believe none
should be carried out at the
expense of the other.

De Gaulle Out of Tune

“De Gaulle," Schweitzer said,
is "out of tune with the majority
of his countrymen, Presiding
over a titular democracy, he has
restored order to French politics
~and for this We should be
gratciui — hot the question is
who next. in foreign policy gen-
erally he is intellectually over-
rated. There are more inconsis-

Is influenced by the love of the

French policy in SE Asia as one
example of inconsistency. There
the French represent a colonial
power yet are liberally mani-
pulating antircolonial feeling.

Schweitzer believes De Gaulle

not stop it. De Gaulle’s goal of
a Europe tor itselr has negative
effects on Nato and to Schweit-
zer is inconsistent. De Gaulle
will not give up Nato but gives
up an integration in the alli-
ance which is its basis. “In his
heart," Schweitzer quipped, “De
Gaulle must know he's wrong.
His is a prestige policy that is
nonsense realistically.“

In the long mm, it is disaster-
ous. We should work to keep up
a triangular relationship be-
tween Washington, Paris, and
Bonn and look forward to a post
De Gaulle era. The concept of
an Atlantic partnership is still
a healthy one."

Discontent Over viet Nam

in iurther conversations with
the 58:13, Schweitzer said there
was “great discontent" in Ger
many about the viet Nam War.
It is viewed as a “tragedy." an
unnecessary aiiair which the
majority or Germans accept but
do not support with any enthusi-
asm and do not want to see

With regard to German poli-
tics, Schweitzer said, “l’ll bet

that Erhard is out by ‘69." Ger-
many is facing an economic

question for the latter, he said,
is whether Willy Brandt can

believes Erhard would lose.
But, he said, the German par-
