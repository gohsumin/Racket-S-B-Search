Students Demonstrate Dilemma
As 'Forgotten Men’ in Education

By Anna Fun-er

Apparently operating under the
assumption that the lBM card 0!
today is the demonstrator of to-
morrow, students across the v.5.
have been sitting in and spouting
oit to demonstrate their plight as
“the iorgoiten mail" in American
education.

They illustrate their situation
with facts such as Association for
Higher Education’s lengthy report
concerning preparation or college
administrators which did not once
mention the word Student and
statements such as Mario Savio's
(The Berkley man) “The university
is well-structured, well-tooled, to
turn out people with all the sharp
edges worn all, the well-rounded
person.”

Grievances and gripes against
“the system" chielly seem to in-
clude the bigness at schools, lsck
Ol‘ concern for the student, and
taculty neglect or undergraduate
teaching: but students have
searched their tortured undergrad-
uate souls, acting to the fullest of
their existenial potential, and
vented their new found intellectual
purpose (or otneriness as the case
may he) in incidents ranging irom
demonstrations in defense of mod-
erii poetry in Oregon to the idealis-
tic and gastric establishment of
the Students for Justice to SAGA
Employees at the State University
of New York.

Some experts see the rebellion
against the tnctory system at edu-
cation as a little lrog in the big
contemporary puddle ot the civil
rights struggle. Mario Savio

DEMONSTRATIONS—

The Washington Teach-in on

to the Forum Saturday to hear the
academic world debate adm

lecture. The two major speakers
were George Kahin, protessor at
Cornell University, and Robert
Scalapirio. protessor at the tint
versity ol’ California at Berkeley.

From thEir talks one major ques-
tion emerged: whether the domi-
nating force in Southeast Asia is
nationalism or some combination
or communism and Peking power.

McGeorge Bundy. teatiired ao-|

not appear at the last moment. in ‘

Undoubtedly. an academic study
of Federico Garcia Lorca's Yel'lllﬂ
would reveal a wealth of cultural
and psychological insights. But the
play. as presented in Roberts
Theatre last weekend, lacked any
real signiiicance.

Everything in the play, it seemed
revolved around Yerma's desire to
have a child—and without an un~
derstanchng ot the importance or
such a desire within Yermu's par-
ticular ellVlornment. the action as
a whole lacked motivation and im-
portance. In other words, there
didn't Seem to be any "universals"
to abstract from Yerma's dilem-
ma.

Technically, the play was quite
well done, William Sherman's set
was stark, simple, and very sym-
bolic. The snatches oi music, com-
posed by Burrlll Phillips, were ei-
lectlve, anti Ned Donahoe‘s direc-
tion made the most of an unnatural
sciipt. The concept oi providing

 

“bleachers" along the sides or the
stage for the actors not involved
in a particular scene was rather
interesting.

Sile Monto’s interpretation or the
title role was generally convincing
~her expression and movement
were often excellent. But the one
mistake she did make was to start
out at too high a pitch, Miss Mon-
‘to's pleading came with her very
' first line, resulting in a one-dimem
slonal speech pattern which was
alien tiresome to listen to.

Juan and Victor, played by Terry
McCoy and tell Garland, were both
a hit weak. McCoy had good move-
ment and inflection, but lacks a
voice which can easily be pm~
jected. Garland has a tremendous
stage voice, but was inexpressive
and slilled.

Two of the more effective ac-
tresses were Deb Davis and Deb
Burnstinet Miss Davis was one of

 

the livelier characters on stage.

portrayal of the pagan crane very
etiectively.

Tanya novanessian and Carl
Dugan were generally good in their
roles, though they tended to b-
somewliat inconsistent.

in general, the entire cast and
crew worked well within the con-
lines or a script which must hava
been diliicult to interpret. it the
play dragged in spots, it also had
its enjoyable moments, such as
watching Dave Duffy chasing Sue
