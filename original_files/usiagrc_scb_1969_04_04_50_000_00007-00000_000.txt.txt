Lew: “Optimistic" SEA Future

Jim Lew. newly elected SGA
president, presented an opti-
mistic outlook on the future of
Grinnell's student government
at a recent interview with the
“:3.

Concerning the Council of
Thirteen, he said that it was
“based on a good concept if it
could be truly representative of
the whole campus." and that
hopefully since the senate‘s lic-
Lion concerning student apathy,
more students will be stimu-
lated to participate in the up-
coming elections.

Lew‘s biggest plan that he
would like to see put into action
is the calling of a general as»
sembly four times a year, at
the beginning of each semester
and after each midvsem break.

The purpose of these would
be to provide an open forum
to present different viewpoints
on what has happened and
what will happen at Grinnell.”
Speakers representing different
factions of the campus will
present programs, and com-
mittees and administration will
deliver progress reports, “state

of the college" addresses.
“Hopefully,” Lew commented,
"this will stimulate participa-
tion and new committees may
form out of the general as-
semblies."

Lew would like the Senate to
have much more contact with
house presidents and student
advisers, particularly the latter
because of their convenient lo-
cation on every floor. He also
suggested that certain son of—
ﬁces should have a salary in»
crease, but declined to mention
which ones in particular he was
referring to.

Another program Lew has in
mind is one where representa-
tives from other area colleges
would visit Grinnell, with
Grinnell doing likewise. Ha
thinks that this would probably
benefit the public image of
Grinnell as well as provide a
better perspective for all col-
leges concerned,

Lew said that some of his
policies will “mirror his per-
sonality” but right now he has
no definite image of what a
leader should be. He said that

Pterodaotyl Discussed
Behind Closed Doors

l-lenry Wilhelm and Lawrence
Frank, two Plerodsctyl staff
members, appeared at the
March 17 meeting of the Grin-

nell City Council and requested
copies of the minutes of a
closed—door executive session
during which councilmen dis-
cussed the underground papers

Wilhelm and Frank referred
to a March 10 editorial in the
Grinnell Herald Register which
charged that the closed session
called by Mayor Floyd Beaver
was illegal under the Iowa
Code. The editorial said that
the executive session w as
called to discuss Pterodactyl
and the possibility of assign-

he would probably define his
role of SGA president as he
goes along, working “for the
good of the student body, not
necessarily for the preserva-
tion of the college system.”

Beaver told Wilhelm that no
minutes of the closed session
were available because it was
“informaL”

Several councilmen criticized
the contents of Pterodactyl and
questioned the rationale behind
its publication. “Why does it
have to be published at all?"
Beaver asked.

Wilhelm explained that the
paper is published “to present
different points of View” and
for “cultural stimulation.”

“1 don‘t think we'd all neces-
sarily agree that Pterodactyl is
‘cultured’," Beaver replied,

Councilman Alan Jones

(Filst Ward), who is a his—
tory protessor at the College,
made this comment: “it’s no
secret that the paper has
been provocative in nature,
and that it offends the tastes
and sensib ities of the com-
munity. In fact, I think it’s
unduly provocative.“

Second Ward Councilman
RUSS Mott told Wilhelm he
thinks the students responsible
for Pterodaciyl want Grinllell to
“be like San Francisco.”

“Let’s leave Grinneli as Grin-
nell,” Mott said.

Wilhelm said that although
many residents of Glinllell may
be oilendetl by Ptcrotiac‘tyl,
“they don’t have to buy it if
they don’t want to."

“We’re al‘ticilt ball "or;
freedom ol the pies,"
added.

ROTC, let's turn to the reasons
Eliminaiion is advocated. There
are four common reasons.

First, it is alleged by sortie
ROTC courses Eire oi inferior
quality and therefore should
not receive credit. Having taken
mtnty orninell courses, 1 can
assure that ROTC courses are
not interior to average Grin-
neii Courses.

Second. some say that facility
lacks control over the ROTC
curriculum Legally, this may
or may not be Valid, I do not
know for sure, But we should
be looking at the actual work-
ings of the system. To my unr
del'standing, ii any changes
were requested by the college,
changes would be made. It the
change were too much for
ROTC to comply with, the rice
tachiiicnt would probably with-
drzlw.

Third, it is stated by some
that the goals of the military
are antithetical to the goals of
the college. Even granting this
somewhat dubious bland state-
ment to be true, the military
and ROTC are not one and the
same. In ROTC courses, aca—
demic freedom, dissent, disav
greement, etc. are ureserved
and encouraged, And the goal
of ROTC ls education, which
should not be antithetical to
the goals of the college.

Fourth, it is stated by some
that ROTC courses are techni-
cal training rather than aca-
demic endeavors. In some sec-

New Left Speaks

A campus Conference on the
New Politics has been sched-
uled for April 16-18, according
to junior Ira Boinick, chairman
of the Conference’s student
planning committee.

“The purpose of the Confer-
ence is to provide an oppor-
tunity for the exchange and ex—
amination of the political idea
olugies of ihe New Left," BOI-
nick told the 5&3.

“The Conference isn't going
to be a circus," he continued.
“Many people right now are
very down on the New Leit.
We want to get them seriously
interested in a political discus-
sion of it."

Among those scheduled to
speak at the three-day Confer-
ence is controversial radical
activist Jerry Rubin

Rubin, a leader of the Yippie
movement, is presently under
indictment by a federal grand
jury in Chicago along with
other New Left leaders who are
being charged with crossing
state lines to incite riots during
the Democratic Convention last
August.

Bolnick told the 5&3 that al-
though Rubin is under indict-
ment, he is permitted to leave
Illinois for speaking engage-
mellis.

Other speakers who have
agreed to attend the Conference
are Hal Draper, editor of New
Politics magazine; Representa-
[We Al Lowenstein (Dem,
N.Y.), who was a piominent
iigtwe in the recent Presiden-
tial campaign or Senuiar
Eugene McCarthy; and the
Reverend Andrew Young of the
Southern Christian Leadetsl’np
Colifeience, who was a close
associate of the late Dl'. Mal“-
tin Luther King.

A telephonic lecture by writer
and social theorist Paul Good-
mztll is also scheduled for the
Conference. Boinick said that
various “resource people” will
be present at the Conference
to reply to the principle speak-
ers.

The Conference on the New
Politics is being cosponsored
by the College’s Program in
Practical Political Etiucarlon
(PPPE) anti the American
Friends 5 e rv i c e Committee
(AFSC).

The Conference is being
planned by student represenln—
