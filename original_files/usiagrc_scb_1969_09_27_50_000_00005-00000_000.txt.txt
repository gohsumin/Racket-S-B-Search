(a) i suspect that it will not
be many more years before the
College will have to put up at
least one more new building on
campus, at which time the Book
Store may be able to secure
much larger quarters than it
could get through the proposed
expansion. 11, for example, a
common dining hall is put up
near Darby, as was earlier-
lanned beiore funds grew short
t may well include a larger and
more cor‘venient mail room and
consirerably larger Book
tore in its design.

H such a building were erect
ed, further, the present Cowles
dining space could be reconveru
ed to dormitory space, and then
perhaps some or all of Younk~
ers could be remodeled for ad—
ministrative ottices. Younkers
is not integrally connected to
the other north dorms, and is
in a good spot for ottices. ,

Such a move would leave
much more room in the Library.
then, for the Library, which is
now so short oi space as to have .
removed the older periodical
volumes to the oiiice building
downtown. The basement of Car—
negie could then be remodeled r
for new faculty offices. it, at '
any rate. new permanent build
ing will have to be undertaken
soon anyway, then a permanent
solution to the Book Store’s
problems may not be tar off.
without our having to tamper
with Carnegics basement. . ' ,

(4) It, More more perma—;
nent building plans can he im-
plemented, expansion of the
Book Store simply must be at-
rected, I think there are other,
ways oi achieving this, For ex:
ample, it the new gym is un-
ished next year, and the Wo<
men’s Physical Education Dew
partment is moved there irom
the Women’s gym tiie mail rooni .
might be moved into the wom;
en’s gym. This would make use;
oi tloor space that is ditiicrilt
to use tor most purposes, since
the walls do not appear strong
enough to support a great deal
of weight (so that i doubt that
the Book Store itself could he
moved into the women's gym).
The Book Store could then have
the present mail room to llse'
either as storage space or as a
second display room.

Or, it the new swimming pool
is the tirst part of the new
gym to be completed. the old
swimming pool could be used to .

house the mail room, perhaps, '. ,

so that the Book store could.
again have the present mail ,
room; or perhaps the Book Store ‘
could better use the old swim-V
mirig pool building itselt, after ,
the old pool was covered or .

Surely some space will be op-
ened up as the new gym is com- ,
pleterl that will allow either
the mail room or the Book store
to move and ease the problem
temporarily, _ :

It seems to me possible, at
any rate, to assist the Book
Store next year without
Carnegic’s dammit

have evidence, and I think
ou’rs ‘ieeding me a lot of be-
ogna. I think you’re lying
through your teeth and up your
hritches.‘

“I took SGA President Jim
Léw with me to the station on
Monday, and he sat through
the whole thing. Peters told me,
‘I have two guys outside, one

.who will testity that you gave
him alcohol and the other who
. says you gave him marijllana.’

”when the iirstguy came in

.he said that i had given him

some pink alcohol or same-
thing. 1 cross-examined him
and he said it’was green, I
think, and his entire story tell

,apart.

“When the kid who got bust-

. ed came in, he took the ﬁfth

on everything except his name;
Peters told him that he was
being stupid and silly.

“So anyway, Peters had to
let. me go. Before I is“ he told
me. ‘l’m going to have my
linger on you for a long time
in the ruture, and when 1 pick
you up again you won’t get
off so easily.’

“My status now is that I'm
completely oii‘ the hook, except
that Peters made some Blue
Meanle threats at me.”

Peters denied that he entered
the student’s room \Viilluut

said Come in, so I did,” Peters

) Drug Panel

lstrmlon and student.

“Anybody who saw the infor-
mation could be called before
a fact-finding body to testify.
and it would be contempt of
court punishable by fine or im-
prisonment if he did not," said
Bierman. “Then it would ha
morally up to the person in-
volved whether or not the cone
ﬂdential relationship could be
respected." /

During a question period,
many students condemned the
administration for disciplining
student drug users. “Discipli—
nary action isn’t going to help
a thing,” asserted one coed,
who said that the deans placed
her on social probation after
she suffered an adverse reac-
tion from mescaline. "Threat-
ening people dosn’t change
them, it just makes them more
deiensive."

When asked directly “why
the college should ever disci.
pline drug users,” Dean Alice
Low passed the question on to
Leggett. Alter hedging tor a
few moments, Leggett repliedi
“I think it may be an institu-
tional responsibility to disci-
pline student drug users in
some cases, because we have
obligations to Diher students
who maybe atiected (by his
drug use). and because it may
be that a pusher pr hard-core
user Should be out of the in-
stitution to save its reputation."

Panel member Robert D.
Gray, an instructor in political

science. laid that his “omos
tlonal reaction" to the drug sit-
uation Is that the college should
“get away from in loco paren-
tis completely and say, ‘Lonk.
if you want to indulge in illegal
behavior, go ahead . , . but
you may bet caught’.” How-
ever, Grey continued, “The
college can't do that because
if there is a bust and many
of you (students) get arrested
. . . it may very well destroy
the institution.”

“I‘m looking for solutions,
but I can’t come up with
any basic ones," Grey said.
“We can’s stop you from tak-
ing drugs. and we can't stop
the authorities from eniurcing
the law. That. leaves me Where
President Leggett is — there
can be no clear policy." Grey
also criticized what he Called
“the punitive nature” of parts
or the drug statement.

Student panel member Tom
Thomas, a senior, criticized ”a
preventative, punitive, enforc-
ing drug policy” which he be
lieved “m utu ally exclusive
from a positive counselling pol-
icy.

“! don't think any kind of
drug policy is going to lessen
the likelihood of a bust,” Thom-
as asserted. “A drug education
program that would lessen .the

chance oi students adversely -

affecting themselves is an area
where the college can play a
positive role.”

Thomas also criticized a
counselling system that pre—
sumes drug users are damag-

ing themselves. “In neithu
realistic in terms of positiv.
results on the user nor in term:
of medical and psychological ‘
evtdence." he said. Thomas also
advocated that the college con.
cern itself with student dru

use only when it affects ace;

‘ demic perlormance.

“It isn’t clear what kind nl
drug users the college wants t
not against,” commented senlo
Carol Holton. the other studen
member of the panel. "It's kins
oi disgusting that nothing mord
can be spelled out.”

The panel, moderated by Pro-
fessor John Worley (Philosor
phy), was the first of a' series
of discussions on campus issues.
Future panels are scheduled tor
Wednesdays at 7:30 in South
Lounge.

Other comments by Leggett
at last night’s discussion:

7“Tlle college has an obliga-
tion to persuade hard-core drug
users that thay’ra harming
themselves?

—“Most of us do not want the
Institution to become a haven
for drug users.”

—“Sometimes I think ihaf
publication at my statement
guarantees a bust. . . It is real.-
ly an'internal document.”

—“The complete vacating of
the in loco parentis syndrome at
this time is impossible . . . Th6
college can’t conserve its inc
tegrity unless it shows some
concern for student welfare
which involves some meddling!g

—“The test of whether tha_
statement is successlul will N
to see what happens."
