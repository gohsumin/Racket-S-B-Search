thirties. He wrote that he had
noticed that the staff of girls

always seemed to increase in
the weekends, but that he just
assumed they came to handle
the Increased number of traV<

eling men who came in over
the weekend. The girls were
indeed employed to handle the
extra travelling men, but not
only in the dining room. As
one of Hall’s fellow students
told him, “We are waiting
tables in a bawdy house." At
that lime, the hotel had a
widespread reputation (ex-
cept, ironically, in the town
and at the college), and trav-
elling men would make a paint
to be In GIlnnell [or the Week-
end. Mrs. Capron had these
girls do everything including
waiting on tables and scrub-
bing ﬂoors in addition to their
nighttime duties, reportedly
she paid them no salary at
all.
Slingy on Food

From 1898 to I912, the year
of her death, Mrs. Capron was
the Hotel. A very shrewd per-
son, Mrs. Capron would close
ly calculate the amount or
food that she would need
for the dining room each day.
.Often, the dining room would
run out of food, and in these
cases, the remnants of loud
lelt on the dishes oi other cus-
tomers would be served again.
'A point was made or giving
the reserved mod to traveling
men rather than to college

and townspeople. Undoubted-
ly, it must have been some-
thing to see Mrs. copron eve-
nings at the Hotel, covered
with diamond jewelry, smiling,
in Hall’s Words, “as she
turned the crank of the cash
Iegisler."

Alter Mrs. Capron's death
in 1912, her daughter and sons
in—iaw took over the manage
ment or the hotel. The daugh-
ter’s husband, Mr. Gillord,
was quite a ﬂamboyant char
acter and was well known as
a gambler. He had previously
owned and operated a saloon
at Marshalltown, and was tu-
mored to have killed a man
out Westr After the Giffords
died in the lﬂle 1920’: or early
1930’s, the College bought the
hotel and operated it until the
1940’s. During most of the
time oi the College’s owner-
ship, the hotel was operated
by Mrr George l-llser, h sun~
ln»law DI the Giilords, and
now the husband of Associate
Protessor Mrs. Velma Hisel‘.
In the 1940‘s the College sold
the hotel to Mr, Hlser, and he
owned it until 1959.

Josiah E. Grinnell, when he
iounded the town in the 1850’s,
made a stipulation on every
piece or property in town;
that it liquor were ever sold
on a piece of property, that
property would revert back to
Grinneil college, or his estate.
When the college bought the
hotel, they had that stipula-
tion removed from the hotel,
and thus irom all other land
in Grinnell.
