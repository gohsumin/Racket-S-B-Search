'OIES ROII. 28-0;

CORNELI. NEX'I

; By REGGIE GRAHAM

' The football team lost to St.
blai last Saturday, 28-0. “They
were just a better ball club,"
according to Coach Bowers. The
“Oles”, with twenty-two return-
Ing lettermen, were picked to
Win the Midwest Conference
championship by a poll or the
conference coaches. Grinnell
hasn’t put up a foo all team to
match the upper division teams
in a couple oi years, and no one
seriously expected this year to
show any difference. The true
goal of this year‘s team is to
have a respectable season, win-
hing at least half. This will be
a difficult task, considering the
two bad seasons we just came
through.

One of our biggest problems
this year will be lock or experi-
once. The sophomores have add-
ed some size and potential, as
well as spirit, but just haven't
played any varsity toothall. As
one or them put it, ‘We all real<
ly want to win, but we just don't
know how" John Czerwinski
played a good game as defensive
ﬁnd, as did Bruce Rollins
‘(whose injury could put him out
for as much as two weeks).
'Another sophomore, Roy Lewis,
looked good except for the tact
that no one was able to make
a hole for him to go through.
POI) Lillis did a iine job, and Al
Cloud was great (13 tackles».

John Busweli is coming along,
but the fact that he was away
from football for a year still
hurts his game. Don Kraitsik
looked good, catching a few
passes tor short yards. Overall,
the team did almost as well as
could be expected against an.
perlor size and experience.

Tomorrow’s game will be the
real test, and pass defense will
be particularly important. in
the past. Cornell has thrown
70% of in plays. Ric Vranek,
probably the quickest man in
our pass defense, should have a
busy day. Another big factor
will be our defensive line, which
must put lots of pressure on the
passer.

Cornell beat us in the last two
years by a total of seven points
(2124, 23-24). The year oeiore
last, they won in the llnal thirty
seconds, last year, the last quan-
ter. These memories, as well as
the rivalry between the two
schools, should add some tire to
our desire for victory. A win
would do wonders for our team’s
morale (and the students’), We
must also face the fact that a
win tomorrow could make the
difference between a respect-
able middle standing and anoth-
er year at the bottom or the
conierence list. The team needs
your support. Go to the game
tomorrow at 1:30. Fat Rog says
we’re going to win [or surel

PIONEERS BOOT CORNELL 4-2;

'Though inexperience hurt us

Though off to a shaky start,
Grinnell's Pioneers quickly took
control and worked up a so lead

on a penalty kick by Honorary
Field Captain Bruce Graham,
and a goal by Carl Brenner, rho

Cornell fought back aiter tho

Jocks From Slur:

By CINDY ROOT

Contrary to last week’s lard.
cle, which l supposedly wrote,
the girls’ ﬁeld hockey team
does not “maul” their oppo,
nents, nor do they leave their
manners in the dressing room.
when are people going to real.
Ize that “athlete" is not a syn<
onym for animal, and that all
"jocks" are not male. Sports
are a healthy outlet, and a safe
way to ease irostrations. it is
a shame that because oi the
masculine jack image tacked on
many girl athletes today, a lot
of girls are denied this enriching
experience.

The girls on the hockey field
are not lacking in femininity]:
neither are they lacking in drive
and desire, it is an exciting mo-
ment when you can feel the
parts of a team pull together
and the strength of a group oi
people who care well up insida
you. Experiences like this can.
not help but sharpen the mind
as well as tune up the body.
We are not out to play the
game to win, we are out to have
fun. and we want to will, it is
the feeling, not the result that
really matters.

Our team of uniformless min-
utemen (we rationalize; otter
all, look what happened to the
redcoats in the Revolutionary
warl) downed tho suitedrup
Iowa State team last weekend
(H). Little Jamie Rosenbiatt
sneaked behind the enemy lines
three times in the first hall, to
score our first three goals. With
the help of our strong defense—-
Cindy Maier, Heather Fonts,
Cathy Ellis and Marcia David‘
we kept our goalie Connie Ben-
ham from touching even one
ball the whole game. The sec-
ond half telt stronger than the
first as our team began to work
together. Jamie scored another
rush goal, and Mimi Euntz and
Cindy Root added two more to
the total. Getting the season
oil to such a good start we feel
we will be a pretty big threat to
U.N.l. next weekend. Lookout,
the minutemen are coming!

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

As i. M. sports chug merrily
into the second week, trends
seem to be forming which your
peerless forecaster prophesied
in the dim beginnings oi the
millenium (which is chronologi-
cally correlative to last week).
The Okles (remember them?)
have run their record to H (as
at Tuesday) by dumping Read
31—0 and North 28-7. Read was
supposed to have a strong team
so the dominance of the Oti-
Campus team is clearly indi-
cated. Dibble beat North 28-7
and East 384). Cowles never had
the ball until the middle oi the
second quarter but beat Clark
12-7 on a pass interception and
a punt runback. They are under
Seated as of now but haven’t
played Dibble or Off-Campus.
Loose was able to field only
seven men for a game with West
until they sent a car back to the
hall {or reinforcements. Out of
100 men thil IS not we exem-
plary. Read trounced West 31-0
which means the Off-Campus vs.
West game should be a real
thriller.

1. M. tennis is being played
concurrently with football but
the tennis players are more
averse to water conditions than
the footballers and, thus most
matches have been rescheduled.

born with only 13 people show-
ing interest. There are plans for

place in a time of 22 minutes
and 9 seconds. This time is
outstanding for so early in the
season.

Coach Obermiller was very
pleased with the individual and
team perinrmances, but not
with the final score.
