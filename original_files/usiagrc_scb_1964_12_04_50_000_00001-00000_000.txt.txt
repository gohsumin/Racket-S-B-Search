erts Theatre tomorrow evening,
as the Drama department and
Concerts Committee present
“Beyond the Fringe, 1965." The
production, a series of satirical
blackout sketches, will be pre-

impudent about everybody and
everything." according to one
critic. Their subjects cover
such areas as sex, Shakes-
peare, religion, war, Queen
Elizabeth, the race issue, con-

 

cert pianists, television, and
Bertrand Russell.

Robert Cessna, Donald Cullen,
Patrick Horgan and ‘James
Valentine. It was directed and

produced by Alex Cohen, who

Beyond The Fringe. 1965' Given Twice Tomorrow

The humor of the satirical
sketches is typically British,
keenedged and subtle, It is uni-
versal and sophisticated in
tone, aimed at the intellectual
audience. The players concen-
trate on the “wild inversions"
of common sense that pass for
cogent public utterance in Eng-
land and every other nation,”
and the “fatuous blather hand-
ed down as holy writ.”
