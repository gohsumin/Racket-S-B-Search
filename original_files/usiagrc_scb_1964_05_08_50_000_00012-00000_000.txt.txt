‘Escape From lnlellect'Executed;
AWS. C of HP Conveniently Absent

By Don Kurasch

In most respects, it looked
like a regular spring evening.
At 8 p.m., there were a couple
of guys playing horseshoes out—
side Younker. There were
nine or ten more playing base-

ball on Mac field. Four or five
others were practicing soccer
skills in front of Norris. But
anyone who hadn’t heard about
it by then had either been
locked in his room studying too
hard or was sick in the infirm-
ary. The word was out—“Spring
Riot tonight!”

Shortly after 8:00, a few girls
were prematur eiy being
sneaked into North campus
dorms. It was a little risky, but
it wouldn't be too long before
the C or HP and AWS were
eafely locked awayrrhe expect-
ancy was awesome; what would
it be like this year?

Then it was 8:30. Not even
the skeptics could doubt that
this was Spring Riot night now.
FI‘he house presidents were all
taken care of, the C of HP in
several of the men’s halls and
the AWS Board in the Langan
2nd john The weather was
nearly too perfect. Refrigera—
tors were being stocked with
Coke and things—mostly things.
Let's go!

For those guys with steadies
or previously arranged dates,
it was no sweat. For the others

Uninfluenced by outside .pow-

China into the United Nations
because she is convinced that
it would enhance world secur-
ity. So did Britain. Nkrumah
Stated that:

Ghana’s admission should be
determined on the basis of prin—
ciple rather than expediency. It
would be unfortunate to under-
estimate the force of the sa-
cialistic revolution that has
taken place in China. Ghana is
convinced that any attempt to
impose a form of tactical iso-
lation on the People’s Republic
of China is bound to prove
abortive in the long run”

Ghana, h o w e v e r, voted
against Russia when the latter
attempted to make the admis~
sion of China to the U.N. as a
precondition for agreeing to in.
crease the numb ‘ of seats on
the Security Councili

In regard to nuclear disarma-
merit, Ghana wholeheartedly
supported AMERICAN propos-
als for on-site inspection be-
cause she believes it to be the
safest way to preserve world
peace, enforce a disarmament
agreement, and prevent sur—
prise attacks.

In all mree of the cases
Ghana Government has pur-
sued e course of strict non-
alignment. Ghana is a disinter-
Osted third party whose only
concern is the improvement of
the prospect of world peace.

it was strictly catch as catch
can. Some followed behind the
makeshift band that traveled
the length of the quad loggia.
Others looked in the area
around-the bonfire on Mac
field. The important thing was
to stay in groups of two or
more so no one could be sin<
gled out as.not having a date.
Until one (he) found someone
of the opposite sex, that is.
(“I-ii." “Hi.” ”Quite a bonfire,
isn't it?" "Yeah." “Say, you
wanna come on over to the hall
with me?‘ I think there’s a
party going on, or something.”
“Sur-e.”)

Most of the girls without
dates returned home early. But
the dateless guys couldn’t let
themselves not have a,real
blast, Some talked themselves
into a drunk, A very few really
were. The “brave" ones shot
off fireworks. Several could
content themselves with bridge
games or television. Others
Went stag to the rock n’ roll
dance on the Cowles roof. A
few hid in their rooms and
dared to study.

Dorms were open—very open.
The only rules were those
“Written" then and there by
the participants.

The chances are, not many
students can be found who Will
say they didn't have a great
time, A minority really did,
The rest are convinced they
really did

In all, it was a successful
“riot." There was the antici<
pated minimum of damage and
rule breaking, But for the most
part it was reasonably well or»
ganized and executed. And if
nothing else, at least the stu-
dents could forget, just for a
precious while, what they were
working so hard to forget: they
were still at college—and. there
were still classes the next morn-
ing.
