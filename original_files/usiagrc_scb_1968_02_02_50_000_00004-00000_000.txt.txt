“I’m sorry," he continued,
“that the Negro students on
campus are so committed to
discussion that they simply
will not act in behalf of them-
selves. And rm sorry that the
College did not see iit to iri-

told the Senate “1 what can

“But it should not be up to
me to take leadership which I
am obviously not in a position
to take now,” he added.

After the whole thing had

Rev. Hedger said that he hoped
that small groups or students
and townspeople could meet in
small conirontations, “get to

about it.” He felt that such "is

beginning tor mutual under-
standing.

A LONG WAY TO 60

Although a beginning has now
been made, many Negro stu-
dents feel that there is still a
long way to go. Frank Thomas
gave an apprehensive picture.
This is a very dangerous situa-
tion. it is the responsibility not
only or the Negro students but
oi the entire college and the
town. The college is going to
have more Negro students. Ber
ing a Negro in the United States
is sometimes discouraging. No
one seems really concerned
about doing anything 'lhe col.
lege and the town being unaware
of these inclilenls is itself dis-
couraging."

Anne Taylor’s weekly CAMPUS NOTES column on
page eight carries a head set in ST. CLAIR type face.

ST. CLAIR _ sometimes known as “circus type”
_ became popular in the Midwestern United States
around 1875 and is usually used only tor headlines; it
“has a grey eiiect in mass use,” according lo a ty-
pographers’ handbook or the period.

The new head this week on PERSONALS (also
page eight) is set in KISMET, designed by Boston
printer John Cumming in 1879. Horace Gi‘eeley’s New
York WEEKLY TRIBUNE eventually used this type
iooe tor its Personals column late in the century.

LETI‘ERS TO THE EDITOR and NEWS BRIEFS
stel (that is, standing) heads on our editorial pages
are set in ALFERTA — perhaps the most interesting
of classic American type styles.

ALFERTA displays a deﬁnite exotic inﬂuence
with Spanish overtones; it was designed by w. F.
Capitaine in 1351.

Capitaine went to Chicago iollowing the Great Fire,
and Illis lace developed — it is said ~— mm the vivid
commentaries he read by the (tree‘s witnesses.

ALFERTA can “heat a display,” one modern type
book claims.

ASSEMBLED

from LNS

In August 1967, Douglas Tur-
ner Ward, a 37-year old black
playwright and winner oi an
“Obie” tor the best off-Broad-
way play of 196657, wrote an
arllcle for the N.Y. Times Sun-
day theater section. He men-
tioned that he would like to
work in a Negro oriented theA
ater, and as a result, the Ford
Foundation approached, and
asked him to make a proposal
tor the type or theater he en-
visioned. With the aid of Negro
actor Robert Hooks, and pro-
ducer Gerald S. Krone, a white
man, an idea was developed.

The proposal resulted in a
$430,000 grant from Ford, and
this past Iall, the Negro En-
semble Company was formed.

jor goals is to develop a Negro
theater audience. It has Cow
centrated its advertising in
black localities all over the
New York area. It advertises
in media which reach black peo«
ple and otters special discounts

tickets which can only be sold

This is done because many
