New Politics Quesl‘ions Unanswered

By DIXIE HARRINGTON

The New Politics Conference
posed the same old questions,
and answered none of them. In
every speech there was some
major tlaw that weakened the
whole argument. in several
question and answer sessions,
good questions raised key is-
sues, which the speakers evad-
ed.

What is most frustrating to
many of us who would like to
work effectively for social
change is that while we realize
it is most effective to work
within a group or movement,
we can find no group which is

satisiactory. Wouldehe activists
are held back by well-justified
doubts about atiiliating with
any particular group or follow-
ing any particular plan or ac-
ticn.

Rather than reaching conclus-
ions train the conterence, I
preier to restate certain un<
answered questions which must,
i think, be answered convinc-
ingly e and i find Mr. Rubin's
jubilant anarchy and Miss
Dohm’s handmedown Marr-
ism just as uncor incing as Mr.
Lowenstein’s abi ng faith.

D izmninble loot;

ism necessarily exploit people?
Do the institutions —alld those
controling them — have inter
ests which can only be served
at the expense of “the people?"
will the efforts of those on
the far left make easier or
more difficult the task of the
liberals in winning retorms?
will there be a right-wing re-
action which not only will sup-
press the radicals but also hillt
or reverse the progress made
by liberal rciormers? Or will
the leitward swtng of the far
left move the “middle of the
toad” further to the left and
thus make possible greater pro-
gress by the liberal Establish.
meni? Will the progress made
by the liberal Establishment be
significant or will fundamental,
systematic evils remain?

li revolutionary views pre-
vall in the lelt, would the
means necessary to win to rev—
olutionary struggle preclude the

establishment of a human so-
ciety atterwards? (Miss D,
didn’t sound very humanistic.)

How does the free action of
the liberated person help to
solve specitic social problems
such as poverty and racism?
is personal ircedom (a la Rn-
bin) only a new iorm of self-
iudulgence, or does it serve
“the movement” by Contribut-
ing to the breakdown oi this
society and/or the establish-
ment of a new and “good" so—
ciety?

Are the “black values" that
the “black culture” advocates
talk about similar to the human
values that white radicals want
(such as sharing, community
and cooperation rather than
certain kinds oi competition)?

Is the youth revolution “co-
uplahle"? Example — protits
on drugs, on “hippie" style
clothes? is “doyourownthing”
a form of “bourgeois individual-
ism” which Contributes nothing
to the revolution?

Are we powerless or power-

Pigo Thral

iul? Can people be powerful in
or out of “the system”? Is
there a danger that people will
lose hope and stop trying —
radicals retreating to Vermont
iarms, liberals retreating to so-
burbia to wait for 1972 and Ted
Kennedy? What battles need to
he tought now — slack in anti<
war activity, need for antleABM
campaign?

15 the “Liberal Establish-
ment” really “The Enemy?"
Or is “The Enemy” all those
who hold otiice and power —.
whether conservative, moder-
ate, or liberal in their stated
philosophy — and who become
protectors of the status quo be-
cause they are in power? is it
wrse to attack Lindsay but ig-
nore Eastland?

How extesive are the common
interests of liberals and radis
Gals, 0! reformers and revolu-
tionaries? On what issues are
tactical alliances possible? On
what issues are black-White al-
liances possible?

 

No Petting

By MICHAEL BRANDON

Although Grinnell men are
now permitted to entertain
women in their rooms, the
residence halls are Still off«
limits to men's real best friend,
the dog.

The College doesn’t mind
petting in the residence halls —-
as long as pets aren't involved.
Animal lovers who want to be
iriends with Fido have to live
off—campus.

The College's attitude to-
wards pets was rather clearly
revealed in the following mem-
orandum sent to a resident of

Read (Hendrix) Hall last week:

As stated in the srudent Handbook,
N0 pars are allowed in the rest-
dcncc nails Thls, ot course, applies

appreciate your coonrrntion.

Thank you,

Mrs. L. Anderson

Executive nousokcepcr

The onslaught of spring seems
to have turned the tancy or
young Grinnellians to animals.
Mrs. Anderson said that the
warm weather brought with it
“the worst problem I’ve seen."
She estimated that she has had
to deal with around 15 inci-
dents involving Student pets
this year.

She said that the College ban
on pets in residence halls “is
certainly necessary," explain-
ing that “the messes they (the
pets) create are leit there tor
a long time and the maids
have to clean up."

College Assistant Business
Manager Ralph l<. Polnerenk
explained that the College pet
policy “is primarily based on
the questions or noise, sanita<
tlon, and property damag .

Pomerenk said that bar ing
is “a universal practice" in
dormitory situations, and that
Grinnell has never allowed pets
in the residence halls tn the
best oi his knowledge.

He said that space problems
make pets in the halls unde-
sirable, and that pets are not:
easily housebrokco.

Pomerenk noted that dogs
create a problem because they
“chew and gnaw on turniture,
and sometimes invite critters
such as fleas."

“In a hall where there is an

—x

unattended dog it’s an unsani-
tary, stinking mess," he added.

Pumerenk said that special
error: is made by the house-
keeping stati to Inform students
in advance that they cannot
keep pets in their rooms, so
that students don‘t become at
tached to their pets and then
have to give them away.

“We hope that students will
understand the long range sig~
nificance," he said.

Pomerenk said that his staff
is lenient about enforcing the
no-pet rule when students have
aquariums. ”Fish don’t offer
the problems a four-footed crit-
ter does,” he explained,

“HDWCV6r,” Pomerenk con-
tinued, "we do move in on get-
bils, hamsters, and guinea
pigs because they otter aroma
problems and leakage prob-
lems."

Pomerenk said that a recent
problem he had to deal with in-
volved a lamb that was being
kept in the Younkel‘s. “I don’t
know anyone who's able to
housebreak a lamb," he pointed
out.

He Said that dealing with the
lamb problem was especially
difficult because “lambs are
sort or clumsy little things that
people get emotional about,"

“The lamb became ill, and I
understand that when lambs be-
come ill they usually ci-oak,"
Pomerenk said, Apparently the
lamb in question did, Indeed,
pass away.

Pomerenk also expressed
concertt about the groups at
dogs that have been romping
around campus lately. “When
you get a whole bunch of them
chasing a bitch in heat they
become oblivious to people,"
he said.

“The students like to watch
them because it's biologysinrac-
timl," he continued, “but we
try to discourage it."

Dean oi Students 5. Eugene
Thompson expressed concern
about. the dog packs lte SEES in
iront oi Burling Library be
cause “they get vicious when
people rough-house with them."

“The dogs really get pretty
flakey," Thompson chuckled.
“and i guess they develop dog
neuroses."

Thompson said that permite

ting pets in the halls would.
create housekeeping problems,
and that pets might get mis-
treated.

“You can have some pretty
weird problems," Thompson ex-
plained, He said that students
Sometimes lock kittens in their
closets when they go to class.
“The kittens sort or Ioul up the
place and make noise, and
sometimes ‘even go Crazy."

In addition to the problem of
mistreatment, Thompson point-
ed out that “if you get enough
animals together in a hall, it
tends to smell pretty bad."

Perhaps one explanation tor
the sudden “petomenia” at
Grinnell is the opening of a
downtown pet store last month.

Shirley Lillie, manager or
Grinnell Aquarium and Pet
Supply, said that so far- she
hasn‘t sold many pets to col‘
lege students. She did sell one
Siamese cat and one dog to stu-
dents, but she said that the
students were probably oif—
campus residents.

Students living on—campus
have bought “quite a few fish,"
she said, and one girl bought a
kitten. The girl later returned
the kitten after she brought it
to class and her protessor told
her she shouldn’t keep it.

Dean Thompson asked the pet
store manager not to sell to col-
lege students, but emphasized
that he didn’t order her to do
so.

“You can’t tell people what
to do," Thompson said.

Dogs who ireqnent the Grin-
ncll campus seem undisturbed
about the College’s nopet [lob
icy, Bandit, a mixed-breed
spokesman for campus canines,
recently told this reporter: “I
don't care about their silly, dog-
gone rules. If 1 owned a dog-
house, I probably wouldn't al-
low college administrators in it.
They whine all the lime and
create a housekeeping prob-
lem.”

spends his days on campus, re<

his nose, lie tmttcd away,
saluted a tree, and did his
thing.

The tree was unavailable for
