“His leadership had been
challenged because of the int:
dent on the bridge, and it was
then that he appealed to the
church for support in his ef-
forts," Dewey explained. “His
appeal had been answered, and
this was his moment of Vic~
tory.”

Dewey noted that the press
has covered the situation in
Alabama very thoroughly, but
has never looked closely at the
philosophy of non-Violence. C.

T. Vivian of SCLC, spoke to
the campus through a long-dis-
tance telephone hook-up Mono
day night, and explained the
philosophy at non-violence (See
story page 7.)

Dewey outlined the process
of Voter registration in Selma.
For protection, Negroes are
forced to go to polling places
in groups. But a group must
stay at least a block away or
stand in contempt of court. A
group might mill around the
courthouse for eight hours be-
fore they are given individual
numbers.

The number-holder must wait
a month and then return to the
courthouse (remaining one
block away) and wait for his
number to be Called. His num-
ber is called twice, and if he
should not be able to hear his
number, he must return in one
month and repeat the entire
process. If his number is called
and he responds, he must com-
plete the voter registration
form, which Offers numerous
possibilities for disqualified.

Dewey noted that Selma has
a population of about 30,000—
half Negro and half white. of
the whites 9,000 are registered
to vote; of the Negroes, only
about 300 are registered,

Dewey arrived in Selma on
March 11 and returned to Grin-
nell Tuesday.
