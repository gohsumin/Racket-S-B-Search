Football is over and the
bruises are healed and what
came 01 it? A repeat champion
Dibble. Dibble lost to East Nor-
ris in their third game but went
undefeated the rest of the way.

Gates also came on strong at
the end or the year and tnplr
sole possession or second place.
Smith and Clark tied for third
and East rounded out the tOlJ
spots in him place

North’s strong tennis team
easily won that trophy. East
and Smith were tied tor a dis-
tant secondl South was fourth
and Clark edged Dibble and
Rawson for the fifth spoil

Dibble leads in the Truesdale
Trophy race due to a pair of
innovations put into the I.M.
program the last couple of
years Ten points are given to
each ball for every man that
hall has participating in on in-
tercollegiate sporL Dibble col-
lected 150 polnts irom this sys~
18111.

An innovation this year is
that a hall loses ten points if
their referee does not show up
to a game he is assigned to.
Dibble was the only hall not to
lose points. Clark lost or) points
and dropped from third to
fourth in Truesdale standings.

These new innovations are
good. Yet» as far as I can tell
they have not been voted upon
by the 1M. chairmen. and is
it not here that all new inno-
vations should be discussed and
voted on? It is my feeling that
the l.M. chairmen should be
the only ones to change any
part or the intramural system.
All recent changes have come
from Mr. Plitsch’s office or
irom the halls' representative.
pitlred by Mr, Plitsch, running
each sport.

Why shouldn‘t the LM.
chairmen run the sport and
s b o u i d e r the responsibility?
This would save that part of

Truesdale Trophy

the budget designated to lrM.
sports, and paid to those repre-
sentatives, for use in the pur-
chase of good equipment and
referees.

As it is, well over four hun-
dred dollars ls spent each year
to the individuals who are in
charge of the individual sports.
1 am sure all iootbau players
will remember the sad slate of
helmets and jerseys this last
season. The campus is experi-
encing change in other aspects,
why not this one where there
is a change for the better? It
needs it!

Just as a passing thought,
volleyball starts Monday. No
favorites can be singled out as
I will not stick my foot ill my
mouth and pick East. The
swimming meet will be Novem-
ber 13, and badminton will be
December 7 and 8.

in the hall, all on passes. The
first one came on o halfback
pass to Davenport who later-
aled to Lindenberg who scored
on the 74 yard play. Later Stlltz
threw touchdown strikes to
Lambert and Phillips.

The final touchdown came
with 11 Seconds left in the
game to bring the final score
[0 39720.

This week Bowers has been
working on the porous Pioneer
pass derense. Tomorrow they
Will not get as big a workout
as against Beloit, for Lawrence
prefers to stay on the ground.
Their pass ptiense is strong
though and the Pioneers will
have to improve their defense
against it if they hope to win.

Coach Bowers noted that
Lawrence has its strongest
team in many years and the
Pioneers will need a near per—
lect game to beat them. Last

week the Vikings only lost to
Ripon 1&7 when the Redmen
scored a touchdown in the last
quarter. Besides that their rec-
ord is clean and they share
second place in the conierence
with a 4—1 record.

Leading the Vikings is their
quarterback Chuck McKee. Be-
sides leading the team in pass-
ing he also paces them in rush-
ing and is the punter. He also
leads the league in scoring with
no points.

The Lawrence defense» which
held the league’s top offensive
team, Ripon, to only 13 points,
will also be tough for the Pio-
neers to deal with

Lawrence is also anxious to
avenge the 18-16 Pioneer vic-
tory of last year which dropped
the Vikes out of the conference
championship race This year
the Vlkes figure that with vic-
tories in their last three games
they can Still tie for the Cham-
pionship this year.
