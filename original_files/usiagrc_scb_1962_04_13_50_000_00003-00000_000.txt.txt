Hanson siaies
IRC presidency
platform planks

by Gary Hanson

As a candidate for President
of the international Relations
Club, 1 have formulated the fair
lowing proposals concerning its
activities:

1. A parallel to study grcups’
could be Saturday atternoon dis
cussion groups of student and
faculty members, meeting twice
a month to explore events and
issues in world affairs, These
groups should the or a sponta-
neous nature, rather than pr
pared debates and discussions.

2. IRC should plan farther in
advance to contact well known
speakers.

3. IRC’s program for next fall
should the planned this spring,
as September is too late to line
up speakers and begin the
groundwork on a conference.

4. Study groups should rpc
used more as temporary organis
zations to cover arcas leading
up to a major coniercnce. ‘

5. Greater use can he made
of the large membership in IRC.
to draw in diverse talents to
aid the international relations
program at Grinnell,

My previous experience in In~
[emotional Affairs at Grinncll
have been state Collegiate Coun-
cil of the United Nations chair-
man and UN director. .
