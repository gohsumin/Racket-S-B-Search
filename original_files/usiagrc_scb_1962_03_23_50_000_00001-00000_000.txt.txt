StTnators follow
College, rescind
Monroe boycott

by Starr Reporter

Grinnell College vice Presi-
dent Merritt C. Ludwig Wednese
day assured Mr. and Mrs. Lee
Currier, owners of the local
Monroe hotel since Dec. 1,
1961, that the boycott which had
been placed on the hotel in 1960
under its former management
has been liited.

The boycott had been enacted,

after the College became cone
vinced that the hotel, at that
time, was practicing a term ol
racial discrimination in its cuse
tamer policy. The Student
Council subsequently voted to
join the College in its action.
On Wednesday, the Student
Senate liited its boycott upon r

ceipt of a letter from Ludwig ‘

which read in part: “Now that
the hotel is under new owner
ship and management, we assume
the objectionable practices of the
former owner are not being con.
tinued. Therefore, the College
rescinding its boycott of
hotel."
