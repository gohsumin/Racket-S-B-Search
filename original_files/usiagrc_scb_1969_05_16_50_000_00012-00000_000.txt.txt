SCARLET AND BLACK

Moves Made Toward Understanding

oy KATHY BULL

Things with town~coliege communica-
non are chugging right along. On May
1 some students and the people of the
Episcopal Church discussed the Viet-
nam war and the changing policies of
the US. They agreed that students and
other citizens are responsible ior bring-
ing their opinions to the attention of pol-
icy makers. Father TarlCreti said that
most oi the people that attended felt it
was an anceuragingly healthy and help-
ful discussion and hope that there wlll
be more of them.

Henry Scheif, Bill Thomas, Mike
Siegel, Rob Harlan. Mike Drayton, Dave
llnlmans and Phil Saslch talked with
about 25 members of the First Baptist
Church on May 4. They began by read-
ing a copy oi Ted Gilck's letter to his
drait board stating why he is resisting
the draft. After this, they hmke up into
groups of eight or nine, Henry Scheil
commented, “it was quite good. in gen-
oral, they seemed to think more of col-
lege students and understand better
why Gllck did it." Some of the topics
that were talked about in his group
were town-college relations, race, the
war, and resisting. Another group dis-
cussed the power of corporations and
reasons why there are some people who
reel so much more strongly about the
war than others and why people ieel
alienated irom government organiza-
tions. Bill Thomas, who was a member
of this group, felt that they were in
basic agreement about the War but felt
varying degrees of urgency. Many
people thought that Nixon could still do
something about it and that the talks
in Paris are not succeeding because the
North Vietnamese are obstructing them.

Also on May 4, Tom Mill, Tony No-
yak, Bill Parks, Carol Patterson, Nick
Russo, Bruce Armstrong and Captain
Perdum discussed the Vietnam war,
dissent and iorelgn policy with about

10 members oi the Presbyterian
Church. Afterwards. Novak commented
that although he would love to be an
optimist and think that We will get tD<
geiher, he believes that the best way
to maintain sanity is to isolate our-
selves. improve our self-determination
and make ourselves tree. Russo said
that he realized that a compromise was
necessary to get the resolution to the
City Council. He feels it is necessary to
simply agree that the war is unjust and
not demand agreement on the proce-
dures ior ending it.

Mark Graeser, Bruce Balls, Jared
VanWagenen and Dr. Leggett talked
with the Chamber of Commerce recent-
ly. Dr. Leggett, a member of the Cham-
ber of Commerce. introduced the stub
dents and spoke about the need for com-
munication. The board members and
the students briefly discussed the war
and action that could be taken in the
town. At the Chamber oi Commerce
meeting last Wednesday they were go-
ing to consider whether they wanted to
talk further with students.

The high school student body presi-
dcnt, Doug Kochneli, and some or his
friends and a group or college students
met a few weeks ago and decided on a
number or things they could do in the
high school about the war in Vietnam.
Andy Loewl, who talked with Kochneff,
has been trying to contact Kochneii to
ﬁnd out what, ii anything, has been
done; but he has been unable to reach
him.

Lynn Aldrich, Andy Loewl, Peter Keep.
news, David Feldman and Lee Shamr
berg are on a committee that will meet
with Miss Georgia Dental the first week
oi school next year to establish a defi-
nite policy about high school attendance
at college events. Loewi says that some
college students have been upset by the
idea or high school students attending
events that they (college students) paid
lor.

Tinker Takes Comps To Task

By KATHY KARLSON

No one questions the fact that the
comprehensive examinations at Grin-
nell vary trom department to depan~
ment in difficulty and in importance.
About three weeks ago, senior Bonnie
Tinker decided that she could not take
an examination she felt to be a mean-
ingless test of her education. She dis-
tributed a statement to seniors. calling
tor a meeting to discuss the justice at
comprehensive examinations. A few peo-
ple showed up, but Miss Tinker was the
only senior who decided to refuse to
take the examination.

On April 26, she wrote 1 statement,
“Academic Ritual -— A comprehensive
Examination," during the time allotted
for her written examination which ques-
tioned the legitimacy oi judging a tour
year educational experience in two and
a half hours, During the time designated
for her oral comprehensive, she contin-
ued discussion of this statement, insist-
ing at that time that “I would not
answer questions that were part of an
oral examination, but that I would be
happy to talk to them about my posi-
tlcns on comps, or anything else they
cared to discuss as long as it was clear
that I was not taking an examination."

Unofficially notified that she had
flunked her examinations, Miss Tinker
then petitioned the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing requesting that the re-
quirement he waived for the class of
1969. The committee unanimously rec-
ommended that the requirement not be
waived, and on May 1, the Executive
Council unanimously declined to waive
the requirement. Miss Tinker than roe
‘uuted that the Executive Council hoax

her arguments against the examination.
she will meet with a sub-committee of
the Executive Council on Friday, May
16.

Miss Tinker insists that the examina<
tion is meaningless because it varies
ircm department to department, and
that it is destructive to the educational
process because “they make an individ-
ual dependent upon extemal judgments
tor a good sell—Concept, thereby threat-
ening his uniqueness."

“Colleges have caught themselves be-
tween two poles,” she said. “On the
one hand, they want to say that edu-
cation is indeed more than, the storage
vi a given body oi information. on the
other hand, they want to continue to
apply quantitative measures which can
be transcribed into a qualitative judg.
men ."

Miss Tinker will request an individual
waiver from the requirement or will re.
quest that her letter written during the
time allotted for comm be counted as a
comprehensive examination.

The other two candidates were more
lucclnct in their answers. One said, “I
try harder.” The other answered, “I am
instilled by your existence.‘

A few other faculty members retum-
ed the test unanswered, but ”wrote their
own" by saying, “It was stupid," and
“I would have filled it out if I had had
the time." The Executive Council will
decide whether or not to accept these
examinations.
