Sports, like all other entertainr
merits, serves, through our atten-
tion, to bring' our cornried minds
back to awareness of the essen-
tially moral nature oi the
universe in which we live. The
upcoming presentation,
Basketball Game Against Coe,
demands our attention as an Obs
v'ious case in point.

It is not possible, even in the
depths of moral complicity (left
and right) in which we wallow
(structurally, to be sure, but
wallow none the less) to ignore
the statement which this
production makes in its very
form, to say nothing (for the
moment) of the drama of its
content.

yet spontaneous amalgam of
rules and players, stratagems
and spontaneities, and social-
ity and atomism. (It is an en»

notice the Subtle introduction, by

ontological tension of “partici-
pation and individualism?" (All

content to throw inkpots.)
Another point must be stressed
concerning the teios oi Gamé‘,
quite apart from its socio-
economic, and hence didactic,

Netmen Charge; Now 5-6

By Roger Rowe

It seemed last Saturday that
Grinnell's basketball team was
going to throw away its game
against St. Olaf in vvhat has come
to he recognized as its usual
pattern. Just the previous night,
against Carleton, the cagers
appeared to be in complete
control, dominating the boards,
playing a tough defense, and
taking good shots. Then every»
thing crumbled. Their momen-
tum ceased and then reversed,
and they wound up three point
losers to a team they could have
run off the court.

On Saturday the relentless
Swedes, Finholt and Bungaard,
brought their team back to knot
the score with only seven seconds

clearly resembling previous
Pioneer collapses But then last

As their 5-6 conference record
indicates and last week‘s games
demonstrate, it has been an up
and down season for the
Pioneers. This reporter believes
that it is going to be “up” tor
the rest oi the schedule, and
wants to pay tribute to a team
that has broken with the too-long-
standing tradition of Grinnell
losing basketball games.

To what do we attribute this
reversal of tradition? Coach
Pfitch’s strategy? New, ”pro
fessional" uniforms? Gatorade
on the bench? None of these is
too likely. The answer is among
the players, and in their newly-
iound aggressiveness and con-
iidence in their ability to play
ball with any team in the confer
ence. When they lose, they lose
fighting.

More speciiically, as goes Boh

this new aggressiveness and
confidence.

This reporter believes that the
credit for this change belongs to
players like Don Peterson and
Greg Bombinski. Donny is the
“toughest little competitor” both
on this team and in the cons
ierence. His personal flash and
determination have significantly
affected the whole team. The
Bomber is perhaps the worst
loser and most vocal critic both
of his own and of the teams'
efforts since Snowman, Roger
Able. No complacency and few
delusions of ability remain
among the players long with the
Bomber around, No one is
satisiied, and no one quits
fighting. To these two and to their
prodigy, Burnett, belong the
credit for Grinnell's resurgence
to respectability in basketball,

HuntsmenFoll To

Simpson Team

By John Nigel Pepper

Wrestling before a “crowd” of
sonic iorty souls, Maurice Hunt's
squad dropped a dual meet with
siinpson College here on Wed»
licsday. Hunt is now able to field
ninc wrestlers suited up ior
meets, up irom only four at the
start of the season. And while
this does not necessarily make
a great team, a good deal of imr
proveinent is evident, both in
individual and in team per-
inrmances as evidenced by the
2514 score of this week's meet

Chuck Farr at 116 1b,, although
wrestling cautiously, wore down
his opponent and dominated most
of llls match to win 771, Mike
Brown, a newcomer at 126, put
in a vcry strong perioi-mance and
pinned a Simpson wrestler who
showed rather more style than
skill. Grinnell wrestlers were
pinned in the next two classes
Derek Feilbert doggedly held out
but iinally went down to a con-
stdel'ably more skilled and ex-
perienced Simpson opponent,

something oi a surprise After

man in the iirst period. Corona
was rapidly muscled to the mat

Coach Hunt expressed
satisfaction at the improvement

he had entertained some hopes
