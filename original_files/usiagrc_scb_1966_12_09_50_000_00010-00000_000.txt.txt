LUCKY JlM

Sued on the novel by
Kinsley Amls;
Hurting In Cal-micillﬂ and
MTerl'yTbomas;

treated by John Faulting:

A British ﬁlm of the rather
nsophisticated variety, Lucky
km is, nevertheless, a delight-

1 Satire on the slutty academia
tradition ot a large university.

Jim (Carmichael) appears a!

young instructor, who is or
east as interested in being an
individual as in being a his-
oonan. His superiors (superan-
nuated pedagogues that they
Are) simply cannot appreciate
the new life Jim brings to the
department, Jim’s position is
by no means enhanced when
he attempts to deliver a lecture,
in soils oi being thoroughly
mashed; when he breaks up a
rand academic procession;
when he tries to hustle the
chancellor’s niece. In short,
there seems to be as little
icom tor a wacky college tun»
ter on the faculty as there is
h a student body.

Petition Decries

Leoders’ Protest

STATEMENT—

Last week, in the turmoil and
confusion following the students
leaders protest, this statement
was circulated on campus ex-
pressing reservations about the
action taken:

We the undersigned wish to
express our reservations re-
garding the action taken by
the AWS Board and mom
on Wednesday night, Novem-
2ard. The tensions of the och
casion and the rapidity of the
proceedings did not allow for
adequate deliberation on the
part or either the student
leaders or the student body:
the facts of the case and the
issues involved were neither
well enough known nor clear-
ly stated; there was confusion
in the forms of the petitions;
and the meeting oi the stu-
dents held in Ann did not.
provide an opportunity for
tormal sanction of the pro-
posed demonstration.

Because or the absence of the
President of the College, all
legal means ol recourse had
not been exhausted. As a re-
sult. the President is being
iorced to deal, under tension,
with a situation which, being
unclear to the student body,
cannot help being unclear to
him.

We hope that this statement
will demonstrate to the Priest.
dent i more deliberative atti-
tudc on the part of the stu-
dents than that suggested by
the actions hitherto taken.

When given to the President,
the total number ol signatures
was 141, about a tenth of the
campus,

On Phone Hookup

Yesterday afternoon two cola
lege classes studying Plato this
semester had a discussion of his
Sympﬂsium with an authority on
classical literature, While she
was sitting in her apartment on
Riverside Drive.

Using the College’s amplilied,
two - day, telecommunication
equipment, the students oi
Greek 312 and Philosophy 317
discussed with Protessor Helen
Bacon ot the Department at
Classical Languages of Colum-
bia University her unique inter-
pretation oi the Symposium.
Through the equipment, her
voice was amplified {or the stu<
dents, as were the questions
and comments they dizected to
her.

Professor Bacon viewed thi!
particular dialogue of Plato as
not so much about love as about
poetry and interpreted it as a
dramatic dialogue rather than a
discursive (realise. Miss Bacon
published this interpretation in
1959 iii the Virginia Quarterly
Review.
