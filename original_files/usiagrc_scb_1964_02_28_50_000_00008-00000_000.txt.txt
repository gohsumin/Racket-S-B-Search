Harlshorne ls Against Delerlninism,

Appearing as part of the

Although the Greeks “saw
nature as highly orderly." they
had little empirical evidence
for their' belief. During the
Newtonian era the startling dis<
coveries of natural regularities
made the notion of Strict deter»
minism seem “both clearer and
more credible," he said.

Any suggestion of chance or
disorder was equated with “a
mere residuum of human ignor-
ance or confused thinking,”

deterministic science and phi-
losophy ensued.

Hume, Kant, Spinoza and
Leibniz were all determinists;
it was not until the nineteenth
century that some less re-
nowned philosophers began to
credit the idea of chance.
Peirce, an American, developed
the theory of Tychism named
forthe Greek word for chance,
“Whose reality Peirce not only
affirmed, but with penetrating
reason accepted as a universal
aspect of all nature.”

In working with Darwin’s
theory of natural selection,
Mendcl’s laws of inheritance.
Gibbs' phase law in chemistry,
and the laws of quantum me-
chanics, ”a usable determin-
ism seems out of the question.”

Hartshorne believes we are
entering a new intellectual
phase in which ”terms like
chance, randomness, probabil-
ity, possibility are no longer to
be dismissed a ‘word of our ig-
norance.’ ”

Hume and Kant tried to make
“religious sense out of the
Newtonian world machine."
“The resulting religious deter-
minism led to a dual‘concept of
freedom. God's decisions are
free in that there are no condi-
tions determining them. We,
however, are free to make de-
cisions in a totally different
sense, for our acts are precise—
ly what antecedent conditions
determine them to be.

Hartshorne asserts, ”In real<
ity, neither causality nor pur-
pose is intelligible without
chance.”

“The reasonable view of cau-
sation is . . . that causal con-
ditions limit the then-and-there
possible outcomes, but do not
in advance completely define or
determine a unique outcome."
This self-determination of out-
come is 'frcedom in the meta-
physical or universal sensor"

He pointed out that “though
the particular event is by
chance, uhe‘laws or regularities
in events are not. And it is
these we need to know in ad-
vance, not the' precise events
themselves,"

Purpose is also related to
chance because purpose is es-
sentially social. There are al-

lvey Cartoon Collection Includes Work
0i Two Centuries From [1.5. and Abroad

The cartoons currently on
display in the Schaeffer Gal-
lery and in the Student Union
represent the two-century his-
tory of cartooning.

From the collection of James
Ivey, a San Francisco cartoon-
ist, the exhibit includes original
drawings from great cartoon~
ists starting with Gillray, “the
grandfather of modern political
cartooning,” and ending with
Rube Goldberg, an American
newspaper cartoonist.

The exhibit contains examples
of the work of Honore Daumier
whowas imprisoned during the
early nineteenth century for
ridiculing the French monarchy
in his caricatures.

Father of th 6 American
School of political cartooning,
Thomas Nast created many of
the symbols still used today.

ways a number of purposes
held by a number of purposive
agents,

He gave the example, “Sup-
pose A intends x and B intends
Y, and both are’ successful;
then what ensues is XY. No
one intended XY," ,

Hartshorne explained the
this formula applies even if B
is God; “His decision must con-
join with others’ in a manner
not wholly intended even by
him.”

To say that this implies weak~
ness in God is “nonsense.”
“God is not weak just because
he cannot do what intrinsicah
1y could not be done."

"Randomness is coming into
its own," Hartshorne conclud-
ed. "Should not the idea of real
freedom, creaturely and divine,
now have its opportunity at
last?"

 

The "only truly American art
form" is the comic strip, also
well represented in the collec-
tion, The first daily strip, “A.
Mutt” by Bud Fisher started in
the San Francisco Chronicle in
1907. ‘ '

The New Yorker's one-line
cartoons contributed to the
sophistication of American hu-
mor.

Throughout the history oi
cartooning, methods of repro-
ducing cartoons were chang
ing. Gillray and his contempor-
ary, George Cruickshank, used
engravings: Daulnier, lith0<
graphy; Nast, woodrcuts; and
modern cartoonists, photo en-
graving.

Circulated by the Western As-
sociation of Art Museums, the
collection will remain at Grinw
nell until March 4. .

Rube Goldberg, in a “fore-
word” to the exhibition catalog,
reiers to items in the collec-
tion as “original works of art—
and 1 say works of art advised-
1y."

”There are 'ﬂiose, unfamiliar
with the great scope of car-
tooning, who believe mat cars
t o o n i s t s are irresponsible
zanies accidentally gifted with
the facility of putting scrawls
on paper to amuse the chil-
dren. They do not realize that
it is a painstaking craft, a call-
ing that requires a vast fund
of knowledge acquired through
concentration and experience.
“Cartoons are drawn not only
to amuse but to bring a visual
understanding of human foibles
and social injustices," he adds.
