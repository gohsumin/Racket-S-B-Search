Amendment Causes
Debate In Senate

After many long and weary
minutes of debate, the Senate
passed an amendment to Article
1, Section 02 of the Student
Government Association consti~
tution Wednesday night.

The amendment, which is con—
cerned with the election of
women senators. is as follows:
“The representatives or the
women's residence halls shall be
elected no later than the third
Monday- and no earlier than the
second Monday after the start
of classes in the fall. The exact
date of election shall be set by
the Executive Cabinet.” ,

After passage of an amend-
ment by the Senate, it must
be ratiﬁed by (in per cent of
the student body and then ap-
proved by the president of the
college and by the faculty be-
fore it can become part of the
consumtion.

The bitter debate which pre-
ceded the amendments passage
was set off not so much by the
amendment itself as by the
question of just when and how
amendments shall be presentedl
to the student body for ratiﬁca<
tion. While suggestions were
made, no steps were taken at
this meeting.

Other important motions passed
by the Senate included the re—
affirmation of most of the leg»
islation passed between Sept. 1
and Sept. 30, a motion taking
$1,000 out of the general budg—
et and reserve fund for a for—

New Laundry and Cleaning
Village Opening In Grinnell

The spectacular new development in cleaning clothes .a
self~service dryolcauiug — will be introduced in Grinnell the
week of October 18 and 20 IN A SPECTACULAR GRAND
OPENING CELEBRATION AT THE NORGE LAUNDRY
: AND CLEANING VILLAGE AT 3RD AND STATE STREET
, WITH FREE DRY CLEANmG To THE PUBLIC FROM
COUPONS mom TnE HERALD-REGISTER AND GRIN~
NELL SCARLET AND BLACK. The new drycleaning serv
vine is amazing. Just: toss in an arm load of clothes, insert
six quarters, and the machine (you use your own machine)
whirls gently and quietly through a 45—minute clean and
dry cycle. You can actually watch your clothes being clean~
ed through a window in the door. The new "Village" is pr
viding complete laundry and cleaning service to the public.
The coin—operated dryclcaning unit will clean anything from
a man‘s suit to a formal evening dress. Eight separate ma-
chines are available for customer convenience.

Housewives will be able to do both laundry and dryole
ing at the new Laundry and Cleaning Village in a single v

They will also be free to par-
ticipate in any of a number of
cultural activities that abound
in the Washington area. l

any party is naturauy better
when delicious home haked
gsods from Brown's are serv-
e .

The dryeleaning machines clean eight pounds of garments
(s to la dresses) in approximately 45 minutes . . i for only
$150. The dryoleaner provides a means for the consumer to
drycleau clothes personally, at a quarter of the cost and a
fraction of time normally required.

The cleaner utilizes a specially formulated cleaning sol-
vent from a single filtration system. The solvent (known as
Norg-Clor) is constantly filtered and distilled through a
unique purification system.

One of the outstanding abilities of the machine is that
it has “bull in wrinkle-free cleaning" with only a touch-up
with a steam iron needed at most. Housewives should really
like the new and economical one-stop laundry and clean-
ing service.
