GROSSETT’S GLOSSARY OF STUDENT “SAGE

By JOHN cnosserr,
CLASSICS

‘ Students have expressed, late-
iy. an increasing interest in a
course in “human values.” if
Iuch a course should material-
ize (spiritualize), a number of
curious problems would arise
As one student remarked to
me, “What will happen to a
student who fails the course‘i’,
,Will he iorieit his right [0 be
considered hum an" other
Questions follow; for example,
would he forfeit his right to
stay in crinnell-perhaps a
,Worsc fate. And what will we do
with those who get a grade of
"D” Would you want a room-
mate, or a house president, who
gut a “D" in “human values."
Even the “Credit-Fail" system
will not help here.

One reason advanced in sup«
port for such a course is thisll
there is a failure in ”Com-
munication". The words we use
may be the same but the mean-
ings are different; or worse
-—the words are different but
the meanings are the same, only
we cannot tell. In the interests
oi greater harmony, and to
help those working to establish
a course in “human values",
I have compiled the following
glossary for meanings attached
by students to the basic comw
mon Words of academic dis-
course. it is, of course, intended
only tor the use of faculty and
administration, since students
always have a clear and pre-
cise sense at what they mean
even when they iail to com-
municate the meaning. i
thought, however, that i would
publish it instead of circulat-
ing privately. in this manner,
niudents who resent being left
out of major “policy decisions”
might feel less resentful: and
——futhermore—as i may have
mistaken a meaning or two

along the way. the student body

will have a chance to correct

me. i shall be gratotul for any
additions or corrections
