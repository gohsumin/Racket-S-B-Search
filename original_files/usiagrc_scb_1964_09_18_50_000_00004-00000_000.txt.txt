gtauss Welcomes New Students —
Stresses Maiuriiyeand Realism

l By John Wolf

l Dean of the College James
H. Stauss outlined the goals of a
ilberal education and gave
some deanly advice in a speech
welcoming this year's fresh-
man class Monday evening in
Roberts Theatre.

Staliss said that a liberal edu-
datlon liberates the mind from
i) a narrow field of informa—
tion, 2) narrow considerations
of government, and 3) boredom

“A student’s cardinal failure
in seeking a liberal education
s indifference to educational
Mndards.” Stauss said.

Stauss drew his advice to the
freshmen from observations of
nst classes. He stressed five
Kaine.

“First of all, you should be
realistic about the mathematics
of competition. Only one stun
ilent in two can be in the top
half of the class.”

Stauss then noted the aca-
Hemic and social pressures to
which all students are exposed.
He suggested that these pres-
rures help curb the tendency to
'goof off” but. that students
lhould, in a sense, budget their
pressures by not trying to do
too much.

Profs' Promotions

Three Grinnell College fac-
ulty promotions have been an-
nounced after approval by the
college's Board of Trustees

lessor to associate professor
were Dr. Luther E. Erickson,
chemistry, and Richard D.
Meyer, speech and theatre.
Meyer is also the technical di-
rector of the theatre

Instructor promoted to as:
listant professor was Arnold
Hdelberg, mathematics. All of
the promotions were effective
sent. 1.

“Look to your maturity" was
Stauss's third point of advice.
“Maturity is the capacity to
cope with the struggle between
dependence and independence,
freedom and selfrrestraint, and
dignity and personal conduct.”

“My fourth point concerns
the relationship between ma-
turity and the question of
whether you can do what is
expected- of you.

"While accepting increased
independence you can not meet
all the conflicting expectations
of you You can’t be all things
to all men. Don‘t be trapped by
what others think your abilities
to be. Declare your independ—
ence of unrealistic expecta-
tions." \

The fifth point of advice was
miscellaneous. Stauss asked
the freshmen to keep their
sense of humor, or, if they
didn’t have one, to develop oner

Finally, Stauss advised the
new students, “Don't believe
all this baloney you hear” along
the grapevine,

Following.5tauss’s address,
SGA President Phil Johnson
gave a welcoming message in
which he noted that Grinnell
has its fine reputation in part
because students in the past
have cared about the problems
outside the college community.
He cited involvement by Grin-
nellians in the nuclear test ban
Controversy, the civil rights
Struggle, and Uncle Sam's Club

Professor Kenneth Christian-
sen (biology) welcomed mem<
bers of the freshman Class into
the “biggest poker game in his
tory” and outlined educative
goals for them during the Lib
eral Arts lecture Monday often
noon in Roberts Theatre.

”Your role in this century

, concerns the success or failure

of humanity,” he said ”You
may be part of a force or a sin-
gle mover, but in either case
you will be a determiner."

The first of several New Stu-
dent Day programs in Roberts
found the freshmen filling al~
most all the seats in the theatre
as they heard Christiansien
speak about humanity as an ex
periment now facing the test of
survival. He encouraged the
campus newcomers to proceed
to fill their Own role in this
century by pursuing a liberal
arts education.

Five goals to come from
Grinnell experience named .dur—
ing the lecture and emphasized
by the speaker were:

1) learning how to educate
your self

2) achieving a calling

3) learning how to enjoy
life more fully

4) an awakening of social

consciousness

5) the maturation of moral
security.

“Education is something you
have to learn on your own and
with the tools you gain here,
you can remain 3 student the
rest of your life," he said.

In telling the freshmen that
they should learn to enjoy life
more fully during their years
at Grinnell he stated that
not all of life here concerns
time for “dalliance, drink. and
digestion.” Rather, he urged
them to cultivate a type of in-
sight so that they could deter
mine those “things which are
a joy forever and others which
leave a bad taste in your
mouth.”

Christiansen s p o k e out
strongly for racial equality
while urging his audience to
learn to live together. He spoke
of racial prejudice as a “can
car which must be stopped
now,” and registered hope that
the current educational genera»
tion could “pay on the prom.
issory note which Lincoln
signed years ago,”

In expressing a real concern

 

for world peace, the biologist
spoke out: against the ego-cen-
tricity or nations. “World gov-
ernment must come in your
lifetime or the prognosis is
grave indeed,” he warned.

Toward the fifth point, the
maturation or moral security,
Christiansen urged the new stu-
dents to start making their own
decisions and to set up a se»
ries of moral standards for
themselves. "Don’t: drift into
the sump or conformist moral-
ity.” he Said. “There is Consid-
erable latitude in this area."
Concerning the making of decis-
ions, he stressed that “privilege
can never be divorced from re-
sponsibility.‘!

Referring to those goals
which he had listed, and others
which confront incoming stu-
dents, Christiansen assured
them that the road would not
be entirely smooth, but that

To Take Their Role in Determining Fate of Humanity

they should always climb out of
the pitfalls and go on.

The proressor w a r n e d
against the “quicksand of pet-
ty activity and told the fresh-
men to “guard time as preo-
lous.”

While not degrading the spirit
of revolt, Christiansen was
Critical of misdirection in re-
voltr “Don’t, batter against
straw men such as women’s
hours or open dorms, but take
an interest in bigger issues like
race and world peace.”

Finally, he told freshmen not
to be governed by an external-
ization of their problems.
”When trouble starts, the SO:
lution starts with you, then use
sources. available here," he
said. .

“At any rate, come on strong-
ly—the future of man is in your
hands. Godspeed and good
luck,” he concluded.
