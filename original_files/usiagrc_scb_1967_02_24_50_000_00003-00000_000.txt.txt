Grinnelliuns Attend Vote Conference;
Efforts to lower Voting Age Foil

By Janet l-lala

Two Grinnell students, Mike
Dejoie and Bruce Armstrong,
attended the Iowa Conference
on Lowering the Voting Age held

last Saturday at Camp Sunny-
side in Des Moines, The confer-
ence, sponsored by the lows
Young Democrats, was attended
by high school and college stu-
dents from throughout Town.

The purpose of the conven~
non was the discussion of the

recent bill in the Iowa legisla-
ture to lower the voting age in
Iowa to eighteen. Tuesday, after

the conference, the bill was de-
feated. ,

The Grinnell students attend-
ing went as representatives of a
recently»formed Grinnell Com-
mittee for the Advancement of
Universal Suffrage at Eighteen
— CAUSE, The National Stu-
dent Association, the Young Re
publicans, the Young Demo~
crats, and the lawn Federation
of Teachers were represented
at the meeting.

State Senator John Walsh (R),
who sponsored the bill, and
State Representative Dan John-
son (D) were discussion leaders
for the conference.

Loggia Looks Remain Locked

By Paul Nachman

lf after-hours confinement of
Grinnell coeds constitutes a
fire hazard through possible one
trapment in the loggia, the col-
icge can easily install “panic
push-bars” on the loggia doors
for emergency exit, according

to Building a Grounds (3&6)
Superintendent Evan Walden,

However, the college has
plans for a crashvbar door sys—
tem for next fall that Should
solve the problem," reported
AWS Board President Karen
Lauterbach.

Walden asserted that the ex-
isting iocked-loggia arrange-
ment is safe, since the night
watchman and the housemoth-
ers have keys for the loggia
doors.

in the unlikely event that the
doors should remain lucked
during a bad, earlyunoming
fire, said Walden, the women

can traverse the loggia a long
way in either direction or they
can escape through first-floor
windows on the street side of
the Quad.

Loci-ring of die doors appar—
ently violates Section L2 of the
state firesatety regulations for
dormitories:

“aims shall be so arranged
and maintained as to provide
free and unobstructed egress
from all parts of every builds
lng 01‘ structure at all times
when the building or sti—iic-

titre is occupied. No loolcs or *

fastenings to prevent free es-
cape from the inside of any
building shall be installed on
exit doors,"

In an Sail! interview Monday,
Walden said that he was un-
aware ot this rule, emphasizing,
though. that tire prevention ii
a very strong 138:6 concern.

“They get tired of our carping
about fire hazards around
here," he noted

The tiresaiety code also di-
rects the State Fire Marshal to
make regular inspections of cole
legs iaCIlities. “The State Fire
Marshals have never inspected
our buildings.” commented Wai-
den. “Schools seem out of
bounds for them,

“It‘s the same at other
schools — they don't have in-
spections, We are inspected
twice a year by our insurance
companies." he added.

However. the February 2i
Des Moines Register reported
that State Fire Marshal Wil<
our Johnson's staff has inspect-
ed all Iowa colleges and uni-
versities, except Grinnell and
the University of iowa. within
the last two years.

Johnson plans to inspect
Grinnell sometime this spring

Other aspects of the fire-safe
ty situation on South Campus
have periodically been criticiz~
ed. Last spring Miss Lauter-
bach found that many fire ex-
tinguislieis in the women’s
halls were inoperable due to un-
derpressiire. They have since
been recharged.

She aso termed the fire es-
capes that Iead into the court-
yards between individual dorms
“a farce.” Most of them end
nine feet. above the ground —
too high for safe jumps. Sev-
eral of the courtyards them-
selves are fire traps, she adds,
because they are planted with
flammable shrubbery,

Walden explained that the fire
escapes do not reach the ground

primarily to keep children
from playing on them.

He noted that semesterly iii-o
drills on South Campus. also m-
quired by state law, have prov-
en effective in alerting the
women to emergency proced-
ures. The halls, Walden said,
can be cleared in about two
minutes

Miss Lauterbach said, how
ever, that five minutes is I
more reasonable estimate for
emptying the loggia.

The men's halls have long
violated the fire drill require.
ment; there have been no drills
on North Campus for about ten
years. according to Head Resi-
dent Terry Moore. They prob-
ably have not been reinstituted
because no one would fakl
them seriously, he speculated.

President Glenn Leggett said
Thursday that he has asked
Walden to meet with the State
Fire Marshal and that the col-
lege does not plan any action
until it receives state instruc-
tion.

President Leggett added that
Walden had assured him that
the dormitory buildings are iire<
proof and that the possibility
of fire spreading throughout the
Quad was .very unlikely.

Walden also told Leggett that
women students would not be
trapped in the event the dorm
caught on fire because the head
residents would unlock the
doors with their keys. Mr. Leg.
gett affirmed, however, that ro«
liance on a few keys to free
hundreds of students might
prove inadequate in a panic
situation,

Attenlpi to REACH Across Gulf;
College-Town Group Now Defunct

ay niyllis Murray

Defunct now except for its
high school tutoring program.
REACH was potentially one of
Grinnell's most forceful college
groups. The organization, how-
ever inactive at present, rep
resents an idealistic concern
which, though dormant, is not
entirely dead among Grinnell
students.

Begun in the tall of 1965,
REACH was the outgrowth of
student participation during the
preceding summer in a Chicago
social action program of the
same name, The Chicago pro-
iect, which had included classes,
workshops, and cultural ﬁeld-
trips for high school students
of varying backgrounds, stimu-
lated several Grinnell students
into considering a comparable
program for the Grinnell com-
munity.

An early report of the Grin-
nel REACH group described the
purposes of the organization as
“providing a basis for a coming.
together of different economic
groups" and as “providing a
new meeting ground which could
reach across old separations."

in the process of planning
specific action, the initial lead-
ers. of whom Jeanne Cook, Jane
Parish and George Wittgraf
were most active. explored ex-
isting town facilities and exist<
trig town needs. They found
found that. outside of the mov-

ie theatre, a few pizza houses,
and an Uncle Sam’s Club high
school night (which had limited
appeal and response), Grin<
nell high school students had
little opportunity for constructive
recrean‘on. -

As failures became more fre
quent, REACl-l’s hopes of pro
moting a full-time, paid com-
mllnity recreation director, in-
formal workshops and study
groups, and weekend activities
gradually dwindled The only
tangible result or any of the
effort was the addition of Sell-
ior high school tutoring to tho
already-existing junior high pro
gram.

By last fall, attempts to re
Vive REACH did not succeed
beyond the tutorial coordination
effort. Asked why REACH had
failed, neither Jeanne Cook nor
Jane Parish were able to iso-
late a reason: the problem was
simply a combination of “in-
sufficient organization,” “too
little free time." and "dlsap«
pointments leading to a general
1053 of enthusiasm."

Leaders Cook and Parish still
feel, however. that both the
students and iaculty of the col-
Iege have something to contri<
bute to the rest of the com-
munity—something more than
the tutoring programs and Uncle
Sam's Club. valuable though
these projects are, structurally
dead, REACH still exists as an
idea and an Ideal.
