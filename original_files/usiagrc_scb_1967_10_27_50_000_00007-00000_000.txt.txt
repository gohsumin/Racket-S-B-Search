NEW ELECTRON MICROSCOPE HERE

By SUSAN EDWARDS

Grinnell has spent an esti-
mated $8,000 for a used piece
or equipment which has to be
stopped each time the train
passes.

An electron microscope, to be
used by the science depart»
ments, was installed September
25, and is in use now.

Dr. Guillermo Mendoza and
Dr. Waldo Walker are the two
biology professors working with
the “highly-sensitive, finely cal-
Ibrated instrument" which, ac:
cording to Walker, is easily
thrown off by Vibrations.

Walker just completed a year
of research and work with
electron microscopes at the
University of British Columbia,
Canada. Although the micro-
scope was purchased from Har-
vard University in August, 1966,
installment was postponed until
Walker returned since he is the
only person who knows how to
Ilse it.

Grinnell’s microscope was
purchased for less than half of
its original price of $36,000.
The price of the newest model.
according to Walker, is around
$45,000.

Workmen have been busy
since this July preparing three
rooms in the basement of the
science building. Besides the
room for the microscope itself.
there is a special preparation
room and a darkroom.

A light microscope uses vis-
ible rays to reflect through the
section and magnification lenses
to “increase" the size for the
viewer. Maximum magnifica-
tion then is limited by the wave
length of the light and rarely
exceeds LOOOX.

Up to 500.000X is possible
with the electron microscope.

Larger resolving power. the
ability to discern two close
points clearly, is only possible
with shorter wave lengths, such
as electron beams.

The direction of the beam Ii
regulated by electromagnetic
lenses as contrasted with the
objective lenses of the light
microscope.

Walker noted, "The electron:
pass through a section and art
partially blocked by the vary-
ing densities of the section. Con-
sequently, thicker parts appear
lighter on the screen. The dark.
and light areas are reversed,
though, alter a photograph is
taken."

An advantage of the electron
microscope, noted Walker, "is
the ability to work in areas
other than biology, such as with
crystal, metal. or ceramic
structures."

“The involved preparation and
cutting are disadvantages. A
special instrument and light
microscope are necessary to
cut and embed the section in
hard plastics. Decompos‘on
prevents reuse of the section."

Students and faculty meme
bers will be using the micro.
scope for independent work and
research.

“It’s here as a teaching re-
search tool for anyone especial-
ly interested in cytology. Hope-
fully the research will be pub.
lishable." added Walker.

"Dr. Mendoza and I are hop-
ing to receive a National Sci-
ence Foundation Grant for a‘
program next summer. A few
interested students would 114
ceive $60 a week and credit
for their research."

“If the grant does not ma-
terialize, students may still
work for credit,” Walker com
eluded.

“We will work with any in-
terested students and faculty
members in learning the funda-
mentals of the instrument. Grin-
nell, though, is too small a
school to be able to afford a
course in electron microscopy,"
he said.

 

LAB NOTES

By DARCY KELLEY,

Science professors and science majors seem to spend an inor-
dinate amount of time in the laboratory. Too many students, strug-
gling through the mire of the science requirement is bad enough.
Spending any more time than necessary in the laboratory seems a

sure sign of incipient insanity.

Behind the doors of the science building, in the rafters or
Goodenow, something is going on. Grant proposals are written. re-
search papers are submitted and independents are perpetrated

upon the unwary department,

Rejecting, for the moment, the insanity hypothesis for sciens
tists, we can seek other inspiration for these laboratory denizens.
Electrons can excite. compounds can compel, fishes can fascinate
and even rats have something to “say" if approached in the right

fashion.

Grinnell shelters much faculty and student research. What is
happening and why? Answering these questions will be the object

of Lab Notes.
