E Hall Secedes from Carleton Women’s League E

By Paul Nachman

Sentiment that student govern-
ment is responsible ior enforc-
ing only rules oi its own cro—
nlion has provoked extensive

Inﬂghtiug within the Women's
League (WL) It Carlelon Col~

According to the weekly
Carletonian, the women stu-
dents are essentially in agree-
ment on the role and responsi-
bilities of their government. But
1 Women's League Council
(comparable to Grinncll’l AWS
Board) decision to deter stu-
dent rule-making until the tall

aroused the women of Evans
Hall, whose members favored

his CRICKETT to be sp

immediate change, to tempo-
rarlly secede ll'om the League.
Since proponents of student
participation in college social
policyamaking face an uphill
hattle against a stubborn Carle-
ton administration. several stu-
dent leaders expressed fear
that Evans' radical move would
only hamper their eiiol'ta {or
change,

Said Carleton Student Asso«
ciatlon President Eric Janus in
a statement for the Carletonian;
"Our goal or student partici-
pation in the determination or
college policy has little support
among those in power. We must
not weaken our position by
clouding the issue. The students
in Evans ought to give their
support and cooperation to a
forthright move by all women

WL President Ann Medinger
said, “The grievance in Evans
is really with Women’s League,
not with administration, on this
occasion."

In mid-February Carleton \vo-
men Voted to redeﬁne WL, our

as an organization solely repre-
scnt'dtive or the interests at the
Women students with no direct
respons y to the college
administration.

“This redefinition," explain-
ed Miss Medinger, “resulted
from serious consideration oi
the value of Women’s League’n
role in enlorcing college regu-
lations which it has no say in
making.”

Apparently, no specilic time
was set for the "redefinition"
so Women's League Council
decided to institute the change
next fall.

This decision to deter. action
was not supported by the entire
council. Several members, cons
corned that the college might
institute a paid proctor system
by next tall, urged that the
Council hold A second referem

Weekend
Film

WWW««
By Dale Dreyruss

This weekend, the big, silver
screen brings us Federico Fol-
lmi's La Strada.

This is Fellini’s iourth tllm
(1954). and it has been con-
sidered by some critics, along
with Nights of Cablria, to rap-
resent the apex of development
for both the director and the
Italian neorealist movement.

Using the extremely realis-
tic, otten stark settings and
compositions that were the base
materials {or his earlier ef-
lorls, F. F. also uses protes—
sional, often stylized acting to
achieve a synthesis that reveais
the delicate human emotion of
loneliness as it contrasts to the
bare, unieeling “streets" down
Whlcll we all walk.

he that as it may, the story
concerns the peregrmations of
a simple-minded girl clown and
a poor side show strong-man
who is presently out at work,
The clown without a laugh and
the strongman with only phys-
ical strength are archetypes, i
suppose, but Fellini works them
denly in the context of on
isolated, travelling circus. Like
most or his films, the central
ideas of La Strada are sus-
pended in the mood and at-
mosphel‘e rather then plunging
forth through the action; but
here, at least, the director ls
able to treat his subject Wilh-
out muddling it in the heavy-
hnnded cacophyony oi the sweet
liie. This is Fellini in control,
which is Fellini at his has.
(50 shoot me.) .

La Strada goes on Friday at
lD':0[I pm. and Sunday at
9.00 pm. It's an awiully good
ﬂick. See it.
