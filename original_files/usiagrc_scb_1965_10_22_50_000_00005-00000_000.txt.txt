SCARLET AND BLACK

By PAUL ROBERTS

Recently I had the good fortune
to conduct a unique interview. It
was an interview between myself,
a Peace-in»VieteNam picket, and
a Hell’s Angelr

Normally I wouldn’t print this
interview because it doesn't really
apply itself too well to Grinnell life.
It deals with war. peace, life,
death, and other matters of simi-
lar lack of consequence to came
pus lire at Grinnell. 1 print it
because of a sudden interest in
these matters on campus Just
last week I heard reference to
Viet Nam in the lunch line And
then again this week passing ref-
erence was made in a political
science class—or was that Indo—
china that he mentioned?

Anyway, the interview was con-

slugged a Hell’s Angel who had
called him a narne that would

cataleptic. The Hell’s Angel type
was arrested when he called the
policeman the same name.

i asked the Hells Angel type
why his group had endorsed Pres-
ident Johnson's Viet Nam policy.
He paused in what I thought was
an unusually thoughtful manner
and reflectively rubbed his leit
armpit. “I think," he said, Brando
style, “it's because any guy who
drives it car nlnety-miles-an-llour
while drinking beer can’t be all
bad.”

I paused to see if that was a

laugh. Evidentally it was because
he called me that same name he
uses so much. '

I turned to the Peacein-Viet—
Nam»type who was also rubbing
his armpit reﬂectively—the only
thing the two had in common.
"Why were you staging a neckein
on the steps of the Convent?”

“We were protesting U.S. in-
volvement in Viet Nam and the
immoral method of forced con-
scription oi people who had no
voice in making the decisions that
ellect and well may take their
lives."

“But on the steps of a convent?
Aneck-in?

“Yeah,” interrupted the Hell's
Angels “Those poor horny broads
all locked up inside having to
watch you jerks make a display
of yourself and them not being
able to join in and being tortured
and all.”

“Wait,” I said. “We’re not get-

But they didn’t hear me. They

to say, it he telt like moralizing,
