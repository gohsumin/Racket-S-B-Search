Dominick: Issues May Be Clouded
By Concentration on Personalities

Announcing his intention to
“concentrate on the issues of
the campaign," Senator Peter
H. Dominick attacked the Ken-
nedy-Johnson Administration in
his speech Tuesday night in
Darby Gym.

Highlighting the annual Ree
publican Day activities, his ad»
dress covered morality in gov-
ernment, decentralization of
government, and foreign policy
— topics he termed “great is-
sues of the campaign some
times obscured by concentra—
tion on the personalities of
President Johnson and Senator
Goldwater."

He cited the Bobby Baker
case, involving the alleged
kickback of DC, Stadium in-
surance money to the 1960
Democratic campaign fund, as
an example of questionable
morality among high officials.

He feels the refusal of several
Democratically controlled Con—
gressional committees to in-
vestigate the case indicates that

‘ one party‘s overwhelming dome

inance in Congress may tend to
weaken its integrity

Thus he believes, ”We need
to strengthen the voice oi the
minority party.”

Moving onto the topic of de-
centralization of government,
the Senator inquired, “Why
should all the power he concen-
trated in the hands of a few
sell-anointed experts in Wash—
ington when this country has
been built on the ambition and
creativity of millions?"

He charged the Administra-

‘ lion’s War on Poverty with "ate

tempting to create a whole big—
ger than the sum of its past;”
neglecting the differences in the
problem of poverty in different
areas of the country by ”trying

‘ to put a blanket over the whole

us."

He asserted the high school
dropout section of the poverty
program ”provides the dropout
with food, housing, money, and
education." thus encouraging
more students to leave school.

“We only help the ones who

flunk the course," he said.
“Those who do the work and
stay in school get no as-
sistance."

He criticized the present Ad-
ministration‘s fiscal policies.
”Foreign officials say to us, ‘
‘Why don’t you balance your
budget?’ as if it were very sim«
ple “

"We will never balance the
budget if we reelect the Demo-
crats," he declared. drawing
applause from the audience
which included Republicans
from all over lowa. "The Dem-
ocrats have a I r e a d y pro-

grammed four inore years of
deficit spending "

“The United States has suf-
iered defeat after defeat all
over the world," he contended,
introducing the foreign policy
issue.

Although he praised Presl<
dent Kennedy's inauguration
address for its firm words
against Communism, Domin-

ick feels the late President‘s _

actions in Laos and Cuba failed
to fulfill his inaugural pro-
mises.

of Viet Nam he said, “We
don‘t have a policy as to why
We are there and What we are
going to do. Yet we keep send»
ing our soldiers over there."

He complained of the sale of
His. wheat to Russia on the
basis that the United States did .
not benefit from it enough.
“Let’s get something from them
in return instead of merely aC<
commodating our position to
their's.”

The Senator ended by quoting
Hans Morgenthau: “We walk
these empty skies from which
the gods have departed," and
expressing the desire that the
American people will not elect
a government which would lead
to such a world.
