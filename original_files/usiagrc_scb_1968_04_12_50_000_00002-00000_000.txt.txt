Colonel Leggett’s Return
From The Plantation

That President Glenn Leggett was in Mississ-
ippi — the traditional bastion of White Supremacy
-— at the time of Dr. Martin Luther King‘s death is
I matter of coincidence.

That he traveled 1,100 miles from Grinnell to
the Gulf Coast for a meeting is a matter that might
have escaped all notice, were it not for the national
publicity and national remorse attending Dr. King’s
murder and funeral.

That Leggett went to the meeting in Pasca-
goula at all (see story, PAGE FIVE)) is a matter
of concern for everyone at Grinnell College.

The conference that the president attended was
a board of directors meeting of the Associated Col-
Ieges of the Midwest (ACM), an organization ~—
we need scarcely point out — that has no members
farther south than Grinnell, la. — let alone in
Southernmost Mississippi.

Whether or not Leggett was a party in decid-
ing on the site of the meeting; whether or not he
had to attend as Grinnell‘s official emissary to the
ACM; whether or not a national tragedy occurred
during his sojourn; whether or not he enjoyed his
excursion — the editors of the 5&3 agree with the
faculty members and students at Grinnell that the
trip to Pascagoula, Miss. “was not a very good idea
at all.”

If Beloit College President Miller Upton -—
the man who allegedly slated the ACM conference
at Pascagoula — or President Leggett or any other
president of an ACM college wants to spend his va-
cation in Biloxi or Pascagoula or Las Vegas or
whereever, that’s his own business —- when he’s
acting as an individual.

But as a representative of a liberal arts college
supposedly trying to keep rapport with —and re-
cruit more of — Negro students, he has no business
going to Mississippi at the time of Dr. King's death
or any other time.

And, as members of an association of Mid-
western schools, the colleges involved had no busi-
ness letting their representatives spend college
funds on the Gulf Coast.

In the world of athletics, representatives of
groups, agencies, universities, and colleges have
been known to boycott games, meets, and confer-
ences in segregated locales and at segregated estab-
lishments. When White and Negro athletes boycot-
ted the track and field meet sponsored by the seg-
regated New York Athletic Club earlier this year,
educated people everywhere applauded their ac-
tion,

The S&B would have applauded Leggett had
he boycotted last week’s ACM conference in Miss-
lssippi.

Leggett and other representatives of the ACM
were rooming in Longfellow House — an erstwhile
plantation and presently a discriminatory hotel-
motel in Mississippi. That they were there at a
time of national tragedy — tragedy particularly for
Black Americans—adds injury to insult.

Welcome home from the plantation house, Col-
onel Leggett. We hope you enjoyed your trip, and
now that you’re back on campus the editors of the
8&3 hope you don't have even more problems com-
municating with our Negro students than you had
before your Mississippi vacation.

Originally slated (or 1 pm,

ROTC Deiended

Sir: I feel as a member oi the
ROTC delachmenli here on the
Grinneli campus, 1 should re-
spond to the recent statements
of me Ptemrlaclyl. it nothing
else. I just emphasize the ne-
cessity to mainlain the right
of any person to arrive 31' his
own system or beliels, and . . .
to voice his beliefs and act
accordingly.

Yet those who seek io re»
move ROTC irom Grinnell deny
this right to persons who do
not believe as they do. They
would deny the opportunity 01
a person to make some valu-
able use of the time he must
spend in me military, They
reply that there is 075, but it
is nearly impossible to get inio
0T5 now.

I would like to comment on
Indoctrination and Curriculum.
The rorc deparlmeni has
acted on student opinion in the
courses and activities iar more

Friday. April l2. me

than any other department 0!
which I am aware at Grin-
hell.

If a cadet displays confusion
or objections to the program
(Mr, Walters refers to this as
a “bad attitude”), a cadel oi.
iicei . . .tries to explain why
something is done in a paroch-
lar way. It the cadei has it
suggestion, it is considered.

I spent some time talking It}
Duncan Waiters last semester.
He understood his contract
from the beginning. Although
I disagree with his statemenls
I respect his opinions and leel
that if his beliefs are sincere,
he made the right decision in
leaving ROTC.

The statements concerning
his fate in the Pierodaclyl are
highly exaggerated. Waiters
cannot be tried as a deserier
or a traitor. Skinner can ﬁnd
no laws military or civil, which
make such action legal. Tho
Ptemdactyl has engaged in mis-
representation to create their
own picture of ROTC. The slam
men: on “attitudes which make
one capable of killing in rim:
of war" and on high-school
sign-ups to eliminate cadets
with the “wrong‘ attitude are
completely false.

The ROTC course does not
attempt to prepare cadets for
killing. The curriculum aims
at preparing managers and
leaders »— not soldiers.

Let me close with one last
remark. i don‘t plan an Air
Force career and have no
great compassion for the mil~
itary and the job they must do.

i maely believe that all per-
sons are entitled to free thought
and action regardless of the
fact that ii may be considered
“conservative” and “immoral"
by the “liberals." If the 11de
cales I)! this “morality" deny
this right to others then
they seek in eliminate an op.
posing point or view — me
very act which may condemn
ill ROTC.
