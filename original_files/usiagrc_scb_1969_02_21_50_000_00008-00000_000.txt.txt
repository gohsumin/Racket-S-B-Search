All Educators — No Teachers

By TED GLICK

rho Education Project, while working
to formulate proposals for educational
and curricular change, is providing an
example of a new and forward-looking
class structure (or rather, non-struc-
ture). Instead of the usual class proces
dare ot a teacher assuming a role of
authority, directing questions, and/or
channeling the discussion into areas
which he considers important, our
nlxss is run with no leaders and with no
set pattern.

The class sets hours to begin but sets
no hours to end. We end when we have
nothing else to discuss — no bells and
no decisions to break up made by the
teacher bother us (we have no teacher;
Mr. Liggett, the faculty member lne
valved, is just another human being ins

cording to his ability and volition). We
have a goal in mind. i.e,, writing up pm¢
posals for change, but we move towards
these goals as the group wishes to, not
with a well-defined and structured plan
and with the necessary research and
work being carried out as each individ~
ual or small group of individuals seal
ilt; we have no assignments, papers, or
textbooks.

The thing which will be hard for many
people to understand is the fact that we
really are learning, moving somewhere,
and participating in a common educa-
tional experience. We are learning not
just of books and of how to write up
proposals, but also or people and their
lives and their feelings. It is this, this
knowledge oi what a life really is, not
just what a mind says, which is one of
the most beautiiul consequences of this
class.

Faculty Approves Greater Student Voice

By JANET SMITH

The iaculty made several decisions
of significant Interest to the student
body at their meeting Monday night.
The cut penalty for missed classes on
days surrounding holidays was abolished.
No student now attending Grinnell is re-
quired to accumulate more than the
standard 124 credits required for gradua
ation. it was implied by the faculty's
statement that this decision is to be e!»
iective retroactively.

of tar more importance are the
changes made concerning student re<
presentation on the Committee on Ad<
missions and Student Aid and the Educa‘
tlonal Policy Committees (EPC). Last
week a letter distributed by Tom Thom-
as, SGA president, urged students to in-
dicate to the iaculty the need ior stu~
dent participation on the admissions
committee. Mr, Waldo Walker, chairman
of this committee, informed the student
body in a campus memorandum that he
was aware oi student interest. He stated
that the Committee on Faculty Organize:
tion was preparing a proposal to to-
structure tho committee in question. in-
cluding provisions for student involve-
ment. Thomas commented that he ielt
the resultant student-iaculty descussion
was beneficial, as "such communication
—- oi desires. interests, and proposals —
is the tirst important step towards my
tual student participation in the tin-going
process of governing the College,"

The iaculty also passed a recommenda-
tion reorganizing the original Committee
on Admissions and Student Aid. A com-
mittee by that name will no longer deal
with administrative matters, but will be
responsible ior making recommendations
to the President and iaculty on admis-
sion and student aid policy. This cone
mitteo would receive regular reports
irom the Director oi Admission and Stu‘
dent Aid ooncerning the current FNCG‘
dures. Membership on this committee
will include the Dean oi the College,
Chairman oi the iaculty. three elected
faculty members, three students seleot<
ed by the Student Government Associa-
tion, the Director of Admissions, and the
Director oi Student Aid. The fact that
the SGA is to appoint the students gives
new importance to student government
in the opinion of one iaculty member.

ADDRESS HEI'iii

An Admissions Board consisting o1
three faculty members and the chem
tor ot Admissions was formed to deal
with administrative matters. They will
decide on all special cases in admis‘
siooa and student aid which fall outside
the guidelines at official policy. They
would also make suggestions tor the for.
mutations of policy, help in the adminin
stretlon ot policies, and report the num-
ber oi cases they act upon to the Com-
ynitteo on Admission and Student Aid.
This restructure eliminates the necessity
of students using confidential files, which
has been a major objection to student

arilcipatlon in the past. This proposal
tr not yet ofilclal. it was voted upon as
a recommendation to the President:A
which he is to transmit to the trustees.

Each divisional EPC will now have two
voting student members, as the result ct
still another iaculty decision. Each dlvl~
sion will decide its own methods 0!
selection. Trwo probabilities are an elec-
tion of the majors at a division and the
selection of two students from a student
arc which may be created.

Students are now represented on every
iaculty committee relevant to student
interest except the committee on acor-
demio standing. One pmtessar comment-
ed. “students now have a real opportun-
ity to express their voice in campus at:
fairs and policies.‘|
