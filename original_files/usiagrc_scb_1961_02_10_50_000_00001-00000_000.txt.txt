standing is illustrated by folk
sayings, for example, “Happy
is he whose sin is pardoned.”
Rabbi Rosenthal went on to
illustrate the relationship be-
tween rcligioii and psychiatry.
“Bath See that love heals,” he
said, “And that hate hurts.”

The need to love others as ex-
pressed in the words, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thy-
Self” is now a form of psychiat—
ric medicine. ”Love is a tonic,
while hate is a poison," Dr.
Rosenthal said, “a poison that
harms the hater more than the
hated,"

Dr. Rosenthal’s second speech
in the chapel at 11:00 Wednese
day morning was devoted 1.0 the
subject, “The New Religious
Dialogue and our Political
Scene." The talk centered around
a recent visit to Germany which
he made with several other
American clergymen at the re
quest of the Bonn government.

Dr. Rosenthnl spoke of the
deep feelings of guilt and
frustration which people ex-
perience today as n result of
the atrocities committed by
the Nazis before and during
the Second World War,

Such feelings, according to Dr.
-osenthal, are creating new and
dynamic changes. instead of the

with a rally reminiscent of Fan}
Revere's ride, the delegates to
t h c
made their final ammendments
and accepted the proposed con—
stitution.

The final meeting convened

a few minutes after l am. at
which time the chair felt that
a quorum had struggled into the
lauditorium. On every hand, dele—
gates were glancing over their
mates or checking amendments
which they planned to propose.
On one hand could be counted
the number of interested sper—
tators who had come to watch
lthe working out of problems on
lthe document which they were
soon to vote for or against.
1 Chairman Gary Thurston ex-
»,tended an informal message from
the deans, reminding the delee
gates that once in every three
'or four years a high pitch of
excitement and accomplishment
has been built up in the form
of‘ a constitutional convention,
only to trail off into ineffective—
ness as the delegates wear down
‘from the constant pressure.

Thurston then asked that
delegates give their entire at~
tention to the problem before
them, and the five and one
half hour siege was underway
with the calling of the roll.

The name of the proposed
governing body was changed in
the preamble to read the Grime
nell College, Student Govern.
,ment association, and then the
lredundant first article was
lstrichen from the record.

Changes in wording were made

ment in the membership section
of the legislative article, the
meetings and procedure section,
parts one and six, with the dele—
tion of part seven. Part four of
the officers and duties section
was also deleted.

Other substantial changes un-
der the legislative article set
part one of the election section
to read, ”the speaker of the sen—
ate shall be elected by the sen-
ate, at the first meeting followV
ing installation of the ncwly
elected men’s representatives
from those submitting petitions
‘to the S.G.A. president at that
time. He shall be a iunior who
has maintained a gradopointav—
eragc of at least 2.0.” Under in.
stallation, part one, the speaker
of the senate wa: included.

In the cxccutive article, now,
the cabinet was set to meet
weekly. Section 13., subordinate
bodies, was included, to read,
“the subor nate executive bod—

  
    

'ies Shall be the AWS board, and

Coil-IF which shall be Comprised

 

  

ctive residence halls and
house councils which oper-

 

the '

Constitutional convention‘

in an effort to polish the docue'

Under the section on offices,
the qualifications of the social
coordinator were struck, and
composition was changed to
read, “1. Composition

”Permanent members of this
board shall be the members of
:the executive cabinet, the stu—
.dent deans and activity director.
:There shall also be three stu—
dents and three faculty meme
bers at large. The chairmen of
the student social committees
may also be invited to advise
the planning board.

2, Selection of
large

The students at large shall
be selected by the senate at
the first meeting in the fall
from those submitting applica—
tions to the senate, The facul—
ty members at large shall be
selected by whatever means
the faculty desires."

Part six was changed to read,
under duties, “an AWS Board
member shall be the head ad-
ministrative officer in her resiv
dence hall." Part seven w a s
written to include other enforce.
ment power. “Other enfor e-
ment power may be vested in
those persons so designated by
the CofHP and AWS board on
their respective campuses.”

Under the Judiciary article,
now in, membership, part two
was changed to read, “the dean
of men and the dean of women
shall be invited to meet with
the men’s and women's primary
courts respectively in an adviSA
cry Capacity.“ Part three was
added, “two faculty representa-
trves shalt be invited to meet
with the high court in an ad.
visory capacity.”

Under powers and duties, parts
‘twc and three were combined,
as were parts four and five.

Article VI, dealing with ani—
mcndrncnt and ratification now
reads in section B, amendments
to this constitution may be pro—
posed in the following manners:
by petition of at least 10 per
cent of the student body; by a
lmajority vote of the student
isenate; by the president of the
college and onedhalf the faculty;
or by a constitutional convene
tion.
At 5:10, the convention was

and was recessed for fifteen
minutes for the purpose of
