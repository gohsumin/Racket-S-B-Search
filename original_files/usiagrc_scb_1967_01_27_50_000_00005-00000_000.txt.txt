The time has come to estab-
lish the student revolt at Grin-
nell.

Sanctiilionieus domination of
student lite is a condition that
can no longer be tolerated by
responsible students. Tile lii'iioV
Cris) of an administrative agen-
cy that speaks with one tongue
about conciliation and mean»
iligtiil negotiation and with
another tongue about the (tiles
tion of “\ihetlici‘ open dorms
should exist 3L all.” can no
longer be acceptcd as a neces-
sary evil. Student frccdom can
no longer be sacrificed to main-
tain "good relations with the
deans," or “the good name of
the college." The urgency at a
revitalization of student aware-
ness and concern for the state
of the entire college environ-
ment cannot be over-estimated.

We can no longer depend on
the good faith of the adminis-
[ration oi' the compassion of
the faculty to solve what is es-
sentially a student concern.
Agents of reaction who suggest
that revolt is immoral because
of an implicit social contract
neglect the nature of the proli-
lems that confront the Grinnell
student. The promises in the
catalog of a “closely knit come
mullity," “self-government,"
and “education considered as
an organic whole” have not
been realized, and the attitudes
that serve to stiﬂe these oh~
Jectives can no longer be toler-
ated by responr‘ ile students of
the colleg"

Those who see the Consequenc-
es of the present course have
two alternatives, The ﬁrst is
disengagement from the prob»
lems of the college. This abdi-
cation or responsibility appears
to be the most common reselli-
tion at the dilenina that we
face. The second alt .Jative is
Io “work inside i. change."
This no longer means a trite
plea tor student involvement.
Rather, it is the call to radical
revolt — a campaign against
the suppr 1 of our some
and intellectual life,

The apparent acceptance by
the administration, and passive
acceptance by the iaculty, of
Grinnell as a second-rate iris-
titution, imposes the burden o1
change upon the students.
Without radical changes this
college will at..dct no genuine

guided by our old reputation
will not find a community. but

stagnant Environment. Those
who stay will move ff campus.

in the 1 licies and Ztitudes of
the college may seem to con-
tradict some of the mores or
traditions at the trustees, (were

ask that these changes be seen
in the light of the demands of
a newly evolving society and
the aims of liberal education.
