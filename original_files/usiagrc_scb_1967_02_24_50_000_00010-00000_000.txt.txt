not relevant to the problem
because available funds would
be diluted only for 2 R E. com-
plex.

The swimming pool is one of
the most economical features
of the proposed P. B. complex.
It is cmcltornrshapod allowing
students and competitive swim-
mers to use the pool simultane-
ously. The pool, excellent from
the double standpoint of
teaching I n d recreational
swimming, is to have I con-
stant 4'~5' depth in all parts
or the pool except the diving
bay. An instructor could there~
fore teach in almost any part
of the pool,

Only a small amount of tlma
i! spent actually swimming
during recreational swimming
periods. By having the pool at
the proposed depth, conges-
tion would be relieved from
the sides a! the pool. Finally,
because of unilorm depth, this
pool can be built for the same
price as a conventional rec-
tangulir pool with 2/3 01 its
area used as deep waterr

A great deal or controversy
has developed over the priority
and cost of the P, E. complex,
These two areas are closely re-
lated. The P. E. complex has
been on the priority list since
19614 It has been pushed aside
several times. However, at this
moment the opportunity for a
half million dollar federal
grant and the increasing costs
of construction (4%76% au-
nuAlly according to Donald
Lambie, Treasurer of the Col-
lege) have placed the P. E,
complex at the top 0! the
priority list. According to
President Glenn Leggett, edu-
Eationnl need determines the
priority." President Leggett
feels that at this moment, in
relation to the need 101' a R
E complex, we have adequate
library. classroom, and oliicc
facilities.

Cost

comparatively speaking, the

. cost ot the P. E. complex is

not gxu‘avnglnt, Tbs cost per
square root oi the proposed
complex ($20) when compared
with the coat pel- aouarc loot
oi the library ($25). Forum
($30), Ind the Fine Arts Cen-
ter ($32) does not seem un-
reasonable. When compared
with other colleges' facilities,
our proposed complex is typi<
all. For example, according to
John Prilscn, Carlton has a so;

000 sq. ft, women‘s gym, a 57,.
000 sq. it. men’s gym, and a
40,000 Sq, ft. fieldhuusev (All
figures are approximations).
St. Olaf has a 115,000 sq. it.
complex in addition to a 40.-
000 sq, ft. Kym. Our complex
would be roughly comparable
to that of each school in our
contarence except onmouth,
whose present iaci ties lire
considered to be worse than
ours.

Emphasis on individual
sports participation is great at.

Ed. hcply:

Richard Wickstrom, liko
most proponents oi the PE.
complex proposal, continues to
view his plan in all its isolated
glory.

My editorial attempted to
View the place of the complex
in a “total environment" —— a
theme which Mr. Wickstrom
obviously missed, He continues
to justify the elaborate plans
for the complex in terms o2
so-callcd needs. He still fails
to consider the principal ques-
tion # that of emphasis and
degree.

Since Mr. Wicksu-om chooses
to pick apart the plans rather
than deal with the issues i
suppose I am obligated to
discuss the matter on that
lcval once more. I can cnly
repeat that thrcc new gyms
can not help but duplicate
Darby many times over,

That the complex could de-
tract trcm expenditures on oth-
er buildings is acknowledged
by President chgctt. He says

i that if th'd college does not get

the expected funds it could he

own.
