Students’ critique oiiaculty l

Scholarship repaymen’r lashedj

rule's ius‘iifica’rion demanded

To the Editor:

In his recent statement re.
garding student responsibility
and maturity, President Bowen
changed the student body with
the task of thoroughly and care-
fully examining their obliga-
tions to the Grinnell commun-
ity and to the “outside world”
beiore proposing any specific
changes in the college's social
regulations.

1N MAKING this statement
Dr. Bowen has opened himself
to a similar appeal, and i should
like to take this opportunity to
put forth such a challenge.

Speciﬁcally, I should like to

A Merry and Sport
Chrisfmus from

:encourage the faculty and ad—
.ministration to Seriously consid-
er the value of the present reg-
ulation regarding the repayment
of scholarship funds in the event
that a student wishes to trail?
tier.

The regulation, as ii. now
stands, requires that a student
who receives money from the
college must repay his total

school,

This regulation is clearly
indicative of the college’s lack
of confidence, for it demon.
strates the college’s fear that
Students may find Grinnell to
be slightly less than the uto-
pia which the President‘s
comments so frequently pic-
tllre ii: to be.

This restriction demonstrates
that the “corporation" responsi-

To the Editor:

1 wish to direct this letter to
the anonymous writer (in the
.Dec. 7 5&3) who suggested that
we evaluate the faculty. Granted,
he may have received the un—
fair treatment he complained of;
however, he has no right to
,condemn the whole faculty.

First of all, the teacher

should not have to spend his
time “challenging" students at
this point in their education.
This should have ended in
grade school. There is also i
something to he said for sound,
amount of learning on one‘s
own initiative.
1 suggest that the “Concerned
lstudent“ set up a committee to
decide upon the pay scale for
the faculty, based upon their
class attendance.

Perhaps a bonus could he
given to the professor who
would hand out the largest
bundle of intellectual curiosity ,
during the academic year,
‘ taking into consideration the
, amount of preparatory courses
r they have on their record,

, mu ONLY possible justifica-
tion for Lhis regulation is that
the college desires to protect its
invesLment in the student on
scholarship. Yet what does this
argument amount to? The stu—
dent is to be regarded as a
financial investment, to be used
for the benefit of the college,
and jealously guarded against
‘the appealing aspects of other
schools.

I fail to see how any educa-
tional institution which operr
ates on this assumption can
possibly have the audacity to
call itself hoth liberal and
progressive.

I openly challenge any me
her of the faculty or admin -
tration to justify this regulation
to the student body, for i fall

deeply committed to the ed -
cation and preparation of thei -
dividual can possibly allow such
a rule to exist.
