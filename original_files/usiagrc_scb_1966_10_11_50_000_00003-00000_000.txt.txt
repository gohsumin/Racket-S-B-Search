challenge of Freedom

Students are then faced with the
most demanding challenge —- the
nnibitious task of improving our total
ovlronmont and redefining student
positions and actions within it. The
freedom gained by a proposal for un-
restricted women’s hours would not
be an easy freedom. The construction
of personal standards is a difﬁcult but
creative and worthwhile activity. it
will require not only the receptivity of
student government leaders and ad-
ministration to creative innovations
but the commitment of the entire com-
munity, particularly the student ele-
ment, to the search for the immense
potenﬂal berlele to be found in the de-
mands or student responsibility.

dependence, we can discover by our«
selves new methods to release student
energy and creativity. an that is re.
quired is a dedication to the idea that
students can leach themselves and
each other. A commitment to this
idea will open new paths to the en.
richntent of our student culture
through me development of intellec-
tual activity outside the classroom.

Two specific Iorms which student in-
tcllectual activity can take are inde-
pendent, interdisciplinary seminars and
a voluntary, student organized interim
period devoted to independent study.
Student seminars can meaningiully ex-
plore in a scholarly iasbion subjects that
are now ignored by or insuliicienily han-
died within the present curriculumr

Several students have already suggest-
ed a number of imaginative topics on
which the interdisciplinary approach
could be used. They include the 101-
lowing:

The effect of the development of
science on the role and tone oi
religion.

Euthanasia.

Studies in current non - ﬁction.
Urban studies.

The Darw' an Revolution.
The genetic control of human life.

The effect of language, per se, on
the divergent. inteuectual develop-
ments between linguistic groups.

Birth control.

Studies in the problems of moderni-
zation of underdeveloped areas This is
certainly not exhaustive, but suggests
instead the abundance oi possible suba
jects around which student seminars can
be organized.

Overall Perspective

interdisciplinary studies not only pro-
vide a useful approach to special sub-
jects of scholarly concern but also offer
a means by which students can gain a
sense oi the relationship between their
discipline and other disciplines. Con-
Sequently, this approach is a step in
achieving the liberal arts objective oi
giving students an overall perspective
on the World.

These seminars are most Valuable as
a learning exerience ii the major iorcs
behind them is Student motivation to
gain an understanding oi subjects be-
yond those covered in the classroom. At
student organized seminars, faculty
members would play only a minimal
role that would not extend beyond an ad—
visory capacity. The demands on the
facuily would not exceed the contribu-
lion that a member of the iaculiy would
wishvm make because oi his or re:

scholarly interest in the subject treated
by a seminar.

Voluntary interim

The goals of an enlivened student cul-
ture and the creation of an intellectual

community would also be served it we
students organized a voluntary interim
session during, perhaps, the last week oi
Christmas vacation. Such a period
would allow time for students, who ap-
plied for the session, to pursue indepen-
dent study and reading. A number at
student programs could occur during the
period. It would be a valuable time for
the organization of independent student
seminars for second semester. Special
fine arts workshops, a student art show,
and small concerts given by Grinnelilans
would be worthy and creative activities
for the session.

Students could present papers, possi-
bly irom work done in previous inde-
pendent projects, to student discussion
groups. Discussions on a significant and
controversial hook, assigned (or the in-
terim session, would provide an ac-
tivity tor all participants. Oii - campus
weliare projects in Grinneli or Des
Moines could be organized during the
interim period. Most importantly, the
session would provide a time free of
curricular pressures wh en students
could actively and creatively contribute
to the transformation of the College into
a community,

Independent seminars and a student
organized interim session are but two
of several possibilities for student
intellectual activities. Scholarly clubs
and discussion groups could prolifer-
ate on campus. Student soap ~ box
debates would be lively outlets for
student. ideas. All these activities
would improve our student culture and
would deepen the intellectual experi-
ence involved in a Grinneil education.
The success of such activities is con-
tingent, however, on the acceptance
by students of the challenge implicit
in the realization that we can learn on
our own and that we can learn, in
a cooperative manner, from each
other.

Declare Independence

it we students declared our independ-
ence from the established curriculum by
developing independent intellectual e
deavors, we could indicate to those i
voived in the revision of the curriculum
the potentialities of allOWlng S t Ll d en t
energies freer rein. The positive nature
of providing more room in the cur-
Ticuium lor greater individual develop
ment and innovation in scholarly eliorts
could be illustrated by student contribu—
tions to the intellectual liie of this col»
lege. More speciﬁcally, student inter-
disctplinary seminars could point to the
inclusion in the curriculum of these
types of studies.

In the weeks ahead, the Academic
Life Committee oi the Senate will be
exploring innovations that might help
change Grinneli irom a college into an
intellectual community. The committee
Will be concerned with both Curricular
revision and intellectual activities aut-
slde the classroom.

limits. Those limits are to be determined
by a necessary consideration and con-
cern ior others. But freedom is recipro-
cal and also involves respect for the
freedom of others.

Discussion in the future Should not be-
gin with the idea oi 24 hour restriction
but with an ideal of Z4 hour (readout of
movement. Open dorms should not be
conceived as a privilege, but as due and
natural. Beginning with an assumption
of 24 hour opens or natural, alld that is
the assumption made by home-owners
and aparimeni dwellers beyond the cam-
pus. we must then determine what re-
Strictions al'e necessitated by considera-

, lion for others.

Some limitations are considered neces-

sary in our dormitory situation. Weekday
evening, which are times oi study for
most, can probably be legitimately dis-
tinguished tram weekend evenings in
which substantial numbers engage in so-
cial activiiies. Late evening and morning
hours are times when undue traffic in
the hallways is most disturbing and in-
considerate. Given these conditions it is
probably both practical and desirable to
set specific limits to the times at which
visitors of the opposite sex might roam
freely in the residence halls. The follow-
ing suggested open rooms policy per-
mits reasonable freedom for those who
wish to invtte guests to their rooms while
yet conceding privacy and sexual seclu-
sion to those who desire it.

Vi ting privileges:

Monday through Thursday — 11 A.M.
to 7 PM.

Friday through Saturday — 11 AM.
i0 11 PM.

Sunday ~— 1 RM. to 7 RM.

By maintaining the right or individual
residence halls to restrict the hours oi
visitation further when deemed necessary
by a majority of the membership, this
appears to be a workable and reason-
able open dorms policy.

Those whu oppose any change in the
open dorms policy should look at the con-
siderable beneﬁt that an expanded pro-
gram would have both to the indiVldual
and the community. Those, on the other
hand, who quickly accept any expanded
open dorms proposal should be aware
of the implications of this proposal for
the much wider problem at improvmg
the community as a whole.

Informal Contact

One reason for proposing this exten-
sion is to attempt to establish greater
informal social contact. Some progress
has been made in this area. Forum jam
sessions were organized to appeal to a
wider range of students than the usual
dates-only crowd. This year’s Homecom—
ing is iollowing the same principle. Other
solutions must be sought in this field.

The Creation of this kind of an atmos-
phere in which mixed groups oi students
may interact on an informal basis will
surely have implications beyond the so-
cial sphere. It will also benefit the aca-
demic environment. The general lack of
participation in classroom discussions at
Grinneli is appalling, especially when
one looks at the favorable student-facul-
by ratio. A primary reason for this is
that the students are unused to Verbaliz-
ing ideas, to reacting to the opinions of
others, to discussing matter with adults,
and to revealing any port of themselves
to others than a very limited Circle of
friends.

This interchange ol ideas would be re-
ilected not only in the classroom but
also in the general intellectual tone or
the campus. Programs such as inter-
disciplinary seminars, voluntary interim
sessions, and faculty-student discussion
groups would assume real significance.
A community oi scholars would become
something more than a handbook slogan.

Consideration for Others

A third contribution that an extension
or open dorms would make, outside or
the strictly social or intellectual areas,
is in creating a better relationship be<
tween the sexes. Hopeiuily, under a
more liberal policy, the dorms will more
closely approximate normal living con-
diiions in which one must show Consid—
eration for the convenience and privacy
of others as well as one’s own inclina-
tions.

The introduction of both sexes into
dormitory living should be reflected in
the dress and speech habits of the
students and probably in a reduction
of prankish behavior. Given the op-
portunity to be socially mature, we
believe that the students will respond
appropriately. The courteous and ap-
preciative reception which North
Campus gave to a recent serenade
irorn South Campus is an indication
that the students are capable of such
A response.

In the past, discussions of open dorms
have always gotten bogged down with
the sex issue. Lester Kirkendali, writing
for the Journal of the Nauonai Associa-
tion of Women‘s Deans and Counselors,
believes that, "we need to develop an
approach in which the focus is on de-
velopment of relationships which will
enhance a sense of integrity and trust
in relationships. Obsession with sex, as
the only, or even the major, moral issue,
should give way to a concern for the so-
cial use of all our capacities.”

There are certain things a college
can and can’t do. It can’t, even through
a highly-structured rules system. im-
pose a set of values upon the student.
by late adolescence, behavior is most
strongly inﬂuenced by the peer-group.
According to Kirkentlaii, external
authority, whether parental oi- institu<
tionai, “can, at the most, hamper and
inconvenience rather than prevent."

Negative Response

The negative results or this excessive
control can be seen in the attitude of
the students. Resentment is built up
against an irrational system which cur-
taiis individual responsibility and stu-
dents adhEl‘e to their personal values
even it it means going outside of the
system. Eventually, this can only weak-
en the community

On the other hand, the college can,
and should, aid the student in develop~
ing his own sense of personal respon-
sibility and integrity and encourage
him to relate it to his life outside the
classroom. Isn‘t this the real purpose
of education? And isn’t this what Grin-
nell has failed to do?

introspection Needed

Finally, lhere must be not only exami-
nation, but also introspection. As stu-
dents, we should certainly look carelul-
ly at college policies concerning opens,
hours, off-campus living and resident ad-
visors. There is the further obligation,
however, to look at ourselves.

We mllst recognize the weaknesses in
our society and attempt to remedy
ihcm. Water fights, spring riots, and
certain aspects of our prepping pro-
grams fall into this category. Only
when we can see a single issue, like
open dorms, as a part oi this much larg—
er program, only then can we begin a
constructive reiormation oi our environ-
merit.

The administration must recognize the
drain on lhe student activities fee due
to buildings and Grounds costs tor con-
certs and dances at which the entire
College community is invited. In 1965-66
the amount oi money that was paid to
E 8: G for [our of these events could
have gone toward one major concert,
or eight io iiiiecn movies in A R, H.
or as many as iorty Forum jam ses-

would not be as helpful as eliminating
wasteful B a <3 expenditures.

There is a great need for more in-
lol'mal recreational lacilities and more
flexibility in those iacililies already pre»
sent. A campus of Grinnell's size should
have more than two pool tables and more
than two ping pong tables and they
should be available for student use more
than a few hours each day.

Flex tilty Needed

The scheduling or weekend events as
if every student will attend them one at
a time must be eliminated, All students
will not attend a Lenox Quartet cun—
cert or an A.R.H. film. More competi-
tion between events is not necessary——
more ﬂexibility is.

Finaiiy Grime" students must lake
more initiative in their social life. They
must not count on the events of a
monthly activities calendar to keep
them socially engaged. They must
learn to augment it _ build around
it — build on ll.
