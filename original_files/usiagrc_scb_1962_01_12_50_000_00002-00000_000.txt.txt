It would be unfair to pass judgement on the new test-
ing schedule at this point. But, nevertheless, we can’t help
being reminded of the well-meaning animal lover who
(looked his dog’s tail it little at a time—so it wouldn’t hurt

so much.

With tongue still in cheek we note that if there is no
vocal conservative group on campus at present, there are
at least the stirrings of an active, in fact radical, middle.
Members of the young organization are reported to be
eagerly awaiting the publishing of a book by Clark‘s super-
centerist Tom Fullmer called “Thunder on the Fence."

Bertold Brccht's ”Caucasian
Chalk Circle" was presened by
Grinncll Players on December a
and 9 in Roberts Theater. Two
modes prevailed in the work-
social parody and social criti-
cism.

The backdrop of the parable
was class struggle, but rather
than portraying the rise of a
moral and visionary working
class, Brecht made his proletar-
ian hcrocs just as corrupt and
ridiculous as his aristocrats, and
his social position was seen only
in the fact that he views the
common man with a kind of
lusty joy.

Brecht’s genius camc through
as he on one hand destroyed the
image of the ideal peasant rev—
olution. and on the other, vin-
dicated the human qualities of
the common people.

Such statements as “The
home of the Soviet pcoplc shall
also be the home of Reason"
(quoted in the original pro-
logue) were shown to bc non-
sensical, for thc prolctarians
were hardly more reasonable
than their predecessors still,
the class war was looked upon
here as a human comedy
rather than an economic strug-
gle, and the rule of the pace

An open lsttcr to the faculty and
students:

1 am very grateful to Dr.
Easy for having raised the is
sues which he did concerning stu—
dent government(S&B, Doc. 3).
These issues concerning a very
philosophy of student govern—
ment have arisen again and dc
gain, but never before have they
been so clearly pinpointed and
openly stated. I should like to
speak to these points in this
latter.

Until the past few years, col-
lege student governments were
little more than shadow organr
izations performing a few nec-
essary administrative functions.
They planned social events, took
ca'rc of pop machines, and per-
formed other routine tasks. Un-
der these Circumstances many
student governments went out of
business for lack of any relev-
ance to the educational and in
tallsctual enterprise. They simp-
ly could not grasp the essence
of student leadership. So in
many of the more forward-lookv
ing schools there has been a
tendency to add a Creative func—
tion to the administrative.

David Riesman has written
bout the apathy, blissful ind
fcrcncc, and dcfeotism of col-
lege students. Students are com.
mitted to an inadequate status
quo in absence of some miracle
of nature that will bring change
without involving them in it.
The most disturbing thing about
Dr. Riesman’s observations in the
absence of understanding of the
relation of an individual to the
affairs of society and the solu-
tion of public questions—it is
the lack of a feeling of personal
participation which democratic
societies need.

John Stuart Mill said, “The
moral influence which a uni-
versity can exercise, consists
less in any cxprcss teaching,
than in tho pcrvading tone of
tho place. Whatever it teachv
cs, it should tcach as pene-
trated by a sense of duty, it
should present all knowlcdgc
as chicily a means to worthi-
ncss of life, givcn for the
double purpose of making
each of us practically usciul
to his fellow creatures, and of
elevating the character of the

 

species itself; cxalting and
digniiying our nature."
This is the reason for the at.

tempt to improve student govern-
ment. Perhaps no other single
group of individuals so accurate-

ly mirrors, and more important,
clearly affects the values held
by a student body than those
who are in the student govern-
ment. The degree of concern
that student government cxprcs—
sss for student comforts in re-
lation to its concern for student
intellect and responsibility will
be both a reflection of current
values on campus and a strong
contributing factor.

Thus a USNSA basic policy
declaration states, ”A student is
both dedicated to truth and to
preparing himself for leadership
in a democratic society; he must
be prepared to face the chal—
lenges of modern life and he
must be willing to confront the
crucial issues of public policy
that affect him beyond the class.
room and that determine the
course of his society." The ex-
ample that student government
sets forth and the values it
manifests will set the pcrvading
tone of the place.

A student government and a
national union of students then
are organizations for action.
They are not information agenr
ciss—studcnts can read news-
papers. As vehicles for action,
student government makes the
statement of protest or principle
and sets up the committee to
remedy or to take appropriate
action.

Thc Prosidcnt of the United
States reminds the people that
they are engaged in tho busi—
ness of making their nation
one which embodies the idmls
of individual liberty and op—
portunity. And the cry, “Tell
us what to do," comes to the
President. “We cannot act un-
til hc tells us what to do,"
comes from the nation's press
and citizenry.

This is not the spirit of a
strong, dynamic nation. Student
government must provide an
atmospherc of commitment and
action within the academic com—
munity that is conducive to the
development of cltizens who will
not have to be told what to do.
it will develop citizens who are

capable of defining for them-
selves a responsible role in so.
ciety in spite of its complexities
and frustrations.

it will dovclop citizens who
will not beheld down when
they sec something that needs
to be done. studcnt government
should exist to provide a stimu-
lus and a vehicle by which stu-

dents can make a commitment
on an issue that is worthy and
then make some sacrifice to
manifest that commitment,

Dr. Baay is not exactly cor—
rect when he asserts that stu—
dent leaders have not been
elected for their ideological or
political views. In some halls,
senators have, This is my rea-
son for wishing to create politic-
al parties on the student governs
mcnt level. Elections are ap-
proaching and I ask every stun
dcnt to ascertain the political
views of those whom he elects.
This will not destroy student
government, but will help us to
grasp more fully the essence of
student leadership.

Dear disintquishcd cditir:

In dispiration — and after a
lengthy extense of vascilation
because of my disallusionmcnt—
I write you in the picturesque
and imbominable languancc (Re-
vised Addition) of my students
term papers before my honor is
hlllenated and my beliefs in-
habited.

The epidimy an dcapth of the
disasterous riff 7 of which 1
am the non-heriditay victem—
is the consentratcd affect of all
thosc wayword and unscraupu-
lous propogandists (my devout-
ed students). Dispitc my scould-
ing. pleading, prophesizing, and
dissaproval, there spelling def-
inatcly and devistatingly re-
gresscs backwards, with no hope
of ascention from the boundagc
of there wavoring expermints
with words.

The finale blows (term pa-
pers) which they are now de-
liviering and i am receiving, by
which i am completely seiged,
are a type of annontated litera-
ture often of considerable insig-
nignificance.

Thcy arc about to conqueror,
rny phyxical valadity and ferti-
tility by prominantly intorvin—
ing my compctancc and load-
vcrtantly chastising me with
political scrcwdncss.

At this rate I shall soon be
distanced from my conscous ex-
istance. Perhaps your iniativc
andkeen desicion will help me
devine how there death cars can
be shone the delicicacies of com-
pashion in the knick of timo
and how they can be lead from
there idolitrics (of incorrect
spelling) to the feastivals of
truth.

Heartfully yours,
Winston L. King

plc cmcrgcd as an ironically
good thing, “almost an age of
justicc."

The major difficulty both in
interpretation and performance
of the play lay in the character
of Grusha, the kitchen-maid.
Grusha is on one hand ridicuv
lous: she is silly nod overscn
timontal and is given impassion—
ed cliches to speak. However. her
stock situation is emotionally
appcaling, and invites an em-
pathy characteristic of melo-
drama, thus disrupting the fab—
ric of detached parody.

Unless the play is to be view-
ed as a crude tearrjerker con-
cerned with mothers and chil-
dren, Grusha‘s pathos must be
seen as touching but essentially
trite, and the actress playing
Grusha must emphasize her role
as the sentimental kitchen-maid,
another side or the comic work-
ing-class image.

Barbara Beale, as Grusha, took
exactly the opposite tack. Lines
like “Being powerful and bad,
Is hard on a lad . . . " are
obviously not to be taken ser-
iously, but Miss Bealc played
them straight, causing an odd
marriage of sentiment and par»
ody to take place on the stage.
However, Brecht may havc been
more to blame than Miss Beale
for this inconsistency. He gave
Grusha far too much emotional
appeal, and it would be a major
task for any actress to cut off
the empathy that this role must

Five Grinncll students were

asked the following question:

“What do you think about the

present testing and reading per—
iod schedule?”

Bobcrt Levin (Sophomore
“since i have only lower div
sion courses the schedule does
not do that much to harm me.
There is, however, a shorter per-
iod for the lower division tests
and I find that my tests are too
closely spaced together. i pity
those students who have both
upper and lower division cours
es and so have to attend classes
while studying and taking tests."

Barbara Graver (Junior); “1
don't particularly like the idea
of having to go to a lower div
sion course the day of a com-
prehensivc."

.lon Amsel (Senior): “The
prcscnt examination schedule
doesn’t pcrruit a scnior to stII~
dy for both lower division
courses and upper division
exams. Secondly, the dots on
which lowcr division courses
begin interferes with the time
needed to study for compre-
hensives and graduate record
tests."

Julia Johnson (Junior): "I
think that the idea is a good
one but the schedule'was ar-
ranged poorly. With a better

were overplaycd with gusto.
Especially outstanding were
Connie Bergen as the governor’s
wife, Peter Cohan as a drunken
monk, Sam Grossman’s fat

moron, and Al Stanley in a va-
riety of artful burlesques.

Sam Schuman was fine as the
fawning Shauwa, though his guia
tar often lapsed into very inap-
propriatc American blues, and
newcomer Chris Meyer also dis-
played a budding flair for the
stage. Lighting, scenery and
makeup were imaginative and
well executed. in perhaps the
best technical job players have
