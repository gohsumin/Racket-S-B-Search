Grinnell Grad Thompson New Dean M Men

 

Spring stayed away just long enough to ruin many
Spring Day plans. It arrived last week-end in full
force to usher in two hectio weeks of term papers,
exams, and comprehensives. But despite pressures,
many students have moved their ”library” and type-
writers too out onto the campus grounds.

N. S. A. Will Remain in Operation;
Senaie Passes Plan By One Vote

By Wade Stevenson

The student Senate voted 18'
to 17 Wednesday night to con»-
tinue paying $275 a year for
Grinnell’s affiliation with the
National Student Association

Marilyn Alt began debate on
the question of disaffiliation of
N. S, A. by saying that “I
haven’t seen the positive effects
of N. S. A. on the Grinnell Cam-
pus. I have voted for it for
three years, but I no longer see
that N: S. A. has a place on the
campus.”

Phil Johnson, S. G. A. Pres-
ident, argued in favor of the
national organization. He asked
“what are you going to replace
N. S. A. with? N. S. A. works
in the area of academic free-
dom, in the civil rights move-
ment, and if we leave N. S. A.,
we would have 'no role in mak-
ing our Voice known in national
student affairs? Johnson also
pointed out that N, s. A. was
considered to be representative
of student views and that mem-
bers of N. S. A. testified before
congressional committees and
other agencies of the U. S. gov<
ernment.

Jack Chapman, former S. G.
‘A. President, said that ”Mr.
Johnson overstate: the impact
of N. S. Ai’s statements before
congressional c o m m ittees.”
Chapman indicated that N. S. A.
was only a small voice on a
long list of testimony heard by
t h e s e committees. Chapman

‘Art and Eros’ Sunday

Regular Sunday services will
be held in Herrick Chapel this
Sunday at 11:30 a.m, The ser-
mon, entitled “Art and Eros”
will be given by Dr. Howard
Burkie.

 

[noted that “it is important that

Grinnell students play a. role in
national affairs, but it is not
necessary to belong to N. S. A,
to play this role.”

The debate raged on with
Evans, Patrick, and Weyrauch
speaking against N. S. A. and
Herzog, Heilhron, and Brue d§~
fending the organization. Final-
ly, the vote was tallied. N. S. A.
remains.

Because of the concern of the
Curriculum Committee over the
fact that Grinnell does not
h a v e, a clinical psychologist,
Stephen B. Wood, dean of men,
clarified the situation for the
senate. Dean Wood noted that
“Grinnell is spending more
than five times the amount of
any other college in the A. C.M.
on services to students who
have problems." Dean Wood
also indicated that a clinical
psychologist is not able to diag-
nose all the cases which con.
front him, and that only an en-
tire staff of trained men would
be adequate in meeting the
problems. Such a staff would
involve too large an expendi~
ture of money.

Dean Wood said that he
wanted to make it understood
that “the college is spending its
resources in this area and that
Grinnell has contributed to the
Jasper County Clinic. “This
clinic will provide psychologia
cal services to Grinnell stu-
dents. The senate decided to
gather more information be-
fore making a decision in this
area.

Jim Parkison, Speaker of the
Senate, announced that in a
meeting with James Stauss.

‘ously taught high

By John Wolf

S. Eugene Thompson, a 1953
graduate of Grinnell, has been
appointed to the position of
Dean of Men, President How-
ard R. Bowen announced this
week.

Thompson, who will assume
his new post in September, is

‘presently a high school teacher

in Shorewood. Wis. He previ-
school in
received his
from the

He
Degree

Iowa City.
Master’s

‘State University of Iowa in

1960.
While at Grinnell. Thompson

, was a columnist for the see,

a member of the radio station,
and a member of Sigma Delta
Chi. He was also active in
drama, forensics, men’s gov-
ernment, and campus goverm
ment. He majored in English.

 

Thompson is married and has
two sons. His wife, the former
Elma Johnston, is also a Grin-
nell graduate. She majored in
music and elementary educa-
tion.

“Mr, Thompson is a young
and vigorous person," noted
President Bowen. “He has a
deep interest in the college and
in working with men. I think he
will prove to be an outstand-
ing dean of men.”

As a member of the 5&1},
Thompson wrote a weekly col<
umn. Below is a sampling of
his column.

September 1957: "Strange as
it may seem, there are still
some people who refuse to be-
lieve the old and peculiarly
American lie that one must
JOIN to be successful. Some of
the world’s greatest men have

 

been quite horrible neurotics,
misanthropes, go- -it aloners, and
social rebels. And some of
them have even been happy at
the same time.”

January 1958: ‘I’m convinced
that this campus needs more
satire, more intelligent hell-
raising, more cussing and lil-
bel, and more dissatisfaction
in student affairs. We could
never find half as many things
in administration and faculty to
object to as we could easily
find among ourselves, if we,
looked."

May 1957: “Grim-tell, like any
other institution, is made of the
people who attend it and attend
to it. It’s regarded as one of
the best because its people are
some of the best. a fact which
never fails to make me think
of green pastures and sum
shine.”
