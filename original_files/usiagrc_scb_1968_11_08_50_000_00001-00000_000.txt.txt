Quad Saga Workers Settle
As Weekend Strike Concludes

Sago: Help Use

Union Tactics

The strike by Quad workers
against Saga included urging
st..::.ts s Itif‘itiDitC to the
walkout to employ various tac-
tics to put political pressure on
the food serVicer At first, these
actions took the form of in<
tentional sloppiness, but aiter
Saturday's lunch the pressuring
took on a different character,
After the work stoppage had
been called, students were
urged by the strike leaders to
eat only at the Quad. and to
“eat but don't be neat.” The
purpose was to make the
clean-up job after the meal
longer and more difficult than
usual, so that meals would iall
behind schedule, and the
strike-breakers would reconsld<
er their role in the strike. Dur-
ing lunch on Saturday, sympa-
thetic students were doing as
the Strike leaders had asked.
Dishes of food were dumped on
the floor, butter. mayonnaise,
and other types of dressings
were smeared on the tables,
and there were minor food
fights and occasional destruct.

The strikers came in to eat
just beiore the regular closing
time, and by that time the
tables had been so successfully
covered that there were none
available for them. So the
strikers ate on the floor at one
end of the hall, leaving their

As New Land for Moral Activism

Dr, Bi Davie Napier. Dean of
the Chapel and Professor of
Religion at Stanford University,
was here last Sunday. Monday,
and Tuesday (0 present the loss
Gates Lectures. The theme for
his three lectures was “on New
Creation". “New Creation" re<
suits when man becomes more
conscrous of himself, both indi-
vidually and collectively. Napier
applied this to the educational
institution, to America, and to
the world.

Dr. Napier, a specialist in
Old Testament interpretation,
has gained a national reputation
in the last three years as Dean
of the Chapel at stanlord.

The theme of Di: Napier's
lectures was that man “doesn‘t
know Where he is going. but he
knows what he wants: a new
land. a new race, and a new lan-
guage.” Dri Napier labeled ”the

new land” as the American
campus, “the new race or peo-
ple" as the American people,
“transformed by the icnewcd
power of their minds.” and “the
new language" as a world with

College Reports
$137,000 Deficit
In Yearly Audit

During the academic year
1967768 Grinnell College main-
tained a $137,001] deficit accord-
ing to Mr, Donald Lambie,
Treasure of the College.

The income tor the year was
$5,019,279 and expenditures were
$5,156,883. Average enrollment
was 1140. The cost of the educa-
tion for each student was there-
fore $4,523. Since the tuition and
fees amount to $3,100, the stu-
dent who pays iull ices only
pays ior 68.5% the cost oi his
year at Grinnell.

Income from endowments and
giits make it possible for Grin-
nell to operate without charg-
ing enough tuition to cover the
operating costs, Last year the
income from endowments came
to $407,537 and gifts amounted to
$773,776.

Mr. Lambie indicated that
the college was hoping that am
(Academic Improvement Mas<
terplan) would be successful
this year in relieving the college
of last year’s deficit. The year
before last the college came out
with an $11,000 surplus.

Faculty Considers
Adding Students
To Committees

A proposal from the Executive
Council of the faculty oiiicially
to involve more students in
the educational policy of the
college departments is now be-
ing discussed, Under the plan,
two students major' in de-
partments of each division will
be placed on its Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) These
Students would review all revi<
sions and proposals within each
department oi their division.
With the students more iormally
involved, it is hoped that the
EPC will be presented with
ideas directly from the stu-
dents.

At the present time, accord-
ing to Professor Joseph Wall,
chairman of the faculty, it ap.
pears likely that this proposal
will pass. Tile biggest point or
contention now is the method of
choosing the two student repre<
sentatives for each committee.

The committee of Faculty 0r-
ganizations is considering the
addition of students to other
faculty committees as well.
Groups suggested include the

Block Times Won,
Increments Lost

Tile dispute between Quad
Saga workers and the colicge
has, after a two day strike, been
settled. Student workers re-
turned to the Quad on Monday
morning. Both sides compro-
mised in reaching the iinal a-
greement. Although wage in.
increments will be eliminated on
February 1, block times will
now be split among workers
who must hear an extra burden
when an employe is absent or
tardy.

The "block time" is an aver-
age time which a certain duty
should take when a worker is
assigned a duty be is paid at
an hourly rate ior that average
time. Previously, the official
policy of Saga was not to pay a
worker any extra money if he
had to cover, in addition to
his own job, the job of an absent
workeri However, according to
John Shaw. a mealhead at the
Quad and one oi the student
negotiators, block times were
Split “openly” at the Quadran-
gle. Under the settlement, block
times of absentees will be split,

-50% for first and 100% for:

additional absentees.

Also included in the settle«
ment was a provision to pay a
worker extra if a “schedule
feature beyond the control of
the workers extends the work
period more than two-tenths
hours beyond the normal block
time."

”The block time settlement
will cost the college no extra
money," stated Ralph Pomer-
enk, Assistant Business Manag<
er of the College, “because we
