ACM's Chicago Urban semes-

for practical teaching expenl

counter “education in a live

context,” Stewart noted.

Students who have had intro
ductory courses in biology or
geology may enroll in the Wil-
derness Field Station program.
A summer program running
from June 19 to August 22, it
centers around the ACM facili-
ties in the Minnesota border
lakes region. An introductory
field course in geology will also
be oiiered this summer at the
University of Montana. Open onA

no prerequisities.

The ACM also otters the New-
berry Library (Chicago) Semi-

Stewart stressed that students
have to {it ACM studies into
their own academic programs.
He added, “They are not suir
stituteii for any courses you
may have taken on campus."
The research experience and
the insights into career pos-
sibilities are what make the
ACM experience worthwhile.

for the present enrollment for
several reasons. Due to lack
oi teaching stations, the num~
ber of e. E. classes have had
to be reduced this winter. With
the addition or three more
gym units, more courses could
be otfereli during morning
hours, enabling more students
to fit courses they want into
their schedules._

The long wmter
seriously hampers activities
such as baseball, tennis, golf
and track. This problem would
be solved by adding three gyln
units. The “Tartan" surrneo
which will be used as ﬂooring
in these units resists damage
by spikes or rough abuse. in
view of this improvement in-
door practices during the win-
ter in all sports mentioned
would become a reality. The
three units would enable the
men's intramural programs to
be moved entirely to the ot-
ternoan. No longer would var-
sity teams dominate all the fa-
cilities. Finally. the P, a.
