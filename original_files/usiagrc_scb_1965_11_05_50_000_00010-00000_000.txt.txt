At their Wt Roosevelt meeting place. WSO man in denim work
clothes so new they crinkled told us that talking wiiii the laniily might
be difﬁcult. Mrs. Beasely, he said, had emotional problems.

We found the building in which Mrs. Beasely's apartment was. We
ielt Oul' way down an unllghted hallway and knocked on an already open
doorway. A little girl about six years old told us to come in.

We asked where her mother was and she pointed to the front room
The tloor was completely littered with items ranging from empty cat -
board boxes to broken toy wagons. Mrs. Beasely was sitting on a chair
in front of one of the windows. her chin in her hands. looking out on the
street She hardly looked up when we came in and, when we asked,
she said go ahead and take pictures.

In the back room — Watching television — were several more of
Mrs. Beasely’s children, There were only two single beds in the apart-
ment insofar as I could tell.

A boy about 15 years old — whose name we later learned was John
— said he didn't want his picture taken and, to prove it. stomped out of
the apartment.

Mrs. Beasely told us she had lived in Chicago for 15 years. She had
moved there from Clarksdale, Missr She and her husband had been
separated for ﬁve years, We asked her how many children she had and
she said 10 or 11 or 12. She, of Course, was receiving ADC _ Aid to De-

The people with WSO had said that Mrs. Beasely had trouble getting
ADC but when asked about it she said that no. they had been very good
to her. Mrs. Beasely was not employed.

Chicago's De Patio Segregated School System
Presents Difficulties to Poverty Programs

The schools in Chicago were the topic of
controversy, marches, and sit-ins this slim-
mer. The Negro organizations claim that
schools superintendent Benjamin Willis has
created a system of “de facto segregation"
by using what is called the “neighborhood
school system” policy. The policy in essence
says that you go to the school that is nearest
you. On the West. Side this means the 95 pet‘
cent of the children in the schools are Nee

gm, According to the demonstrators this
summer Willis has placed new schools in

 

SllCh'a manner as to continue this system.
The all Negro schools are wrought ’with

many problems - not the least oi which is
keeping good teachers. A teacher can, after
three years tenure, request and get a trans-
fer to another school. What this often means
is that only the new, inexperienced teachers
are sent to the Negro schools and, as soon
as they gain any experience, they transleix

Of course there are other problems inher-
ent with an all Negro school. The lack of
contact between white and Negro students
continues a kind of mutual ignorance of one
another. Arid, as the US, Supreme Court
realized in 1954, the psychological effect of

being segregated makes it impossible to get

' an’ equal 'educ'ation’. '
