Drug Policy
Needs Revision

During the first two weeks of the new semester, two students
were placed on conduct probation alter seeking medical attention
It the heaith center while on “bad trips.” Another student who
was dealing in illegal drugs “voluntarily withdrew" irorn the
college at the request of the administration. .

Tho deans displayed poor judgment in their handling or the
ﬁrst two incidents. According to the Student Handbook, the col<
lege recognizes “the serious possibility oi damage to the mental
and physical health of (drug) users” By disciplining students who
visit the Health center with problems stemming trom the use or
drugs, the deans are discouraging students from seeking medical
attention when their lives may depend upon it.

In the case of the student who took an overdose of mescaline,
untrained fellow-students —- rather than seeking immediate medical
attention — administered drugs that seriously endangered the stu-
dents life, presumably because they feared disciplinary repercus
oions, it should be obvious to the deans that disciplinary handling
ol medical problems will only increase the dangers of drug in-
,volvement at Grinnell.

Although professional ethics may require that the details of

rsonal cases handled by the deans remain Confidential, the

recy surrounding the probation incidents is indefensible. All
ynernbers of the College community are entitled to know when,
and why, the deans discipline students. The college has recognized
Bimilar rights in the past by requiring the disclosure of judicial
council proceedings

in the case of the student dealing In mescaline, the deans Bib
orcised better judgment. A student who is so blatantly indiscrere
that the deans are aware of his drug involvement is a danger not
only to himself, but to the entire community, and it is perhaps
best for all concerned that he withdrew from the college.

The mistakes made during the past two weeks point out the
urgent need for the creation of an adequate drug education pro-
gram at Grinnell. Such a program will be worthless if it consists
ol nothing more than the goverment propaganda nlrns previously
used to scare students away from drugs,

Grindeil needs a drug education program that honestly ap-
proaches the physiological, psychological, social, and legal conse-
quencea of experimentation with drugs. It must examine not only
the dangcra of drugs, but also dieir positive potential.

A statement clarllying the college drug policy is expected trom
the President next week. He can no longer ignore the many deli«
Gate questions integral to the solution of the drug problem,

Is the college reverting to an in loco parentis policy in its
handling of drug cases? Will continued disciplinary actions dis<
courage students from seeking needed medical care? is the drug
policy consistent with other college regulations oi student conduct?
These are only a few of the difficult questions that call for lm<
mediate answers,

Poor iudgment in the past has precipitated the current drug
problem at Grinnell. Necessity demands a realistic reappraisal of
The situation now. -- M.B., TIT.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(Ted Click, a former Grln-
nell student, returned his draft
card last spring. He was re<
classified l-A and refused in-
duction Sept. 2.)

To the Editor:

Today i and other young men
are here in order to go through
the process of being inducted
into the Armed Forces of the
United States of America, Ten
thous and miles away,
Americans Continue to kill and
be killed in a war which is
illegal and immoral. At the
same time close to 3.000.000
other American soldiers are
being used around the world to
protect the American Empire,
to protect the economic inter-
ests oi the giant corporations
who have control over this
country and much or the world.

I reiuse to be inducted into
the U, S. Army in order to
kill my Vietnamese brothers for
to do so would Violate both my
conscience and the Nuremberg
principles which stated that all
individual is responsible [or his
actions in War time.

I leiuse to be inducted in
order to protect the illegitimate
interests of a group which
continues the violence of living
conditions for the majority or
the world's population in

poverty, doing this by at-
tempting to suppress any move-
ments challenging a status one
which is built on oppression.

To enter the armed forces of
the United States at this point
in time would be to deny both
those concerns, As a result I
must refuse to deliver myself
up for use by the military
machine. saying no to those
elements which destroy man
and yes to peace, freedom and
lite.
