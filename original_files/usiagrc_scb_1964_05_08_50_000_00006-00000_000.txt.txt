The delegates issued a report
supporting 1) already existing
organizations engaged in dis-
tributing fertility regulation in-
formation, 2) the distribution
by public agencies of informa-
tion on fertility regulation to
those who request it, 3) the
legalizing of voluntary steriliza-
tion and of the distribution and
purchase of birth control de-
vices in states where such
practices are not now legal, and
4) ohe expansion of education
concerning the population situa-
tion.

While the report held that
population growth does not
pose an urgent problem in the
United States at the present
time, it concluded that in the
light of demographic predic-
tions, a population policy should
be initiated by this country.
Such policy should be based on
the concepts of voluntary par-
ticipation, recognition of indi-
vidual values, increased re-
search on fertility control meth-
ods, and careful consideration
of legalizing abortion and ster-
ilization.

The report also called for

programs to conserve scenic
areas for future generations,
opposed a suggestion that in-
come tax exemptions be denied
when families exceed some
specified number of children,
and expressed confidence in
the capacity of the U. S. econ-
omy to support a growing pop-
ulation.
.Turning to the world scene,
the report took note of the role
of population in economic de-
velopment, social progress and
world peace and security, and
recommended that the U. S.
give priority in its foreign aid
program to those countries in
which economic development
is not keeping pace with popu-
lation growth. The United
States should also provide, on
request, aid to underdeveloped
countries for programs of edu-
cation stressing the need for
controlling population and for
programs supplying informa»
