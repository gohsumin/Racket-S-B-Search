Soccer a varsity sport?

By Barry Anemia

Our varsity teams are having
a poor year, but the Grinnell
Soccer Club has been quite suc-
cessfuL There have been re-
quests to recognize soccer as
a varsity sport once again (it
was dropped two years ago with
the departure of its coach, lrving
Simone), and such an action
would seem to be a good idea.

Soccer cannot do anything but
become more important as a
college sport. The advent oi
American soccer leagues will
certainly draw attention to this
sport played almost everywhere
else in the world, and the in—
crease in high school soccer
that is due to lollow will pm
vide ready talent for the 00L
leges.

Organizing soccer as a varsity
team would bring about several
benefits. The team would be as
sured unilorms, equipment, a
schedule of games, transporta-
tion, meals after away games,
varsity letters, and coaching.
Grinnell, with its number of for-
eign students and students tram
the east coast, who are more
likely to play soccer than their
midwestern schoolmates, seems
to have a jump on other area
conference schools in establish-
ing a strong team. Coaching
would bring out the best in the
experienced men and add to the
squad talented students who
have never played,

little heels are

Disadvantages accruing from
varsity status are also import-
ant. Two or the best players on
the club team are high school
exchange students; they, and
luture high school students,
could not, of course, play on
the team. Also ineligible would
be the hall-dozen freshmen on
the squad. The most important
Change would be the discipline.
Presently, the team has three
practices a week, informally
coached by junior Richard
Marl, ll‘Om Austria. Attendance
at games is voluntary, and
schedules are almost non—exist-
ent; games planned two weeks
in advance are considered long-
range objectives. With varsity
status, this would all change.
Practices would be live times a
weelr, and mandatory. Games
would be scheduled far in ad-
vance, and players would he
expected to attend all sway
games. Members of the club
with other campus commitments
might not be able to join the
team, due to either time in~
volved, or the away games. The
iact that there is now no pres.
sure to play attracts many en—
thusiasts who would not so
preciatethe pressure ac<
companying a varsity sport.

It would seem that in the
long run, making soccer a var-
sity spurt would be beneﬁcial,
both to the players and to the
college as a whole This opin-
ion is shared by Mr. Worley, the

club’s advisor. He is excited
about the soccer Club, but re-
grets that he had never played
the game before. and is unable
to coach Acting as a liasnn be-
tween the club and the athletic
department, he is in a good po-
sition to make an appraisal or
the situation.

Thought on the part of the
athletic department and the sac-
cer club is essential before I
decision is reached about socA
cer, but this seems to be an
excellent opportunity to show
that although its teams may
sometimes be down, Grinneli is
always looking ahead in sports.
