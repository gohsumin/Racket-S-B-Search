of self indulgence. This is not a move-
ment to make us feel good."

"We are here to teach the people the
lesson of what it means to be a 'good
German.’ There are people fighting every
minute of every day here in America.

We are going to be part of that fight."

"We are here to go there (the Induc—
tion Center) and say there is a new army
being formed. The new army is being
built...the old one is falling down,
crumbling from within."

“There is a war going on and we are
not the ones who started that war. We‘re
here to bring that war home!”

The demonstrators then headed north
in Grant Park toward the corner of
Michigan and Balboa. Police officers
jumped out of their cars and helmeted
officers who had previously been out
of sight appeared to form a line at
the intersection. Deputy Chief of
Patrol James J. Riordan, who commands
officers in the Loop area, directed
his men through a bullhorn device.

As the police quickly formed their line,
one officer said, "Remember, when you
get in there, lay it on heavy."

As the women approached the police
line, Riordan ordered then to "Hold it
right there!“ Approximately 10 vomen,
lead by Miss Dohrn, charged into the
police line. The officers, using
clubs and mace, quickly subdued the
women after about a four minute scuffle
One policeman, holding a demonstrator
in a double armlock asked, "Now are you
going to behave like a nice lady." She
turned and spit in his face.

Twelve women were arrested, includ—
ing Miss Dohrn, who was charged with
battery, mob action, and resisting
arrest.

Five policemen reported suffering
cuts and bruises and assistant cor—
poration counsel Zucker said he was
bitten on the hand. The arrested
woman were immediately taken away in
waiting paddy wagons.

Riordan then told the remaining
Weatherwomen they would be arrested
if they stepped onto the sidewalk.
"You are armed and carrying weapons,"
he said. "Lay down your helmets and
your weapons or you will be arrested."

As police formed a ring around the
demonstrators, one woman asked how a
helmet could be considered a weapon.
Riordan replied that they could keep
their helmets if they took them off.
Police then confiscated clubs, four
six-inch sections of metal pipe, and
a length of chain.

Riordan told the women that they
could file any complaints if they
wished and Zucker came forward.

One woman complained of having been
hit with a camera by an undercover
policeman.

The women were allowed to continue
their march unarmed and on the side—
walk. They abandoned their plans to go
to the induction center, however, and
instead, escorted by police, marched
to State and Harrison where they boarded
CTA subway trains and returned to
McCormick Seminary.

Shortly following the arrests,
Jonathan Lerner, assistant National

Secretary of SDS held a press conference
at the Civic Center Plaza. He announ—
ced that the Weathermen's planned
invasion of the schools set for Thurs—
day was to be postponed until Friday.
The Weathermen had received word that
over 1,000 police would guard the high
schools at which they planned the act—
ion. Lerner announced that instead
the group would join the rally at the
Federal Building scheduled for noon
that day by the RYM—II—Black Panther—
Young Lords coalition.

The rally at the Federal Building,
site of the trial of the Conspiracy
Eight, was the first action scheduled
by the RYM—II group. As was typical
throughout the week, the rally did not
start on time. By 12:15, however,
over 500 people were congregated in
the Plaza. This time police were very
much in evidence, with helmeted squads
completely surrounding the area.

Although the crowd was extremely
nervous, there was a marked difference
between this gathering and the Weather~
men. Few helmets were in evidence and
people passed through the area selling
underground newspapers and distribut—
ing leaflets. Many of those present
discussed the Weatherman action of the
previous night and most condemned it.

The midday rally attracted large
numbers of older people in addition to
the expected young radicals. Many
were there on what appeared to be a
lunch break.

Banners were displayed reading
”Racist Pig Daley, Stop Facist Raids,
Free Panthers Now," and "Free

Booby Seale, Free the Conspiracy
Eight, Jail Judge Hoffman." (Seale

is National Chairman of the Black Pan—
ther Party.)

A sizable group of Weathermen ar—
rived at about 12:30. Police officers
arrested several who were identified
as having participated in the Wed—
nesday night street fighting . "They
know who we are and they are just pick—
ing us off," said one Weatherman.

The rally was opened by Mike
Klonsky, former National Secretary of
SDS and a leader of the RIM—II faction.
Klonsky reiterated the RYM—II slogan
of "U.S. Get Out Of Vietnam Now!"
and told the crowd that RYM—II sought
to "unite the struggle of the people of
Vietnam with the sturggles here in
America" in a "year of solidarity
with the Vietnamese people." As Klonsky
spoke, Federal Marshals moved through
the crowd and formed a protective ring
around the Federal Building.

Klonsky introduced Fred Hampton,
chairman of the Illinois Black Panther
Party. Hampton, who drew loud cheers,
began by condemning the Weathermen.
”We do not support people who are
anarchistic, opportunistic, adventur—
istic, and Custeristic," said Hamp—
ton, referring at the end to Custer‘s
last stand.

"We do not believe in premature so-
called acts of revolution. We support
the actions of RXM—II and no other
faction of SDS. We've got to spend
our time now on revolutionary education."

Hampton told the audience, however,
that there would soon be a time for

the people to take power. "No matter
how many pigs there are, there are
more people than there are pigs. We
want power of people, by the people,
for the people! Fuck this shit of the

pigs, by the pigs, for the pigs!"

"Right on brother!" the crowd

responded.

Yoruba, a New York leader of the
Young Lords and Carl Davidson, a former
SDS officer, also spoke at the rally.
Klonsky then spoke again and told the
crowd "the pigs are going to try to
provoke a riot. Don't let them.
There are not enough of us here to
start the revolution now. We are
going to go in an orderly and dis—
ci lined way to a demonstration at
In ernational Harvester. We will go

in small groups. This is not a march."
Those at the rally then split into
groups of about 20 and headed for bus
stops and subway stations.

Although there was some confusion,
over uOO demonstrators arrived at the
International Harvester plant within a
a suprisingly short time. As demon—
strators walked toward the plant from
a subway station, police vans passed
in which chanting officers shouted "P0“
lice Power" and "We're going to get you
commie bastards."

The International Harvester Plant
is located across the street from the
Cook County jail. As demonstrators
arrived, over 60 sheriff‘s deputies,
carrying three foot long riot batons
surrounded the jail. In front of the
plant itself, over 200 policemen formed
in units while many more were held in
reserve. The Chica o Dai News re-
ported that policemen with rifles were
stationed on rooftops.

The rally was opened by a worker from
the plant who identified himself as
"Slim." He told the crowd that at
9:00 that morning workers in four de-
partments had walked out. He claimed
that at 11:00, most of the rest of the
workers left. "There's some people
left in there, but there ain't no pro—
duction going on now." Harvester
officials later reported attendance was
normal.

"Without firing a single shot, we
cost International Harvester over a
quarter of a million dollars." Slim
went on to explain the workers were
protesting the fact that International
Harvester was planning to close down the
plant, taking jobs out of the area. An
addition to the jail is to be built on
the present plant site, and the exist—
ing factory is to be replaced by a new
plant being built in a suburban loca—
tion.

The new location is in a predominate—
ly white area and black workers claim
that they will not be able to find hous—
ing in the vicinity. Although Inter—
national Harvester is encouraging work—
ers to seek jobs at the new site, pre—
sent workers will lose their seniority
when they transfer to the new location.

The black workers were also protesting
being "sold out" by their union, the
UAW. A black worker, identified as Jake,
told the crowd, "80,000 people need
vmrk in Chicago and they're tearing
down this plant to build a jail."
"The union ain't doing a thing about
