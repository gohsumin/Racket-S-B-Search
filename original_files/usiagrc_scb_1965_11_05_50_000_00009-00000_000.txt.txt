“We're going for broke in
Chicago. This is a ﬁnal test for
the nonviolent approach," said
the Reverend Charles Billips, the
top aide to names Bevel, the lead
er of the Southern Christian Lead-
ei‘ship Conference in Chicago.

The SCLC, which is Dr. Martin
Luther King’s organization, has
moved into Chicago in iorce. Many
of the people that we met in Sel-
ma are now in Chicago, organiz-
ing, planning, studying.

The goal Of the SCLC in Chi-
cago is a Federal Fair Housing
Act with subsidies. How they will
get this act is the question. As
Billips said, “If non-Violence does-
n't succeed, theii Violence wills"

Another SCLC Worker that we
met in Selina, James Orange,
said he was organizing the street
gangs, the teenagers. Orange said
the reason he was organizing the
gangs was that the “girls did all
the participating in the South but
up here we’re trying to get to the
guys"

Clarence Cash with the Chicago
Committee on Urban Opportunity
and the other CCUO people say
there is no tension in Chicago,
that the Negroes are too apathe.
tic to be violent. Cash went on to
say that l‘the little riot we had
here was precipitated by a lot of
irresponsible teen-agers. People as
masses never did get involved."
Orange ‘said that “there's enough

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tension here to [eat this city up—
all it needs is a spark to set it
off." Billlps smd that they Could
have a not going Within 15 min-
utes.

There was some difference of
opinion about the police in Chi-
cago. Blllips said they were
“okay.” Orange said that Jim
Clark (Selma's sheriff) is “sweet
compared to the police up here.”
Orange went on to say that the
difference in attitude was that in
the South the police weren’t as
mercenary. The job of the north-
ei-n policeman, contended Orange,
is to “harass poor people and keep
them scared."

Cash With the CCUO had an
opinion about the police too. He
said that the police in Chicago
have a “different attitude” than
those in the Smith. “There is no
mass mistreatment," he asserted.
“They are fmr and don’t take ad-
vantage of the people You don’t
have the brutal policeman here.”

Indications were that demon-
strations iii a really big way
wouldn’t start for about a year—
say, next summer for example.

Billips stressed the importance
of getting the movement back in
the church. “The churches," said
Billlps, “could he strong here."

“In Chicago,” he continued,
“the white churches will help.
There are more brains here. They
can get out and set up programs.”
