Mr. William Doan

Discusses Film

As Being a Personal Art Form

By John Wolf

"Movie making should be-
come a more personal art
form,” advocated Mr. William
Doan last Wednesday to stu»

dents enrolled in the introduce
tion to fine arts courses. His
lecture was entitled “Film as
Art.”

Doan is a Chicago publisher
and producer, His best known
production is the 1961 semi-
documentary movie ”Good
Night Socrates.”

Doan noted that because of
the complexity of the produc<
tion of a movie, the cinematic
art has necessarily been a co-
operative venture in which the
director surrounds himself with
people who share his views and
who can carry out his ideas.

The personal approach to
movie making is now possible,
Doan said. With cheaper equip-
ment becoming more available
to the public, more people can
now creatively participate in
this art form.

“There are things Holly-
wood can’t do with one mil-
lion dollars that independent
producers can do with five
thousand d o l l a r 5,” said
Donn.

The high overhead involved
in lilming at Hollywood studios
has “made Hollywood fairly
Well defunct. It has lost a good
deal of its audiences to the in
dependent producers,” .

Dean noted that the lack of
I “tradition" in the young film

 

industry has led to a great deal
of experimenting, much of
which is poor. This lack of a
film tradition will help make
movie making become a more
personal art form if film mak-
ers take the responsibility to
destroy abortive attempts.

“The movie is becoming
more important as an art
form because the cinema au-
dience is becoming sophisti-
cated enough to accept de-
vices such as the use of mon-
tage, symbols, and several
simultanqu kinds of time.

“The audience is also more

able to accept the philosophical
interpretations; other medians
have not developed this type of

audience.”

Behind The 8-Ball

(ACP) — Sally Smith, colum-
nist lor the TORCH, Witten-
berg University, Springfield,
Ohio, has discovered the versa-
tility of an 8-ball full of an-
swers. You justshake the ball
and turn it upside down for an
answer to any question.

Just to make sure. she asked
ﬂ‘le same question three times.
For instance. “Will the twist
lash" got these an s w e r 5:
“Yes.” “My sources say no."
"Yes, definitely.” And the
question “Will certain rumors
die down?” get these authori»
tative replies: “Outlook good.”
"Outlook not so good. “Yes.”

Don't Let That Cook
Get Away

(ACP) »— THE CHINOOK,
Casper College, Casper, Wy-
oming, conducted an informal
campus survey concerning the
cafeteria and came up with
many more compliments than
complaints.

The most frequent reply to
interviewers was a fear that
the survey somehow would
mean that. things would change
and second helpings would be
eliminated.

Graduate Returns
From Fifth Year

By Nancy McCannon

“‘1 never felt so useful in my
life," said Ron Dorr of his fifth
year teaching experience in
Bogota, Columbia. “I did my
most creative war ."

Dorr taught American His-
tory, American Literature, and
English at Colequio Mayor de
Cultura Femenina de Cundina-
marca, a three year girls trai
ing Sdhool for bi-lingual secre-
taries or translators.

Dorr’s reasons for going to
Bogota were: to understand
and sympathize with the people,
to lose his intellectual and geo-
graphical provincialism, and to
confront himself with greater
moral and physical suffering
than he had ever seen before.
Dorr felt he accomplished his
goals.

“I tried to become a part of
the student life, I participated
in their activities both con-
nected with the school and out-
side of it, but I couldn’t have
done it without the student’s
complete and openhearted ac-
ceptance of me,” Dorr said.
One time Dorr was arrested
in a student demonstration. “I
thought their cause was just,”
he explained.

Dorr plans to return to Co-
lumbia within a year. His ad-
vice for others who intend to
go abroad is, “Learn the lan»
guage. Learning a people’s lan-
guage is the first sign of re-
spect."
