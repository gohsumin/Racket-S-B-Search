Antony Tudor One or her own
works. an interpretation of Ni
Jilisky's “Afternoon oi a Faun,”
will appear in the early eve—
ning periormance.

Company tryouts yielded a
congloineration of origins for the
dancers. Prima Ballerina Lois
Smith was born and trained in
Vancouver. This -ersatile dancer
takes leading roles in ballets as‘
diverse as the traditionally close
sic “Swan Lake" and Balanv

certo Borroco.”

PREMIER DANSEUR Earl
Kraul, who has also been with
the company lroin its inception.

Progressing irom a slot as male
soloist, he has demonstrated his;
ability both in lyric and cone'
temporary works such as the
modern ballet, “One in rive,"

afternoon performance.

from many of the conniiemeiits

music ot Bach's Double Violin
Concerto in D Minor, This Bal-
anchine ballet. althouph new to
the Canadian company, was ﬁlst
presented in the United States
during the 1340s. Described as
a ballet or ‘purc dancing,’ this
represents Balanchine's attempt
to wed classical ballet with an
abstract manner. The result is a
work which calls tor dancers ot'
high technical virtuosity.

Other ballets [or th'c 4 pm,

performance will include Antony
Tudor's “Judgement of Paris,"
Ray Powell's ”One in Five,” Celia
Franco’s intcipretation of ”After-
Ashton‘s "Les Rondczevous,”

The evening performance of
Antony Tudor's “Lilac Garden"
is a representation at what might
be. in contrast to what is, as
the young brlde»tosbe, Caroliilc.‘
meets her lover in the lilac gar»
den. She is to marry another,1
but has this interlude with her
lover.

The nl:lneshQrinust-lnm'ry is
also there, along with the worn—‘
all—in-hls»pasl, whom he must
also renounce. The enectiveness
oi the ballet consists oi Tudor’s
combination or dance and panto—
mime to create a mood, to build
prcssurcs to a ncai‘ but nevcl‘e

“Poeme” provides the necessary,
poignancy of music, i

The balance at the evening's

Ch: C's "Scrcn‘dde" rind Tudor's‘
“OllEl‘ll’JﬂLll in thc Underworld"
These two pieces are primarily
concerned with creating a mood,
\vlth setting a scene, rather than
with presenting a story; in the
night club of the 1870's for "Ofe

there is “neither a sad ending
