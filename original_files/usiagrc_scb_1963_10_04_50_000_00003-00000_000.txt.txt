Encampment Committee Reports on ILA, Curriculum .

By Karen Adkinson
”it will be evident from (the
outline of the discussions Lhat

,we did not solve any basic
problems. It would be Pollyan—
naish to think that we would.
The problems are tough and the
answers aren’t immediate. We
did define and clarify problems,
exchange ideas and information,
and make a few tentative sug-
gestions."

This statement drom the re.
port of the Encampment oom—
mittee on the Junior Liberal
Arts Exam land Curriculum sums
up the results of the Encampa
ment in general. But willat were
the specific problems, ideas, in.
formation and suggestions dis-
cussed?

The Committee on the AMA
Exam and Curriculum, headed
by Jack Spence, covered three
main topics during its two days
of meetings—the JLA Exam, the
grading system. and the nu.
manities and Historical Studies
program. The rollowing arc cx-
cerpts from a report issued by
this committee outlining its dis.
cussion.

“We initiated this discussion
by trying to achieve a clear
description of the theoretical
purposes and benefits of the
exam. The theory underlying
the idea of a Junior Liberal
Arts Exam holds that if there

is such a concept as a Liberal ,

Arts Education and this is a
circumscribalile, finite thing,
then there should be a testing
instrument which can be used
to Show if a student has
achieved excellence in this
education.

“Assuming the theory is plau-
sible, it clearly indicates that
one 'pqupose of the exam is to
measure a student’s mastery of
a Liberal Arts Education. How»
ever, we felt that this test and
the preparation for it also
should serve an educational
function, It should give the stu—
dent a chance to synthesize his
knowledge, to recognize and
know methods and theories

which are useful in many disci-
plines, and to find similarities
and differences between discl-
plines.

'T‘urther, it should give the
student an opportunity to take
the responsibility of independ—
ently studying a broad topic. In
the future when the exam bet
comes a more reliable testingl
instrument, it is hoped that itl

“First we felt that there was
a general misinterpretation of

edge of cross disciplinary cone
cepts . . .

“If capturing the essence
and the totality of a Liberal
Arts Education is the ideal,
all concerned with the exam
should realize that this is im-
possible.
there are certain concepts and
,methods which a liberally edu-
cated student should know and

be tested on his ability to
reason logically.
“Another severe problem we

‘ness of this exam concept. We
felt the exam to be an isolated
phenomenon which occurred for

junior year. This exam concept

l
“A further problem

involves

the motivation of the students

. , A more reliable testing
instrument must be found tot
make this exam a requirement
for graduation. Students need to
be convinced of the worth of
the concept and the worth of
studying and synthesizing in
preparation forthe exam even
while the whole concept is in
the experimental stage. In the
long run an atmosphere of ac-
!ceptance needs to be establish-
ed if the exam is to achieve its
goals of education and independ»
ent study.

“of course, another problem
involved the type of exann
that should be given. Several
different types were discuss-
ed, including the following:
a) A problem type exam
which would require the stu-
dcnt to analyze the validity of
the reasoning and methodology
used in establishing some
theory . . . b) A take-home
exam which would require ri—
l gorous study oi specific read-
. ings and provide more time
to think out the broad an-
sivers required by such an ex-
, am. e) A split exam where

taken at the end of the sopho-
more year. This would allow
the student to take at lighter
course load in the junior year
to prepare for the last part of
the exam . . . d) An exam
that would consist of a paper
culminating a semester's inde-
l pendent study of a broad area
covering general concepts . . ..

“The committee reached con.-

sensus on a least one major pro-
posal. The misconceptions about
the exam should be cleared up
in hhe short run by an imme—
diate orientation of the junior
class as to the purpose of title
exam and what is to be expect-
ed of it. in the long run, all in-
coming students should have a
'thorough orientation about the
lpurposes . . . and limitations of
ithe exam . . .
The Grading System

“Our discussion , . . involved
the question, ‘How does one
manipulate the academic atmos-
lphere of a college?’ . . . It was
lfelt that there is a general va1ue
system at Grinnell which puts
