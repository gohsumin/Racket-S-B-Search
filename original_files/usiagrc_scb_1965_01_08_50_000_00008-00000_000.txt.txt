Ed. note: The following
article is a slightly adapted
version of a story appearing in
the Dec. 11 issue of Time
magazine.

The University of Iowa is a
Contented campus this fall. It
has regents who value academ-
ic freedom, faculty and stu-
dents hospitable to fresh ideas,
ever-morerliberal financial sup»
port from the legislature. More
important, the university has a
tradition of wise, long»reigning
president, recently Iowa in—
stalled a new one, the first in
24 years.

From the start, the man
seemed to match the office.
Said Howard R, Bowen, 56, in
his inaugural address: "The
University of Iowa, located al-
most literally on the edge of

SCARLET AND ILACK

a cornfield," must be “a place
that is hospitable to the individ-
ual human being, that raises
his aspirations. i hope we shall
also seek individuality for the
university itself.”

Bowen's durable predecessor,
Rhodes Scholar Virgil M. Han-
cher, has kept Iowa in the
front rank of state universities.
With Hancher approaching
mandatory retirement at 68.
the regents last year also be-
gan to think about the future.
Screening more than 130 candi-
dates, they finally chose Bow-
en, a specialist in economic
theory, whom they found only
56 miles away, where he was
president of Grinnell College.

For Bowen it was a home-
comingr He got his doctorate
from Iowa, taught there for
seven years before becoming
an expert in ﬁscal policy and

the problems of small business
tor the New Deal; After several
positions, he_came,‘to Grinnell
in 1955, When Bo’wen arrived;
the school was scratching for
students; by the time he left
they were fighting to get in.
Grinnell won one of the first
Ford Foundation matching
grants and, under Bowen, spent
$6,000,000 on construction cur-
riculum revision, faculty wage
increases.

Bowen has brought the same
vitality to Iowa since his ap-
pointment last spring. Already
in progress is $60 million worth
of new construction, including
a fine art center designed by
Harrison and Abramovitz. Plan<
ning for a big state univer-
sity was surprisingly similar to
the needs of Grinnell, Bowen
discovered. “I just had to add
another digit or two."

providing for representatives

on South campus.

A third amendment, which
was soundly defeated, would
have provided that the SGA
President would not be the pre‘
siding officer oi the advisory
council. Roger Ferris, who pre-
sented the amendment, argued
that it would guard against too
much power being placed in
the hands of the SGA Presi-
dent. This argument was ro-
futed successfully by Dan
Bucks and Johnson.

The entire group of proposed
amendments was passed by the
Student Senate before the meet-
ing was adjourned. The son
will present an explanation of
the amendments in its next is<
sue (Jan. 22). We were caughu'
off guard when told by John-
son and Parkison that no final
action would be taken thin
week.

Whoosh! What you almost saw above was the wooiiest number in years: Oidsmobile’s 44-2. Sporting (and
standard) equipment includes a 400cm—in. 345—bp V—8 mill backed with 4-barrel carb and acoustically
tamed, chambered twin pipes. And “sticky" red-line tires. And front and rear stabilizers, heavy—duty
flame, springs and shocks that make lean and away mere memories. Three transmission availabilities, too,
including 3—speed synchromceh, A—on-thevﬂpor and Jetaway automatic. Better hurry over to your Olda
Dealer’s. The 44-2 in a restless beast! (And it’s the lowest priced high-performance car in Americal)
