Laser Poses Vasi
for Medicine and

By John Wolf _

The gas laser and ils possible‘
uses in the fields of medicine
and communications were the
subjects ot a lecture and deinuns‘
stration given by Dr. Herbert
Trotter, Ji~., last Friday evening

Possibilities
Communications

in Roberts Theatre. i .

Trotter is chairman oi Lhci
board of General Telephone and
Electronic: Laboratories, Inc.

In the demonstration, Trotter
used a heliumencon laser in|
which the electrons of the hel'
um atoms are excited by a light'
beam. when these electrons re-
turn to a lower energy level
they giro up quanta of energy,
whioii in turn stimulate the‘
electrons or the neon atoms to
higher energy levels When
these electrons fall back, they>
give off quanta or light which'
are in phase and therciore at
higher intensity than the source

The parallel laser rays are
capable ot producing beams oi
highly concentrated l i g h t
which can be used in medical
work. The laser is presently
used in retinal surgery and i
for the treatment oi certain
skin ailments.

To illustrate the use of the
laser in communications, Trot»:
ter broadcast a tape recording:
on a laser beam to a receiver-
and ainpiiiier. When the laser
beam was blocked. the anipir
fier received no signals and the
sound stopped.

Trotter explained that to have
intelligence superimposed on a
beam, the light must be order-
ed; the laser produces a con
lherent, ordered beam. Furthe..t
since the amount of information‘
a beam can carry varies r'ircet-
iy with the lrequcncy o: the,
radiation, the laser beam hasl
