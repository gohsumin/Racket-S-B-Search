By STEVE CASEY

For the third time in their first
four games. the Pioneer football
team scored late in the game to
pull out a victory. Last Saturday
bgainst Monmouth, Tom Hill scored
On a pass from Barry Anderson,
and Paul Thurston kicked the ex-
tra point with 2:31 left in the

lame to give the Pioneers a

D~19 lead. Then after Bob Watt
intercepted a pass, Watt ran 41
yards to bring the score to 26-19,

This week the Pioneers will be
playing Beloit at their homecom-
ing. Beloit at the beginning of the
year was slated as one of the
toughest teams in the conference.
They started off in good fashion
by beating C09 and Knox. But the
last two weeks they have been
humbled by Carleton and St. Olaf,
The Buccaneers though possess
the league’s leading offense and
according to Coach Bowers are
particularly adept at getting the
quick score by a long run or pass,
Bowers is worried because this
has been the weak spot of the
Pioneer defense that has been gen-
erally strong this year.

The Pioneers were trounced at
the Beloit homecoming last year.
2444.

Next week the Pioneers will also
play in another homecoming at
Lawrence against the current co-
leaders of the conference.

A couple of lineup changes are
in prospect, according to Coach

Bowers. Phil Woodward will re-
place Ken Augustine, who will de-
vote his time to defensive tackle.
Dick Lamb will also see more ac-
tion at defensive tackle in addi-
tion to sharing the oiiensive Tulle
back slot with Jon Boswell. Lamb

fense against Monmouth es Bus-

rushers were able to grind out
336 yards compared to the Mon-
mouth 89, But the Pioneers were
only able to rack up 37 yards by
passing. This and the couple quick
scores that Monmouth got kept the
game close and forced the Pie
neers to come from behind.

Both the Pioneers and Monmouth
brought new types of defenses to
the game and the first quarter
was spent by both teams experi-
menting, trying to find each oth-
ers weaknesses.

The first time the Pioneers got
the ball, they were able to drive
to the Monmouth 19. There Paul
Thurston tried a field goal but
it hit the posts and bounced the
wrong way. The second Pioneer
drive took them to the Monmouth
so, but an interception gave Mon~
mouth the ball back. As the first
quarter ended, the Pioneers had
just received a punt on their own
25.

A Barry Anderson-John Shier-
holz pass and a Dick Lamb run
brought the ball to the 43. After
another play, Bob Watt burst
through the line and was in the
open for a second, but was hauled
down at the Monmouth 23. Two
more runs by Lamb and Watt car-
ried the ball to the eight. There
Shierholz took a hand-off, bounced
off a couple tacklers at the three,
and scored. Thurston converted
and the Pioneers had a 74) lead.

But Monmouth came right back
to score in nine plays climaxed
by a Zdeyard pass from Jim Pa-
larski to John Stergulz. The con-
version was missed to give the

Improved Team Travels to Beloil

By BOB KATZ

The outlook is becoming bright-
er for the 1965 cross country
team. The squad, as a whole, put
on a fine performance for the
homecoming crowd in defeating
Monmouth 2|) - 34. Coach Dick
Young was pleased with the fact
that each of the top six runners
for Grinnell bettered his best pre<
vious time for the four mile
course.

Jeri Langham led the team in

ach ailment. Neither was able to
finish the race.

Tomorrow the harriers will
travel to Beloit for a dual meet.
Beloit ran in the Les Dukelnvita-
tional meet and was not impres-
sive. However, they were without
their two best runners, both of
whom will compete tomorrow.
Hartman, Beloit's best runner, is
the defending conference cross
country champion, Grinnell’s su-
perior team depth should prevail,
though, as it did last Saturday.

JERI LANGHAM was the top Grinnell finisher in the Home-

coming cross country meet,

took that meet 20-34.

He finished second. Grinnell

21:42, 14 seconds beltlnd Doug

Sharpe captured third place, trail-
ing Langharn by 15 seconds. Steve
Britnall and Bob Grant finished
fourtll and fifth with respective
times of 22:31 and 22:36. Grant
showed the greatest improvement
on the squad, bettering his best
preVlous effort by 41 seconds.

Doug Dray, also much im-
proved. placed sixth With a time
of 23:04. Ric MacDowell. in the
seventh spot, trailed Dray by ten
seconds. Spence Clark’s time of
24:17 put him ahead of the third

some dim notes from Saturday's
race, which may damage the
team’s future, Bob Dyer, who had
been recovering well from an ear-
ly season illness. suffered a
sprained ankle, and Dick Lovell
