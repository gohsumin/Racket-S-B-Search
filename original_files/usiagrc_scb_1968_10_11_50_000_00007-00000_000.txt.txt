denied that privilege. The
reason, they were informed,
was to insure that all the
dormitory rooms would be ﬁlled
this semesterr The new dormi-

treasurer of the college, the
dormitories are not presently
overcrowded. He said that the
dorm was ﬁrst suggested along
with the idea of increased en«
rollment, Because of the ewe
demic problems anticipated
with an enlarged student body.
the proposal to increase the en-
rollment was dropped. Conse-
quently, the need tor a new
d o r m i t o ry was eliminated.
Lamoie went on to say that in
the last three years, runds have
been directed towards the l
provement at the present dormi-
tories. In the near future he
concluded, renovations in aca-
demic buildings would have a
higher priority.
