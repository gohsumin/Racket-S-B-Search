are at the utmost urgency to
day; and all opinions on how
these problems can be resolved
can and should be heard. Air

however has singled out the
Air Force and continues to pro-
vide the Air Force with college
facilities, to accord its instruc-
tors seemingly equal academic
honors, and to include the com-
missioning oi its ofﬁcers as part
or graduation ceremonies All
or these acts imply that the
college community favors, it it
does not endorse, the Air Force’s
particular conception of how
best to pursue peace.

The extension of favors to the
proponents of one view, whose
commitment is to an organiza<
tion and its ideas, jeopardizes
the integrity of the college and
its ability to provide an in
tellectual atmosphere in which
all views contend fairly, The
Air Force's View should have
the best chance or surviving
it it were not cradled by the
support of an outside institution.

IndiViduals are only likely to
achieve the degree of commit-
ment necessary to preserve a
viewpoint—in the freshness with
which it was originally con—
ceived — if they are torced to
defend that viewpoint from all
others. Such a spirit of inquiry
cannot be maintained when the
proponents 0! one view are in-
accessible to argument because
their commitments are solely
to an organization and its in-
terests—rather than to the pur—
suit oi truth.

3) it may be argued Ihat
neither the character oi the in-
struction, nor the urgency of
war/peace issues and the need
ior a fair and open examinaa
lion of all views constitute the
criteria for making this deci-
sion. Instead. it might be ar-
gued that the ArF.R.OrT.C. oi—
ters a commission to Grinnell
students which they might not
otherwise achieve. It is true
that fewer Grinnell students
might become commissioned
officers, although it is also pos-
sible that more students than
now would take the shorter
commissioning programs availa
able alter graduation. One un<
deniable effect of eliminating
R.D.TlC. would be to postpone
the time when the student
makes his choice H i.e., alter
he has examined the alternative
ways in which a person can
express his desire to work [or
peace. This might lead students
to join the United Nations Sec~
retariat, to work for the World
