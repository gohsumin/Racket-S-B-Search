the group. Mary Malcolm repeated the
view she had expressed in a Reporter
editorial: that the problem lies not in
the “Riot” itself, but in the social
setup or the campus »

Roger Koenker, SGA treasurer, moved
on behalf of the ﬁnance committee that
one of the statements of purpose {or
the initiative fund now indicating tho
promotion or interaction among halls,
be broadened to encourage “unique-
ness and creativity." Koenker noted
that several halls have been denied
initiative lurid support lor extremely
original ideas simply because their
projects were sponsored by only one
hall. His motion carried,

The original purpose or the initiative
fund, as stated at the meeting, was
to encourage halls to plan events to-
gether or with the iaculty and other
college groups. It could also be granted
to activities which involved no one
speciiic hall. Until now. the sponsoring
or an event by a single hall was a
significant factor in determining whether
the request received an initiative grant.

Turning to a discussion of The Crime“
Reporter, the principal issues were
whether the senate has any business
with the Reporter at all, whether the
Reporter should give extensive cover-
age tn bitchmpus events, and if so.
whether reporters Should be reimbursed
out ol the paper’s tunds lot this type
ol coverage.

John Herr announced that Gates Hall
is unanimously opposed to Henry Wil-
helm's trip to New York to cover thl
Mobilization Against the War in Viet‘

nam. (Wilhelm is no longer I Grinnell
student.) His complaint was echoed by
Bill Fisher, who questioned the Report-
er's oil-campus coverage and expres-
sed dissatisiaction with the coverage
ol on campus events.

Editor Krys Neuman explained that
the paper has previously printed stor-
ies by other nonvstudents about off-
campus news (eg. Vietnam reports)
and that it is difficult to ﬁnd rtudents
who will leave school for. several days
because oi the academic hardships that
result.

Knenirer said that the Reporter should
be understood as an independent jour-
nal, not as the voice or all the stu-
dents. He lelt it was not the senate’r
job to consider regulating the paper.
Ric MacDowell, SGA president, had
suggested at the beginning or the meet-
ing that students dissatisfied with the
Reporter seek jobs on its staff and
try to improve it from within.

Announcements made at the meeting:

Machwell announced that he backs
the decision of the Interim Court on
the case brought by David Dillon and
Adrienne Lemmons.

Ken Clark has been appointed Gada~
bouts chairman, Naiwa Adra, chair-
man or the loreign students board.

Armajani said, “We received 40 ap-
plications lor seven positions on the
executive board, as well as many tor
other stall positions." Interviews for the
remaining tive positions of audio pur-
chasing ageni. program director, news
editor, chiet engineer, and business
manager are in progress.

There will be a seven—man executive
board. A training program will be set
up for stall members, since most po-
sitions require practice rather than in—
nate talent, according to Armajani.

A sheet will be distributed next week
soliciting more applications for stall
positions as news reporters, engineers,
and disc jockeys and lollowed by ex-
tensive auditions, ’

anticipates live broadcasting 12 hours I

final solution to the much-discussed-
campus communications problem. A:
Well as all kinds of music, the radio
station Will broadcast taped discussions
on a broad spectrum. Lectures given
on campus will be taped and broad-
cast at later times.

The radio station will editorialize on
the news, providing more controversy
on campus Referring to the Grinnell
Reporter, Armajani said, “No doubt
we'll take issue with each other. and
that Will be healthy for both of us."
