CHIP ctAiiiiE. righi, is among the group of students from enmeii who helped with sand-
bagging operations at the Centennial Bridge overfha Mississippi River at Rock island, iii.

Island, Il1., while helping build
a major secondary dike, they
saw “nothing but flocks of kids
who had come out of the slums
looking for great fun. There
was little organization and
little being done.”

Fisk said, “At one point I
Walked up to a man who looked
like an official and gave him
some advice on What should be
done, Subsequently it was
pointed out to me that he was
the city manager and head of
the flood control project, But
he took my advice.”

The four Grinnellians went
to the city hall for a briefing

 

of the flood control operations
After complaining about lack of
organization, they were asked
to take charge of the city’s
sandbagging operations. The
Grinnellians declined this re-
sponsibility.

“After looking at the kids
and working with them for a
short time, we felt the under
taking was too large for us,"
Fisk said.“‘l‘here were too
many 15 and lﬁryearrold kids
from the water front slums
looking for a spree, and not
enough wanting to do any hon-
est work,"

The four spent two hours

 

Walker, Bells Examine Role of College
In Providing Negroes with Education

By Pain Clay

The respnnsibiiity of institutions
such as Grinnell for Negro educa<
tion was the topic of the ﬁnal dis-
cussion in the Board oi Religion’s
series on the race problem Tiles-
day,

Waldo Walker, associate dean of
the college, enumerated three cri-
teria which have been used in past
years to determine the admission
of a student to Gi‘innell and other
colleges, These were: 1) his aca-
demic ability, 2) his financial sit-
uation, and 3) his social accept-
ability. “At least one of these,"
Walker said, "usually exempted
the Negro from attendance.”

At present a great change hasi
coma about. There are various
ways to aid “Culturally disadvana
taged" students ill overcoming the

three problems Some colleges and
other institutions offer summer
preparatory programs or remedi-
al aid, Money is being poured in-
to financial aid programs.
Raymund Betts (history). the
second speaker, emphasized that
the white intellectual must com-
pensate fnr his forebears and him-
self, quickly and intensively.
This must be accomplished at all
levels. For, while collegerlevel
progress is most immediately ap-
parent, it does neither the most
profound nor lasting good. Help
must begin at the kindergarten
and preschool levels, Betts said.
The double concern is to recruit
Negroes, as at Grinnell, and to

Drinking Case
Goes lo Couri'

By Alan Axelmd

The first case to be heard by the
newly appointed Men’s Primary
Court spotlighted the nebulous na—
ture of the college drinking policy.

The verdict will be amounced
within the next three days,

The Tuesday night case involved
a Dibble freshman caught by city
police walking the streets intoxi-
cated. The police did not formally
charge the Student but turned him
over to 3. Eugene Thompson, dean
of men, who “put him to bed."

The student was charged with
violation of the general conduct
policy in the preamble to the
Men's House Rules.

Defense counsel Gerald Goddard
revealed that Thompson had told
the student he “did not consider
it a serious offense." Thompson
said, “However, I wouldn’t want
anybody to go away thinking that
it is a contradiction that the stu-
dent was brought to court.” He
said the student was not behaving
in a disorderly manner and that
would weigh in the case.

In his final statement, Goddard
said, “I do not think that pre-
ambles can replace codification of
laws and established procedure."
