Parkison told the 88:13 this
Week that Grinnell will not par-
ticipate in the national Thanks-
giving Fast For Food program,
under the direction of Negro
leader Martin Luther King, 11‘.

when camp'us members in-
qull'ed into the possible partic-
ipatlon of Griniiell students in
this program, they were told
that the college food service,
SAGA, had already purchased
food and had menus planned
for the rest of the month, The
program, in which a number
of colleges thi;oughout the
country are forfeiting one meal
and sending the money for that
meal to Dr, King and his com»
mittee for use in the Civil
Rights Movement, is scheduled
to take place On November 19.

Although technical circum-
stances have ruled Grinnell out
as participants in the official
program, Parkison said that
the Student Senate would dis-
cuss at its meeting next
Wednesday the possibility of
having a program here on the
local level in December. At
that time liho Senate will also
discuss plans for spending the

Miss Evelyn Gardner, pro-
fessor of English and‘ former
Dean of Women, spoke to die
members and guests on “Tonto
Kroger‘s Holiday.” Basing hei-
remarks on a ”long, short
story” by German author
Thomas Mann, Miss Gardner
traced the life of Tonio Krog-
er who worked with such heroic
self~discipline to achieve ex-
cellence as a poet that he
reached a state of weariness
and fatigue and proclaimed to
a confidant, ”I am Sick of
knowledge.”

”Pursuit of knowledge is a
crusade today," she said. “It is
a form of public service in
which we are all enlisted,
There is no time for dream-
ing, planning, or for personal
growih."

She went on to relate that
Tonic took his holiday, but
came back to work feeling that
he knew himself batter and that
there was something for him to
do worth doing.

 

'lots' to Happen After December 4,
When first Party Opens New For
For Music, Pool, E presso, ‘fxtras'

By Aline Furl-er
Trumpets blare. Drums roll. Curious crowds gather. The

Forum opens December 4.

And then what? Then, according to Forum Committee

Chairman Steve Buckles, “lots."

The North Lounge of the Forum will boast the typical
unionish characteristics: juke box, informal parties, rock ’n
roll groups. The South Lounge will be less typical and more
cultural and will feature programmed music, informal con-
certs, and receptions for visiting VlP’s.,,genei'al facilities will
include pool tables in the game rooms (the green onythe carpet
matches the felt of the pool tables), ping-pong tables in North
Lounge during the day, and listening rooms.

Besides catering to various social and musical tastes, the
Forum will also provide aid and sustenance to students with
busy tapeworms. The grill will handle the hamburger-ice-
ci‘eam-cone business, and the coffee house will stave off the
more ethnic hunger pangs by means of an espresso-making

machine.

As far as social organization's goes, the Forum will retain
the present committee which plans such events as informal
parties, but is also organizing another one! The latter will be
composed of students nominated by the faculty from the art,
music, and drama departments and will handle the fine arts
aspects of the Forum, For example, it will be responsible for
the programmed music in South Lounge, ‘

As a preview of what is to come and what it will be like,
there will be a“coming out" party for the Forum the night
of Friday, December 4. An informal open house affair will
precede the party which will feature variously the Rivieras,
a rock ’n roll band, aiid Maxine Seller, a folksinger from the

Mother Blues in Chicago.

So when December 4 rolls around—come one, come all

Combine Classical, Functional Elements
Set Stresses Live Aspects of ’Odeipus’

“The technical aspects of the
set accord with our attempt to
treat Oedipus Rex, not as a
historical piece, but as living
theater,” states Richard Mey-
ers, technical director of the
Theater. The play will be we
sented this Thursday, Friday
and Saturday in Robert's Theat-
er.

The set, combining classical
and funclional elements, is
composed of large corrugated
cardboard pillars and a raised
platform, “The decor,” states
Meyers, “suggESstthe period,
and the size and shapes sug-
gest the enormous traffic qual-
ity of the play.”

“The elements of the classl-
cal," continued the technical

director, “are the raised and
separate acting area for the
principle characters and the
separation of the chorus in a
manner similar to the Greek
orchestra." . ,

“The chorus is stylized in
movement and action and
straightforward in accordance
with the Greek concept." _

“Because of the many short
scenes between the principal
characters, the arrangement of
platforms, entrances and exits
is functionally designed to fa-
cilitate the actions of the ac-
tors.”

”We have tried to limit our
utilization of the classical,”
concluded Meyers, ”50 the real
elements of the play won't be
shackled by classical style."

Oracle at Delphi as a young
man that he was destined to
murder his father and marry
his mother, Shocked, he tries
to avoid his fate. His wander-
ings eventually take him to
Thebes, but on the way he has
a fight with an old man on the
road and kills him.

In Thebes he answers a rid-l
dle and thus dispells a plague
caused by a female monster,
the Sphinx, and in gratitude
the citizens of Thebes make
him king. l-le marries Jocasta,
their widowed queen.

After some years of PX‘OSF
perity another plague strikes
the city, and the cause of it is
found to be that the murderer
of the former king has not been
found. Oedipus dedicates him<
self to the search,

He discovers that the oracle
of his fate has actually been
fulfilled, and that the man he
killed at the crossroads was
the former king, his father, and
thus he had married his moth-
er. The tragedy ends in Jocas-
ta's suicide and Oedipils's blind-
ing and banishing himself.
“The play is directed by Rich-
ard D. Meyer (speech and.
theatre) and Mrs. Betty G.
Voertman (speech and theatre).
Stage manager and assistant to
the director is John Howard,
senior.

Costumes were designed by
Mrs. Voertman and the cos-
tumes crew head is Karen Har<
dy, senior. Jutly Pcal'son, sen-
iOr is in Charge of lights, and
IMike Fellinger, freshman, is
stage carpenter. John Oesting
is sound engineer.
