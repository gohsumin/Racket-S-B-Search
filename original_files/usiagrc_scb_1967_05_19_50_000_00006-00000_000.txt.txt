tions work by the award of major academic credit
for their creative endeavors.

Other schools have attempted to solve their
publications problems and to encourage students
in these areas through similar systems. But at:
Grinnell we flounder in an antiquated and re
pressive structure and atmosphere because we
are waiting on President Leggett. He allows the
faculty majority to prevail; he sets the tone! He
allowed the censorship of the student production
The Chairs last semester and he censored the
student book this spring. President Leggett has
not clarified the college position on censorship,
even after being encouraged to do so by The Re-
porter and others and he has broken an agree-
ment to discuss the subject with the senate,

As former 5&3 editor John Wolf warns:

“The administration can’t be allowed to
become censor of Grinnell‘s strident publica-
tions. More than any other campus organiza-
tion —- including SGA — the mililications are
concerned about the rights of individual stu-
dents. The administrators—the would~be new
sors — are concerned about the well-being of
the “image,” not of the individual. If Presi-
dcn Leggett is allowed to exercise censorship,
the individual might be “censored out” in
favor of the image,

“The fact that President Leggett even
considered censoring the yearbook is fright-
ening. The fact that he did censor it is sick-
eningl The fact that he, with the help of
Chairman of the Faculty Joseph Wall and five
of the nine members of the Board of Publica-
tions, is considering extending “supervis-
ion" to other publications is intolerable.

“Censorship is an admission by the ad-
ministratiou that it doesn’t have the ability
to deal with vigorous, controversial publica-
tions.”
