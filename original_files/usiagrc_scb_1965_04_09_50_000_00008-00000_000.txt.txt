Pioneers Hope For Strong Season
As Veteran Team Awaits Opener

Coach John Ptltsch is relatively
optimistic this year about the var-
sity baseball team with much of
lest year‘s team back and a cou-
ple good sophomores and a trans-
ier coming in to till some gaps. He
feels that every position on the
team this year is stronger than
last year except possibly pitching,
which is at least as good.

Ptttsch is Confident the hitting
will improve to cover up the very
weak spot of last year’s team. The
top two hitters, Nick Nonas and

Dick Ulrich, are back to lead the
way. Pfitsch is hoping that sev-
eral players, like John Shierholz,
Dave Synhorst, and Barry Ander-
son. who showed signs of becom-
ing good hitters last year, will de-
velop this year. Phtseh also likes
the idea of having three left-
handed hitters in the lineup, which
he will have this year. These are

sophomore Bob Geller (who hit
over .500 tor the trash last year
and will play first base), sopho-
more Dave Schatz, and junior
transter Gary Wilson in the out-
ﬁeld.

The pitching should be Strong
this year if the three top hurlers
can recover from pre-season in-
juries that have limited their prac-
tice. Dennis Hanssen and Barry
Anderson are the top two pitchers
for the Pioneers, Anderson seems
ready to go, although a shoulder
injury could slow him down. Han-
ssen, who injured his knee in in—
tramural basketball, should be
ready about next weekend. Steve
Tilly, who also plays shortstop, is
the third pitcher but has been un—
der orthodontic care and has prac-

(iced very little. Dave Schatz, the
left-handed outfielder, was drafted

 

for the pitching corps in case the
top three can not perform,

One of last year's defensive
weaknesses should he improved,
The Pioneers have two strong
catchers, a ﬁrst baseman, and two
outfielders at least as good as
last year's counterparts, while the
rest of the team is returning.
Pittsch thinks that [Joe and Knox
are potentially the best teams in
the southern division of the Mid-
west Conference. Coe looks like the
top club with many returning playa
ers plus an excellent group of
sophomores. Cornell will also be
strong, so there should be a tough
battle tor the loop crown

Pﬁtsch is hoping to start the
season this Saturday against Knox
at home with Barry Anderson on
the mound. Pfitsch is also hoping
this team matures and gets into
the race for the league champion-
ship

Now that spring has hopefully come to the Grinnell cam-
pus, it is time to turn our thoughts to the outdoor sports—
tennis, golf, track, and baseball. After a somewhat disappoint-
ing winter season, the Pioneers seem ready to tear the Mid-
west Conference apart with veteran teams returning in all
s orts.

D Major disappointments were seen in all the winter sports.
At Darby the thin grappling corps was hurt by several in-
juries—the most harmful of all to captain Larry Miller who
had to give up his chance to become a three-year conference
champion. Also in Darby, where the hoopsters were suffering
through what must be called a rebuilding year, the Pioneers
saw a record number of points swish through the basket but
unfortunately nearly a record number of losses were regis-
tered on the scoreboard. ’

Also over at the swimming pool the fans sweated out the
meets in two waysimentally as they watched the mermen
battle for a victory, and physically as they sat in this steam
house But the fans temporarily forgot these adverse coir
ditions as they saw anchor man Tony Horton paddle his way
to an apparent Victory over Cornell in the last race to give the
Pioneers an undefeated season—only to find out a couple min-
utes later that the Pioneer team was disqualified and Cornell
snatched away the perfect season.

But now the winter season can be forgotten as we look
towards the promising spring season. First of all the track
team looks ready to place high in the conference with the
indoor championship already under its belt,

The baseball team had only a 4-7 conference record
last year but two of the top three pitchers and the top three
hitters are returning to show they should not be regarded light-
ly this year.

The tennis team had a fair 5-4 record last year but the
whole squad is returning so the netmen are definitely in the
running for the conference crown. The golfers are also of
championship calibre. The linksnlen have their two top men
and several others back from the team that had an excellent
7-1 record,

Of course, having key lettermen back does not assure
a profitable season~but it sure is a good start. The Pioneers
are definitely due to break out and take a couple champion-
ships and this looks like a ripe time to do its
