Student Wants — Increase?

Last night the Social Planning Board passed the proposed
budget set up by the Social Co-ordinating Committee. The ap-
proved budget included a fee increase that will amount to
about $8 per Student. For final acceptance of Such an increase,
the budget must pass the senate appropriations committee,
be approved by the Senate, be presented by the administration,
to the trustees, and approved by the trustees. The administra-
tion has indicated that it would only consider such an increase
after wide student approval. Thus, at the moment, the burden
rests with the students.

’ It is important that students understand the rationale
behind a-social fee increase if they are to pass judgment on
one. Although it is quite natural for students to oppose any
financial increase, it is unusual for a student body to have
the opportunity to voice disapproval before a decision is made.
This alone should make the students wary enough to examine
the situation rather than make an arbitrary decision. ,

’ For those students who have been dissatisfied with this
year's social program, and investigation show there are many,
it does notseem as appropriate to question the quality of those
people who devrse the program as it is to question the material
they have to work with.

‘ Concert prices have been going steadily up iii the last
three years. The concerts committee has been faced with the
decision of financing Several “lesser" names in an extended

program over the year, rather than throwing the whole amount
behind one big name in the fall.

x Similarly, the committee planning formal dances reports
that student attendance for a small, relatively unknown dance
band has been very disappointing during the past several
years. They have gathered from the record that students will
patronize a formal dance only if the band is popular. Thus, for
this year. forlnal dance activities have been pooled into two
large affairs with two big name bands.

Social activities in the new Forum next year will obvious-
ly demand more expenses than those in the make-shift base-
ment union. There is more to decorate and plan for, there is
more incentive behind it, and there is more satisfaction in it.

The Social Coordinating Committee must find itself in a
quandry. It is forced to make decisions concerning the enter-
tainment of the entire student body, yet must bear the brunt
of student dissatisfaction as well as the knowledge that they
can’t afford any better.

There will always be problems of what to choose—not
everyone can be expected to flock to a weekend of folk con~
certs. Likewise, the influx of foreign films this year has dis-
appointed many campu: movie fans who prefer the domestic
films for weekend entertainment, The Social Committee
should make continuing efforts to give the students what they

want. It Should be a matter of investigation rather than an
"educated" guess.

‘ The students, however, must realize the economics limits
in the cu -ent entertainment fields. They should be willing to
rally around even a financial increase that is directly pointed
at doing something for the students.

[Anku Continues Study of Ghana

By Vince Anku

This is the second ariicle in
the series of general remarks I
would like to make about Gha~
na.

Ghana’s foreign policy, which
should indicate Where she is or
is not leaning to the East, is
based on principles of positive
neutrality and Strict lion»align-
merit. This policy enables ihc
government to Speak freely
about ways or making world
peace more Secure. For exam-
ple, Ghana voted against the
Russian idea of the Troika,
urged Russia to agree to disc
armament with onions inspec-
tion, and in the same General
Assembly voted for China’s
admission to the United Na-
tions.

Ghana’s domestic policy is
based on an enlightened demo-
cratic system, in which men
can reasonably express their
opinions. Some American news»
men have constantly charged
Nkrumah Wltll trying to cur-
tail freedom of speech and at—
tempting to have complete
ideological control over all
branches of the government. i
personally know that Ghana-
ianS can freely express their
opinions without fear. One of
my o wn secondary school
teachers used to spend a quar-
ter of the period each day bite
terly criticizing the govern-
ment. He even Called the Pros
ident a “tortoiserheaded fool”
on a number of occasions, but
he is not in ail,

Anyone in Ghana can criti-
one as much as he wants,
However, if he commits sedi-

 

tion, lie is prosecuted in the
civil law courts. No one iS aur
tomatically imprisoned for crit<
iclzing the government, Recent—
ly a commission of jurists pcu-
tioned the president to seem,
state the Chief Justice after the
latter had been dismissed. No
disciplinary action was taken
against them, in addition, ve-
hement public opposition forced
the President to abolish a ten
per cent compulsory saving
law. Detention only occurs if
one is planning to assassmate
the president or to overthrow
the government by force,

Nkrumah quite often acts
only when he is sure the peo-
ple will back him. If they do
not, he does not push them too
hard. He often rebukes his par-
ty officials for their arrogance
toward the common people and
warns them that their real
power is derived from the peo-
ple. If Nkrumah is encourage
ing any kind of dictatorship, as
some members of the Amerie
can press claim, perhaps it iS
the dictatorship of the masses,
This is a possibility in all West
ern democratic political sys-
tems, as Tocqueville has
pointed outl Certainly, Nkru-
mah is not trying to establish
an absolutist state ruled by one
man.

The Ghanaian system is not
a carbon Copy of any other type
of government. It is a welfare
state modified to meet the
needs and conditions of the Air
rlcans. Both Western and East-
ern systems contain desirable
elements. Ghana is free to ex-
tract these beneficial aspects
and blend them with her own

Miscellany and Digression

Those of you who enjoyed my
column last week Should be
commended for your exception-
al imagination. Those of you
who disliked that column Should
be commended for your excep-
tional memory. Those of you
who are reading this column
for the ﬁrst time should be
commended for your exception
al bravery.

Since this column was Sus-
pended whlle the a u t h o r
worked in preparation for the
Mock Convention many notable
events have occurred. Presi-
dent Bowen after seeing the
World has decided that his fu-
ture lies in the Big 10 and not
the Midwest Conference, Some
observers, who desire to be
nameless, have predicted that,
true to his campaign for equal
opportunity for women, Drl
Bowen will demand that Jerry
Burns permit coeds to partici-
pate on the Iowa football team,

Pierre Salinger, who backed
out of his announced 50 mile
hike one year ago has sudden-
ly reversed hiS field and pulled
off the greatest athletic trick
or the century. A registered
voter in Virginia for several
years Salinger made a cross
country leap to California to
run for the Senate from that

 

state.

 

Time, Newsweek and Atlantic
Monthly have run cover stories
on the changing morality on
college campuses, and students
all over the United. States have
developed severe frustration
psychoses, because they were
unaware that the things de-
scribed in the articles were hape
pening right around them. In
certain individuals who began
to look {or the type of living
pictiiied in these mimics the
frustration has become more
severe.

In St. Augustine, Florida, the
mother of a Governor is ar-
rested as an undesirable who
invaded private property. And
in Mississippi the State govern~
ment has passed a law to pro-
tect itself from an unwanted
minority, the Republican party.

Meanwhile the American Sen-
ate )5 in the midst of a mu
longed discussion which theor-
etically deals with the Civil
Rights Bill. Debate has tended
to wander, however, with such
Senators as Hubert Humphrey

Netherlands Carillon Summer
Concerts. This has given rise
to speculation that if you
chained a roomful of Senators
to typewriters and let them
type for an infinity they might
come up with a civil rights bill.

 

indigenous traditions. She is
taking lon g and confident
strides toward joining the rice
and modern nations of the
world. The one party system
under energetic government is
natural and traditional for Af-
ricans, and represents the best
possibility for achieving rice-
dom from illiteracy, hunger,
and poverty. Ghana govern-
ment is indeed forming a mod-
ern society at a remarkable
pace with the support and co-
operation of the people them-
selves Many broad - minded
Americans think [his statement
is true. Simon Bessie of New
York, who made a recent Visit
to Ghana defended Nkrumah
against Senator Dodd’s attack
of communism: '

"I and two~other American
book publishers were there at
the end of last year on behalf
of Franklin Publications, a lion-
profit American organization
engaged for the past dozen
years in helping the growth or
local book publishing and ihe
spread of American books in
underdeveloped countries.

”Nothing we saw in Ghana
justifies Senator Dodd’s state-
ment and much that we expel"
ienced indicates that Ghana is
an energetic country whose
chances of joining the free,
modern world will be greatly
improved by understanding and
assistance from America. Gha- \
na has its problems and so does
the United States.”

Thus, 1 am not alone in my
optimism about the future of
Ghana.

features a Japanese variety
show at 7:30 pm, Saturday in
ARI-l auditoriuml The show will
include both folk dances and at
least one traditional formal
dance, songs, skits on Japan-
ese history and a karate eX<
hihition. Japanese students
from other Iowa schools have
been invited to perform and a
few Americans Who are ac<
quainted with Japan are also
participating,

Masakatu commented, “In the
variety Show we would like
somewhat to show the cultural
atmosphere of Japan, All songs
in the Show are very popular
Ones. and if Americans were
to go to Japan, they could en<
counter them in any part of the
country."

Costumes for the dances will
be as authentic as possible. For
the skits the costumes will be
more symbolic. An emperor,
for example, will not wear the
dress of a real emperor but
will be dressed "so that peo-
ple will recognize him as an
emperor.”

MaSakatu Said, “This Week-
end iS not just too academic.
We want to transmit things not
So well known about Japan in
an informal atmosphere. The
variety Show will express some
thing about Japan, but it will
also entertain. The Japanese
students are not only doing
this to educate, but also as a
way of showing our apprecia-
tion for what we are getting
from the School and the slu-
dents.”
