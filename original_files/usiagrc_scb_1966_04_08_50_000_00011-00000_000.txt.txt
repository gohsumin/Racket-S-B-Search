Golfers look Toward New Season
As Risser. Shellenbarger Return

With only two of the five top
.shooters or last year returning,
the Pioneer golfers will be hard
pressed to come near their sec-
ond straight conference champion-
'ship.

The two retumees are Ted Ris-
ser, who shared the title in the
conference meet last year, and

"Dave Shellenbarger. Shellenbal‘g—
er played number five man most
of last year.

In addition to his conference
championship, Risser holds other
impressive credentials. As a soph-
omore he placed fifth in the con-
ference and both years he has
been in the top twenty - iive in
the NCAA college meet. In dual
meets last year he scored 191/2 ot
a possible 24 points.

Shetlenbarger, a junior, win
probably move up to the number
two slot this spring Last year he

took eleventh in the conference
and scored 131/; of a possible 18
dual meet points.

Moving in to fill the other three
slots on the team will probably
be two sophomores and a senior.
niey will be filling the shoes oi
departed Dave Sellergren, Mike
Miller, and Eric Miller. Seller-
gren and Eric Miller were both
three year regulars for the Pion-
eers while Mike Miller was for
two years. Sellergren was first,
second, and fourth in his three con-
ference meets while Eric Miller
was twice in the top six. The trio
combined for 50‘/2 points last year
while holding the opposition to
181/2.

Jeff Kohlman, a part—time play.
er on last year's squad, will iill
one spot while .siil Lee and Russ
Heuckendori irom last y ea r' s
ireshman squad will probably take
the other two.

 

Three Returning LeHermen

Serve Bowers'

The Pioneer tennis team, which
took second in the conference
last year, iinds itselt this year
With a shortage of seasoned play-
ers. Only three letternien are back
to help Coach Bowers' squad. Most
of the other spots on the team
are taken by sophomores.

The three returnees are senior
Mike Greenfield and juniors Elija
Hicks and Dick Lovell, who filled
the number three, four and five
spots on the squad of last year.

Gone are four men who divided
up the rest at the spots. Larry
Shannon, who reached the finals of
the number one singles. Ken Cly—
mer who was on the winning sec-
ond doubles team, and Tony Hor-
ton and Chip Kinsey who shared
the number six post on the team
will be missed this year.

Greenfield will probably move
into the number one spot this year.
He had a 7-3 record last year
while joining Ciymer on the win-
ning second doubles team. He also
reached the finals in singles.

iiieirs and Lovell will move up
to challenge for the numner two

pear to he Grinnell's strong area
