Whisper Into My Good Ear

Philosophy's Never-never Lancl

By MARY MALCOLM

Whisper Into My Good Ear will
he performed for the second time
tonight in the arena theatre at 8
pm.

Howard Harned doubles as
“Charlie” and iiha director of this
oneact play, alongside Bruce Mt:-
Conachie as “Max.”

'leo tired old men meet; on a
barely set stage: a rock, a tree,
a bench. The purpose or the meet-
ing turns out m be a double sui-
cide.

As an old man, neither McCon-
achie nor Harned is entirely cone
vineing. McConachte’s mincing
step and gentle smile are more
makerhelieva than old and worn—
out. Harned comes up with some
magnificent facial contortlons, but
doesn’t seem to know how to make
transitions.

However. as the dialogue be-
comes more dramatic, both cap-

lrure the essence or their roles.
The play ventures into philoso-
phy’s never-never land as two lost
and lonely men, wlilh their lives be
hind them, decide finally to live
lor “one more day.”

Max, a onetime homosexual and
Iallure as a painter, is more in»
tent on the contemplated suicide.
Life is a dream, he insists, "when
the hearL stops, the brain ends,
the dream ends. That is the only
certainty.” But Max can't take
the tinal step alone.

Charlie is going blind. He has
only a sordid past and lonely
present, with his wiie in an asy-
lum.

Max turns out to have two op—
posing objects in his pocket: a
gun and a pomegranate. The gun
is to die with. The pomegranate is
simply “One of Ilhe small pleas-
ures." Eating the pomegranate,
watching th lovers in the park,

thinking about boats on the lake
and‘ Christmas, Charlie decides to
initiate a kind of ”suicides anonyr
mous"—! don’t know about to-
morrow, but I just won’t kill my-
selitndny.

Max tries to take the ﬁnal step,
but ﬁnally succumbs to his own
homemade proverb: “The people
who are afraid to die are those
who have been afraid to live.”

The two head cheeriully Off to
get a cup or coffee at the automat.

This little play has a liberal
sprinkling or humor. although the
itinmest part at the dress rehear-
salia iew forgotten lines and
scramble for the script—hopelully
won't be repealed in the perfor—
mance. Combined with its random
and broad-based combination of
themes, the witty lines in whisper
Into My Good. Ear make Ior quite
a lot of thoughtiul entertainment
in an hour's time.

eight treshmen."

This system, Thurston feels, will
not allow questionable traditions to
be established, such as prepping
and lnterhall feuds.

The mental health facilities
available to students were critir
eized by Thurston. He expressed
hope that Grinnell would expedite
the construction of a Powesheik
mental health Clinicl

One linal area was held by
Thurston to need a few changes,
that being his special area or the
CorHP. He expressed a need for
more unity in the organization

“It has come to our attention
that the Com? has been too pare
chial in its outllook,” said this
this year‘s president.

Thurston suggested that the prl~
mary court: be abolished and the
Coll-IF be allowed to hear its cas-
es. Courtroom procedure would be
done away with, and would be
conducted in a "very informal.
committeellike fashion." The high
