“ Today’s issue bf the Scarlet and Black should be
a milestone in the history of that publication, as for
the first time in 43 years it is not being printed at the
Grinnell Herald Register, ,

. .The News Printing Company (Newton Daily News)
has taken over as printer of the 5&8, as we feel that
we can substantially improve the printing quality of
the S&B by making this move.

The News Company utilizes a different and
better process in reproducing pictures than the
H-R; it offers different and more readable type
faces; it uses a different type of press.

! The typeface which is utilized in the regular body
type of this issue is slightly larger than that which

ave previously been used. It is a type often recom-
[mended for readibility.

i ' During the next semester we will experiment
With the use of color and with a whiter, higher quality
' paper. \ ‘

As this issue illustrates, the S&B has already un-
dergone a “face-lifting,” and more changes will un-
doubtedly occur before we‘re through. Your com-
ments are welcome.

 

Friday. November 12. I963

 

It has been one of the fundamental rights in
this country as guaranteed by Article I of the
Bill of Rights that ”Congress shall make no
law . abridging the freedom of speech or
the press; . . .” However it is with deep con—
cern that I look upon a number of recent ac-
tions taken by various government agencies,
in particular by the Senate Internal Security

subcommittee and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, which raise the important
question as in whether or not this basic right
will continue to remain an actuality as op-
posed to meaningless words on a sheet of his-
torical paper.

   

Within the past few months a“ non-profit
radio network known as the Pacifica Founda-
tion has been under fire by both of these gov-
ernmental agencies. Pacifica, which consists
of three stations — WEALFM in New York
City (for which, incidentally, I had the priv-
ilege of working and am therefore able to
speak about the foundation with some personal
knowledge), KPFK in Los Angeles and KPEA-
KPFB in Berkeley, California — is supported
through the voluntary contributions of its
listeners.

The Pacifica Foundation's difficulties with
the government appear to have begun approxi-
mately a year ago when it broadcast a pro-
gram featuring an ex—FBI agent who was
quite critical of J. Edgar Hoover, the director
of the FBI. In January of this year the Sen<
ate Internal Security subcommittee conducted
hearings into alleged “Communist infiltration"
of the Pacifica network,

At these hearings the acting president of
the foundation told the members of the sub-
committee that the network atLempLs to offer
“a platform for every point oi view." In
answer to lhe question by Senator Thomas
Dodd as to Whether the Pacifica stations would
allow anyone to broadcast who had refused to

testify under oath whether he had engaged in
espionage or sabotage against the United
States, the acting president stated:

“In the absence of any evidence that it
was 1 fact that he had so engaged, the
honest answer would have to be yes, 1
would allow him,"

After the Conclusion of the hearing in Jan-
uary the American Civil Liberties Union came
to the defense of the foundation and stated that
the subcommittee’s investigation was unconsti-
tutional. The ACLU pointed out that ”the pro-
gram log of any of these stations for any given
week reveals the broadcast spectrum of politi-
cal opinion is not just one point of view, but a
diversity of views. This is daily application of
the First Amendment's purpose, to expose the
public to different political, economic and So-
cial thought.”

As both n frequent listener to Pacifica's
New York station as well as n former an-
nouncer, I can, vouch for the fact that the
network does, indeed, offer “a platform
for every point of view.” The popularity
or unpopularily of III issue, speaker, topic
etc. is not a criterion in deciding the typc
of programming of Pacifica stations.

Our government is in great danger of com-
mitting an unpardonable infringement on the
fundamental right of free speech as guaranv
teed by the First Amendment of our Constitu.
lion, Whether the FCC will grant approval to
the long-pending applications for permanent
licenses for the three Pacifica stations is, as of
the present moment, very questionable, The
final decision as to whether or not the Pacifica
network should continue to exist Should lie in
the hands of its listeners. If the Stations are
unpopular the withdrawal of financial support
by the listening public will quickly bring about
their demise without any unnecessary addi-
tional pressure from the government.

Forum For Descent

l In retrospect, the Grinnell “Folk Festival”
can be considered an overwhelming sliccess.
It intended to get as many guitarrplaying 5mg-
ers before its audience as the budget allowed,
ﬁnd it fulfilled this deepest and most profound
intention. Its only fault lay in its title.

Had the festival had some other name, Grin-
nell College might have maintained a greater
degree of integrity. The weekvnd would then

have been another concert series in the per-
petual attempt to make Grinnell Students like
their weekend. But implied in the title was a
notion of education, a notion that. something
was coming to lend new iHSIghts into the Na-
'tional Character and thus the nature of man,
.This was somewhat misleading.

The festival began on a note of prurient
salacious presumption. Bonnie Dohson was
the harlot heroine, paid for seducing
her audience into thinking She represented
a spontaneous effusion of vitality, of
warmth based on emotional involvement.
The result was insipid and pretty, as gen-
uine as any third-rate imit; on of Joan
Baez. Miss Dobson shone particularly shal-
low on her one Johnny Mathis number and
was outstandingly dull.

 

Ian and Sylvia got up next. They sang
"Greenwood Sidie" with enough conviction to
keep them off “Hootenanny” for months, Ian’s
twelve-string guitar was especially reminiscent
of the great loss we all feel with the doom of
Huddie Ledbetter. Their renditions of gospel
material were also tawdry and dilute. Both
performers were very good-locking.

. Things then got much bener. Virilicy‘charac-
terized the performances of all the blues musi-
cians. both Friday night ,and SatugaLafters
noon, despite the inevitable tworway ingraiia-
tion b etween audience and performers.
Especially memorable was Dean Wood’s con~
,versation with Porkshop Saturday morning.

 

By Saturday night everybody was wait-
ing for Reverend Gary Davis, the grand
old man of country ragtime and the Se-
govia of American folk guitar. The audi-

ence was overly polite, thinking that re-
straint was more respectful than enthusi-
asm, but Rev. Gary knew what the trouble
was and demanded a record number of em
cores by constantly heading off-stage, He
meanwhile demonstrated his integrity of
feeling. his overwhelming musicianship ——
his love for his malarial. Special'lhanks
should go to John Cohen for his fine in-
troductory remarks.

The New Lost City Ramblcrs were uno
doubtedly the high point In the festival. Their
immediacy and unashamed allegiance to good-
time oldrtimey music proved that city per-
formers can sound genuine with enough dedir
cation and affection to legitimate folk/liters
ature. Their Stage humor was excellently in
keeping with that peculiar mode of rural trag-
icomedy when you don't know whether lo
laugh or cry. Mike Seeger's autoharp solo oi
“Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies”
should be enough to keep Grilmell folksingcrs
away lrom Joan Baez albums for some time.

The Ramblers' captivating, hellrbent for
leather finale, “The Orange-Blossum Special.”
had everybody forgetting sophisticated reser-
vonons about the old-time fiddle. They were a
roaring success.

Slnce the concerts committee had a strange
mania for getting as many people into Darby
as possible, the question 0! future experiments
with traditional music must always remain in
doubt. This generation, like the television ex»
cutive, seems committed to getting record
numbers inside things—telephone booths, old
automobiles, etc. But if the presence of the
Lenox group is any indication of a tolerance
for serious minority tastes, we may have big-
ger and better folk festivals in years to come.

Maryland Establishes Board
To Thaw Frosiburg Impasse

 

By Jeffrey kohlmon

The State of Maryland has
I a u n c h e d an investigation
aimed at settling a student and
faculty uproar against the
president of Frostburg State
College.

The State board was called
in after the American Associa-

tion of American Professors
complained about the dismiss-
al of four English teachers at
the four year liberal arts colr
lege. R. Brown hardesty,
president of the small state col.
lege Since 1954, allegedly fired
the four teachers for promot-
ing avanogorde poetry, dis-
cussing controversial books in
the classroom, and joining slu-
dents in the Frostburg ”beat
cafes.”

The dismissal was protest-
ed by the students when they
staged a march ended in an
effigy hanging. President
Hardesty didn’t take this
too kindly, and placed thirty
students on probation. He
also demanded letters of
apology from student lead-
ers. It was recently found
out that these letters were
later used to prevent further
demonstrations At. the be-
ginning of this month the‘
president of the student gov—
ernment stated that he had
been forced to quit by Presi»
dent Hardesty. Hardesty,
when quéstioned about this
and other related campus

 

problems, said lime except
that in his opinion there wer-
no campus tensions.

He said that faculty dissent-
ers opposing his policies in—
cluded “people whose work
has not been entirely satisfacA
Lory," gripers and disappoint-
ed 'status Seekers, While there
are no tensions, Hardesty ad-
mitted that there were prob

lems.
r r :

Last week after numerous
arllcies and reports spread
acres the country about the
wild parties at Harvard, the
average Harvard student, The
Harvard Crimson assures us,
was out looking for these or-
gies. ‘

While the Harvard boys were
searching, the Radcliffe girls
were reading about the really
great parties they had missed.
Perhaps The Boston Record
American produced the best
banner headline on the sub»
jecl: H A RVA R D BARES
WILD PARTIES.

We at the “Harvard of in.
midwest” wait anxiously for
further news. Give Grinnell
five years and we’ll do it just
as well but without the pub—
licity, . . ‘
