' GRAY MATTER

sy BILL GRAY

Well. welll It seems that some people have been slightly upset
by some of my recent columns merely because my facts are ins
Iccurate,

For example, I said there would be two instead of three
referees this year which is incorrect. I also said the Smith preps
beat the Clark preps while, in truth, they never made it past mid-
field which can hardly be construed as dominating play.

in any case, I find this insigniﬁcant as my journalistic motto
Is, “It matters not whether you tell the truth, but whether what you
say makes good reading.” In the future 1 will try to be slightly
more accurate but don't go betting the family jewels on the au-
thenticity of my statements

Having looked at the I. M. football schedule [or this year, I
notice that the games will be played just a hop, step, and jump

from the center of the campus. All games, that is, With the ex-
ertion of those played on Stable Field which is a hop, step, and
amp, . . . and hop, . . . and leap, . r . and two giant steps, . . .
and eleven scissor steps, . . . and four hundred and sixteen strides,
. . The reason for this is that Mac Field is going to be turned
into an aboretum or something and therefore we must not tread
on it, This is about as sensible as putting up Keep on the Grass
signs in a national park I wouldn’t go so far as to say Stable
told is out of the way, but at the last game, four aborigines tried
eat our footballr As a famous English poet once said (or was he
l'ench?), “We’d gladly give up girls and meals /lr you'd give us
ack our football fields.” or was he Persian? Chinese? , r .

HARRlERS SET
FOR SEASON

The cross country season

three miles against Coe. it is
scheduled to start at 11 aim.
at the Griiineli cmss country
course, which begins on the
Ward Field track, goes across
the soccer fields to the golf
course and back again.

Coach Obermlller expects his
harriers to have a fairly suc-
cessful season if everyone stays
healthy. The team is led by
captain Doug Dray with Bob
Asbille, Bob Grant and Spen-
cer Clark mentioned as other
outstanding runners. Asbille is
a sophomore and the rest are
seniors Other members of the
squad include senior George
Potter, juniors Bruce Luecke
and Phil DeJong and sopho-
mores Eric Thor, John Siekert,
Steve Siegel, and Glen Brown-
ing.

A cross cﬂuntry team race is
either three or four miles long.

The official varsity distance is
four miles and the official
freshman distance is three
miles. A team consists of seven
runners with the top five {in-
ishers on each team scoringl
The runner iinishing iirst gets
one point, the second finisher
gets two points and so our The
team with the lowest score
wins. Thus, the man running
fifth {or the learn is as es-
sential to the team effort as
the number one man on the
squad.

Also running against (Joe to-
morrow, but not included in
the scoring, will be the fresh-
man team,

TiiE lilo ITZER

By JOHN RA:

The change of suit preference
signal is a useful deiensive sig-
nal which may give partner the
key to the defense of the con-
tract It is used when one is
free to lead one of several
cards in a holding and one
wishes to direct partner to lead
one of two questionable suits.

In the following hand, after
the six of spades opening lead,
the queen was played from
dummy, which was taken by =
East's ace, as Declarer dropped ff,” prff" 332°“
the seven. Not fooled by De- 4H p,“ p,“
clarer's raisecard, East re- Opening ind, xpads six
turned the jack of spades which
West ruffed, West realized that East was free to lead any card in
his spade holding and that the lead of the jack might be a change
of suit preference signal. Of the two suits other than trump (in this
case, diamonds and clubs), at high card signals partner to lead
the higher ranking of the two suits, while a low card signals the
lead of the lower ranking suit. East returned a diamond, the higher
ranking suit hoping that he found an entry to East’s hand. East
cashed the ace and returned a spade to defeat the contract

of course, before this convention is used it must be agreed tips
on by the partnership. The signal has wide application in no—trump
as well as trump contracts, and again is based upon two condi-
tions: one must be able to lead any card in one’s holding and the
card must be recognized as such; and there can be only two suits
to be distinguished, a high card signaling the higher ranking suit,
a low card signaling the lower ranking suitl
