Harriers Fifth In Cross County

By MICHAEL DALEY

The Grinnell Athletic Depart-
ment sponsored the annual Les
’Duke Cross Country Invitational
Meet on October 5. As in the
pest, great talent and competb
tlon gathered at Grinnell from
the top small colleges in rows.

Although it was overcast and
it hit cool, the participants
turned in fine times on the
grueling Grinnell four mile
course. Despite improved times,
the Grinnell Varsity didn’t finish
as high as coach Ray Ohen-nil-
ier had hoped. The Pioneers
finished a disappointing fifth
behind Lords College, St. Am-
brose, Biackhawk Junior College,
and Graceland College.

Participants in the meet for
Grinnell were Bob Asbille, Rob
Dorsett, Eric Jahn, John Luec—
ke, Tim Power, John Russell,
and John Siekert. With tremen-
dous effort Eric Jahn was able
to finish highest for Grinneii.
Eric improved 2 minutes and 16
seconds over his 1967 time!

Another surprising sophomore,
Tim Power, ﬁnished the d
tapes in 22 minutes and 51 sec-
onds. He has improved almost
2 minutes over last year. The
third of the Big Three sopho-
more was John Russell, who
placed third highest for the
Grinnellians. Russell ran a beau-
tilully paced race.

For the freshmen cross coun-
try team, the Grimeil College
Invitational Meet is the high-
light of the season. This year,
however, the meet lost some of
its excitement for two basic
reasons. First, Drake Universi-
ty freshmen literally ran away
with the meet by taking three
of four top places. Secondly,

. only six of ten expected teams
showed up.

Lynn Lee, of Drake, took ﬁrst
place in a sizzling time of 15
minutes, 45 and 4 tenths see-
onds. Grinneii's own Chuck Mc-
Grath was second, with Phillipa

Watt; ARE

(1’2, (r ﬁtitMmiEla

and Sanders, of Drake, captur-
ing third and tourth places re
spectively, Other Big G fresh-
men in the top twenty were
Oscar Rattenborg, eighth place,
Phil Morales, tenth and Mark
Nissen, seventeenth. John
Weins, Chris Decker, and yours
truly, Mike Daley (i linished
dead last) were “also rans."

Drake won team honors with
as points. Loras College was
second with 47 points, Grinneli
was third with 58, and the Uni-
versity at Northern Iowa was
fourth with oz points.

’Ihe Pioneer varsity runners
were back in Midwest Confer-
ence action once again on Sat-
urday, Oct. 12, at Knox College,
in Galesburg, Ill. The final score
was decidedly in favor of the
Pioneers, 20-35. Grinnell won,
but the individual times were
generally poor compared to per-
formances in previous meets
this season.

Although he didn’t win, Bob
Dorsett was the exception to
this rule and the standout for
the team. Dorsett crossed the
finish line sixth in 14 minutes
and 14 seconds. This is not a
particularly fantastic time, but
the fact that Rob has slashed
nearly 2 minutes off his time in
two weeks time is outstanding.

Marty Dybicz won the race
for Knox in 22 minutes and 8
seconds. Following Dybicz, Grin-
nell copped the next five places;'
Eric Jahn was second, John
Russell was third, John Siekert
Was fourth, Bob Asbille was
fifth, and Rob Dorsett finished
in sixth place.

With [his victory, the Grin-
nell thinclads evened their con~
ference record at 2.2, They will
travel to Cedar Rapids today to
participate in the cue Invita-
tional. They have dual meets
remaining with Monmouth and
Lawrence and could very likely
finish the season above the .500
mark.

It is Homecoming Weekend
once more and time for my col-
umn to ascend the heights of
lucidity in a glorious effort to
achieve recognition from the
outside world. If i couldn't suc-
ceed last year, however, during
THE weekend of the century, 1
must confess that my hopes are
not bright. (Marshall McLuhan!
Where are you now that I need
you?) It certainly is a condem-
nation oi society that it has
failed to recognize the talent
that is thus for lying dormant
and becoming stagnant in the
confines of an i, M. column.
Come to think of it, maybe the
talent was originally stagnanm

For those of you who haven't
noticed, Stable Field is no long-
er ihere, nor is the baseball
diamond, nor is the soccer field.
Therefore I would suggest that
the people who have been used
to getting their athletic exer-
cise out there be careful not to
fall in front of a road-grader.
Besides, the Des Moines Regis-
ter would probably construe it
as a form of social protest.

i suppose at least some or
you are waiting for l. M. news
so i will attempt to fulfill my
obligation. Dibble has set a
record of some sort by being the
recipient of three forfeits this
year. in the past three years,
there has been only one for-
feit in l. M. football. This is
certainly indicative of a. trend,
or something. The DiirCampus
team Continues to be undefeat-
ed, whcih presents a problem.
Where will they keep the foot-
ball trophy alld who will in-
herit the prize next year? These
are little problems which were
overlooked in the overhauling
of the campus system. Just
think, where would we all be
without a sociological commen-
iator like myselt? (Nirvana?)

Pioneers Mount lniured Squadron
Againsi Beloit Brown in Home Game

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Tomorrow at 1:00 pm. the
Pioneers face Beioit here for
our annual homecoming game.
Beloit goes into the game with
three wins in tour games. Grinv
hell’s only Victory out of four
chances was against Knox.
That victory came last Satur-
day, and it should boost the
team’s spirit during the follow-
ing week. The Pioneers are
tired of losing and the momen‘
tum irom the Knox game could
be a factor tomorrow.

There aren't many players on
the Beloit squad this year, but
Coach Bowers says that they
are all capable players. They
are 3150 big, with the starting
lineman and backs averaging
almost two hundred pounds.
They have two good quarter-
backs, one of whom is an eX‘
cellent passer with a tendency
to complete the long bomb. 0n
the receiving end, Whipple, a
split 5 n d wearing number
thirteen, will be a constant
threat to our pass defense.
Young, number thirtyrthree,
is supposed to be “as good a
back as any in the conierence,"
according to Bowers; his run-
ning ability has gained him the
number six spot on the list of
the high scorers in the confer-
ence,

on the Grinnell side, Gary
Johnson, ollr starting sopho<
more quarterback, has been
doing a iine job. Each game
he does better and his passing
has improved tremendously (7
out of 12 complete at Knox with

no interceptions). Jon Buswell,
senior fullback, is beginning to
get back into his best form, and
should do very well tomorrow.
Jon was second string all con-
{erence in 1966, with a total of
383 yards on the ground to his
credit. Brian Barnes is another,
player who should do well to-
marrow. Brian is a senior half-
back; last year in thirtyrfoul
attempts he averaged thre'
yards per carry. Tom Lower
has played very well in the last
two games, as has Steve
Hutchings, and they are both in
good shape for the defensive
part of the game tomorrow.
John Winterson has proven his
ability as a receiver quite a few
times this year; he and Gary
Jones will be looking for
passes. Don Kraitsik has been
doing a fine job and should be
playing tomorrow despite re-
cent injuries. Roy Lewis, a
sophomore back, has shown
what a capable runner he is,
but has been plagued by in-
juries. Al Cloud probably won’t
be playing against Beioit due
to a severe knee injury, but
until he received the injury he
was having a great season.

Even though some valuable
players haven’t completely re<
coveted yet, most of the in-
juries received in the game
three weeks ago have healed.
The team is in good shape and
the spirit is great. it we can
show the determination we had
at Knox, and play as well as we
did at Ripon, tomorrow's game
will prove to be an excellent
battle.

 

Slaie U’s Seek More Grinnell Games
As Soccer Club Displays Varsity Level

By YVOR STDAKLEY

John Hemingway, student-
coach of the Grinnell soccer
team, said on Monday that
contacts were being made with
the University of Iowa and
Iowa State University to try to
arrange games with the two
schools before the end of this
season.

Coach nemingway said that
U of I, impressed with Grinr
nails 5 t r o n g performance
against them two weeks ago,
contacted the club by phone.
So far, scheduling arrange-
ments have not been agreed
upon. The club is also trying to
secure a date with lowa State.
One of the complications in this
effort is that Grinnell's team is
a club rather than a varsity
sport.

Thus far in the season, the
Pioneers have won three
games, deleaung Cornell twice
and Carleton once. and dropped
two, a 2-1 decision to Knox and
a 32 contest to the Universrty
of Iowa.

Conch Hemingway feels that
the season has been satisiying
so far. He notes that the great-
est improvements over last
year have been team spirit,
pride, and a real desire to win.
He feels that in spite of the
talent on last year’s squad,
these important qualities were
lacking.

“The guys have shown real
good contidcnces," he come
mented. “They show up for
practices and take the respon-
sibility of staying in condition
upon themselves. As a student-
coach, I can only make sugges—
tions. The responsibility is
theirs."

Looking forward to next year,
the Pioneers should be in real
fine shape. The team will only
lose two players in graduation
— Dave North and Ray Hil-
horn. While their loss will defi-
nitely he felt, Coach Heming-
way hopes that the experience
gained this season by the five
freshmen in the lineup will take
up the slack.

Should soccer become a var-
sity sport in the Midwest Colle-
giate Conference next year,
Grinnell's Pioneers should be
stmng contenders for its first
Crown.

in compiling their line record.
they've scored 13 goals while
allowing the opposition 10. The
