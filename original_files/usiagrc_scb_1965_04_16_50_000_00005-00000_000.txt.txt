t Dorm Life New for LeMoynians

worthwhile experience in dor»

a commuter college. The stu-

and share with students from
not only this area but other
parts of the country as well.

have been White adults who
have taken courses at the Cole
logo, the Grinnellians are the
first college-aged white stu-
dents that LeMoyne has had;
their presence is helping to
break down prejudice on both
sides.

of the Negro college,” Price
said, “is that it has always op-

few graduates because many

the number was half this size.

LeMoyne is supported by the

Fund. Approximately $145,000
per year is given in student aid
in the term of scholarships,
work-study programs, and Na-

When asked about the effect
on LeMoyne of having white

“I would like to thank the

“They have made possible an

and a good deal of enjoyment.”

 

Editor Discovers Wild New Jag
To Fill Reporter's Spring Days

By Anne Farrer

Spring doesn’t grab you? The
weather’s great but your Rus-
sian hist exam isn’t? Your hay
feliel‘ activates every morning
from 6:00 to 9:47? The lounges
are too warm and the golf
course is too cold? Frustration,
boredom, the gods, and Dean
Slocum rule your life? You’re
panting for change and kicks?

Do not despair, for just as it
strives to report the news ac-
curately and well, the SM; feels
a responsibility toward and kin-
ship with the Grinnell student
body. Thus, compassionate edi-
tor John Wolf has devised a
new jag; although it doesn’t
have the infamous aura or sub-
sequent effects of glue-sniffing,
it does have its effects. What is
this saviour-toebe of the nor-
mal, average, wall—Crawling
Grinnellian? Reading back is-
sues 0f the Journal of the Pro-
ceedings of the Iowa Academy
of Science!

Well, it’s certainly new and
different — whoever heard of
anyone eagerly charging to the
library to pore over and devour
journals or the Iowa Academy
of Science? Let’s face it, abso-
lutely no one However, all is
not entirely (though almost)
lost.

Perusing the musty volumes,
one encounters many facts and
statements that do much to re-
store one’s faith in man, nature,
and science. Such is the article
presenting the problem of “How
old is the Mississippi?” which
draws the truly profound Cone
clusion, “Its prototype must

have existed at a certain fixed
time in the geologic past.”
The names of the writers are
as varied as the topics they deal
with—everything from Launce-
lot Andrews to Bruce Fink;
from “Origin of the Present
Drainage System of Warren
County" (if there happens to
be any romantics or historians
around with manias for 1891
drainage systems) to “Study of
Glands in the Hop Tree" (for
anyone suffering from mono).

The prophetic value of sci
ence is welleillustrated With the
following excerpt irom an 1890
dissertation: ”In connection
with a Casual reference to the
cenological features of Central
Iowa, mention may be made
to the recent discovery in the
drift of a mass of soft ferrugi»
nous sandstone charged with
fossils," to which anyone who
has noticed the construction of
the library or has had much ex»
perience in Burling basement
will readily attest.

Any hug for homey historical
highlights would be gratified to
discover that at Ames in 1894:
“During the month of Septem»
her, Mr. G. W. Carver brought
in a fine lot of The Apple Powr
dery Mildew." This might also
prompt some patriotic Grinnel-
lian, not wishing to be outdone
by Amos, some lunch-time to
donate his apple fritter to the
cause of science.

 

In concluding his stimulating
evening, the frustrated student
might chase down all this en-
lightening information with the
“Geological Section of the
YMCA Artesian Well at Cedar
Rapids” and employ “Synopsis
of Paleozoic Echinoids” as a
night Cap. Or better yet, he
could beat it to the Rex, and
there impatiently bide his time
hoping, praying, and living for
Spring Riot.
