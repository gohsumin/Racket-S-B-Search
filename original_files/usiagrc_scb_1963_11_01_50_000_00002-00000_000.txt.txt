Speakers, Speakers . . .

A liai'l'ic—lt editor in Gl'innell’s Information Service 1' -
cently estimated that at least 140 guest speakers will be
ten campus this yeal? For a small college this figure is
staggering,

We believe that this number is excessive, that quantity
doesn't mean quality, that tile overwhelming totill dis-
courages attendance at any of the programs.

Gl'ilincll’s year long “Seminar on Order and Person
:iity," the Program in Practical Political Education, the

Student Symposium, the International Relations Club, and,

several other campus organizations are responsible for
bringing the multitude of speakers here.

Unfortunately, many of the speakers who have come
llere thus or were not l'ewoliting' to listen to, and quite
1.3 'bly milny who are yet to come will be equally poor.

The Svmposium, for example, failed to obtain known
sveakel's for its pi'og‘ am; so, virtual unknowns in the field
(-5 communications will be here in less than two weeks.

Next year we suggest that campus in lizations as
.. unit plan how many and when speakers “'Ill be invited
i) spezl’ at Gl-iunell. We believe that by cutting down the
number of speakers and by an increase in the quality of
the who do come, campus interest would increase sub-
scantially.
