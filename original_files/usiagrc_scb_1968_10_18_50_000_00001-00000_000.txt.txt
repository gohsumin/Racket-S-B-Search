SAGA Help Cries

A group oi SAGA workers met
Thursday, October 10, to discuss
their grievances. Some of the
workers at Quad dining hall are
unhappy about the wage poli-
cies oi SAGA. Recently, SAGA,
to economize, cut down on time
allotments ior some jobs and
the number of workers on some
jobs. The unrest is present, but
the workers are as yet not uni-
ﬂed.

The group is considering ask-
ing tor a wage increase. This is
viewed unfavorably by the
Deans, who ieel it would lead
to a higher board fee and
would prompt other College
workers to ask for a wage in—
crease.

The group plans to talk to
SAGA Chuck Hand and Gary
Shaw. Future action depends
upon the outcome of these
talks.

Social Studies Grade Called
“Experiment on Experiment”

By BENSON SMITH

An appeal to the faculty at
large to use credit-fail grading
for Social Studies was passed
by a narrow margin. The deci-
sion applies only to the iirst
semester and only to this year.
According to Bernard Mergen,
Social Studies Department
Chairman, the
impetus for
the proposal
came 1 r D m
the staff. Only
eight of the 13 staff members,
however, were originally in fa-
vor of the suggestion. The pro-
posal was written up by Robert
Voertman (Social Studies Divi-
sion Chairman), Gary Cagie
(Philosophy). and Gregory
Guroii (History).

The resolution refers to the
course as experimental. Guroff
said “the objectives of the
course are not quite clear,"
and “there was a general feel-
liig that hints that what they
were trying to do was ham-
pered by grades." Tile resolu-
lion states that “standards {or
evaluation or performance is an
undeSlrable constraint on ex-
perimentation" and that “set-
ting standards should be treated
as a sequal to more basic as-
pects of the experimentation."

What we are trying to do,
said Guroii, is to get students

to investigate areas on their
own and to bring up relevant
questions. With a grading sys-
tem. he Continued, “students
typically try to come in and
figure out where a proi stands.
and then to follow that rather.
than find out where he (the
student) stands." According to
the resolution, “We can learn
more about what students may
learn from these materials if
we reduce their concern to
have us (the faculty) specify
what they should be learning in
order to score"

The fact that the request to
change to credit-fail came after
the semester was underway is
explained by the fact that
“eight of the thirteen members
of the staff were not involved
in planning or discussing the
course prior to the start ot the
Semester." Gurnff added that
many members or the stair
were not quite sure how to
handle the material. This is nut:
surprising considering that over
half of the staff did not partici-
pate in planning the Course.
This is perhaps accidentally
beneficial. Because the staff is
uniamilial’ with the material,
the opportunity for initiative on
the part of the students is
greater. when the instructorl
