CAMPUS NOTES

Grinnell will have a new
musical experience Saturday
night in Paul Zonn’s program
of contemporary compositions.
In an effort to “open minds
and make judgments on today’s
world,” Mr. Zonn is presenting
an evening of music never heard
before in this part of the coun-
Irv.

The concert, which begins at
B pm. in Roberts Theatre, con-
tains a variety of music from
electronic to open style notation
10 the more familiar sounding
"Sonata for Solo Viola."

Electronic music comes from
a tape recorder and consists
of electronic manipulation of
sound, such as that heard in
the recent Stuart Dempster con-
cert. Open style may be called
indeterminent or aeleotoric and
will be heard in “Sonorum One,"
a sound piece performed by the
Collegium Musicum.

L’Avenulra is this weekend‘s
movie, to be shown in ARH
Friday at 10:30 13.111. and Sun-
day at 9:30 pm. It is the first
of a trilogy or black and white
films by Italian director Mich-
elangelo Antonioni, the other
two being La Nntte and L’-
Eclise. Antonioni has since been
known for his color films, The
Red Desert, and, more recently,
Blowup.

Starring Monica Vitti,
"L'Aventura" is a story of
Italy's idle rich and modern
society in which a girl myster-
iously disappears on a yachting
trip. and her lover and her best

friend begin an aiiair in the
resulting vacuum.

(in a ditterent level the movie
concerns, as the other films in
the trilogy, the impermanenco
of love, the difficulty of com!-
munication. and the ease of be-
trayal of one’a self or someone
else. Again as in all the early
Antonioni tilms, the gripping
element of the film is not the
action, but the characterization.

Antonioni developed his own
style of film making, which be-
came a changing point in the
development of that art. “L’Av-
entura is perhaps the best exam»
ple of his technique and his
themes.
