hearing, that neither honesty
nor rational discourse served
his purposes. Well, let’s apply
his theory to cases other than
that of fornication in the halls,

Now daily we read of bank
robberies, car thefts, sexual
crimes against small children.
There are laws prohibiting such
acts —- but by Mr. Schneirov’s
reasoning, these laws are "il-
legal” because the crimes are
committed. We simply do not
succeed either in iorestaliing
crimes nor in apprehending the
criminals after the act, and our
failure is clearly a sign of the
lllegality or our law. One would
think that any 12 year old
child could see through Mr.
Schneirov's argument: but the
Grinnell students who support
ed Miss Bonnie Tinker’s dema-
gogic appeal yesterday — read
in a voice so low that most of
us could not hear it, though
she came through loud and
clear on the request for a
show of hands -— these stu-
dents, I submit, showed that
they lack even the intelligence
or a twelve year old. Sam
Goldwyn seems to have been
right in pegging the national
level of intelligence at that
age.

I have called the Schnelrov-
Tinker appeal for a vote from
the audience demagogic, and I
am willing to support that
term. First, the procedure was
s “hearing,” and a hearing is
not a place for s vote of any
kind. Several years ago Steve
Kent circulated three different
petitions to students, worded
in varying degrees of strength.
Then Kent added all the signa-
tures ,to the most violently
worded petition and claimed a
mandate for his famous sleep-
ln. There was demagoguery,
and dishonest manipulation,
worse than stuffing ballot
boxes. Miss Tinker’s attempt
to initiate mob rule is even
more reprehensible than Kent's
behavior. She held out before
her jury of children the candy;

sweet temptation of power snd
sex; what chance would the
doctor on trial yesterday —- the
faculty — have in a case like
that. For I submit that yester-
day's hearing was not a trial
of Richard Schneirov for forni<
cating but a trial of the faculty
for not teaching. Too many fac-
ulty members are like doctors
who prescribe candy.

Now sex and power are heady
stuii, and students appealed to
in these terms may really think
that they are voting and that
they have and are exercising
poweri What they do not see is
that they are being manipu-
lated. When the dust of the
revolution is over, they will
find that they have a new set
of masters, and one far worse
than the bumbling liberals who
now govem them. Mr. Schneir—
ov has demonstrated, by his
language and actions — the two
means we have for judging
men — that he is not to be
trusted: we find in him that
characteri it: of the liar known
as evasiveness and that charac-
teristic of the coward known as
intellectual dishonesty.

Though I don't think it will
do much good — since Mr.
Schneirov, like Mr, Nixon, is
way ahead in the public opin-
ion polis -— I should like to take
this chance to challenge Mr.
Schneirov, and any of his
friends who care to take part,
to a public dialogue, each party
having equal time to ask ques<
tions which the other must
either answer truthfully or de<
cline to answer.

Let me add that I am writ-
ing this before the court's deci-
sion ls made public. It is quite
clear that the court's decision,
unless it is "not‘guilty," will be
irrelevant, for ML Schneirov
has stated publicly that any
other verdict will be unac-
ceptable to him. The wide sup-
port given his willful dema-
goguery makes the court’s ac-
tion a mockery. Power is in
the saddle; God help the poor
pedestrian truth.

Wallace Ad Defended

To the Editor:

In her letter about why the
5&3 should not have printed
the Wallace ad, Kit Leder
seems to have missed the point
completely. Freedom of speech
is very much the issue on this
question —— the content of the
ad is not our concern.

The ad was prepared by Wa1<
lace people as part of a na-
tionwide advertising campaign
directed at college campuses.
Its purpose, like almost all po~
iitical advertising, was to get
as many votes as possible for
the Candidate, It was Wallace's
decision that this style of ad,
which like most political adver-
tlslng avoided most of the is-
sues, would get the most votes
for Wallace from the college
community. If a college news-
paper chooses to carry any po«
litical advertising, it then has
the obligation to accept all p0<
litical advertisiing. To do other-
wise would be to engage in se-
lective censorship of political
views.

it every newspaper tollowed
its editorial policy in accepting
advertising (many papers in
the South do this in fact) we
would not have seen McCarthy
ads in most papers and we
would not see ads to stop the
bombing of North Vietnam,
sponsored by long lists of col-
lege professors, which regularl-
ly appear in the New York
Times.

One could of course say that
Wallace is a racist, fascist, un-
educated, uncultured slob and
that he doesn't merit serious at-
tention. But that would mean
s line will have to be drawn
between “good" and “bad"
and, as in every censorship
question, this is impossible to
do in the context of freedom
of thought

If there is anywhere in society
that freedom or thought and
action must be defended, it is
on the college campus.

POST
MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY

For the interest of anyone
who has not yet been informed,
the first session of a Team of
Four tournament has taken
place in the Forum. In this type
or competition, one partner»
ship sits North-South while
its teammates play the same
hands East-West. Scoring is
done in IMF: (International
Match Points), in which the
number received is based on
the difference in score of a
team and its opponents on
each deal, Thus emphasis is
placed on the discrepancy in
score, as in contract bridge,
rather than on the number of
opponents outscored, as in du-
plicate. Team of Four matches
have the added advantage of
impartiality, because the big
hands held by one partnership
must be defended against by
its teammates.

The following hand was play-
ed in seven clubs, six hearts,
six clubs, and in three no trump
at different tables.

In the club contract, the dis-
tribution in hearts and the po-
sition of the Queen are declar~
er’s only problems. But even it

the Queen and the three are off-v

side, the hand is cold if two
hearts are roiled, setting up
the six and two on the board.

In actual play, seven clubs
was down one on an unneces-
sary spade finesse, six clubs
made seven, six hearts made,
and three no trump made sev-
en. If the grand slam had been
successful, the difference with
the opposing no trump score
would have been 920 points, or
14 IMP'S. The Set gave the op-
ponents a total score of 820
points, or 13 IMP's, a very
costly error swinging Z7 IMP's
between the teams, The other
two slams totaled 1390 in clubs
and 1430 in hearts for a differ-
ence of only one IMP.

The tournament will continue
