HODIEIINE EXPLAINS
HIS CONVENTION

(Editor’s Note: Bob Ho~
alarm is Editor of the official
program for the 1968 niock
presidential nominating com
ventlons.)

By BOB HODIERNE

Realism is the keynote oi the
two mock presidential nominat-
ing conventions scheduled here
for April 18-20. And while plans
are not being made at this
time to broadcast either of
them In color, the conventions
are so real that the number of
friendships being dissolved be.
cause of political rivalry is only
exceeded by the number dis-
solved by the recent student
government elections

Heading the list of attract-
lions are the two keynote
speakers. For the Democrats
the keynote speaker is Richard
G. Hotelier, Mayor oi Gary, tn-
diimﬂ, for the Republicans the
keynoter is John H. Chafee,
Governor at Rhode Island.

Hutcher is the Iii-st Negro
mayor ct Gary and one at the
first Negro mayors or a major
U.S, city. A power-ml and ef-
iectivc speaker, Hatchet- over-
came both Republican and
Democratic opposition to be—
come Gary's mayor. Hatcher
will presumably address him-
lelf to the critical situation in
the urban ghettos, a situation
made more critical by the re—
cent assassination of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King.

Chatee is Chairman of the Rev
publican Governors' Associa-
tion, This group or moderates
would have liked a governor
nominated, say, for instance.
Romney or Rockefeller. Now
they may have to be content
with making "moderate” the
Republican plattorin. Their
voice in these matters has
grown in recent years. Hence
the role that chalet: will play
In the upcoming "real" conven—
tion will be or great impor-
tance,

Those two addresses will
mark the end oi any restrain—
ed air at cosinopolitanism and
the vicious infighting of con-
vention politics as it is known
at Grillnell will begin.

For the Democrats a tough
tight between McCarthy and
Kennedy is predicted. However,
LBJ’s campus campaign chair-
man Larry Fellerntan, who in»
slate that he is a serious sup-
porter oi Johnson, is not about
to throw in the towel, even
though his candidate evidently
has. Mike Dejoie’s rloor man~
aging or the Wallace candidacy
must be suspected oi being
something less than whole-
hearted,

Prominent campus political
observers, when asked about
the Republican convention,
would no more than shrug their
shoulders and ask it yoil wanle
Ed the nomination. Well known
political phrases like “wide
open convention” were banter-
ed around a lot. Names like
Rockefeller, Lindsay, and Fer-
cy got bantered around some-
what, [00.

But all ot this just goes to
show that like the “real” nomi-
nating canyentions this summer
.lt’s, anyone's ball game,

lsm of these conventions is or-
ganist wtlliam McMairis. Mo-
Mains has been the organist at
several “real" national conven-
tions.

in sketch form this is how
both of the two conventions
will run:

The keynote address will be
delivered. Then debate on the
piatiorlns by the delegates will
begin. Debate here, as noted

on the olflcial schedule, is ex- ,

pected to center around the
war in Vietnam and the war in
the Cities Amendments, in
wi‘illen form, from [he dele-
gates, will be debated and
voted upon and tinally a plat-
form will be adopted

The next order of business
will be the nominating
speeches for President. This is
lollowed, of course, by the roll
call voting of the state delega-
lions.

A light may develop over the
certain portions or the rules
governing conduct of the vot-
ing. There are two possibli
ways for a delegation to' vote:
As a whole, that is, the major»
ity of the delegation deClding
who Shall get all of that dele«
gation’s votes (culled unit rule)
or the delegation may be split,
that is live Votes (or one cans
didate, ten for another, etc. In
most conventions either the
unit rule or the split delegar
iron rule applies.

At lhe mock Conventions at
Grinnell, as [he rules read how,
each delegate votes. on each
roll call (several may be
needed to pick a winning can.
didaie), whether it shall be
governed by the unit rule or by
the split rtlle.

Following the nomination of
a Pmsldential candidate are
the nominating speeches and
voting for a Vice Presidential
candidate

The reasons tor participating
in the mock political conven-
tions- are varied. One argument
goes that it is a good way to
get publicity tor a particular
point of view. That is, a “peace
candidate" and a i‘a d i c 81
“peace" platform would be
good publicity for that point of
View. To a limited extent [his
is the case. However, press
coverage of previous conven~
lions has been limited almost
exclusively to town papers. The
more massive of the media
have been enthilSlasth in their
disregard for the political con—
cern and belief OI Grinlleil stu-
dents.

A better argument can be
made for the familiarity with
the convention system that
these mock conventions pro-
vide. The convention, with all
its Iailings, is a common
American political tool (AbeL-
CIO and the DAR both have
conventions that are governed
by much the same set of prin-
ciples — or lack thereof) and
one who anticipates taking
part in Amerlcan political life
would he in an advantageous
position to understand what
really gets I! candidate nomi-
nated. In nus respect the mock
nomination conventions til-a

and "hey, hey, LBJ, why didn‘t
you quit before today?"

ENDORSE LBJ’s
NON-CANDIDACY
Student press reaction was
also Wlded’angmg. The Univer-
slly at Michigan Daily in ii
front page editorial said John-
son's withdrawal “should not
obscure the historic signllicance
or his drastic administration"
and called on ills successor to
make mayor changes in U.S.

policy.

The Yale Daily News said
“we enthusiastically endorse
LBJ’s non-candidacy.”

Some college editors, such as
those at the UCLA Daily Bruin,
said they might find It easier
to endorse Minnesota Senator
Eugene McCall-thy now, since it
is no longer necessary to stop
Johnson.

JOB HARDER

Leaders at the New Lett saw

Johnson’s withdrawal both helpa
ing and hurting their ettorts.

For example, observers in
California thought Johnson’:

withdrawal might help me
Peace and Freedom Movement
theret The PFM has been
ﬁghting an eltort to get its
members to rte-register as
Democrats to vote for Kennedy
or McCarthy in order to defeat
Johnson The PFM put ottt a
statement saying that now that
Johnson is stopped, opponents

of the war Should lemairi in the
PFM.

And Lee Webb, one of the Or-
ganizers oi the counterconveii-
tron planned tor Chicago at the
time of the Democratic Con-
ventlon, said .TOhnSDnS’ With-
drawal would keep the Let:

Kennedy as much as they have
and that it would also allow the
campaign to focus on the is-
sues, instead of Johnson'li per-
sonality, He doubted that it
would hurt the Lelt’s plans at
tho convention.

But Ray Mllngo, editor at
Liberation News Servioe in
Washington and another plan-
ner of actlvitles for the con-
vention; said. “It makes our
job harder. We have to per-
suade people that everything is
still the same.”

OTHER MOCKS y FAVOR MCCARTHY

from Liberation News Service

Student referential and muck
conventions are showing sup-
port for liberal candidates and
general opposition to the war
in Vietnam.

Only a tew campuses have
held conventions and referenda
so far this year. Several more
are scheduled and there will
be a national campus presi-
dential primary and referen-
dum on the war on April 24o

Students have been leaning
toward Senator Eugene McCar-
thy (D-Minn.) among the Dem-
ocrats. He has won every Dem-
ocratlc lefemndum held so for.
at such campuses as the Uni-
versity at Oregon, George
Washington University, Middle-
bury college in Vermont, and
the university ct North Caro
ltlia.

At Oregon, Middlebury, and
North Carolina McCarthy beat
both President Johnson and
New York Senator Robert Kenr
nedy. Kennedy was second at
Oregon and Middlebury but
only third at North Carolina
The George Washington vote,
which was actually a poll, gave
McCarthy 65 per cent while 81
per cent of the student’s op~
posed reelection of President
Johnson.

Oil the Republican Side, there
is no clear trend Former Vice
Presldent Richard Nixon Won

vention at the University of

son Rockefeller won primaries
at Oregon and Middlebiuy and
captured the nomination at a
mock convention at the Univer-

a convention in which the vote
was seen prirnnrlly as a protest
against the Vietnam war.
