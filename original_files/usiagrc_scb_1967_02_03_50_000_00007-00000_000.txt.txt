Kent in Vief Protest

(ACP) — Realizing that pub-
lic ridicule and a cold shoulder
from the Johnson administra-
lion have stifled the anti—Viet-
nam war movement, several
student leaders decided, last
summer, to adopt a soft-sell
approach.

The students decided to dis-
courage demonstration tactics
but rejuvenate the movement
by 1) mobilizing “moderate"
students who oppose the United
States policies in Vietnam but
who shy away from radical
tactics; 2) stimulating discus-
sion about the war; 3) dis-
pelling the notion that people
opposing the war are merely
unkempt heatnick radicals and
4) gaining the ear of the ad-
ministration by thoughtful pre-
sentation of the issues.

The first step in the new
approach was an open letter
to President Johnson. Student
leaders across the nation, in-

chlding Grinnell Student Gov-
ernment Association President,
Steve Kent, wrote President
Johnson that increasing num-
bers of students are deeply
troubled about the war and
urged him to clarify American
objectives in order to ease
doubts abouu U. s, policy.

Vietnamese Protest

Foreign Sshoois

(ACF) — South Vietnamese
students are protesting the ex~
istence of foreign schools in
South Vietnam. Saigon students
have formed the Committee
for the Use of Vietnamese at
University Level and Against
Foreign Schools in Vietnam to
close schools teaching in for-
eign la n g u a g e 5, especially
French. At a seminar held re-
cently in Saigon, a spokesman
said, “it is absurd that the
government does not control
the presence of foreign
cultures."

Credit For Work
Proposed of U. C. L A.

The U.C.L.A. “Dally Bruin”
has proposed a program pro
viding academic credit for field
work. The basis for granting
credit would be a realistic plan
for community service sponsorr
ed by a faculty member and
taken on a passrfail basis. Ex-
amination would be by oral dis-
cussion with the sponsoring pro-
fessor, supported by a short pa-
per. Credit would depend on the
amount of time and involvement
in the program ranging from
one-half course to one and one-
half courses for any given quar-
ler.

Projects it considerable dis-
tance from the campus could be
pursued during vacation periods.
The student would petition his
faculty sponsor for credit during
the quarter following his vaca-
tion project.

interpretation of the effectiveness of student rule
enforcement.

3. Question: Why was SGA granted less than
half its request for an activities fee increase?
(in what basis was this decision made, and what
financial priorities does it reflect?

Comment: The small increase in the activities
fee will seriously hamper such SEA-sponsored our
tivities as Nous, the radio station, and the number
of formal dances. It also prevents the creation of
a proposed student-financed speaker’s bureau. The
paucity of the increase ignores l) a tremendous
increase in entertainment costs 2) the fact that
our isolated environment necessitates an exclus-
ively college-based program of activities which is
dependent on adequate allotment for purchased
entertainment.

4. Question: How does the college justify aca-
demic punishment for social offenses?

Comment: The college’s continued dependence
upon separation as a punitive measure against the
individual cannot substitute for sanctions applied
within the college environment. Extreme punish-
ments intended to function as examples do not
serve a constructive purpose. The college system
of rules and punishment must realistically reflect
the community interest.

5. Questio Why does the college not consider
offrcampus living for men and women a legiti-
mate part of the resident system?

Comments: “Residential living” should not re—
strict the individual to four years of dormitory

life, The dormitory system can have values in
teaching the individual to live in a communal sit-
uation, However an institution like Grinncll must
accommodate individual differences and needs
in the determination of a living situation.

5. Question: To What extent and in what situa-
tions will the new resident advisors be responsi-
ble to the administration? Precisely what func-
tions will they assume from the hall presidents?

Comment: A statement is required of the ad-
minlstration‘s policy concerning the responsibil—
ities of the resrdent advisors. Student confidence
in the advisors can only be maintained by a
guarantee that discussions between a student and
an advisor remain striCtJy confidential, and fur-
ther, that consultation with the dean's office only
be taken with the consent of the student in-
volved.

Any duties assumed by the resident advisor
from the hall president must not jeopardize the
sovereignty of student rule enforcement.

7. Question: Finally, why is a letter such as this
necessary? Doesn’t the maintenance of a Grin-
nell College community necessitate communica-
tion between the administration and students on
vital issues?

Fulbright": Book
is PPPE Choice

Tile PPPE Political Book-Of-
the Month selection for Felr
wary-March, The Arrogance of
Power by Senator J. William
Fulbright, illustrates what one
reviewer has called “the alien-
ation of a great many thought-
ful citizens from their govem-
merit."

Fulbright, chairman of the
powerful Foreign Relatiom
committee of the U, S. Senate,
has long been a serious critic
of the Johnson administratioh
and its foreign policy. But in
this book, he goes beyond mere
criticism of U. S. policy in
Vietnam, the Dominican Re-
public or Cuba. He indicts the
American people for a collecta
ive arrogance, infecting both
our attitudes and our actions
with “an exaggerated sense of
power and an imaginary sense
of mission” that distorts not
only our national policies but
our national character as well.

The “arrogance of ower,"
says Fulbright, ls rel .ted in
the smug manners of the Arn-
erican tourist or the U.S. com
sultant to lnreign governments,
in the all too typical American
attitude of superiority to the
“underdeveloped” areas of the
world, and in an unwillingness
to understand and accept on
the part of young, emerging
nations the same revolution.

ism that accompanied the birth
and growth of our own country.
