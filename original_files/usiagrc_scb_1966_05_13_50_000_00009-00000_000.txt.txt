“llillation is the number one domestic
public enemy in the United States,”
said Miller. “This statement appeared
in my 1960 campaign brochure and it
is still true today.”

citing the rigors of $10 billion inilation
per year in the last ten years, he lika
sited it to a sales tax which is "getting
.Wcrse."

The Senator identified the Democratic
party line as “not to talk about the
present inilation, but about the ‘danger
of inﬂation} ” However, he continued, it
is not the case of the danger of infla-
tion, but rather the case of worse in-
ilation," Explaining the Republican
stand, Miller declared, “We think it is
the most nniair way to take purchasing
power away from people.”

Explaining this inﬂationary trend, Mile
ler said, “wage increases and price in-
creases are merely the symptoms of in-
ﬂation. Put the responSibility where it
belongs It is the multi-billion-dollar de<
ﬁclt Spending by the Democratically
controlled Congress which lowers the
purchasing power of the dollar."

Continuing his attack on expansive
spending, Miller cited the War on Pov-
erty. Job Corps, and old age care plans
as areas in which icderal programs
used money with extravagance and
.Waste.”

The Senator drew a laugh from the
crowd when, in reierencc to congress
ional spending, he stated that he had
discovered why the Senate was called
the Upper House—“because it’s the one
that ups the appropriations.”

0n the subject of agriculture, the Iowa
congressman asserted that there was
“a lot of misinformation and contus-
ion" on the subject. “The price squeeze
on farmers has been getting worse.”

Miller said that While there have been
price increases on the agriculture com-
modity, they are not keeping pace With
other sectors of the economy. He advos
cated trying for lot) per cent parity in
the agricultural market, which in the
last five years has generally been 7cm.

Miller's tinal speech topic was the
war in Viet Nam—“something which
every man, woman, and child in the
United States is concerned about." He
squarely blamed “something defective
about the foreign policy of the Demo-
cratic party" ior involving the United
Slates in war, referring not only to Viet
Nam but also eluding to Korea and ww
n. l-le related lhe present action to last
year‘s decision in tavor or a quick build-
up instead or a gradual buildup.

This has brought logistic problems
due to limited (locking and distributing
iaciiities, but “the military is doing a
magniﬁcent job of picking up the pieces
irom last year’s necessary decision."
Miller does not support the three-[old in<
crease in bombing since the January

First Year

Oi High School Tutoring

REACH, a community action program
designed to bring about closer contact
between the various groups in the town
of Grinnell, and especially reach a
greater understanding and a better
Working relationship between the town
and the college, has just completed its
first year of high school tutoring.

The tutoring program, existing mosily
this second semester, consisted of 18
volunteers who worked with high school
Students having difficulty in such sub-
jects as biology, English, French, and
math. The tutor usually met with the
student once or twice a Week at a time
convenient to both, such as during the
student's study hall or at night in the
college library.

The tutoring program is one phase or
REACH, which was initiated in the [all
by Jeanne Cook and some iaculty ad-
visors. Miss Cook had just returned
from a summer in Chicago working for
a REACH program there, and she saw
the need tor such a program in Grin-
nell, perhaps headed by a hill-time
recreation director.

Much of REACH is concerned with
the political structure in the town.
Hopefully, much more than the tutoring
program can be initiated and continued
nextyear.

In a REACH progress report, Miss
Cook said, “We have found that the

North Viet Nam’s petroleum supplies.

Miller concluded his remarks by call-
ing the Republicans the party of re
