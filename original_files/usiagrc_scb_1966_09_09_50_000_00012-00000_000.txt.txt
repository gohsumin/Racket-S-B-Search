CC Squad Shorthanded

Under new head coach Ray
bermiller, the Pioneer cross
ountry team will start the
o‘eason next Friday against
Drake.

onerniiller faces a tough
task in his opening year as he
has only a skeletal squad of
six men reporting for the
varsity. Four other runners
decided not to come out this
year or are injured.

Four or the six, though, are
returning lettermen and will
form the nucleus of the team.
Co - captains are senior Steve
Brintnall and junior John

Sharpe. Sharpe was second in
the conference meet last year
and Brintnall was also a high
ﬁnisher,

The other four are juniors
Doug Dray and Spencer Clark
and non - lettermen Steve Hoitze
and Steve Montgomery.

Despite the very small squad,
Coach Obermiller is confident
this team will develop into a
very strong unit, He cites the
dedication and spirit of his boys
as the reason for his optimism.

Coach Obermiller also has 14
boys out for freshman cross

nature of the problem. For so
long had Southerners been ac-
customed to the apathy of the
Negroes that during the last ten
years the mere vision of a
group of Negroes walking down
the street was suificiem to al.-
tract attention and concern.
This was phase one. As the
southern Negro b e c o m e s
trapped in the ghettos of the
northern city his awareness of
his status in society is inten-
sified. Conditions which in some
ways are far worse than in the
South amplify his discontent.
Riots are an inevitable occur-
rence and might be considered
phase two, the phase of this
decade. Whether riots are spon-
taneous or externally ignited is
almost irrelevant. The. kindling
is there and gets drier each
moment,

The certainty of riots and
more riots in the northern cities
unless something drastic is done
to avoid them, ioreshadows sim~
ilar reactions in the South as
Negro pride and self-awareness
reach higher and higher levels
relative to conditions,

Drr King and SCLC in Chicago
have thus far been Very cautious
about openly speaking in terms
of “black power." However.
King is well aware that his best;
bargaining position with Mayor
Daley over specifi issues is the
tool that "peaceiul" demonstra-
tions may easily become vio-
Ient. King may be diplomatic in
handling it, but the essence of
his strength is his ability to
cause disturbances which are
highly embarrassing to a city
and which will get a response,
if only for the reason that
they're violent.

In its larger sense the real
essence of black power is that
the militant Negro is tired of
iruitiessly struggling with symp-
toms of his problem in America
(such as segregation) and is
tired of watching half his broth-
ers lie back in fear and apathy
while the other half struggles to
achieve acceptance as a white
man. The militant wants accep-
tance of the Negro for what he
