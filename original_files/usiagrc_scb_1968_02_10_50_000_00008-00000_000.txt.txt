fact seems to reflect an attitude
by college administrators which
cannot be praised.

That this (act has exlsted for
such a long period of time to-
cuses attention upon Griiinell
students who allow the admin-
istration to be so complacent.

There appears to be no quick
solution to the “problem”, but
prompt and convincing action
by all three groups must be
initiated immediately to assure
the black students on campus
protection trot-rt the animosity
oi bigotry which encompasses
the town of Grlnnell.

Although attitudes will take
some time to change, belligerent
behavior can and must be con-
trolled at all costs, Hence. only
ellorts by all three groups will
insure the wellare of black stu«
dents on Grinnell campus,

IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT

SMITH COOKS HOME BREW

By RUSS ELLIOT
5&3 Staff Writer

In the oldest men's residence
hall west 01' the Mississippi a
few men are trying to revwo
an aglllg tradition —- Winemak-
ing.

In recent weeks hall interest
has been running high over the
possibilities winemaklng could
otter to another North campus
tradition _ the weekly znnk-
out. The stnli is easily made.
As one fellow articulated, “any
blockhead could put it together;
you just dump everything in
and let It sit."

When the pioneer batch was
opened and sampled this week,
however, the men’s spirits
seemed in danger of being
dashed on the rocks The pro-
duct, which has no name, was
compared to everything from
sake (rice wine) to Wild Irish
Rose.

What did the tasters think of
It? A few typical reactions:

“It tastes like hell.”

“It’s about the heaviest crap
I've ever tasted.”

“It's not clear like wine
should be, it’s soupy. No, it's
not soupy — it’s syrupy."

”It’s shit.

“It's too sweet. Low alcohol
content. And It's got some suit

of obnoxious taste that burn;
your mouth out. It's not smooth
and cultured,"

And in a Candid moment:

“I don’t care What it tastes
like, if it’s got alcohol in it I'Ll
drink it."

In case you are interested In
trying it, the reclpe includes
grape juice, sugar, yeast, rai.
sins, and water. Gallon jugs,
easily attainable from town
merchants make excellent con-
tainers {or the brew.

A rubber balloon should be
placed over the neck ot the
bottle, and the mixture set in
a warm place.

And some further inimrmation
about wine — though you can't
buy it, sell it or drink it pub-
licly, if you’re under twenty.
one, no place in the 720 Chap-
ters of the Iowa Code prohibits
you horn making it (privately).
