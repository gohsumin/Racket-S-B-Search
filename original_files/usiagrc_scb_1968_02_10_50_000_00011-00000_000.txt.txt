Various reasons tor the can-
cellations were given by Heath-
er Foote who headed the plan-
ning committee.

Joel Fort, University or Calla
iornia sociology lecturer, must
leave early to teach a class at
Berkeley Saturday morning.
Due to the limited transporta<
tion out of Des Moines, he was
forced to cancel his Friday aft-
emoon panel, and Friday eve-
ning discussion, Heather said.

John Finlator had “business
in Washington," and Daniel
Freedman, oi the University oi
Chicago, who had been sched<
uled since November, “decided
he couldn’t make it."

Replacing Finlator, who is
Director or the Federal Bureau
of Drug Abuse Control, will be
his assistant,.Frederick Gal“
field.

Lauren Woods, chairman of
the university oi Iowa’s pharm-
acology department, will re
place the long scheduled Freed-
man.

IlcOIIRTHY SUPPORT BEGINS HERE

Grinnell support for McCarthy
for President is actively under-
way. Last w e e it end three
"prominent” lacuity members
(Joseph Wall, C. Edwin Gil-
mour and Edward Moore) met
with Curtis Gans, National
Democrats for McCarthy coor-
dinator for the states not hav-
ing primaries.

Gans assured the Iowa group
or a personal visit by McCarthy
this spring either before the
county or the state presidential
conventions.

The lowa Democrats for Mc-
Carthy have hired a full-time
secretary and are opening an

office in downtown Des Mulnel
next week. They are attempting
to secure commitments from
prominent lowa Democrats to
serve on the McCarthy stats
steering committee.

G r i n n e l l supporters have
pledged $200 to be raised be-
fore February 15, the date of
the organizational meeting for
Poweshiek C 0 ll 11 t y. Edward
Moore has personally requested
llnanclal support from the Col.
lege community.

interested persons have been
encouraged to write and/or send
money to Box 103, West Des
Moines.

One rather articulate male
ireshman noted the obVious dis-
advantages to the new hall
system as he saw them.

First, he said, the new system
would “seriously damage the

1M program (one oi the lew
participated sports ieft)?’

Second, "long-range invest-
ments (TVs, ping pong tallies,
etc.) would become non-exis<
tent due to the cost of one
year's enjoyment."

And third. “the cost of
changing dorms lrol'n men's to
women's, and DI the new re-
oeption (control) center—when
our Treasurer says were al-
most bankrupt,” are obvious
drawbacks. he concluded.

resentatives.”

“The Republicans are trying
to capture enough states so we
can choose the President or the
United States. For that," he
added, “we’re trying to do you
all a favor."

"Most ol the Democrats in the
State," Edwards later remarked,
“are a bunch oi prostitutes (‘it
you ladies will excuse me‘), do-
ing what George (Wallace) tells
them to do."

“This smacks of Huey Long-
Ism in a way, in the power that
this man hasl"

“What we're trying to do in
the South," he elaborated, is
approach (partisan politics) with
a zeal that approaches ideal-
ism.”

“Only in the recent past have
we made any in-roads (in the
South)."

Seventy per cent at the voter-
In the Deep South are Indepen-
dents, Edwards said, and this
is good because “everyone used
to be Democrats because that
was the only thing they onuld
be.”
