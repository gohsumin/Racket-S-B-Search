New AWS Pres. Stresses
Initiative. Communication Representative

By Mary Malcolm

Leida Schoggen, newly elected president or the AWS board, is
anything but a veteran of campus politics. A transfer irorn Park
College. St. Louis, in 1965, and a participant in the Washington
semester last tall, Leida possesses an unusual enthusiasm and
optimism about Grinnell Virtually undiminished by the two se-
mesters she has spent on campus.

While uninitiated in Grinnell
campus politics, Miss Schog~
gen's experiences as a political
science major, a student or
Headstart last semester in
Washington, a worker with pre-
school oulturaiiy deprived stu<
dents last summer and iemale
delinquents the previous sum-
mer, indicates her ability to
deal with people and their prob«
lems.

As AWS board president,
Miss Schoggen is concerned with
“process.” She indicated the
most important concern lor next
year's student leaders will be
to continue and expand the pro-
cess of communication and stu-
dent initiative begun by the
Kent administration.

With reterence to working out
a satisfactory hall residents
system on South Campus she
said, “It’s going to work, be-
cause we're going to make it
Work,"

Miss Schoggen’s enthusiasm
for Grinnell derives partly
from comparison with Ameri-
can University, location or the
Washington semester. She
found that Grinnell in general
takes itseli less seriously, is
more relaxed and more recep
tlve to dliterent ways or feeling,
thinking and behaving. “When
I came back here I could re—
lax, and it wasn't that I didn’t
love Washington and the pro—
gram," she said. “At Grinliell
you feel tree to express how
you think and teel about things."

Delta Ministry, o church-spon-
sored civil rights organization,

interested in community and
economic development ior Ne
groes in Mississippi and work
with people in local communi-
ties towards these ends. This,
of course, encompasses all areas
at lite, including politics, which
this year are extremely im-
portant. Our priority for l.%‘1
is the local elections which

registered in any number.”

Economics and Education

The Delta Ministry has func-
tioned in Mississippi since the
Ialioi1964. it is concerned with

economic development, encour-
agement of public responsibility,
and education among the dis-
possessed. Also essential to the
success of the Delta Ministry
is the work with the white and
the middle-class Negro com-
munities. Mount Beulah is the
Ministry's headquarters, and
twice has been used to house
groups of homeless people on
cotton plantations

The Board of Religion is
sponsoring Miss Geiger’s visit
in the hope that Grinnell stu-
dents might be interested in
working on the project during
spring Vacation or helping the
Ministry indirectly. The coffee
hour will be at 4 p.m. in the
South Lounge.

College Seeks NSF Grant

By Pat Smith

Grinnell has applied to
the College Science improve-
ment Program at the National
Science Foundation for a $193,000
grant ior expansion within the
natural and social science da-
partmenis.

The application speciﬁes that
the grant would establish a
researchestudy fund, a sat»
batical assistance fund, a fac-
ulty seminar program and tield
studies in anthropology and bi-
ology.

Stated objectives for expan-
sion within the biology, Chemis-
try, physics, mathematics, an-
thropology, economics, political
science, and sociology depart<
merits include: (1) “improved
conditions of scholarship con.
ducive to attraction and main<
tenance of a faculty of high
nroiessional quality." (2) “up
ﬂooding of faculty confidence in
subject matter areas,” (3) “up-
grading ot student seientiiic
confidence and encouragement
oi related pedagogical experi-
mentation in science education,"
and (4) ”expanded opportun~
ities for field studies in bio-
logical and social sciences."

The live speciﬁc allocations
ot the grant are designed to
luliiil the objectives. The re-

search-study fund would enable
faculty members to participate
in summer study projects and
summer research projects.

The sabbatical assistance fund
would increase the salary of a
biology, chemistry, or physicl
protessor trom one semester's
pay to a full year's pay full
the year he takes his leave.
(Currently, a professor is given
a semester's salary for an ab-
sence of either a semester or
a year.)

The faculty seminar program
would establish regular semi~
nars ior protessional studies.
and as this would necessitate
a lighter teaching load, the iund
would permit the hiring or extra
professors. A field program tor
