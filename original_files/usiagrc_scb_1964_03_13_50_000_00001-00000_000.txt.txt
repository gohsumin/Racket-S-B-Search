Hughes Displays Political ‘Finesse’
Morrisons Make‘A Shaky landing

By Dave Baetz

Iowa Governor Harold E.
Hughes gave a group of inter-
ested Grinnell students a prac-
tical lesson in the easiest way
to skim frosting off a “politi-
cal cake" here last week—he
sat on one! 1

Featured, along with Gov-
ernor Frank B, Morrison, Ne:
braska, as one of the weekend’s
“politicians in r e s i d e n c 8"
Hughes gave his accidental Sit-
on demonstration last Thurs-
day night in Langan hall.

The local Tasty Pastry shop
had prepared the giant cake,
complete with Iowa and Nebras-
ka official State Seals, for pre~
sentation to Hughes just prior
to a late night political “bull-
session” in Langan lounge.
Before the presentation could
be made, however, Governor
Hughes Went into the room
where the cake was hidden to
make a telephone call. He
emerged seconds later grinning
broadly, with a tell-tale chunk

* * *

 

of frosting clinging to the Seat
of his pants.

While all of Governor Hughes‘
problems occurred after he had
reached the campus, Governor
Morrison, for a time, had seri-
ous doubts that he and Mrs.
Morrison would ever arrive in
Grinnell.

The Morrisons were sched-
uled to arrive at the Grinnell
airport last Wednesday at 6:00
pm. However, due to a snow-
storm, gusty winds and a low
cloud ceiling over the area,
they couldn’t locate the air-
port once they got here and fi-
nally had to turn back and
make a shaky landing in New-
ton. They finally arrived on
campus by car at about 9:30
p. in.

After both, Governors were
safely at Grinnell, they spent
two days attending classes,
meeting with students and fac»
ulty over coffee, attending cam-
pus events and participating in
late-night bull sessions in col-
lege dormitories.

The Governors, accompanied
by an army of newsmen, at-
tended the Political Process
class Thursday morning and a
Seminar in American Studies,
where the press brigade was
turned back, early in the after-
noon.

While Gov. Morrison, pic-
ured below eating breakfast in
Cowles, flew back to Omaha for
an important meeting Thurs-
day afternoon, G o v e r n o r
Hughes, 6’3” and 235 lbs,
donned some basketball togs
and took to the court for a short
workout with the Grinnell var-
sity. Hughes, a former high
school basketball star froin Ida
Grove, sank one out of five free
throws and spent some time
talking with members of the
team before heading for the
showers. (Picture, Page 3.)

Thursday night the YD's and
YR’s co-sponsored a banquet
for the Governors and their
wives, Mrs. Hughes arrived
late that afternoon, and then
the first families attended the
Lenox Quartet concert. Govern-
or Hughes spent the night in
Langan, Governor Morrison
slept in West Norris and Mrs.
Morrison stayed in Haines. Mrs.

Hughes returned to Des Moines
Thursday night.

Faculty Wives

Mrs. James Stauss and Mrs.
Merritt Ludwig were hostesses
at a Faculty Wives' tea Thurs‘

d a y afternoon at Grinnell
House.

held throughout the year to as-
5lst new faculty wives in becom-
ing acquainted. The last tea

this school year was in the fall.
