ber of supporting calls she received.
Several callers giving support explained
that they had not been able to support
(or understand) earlier demonstrations.
In summarizing her hope for the effect
of the demonstration, Miss Malcolm
said, “We’re aware of the possible nega-
live results, but feel that, overall, the
good will outweigh the bad.”

Perhaps the good has already begun to
overbalance the bad. At a group discus-
sion Wednesday, organized by the par-
ticipants, dissident Views were aired and
communication was reached.

Most or those witnessing the demon-
tratlon Wednesday characterized their
own reactions as "edgy” or “embar-
rassed at first" but, having overcome
the initial shock, felt no oliense by the
others’ nudity. One student remarked
that it was the most meaningful demon-
stration as directed against Brice Drap~
er, representative of Playboy, was iairly
ineffective. Draper, although somewhat
shaken, joked through the situation and
then continued to answer questions after
the students had sung "You've got to
Walk That lonesome Valley”. Many
seemed to feel, also, that the participants
must have had to anticipate the sensa-
tionalism the demonstration would cause,
and, ior that reason, questioned the par-
ticipants use of sensationalism to give
backing to their protest.

Outside negative reaction to the dem-
onstration was first received by the
Admissions Office. Mr. Paul Tonic, an
admissions counselor in the office, said
that they had had a call Thursday morn-
ing, the morning after the demonstrae
tion, irorn the father of a student already
admitted to next year’s freshman class
on the early admissions plan. He can-
celled his daughter’s place in the class,
giving the demonstration as the reason.
Torno, who is one of the college’s repre-
sentatives for prospective students in
Iowa, stated that demonstrations in the
past seem to have been responsible for
a drop in number of iowa applications,
although “the quality or the applications
has remained high.”

Mr. James Avison, Director of Devel-
opment. already has a tile iii irate letters
written in response to the demonstra-
tion. One, from an alumnus who is can»
ceiling a three-year pledge, includes the
Comment that students do not need his
money because they are so omniscient
that they do not need to go to college at
all. Another points out the difference be-
tween the liberal tradition at Grinnell
and the present anarchy, ”which no
amount of money can help". Avison
comments, “The stripetease doesn’t
bother me; what does bother me is that
the incidents are designed to hit the
papers; and they do, from coast to
coast.” He adds that all he can say to

Project AIM

East of lmmortaﬁty

By LYNN ADAMS

In Des Moines, Washington, Chicago,
Boston, and beginning in New York.
alumni oi Grinnell are contacting other
alumni to get three-year pledges (maln~
ly) for AIM, the college's largeescale
iund raising program.

The brochure explaining the program
and its goals contains a card which lists
the amount of money it takes to name
something. So lar no one has come up
With 31,000,000 to name the P. E. com-
plex, but in it there will be the Robert
Weitzman Weight Room. For those at
you who are interested, it only costs
$1500 to name a P. E. secretarial oiilce,
or a student room in the projected new
coed residence hall. To name the resi<
dence hall costs $500,000; or it can be
done in the name of someone gone but
not forgotten: how about the Richard
Schnelrov Hall? or the David M. Gibson
Memorial Sauna (or $10,000? or the Mela
ly Malcolm Women's equipment Room,
for 32500? To name the Field House costs
$500,000; the lobby $50,000; a Handball-
Squash Court $20,000; a reSidence Liv:
lng Room $5000; an Outdoor patio $7,500;
I wonder what it would cost to name a
john?

So far pledges and cash totaling
33.6%.467 have been received toward the

ﬁ__

the oifended is that “Their motivation
was pure.”

And so goes the Grinnell reaction.
Reaciion and response seem to have
been the passwords surrounding the
Playboy protest. To say the least, the
response has been unsettling to watch,
however. It’s a bit scary to see how
many times the opinion of the protest
given torth has been controlled by
someone or something outside of the
person talking, such as the practicality
of an admissions quota, the state of
mind of a principle donor, or a friend’s
opinion of Olle’s own opinion. Hope-
fully, the demonstration of pride and
respect or the human body given in
Gales lounge has provided as students
with more than a light conversation
topic. If it has aided the process of
chipping away at our comfortable,
exclusive padding of liberalism, ra-
dicalism, lascism, (insert your
individual catagory if you’ve stopped
questioning), that’s good. if it has
brought us it glimpse of Ihe human
body as awunder to be celebrated (do
you remember a few important feel-
ings when you were a little kit”),
that’s good. If It has brought us I
glimpse of some other way of living
(A very different way, without neces-
sarily including the customs that sur-
round us and nimble around inside of
us now), that‘s good. If it has brought
us I glimpse oi something (anything)
we‘ve never seen before, (or perhaps
seen and forgotten), that’s good.

To the extent that we've had these
glimpses, we thank you. people

AIM First Phase goal of $10 million by
June 30, 1972. This does not include the
government grant of $540,000 and govern-
ment loan or $943,000 toward the $2.2
million P. E. Complex. The long-range
goal is $25 million.

AIM is divided into "People and
Programs with an objective of 55,-
709,000; and "Programs for Build-
ings”, with an objective of $4,291,000.
This means that slightly more than
hall of the projected money is to fill
needs tor closing the gap between
tuition and costs, new teaching pro-
jects and research for both faculty
and students, sophisticated equip
ment, student aid to keep Grinnell
trom becoming only for the attluent,
higher salaries for faculty, new curri-
culum offerings, and library expan-
sion.

An example of a current AIM-funded
program is the Milwaukee Theater se~
master. The AIM program got an experi-
mental grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation for it. James 0. Avison, di-
rector oi development, says one can bet
that anything new that takes money is a
part ot me AIM program.

The "Program for Buildings" is cur-
rently relocating the track and field
across Tenth Avenue where the bull-
dozers recently cut up the grass and took
out the apple trees. The P. E. complex
will be built just east ot and overlapping
the present Ward Field.

The South Campus Reception Center is
an already-completed AIM project. The
new residence hall, to be built where the
swimming pool now stands, renovations,
and retirement of the debt the college
assumed to build the new B and G bulld-
ings are other First Phase AlM objec-
tives. Projects for the second phase are
a central dining hall east of Darby, and
a Fine Arts Museum, next to Barber
Plaza. However, the trustees have not
yet approved a new dorm, dining hall
or museum.

The college’s trustees themselves
are heavy contributors to AIM. De~
velapment personnel show college
plans to all kinds or Foundations;
this is the fund-raising procedure of
AIM. Avison lists reasons why indivi-
duals give to AIM: others are doing
it; they love the institution; gifts to
Grinnell are tax—deductible; often for
a reeling of immortality through it
useful monument. Perhaps those
seeking immortality are thuse most
incensed by irreverence toi- indi-
lion and pressure for change. Alumni
probably leei nostalgic. These, along
with moral judgments, I propose as
reasons individuals do not give to

AIM.

as well as the allocation of resources
for the various divisions, and a respon-
sibility over all budgets.

Dean Stauss has been a faculty mem»
bar at Grinneli. since 1946, and has been
dean of the college since 1960. He served
as acting president (or more than a year
in 1964 and 1965, after the resignation of
Dr. Howard R. Bowen to become presi—
dent of the University of lowa and prior
to the election of Dr. Glenn Leggett as
his successor. Mr. Siauss plans to teach
and do writing and research on higher
education alter this year.

President Leggett called Mr. Stauss'
recommendations “very well thought out
and precise" and said that he was “very
favorable” to the report. Dean Stauss
will release copies of his report and rec-
ommcndations in the near iuture. He has
been asked to speak to the student body
about his recommendations as soon as

.7 he finds time.

) Investigation

(Continued from Page If

the college 'looks bad’, and that who
its good action is publicized, even my
will somehow be suspect. . .At any rat
we do make the point that your acti‘
has left the human issues less useiul ‘
defined, and in some quarters has ge
erated a reaction antagonistic to the co
lege. . .We would invite you and/or yo
parents‘ to discuss the implications
this incident with us. "

Comment by the demonstrators and
others on this letter contained threl
objections. First, that opinions as to
the damage done the college were pres
sented as fact. Second, that the letter
was sent to parents before the student
were informed. Several people pointe
out that in the cases of some siudenis,
this was deﬁnitely a punitive action.
Third, that the letter was sent to the
parents of one student who removed
only his shoes and socks in sympathy
with the protesters.

Wednedsay night the senate passed a
resolution seriously questioning the “colic
duCt of the Dean's Office in handlin
the matter." They recommended the
the Judicial Council consider these ads
tions and their implications.

Recent events that the actions of the
Attorney Generals’ office will over-
shadow the importance of college and
city lotions for most students.
