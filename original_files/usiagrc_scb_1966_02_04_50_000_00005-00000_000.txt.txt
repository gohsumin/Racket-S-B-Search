Dona/toe Stages a Living Drama

By SUE BAUMER

The audience sat waiting for the
play to begin, while the cast
milled around, as if it tau was
waiting for something to happen—

perhaps the entrance of the main
actor.

A casually dressed, bearded
man, holding a cigarette, saun~
tered in and then began the drama

The bearded mali, none other
than Ned Donahoe (speech and
theater) brought to us, an aiidie
enoe of reporters for the Sim, dur-
ing a rehearsal of the. coming
play, Antigone, not only the drama
of the play itself, but also the
drama of director and actors
working together.

does a person when trying to ex-
plain something accurately,

The plot at Antigone by Jean
Amourlh is adapted from the
Greek play or the same name by
Sophocles. it has the same char-
acters as the Greek play, but the
language and dress is modern.
The problem or resolving one’s
individual conscience with the dice
tates of the state or society forms
the core of the play. This problem
is obvtously a universal one, dwelt
with by Thoreau in "Civil Disn-
bedience,” Plato in his “Diae
logues,". and applicable to Civil
Rights and the viet Nain situa-
tion today.

The ancient Greek play Anti-
gone involves two sons and two

and Ihe cast. Donahoe alternated
between talking to us, playing a
role, and actually directing the
scenes. The problem that came up
during a rehearsal were to us,
very nontheater-orientated people,
ones that we have never consider-
ed.

For example, she Monto, who
plays Antigone, and Ken Hicks,
who plays Haeinon, the son of Cre-
on, must embrace in one scene
for a Considerable lime (as em—
braces go) and the problem arises
as to what they are to do during
that time, so that they appear
natural and so that the right ento-
Iion is Created, but there is a limit
to what one can do on the stage. ..

Although the set for this play is
very simple, consisting oi tour

THE SISTERS ANYIGONE AND ISMENE {Sue Manic. Becky Hill] run through rehearsals oi
Jean Anhouil's Antigone with director Ned Donahoe (speech and theatre]. Antigone opens
in Robert; Theatre Saturday. February 12.

Rehearsals for Antigone are be-
ing held in Arena Theater, which

is a square-shaped room, very
self-'contairied and smug. it a room
can be that. Most rooms are con-
nected to other rooms or halls,
hut Arena Theatre appears to the
person inside to be “self-suffi»
Clem." Donahue came in five or
ten minutes after we did, but
while we were outsiders in the
room, he was very much a part
ofit.

Before the rehearsal started,
Donahoe tried to explain the
meaning of the play to us, and
how the scenes we would see dur«
ing the rehearsal would relate to
this meaning. He was very earnest
in his explanation. as if the play
were his "baby” and he wanted
to see it treated right by the
press, but also because we were
part ot that great mass called au-
dience that a director is always
trying tn reach, He spent consider-

daughters of Oedipus and his
brother-in-law Green, who is now
king of Thebes. The two brothers
have killed each other as a result
of civil war. Creon, supposedly
tor the sake ot justice and order,
but actually for political reasons
has ordaitiéd that one of the
brothers be left unburied—Carrion

one of the sisters, defies the edict
and Duties the corpse because
she believes it must be done for re-
ligious reasons.

As we watched the play, Dona-
hoe pointed out to us the impor-
tant lines and cmcial scenes. He
was so involved in the play him-
self, that we were led. almost
dragged into involvment also. Al-
though it was a rehearsal, with a

ness and interruptions, the power
at the play did come through both
generally and in the important
lines. perhaps the key line of the
play is the statement by Antigone:
“And what a person can do. a
person must do."

But even more “grabbing" than
the play itselt was the rehearsal.

The rehearsal started late be-
cause Max Heltgott, who is the
Chorus, neglected to wake up in
time fui‘ if. It is possible that he
never did wake up completely.
When the rehearsal started we
found ourselves watching the play
itself and another play created by
the exchanges between Donahoe

 

chairs, a table and a bench, the
actors must still get around it,
rather than walking through it
(although they did try this).
Bruce McConachie, who as Creun
has a rather villainess role, was
forced to jump straight over the
bench at one point and you could
almost see the sword flashing and
his eyes glinting—if you can im-
agine Bruce McConachie's eyes
glinting.

Antigone will be presented Feb-
ruary 12 and 13.

gestions were not merely his own
ideas, but “a synthesis of ideas
from many people inside and out

wished to speak as a disinter-
ested student “ill an appeal to
the floaling vote.”

Shender felt that under Gori-
datd’s proposal, the hall presi—
dents would be heavily burdened
with added responsibility and
would have' more difficulty in
functioning in their roles as liall
leaders. He also expressed tear
that the presidents would be
forced to speak the language oi
those with whom they would be
more closely associated—the ad-
ministration.

He then gave his evaluation of
the role of student government.
“SGA is really a game, its value
lies not so much in its effectiveness
but ln the vigor With which the
game is played. If we restrict sni-
dent government to a small group
of wellspaid individuals we are re-

plained Senator Rick Heilhron.

Heiibron explained his change of
heart with the View that “People
who support abolition of student
government are those who are ig-
nurant of its functions and those
who break the rules most often.
If the new proposal is adopted,
it will alienate good people iiom
student government, and I think
the Senate is a place where tal-
ented, cieative people can provide
their services.”

Before the proposal was defeat»
ed, Goddard said he was very
gratiiied that people inside and out-
side of the Senate have been
moved to giving some serious
thought to the future of student
government, “I think if we culi-
sider ourselves a governmental
association, we must realize that
there is a job to be due, rather
than a game to he played.”
