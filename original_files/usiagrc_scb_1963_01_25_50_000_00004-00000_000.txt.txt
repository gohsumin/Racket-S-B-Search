All,

By Phil King
(Special Asst. Sports Editor)

The Pioneers have their flask cut out for them if they
expect to get back into contention in the MCAC basket-

Jim Len

tball race. Currently immersed in ninth place with a 2-4 1’

record, Grinnell could leap all the way to third by taking
the next three games; Thursday at Monmouth, and 2t pairl
here, tomorrow against Lawrence, and Tuesday against Coe.

So for this season Coach John Pfitsch’s charges hovel
sorely mlssed the passing and scoring ability and ﬂoor
leadership of three-time All Conference selectee Bob Mus-
ser. His consistent play and the scoring bursts of George
Gray are the difference between last year’s championship
outfit and the current aggregate.

But‘ with five of the 1961-2 Squads key men back,'
along Wlth several fine sophomores, it seems just a matter
of time before everything jells. And the time could be now.

Tuesday afternoon the team sclimmaged the fresh,
and. after the yearlings piled up a. 40-27 halftime lead
agalnst the second string, a. quintet lof Mifflln, Sun-
dell, Sellergren, Clyde Smith and Gar Smith took over
and led the Varsity to a 91-67 win. ‘

Sixty-three points in a half is impressive indeed, as
well as is the stingy man to man defense which limited
the freshmen to 17 markers. , ,

Tomorrow Grinnell will be faced with the problem?
of what to do about Lawrence’s Joel Ungrodt. Ungrodt, 21
5‘10" junior, is averaging 20.4 points per game, and last
week recorded the season’s individual high for the confer».
once as he tallied 37 against Carleton. Lawrence Won that‘
game, 77-74, and that, coupled with their 74-62 triumph‘
over St. Olaf, puts them in third place with a 4-3 record.
Coe, also sporting a 4-3 mark, is led by Wylan Witte (19.6),
and Ken Moeller.

After Tuesday, things get no easier. For in two
weeks, the Pioneers play their lone remaining non- l
conference game, as they entertain Ferndock State
College, Horn, Ind. Sparked by small college All-Ameri-
can Clyde Creel, the Ferns have rolled over all eleven
of their early season opponents.

Featuring a controlled attack and a sticky 1-1-3 zone
defense, ESE. has, in the Words of athletic director Stub
by Lishness, “revolutionized basketball here in southwest-
ern Indiana." Currently involved in their own interim
reading session, Ferndock’s last outing was January 8th
against Southern Indiana. They Won that contest 74-39,
