8:45 —— Arrival at Grinnell
College. Intention was to take a
pig out to lake and slaughter it.
Driver had 9 o’clock class. He
took keys of car with him to
class. Meanwhile B846 men are
unloading chairs into Langan
basement for lounge party that
night. A B&G man nlused how
he recalled that a pig was once
slaughtered in a men’s hall a
few years back. It takes a long
time to roast a pig. The keys
to the trunk were in class. Lan-
gan basement shower is a clean,
tiled, sunken affair, The site
of the death was fixed. 'lhe
tools were moved into place:
a stout machete, razor sharp;
one 4'lncll Switchblade; and 4
razors in! debrislling: 2 Tech-
ntatics (they weie poor; had to
rotate the blade too frequently),
a Gillette stainless and a Super
Blue.

BIAS—Pig had freed itself in
trunk; it “squealed out” of the

quickly subdued to the credit
of our football training.

9:55—Pig carried into shower
room and hung upside down on
towel hook.

9:56—Pig was stuck. Pig
squeals. Mr. Pomerenk called
by persons unidentified. B&G
men come and watch proceed~
lugs. “Some of them thought it
was a very funny caper. Others
didn’t.” Pig is still squealing
due to botched lob. Machete
is seized and squeals stop.

10:10—Last sign of hie exists
from pig. Enter Mr. Pomcrenk
"What are you doing? Who is
in charge here?" (silence) A
freshman (never having seen
the director of residences, think-
ing he was a parent) “We’re
slaughtering a pig. IIc's hung
upside down. It'll be kosher.
And we’ll give the entrails a
Christian burial.”

Mr, P: “Why here?"
frosh: “Where else? Mac
field?”

Mr. P: “DO you think the
college should provide you with
slaughtering facilities?”

RADIO TURNED OFF

Members of the executive board of the fetal radio station re-
signed en masse last week

Following the example of station manager Babak Armajahl,
they dated their resignations January 3. They Will withdraw
them, though, if the station is operating by that date.

At an open Senate meeting Tuesday, Atmajani explained that
the board members are frustrated, and cannot continue to work
without results. They hope to coerce the college administration
into getting something done.

The pressure seems to be taking effect. Armajani says so
much has been accomplished this week “it would make your head
spin.”

Evan Walden promises that the station's studios will be
completed by December 18, but, notes Armajani, “I won't be com
pletely optimistic until we're on the air."

Reviewing the history of the station, Armajani said the idea
of reviving the radio station was germinated about two and a half
years ago. There had been a station on campus some years before.
The college administration was cool to the idea, even alter the
Student Government Association agreed to ﬁnance it.

A group of students then formed the organization of the station
and submitted a detailed plan with a budget included, to the ad-
ministration. The administration was then willing to commit itself
to the idea. The executive board hoped to have the station on the
air at the beginning of this semesterr

Since then, Armajani said, the station’s studios have been lo-
cated in just about every building on campus, and after seven
months the station is still not on the air.

The station‘s staff at its peak included one-tenth of the student
body, Armajani told the meeting. They were very active in train-
ing and discussion sessions at ﬁrst, but are now demoralized.
They do not feel that they are accomplishing anything.

Armajani still has hope that the station will be broadcasting
by January 3 and that it will not be engulfed in a “bureaucratic
quagmire," If the station is not on the air by January 3 and the
board resigns, Armajani expects to reorganize the board when
and if the studios are completed.

“Too much has been done by too many people to let the thing
die on paper,” he said.

persuaded by the obvious.)

Mrs. Leotta Anderson, is re

10:30—Dean arrives. The stu-
dents involved have nothing but
praise for the way the dcnn
handled the situation.

Dean (softly): I want that
pig out of here. I don’t want

to see it on campus. And I
don’t want to see any parts of
it on campus.

Student: “I’ll take it out im-
mediately.”

it really had a ring to it”.)

Bentzinger explained

Concern was voiced by Iowa
State Professor David Metzler
over the type of issue to be
Considered by the council. “It
seems we can accept breadth
in relation to our issues, but
most of the time, in coordinate
areas,” he suggested.

Metzler did not want the is-
sues to be so broad that views
within the group would vary
radically.

Chairman Bentzinger later
added, “I hope we restrict our
goals, and don’t try to coordl‘
nate, rather than operate.”

Consolidation of various
peace movements was mention-

inating source for

The Iowa Peace Bulletin, of
which Metzler is editor, has
been suggested. Announcements

If elected President, Hoover
said he would “do everything
within his power to: I) stop the
War in Vietnam, (2) establish
a new foreign policy to relate
to the people who want free-
dom and peace instead of con-
rupt dictators, 3) end the draft
and the military intervention in
civilian affairs that have re-
