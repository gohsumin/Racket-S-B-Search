Year in Costa Rica

By KIT LEDER

Ships approaching a horizon

once we believed these words;
now we are taught that they
are not true, and, ignoring the
diilerence between wisdom and
knowledge, not too many of us
take on on an ocean voyage to
verity that the earth is round.
Our apathy doesn't really en-
danger the body or human
knowledge, but its implications
for personal growth are great.

The point is that intellectual
exploration does not have to
uncover mental artilacts to be
rewarding. since the process or
looking iustilies itself. Applied
to education, this idea invali-

pie don’t realize that something
better is going on and is avail-
able to nearly everyone.

The Associated Colleges oi the
Midwest (a sports league?)

Costa Rica, and even Chicago.

Anyone can look into spend-

not because it is necessary

As a participant in the Cen-

centered in San Jose, Costa
Rica, i watched mysell and oth-
er students change as people,

ant on ii rig in a foreign cul-
ture, seem similar to what any
college graduate is faced with
when he leaves his ivy-encrust-
ed campus for the more various
world outside,

College is a challenge or sorts,
but life outside or school was
almost a threat — it required
constant analysis, directed both
inwardly and outwardly. Irrele<
vaiit conjecture was stripped
away. Not that it wasn't coit-
fusing — it one is trying to de<
termine the shape of the World,
the way to solve the dilemma is
not always clear, but at least
the question is. The stay-at-
homes seem still uncertain what
to ask.

for a semester, and a certain
number or LeMoyne students
spend a semester at Grinnell.
Although funds were originally
planned to be available for
eight students trom both cam-
puses to be exchanged, in the
past three years the program
has involved one to four Grin-
neil students and tour students
selected by LeMoyne's dean,
Mr. Lionel Arnold. Slnce the
merger on September 1 or the
two Memphis colleges, LeMoyne
and Owen, the Memphis institu-
tion is named LeMoyne-Owen.
- Mr, Charles Seller, who is the
Assistant to the President and
coordinator of the LeMoyne
program on campus, inherited
his job from Dean winters at
the beginning oi this month, He

has initiated an effort to bring
together Mary Gleysteen. (‘69)

Green ('70), (or the CBS board),
and as many students as pOS<
sibie who have spent a semester
in LeMoyne. He will be talking
with these students and the
CBS executive board in What
he hopes will be a “very criti-
cal fashion," about what the
program has been. He also
wants to learn more about what
the students liked and disliked
in their semester, and What the
black students would like to
see trom it, betore talking to
Dean Arnold. He says such pos<
sibilitles as an increase in the
exchange due to the merger or
the two colleges are still open.

The Newberry Library

By CAROL C. BRADFORD

The Newberry Library Sem-
inar in the Humanities is an
opportunity for scholarly and
independent study in Chicago.
The program is uttered t0 qual-
itied juniors and seniors major
ing in the Humanities ol‘ Social
Sciences. The Seminar concen-
trates on a particular century
each year. This year participat<
ing students will be studying
the 19th Century

The semester is typically di-
vided into tWO periods. The first
six weeks Consists of seminar
sessions in English and History
which the students prepare and
lead themselves. The remaining
two months are devoted to in-
dependent and comprehensive
research. Students may choose
any area or study pertaining to
the century under examination,
Their final academic responsi-
bility is the completion or a pa-
per based upon their research.
These papers are corrected and
published by the Newoerry Li-
brary every year. The program
also otters a wide variety or
guest lecturers, a series of con-
carts, and many social iunctioiie
with the taculty and staff.

An important leatui-e or the
program is the opportunity to
live and study in a city environ<
meni, The Library is located on
the North side of Chicago and
students live in apartments near
by. Students are urged to ex-
plore and take advantage oi the
city as well as the Library Sit-
uated in the “Rush St" or
“nightclub" area, they are with-
in walking distance of the Loop,
Old Town, and beaches on Lake
Michigan. Public transportation
makes it easily accessible to the

South Side where the University
or Chicago and Hyde Park are
located.

The Newberry Seminar thus
has many advantages to it. it
otters the scholarly students the
chance to research thoroughly a
topic within their iields or spe-
cial interests. it gives the silk
dents who are uncertain about
graduate school a realistic idea
about the nature oi graduate
work, And ﬁnally, it offers one
the opportunity to live and study
in a city environment in an inde-
pendent capacity.

Quaiiiied applicants are ex-
pected to have a working back--
ground in history or literature,

though they need not be major-
ing in these iields and are not
required to have special knowl-
edge in the period under ex-
amination. Participants are se-
iccted on the basis of their ac-
ademic standing, their capacity
tor independent study and re-
search, and their interest in
and potential qualiﬁcations for
graduate studies. Preference is
given to students who are also
pmiicient in one or more toreign
languages.

In the past, many students
have been deterred (rrom apply-
ing tor this program. They were
Either misinformed or incorrect-
ly assumed that they had to be
English or l-listory majors to
qualify. This is not the case.
Students from other colleges are
otten art. philosophy. music, or
language majors who write
their papers in one or these
fields.

Application forms will soon
be available from Mr. Kinmer,
who Mill icniy students t'ilra,:gn
