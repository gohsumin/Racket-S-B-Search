Shape up for Relays

Things seem to be shaping
up for the Pioneers after
a slow season start. Last Satur-
day at the Cornell Relays, by
far our toughest meet yct, Grin-
nell placed in three events and
gained a 5th and our position in
two others.

Doug Lewis placed second in
the shot put with a 42’6” heave;
Thor Evenson took a third in
the high jump with do”, his
best effort this season (65%”
won the event).

Bill Schooler, Gordv Abel,
Gary Jones and Paul Lewis
swept to second in the BSD-yd.
relay, sixth in the din-yd. re<
lay, and 5th in the sprint med-
ley.

The irosh relay team of Jon
Stein, Carl Brennen, Neil Onet-
hiem, and Chuck McGrath
grabbed second in the sprint
medley. Nell, Carl, Steve Hir-
shorne and Phil Morales took
second in the mile relay.

The Pioneers travel to Cedar
Falls tomorrow for the Art
Dickinson Relays.

The WRA no longer exists.
The Student Recreation Asso~
ciation has ofﬁcially taken its
place among the hierarchy of
campus organizations. Every
student is a member of SRA
by his very presence on cam-
pus. But the workers behind the
scenes have as their goal to
provide informal recreation and
also money and equipment tot
spontaneous events. in keeping
with this philosophy, SRA do-
nated 3710 and recreation equip—
merit to the Guerilla Theatre
for their Spring Day.

Now that it is Spring, the list
of inlormal recreation grows
longer. Did you know that any
student can participate in a
Birdie Bike Hike Wednesday
morning at 6:30? or it that
isn't to your liking, you can
go Canceing and camping May
3 and 4 or join in the inn of
a hopscotch tournament on cen»
tral campus in May. 11 your
interests nln more to the aca-
demic side, SRA organizes tac-
ulty-stutlent tennis tournaments.

By LEE SHAMBERG

If advance reports are true
(and they seem too good to
be), free life will reach a new

to the April 12 edition of the
Mountain Free Press, Boulder
Colorado’s underground paper,
a completely free rock festival
that is expected to attract
100,000 people and last for “at
least a month" Will be held
along the Eldorado River in the
mountains near Aspen this July.
Food and housing, as well as
music, will be provided free.

According to Bruce Danley
oi the MFP. the festival is be-

of Endor (Aspen), and the
Wonderland Civic Association
(Boulder), and has financial
backing from two at the largest
r e c o r at companies in the
folk/rock lield: Apple Produc<

Electra has donated $500,000
to provide solar-powered domed
huts ioi- hotlsmg, and Apple will
provide a tree macrobiotic

The staggering list of per-

The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The
Rolling Stones, Donovan, The
Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The
Grateful Dead, The Jefferson

Baez, Tim Harden, Leonard
Cohen, John Mayall, Jeremy

and the new “Super-Group":
Clapton, Winwood and Baker.
Dramatic and satirical com-
panies periorming will probably
include The Committee ThE<
ater, The Living Theater, and
Hair.

According to Danley, the
{our prime movers correspond
to the trump cards in the Tarot
Deck for the Aquarian Age;
Donovan is the minstrel, Dy-
lan the poet, Hendrix the magi-
cian, and Paul McCartney the
tool (the Wise man in the
Aquarian Age). He also noted
that on July 22, a major ear-th-
quake is expected in Cahiornia,
and the Atlantis is snpposed't’u

sies oi Edgar Cayce, among
others. According to Cayce, the
safest place in North America
Will be in the mountains near
the Continental Divide. The
word Ed Dorado is repeated
several times in the Beatles
“Revolution No 9.” (It is gen-
erally conceded that “Hey
Jude" and “Revolution" are
musical interpretations oi Judo
and Revelations in the New
Testament. Revelations chapter
nine deals with an earthquake.)
