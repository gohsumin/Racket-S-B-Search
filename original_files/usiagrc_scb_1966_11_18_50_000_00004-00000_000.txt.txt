Gates lecturer Relates Religion um! Science

By MARTHA BERKEY

The Rev. Ernan McMullin,
head of the department of phil«
osophy at the University of
Notre Dame, delivered the fifty-
Second annual Gates Lectures
Novi 13-15 in a presentation
which cut broadly across cur-
ricular lines, and seemed to ap-
peal to the Grinnell pride in the
true liberal arts tradition. Sub-
jects ranging iron-i the history
of philosophy to the genetic ba-
sis of life, from mathematics to
the United Nations, and lrom
the Dead Sea Scrolls to the big
bang theory of the origin oi the
universe, were combined with
subtle amounts of Roman Cath-
olic theology under the general
theme of “Some Historical As-
pects oi the Relation oi Science
and Religion.”

in his opening iectum, “Chris-
tianity and the Origin of Natural
Science." Father McMullin em-
phasized the historical develop
ment of the questioning thought
process. From th e ancient
Greek idea of “mind" Came the
turn to the theoretical which in-
troduced a belief in the power
of man's mindi Man. through
use of his mind, could under-
stand things about his world.

This searching attitude, an im-
portant part of the Judaeo—
Christian tradition, had an im‘
ponunt influence on the devel-
opment of the scientific method.

Concept of Man

He also explored the histori-
cal context of a related concept
of man. “The idea of man l‘urm~
ing himself has always been in
Christianity. Now it is being
emphasized by existentialism,"
This theme of the questioning,
Searching, rational mind led
Father MCMullin to his conclu-

sion. “It was no accident that
science developed in the Chris-
tian West and even today finds
only an uneasy home in the
East.”

Father McMullin's second ad»
dress focused on the clash of
the scientific and religious
world views. Men pondered the
question of where man fitted
into the natural order. Was man
a spirit and therelore divorced
from nature; or was man a part
or nature? The attempt to look
at things objectively directed
man's thinking in the 16th, 17th,
and 18th centuries. This move-
ment led man away lrom the
religious view and the authority
of the new science grew.

‘The Christian religious faith
has tended upon the notion of

a revelation. The triumph of
biological and technological
science has opened up a gull,"
explained Father McMullin,

Faith and Reason

The final lecture examined
the topic of “The Contribution
of Science to Theology: A Look
to the Future.” He showed how
science has changed our picture
of ourselves and our universe.
”Christian theology today owes
a great deal to eiioris ot SCien-
tists oi all kinds.” He presented
technology as "simply an exten-
sion of ourselves. We can de-
slroy it or ennoble it. The limi-
tations now are those in man

.— his will to use the powers he

has, and to use them for the
good."

Scientilic interests and religi-
ous beliefs are both striving to-
Ward the same relationships:
man with the universe, and man
with God “We can’t cut apart
those two domains of man’s in.
terest, raith and reason, be-
cause man is a part or God. All
the fields oi science, theology,
and philosophy come to a point
in man for they all have some-
thing to say to him,

Thul Festival of Lights .
The evening of the hill moon in November
Is set aside for the propitiation ol the guard-
ian spirits of the rivers, ponds, and water-
ways. As darkness falls and the moon comes
. up, the Thais follow the ancient Brahmanic
custom of setting afloat (loi) little river rafts
or boats (krathong) bearing lighted candles.

ings and as a gesture of conciliation to en-
sure protection during the following year for

All those who bathe in the water or travel on

it. Loy Krathong is one of the most popular

or on Thai customs, enjoyed yearly by young
and old alike,

The candle on the pink paper float flickered as
if to go out A small brown hand shielded it from
the wind, and as the flame began to glow,
placed the host on ﬁle dark sluggish water. With
a joyful abandon, the ﬂame burned brighter and
brighter, ready to consume itself and the float.
The incense curled upwards in tight ringleLs,
then, stirred by the breeze, dissipated in the
moonlight like wisps of angel hair. The light will
captured and reﬂected in the small copper coin
which had been placed on the float as an offer-
ing to the spirits. Next to it, paper flowers of
dainty pastel pink, creamy white, and pale yellow
lay sprinkled with crunchy popcorn and pearl-
like grains of rice. Laden with these offering!
and the burden of a small boys' sins, the float
slowly began to move — first to the left, then to
the right, past the reeds and grasses trying to
ensnare it, then past the gnarled root, dark and
rimster in the moonlight, until finally, tree trom
restraints, it began to spin, this way and that,
faster and faster, iurther and further from the
shore, until tinally, it became lost among the
thousands of other lights — a new star in the
watery Milky Way.

Suchat, still standing knee-deep in water, his
young legs firmly braced against the current,

strained his eyes to keep the tiny pinpoint of
light in View Then, with a frown, he gave up.
He scampered up the muddy bank, darted through
h group or giggling school-girls, and nearly
knocked me down in his enthusiasm to join his
brother and sisters in the further pursuit oi
sanuk or fun.

My float had been launched successfully an
hour ago, with all due and proper ceremony, and
i had watched it disappear under the gaping
iron jaw of the Old Bridge. 1, too, was willing
to pursue sanuk a little furthers (And, in Thai—
land, sanulr and eating are almost synonymous.)
As the fragrance of spicy Thai food waited
through the air, Jungiut, the science teacher, his
triend, and I made our way across the crowded
street to the campus of the Dara branch school.

The grounds of the school, normally crowded
With children at recess or quiet and dusty on
weekends, had been transliormed through the
wild fantasy of color, sounds, and smells into a
