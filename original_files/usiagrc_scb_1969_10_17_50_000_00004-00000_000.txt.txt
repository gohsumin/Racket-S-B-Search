Free University:
Students, Profs
Do their Things

,» By Alice Rogoii

What do a bicycle-repair
course, a Marxism study group,
And a poetry workshop have in
common? Each one is is cur-
rent offering in the Grinnell
"curriculum" 1. ii a t Students
won’t find listed in their cata-
logues. Instead, they are part
of a new Grinnell phenomenon
known as the Free University.

The Free University is actu-
ally an otishuot of a committee
organized to discuss education.
Freshman Chris Freeberg and
some of his friends concluded
that many or Grinnell’s excit-
ing contributions to a “class—
less society“ (ire, outside of
class) were going unheralded
ﬁnd unheeded. They also felt
that interested students should
be encouraged to get together
and to share their time and
talents with one another.

If anyone has a suggestion
tor a new nonprolit study group
that they would like to lead or
to participate in, the Free Uni-
versity staii will act as a CD-
ol'dinating committee to organ-
ize and ‘publicize the activity.
The Free University, there-
fore, serves as an information
center that unites and initiates
Such activities.

Groups already in operation

as evidenced by the $7.0 cake

Enthusiasm ran high at the
auction, attended by about zoo
students. although prices didn't.
Miss Eriesdn commented that
students were unwilling to
spend their money, and acted
cynical about some items. Al-
though the net sales, $1181.50.
were lower than last year, Miss
Ericson added that there were
more items last year, so this
year's sales were proportion-
ately better.

Broadwell thought the auction
"came of! quite Well." Miss
Ericson said, “For whatever
reason people spent their money.
