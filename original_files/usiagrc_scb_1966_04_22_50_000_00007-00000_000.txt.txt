) Drug Use

they tried cigarettes in grade school
and liquor in high schools

One of the apparent frustrations in
dealing with this experimentation on
campus is that it doesn't appear to have
a center. The students get their marl-
juana from a wide variety of sources
making it impossible to “dry up” any
one source and thus solve the problem.
Most find their source in large cities
where it is readily available.

) Drug Statement

(Continued from Page 1)

the college “encourages its students to
inform themselves about drugs and the
problems their use represents from
sources as authoritative as possible, rea-
lizing that some study is necessary in
order to separate lact from the mass oi
speculation about use, enforcement. el-
feels, and the future of the prob-
lems . r ."

The report goes on to say that Grin»
nell “encourages its students to refrain
from unpl'escrlbed or illegal use of any
narcotic, stimulant, or hallucinogen. and
to avoid contributing to any illusion or

drama, excitement, and/or myth about
drugs . . ."

The college also “intends to regard
any student lound to be contributing to
the problems by usrng drugs illegally or
by contributing to others’ use oi drugs
as having engaged in unacceptable con-
duct and subject to dismissal (depend
ing on the circumstances of the student's
involvement, however, the college may,
at its option, deal with the matter through
counseling and other resources) . . ."

In a letter that goes with a copy of the
statement to parents, President Leggett
says that “our evaluation of the situa-
tion at Grinnell offers no cause for a-
larm.”

Leggett goes on to say that "we have
no evidence of widespread use of drugs
by our students," and that the College
will attempt to stop whatever use of
drugs there may be by trying “to per-
suade students of the dangers to them-
selves and to others when they play a-
round with drugs" instead of by “polic-
mg,”

“Ideas arise from conflict —- and it
is precisely the vitality oi confllct that
needs to be reemphasized at Grinnelli"

Bucks also attacked “the cult of con-
fldentialism" which tends to keep ideas
bottled up in the centers of decision
making.

“The system of Confidentialism should
he brought to an early demise, and
ideas allowed to flow freely among all
campus groups"

He said that be was optimistic be
cause the administration was Susceptihle
to new ideas and there appeared to be
a new emphasis on innovation Withlll
the faculty. “Bill nonetheless, the dom-
inant influence continues to he the hu-
reaucratic perspective”

Bucks said that he was disregarding
some VOlCes which had urged him nor
to amuse too much excitement or me-
tiVation. “Failure to articulate new
ideas would he a severe failure in lead—
ership on my part."

Bucks said that he Wanted to extend
the vision of Grinnell students beyond
the lowa campus and asked, "Where
was Grinnell when Oherlin and Antioch
were building colleges in Mississippi?"

Bucks queried, what about tours of
Grimlell students with children from de
prived minorities? or what about a
"front - door attack on the politics of
the Soul " by initiating a dialogue with
Southern white college students — the
people who Will be members or the
Southern Establishment in the future?

What about reallocating the resources
oi the athletic program to place less
emphasis on intercollegiate contests and
more emphasrs on intro—murals?
