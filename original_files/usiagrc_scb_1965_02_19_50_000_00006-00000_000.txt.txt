Civil Rights Group
Joins with SNCC

Grinnell's yearrold civil rights
group voted unanimously to
place its affiliation with the
Student Non-violent Coordinal»
ing Committee (SNCC) Tues-
day in a meeting in ARI-I audi~
torium. At the same time, the
controversy of whether to join
the NAACP was decided in the
negative.

SNGC (pronounced ”snick”)
is an organization almost whol-
ly oi students who are on va-
cations or taking semesters off
to work for direct mass action
in the South. Since “direct ac-
tion in lowa is impossible—
there is nothing to act upon,"
Jeff Burnham, president of
Grinnell’s group, said that stu-
dents here can help the civil
rights cause by contributions of
lime and labors

The NAACP. on the other
hand, bases its effectiveness on
legal action and recently has
Withdrawn from the Council of
Federated 0 r g a n I z a t ions
(core), which embraces alr
most every civil rights group in
the South. Dues in the NAACP
also require one-half of the
group’s membership fees, while
inc obligation is attached with
Ian alriliation with chc.

The coffee hour with James
Lawson, SNCC adViSor, at 3:00
p,m. on Friday, Feb. 26, was
moved from the Religious Ac-
tivities Room to the South
Lounge.

 

 

t Stealing Problem in Quad

(Continued from Page I)

cular problem on north camp-
us.
Read, saying that they “very
rarely have problems," added
that there is not as much inter-
change between the halls on
north campus, and thus 5
stranger is noticed more quick»
1y then on south campus. He:
also said that when something
happens, the men can always
lock their doors.

with regard to the stealing‘v
problem, several of the worm-
en’s house presidents said the
women students "reluctantly
believe that. it’s going on." One
house president said that the
girls in her hall ”don't feel
touched by it." ”People are
still trusting in our hail,” said
another president.

While this attitude seems
prevalent in the quad. one
president said that “people are
being more careful,” and an.
other noted a ”more realistic
attitude.”

Miss Slocum said that “any
stealing is a major problem,
but agreed that there is an in-
creased awareness of the prob-
lem now. She emphasized that
“one of the greatest problems
in dealing with reported theft
is that people don’t report it
soon enough." Women should
report to their house presi-
dent, head resident, and to the
quadrangle office as soon as a
theft is discovered.

 

Miss Slocum said that the
problem is once again being
studied, and added that she will
welcome suggestions.

A check of AWS Board min—
utes showed that stealing has
been a concern for the board
at seven at its regular meetings
this school year. A similar
check of last years' minutes
showed only one mention oi
stealing.
