Last Sunday, after the chil<
dren's performance of “The
Little Prince,” the Starlet and
Black conducted a symposium
on the play in the South
Lounge oi the Fonim, Respond-
ing to questions asked by an
impartial group oi reporters,
eleven children ranging in
age from four to seven gave
their candid opinions on the
play, and some other related,
and not so related matters.

The questions are printed
here with the answers, without
many additions or subtractions.

Q. Would you recommend the
play to your friends?

A. Yes.

Q. (Guess that wasn’t such a
provocative question.) What did
you think of the airplane crash
in the beginning?

A. i thought he was a reck-
less driver.

Yeah, he shoulda been more
careiul. He could have dented
a wall or something. like when
Moni humped into the garage.

Q. If you were the flower,
would you have iallen in love
with the little prince?

A. I thought he was too silly.

Q. What did you think or the
ﬂower?

A. She was too vain.

Q. Did you think she treated
the prince mean?

A. (Nodding to one another)
No. no.

Q. What did you think rep-
resented the dramatic moment
of the play?

A. (Silence)

Q. Uni. what scene did you
like best?

A. I liked the reckless driver
on the trike.

Q. Would you have bought
those iancy pills he was sell-
ing. Remember, with one at
those pills, you could go with-
out water for a week?

A. No. You would need water
to swallow the pill.

i don’t think it would get
stuck in your throat.

I liked the drunk man.

Q. Do you think the drunk

man looked like any other in
the play?

A. He looked like the adding
man. The snake and the fox
looked alike.

No they didn't.

Q. Did you think the drunk
man was really drunk?

A. No, Dick Van Dyke does
the same thing. But this guy
was much better than that.

The Whole thing reminds me
or Rowan and Martin.

Q. Do you think anything was
left out oi the play?

A. it shoulda had a watergun
light.

And it should of had a mud-
ball light.

Q. What would you have done
with the mudballs?

A. Throw them at the adding
man.

Q. Did the prince remind you
of anyone?

A. He reminded me of my
gym teacher. The hair was the
same.

The flower reminded me of
my cousin.

(At this point. stirred by our
probing reporters’ questions,
the children began to talk with-
out questions being asked. Der
spire the fury of the debate, our
stenographeis were able to re-
cord Lhe following remarks.)

I’m hungry, all i had tor
lunch was a toasrcm pop-up.

I thought the tort was the
prettiest. I thought you don’t
like girls. i hate girls. She was
an animal, not a girl, so it
doesn’t count. (Finally our
harried reporters were able to
return to their questioning.)

Q. Did you like the play?

A. It was the best play I ever
saw. it was the only play you
ever saw. It was the goodest
play i say.

Q. why do you think the king
didn't order [he sun to set when
the prince asked him?

A. Because it wasn't time.
No, I think he just wanted the
prince to stay longer.

Q. i didn‘t understand the
snake. Why do you think he
was there?

A. I don’t know,

Q. Do you think the prince
learned anything in his travels?

A, He learned that the flower
was special, because he cared
for it.

To the Editor:

it has come to my attention
that there is something rotten
in the kitchens oi Saga besides

the iood.

Recently, Karl Southworth,
Head Walter of the Cowles Saga
crew, announced his decision to
resign, eiiective as of Spring
break. 1969. His replacement:
sophomore Bob Noyce.

The position oi head waiter is
the most important a student
worker can hold. It entails the
responsibilities oi scheduling
the hours of each worker to
iii in with his classes and acrir
vities, eniorcing dress rules,
cooiiiciating at special meals
such as Thanksgiving or Val-
entine’s dinners and Convoca»
tion. instituting changes ior bet-
tcr efficiency (including the
power to fire those who CorlSlSr
tently reiuse to cooperate), and
acting as a general lubricant to

obviously, then, this job is a
difficult one requiring an inti-
mate knowledge of the "Saga
System."

The holder of the Head Wall-
er’s position earns a iixed salary
oi $700 per year, as compared to
the 5250 work grant awarded
the regular workers. it is this
salary more than any other sin
gle factor which makes the
job so eminently desirable.

if the purpose of Saga work
grants is to supplement other
terms of iinancial aid to needy
students, I would question the
selection of Bob Noyce, or any
other Saga worker who does not
have an employment grant, as
Head Waiter replacement.

It is one thing to hire workers

least three have had considera-
bly more experience with workn
ing “behind the scenes" oi Saga,
on account of both the variety
and the sheer quantity or the
work loads they have untlertak.
en. The only reason i can see
that these three were over-
looked is because of the “inde~
spensible" nature of the ser-
vices they are now perlorming,
In which case they should be
paid more (or this specialized

_ labor.

At any rate. the criterion oi
need, and to a large extent the
qualification of experience were
ignored by Saga Chuck and Karl
Southworth in their collabora-
tion to choose a Head Waiter.
I request that they reconsider
their decision in the light 01
these two factors, and also that
the Senate committee investi-
gating Saga look into this mat-
ter.

Leiler Bids Students

Be Strong in Courage

To the Editor:

1 wish to speak to all those
students who may ieel disap-
pointed, unrepresented. or
possibly lust angry about the
events of the past iew weeks
on this campus. Grinnell Col-
legs is not one of the more
liberal places on earth. It you
are opposed to the recent so-
cial changes, do not think or
yourselt as reactionary simply
because you are so inioimed.
If you still have a sneaking
suspicion that morality is im-
portant don't let some nincom-
poop talk you out oi it; all
significant human activity in~
Volves moral decisions. It
others have told you that per-
sonal behavior is of no con-
cern to the community. l'e-
member that the community
is merely a peculiar collec-
tion oi persons.

You may have already dis-
covered the fact that Grinneil
is a very unusual place.
There are very iew radicals
here! Most people seem to be‘
lieve what they believe be~
cause others believe it. They
could not believe it by themv
selves. Unfortunately, people
who may share your behets
seldom have the desire to ex-
press themselves. it is harder
to speak with reason than with
passion, and the applause is
noticeably less.

Finally, it you don't
what’s happening say
thing. It is your right
responsibility. But say what»
ever you must say without
hostility, disrespect. and mal-
ice. Do not make yoni-selt vul—
nemble to Character assassi-
nation. Arguments nil honii-
nem abound on this campus.
Say what you believe because
you really believe It. not be-
cause your peers say that they
believe it. You may iind your-
self with more company man
you had imagined. No society
has to be controlled by [Ilosa
who yell the loudest and say
the least.
