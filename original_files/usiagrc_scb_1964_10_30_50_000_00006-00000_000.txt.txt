Beloii Wins Game;
leam's Hope Gone

, By Pete ,Kollnian

A Fired-up crew of Beloit Burk
cancers dispelled the Pioneers
hopes of a Midwest Conference
Championshipbydefeat—
ing Griiinell, 2444 at Beloit last
Saturday. The Buccaneers don-i-
inated the game from the start,
piling up a 17-0 half-time lead
and coasting to their 4th victory
in 5 starts. The Pioneers are
now 372.

The game started well for
Grinnell, the Pioneers intercept-
ing a stray Buccaneer aerial
and movmg to the Beloit in.
But at this point, the attack
stalled and Beloit moved the
length of the field to go ahead,
adding a field goal later in the
first quarter to lead 9-0.

After the half, Dave Synhotst,
Grinnell halfback, put the Pio-
neers briefly back into conten-
tion with a touchdown punt re-
turn covering 46 yards; but Bel-
oiL tallied again to put the
game on ice. The final Pioneer
score came on an ll yard Bar-
ry Anderson to Elston Bowers
pass late in the final period.

The ferocious ground defense
of Beloit, which had plagued
many a midwest conference op-
ponent, was instrumental in the
Victory. The Pioneers could
only net 15 yards on the ground,
and 34 via the air; and 5 first
downs, Beloit gained 132 yards
both on the ground alld‘t‘hrcugh
the air and managed ll flrsl
downs.

Pioneer Soccer Team
Defeats Carleton, 6-2

Vince Anku s record tying per—
formance led the Grinnell soc-
cei team to a 6-2 victory over
Carleton last Friday Anku
scored all six Grinnell goals to
tie his own record that he set
against Northern Illinois The
game was marred by seven
penalty kicks that produced five
goals. Anku converted on three
of five Grinnell penalty kicks
and Carleton scored its only
two goals on two penalty kicks.

The action started fast after
a twenty minute delay of the
game waiting for the referees.
.Vince Anku scored the first
goal on a penalty kick with less
than a minute gone in the game.
And before the quarter was half
over there were three more
goals scored on penalty kicks,
two by Anku and one by Carle-
ton. Late in the quarter Anku
took a beautiful pass from Ted
Cole and scored his fourth goal.

Anku scored on one of the
prettiest plays of the year in
the second quarter. Ted Cole
took a pass and deflected it
With his head to Anku who
raced past the Carleton defend-
ers for his fifth goal. Later
Vince was tripped by a Carle-
ton defender and was awarded
a penalty kick, but he missed
it.

The second half became a
tough defensive battle with very
few scoring opportunities. An—
ku misseda apenal ty kick and
Carleton made one in the third
quarter. Anku scoied his rec-
ord- t-ying sixth goal in the
fourth quarter with a shot into
the cornei of the net

Two years ago in their football preview, Sports
Illustrated referred to the Midwest Conference as frat-
racidal, inferring, among other things, that only an ig-
noramus would attempt any predictions on the games
or the run for the championship. The race has now
begun‘ to take shape, however, and realizing still the
dangers of prognostica’tion I would like to discuss the
final three weeks of the football season.

With the season heading into the home stretch,
there are still six teams with a mathematical chance
for the title and four with a good shot at it. Ripon,
Cornell, Coe, Beloit, St. Olaf and Grinnell are the teams
mathematically contending, and the first four schools
are very much in the thick of it with Ripon still un-
beaten and the other three once-beaten.

This weekend should be a decisive one, as the
front-running six meet each other in three games which
will either completely muddle the race or eliminate
some of the contenders. The three games involve St.
Olaf at Ripon, Beloit at Cornell and Coe at Grinnell.
This Writer sees the Coe-Grinnell game as a toss-up,
and Cornell and Ripon as winners, Although Coe has
a more impressive record, the Pioneers still remember
that 52-0 debacle at Cedar Rapids last year, and Grin-
nell has the home field advantage. If Coe can get by
Grinnell, they finish with Lawrence and Monmouth at
home bdth of which they should win handily If Ripon
and Calnell both win tomoriow as I have piedicted,
however, all eyes will be on Ripon next weekend when
the two teams will clash in what would probably de-
cide the title.

What all these ifs boil down to is that Ripon is
still undefeated and therefore in the driver s seat>lf any
one of the three once- -beaten teams is going to win the
championship they will have to win all of theii remain-
ing games and hope for a Ripon loss, This writer sees
little chance of Ripon losing a game, with their last
game (Beloit~away) being the only possible excep-

Team in Final Dual Meet Tomorrow

Clyde Smith, Steve Brintnall,

Beckord and Smith both
turned in their top perform-
ances of the year in the Wabash
engagement, coming in second
and sixth, respectively. Brint—
nail Was eighth and Bushnell

Coach Dick Young also plans
to run his Pioneei freshmen
in exhibition Saturday. Probe
able frosh runners are John
Sharpe, Galen Bollinger, Bob
Grant, Doug Dray, Jon Bil-
strom, Darrell Dunham, and
Rich LaFontaine.

Again fielding a full five-man
unit, Grinnell College's cross
country team will close Its dual
meet season by hosting Coe on
Saturday.

The return to action of Capt.
Paul Patterson after a five-
week layoff has upped the Pio-
neer numbers to five for the
first time since early October.

The meat, which will precede
the Grinnell-Coe football battle,
will begin at 1:25 pm, at Ward
Field.

Rounding out the Pioneer
lineup will be Bruce Beckord,

 

tion. Thus, it looks like the Redmen from Wisconsin
will lead the pack for the second year in a row.

As long as I have stuck my neck out, I can’t resist
including the following prediction:

Ohio State 34 Iowa 14

To those avid Iowa fans who scoff at this, my season's
prediction record presently stands at 93 right 0 wrong
and 1 tie.

 

Snow is predicted for Iowa

Witli winter coming you need anti-freeze to keep your
car running smoothly.
