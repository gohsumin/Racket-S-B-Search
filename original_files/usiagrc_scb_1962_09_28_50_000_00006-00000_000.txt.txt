war times when the YMCA
served the armed services ex-
clusivcly.

This YMCA exclusion rule
ended at Plitsch's recommenda—
tion, and for a twe-dollar-a—
month fee the Y was run on an
integrated basis.

Even this tee, however, was
a hindrance to the success of
Pfitsch’s program, as many
could not afford the fee. .

But for Piitsch there were
other rewarding efforts. He cites
his work with handicapped and
retarded children, and the fact
that the National YMCA board
did hire a full—time program
director as of September 1.
