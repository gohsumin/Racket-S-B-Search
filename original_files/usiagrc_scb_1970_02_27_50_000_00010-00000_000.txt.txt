dividuai humanity. In Germany
there was the danger of an intel»
lectual re-awakening, the reali»
zation at home that people are
killed, tortured, and destroyed
even by the most glorious of
wars.

Two themes were common in
successful German films. One
involves a rebellion and then a
submission to authority. A good
example of this type of film is
“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”.
The German press thought that
it was a great film at the time
or its release; they did not con-
sider it opposed to freedom. The
other predominant theme is anti-
intellectualism. The film “Blue
Angel” is a good example.

Professor Klein went on to
outline Kracauer’s philosophy of
film, which appears as if it could
be partly a result of distrust of
the German films. He opposes
formal editing. Rather, the film
should try to capture the “un-
staged reality”, the unplanned.
This principle, says Klein, writes
out many kinds of film making,
and he termed it “rather one-
sided”. Scenes should not be
staged with actors, and there
should be a sense of endlessness
to the plot of the film. Kracauer
is apparently opposed to struc—
tured themes that run their
course within the film. The film
should stress that life is indeters
mimate, that the film~maker
cannot control everything. In
short, Kracauer prefers a motific
treatment of subjects involving
life itself.

Carl Kracauer’s method of
examining film be applied to the
American cinema to give us cues
to the psychology of America?
Klein said yes, with reservations.
In America there are many other
mass media, and many different
kinds of financially successful
films. These factors made Klein
hesitant to draw conclusions, but
he did point out certain themes
that dominate television and
movies. Family life, for one, is
a common theme. The concept
of authority which sees that both
the criminal and the policeman

use Similar tactics is another.
Finally, there is a group of
escapist films (like “The
Graduate”) which use many
visual effects and contain little
social content. Klein then broke
off his formal remarks and
opened up the floor for questions.
The last event of Wednesday
evening explains the bi-line at the
top of this article. I can’t
guarantee - that the
tollowing sketch is very ob
jective, and I don’t wish to ruin
the element of surprise First of
all there were ﬂying marsh-
mallows, an electric violin, and
a faculty member, Mr. Harris,
dressed like the tin man from
the ”Wizard of OZ" and reading
nonsensical German poetry 7 in
German, The amusing thing was
that for a moment those present
listened with the sober respect
one might pay to a serious
reading of a passage from the
Iliad as the tin man waved his
stiff arms meaningfully and
uttered nonsense in a foreign
language. I refer, of course, to
the “Recreation of the Original
Happening: The Dadaists in
Zurich, 1916.” If you like marsh»
mallows, it is a must see.
