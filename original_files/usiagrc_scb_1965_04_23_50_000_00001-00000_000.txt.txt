students who participated in
last Saturday's march on
Washington to protest U. s.
involvement in the Viet Nam
war.

Eight Grinnell students were
among those who went on the
march to end the war in Viet

Nam in Washington, D. C., last
Saturday

There is great diversity of
opinion as to how many people
participated in the march. News
commentators on the scene es-
timated the number at 35,000,
the Washington Post at 20,000,
while AP reports said 12,000 to
15,000, Whatever is correct,

Off-Campus Living for Meni
Conference House to Be Open

“Otircampus housing will be
available next year to is men stu-
dents in 1205 Park Street (Confer-
ence House) and to a number of
men who may obtain approved
rental housing in town.” This
statement was made by Dean of
Men 5. Eugene Thompson Wed~
nesday.

North campus room drawings
have been postponed until May 3
to provide an opportunity for
gathering more "exact information
on total enrollment. Final enroll-
ment iigures will determine how
many students will be able to
rent rooms in town,

All men will draw for rooms on
north campus, but those interested
in offrcampus housing should fill
out an application (available at
the ofﬁce of the dean of men)
Applications should be returned to
the dean of men by noon on Tues-
day, April 27.

Thompson noted that the total

 

number of men living outside the

permanent residence halls will not
actually be increased. However,
since there will be fewer married
students and students whose homeo
are in town, the number of men air
lowed to obtain rooms in town may
increase. ,

tion.

year was French house, will be
used as a residence by upperclass

ter house to Cleveland halli

Folk Group Will Dance Sunday

afternoons in the Women's Gymi

By Krys Neuman

The Grinnell folk dancing so-
ciety will present its spring pro-
gram Sunday at 8 pm. in Roberts
Theatre.

The group has learned dances
of seventeen nations. Representa-
tive costumes have been designed
and sewn by some or the girls in

 

the group, although an original
German costume is being worn in
the dance Schuhplatter and the
girls in Pas d'Espagne will dance
in authentic Finnish wear.

The talk dancers were organized
in the fall of 1963 and have now
expanded to about forty members
who have been practicing Sunday

 

One special attraction of the
group is the fact that dancing can
be used for gym credit.

Mrs, William Roecker, who be-
fore coming to Grinnell was ac-
tive in an Oregon folk dancing
group, has been instrumental in
teaching and organizing the Grin-
nell dancersi This year she has
worked with president Jean Wat-
son, secretary Eva Gardebring and
treasurer Jan Thomas. She said
that beginners should always feel
welcome as new dances are ale
ways being taught.

Although last year the group
danced casually for a limited audi—
ence on the ralnrsoaked Spring
Day, this year the program prom-
ises to be much more spectacular.
The group promises a Special sur-
prise toward the end of the pro-
gram And even though the group
does not claim to be another Royal
Ballet, it does guarantee a per-
formance both colorful and gay.

Faculty Says No JLA Next Year.
But Final Decision Still Uncertain

The Junior Liberal Arts ex-
amination will not be admin
istered to next year’s juniors,
although the idea of the exam
has not been abandoned en—

tirely, Acting President James
Stauss announced Wednesday.

The faculty voted to discon-
tinue the exam at a faculty
meeting Monday.

The faculty statement noted
that ”the final disposition of the
examination will be considered
at some time in the future in
conjunction with a broad, com<
prehensive evaluation of the en-
tire curriculum."

Present juniors who deferred
taking the JLA until September
1965 must fulfill the require-
ment.

 

Christiansen Debunks Race Concept 1
As lndefinable, Scientifically Useless

“If there’s such a thing as racial
superiority, we’d better be quiet
about it and hope nobody ﬁnds
out.” With that statement Kenneth
Christiansen (biology) closed his
informal remarks at Tuesday
night's dinnerrdiscussion about bio-
logical iallacies behind discrimina-
tion.

The talk was followed by discus
sion with Ronald Kurtz (anthro-
pologY) and was part of a series
on "Understanding the Race Prob-
lem," sponsored by the Board of
Religion,

Christiansen’s final remark lol-
Iowed a listing of possible char-
acteristics upon which a theory of
racial superiority might be based.
On each characteristic presented
(resistance to disease, tolerance to
temperature extremes, etc), in-
vestigation has suggested that ei—
ther the Mongoloid or Negroid ra-
cial groups are better “iit” than
Caucasoid.

 

Christiansen explained briefly

 

the nature of the populations which
are generally considered “racial
groups," though he also explained
that he considers the concept of
"race" as too indefinable to be sci-
entifically useful, He and Kurt:
agreed that the threerace con-
cept is particularly unhelpful.

Racial or ”subspecies” groups
are smaller divisions of a species
(a grouping whose members no-
turally interbreed with one anoth-
at)

Racial characteristics are large-
ly the result of adaptation to dit-
fering environments and are so di-
verse that it is impossible to cats-
gorize members into distinct
