. To Play Lawrence

Authors of two straight shut~
out victories, Coach Edd Bow-
ers’ Pioneer football team will
be shooting for number three
against Lawrence before 3

crowd here tomorrow at 2 pm.
on Ward Field.

Since dropping their opener
to Ripon, the league co-leader
and defending champion, the
Pioneers have whitewashed
Knox iii-0 and Monmouth 42-0.
The 42 points the Scarlet and
Black notched against the

Scots last weekend are the most

f o r g e d by Grinnell during

Bowers, five years as coach.
Bowers plans to stick with the

plotoohmg game that he started

against Knox and has been so
successful the past two weeks.
The probable starting offen-
sive lineup has Dave Gauger
and Dewitt or Al Peterson at
end; Rein Sal‘al and Eric Mil-
ler at tackle; Jeff Lewis and
Rick Anderson at guard: Mor-
gan Michel at center; Ander-
son at quarterback; Bowers
and Shierholz at halfback; and
Ringo at fullback. Watt is again
tagged for heavy duty at half-
back and Denny Hanssen will
back up Anderson at quarter-
back.

>On defense, Bowers will go
With Dewitt, Tom Hill and Chip
Kinsey at the two end spots;
Skip Weyrauch and Denny Ho-
merin at tackles; Pete Staben
or Mike Miller at middle guard;
Tom Lannom and Paul Thurs-
ton as linebackers; and Dave
Synhorst, Chip Clarke, Watt.
and Hanssen in the backfield.

"MARTY CHURCH, Prop.”

The final score was Clark 76, West 6, When these
results were announced, reactions spread around the
campus with amazing rapidity. Many comments echoed
the theme that Clark Hall was point-hungry, sadistic
and had lost sight of the purpose of intramural football.
It is interesting that most of the remarks came from
people who hadn‘t even seen, let alone played in, the
game. Other accusations hurled at the Clark team were
largely froln the West team itself. These were, in ef-

fect, that Clark has some guys who play too rough. The-
1crux of the whole series of anathemas being cast upon

the Clark team, and the hall itself is that they areﬁ‘too
childish” and that they want to “win at all cost.”

As a participant in the debacle, I would like first
of all to give an explanation of some of the factors
which contributed to the score. First the Clark team
was hot — everything we did turned out right at first
We received all the breaks and built up a demoralizing
lead early in the game. Then came a series of incidents
which precipitated our extra effort during the rest of
the game. First, West disputed a referee‘s decision and
announced that they were protesting the game. (score
at the time: 25-0). Still angry and frustratedhthey re-
peatedly “flared-up” in anger over referee’s decisions,
hard blocks, and anything else they could think of.
When they did score, it was set up by a trick play
exactly similar to one for which Navy coach Wayne
Hardin was publicly reprimanded last year, because it
was termed unsportsmanlike. With this added incen-
tive, Clark “childishly” played as hard as possible un-
til halftime.

From this point on, I think the final result Was as
much West’s doing as Clark’s. Not content with losing
the ball on downs in the second half, West began re-
turning kickoffs by deliberately kicking the ball back
to us without even running one scrimmage play. Ques-
tion: It is more childish to give up or to continue play-
ing your best?

With Clark’s bench long since cleared early in
the last quarter, a,West senior at least three inches tall-
er and ten pounds heavier than his Clark opponent
(who was a substitute freshman) drew back to punch
him after a whistle, When another Clark man re-
strained him by holding him, he was threatened by
more West players.

Clark could have settled things through fisticuffs,
deliberate injuring, whining, or griping. We chose the
”childish” way, though —— scoring touchdowns;

As for the accusation that although completely

Soccer Team to Meet Shimer

Without Anku:

After two weekends and three
matches on the road, the soc-
cer team returns to face Shi-
mer in its Homecoming - Pare
ents’ Day tilt tomorrow. The

contest is scheduled for noon
on the Pioneer soccer field
north of Norris Hall,

Since capturing their opener
8-2 from Northern Illinois here
on Sept, 26, Coach Irv Simone’s
Pioneer outfit has won two of
three matches on the road. The
Scarlet and Black topped the
Lawrence and Ripon soccer
clubs 4e] and 7-], respectively,
but fell at MacMurray 472 last
Saturday.

be Felix Lungu and Ed Jones.
There will be no changes

clean, our football was too rough. anyone who has

played competitive football would agree that the best
way to incur an injury is to relax and “let up” in con-

tact.

Obviously, the entire blame for the atrocious score
cannot be fixed on either the winner or the loser. The
desire to “run it up” was there, I admit. However, it is
every bit as hard to lose a game 76-6 in this league as

it is to win one.
