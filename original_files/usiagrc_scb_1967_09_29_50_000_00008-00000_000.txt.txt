GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Fall is now fading from Grinnell but since it is difficult to con-
dense 55 football games in the two weeks nature allows us for
lutumn, l. M. sports continue in the cold, drab days which precede
true winter.

Last week was the first in which the form chart took a beat.
ingr East beat South, West beat East (in the annual Goldfish
Bowl), Rawson beat West and South beat Smith. All of this
proves nothing, of course, except that if one follows this logically,

. M. football turns out to be nothing more than a syllngistic flaw
In the minds of North Campus athletes.

An I, M. board meeting was held this week and it was decided
to keep flag football, raise the penalty for failing to referee as-
signed games to 20 points, eliminate any sort of cleats in the
football games and think about illstituting I. M. Wrestling.

None of this is likely to make the New York "limes but it’s the
best I can do in a rather mundane week of sports (besides, it's
hard to make things exciting when you don't get to have an artist
draw for you or you‘re forced to remain within the bounds of
decency).

In order to take advantage of the fall weather, the South
Campus (to think that next year that term will be meaningless,
sigh) l. M. program is deeply embroiled in avid softball wars.
Assuming the sun comes out again, i will attend one of the
affairs and bring back a stirringly descriptive report (i wonder if
it’s anything like the sweatshirt relay?).

SCARLET AND BLACK

HiOSH FEW
BUT FIERCE

By JEFF SCHECK‘I‘ER

As the varsity Pioneers are
fighting for Victories. the fresh-
men football team is getting
ready for their first game. in
a recent interview. Coach John
Pfitsch said that he had a
strong and highly enthusiastic
squad.

Several s e r i o u 5 problems,
however, darken the outlook
for a successful season. Coach
Pfitsch acknowledged that a
lack of depth will prove to be
a major problem. With only
twenty players on the squad,
many team members will be
forced to play offense and de-
fense. Another serious problem
is the inexperience of the back-
field, Only quarterback Gal-y
Johnson, who played for Grin-
nell High School. has adequate
game experience.

Coach Piitsch continues to
hold high hopes for the team.
The line is particularly well
fortified and is anchored by two
220 pound tackles. Another pos-
itive factor for the team is the
running of iuilbacir Roy Lewis,

The freshmen play against
Cornell, Knox and cos. Their
first game will be on October
12 at Cornell.

 

VARSITY
SPORTS

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Last Saturday was the occas«
ion of a double defeat for the
Pioneers and one can be added
since. The football team lost to
st. Olaf 28-20 and the cross
pountry team lost to the Oles
2629 last Saturday. This Tues-
pay the barriers lost to the on-
versity of Northern lowa, 17-
12.

The first seventeen minutes
of the sixty minute gridiron
battle were decisive for the top
ranked oles, During this period
,they ran the score to 2m. Plo-
neer quarterback Kent Thom-
son had two passes intercepted
to start the first and third scor-
ing drives.

The Pioneers finally started
rolling in the second half and
ran the score to within eight
points. With 2:27 left in the
game they recovered an on-
side kick. But the faint hope of
a tie was shattered three plays

tater when Mueller or St, Olaf
picked off a Tom Lower pass.
The game was filled with er<
Tors. St. Olaf lost the ball by
fumbling six times and had
one pass intercepted. Grinnell
had a sure fingered backfield
and didn't lose the ball once by
tumbling. But they made up for
this by having six passes in-
tercepted. This is two less than
the total for all of last year!
It is interesting to note that
twice Grinnell recovered Ole
fumbles only to have a pass in
tercepted in the next play.
After doing an enormous e-
mount of research I have com-
piled the following passing staa
tistics: The Pioneers attempted
22 passes; six were intercepted,
nine were completed, and seven
ate grass. This means a whop-
ping 68 percent of the passes
Were caught. (Unfortunately

Pioneer split end Mike Schwerh streaks toward six
points of Grinnell gain with a completed pass.

 

the gridder frequently had the
wrong color jersey.)

The total gain from the nine
completions was 51 yards. But
of the nine, three were for
scores. One was for a two point
conversion and the other two
were touchdown passes. That's
a profitable 52 yardsl

Less can be said about a
crossscountry meet. Naturally
coach Ray obermiller was dis-
appointed about the two losses
and feels they were due to a
lack oi conditioning and failure
of the squad to run in a pack.
He is planning to quickly rem-
edy those defects.

ished against St. Olaf:

3. Bob Asbille
7. Bob Grant
8. Spencer Clark

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN RAZ

An important omission in last week’s table of zesponses is that
when responder holds second round control in the asked suit and
an Ace outside, he bids the Ace.

In responding to the first asking bid, responder often will have
a void or voids which were not covered by the table. For these ln<
stances, there are three rules to govern responder's bid: 1. When
responders hand has a void but no Ace, treat the vold as though
it were an Ace; 2. When responder’s hand has a void and an Ace
in outside suits. and second round control in the asked suit, Show
the Ace, disregard the void: 3. With an Ace in the asked suit and
a void outside, bid the voidi with void in the asked suit and all
Ace outside, bid the Ace.

In general, the first asking bid and its responses reveal either
first or second round control in the asked suit and all first round
controls in the outside suits. The second asking bid discloses infors
mation about all second round controls which have not been ro<
vealed.

Hand 1. (a) Spades are the agreed trump suit. (b) it: is the
first asking bid. Clubs is the asked suit. (c) North has neither
first nor second round control, he therefore signs off by returning
to the agreed trump suit at the lowest possible level.

Hand 2, (3) Hearts have been bid and raised, there is no
reason for South to bid clubs other than to make an asking bid
since game in hearts is the obvious target of the bidding. it: must
be an asking bid, (b) North has second round control in clubs and
the Ace of trump, he therefore jumps trump, (c) From his knowl-
edge of the Controls and distributional information in the bidding
South bids the slam. (d) North now cannot bid.

Hand 3, (a) Spades are the agreed trump suit, they have been
bid and raised. (1)) 4C is the first asking bid, clubs is the asked
suit. (c) With second round control in the asked suit and an Ace
outside you bid the Ace, therefore North bids 4]] showing the
Ace. (d) South still needs to know about North’s Kings, so he
makes a second asking bid. It is important to note that South could
have made his second asking bid in any suit but trump, but some
suits will reveal more information than others, therefore he is
cazeful to choose hearts as his second asking bid. He needs to know
if his partner has the King of Hearts. (e) Nonh has the King of
hearts and the King of spades he therefore jumps trump. (0

and for the sake of revenge my
prediction is 27—23 in favor of
the Pioneers.

The barriers beat Comell 25-

ders, Last year Cornell squeak-
ed by with a 27-23 football vie-
tory. The pioneers will be out

to revenge that defeat.

A prediction for that game
would be a shot in the dark but
I will attempt it. Cornell has a
lot of depth this year having
lost only five men to gradua-
tion. They will be playing for
the home fans. Grinnell comes
to them after almost tying the
conference champs of last
year. There is bound to be a
let down and their performance
d e p e n d s on their ability to
bounce back. I think they can
and will win if they show the
spirit they had against the
Oles. It should he a close game
