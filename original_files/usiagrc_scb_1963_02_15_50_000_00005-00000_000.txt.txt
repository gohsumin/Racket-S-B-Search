By John \Voli

The Liberian government is
attempting to raise that coun—
try's literacy rate lrom 10% to
50% in the next ten years, ac-
cording to Melvin J. Mason,
dean oi Cuttington
Liberia, West Airica. Dean Ma-
son made this remark during a
slideqllustrated talk on Liber—
ia last Monday in the science
lecture room.

The present low literacy rate,
Dean Mason noted, is due to
several iactors. First, there are

one is irom Philip Klein, who is currently teach

Concepcion, Chile,

At present ta Monday eveningl, rm aware oi sev-
eral sounds while sitting in the bedroom of my
Chilean home. a phonograph is playing lively cuccas
in the next room, some children arc pounding on some
kind of a drum out on the sidewalk. Gladys is moving
around upstairs, changing clothes to go to the neigh—
bor's birthday party tonight, and any time now Carlos
’will come back from an errand he had to run. and
Herman. his cousin who is visiting ii-om Valparaiso,
will ring the doorbell, l should also be getting ready
ior this fiesta soon, which will be starting in about
ten minutes

This attei-noon we took advantage ot the heaiitirul
Chilean summer to go to a nearby beach, located a
kilometer out or town and in a little iishing village

which must be the same as it has been ior 100 years.
The ocean, it perhaps a bit cold, is very peaceiul;
there's not much wind and plenty ol sand and sun. It
you get bored just sunning and relaxing, you can ale
ways sit up, look around, and spot a iricnd you haven't
seen tor a while not too iar away, This aiternoon i
ran into several oi my students trom thc colcgio, also
enthusiastically enjoying the attractions oi a nice
beach in a rustic atmosphere during their summer va~

Going to the beach during the day and getting to.

ning are a couple ol the principal and iavoritc activ-
itics of the lamin with which rm living, in a lower
middle—class housing development iust outside oi
Concepcion. Also popular as amusements are converse»
tion at any hour and taking walks. tor those people
have no televisions, bowling alleys or other toms of
ready-made entertainment.

Since there’s no place to go and no Way to get '

there, they have periectcd the iine art oi enjoying
themselves with whatever they happen to have on
hand at the moment. For example. the other day
we spent the greater part ot the aitcrnoon discover—
ing, as a kind oi game. now and novel ivays to swat
{lies in the living room, Since therc was an abundnnt
supply oi the posts and thcy had begun to disturb
the normal course oi peaceiiil conversation.

A little later, we took a wall: up the hill to the
big water reservoir. with no particular purpose and
thus were delighted to find, on the way back, a big
spider in the path, whom we spent over an hour kill-
mg with igenious tortuscs, tinally bringing it home
with us as a trophy.

In other words, liic during summer vacation is
pretty easy and lazy, For me, especially, it represents
many opportunities to pet to know better the lamity

zone. Of Course, things Lire a bit different during the
school year. when there i a regula schedule of work,
My duties include teaching English in the classroom
and in extra, voluntary sessions of informal Conver»

sation, teaching baseball and meddling somewhat in
musical activities.

The Classroom work is made considerably simpler
tor me by the fact that the main English teacher Eil-
i‘cady has a course plan of what is to be taught; You h-
ly speaking, I follow it, giving more emphasis to oral
drill and idiomatic usage,

My students (all boys, grades seven through
twelve) are certainly friendly enough and have ac-
cepted me very well, perhaps even more as it friend
than as n teachch

Outside of class they speak to me in the familiar
“tu” iorm of address (I'm the only teacher enjoying
that distinction!) and many have invited me to their
homes to meet their tamilic Likewise, they ask me
to accompany them on class trips and on small camp—-
ing outings, etc, rm only too happy to accept. and as
a rcsult have iorined i-nany close ti-iendships, especially
among the older boys,

in tact. the close contact with the boys outside of
class has been more rcwai ing tor me than the more
formal insclass work. Thi plus my experiences in
living with a Chilean iamily, enables me to mix to
the greatest extent into the authentic life of the region.
