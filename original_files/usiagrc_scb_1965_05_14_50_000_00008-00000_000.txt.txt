Pioneers Beaten
By Coe in Ninth

The Gi’innell Pioneers near-
ly pulled an upset over the
newly crowned MidwesL con-
ference southern diviSlon cham-
pions Coe here Wednesday be-
fore dropping a 7-5 decision in
the ninth inning.

Coe jumped 10 an early 3-0
lead with single markers in the
second, fourth, and fifth in-
nings. In the bottom half of the
firm the Pioneers began to
llail the shillelaghes as they
banged out three runs with
Denny Hanssen’s two-run sin-
gle tying the score.

Again in the seventh, Coe
pushed across a tie-breaking
run for a 4-3 lead. The Pioneers
roared back in the eighth in-
ning. With two out and a run-
ner on first base, Bob Geller
took two and hit to right for a
triple and scored on a. wild
throw to third. Going into the
last inning the Pioneers held a
5.4 advantage.

In the top half of the ninth
the Coe lead-off man tripled
to center field. With one out,
a can of corn was belted to
center field and was misjudged
for an inside—the—park home
run. The next Coe batter shille-
laghed the pellet over the left
field fence to ice the ballgame
7,5.

Hanssen, one of the better
ones in the business, pitched
the route. Previously he had
handcuffed Coe with a 1-“ one-
hitter at Coe.

So ended another season on
the ball-yard.
