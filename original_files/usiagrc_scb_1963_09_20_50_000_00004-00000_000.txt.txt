This season, more than any other in recent Midwest
Conference football history, advantageous scheduling will
probably be important in determining the Conferencel
champ. Not only is the number of home games played,
among the top five picks significant, but their order is
also impoltant.

Ripon, given the top draw on a basis of persons
nel, will have a tough time coming through four succes-
sive weeks of One, Carleton, Lawrence, and St. Olaf (only
the Viking game being at home) without spotting their
record. The Redmen are looking for quarterback Jack An-
kerson to lead them over these opponents and the f0)‘mld~‘
able Pioneers whom they meet tomorrow.

Scheduling‘breaks greatly influenced the Choosing
of C02, Lluvrence, and Grinnell for the next three spots
respectively. Although losing some key men, the Kid
hawks got some breaks elsewhere: if they can survive
the Ole and Redlnan contests on the Second and third
weekends of the season, they have two comparatively
easy games before meeting Gl'innell at home, and an-
other “rest” before facing Lawrence in their finale.
The Vikings, meanwhile, play three of their top four op-
ponents at home as a boost to their cause. However,
they meet: Ripon away the Weekend after hitting the Pio-
neers, and the prospect of playing above .500 ball here
is slim. .

The Pioneers, on the other hand, have the misfortune
of catching the top three picks all on the road, meeting
only number five selection, St. Olaf, on Ward Field. There

won‘t have to meet any two of their most distinguished
opponents in a row.

St. Olaf, ‘muste ng some of its usual power, has been
selected to fill the fifth position, and has the opportunity
of playing both Coe and Ripon at Nol‘thlﬁeld. Usually
strong Carleton and Cornell have slipped somewhat in the
poll this year and occupy the sixth and seventh rungs on
the ladder.

While Beloit, Monmouth, and Knox seem to have
more promise than in the past few seasons, they probably
won’t be able to break out of the bottom three Slots.

One MCAC coach has commented that he thinks the
winner this year will have two losses. If this is the case,
there is a good possibility of another three way tic, remi-
niscent of the tight Conference race two years ago.

Freshman Harriers

,Commence Training

An inexperienced freshman
cross country l‘eam began work
outs this week under coach Dick

-Young.

Only two of the fresh, Dcnnis
Gallagher and Glenn Elliot, have
had previous cross country ex-
perience. The remainder oi the
squad are newcomers to the
sport.

Gallagher, who was named
captain of the freshman team,
has been working out with the
varsity for two weeks. Coach
Young reports that he has good
cross country potential.

Other team members are
Charles Berkey, Torn Bezanson,
Burt McDowell, John Milne, Ed-
mund Schmeichel, and Dick
Starkeson.

Life

“Hey Mac, where can I ﬁnd
the local bookie?”

“Just go to the local pet store
and ask for Max.”

As 1 entered the store 1 no.
;ticed one of the north campus
1house presidents buying a bowl
‘of guppies for hall mascots, 1
asked the proprietor it he knew
Max; 1 was escorted through the
back door into a dimly lit,
smokceﬁlled room.

1 was introduced to Max. He
was a short but stocky man‘ with
a well preserved build, and 1
naturally presumed that he was
lthe product of Saga food. I was
told that Max was one of the
most promising jocks in Grin»
nell 1M history, but injuries suse
taincd during a water tight end-
ed his chance for stardom.

The blackboard over Max’s
desk listed the predictions for
the football competition. They
were as follows:

Max said that most of the 10-
cal bookies were 'worried about
a long shot winning because of
the possible talent of the fresh»
man. His three top choices for
the over-all winner of the Mac-

‘Murray Trophy are Smith, ‘North

and Dibble.
Just. as I was about to leave

'Msx’s establishment, the results

of the ﬁrst day’s games came
over the wire — Dibble over
Smith, 28-6; Gates Dv‘er Langan,
1370; and Cowles over West,
13-0. ‘

Max refused to take any bets
on the tennis tournament. which
begins in about a week. He said
it was “just too uncertain.”
