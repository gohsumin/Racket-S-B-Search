As shown by Thursday night’s,

 

performance, Miss Pannwitt does
a very etiective job as the alter»
nately coy and aggressive Nancy
A little weak at ﬁrst. she steals
the show in the third act With her
marvelous facial expressions and
physical gestures. The use at gas
tures in The Knack borders on
acrobatics, which combined with
the noisy tempo, produces an un—
restrained and undisciplined but
not unpleasant perlormnnce.

Carlrae as Colin lacks smooth»

the second and third acts he is fair-
ly strong, l-le pretends to be a lion
in one of Tom's wildly absurd fan-

tion and arrives as ti clearly por-
trayed character at the end of the
play

The entire cast over-acts this
little play, which is probably the
only way to handle such a script
The result is nothing stupendous,
which should leave the audiences
laughing, entertained, and unim—
pressed.

Tally: says “There is little skill
and no subtlety In a three-minute
make.” We might observe a simi-
lar lack In [his three-act concentrate

tion at cleverness, iantasy, crude-
ness, and, above all contusion.

Actually there )5 no subtlety
whatsoever, but a respectable de-
gree oi skill is retained particulan
ly by McCoy and Miss Pannwttt.

The play is wellrsutted tor a col-
lege theatre’s cast and audlence,
It can be and is handled effectively
and enterrainingly without probing
into dramatic depths too near the
limits or our understanding.
