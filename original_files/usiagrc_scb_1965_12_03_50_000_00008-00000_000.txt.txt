Ed. Note: The American Nazi
Party, the Ku Klux Klan, and
the Hell‘s Angel’s maintained a
“counter demonstration" while
the peace march and rally were
going. One of the speakers was
the president of the American
Nazi Party, George Lincoln
Rockwellr SB‘B Slaff member
Karen Summers tape recorded
his speech and primed below is
the text of that speech The
quotes in parenthesis are those of
hecklers, of which the crowd
was almost‘ entirely composed.

Traitors, and the tew at you that
may still be Americans; I might
tell you betore l begin that I do a
lot better with some heckling, so
let’s have it. Pour it on. Especial-
ly heckllng from colored peeple
and guys with big long noses. All
right let’s have it. That’s a boy,
let’s have it good there.

All over this Capital today people
are desecrattng the boys who are
over there getting killed. Yesterday
they got killed, the day betore they
got killed. they’ll be killed today
and you people are marching
around on behalf of the enemy . . .
(“You can't talk about our boys
over lhere.")

Well I went down [here on
Pennsylvania Avenue and found
one or you ﬁlthy people with a
Communist Viet Cong flag and
I tore it down And I think that
any American that has any guts
ought to be down there tearing
every Communist Viet Cong ﬂag
down. And if we could afford it,
ladies and gentlemen, I‘d tear
down every ﬂag, as tast as
they‘d let me out I'd come right
back and tear out another one,
but we haven’t got the tunds.
All those who are preaching
