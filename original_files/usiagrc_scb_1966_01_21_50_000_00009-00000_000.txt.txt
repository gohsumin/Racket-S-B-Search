.Vleggeii Talks About Hall System
To Chicago-Area Alumni. Friends

' By SUE TAYLOR, '65

CHICAGO — An estimated 300
Chicago area alumni and friends
,of the college recently attended a
dinner and reception December 10
honoring Dr. Glenn Leggett, Grin<
‘oell’s eighth president. Dllring a
brief address, Dr. Leggett discus-
sed the college’s residence hall
system and promised that some
.recammendations regarding pro-
posed changes in the system
would be coming from his office
by spring. ,

Leggett stressed his desire to
rid the system at its inflexibility.
"The residence hall system ought
to be ﬂexible enough to provide
for various kinds of students” he
said. He explained, for example,
that there are two distinct kinds
or, senior men—those seriously
preparing tor graduate school and
those who are devoted to the res-
idence hall system. Leggett said
that provisions should be made to
accommodate both in the dormi-
tories.

Dr. Leggett assured his audi-
ence that the concern over the
residence halls began several
years ago with the iaculty, and
that both Lhe investigation and

. concernY and his recommenda-
tions are on “academic grounds.”
He said that the problem has
been discussed at length with stil-
dents and iaeulty.

 

When asked about u proposal
that would place all juniors and
seniors on north campus and all
sophomores and ireshmen on
smith campus, Leggett said, “I
think it's sate to say that we have
tabled the idea." However, he
said, there is some thinking about
the possibility of a senior dorm.

Leggett's remants were primar-
ily concerned with north campus.
“We’ve given up the thought of
doing anything about the south
campus problem,” he said. ”It we
can solve the north campus prob-
lem, a good many or the problems
on south campus will disappearr"
He explained that south campus
problems are a reﬂection of north
campus problems, and added that
women generally manage their
Social problems better than men.

However, he added, “We’re al»
most ready now to make a recom-
mendation on a new (women’s)
residence hall.”

The alumni gathering was held
in suburban Hinsdale. In addition
to Dr, and Mrs. Leggett, the Cole
lege community was represented
by Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Wall (his-
tory), Coach and Mrs. Edd BowA
ers (men's physical education),
Dr. and Mrs. Grant Gale (physics),
and Alumni Secretary Mary G.
Jones. Alumni present ranged
from Ihe class of ’65 to the class
