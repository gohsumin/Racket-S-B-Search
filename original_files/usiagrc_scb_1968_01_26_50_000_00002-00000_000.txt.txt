"Nail ’em up if they don't deliver!”

A Very Good Notion Indeed

A nervous pat on the back this week to Presi-
'dent Glenn Leggett for his forthright decision to
discuss and decide College policy towards military
recruiting on campus BEFORE the recruiters ac—
tually came.

A few weeks ago—at the height of anti-Dow
demonstrations in scattered American colleges and
universities~columnist Wm. F. Buckley, Jr. praised
the provost of the University of Rochester as “the
nearest thing , r . to a Congressional Medal of Honor
winner in the academic world."

What did the Rochester provost—one Dr. Mc-
Crea Hazlett—do to win such kudos from Conserv-
ative Buckley?

Dr. Hazlett calmly suspended 23 graduate stu-
dents involved in the sit-ins for the entire Spring
semester, thus picking up Buckley’s plaudits as,
oddly enough, “the almost»hero of the forces of
reason.”

He set aside a decision to exonerate “a bunch
of students who, once again, physically prevented
a representative of Dow from meeting with job ap-
plicants."

It seems to the editors of this newspaper that
when one begins giving medals to administrators
who are suspending students left and right, one has
lost some perspective.

Buckley, while lauding Hazlett, had unkind
words for the administrators of Harvard University
who after “a goodish show of indignation . . . did
not convincingly discipline the students”

Well, anyway, what did President Leggett do
to earn his pat on the back? He decided that to wait
until after trouble was happening was absurd—
even for a college president.

He asked a Marine recruiting team to postpone
its visits until he could sample the student body to
see what, exactly, feeling toward military recruit-
ment on campus at Grinnell actually is.

Dr. Leggett didn’t sit on his rump and wait to
expell students, as did Dr. Hazlett. He didn’t have
to exonerate any students. as did the powers that
be at Harvard.

The Scarlet & Black thinks he did the right
thing and that his‘“noti0n that the time to discuss
potential trouble is before it happens" is a very
good notion indeed.

If Dr. Hazlett deserves a Congressional medal,
I think we can at least give Dr. Glenn Leggett a
nervous pat on the back.

Sampling Siuilent Opinion

Survey of student attitude at Grinnell, like
everything else at this place, have always suffered
from non—involvement —— which is to say, apathy.

Past editors of the S&B and many campus or-
ganizations have attempted to sample student opin-
ion by mailbox questionnaires. What they usually
got back consisted of a handful of responses, of
which fully half were jags.

This semester’s S&B will be running student
polls on various campus and off-campus issues every
week, and the editors urge you take them seriously.
Fill them out and be honest when you fill them out.

On page five of this newspaper, you will find
a questionnaire on campus military recruiting. Re-
turn it to us today, and we'll have some answers for
you next week.

Doug Tolleisen (Dibble) said to
wards the end of the alternating
discussion and laughter.

Tollefsen said that Changes in
the counselling system seemed
more important to him ihan n1.
temating sexes in the halls.
MacDowell emphasized that the
Student Affairs Committee was
working on counselling “as one
of its most important consid-
orations.”

Senior Senator T. J. Smith
(Gates) probably best summed
up the entire discussion on the
subject.

“I almost wish I was coming
back next year to see it," Smith
avowed, “A really highly-inte-
grated police state.”

long after the laughs on open
donns and long after ihe Senate
had pondered several other
items, a freshman from Smith
—nat a senator -— bmught the
Senate info a state of extremely
quiet seriousness.

James Trotter stood before
the student government repre-
senfatiVeS and asked, in essence,
for a student vote “on whether
we want alternating dorms or
the status quo."

“On a mailer as important
as our living conditions,” Trot-
ter declared, “we should have
a say in whether we want u
change or not.”

Trotter asked {or a sampling
of the student body. In the next
issue of the 5&3 (February 2)
a questionnaire on the subject
will appear.

"No one has any idea of gen-
oral student opinion on the sub.
ject yet," Trotter concluded,
“and We have to know what the
sludents think before we can act
in Iheir interest."

MOTION DEFEATED

Defeated Wednesday night by
a 25—8 vote was a resolution that
the Senate recommend to the
Election Board the abolishment
of the SGA convention this year.

Torn Triplett, sponsor, decried
the "petty politicking” associ-
ated with the convention.

The North Younker senator
added that often the convention
seems like a game, and that
the "common picture of the
convention helps to degrade the
image of SGA.“

ANTI-ANTI—WAR AGENCY

By SHEILA RYAN
LIBERATION News Service

WASHINGTON. Jan. 19 —~ The new unit of the Justice Depart-
ment, established to deal with violations of the Selective Service
laws is apparently to be a super-secret entity, The Justice Dept.
has refused to release any information on the plans of the unit
or the names of personnel assigned to it.

Officials also refuse to specify the number of employees under
the unit, or even to state whether it is “tiny" or “massive.”

The special prosecution unit is headed by John Van de Kamp,
former US. Attorney for the Central District of Califomla and
currently Deputy Director of the Executive Office for US. At~
tomeys.

The Justice Dept. has turned down all requests from the press
for interviews with Mr. Van de Kamp.

The Attorney General’s year—end repnn stated that “intensive
investigative and legal work done in 1967 was to lead to prosecu~
[ions in 1963 for aiding and abetting violations of Selective Service
law—the first such prosecutions in a decade."

in 1567, the Justice Dept. initiated 1,648 prosecutions undet
the Universal Training Act.

This represents an increase of 62 per cent over 1966, and 220
per cent over 1965.

952 convictions were obtained, a figure up 78 per cent from
1966 and 250 per cent from 1965. The average sentence meted out
to those convicted under the draft law increased from 25.4 months
in 1966 to 32.1 months in the past year.

Recent statements by Attomey General Ramsey Clark indi-
cate that the Justice Dept, is gearing up for a crackdown on in-
surgent elements of the American population.

Six weeks ago. in an announcement of the fonnation of the
draft law prosecution unit, Clark said, “All U.S. Attorneys have
been instructed to expedite investigation and prosecutorial recom-
mendations on these cases. They have also been directed to co
operate wxfh local law enforcement officials and to urge them
to vigorously prosecute violations of local laws which may occur
in demonstrations against the Selective Service System." _

One Justice Dept. employee who has no reluctance to voice
her views on action against resistors ls Mrs. Audrey Shippen, of
the visitors‘ information desk.

Mrs. Shippen disclosed that “someone higher up than my im-
mediate superior” had instructed her to beat a quick retreat from
her post heat the Tenth Street and Pennsylvania entrance to the
building “if things got rough" during the demonstration on Jan.
12.

Mrs. Shippen said she was not afraid at the time because
she was “well protected” by G.S.A. guards, including reinforce-
ments irom buildings other than the Justice Dept, “some city
police, plain Clothesmen, and maybe F.B.l.”

She whispered, “They even used walkie-talkies . . . Oh yes,
they did, Uncle Sam’s not asleep at the switch, as some of those
demonstrators think he is.”

Mrs. Shippen asserted that the elaborate precautions for the
security of the Justice Dept. were necessary because "those
people aren’t mentally balanced, you know. You never know
what they might do.”

Did she think Dr. Spock for example, might go berserk in the
Justice Dept}? “You can never tell about those creatures. I never
read his book myself, but I know some mothers who did, and
personally, i think what he wrote about babies is a lot of bull."
