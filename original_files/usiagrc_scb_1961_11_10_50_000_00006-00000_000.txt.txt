Debate Legali’ry Oi Resolul'ion

A debate on the constitution-
ality oi the resolution passed by
the Senate during its Monday
night meeting was held Tuesday
night in Cowles lounge between
SGA president Bill nalama and

Cowles freshman Phil Johnson.‘

The debate, somewhat impromp-
tu, was witnessed by almost 10
men.

Johnson, speaking for the neg-
ative. emphasized that by its
decision, the Senate had violate
ed the preamble of the SGA
Constitution, which states that
the SGA ”shall administer and
legislate rules pertaining to those
aspects at student life not
specifically reserved by the pies-
ideni,”

By acting in this way, the Sena
ate has made of itself a pres
sure group, Johnson said. Furth-
ermore, it is violating minority
rights by using both its influ-
ence and its money (which in
part belongs to the minority)
for interviews and press eon-
rerences, while the minority has
no chance to do so.

Kalama, speaking tor the ai-
iirmalive, emphasized t h a t

is to make decisions. it it does
not do this, he said, it loses all

Sandwiched in between the
opening statements and the re-
buttals, members oi the audir
‘ence were allowed to direct
questions at Johnson and Hala—
ma, both singly and together.

The debate was occasioned.
