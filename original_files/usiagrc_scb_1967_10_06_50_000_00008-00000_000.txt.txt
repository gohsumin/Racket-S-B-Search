By BARRY ANCONA

The Pioneer football team suf-
iei'ed its second defeat of the
season at the hands of the
Cornell Rams at Mt. Ven‘lon

was just one paint off last
year's defeat score.

The Grinnell gridders out-
rushed Cornell l15 yards to 108,
but fell short on pass yardage
and punting. The Pioneers com-
pleted 17 of 32 passes for 229

55. There were no intercep<
tions. The Pioneers had one punt

yards, while the Rams kicked
It 40,7.

Coach Bowers saw a weak‘
defense and the inability to
platoon as Gl'innell‘s major
Emblems. Two defensive mis.
lies gave the Rams two of
their touchdowns. The small
size of the team makes sub<

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Another week of i, M. football has passed and the players now
move into the final week of the schedule. There was something
good for everyone last week.

Langan won a game thus bringing joy to the hearts of those
on campus who favor change. For those who prefer the status quo,
Dibble Continued to win, a phenomenon which evokes about as
much response as a sunrise on a cloudy day..lltith the Yankees,
the Celtics, and the Packers all having difficult times, though, it

 

'1: always nice to have something reliable to restore your faith in

the order of the universe.

Highlight of this week’s play will be the second annual Bird
Bowl pitting Clark against Cowles. The trophy which goes to the
winner is the Dibble eagle, which appears somewhat incongruous
but apparently does not concern the participants.

i didnt get a chance to see a girls' softball game due to the
fact that they cancelled all games after hearing I might attend one

. of them. The next attraction is a sockey (hoccer?) game between

die boys‘ soccer team and the girls’ field hockey team. Don’t bet
against the girls (especially if they get to use their clubs)

The college bowling league started last week with six three.
