Bayli: Greatest Battle is for Men' 5 Minds

By Ann Showalter

Senator Birch Bayh of In-
gana climaxed Democratic

ay events Tuesday with his
peech, “The Great Society—At

omo and Abroad,” at the 8
.mi rally in Darby Gym.

”We cannot solve the prob
lems of the space age with stone
rgc mentality,” Bayh declared.
‘We have to decide whether we

9 going to accept Lyndon
ohnson’s challenge—to contin~
he to build the Great Society."

He sketched the three main
’goals of the Great Societyi
equal opportunity for everyone
in America, gradual disarma-
ment, and winning the support
of emerging nations. He ex—
plained how he feels the Ad
ministration and the Congress
have been moving toward
these goals and how the pres
ent Republican leadership has
worked against them,

“The right of equal opportun-
ity is the right of every Amer-
can boy and girl to dream and
to make their dreams come
true because they work for
them,” Bayh stated.

He feels America has moved
closer to achieving the Great
Society at home during the last
four years. He cited bills passed

 

by the Eightyrelghth Congress
providing increased vocational
education funds for college
classrooms, libraries and equip-
ment and loan programs for
prospective doctors, dentists
and nurses. _

Bayh praised the American
arms program because “its
aim is to protect the peace, not
to wage war.” He hopes for a
gradual reduction in the need
for arms until “the day when
man will sit down and talk
about their problems instead of
shooting them out.”

The junior senator from In-
diana said there was no bill
he felt more honored to vote
for than the ratification of the
nuclear test ban treaty. “This
is not the panacea,” he ad-
mitted, “but it is the first time
man has had the power to de-
stroy the world that he has
voted to limit this power.” He
pointed out that Senator Barry
Goldwater opposed the treaty.

He also criticized the Repub-
lican candidate’s opposition to
the "hot line” between White
House and Kremlin. “Anyone
who has read Fail-Safe or seen
Dr. Strangelove realizes there
is a chance the hot line could
prevent accidental nllclear dis-
aster," he said.

 

Bayli believes, ‘Only one man
Should be entrusted with the fi-
nal say in the use of the weap»
Oils in our arsenal, and that
man is the President of the
United States.” Thus he op-
poses Goldwater's plan to en-
trust the field commanders
with the authority to launch tac—
tical nuclear weapons.

According to Bayh, however,
the greatest problem we face
is not that of armed conflictl
The real battle is the battle
for men’s minds,"

He elaborated, ‘The emergv
ing nations must choose be-
tween the freedom we offer and
the shackling of mind and body
by the Communists,"

He suggested there is a close
relationship between our abil-
ity to solve problems within our
country and our ability to win
the “minds and hearts of these
awakening men."

“They are looking at us and
they are looking at the Rue
sians,” he declared, “and it is
up to us to present America,
the Great Society, in a manner
that will spread the cause of
freedom."

Stressing the “need for dis
content,” Bayl-l quoted Edmund
Burke: “All that is needed for
evil to prevail in the world is

eracy themselves.

issue of Campaign Is Candidates'
Judgement in Nuclear War Realm

By Lynn Denzler

Senator Birch anh, visiting
politician - in - residence, stated
before a student press confer
ence Tuesday afternoon that the
big issue in this year’s presi-
dential campaign c o n c e r n s
which man has the better judg-
ment in determining the actions
that a president might need to
take in the realm of nuclear
war.

The indiana Democrat made

the statement in contradicting
an analysis offered last week by
another visitor, Senator Peter
H. Dominick (ll-Colo), who
Said that he felt the issue of
the campaign concerned cena
tralizatlon of government.
- Bayh said that he would con-
sider centralization far down
the line of issues “if it is an is-
sue at all” and he went on to
speak of the quality of judgment
in the candidates.

“The question isn't that
Goldwater wants to start a war,
and Johnson doesn’t,” he said.
“Actually neither does” The
youthful freshman Senator con-
tinued by saying that the appar-
ent inconsistencies in the stands
that Republican candidate Bar-
ry M, Goldwater takes in his
speeches come from the fact
that he is not as well versed 0n
the issues as he should be.

“His statements are those of
a man who doesn’t use respon-
sible judgment before he talks.
You Can call it hipeshooting if
you want," the Senator re—
marked in answer to a student
query.

When asked about the appar—
ent Democratic attempt to cov»
er up the Bobby Baker scandal
for political reasons, the Senna
tor outlined Specific moves that
have been made by the admin-
istration to investigate the sub

ject. Bayh stated that he him.=
“violated

self felt that Baker
good conscience when he ped-
dled influence. No one in the
Senate Condones this,” he said.
He was critical however of
those who would make a pol";
icul football out of such a Situa-
Lion.

“The Republicans Want to
make the Bobby Baker issue a
big thing, but I have yet to' see
his name on any ballot.” Bayh
said.

While speaking on this sub-
ject the Senator said that he
would support the establish-
mcni of a code of ethics de-

 

signed for‘membets of the Sen-
ate.

“This is a serious thing to all
those who want government of
great respect,” he told the stu—
dents, “How can we get young
people lik‘e'iyou to come into
government when others have
tried to tear it down.”

As a freshman senator, he
has been called a “rebel" by
members of his party for stands
he has taken against the ad-
ministration-supported bills. In‘
defending his voting record,
Bayh emphasized that he felt
each senator should vote ac-
cording to what he believed
were the best interests of the
country.

When asked about the prob-
lems of agriculture, Bayh said
that he felt the Republican pro»
posals were completely Inade<
quate. “Taking the federal gow
ernment out of agriculture with
a snap at your fingers will only
create chaos,” he continued.

He further recognized that
some definite improvements
are needed by the administra-
tion in this area. “What is
needed is a long range answer
and not stop—gap proposals,” he
said.

Returning to the problem of
the president’s responsibility in
determining possible nuclear
war Bayh stated that he felt the
president is the only qualified
man to make such a choice. He
emphasized that reason is
needed today more than ever
before and said, “It takes a
bigger man to reason than it
does to bluster."

When asked about the results
of the so-called “White back-
lash" on the November voting
returns, the Senator felt that
many other issues would be
more important when the filial
time to vote arrives, He further
felt that peaceiul Civil Rights
demonstration, like any other,
was part of a sacred right for
any group, but added thut vio—
lence in this area, which we
have had, is detrimental l0 ulli-
mate accomplishment,"

Bayh was quick to admit that
the United States Was not win-
ning in Viet Nam, but could
not offer an answer to the prolr
lem. He talked about the two
apparent alternatives, to wage
all out combat for Victory, or
to pull out entirely, as inilile~
quate, and said that the U. S.
was going to have to atij st
what she has been doing in or-
der to iind another solution.
