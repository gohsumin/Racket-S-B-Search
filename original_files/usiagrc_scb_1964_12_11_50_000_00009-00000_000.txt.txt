Ken \Strubler and Mike
Deatherage are also sure to be
in the lineup, but may move

guard Elliott Hibbs. with 20
and 19 points respectively, Ted

and'Jelf Frantz also scored in;
double figures: Grillnell nets

ted. 34 of 57 shots from the floor
and 31 of 39 from the free
throw line in beating highly
regarded Cornell.

Coach Pfitsch called the
game one of the three best
games played by Grinnell in
his career as coach. He added

that there was a great effort.
put forth by everybody whoi

played. He concluded by say
ing that. Cornell is a good team
that was a little overconfident
and was buried under the Grins
nell avalanche before it could
get started.

’Coacl-l Piitsch was pleased
with the play of his guards.
Included among Elliott Hibbs’s

19 points were 11 points in the‘

second half when he had ﬂour
fouls. Jeff Frantz scored 13
points and played a superior
floor game as did reserve Bob
Watt. Forward Ted Risser had

a productive first half with 13‘

points. The slack in the second
half was taken up by center
Jim Rhodes Who then scored
13 of his points. Rhodes put on
a great display of shooting by
making six of eight shots from
the floor and all eight from the
free throw line.

Grinnell applied a full court
press for the whole game which
Consistently rattled Cornell.
Grinnell then got several easy
baskets.

Coach Pfitsch this week has
been trying to keep his team
from getting overconfident or
from having a letdown after
the tremendous game of last
week. ‘
