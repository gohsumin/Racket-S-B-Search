Eight

Team Loses to U of Chicago

By Barry Ancona

The Gtinnell basketball team
braved icy roads and six
hches of snow to play the
Maroon: of the University of
Chicago last Saturday. The
Irowd of close to three hundred
theering Chicago fans did not
Intimidate the handful of Grin-
nell footers, but the 70-511 de-
feat did.

In the first half, the Pioneers
hit 42 per cent from the field,
but this percentage was off-
set by a 27 per cent free throw
mark and numerous instances
of traveling and throwing the
ball away.

The first few minutes of the
second half saw Grinnell's
'downfall as Chicago shot un-
erringly from close in and out-
side to run up a twenty point
lead. The Pioneer bench took
I turn on the boards and fin-
ished the game.

Elliott Hibbs and Mike
Schwartz, third and fourth in
Midwest Conference scoring,
managed only 5 and 9 points
respectively. Roger Able was
high scorer with 10. Others
scoring: Tom Hill and Tom
Lower, 1 each; Bob Watt and
Thor Evanson, 4 each; Steve
Brintnall and Jim Stephens, 2
each.

The alumni present at the
game seemed understanding
about Grlnnell’o twenty-first
consecutive loss, and one re-
marked to Coach Pfitsch, “You
can't win them all," Replied
the Coach, “You mean we can’t
win any.”

The cagers travel to Mt,
Vernon tomorrow to take on
the second place Cornell team
that handed them their twen-
tieth defeat, 70-69, on January
24 in Darby Gym. Their next
home game is Feb. 21 against
Monmouth.

ers for its first “A" game.
Having erupted for 13 points
in its first team effort, South
left little doubt that it will have
to be reckoned with, though
not necessarily as a basket-
ball team.

Clark's “B" team set a re-
cord of sorts by committing
four consecutive technical; in
its game against Langan. The
technicals had little effect, how-
ever, because Sam Carrell’s 28
points led Clark to an easy
victory. Langan’s “A” team,

this dream has not been ren-

along at about .500.

Smith, North and Dibble,
