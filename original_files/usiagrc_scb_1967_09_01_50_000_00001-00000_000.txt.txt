Gymnasium.

A veteran of America’s space
program who covered early
launches with field glasses from
the beach just outside of Cape
Kennedy, the 43-year—old Hacked
has seen teIeVlslon’s space cov-
erage grow to a level of so-
phistication that includes the
use of true-to-lite models and
moclcups,

He has reported every man-
ned space flight, and during
recent nights his assignment
has been to simulate the Var-
ious tasks periormed by the
astronauts in outer space. By
using space models, he demon»
stl‘ales how the mission is car-
ried out.

On general assignment in
Washington, DC, Hackes con~
centrales on reporting the ac-
tivities of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administra-
tion. the National Aeronautics
and Space Council, and the
Senate and House Space Com-
niittecs. His assignments also
include the Department or Do-
fense (where he was NBC
News Pentagon correspondent
for 10 years), the Atomic En-
ergy Commission, the Federal
Aviation Agency, the Departe
ment of Transportation, and
other areas or the federal govA
erlinicnt.

A native of New York City,
Hackes attended Grilillell Col~
logo in 1942-43 and alter three
years ill the Navy returned to
Cvl‘lllllell and received a B.A.
degree in English (journalism)
in 1948.

was a member of the campus
newspaper, radio station, lit~
erary magazine, and humor
magazine stalls, and or the
cllmr anti glee club. He was
elected to membership in Sigma
Delta Chi and Friars.

NEW LOGGIA DOORS
PROVIDE SAFE EXITS

The threat or a Triangle firs

which, at night, has hung so
long over the heads or the
virtually (slc) imprisoned girls
of South Campus, has been put
to rout by the lnstallatloll 0!
double panio doors on the Log-
gia.

The cause or these neglected
women was championed last
spring by Grinnell's newspaper
editor. who pointed out that the
Loggia doors, locked as they
were by Straight bolls which

only dangerous, but were illegall

Other advantages or the new
doors include the opportunity
to enter or exit through either
door (although the unsightly

it is, oi course, only a co-
incidence that the replacement
oi the door locks took place
at the same time as the ellm<

The girls at south Campus
may now sleep assured that,
thanks to the new locks. they
may safely exit from the loggla
in case or emergency, and
that at the same time they are
protected from the vicious dan-
gers lurking on the darkened

From The President

Dear Studentsl

it is good to have you here. The place isn't the same without
you. As one ot my presidential colleagues, l-larold Stoke, once ro-
marked,

A campus is dead when its students are not there; it hums
when they are. Not only are the students themselves galvanic
but they galvanize everyone else 7 faculty, deans, presidents,
and campus police. The annual return of the students inspires
in everyone connected with a college the mixed ieelings or
a happy homecoming and the wariness or people who are come
pelled to live in occupied territory.

I wish he had Said II more cheerfully, but he had been at the
job longer than 1, and the important thing is his accuracy. which
Is unquestioned. The purpose or a college, to paraphrase Alfred
North Whitehead, is to unite the old and the young in the imagin-
ative search (or knowledge; but wtthout students to seek. to re-
spond, and to question, a college is nothing, only a group or
separated adults searching for something to commit their learning
and their ‘iopes to.

Grinnell is not this, For 122 years it has been concerned with
the way its students and iaculiy and its academic environment
interact with one another [0 provlde an intellectual and social com«
munity or style and strength and purpose. It is, as I wrote you
newly entering students some time ago, and as you returning
students know, neither pertectly free nor periectly ordered. it has
some or the uninspiring and contusing aspects or real lite in gem
eral, and a good deal of the dull and frustrating characteristics
ol the scholar’s life In particular. It requires from all of us pa-
tience, hard work, and a disciplined way oi talking and writing and

behaving.

But Grinllell will give us much in return: new friends, the
satisfaction ol accomplishing things intellectually that we thought
were beyond us, the sense or our own litness to belong in an iii-
tellectual community. Above all, it wlll give us the opportunity to
educate our imaginations so that we can manage better than we
do now both the strange and exciting world inside us and the
puzzling and sometimes terrible yet remarkable world utilSlde.
The cultivation 0i this inside and outside imagination is What. edtb
cation in the liberal arts means, and What finally, Grlnnell is all
about. i hope you see it this way too. Welcome and welcome back,
and my best Wishes ioi a successtul year,

Glenn Leggett
President
