Shame of Empty Seals

‘ The local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and its distin-
guished speaker were the victims this week of the\ new plan to
hold special chapel services on Wednesday night rather than
the usual Friday morning slot. The chapter could have chosen
no more eloquent member of the college community to address
their group and guests than Evelyn Gardner, yet participants
and visitors alike could not help but note that on a campus
boasting academic excellence, only a handful of students and
faculty members could manage to attend an event attesting to
that excellence.

Those who plan the schedules of chapel events had no
choice but to place such events in the evenings after the admin-
lstration added an extra class hour on Friday mornings But

those who plan and those who influence those plans should
take immediate heed to the warning and do something before

more organizations are embarras‘sEd and more speakers spend
their labors on just a handful.

Students, meanwhile, will try to garner sympathy for their
tough schedules and the lack of time to fulfill those schedules,
land we can certainly see that tO take an hour out late in the
morning is lnuch easier to do than to take a piece out of an
evening. Yet, wllile they face the situation of having the lec-
tures at night, we can only say that to refuse to attend because
they think they don’t have time is Only using poor judgment.
In almost every instance they miss out on something worth-
while. Certainly this was the case Wednesday night.

Are Dance lM's Dying?

“Things have been going smoothly on South Campus since

* >‘n

the ladies instituted their integrated dorm system which placed '

freshmen in every dorm. In fact, things were going just too
smoothly, for the gals woke up this week to find themselves
suffering from a severe case of apathy. The old fire that used
to exist among the freshmen when their numbers were concen»
trated together, and which subsequently would trickle down
the loggia to wash upon some tired and worn upperclass
women was never ignited this year. Thus, the night Of nights,
when the quad puts its pointed foot forward in grandest style,
threatens to see the‘ ladies fall flat on their powdered noses.

' Dance IM’s are coming. Certainly the highlight of the Quad-
rangle activities for the fall semester, Dance IM’s have always
stood as the single time each year when the members of the
Quad get together to put on a worthwhile show and have lots
of fun doing it. Now, few care.

Perhaps the worst part Of the situation concerns those
freshmen ill Main and Loose, whose halls have already dropped
out of competition for lack of interest. They have been short-
changed by their hall presidents and haffleboards. The coin-
plaint from hall officers has been —— well, the freshmen didn’t
sign up. Our complaint is — you didn’t tell them. A piece of
paper on the hall bulletin board has very little claim to fresh-
men interest, but an enthusiastic upperclassman who can tell
them just what the program is all about and how much fun it is
can fill many a signup sheet. Let’s hope that the women of the
Quad don’t follow the examples set by Main and Loose and
allow themselves to be paralyzed by apathy. Integrating the
lorms has spread the Quad’s life blood much thinner. Right
low she lies a little anemic — maybe what she needs is a shot
|f adrenalin. LD

freshman Wonders
About ARH Steps

To the Editor:

As a freshman I have been
pleased with life and seTViCe
at Grinnell. However I do have
an observation to make.

Several weeks ago I nearly
met death in ARH. As I calmly
journeyed from class to class
I slipped down the stairs in
ARH. Had it been only one
flight I might have overlooked
the hazard, but it wasn't and
I’ve been hobblmg ever since.
Seeking sympathy I mentioned
my accident to the girls in the
dorm. Instead of sympathy I
found only the knowing looks
of those who had fallen before
me.

We fallen women would like
to suggest that some safety
precautions be made to guard
against serious accidents in
ARI-I. Because the metal step
guards are worn, they are ex-
tremely dangerous. From all
reports the danger will only be
increased with the Iowa snOWS
and wet boots.

For the sake of all, I urge -

B&G to either level all two
story buildings or make the

ARH stairs more sale.

To the Editor:

Upon reading of the absurdities
in regard to the painting and re-
painting of a students room, I’at
first was sure this must be just a
“gag” letter. But recent word from
Imy son informs me this is no joke,
lbut regrettable truth. i wish to add
,my protests to those of the writer
in the October so issue, Scarlet and
Black Letters to the Editor.

From what I am told there is a
great deal of dissatisfaction among
students in regard to the organizar
tiun in v 01V e d (Buildings and
Grounds) Apparently there have
been other incidents of a similar
nature. Regardless of policy in
such matters, it seems to me the
action taken was childish and Vin»
dictive —- an unreasonable method
of control. I am amazed that this
organization continues to be tolv
erated as a part of the Grinnell
College family.

Study, Don’t Paint,
Says Another Alum

To the Editor!

In regard to theletter from
Jacob B. Browning, an alumnus
from whom I have heard very
little, until now, I disagree.
Every Joe College who comes
along thinks he can change
anything to Suit his own mlel"
ests completely disregarding
institutional regulations that
are established for his own pro
tection, Grinnell is small, sure,
small enough to make blatant
disregard all too obvious. The
school has funds and men to
keep the buildings in tip-top
shape. Let’s hope that that
young man who painted his
room was an art major, other-
Wise he will have gained noth—
ing but an awareness of the
pitfalls of neglecting his stud-
ies for a pointless pastime. The
pages in his books should keep
him busy enough to forget me
walls around him.
