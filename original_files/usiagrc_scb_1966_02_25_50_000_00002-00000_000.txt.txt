Residence Hall System

the Next Step

1 The next step in the move toward hall reorgan—
ization was taken yesterday. President Leggett sent the
letter that is published below to Jerry Goddard, Student
Government President.

>i< >i<
Dear Mr. Goddard:

i Very shortly, I expect to receive from the faculty
its proposal on the residence-hall system, and when I
do, I should like it to be carefully considered by a com—
mittee of faculty and students, a committee which, in
turn, would make recommendations to me about the
ﬁreposal. Such a committee, which We can call the Ad
0c Committee on the Residence Hall System, is to be
chaired by Dean Winters, with yourself as ,co-chairman
and to consist of three faculty persons nominated by
Dean Winters and three students nominated by you.
Will you, accordingly, give me your nominations, which
you can select in any way you think appropriate?

' I expect that Deans Slocum and Thompson will be
asked to meet with the committee frequently, and I
think you may want to ask the AWS president, Miss
Chris Peterson, and the Chairman of the House Presi-
dents, Mr. Nick Nonas, to serve in a similar capacity

‘ Hopefully, the Ad Hoc Committee will be able to
give me its recommendations Within six or eight weeks,
so that a decision can be announced before the semes-
ter is over. Work on the committee will require a good
deal of dedication and perception, as well as good will
and understanding. I know you agree with me that it is
_very important to the College that the task be done

The Grudge Pot

(Continued from last week)

Minnie Twerp had been wandering blindly tor
days in the dark tunnel, and already she had shrunk
another inch, Slle lrcmbled and wept at the thought
oi disappearing lorever in h mouse hole, and wildly
she struggled in regain even her old, iamiliar
basement cell.

Suddenly, a “click, click, click” echoed in the
blackness behind herd Toenails! Rats! Hordes Di
clawed, sharp-toothed, vicious, mangy rats were
galloping inexorably, fatally inward her.

Their heady eyes appeared like not red coals in
the distance, and their warm stinking breath swept
like a wind before them. The rhythm of their claws.
the panting, an almost musical mumbling increased
(0 unbearable intensity.

Minnie ran, and tell, She ran again and came to
a dead end. The savage creatures were upon her,
and she heard distinctly their bestial grunts.

“Hi»ho! Hi-ho! it's off to Steal we go!” A dwarf-
lSl1 hand lit a tiny lantern, and Minnie Twerp saw
twelve ugly, cheerful little Wretches in mouse-hide
coats carrying mounds oi glittering rubies,

My goodness, but. you gave me a fright," sighed
Minnie.

After the Dozen Dwarls had led Minnie Twerp
to their quaint cottage and she had ireshened up a
bit, they showed her a huge bed covered by a iilmy
veil. The curtain was drawn, revealing the hand
somest prince that ever creased a Sadly-Posture-
pedic.

Minnie at once knew her role. and the dwarfs
helped her onlo rhe luxuriant spread. She crawled
across the prince’s forehead and made an innocent
peck at his mouth. Even now, she could almost
taste the charmed apple upon his lips,

The somber snoring ceased. The prince yawned

and nearly swallowed Minnie Twerp. As she held for
dear liie onto his nose, she saw the lllrny eyelids
open to a new — renewed — lire.

"om my iairy princess," said he, grabbing her
about the ankles and holding her in his adoring
sight, “it only our lover’s lips could meet, 1 gladly
would a thousand years~a thousand lifetimes of
empty wakeiuliiess trade for that one embrace." lie
caught a tear on one linger and pushed back her
mussed hair

“But i never hissed you. i missed,” conicssed
M'nnie.

“1 know, most radiant maidr i never was asleep.
it was a gimmick to ensnare a beautiful lass, and
behold, what success! Now let your warm my lips
lose their innocence.”

As the lovers kissed the prince turned mm a
frog. “My lord,” said Minnie in amazement, “linw
comes this transiiguratlon?”

“Croak, croak," replied the prince in frustration.

Minnie paused, then smiled wonderiuliy. “My
lord, my lord! This emerald skin, these eyes bright-
er than the disks of harvest moons, lips enough tor
is dozen lovers and legs lo make an athlete green
with envy — all these are blessings in disguise
Now, you are my size. We are equal. We are one!”

The frog tenderly took the princess in his arms.
Hts quavering llps slowly paned as they neared,
and involuntarily he let out another croak,

The Dozen Dwarfs, Minnie Twerp, and the Frog
prince all laughed wilh joy, and rho royal couple
hopped on logeiher.

in a few years, of course, Minnie ﬁnally dis-
appeared altogether, but the marriage had been
pure bliss while it had lasted. And her demise did
not matter all that much, anyway, since irogs don't
live too long either.

Glenn Leggett

Goddard said that he hopes to have his nominations
for the Ad Hoc committee by Monday or Tuesday.

After the committee makes its recommendations
the finzll decision will, of course, be made by Dr. Leg-
gett, It was pointed out, however, that should the com-
mittee be deadlocked at the end of the six or eight
weeks, no decision could be made this year,

 

613 Vote Yes For New Senate

The Senate reorganization plan
was accepted wilh obvious approv-
al by the voting siudeni body in
Monday's election. The final vote
count was 613 for the plan and
102 ugainsl.

Tl: e are {our major areas of
clia-ge in the revamp idea. First,
the referendum calls for an in-
crease in the number of senators
from each hall. Tile hall will have
[Wt] or thlee seiialcirs depending on
the number of sludenis living in
the hall. No hall will have fewer
than two senalors.

Second, There Will now be a
Speaker of ihe Senate who will be
noni'naisd by llie so»r pl‘CiSldElil

and approved by the Senate. Any
additional nominations must have
a second from one third of the
Senate. The entire Senate will Vote
on the Speaker.

Third, any changes in rules must
originate in me Executive Council,

'that is, the Coil-1P and lhe AWS

Board. These mics must meet with
the approval or the Senate.

Finally, Batileboald members
will now be allowed to run {or
the Senate.

The reorganization plans will
go into efiect ailei- spring vaca»
tion when newly~elected ofﬁcers
will assume incir rcsprciive gov-
erliillg posiiioiis.

 

To the Editor:

This letter is I replyrla two
letters in last week's 5&3. The

first, sent by a disenchanted plr-
ent, raises some rather apparent
doubt as to whom the term
“naive" an be hpplicd. 'rhis por-
ent prefers anonymity » fear of
retribution or only distaste or IC-
tual involvement? The parent
wishes to make the exceptions
(“bottles under pillows . . . bodies
around dark comers”) into the
rule, Perhaps. it this pnrcyit would
document his highly irrational out»
burst with more than einouvoly
charged phrases, someone would
take ihe letter seriously. Perhaps,
also, this parent doesn‘t realize
that the dephrlure of many profess
sors is for much more complex
reasons: many times faculty-ad-
minislraliou conflicl rather than
iacully-sludcnl conﬂict.

in number letter, Steve Eber-
liardi mentions the “carnivorous
(lock or letter vultures" who reply
to 5&8 publications. i wonder why
he calls them omnivorous; this as
Suincs that there is any meal to
be found and devoured. Tile sad;
is rleiinilely lacking meatiness.
There seems to be a general Coils
sensiis oi feeling in this direction.
For example, the iwo letters, one
criticizing the 5&1: oiili-ighi, the
other hinling it a pa 'ble drop
in ciioctivciicss, an ai cle sug-
gcsling more crilicisiii from news
paper editors. and the SGA con-
vention jag vote of "no Votes tor
the 5&3" all point that way. It
does report the news: it does puh-
lish letters. But why does the sails
seem to be cxliihiling this general
iorni iii iiierlia which the Gl'inncll
student blillicly calls apathy? l
lliink llic answer ﬁnds its ground
in the studpnl, himself: apathy is
not a mass phenomcna but a high
1y individual one. The individual
who is unwilling to put his opin-
ions and feelings up lo general

' comment is the one who is anathes

tic, ioi- lie fears lic‘ g forced in
change. it is up to the individual

 

to respond in the needs of the
campus, including the lailure or
the newspaper. ir the Grinnell
community wishes to see the coll-
cept or journalism on this campus
change it is not by criticism alone,
silent or not, but through con-
structivo Arid outspoken sugges—
tiol-i. My suggestion is that each
member or the Grinnell communi-
ty, in whatever mlnner he is able,

respond.
