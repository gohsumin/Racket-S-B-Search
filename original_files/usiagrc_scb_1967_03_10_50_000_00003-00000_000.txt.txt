Mind! to I!"

By David Dillon

in 1958, the Board at Trustees
pledged that all students would
bl admitted to Grinnell on the
basis of character and ability,
regardless oi family income. To
implement this policy, the
Placement and Student Aid Ol-
tice was strengthened, greater
tunds were obtained, while more
leﬁued criteria of distribution
Were developed.

But recent annual tuition
raises pose an even greater
challenge it the college is to
expand its democratic base.
How may we face rising costs,
And maintain a broad social
cross-section in our student
body?

Although other liberal arts
colleges have laced similar fl<
nsncial demands, the need to
provide adequate compensatory
bid is obvious. At present, Grin-
hell is meeting this need. 0p-
fortunity for students from low
ncome backgrounds has ex-
panded. Maintenance at this
capability depends on the con»
(tern of the entire campus com-
munity with long-range goals,
immediate resources, and fu<
tore prospects of the assistance
program.

Written during the adminis<
tretion of former President How
urd Bowen, the comprehensive
fee in 1960-51 was $1,975. Pro-
’ections made that year esti-
mated an increase to $2,475 by
196667, $2,525 by 1967-68, and
52,700 by 1910-71. in fact these
guidelines haveebeen vastly ex-
deeded, as next year's costs
are set at $2,900.

In 1960-81, student aid was
budgeted at $241,400. By this

ear, according to Nicholas D.

yen, Director of Placement and
Student Aid, gift funds admin-
istered by the college amount-
ed to $250,000 in addition, ap-
proximately slooooo was a-
vailable tor longrterm loans,
while campus employment con-
tributed $100,000 more. This col—
lege controlled aid total of
$610,000 is procured from an-
nual operating expenses, endow-
ed and designated grants, and

ovemment loan funds (includ-
rig National Delense Student
Loans - NDSL).

The latter are still a major
component oi the assistance en—
dowment; however, Grinneil’s
NDSL allocation was reduced
about 40 per cent this year.
widened national participation
in NDSL and restricted federal
budgets have forced many
schools to face cuts in these
appropriations.

At the same time, lunds a-
vailable to low-income students
have rapidly mounted. The Rock-
efeller grants to Grinnell, to-
telling $240,000 were specifically
designated for students in mod—
erate or low financial brackets.
They were spread over a seven
year period beginning in 1964.
This $27,000 from the new fed-
ederal E c o n o m i c Opportun-
ity Grants. Undergraduates dem-
onstrating exceptional linanciai
need may be provided with $200
to $800 from government re«
sources, while the college con-
tribute: an equal matching sti-
pend. As future entering alas
ties are brought under this plan,
its value should increase.

Analysis

l Siildelit ii

A similar beneiit will accrue
from Slate of lowa Scholar-
ships, which presently provide
$20,000 at llnancial aid. Thell‘ a-
vailability to incoming resident
freshmen offer further opportun-
ities ior study at Grinnell.

Many Students in the middle
or upper-middle income levels
are taking advantage at a new
U. 5. government sponsored pro-
gram: the guaranteed loan. Ne-
gotiated through a private bank
or lending agency, the loan is
underwritten by a state or non-
prollt agency. The government
pays up to 6 percent interest
while the borrower is in col-
lege, lowering interest to 3 per-
cent alter graduation (ior remi—
lies With incomes under $15,000).
Payments do not begin until nine
months alter completing one’s
education, and may on extended
up to ten years.

Having reviewed existing
channels oi aid, we may ask
what iuture directions assistance
planning should take in the
light oi its basic objectives.
Noting that in 1960, only 12 per
cent of Grinnell students were
(ml-n families with below-aver-
age income, Former President
Howard Bowen stated, “This I
regard as a weakness lrom the
standpoint oi diversity of the
student body. To correct this
weakness we need a substantial
sum each year to be used ex—
clusively to aid outstanding
young men and women from
low-income families. . . Such
students, when caretully select-
ad, would be a splendid scl-
dition to the student body."
The availability oi government
funds and such private donations
as the Rockefeller grants has
tor the time being provided an
adequate response.

But, should National Defense
Students Loans be lurtber re-
stricted, what alternatives could
be pursued? The answer may
lie in “lull-cost pricing”. As
described by Dr. Bowen, full-
cost pricing “would provide, in
street, that lsmiiies pay what
they can reasonably afford tor
the education of their children
up to the limit oi the lull cost,
and that educational subsidies
derived from taxes and philan-
thropy be devoted exclusively
to aiding those students who
cannot afford the lull cost."

In a similar context, Bowen
proposed to “increase substan-
tially the funds tor low-income
students by increasing the prlr
portion of lull paying students
and reducing the proportion of
middle-income brackets who re-
ceive ﬁnancial aid. The money
thus saved could be diverted to
the lowest-income group."

While Bowen considered the
complete adoption or this pro-
posal to be impractical in 1960,
he clearly considered it as A
possible future method to main-
tain on open community. Now
may be a iruitiul time for the
college to review this suggestion.
Many factors must be weighed,
including the chance for foun-
dation backing and the success
oi a similar plan at Banning-
ton.

It may be noted that by 1960.
student fees covered 70.4 pep
cent of full operating costs, as

Eii Note: Robert wolto, is

was a history major and a
member of the Air Force Rie-
serve 0 l t i c e r 3 Training

To Members of the Grinnell
College Academic Community:

For a number of years Grin-
nell College has extended to an
Air Force R.0.T.C. detachment
the privileges normally re-
served tor academic depart-
ments. I believe these privileges
should be withdrawn for the
following reasons:

1)Tne Air Force is a govern-
ment agency whose members
are legally bound to carry out
its policies. These policies in»
clude statements about national
detense requirements with their
toreign and domestic political
implications, as particular (high-
ly favorable) View of Air Force
hie, as well as statements of
a moral nature concerning the
political uses or mass, organized
and olten indiscriminate vio«
lence. Reasonable men disagree
about all of these policies, and
siiould recognize the continuing
need for new and creative so-
lutions to a highly precarious
World situation. Yet the content
of Air Force instruction is not
the result of free inquiry by an
individual, but rather is dictated
by the institutional needs of the
Air Force. Should a local Air
Force instructor come to under-
standings dllterent lrom Air
Force policy, he would be my
moved and replaced, Therelore,
A.F.R.O.T.C. becomes a vehicle
for indoctrination insofar as pre-
viously determined goals are
sought in its classrooms.

and political questions which

Dean Richard Winter's reply
to Robert S. White's Criticism
or the AFROTC program at
Grinneii was that “i can live
with this institution (the AF
ROTC) because I have conti-
dence in the ability of the liberal
arts education to give alter-
native answers to the question
or war versus pence."

Disagreeing with Wolto’s con<
tention that the program on
Courages a onevslded view or
the issue, Winters claimed that
“We do have both viewpoints
at Grinneil, the AFROTC and
the liberal arts disciplines of
philosophy, humanities, religion
and the arts. I consider the
AFROTC a department of the
college, but I realize that there
are questions like Mr. Woito's.
This is not a new issue and
it is not yet resolved.”

The AFROTC program was
establishhed al Grinnell in 1951,
and until 1954, freshmen were
required to take part in the
program, Although Winters was
unable to say why
originally began the program,
he did suggest that the com<
blnation DI the low birth rate
of the depression years and the
advent of the Korean War re-
sulted in a general shortage oi
college students during the ear—
ly 1950's, 50 Grinnell used the
AFROTC to attract male Stu-
dents. “For many colleges or
this era. the program was a
salvation," he explained

Winters added that the col»
lege annually turns out many
more Peace Corps volunteers
than it does officer candidates.
“We have a Peace Corps repre-
sentative on campus as well as
the AFROTC representatives.
Whatever organizations our stu<
dents are interested in, we try
to bring them here.“

He went on to say, however.
that “The numbers we‘re at

General Military Course in the
freshman and sophomore years.
This course has as its focus an
examination of the scope of
world military systems and
their role in Conliict and rela-
tions among nations.

The Professional 0 t l i c e r
Course in the last two years or
the program, is ottered ior both

States; the mission and organi-
zation oi the Department of De
tense; and the Concepts, doi‘r
trine, and employment oi the
Air Force to support national
policy. Tile course also discusses
astronautics, space operations,
and the future development at
aerospace power.

The final year of the Protesa
sioual Oliicer Course deals with
