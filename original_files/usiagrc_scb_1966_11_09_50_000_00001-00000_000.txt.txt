Senate Endorses Interim

By MARTHA BERKEY

Senior Bond Faulwell was
unanimously elected to fill the
resigned speakership of Dan
Bucks at the Senate meeting
Nov. 2, He was nominated by
SGA president Steve Kent and

ran unopposed. in a Statement
distributed to senators prior to

‘ the meeting. Kent cited Faul-

well’s "extensive experience in
student government as a mem-
ber of the Senate and as a
house president? in making his
formal nomination.

This year Faulwell has
served as a dlscussion leader
at Encampment, is a mem-
ber at the Senate Committee
on Academlc Life and has
participated in the planning
[or an interim sesslon at the
beginning or next semester.
After his election he told the
5&1? that he would be con-
cerned immediately primarily
with reviewing the Senate. He
said he (on that the ground
work for action had been laid
and now was the time In em
act ideas.

In the absence ot a speaker,
SGA president Steve Kent pre~
sided. He opened the meeting
with an address on the Senate
and its function in SGA in
which he expressed hope that
the Senate could “ideally" be
a place where student opinion
may be expressed. It would
deal with problems on an am-
bitious scale at the committee
level. He stated that at this
time the solution to problem
does not lie in the creation of
more committees, as the exist-
ing structure is already “awful-
ly ambitious." Kent called for
a “clear definition or objec-
tives" as the next step in com<
mittee runctioning, declaring
that “implementation is nine-
tenths of the battle once they
get an idea."

In other action Wednesday
night, the Senate unanimously
endorsed the proposed interim
session to precede the begin-
ning of second semester. Chair-
man Ric McDowell presented a
tentative outline schedule of

Bond Foulwell

four elective seminars, each of
which would meet three times,
plus tother types or discussions
and activities. The period would
run from Sunday, Jan. 8,
through Sunday, Jan. 15. This
would mean a return to cam-
pus three days early for par-
ticipating Students. Prior to
gaining the Senate‘s support,
the interim proposal had been
very favorably received by the
faculty.

chairman Chuck Wall presented
two proposals, one to raise the
SGA secretaries' salaries and
another concerning Senate sub-
sidy of Langan hall social funds.

$.Z5 to $1.00 an hour for the
seven secretaries employed by
SGA was unanimously accepted
after the defeat of an amend-
ment by senator Hank Balikov
to set the ﬁgure at $1.20 per
hour.
