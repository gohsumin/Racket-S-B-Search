Religious Liberals
Meet at K lausners'

“This is a ’liberal' campus only

six days or the week," stated pres- _

ident Barry Ancona, as he opened
the first meeting of the Grinneil
Religious Liberals. The organiza-
tion, formerly known as the Grin-
neli Unitarian Group, met Sunday
night at the home of Neal Klaus-
ner (philosophy).

Among the topics discussed at
the initial meeting, besides the
adoption of the new name, was
affiliation With such liberal relig-
ious organizations as the Student
Religious Liberals (Unitarian), the
American Friends Service Com-
mittee, and the American Human-
ists Society.

Dedicating themselves to a
“quest for an open mind," mem-
bers of the group launched the
year's activities With a discussion
of liberalism. Interested students
are invited to attend the next
meeting of the GRL, to be held
at 7 pm, Sunday, Oct, 10, at the
home of Klausnet.

Religion Department
Plans Junior comps

This November will bring some-
thing new to Grinncll besides the.
traditional SAGA turkey and soga
gy dressing. The philosophy and
religion department is introducing
a junior otai exam for its majors.

The purpose of this innovation
is three-fold: give the students
practice for the senior oral comp
(during which one student used
“you know” forty times), acquaint
professors with the new majors,
and diagnose the student’s weak
points.

The junior orais will utilize the
same type of question as the sen-
ior but “will not presuppose a de-
tailed acquaintance and will be
based reallsticaily on work the
student has taken," according to
Howard Burkle, department chair-
man. .

 

SGA Body Again Becomes Senate.
Discusses Hall life. Slum Project

The old organization that was
called the Grinneil Student Senate
—which reorganized last year and
called itself the Advisory Council—
is now the Grinnell Student Senate
—again.

This action came at Wednesday
night’s meeting of the Student

The Senate accepted the com-
mittee recommendation and do
ieated the proposal 17-3. in de-
feating the proposal, various sen-
ators agreed with president Jerry

Goddard when he said that the
grant would be “precedent setting.

 

FIRST THE STUDENT SENATE than the Advisory Council
and now the Student Senate again by unanimoul vote last

Wednesday.

Senate-Advisory Council. The vote
was unanimous.

Twn topics ior discussion cun<
sumed most of the Senate’s time:
the so—called Des Moines project
and the hall system.

Grinneil students interested in a
slum project on the west Side of
Des Molnes met with the ﬁnance
committee and asked the commit-
tee iur fifty dollars a month. The
primary use of the money, the
committee reported, would have
been for the support of Billy King,
a Students for a Democratic So-
ciety worker living in Des Moines
and organizing the project.

We have never subsidized a non-
campus political activity." The
Des Moines project fell into the
category of “political activity"
when it was learned that King
plans to take part in city council
election campaigning.

The hall system discussion came
up as a result of an encampment
report and follow-up coiteehour.
The discussion ot possible chang-
es in the hall system never got
all the ground because the Sena
tors were not so sure that there
is anything wrong With the hall
system as it stands.

the World UniverSlty S e r V i G 3
(WUS) auction, dance and carnia
val at 8 pm. tomorrow. The an-
nual event will be held in the
North Lounge of the Forum.

A dance with Dick Bailey’s hand

the traditional jail, and a car
wrecking sponsored by the Grin-
nell AFROTC will be among the
evening’s activities.

The main attraction, however.
is the auction. it Will start at ll).
Dick Seers, a professional auc-
tioneer, will conduct the sale of
parties, orgies. stunts, dinners and
other miscellanea to the highest
bidder. Various students and or.
ganizatinns have offered a variety
of items for auction.

the World University Service to
assist foreign students in quest of

tact with Ahmednager College in
india is one of the activities car-
ried on by WUS.

’Exc‘ ed’ Particles
Interest Chemists

Intramolecular photosensitizan
tion was the topic under discus
sion at a meeting of the Grinneil
student-atfiliate chapter of the A-
merican Chemical Society Tues-
day evening.

Dr. Harry Morrison of Purdue
University explored this area of
organic and physical chemistry
with about 30 students and facul-
ty. The topic was complex, and
when the title was ilnally ex-
plained, Dr. Morrison pointed out
that he had spent forty-five min-
utes in the process.

Brieﬂy, he pointed out that light
can be directed at molecules in
such a manner and at such fre-
quencles that the energy level of
the system changes from a normal
“ground" state to one oi several
“excited” states.

The organic chemist usually
deals with material in its ground
state and tinds that completely
new characteristics — reactants,
conditions, mechanisms and prod-
ucts — are available when light-
excited components are used.

Dr. Morrison hadn’t heard at
any particularly practical applica<
tions of this phenomenon but this
is perhaps one of the charming
features of such discussions—41in
potential is unlimited.
