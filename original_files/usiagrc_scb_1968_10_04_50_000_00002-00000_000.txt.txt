When the weekend of Sept. .‘M

Affairs on Friday, Sept. 20 and
took eiicct immediately.

in a telephone interview Dean
of Student Affairs Stuart Gucci
said that the students had want-
ed a conirontation. However,
when the Student Council acted
in accordance ‘With established
procedure the following week,
tl-ie'administration was receptive
lo the changes. “We didn’t have
a confrontation, .we didn’t shot:
them out. We asked them toga
through Channels, which they
-did the following w ,” stated
The dean.

in the spring or 1967 students
made a proposal to have open
dorms. At Cornell there had
never been open dorms in the
Grinnell sense [if the term.
Twice during the year there
were “npen houses," during
which time the dorms were open
to members oi the opposite sex.

This 1967'pmpcsal was turned
own by the college’s admin-
istration. An appeal was made
to President Stump oi Cornell,
who was agreeable to the rules
change, and in January, 1968, as
an extension AM the .annual
'lupen houses" program, a new
policy took place. This was a
,policy or alteniating open dorms;
i.e., one Sunday alternoon the
girls‘ dormitories would be open,
the next Sunday atternoon the
boys’ dormitories would be open.

There are paid proctors in
the Cornell dormitories, llul, ac-
cording tr) 2: member of tile elli-
t tail ill The Ci): liian, the
student ncwspuper, these prone
tors do not have the charge or
enlorclng the rules on open
dorms; rather, they are paid
to see that qulel hours are ob-
served.

on the broadcasting personnel
'are mainly on personal insults
'and slander. Cloud points out
that instances «of slander 'are

When .asked whnt the thread-

the conflict concerned, he said
that they were :editol'ial com—

"The primary responslhility

:must vprtwlde the audience
with entertainment, education,
and intellectual stimulation
while providing education and
entertainment tor the stall."
Cloud stated that since KDIC
is a new venture, its pleCE<
dents must be established now.
The policy decision was made
by the executive stall or the
radio station, which agreed
unanimously.

As personnel director, Sae-
ger was in charge or the
station's d.j.’s. Since Al Cloud
takes direct responsibility tor
radio broadcasts, Sacger relt
that .a maior conﬂict between
he and Cloud would‘be detri-

line no parents had objected to

The change in rules was
brought about by a long series
of meetings which took place
during the summer. Beloit-Col»

Paid Fractals

At Beloit, students serve as
"staff assistants". They are
paid to act as advisers 'to stu—
dents, but also 10 ‘e'nl'orce rules,
such as the rules on open
dorms. There .are rain head res

in the past, .a student caught
with a member of the opposite
sex in his room when-opentdorm
hours were not in eltect was
brought before an allrstudent
judicial board. For the ﬁrst
niiense the punishment has been
is warning, tor the second or-
iense, which has never loc-
curred, the punishment would
be social probation.

Visitation .relorms were pre-
ceded by a liberalization trend
which included .the abolishment
of hours for 'second term wo-
men .and the approval to! 3 'Co«

Belolt’s President Upton urged
the Board at Trustees to pass
the new ruling on open visita-
tion.

As long as students have an
option, Dean Gwin believes the
rule change is sound.

Opposition to the open dorms
is expected to come from the
women. Cris Ring, ’69, said,
"There are some girls who just
ieel tunny running around in a
robe anti hair curlers when boys
are on the ilour. They feel like
they’re losing part or their lem-
ininity."

The ‘Senate discussed the

statement read, “The Senate
believes that this case drama-

We furthermore ”feel that this
