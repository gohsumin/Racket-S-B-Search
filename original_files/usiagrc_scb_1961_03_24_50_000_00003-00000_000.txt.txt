satisfactory image of the college,"
Prescott said. “Three ofthe Kanri

"At a special dinner prior to
our appearance, we were able
to talk about many things con-
cerning the program in New
York. We are, consequently,
looking hopefully forward to
the appearance," said Prescott.

“It would not be quite right to
say Grinnell ’won’ in Lawrence,"
Prescott said, "because it was a
practice session it was of great
value to the Grinnell students lili
their preparation. The score
fluctuated considerably, At the
end of the session, which used 50
toss-up and corresponding bonus
questions, the scoreboard showed
Grinnell at 530 and K1]. at 495."
