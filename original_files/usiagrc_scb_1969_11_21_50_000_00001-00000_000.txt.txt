complete Text of Leggett’s
State of the College Speech

(At last Monday’s faculty meeting President Glenn Leg-
gett delivered an address on what he called “the state of the
college.” The complete text of his remarks is published below.)

I want to talk with you about the state of the College as I see
it. This means I will be talking about some of our problems—fi-
nancial, educational, and psychological, I may spread some gloom
and probably some resentment, but here and there there may be
a glimmer of hope and good nature.

All colleges are in trouble. The better colleges are in more
trouble than the others, chiefly because their expectationsare
higher and thus harder to realize and more expensive, partly
because it is the nature of a superior faculty and student body to
invite trouble more efficiently than the nature of a second-rate
faculty and student body. But the fact that we have partners in
trouble is cold comfort for us here in Grinnell. This is where we
live; this is the environment that works on our personal and pro-
fessional nerveendings; this is where our problems have to be
solved.

You already have some information about our financial prob-
lems, On September 26, I sent you my interpretation of the trus-
tees’ meeting of September 17, in which the trustees posed certain
questions for study by the faculty. These questions, all inter-re-
lated, concerned the financial ramifications of different student-
faculty ratios, of the relationship of the comprehensive student fee
to the actual cost of a student's education, of an increase in en-
rollment, and of a cutback in administrative services. Deans Wall
and Walker, with the assistance of Professor Voertman of econ-
omics and Professor Mullins of Mathematics have already begun
to develop the necessary models of analysis for such studies; and
my understanding is that the computer will shortly be bringing
forth the data which will help us form our recommendations to
the trustees at their June, 197D,_ meeting. Though analysis and stu-
dy will not resolve our financial problems, they will at least define
them more accurately than ever before. In the meantime, our
development people and appropriate staff and faculty persons are
hard at work devising more and better stratagems for raising
funds. The effort is CrucialI for like all colleges, we face the fact
of an increasing discrepancy between our ability to spend money
and our ability to find it. Luckily, we have, because of our en-
dowment and the nature of our trustees, more resilency than most
colleges, We should appreciate this circumstance, so long as we
realize that the oratory of austerity as practiced by Dean Walker
has a necessary accuracy about it. If you have resentments about
this hard fact. take them out not on Dean Walker, but rather on
the fact of national inflation, on a federal government which can-
not decide what its obligations are, and on a war that is chewing
up both bodies and minds and is dangerously close to making
psychopaths of us all.

The problem of simple educational sanity, let alone educational
direction and leadership, in such an unhappy climate, is almost
beyond description. Faculty are jittery or self-righteous; students
are bewildered or angry; parents are confused or outraged; alumni
are indignant or puzzled. Trustees wonder why they bothered in the
first place. Presidents and deans, who by nature like to begin
each morning with a semblance of orderly purpose and a minor
flexing of executive muscles, discover every day that once again
there is time only to strategize about emergencies and time only
to devote their weary muscles to the unhappy routine of academic
stable-keeping. l overstate the circumstances, by about one per—
cent. We cannot do much about resolving this national agony, and
we cannot avoid being profoundly affected by it. But we can make
a better effort than we have to bring a measure of sanity into our
own operation.

How do we start such an effort? We start by defining our pri-
orities, then move to describing the obligations that are attached
to these priorities, and then to parceling out our time and energy
accordingly. The first priority of this institution is to offer superior
undergraduate education. Superior undergraduate education is not
primarily a matter of curricular manipulation; it is mostly a mat-
ter of superior faculty teaching superior students. This means that
our first energies need to go into the recruiting and retension of
superior faculty and into the searching out of superior high school
graduates and into keeping them working hard and constructively
after they get here. This process also implies the obligation to dis—
courage from remaining here those faculty and students who for
whatever reasons do not meet the standards we commit ourselves
to. A great deal of our energy is already going into this priority
of searching out and retaining good faculty and good students, and
quite successfully so. As yet not enough is going into the hard-

beaded application of the measuring-up process and the decisive

Five Hundred Dollar Theft
During Sweetwater Concert

By Mark Sableman

More than five hundred dol-
lars in clothes and cash was
stolen from the Darby dress-
ing room of the Sweetwater
band during their concert here
last Saturday.

Although the College social
committee is not legally bound
to pay for the loss, it expects
to make some kind of settle—
ment with Sweetwater "to in-
sure good relations," accord-
ing to Social Coordinator Jon
Stein.

The incident illustrates the
growing amount of larceny on
campus, and the related prob—
lem of security at concerts and
dances.

There was actually more
security at the dance Saturday
than was required under the
contract w i t h Sweetwater,
since one Grinnell auxiliary po-
liceman was hired to watch
the dressing room area.

There were also the normal
two policemen outside Darby
to keep “outsiders” out of the
dance.

Nevertheless, in between the
rounds of the policeman in-
side, the dressing room was
broken into, and three leather
coats valued at $50 each, one
valued at $290, and $70 in cash
were taken.

The theft was reported to
Grinnell police, but they told
the 5&3 that they have no
leads as yet.

A number of people from
towns as far away as Cedar
Rapids and Newton were ob-
served at the dance, and some
suspect these outsiders pulled
off the theft.

Social coordinator Jon Stein
told the 5&3 that he recog-
nized more than twenty people
at the concert as definitely
college students or

Stein also mentioned that, be-
fore the Sweetwater concert,
he had seen three of these
“outsiders” using the tele-
phone in the dressing room. He
told them to leave, since he
needed to use the phone to call
Sweetwater in Des Moines.
Sometime after Stein had made
his telephone call and left, the
phone was taken from the
dressing room,

(Later that evening, four
boys from Newton were picked
up by police and charged with
disturbing the peace, and ille-
gal possession of beer. When
the police picked them up, they
had the phone from Darby in
their possession, They were

Police reported Wednesday
that they did not seek prior
adjudication that the material
was obscene before they made
the arrests. “It was obscene be-
cause it showed a naked man,"
Sgt. Peterson of the Cedar Falls
police told the 5&3.

Last year, state agents were
ordered to return allegedly
obscene Plero material that
they had seized at a Wilton
Junction printing shop. A dis
trict court judge ruled that the
seizure was illegal because
there had been no prior adjudi-
cation that the material was ob-
scene. A Pterodactyl suit a-

Richard Turner and other
agents involved in the seizure
is still pending in the 8th US,

BULLETIN—Thursday moms
ing, the hearing for the four
Vendors arrested in Cedar Falls
was postponed until next Mon-
day upon the request of their
attorney, Clark Holmes of Des
Molnes.

Ptero staff member Henry
Wilhelm said that numerous re—
tail outlets have stopped se
ing the latest issue, although it '
is Still being circulated on cam-
pus.

David Danforth, a clerk at the
Varsity Newstand in Grinnell,
said that he stopped selling
Ptero “because of what hap-
pened in Cedar Falls." Danforth
also said that he was Visited by
law enforcement officials Thurs—
day morning regarding Ptero,
but would make no further com-
ment.
