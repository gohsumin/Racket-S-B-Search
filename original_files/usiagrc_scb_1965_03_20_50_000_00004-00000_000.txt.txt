tlecently two students were

Weavor. The social coordi-
nating committee gave its l'ir
ncial support to the “Faces
Mexico” photographic ox-
'bit. Beyond that point, how-
er, instead of encourage-
ent, the photographers in-
, lved encountered obstacles
at every turn.

In order to exhibit their pic-
tures in an integral form, negtr
tiations had to be made with
the Forum director. Settlement
was finally reached, but unfor-
tunately, it left antagonism on
both sides. Once up, the exhibv
it, has been enjoyed by students
and faculty alike. From the be-
ginning, however, its effective—
ness has been marred by the
hanging of posters underneath.
This, in itself. might be toler-
ated. But after two weeks
(even though the exhibit was
designated by the social calen-
dar for the entire month), the
bullfight sequence—ﬂan integral
part at the exhibit—was re-
moved, thus destroying all ar-
tistic wholeness of the exhibit.

The decision was made to
place the poster—which could
easily have been hung else»

where—at the expense of the
exhibit: without permission of
the photographers or the social
coordinating committee. We
feel that this action, typical in
its arbitrariness, wail unjusti-
fied and provocative at the very
least, We protest it.

As Grinnell students we are
often criticized for our appar-
ent unwillingness to rise above
mediocrity. Mediocrity will conv
tinue when efforts to shine are
almost inevitably thwarted, We
are disappointed at such seem-
ing ambivalence toward stu-
dent creativity. Rather than an
attitude or contining attempts
at creativity. we would like to
see originality watched and en-
couraged joyously and with
pride. Therefore, a re-evalua-
tion is called for to bring pol-
icy to a level consistent with
what the college stands for.

To Most Everyone

To the Editori

After careful reading of the
SH! 0! the past lew weeks i
feel the need to make a remark

01' two before the contributors
to the “Letters to the Editor"
column lose all sense of pro-
portion.

First or all, with regard to
Herzog’e opinion of student
government, perhaps some of
the purposes of our time spent
in college should be re-stated.
The process of obtaining an ed-
ucation is basically an egotisti-
cal affair. Part of this process,
for those with galloping cases
or self-importance, involves
playing around in student poli-
tics. Fortunately, most stu-
dents are apathetic to student
politics and do not interlere
with the game. There is no
point in taking the game away
from those who wish to play it,
No one Advocates the removal
of games which other students
engage in.

Since the obtaining of a col-
lege diploma is a basic qualiti-
cation to .be fulfilled before one
canﬁo anything useful in life,
students should do whatever
they wish to make their Shel»
tered environment more inter-
esting. This probably includes
thmwing snowballs through
windows (in answer to Mr.
Kurasch) or writing letters to
the newspaper with the pur—
pose of stirring up the sensitive
emotions of various people (in
answer to Mr. Cleaver). There
may be limits which should be
applied to some of the games
students engage in, but I won-
der what they are.

Perhaps we would all he bet-
ter off if We went back to our
copies of Palmer, Samuelson,
etc., and didn't bother With
these games. However, we
would probably soon become
cases for our inadequate coun-
selling services.

To the Editors

While sitting in the Forum
recently, i happened to even
hear two professors discussin‘
the merits or inter-collegiate
athletics. Both believed that
the administration and silk
dents were placing too much
emphasis upon such an unre-
warding endeavor, and that
the college could use the fund:
for higher or nobler purposes
while students could use the
time for intellectual pursuits.

This conversation exempli-
fies the attitude of many on the
Grinnell campus. One can see

that the number of students in-
terested and dedicated enough
to engage in inter-collegiate
athletics has been on the down-
swing during the past iew ren-
sons. '

John Piitsch, head basketball
and assistant football coach,
defines the problem, “It's not

only that the number of stu-
dents out for inter-collegiate
sports has declined over the
last two years. Perhaps more
serious than this is the fact
that those who are out to com-
pete, generally speaking, have
lost their competitiveness and
devotion. Their aim seems to
be to stay on the squad, in—
stead of to help the squad
win.”

This letter is designed to
serve as a reminder of the
values of athletic pal‘ticipa‘
tion. This participation should
be strongly encouraged in an
environment like ours. The ac-
tivity itselt offers a pleasant
change of pace to a life 0:
solid studying, the physical ex-
ertion offers a chance to rid
Oneself of natural aggressions
and emotions, and also it en-
ables one to meet others out-
side of one’s hall who are de-
voted to an identical aim.

The case Should not be over-
Stated nor the benefits of ath-
letics over-emphasized. Grin-
nell makes the facilities avail-
able, but unfortunately they
are being ignored by many
who could gain immensely.
More participants, not spec,
tutors, more people to join the
athletics and not to watch
them, should be encouraged by
a proper atmosphere.
