To the Editor:

We are shocked and appalled
to discover on South Campus or
cycle racks in which male and fe
male hicyclos spend the cntlre
winter together. side by side. it
is frightening to realize that tllls

which. besides resulting in an un-
healthy intimacy, could result in
a number or tricyclcs blocking
traffic in the laughs

Grappiers Drop Heuribreuker
After Splitting Weekend Bill

The Pioneer grapplers came
within a shade or defeating Cor-
nell Wednesday night when Ray
Mendel, normally a 152 pounder,
just missed pinning his opponent in
the heavyweight division. The win
that Ray picked up left the Pio-
neers one short of Cornell 20-19.
The Pioneers actually won one
more match than the Rams. but
two Cornell pins gave them the
victory. Others besides Mendel to
win were hill Barnes, Ken Strun—
ler, John Sharpe. and Bob Geller.
