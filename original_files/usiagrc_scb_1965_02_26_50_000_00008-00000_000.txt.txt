Pioneers Whip Kohawks But Drop
Saturday Game to the Buccaneers

l By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
avenged an earlier loss to (Joe on
Friday night with an overtime
victory but ran out of gas on Sat
urday and were trounced by Bel—
.lt. The Pioneers switched into a
[unrandrshoot oiferise which was
bhown by the 382 points that were
Icored over the weekend. Included
Were the 105 points Grinnell scored
against (Joe to break the school
Icoring mark of 102.

The Coe game was a wild affair
that included a goal tending
charge on Coe, two calls on the
Kohawks [or being in the lane too
soon on a free throw, and a pop-
burn-throwing Kuhawk tan. Coe

ell‘l the lead for the first six min-

tes until Ieit Frantz scored a

basket to give the Pioneers a laid
lead.

Later in a five minute stretch
‘Grinnell outscored' Coe 17-5 to take
g 3843 lead. For the rest of the

alt Coe could not get closer than
eight points and Grinnell eventuab
ly took a 5744 lead into the locker
room.

The Pioneers took their greatest

lead of sixteen points right after‘

the second half started. But Skip
lwan led a Coe rally that de-
creased Grinnell’s lead to three
goints, 6663, with 14:15 left. Swan
cored ten of the nineteen Kohawk
points while Grinnell could only
manage six points.

Grinnell held onto leads of two
to eight points until Coo tied the
ucorc 90% with four minutes left.
‘ big break came twelve seconds
ater when Skip Swan fouled out.
Meanwhile, Grinnell had taken a
33-90 lead. But the Pioneers could
not hold the lead and Larry Shry-

 

ock sent the game into overtime
with a basket with 22 seconds left.
The score alter regulation time
was 98-98.

in the overtime Rick Crawford
scored to give Coe a 100-98 lead
with 3:40 remaining. The Pioneers
retaliated with the next seven
points, though, to win the game
105-100. Elliott Hibbs got four of
the points while Jeti Ftantz added
the other three.

Jeli Frantz won the game's scor-
ing honors in a battle with Skip
Swan. Jeff made fourteen 01
eighteen shots from the floor and
thirteen of nineteen free throws in
scoring 41 points. Swan made four-
teen of twenty—one shots from the
flour and nine of ten free throws
in leading Coe with 37 points.
Other top scorers were Tum Hill

Larry Shryock with 21.

Frantz also led all rebounders by
hauling down l8. Hill added it) for
the Pioneers while Shryoek had 14
and Swan 11 for the Kohawks. Coe
as a team outrebounded Grinnell
4640.

The Beloit game is better for-
gotten than written about. The
Pioneers seemed dead on their feet,
and the 8qu rolled over them.
With Bob Rudolph and Phil Wool-
ley dominating the boards, the
Bucs soared to a 57-33 half-time
lead when many smart fans left.

The Bucs continued the ram-
page in the second half as coach
Pfitsch desperately rotated his
players looking for some type of a
winning combination. The 3qu
took their biggest lead at 33 points
89-56 with eight minutes left. They
finally took a 99-78 win over the
hapless Pioneers.

A DIALOGUE
Time: Anachronistic

Place: The Grimnell College
campus

Prof. Apathy smarts;
doest thou?

Duard Kawtindeact: Without.

Smarts: Prithee. Why art thou
in the stocks? Hast thou
mouseth in yon South Room
of the Castle?

Duard: Nay, Sire. A vile fate
hath descendeth upon me. A
fortnight ago an lM bailbas—
ket game did I engage in,
which rather late starteth, as
does: run the usual course of
things. Hustle did I my arst
to the drawbridge, whereup<
on to my dismay and misfor<
tune, the knights in gray did
raise the drawbridge high be-
fore me, as it was past knaves
hours. Being of quick wit and
agile mind, I swammed
stealthily and silently across
the moat and called upward to
my room window, whereupon
the night watchdog grabbeth
me and escorteth me bodily
to yonder Main Gate, You
mayest see what insidious
punishment hath befailen me.
I were condemned to these
stocks for seven days.

Smarts: Woe is you! Definite-
ly art thou in a tragic plight,
but with some justification.
Who condemnest thou?

Duard: Ye Old Roundtablc on
Student Affairs. It were they
by which this dirty deed were
done.

Smarts: What is this madness?
Is this atrocity of rights to be

How

 

defined as the due process of
fairplay? Is there, in this
world, no justice? What is
the normal course for deeds
considered of such a nefari-
ous nature as yours?

Duard: The normal Course,
sire, though somewhat less
than wellrdefined, would seem
to lead to the Knaves Pri-
mary Court, but the Chief
lady-inrwaiting deemed it
otherwise. We are irrespom
sible and immature, lest you
forgetteth.

Smarts: Tell me, Knavo Duard,
how be it otherwise?

Duard: Without.

Smarts: Thou appearest of good
physical stature. How be the
I. M. program? The referees,
receive they still the same
niggardly compensation, a
measly half dollar? Does Sire
Fill and his Board still labor
and grunt in contemplation of
The Clinic for Better Officiat-
ing?

Duard: Well spoken, on the first
count, sire. Yes, an actuality
has the clinic become, Start
will it this summer, and fine
time.

Smarts: Mayhaps the tide of
good fortune shall come in
the spring.

Duard: Bad herbs, sire. No
spring is there to be. Can-
celled, has it been, by the
wicked witch of the South.

Pioneer Frosh Hoopsters Lose Game;
Able, Musser, Schwartz High Scorers

By Don Kurasch

Cornell easily rolled by Grin-
nell last Tuesday night in Dar-
by, out, in a frosh basketball
game that turned out to be
about as exciting as the read«
ing of the Student Senate min-
utes at a house meeting. with
a little more than 39 minutes
left to play in the game, Cor-
nell went ahead 270, after which
the Grinnell yearlings were
never able to catch up.

Everyone on Coach Barry M.
Anderson's bench was able to
get in on the iree-for-all, with
center Roger Able pacing the
Pioneers with 18 points. Nears
1y every other member of the
squad contributed to the scor-
ing, with Mike Schwartz and
Dick Musser each tallying 13,
Greg Rankin connecting for a
season low of 9, Jim Poison hit-

ting for 1, Ron Cogswell adding
6, and Dave Donahoe and Don
Southworth coming through
with 3 and 4 respectively. Also
in the game for the Pioneers
was guard Russ Heukendcrf,
who was able to tally several
fouls,

two swimming powers, collide

tomorrow.

“Dilly," a wooden decoy, an-
nually goes to the loop team
boasting the best dual meet recs
0rd.

Both teams'bring undefeated
records into the meet and I
harvest of new pool and school
regards appears likely. Grinnell
has brushed aside eight or
ponents with ease and the
Rams have Whipped seven foes
by equally large margins.

Coach Irv Simone plans to
stick with his regular Pioneer
lineup:

Ray Langham. Bill Lontz, and
Howard Schein, sprints; Ralph
Pray, Bill Batschelet, and
Langham, distance; Ken Adel-
man and Eric Jacobson, butter-
fly; Tony Horton and Charley
s c h n ell, backstroke; John
Kraai and John Ehrig, breast
stroke; Kraai and Schnell, in
dividual medley; and Richard
Lance and Roger Abendroth,
diving

Adelman, Horton, and Kraaf
are all unbeaten in their spe-
cialties. They also swim on the
all-winning 400~yard medley-
foursome.

Pray has been topped only
once in the SOC-yard freestyle.

Cornell boasts a balanced
squad that has claimed a host
of new marks. Among the Ram
leaders are sprinter George
Waltman, distanceman Tom
Steinberg and butterfiyer Phil
Gibbs, all of whom havo‘
claimed new school standards.

The Ram medley and.free<
style foursomes have also
turned in record breaking ef<
forts. -

Action is also planned be-
tween the Pioneer and Ram
freshman swimmers.

Track Meet Thursday

The trackmen of Grinnell will
travel to Cedar Rapids on
Thursday to face Cue in their
initial dual meet of the indoor
season.

Field events will begin at
3:30 p.m.; running events at
4 00 p.m.

 

hustle on the part of the Pio~
neers, allowing the Cornell
frosh to tally their first win of,
the year, there were several,
individual performances worth
mentioning. Forward Rankin
displayed some good moves,
effectively shaking the men on,
him, Schwartz had a nice touch
on offense, though, like the rest
of the team, showed little‘
hustle on defense. Musser and
Able seem to have the poten».
tial to be valuable additions to
the varsity squad next year.
