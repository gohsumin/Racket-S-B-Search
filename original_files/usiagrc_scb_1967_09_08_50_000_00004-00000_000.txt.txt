A STUDENT OPINION

STUDENT-RATED FACULTIES

By BOB SWORTWOOD

The issue of a student-rated faculty is an important one.
Student rating is a means by which all students can cooperate
to improve the college. it allows a middle ground tor construc-
tive critiCism. New, when Grinnell students aren’t rebelling
against the Establishment, they’re ignoring it. systematically
compiled student opinions on teachers and courses might stimu-
late greater undergraduate interest in the school, and improve
the quality or a Grinneil education.

Right now there is no really good method to measure the
quality or teaching at Grinneii. A new student setting up his
schedule has only two sources irom which to judge. First, he can

look up iaculty degrees, alma maters and publication records in
various school journals, all or which tiequently mean nothing as
tar as teaching ability is concerned. Second, he can ask somebody
else. Since iaculty members understandably reiuse to evaluate
their peers in iront ot undergraduates, students usually end up
polling each other. This is potentially more successiul, because
most Older Grinnell Students have an idea of who is good or bad.
The probem is that many upperclassmen are unable to back up
their evaluations, When asked for his opinion the typical upper-
ciassmall turns rUmDi'vanger‘ concerning professors outside of
his direct contact. He cites anecdotes irom the campus grapevine
which are oiten passed around more ior their humor than their
validity. When occasionally a dose or grudge nursing or personal
bias is thrown in, the freshman is better Off knowing nothing at
Elli

The solution might already have been found at schools
such as Harvard and Berkeley. Students publish their own guides
to Courses and teachers. Publications are based on question
naires filled out contidentially during the previous semester in
each of the courses listed. The answers are then evaluated and
tabulated at Berkeley, by graduate students in the respective tle-
partments, and at Harvard by the editors oi “Tile Crimsun.” Thus,
the comments DI one or two soured students do not color a com~
posile picture,

Most important, however, is the value or such a system for
orderly student criticism. There is no reason why students may
not bring to public attention the proiessor so ill-prepared he con»
stantly brushes oli questions, the protessor who never hands back
tests or papers, or the one whu year atter year reads his lecture
notes In a mumbling monotone. Conversely, why not applaud the
good teacher and explain the nature oi his contributions?

Although student opinion is oiten held in disrepute as unthink»
ing extremism, there is in fact no reason to believe the student
cannot be a iatrminded judge. Further, when he passes rumors
outside or class he is judging. When one section oi a course over-
ilows, and another is barren. this evinces a student Judgment.
Therefore, since such evaluations are being made, why not make
explicit the reasons ior them in a student pamphlet such as Hap
vard’s “Conﬁdential Guide ID Courses?” Hopeiully, teaching at
Grinnetl might improve.
