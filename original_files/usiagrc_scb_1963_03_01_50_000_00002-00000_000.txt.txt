BUSIVESS 'MAMK‘ Glinllell this need is no less great than

anywhere else, the special natures or its pressures
in tact place a stronger emphasis upon the ire-
quent necessity to step outside for a breath oi
fresh air,

At p- -ent. under llle intluence or grueling
studies. he ient exams. emotional crises. asser-
tive author es and general gossip. the average
student finds himselt otten in need or an outlet.
or these there are oi course many. howsoever
hr “Home“ prohibited they may be. The problem is not that
ta student usually feels lost in a social waste—
lland; i ~ more that the awarcness ot constant
:supervision seems always to inﬂict itsell upon

iany relaxation one might seek.
