'Herzog's Lust Sland'

Ed. Note: Thu iollowing is or
cei'pled irom a speech Jim
i-lerzog delivered to the student
Senate on Feb. 24.

For the past two and a halt
years, i have been distressed by
the direction and attitudes of
this college regarding sociarrulcs.
My actions and reactions in re-
lponse to these rules have been
essentially negative. 1 have_ op»
posed specific rules and actions,
and even opposed the overall phil-
osophy which has brought the rules
Ind actions.

My design {or a college is an
ideal, and it is this ideal which
I have sought and still seek: a
fine educational institution which
does not attempt to impose a tight
curb on the intellectual and social
habits, desires and thoughts at
the students. _

I see a college which is es-
lentially without any social re-
strictions, other than the laws
which govern the outside world.
The, laws I would envision at n
‘college are laws against damage
and drunkeness; that is, laws
which prevent people from infring-
ing on the lives and rights at
others. . _

This grind design implies an
absence of rule! that inhibit er-
.Iollal freedom—rules that II ow

mother awn from mother. In a
college whit thinks and act! 13%
itlvely, 1 can see no Idn'linistn-
tor asking girls it they lrn‘preg-
nant, no administrator dismissing,
suspending or placing student: on
probation without due process, no
administrltor allowing resident: of
a college to ply for the depreci~
ation of college property out at
l “social" fund, no administrator
saying cars are evil when Henry
Ford long ago proved moiety
would accept them,

Uniertunately. many of the con-
trols, restrictions, and unnecessary
altitudes to which I object have
been manifested at Grinnell Col»
lege. Here we have rules which
prohibit everything train cottec
makers to motor vehicles. Each
rule has its own rationale, and
each is a tribute to the motherly
concern this college Ill! for its
Iludents.

My feeling is that the college
administration has been static, un-
yielding, and distrustful of stu-
dents during the past yelr. The
Student Sennte, the student courtl,
and the student executive officers
are but ineﬂectull voices in the
wilderness. The college administra-
tion has decided on Whit it Want!

The method! of the administrator!
are strong and harsh. The various
crises of this year sire morn ser-
ious than in past years, And yet,
Dean Thompson warned Lingan
Hall, “If you think you already

haven‘t seen anything yet,”

various student representatives, of-
ticcrs and executives have become
but pawns of a college which ap~
parently is singlermindedly head-
ing towards a more narrow, more
restricted community, This com
munity is unattractive to me,

During the past two years Grim
nell’s student government officers
have been disturbed and have
Ll'led to pomsy the crises beloro
students. The effort has been, for
the most part, in vain. The stile
dents have tallcd to see crises
and the general change in the
tenor of the community.

I would bid student government
to dissolve. This seems the only
powerlul weapon we have left. I
would bid the students to coniront
the administration as a cohesive
body which no longer recognizes
the rules imposed by the admin-
istration.

Let the halls regulate their own
lives, Let the student government
operate informally without alleg-
iance tn the deans. Let the dean
of women make her own bed-
cllecks every night. Let the deal"
police open dorms. If there is no
due recess, then let there be no
one liable to face the harsh author-
ity of the college administration.

Let us demonstrate clearly in
all that the phrases in the co lege
cltlloguc about tho tin: and inde-
pendent student government are
only empty sales phrnsu,

State Department Does Not Endorse
American Student Information Service

The American Student Informa-
tion Service (ASIS). an organiza~
tion claiming to locate American
students in jobs in Europe, has
been the subject of ”ma concern
recently on the part 0! the 11.8.
State Department.

The Collegiate Press Service in
a release dated Febrnury 26, 1965,
said that the State Department re<
fused to endorse the activities of
ASISl The A515, the release said,
has been the object at numerous
complaints by students.

Over a year ago the 5&3 car-
ried an ad {or the A515 and as a
result received a letter» from Drl
w. M. Hollander oi Davenport,
Iowau In his letter, Hollander said
that his daughter had considered
obtaining help from the ASIS.

Hollander, however, wrote a

friend of his, William Rivkill, U.S.
Ambassador to Luxembourg,
where ASIS has its headqunrlers.
Rlvkin said of A515 that “numer-
ous complaints have been brought
to the embassy's attention by stu-
dents. On several occasions the
embassy has attempted on behalf
of the students to discuss These
complaints with the directors or
ASIS, but has (ound them to be to-
tally uncooperative."

As a result or our embassy's re-
lations with ASIS, ambassador
Rivkin suggested writing to “walla
established, nonprofit, agencies
such as the Institute of Interna<
tional Education or the Experb
ment in International Living."

Since receiving Rivkin's letter,
