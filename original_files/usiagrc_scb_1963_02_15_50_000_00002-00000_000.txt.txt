Consequently, the hall cultivates an inconiest-
able tradition and a rigidity that demands the

lsm. It happens more often than not that the lil-
tentiolis ot the hall liidjuritv run contrarv to
those of the college at large, and more disheart-
ening. these intentions generally contrary to thc
purposes of the academic community.

Hence. the Grinnell men conceive that. their
hall stands as a sovereign unit quite apart from
the ci-iimeil Campus, They aic quite right A
great abyss extends down the center of Eighth
avenue separating the mcii's halls from the rest
of the campus, The hall on one side represents
an escape from the general academic life on the

tude can bc typliiied as a clicllcsthrowing, bridge—
kibltzing cxrstenee.

This aiiti-intclloetualism breeds an impropriety,
the filial product oi a ri icl tour—year system
This year we have been frequently reminded of
Us range of iiiipippricty extending from the
d tasteful buifooricry of piepping to the general
disregard for rules and regulations.

These three evils have been circulating within
the system for many years with recurring emv
phasls in seven year cycles. Because ihese_ei-ils
have been brought to the lorr- so periodically
within the system, i tcci their presence is some7
what 'cllim to the SVSlem.

Therefore, 1 ask the Griiiiieli man who is
capable or extricating himseli tmpomrily from
this situation to consider seriously the oossihir
ity of replacing the four—year hall system.

Would this move to abolish bc a panacea for
our ills? No This change in structure would not
datc the ideals of a highly respected Grinnell
important the change would more fully Emmi-nos
radically alter the face of the campus. but most
college community. The fotu'ryezir system is an
anachronism in cur’progressive college life, and
now it is time tD l‘eluvenate lhc system so that
the residence halls can be integrated into the
entire Campus program.
