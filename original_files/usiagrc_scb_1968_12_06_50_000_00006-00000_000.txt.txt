This week, I have turned the
column over to the talents of
Steve Mannheimer, tho boy

ing, {or the first time, in a
somewhat serious manner.

'Aiter West passed, South re-
sponded one no trump, East

North, nervously examining his
cards, jumped to 4 NT, asking
for aces. Scum responded 5
diamonds indicating one ace
North then went to 6 NT, draw-
ing a gasp and a look of total
bewilderment from his partner.

troduction to the proposal, the
Executive Council says that it
assumes in its ideas that “jun-
ior and senior majors in the
respective departments have
reached a stage of develop-
ment analogus to what might
be called ‘apprentice,’ and are
capable of substantial contribu-

East’s opening lead was a
heart, taken in South‘s hand
with the king South promptly
led a small diamond to dum-
my, covering West‘s lack with
the queen. Although South knew
that West held the king and
that there were only two dia<
monda out, he led the 10 from
the board, falling to the single-
ton king. West burst into laugh<
ter and led a spade, knocking
out the singleton king on the
board. South returned a low
diamond to the 9 in his hand,
He then played the ace or
spades and sluiiing the 10 at
clubs from dummy. A small
heart to the board's ace was
followed by another heart lead,
pulling all the hearts, South
then claimed the remaining
tricks with good diamonds,
heart, and the ace at clubs.

When asked wily he had
played the 10 of diamonds in-
stead ot the ace, which would
have dropped the king, South
explained that losing to the
king was the only way to as-
sure the contract, It the ace
was played and the king didn't
fall, another diamond lead
would have pulled the last dia-
mond from South's hand. This
entrance was necessary ior
South to take his spade ace
and stuff the small club.
