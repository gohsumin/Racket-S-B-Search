Craig Allin

in his opening remarks,
Craig Allin expressed a
“strong belief in the right of
the individual to participate as
much as pussible in the shap-
ing of his own Life.” Since cxs
isting regulations do not ac-
curately reflect student norms,
he feels that many students
have ignored even necessary
controls. Allin maintained that
rule structures which assume
student irresponsibility are
likely to elicit that response

The implementation of
these ideas, Allin says, require

Ray Horn suggests that “stu-
dents can influence — but not
direct — the molding of a
campus community" Slow de-
liberation is a frustrating
method, Horn asserts, but
it has proven successful.
Among its achievements are
the success of interim and the
liberalization of women’s
hours.

The means of further prog-
ress, Horn suggests, lie in co-
operation and communication
since strident leadership
changes frequently, a tradition
of constructive common effort
must be established. This work
may best proceed when dia-
