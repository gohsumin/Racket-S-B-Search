A STUDENT OPINION

WHO IS THE

By ROGER BARNES
The present complaint at your
local revolutionary students is
the hypocrisy with the admit»
istrationl, “Grinnell is controlled

by s pack at incompetent.
hypocritical schmucksl"

incompetent, quits: possibly,
but hypocritical? Never!

Here's the deal: The hypo<
write is the student.

Exemplel The revolutionist In
presently fighting for open
dorms to increase mental and
physical communication be-
tween men and women, We
shall, tor the time being, dis-
regard the mental aspects oi
this situation, His proposal is
open dorms from noon to mid-
night.

There are two alternatives
{or the administration. It can
disapprove, in which case the
student becomes vulnerable be-
cause of the awareness created
by such a proposal. Consequent-
1y. all violations would be dealt
with harshly.

The administration, however,
can accept the proposal and
police the dorms imm midnight
to noon to apprehend violators.
what this means, however, is
not the addition or twelve more
hours per day for "communi-

battle is a futile one.

Behind this com ourtsln
which isolates Grinnell from
reality, there are no llmitl
placed upon the activities oi
sl student. I must admit. how-
ever, lhat discretion. i.o., s.
crecy, is imperative.

The “loophole" was invented
by and tor the Grinnell student,
and should be utilized. Revo-
lution, in the area oi physical
communication, is just a means
or exposure, and consequent
loss DI freedom.

Another bit of student hypo.
crlsy that is evident deals with
illegal visitations. The student
complains that the administran
tion successfully overlooks ill-
legal Visitations. He demands
immediate action via changing
the rules.

In essence, the student is
complaining that the adminisn
tration is not doing its job bow
cause it rails to reprimand him
for breaking the rules. This
little gem at a complaint trans-
cends hypocrisy and merges
wlth the realm oi stupidity.

define as a ”healthy revolution,"
