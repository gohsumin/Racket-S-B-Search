Congratulations must go to Coach Edd Bowers for the football
preview he put on Saturday. Introducing the players and then showing
the basic Pioneer defenses and olfenses will surely help the Grinnell
tons to enjoy the game. having the cheerleaders show on the gear of
the players was also beneﬁcial and enjoyable to most or the crowd.
Although the game was not overly thrilling, there were a few excit<
lug plays, usually happening when the players had to improvise after
the original play was abandoned.

At Lawrence a group of alumni and townspeople formed “The
Lawrence Bench" under the co-chairmanship of a local bookseller and
p tormer Little All-American football player. The long-range plan of
this organization is to show appreciation to the College for its cultural
and economic contributions to the community. But right away they are
trying to fill the new 5,400 seat stadium for the opening game. Good
luck. it would take a tremendous upsurge in attendance for the Plu-
neers to get that many people for all four home games.

The 1965-66 Pioneer sports teams will be out to match the great
success of last year’s teams which captured the conference all-sports
itle. Due to a tremendous surge in the spring sports, the Pioneers took
lhe title with 34 points, one point ahead of Cornell. Then came Carleton
ind St. Olaf, 37; Ripon. 45; Beloit, 54; Monmouth, 57; Coe, 53; Law-
tence, 61; and Knox, 62.

A former football star is the associate director of admissions.
Nick Ryan Ryan holds a prominent position in the Pioneer record
book. In 1954 in a game against Carleton he gained 213 yards which
is the Pioneer record The 743 yards he gained that whole season is
second on the Grinnell list. He is third in career rushing with 1427
yards, fourth in career total offense With 1538 yards, and fifth in career
gcnring with 73 points. He was also ﬁrst team all-conference in 1954.
Maybe with Ryan in admissions we might be able to secure some
mholars who are also star halfbacks.

Grldmeu Feature
Squad PIaloonlng

Keen competition continues at all
positions as the Grinnell gridders
move into the tinal stage oi prac-
tice before their opening game
with Cornell here Sept. 25.

“All in all. we are quite pleased
with our progress," noted Coach
Edd Bowers. "We are further a«
long in some areas than we were
at a comparable stage in past
years," he stated, but cautioned
that “we still have a lot to do."

Bowers will do a lot of pla<
tooning and expects about so Pio-
neers to see heavy action.

“We feel that we have good squad
balanceeat least a couple of good
boys at each position” he related.
“As our newcomers gain experi-
ence, we could be deeper than
last year.”

The interior line, which was
wrecked by graduation, remains
the big question mark. Only three
lettermen—Rick Anderson, Tom
Lannom, and co—captain Paul
Thurston—return, putting a heavy
burden on sophomores.

Lack of size is another problem.
At present, not a single Pioneer
tops the 200 pound mark.

“We are going to have to hit
faster and be more aggressive on
both offense and defense to com-
pensate for our lightness," Bowers
pointed out.

The Scarlet and Black came
through the heavy contact phase
of practice in good shape. Veteran
ends Al Peterson and ‘Nord Brue
and sophomore quarterback Kent
Thomson are the only ones on the
injury list, but none are serious.

Thomson has been pushing Bar-
ry Anderson, last year's regular,
for the quarterback job.

The halfback and fullback jobs
are also being hotly contested.
Bidding for offensive roles at half-
back are three lettermen—corcap-
tain John Shierholz, Dave Syn—
horst, and Bob Watt, who all
turned in good performances in
Saturday's scrimmage.

WRA Picnic

The Women’s Recreation Asso-
ciation will host a co- educational
picnic at Lake Acre tomorrow at-
ternoon. Informal recreation and
a shish kaboh barbecue are plan-
ned.

WRA sponsored a bike hike
Sept. ll. The girls peddled their
way between courses of a progres-
slve dinner.

Pioneers Face
Home Opener

Still hampered in their condi-
tioning by the Continued cold and
wet weather, the Grinnell cross
country runners will make their
first home appearance of the sea-
son today.

The Pioneers will face Drake at
5:00 p.m. in a Smile run over
the Ward Field - Country C l u 12
course.

Last Saturday the harriers ran
ln the State Federation meet at;
Ames, The Pioneers took seven
runners to the meet that included
Iowa State, Drake, and SCI. in
the three-mile race the top finish-
er was Steve Brintnall in ninth
with a time of 16:55. Other run-
ners were Jeri Langham, 11; Rio
MacDowell,15; Doug Dray, 18;
Bob Grant, 20; pick Lovell, 25;
and Spencer Clark, 26, in'the 3%-
runner fIEId. John Sharpe missed
the meet because or a leg injury.

“I’m fairly well satisfied with
the over-all progress of the
squad," coach Dick Young re.
ported. “But this weather contin-
ues to hamper our training. In
two weeks of practice, we still
haven’t had one really good con-
ditioning day."

Young plans to run all eight or
his squad members in the Drake
dual—lettermen Steve Brintnall
and Jeri Langham. and new-
comers John Sharpe, Ric Mao-
Dowell, Doug Dray, Bob Grant,
Dick Lovell, and Spencer Clark.

“Right now, we have three pretty
good runners in Brlntnall, Lang-
ham, and Sharpe." according to
Young. “I’m pleased with their
progress."

“But, we should have seven good
men for a wellrbalanced team and
have to have at. least five,” he
noted.
