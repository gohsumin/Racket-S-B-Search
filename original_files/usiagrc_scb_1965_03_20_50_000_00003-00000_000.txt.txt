forget Civil Rights Awhile: Viel Nam More Urgent

‘ To the Editor:

Much has been said recently
about the deep Apathy of Grin-
neu students with regard to W
littcal and social issue: outside
campus life. The strong reac-
tion against last week‘s brutah
ities in Selma shows that stu-
dents do realize that national
and international issues imposs
real demands on their con»
sciences and political aware-
ness. There is, however, tn-
other issue present today that
looms over the domestic tight
for civil rights and social equal-
ity and threatens to hinder its
progress, We refer to the criti-
cal situation in Vietnam. We
refuse to believe that students
at Grim-tell would remain indif-
ferent to the course of events

its grave implications.

we see a great. unnecessary
distance between the principles
behind the struggle for a Great

Such actions seem to lead away
from the goal of negotiation
