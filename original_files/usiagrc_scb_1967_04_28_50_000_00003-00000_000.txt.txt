The Grinnell REPORTER

 

Press inlern's beat in Des Moines

By Jonathan Shows

Covering the towel State Capitol as
a reporting intern for United Press
International (UPI) was strictly an
"Alice in Wonderland" experience. It
was entertaining. frightening, and even
interesting at times.

The day starts when you try to get
past the little old man in the parking
lot. He's determined to park you off
somewhere with the “general public,"
whatever that is. And you just about
have to run the old dear over to sneak
into the convenient spots reserved for
newsmen.

Then you wind your way up to the
press gallery. There the reporters, hung-
over but enthusiastic, are busily try-
ing to stir up some news. After all,
you've got to have something before that
10 a.m. deadline. If all else fails, you
can ask some nut about daylight sav-
ings time. ”ﬂiere': always a little old
lady around who will insist that it's
a Communist plot, or it's going to burn
her lawn.

You’ve got to hustle down to the
Governor's news conference shortly
thereafter, It‘s a cat and mouse game
that no one should miss. The Governor
tries his best to keep the reporters in
the dark. of course, sometimes he'll
speak “oil-ﬂierecoi'd" and toss out
some tidbit that has been common
knowledge for a month. And the re

porters? Well, they try to get a juicy
(hopefully profane) quotation—the sub-
ject doesn’t matter much.

After that there’s the interview with
the chief of the Pottawattamie County
Temperance Union; a cup of coffee:
a call from the downtown bureau ask<
lng what the hell you've been doing
all morning; another cup of coffee; and
then you decide you'd better do a story
or your vast following will fall to see
your name in print in tomorrow’s papers.

So you glance at-a Legislator, who
then dashes madly over, anxious to
divulge anything which may get his
name in print. You pretend to he busily
taking notes as he spews forth every
thing he knows about anything. This
usually takes a few minutes. when he
tinally runs out of breath, you ask
him to, please, call someone a dirty
name, endorse the Pill, nr predict some-
thing about the war in Vietnam. A
bored smile will usually cause him
such frustration that he’ll say some-
thing controversial. Even if it's just
another comment about what s.o.b.'s
journalists are.

All too soon you’ve got to race back
to Grinnell. Just enough time to grab
a Winky-burger on the way out of
town. But you have a moment to re-
liect. And usually I think about what
a strange breed of cat is lowa gow
emment, and how beautifully appropri-
ate is its press coverage,

LeMoyne students protest
Memphis police brutality

Protesting what they termed uncheck-
ed police brutality, zoo LeMoyne C014
loge students and 5 Grinneil exchange
students marched on the Memphis City
Hall earlier this month.

The April 3 march resulted from
the dismissal of charges against two
city policemen who had reportedly beat-
all 21 year old LeMoyne student Clint-
Dtl Jamerson during an earlier incident.

Jamerson was lighting a cigarette
when a police officer walked toward
him. According to Jamerson. the po-
liceman expected his cigarette to be
lighted also. When the student blew the
match out, the policeman~with the aid
of another officer—took him to a squad
uar where they allegedly beat him.

One of the officers involved claimed
that Jamerson made a motion as if
m strike him but missed. The day
liter the march, April 4, charges of
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest
Igainst the Lemoyne student were dis-
miss-ed.

“We feel that it is incumbent upon
the City Commission to take immediat‘
lotion towards the emotion of an in-
dependent citizens' review board," come
mented Dr. Vasco Smith, Vice-Chairman
of the Memphis NAACP. ”The Commis<
llun must provide lawAabiding citizens
of this community with the protection
they need from our police department."

“A police department investigating
complaints against itself," added Smith,
"is like a big brother investigating his
little brother. They come out clean
ovary time.”

bation {or the five accused. “I don’t
think separation from the community
is an adequate answer to this problem."

Charles Connerly, a Cowles Hall
member, stated, “Expulsion is a cruel
and cowardly punishment because it
eliminates a person from society. in
this respect it is analogous to capital
punishment.” ,

Four of the accused brought witnesses
