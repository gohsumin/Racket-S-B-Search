Pioneers Drop [age Opener

Meet Rugged Knox
Here Tomorrow

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneers dropped their
opening tilt to Luther last Sat-
urday but coach Plitsch was
not terribly discouraged by the
game, Both teams made the
usual number of mistakes for
an early season game. but Lu-
ther's superior rebounding and
shooting gave them the 9142
Victory.

Coach Ptitsch mentioned that
Luther’s starting lineup of last
year that won the lows Confer-
ence championship was intact
and included two all-conference
performers plus a second team
pick. “We will not face a team
that is better personnel-wise
this year,” he said. “They were
too last and neutralized our at-
tempt at a running game. We
were also overcommittlng our-
selves on the offensive board:

which allowed them to get too
many iast breaks."

All the statistics tavored Lu<
ther. They easily outrebounded
the Pioneers 58-39 and Shot 44
per cent from the iield to 39
per Cent tor the Pioneers.

One thing the Pioneers must
improve on is their shooting.
Pfitsch mentioned that the Pie—
neers have to be shooting
around 45 per cent to make up
tor the deticiency in rebound-
ing. He noted that the Pioneers
stayed with Luther pretty well
in the second halt when they
shot over 40 per cent. Although
the Pioneers many times took
a long shot when they possibly
could have set up a closer one,
Pfitsch was not concerned. “We
are trying to gel the quick shot
anyway we can and all shots
the players think they have a
decent: chance on should be
taken."

0n rebounding Pfltsch said
the Pioneers rebounded well tor

their size but it should improve,
especially on the defensive
boards.

Considering all facets ol the
game, Piitsch was relatively
satisfied with the effort and
feels that if this team shoots
45 per cent, they will be in any
game.

Tomorrow night at 7:30 the
Pioneers will open the content
ence season with Knox at Dalt-
b .

yPiitsch. who has seen them
play this year, thinks the Pin.
neers have a good shot at them.
Knox will have much more re-
bounding strength and possibly
a little more depth, but the Pio«
neers will have more speed.

This will be a game of con<
trasting styles. The Pioneer:
will try to run while Knox will
run only it they have to,

The front line of Knox will be
5'5”, 6‘4”, and 6'3”, The 6’3"
forward Paul Madsen l: thl
best or the three letterinen.

At guard Knox has is sopho<
more Dick Feurst who might
give the Pioneers plenty of
trouble.

In their first two games Knox
beat Lake Forest 6647 and lost
to Augustana of lilinois 70-65.
