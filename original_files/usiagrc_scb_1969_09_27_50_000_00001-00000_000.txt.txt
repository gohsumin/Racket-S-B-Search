The purpose or Younker
Memorial Health Center is to
provide “limited treatment oi
students requiring short-term
care,” not to treat serious
physical or mental disorders,
Dean Joseph F. Wall told some
ion persons gathered in South
[nudge Tuesday night

Wail presided at a special
meeting called by President
Glenn Leggett to present
evidence, answer questions. air
grievances and squelch ialso
rumors about the Health Cen-
ter. Also participating were
Deans Alice Low and Waldo S.
Walker, and Mrs. irma N. Hall,
Administrative Supervisor at
the Health Center.

in reply to complaints that
students are not getting their
money's worth at the Health
Center, the deans pointed out
that the college spends 58 thou-
sand dollars for the Health Cen-
ter's operationrand a contri-
bution to the Jasper and
Poweshiek County mental
health clinic, although students
pay a total or only $51,795, Stu-
iients pay an individual health
tee at $45 annually.

Despite student complaints
about poor service at the Health
Center, the deans and Mrs. Hall
insisted that the “before-the-
chtor comes" service oliered
it the Health Center is
adequatet Dr. David Fergusonr
a consulting physician to the
Health Center who was present
It the meeting, said that he
believes the nurses have per-
formed their duties well.

Part,0f the problem, the
meeting revealed, is that the
health Center is currently un-
derstatied. Four nurses are
normally employed in addition
to Mrs, Hall. However, one
nurse resigned last summer,

 

and still another resigned last
week following what the deans
called “stress and tension" due
in part to student complaints
Mrs. Hall has been serving as
an on-duty nurse 47 hours a
week because of the vacancies.
She said the college is making
efforts to fill the vacancies, but
has encountered much dithculty.

The possibility of hiring an
in-residence physician for the
Health center was also dis.

cussed. Ml‘si Hall, Dr. Ferguson, >

and the deans all said that such
a plan would not be feaSlhlo
due to the difficulty or attract-
ing qualliied physicians. ,

Several students asked Mrs.
Hall to explain what sort of
treatment Health Center nurses
are permitted to administer.
She said that she could more
easily say what they cannot
do—inake diagnoses or give in<
jectable drugs. “In other words,
we Can’t practice medicine,”
she added,

Walker agreed to study the
possibilities oi reinstating an
inrresidence clinical psychologist
upon the suggestion at student
senator Bill Thomas, who is a
member 01 a senate committee

investigating student complaints '

about the Health Servicet
Walker warned that increased
health service might increase
health lees. thus increasing the
likelihood of a homogeneous
student body.

Walker also agreed to investi-
gate the possibility of replacing
the current health insurance
plan that covers accidents only
with a Blue Cross-Blue Shield
plan.

Thomas announced that any
lurther student question or
Complaints about the Health
Center should be directed to his
senate committee.

College Institutes
Fortini Sales Tax

The Forum Grill this morn-
ing began charging a a per cent
sales tax on all purchases over
14 cents. A recent ruling by the
Iowa Tax Commission removed
the retail sales tax exemption
on sales in the Forum Grill
and the Private Dining Rooms.

Previously, the college ‘had
been granted a sales tax ex-
emption because oi its status
as an' educational institution.
However, the recent ruling
ordered that Grill sales must
he taxed because they are not
directly related to the college’s
educational operations.

The tax commission is cur-
rentiy considering removal or
the sales tax exemption on
board fees paid to the college.
Should the commission rescind
the exemption, the college
may take the matter to court,

according to Donald Lambie, ‘

Vice President and Treasurer
of the college.

 

LEGGETI: CAN'T

“The drug situation is very
involved, and clarity is not as
easy as in other areas," Presl-
uent Glenn Leggelt told several
hundred Grinnellians gathered
in South Lounge last night to
hear a panel discussion about
the president’s recent drug pole
icy statement. “it is impossible
for us to say, ‘It you act this
way, this will happen ' Leg-
get sent],

The president indicated last
night that student drug users
who seek counselling cannot be
pos=ive that “confidentiality
will IteJespected” by the col-
lege.

“I think we have the Iype or
counsellors who will respect

confidentiality, but nobody can
guarantee it," he said. “The
evidence might be so revealing
that the conscience of a mem-
ber of the discussion group with
the deans might lead him in

n o w e v e r, Leggett’s drug
statement r released last Fri-
day — encouraged students with
drug problems to use counselling
services altered by the college
and pledged that “coniidentiab

set up procedures by which a
“private discussion group” or
deans, iaculty, and students Will

The drug statement which was
called ”ambiguous" by Iowa
Attorney General Richard Tiir<
her last week, also said ilitlt
the college will not “decide
whether evidence oi drug use
on campus is legally actionable
by civil authoritlcs," but it ad»

legal Consequences"
Leggelt last night_reiterated
that the drug statement is

,“vei‘y imperfect” and is ”sub-

ject to revision as events and
continuing discussion make it
necessary." The president em-
phasized that in dealing with
the drug problem the college
must consider is obligations to
students, iaculty, parents, alums
nl, and civil authorities.

Last night’s discussion re-
vealed that civil anthorilies can

Cops Question Student in Drug Case

Grinnell police last week
questioned a junior at the col-
lege “about making marijuana
available to a minor," accord-
ing to Grinneil Chief of Police
C. W. “Bill” Peters, No charges
have been filed against the stu-
dentr

He was questioned as
part of a police investigation oi
a case involving a 17 year old
high school student suspected
of marijuana possession Peters
said that the youth’s mother
last week turned over to police
a quantity of marijuana she
had found hidden in his room.

Because the youth is a minor,
he cannot be charged with pos-
session ot marijuana, Peters
said. “However, we can the an
open charge of delinquency,"
the police chief added.

The college student, who
claims no knowledge as to why
he was implicated in the case,
gave this account to the 5&3;

"r was asleep in my room in
Cowles around 3 am. Saturday
morning when Peters and out
car Larry Ray, both in uni-
form, came into my room and
woke me up. I'm pretty much
Convinced they didn't knock,
and they never produced a
search warrant. They made no
etiort to iniorin me oi my con.
stitutional rights at that time,
and i knew nothing oi the na-
ture of the charge or ii there
was one

“They said that they had
tried to reach me by phone and
implied that i hurl been trying
to avoid them. They said that
they wanted me to come down
to the police station at one

 

 

o'clock, and that if I didn't
they could get legal machinery
in operation. Their tone was
brusque, as though I was pre-
sumed guilty of something.

“i asked them what the whole
thing was all about, but they
would only say that i would
find out at one o’clock. Feters
told me, ‘1'“ break a leg to be
there at one, so you better be
there}

“When I went to the station
at one, Peters immediately in-
rurmed me of my rights, I told
him I didn't know what he
wanted me tor, and he said.
‘Don't play dumb; i want to
talk to you about marijuana.‘

“Peters told me that a high
school kid had been busted and
had given police my nama.
Peters asked' if I had sold to
the kid, and i said no. He ask-
ed ii i had ever smoked, and
I took the fifth

”Then he wanted to know the
names of any iriends i may or
may not have smoked with. He
said It wouldn't incriminate
people and it might help my-
selt. i gave hiln names such
as J. B, Grinnell, George Wash-
ington, and Dolly luadisoii.
