FacultyAbolishes Comp Requirement

By a vote of 62-14, the iaculty
Monday abolished the long-
standing general grnduation re-
quirement that seniors must
pass a comprehensive examina-
tion in their major field of
study. In doing so, the faculty
also voted to allow individual
departments to institute alterna
tive programs such as seminars
or research projects. to replace
the old requirement.

However, it majors are re-
quired to pass the departmental
programs in order to graduate.
the new requirements must
have the recommendation of the
Diviisional Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) and the ap-
proval oi the Faculty Executive
Council.

Students presently enrolled
may choose to satisiy either
new mandatory departmental
programs or the old compre-
hensive examination require-
ment.

The tacuity acted on the mo»
tion after extended debate on
the matter at its Oct. 27 meete
ing. Monday's debate was de-
voted to minor changes in word-
ing of an amendment offered by
Asst. Prof. John H. Worley
(Philosophy) that will allow for
the departmental replacement
of the comp requirement.

However, before the secret
ballot vote was taken, Prol.
John R. Kleinschmidt (French),
chairman of the faculty, sum-
marized the pro and con argu-
ments regarding comps by read-
ing from the minutes of the Ex-
ecutive Council meeting at
which comps were discussed.
The Executive Council last
month divided evenly on the
comp issue, with tive members
favoring abolition and live oth-
ers opposed.

Numerous departments this
week began preliminary discuse
Sions about the possibility of es—
tablishing replacement pro
grams for seniors presently en-
rolled.

The text of the approved
motion on comps:

“The college requirement
that seniors must take and
pass a comprehensive exam-
ination in their major field be
abolished, effective for the
class of 1970.

“Any department may re-
place the present college grad
nation requirement by institub
ing a program which is pain
of its course structure or in ad-
dition to its course structure.
Such a program could consist
of a comprehensive examina-
tion, a thesis or paper, a par-
ticular course or seminar, 3
research project, a public per-
formance, or any combination
of these. These programs may
be either optional or required
within a major ﬁeld, but it
passing the departmental pro~
gram is required for gradua-
tion in that major field, then
such a program must be re«

parted with recommendation
by the Divisional EPC to the
Executive Council and our
proved by that body.

“As such a requirement
within a major field is not a
new requirement, but a re-
placement for the present col-
lege graduation requirements,
all students now enrolled in
the college who choose to ma-
im- in those departments which
adopt mandatory programs,
will have the option of satisfy-
ing the departmental program
or passing the present form of
comprehensive examination.”

in other action Monday, the
iaculty debated about how it
should recognize luture Viet-
nam Moratoriums. President
Glenn Leggett predicted that ii
the faculty continues its Octoe
ber policy of "procedural flexi-
bility” (whereby taculty and
students were not penalized for
missing classes), there will be
“serious operational diiiicul~
ties,” especially during the
three—day December Morato-
rium which will coincide with
ilnal examinations

this week that last month’s
Moratorium action was too in-
trospective and was, in effect,
“preaching to the converted."

Accordingly, this month's ac
tion will be directed to the
unconverted, in town as well
as on campus. Tentative plans
include leatletting the high
school, meeting with towns-
people in informal dinner situ-
ations, and possibly a can-
vassing of the town similar to
that undertaken after last
year‘s inverted flag incident.
Such a canvassing may in-
clude presenting townspeople
with form letters to President
Nixon, Congressman Kyl, and
other elected officials in Wash—

Another important change

be a clarification of the in—

that “business as usual” he

anyone not participating in

The faculty also was informed
that freshman students would
be eligible for ACM varsity com-
petition in all sports except
football and basketball. Grinnell
was one of eight Conference
schools to approve the change.

Following a report from Klein-
schmidt, the taculty officially
voted not to implement the pro
posed Humanities III course.

Slutbnls Plan
To March In 0.6.

Over 70 Grinnell students are
presently making plans to par-
ticipate in a massive anti~war
demonstration in Washington on
November 15. The students
were given a substantial boost
Tuesday night when the student
senate allocated $200 to help
pay for bus transportation.

The Washington demon-
stration is being planned by the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War In Vietnamr Al-
though the march is planned
to coincide in part with the
November Vietnam Morator-
ium, organizers point out that
the two activities are not
directly related.

Two major activities are
planned at the present, a mass
march on Saturday, to be pre-
ceded by a March Against
Death that will begin Thursday
night and continue throughout
the day Friday During the
March Against Death, which
will originate in Arlington
National Cemetery, protestors
representing the 46,000
Americans killed in Vietnam
will march single file across the
Potomac River, past the White
House, to the Capitol. As
marchers pass the White House.
they will call out the name of
the dead G! they represent, his
name being borne on a placardi
The placards will be deposited
at the capitol.

The Saturday march, behind
the demand ”U.Si Get Out oi
Vietnam," will begin with a
rally on the Mall, a large
grassy area near the Capitol.
The demonstration will then
move down Pennsylvania Ave.
around the White House, and
conclude With a rally on the
Ellipse, a park located behind
the White House.

The main body of the Grinnell
contingent is planning to leave
by bus Friday nrternoon,
participate in the Saturday
march, and then depart Satur-
day night. The anticipated cost
will be set per person, although
funds, Such as the senate allo-
cation, are being sought to help
defray expenses. Senior Larry
Frank is working with the
