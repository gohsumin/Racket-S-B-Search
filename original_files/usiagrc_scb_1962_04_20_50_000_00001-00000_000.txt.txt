The most pressing problem,
according to the University of
Chicago export, is control of
nuclear weapons. He said that
nothing will prevent nuclear
war unless we can “tame the
bombs," by placing them under
international control.

Speaking to the problem or
lAmel'ica's relations with its
Iaiiies, Morgentlrau pointed out
.that the US. has altered its al~
liancc policies radically since
'prerWorld War 11 times. In cone
trast to that time. when the US
strived to avoid entangling alli»
‘zinces, we are now involved in
alliances with over 40 nations.

We have continually tried to
deal democratically with our
allies, he said. to the extent
that we are not taking the leader.
ship whrch is our duty We have
failed, he said to recognize that
our allies have political prob-
lems, not just problems of a
military nature. Because our ai-
, liance system has only one pur-

|pose — to protect the security of
lthe U.s., we should not hesitate
to interfere in their politics
when necessary, he saitl.

, We have been wrong in our
- approach to the USSR, Morgen-

, policy oi containment to be-

come too dogmatic, he said

Containment is not a run
ioreign policy," he said, ”just
part or a policy. We should
not be seeking to draw a line
around the world. We might
