Faculty Committee suspends men's hail
president and sr. girl on morals charges

By Richard Schneirov

Langan House President, Richard
Weeks, a junior, and Gretchen Brewer,
a senior, were suspended from voltage
this week for illegal visitation: (lV’s).

The decision by the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs (FCSA)
means that Weeks will have to take
his final exams off campus, be stripped
at his office of House President, and
spend the iollowing semester on conduct
probation. Gretchen Brewer will not be
allowed to take part in graduation exer-
cises.

According to Weeks, the decision pos-
sibly represents a trend toward a mum
discriminating policy concerning such
violations. "I think this indicates that the
committee in showing a little more item-
hliity. This is the most lenient punish-
ment that has ever been given."

in the past, visitation violations have
been dealt with by suspensions ior an
entire semester.

(When contacted, Chairman of the
FCSA Denis deCoteau refused to com-
ment on the committee’s decision. The
administration was also unavailable tor
comment at press time.)

Weeks said he thought the FCSA‘s rea-
Ion for giving the light penalty was
“extenuating circumstances." He exA
plained that in spite of the fact that the
visitation had been overnight, Miss Brew-
er had only been studying in his room.

Weeks explained his policy of eniorce-
ment of the college regulation concern‘
ing visitation. He said that he would not,
as an enforcement oiiicial report any-
one have IV’s unless that practice was
"very blatant, repeated, and infringed
on the rights of other hall members.

“Illegal visitations are an individud
matter. People should make their own
choice as long as they don’t hurt any-
body.

“1 told the chn that it (my policy on
enforcement) was better this way until
they start establishing a little more flexi-
bility in their penalties."

Former Coil-1p President, Senior Bob
Fame, a friend of Weeks, commented an
enforcement on North Campus. “Look at
how many cases have been reported by
student oiiicials in the last two years.
It speaks ior itself. There are methods
{or dealing with illegal visitations within
the halls Enforcement has become all-
most meaningless."

“SGA officials are like anyone else.
when they‘re elected they’re not going
to stop having lV's. He added as an af-
ter thought, "Though they may be more
discreet."

Foota went on to say, "A lot of people
are getting to be much more tree in
speaking about IV's. This is a thing that
has changed in my four years. The
student body is now accepting ii. m1-
tnraliy." (See page eight statement by
’67 graduates.)
