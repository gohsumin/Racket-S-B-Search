I. M. Sports

By Bill Gray

Spring has almost come to
Gl'lnllell and with it, the I. M.
softball debacle has begun
anew. As usual, it is impossible
to determine anything until the
season is over but, since I am
lacking in self-restraint, l will
make some brash and totally
unfounded predictions.

Dibble and Clark shared the
championship last year and
therefore draw some considera-
tlon tor this season. Clark has
lost to Dibble already, however,

and they don’t appear to have
the material of last year. Dibble
has also lost an extra inning
affair to East. a team that
must be regarded highly. now-
ever, East has lost to Rawson,
a team which apparently has
nothing.

Rationality never was one oi
the stronger features or North
Campus softball. This, then,
leaves Cowles (Cowles?) as one
or the major threats. Their hon-
eymoon will soon be over,
though, as they have yet to play
any of the strong teams,

South, North, Langan, West
and Gates seem relegated to
the middle or bottom of the
standings although the rule of
spoiler is a favorite softball oc-
cupation. This leaves Smith as
the team to beat. With many
huldovers from last year's team
and some additions from the
ltesilman baseball team, Smith
seems to have both the person-
nel and desire (they have not
won a major sport this year).
Letters oi refutation may be
addressed to the editor who will

summarily dispose of them.
Monday night, a crowd esti-
mated at live jammed the

swimming pool to watch the
umpteenth annual women’s 1. M.
swimming meet. Naturally
enough, chaos and contusion
reigned supreme. In addition to
the usual variety of races,
points were scored for term and
for certain unorthodox events.
Included in the festivities was
one race in which walking
rather than swimming was the
order at the day. The sweatshirt
relay had to be seen to be be
lleved. It consisted oi a four-
length race with each girl
swimming one length and then
taking off her sweatshirt and
putting it on the next girl. Need-
less to say, with wet sweat-
rhirto and wet girls and tren-
ried rumbling, interesting re-
sults toolt place. it ls a safe
bet there will be more than
live people there next year.
Last week, the Grinnell girls
swept to lirst place in the lows
State College Girls’ Meet at

Ames. Linda Arret was a double
winner while Betsy James,
Michelle Sweeney and Nancy
steinson were single winners.
Debby Epstein, Kim Lauridsen,
Peggy Stice and Val Budig took
points in their events.

Over Spring Break, Peggy
stlcc, Ann Harkey. Sue Krause,
Linda Railsback, Miss King and
Miss Buck went to Madison,
Wisconsin for the national con-
terence of the Athletic and
Recreational Federation of Col-
lege Women.

But measured against results, these eight months could be the most advanta-
geous ones you'll ever spend.

lf you have the right qualiﬁcations—a BA. or 3.5. degree and a genuins
interest in succeeding—you may be one of a select group or young men partici-
paling in the new Management Internship Program at Saranac Lake in the
Lake Placid area of upstate New York.

This unprecedented program starts in early September and is sponsored by

the American Management Association — the World's largest and foremost
nonproﬁt educational organization devoted to advancing and sharing the
principles of sound management throughout lhe entire management oom-
muniiy. Last year alone some 1,300 separate AMA educational programs wen
attended by more than 100,000 managers representing such diverse ﬁelds as
business, education, labor, government, religion, public health, and the com-
munications media.

Everything about the Management lnternship Program is unique. The
Management Center where you’ll livc and study is oquipped with every recent
technical advance in educational methodology. The tlcully is drawn from
III: nation's most gifted and successful practicing managers. And the
curriculum is tailor-made to the knowledge every beginning manager needs
but tew posseSSrincluding well-developed leadership skills. ..a sophisticated
understanding of the interrelationships between business and other social and
economic organilarions. . .a thorough indoctrination in the various phase.

or management. . .and a ﬁrm grasp of practical business techniques.

In addition, you will have the invaluable opportunity to associate with the
company presidents, lahor leaders, government officials and other lop-level
administrators who panicipale in AMA’s regularly scheduled meetings.

It's unlikely that there is a manager at work today who would not have
welcomed aoomparable opportunity to gel a practical orientation in manage-
ment before embarking on his demanding career. Can you aﬂ’ord to pass it up'l
