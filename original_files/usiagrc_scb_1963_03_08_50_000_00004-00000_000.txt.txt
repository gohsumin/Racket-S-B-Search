McK/veen: President 'Coordinator' [not 'Prow/er'

As a Candidate (or president
of the Cam? I am interested in
having that organization looked
upon not as a police force, bill
as a group of l'CSpOnSiblC young
men who are expected by those
who elect them to maintain a
responsible degree of order with-
in their respective halls The
general level of student matur-
ity has shown in most cases that
such a system is quite workable
and successful, although student
govemment is never any strong-

Each student should be ablc tot iiiator, who is interested in hav-
recl that he can he himself, asiing the individual house pres»

An increasing role or indopeir

The matter of rules and their

the big itciiis ot concern in cam.

the president of the CofHF
should not be a prowler who
goes around barging in on one's
privacy He should be a coord-

er than the students who gov-

There is considerable variety
among the individual halls on

there should also be an oppoi»
