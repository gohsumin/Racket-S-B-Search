Associated Women students
Board president Donna Jo Briley
told the Senate Wednesday that
it could expect some proposed
changes in the women’s hours
regulations from the Board with
in several weeks. She did not
reveal what the nature of such
changes might be.

IN OTHER business the Sen»
ate voted to amend the portion
of the Student Government As-
sociation constitution which pre—
scribes the membership of the
social planning board. Last spring
the student body voted to re—
move the SGA president from
the social planning board.

Through an error, he was in-
cluded as a member of that
board when the current stu-
dent handbooks were printed.
The proposed amendment
would allow him to attend
board meetings as am eonn‘icio
member.

»A second change would allow
the Council of House Presidents
president and the AWS Board

president to appoint permanent}
theiri

representatives to take
place on the planning board and
would then allow the AWS and
Coil-1P presidents to attend plan-
ning board meetings without the
Power to Vote.

This amendment must he rati—

hour discussion will be held in
