ICARLET AND BLACK

Hockeyettes Beat lowa Wesleyan
2-] in a Bruising Moral Victory

By CINDY ROOT

The Grimell minutemen
helped the cause or icmininity
in sports as they met the lowa
Wesleyan bnlisers on home
ground Inst Friday. The striped
sweatsuited team must have
averaged 150 pounds. but they
looked and acted as it they
averaged 200 pounds.

They were all business,
though, and spurred on by the
deep rumbling yells irom their
coach on the sidelines, “Stop
her, stop her, you ldiots!” as it
it were a matter of life and
death (which it began to look
like), they provided us with the
best duel of the season.

The Grinnell delense, Kathy
Ellis, Heather Poole. Becky
DeWeiSe, Cindy Maier, Narda
Cisco, and Suzanne Griset, wth
its usual precision, kept the op
position out or the striking
Circle and fed the forwards so
that Mimi Buntz and Cindy
Root could muscle their way
down the iield ior 2 quick goals.
Debbi Eppstein, Marcy Woody,
and Jamie Rosenblatt rounded

out the forward line and put in
a good light.

At the half. the hruisers were
desperate and resorted to such
tactics as tripping, hooking,
pushing, triple guarding, and
such displays at all-around de-
ceitlulness (better known as
try » to . get . away - with - any -
thing . without - attracting - the .
umpire) which dlrtied up the
game and kept the minute—
men scoreless. But does crime
really pay? You bet your beanie
it doesn't, and even though in
the last ten seconds the bxuisers
satisﬁed their madly raving
sideline pacing coach a nd
knocked one in, to the surprise
of dauntless Connie, the Grin—
nell girls won 2»1l It was worth
the resounding thud bestowed
on our backs (although it was
all we could do to keep stand»
log) by the sporting bruiser
losers.

. . , Funny, sports seem to
be one of the few things re
maining to tire up Ior con-
structively.
