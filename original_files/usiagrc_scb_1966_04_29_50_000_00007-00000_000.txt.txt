) Pot Book

(Cnntlnued from Page 1)
the students’ use of marijuana is their
“isolation." He believes drug usage has
spread from the Bohemian groups to
others.
in his book, Goidstein makes no esti-
mate as to how many student: at Grin-

nell use pot. But he says, “Around the
country about one out of seven use pot."
, President Glenn Leggett is one of the
first persons to have ordered the book
lrom Walker and Co. in New York.
Parts of the book will be serialized
in a twopart article scheduled to he pub-
lishcd in the Saturday Evening Post May
10 and May 24. One of the articles will
mention Grinnell.

. Goidstein lays he has spent close to a
year in researching the book. During
that time he visited is of the 50 col-
leges. However, he did not go to Grin-
nell.

The author, who earlier published an
Irh'cle on drugs in Moderator, says he
wrote the book on the basis or Inter-
views with over 350 persons who had
“first-hand contact with dmgs." He
says he also made visits to colleges and
lent questionnaires to administrators,
police, health oiiieiais, student newspn-
pers, and other contacts.

“Fifteen per cent of all students have
tried marijuana once," says Goldstein.
“I don't think this is an outrageous
estimate. He says a University ot Cal-
ifornia dean at Berkeley told him half
the students there have used marijuana.

And a dean at Columbia College said
one third of the students have used pot.

The ore-publication reaction to the
hook has already caused the change of
the title and of one chapter heading.
Originally named Hey Mr. Tambourine
Man: Drug: on Campus, the title was
changed atter Bob Dylan threatened to
sue. Also I chapter entitled “Pot and
the Pepsi Generation" was changed at
the request at the Pepsi Co.

Goldstein, who will receive I M.S. de-
gree in journalism in June, says he
was subjected to other pressures in writ-
ing the book. "My phone was tapped."
he says. “It started a couple of days
after i talked to the New York narcotics
squad.”

But he says the marijuana users and

‘ dealers he talked to were the one: “win:
lace a real risk."

The conclusion Goldstein draws on,
marijuana usage is that it is “relative-
ly harmless." Alter marijuana he says.
“college students sometimes graduate
to psychedelic drugs."

Goidstein maintains, "college students
share their parents’ horror of heroin."

He reiterates, “This is the first gen-
eration to face an opening up or the
drug scene. Dmgs have crept into the
popular culture.“
