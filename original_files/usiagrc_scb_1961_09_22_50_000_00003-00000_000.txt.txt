Question OtBertin i
And Disarmament
Is Panel Subject

“Berlin and Disarmament"
was the topic discussed at is
.cortee hour sponsored by the
Grinnell Students for Peace yes-
terday iii Younker lounge.

The panel included Joseph
,Wall (history), Alan Jones (his-
tory), Dirk Baay (modern for.
eign languages), and Mike Mone
tross and John Ward, students
Bill Johnson, president of the
Student Peace group, moderate
ed. After the panel had stated
their views, discussion was
thrown open to the audience.

Most oi the discussion cen—

tered around Wall’s statement »

that the United States has
little c oice but. to pull out
oi Berlin or to undertake ha- ‘
sic negotiations with the So—

vict Union. Mike Montross in- ,

troduced the idea oi passive

resistance. which‘ also stimu- .

iatcd much discussion. .

Whereas John Ward felt thati
disarmament is the only wayl
to save the human race ironi,

annihilation, Jones contended}
that it is impossible to disarmi
now because there is no chanca‘
of negotiating. ‘,

A major step in disarmamenti
according to Wall, would be;
the demilitarization oi central,
Europe under a plan propasedl
by Communist Poland in 1956,l
which the United States did noti
then accept.
