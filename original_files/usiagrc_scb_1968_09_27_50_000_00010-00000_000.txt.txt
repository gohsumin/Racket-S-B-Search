WE CAN‘T FOLLOW
THE LOGIC

Recently the curriculum com-
mittee decided to release
through the College News ser-
vice the names of all students
(who maintained the average or
k plus or better ior the second
aemester. Along with this de-
'ision was made the ruling that
luch material cannot be re-
ﬁned as a new: story for local

nsumptiou.

Naturally enough. we cannot
see the logic in the reasoning,
although it seems to be in line
with the local policy. We will
grant that the story is probably
not of stupendous importance.
Itill we believe that the attitude
at the committee is at fault.

The excuse given {or prohibit-
ing local publication is that ii
{will stir up competitive jeolous<
ies among the students, Perhaps
it would, although we are in.
Flilled to think that this danger
is overemphasized. But never-
theless. why release the mater-
lsl at all?

We suppose that the action
was taken in order to secure
some puhllciiy in diiierent state
papers, and ill so doing to give

this is so. then we ask; why not
release the material on the cam-
pus whero real recognition could
be given, and where it would be
appreciated more than it would
as a five line item in some daily
paper, it run at all?

We feel that this action on
the part oi the curriculum oom-
n-litteo in illogical, to any the
least, and it is indicative of
the general tendency to look
down upon the Scarlet and
Black as “just the college news-
paper", and is a partial exs
planation oi the reluctance with
which certain members of tho
administration will release in-
formation to the paper.

on, is to be adequately metI
then we believe that the action
of the committee was wrong.
and that much more might have
been accomplished it something
was done in the way of a new
program—perhaps the complete
abolition of grades or some
other new scheme. At any rateI
nothing was gained by suppressr
ing the news for campus publi-
cation.
