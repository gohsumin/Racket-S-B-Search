Issued By Ludwig I

A preliminary report on cam-
pus civil deiense planning was,
Issued this week by McI‘rltt C.‘
Ludwig, vicerpresldenl

“OIYicizIs of the collcgc do not‘
believe a nuclear attack upon
our country is probable, but we
must concede that it is possible,"
Ludwig said i

“Therefore, in fulﬁllment oti
thel‘esponsibillty We feel toward
our resident students, the col.‘
legc has begun serious planningt
for their protection in the event,
this community should be
threatened by heavy radioactive
fallout.” ,

Emphasizing that detailed
planning is Inc from complete,
Ludwig said :1 Study of the
protective quality or campus ,
buildings has been made, and t
a decision reached to Ilse the I
basement of the Fine Arts
Center as the campus shelter. I
The area is large enough to
accommodate the entire Stu-
dent body plus essential op-
erating personnel, and the
building Strucun‘e aﬂords ex-
cellent shielding.

“The objective of our plans
is to provide ‘ialloul shelter for
residenl students and the shel-
tel": essential operating person-
nel [or a period of up to 14
days," Ludwwig stated. “We are
assuming that non—resident stu.
dents and college employees will
take responSlbillty for provid
ing shelter Ior themselves and
their families lll their homes OI"
elsewhere,"

Several reeks ago President
Bowen appointed an ad hot ad-
nlimsil'alive committee to dos

try) and includes Dean James
