Christiansen Says in Lecture

“ Iy Wayne sungel

critically examining the “art
'deals with search, science deals
with research" attitude that he
believes has widened the gap
between art and science, Ken-
neth Christiansen (biology) il-
lustrated both the ever-increas-
ing similarities and the neces-
Iary contrasts between the two
fields at a fine arts lecture last
Thursday

He noted the act of creation
15 the strongest bond between
scientist and humanist. “The
mientist and the artist only live
when they are creating,” he
said. In this light Christiansen
questioned whether one can di-
yol'ce the search for scientific
knowledge from the search at
beauty. “What scientists strive
to achieve is honesty, and who
cries more about honesty than
the artist?” he asked.

Christiansen leels that the
artist alld scientist have been
most seriously estranged by the
common conception of scien-

 

tific processes “Data-gathering
or processing is no more I
process of science than canvas—
stretching is that of art. The
really important questions of
science are what kinds of ques-
tions will be asked and not
what the answers Will be," he
said

In outlining necessary differ-

ences between science and art,
Christiansen cited the contrast-

ing importance oi emotion as a
in the work of the
scientist and the artist, and the
practically limitless scope of
artistic endeavor as compared

stimulus

with the more restricted hori—
zons of science.

In defining the most basic

difference Christiansen said,

"Science has one basic differ-

ence from art—testability.

Artistic criticism cannot be put

on a scientific basis. A truly
scientiiic criticism is virtually
impossible. Plow

merit of science—testability?”

David Lighthourne
letters to Mother

All too Utter], It seems like Grinnell's social pro
gram is nothing but an attempt to make nur week-
ends around here minimally bearable, a schizoid
effort to forget that we're a small, voluntarily iso-
lated community with a, high percentage oi bore-
dom. This policy has Iouhd its highest expression
in the one and only Cate del Faro, where Chicago
expenseaccount plushness is rivalled only by the
opulence of the chic young hedonists who can be
seen revelling in its gay, glittering, sophisticated
atmosphere every Friday and Saturday night

Grinhell's concert series is, of course, an at-
tempt at a middleclass complement to the jet-set
intimacy of the coffeehouse. Accordingly, all the
seedy delights of In Ed Sullivan mentality periodi-
cally come our way — not in the confines of 21
inches, but magnified, instead, to the vast scale of
Darby’s masscult facilities.

Thus we have had the pop in: hink of Nina
Simone, tooling with a strap on her lcwcut dress
in me sordid dustiness of Darby's old, battered
basketball court, surrounded by personality cult
followers, Victims of Several varieties, as well as
all the rest, who were perhaps just looking for
something to look it. Although the spectacle or
Miss Simone was more compelling than usual, ber
cause of the essential ersatz at the whole pathetic

presentation, other examples have been even worse,
usually because of ii plain lack of talent.

In marked contrast to the usual pattern. how-
ever, last weekend saw the performance of Jan
Redpnth, a Scottish folksinger and amateur (olkr
lorist, whose loiowledgeable regard for the beauty
or Scottish iclk literature gave us a progrnin lull
or simple grace mid charmr Miss Redpath is prob-
ably ihe finest protessitmal {olksinger in the coun-
try, not only because at the {lawlessness of her
singing, but because at her attention to appropriate
style in the loving recreation of authentic lolk art.
She is that rare kind of folk singer who is sufficient-
ly removed trim the personality cult of the folk
music revival in be an artist rather than a teenage
legend object writ in large neon letters midst a
sea of militant phoniness. >

The point Is that it is the responsibility at the
concerLs committee to give the college community
a level or quality in its presentations which is ap-
propriate to the nature of its audience. Musical fine
in is not the exclusive property or the music de—
partment, as Miss hedpatli so beautliiiuy proved,
It is awnilly senseless to waste money and extort on
the sensationalism of mere physical proximity lo
"name" entenainers when perrormers of Miss Red<
poui's quality are available,

Many Feel Overwhelming Helplessness

Say Students Ailer

Five Grinnell students who par-i,
liclpated iu inner—city work prol
jects last summer and this spring
related their experiences in a panel ,
discussion Sunday night in the
South Lounge of the Forum.

“A City pi Necessity,” a iilm den
picting the Chicago inner city, pre~
faced the discussion. Panel mem-
bers were Jay Wllliams, moderar
tor, Bob Robnett, Anne Spragiie,
Delabian Rice, and Gretchen
Roecker.

One impression of inner-city hie;
that the panel stressed was the
overwhelming hopelessness ion by
many people who live under condi-
tlol'ls they cannot escape. Miss
sir-:lgiie cited the example in a
man all relief who, like many Otllr
ei-s, desperately wanted [0 iihrl a
job, but couldn't, because “there‘
simply are not enough jobs, even
{or those who are trained.” Em-
pliisning the lack of mobility con»
homing hiahy prospective workers, [
she added, "HOW can you try (Di
work who you can’t even get to‘,

re they're offering i "

According lo Miss Roecker, poor
education is also responsible lor
in s hopelessness, especially for
Kean c . ieI]. She said, ' he ed-

 

lnner-Ciiy Vacation

ucation they're getiing is atrocious.
They’re just moving iliem ibruiigh.
And this is a fact at his in the in-
ner city."

Miss Rice said, “We have an

impression oi the poor as obvious»
ly poor and unintelligent. but they
are oilen nothing but victims of
Circumstances. People in this con-

dition are not typical: they are not
statistics; they are not all alike.
We can't know their thoughts and
their potential.”

“We finally realized that all the

cliches we’ve heard are true. It's

one thing to believe It intellectual-

ly and ancmer to believe ii emc-
tionnlly,” Williams added.

“l didn’t want to hear stories
about how bad things were,” Rob-
“because tlley were

net: said,
pretty bad. But I'm glad I (lid
hear, because I didn't know this
problem existed."

Chicago has tried to eliminate a

part at its slum problem by build-
ing new highrise apartments. How;

ever, according to Miss Roecker,
“moving the people min high-rise
apartments doesn’t solve a thing,

it just compacts the people and
moves the slums behind a nice

fmllt.’ '
