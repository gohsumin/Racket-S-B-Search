EXTRA-CURRICULAR CREDIT CONSIDERED

The Student Coordinator’s or
(ice is currently involved in an
investigation working towards
a major change in this College's
curriculum. A “4-1-4" academic
year, somewhat the same length
as Grilinell's is now, with the
addition of a month long special
term in January devoted to in-
dependent study is being con-
sidered.

Student Coordinator Tom Trip»
lett and his stali have been
gathering iniormation from
nearby colleges such as St. Olaf,
Westmar, McCalaster, and Be-
loit for the past four weeks con-
cerning the programs at those
colleges. Generally, the pro-
grams are one month long in
January, occur as either on-
campus or offrcampus study in
one particular field, and carry
academic credit,

A voluntary interim program
0! independent study which did
not carry academic credit was
offered at Grinnell during the
last ten days of the Christmas
and semester break period lor
the past two years. Last year,
approximately three or four
hundred students registered for
the program, but only 1/, or 1/3
of those registered actually at-
tended. The program was (lis-
continued this year.

The chief difference, besides
length of time, between the 4-1-
4 year and the interim program
is that the 4-14 is a “fully aca-
demic program,” according to
Triplett. Although independent
study in the January term of
the 4-H year would be like the

interim program, it wouuld fo-
cus on special problems that
cannot be handled in regular
course work, the faculty would
still be closely involved, and
credit would still be closely in-
volved, and credit would be
given for such work.

The Student Coordinator plans
to submit a proposal of some
kind to the Executive Council
of the Faculty, after their are
ploratory work is completed, be-
fore the end [if this semester.
They are hoping that there will
be student discussion on the pro-
posal, and that students who
live in communities where there
are colleges currently operating
with a 471—41 program will bring
back information on these pro«
grams alter mid — semester
break. Also, they intend to ques-
tion faculty members on their
reactions to the plan, and how
it might interfere with their
work or scheduling,

The Executive Council of the
Faculty will be the first body
to consider the proposal. The
council consists of the three
division chairmen, the educa-
ti all policy chairmen of each
division, an lat-large faculty
member, the chairman of the
faculty, the Dean of the Col-
lege, and the President. Be-
cause of the failure of the in—
terim session last year, faculty
and administration are doubt-
ful about the program.

President Leggett told the
5&3 that, although he felt that
such a program had a solid
theoretical basis, “after the ex-
perience of last year and the
previous year," he would need
to be persuaded that it. would
work, and “whether the stu-
dents will respond to it.” Free
fessor Morris Parslow, a mem-
ber of the Faculty Committee

on Curriculum which investi-
gated many curriculum pro-
grams last year, expressed sim<
ilar feelings. He saw “no par-
ticular merit in 41-4 as some-
thing new and different" and
considered it mostly as a poor
modification of the interim
program and a “more form»
less way of the old system of
just givmg out credit."

Tom Triplett took the opp0<
site view in arguing int a
change: he views any new in-
dependent study program such
as the 4-1-4 program as a way
to get away from "the unstimu-

lating nature of much of the
current curriculum "

Bicycles Stolen?
Read This

Bicycles are stolen in Grin-
nell at therrate oi 1 or 2 a day.
in most instances, the bicycles
that are stolen have been ridden
away from where they were
parked, and then left anyplace.
The police, when they find
these stolen bikes, will contact
the owner (if the bike is ll-
censed). If it is not, it is put
on the bike rack at the police
station.

Presently there are at least
6 bikes at the station. Some
of these have not even been re
pozted as missing, They will
be left in storage there (at the
Police station) until they are
claimed by the owner.

Coordinator Both
PR Man, Lawyer

Last spring, the Office of Stu-
dent Coordinator was set up
within Student Government,
with two major functions, to
act as ombudsman for students,
and to provide public relations
for SGA.

In his role as ombudsman,
Thomas Triplett. the Student
Coordinator, and his two as-
sistants. have successfully han-
dled many cases of complaints
from students. ranging from
very simple problems to ones
of major academic concern in-
volving a great deal of investi-
gation. in almost one semester
of operation, only one problem
that has been handled by Trip-
lett’s office has not been solved
to the satisfaction of students —-
Director of Residences Ralph
Pomerenk refused. for safety
reasons, to let the basements
of the Park Street Houses (Con.
lerenoe House, Interracial
House) be used for Pferndactyl
and the Grinnell Drﬂit Infor-
mation Center.

Every other problem ranging
from getting rid of wasps, put—
ting a light on Barber Plaza at
night, and changing the way
art exhibits in the Forum are
selected, to academic problems
involving changes in the edu-
cational policy of the Music De-
partment and changes in facul-
ty rulings on the academic
standings of students handled
by the Student Coordinator has
been solved to the satisfaction
of the complainants. “Nothing
would have happened in most
cases if we hadn't participated
and added the SGA seal," ex-
plains Tom Triplett.
