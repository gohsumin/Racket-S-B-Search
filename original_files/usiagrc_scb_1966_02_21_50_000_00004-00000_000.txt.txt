SGA Convention Unexpected Drama

l’oliiical Dealings
That Went Aslray

The SGA Convention was
vraught With political manne-
'ers. Pictured below is Steve
ohnson 7 Dibble delegation
ead and Shender’s campaign
ianager. The second ballot
e reported his delegation
~l for Kent. This would have
ept Wittgraf from getting
the needed 35% of the dele-
‘ates’ votes. Presumably
ohnson hoped to throw the
onvention into a third ballot

iving him time to muster sup-

ort for Shender. A polling
of his delegation revealed five
for Wittgraf, two for Kent,
and two for Shender, making

ittgraf‘s nomination a near
bertainty. Johnson is pictured
during the caucus and then,
tlumped, head hung in hands,
during the polling.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

e Goddard Blasted
But Still Smiles

Throughout the campaign,
from all of the candidates.
Jerry Goddard was blasted
for running a “non-student
government,” for excluding
vast numbers from SGA, for
accomplishing little. Goddard
chaired the convention Satur-
day and, through the myriad
of posters and placards (left),
he can be seen smiling. God~
dard, who came to head SGA
unopposed, did not have to go
through a convention.

Goddard will retire from
office at the start of spring
vacation. During his term in
office he saw reorganization
of the Senate and faced an in-
herited financial crisis from
his predecessors.

Wittgraf Waits WIIiIe Backers Work

An SGA convention is hard on a can-
didate — especially when he isn’t on the
floor of the convention to be able to see
what is happening, to help. George Witt-
graf spent most of Saturday afternoon in
his house presuient’s suite in North Younk-
er, reading, making phone calls, looking
out the window. Meanwhile, in Darby, his
supporters weren’t having a much easier
time. Chris Swanson, who spent much of
the afternoon running around the gym
trying ’to organize Wittgraf’s votes, is seen

as she rested for a moment, her head lean-
ing against a placard for “George." Witt-
graf made it out of convention by an un-
official margin of four votes. Wittgraf got
100 votes. Ninety-six were needed. The
needed votes came mostly from halls
changing from Shender to Wittgraf. Some
observers feel that the turning point came
when West Norris reported 13 votes for
Shender and a poll of the delegates re
vealed that one vote went for Wittgraf.
West Norris is Shender's hall.
