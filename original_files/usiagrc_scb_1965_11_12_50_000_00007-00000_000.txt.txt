Freshman Grid Team Shows
Potential For Future Years

By DAVID SKINNER

This 1965 Grinnell freshman
football team should provide a
fine nucleus to replace the ll
graduating seniors from this
year's varsity, according to fresh-
man coach John Pfitsch. He sees
them as doing better than replac-
ing the current senior crop, by
potentially raising a shade the
quality or the varsity team. The
freshmen ﬁnished with a l-l WC-
am this season,

The potential of the 13 firsHeam
treshman gridders is better than
average ior a Grinnell firstayear
squad, and at least three others
should be able to achieve varsity
caliber with experience. The male
jar problem is size, for the entire
team is quite small.

Backs Tom Lower. Dun Krait—
sik. and Roger Bryant, and tackle
Bob Lillis are the men with the
greatest potential, but they are
backed up by an extremely tal-
ented learn oi varsity candidates.

The guards, ends. and center
are or an equal caliber. All are

good players, but are questionable
because or their lack of size.

At tackle are Bob Campbell (175
lbs.) and Lillis (190 lbs.). Both
have adequate size and will surely
play next season: Campbell is
quite rugged, and Lillis is smart,
a good hitter, tough, and agile.
Ptitsch calls Llllls ”one of the
best. linemen I have ever seen on
a Grinnell freshman team. He
should be an outstanding Midwest
Conference rootbell player. Llllis
will probably be converted into a
guard next year.

Five members of the freshman
backﬁeld should play varsity ball.
The quarterback is 6' 3” Lower.
the biggest regular on the trash
squad. Lower was a standout on
oriense and detense, and may de<
velop into an outstanding varsity
player. He is an average passer,
a better-than-average runner.
and a good signal caller. Fullback
Bryant. a leapuunder, is a good
runner and blocker. He was also
an exceptional linebacker on de
tense. Kraitsik, a 6' Z” halfback.
was an all—around star periormer.
He was a good runner, blocker.
and pass receiver, and was a line
defensive halfback as well. 160 ll).
halthack Pat Cavanaugh is very
quick. a good blocker and receiv~
er. and a flue tackler on defense.
