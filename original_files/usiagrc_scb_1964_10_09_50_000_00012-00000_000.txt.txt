recourse to peaceful methods
of changing the rules.

I have been accused of old
fogeylsm for advocating a re-
turn to the “outmoded" concept
that ”father knows best." of

course parents are not infal-
lible, but the odds are with
them

Tht "right to make one's
own mistakes" is an absurd
rallyhg cry. We all make some
mistates unavoidably, but what
is the use of studying the his-

tory of human society if each
generation must repeat the er-
rors if the past?

SCARLET AND BLACK

Friday, October 9, I964

 

Paradoxical though ii: may
seem, true freedom comes
through commitment —- com-
mitment to people, to ideas, to
causes greater than oneself.

Freedom lies in being able to
choose an area of engagement
and intensive interest, it cannot
be found in aimless hedonism
or irresponsible drift.

The joys of freedom reside in

using one’s powers to the full
in the service of some worthy
enterprise that commands all
one's depth of conviction and
devotion.

We are happiest when we are
fully used, and it is the bore-
dom and frustration of disen-
gagement that makes us queiu-
lous and petty and mean.

in the standings. Both team!
are one and one.

South, Gates, and Cowles
have all lost twice, but Cowles
has only played twice, South
and Gates each hold one vic~
tory. Rawson scored 12 points

while losing their first game to
Gates. In the next three out-
ings, they ran into some prob-
lems: Clark, South and Norbh.
Rawson can still claim a dozen
points. but their defense has
hurt, allowing 84 points. A Spe-
cial interview revealed the fact
that they may not be too good,
but they don't win either.
