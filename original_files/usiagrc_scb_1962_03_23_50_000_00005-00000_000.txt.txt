Cleveland Play

'Pic’rures in file

The nationally famed Cleve-
land .Play House will present
Sean O‘Casey’s “Pictures in the
Hallway” on April 7 and 8. The
play derives its title from O’Cas-
ey’s explanation that “the hall-
way of every man's life is paced
with pictures; pictures gay and
pictures gloomy, all useful, for
if we be wise we can learn from
them a richer way to live."

The play, which reﬂects o‘—
Casey's childhood in the slums
of Dublin, is essent y the
story of a boy‘s encounters with
the truths of life.

The Cleveland Play House,
whose previous productions of
O’Casey plays have met with
praise, is both a touring comr
pany and a school of drama.
Founded in 1915, the Play House
is a non-proﬁt theatrical organi-
zaLion which every year plays
