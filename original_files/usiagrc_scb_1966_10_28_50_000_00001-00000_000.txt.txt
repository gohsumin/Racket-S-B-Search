On Fifth Year Program

Grinnellian Reports from Thailand

Ed. Note: The lollowlng re-
port is by Ginny Harford,
’65, who is presently teaching
English in Chiengmal, Than
land. she is a participant In
the Grlnneil fifth-year abroad
program.

I guess first in better throw
in some of the facts about my
job~hern which i found rather
inaccessible when trying to dis-
cover what the program in-
Volved.

As i am doing. most of tho
Grinnellians who come to Thai-
land with the Fifth Year
Abroad Program have taught in
Chiengmai, This is the second
(but by fat the second) largest
city in Thailand and is about
sou miles north of Bangkok.
Some of us have taught at
Prince Royal's College (primar-
ily a boys’ school except lor the
last two years of high school)
and some have taught here at
Dara Academy (girls' school).
Both of these schools include
students from kindergarten age
through high school. Dara has
about 1,700 students. About 90
of these girls live on campus
in a dorm.

Both Prince Royal's and Dara
are mission schools — original»
1y begun by the Presbyterians
but now under the Church of
Christ in Thailand. This natu-
rally puts us closer to the Amer-
ican religious society here than
to the American military society
(which is increasing rapidly).
But there is not a great pres-
sure toward nny kind of reli-
gious activity although I can
imagine that someone who ac-
tively and loudly disagrees
with the Christian religion
would find it difficult to Work
within the framework of the
school.

what I am trying to say is
that there has been trouble I.“
the past with the religious con-
victions (or lack of) of some
Grinnell volunteers. Many or
the restrictions (such as re-
quired chapel) have not been
lifted, but anyone who comes
must be aware that to work
with people most cirectively
in lhis framework, there will
have to he at least a toler-
ance of such things as pray-
ers at teachers' meeting, etc.
Beyond that nothing is re.
quired.

As a Grinneil volunteer you
would probably live on campus,
either in a house with other
Thai teachers or perhaps in the.
dorm with teachers and stu4
dents. i am living in a room
above the'l-iome Ec room. 0n
the same floor are about four
other Thai teachers, Darlene
Keeier, another Grinnellian, and
assorted others. The room re-
minds me very much of a room
I had at camp oncer So, come
with the idea that you won’t
be living in luxury out not with
the idea that you will be living
in the wilds of the jungle — as
I admit I had pictured at
times. Meals can be either Thai
or foreign — both of which are
provided at the school. The
Thai food is prepared in the
norm, the foreign food at the
home oi a missionary who lives
on campus.

I am teaching English only 14
hours a week (15 is the normal
load) but will be teaching 18
hours when Dar leaves in No
vember. I teach the best Eng-
lish sections in the 10th, 11th.
