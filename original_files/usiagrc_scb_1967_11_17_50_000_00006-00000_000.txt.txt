TIMES IIEPOIITEIi SEEKS
ACTION, FINDS GRINNELL

Five and a half years ago
an emissary ot that greatest or
all metropolitan newspapers,
The New York Times, descend
ed onto a Grinnell campus then
“galvanized" by the mere sug-
gestion that a fallout shelter
be built in the basement of the
new fine arts building then
under construction.

Last Sunday Nan Robertson,
of the Times Washington bu-
reau, was back at Grinnell to
discern—oi all things—“the na<
ture and extent of political and
social activism at Grinncll,
1967.”

Miss Robertsoniwho is also
researching activism at Harvr
ard, Berkeley, the University of
Texas, anrl the University oi
Wisconsin —interviewed SGA
president Ric MaCDOWell, AWS
board president Leida Schoggen,
5&3 editor Barry Ancona and
several other “student leaders”
chosen lor her by the college
Information Service.

She talked With members DI
the Grinnell Student Movement
(GSM) concerning anti-war sen-
timent on campus and inter.
v i e w e :1 several anthropology
majors on problems at Negro—
suboulture and civil rights at
Grinnell.

Miss Robertson also attended
a dinner with officials of the
college Development ottice and

Information Service and Bub
l-lodiet‘neY former 5&3 editor
and freelance war correspond-
eni.

The Times reporter, present-
ly doing a series of follow-up
articles on an activism series
printed in the Times in 1962,
noted a change in the Grinnell
sonic-political climate since her
last visit

In 1962 she said she found
the campus “swept with rumor,
apprehension and discussion" at
peace tests, anti - war move-
ments. and international politics.

An international relations club
430 members strong—was the
most powerlul organization at
Grinnell.

And when Miss Robertson in-
vited student leaders over to
the panelled Park Street draw.
ing rooms of Grinnell House in
1962, she said she got quotes
like this one:

“We are building up to ex-
plode out at the private world
or the college. . . We want to
assert our feelings and our in-
tellectual arguments in a more
public way."

”Grinnell College when I was
here last was ‘something else,’ "
She told the 5&3.

“Concern about weapons and
war is normal at such colleges
as Swarthmorel It has Quaker
and pacifist traditions," Miss
