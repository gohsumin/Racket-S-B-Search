he outlined
foul major American education-
al weaknesses.

—_ Narrow admissions criteria;
_ Frenzied atmosphere;
_ Over—scheduling and super—
vision ot students;
Examination procedures
which subvert the aims of
liberal education.
“THE EXCELLENCE of a col-
tlege lies largely in non-quanti-
Bttive and intangible factorsilive-
tly discussion, spirit of tree in-
unry. a student culture that re-
spects learning
i . and is concern-
‘ ed about values
and participa-
tion or taculty
and students in
the attairs or
the college," Dr.
Bowen said.
“These are the
elements that
d i f f erentiate
great colleges
from indltterent ones, and these
elements are by no means fully
expressed in the numbers that
are so easy to compute, tabuiete
and communicate."
Dr. Bowen then recommended
that Grinnell:

_ reduce the graduation re-
quirement from 124 to 96 cred~
its with extra time created to
be used tor special interest
studies, both credit and non-

_ require students to keep

section or the senior compre-
hensive exam;

. bcr of course examinations;
