HHa/aina hoot Student Body  

By Ruth Gruenivnld
(leature editor)
A week of campaign politiek»
ing ended last Monday as Btll
Halama, Coivles junior, became
president ot the Grinnell Stu-
dent Body. winning by a ma—
jority of 147 votes (Hala‘mai
462, Thomson—31o), he now
faces the task or putting the
new constitution into actual
plactlce,
Halama will take office on
Wednesday according to the old
-constitution, since the new one
has not yet been l‘atlficd by
President Bowen.
“The main concern between
now and spring vacation,"
says Ilalania, “will lie the
transition to the new form or
government.”
The election results are in a
sense a vote or confidence lor
the present Student Council
administration; Halaina's plats
torin boars more resemblance to
Krulilike’s ideas than did either
of the other candidate His
concern over NSA and the
whole realm or national alrairs
indicates that perhaps the “yr-d
of the student.” is not yet ov.

It remains to be seen whether
or not Halama can bring the
necessary qualities of leadership
and judgment to the ‘presidency.
He sees the role oi' student
body president as an active one,
combmlng coordiatioii w i t h
leadership.

"An active president," said
Halama, rings new and trash
ideas to the Council; he acts
as an intitator.”

Halnma considers the two
anain problems coni‘ronting
, the council to be making a
su- es ~tul and iimnettnitc
tran‘ on to the new iorm
or government and maintain-
, ing the precedent sctin cunsitlr
oration oi national issues.

Some oi his immediate plans
include the setting up or a his
dieial committee to go over pie»
cedcnts set by the AWS Board
and CufHP in Judicial matters,
a meeting or all people inter—
.ested in applying for the posi-
tion or Senate speaker in order
to discuss what the lot) will ens
tail, and the setting up or a
committee to study the best way
in which a transition ii-om the
old to the new court system
should be made.
Halama said that .
“the advice of people who have
been carrying out itidicial func-
tions valuable.”
