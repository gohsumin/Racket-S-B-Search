Religious Board Opens Religious Activities Room
For Committee Meetings and Discussion Groups

The newly remodeled Relig-
ious Room on the second floor
of Steiner is now open to all
students. This campus addition,
which boasts wall-to-wall car-
peting, wood paneling and mod-
ern furniture, will be used for
Board of Religion and commit“
tee meetings, meetings of camp-
us denominational groups, stu-
dent-faculty groups discussing
campus problems, and informal
groups wishing to discuss top-
ics of a religious or philosophi-
cal nature.

In addition, all students are
encouraged to use the room,
which is open from 7 am. to 10
pm, Monday through Saturday,
and 1 pm. to 10 p.111. Sunday,
{or discussion and reading.

A library supplied with mag-
azines and contemporary books

be a photographic exhibit done
by John Phillips, a freshman.
The art department will supply
paintings tor a rotating exhibit.

Th 9 Religious Activities
Room will also be used for
Board of Religion coffee hours
throughout the year. The room
was opened to the students
last week with the first
of two coffee hours given by
five Grinnell students who at-
tended conferences With Profes»

it does not. Our maid would
yacuum the window of its con—
tents on Monday and by Tues~
day the numbers would again
be in the hundreds.

One fly in his death throes is
quite noisy but can you imagine
the racket produced by one
hundred and thirteen such
creatures in the same condi-
tion? it is not conducive to the
sleep required by all human
beings.

This problem has 1: e e n
brought to the attention of your
office twice: once last October
and again two weeks ago. As of
yet, you have chosen to do
nothing about the situation. I
can envision three possible
courses of action for you. First,
you could send a couple of your
men over to remove the screen
completely. This would pre-
yent the flies from becoming
trapped and would permit the
entrance 0! more dangerous in-
sects such as wasps, bees, and
hornetsi Since I suffer from ‘31-
lergies that require weekly
shots, a sting from such an in-
sect could cause a violent re—
action and might eyen result in

 

snuffing out my young life.

The second alternative is to
have the upper portion of me
window loosened from its
painted-shut state which would
allow one to stuff the opening
with newspaper or the like.

Thirdly, the screen could be
nailed securely shut, thus pre—
venting the entrance of the
flies.

Seriously, Mr. Walden, l’m
not looking for perfection. One,
two or even twenty ilies are
quite easy to ignore. but when
it gets up into the hundreds
(and the maid can vouch for
this fact) it becomes very hard
to take. Please, will you see to
it that something is done to
rectify the situation.

Name Withheld

The Board of Religion ex»
pects that the newly remodeled
room will meet many needs of
individuals and student groups.
The remodeling was begun last
year by the creative arts co-or—
dinator of the Board of Religion
working with an administra-
tion and faculty committee, and
has been brought to completion
by this year’s creative arts co-
ordinator, Jean Watsoni The
room is now the responsibility
of the Religious Activities Com-
mittee.

Anyone wishing to reserve
the room for a meeting should
contact Rockne McCarthy or
Judy Edquist, co-chairmen of
the committee. A schedule of
meetings will be posted outside
the door of the room.

Thel'a Sigs Go
To Conference

Grinnell’s Bunny Hunt, Andi
Hand and Kathy Elliott were
among 131 journalism students
from 23 midwestern colleges
who attended the 1964 Upper
Case Careers conference spon-
sored by the Chicago chapter
of Theta Sigma Phi last month
in that city.

The students received specif-
ic tips on job hunting and liv-
ing in Chicago and had an op-
portunity to spend a day on the
job with a Chicago chapter

The Social Planning Board is
conducting a study on the prob-

on campus, There has been
much concern that students are

list for the services, and that
there is a need for a bigger and
better bus and perhaps addi-
tional facilities like more wag-
ons or micro-buses.

The Board is trying to gather
evidence about the students’,
organizations’, faculty’s, and
athletic teams’ uses and de-
mands upon the existing facili-
ties. They would also like to
know if more facilities would
create an increase in demand
for their use. A questionnaire
will be distributed to post of-
fice boxes early next week and
it is hoped that all students
and faculty members will re—
spond. '
