SCARLET AND BCACK

Spring Rites Praised

Saturday afternoon — I could have
swom it. was Golden Gate Park again —
at least as enjoyable as the rock con<
certs I’ve attended there over the past
two summers, and pmbably the most
comfortable dayVWltIra-crowd I’ve exper~
fenced here. I've heard others were less
Comfortable and that’s unlucky; guess
they were waiting for something to hap-
pen to them; it’s hard to say.

Guerrilla theater members and Dig-
gers assembled the parts —— bands, slew,
balloons, San Francisco Express Times,
the Real SuperrBall, soap bubbles, linger
paints — the whole gig. It’s great to
know there are two good rock bands on
campus and i hope they play oiten,

No longer do we have to wait to leave
here to lind the things we enjoy (well,
most of the things we enjoy); it's here,
too, just as we suspected all along. Live
and learn and bring it our Amen.

Where the Truth Hurts

ny roivt THOMAS

Following the Playboy demonstration
and the subsequent releasing of state-
ments to the alleged demonstrators‘
parents, the Student Senate lorinally re-
quested that the Judicial CounClI examine
the actions of the Deans’ Office in this
instance. (For a copy of the letter, see
Presnient Leggett's statement, 5&B,
April 4th.) The Senate resolution 9X.-
prcssed the belief that the Deans’ actions
were not in accordance with the tenets
of accepted administrative practice and
that the present lack of stated college
policy called for an examination and
clariﬁcation of guidelines to he used in
future cases.

In a somewhat less than ringing de-
cision, the Judicial Council informed me
this Week that "after Considering your
request . this council finds no grounds
for action in this specific case.” No ex«
planation was given i believe this action,
or rather lack of action. represents an
abdication of responsibility, a submission
to administrative desires, a betrayal of
student rights, and an oversight ot riue
process. To explain:

Although the SGA constitution (ap-
proved by the faculty) gives to the col-
lege responsibility for taking tempor-
ary action in emergency situations “in-
volving student and community wel-
fare,” and it is on such grounds that
the Deans, in part, delend their actions,
the Constitution also specifically states
that the ultimate disposition of the case
shall rest with the judicial council.

As soon as the Senate resolution was
passed, several administrators declared
that they felt the judiCial council had
no right to hear the Case. This subtle
pressure increased over the two month
delay before the council actually met
to consider the issue. As one adminis»
trator ﬂatly told a judicial council mem-
ber, “I do not want this case heard."

 

A Word of Warning Abouf the Draft

By LEE MARIL

There are only a few short weeks left
until graduation. One must. somewhere
between the panic over RE. require—
ments, overdue papers, and comps, sit
down and begin to think over what is
going to happen when graduation is
over and done with. For most senior men
it means the draft and all the maze
of problems associated with it The leg-
endaiy air ot mystery and fear which
surrounds the draft remains pure myth;
everyone gets draited unless there is a
good excuse and not thinking about it,
blotting it out of one’s mind, or planning
one’s life as it it did not exist at all,
just a bunch of loolish crap

Most senior men seem to have some
idea of either enlisting or of somehow
evading the draft, But this “somehow"
grows vaguer and more abstract as the

questions get more specific. If you ex-
pect to get a physical deferment, then
you do not get one by complaining tor
two years to your friends about your
sore kneel What is needed is a complete
documentation signed by a doctor (5)
who know your case. The same may be
said for an occupational deierment or a
Conscientious Dbjector and when all is
said and done, it is up to the idiosyn-
crasies or your local board. in each
case a certain amount of work is roe
quired NOW on your part to avoid the
hassle and panic which i guarantee will
accompany you home this summer. it
is still not too late, but don’t push your
luck.

It you don’t know what you are going
to do about the draft. then I would sug-
gest three things. First, talk to some
one who really knows what it is all about,

preferably a draft counselor, for exam-
ple (mic, or others in iowa city and
Des Moines. Often just talking to some-
one in the same situation helps. Second,
get a lawyer if you can, they are utten
free and, of course, are of great value.
Third, lace the fact that the draft is
out to get you but that, nevertheless,
you need not let it; act now, not when
it is too later

Don’t put yourseil in the position or
denying personal values by getting
pushed, pressured, or shoved into the
armed services without really knowing
your legal rights. Decide what you are
going to do in the relative calm or
orinnell College where lamiiy and com-
munity pressures are at a minimum.

Evolve an active plan with alternatives,
stick to it, and trust your counselors and
lawyer,

The student Bill of Rights guarantees
(but apparently only when movement)
that a student is presumed innocent
until proven guilty, The Deans (and
hence, the college) have declared that
the students impulsively damaged the
institution without an attempt or even
subjective proof. The “identification"
process is equally open to question. The
judicial council however. would seem
to believe that the "proof of guilt” so
boldly touted is, in fact, the final deci<
sum of the Deans’ Office.

in reaching their decision not to tie
aide (is this to happen in every case?)
the JudiClal Council appears as oblivious
to accepted practice as do the Deans.
Neither the Senate nor its chairman
were informed of the “hearing." If the
council wishes to maintain even the
slightest ties to due process, One would
think they could at least exercise the
courtesy or allowing those who requested
a hearing to be present to detend that
request. Mrs. Low, of course, was pre-
sent to justify the administration posi-
tion.

This action of the judicial council
raises the fundamental question of the
viability of such a structure iii any area
other than the peripheral. Where are
students to seek recourse from adminis-
trative whims if they are barred from
the threshold of the very institution that
is constituted to afford such protection?
is the council to be but another body
to legitimate administrative decisions
before the college community. it is
the responsibility of both students and
faculty, who jointly sanction the council,
to demand a reconsideration of this
cioacal (look this one up, kiddies), sub<
servient evasion.
