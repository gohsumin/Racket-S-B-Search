tions. The following interview with
Meyer was conducted in an effort to
lupplemeni the facts presented in the
news article concerning the theatre de-
velopment which is also being printed
(on page 3) in this edition,
REPORTER: what prompted your
resignation?

MYER: I don't see that I should go into
the long history of problems that have
surrounded the Grinneii theatre opera-
tion for a long time. The people who
know about them already do — or if
they don't, it's because they choose not
to. The precipitating event, which i
think is public information, was the de-
gision to hire another director rather
than a technical director,

Resonant Why did you decide to re-
sign from the faculty and the depart-
ment completely, rather than remain
on as technical director yourself?
MEYER: I don't think my refusal to re-
turn to a position 1 held ten years ago
is either stubborn or surprising. There
are few faculty members who would be
willing to do that, in any situation,

I know I could have taken advantage
of the well—earned tenure and waited for
the right thing to come along, but cau<
tlon began to cost too much. My pa—
tience, willingness to compromise, and
disposition had been spent. Any prolong-
ation of the situation would have been
drawing on the capital of selfarespect,
It would have been at the sacrifice of

integrity. It's amazing how you come to
value integrity by living in the apparent
absence of it.
REPORTER: HOW do you feel you could
best fulhll your career as an educator
in theatre?
MEYER! It all boils down to this: I am
an educational theatre director. I want
In deal with students and I want to di-
rect plays, ideally in a larger operation
that allows a little less of each so that
the quality of both won't suffer from
the simple arithmetic of time. I don’t
want to play politics, and 1 don’t want
to waste time playing personal press
agent in order to please the limited but
vocal group who do.
REPORTER: Where are you going?
MEYER: Away. Sometimes that’s B spa-
Ciiic direction.
REPORTER: What are your personal
reactions to leaving Grinnell?
MEYER: or course it’s not easy to
leave. I wouldn’t have been at Grinnell
Ior ten years if I hadn't cared for the
place, and no man uproots a family of
six lightly a or at least I don’t. I hate
to leave the college and, must of all, I
hate to leave these students, Contrary
to some of the uninformed opinion about
the neverrwell-deiined “theatre prob-
lem," our theatre is one of the best
bargains the school has ever bought.
With a slant about the size of a Sec-
ondrrate junior college, we've put on
productions that surpass many univer-
slties. We have a national reputation at
which most or Grinneli is quite un<
aware. Our present group of actors is

they are the nucleus of the genius reper-
tory group that would be the envy oi
many a prolesstoual theatre. There is a
rapport among them, a mutuality of
spirit, a blend or strong artistic temp<
eraments that is quite remarkable.
REPORTER: What do you expect to do
after leaving Griiineli?

MEYER: This summer I'll direct two
or the three shows at the repertory
theatre at Kalamazoo College, and be—

really enjoyed teaching here."
