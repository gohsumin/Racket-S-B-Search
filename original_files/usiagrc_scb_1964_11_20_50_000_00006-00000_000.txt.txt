Biologists Obtain
Better Specimens
In Colder Weather

Dr. Kenneth A. Christiansen,
'(aiu), reports that previous dif-
ficulties his department has had
in obtaining live specimens of vari-
ous marine animals has lessened
greatly with the arrival of cooler
weather. One shipment of animals
sent from the East coast in mid-
summer was largely dead on ar-
rival, due to their exposure to
summer heat in transit. Another
sent in early autumn from the
Ward Biological Supply in Calia
lornia contained many dead speci-
mens. Christiansen noted that Grim
nell’s distance from both the East
and West Coast cause great dilii—
culties in stocking its new marine
aquarium obtained through the Na-
tional Science Foundation. and
used extensively by students in in-
vertebrate Zoology.

A typical shipment at such ani-
mals costs between twentyend
thirty dollars and includes star-
fish, sea urchins, coral, marine
snails and clams, sand dollars and
sea anenomes. Christiansen speci-
fied clams as the most rugged of
all the marine animals used, able
to withstand summer and early
fall heat, and live shrimp, sponges
and colonial coelenterates those
specimens least able to survive

- transportation conditions. Although
the marine aquarium allows ex-
tensive experimentation with live
specimens by‘zoology students,
preserved specimens are still wide»
