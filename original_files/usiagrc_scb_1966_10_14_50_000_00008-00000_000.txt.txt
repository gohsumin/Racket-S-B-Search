Monmouth Pioneers’ Next Prey

The Pioneer football team,
wlnless in its ﬁrst three games,
will try to escape the cellar
this week when they play at
Monmouth. Last week the Plo-
lleers fell to an inspired Knox
team 14-7 in what was supposed
to have been a fairly easy game.

Again this week the Pioneers
will be facing what should be
an easy game. Monmouth has
also lost all three of its games
and ranks last in the league in
both team offense and defense
They have been outscored 128-
28 in those three games includ-
ing a 47—0 loss to Ripon last
Week.

Meanwhile the Pioneers are
not looking so ferocious either.
Although they do not have sta-
tistics as bad as Monmouth's,
their play has kept them near

tistics.

Coach Edd Bowers was na<
tut-ally disappointed at the re-
suit and pointed at several key
areas that needed improvement.
First of all is team attitude. The
Knox bench was able to show
more desire than tile Pioneers'
all day.

On the field the Pioneers need
mainly to improve their block-
ing, punting, and passing.

The Pioneers were able to
complete only two passes
against Knox. one in each half.
in the three games the Pioneers
have completed only l6 for 149
yards.

The punting was had also The
Pioneers were able to average

only 29 yards a punt and a cou-
pie were under 20.

All three oi the touchdowns in
the game were scored after the
team recovered a fumble. On the
third play or the game Knox
fumbled and Bob Lillis picked it
up on the Knox 30. After being
helped by a penalty, the Pity
neei's drove for the score, in the
second period Knox picked up
a Pioneer fumble on the Pioneer
45 and drove for the score, but
missed the extra point and were
trailing 7-6 at half. 0n the third
play of the third quarter Knox
picked up a fumble on the Grin-
neil in Six plays later they scor-
ed and made a two point conver-
sion.

Obermiller noted that the 0p-
pressive heat held down the
times Even the winner, Karri-
steadt of Central did not run in
his normal time although he set
a new meet record. Kamsteadt

competition. The record he
broke was Gene Takle’s of Lu-
ther, who won the small college
crown last year.

Although the Pioneers did do
poorly last week, Obermiller
still holds high hopes tor the
team in the conference meet_
The addition to the team of let<
terman Bob Grant is one of the
reasons. Also several members
of the team have not yet run
close to their potential this year.
