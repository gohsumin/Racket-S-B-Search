The World Is Watching

Grinnell Stands Up And is Counted

By Tom Greenﬁeld

Grinnell College ushered itself
into the world of political com-
mitment when that great, big,
willowy, voluptuous hunk oi
flesh, The Body oi the Whole, got
itself together and laid it‘all on
the line last Tuesdav morning.
With'a crucial'iaculty meeting a
mere twenty minutes away The
Bod decided to approve a stator
menl to the effect that the institur
tion of Grinnell does not like the
Cambodian War or political rer
pression, The Bod doesn't like
what is happening to political prir
Sorters either, but that‘s going to
have to wait on account oi “prior
ﬂies") and will close down ”all
operations“ to talk things over
and to protest hither and yon.

In spite OI the Bod's ability to
pass a hastily written proposal,
many people present were
troubled by the latiguc and wanr
der lust which invariably takes
over the Bod’s collective “mind".
It seems that whenever the bod
gets itself together to whoop it up
in the South Lounge over R. A.

Satisfactory outlets for the “real
life" type frustrations which oc-
casionally permeate our hard-
candy shell and scare hell out of
us. it there is a major and terri»
lying injustice committed
somewhere else, we at Grinnell
are really unequipped for a sig-
niﬁcant — even appropriate e
response.

And So the masquerade runs
through to the Bod, The Bod
stated that “all operation?"
would be closed, yet 20 dorms, 2
caieterias, 2 gyms, the health
center, and the south campus toy
chest were all buzzing away with
usual iervor. Dale Hawn’s ability
to run 70 per cent oi our facilities
when all operations were closed
can only be viewed with wonder
— kind oi like the heating plant’s
answer to the immaculate Conr
ception.

But i suppose l protest too
much. Just because a statement
is important enough to write
doesn‘t mean that it‘s important
enough to read.

they have adopted “on the Pig”
as the motto ior next year’s or-

Before the question was called,

The motion passed by a large
majority, and the meeting adr
