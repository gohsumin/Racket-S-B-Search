freedom, for we recognize that
we are still growing. But we
do ask for responsibility, that
responsibility which is essential
to our continued growth. This
responsibility should be grant-
ed when it is reasonably re«
quested, and iorced upon us
when we hesitate to seelt it.”

The proposed Human Values

!ail and would be structured
like Historical Studies, with
lectures and class-size discus<

Discussions, including such

aim at encouraging students to

BAMPIJS
MOVIE

This weekend’s movie ls as
much a curiosity as a good
film. ll one were forced to
label it, it would be called a
“Japanese western,"

The director, Akira Kurosa-
wa, has made many films.
among them a picture about
Samurai warriors e n t I ll e (1
Seven Samurai, which was
adapted by an American direc<

tor to make an American west-
ern — The Magniﬁcent Seven.

This weekend’s movie came
about through a reverse prac<
ess: Yojimbo is a samurai plc~
lure built on the framework of
an American western. A hired
samurai killer pits two gangs
against each other, and the re
suit is an action-filled film
which is at the Same time hu-
morous, witty, dramatic, and
brilliantly Satirical.

Yojimbo was a 1962 Venice
Film Festival award winner.
It will be shown in ARI-l at
10:30 pm. Saturday and Sun-
day.

Being shown tonight at 11
p.m. is Gentleman‘s Agree.
ment, directed by Elia Kazan
and starring Gregory Peck.

Encampment applications i
are due In the box in the ‘
post oiiice by tomorrow
noon.

p PARANOIDS

(Continued from Page 6)

they are against the war and
everything it stands for, but that
they are unsure of what the
war is. and what it stands ior.
Are we lighting [or the iree
spirit at democracy, or are we
ﬁghting to save Mr. Johnson’s
lace?

The irony of this subject ls
apparent in the fact that para<
noia arises from a lack of com-
munication, yet communication
can only be reinstated when
this fear, this paranoia, is ov-
ercome.

This Country prides ltsell on
its ireedom ot speech. l chal-
lenge it to overcome its pres-
ent paranoia which smothers
communications. Our generation
prides ltseli on Its frankness,
its honesty and openness to-
wards other ways or life, as well
as towards its own. I challenge
it to overcome its present para-
noia which smothers communi-
cation.

Then, hopeiully, we can rein—
state the liberating phenome-
non of communication.
