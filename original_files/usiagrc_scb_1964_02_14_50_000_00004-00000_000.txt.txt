Students Discover Future

*

Is Objective of Placement Ofﬁce

By Karen Adkinson

“We’re in the business of sell-
lng opportunities." said Zeke
Bequeira, director of Grinnell’s
Placement Office.

The Placement Office is de-
signed to aid students in mak~
lug vocational plans. It was set
up as a separate office just
over a year ago with Sequeira
as director.

One of Sequeira’s innovations
has been the Placement Office
bulletin distributed every week.
It contains summer employ-
ment information, dates of tests
and visits of industrial recruit-
ers, and graduate fellowship
news.

He said, “We had no idea
this would flourish as it has.
We published a special bulletin
about the Peace Corps senior
program which was distributed
only to juniors and within an
hour after its distribution we
had other students calling and
coming in to ask for copies of
their own."

The Placement Office, ac-
cording to Sequeira, acts as a
counselor, adviser, and “brolc
en" It brings together recruit-
ers ahd job seekers, but more
than that it “seeks to find
means by which students can

translate their educational ex-
perlences into productive and
exciting vocations,”

”Most students seem to ig-
nore vocational planning dur-
ing their underclass years, and
by their senior year it is some-
times too late. How many stu-
dents, for example, choose a
major with a thoroughly inves-
tigated vocation in mind, or
perhaps more important, how
often do they select their work
in supporting disciplines with
a direction in View? Often the
related course work can do
much to enhance a person’s lap
bor value,” said Sequeira.

He continued, “This is like
buying the most beautiful Cad-
illac you can find and then let-
ting it sit because you won’t
spend anything on gasoline,
service, and licensing. Students
and their families often sacri-
fice a great deal for a BA, but
aren’t willing to invest a little
time and energy in investigat-
ing what they want of the world
and what the World wants of
them."

information is available in
quantity at the Placement of-
fice. Industry actively recruits
college graduates and puts vo-
cational information at the dis-
posal of colleges. The federal

 

Arene Theatre Renewal is Complete

The modern atmosphere of
the recently remodeled arena
theatre located on the ground
floor-of ARH' will provide the
background for many future
lectures and seminars, accord-
ing to Evan H. Walden, direct-
or of the physical plant.

The new lecture room,
opened to classes on Feb. 10.
had served as a theatre arena
workshop before the construe
tion of the Fine Arts Center.
Because of the need for more
classrooms, it was decided to
put the workshop area to better
Ila.

The remodeling. in the plan-

ning stage for two and a half
years, actually began just be-
fore Christmas vacation of last
semester. Although the project
is technically finished, drapes
and permanent chairs will be
added along with a large table
for seminar discussions.

For the present the seminar
and lecture room has been
fully scheduled for classes
varying from humanities to
speech correction. Next year,
however, the use of the “old
arena” will be limited to groups
more appropriate to that type
of classroom, such as large
English and history seminars.

 

 

government, through not only
the individual personnel de-
partments but also the Depart-
ment of Labor and Civil Serv-
ice Commission, is another
source. Individual research or-
ganizations also offer a good
deal of data as do professional
and vocational associations like
the American Medical Associa-
tion.

“What to do about summer
employment is a dilemma for
us. There are two main reasons
for summer jobs; experience
and money to continue an edu-
cation. Most of the time the
two don’t coincide. It’s difficult
for us to decide which to ex-
plore, in which area to expend
the mast effort. If students
have leads or especially if they
have run up a blind alley, we
would like to know in order to
share it _with others to help
make their time and energy
spent summer job hunting pro—
ductive with a minimum of ef-
fort.”

Monroe Beardsley Evali‘iaies
Relation Movements In lirtler

By Cynthia Erust

Normative problems, “the re-
lations or order to value," were
discussed Tuesday evening by
Dr. Monroe Beardsley, His
speech, “Order and Disorder
in Art," was the eleventh of the
"Order Seminar” Series

Dr. Beardsley stressed that
order itself is not necessarily
a valuerconcept, but “. . . in
some fields, order is taken to
be a ground of goodness;
Something desirable for itself,
. . ." He cited such ancient
thinkers as Plato, Plotinus, and
St. Augustine as early perceiv—
ers of this connection in the
field of aesthetics. .

Their conception was based
on two essential principles;
“what makes a work of art
good is its beauty,” and “what
distinguishes beautiful things.
. . . is a high degree of some
kind of order.” This forms a
tradition which “. s the old-
est aesthetic tr tion in the
West." This aesthetic theory in-
cluded organization, unity, and
proportion in its definition of
order.

The major part of Dr.
Beardsley's lecture was spent
evaluating two modern move-
ments which he feels “. . . have
raised this old problem again
in an. especially challenging
way. . . .” These movements
are “. . . the increasing use of
chance, or accident, in the cre-
ation of art,” and the informa-
tion Theory of esthetics.

“Tychistic art” is the term
of Dr. Beardsley uses to de-
scribe “art produced by acci-
dent. . .” Although new meth-
ods of “composing” were in-
cluded, the discussion was lim-
ited mainly to Lhe field of
“painn'ng,” as this is the area
where tychistic art is most
common and. most easily
assessed. According to Dr.
Beardsley, “The courting of
accident has been present to
some degree in all abstract
art.” He sees the current in-
terest in “junk art" to be a nat-
ural outgrowth of this fascina—
tion, for “nothing is left to the
vagaries of fate more utterly

 

than what man casts away. . ."

Moving to contemporary mu-
sic, Dr. Beardsley described
and analyzed the Information
Theory. This he called “The
most significant attempt to
provide a precise description of
order in art. . .” This theory is
a mathematical one, based on
a series of signals and the “in-
formation” they give, which
depends upon the unpredictabil-
ity of each signal. A random
arrangement would give more
information than one following
a pattern, which would be “re-
dundant” or predictable

This theory is applied most
easily to melody. Hypotheses
can be formulated that “. . .
there is some fundamental con-
nection between musical coher-
ence and information—value,"
There appears to be a “. . .
positive correlation between
musical value and redundancy.
or order. . . The best melodies
lie somewhere . . . between
complete ’randomness and a
very tight control.”

When we judge a work of art
to be good," Beardsley contin<
ued, “it is relevant to support
this judgment by pointing out
that the work is highly unified.
Again, , . .

He concluded with the obser-
vatiOn that “. . . Intensity of
quality and perfection of form
are both involved. . . each is
an aim of art. . ‘. . The artist,
no doubt is one who rearranges
the world, and makes us some-
