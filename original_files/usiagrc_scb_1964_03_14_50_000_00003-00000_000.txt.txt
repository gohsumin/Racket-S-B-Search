Faculty Members Comment on loss;
Acknowledge Role as President Here

Regret over the loss of Pres-
ident Bowe'n was mixed with
feelings of happiness over his
new appointment when mem-
bers of the Grinnell faculty and
administration expressed their
reactions to Dr. Bowen's resig-
nation.

“It‘s a great loss for Grin-
nell," said N e at Klausner
(phil,). “He is the finest pres-
ident of any liberal arts college
I know anything about. I am
sure that he will be able to meet
the challenges and difficulties
at SUI. He has everything that
is necessary scholarship,
integrity, and stature.”

“My first reaction was one of
pleasure for him," said Dean
of Women Jean Slocum. "I was
greatly impressed by the staff
he has gathered around him,
SUI is very lucky; Grinnell will
miss him. People in whom he
has had faith and confidence
will somehow manage to carry
on.”

Herbert Prescott (journal-
ism) stated, “Dr. Bowen has
done great good. His resigna-
tion was inevitable; the college
has done well to have had him
as long as it has had him, Ilook
with interest to whom the
Board of Trustees will choose
to succeed him. Will they fol-
low the general procedure and
import someone, or will they

find someone from our own
faculty or administrau‘on?"
Associate Dean Waldo Walk—
er said, “I am very sorry that
he is going. I am very grateful
for what he has done for the
college in the last nine years.
I only hope that we can make
an approach at ﬁnding some‘
one as well qualified as be."

"It will be difficult for the
college to replace him. This is
a great opportunity for him to
mov e up in the education
world," commented Laird Bar-
ber (Eng). ’

Howard Burklo (phil. and
reel.) said, "I’m sorry he‘s go—
ing because he’s a fine college
president. I hope we get some-
one as good as he is and who
has been a teacher and has a
close connection with the
faculty."

Retired Dean of Women Ev-
elyn Gardner said, “I count
myself very fortunate to have
worked with Dr. Bowen for so
many years."

“I think it‘s a very great loss
for the college. His appoint-
ment at SUI is a recognition
from the state of Dr. Bowen’s
ability as an administrator,"
noted Joseph Wall (hist.).

Winston King (rel.) said,
“This comes as a surprise. Dr.
Bowen has pushed the college
forward in the direction it
ought to take.”

dorm for 98 men cost about
$400,000.

The money for the ambitious
program came from a series of
tuitions raises beginning in 1957
and bringing the college fees
from $1550 to the present 52500.
To aid students in meeting in-
creased oosts, an extended pay-
ment plan a radical innovation
was instituted. The plan re-
ceived nationwide press cover»
age and stimulated inquiries
from 35 colleges including Har-
vard.

The primary source of reve-
nue, however. came from do-
nations. By 1959 the ”current
development campaign" had
raised $2,000,000 toward a goal
of $2,460,000. The fund raising
drive received its largest boost
from the Ford Foundation in
the fall of 1961, In announcing

the grant before a convocation
of the college Bowen said,
“This will make possible a
marked accelleration of our
planning time table. Education-
a1 improvements scheduled for
5 or lo years from now will be»
come possible in z or 3 years
. . . We also know that a dra-
matie increase in financial re-
sources, such as this grant and
the matching gifts represents,
does not aulomatcally improve
education.”

Other improvements included
the opening of the Health Cen-
[er in 1957, and the beginning
of minor improvements in the
residence halls, such as re

 

roofing, replacement of furni-
ture, and painting rooms. The
Science Building was finished
in 1957, and an addition is pro-
jected. The Forum is presently
under construction and should
be ready by next fall.

Revamping of the curriculum
took place in 1959. Experiments
such as the JLA, the Humanie
ties and Historical Studies pro-
grams, and the 2.5 grade were
developed.

In student government, En—
campments were conducted in
1960, ’61, and '63. A new Con-
stitution for SGA was promul~

gated in 1961. Numerous re»

visions in rules, including the
latest liberalized drinking rule,
were passed. Open dorms were
instituted on an experimental
basis, also.

Besides the dynamic trans
formation of Grinnell, Bowen
delivered a series of thought
provoking addresses. His most
famous one, delivered last year,
was entitled “A Game of Num-
bers” and deplored the insis—
tence of colleges on statistical
measurement of students. He
offered specific recommenda-
tions for the deemphasis of
numbers: reducing graduation
requirements, instituting a sen-
ior essay, the keeping of a
"scholarly diary,” the reduce
tion by one-third of course exr
ams, and the inclusion of sen-
ior comprehensive grades in
averaging grade points. He also
suggested admitting a number
of students who indicate pro
mise, but do not have high
Board scores or grades.

 

Head Trustee
Hewitt Lauds
Bowen WOrk

Edwin S. Hewitt, chairman of
the Board of Trustees, the
group responsible for selecting
Dr. Bowen's successor, talked
to the 5813 last night from his
home in Libertyville, Illinois.

Hewitt had no comment con-
cerning what process had or
would be undertaken in finding
a new president, nor would he
say whether anyone now on
campus or any other certain
person was being considered
for the position.

On behalf of the trustees of
the college, Hewitt expressed
regret over the departure of
President Bowen, but assured
the college that every neces-
sary step would be taken to find
a worthy successor.

He made the following state-
meuti

“President Bowen is now
standing college president. It is
a disappointment to the trustees
as it is to all people interested
in Grinnell that he won’t be
president of Grinnell for the
rest of his career. We wish him
happiness and success in his
new position at the University
of Iowa, and we congratulate
him on this new position. We
know that he will bring the dis—
tinction to the University of
Iowa that he has to Grinnell.
We are grateful to him for his
contribution to Grinnell.”

Students Register Surprise, Shock
At Sudden News of SUI Appointment

"I’m shocked," seemed to be
the immediate reaction amOng
the student body when word
came that President Bowen had
been named as head of the Uni-
versity of Iowa,

Across campus, in the dining
halls, and within small groups
people looked at each other
saying, “Whatl When did this
happen."

“1 think it is sad that: he’s
leaving," Said Ann Van Guilder,
senior, “I am truly shocked,”
followed Alan Gummerson, jun-
ior, who added, “he was the
college."

Students were queried last
night concerning their initial
reaction to the news, One group
answered as follower

Pete Read, junior, newly
elected Cofl-iP president, “My
initial reaction was one of
shock. Dr. Bowen has con-
tributed a good deal to Grin-
nell and for most students his
departure will mean a re-evaiu-
ation of the so-called Grinnell
Image. We must realize mat
Grinnell’s ideals aren’t direct-
ly affected and we hope that a
new president can continue
Dr. Bowen’s interest in student
life."

Jim Parkinson, junior, “I am
very surprised. I am also dis-
appointed because I think we
were all looking forward to a
good year with the president.
If this is what he wants, I wish
him the best of luck."

Steve Grooms, senior,
don't believe it."

Ellen Brodsky, senior, “I am
surprised. I have a funny feel-
ing about the fact mat there
was never anything said before
today about his leaving. He‘s
done a lot for Grinnell; per-
haps he feels he’s done what he
can do for us, and that what
he can do for Iowa exceeds

“1

 

what he could further do for
Grinnell.”

Bill Abernathy, junior, “I was
disappointed in the man be.
cause he had created an image
in my mind which represented
him as dedicated to small lib-
eral arts colleges. 1 cannot help
but wonder if his resignation
represents a changing of horses
in mid-stream."

Ann Young, junior, "He will
probably find it a more come
fortable situation there, not so
close to the students. I feel he
won’t be able to do the progres-
sive things there that he was
able to institute here."

Jack Chapman, senior, this
year‘s president of the Student
G o v e rn m e n t Association,
“President Bowen, in his eight
year tenure at Grinnell, has
brought remarkable progress
to the school. Recent unfortw
nate events have impeded thi'
progress. He’s a great man."

Jim Herzog, formereditor of
the 58:3, “President Bowen”
departure w l l l undoubtedly
slow the school’s academic
process in innovating new pro-
grams and building drives.
However I feel that following
the debate over social struc-
ture of the college, perhaps h s
leaving will open new roads in-
to considering our institution.
Perhaps we can start over to
logically re-evaluate our pro-
gram."

Judy Edquist, junior, new
president of the AWS Board,
“The Contribution that presh
dent Bowen has made to the
academic life of the college is
noteworthy. I hope it will he
continued by his successor.”

Phil Johnson, newly elected
president of SGA, was in Sioux
City last night with the Young
Republicans, and could not be
reached for comment.

 

Other Statements

Following is part of a state—
ment made yesterday by Virgil
M. Hancher, retiring president
of SUI, concerning the appoint-
ment of Dr. Howard Bowen as
his successor:

“Dr. Bowen is a distinguished
economist who has had broad
experience as a professor, a
governmental official, a bank-
ing official, and a college presi-
dent. He has presided with dis-
tinction over Grinnell College
for nearly nine years, in which
position he has achieved state-
wide and national distinction.
He is highly respected by his
collea gu e sin educational
circles, all of whom join in con-
gratulations to him upon his ap~
pointment to the University of
Iowa and in high hopes for the
continued progress of that Uni
versity."

Dr. Bowen and his wife, Lois.
have two grown sons. Peter, 24,
graduated from Lawrence Col-
lege in 1960 and attended the
University of Wisconsin law
school. He is now in the real
estate business in Denver.
Colorado.

Another son, Thomas, 21,
graduated from Grinncll in
1002, and is now studying an
thropoiogy at the UniverSity of
Colorado in Boulder.

A. W. Noehran, president of
the State Board of Regents,
which- yesterday named Presi-
dent Howard R. Bowen as the
Mth president of the State Uni-
versity of Iowa, made the fol-
lowing statement concerning
Dr. Bowen and Grinnell:

“Dr. Bowen had a national
reputation as an educator in
the field of economics before he
was called to Grinnell in 1955.
Under his leadership that col~
lege has advanced considerably
its reputation for scholarship
and sound educational prac-
tices. Both Grinnell and Dr.
Bowen have fully merited the
confidence displayed in them by
the Ford Foundation and other
leading educational agencies."

Mayor Speaks

Dr. Floyd Beaver, mayor
of Grinnell, spoke for the
townspeople last night when
he wished Dr. Bowen well in
his new position.

"We will all miss Dr.
Bowen,” the mayor told the
5&8. “He has been an, asset
to the town and the college
every year that he has been

 

here. We are happy for him
in receiving this new honor.”
