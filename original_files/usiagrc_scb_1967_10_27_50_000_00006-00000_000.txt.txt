changes, the Committee formu-
lated the recommendations and
the Report.

It would not be in error to
Itate that the Committee, soon
after it began its work, formed
the judgment that the educa-
Iional program of the College
was not in any fundamental
lense drastically outdated or out
oi joint; that. in general, stu-
ﬂents were being educated at
the College and that in many
cases students were being edu-
cated rather well.

On the other hand, the Com-
mittee judged there to be a
number of serious problems can-
!ronting the College. These prob-
lems notwithstanding, the Com-
mittee decided not to construct
I new curriculum from scratch.

This decision was reinforced
by the constant remainder that
the portion of the operating bud-
get devoted to educational pur-
poses inevitably conflicts with
other expenditures, both capital
and current, in the process of
assigning priorities. The Com-
mittee also came to understand
the hard reality that the cen-
Iury of history and tradition of
this institution create major in-
ﬂexibilities which constrain
lioth administrative experimen-
tation with the operating budget
and laculty experimentation
.with the curriculum.

For these reasons then the

Imbarrassment in elements of

are strongly emphasized.

1. Dress shirts are correct at-

tire.

2. Ties should be straight and
untwisted, carefully tacked

ceptable. Dark socks which
will stay up are highly
recommended.

'4. Hardsuled shoes are cor-
rect with dark sucks. NO
hush puppies, please!

' Thank you for your coopera-
tion, in these matters. We ap-
preciate the effort involved.

i MEMORANDUM

To: The Faculty and Admin-
lstrative Officers

From: Jim Avison

It has come to my attention
Iﬂday that a notice has been
distributed to the faculty (un-
Iigned) indicating what faculty
Ihouid or shouldn’t wear during
lhe coming weekend.

So far as we can tell, this
notice originated with three in-
maie students. it did not come
horn this oiilce or any other
administrative office. I presume
that this is part of the “game"
some atudento an now playing.

Committee Report, while re
commending major overhauia
in some areas and the develop
ment oi new programs in other
areas, only pushes at the mar-
gins and suggests minor adjust.
merits in a number of areas. in
this sense, the Report recog-
nizes that really new curricula
are developed only at really
new institutions.

While it would be difficult to
isolate the most important
changes recommended in the
Report (tor, indeed, many of
them are interlocking). it is
possible to make a number of
generalizations which will cap-
ture the style of education and
faculty and student academic life
which are implied by the curri-
cular recommendations. I will
do this by listing a number or
propositions which taken in toto
characterize the new directions
implied by the complex at Coma
mittee recommendations:

Proposition 1. There is need
for a new and more straightfor-
ward system by which the Fa-
cuity will administer the edu-
cational programs of the College
to encourage experimentation
in educational policy and pro-
vide for its regular review; to
place responsibility for the op-
eration and supervision of the
underciass General Education
programs on the three di sions
of the College through their Edu~
catinnal Policy Committees; to
encourage divisional concern
for programs which heretoiore
have been considered strictly
departmental; to insure the de
veiopment of uniform standards
and practices oi Comprehensive
Examinations and independent
Study.

Proposition 2. The College, and
especially the staff, should re-
new, update, and increase its
commitment to the general edu-
cation of its students. This new
commitment should be re-
ilected in a reorganization of
general education requirements
centered about the divisional
rtruoture of the College, a new
effort to insure that the courses
included in the general educa-
tion program are designed for
the general student and not the
prospective specialist, is con-
scious effort by the administra-
tion to base both hiring and
other personnel decisions on the
need to establish excellence in
these programs, and an exten-
sion or general education into
the upperclass years.

Proposition 3. The changing
abilities and tastes of those
students attending the College

necessitate the provision of in-
creased opportunities tor inde<
pendent library. laboratory, or

studio work, for oii-campuri
study, for indepth study of a
single subject matter during
any particular semester. and
for the interdisciplinary sludy
of subject matters of contem-
porary relevance.

Basic to this proposition is
the judgment that students, as
they progress through the Col-
lege, should assume increasing
responsihilicy for their own
education.

Proposition 4. To compete with
other institutions of higher
learning in the maintenance of
a highly competent staff. the
College must provide an im<
provement in working condi-
tions for the Faculty, Modiﬁ-
cation in the course load is es‘
sential if the Faculty is to ei-
fectively carry out its growing
non-instructional responsibilities
both to the College and to the
respective proiessions.

Proposition 5. The College has
been and is confronted with a

growing departmental and dies
ciplinary orientation of both its
faculty and its students. This ll
reﬂected in both the depart-
mental curricula and the course

programs. it the College is to
remain true to its liberal tradh
tion this shitt in emphasis
should be retarded if not re
versed.

Proposition 8. The curriculum
or the College currently con-
tains too many courses. Now ll
the appropriate time for the
Faculty to re-study the depart-

mental coursc oiierings with
the goal of streamlining the
program of study in each discip
pline.

Proposition 7. The C oil e g a
should consciously institutional—
ize a style of supervised experie
mentation and innovation in

subject matter offerings. tech
niques of pedagogy, and pro-
grams of study both on- and
oiicampus.
