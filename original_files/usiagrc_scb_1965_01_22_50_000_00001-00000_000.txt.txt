Used Book Coop
Debuts Monday

A Student book coop will be
set up beginning Monday,
Feb. 25. The project, spon-
sored by an SGA committee
is set up as a service for the
campus.

Signe Hansen, chairman of
the committee said, “We felt
there was a need for a service
to provide students with reason-
able and consistent process as
well as a convenient, central lo-
cation for buying and selling
used books," in explaining the
purpose of the coop,

The coop will operate from
Monday until the beginning of
second semester in room 23 of
ARH from 2:30 until 4:00 p.m,
through Friday, If there is suf<
ficlent demand, it will also be
open on Saturdays and for a
week into the second semester.

It will handle books that will
be used for courses next semes-
ter, Miss Hansen explained.
However, she said, a bulletin
board will be provided for
books that are for sale but not
required for courses next se—
mester, The coop will handle
both paper back and hard back
books.

Books will be bought and sold
in three categories, depending
on the condition of the book.
All prices will be based on the
current College Book Store
prices for new books.

Books in excellent condition,
with little or no underlining
will be bought at 70 per cent
of the new price and sold at 85
per cent of the price.

Books in good condition, but
with underlining and writing
will be bought at 55 per cent of
the new price and sold at 70
per cent,

Books in poor condition, with
loose binding, or a consider-
able amount of marking in
them will be bought at 40 per
cent of the new price and sold
at 55 per cent.

Miss Hansen explained that
a certain amount of mark—up is
necessary in order to operate
the coop, and hopefully to con-
tinue it as a seli~supporting,
financially independent open
ation from semester to semes-
ter.

The coop is being run by a
committee, headed by Miss
Hansen, whose members are
volunteering their time. The
other members are Bill Mohr—
man, Paul Thurston, Sue John-
son and Nord Brue.

The operation Will be an over-
thercounter, closed stack busi—
ness, at least in this first se-
mester of its operation, Miss
Hansen said. There will be no
fac' 'ties available for book

Interim Begins Today,
Offers Informal Study

Opportunities for independent
study, group discussion, and
recreation for any number
have been provided for this
year’s interim session running
today through Feb. 7.

Independent study is left to
the student, but much of the
interim time has been set aside
for lectures relating to the in-
terests and needs of the class-
es.

Sophomores are offered a se-
ries of lectures to interrelate
various subjects they have tak-
en as preparation for Junior
Liberal Arts examinations. Pro-
fessor Joseph Schwab of the
University of Chicago will
speak on "What Do Scientists
Do?" next Wednesday, “What
Do Biologists Do?” on Thurs
day, and “What Do Personality
Theorists Say?" on Friday.
These lectures will be followed
by discussions. Richard Cer-
vene (art) and Richard Howe
(music) will talk about what
professional work an artist does
outside the classroom the
morning of Feb. 1. That after-
noon James Kissane (English)
and Raymond Betts (history)
will discuss the professional
work or the humanist. Tuesday,
Feb. 2, Miss Lathrop Beale
(sociology) and Harold Fletch-
er (political science) will talk
about the work of a social sci-
entist and Beryl Clotfelter
(physics) and Guillermo Men-
doza (biology) will explain the
work of natural scientists.

For freshmen, the program
includes two parts. Wayne C.
Booth, professor of Literary
Criticism at the University of
Chicago, will give a series of
lectures on “Modern Litera-
ture as Scripture.” Tuesday,
starts the lectures with ”The
Author as Prophet." “The
Novel of Spiritual Quest" will
be given Wednesday. Thurs-
day‘s lecture, the third and last
oi the group, will be on “What
Can I Make of Such Stuff?”
or, “What to Do Until the Meta
aphysician Comes."

The second part of the fresh-
man program requiring the
reading of the Aeneid will re
late directly to Humanities I
and prepare students for Hu-
manities II and Historical Stud-
ies 1. Monday Feb. 1, Al Jones
(history) and Morris Parslow
(French) will lead discussion;
Tuesday John Crossett (classi-
cal languages) and Edward
Foster (English) will speak,

Seniors have no scheduled
lectures so that they may do—
vote their time to iinal prepara-
tion for their comprehensive
major examinations. Juniors,

 

similarly, will prepare for
their Liberal Arts examina-
tions. Both comps and the JLA
will be given Jan. 3-4.

Economist Granted
Economic $17,000

Robert H. Haveman (econom-
ics) has been awarded a $17,-
000 Brookings Institution re-
search professorship for the
1965-66 academic year.

Haveman received the grant
tor a research project entitled
“An Analysis of the Differen-
tial Impact of Alternative Pub-
lic Expenditures on the Em<
ployment of Labor, Capital, and
Regional Resources."

Haveman will be on leave
from Grinnell during the year
and will begin research on the
project in the summer of 1965.
He will be headquartered in
Washington, D. C.

Primary purpose of Have-
man’s study is to evaluate the
extent to which alternative pub-
lic expenditures draw resources
from among those who would,
in the absence of the expendi-
ture, remain unemployed,

The basic data used in the
study will be project contract
and cost information available
from public records, From this
data, the total direct and indi-
rect demands generated by the
expenditure will be obtained.
With this information, the 101-
lowing questions will be inves-
tigated in three separate
stages:

1. To what extent do the al-
ternative expenditures draw
labor from categories (skills,
occupations) displaying high
levels or unemployment?

2. To what extent do the ex-
penditures require as inputs the
outputs of industry groupings
displaying substantial excess
capacity?

3. What is the impact of the
alternative expenditures by
type and location on the utiliza<
tion of regional resources?

Haveman, a member of tho
Grinnell faculty since 1962,
holds a 1958 B. A, degree from
Calvin College and a 1963 PI],
D, from Vanderbilt University.
