Roberts Rules Of Disorder

There 1 was, sitting in my one-armed stuiied chair,
a hall a six pack still cooling, the other one and a
halt iorrning the foundation tor a pyramid. My
Foreign Policy in the sixties lay against the wall,
its broken spine cocked at nearly right angles to the
ilcor.

i cut my thumb popping another top. Spilled some
or it, too. On the newspaper. “19 Year Old Killed
in Cong Ambush” was the headline.

I turned over my roommate's new Simon and Gar-
funkel record, closed the Window, and lay down on
the bed.

The kid had been from down South somewhere.
South Carolina I think. He'd been the only one in
his outtit to get it. The paper had talked with his
parents. They said they were very sad that he was
dead but knew that he would want them to be proud
of him and that they were proud of the job he'd
done.

The kid next door came charging in to use the
phone. "You drinking on a week night? Boy, it must

be great to he an upperrclassman and not have any
responsibility.” He ordered his fourteen inch onim‘l
pizza and [W0 Mountain Dews and leltvleaving the
door open.

I got off the bedA-to close the door and add tho
can to my pyramid. The ireshrneu were playing
hockey in the hall—using broom and a copy oi
some book they had just finished in humanities. I
told them they were making too much noise.

Nineteen years old. Two years younger than i.
The same age as my brother. 1 grabbed another
cold beer and then managed to knock over my pyra-
mid. '

Ninteen years old and he was getting up each daai
worrying about staying alive. He woke up knowin.
that he’d be going out where they wanted him dead.
1 wake up each morning and my big decisions are
to shave or not to shave; to go to religion class or
not; to start the day with beer or coffee, Someday:
I don't even get up.

And he got up and got killed. I’ll get up with a cut
thumb and a hangover.

 

Iowa Computer Plays Matchmaker

Recruiting Studem‘s

 

 

As Siudenis Discover Ideal Dale

Tomorrow night Grinnell will
have its first Computer Date night.
The night': events include a bad-
ketball game With Monmouth echo
dule for 7: 30, a movie, “The Easy
Life," at 10 o'clock, and a dance
in North Lounge at 9: . The band
will be the Larry Allison Trio from
William Penn College and until
11 o'clock, only those with comput—
er cards will be admitted to the
dance.

The computer card: will bu
placed in the mailboxes late to.
night. Each card will contain only
the name of the personality most
like the owner of the card. There
will be no opposite named since it
would be too hard ﬁnding one‘l
opposite among the 655 other parti-
cipants. Instead, names of two oth-
or individuals most nearly matched
with a student will be placed in
the mailboxes several days later.

Twenty-three students were not
matched up because oi improper
storing, no name on the sheet or
a missing sheet, or because they
did not tablilale their results.

The program procedure for the
matching was handled by the Uni-
versity of Iowa. Since the comput-
er Could only handle 300 personali-
ties at once, the 686 names were
divided into three nearly equal
groups; the division was made by
height so that usually the boy will
be a couple or inches taller than
the girl. The computer then select-
ed couples mnst nearly alike and
two other like personalities of tho

opposite sex for each of the two
individuals. The computer was not
able to match a larger group than
three for each student because of
its limited program.

Door prizes will in given at the
dance to the couples most alike in
scores.

For Studies Abroad

in its second year, the Associated
Colleges oi the Midwest ngmm
of Field Studies in Central Americ-
is underway and already recruiting
students to participate next iail.

The program otters ACM stu<
dents an opportunity for tield res
search experience in the tropics.
Areas or study include biology.
archeology. anthropology. sociol-
ing)!r economics and geography.
Students will be supervised by I
stat! of scientists, both resident
and ACM visitors. The program
headquarters are in Costa Rica.
and students may work anywhere
in Central America, An enticing
aspect is the independent research
project undertaken by each stu-
dent, who has much latitude ill
choice and may avail himseli or
tutorial help. Two additional at-
tractions are the chance to livo
with a native ismiiy and the pub.
lication at all projects. Students
may earn up to a full semester's
credit for six months or a year'l
credit for a twelve month sojourn
with the program. The amount oi
credit is contingent upon the work
accomplished.

Gi'innell sludents who particl-
pated during 1964435 were Willard
Van Horn, Jeri Langham, and
John Pojman. The diversity at the
program is well illustrated by
Langham's and Pojman‘s respet‘n
tive projects — Langham doing a
statistical analysis of sites irons
aerial photographs, and Pojmaia
pericrming experiments in hog
ieeding. Langham's cartographic
study is being used by the army.

in Costa Rica now are Nancy
Moritz, Charles Schnell, and Paul
Thurston.

Person: interested in applying
{or next {all should see Robert
Voertman (economics) before
spring vacation.
