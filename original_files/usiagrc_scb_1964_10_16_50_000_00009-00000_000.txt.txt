) Trust and Respect

Continued from Page 2

is the knowledge and experience
of living in a society. This is
what some people mean by a
liberal education, but unfortu-
nately Carleton’s definition of
the phrase does not yet describe
What I have. in mind, A liberal
education must refer to consid-
erably more than a particular
curriculum plan. Our strongest
memories of college might very
well be of events and experi-
ences outside the classroom.

>‘r its a

WE LEARN THE MOST
about ourselves and me world
when we are forced to make
value judgments and sacrifice
for others while trying to
achieve our personal goals at
the same time. This experience
is the simplest yet the most pro-
found of educators, The world
is composed of artists, law~
yers, doctors, and engineers,
but the most respected men in
the professions are often those
with the most acute understand-
ing of themselves and society.
The goal of our four'years at
Carleton is that whatever pro-
fession we choose, our experi-
ence here will somehow magic-
ally transform us into better
people, I have yet to meet this
wise and potent magician.

The only way to harvest
apples is to grow an orchard.
We need to plant some trees. I
indicated that Carleton is not
yet the kind of college where
this personal and social growth
can be best fostered. But the
possibility for it does exist and
we, the student body, can play a
major role in making Carleton
a better college. We are small
enough to make the concept of
a community practicable yet
large enough to provide a hete-
rogeneous and exciting group of
people. We must be our own

magician.
a n st

IF WE ARE TO GROW as
people and not just as students
we lnust CDnSlde!‘ ourselves as
part of a community, a group
of individuals who consent to
work together, Any community
must be built on trust and mu-
tual respect, something more
than the high regards of a stu-
dent for a knowledgeable prae
fessor or of a professor for an
excellent student. Our commu-
nity must be broad enough to
include different interests as
well as different viewpoints.

What Carleton needs most is
a group of students willing to

 

recognize the validity if not the
wisdom of college policies, stu-
dents with high ideals Willing to
spend the time and effort to
turn their ideals into practice,
and above all, students who are
willing to work with each other
and with the administration. We
must convince the faculty and
the administration that we are
capable of forming college pol-
icy as well as voicing our pro-
test. We must be militant when
the need arises. we must con-
tinue to make our presence felt.
But if we are serious about
what we are saying we must do
more.»We must come up with
new ideas that will accomplish
what we’re after and satisfy the
total community at the same
time. This is not impossible. in
making their statement on the
r e li g i 0 us requirement the
Trustees placed a great deal of
faith in the student body, If we
play our cards right the future
can be even brighters

A special Student-Faculty»Ad—
ministration Council Chaired
jointly by President Nason and
by the CSA President, is now
discussing ways in which stu-
dent government can play a
larger role in the college, Our
student government must be
prepared to assume greater re—
sponsibility. CSA committees
should investigate the curricu-
lum, the grading system and
whatever other areas pose
problems, They must work
closely with administration and
faculty groups. While our past
experience has shown that we
can work for change successful-
ly, we have also learned that
success Wlll not come unless all
three campus factions agree to
act together, to share a trust in
each other and to believe that
change can mean progress.

AT THE PRESENT TIME
our student government is
weak. Individual students acts

‘ ing through CSA have been able

to accomplish a surprising
amount but the student govern-
ment itself is almost powerless.
The big decisions on the campus
are made Without its participa-
tion. There are several things
we can do on our own within
CSA to make it better but our
main task will be to prove to
the administration that we are
capable of making a greater
and more Vital contribution to
the maintenance and develop»
ment of the college. This year
more than ever before our sucs
cesses and failures will indicate
the role we will play in college
government.
