The 1M Basketball struggle
saw a series of titantic clashes
of epic proportions, and when the
debris cleared, Read retained
sole possession of first place in
the overall standing This haps
penstance was due to a couple
of Read victories over the
Norrises, and also because
Cowles took two from Haines to
knock them from a tie for first.
Outside shooting by Bill Dicks
and Grant Little (3 timthonored
formula for IM victory) proved
overwhelming to Haines. The
Read machine rolled on -— what
can you say about a 12935 Victory
over West A team? This one saw
Read score 46 points before West
Read starters hit ior 20 points
or more, with Ed Hirsch (acV
curate. and yet humble) hitting
for 27, The West team showed
a lot of class by not givtng up
in the face of this barrage.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Returni

By Roger Rowe

The Grinnell Pioneers fought
back last Weekend after a
disastrous road triprto claim two
victories in basketball from their
Wisconsin rivals, Lawrence and
Ripon, In both games the margin
of victory was provided by clutch
performances in the second half.

Trailing by a single point to
Lawrence at the intermission
Friday night, the Pioneers
spurted ahead at the outset of
the second half to take the contest
73-64. It was about the same story
Saturday, as the cagers were
deadlocked 31-31 until they pulled
away in a bitterly fought contest
to take their first win over Ripon
in six years, 64-56.

Early in the second half with
the team trailing and with
scoring leader Bob Burnett
sidelined with four fouls, Greg
Beckman, a junior forward took
control of the game to swing it

name, however has been unr
accountaoly and permanently
lost to us. Our only meagre hint
as to his identity is that he
himself seemed to have been uns
certain of his identity, and that
he made it his subsequent life’s
work to discover it, Unfor-
tunately, The Man Without
Enemies never did find out just
who he might be, cwtng to the
fact that everyone he met was
too kindly disposed towards him
to let him know.

Friends, we live in a wonderful
Universe, chock-full to the beams
and rafters with nuneUnicorns,

Friday, March o, 1970

g Netmen Win,
Picking lip Two in Darby

in Grinnell's favor. Beckman
scored 22 points and hauled in
19 all-important rebounds to lead
the team in both departments.
Most importantly, to of these
points and 13 rebounds came in
the closing stanza. Burnett
finished With 18 points, Hanson
with 12, and Johnson with 10 to
round out Grinnell’s Well-
balanced doublerfigure scoring.

On Saturday, it was again
Beckman who provided the initial
impetus in the second half
againsta physically stronger and
more aggressive Ripon squad.
Pouring in eight straight points,
he helped the Pioneers pull away
from the 31731 lie to a 39735 lead.
Unhindered on Saturday by
personal iouls, Burnett claimed
a major part of the action with
19 points, most oi them in the
'second half.

Scott Hanson led the team with
10 hard-fought rebounds, but to

no avail: Ripon outgrabbed us
47-38 in this department. Beck-
man finished up with 18 points
and 9 rebounds, with Hanson
putting in 18 points and Burnett
3.

However, the most significant
difference between the teams
was in accuracy. Grinnell sank
50 per cent of its floor shots, while
the Redmen could only net 28 per
cent in the second half, The
stronger Bad Guys continually
got more than one shot on each
visit to the goal, but singly they
were unable to get their range.

On the strength oi their
weekend sweep the Pioneers
upped their record to 7-9 in the
conference and 8-12 overall. This
assures them of their best record
since 1964, when they went as
and 12-10.

Only two games remain in their
schedule as the Pioneers travel
to Cornell this Tuesday and then
to Knox a week later.

Tankmen Sink Cornell
Capture“ Billy The Duck"

By Reggie Graham

Last Friday’s meet against

defending conference champion
Cornell provided an excellent
iinish to a perfect season (the
first for Grinnell in eleven
years). About fifty Grinnellians
made the trip to Mt. Vernon to
watch us beat Cornell G7 to 37
and Win “Dilly the Duck” for the
best dual meet record.

Reggie Graham

Our very own 0b Squad
provided entertainment between
events and managed to alienate
the Cornell team and fans with
its unusual repertoire of cheers.
The whole team thanks everyone
that come; we are glad we were
able to make the trip a rewarding
one,

Our medley relay (Ron
Brammer, Bruce McKean, Jim
Williams, and Bruce Rollins)
began the meet with its usual fine
performance, swimming a 3:565

for a pool record, just short of
our school record. Mike Daley
swam a good 200 freestyle
(1:54.41) and later broke his
school record and set a pool
record in the 5006.23.41).

Steve Ward swam a fantastic
2:116 individual medley for a
school record, Ken Glass of
Cornell (last year’s champ) won
the diving with a pool record oi
235 points.

Bruce Rollins won the fifty and
100 yard freestyle events, tying
the school record in the latter
(50.1). At 50,3, just touched out
by Bruce, was Steve Ward, with
his best time of the year,

I-Ial Dale won his year's best
in the butterfly, and Jim
Williams did an excellent ioh to
win the backstroke (he missed
every one of his seven turns, but
he won anyway, which was the
important thing)

This week, apprehensive but
confident, we travel to the grand
finale, the conference meet, at
Northfield, Minn. All ten Midwest
Conference schools will be there
vying for the coveted conference
champion title and trophy, Our
biggest competition will be
Carleton (whom We beat here,
Feb. 6). The team is in great
shape and ready for the big meet;
Carleton shouldn’t be much of a
problem. And the rest should be
easy.
