Impressions of Grinnell [A Review]

I can only wail.

and waiting

for Class to begin,

I sit here

and just wait.

not able to cope
with my waste

or even with

my hope. my sense,

Many are the hours
wasted in waiting,
waiting in waste,
wading in wait

hi this time,

or that place.

morning coffee
at the lorum

Doing, going.
thinking, buying.

Many are the men

who sit and wall

Ind wait with drink in hand
to take a sip

at coffee or of lemonade

or mist or studying

Drink helps the day go down,

THE VARSITY

For paperbacks, mag-

smoking supplies, to-
bacco, candy, pop, rec-
ords, beer, newspapers
and assorted 0 t It 8 r
goodies.

the hours tly,
the minutes pass,
and time seem
more ﬂuid.

Glasses, cups, and spoons
sit atop tables

and return the vacant stares
of waking students.

Pain “as still, in Wall,

to waive, again, their aches
when they begin their walks
to classes they’d rather not.

Have another cup of coffee
before you leave;

it will help

your day go down.

Back to the forum
write a letter to
one departed:

Karen,

It's 8:05

in the Far" m
really alive
And here I am

a ruddy calipll
entertaining

some girl in Calif.
Water tastes hard
same as usual

50's the coffee
after swm perusals
SGA convention‘s over
who knows how—
fol' I was sleeping
jelly hopping
bumble heaping

Now that you‘re
an independant ‘
project from
Gi-innell,

oi sorts,

you can view
the campus wholly
be perceptive
be perspective

How’s it lee]

my little laugh

of the news press set

How’s it seem
gone away

beyond the Rex

Here comes Mr. Crossett
now

through the door
five persons
playing pool

or more

How's I! seem
beyond all this
gone away
beyond the Rex

.Illlem hack here

to buy an apple

to sit and think
remain subtle
Within the huddle
of men an‘
dodertants

boys an' stones
and picky girls
and itching women

then to the hall

Close the door

throw my shoes

against the wall

and count the day
discount its thoughts

and have one glass

of tang and nestle’s quick.

and so I took her
by the hand

and swung her round
and round

and tossed her of!
to never isle

she never made it.
