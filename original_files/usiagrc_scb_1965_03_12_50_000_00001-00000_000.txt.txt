Activity Fund Allotment Cut 8%:
Hartl Claims SOiZidi Plans Suffer

Second semester budget allor-
merits from the activity fee
fund were made this week —
with an eight per cent across-
therboard cut.

The college activity fee,
which this year is $20 per stu
dent per semester, is budgeted
by SGA to social funds. student
government, and publications.
Though the budget is planned
for the entire year, the allot.
ments are made by semester,
since the student fees are pay-
able by semester.

The eight per cent cut “was

necessitated by a larger drop
in enrollment than was antici:
pated plus a series of unexr
pected expenditures and stu-
dent administrational errors,”
according to Milton Tootle.
student auditor.
.. When asked about the cut,
Phil Johnson. SGA president,
said that it had been caused by
a drop in enrollment larger
than had been planned for,

Tootle explained that the sec-
ond semester activity fee check
for $21,340 was $760 less than
had been estimated when the
budgeting was done, because

. of the enrollment drop. The
budget also expected to use $1,-
160.71 from the General Bud-
get and Reserve fund, but ex»
penses from first semester had
brought the balance of the
GBBzR down to where this was
not possible. Thus, the cut was
called fort

The regular budget is worked
out each spring by the Execu-
tive Cabinet, in consultation
with the recipients of the ac-
tivity fee allotments, and it is
then approved by the Student
Senate, ‘

Last spring, when the budget
was worked out, it was done

 

assuming an 33 per student in-
crease in the activity fee, This
increase was not approved by
the Trustees, when they, met
over the summer. Thus, when
the SGA officials returned to
campus this fall, they had to
re-work the entire budget.

It was at this time that the
funds from GB&R Were bud-
geted to the fund which the ac»
tivity ree usually covers alone.

Hardest hit ill this Cut have
been the social funds. Palmer
Hart], social Coordinator, said
that the cut would definitely af-
fect the social program for the
rest of the year, but that it is
impossible at this time to de-
termine just which areas will
be affected most.

Hartl added, however, that
“the magnitude of Spring Day
activities will depend on the

. Unopposed, Goddard Ascends to Helm;
Discloses Student Government Goals

Gerald Goddard, junior political
science major, was elected SGA
President yesterday in an uncon-
tested vote.

Goddard outlined the following
objectives for student govcrnmcnt.

"Student government should ox.

These residents can benefit the

“Student enforcement of the
disorderly conduct and damage to
college property regulations of the
college should he increased.

“Student government should in-
vestigate the possibility or expand-
ing the present open-house pro-

ram, either in the direction of
increasing the numhcr of hall op.
tions or of broadening the weekly
program. Progress on other cam.
puses indicates that Grinnell need
no longer worry about being the
vanguard in this iron.

“The role of student government
in promoting interest in national
and international affairs should be
expanded. A regular channel
might be worked out with NSA and
Inc to investigate possihle student
action before presenting proposals
to the advisory council.

“Greater use should he made of

in SGA. These sessions can intorm

Ike's Visit Set
For May 13-14

Former President Dwight
Eisenhower Will definitely visit
Grinnell May 1314. This event
will give the college the un-
usual distinction of being the
only college east or west of the
Mississippi to have been visit-
ed by all the living exAPresi-
dents of the United States in
two successive years. The
highlight of last year’s PPPE
program was a visit by Presi-
dent Harry Truman.

Confirmation of the Eisen-
hower visit was received last
week from his aide. However,
travel plans are still uncertain.
If the President arrives by
plane he will be accompanied
by his valet and his aide. Mrs.
Eisenhower will accompany
the President if he travels by
rail.

During his visit, Eisen-
hower will participate in both
the politician-in-residence and
political lectureship programs
of the PPPE. He will attend
a press conference, deliver an
address in Darby, be initiated
into one of the men’s halls, and
attend meals and coffee hours
with students. The evening lec-
ture is tentatively ”Politics is
Too Important to ba Left to
the Politicians."

In announcing the schedule,
Edwin Gilmour (political sci-
ence) stressed both the
achievement of the PPPE in
obtaining both eXePresident's
in two years, and the benefits
to the college.

After the May Visit, the only
question will be: Where do we
go from here? All the way with
LBJ?
