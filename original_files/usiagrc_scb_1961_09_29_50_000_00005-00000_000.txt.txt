ei- Bowen had written Ford as
to "How 1 Would Spend a Mil-
lion Dollars,“ and a 125-pagc
application had been ﬁlcd with
the Foupdation.

Following a visit here last
winter by a Foundation reprc»
senlative, a meeting was held
between the Board of Trustees
and Foundation oilicials At this
time the possibility of a $2 mil.
lion grant was raised.

Official notiﬁcation as to
which colleges had been select.
ed for the awards did not come
until last Friday afternoon when
a rou page release was wired
to Gr ncll from the Founders
tion.

Bowen explained that Grin
nell received the funds because
it has excelled without great
endowments. Grinnell ranks, he
said, as a school wlnch will
produce the best returns in edu—
cational beneﬁts from the Founv
dation’s investment.

The President said the a.
ward will he used to launch
a sour-part spending program
which includes $450,000 per
year earmarked ror regular
operating expenses; $375,000
each year in addition to
permanent endowments, S400,-
000 per year for a special edu-
cational opportunity rund and
‘another sxso,000 per year to
ﬁnance a building program.

Explaining the educational op-
portunity fund, Bowen said it
would be used, as opportunit' s
occurred, to ﬁnance special prol-
acts or activities to enl'ich- the
college’s academic eiiort.
fund might be used roi such
purposes as the acquisition or
scientiﬁc equipment otherwise
out of reach, to expand the coin
lege’s collection or art objects,
to ﬁnance additions to the li.
brary, to employ distinguished
visiting professors and to back
studentefaculty research. All this
will be in addition to the al-
ready planned increase in fan—
ulty salaries and aid to stu—
dents.

Outlining the building pro—
gram, he said that preliminary

plans [or a new student union-X

recreation complex may be

started this rail. other building‘

projects which may be possible

dormitories for men and for
,women and remodeling jobs on
a number of campus buildings.
including Darby gym, Steiner,
Good'now and Carnegie halls.
