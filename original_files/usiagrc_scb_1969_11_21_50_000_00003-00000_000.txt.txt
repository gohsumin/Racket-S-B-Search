EDITORIAL 7
censors»

What you are reading may not be what I am
writing. You see, if I use certain words that the man
who owns the printing press doesn’t like, he’ll cut
them out before you even have a chance to read
them and decide for yourself whether or not they’re
appropriate.

That’s what happened last week. The man who
owns the printing press didn’t like a certain Word
in my editorial, so he simply deleted it before the
S&B went to press. He didn‘t even bother to phone
me about it; he just cut it out,

The editorial you saw last week said “Stop the
War.” But the one I originally wrote included a
word describing the War. It was a seven-letter word
that rhymes with “ducking.” The man who owns
the printing press didn’t like that word.

The man who owns the printing press is E. K.
Shaw. E. K. Shaw is the publisher of the Newton
Daily News, the company that prints the S&B. E. K.
Shaw is also the sensor of the 5&8 ~ the man who
decides what you will be allowed to read.

I went to see E. K. Shaw yesterday to find out
why he cut out that certain word. E. K. Shaw ex-
plained, ”That word is dirty." (E. K. Shaw care-
fully avoided using ”that word” throughout our
conversation.)

I asked E. K. Shaw if he believes in freedom of
the press and freedom of expression. He replied,
“Yes, but I’m not going to print filthy words in my
shop."

I wasn‘t quite satisfied with E, K. Shaw’s ex-
planation, so I gave it one last fling and bluntly ask~
ed him, “What is dirty about ‘that word‘?”

E . K. Shaw turned red and sputtered, “May-
be someday when you're older you’ll understand
why that word is dirty."

I decided at that point that I didn’t want to talk
to E. K. Shaw any longer, so I left. I’m already a
day older, but I still don’t understand why ”that
word" is dirty. Maybe I’ll have to reach E. K.
Shaw’s age before I understand,

I do think I’m old enough to understand that
E. K. Shaw is part of a system that denies true free-
dom of the press to those who don’t own one. I am
also old enough to understand that E. K. Shaw is
part of a system that is. totally irrational in its re-
action to what it calls “obscenity,” I am old enough
to understand that E. K. Shaw is part of a system
that is suppressing Pterodactyl and underground
papers throughout the nation, and I’m old enough
to understand that that system kills off the Lenny
Bruces and will do its damnest to snuff out anybody
who strongly dissents from it.

I suppose E. K. Shaw will never understand
some of the things I do about the system of which
e is a part. I just hope that E. K. Shaw is young
enough that he’ll still be around to watch his system
crumble.
