Poll Students an ideal President

Students in the newswriting
journalism course recently took
a poll among various students
concerning their attitudes to-
ward “the ideal college presi-
dent." Below are some of the
answers received:

Ted Lemaire, freshman, Lan-
gan: “Based on What I have
heard as a freshman, I think
the new president should be an-
other President Eowen. This is.
he should continue the policy of
improving Grinnell in itself, the
faculty and the program. rath-
er than adding many new
buildings."

N a n c y Morse, freshman,
Meats, ”The new president
should be a firm upholder of
the rules and policies of the
college. He should be friendly
and able to get out and meet
the students in order to dis-
cuss campus problems with
them.”

Tom Hartman, sophomore,
Langan, “i feel that his back-
ground should be in school and
business administration. He
should be strong enough to
keep old policies that have
served well in the past, but he
should also be willing to bring
in good new ideas. He should
make compromises between
student demands and needs,
and the reputation and ideals of
the college. Most important. he
should have the ability to work
with people.

Judy Mandelbaum, sopho-
more, Loose: “He should have
a policy of non-intervention in
student affairs, and should stick
to the basic task as mediator
between alumni and trustees.
He should in no way try to pro-
ject an image of Grinnell col-
lege or I typical Grinnell stu-
dent, He should be an educator
from an eastern school. Most
important, he should be aware
of the importance of individual-
ism in education. and treat siu<
dents as adults:"

Candy Rogers. junior.
James: "The new president
should be a threeainone man.
He should be an educator, a
businessman, and a public rela-
tions man. He should continue
to press former President Bow-
en’s plan for increased em-
phasis on learning and de-
creased emphasis on grades in
order to take competitive pres-
sure off the students.”

Wade Stevenson. senior. Lant
gen: “This is a very difficult

question to answer without
sounding nonrcomlnittal, but I
think the new president should
be fair, and yet firm. He must
be a man who draws on past
experiences, and also looks to
the future. He should hold the
interests of everyone in the
Grinnell College Community."

Ruth Unruh, senior. James:
“He should be a Midrwesterner
who has been educated in the
east. In this way he will have
both eastern flare, and Mid-
western hometown goodness.
He should be scholarly, but not
pedantic. He should be inter-
ested in the students, but should
interfere with them as little as
possible, and of course he
should continue the tradition of
academic excellence at Grin—
nell."

A of ta Free, sophomore,
Read: “The president’s main
obligation is insuring that
Grinnell fulfills its obligation
as a liberal arts college. That
means he'd have to be a man
devoted to the principles of a
liberal education, He should
also stay home more than Dr.
Bowen.” ’

Henry Wilhelm, freshman,
North Younkier: “The next
president should be a man who
is in tone wim reality as it ex-
ists today and who does not
fear new trends and new ideas
and who does not fear to imple-
ment these new trends and
ideas."

C h u c k Wall, sophomore.
North Younker: The next pres-
ident should be well-educated
and well-known in educational
circlss. He should also be con-
servative to more accurately
reflect the feelings of the board
of Trustees as well as to coun-
ternct the effect of a liberal
dean of men."

Randy Morgan, senior, West
Norris: “The next president
should have a magnetic person-
ality and should be a man who
could properly represent Grin<
nell off<campus The president’s
first obligation should be to the
Grinnell campus, however, and
he should have a more intimate
working knowledge of what ac-

tually is happening at the
school." -

Rod Owen, junior, North
Younker: “The next president
should be from 35-40 years old.
for it is in that age that the
president would have the best
combination of maturity and

he did. is pure idiocyi This
and freshman goes on to say
that he is bothered by the con-
stant question of “What are you
doing tonight, honey.” while he
is obviously attempting to study
at Burling Library. Perhaps if
he studied in his room in his
hall he wouldn't notice this, or
if he listened for the answer
to this annoying question, very
likely he would hear this, “l’m
studying for my classes tomoiu
row,” which is certainly a more
often heard Comment than the
one he quotes, and is undoubt-
edly an academic answer. This
sad freshman puts the yoke of
immaturity around his own
neck when he says that it is his
hope that his letter will chang-

the whole spirit on the campus;
he had better remember that
around here, the upperclass—
men are the leaders, and are
not to be led, especially by
this.

Finally. this sad freshman
denies us the privilege of know
ing him. 1 think perhaps this is
an indication that he is not so
sure he is right in his asser-
tions. 1, and 1 hope, you, take
as bunk any unsigned letter
which advocates reform, if the
reformer doesn't have enough
guts to show himself. I hope
this sad freshman will [recon-
sider his attitudes, and I call
upon my own class to lead him
to a new, mature conscious
mess. I frankly think he has
been reading too many college
catalogues.

openrmindedness. A man much
older than that would tend to
have fairly Well solidified ideas
and wouldn't be flexible enough
for Grinnell."

Alan Bernhardt, freshman,
Langan: “I should like a presir
dent who would strive to un<
derstand the students' prob-
lems by circulating throughout
the campus, talking to students
and professors and who would
do his best to correct any sit~
uation where there were prob-
lems."

Jacquie Morgan, sophomore.
Loose: “The new president of
Grinnell must be more than a
good administrator; he must
be able to communicate with
the student body. He must
command the respect of stu-
dents and encourage their par-
ticipation in student govern-
ment,"

Jim Stoddart, senior. Clark:
"The Grinnell president should
be vitally interested in the
process of liberal education, un-
derstanding its broader aspects
While retaining respect for its
various fields. He has to be a
parent, a money collector, an
arbitrator, a statesman. a schol—
ar, and ‘one of the guys) ”

Jane Guild, junior, Cleveland:
“We need a president with a
leadership and administrative
ability which commands great
respect and which, at the same
time, enables him to work
closely with and listen to the
ideas of students.”

Nancy Coulson, freshman,
Read: “He should be close to
the students, but not so close
that they consider him a friend
more than they admire him as
a president.”

Jeff Burnlnm, junior. Gates:
“He must be an administrator
In intellectual with diverse in-
terests. and a fund raiser. Tile
president must be a mediator
who does not lose himself in
compromise nor lose his au<
thority over the faculty. stu-
dents and trustees, On the oth-
er hand, he must be able to in-
corporate his goal for Grin-

Anne Young, senior, Haines:
“Naturally, he must be an in-
tellectual. He must have per
sonal eminence apart from the
college, must be an administra-
tor, and, I hate to say it, a fund
raiser. He must be at ease in
front of groups praising this
college. He must be able to
mediate disputes between fac-
ulty. students, trustees, and
parents; in short, he needs the
finesse of a labor-management
arbitrator. He should also have
a working philosophy of the lib-
eral arts college apart from

tion."

Kerry Miller, sophomore.
Cowlea: "The president should
be able to handle the biggest

icntion, He should be aware that
the students of Grinnell are

born during and after the war.

You begin, then, to “educate"
your taste so that you reach
instinctively for fruit instead of
cake. With the stress on “bal-
