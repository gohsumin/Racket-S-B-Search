All
it

By Paul Trigg

The 1964 college football season ended over Christmas
vacation with the numerous bowl games, and although Ala-
bama’s Joe Namath gave the most outstanding individual per-
formance and Texas the outstanding team performance, I
think the Rose Bowl story carried the biggest moral. In that
game a very good Michigan team soundly throttled Oregon
State 34-7i Michigan showed a well-balanced team with a
hard charging line, solne talented backs, and great depth
The out-manned Beavers never really had a chance.

The key to the story, however, was the post-game com-
ment by Michigan quarterback Bob Timberlake to the effect
that many of Michigan’s Big Ten opponents this season had
been superior to Oregon, (On their schedule this would
presumably mean Purdue, Ohio State, Michigan State, 11-
linois, perhaps Minnesota, and even Northwestern, whom Mich-
igan beat 35-0 but who defeated Oregon State 7-3.) Although
Californians are arguing that the best coast team, Southern
Cal, was not playing in the game, and although we must
not forget that great USC team of a few years ago; this game
proved that the Big Ten still plays a considerably better brand
of football than the West Coast.

Speaking of the Big Ten, their conference basketball
race got off and running this week, as did most of the
major conferences across the country. It seems as though
the Big Ten may be stronger than usual this year. There are
several excellent teams which could make a run for the title,
As of last week four conference teams, Michigan, Minnesota,
Indiana and Illinois were ranked in the top ten. Michigan
and Minnesota both have faltered somewhat in pre-conference
action, and will have to improve to fend off the challenges
of Indiana and Illinois. Ohio State, Purdue, Northwestern
and, believe it or not, Iowa could pull a few upsets. For my
own picks, I choose Michigan to win the Big Ten with Min-
nesota and Illinois close and UCLA to repeat as national
champion.
