AI LeMoyne . . .

o
This semester marks the fourth

that the student exchange pro-
gram between Grinnell and Les
Hoyne College in Memphis, Ten-
nessee, has been in existence.
Since its inception in September,
£64, nine students from Gi'innell
and eight from LeMoyne have
taken advantage of the program

&The ﬁve Grinnellians at Le-
Moyne this semester are‘ Richard
Lance, a junior; Amy Rossman,
.sophomore; Janet Poland, a soph-
omore; Linda Thomas, a sopho-
more; and Pat Stern, a junior.

. Registration for the semester
uegan yesterday and will be cons
eluded today. classes will begin
Monday, the (list, and will end the
ﬂast week of May

Cottage, a girls on-campus dorm.

pus apartment vacated by Myron
Lowry, one of the LeMoyne stu-
.dents spending the semester here.

Although it is generally some—
what warmer in Memphis than it
,is in iowa, freezing Grinnellians
needn’t be envious. The arriving
students were greeted at LeMoyne
by four inches of snow and sub-
Ireezing temperatures. which,
though perhaps not a welcome
sight, must have certainly been a
,tamillar one,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Havord Bishop

Anita Curry

- AI Grinnell . . .

Four LeMoyne students arrived
at Grinnell Tuesday, January 18.
They are Havord Bishop, Myron
Lowry, Barbara Jo Wilson, and
Anita Curry.

Bishop, a junior biology major,
is living in Smith. Bishop says he
finds Grinnell very different so-

crally from LeMoyne. The Mem-
phis school, he says, has only about
half Grinnell's enrollment, 'and
they all come from the same area.

a. Bishop sees advantages and draw-

backs to Grinnell’s size and the
wide diiierenees among its stu-
dents. “At LeMuyne the students
otten come to have closer rela-
tionships,” he says.

Lowry is a sociology major. He
is a sophomore and will spend his
Grinnell semester in East Norris.

Also a sociology major is sopho-
more Miss Curry. She and Miss
Wilson, a chemistry major, both
live in Loose. This is the first dor-
mitoiy experience for the two
girls and both find it “marvee
loils."

“I wouldn't trade dul'm life for
anything in the world!" Miss Wil-
Son commented,

Adjusting to the climate was a
trick for the Southerners. “At
first it was unbearable, but I seem

to have been able to adapt," Bis-
hop said. Mill Wilson added “The

 

people are so warm that I can’t
detect the coldness.”

dents. It contains such items as
the history of the draft, the record
of Amherst students ‘in the mili-
tary, the students' willingness to
serve, and how to get out of the
draft. .

Approximately two-thirds of the
students ielt “a personal obliga-
tion to serve the country in either
the armed iorces or through such
alter-natives as the Peace Corps.”
Many others commented that “I
ieel an obligation to humanity, but
not just to this ‘holy Country’ l’,
or “I feel I could be of more use
Outside of institutionalized alters
natives.” But 92 per cent indicat—
ed a willingness to serve it it were
absolutely necessary.

The attitudes of Amherst men
towards the draft varied from the
Nathan Hale concept of patriotism
to the paciiist attitude. or those
polled who were in favor or serv-
ing the country were also plan-
ning to avoid this draft for as
long as possible. Eighty-five per-
cent were plonning on graduate
school. Views expressed in this re-
gard were: “I was planning to
talte two years off and bum
around, but now I’ll have to go
to grad school," “There are a lot
of unemployed people who could
iulfill my draft requirements,"
and ”I don‘t Want to‘serve, but
it dralted, going to jail would not
be in the interests of my career."

About eight per cent at Amherst
students were contemplating eith-
er non » cooperation or conscien-
tious objection. This was about a
hundred students, but most (3.0.
students received the student sta-

The structure itself has great pn-

A major point of discussion
throughout the meeting was that
the new Council oi House Presi-
dents might work it there is good
leadership. Someone else suggest—
ed, however, that the Senate, if
given good leadership also, could
work and be an eiiective part of

student government, too.
