”We did suggest alternative
grading systems such as having
no formal grades at all. This
creates a problem with our re—
lations with graduate schools
“A system which keeps grades
but doesn't reveal them to the
students was discussed, ‘

“We nlso debated the merits
oi the “D" grade in tho pres—

ent system It was decided
that the D grade is given for
three reasons.

(1) As a favor to the student.

(2) As an indication that a
student does have the ability
to go on in a course sequence

the present level is not sat-
isfactnry.

(3) As credit for hard work
Even when lack oi ability is
evident , . .

"The main angurnent against
the “D" grade was that a siu~
dent should not be given credit
for work that is not satisfactory

““A' vote was taken in the]

committee at was six tor abol-
ishing this grade, {mum for keep-
ing it, and three ahstentions.

be taught both to learn meth—

empirical knowledge?

students, and perhaps faculty,
do not have a clear idea of just
what these core courses are ny—
ing to accomplish or what they
might otherwise try to accom-
plish . . . . it was generally
agreed that students should be
made aware or the conceptual
problems of these courses and
the debate going on about how
