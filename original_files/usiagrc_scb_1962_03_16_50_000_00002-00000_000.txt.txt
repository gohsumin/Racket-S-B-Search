by J. Joseph Okumu

The new age of political ad»
vanccincnt of African states
brought V\'l|.i‘i it tribal conscious-
ness in the scnse that these
tribcs wcrc indoctriiiated by
politicians into thinking that
they exist not only for social
and cultural purposes, but also
to play a leading part in na-
tional politics.

To achieve this end. politicians
organized their tribal unions in.
to Parliamentary constituencies
as a sure source of stable, loyal
votes for them. Very often these
mushroom unions became aifili<
ated to a national tribal union.
which later became part of a
political party led by a combina-
lion of political and tribal
heros.

These so-called national par
ties, very often with minority
members of Parliament in
them, go on to advocate tribal
states within the national
whole.

The National lndepcndent Par-
ty of Nigeria advocated dlu‘ing
the Nigerian Constitutional Cone
fersnce in London that the Cala-
bar, Ogoja and River Provinces
be made into a separate state.
Almost at the some time (1960)

At the present time we have two goals foremost i
our mind:

1) To gain College approval for the proposed FM ladi

quote and zlnt'lqutated AM transmitters.

2) To see a dnrstic modification of the college drinking

rtlle i specifically, to see all restrictions against possessio
of liquor and beer on both campuses removed and replace

only witll regulation of where students may not drink (i. e

hall lounges, social functions).

we must support one which allows drinking during open 7

open dorms, which are ruled out of the present modilyin0

No rules will ever keep students from acting- il espollr

good of himself, his fellows and the college. We think

modification of the rules would bring all illcr
responsibility. We have seen students react to increased
freedom before and have seen them respond iarortlbly to it.

These politicians have said
that their liberty as a minority
group can best be safeguarded
if they have their own state.
The truth is not that the polie
ticians are convinced that the
various tribes situntcd in a geo-
graphic region heve anything
to henclit from such a state.

On the contrary, they have
deceived their tribesmerl into
thinking that the creation of
their own state in the country
means freedom from the oppres»
sion of the larger groups. Some
schools of thought support this
line of thinking. However, the
more enlightened school has op.
posed the concept and is strug-
gling for an alternative.

Most ot the time, thcsc pole
iticians want to be masters
and thus welcome tribal slate
concepts. Very often electoral
propaganda, with “state crea~
tion" as a party slogan, be-
comes a possible means of
capturing votes for a politician
with national outlook.

Some of these pseudo-tribal
admilturers rise to fame v 'th.

members of Parliament who ad»
vocate tribal states, not .with
sincerity of purpose, but as a
means of keeping position in
Parliament. This style of polie
tics has calainilous effects upon
a country's development for it
forti es tribal heroes as cone
spicuously as it keeps away the
most capable statesmen from the
Parliament.

In tribal politics, the governc
mom often takes sides. Mea-
sures which benefit the tribe
that supported them during a
general election are legislated
Development schemes are cen-
tered in favorable political con-
stituencies, while the unfav r.
able ones, namely those which
offered them less support, are
neglected.

These problems are widespread
