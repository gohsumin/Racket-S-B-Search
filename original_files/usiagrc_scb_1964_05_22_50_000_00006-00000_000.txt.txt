ing the half-mile in 1255.7 and
the mile in 4:22.41. TePaske‘fol-
lowed him in the half With the
best time of his career, 156.6,
and Rod Brown finished fourth

,Pioneers 2nd Again in MCAC Golf Meet;
Sellergren Paces Pioneers; Shoots 143

By Andy Bushnell

The Grinnell varsity golf
team ended the 1964 season fin-
ishing second in the conference
meet for the second consecu-
tive year. Defending champion
Knox again took top honors,
outshooting the Pioneers by
twelve strokes 584-596.

The meet, which was held
last Friday and Saturday at
the Elmorest Country Club in
Cedar Rapids, capped a sum
cessful season during which the
Pioneers compiled'a 7—1 record
in dual matches and finished

second in the Drake Invitation-

al Tournament.

Cornell, the only team to beat
Grinnell all season in dual play,
ended on eighteen game Pio-

neer winning streak which ex—
tended back to I962. Ironically,
Cornell was also the last team
to beat the Pioneers in 1962.

Pete Boynton fired a 69 on
the opening day of the con»
ference meet and added a 72 on
Saturday to pace Knox and win
medalist honors With a 141 for
36 holes. Larry Hund, also of
Knox, finished third with a 144.

The Pioneers were paced by
Dave Sellergren who shot a
143, the second best individual
performance, and Ted Risser
who came back with a 69 on
Saturday after a first round 77,
giving him a 146 total. Rick
Miller and Mike Miller turned
in scores of 150 and 157 respec-
tively for the 596 total.
