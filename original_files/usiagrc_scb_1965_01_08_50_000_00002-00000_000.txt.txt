The Reorganizalion

With little notice from the campus, the Student
Senate voted to suggest to the students, who would sug-
gest to the faculty, who would suggest to the President,
that the Senate be replaced by an advisory council
which would hopefully reduce the red tape encountered
under the present student government setup.

According to Speaker of the Senate Jim Parkison,
the proposal for the new advisory council system grew
out of discussions held by the committee on student
government reorganization at last September’s encamp-
ment. Acting President James H. Stauss was a member
of that committee and originally suggested a “committee
of eleven" to act as a coordinating body for student
government and to serve as a consultative body for the
administration. The committee would have been com-
posed of the AWS president, CofHP president, SGA
president, and four at—large representatives from both
north and south campus. The plan was modified to in-
clude a 21-member council. This latter plan was carried
through by a special committee that was set up after
the encampment by SGA President Phil Johnson; this
committee made the proposals that were passed last
Wednesday by the Senate.

The new plan would leave most legislation and
such other concerns as budget allotments and nomina-
tion approval to the advisory council but would have
legislation concerning conduct regulations handled dur-
ing joint CofHP, AWS, and advisory council sessions.
To a large degree, the legislative and executive
branches of student government would be brought to-
gether. Courts, however, would remain a separate body

‘ of student government.

The backers of the constitutional amendments
have cited the advantages. There is the hoped—for re-
duction of red tape and a possible elimination of bicker-
ing among student officials. By voting overwhelmingly
for the proposals, the senators have indicated that they
share this optimism.

It should be noted, though, that there are still
many people on campus who are wary of these amend—
ments. Among them are those who feel that the propo—
sal offers a substitute that is not sufficiently different
than the present system. There are those who feel that
the judicial branch should be included in the advisory
council. There are those who simply don‘t like the way
the amendments were slipped by during a period when
student concern over such matters was at an ebb.

All in all, the proposals seem quite sound. Still, the
present system is far from being a horrible failure. A
system of changing the method of student government
every few years to meet the whims of the reigning stu-

dent administration is hardly conducive to establishing-

an effective means of making student opinions and
needs known to other segments of the college Communi—
ty. Perhaps a permanent student government organiza-
tion could be evolved if more of the people involved in

student government cared enough to want to make the=

present systcm work.

SCARLET AND ILAGK‘

David Lighthourne

letters to Mother

(The following is an excerpt of
a letter David Lighthoume wrote
to his motherh

Rumor has it that lhe people at
1019 Park Street are filling lhe
house iull oi gorillas when they
move out. It’s a kind cl parting
gesture to assure everybcdy that
they are leaving without mom.

i don’t know why they chose
gorillas, instead or something a
little more friendly a unless lhey
really do feel disobliging about the
whole aiiair. in that case, l have

no sympalhy for them. They’ve'

been enjoying special privileges all
along, and there's no reason why
they shouldn't be “back in the
told” (an interesting metaphor).

i know there are already enough
beatniks on North campus. but
who, Mother dear, would expect
the hurling boys to tolerate more
potential headaches than their sal-
aries stipulate? Make no mistake,

l concur with [he decislon. And yer
i do consider il with mixed leci-
ings.

The decision to close down Park
Street was simply a matter of sac-
riflcing the best interests cl iiiiie
individuals lor the general cuhveii-
lence or a dogmatic. totalitarian
philosophy. You naturally lose
sight of the individual’s welfare in
‘the blind exercise pi cynical au-
lhurity. in the words oi an adminisr
tratlorl piiicial. “That's the wayi
,lhc world works."

The curious thing about higher
education these days IS rhal it is
disposed to think in patterns an-
alagous m the World Oulslde. ii we
have come a long way lrdm Aris-
tolle‘s peripatellc kind of teach-
ing, we have also come a long way
from the European university tra-
dition which we hoped to inherit.
A key facet of that lraditlon was
the notion that Colleges Should

 

stand apart from the general so
ciety and even risk notoriety or
disrepule while pursuing new
truths.

The chief factor that dislim
ngShBS the present situation from
that tradition is the presence bi
large, mock-heroic administrations,
dedicaled to their own selfrpreser-
vation, even at the expense of sill-
dents, leachers. and whatever else
you need in order to learn and
progress.

In closing Park Street the admin»
islration noted that it was “lhe
best course icr the College comr
muhity at the present time."

There's a significant error here,
for they have failed to make the
necessary distinction between their
own interests and the interests of
such things as the English depart
ment, the Drama department, and
The Grimell Review. This, or
course. is to be expected.

 

From lhe Pasl

By Cynthia Brust

Winter at Grinnell. Decem~
her and January are filled With
new buildings, money prob-
lems, Christmas vacation, and
finals. Except for the thirteen
campus buildings instead oi
the present thirty, the First
World War instead of the Cold
War, daily chapel lectures and
a lche»weekly Scarler and
Black that characterized the
Grinnell campus fifty years
ago, it was distinctly and un~
mislakably the same Grinnell
we know,

Construction that year in-
volved the Women’s Quadran—
gle. Ari 5&8 in early Decem-
ber described the central build-
ing in glowing terms. It was
to contain a reception area, a
Commons Room With an open-
air "promenade” above il. a
dining room which would seat
the entire female population of

the school, a theatre and rec—'

reaLlon areas in the basement,
offices and suite for the Dean
of Wolnen and a hospital for
twenty “cases bi sickness.”
Two covered “logios” were to
join what is how Main Hall
with already-bmlt Mcars and

two resident collages also uh-_

der construction.

Editorial comment hailed the
nearing completion of the Quad-
rangle predicting “a develop
ment of the home life in the
College" and an increase in the
school's social life tending to
“give the cultural and social
finish needed in the vast social
relationships of after life.” The
common dining rom and the
equal rule enforcement brought
about by proctor: were hailed
as a means to a “broader de-
lnocracy" on lhe campus. An-
other advantage pointed out
was “the greater physical pro-
LCCllOn and Care which it will be
possible lo give (the glrls).”

A fund drive was being
slarlerl that year, President
J. H, T. M‘rllll’s third in Ills
eight years in the posnlon,
were drawing up

Hall, featuring classrooms, of-
fices, a large auditorium, a
“sociological laboratory room,"
and “adequate cloak rooms."
Plans were also underway for
a new boy’s gym, “inside Ward
field, south of the grandstand
‘and near Sth avenue,” addi-
tions to the chapel, renovation
work on Mears Collage, and a
new residence for the president
on Park Street.

Alter Christmas vacation,
Presldent Main announced a
iiuition raise for the next year-—
lirom $70 to 310m Basketball
games, finals schedules andl
gossip filled the 5&3 during
the "nomewS" period before
the beginning of second semes-
ler. Five new courses were add-
ed to the curriculum that so-
mester that began in February,
lsli, They were Appreciation of
Music, Iowa History, History
of Medieval Art. Chemistry of
Foods and Sanitation, and So»
cial Adjustment, By the endl
of January, plans for two addi-
thnal cottages, lo accommodate
all the women students and
thus ccmplele the Quadrangle,
had been confirmed.
