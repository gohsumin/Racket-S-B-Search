Replies To Freshman, Kintner, And Keepnews

Calls Preps’Proposals "Incredible”

To the editor:

This letter is in response to
last week's article by three
freshman students concerning
the "irrelevance" ofthe Grins
nell education.

First of all, I fail to see how
these students, with theirvast
thirteenrweek experience of
the collegiate educationalsys-
tern, can assume that they
have given it a fair trial and
found it wanting. The mind-
expanding project ofa lé-crer
dit independent on death and
insanity somehow does not
strike me as a viable alter-
native to the type of education
which Grinnell is offering.

Few reasons for the propo-
sed radical change are offer-
ed. Semantic phrases like "a
more accurate representation
of society based upon mutual
dependency between students"
prove little more than thefact
that the writers are certainly
not hesioant in using their ir-
relevant education to get ac-
ross a radical point. I see
little justification for the pros
ject other than an unsupport-
ed assumption that “learning

will become a 24-hour a day
process," and an attempt to
get academic credit for wast»
ing a good deal of tuition “,0,
hey.

In our society, there are al»
ternative directions one can
choose for his life to take. One
of those is getting an educa-
tion by going to a small libero
al-arts college. This is the
choice these students have
made; if it does not fit their
plans, then i would suggest
that the college environment
is not where they belong.

At the risk of sounding like
a dyed-inrwool conservative,
it seems to me that the pre-
sent Grinnell education can be
a relevant learning experience
if the student himself wishes
to make it that. These fresh~
men, Iposit, aren't willing to
meet it halfway. In fact, they
really haven't had time to try
it at all.

Perhaps the most incredur
lous statement of an article
filled wlth incredulous state*
ments is the following choice
quote about the purpose of the
College: "it seems more in-
terested in keepingitselfalive
than providing its students
with an education which edu-
cates them." It seems to me
that if the college were not
here a very small amount of
education. educating anybody,
would indeed take place.

The article could perhaps be
passed off as a rather incred-
ible exercise in naivete and
radical idealism. I find, howV
ever, that it bothers me a
good deal more than that, for
i find in it an amazing refusal
to be aware of the reality of
the world in which we are liv-
ing, and the radicalrchange-
for - the ~ sake~ of» radical ,
change syndrome so wpimlof
youth movements today. I
would have hoped that Grins
nell would be free of that.

Describes laughing Jog From Outside:
Clever, Amusing, lngenious--Hideous

To the editor:

Pretty cute that "laughing
jag". Clever, snide and cyni-
cal as you sat in your ivory
tower of Goodnow mockingthe
futile scurrying of us inner
cents (except for Paul, may
he flunk his Fisiks!) Now let
me tell you how it felt to be
on the receiving end of this
clever amusing and ingenious
little jag.

2:00 in the morning: Outside
the wind booms through naked
trees and the first frozen ﬂa-
kes come streaming out ofthe
dark north. I am awakened by
laughter. Not light-hearted or
chortling or even guffaws.

"Not A Mouthpiece”

To the Editor:
I would like to take this op.
portunity to respond briefly
to Mr. Kintner‘s letter of last
week. When I spoke in favor
of the modified physical edu-
cation requirement before the
faculty, 1 did so because I
feared for thepossible demise
of intercollegiateathleticsand
campus recreation in the event
of P.E. staff cutbacks. lwas
later assured that those pro*
grams would not suffer were
the requirement to be abol-
ished, and so changed my poe
sition. As we faculty has now
done away with the P.E. re—
quirement, no harm was done.
I at no time stated, as Mr.
Kinmer suggests, that “the
students were not unfavorable
to a F.E. requirement." Wh‘
enever I speak before thefac-
ulty, or elsewhere, 1 speak as
an elected representative of
the student body, but not as a
mouthpiece for student opina
ion. For anyone to attempt the
latter would be pure folly.

Psychotic, sick, haunting
laughter roaring forth from
Goodnow. Confusion, anger,
rage, then blessedly it stops
as mysterious as it started.
Only the wind rattles my win-
dow. Solsinkbackintoa warm
cocoon of blessful security as
thankful for quiet, something
which we take so casually for
granted. 7

Three o’clock: It starts all
over again and goes on and on
and on. At first I thought it
funny: "Clever, lthought. "I’ll
bet the folks pulling all
nighters are amused." But it
kept on and we watched the
futile stormingofGoodnowand
the huddled group in the night
debating where to go next.
Forty five minutes of hideous
hilarity, until at last someone,
perhaps who went to Vespers
one still night, remembered
the carillon is playedfrom the
organ in Herrick. So silence
again.

Except for the eternal Iowa
wind and the scratching of

"Bitter Personal
Attack On labowitz’

To the editor:

Peter Keepnews signed his
letter last week "in the spirit
of good, clean, healthy enter
tainment." Unfortunately, he
does not seem to set the same
standards for his entertainr
ment as forhisargumentation,
for the letter was little more
than a bitter personal attack
on LC. Labowitz. ler. Keeps
news is truly interested in
responding to criticism, as he
says he is, and if he plans to
answer the numerous come
plaints about his committe
this year in the same way he
answered those of J.C. last
week, he has set for himself
an ambitious task. For he will
have to make as many replies
as there are critics, answer
ing each according to his per-
sonality, or style, or idiosynr
crasies.

Yours in the interest of hon—
est, substantive, rational dis
cussion.
