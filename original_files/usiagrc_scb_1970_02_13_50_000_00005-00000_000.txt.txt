l‘eallzatlon of a moral and
pollilcal commitment: it is not
a romantic adventure Pontiac
corvo understands this
brilliantly. It is a lactlcal and
technical maneuver oi no little
derrlng~do that the director is
able to sustain an extraordinary
sense of documentary authcn»
ticity while employing some of
the most difficult lilm-making
techniques. For example, Pontea
corvn’s use of freezerframes to
handle time lapses in no way
detracts from the reality of the
events.

But there is in evidence a far
more profound irony, and it
stems from the fact that this film
is being shown at Grinnell
College in the heartlands of the
U.S.A. while we pursue a dis—
astrous War in Southeast Asia.
The similarity of France‘s efforts
in Algeria to U.S. involvement
in Vietnam is striking. For
although Vietnam has never been
a legal colony of the U.S., as
Algeria was of France, virtually
every other point of comparison
is valid. in both cases we have
popular based colonial wars of
liberation waged against Western
capitalist powers, who, with the
cooperation of a locally despised
ruling elite, have tried to sup
press the liberation movement in
the name of anti-Communism. In
both cases the colonial armies

have resorted lo terrorism and
torture and to the creation of
concentration camps, euphemr
istically called centres dc
rcgronpcincnt by the French,
"strategic hamlets" by the
Americans. And in each case
racist motives are clearly in
evidence: recall the French
man’s traditional denigration
ol the Arab, comparable to our
“yellow peril," and Lyndon
Johnson's no\v
reference to Asians as “yellow
dwarfs Wlth pocket kniies.” in
both France and America, street
demonstrations against the war
resulted in unprecedented police
brutality, and draft resislers (in
France they had an ofﬁcial title:
Jeune Resistance) were forced
into hiding or out of the country.

Now it is evident, I think, to
all of us that as Americans we
bear the same responsibility for
the continuance of American in-
volvement in Vietnam as French
men did for their country’s atro-
cities in Algeria. What is equally
evident, but not nearly as widely
recognized, is that we of Grinnell
College, as American
academicians. are much closer
to the springs of brutal U.S. inter-
vention in Southeast Asia (and
elsewhere) man we care to
think. A brief examination of
bourgeois Social Science, as
taught by virtually every
American institution of higher
learning, will bear my contention
out.

Consider the cases of Political
Science and Economics. The
political scientist purports to be
engaged in an inquiry that is by

such interests is to enhance the

Now this casts grave doubts upon

is precisely what is meant by a

supposed by Political Science; it
ls the stability of the present
political structure. Political
scientists no more question the
value of preserving the present
structure than do physicists
question the value of preserving
the material world. Clearly,
when the existing structure is
accepted as an undisputed given
social inquiry, radical social
change is ruled out not by reason
and argument, but a pri i. How
many political scientists do you
know who are engaged in em-

structure lacilitates or hampers
the meeting ofhuman needs? The
question ”Reform or

serious attention but gets none

Political Science, general and-or
partial equilibrium is the bedrock
of Establishment Economics.
The equilibrium oi the monopoly
capitalist lranicirork, that is,
which is accepted as permanent.
Once again, this iramcwork is not
argued iar, nor is it defended
against persuasiveness that
capitalism does not display
tendencies to equilibrium, but
rather to disequilibrium, cons
ﬁlcts of interest, and periodic
breaks in the continuity of
development, as evidenced in the
so-called business cycle with its
everrhovering threat of
recession, depression. and mass
unemployment. These claims are
rarely acknowledged, much less
examined

Thus, orthodox Social Science,
under the pretense of value-
neutrality, takes a deiinite
position in the most pressing
issue that Americans can face:
Is the existing social structure
worth preserving? Social
“Science“ emerges, then, as an
apologetic ideology for the social
status quo, an ideology whose
counterrevolutionary premises
do not allow certain questions to
be raised, in much the same way
that the premises of modern
physics do not allow questions
concerning the existence and
character of phloglston to be
raised. Physicists are justified in
this, since the existence or
phlogiston is regarded as a closed
question by the unanimous
agreement of the world com-

Folk Festival

By Nada Mangialctti
At any given moment, an

average of one hundred and fifty
spoon thieves were present at the
folk music workshops held in
South Lounge last Friday and
Saturday afternoons. Despite the
two lectures and occasional
questionranswer periods, the
workshops were more like in-
formal concerts. On both nights,
the formal concerts attracted
capacity crowds, which included
a considerable number of
students from other colleges.

Happiness is bluegrass fiddle
and banjo. Art Rosenbaum and
Alan Murphy were very happy,
Keith Dempster demonstrated
different harmonica styles.

The lestival opened with the
Papakee family who performed
several Mesquakie friendship
dances. The singing, very strong
