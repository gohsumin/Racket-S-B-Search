Quad Opens For . . .

By Suzie Gelber

The Quad opens its heart and its house to the men of
North campus, tomorrow night at 8 pm. Smith of the border,
ladies prepare to welcome all comers, including administra-
tive personnel and faculty advisors.

Guided by the expansive spirit of Tom Jones, Molly
Brown, and Irma la Douce, each floor of femmes introduces
itself to any and all suitors with a Broadwalk flourish. Wan-
dering males are both permitted and encouraged on this night
of nights, as the “fair ladies” ensnare their men. All’s fair in
love and war except practices forbidden under open house
regulations, enforced during the 8-10 pm. random visits and
the 10-12:30 p.m. lounge parties.

Each women’s residence plans a demonstration of its af-
fection for a men’s hall by means of lounge entertainment
and specially selected food. South campus social chairman,
Dottie Dosse, interrupted while mixing and matching dorms,
acknowledged the tradition of the all-Quad mixer. “A pro-
gram apart from open dorms, open house, is planned as a sort
of gay and informal mass social introduction,” noted Dottie.
All irresistible forces and immovable objects are advised to
don informal date apparel and a festive air. ,

Bafflebroads, acting as temporary social chairman, and
Dithyrambers helped plot the mob capers, mapping a course
of action from Park Street to French House to Mears and on
to the Ioggia etceteras.

Invoking the protection of Sadie Hawkins, girls turn the
tables and take the invitation initiative during this South
campus complement to men’s open house. However, all the
Quadrangels wish to announce and affirm their undying af-
fection for all North campus men, and they plan to prove
their love with all sanctioned forms of hospitality. MENi‘
CgME AND GET YOUR SOUTHERN COMFORT — ON THE
H USE!
