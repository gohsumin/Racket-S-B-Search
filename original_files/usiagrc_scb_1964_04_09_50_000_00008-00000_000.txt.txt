correspondent for an American
newspaper concern. Until 1933,
Stevenson’s only official gov-
ernment association was his
enlistment in the navy. But in
1933 his service witli the Agri-
culture Adjustment Adminis-
tration in Washington inaugura
ated his government career.
in his post with the Agricul-
ture committee, Stevenson
helped President Roosevelt
construct a program to relieve
~farmers suffering the effects of
inflation and depression. The
legislation enacted during this
crisis proved to be the most
meaningful farml improvement
program of the century.

In 1935, Stevenson left the
government to go into private
practice with a Chicago law
firm. But he returned to act
as Special Assistant and per-
sonal counsel to the Secretary

of the Navy from 1941 to 1944.
Also, in 1943 Stevenson headed

a mission to ltaly to help with ,

the reconstruction of the liber-
ated but war-ravaged country.

In 1945 Stevenson moved into
truly international politics by
assisting in the preparation of
the United Nations organiza-
tion. During planning, Steven-
son traveled extensively, and
increased the United States’
prestige in world affairs At
the first meeting of the U. N,
General Assembly, Adlai Stev—
enson represented our gover
ment again, in the post of Sen-
ior Advisor to the United States
delegation

Stevenson returned to the
U. N, in 1945 and 1947, ap—
pointed a United States dele-
gate by President Truman.
Stevenson had proved so vai-
uable that personal politics,
which often governs decisions
on appointments during a
change of administrations, did
not affect his position. Steven-
son’s importance would be dra-
matized during the Eisenhower
administration, when the Re
publicans asked him to serve
with the government. They
called upon Stevenson to act
as an advisor to the Secretary
of State in 1957.

However, in 1948 Mr, Steven-
son left his official post to serve
his party by running for Gov-
ernor of Illinois. Illinois vot-
ers chose Stevenson by the
largest plurality in the tradi-
tionally-Republican state's his-
tory, and Stevenson repaid
their trust in him by ridding the
state’s government of the core
ruption that had characterized
the previous regime.’ Steven~
son initiated legislation to im-
prove the standards and condi-
tions of education and farm-
ing in the state. Education has
been a major concern of his,
and in his career at the na
tional level he continued to
support educational improve-
ment Educational concerns
were an important subject dur-

 

ing his Presidential campaigns,

 

Broad and Unique Service Background
Recommends Ribicoff for Nomination

By Harry Shrago

in 1964 the Democrats must
choose a man of unquestioned
ability and experience to be
the running mate of Lyndon
Johnson. That man is Abra-
ham Ribicoff.

Ribicoff would bring to the
vicerpresidency a wide exper-
lence and a broad background
unique in American public af-
fairs. He is the only public of—
ficial who has served as a mem»
ber of a state legislature. a
judge, a member of the Ur S.
House of Representatives, a
governor, a cabinet member,
and now a U, S. Senator.

Ribicoff began his career of
public service in 1938, when he
was elected Representative
from Hartford to the Connecti-
cut General Assembly. He was
reelected in Him Newsmen

 

tat the State Capitol voted him

the ”most able
tive.”

He served two terms as a
judge of the Hartford Munici-
pal Courl, and for a number of
years Ribicoff was a hearing
Examiner under the State‘s

Fair Employment Practices

representa-

Law. In 1948 he was elected tov
the U. 5, Congress from Con-l

necticut‘s First Congressional
District, (Hartford County),
and served two terms.
Before entering the Kennedy
cabinet, Ribicoff had been
twice elected Governor of Con-
necticut; in 1954 by a slim mar-

gin of 3,115 votes, and in 1958'

by the historyrmaking plural-
ity of 246,348 votes.

From January, 1961 until
July, 1962, Ribicofi was Secre—
tary of Health, Education, and

Continued from rage s

says that Goldwater ”has done
a great deal for Negro integra—
tion in Arizona. , . . Arizona is
one of the most liberal states
. . when it comes to race rela-
tlons, and Goldwater’s influ-
ence has been a major factor.
He has done more for Arizona
Negroes than any other Ari<
zona politician."

He rests his principles on the
solid foundation of the United
States Constitution, which was
originally instituted as a "sys-
tem of restraint against the
natural tendency of govern-

ment to expand in the direction
of absolutism.” in order to pre-
serve freedom we can not as-

sume “that the State (federal)
is competent to do all things
and is limited in what it actuala
ly does only by the will of those
who control the State."
Goldwater believes ”that un—
ionism accomplishes a positive
good for the country, Unions
can be an instrument for
achieving economic justice for
the working man . . They are
an expression of freedom. . . .
an expression of man’s inalien-
able right to associate with
other men for the achievement
of legitimate objectives," In or
der for unions to perform their

needed function, three condi<
tions must be observed: “asso-
ciation with the union is volun-

tary; the union confines its ac<
tivities to collective bargaining;
the bargaining is conducted
with the employer of the work
ers concerned, Senator Gold-
water urges ”us to make war
on all monopoliesAwhethei cor-
porate or union. The enemy of
freedom is unrestrained pow
or.”

In foreign affairs Goldwater
has one objective——”total vte—
tory“ in the face of ”the all-
embracing determination of
Communism to capture the
world and destroy the United
States.’
