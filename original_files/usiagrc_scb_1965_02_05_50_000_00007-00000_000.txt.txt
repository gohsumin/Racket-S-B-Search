The Grinnell basketball team
avenged an earlier defeat to Aur
gustana College by a score of SE
so in a Saturday night one over.
time contest.

Jeff Frantz swished a twenty foot
Jump shot with five seconds left in
the game to give Grinnell the win.
Frantz took scoring honors for
Grinnell with 31 points but had to
yield game scoring honors to hot
handed George Strombum of Au-
gustana. Strombom netted 13 of 16
shots from the floor and 3 of 9 free
throws in leading his team with 34
points.

The first half was a nip and tuck
affair as the score was tied ten
times. In the last two minutes
Augustana spurted to take a five
point lead.

For the first seven minutes of the
second half the teams traded baSv
ketsr The only break was a techni-
cal foul called on the Augustana
coach.

With twelve minutes remaining
Augustana held its biggest lead of
eight points. Then two baskets by
Frantz and one each by Tom Hill
and Ted Risser tied the score.

Later, with 33 seconds left, Hill
stole the ball and fed Clyde Smith
who put Grinnell ahead 79-78. Af-
ter Augustana threw the ball away,
Grinnell missed two free throws
but Smith got the rebound and was
fouled. His free throw gave Grin-

nell a two point lead with 19 sec-
nnds remaining,

Then Augustana brought the ball
down and Bob Karlblom tipped in
a shot. That sent the game into
overtime.

Two baskets by Hill and one by
Smith matched Auguslana’s six
points in overtime. Then came
Frantz’s shot that won the game.

Augustana brought to Grinnell a
towering team that included eight
players 6'4" or better, Their start-
ing lineup included a 6'6" freshman
center, Bob Karlhlom a 6'5" for-
ward who scored 24 points, and
6’3” George Strombom.

Grinnell employed a 1.371 zone to
lessen its height disadvantage. This
forced the inexperienced Augus-
tana guards into many mistakes.
Though Augustana shot a hot 57%
from the floor, they got off 22
fewer shots than Grinnell so the‘
Pioneers were able to match the
Vikings’ 34 field goals. Especially
effective on defense were Clyde
Smith and Tom Hill who either set
up or got several key steals

Augustana used its height ad-
vantage to take command of the re-
bounds. in the first half Augustana
led in rebounds 21o Augustana
took complete control on defense
by allowing Grinnell only four of<
fensive rebounds. Grinnell did a
great job in the second half though
by outrebounding their opponents

 

17-16.

 

Varsity Beats Frosll in Iniersquud Meet;

Kelley, Kinyon, Sharp, Show Potential

By Lee Rothsteln

Varsity and fresh grapplers
clashed in a dual duel last Fri-

day. In an effort by Coach
Bowers to allow all members
of the team to wrestle, weight
classes were ignored

In the first match Jim Kin-
you of the fresh edged Bill
Barnes by a point. John Sharpe,
acting captain of the freshmen.
defeated his opponent, A pin
by Jon Bilstrom gave the fresh
the first 3 of the ll matches.

Bob Geller ol the varsity
overcame Bob Swaerood of
[he fros‘h and Joel Richman, a
freshman, outscored his opposi-
tion, giving the freshmen 4 out
of the first 5 matches. The var-
sity came back by winning the
next 4 contests, in which Larry
Miller, the varsity captain,
pinned Louis Kelley, Morgan
Michel pinned Ken Augustine,
Barnes edged Mike Martinson,
and Mike Deatllerage pinned
Jeff Patterson. The last two
matches were split as Lee Roth-
rtein pinned his varsity oppo-

nent, and Marty Ringo pinned
Swartwood.

In a blood bath clash between
Ken Strubler of the varsity and
Rich Segool of the fresh on
Thursday, Strubler temporarily
knocked out his opponent and
segool after drawing blood from
the Varsity grappler succumbed
to Strubler.

Although the fresh lost, they
certainly were not beaten.
Commendation certainly must
be given to Kelley of the fresh
for his efforts against Miller,
chosen last year as the varsity's
most valuable wrestler. Augus-
tine of the fresh also showed
remarkable efforts for a novice
wrestler in his first match. The
outlook for the fresh is certain»
ly favorable, Kin yo n and
Sharpe showed great potential
in their matches not to mention
Richman’s efforts.
