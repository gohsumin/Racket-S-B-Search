Honorary Degree

Herbie Hancock is a former Grinnell student
and, though still a young man, one of the most noted
Jazz musicians in the country. He has accepted an
invitation from CBS to come to Grinnell to help
commemorate Black Martyrs’ Day. '

At their last meeting before spring vacation,
the faculty overwhelmingly voted to give Hancock
an honorary doctorate. There were only two dissent—

ing votes. Dean Wall, in presenting the motion."

said that the proposal had been brought to him by
CBS. It remains only for the proposal to be present-
ed to the trustees. .

The faculty vote leads us to question the value
of the honorary degree given by Grinnell College.
We do not dispute Hancock’s considerable accom-
plishments and talents in the field of music, Han-
cock, however, is barely thirty years old. Further-
more, though he spent four years at Grinnell, he
never earned a degree. Tile honorary doctorate
should be a noble token of praise given to a man for
a lifetime of service and excellence in a particular
field. The apparent zeal with which the faculty voted
to give Hancock the degree indicates to us that they
were perhaps more interested in pandering to the
desires of a minority than maintaining the high
standards of the honorary degree.

In the past, the College has given honorary de-
grees to presidents, congressmen, and distinguished
scholars. Several years ago, we also awarded an
honorary degree to the last great black martyr, the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. To give Hancock the
same honor as King is to either degrade the greater
man or exalt the lesser. Either alternative speaks
ill of the memory of King and the dignity of Grinnell

College.

Milovctn Djilos

We note with considerable interest the silence
on campus concerning the matter of Milovan Djilas’
cancelled visit. Djilas was unable to deliver the Ros-
enfield Lectures at Grinnell because the Yugoslav»
ian government, which has twice imprisoned Djilas,
has revoked his passport. This outrageous action has
as yet occasioned no official protests and no letters
to the 58:8.

The Committee on international Studies, the
sponsors oi the lectures, issued a bland statement in
which they said Djilas “is unable to come to this
country from Belgrade at this time.” The secretary
of the committee has stated that he was not officially
apprised of the reason for cancellation when the no-
tice was sent out. He said, however, that the com-
mittee had no plans to protest the actions of the
Yugoslavian government.

We deplore the repressive policies of the Yugo-
slavian government. And we cannot help but won-
der at the motives of those who condemn totalitar-
ianism on the right, while they rationalize or ignore
its existence on the left,

Editors’ Note: At the last moment we received a letter

from President Leggelt to the Yugoslavian embassy which
may be found in the Letters,

Dear Mr. Ambassador:

For the Rosentield Lectureship
this year, Grihnell College in—
vited Milovan Djilas to address
lhe College and participate in
academic activities at Hus inr
siiiuiion. As you know, a few days
before the departure of Mr.
Djilas, his passport was ap-
propriated and he had to cancel
his trip to this Country. His
nation’s refusal to grant him
permission to travel abroad
deprived our students of a unique
opportunity to hear an important
contemporary author and
political philosopher and also

of Europe and a period or history
that interests 3 great many
people here and abroad. Needless
to say, our invitation still stands
and we hope that sometime in
the future Mr. Djilas will be able
