SCARLET AND ILACK

 

MAKE MORE THAN LOVE

By PAUL JONES

One of the many results at my previous columns in the 5&3,
ospeclally those concerning creativity, is that I have noticed that
very few people have any sense of the term ‘creatlvity’ as any
kind of broad or Inclusive concept. Most of the criticism or com«
ment that 1 nova received has been to the etlect that "Creativity
is something that just can’t go on all or the time, since it either
takes a special type of person to be creative, or a special talent."
It may be so that it takes both special people and special talent,
biit this does not mean that an attitude of creativity cannot be de-

veloped by everybody on this campus, or that one has to be born
creative to be so.

The fact is that creativity can exist in every kind oi activity
which a person undertakes, from writing poetry to developing re-
lationships with people. As the title or one or my previous columns
stated, “Man is a creative animal.” To be human is to be creative.
to develop a creative attitude toward everything you do. For those
who are willing to take on the burden or being human, or being
conscious at every moment of being conscious, or living actively
and openly, or living with people, not between or among them, or
taking every relationship as an inside activity rather than an out-
side activity, admittedly, life is not easy, or as certain as it might
be otherwise. But a person is not born as a human being, but
rather as a potential human being; You have to struggle, make
choices, suffer agonies of loneliness, to finally gain a soul. not in
the religious or mystical sense necessarily, but in the sense or a
hard and deeply-rooted knot oi compassion. an understanding oi
what it is to be human, a desire to feel as much as you know

Unlortunstely. most people live breastied by their surround-
ings around here, and it not, then in a situation oi animal require-
ments which allow no time tor making choices, At a school like

this people don't really think that they have to struggle; not that
everything is merely given to them, or course, but they sort of live
in a ﬁlm or shadow, never quite realizing, or trying to realize,
what they are doing: not what they will do, but what they are do-
lng.

The ease with which certain individuals {ind categories for
other people and the narrowness of the scales of Values on which
many people, events, relationships, are judged, are only indica«

tlons of the rut into which so many people fall: that of not viewrng
every person as different, as a potential relationship of creative
Value. Perhaps the title at this column should have been: ”Make
more With love, not just love itself.”

“We thought we were definite-
ly scheduled {or 10 pm after
the Lenox Quartet," Davis said,
“and we think we've been hus<
tied into a prime time show tor
a lousy 3150."

Davis and other troupe mem-
bers also said that Grinnell had
violated its contract with the
Mime Troupe by “crossing out
and changing it substantially
otter it had already been
signed.”

The contractispecifying the

Grinnell, and on October 28

_ Giddins said he made and lni<

tialed several changes "on Miss
Dentel's advice.”

The most notable change was
that ii requested deposit or $15
was crossed out by Giddins and
the tollowing paragraph inserted

Giddins also changed some
speci 'ed technical and lighting
provisions or the contract and
crossed out a requirement for
the college to print programs tor
the periormance. He then signed
the contract and sent it back
to the troupe.

The troupe never agreed to
the changes, and it never re-
sponded at alL Legally the con-
tract was void.

The mime company said that
their secretary knew or no
change in the scheduled time

Miss Dentel told the 5&5 she
thought “they were just looking

tor an excuse to squeeu more
money out of the college, and
would have broken the contract
anyway."

Cohan said the Mime Troupe
collected around 5130 in dona-
tlons at the show, and that the
company thought that it took
