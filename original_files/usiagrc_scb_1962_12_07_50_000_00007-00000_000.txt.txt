Both games were marked with
poor ball handling by Grinnell

The oil slv‘e patterns lacked

accustomed to seeing. The fast
breaks were missing, as were
the frequent key passes under

the basket.

Houever, thc deicnsive games
played by St_ Olai and Carleton
can not be underestimated.
Against Carleton, the Pioneers
faced a tight zone which lorced
the ball to the outside, keeping
most oi the shots outside the
liiteen ioot mark. The etlectite-
ness oi this zone was evidenced
by the shooting percentage of

the Pioneers. In the filst hall,
Glilinell hit only 7- 44 Shots or
15% of shots attempted.
