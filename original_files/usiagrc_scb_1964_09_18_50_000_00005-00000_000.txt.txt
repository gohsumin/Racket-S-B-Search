Eros/2 End First Week,
Start To (lass Today

By Susan Taylor

When classes ‘started this
morning, it was with the relief
of the upperclassmen who have
been here all week and with
mixed feelings on the part of
the new students. There was
the excitement that goes with
the start of each new semester
and the promise solemnly made
to self that “I will do better
this time."

The start of classes\signified
the end of a busy week of New
Student Days for the 385 enter-
ing freshmen and transfer stua
dents who arrived last Sunday.
The five days of orientation in-
eluded testing, lectures, group
meetings, conferences with ad-
yisers and social events. L

The house presidents busily
comparing their freshmen at
early dinner, and the fresh-
men busily comparing their
house presidents at late dinner
were common sights. Every-
body seemed to adapt easily to
the geography of the campus,
but soon learned that new paths
would have to be formed since
a couple of mountains which
are impassible had grown up
on the campus during the sum-
mer.

But these were minor prob-
lems m the freshmen and
group leaders who were caught
up in the busy schedule of New
Student Days activities.

Monday morning saw the
yearly tests in
which were given to the fresh
men, but this year they only
had one morning of testing.
The reaction was varied, but
few were too disappointed to
have the test over.

Tuesday evening was the
time for the annual picnic for
new students and faculty ad<
visors and their families on
central campus. The picnic was

Welcome

Darby Gym-

 

followed by a square dance on

Barber Plaza featuring Bob Lu- '

cas of Waterloo. and a movie
in ARH featuring Peter Sellers
of England,

Wednesday night we heard
the annual History of Grinnell
College" by Professor Jones.
and Thursday night was con-
votation.

Throughout the week the vari-
ous activities of New Student
Days went along smoothly, ac«
cording to one of the social
chairman. There were the tra
ditional co-ed dinners, trips into
the city of Grinnell, liberal arts
discussions. .houso meetings,
serenades, water fights, trips
to the book store, conferences
with advisors, conferences with
students about the conferences
with advisers, speeches, wel-
comes, and various not-so-tra—
ditional activities.

The moving in started all
over again with the arrival of
the upperclassmen on Wednes-
day, As they glanced around
the campus to see if the new
uniondtather, The Forum—
was finished, one was heard to
comment, ”I wish they would
clean up one mess before they
start another.”

Yesterday it was all kinda
summed up with registration,
and it was heard that the regis-
trar and the deans were re"—
lieved when it was all done.

So 'today the academic pro-
cess we call liberal education
started again for another se-
mester. For those starting their
first semester and those start—
ing their last, it was a time of
beginning and of beginning
again. There were old friends
to see, and new friends to
make. There was the news to
catch up on and the brand new
books to read. And there was
always Saga food.
