What is wrong with Grinnell?’

By Richard Ohlemeyer
5&3 Staff Writer

When Stephen Wood, clean or

of House Presidents why things
are dull at Grinnell, he touched
off a discussion that might
have been called “What is

' Wrong with Grinnell?"

One suggestion was that in-1

persons li-om among Grinnell
students. In short Grinnell has
lost its “lags."

An opposite idea was the
thought that living has become
too easy and that since the
only struggle we race is the
unpleasant task oi periodically
attending classes, there is not
enough challenge to the stu-
dent.

General student apathy was

‘versy over the social regulations
such as women’s hours and the
drinking rule. When Dean Wood
|mentioned that there were other
issues besides the college rules,
he was reminded that college
rules are usually closer to stu-
ldents than most occurrences in
the outside world. »

Another suggestion was that a
lack of strict enforcement of the
rules has deprived the students
of something to gripe about.
Just prior to the discussion
about what is wrong with Grin-
nell, Dean Wood had asked the
CoiHP how many men had been

residences, intoxication, being in
women's residences or tamper—

He learned that only a few
persons had been fined for
these reasons, and then stated
that he could not understand

Another house president told
how he had invited seven!

The general opinion seemed
to be that the interim break
was mildly beneficial because
stdents could relax after finals
and catch up on some outside
reading. A general increase in
television watching and game
playing was noted,
