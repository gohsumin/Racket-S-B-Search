The theme “The Year of the
Student" has been my attempt
to provide a unifying concept
for student government 21 pi i-
ciple from whicl specri issues
and problems dcrrve thei
ing. it has occurred in what
probably was the last year of
the existing student government
structure, and therefore some
details may be irrelevant to the
new system,

In the last category would fall
the introduction of a weekly
newsletter to highlight Council's
activitie A committee system
was established to facilitate the
efficient handling ot hues, and
committees wer charred by
Council member and staffed
with members of the student
body at large in contrast to the
previous practice of managing
Council expenditures on a week

oi Grinncll with any profound
solutions of the perplexing prob~
lcins of student life which face
us here at the “Harvard of thc

it is necessary for me to pre-

government that will be ex-
tremely useful to my
candidates as well as all those
other interested, and disinterest-
ed, students of Gr-inncli.

Only in the solid lowa tra—

actionary government. can we
find our needed guidance. The

The possibility or calendar

curriculum changes and a de-

issues for this campus and

student in their formative
stages. Resolutions passed by
the Sentrtc will he iorwarded

I would like to maintain the
Gi‘innell tradition. At the same

i time, I would like to promote the

intellectual level oi the campus.
I see no reason why this Couldn‘t

fairs. A resolution against the
loyalty oath and the disclaimer
affidavit of the National Defense
Education act was passed by the
Council, sent to national govern:
ment officials, newspapers and
other student governments, and
was inserted in the Congres-
sional Record by Congressman
Fred Schwengel.

in addition Grinnell led the
Midwest Conference student
.lbody presidents' conference to
pass a similar resolution and to
direct other Conference schools
to consider the issue. Until
Congress eliminates the oath and
affidavit, student government
should continue its activities a-
long this line.

The Council formed the Race
Relations committee, which sent
two persons to the Washington
conference on the sit-in move-
ment and sponsored a fol sing-
