Within the confines of any great metropolitan
newspaper building, an offensive campaign is con-

stantly being waged by the advertising department
against the men on the copy desks. Or so it seems.

Editors beat their heads together trying to
place well-written stories on pages full of horrible
ads in such a way that the stories will be read. And
business managers, apparently, try every day to
find ads more gargantuan and more offensive to
out-shine the copy desk’s copy.

That, anyway, is one problem.

Another comes about when each individual
page is put into the entire newspaper. Some nation-
nl advertisements cannot be placed on the same
page or even on the page opposite an ad for com-
peting companies.

Some ads have coupons, and cannot be placed
on the other side of a page that has an ad with I
coupon.

Some ads are so grotesque you don’t want to
put them anywhere.

There are local advertisers who are constntly
trying to bribe ad men to bribe business managers
to put their ads on the front page of the newspaper.

"Pagliai’s wouldn’t want it’s ad next to Ahr-
vano’s, but if we move Ahrvanos over to that page
and put Poynter’s next to Pagliai's that puts Poyn-
ter’s next to Bang’s and we can’t have that

“. . . Maybe we can move that New York Univer-
lity job ad over to page four. No, that would put it
next to a University of Chicago job ad. But we
can’t leave it there because it cuts the heart out of
our best story. 0h, damn, can’t we just junk these
damn ads?”

No, we can’t — at least not frequently. If we
'do we might not get any more ads, and ads make
up around $350 or something like thirty percent of
our operating budget.

“Like it or not,” says Steve Warsh, business
manager of the Scarlet & Black, “the costs of pub-
lishing a newspaper are higher than ever. To meet
these rising costs, newspapers from New York to
San Francisco are finding it necessary to solicit
more and more advertising. The Scarlet & Black is
no exception to this trend.”

“We operate on a shoe-string budget. Our re-
sources are limited as is our publishing flexibility.
Financially and physically, we cannot afford to put
out a 16 or 20 page paper every Friday of the school
year.”

“Unfortunately, no matter how much advertis~
ing we sell, we can‘t cover the cost of an average
issue,” Warsh added, “We need to dip into our sub-
scription and SGA allotment funds.”

"Our answer to these restrictions has been
fewer, but larger issues. “In this way, we hope to
accomplish the twin task of bringing you the
“news” and still retaining our financial stability.”

Both journalistically and financially, we hope
to please the bitchegoddess success.

The present Ind-war semi.
melt among investors is a
reversal of earner mullet
reaction In Ihe var.
when America’s ﬁrst major
military buildup began in Viet-
nam, early in 1965, American
investors ielt that large mili-
lary expenditures would revlm-
lize an economy they lemd
was going sluggish.

In July, 1965. the Dow Jones
industrial: were at a level of
about ﬂsl points. By February
ll, 1566, Dow Jones industrial:
reached the historic high of
995.15 points.

Dow Jones and Company —
the publisher All “I Vlnll Strut
Journal — oomputu its in-
dustrial average by selecting
thirty representative, major in-
dustrial corporations, watching
Khieil' daily prices, Ind mulling
the prices of their common
leek.

Roughly speaking, when the
Dow Jones "my: lor indus-
trials decline: by a point. it
means ill-t the total —- repw
senting the total price of one
share each for these thirty
Dump-hie: — has declined by a
dollar.

Buying activity lncunsed
with Gaul-don. Rumors of
peace talks would occasion
selling by investors.

Market activity now operates
in the opposite pattern.

on January am, Dow Jones
Industrlals‘ went up 7.73 points
to a level of 908.92 with reports
that North Vietnam was consid-
erlng peace talks. When the re-
ports did not materialize, prices
began to drop.

By Febmary 13th, the indus-
trials decreased 77.15 points
from January. closing at 831.77.

Despite a small recovery. the
market again declined with ru-
mors that Johnson was consid-
ering an increase in our troop
commitment in Vietnam.

The March 5th closing level
of Dow Jones Industrial: was
330.56, a 14—month low.

The investors overwhelming
{ear with American involvement
in Vietnam is that the deterior-
aling internal economic situation
will bring about Government
wagerprice controls and cause
a reducllon in corporate prof-
its.
