.Witnesses Voice Mixed Chicago Reactions

By Alice Rogoﬂ .

Tuesday night in South
Lounge the veterans oi the
latest Chicago action related
the “reality” that they were,
and still are, experiencing
physically, mentally, and emo<
tionally. For a iew days, the
"war had been brought home
to them.” Their former
thoughts and beliefs were
brought face to face with con-
ﬂict, and changed or developed
in the process. They were sur-
rounded by an atmosphere or
dedication and urgency where
words like “revolution" dis—
cussed at midnight become
fangerous realities the mom-
ng after.

Sixteen Grinnellians piled
into three cars and had headed
east to Chicago last week.
Many of them ended up stay-
lug at an SDS movement cen-
ter where the militant Weathers
man laction was staying.
People had been shot Wednes<
day night, and they settled
down in what senior Bruce Nis<
gen described as a “paranoid
atmosphere," They talked with
the Weathermen until six in
the morning.

The general Grinnell reaction
I» the Weathermen's tactics
was negative. Senior Tom
Thomas summarized the Weath-
‘rrnan‘s philosophy as lollowst
’They feel that there is a revos
lutlon going on right now. if
on aren’t fighting for the revo«
ution, then you're fighting
Against it. It’s on eithersot‘
choice. They also believe that
it is important to show that
white people are willing to
fight on the side that non-whites
are usually on. Their purposes
are to raise the level of the
struggle, to build a red army,
and to create an awareness of
the Weatherman‘s presence in

the nation’s mind. They aren't
trying to build a mass move-
ment, but to focus their appeal
to a small select group of
p eople actively willing to
Strike."

Freshman Kay Sophar under-
went the gleatest changes in
attitude toward the Weatheb
merit: "i went there the most
pro and came back the most
anti." After being captured in
a raid, she spent twelve hours
in jail with Weathermen. She
discovered that she was free
only to have the “correct
thoughts.” “The Weathermen
are totally totalitarian — there
is no right to dissent. Try to
discuss and you’re shouted
down." She said. “They’re the
most fascist organization I‘ve
ever come in contact with"

in contrast to the Weather-
men's policies were the tac-
tics oi another group, Revolu-
tionary Youth Movement ll
(RYM II). Senior Sally Hamann
said that “the Panthers, the
Young Lords, and RYM ll all
disliked the Weathermen. The
Weathermen are a white revos
lutionary fighting force with no
concept or serving the needs oi
the people. On Saturday,
RYM iI marched through black
and brown communities shout-
ing 'power to the people’ and
‘the streets‘ belong to the
people'. Their strategy is politi-
cal education, They feel that
not enough people are ready in
their minds to start a revolu-
tion. They are socialists who
want things like a People’s
Medical Clinic,”

Although Chicago police
seemed more restrained ‘than
at the confrontations at the
Democratic Convention 1 a s t
year, several of the Grinnell
participants were critical oi
brutal beatings given to last
week’s protesters by “the

march through the Gold Coast
district that was broken up by
police, a car driven by senior
Charles German was stopped
by police because the vehicle's
hraltelights were not working.
Police discovered a Mace pen—
a device which can spray

man said that excessive force
was used when she was thrown
into a police van and sprayed
with mace, Grinnellians also
told of instances in which po~
lino beat demonstrators who
had already been disabled.

All of the Griilrlell veterans
of the Chicago coltirontation
last week seemed to be im-,
pressed by “the dedication and

commitment" of the revolution-
ary Weathermen. And some of
that commitment may have
rubbed oil on some at them.
Sophomore Jake Margoiin
shouted at the crowd: "People
at Griniiell are not struggling.

what we’re going to do about
this revolution. . . . I want
you people to get involved!"
