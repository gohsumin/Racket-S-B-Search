lenox Quartet Will Give Concert

Th Lenox Quartet, which has.
overnight achieved the rank all
one of America's ﬁnest quartets,
will present a concert in Rob-l
erts Theater Sunday, Dec. lo, atl
2-30 p.m. This group of ll‘lllslr‘
cians met at Tanglewood only
four years ago as Fromm Flayr
ers, yet already seem destined
to become one ol the “top ﬁve"
in the very near future.

in the concert Sunday they
will perform the Haydn Quar-
tet. 0p. 76, No. 4, “Sunrise";
Elliott Carter Second String
Quartet (1959); and Beethoven
Quartet, Op, 132. t

Elliott Carter, contemporary
American composer, won the
Pulitzer Prize in Music for his
Second String Quartet (1959)
and this work has received nu-
merous performances by the
world‘s most outstanding quai»
tets. It is described by critics
as a very difficult work by even‘
the most experienced listener,
but, at the same time enormous-
ly impressive. It is, according
to Richard Howe (music), the
most “talked about" new cham-
ber work for several years.

The Beethoven Qunrtet, 0]).
132, which will end the pro-
gram, belongs to the famous
late quartets. The work is in
ﬁve lung movements, the third
or which is the well known
“Holy Song of Thanksgiving .
to the Divinity by a ConvaltzSA
cent, in the Lydian Mode." ,

The Lenox Quartct has re-
ceived outstanding reviews a-
cross the nation. Ross Parmen-.

their appearance at Carnegie
Recital Hall at which they did

there was no confusion, no lack ’

of control, no scratching, not

even any roughness. The plays ,,

ing was still exquisite, even

though it was animated by such ,

wild intensity. Each work was
approached in its own style and
each was brought vividly to life,
for clearly the group likes the
classics as well as the modems."

The Quartet is now living
in New York City, spent last
year in residence with the
Pittsburgh Symphony, and has
spent the last three summers
at Taiiglewood where they
ﬁrst met. .

All are outstanding musicians
in their own right. Peter Marsh,
1st violinist. studied under l-lans
Letz, Scott Willits and Emanuel

violinist, worked with Louis
Drasncr and Szymon Goldbcrt,
and Paul Hersh, violist, studied
at Yale and under William
Primrose. Donald McCall worked
with Leonard Rose.
