Antioch Officials

InvestigatelSD:

SCI Requests University Status

At least three Antioch studentst
have been hospitalized in Novem-I
her after using LSD, and the
number of students who have tak-
en it is rumored to be at Slgnlil‘
Cant size.

LSD is an artificial drug which
produces a blissful, ecstatic,
transforming experience full or
meaning and perceptual beauty.
It gives the subject a sense of
integration and unity wth the un-
iverse. However, the drug can
have serious side sheets—especial-
ly to the unstable.

Antioch’s administration, with
the help of a psychiatrist, is in-
vesiigating the student use of
LSD, but oltticially the problem is
in the hands ot the police.

"No prolonged hissing, embrac-
ing. or any action that outwardty
appears as such will be allowed
in proximity to the dormitories."
Such is the wording at the Public
Display of Affection rule set up
by Georgetown University's Wom-
en’s Conduct. and Standards Com-
mittee.

The rule was prompted by
consideration for girls returning
lrom studying. couples who have
just become acquainted, and

 

parents or coeds. Although the

girls asked for the order. there
were also faculty complaints a-
bout the problem.

The decismn is to be enforced
by a residence council member,
on duty at the hall's entrance on
weekends, who Will issue titty de-
meriis io those girls who violate
the rule. Fitty demerits will re
suit in a letter home lo the coed's
parents about her recent activi-
ties and confinement to her hall
for one weekend.

zoo pints oi blood were given to
the Red Cross by Monmouth stu-
dents. On November 17 Mon-
mouth held its annual Blood D0-
nation Day. The venture was billed
as a means to help Americans
in South Viet Nam. Throughout the
day various sororities and fro-
ternities competed for donor hone
ors. That day the Red Cross re-
ceived its 200th pint of blood from
the Monmouhh student body.

The State Coiiege at Iowa wants
University status, The enrollment
is now 9,000 students, but SCI
could become a university with
14,000 students by 1980, However,
the principle reason for desiring
a change in status is the loss at
good instructors because of its
non—University position.

 

Seek Recruits for Christmas Voter rbrive

Five major Civil rights organi-
zations (SNCC. MFDF, SCLC,
CORE, and NAACP) are enlisting
college students to spend a “Free
dom Christmas" in the South.
Students selected for tile project
will be working during their christ-
mas vacations in ongoing Negro
voter registration projecis in six
southern states (Mississippi, Ala-
bama, Georgia, Louisiana, North
and South Carolina).

“Freedom Christmas" valuw
teers will work primarily in coun-
ties which have federal registrars.
Organizers of the project teel that
in ihese areas a great deal can
be accomplished in ihe shun
time allowed. Since primary elec-
tiuns will be held in some areas
as early as May 3, 1966, a sum-
mer registration drive would come
too late to affect. the elections.
