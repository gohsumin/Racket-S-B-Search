llent Explains Executive Council
In Series of Hall Fireside Meetings

By DICK CHADY

“The ad hoc Committee on Resi-
dence Halls” was explained to Stu»
dents through a series of “fireside
chats" by SGA President Steve
Kent on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday oi this week, Kent, ac-
companied by Associate Dean
Richard Winters and by the CofHF
and AWS Board Presidents on
their respective campuses, ex-
plained the reasons for the com-
mittee. its membership, and the
procedure it will follow

Kent explained that his Visits to
the halls had two purposes: "(1)
to dispel any possible apprehen-
sions about the recommendations
of'tlle Executive Council, and (2)
to let students know that we are
interested in their opinions, and
that they should take the time to
write out their views for the com-
mittee."

Kent explained that the commit-
tee would give equal consideration
to the opinions or students or
groups of students and to the Ex-
ecutive Council proposals. lie
added that “There is no commit
ment on anybody’s part to any
particular change or to a change
in itself,”

He said that he and Winters had
accepted their jobs as co-chairmen
with the understanding that they
were not committed to recommend
any change unless they ielt it nec-
essary,

Winters commented that the
committee was beginning its work
"without commitment to any pro-
posals" and that it would not; neces-
sarily limit itseli to the residence
hall system, but would welcome
student opinions on “any part of
student life beyond the classroom.”

In addition to Kent and Winters
as co—chairmen, the ad hoc com»
mittee is composed oi Bob Foate,
Karen Lauterbacll, Dave Shellen-
barger, Homer Norton (history),
Henry-York Steiner (English), and
Luther Erickson (chemistry).

 

The committee was created by
President Leggett to consider the
residence hall system and report
to him in May The Executive
Council (composed of Leggett,
Stauss, the five division heads and
three other faculty members) has
already made its recommendations
(see page 9 ol this week’s S&B)t

The President will consider the
reports oi both groups before mak-
ing a decision on the future or the
residence hall system.

In his talks to the halls, Kent
emphasized a need (or students to
write out their opinions and sub-

and every group may gain a clear

Two Girls ‘Wit-hdraw' Before Break
After General Conduct Violations

By BOB HODIERNE

Two sophomore girls, a
Main Hall resident and 3
Cleveland Hall resident, were
asked to withdraw from school
on March 12, the day before
spring vacation .

The pair had' originally
been dismissed from school
but an appeal on their part
allowed them to withdraw.

The office of the deans
states that the official reason
the two were asked to with-
draw came under the terms
of the general conduct clause
in the Student Handbook. The
clause says, in effect, that the
school may ask a student to
leave if hi5701' her‘general
conduct isn’t befitting that of
a member of the college com»
munity.

At the same time, however,
the deans say there were
specific reasons for the dis-
missal.

The Main Hall resident had
recently been reported absent
from the Quad after hours.
She was reported by an an-

 

onymous phone call to Dean
of Women Jean Sloccum.

The girl felt, however, that
this “particular charge was
not the reason l was asked to
leave, It just brought me to
their attention.”

The second girl, the Cleve-
land resident,-testified to the

deans that the Main Hall girl-L3

spent the night in question in
Cleveland Hall studying,

It was out of this incident,
say the deans, that the re
quested withdrawal grew.

The deans report that they
were convinced that the Main
girl was absent from the
Quad. Further, say the deans,
an inordinate number of stu-
dents — both student officers
and non~student officers -—
were convinced that the girl
was out of the Quad overnight.

The deans felt, therefore.
that the Cleveland girl had
lied to protect the Main girl.
The Cleveland girl was al-
ready on conduct probation
for a variety of offenses in-

for the style of the dormitory are

Kuntz Accepts Offer at Emory U.
After Eighteen Years at Grinnell,

By PAUL R. JONES

Paul G. Kuntz (philosophy and
religion) is leaving in 1966 to take
over the position at head or the
philosophy department at Emory
University His departure comes
alter eighteen years in varied posi-
tions irom assistant protessor in
1948 to Noble Professor in 196}.

Before coming to Grinnell, Pro
lessor Kuntz held the jobs or as-
sistant to the dean at Harvard
University, and served as a min-
ister in Congregational and non-
denomiriational churches in Ver-
mont and Massachusetts. He has
had a rigorous education as an un»
dergraduate at Haveriord and as

a graduate student at Harvard Uni- .

versity where he received three de-
grees including his PhD.

Dantorth Fellow

Last January, Kuntz was award-
ed a Daniorth Cross-disciplinary
Fellowship out at 130 applications
irom throughout the United States.
This iellowship involves study at
a univer ‘ in a iield out of the

chose religion as his other iield,
and Emory University offered him
the post oi head or the philosophy
department to iacilate his study

When asked why he was leaving
Grinnell atter eighteen years, he
mentioned the desirability of the
offer, but he also stated that the
position involved a little more than
that. ”As tar as my relationship
with Grinnell is concerned,” he
said, “there are many closets but
no skeletons.”

Less Tension

He said that at Emory there
would be less tension since he
would be teaching only one course
per semester; he added that he
would be involved in more admin—
istrative ariairs than he was here.
He emphatically denied that this
means he is disavowing the edu

 

cational aspect. He stated that he

 

would be in a position to be of
more service not only to the school
but to the students. He has also
been concerned with his time to
work on the many publications he
has started. These include several
books and innumerable essays on

his favorite areas: aesthetics and
order.

Kuntz stated what he thought
were the greatest changes which he
has seen since he has been here.
He classified them as “sociological
changes, changes in emphasis, and .
