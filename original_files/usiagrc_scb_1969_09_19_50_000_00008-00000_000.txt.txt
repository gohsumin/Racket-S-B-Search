"This year it’s been one long
hassle." Shamberg continued,
“and I didn't feel I could do the
job justicei” He said that the
social committees are rather
self-sufficient this year. and that
the chairman doesn’t have much
say on the various social events.

When asked whether pressure

resignation, Shamberg hesitated
a moment. then said, “We had

He didn’t specify what the per»
