Flock of Letter Vultures Note:
Here's More Dirt — CDN Rigged

By ANNE FARRER

The

dorms.

The administration is still mude
tiling over the North campus prob-
lem.

The students are still mobilizing
for rules changes.

But the high point of Grlnliell’s
much-discussed degeneration oc-
curred last week-end—one of the
computer dates was rigged.

Case in point: the test scores of
one of Grinnell’s happier institu-
tional couples correlated quite
well. The iowa city computer,
however, did not deem them to
be destined for one another!
which would not be a particularly
unusual instance. When they
matched computer cards the test
score correlation evaporated and
two worthy members or Honor G
implied to the male half of the
couple that the test scores
“might” have experienced a bit
oi an accident on their way to
lowa City.

From this perspective, the
screaming and trauma which took
place in the post oiirce as students
discovered the identity of their
dates Saturday morning projected
an unnerving image of the higher
powers ois‘ganizing the program-
ming for the computer, chuckling
“heh, heh" to themselves, taking
another drag on a cigarette, and
organizing and chuckling some
more.

However the 5&3 is not a pub
llcation of the muckraking variety
(letters . to - the - editor notwith-
standing) and does not postulate a
policy of antiathleticism (the ad
itor plays lM basketball and the
associated editor plays pingrpong).
Thcreiore, ln all respect tor, and
iairness to, Honor G, it must be
said that the monumental manner
in which most of the computer
dates bombed out or lucked out
could not have been rigged.

Perhaps the most surprising and
one or the more successiul coup-
les was Jun Streitt, lreshman
cheerleader, and Henry Wilhelm,
elderly (22) photographer, Said
Henry Saturday afternoon with
typical computer date rueiulness,
“I've already decided that I'd
marry her it she wants to.“ in
comparison to the "Good God,
I’m too young to die" expletives.
it was one of the calmer view-
points expressed.

The over-all atmosphere was
rather a harking back to sixth
grade behavior and psychology—
“Heck. I don‘t want to dance with
HER”—0r in some cases on a
more elevated junior high level—
“I wonder it he’s thinking the
same thing about me? I think I'm
going to be sick.”

Quite a iew junior, senior wom-
en - freshmen men combinations
occurred. This is not to imply that
there is anything unfortunate or
unusual in such age differentia-
tion, but only to note that several
interesting manifestations ensued

 

from such situationsinamely at
the Rex. where the boys had to
quit their senior, ID-possessing
dates and heat a hasty retreat to
the men’s room when a represents
ative oi the Grinnell police force
entered the scene.

As tor the ton-campus activities
there was ii rock and roll dance
ta great means of releasing frus-
tration and proh‘ably the saving
grace of the entire evening since
the music was so loud it was im-
possible to talk even if someone
had Wanted to) and a movie ”The
Easy Life" (it's not, many people
discovered).

The exhibition badminton game
at the half-time of the Monmouth
game between Cindy Root and
Coach Kowert could be considered
as symbolic of the computer date
night—depending on one's view-
point, either it was a draw or
they smeared each other.
