Julian Bond Claims Racial Gan Widening;
“The Choioe is l’olire”

“I would like to discuss the
U.S.A,," Julian Bond told a
nearscapacity crowd in Darby
Gymnasium last Friday night.
“It has become a warfare state."

. The controversial young
Georgia state legislator was on
campus as part of the Program
in Practical Political Educa-
tion. The topic of Bond’s ad-
dress was “The Outsiders: the
Poor, the Black, the Young.”

“The hopes oi black people
have turned to disillusionment,"
Bond said. “A bottle some of
us thought was won at the lunch
counter is being lost at the bai<
lot box." Discussing the gap
between black and white, Bond
said he was “seeing it grow
larger and larger.“

Earlier in the day, Bond
held a press conference in the

which he said students should
"find political contests and is-
sues that exist in the commu-
nity, When an issue is raised,
they ought to get involved,"

The black legislator also com-
mented on the Black Panthers.
“They are leading in the politi-
calization ut black people,"
Bond asserted. "They are mov-
ing toward an economic analy—
sis rather than just a political
analysis or the problems.”

"To build another party in
this Country, I think you would
have to do it over a period or
years," Bond told the press.

Looking towards the future,
he is “more optimistic about
the political future of black
people than about their ecu<
nomic future. I see black
people taking power in their
communities."

This theme was echoed in his
address when he told the audia
ence that southern blacks have
“begun to organize political and
economic g r o u p s responsive
and responsible to themselves
and themselves alone.”

Bond was highly critical of
the Nixon welfare proposals.
He said the answer would be
tor “the lederal government to
take over all welfare.“ Com-
menting on Daniel Moynihan's
projection that even if the
Vietnam war were ended, there
would be no additional iunds
tor domestic problems, sond
said it was as though America
was now “spending inr war
while the nation looks for new
worlds to conquer."

When asked about the con-

spiracy trials scheduled to be-
gin in Chicago on September
24th, Bond said they were “po-
litical trials or people the gov-
ernment wants to crush.”

“it people are interested in
expressing their toelings that
people should be able to dem-
onstrate and speak treely, per-
haps they should go to Chi-
cago." (Demonstrations are
planned during the trial.)

Concluding his speech, Band
told the predominantly white
audience, “the choice is, after
all, yours. It has never been
ours.”

AWARE Outlines Activities for Second Year

An organization created to
work with racial attitudes on
the local level, the Association
of Whites for the Advancement
oi Racial Equality (AWARE),
held its ﬁrst meeting at the
year on Sunday, September 14,
in the South Lounge. Some 40
students gathered to discuss the
problems involved in educating
the college and town toward
racial awareness. In its efforts
to reach the town, AWARE
last year initiated I study-
group, town-college movies,
and on extensive bibliography
ot race-relations hooks drawn
1mm many aourcm

This year, says senior Karen
Frank, an AWARE organizer,
most of the procedures and
methods of the organization will
he the same as last year. Again

 

Freshmen Blamed for Long Lines

At least 50 students have
complained to the Student Co~
ordinator's ottice about the

length at lines at meals. in re
sponse to these complaints, the
Coordinator’s Office is conducta
ing an investigation of the
problem,

Clarence “Chuck” Hand, Di-
rector ot the Food Service, at.
tributed the oiitioulties to typi—
cal beginning-ci-the~year prob»
lems: ireshmen are less ac-
quainted with the mechanics oi
choosing toad and ireshmen
SAGA workers need time to get
oriented. Both or the problems
have been compounded this
year by the huge size or the
treshman class.

Hand added that part or the
problem at this point in the
year is that students have not
yet had time to determine

which dining rooms are free at
which times.

The Student Coordinator’s Of-
tice, after looking into the
matter briefly, believes that
part of the problem is caused
by general slowness or students
in taking their iood and silvere
ware. They ask that students
make an eiiort to speed up the
progression ihrmigh the cafe-
teria line.

-— if and when the organization
receives moneyrthere will be
an attempt to get a movie such
as the 0maha»ﬁlmed “Time for
Burning." A study group in
town will also be renewed on
a regular basis.

This year’s studyrgroup
meeting was on Wednesday
night at the Congregational
Church, headed by Mrs. Sally
Moore, wile of Asst. Professor
Edward Moore.

Discussed at the meeting was
the question of whether
AWARE should concentrate on
educating its members on cam
pus, or jumpdnto town prob-
lems and education. The con-
sensus was that it would be most:
profitable to work closely with
the town, as soon as possible.

Last year’s AWARE panel
discussion of black power in lO<
cal churches will be followed
this year by similar discussions
with ministers, church youth
groups; and church members,
coordinated by the AWARE’S
Church Committee.

In a statement of AWARE’s

purpose, released before last
Sunday’s meeting, one purpose
listed was “making an eii'ol‘t
to keep Grinnell College facil-
itie open to adults and teen-
agers from town as much a:
possible." in keeping with this,
Karen Frank said there may
be a scheduled town-college
open house in the near iuture.
Townrcollege relationships will
not be successful, she Said, “if
they hate us.”

This year’s AWARE activities
will be run by ad-hoc commit-
tees, including church and edu-
cation committees. Meetings or
these groups will be more ire-
quent and regular than general
AWARE meetings. At commit-
tee meetings, the members will
report on their individual eta
forts, and the response to their
efforts in town.
