The Hidden Faces of Laiin America

tury Nicaraguan born Ruben
nan‘o, considered by many the
most outstanding poet at his
time, not just in Lat Amcre
ica biit anywhere. it is charac-
tcrizcd by a richness ol ex l
pression which combines .me- .
dievai, renaissance, baroque,
neoclassic, romantic,
ist, and Parnassian elements,
artiully and essentially inles
grated in simple and commun-
icative verse,

The meaning of his poetry is
conveyed instantaneously and
ettcrtlcssly Incredibly, selective
and complex as Ruben Dario
he does not withdraw to his
ivory tower but succeeds in
shai rig his inner uorld with the
public Thus, the reader catchesl
a glimpse of hitherto unsuspect l
ed htiman horizons. .

Ruben Dal-io‘s poetry is un-‘
translatable because of its style.

A twentieth century Argen-
tine poet, Jorge Luis Borges,
creates a surprisingly eliective
and suggestive neulogioal
language which he combines
with a local Buenos Aires
language pregnant with mean-
ing.
His ncoiogisi-ns are derived
by means of an etymological
process similar to that of the
natural evolution of the Spanish
language So masterfully does
he create new words and
squeeze universal
of Argentine words that he suc-
ceeds in communicating to a,
nonrAl’grentlne and a non-Span-
ish-speaking person the inner
struggle of the modern ed-
ucated Argentine citizen torn
between his present-Argen-
tian and his past—Spain, Europe

The origin of Latin Almcrr
ica‘s revolutions, dictatorships
and upheavals since the nines
teenth century, has been a
concern'ol our present generr
ations oi American students.
It is becoming an even more
poigant one as our restless
neighbors to the South he-
come more internationally in-
volved. This concern has also
been the concern of Latin
Americans themselves.

But whereas we approach the
Latin American problem from
a political and cconomic VleWV
point, they themselves approach
it from a psychological and phils
osophical viewpoint. A good
deal of Latin America's mosti
outstanding literature and aiti
is an attempt to reach below
the surtacc of lite and grasp
the /undellylng meaning ol the
Latin civ lzation. 1t responds to
