Open House

Sometime this weekend the Dean of the College
,Will issue a letter to students defining the particulars
of the college Open House program as it has been
worked out by administration and student leaders and
approved by the Board of Trustees. We would like to
take this early opportunity to commend the Dean and
all who worked on the program. The Open House pro-
‘gram not onlycseeks to satisfy all the various college in~
terests, but it also seeks to establish a criterion by
.which students can measure their freedom. We feel it
'does this, and that much of the success in this program
will stem from the fact that it has been the result of
go-operative effort on the part of both students and ad-
ministration who have responsibly merged divergent

needs in seeking the solution to a particular dilemma.

Double Welcome

*

Only once this year, but it will be a weekend to rev
member. This time we welcome not only moms and
dads but also the grads — recent and not so recent. It‘s
a weekend to look forward to even if it does mean that
you have to stand in line fifteen minutes longer for Sat—
urday night Saga steaks — but they may be better than
usual.

The campus is festive; all week they've been
mowing the grass arid smoothing out the mounds of dirt
which have so far somewhat hidden from view the not-
quite-finished Forum. Amid the color of homecoming
mums and festivities of the game and the dance will
be, the meeting of parents and greeting old friends who
have journeyed back to their Alma Mater,

The little tang of louesomeness in those of us whose
parents could not make the trip will not last long, for
we will share the happiness of seeing our friends with
their families and knowing that the college life is at
least a little more meaningful for the entire family.

And We can be reassured that this life is something
of value when we see again those who have “escaped”
to the real world, yet find it worth their while to come
back to Grinnell to see old friends and familiar places.

Combining Homecoming and Parents Weekend,
then, seems not only to give us a weekend contact with

i the real world while we are on campus, but also to say
to us that the real world thinks we’re doing something
good here — at least something worth a journey and a
crowded, hectic, yet very enjoyable weekend, to visit.

We hope that not only the guests but the college
community enjoy themselves, and that it will be a
'weekcnd to remember, pleasantly

SCARLET AND BLACK

Dear Editor:

My penetrating observations
on campus immaturity were
definitely confirmed by two lete
ters in last week's SELB. In this
present letter I shall answer
charges made by Paul R.
Jones, ‘68, while incorporating
the letter of Mr. A. Youthful
Upperclassman into my proof.
Jones assaults my letter for
three reasons,

Though Jones disagrees, the
enlightened ircslimen do view
the campus as being immature.

Jones tags my letter as im-
mature and thus fails to per-
ceive the scope of my inten-
tions, Its purpose is far greater
than Jones realizes. Mr. Jones,
reread my letter.

My convictions are strong,
but “the innocent humor” of
the prepping program necessi
tates anonymity. Fear. the
force that moved Jonathan

 

Swift, Anonymous, and Alexan-
der Pope to cloak their true
identities, also intimidates me.

in the concluding portion of
this letter, I wish to offer other
examples of immaturity. Mr.
A. Youthful Upperclassman’s
letter is the epitome of imma-
turity. upperclassmen immatur»
ily. AYU‘s defense of the prep-
ping program is illogical arid
absurd — adjectives that chain
actcrlze the program itself.
AYU speaks of “lifelong cam-
airaclerie," but who wants to be
friends with irrational sadisls
who release their lrustrauons
on innocent freshmen. Also
are the $40,000 Worth of books
stolen from the library ”merely
innocent exuberances?” Every
line of this classic exhibits a
similar irresponsible attitude.
One can easily dismiss thi
“youthful” letter. .

To the Editor:

Several students at Grinnell
this year have displayed their
savage irresponsibility and have
flaunted before the whole col-
lege community by their total
disregard for college property.
These students, not being happy
With the color and condition of
the paint on the walls of their
rooms, have repainted their
walls! It’s true. They actually
went downtown and bought
paint and brushes, went back to
their rooms, and (probably in
the dead of night) spent five
or six hours painting their
walls. The colors of these new-
ly painted rooms are, admit-
tedly, almost in keeping with
our fine college standards:
light blue. white. and beige are
the colors in the rooms with
which I am familiar. But this,
of course, is irrelevant. Neither
is it important that the walls
have been improved, nor that
the students have used their
own money and taken their own
time to make their rooms a
little more desirable. We also
must not consider the fact that
the college probably saves from
thirty-five to fifty dollars on
each room that is repainted by

a student. None or these things
are important. The important
thing is that students are, in
general, a very destructive and
irresponsible g r o u p. They
should be punished as often as
possible when they step out. of
line. A lot of times this pun-
ishment, for one reason or an-
other, cannot be carried out
properly, but in at. least two of
the "room painting episodes"
our wonderfully efficient and
just Buildings and Grounds De-
partment has hit upon a beauti-
in] and appropriate punish
ment: they are going to re
paint Lhe repainted rooms and,
naturally, send the bills, to the
guilty students. (And, in at
least one case, they are going
to repaint the walls the same
color the student has painted
them). Can't you just imagine
the smiles over the physical
plant when they mail out the
bills? “Boy, wait’ll they see
these bills. That’ll fix ’em." It’s
easy to imagine their satisfac-
tion. And so, if in your hall
there is a leaking water pipe
or a pluggedrup sink, you’ll
have to wait a while before it's
fixed: 5&6 is in the punish-
merit business these days.

SEPTEMBER IS HERE. Up-

freshmen have just arrived.
Why? The immedlale and time

“I want [0 get an education,"
"I want a liberal education,”
“I Want to be successful in my
career," and “Frankly, I want
to be able [0 make money.“
These are valid reasons; they
are the ones that we all assor

fortunately, however, for many
of us these are our only rea

Perhaps the things We will
