campuses ‘round the country . . .
The Berkeley Free Speech Move-
ment (FSM) won an apparent vic-
tory when the Academic Senate or
the University oi Cailiornia passed
812-144 a resolution Calling for none
interference with student political
activity. When University Presi-
dent Kerr presented the resolution
to the Board at Regents ior ap-
proval, however, the Regents up-
held their ban against oncampus
filndrraising and recruiting tor oiia
campus activities.

Three Smith College coeds pur
chased a ten-yearroldyiiom pound
female hippopotamus at a Brook-
lyn 100 auction. Their written bid
or $400 was accepted by Brooklyn
Zoo Commissioner R. I. Browne on
a cashrand-Carry basis. Smith Col-
lege spokesmen said, “The college
is not prepared to handle a hippu~
potanlus on campus."

 

Antioch College in Yellow
Springs, Ohio, held “sensitivity-
irainiiig" workshops tor students
and faculty. Groups of ten to
iilteen individuals talked about
themselves and each other, spelled
out frankly their reactions toward
each others behavior. and tried
out dirrerent types or behavior tor
themselves. The Antioch Record
wrote, “what group therapy is for
‘sick' people, sensitivity training is
tor normal, healthy psychesy

Newsy freshman Girl Is Dedicated to
Being Bumfuzzled Would-Be Critic

By Anne Farrer

During one’s ireshman year at
Grinnell, oue encounters many,
trials and tribulations _ one ot‘
which may be working on theE
5&3, it one is so dedicated to thel
principles oi journalistic honesty
and/or is suckered into it. More
specifically traumatic is being
asked very nicely. if somewhat
iorceiully, to write a newsy little
bit about the recent art exhibits
scattered here and there about
campus. This is all good and well.
especially since I’m taking a fine
arts course # only it’s Intro to
Speech and Theatre. 'Thereicre,
this leaves us with one extremely
ignorant reporter with one heck
of an assignment.

So (he one bumiuzzled would-be
art critic takes pencil and heart
in hand and goes trapping over to
the Forum and blankly stares at
the exhibition of "Paul Strand's
Mexico" for the better part of a
half hour. She then admits defeat
and resorts to reading a 12 page
article on Strand written by some
one who did know what he was
talking about. She finds out a
good many interesting things about
Paul Strand — his belief in the
worth of man. his artistic appeal
for social reform, his problematic
approach, his perfectionism, his
opposition to commercial conven-
tions, his greatness. To borrow a
statement: “Paul Strand is an art-
ist oi thetpeople. They are the only

 

patrons he serves."

The critic jg, being now quite
fired up about art, photography
and Strand, charges back to the
exhibition, mutters in an awed
tone “Wow — what photos, what
a guy # wow: and tears on to
bat out her story just in time lor
the deadline.

Ed, Note; Miss Farrer got her
story in by the deadline, but she
{oi-got to mention that Strand‘:
works can be seen now until Jan.
26. Another art exhibit, iroin
Artists Equity Association or
Minnesota, is on display In
Selieali'er Gallery until Jan. 25.
