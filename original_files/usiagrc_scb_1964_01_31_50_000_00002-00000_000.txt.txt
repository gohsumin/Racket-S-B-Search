Editorial “Zip" Code

In attempting to ire-evaluate the “letters to the
editor” department and establish a norm for letter
publication in the year to come, two things require
primary consideration. First, such a department is of
very little value unless it is a weekly presentation of
quality contributions, Second, the problem of keep-
ing the department going demands responsibility on
the part of both the S&B and its readers.

The problem of keeping a steady stream of letters
ﬂowing into the editor’s office is contingent both upon
reader interest in campus issues and the journalistic
integrity of the editor with regard to all letters sub-
mitted.

In 1964 it will be our practice to print those letters
which the college situation deems relevant or of in—
terest. We will not allow prejudice or personal opinion
to color our choice of letters for this department. The
“letters to the editor" column should exist as one of
reader opinion, and not of editorial opinion.

It seems especially important to stress the fact
that a prerequisite for publication in the “letters” col-
umn doesn’t necessarily mean that a letter must criti-
cize or complain. Letters of praise for some event or
person, letters of agreement on some issue, or letters
of evaluation concerning some campus discussion are
just as much a part of any good ”letters" department
as are letters of criticism.

Although it is impossible at times to print every
letter submitted to the S&B, each letter submitted
will either be printed or acknowledged by a personal
letter from the editor explaining why it was not used.

The ”letters to the editor” department is open,
then, to you our readers Last week we stated that it
would exist as an open forum for opinion, discussion,
and debate. We have stated here that every effort will
be made on this side of the editor’s desk to maintain a
readers’ opinion department of quantity and quality.
The rest is up to you,

Goldwater Favored to Take
Mock Convention Nomination

 

0n the strength of the results
of a poll published by the Young
Republican newsletter, the YR
Pioneer, Senator Barry Gold-
water is the pre-convention fa-
vorite to win the Republican
nomination for president in the
upcoming Mock Political Con-
vention. In the poll Goldwater
was the choice of 46 per cent
of the 97 Young Republicans
who responded to the poll. His

. closest rival, Governor Nelson
' Rockefeller, was the choice of
only 13 per cent who responded.
However, much has changed
since the death of President
Kennedy, and preliminary re-
ports on the latest YR Pioneer
poll indicate that Goldwater
‘may have lost strength on the
‘Grinnell campus. The results
of the poll are to be released
In February.

Dave Evans, President of die
iYoung Democrats club, says
that a group in his club has or»
ganized and is planning a cam-

 

paign to secure the Democratic
vice-presidential nomination for
Wyoming Senator Gale McGee.
it was announced last week in
the 5&3 that Senator McGee
would keynote the Democratic
session.

Bob Savage, President of the
Young Republicans, says he ex-
pects a similar movement to
arise in his club pushing the
nomination of Mark Hatfield for
the second spot on the GOP
ticket. Hatfield is in his second
term as Governor of Oregon, He
will keynote the opening session
of the convention on April 9 and
act as presiding officer for that
session.

Interest in the Republican
convention w as stimulated
this week by speculation as to
whether a group would back
the candidacy of Margaret
Chase Smith. The Maine Sen-
ator announced her intention
to enter the New Hampshire
and Illinois primaries this
week.

Miscellany and Digression

An undergraduate is expect-
ed to be idealistic, and a. senior
is expected to be cynical, Not
wishing to destroy these stere-
otypes today’s column will deal
With that wonderful world of
make believe, the interim ses—
sion.

Theoretically for fresh-
men and sophomores the inc
terim session is a time for in-
dependent study. However,
if we naively believe the defh
nition of the word independ-
ent that appears in the dic-
tionary, l. e. free from con-
trol or persuasion, we see
that than is a contradiction
between theory and practice
in the interim session.

For if a freshman or a sopho—
more were to utilize this time
for true independent reading
and study, he very probably
would not choose the course of
study which the college out-
lines for the interim session.

Freddie Freshman, (it is ala
ways good writing technique to
toss in a name here and there
to give the reader something to
identify With,) is requested, l.
e., told, to independently read
the Aeneid, Both freshmen and
sophomores are encouraged to
independently do reading from
a bibliography supplied by the
school to prepare themselves
for the lectures of Messrs. Hoff-
mann, Hanson and Burke,
which they are urged to inde»
pendently attend.

Now I wish to cast no asper—
sions on these gentleman who
undoubtedly are well qualified
in their ﬁelds and will give ex-
cellent lectures which will bene-
ﬁt all who attend.

For those students who have
been waiting all semester for
a respite from courses to do in
dependent study on "Actio In
Distans: Gravitation for New4
tonians and Post Newtonians,”
the program outlined by the
college is a godsend

It is also probably wel-
comed by those students who
have not developed ally in-
dividual curiosities or inter-
ests and are relieved that the
college has prepared a pro-
gram for the period between
semesters which will enter

tain them or at least keep
them ocCupied so they do not
die of boredom. As it stands
now the student feels that if
he is going to do anything he
might as well follow the pro-
gram set up by the college.
Few do.

We must not forget the up-
perclassmen in this biased anal—
ysis of the interim session. The
juniors are involved in prepar-
ation for the Junior Liberal
Arts examination — Grinnel!‘s
unique device to rid itself of a
vast overstock of paper, ensure
that the post office and service
bureau are constantly function-
ing, and provide, “a means of
evaluation other than the usual
course grades and grade point
average.”

Already the JLA, as it is af—
fectionately known, has cov-
ered the nature of man and the
areas of evidence and evalua-
tion. This year the junior class
will write definitive essays on
order. One topic reportedly
ready for a future year is the
nature of the JLA.

For Seniors, the interim ses-
sion is analogous to the peri-
od between the sentence and
the execution. Literature ma-
jons had the good luck to
have the privilege of taking
part of their comps two days
after ﬁnals. They were able
to avoid some of the torture of
waiting.

History majors are fortun-
ate in that to do well in the
essay portion of their comps
no prior knowledge of his-
tory is required. They are
given a semester of reading
’to do during the interim on
which the essay examination

will be based. Any student
with a proficiency in speed

I o a d l n g, a photographic

mind, and a gift of eloquence

should be able to do well on
the history essay.

What can be done wlth the
interim session? Why not set
up a program whereby stu-
dents are required to present a
plan for independent study dur-
ing the interim to their advise
or? This program could include
reading or the working on a
project. Part or all of the work
could be required in a field sep-
arate from the student’s major.
