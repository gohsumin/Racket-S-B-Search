Travel Industry Provides Varied
. l Services & Prices for Students

By JOHN GARDNER

Student off-campus travel varies from a mid-semester trip to
thicago to a year spent abroad. This travel, in all its forms, has
iven rise to profitable industries which Cater to student travelers.

, hey provide published rates and programs for a variety of trips.
They give information to students as to how to save money
and how to visit parts of countries not usually looked for by
tourists. Thus the services of this type oi: travel agency may
range from a carefully organized Mediterranmn Cruise to a pro-
yam for part-time work and part-time study in Madrid. Students
affected represent 3% of the student population, in contrast with
tho 3% of the adult population which travels to Europe yearly.

U.S. Travel

The airline domestic fares in the United States generally in-
clude the standby youth tare for those in the 12 to 22 age bracket.
In this plan, a student pays only half fare for a one-way ticket
ror any seat which is unclaimed at boarding time. in view or the
tncreased numbers of regular travelers, some airlines do not have
standby rates at certain times of the year, such as Christmas,

when many people travel.
. Braniff, Delta, and Eastern Airlines now have a reserved
uth rare. For‘two-thirds or the regular price of a seat any person
izo to 22, and those in the military, may reserve a seat. A round-
trip excursion called the “Discover America” allows travelers to
pay 1/, return fare. The alrlines’ youth and "Discover America"
[area do have is few restrictions, such as a time limitation for
return, and they do not include [lights leaving on Friday evenings.

i Europa

‘ “It's cheap, because there‘s no entry fee to the Luxembourg alr-
pcrt. The food's bad, and the accomodations are lousy,” says
David Ruhe (’71) about the [light irorn New York to Luxembourg
on one of the least expensive transatlantic airlines, Icelandic
'Airlines. The round-trip costs $389 in the summer season and $319
in the winter season.

Bahamas Airways is a new competitor for low rates; Nas-
laurLuxembourngassau costs was all year long.

There are certain group rates and charter rates on overseas
lravel which sometimes are very low for individuals, Often in-
cluded is a sum oi money inr tour arrangements (such as train
trips into the country, guide expenses). To charter a plane an
organization must have lower than a certain number or members.
For example, the National Student Association, which has hundreds
of thousands of members is exempt, but Grinnell College, with
only two thousand members, would be eligible. A Charter load on a
jet is 150-180 persons, and a group can be [mm 14 persons on.

Ship Travel

Ship travel tends to be more expensive than plane travel. A
Iypical one way tare begins at 5275 on regular passenger lines.
Many people travel by sea because or the greater opportunities
to meet people while traveling. This seems to be a less attractive
Ieliing point to students than to nonrstudenrs, however.

In the summertime, there are usually several low Cost ships
traveling the Atlantic with fares as low 88 $170 to $200 for the
one way journey. Another low cost way to travel by sea is by
rreighter. They take no more than 12 passengers, and space i!
ditiicult to get, even as much as one year in advance.

programs
A February 1968 list of organizations specializing in student

travel lists 150 entries. Some, such as the American Institute lor
Foreign Study, are planned for the whole year and include special
Itudy arrangements, cholce or professors and courses, housing,
extra-curricular actwtties, and so on. Others last for the summer
or tor a few weeks during the summer. Together with organiza-
lions that provide educational and work arrangements, organiza«
tions such as American Youth Hostel cater to the student market
with very low-Cost accommodations.

in the next article, a Crosséection of some of these organiza<
lions will be studied: how they work and what services they can
proVide lo the temporary student visitor.

Sachs & Tinker Push Home Rule

Bonnie Tinker, ’69, member
of the Council of Thirteen and

adviser to Richard Schneirov in'

the recent
charges of

open hearing on
illegal visitation,

called a meetingot students in— '

terested in discussing the case
for Thursday evening, October
10, at 7:30 pm. in South
Lounge. Joshua Sachs, '71, and
Miss Tinker presided over the
meeting. Plans for the meeting
were the result of a previous
meeting by some students held
Tuesday, October 9, the evening
after the hearing. About 40
students attended the Thursday
meeting,

Sachs and Miss Tinker sum-
marized previous events as
preparation for the topic or the
evening, discussion of the prin-
ciples of "self-determination”
and "home rule" for individual
halls, Miss Tinker stressed that
the meeting was in accord with
a student Senate resolution,
passed the previous evening,
recommending that ways be
round to begin discussions on
the idea of “home rule.”

According to Miss Tinker,
the Thursday meeting was not:
an attempt to bypass present
discussion going on through
"established channels" or the
student Affairs Committee, but
was intended to encourage in-
dependent discllssion of what
attitudes exist in the halls on
the issues of coeducational use
of hall rooms and the choices
imposed by the principle or self-
determination.

Thomas J. Thomas, ’70, made
the following comment on Miss
Tinker's motion: “A lot of it
boils down to how persuasive a
selling job you can do in the
Forum with a prof." .

A consensus of those at the
meeting seemed to indicate that
more people believed in the
possible success of experimen-
tation in “self-determination"
tor halls, and floors, than in
passing a mandatory rule for
24-hour opens.

Five persons volunteered to
lerve on a Committee, known
as the Ad Hoc Student Commie
tee tor Dorm Changes, to
write a proposal based on “self-
determination." The committee
members are Joshua Sachs.

chairman; Bruce Nissen, ‘70,
Lucy Blount, ‘71, Barbara Dev-
ereux, '72. and John Gardner.
’71. Sachs said of the commits
tee’s lunction, "We want to
come up with as much objective
information as possible about
the potentials and problems in
different dorms. What we want
to do is to issue a thorough
report on hall self-determina-
tion. We deﬁnitely encourage
people to come to our hearings
or contact members or the ad
hoc committee.” The first
meeting of the committee was
planned for 4 pm. Monday, 0c-
tober 14, in the South Lounge.

A number of students VOIUTIF
teered to discuss the idea of
“self-determination" in the
halls; hall meetings on the
subject were recommended for
October 14 and 15.

College Buys
Biology Land

Grinnell College has pun
chased a 365-acre tract at land
in Jasper County for use as a
biology field preserve and la-
boratory. The land, which spans
the Skunk River nine miles
southwest of Grim-lei], was pun
chased with funds made avail-
able by a private toundatlon.
"It has all of the characteris
tics necessary to serve the
teaching interests of four of the
eightrmember biology iaculty
and to strengthen considerably
the departmental teaching capa-
bilities not only in courses for
general students and biology
majors, but also for indepen<
denl. Student research in ecolo.
av," remarked President Legs
gett. '

One of the outstanding lea-
iures of the tract is the diver-
sity oi habitat. There are com
(lguous areas or woodland,
grassland, marsh or bottomland,
and terrain Suitable for the con-
struction of small ponds. Plan:
for the field preserve and labor-
atory, which are now being ion-
mulated. tentatively include the
development of new forest areal
and ponds. Existing woodland
will be permitted to develop un.
disturbed, and some of the flat-
land will be allowed to revert
to natural prairie.
