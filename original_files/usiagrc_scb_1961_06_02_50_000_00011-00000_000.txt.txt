by the average margin of 51
runs; when they lost it was by_
a 2d margin.
or the six loses, three were

pointed out, “All you need is the

the activity is worthwhile."

Shopping, theater performances
and sporting events in nearby
large cities became the ohjects of
trips by various groups.

Winter sports were emphasized
with a well-rounded program in.
cluding ice skating, ice fishing
and skiing. A rink was impro-

ivised next to Darby Gymnasium

which provided for both hockey
pleasure skating complete

ends.

ice fishing was offered as a
recreational pastime on the near—
by Rock Creek Lake.

The skiing program was one
of the most rewarding. Visits to
local slopes took place weekly'
and, as interest gained, longer
jannts were arranged to Wis-
consin and Colorado over se-
