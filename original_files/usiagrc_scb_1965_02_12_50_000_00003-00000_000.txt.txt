Coed Urges New

School Calendar

Conform to Summer Job Chances

To the Edltor:

I would like to express an opinion
about the new proposal lor the 1965-
66 academic calendar. I am cer-
tainly in favor at having examina-
tions belore Christmas vacation,

because I have long telt the futility
of attempting to study at home
during Christmas vacation. From
past experience, i have round that
students arrive home tor the holi-
days tar more exhausted, both
physically and mentally. than at
any other time during the year.
it has always seemed to be quite
unrealistic tor the faculty to as-
sign papers during this convales-
cent period.

1 do hope that some provision
Will be made so that seniors will
be able to arrive early on campus
“1 January to study or Comps. As
I have said above, it is difficult to
concentrate on studies during the
holidays at home, But most impor-
tant, it is many times imperative
to use the library while preparing

Editor Gets Letter
On Identity Crisis

To the Editor:

As Grinnell parents for the
past four and a half years and
with the anticipation or keep»

ing that status for another four
and a half years, we have been
interested readers of the Scar-
let and Black.

We enclose an article from
the SL Louis Post Dispatch of
January 22, 1965, written in an.
swer to an editorial on possible
causes at the Berkeley difficul-
ties. It presents a very differ-
ent yet possibly perceptive as-
pect of the many faceted Camp—
us unrest problem. We've read
some other side5#how about
this one?

Your editorial “Nobody Knows
My Name” should be entitled “I
Do Not Know My Name." If the
behavior or people is to be divined
then there must be a genetic un-
derstanding at» them. Nothing new
is happening to the young Amer-
icali intellectual, he is only adapt-
mg or misadopting to the times
as he always has and will.

The extol-ti Dictionary states
state adolescence continues to age
25 in a man and 21 in a woman. In
this age of equality of the sexes
you can see that it should be age
25 for both. Erik Erikson, profes
sor ot psychology at Harvard Uni-
versity, has called this period an
"identity Cl’tsis.” From 12 to 25

ror Comps since many departments
require a great dealor reserved
reading. Also, it will be practically
impossible to begin extensive prep—
aration tor Comps involving re-
served reading beforc Christmas
Vacation since we will be in the
midst of ﬁnal examinations, A
third point is that it will be rather
inconvenient to Carry home so
many books. Literature majors
would never make it.

I am disturbed about classes
beginning September 6, Labor Day.
It had never dawned on me that
Grinnell College would ever begin
classes on a national holiday when
it is practically a national habit to
begin the academic year after this
date. As a result, in applying for
summer jobs. l committed myselr
to staying through Labor Day. I
have applied to summer resorts.
It seems to me that I can correctly
say that most summer jobs expect
college students to arrive the sec.
ond week in June and to stay
through Labor Day. This is par
ticularly the case with national
park and resort jobs. For example,
Glacier National Park requires
its employees to work irom June
15 to September 15. And I would
be willing to say that many Grin-
nell students work in jobs which
have these stipulations. Therefore,
I do not understand Dean Stauss'
statement, as reported in the 5&3,
that employment would be easier
if school were to and earlier. I
rattler think that the reverse is
true.

I think that it would be a good
idea if students whose summer
employment is affected by the new
calendar proposal would write to
Mr. Siauss. After all, most of us
do help finance our education
through summer employment.

myself” becomes “nobody knows
me.” Revolutions occurring within
him become revolutions outside of
him. It is no different today. Thir-
ty years ago they were “young lett~
ists or Communists.” With matur-
ity and a settlement or the mental
lire, they become capitalists.

The University of California at
Berkeley affair is only another cul-
tural manifestation of this prob~
lem. Less turbulent cultural out-
lets include the eating ot goldﬁsh
and panty raids.

Democracy is not anarchy. Any
situation can be seen as oppression
especially to the adolescent mind.
To live together niles must be
obeyed, Change must take place
through discussion. evolun'on and
not revolution. Control must be
maintained and discipline is news
sary. Certainly students must be
met, issues discussed and compro-
lniscs made.

However, in a peripheral way,
adults and institutions must set
limits for adolescents. There is
freedom within these limits.

175 students indicated that may had

Booth or Schwab even though it

The poll was taken by 323 women

Political Selection
Calls for Reforms

“Obstacle Course on Capitol
Hill," which calls for institu-
tional reforms of the United
States Congress, has been se»
lected as the February—March
Book-Of-the-Month by Grin-
nell's Program in Practical
Political Education.

Using the long—standing and
still unresolved issue of federal
aid to education as the organiz-
ing theme or the book, Author
Robert Bendiner blames the
"mechanical arrangements" of
Congress — the seniority sys<
tem. filibuster, undemocratic
rules and procedures, etc, —
for the frustration of the public
Will and the failure of needed
legislation.

“This case-study of congres-
sionlal action and inaction is
particularly appropriate and il-
luminating now that the focus
of public attention has shifted
from the presidential campaign
to the Congress," observed C.
Edwin G i l m o u r (political
science), director of the. PPPE.
