Vietnam Examined

Dear Sir,

Most people are completely wrong
About the nature of the Vietnam Wait
The causes of America's involvement
are not ideological, economic nor racial
The United States is in Vietnam (or
sexual reasons.

America's traumatic toilet-training 01
its uncontrolled frontier self has resulted
in anal-tixahons, classic symptoms oi
nationality and suspicion of devrauou,
slmplistlc thinking, and overemphasis
on purity and iastldiousuesst The result-
Ant extremes ot Purimn morality now
clash with the license or present eoonom-
icvtechnological mores to produce a te-
rnale population or technical virgins and
a male population of Playboy-aspirants
who share the repressed fear of real love,
and look for the ideal faceless, name—
less female body who desires their kind
oi semi-relationship.

The result is that the appearance or
democratic purity in Vietnam must be
protected item the licentious, perverted
commie hoards oi slantreyed gooks, who
use their own manure to fertilize their
crops. The venereal disease of Marxism
must not be allowed to blemish the VI)”-
gtnal, inherited and God-given Vlelnam-
ese peasant ideals ol Americaliastyle
democracy. The solution, or course, is
to purity the land or disease with a sad-
ulnusochlslic rite of tire!

Imagine the young, potent soldier in
a jet lighter dropping cylindrical bombs,
and Illing these smooth, tubular rockets
into allrieceivilig, allrdemandlng Mother-
inrage Earth. Think at that marvellousiy
straight and narrow trayertory leading
the excited napalm projectile into the
tender land, and producing the suddenly
cllmzixmg flash of almost unbearable
brilliant orange name that gradually
subsides lnlo smoke-hazed rest.

You see. before his legal (holy) map
riage, every man naturally has desires
that he must fulfill. It is far healthier {or
the boys to have a little fun impregr
hating some faraway Asian whoreland.
than to be tempted into peacetime mas-
turbation zit home. In fact, this union is
all the more condoned as it will give
birth and mongrel children of freedom,
justice, appre pie, and equality tor all
except those racially—diseased with pri-
mitive trihal rhythmic perversions.

But what is to be the result at all this.
What is the world to do with this over—
sexed teenage America? There can no
no doubt dial such a vital problem must
be dealt with radically. We must attack
the very root of the disorder. There IS
no alternative, our only answer is cas»
tration.

To the Editor:

i must admit that Miss Raab's point
ls well taken That the admlnistration.
o_ hiring outsiders, is “trying to sup-
pie student spontaneity" is patently
clear. Let no one listen to those oi the
ilk oi the University of Pennsylvania's
student newspaper, Punchbowl. whose
banner proclaims that “Any damn tool
can be spontaneous.”

By her reasoning, we must agree thnt
such productions as Tartutte, Rigoletto,
and especially the San Francisco Mime
Troupe were administration . or studcnh
controlled acts or suppression oi our
spontaneity

Further by this reasoning, the lust acts
in a campaign to give the “students or
the periorming arts more than a token
acknowledgement," in a campaign tn
“give the one-acts la the pros and let the
students use the resortsces set up for
shalt use," must he to cancel Duke EI-

Proiest Condemned

Prolessor Milner’s article in last
week's 5&3 dealt with the recent demon<
stration by some thnnell students pro-
testing the appearance on campus or a
representative troin Playboy magazine.
Mt. Brice Draper, the Playboy represen-
tative, had been invited to the campus by
a resident advtser acting [or what is
left of the student Sex Education Come
nuttee as a part or its continuing pine
gram or sex education. The protesters
were, then, demonstrating against part
of an educational program initiated and
directed by fellow Students.

The protest took the tollowing form:
some nine or ten students marched in“)
one or the hall lounges, where other
students had gathered to hear Mt. pia-
pcr's presentation and to ask him ques-
tions; then interrupted the orderly and
legal proceedings by singing a song, to
the accompaniment ot a guitar; then

several 01 them molt of! their clothes.’

After this action, they joined the other
students in questioning the speaker.

Professor Mlllier's article centers on
the dismhlng as the central feature at
the demonstration; and e to judge tram
the accounts in newspapers — this tea-
ture is the one which has most caught
public attention. I should like to pmnt
out that the nudity was only one purl of
ii larger action, and it is that action
which ought to be considered beiore pass-
ing yudgnient. But iust as the action did
not consist merely of drsrobing, neither
can it be Classified merely as a demoli-
stration. Protesting demonstrations can
take many iornis, and it is the partlcu<
lzir form of this demonstration that
needs comment.

The action oi the demonstrators was
the interruption cl proceedings which are
at me essence of an educational insti-
tution: the presentalion of ideas and the
suhiection oi those ideas to scrutiny Any
interruption of such proceedings is a
denial oi the idea of liberal education,
and it is this charge that ought to he
leveled against the demonstrators. Even
if they had not taken [hair clothes off,
they would have been guilty; the nudity
was only an extreme torm at their
antirintellectualism.

That so-called “Playboy philosophy" is
unworthy oi rational attention 15 almost
seltevident; still, every dog deserves
his day, even it Lhe dog he a bitch. The
action of the demonstrators was identi-
cal to that oi reactionary thinkers in pre-
vtous generations, who thought that Com»
muliist speakers should he kept trom the
campus. The colleges and universities of
the when led a long hard fight to Win the
principle or the “open campus" 7 and
yet, just when they have nearly won that
tight, they are being attacked by the
very people for whom they waged the
right: the students.

Far too much time has been spent de-
bating either the motives oi the demon-
strators at the consequences of their ac-
tion. Neither is relevant. bet us grant
that their motives were good — dubious
as this concession may be; let us grant
that the consequences Will be good ——
though we can never ascertain this point;
the action itseli was had.
