§AYS ATTITUDES NEED TIME
CRAWFORD ON THE PROBLEM

By ZELTE CRAWFORD
(Sociology)

Recent developments between
the Grinnell Community and the
Grinnell Negro have brought
to the surface on issue that has
existed for some time, That
issue is the apparent tension
that has been building up be.
tween the two factions for -
number of years,

Most people on Gﬂnncll’s cam-
pus will probably agree that
something should be done to
change this situation, Present-
ly, however, the disagreement

 

 

ZELTE CRAWFORD

rests on the subject of what
change should be initiated, and
who Should inltiate it,

Some circles propose that the
Negro work more or less inde«
pendently in searching for the
method he thinks most expedi-
Grit.

Other circles have encouraged
the college administration to up
ply its own authority to assure
Negro students the rights that
are rightfully theirs as Grinnell
students and as American Citi<
zens.

Still another group proposes
that the white students must
act — with the administration
and the Negro, or without them.

After these approaches have

been exhausted — and it appear:
that this is the present predict-
ament on campus —- the problem
seems icr all practical purposes
to Still exist. Negro students still
avoid traveling downtown dur-
ing the evening, and avoid cer-
tain establishments because of
the threat of verbal and physi-
cal abuses; these abuses are
very real, as the past has prov-
en.

Although for the most part the
enthusiasm for action has some-
what faded, a few studenw and
taculiy members are still work
ing. through meetings between
Negroes and town people, for a
better understanding between
the two groups.

And yet, while these meetings
are taking place, Negroes are
Still afraid to venture down-
town during the night, and the
hostility that many of the citi-
zens of the town have shown

with increased intensity.

Action to change the present
situation Should have taken
place long ago — before it
reached this point. It is some-
what ludicrous to try to place
the blame on any single group
[or inaction and apathy because
it is apparent that the entire
Grinnell College population has
been guilty of the lethargy that
has allowed Negroes to suffer
undue humiliation.

Negro students themselves
have ignored numerous occa-
sions of unpleasant encounters
in the town of Grinnell, and have
Withdrawn tn the microcosm
that the campus prowdes. They
have failed to act for them
selves in many of these cases,
and have discouraged others
from acting ior them.

In other instances the Negro
students have responded by re-
porting incidents to college
authorities and city officials, but
no action resulted.

White students have generally

pleaded ignorance of the situa-
tion, and have attributed their
ignorance to the inability of
Negio students to communicate
their various problems.

The validity oi this piea might
be compared to the ostrich-head
in the hole analogy. That such
a large number of white stu<
dents profess to have “Negro
iriends", but do not possess the
sensitivity or empathy to realize
the dilemma of their ”Negro
colleagues," lends doubt to the
sincerity of their concept of
iriendship.

Yet, many of these students
who have so vehemently con-
demned Negroes for their lack
of action have experienced many
similar unpleasautries in the
town or Grinnell, and have re«
acted in a Similar manner.

Also, the question that inevit<
ably comes to mind is whether
or not the white student should
act when it is necessary, with
out the consent of the Negro
students on campus. Does the
Negro dictate the consciences
of white students?

Both of the groups already
mentioned conveniently point an
accusing finger at the college
administration. At most. in
action has been sloveti until
recently, and even now the et-
iectlveness of its action is queSe
tionable. The College adminis-
tration's responsibility to its
students becomes a salient issue
when examining the Negro stu-
dent’s plight in Grinnell.

That Negro students have
been experiencing discord ior
decades, while attending college
in Grinnell, has been confirmed
by numerous black alumni. Tlils

TVS SHUFFLED

In spite at a c or HP meet-
ing which was held Sunday
night, the question of what will
become of North Campus tele»
visions in the iace ni integrat-
ed campuses remains unan-
swered.

In an effort to unite North
Campus, Ron Cogswell asked
each of the hall presidents to
talk the matter over with indi-
vidual hall members. He indi-
cated that he favors the idea of
all halls keeping their TV'ii
Within the men’s residence hall
system, and all but one at the
North presidents backed him
with a resolution of similar
opinion.

Most halls don't want to com-
mit themselves definitely—it's
easier to wait and See what
everybody else does — but a
tentative headcount shows six
halls (Smith, Cowles, Gates,
East and West Norris, and
Langan) in favor of retaining
their tubes, one hall (Clark) in
iavbring or selling theirs, and
four halls (Rawson, Dibble, and
North and South Younlier) still
undecided.

The fact remains that the
only way men will be guaran-
teed television in their halls
next year is by keeping them
in the men’s hall system. Ono
thing is certain m the College
won’t provide them.

THE RIGHT

BY
win. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

I have a communication here born the Saturday Evening Post,
requesting that r publicize a current issue in which is featured a
story on Senator Thomas Dodd by his former ndminstrativo
asSistant Mr. James Boyd, which under the circumstances I
gladly do.

Here is an article, the beginning of a projected series the aim
01 which is to establish that Senator Dodd is a thief, a crook, l
hypocrite, and a thoroughly obnoxious human being. These ver.
dicts are reached by techniques which are interesting to any stu-
dent oi polemics, not to say slander, You read about young, ideal-
istic, clean-living, peopleloving, pure-minded James Boyd, who
in 1958 was attracted to Thomas Dodd. W y? Because Mr. Dodd

was, in those days, also idealistic, clean ng, people-loving and
pureminded. '

But, then alter a while, James Boyd discovers that the senator
really isn’t any longer all those things. He discovers that the sena-
tor really is using money that was intended Io finance his political
campaigns for personal expenses. He discovers that the senator is
derelict In his performance of his official duties. He discovers that
the senator accepts fees for his speeches and his articles. and the
free use of private cars, airplanes, apartments, whatever.

To expose the reliance on hall-truths and distortions of tho
factual thrusts of Mr. Boyd's allegations~which by the way are
apparently received by the editors or the Post as positively scrip.
tural in authority (incredibly, the editors did not check I slngll
allegation with Senator Dodd, not one)«is a halt-morning's work.

An example of a iactual charge brought by Mr, Boyd is “the
ornate Dodd silverware“ which “had been replated gratis by a
silver company at whose behest Dodd had urged changes in the
Treasury Department's silver policy," a charge that caught my
eye because when it was first levelled a year ago i took the trouble
to telephone said silver merchant only to tind that the repiating
cost was 315, and that Senator Dodd had insisted on paying for it,

That kind of thing hurts, oi cmtrse, hurts in the eyes of those
who have not had access to, or have not remembered, the facts.
out what is finally damaging is the subjective portrait or Senator
Dodd, concerning which no factual refutations are readily pro-
ducible. Mr. Boyd says that between the first time that he met
Mr. Dodd and the time that he decided to run to Drew Pearson
with his revelations, Senator Dodd had changed. That he had
grown arrogant. That he had grown callous. Supercilious. Lazy. Ir-
responsible. l . .

Now how does one go about dealing with such judgments? It
occurs only to the unusual reader to ask himself whether it is pos-
sible that during that same period it wasn’t the senator who
changed, so much as the author. During that same period the
author, a) effected a dalliance with a lady of loose morals, whom
he put on the senator's payroll; b) became estranged from his
wife and four children, c) subsequently took up with yet another
lady, the secretary of Senator Dodd to whom he is now married:
and d) discovered that Drew Pearson is the tons et orlgo of Ameri-
can morals.

Now there is an anti-Pilgrim’s Progress for you —- Meanwhile,
from the point of view of humble residents of the United States,
as also from the point of View of energetic members of the anti-
Communist community, Senator Dodd was appraised as the man
responsible for the most sustained, exhaustive, thoughtful series of
foreign policy speeches, reports, investigations, being delivered
anywhere to say nothing of a lively record on domestic matters,
His output was equal to that of three typical senators,

Who changed? Boyd or Dodd? YES, Dodd WIS censured - on
ii technicality which most knowing people admit a majority or us.
senators would be censured for it they had been so unfortunate as
to employ James Boyd as confidential assistant. And at course, the
continued persecution by Boyd et oi oi Dodd is saleable to a na-
tlonnl magazine, in the sense that the reverse would not be, It
Senator Dodd had arrived at the editorial ofﬁce of the Saturday
Evening PDSt accompanied by the Archangel or the Divine nee.
ords, which records absolutely established that Boyd was a liar,
a phimey, a cheat —— that august journal would likely not have
bought the story. Because Boyd, though now a public figure, is un-
important; whereas Dodd is important.

By the same token, Dodd cannot, as a practical matter, sue,
because the Supreme Court has Said (Sullivan vs. the New York
Times) that public officials cannot sue barring a demonstration or
“actual malice" which — —uliless the archangel is subpoenable —
is seldom provabler

And in any case, such suits cost more to bring than Mr. Dodd
has got. That is die iinni ilony, considering that Mr. Boyd's
charges is that Mr. Dodd got rich at public expense. Mr. Dodd
isn't even rich enough to sue the pans oft Boyd, which leaves Mr.
Boyd in the unaccustomed position of keeping his pants on.
