Scarlet Fever ‘

by Jim Herzog
(Sports Co-cditor) l

Today and tomorrow the Pioneers make their tradiel
tional journey to the Drake Relays in Des Moines. Therel
haven’t always been 2000 athletes competing at the Drake ,‘
Relays, as there will be this year 11 fact at the conceptionl
of what is now a major sports affair 53 years ago only 85
athletes made their way through an Iowa blizzard to come
pete.

But during the 53 years that followed, the Drake Re-
lays became a major sports affair, pulling in the greatest
athletes in the country. It was at the relays that Jesse
Owens set the American record for the broad jump with
a jump of 26-1 3/4. It was there that Owens ran :09?) in
the 100 to equal the existing world‘s record. l

Past competitors in the Relays include Charley Hoff,»
who at the Relays in 1926 set the American record in the
pole vault; Charley Paddock, a great sprinter in the 20’s;
HarrisoniDillard, sprinter and hurdler; Bobby Morrow, an
Olympic hero; Wes Santee and Glenn Cunningham, great
milers; and Mal Whitfield, a great quarter and half miler.

Two Glinllellians should be included in the list of
track stars of the past One is Chuck Hoyt, a fabled
sprint champion before 1920; and the otller is Morgan
Taylor, a hurdler in the 20’s, who still holds the Grinnell
hurdle records.

Perhaps the fact that only those two Grinnellians can
be mentioned as “all-time greats” is because they were the
product of competition provided when Grinnell was a memel
ber of the Missouri Valley Conference.

In those days, the Pioneers faced such schools as
Oklahoma A&M, Drake, Creighton, Washington University
(St. Louis) and Butler,

Recognizing the effect stiff competition had on Grin-
nell track then, Coach Dick Young has attempted to sched-i
ule his current crop of cindermen against such large schools
as Iowa State University (Ames) and State College of Iowa
(Cedar Falls).

Instead of remainingfwithin the relative security of
the league, where he could use Grinnell’s present strength
to produce an undefeated season, Young has scheduled the(
team “over its head" on several occasions to provide his'
men with the best possible tests of their skill.

All this he has done at the expense of a. perfect
season — often the public’s only measure of a coach’s

success.

showing much improvement in the past week. Patterson,
