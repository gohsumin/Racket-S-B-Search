Dean of the College Joseph
Wall, whose new book on An-
drew Carnegie is winning ex*
cellent reviews throughout the
country, has been accorded a
major honor in recognition of
his achievements in the field
of American history.

Dean Wall, Parker Frofesr
sor of History here, was in-
ducted into the highly select
Society of American Histort
ians on November 5 in New
York.

Membership in the Society,
now standing at about 200, is
by invitation only and is lim-
ited to authors whosewritings
in American historyhaveachr
ieved literary distinction. An
earlier book by Dean Wall --
“Henry Watterson: Reconst-
ructed Rebel" *- was, like the
Carnegie work, cited for ex
cellence in historical writing.

Founded in 1939 by prizes
winning historian Allan Neva
ins, the Society initiated Am-
erimn Heritage, highrquality
historical magazine, in coop-
eration with the American Ass
sociation for State and Local
History. Excerpts from Dean
Wall’s book on Carnegie ape

Some indication of the probe

ance of language courses has
been given this year, as, in
anticipation of the abolition,
enrollment fell approximate-
ly 25% in French and 12% in
Spanish. Russian was the only
language to increase its en-

all we can do now is grow.
If all that happens now is the
shrinkage of some unpopular
departments and the corres—

abolition of requirements will
have failed its potential. The
fulfillment of that potential
should maintain the Big Show

this year. And Idon’tthlnkl’m
particularly prejuduccd; last
year I was the Concerts Ch-
airman.

Maybe people like J.C. Labo-
witz should start going tomore
events and basing their Crilit
cisms on the levelofthe music
rather than on the prestige of
the performers’ names. I’ve
known J.C. since my freshman
year, when he lived next door
to Gary Giddins, then Social
Coordinator, ‘and spent a good
deal of time complainingabout
the social program. Perhaps
he's justa chroniccomplain-
er. At any rate, I wish he'd
talk to me personally, or to

anyone on my committee,
about the social program. But
then maybe J.C.'s primary
concern is to show the world
how clever he is at turning a
phrase. It's hard to tell.

As Social Coordinator, let
me say once more, Iwelcome
any and all criticisms and
suggestions with open arms.
In the future I hope they will
be constructive and based on
facts. Ialso hope tohear them
spoken to my face, and not

have them slung at me from'

the pages of the 5&8 - no

matter how facile and witty

the prose.

Yours in the spirit of good,

clean, healthy entertainment,

Restrictive life

At Grinnell

(continued from page 5)

So the question is this: is it
more important for something
to survive than to have value
for the people involved with
it? (or, in other words, is the
primary purpose of Grinnell
College to stay alive or to
give its students something
worthwhile, even ifthis means
going out of business or dras-
tically changing its way of
life?).

The current situation is not
going to change until students
realize they are responsible
to each other and together can
make the Grinnell gamea bet
ter one. Grinnell mnnot con
tinue to separate the mindand
body or the intellectual and .
social by relying on its budget.
0f major concern to students
is Saga. If 150- 200 ofus simply
withheld money for Saga in our
second semester checks, the
school would be forced to ab-
sorb the loss and change. The
same goes for B&G and the
library shaft.

Students who believe in inte-
grating living and learningare
going to have to havean option
by which they can attain any
d e sir e d responsibilities.
Let’s learn from each other
and give Grinnell back to its
real trustees; the students.
