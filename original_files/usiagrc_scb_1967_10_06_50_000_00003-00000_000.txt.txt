SCARLET AND BLACK

PHILOSOPHERS. NOT PARTISANS.
or MAKE MORE THAN LOVE

“It is now time for the stu-
dent body to stop having to de-
fend their point of view, and
have the administration start
delending theirs." Besides be-
ing to a large extent trite, this
statement is also indicative of
a general change of emphasis
in methods of creating change.
This opinion, voiced by many
dissident students. is held also
by many thinkers not ‘under
thirty.‘ ln a recent article in
the Humanist, Leslie Fiedler
said, “Maybe it is not the
young today who need defend
ing, but the old.”

This attitude is most clearly
demonstrated in the contro-
Versy on campus concerning
'rule philosophy,’ but it is also
relevant in a subtler area of
concern: creativity. There are
many ideas about creativity,
what it means, What its causes
are, what its aim is; Robinson
Jeffers said, “Values or Cre-
ativity come only out of vio-

lance"; a iriend of mine wrote
to me this summer, “Creativ-
ity comes only out of disturbing
tensions"; and there is the old
saw. “Democracy is built on

the clash or opposing views.”

Now Grinnell is obviously not
a democracy, either with a big
or little ‘d'. But it can be one
if only in the sense that it is
the place for the ‘clashing or
opposing views.’ for the ‘crea-
tion of disturbing tensions,’ and
for 'violent creativity.’ What is
this thing. ‘education’, anyway?
It should be. at least to my
mind, the process of teaching
or in some cases forcing a per-
son to be creative.

How many students are will-
ing to question the relevance of
the educational process, or the
meaning of grades, or of the
certain courses at Grillllell, to
ask whether or not course nin-
terial is worth reading in some
cases, to say ‘I have a belief

and I challenge anyone to prove
that I’m wrong?’ Perhaps the
problem is not so much the lack
ot communication as Mr, Ru-
dolph suggests, but, looking into
the causes, the unwillingness to
communicate; most students
around here are so dispassion-
ate that they become illnnels
tor the history or art, the his-
tory of philosophy, the history
of history, but rarely artists,
philosophers, or h i s t o r t a n s
themselves. Seemingly, nobody
wants to know ‘why' anymore.
Isn't it, then, possible to cre—
ate some disturbing tenslon
somewhere along the line? I
think that it Is, and since the
greater number of the senior
scholars at Grinnell are either
willing or unable to do it, it is
up to the students themselves.
It is necessary to remember
that the opposition or actions is
generally called war, the oppo-
sitioll or ideas, creativity.

 

A SANGUINE TRIBUTE TO COLLEGE MEDICINE

 

T0 iiEhii'ii hi

By DON WINNEY

One of the least appreciated
institutions at a college is usue
ally its medical help. I mean
we usually think such profes-
sional care is one of our un-
a n u m e r ate d constitutional
rights. But no, as the AMA
president: so cogently stated,
such fine college care is a
privilege, yes even a providen-
tIal blessing. Why I know a
friend who just raved about the
medical care he got at the
smallest liberal arls college
west at the South Carolina tide-
water,

One day, at a rather low ebb
i believe, this young scholar
stumbled somewhat dazed into
the office of the good Doctor,
one or the college town's proud
practitioners — a kind of pa<
ternal Peyton Place iigure high-
ly recommended by the nice
nurse of the college health can
(er,

“Excuse me,“ said the stu-
dent, “Please excuse me, I
hope you don't mind, bllt while
playing badminton I inadverte
ently slipped on the birdie and
somewhat foolishly I'm airaid
cracked my head. Perhaps an
aspirin . . ."

"Why you poor dear!” cried
the nurse, rushing to him,
“Yes, of course, but first. fill
out this eight page insurance
form in triplicate.”

The student searched for his
pen while in his right hand he
gently cradled his head. Just
then, the good Doctor happily
emerged from his ofﬁce.

“0h, Doctor," Cried the
nurse. rushing to him, “A head
injury, Doctor. It looks just aw-
ful.” ‘

“Very nice," murmured the
Doctor, gently lingering the
hair.

“No. Doctor,” 5 a i d the

nurse, disengaging herself. “His
head.”

”What?" He glanced down at
the student with a benign, al-
most paternal expression, then
drew the nurse close and WhlS<
pered, ”Is the kid insured?"
The nurse nodded.

”Hmmmm,” mused the Doc~
tor, “Perhaps an aspirin. .

The nurse hurriedly fetched
it. “Thank you.” said the doc-
tor, gulping it. “And now, kid,
just fill out that insurance
farm.”

“But sir." protested the stu«
dent, somewhat diilidently,
"Excuse me, but I just can't
seem to think or read or to-
member anything."

“You must have a test to-
morrow," suggested the good
man, “Perhaps you need a psy-
chlatrist."

“N0.” said the student, “It's
just that my head hurts." He
shyly wiped his wet hand on
his trousers. “Excuse me for
staining your rug like that.”

“Quite all right,“ replied the
Doctor, “Just check the box on
page three marked ‘Oiiice
Dumages‘." He slipped a com-
forting arm around the nurse.
“And try not to track it
around.” he said.

The student started illling out
the form. but suddenly his arm
and neck began shaking.

“You see, Doctor." explained
the student. "You see I have
these — like seizures.”

The nurse suddenly began
fainting. “Now, now." soothed
the Doctor, cradling the nurse,
gently, "You shouldn't shock
the. poor dear like that. That's
not a very nice word, now is
it?"

The student, rather ungra-
clously, he later admitted, be-
gan writhing on the floor.

“You do have a student union,
don't you?" asked the Doctor,
“where the kids dance?"

The student nodded several
times while clawing the carpet.

“Well," said the Doctor.
“Just wander over. You'll (it
right in." With professional
skill the good man felt for the
nurse’s heart. “And please
come back soon,” he begged.
He ielt tor it again. “That’li
he just eight bucks, but don’t
worry,” he assured him, “your
insurance covers everything.
Otherwise I would've charged
you cash.”

The student was greatly
thankful for that, for in his hur-
ry he had iorgolten his wallet.
He grateiully twitched his way
out the door while the good
man thoughttully comiorted his
nurse. “Excuse me." begged
the doctor, “let me feel it
again,”

A STUDENT OPINION

TRY it} UNDERSTAND

By SAMMIE FLETCHER and KAREN FRANK

This past Monday we heard a recording of a speech made by
Malcolm X in Detroit in 1963, We suddenly realized that the stark
world of reality was passing us by. because we had been apathetic
in the true Grinnell spirit. We had built our own little dream world,
truly insulated from the problems of the outside. We knew that
things outside were bad, but we had been sheltered by the so-
called liberal atmosphere here.

Malcolm x has been represented, untortunately, as a preacher
of racial hatred — his ideology compared to that of the Nazis. Only
selected parts of his speeches had been revealed to the general
public e parts which led to rejection oi his views by many people.

In this speech, we found nothing with which we could argue.
He saw revolution from a historical point of View citing as exam-
ples, the Russian, American. and Chinese revolutions. II was, to
him, evident that a true revolution demanded bloodshed, demanded
hatred of one's enemy, and demanded an uncompromising aspira-
tion toward a goal. This is contrary to Negro leaders who preach
non-violence, but in complete accord with the new milltants such
as Stokely Carmichael.

Malcolln X and Carmichael have the same View toward turn-
ing the other cheek. For years the white man has expected the
Negro to be patient and grateiul for the little concessions that he
made. The white man could tight lor his rights — the Negro had
to Wait passively. Now, the white man is alarmed because more
and more Negroes are not waiting passively. Every white man is
born with his rights, but Negroes have to prove that they are
worthy of them. And the white establishment determines worth.

Malcolm X also pointed to the large number of Negroes who
right in American wars. Is it iair ior them to fight tor a nation
that deprives them of their citizenship and returns them to in
homeland where their churches are bllrned, their brothers are
lynched and they are met with scorn?

We believe that the civil rights movement is dying because
many of Malcolm X’s pmcepts weren't iollowed. He realized that
black men had to unite, that they had to divorce themselves from
the white power and money structure, that they had to develop
racial pride, and that their leaders had to receive their support
from the people, not the establishment.

Gradually, the black power movement is replacing the non-
violent civil rights movement. Civil rights legislation is merely on
the books, Congress laughed the rat control bill off the floor, but
found riot-control legislation more appealing. More people are
iinding an answer in black power and violence, because the situ-
ation has not changed. A black revolution is believed to be inev-
itable — there will be no Sitting back cumplacently for another
hundred years.

But where do we go from here? There seems to be no hope in
further legislation, no hope at the conference table, and no hope
(or understanding, Suddenly each individual is forced to make a
choice —— black or white, 3 choice which has been determined at
birth. There is no place for one DI us, a black moderate. Does she
turn her back on her people and be labeled an Uncle Tom, or does
she become a militant young Negro torgetting her white triendsi|
And can the other feasibly remain a white liberal in a black revtr
lution that sees all Whites the same Way, or will she be Content to
defend her home in suburbia?

Now is almost too late, but we aren't ready to give up. If
everyone would care enough to try to understand the problem, we
believe there would still be hope (or reaching a solution.
