luegrass Singer ilere Saturday Night

By Ron Stanford

Direct from the Grand Ole
Opry of Nashville, Ell] Monv
too and the Bluegrass Boys
will be in Grinnell’s South
Lounge tomorrow night at 9
pin. Monroe, who has been a
top attraction in the Grand
Ole opry since 1939. is widely
recognized as the originator
of bluegrass music.

Throughout the twenties and
thirties the music which later
cyclverl into bluegrass was
known as “string band mus
sic,” usually played with a
guitar, fiddle, ‘and banjo.
Monrcc started playing pro-
tcssionally in the early 1930’s
with his brothers Charley and
Birch. In 1938, he split with
his brother Charley and form-
ed the now famous Bluegrass
Boys

Monroe developed a com-
pletely new style oi music that
incorporated the traditional
music oi the string band and
a more driving sound, the
lead being taken by the iiddle,
banjo, and mandolin. The
mandolin is Monroe‘s instru»
ment. By the early 1940’s the
world of country music had
adopted the term bluegrass
music from the name at Mon
roe’s group.

Bill Monroe's band has been
considered the training ground

ior many a country music
star. Perhaps the most famous
musicians who performed with
Monroe were Lester Flatt and
Earl Scruggs. it was during
his stay with the Bluegrass
Boys that Earl Scruggs de-
Veloped his unique style of
banjo finger-picking. Other
notables who have performed
with Monroe include Don
Reno, Mack Wiseman, Bill
Keith, and Del McCourry.

Monroe has been one at the
most influential forces in conn-
tiy music. When the imporr
tance of string band music be
gan to wane as electrified
country music gained pupils
larity, Monroe gave a new life
to unamplliied string band
music.

Monroe has remained true to
his musical principles through
out his career and has con
tributed an incredible number
oi musical compositions.
Among his best known works
are “Footprints in the Snow,“
“1 Hear 3 Sweet Voice Callv
inst" "Uncle Pen,” “Roar
noke," and the “Blue Moon at
Kentucky.”

Monroe, born in Rosene,
Kentucky, attributes the ideas
for his music to many sources.
The song “Uncle Pen,” for ex-
ample, was written in mem-
cry or his fiddlerplaying uncle
who ﬁrst taught him the tra-

dltional mountain iiddlc tunes.
Monroe also learned much
from Arnold Schultz, a black
guitarist who played at dances
in the Rosene area.

The importance of Monroe’s
music has been recognized by
many. This summer both the
State of Kentucky and the
Smithsonian institution honor-
ed Monroe for his contribution
to American music.
