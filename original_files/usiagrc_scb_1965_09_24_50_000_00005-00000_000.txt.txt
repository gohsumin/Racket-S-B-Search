The Grudge Poi

By DOUG MCCORMAC

Fun, fun, fun! We’ve all had
it, haven't we? Summer was
great. Europe was great. New
York was great. lowa waseox.

I had a miserable summer, of
course So what? Did you have
such a hot time? Get off it, you

, were miserable, too. If you had
fun, at least you felt guilty about
it.

Only one exciting thing hap
pened in my quiet town all sum-
mer. One night, my mother snuck

into the kitchen and snatched two
pretzels.

"You’ll never lose any weight
that way," I warned her later.

She grimuced. “Who asked you?
Why don’t you go down in the
basement and let your clothes
rot.“ She often sniveled like this
when in the wrong, and I knew
that I must treat her more gently.

"Dr. Milliwed says you're is int
ugly slob," I tried.

“Who asked him?" she sniveled.

“You did," I returtedl "You
asked him why you were over-
weight, and he said it was because
you are a fat ugly slob. That pret»
zel won’t improve Dr. Milliwed's
opinion of you, either.”

Actually, I didn’t give a damn
about Drl Milliwed‘s opinion, since
he had been dead for five years.
His dying words were, “She's a lat
ugly slab," and they probably did
not even refer to Mumsie.

But for private recondite rea-
sons that would only interest a
pedant, I wanted to demonstrate
the true reasoning about the mat-
ter to my mother. The reason I
wanted to show up my mother was

 

that she had taken the last pret-
zels.

“They always say, ‘as thin as
a pretzel,’ " she ﬁnally said, smug-
1y.

“who are they?" I screamed
with wild irony. “Why are they
always creeping into our converr
stations? Shall the world never be
rid of this foul conflagration?"

“If we don't keep on eating our
pretzels. it won't," Mumsie said
as she exited. Now I could see
that she was extremely under-
weight. "A pretzel a day keeps
the foul conilagrations away."

“A inul conflagration on your
foul conflagrationsi" I elocu—
tioned. “Never eat a pretzeil” l
universalized with momentous stu-
pendity. "Shove it all," I sniveled
in despair.

It did not matter, for my moth-
er could no longer hear me. She
was in the basement eating pret-
zels while her clothes rotted,

Excitement and fun, as you can
see, have as many faces as a
woman. They need not be glit-
tery and expensive. Often. riot
and dehaunchery, when stripped
of their coarser outer rags, are
naked. Sometimes they are not.

Everything ultimately depends
upon a cheerful, pleasant, opti-
mistic attitude]

year’s fall semester is up nearly

b Encampment

(Continued tram Page 1)

agreed that: a liberal education in-
cluded obtaining sume knowledge
of the practical. To aid this aim oi
education, the group suggested
that more men of affairs be invited
to speak on campus.

This committee also recom-
mended strengthening the rule of
interdisciplinary clubs on campus.

The group discussing the Grin—
nell social situation suggested that
the college attempt to foster closer
college-town relations.

The group given the responsibil-
ity of talking about the college and
its students decided that a more
exciting series of convocations
might help the spirit of commu-
nity that may be ebbing on the
Grinnell campus.

In an effort to bring the ideas
of the encampment back to the
campus, the encampment commit-
tee is planning remeetlngs oi the
original discussion groups later in
the year. Other plans along this
line include distribution and pub«
lication of the final committee re-
ports and coiiehaurs with encamp-
ment participants and interested
students.
