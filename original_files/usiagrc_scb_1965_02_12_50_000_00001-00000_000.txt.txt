Knopf Discusses Elimination of Interim,
Cites Need for More Independent Study

By Alan Axelrod

"The faculty generally
agreed that the interim wasn’t
doing the job and that we need
to get at other ways of inde-
pendent study," said Kenyon
Knopt (economics), chairman

' of the faculty, when asked
about the faculty decision to
’ discontinue the interim session.

Knopf observed that “the stu»
dents' educational process has
been developed in terms of
formal structure—credits, as-
signments and grades. To slip
that little bit of time in and
expect very much in the way
of independent study is unreal<
istic."

He felt that a college needs
to build gradually into its stu-
dents the ability and desire to
pursue knowledge for its own
sake. ”I think we can do a lot
more in the way of encourag<
ing students to undertake inde<

 

pendent study, but there are
no formulas to get the job
done,"

Knopf pointed out that there
is much more work outside of
class now than there was ten
years ago. He felt. however,
that students need to be en-
couraged to broaden mem-
selves by doing reading out:
side of their major areas.

“One test of a good college
education would be to inter-
view people 15 years after they
graduate and see if they have
done much reading outside of
their professions To develop
the kind of desire needed for
this sort of reading is, of course,
one of the fundamental pur-
poses of a liberal arts educa-
tion," he said.

Knopf recalled that the in-
terim program and the incep-
lion 0f the Junior Liberal Arts

The panel of tour faculty mem-

member saw varying weaknesseu
in the college makeup

Moderated by Reginald Archam-
bault (education), the panel sought
to explore his assumption, ”What
we have is very good; how do we
make it excellent?”

Cleaver opened the discussion by
pointing to the distinction between
saying, “that unless we experience
knowledge in more than a cerebral
sense, it is not very good knowl-
edge."

He said, “The passion at Grin-
nell for learning is at somewhat
less than a screaming pitch.”

Cleaver advised more seminar
work and more involved participa-
tion in place of detached apprecia-
tion, particularly in the fine arts.

Agreeing with Cleaver, Fletcher
blamed the lack of depth in leam-
ing on the racetrack aspect of the
curriculum. He said students and
professors alike are hurried and
regimented.

“The atmosphere is one of great
pressure, and this situation is gen-
eraily unsatisfactory," said Fletch-
er.

The solution, he said, was in I
program not unlike that in opera-
tion at Swarthmore Where the num-
ber of courses during the last two
years of study is reduced from
four to two.

Fletcher Said these classes of not
more than ten would meet as l
seminar perhaps only once a week.
with much of the initiative com-
ing from the students themselves.

Many oi the present mid-term
and final examinations would b0
eliminated under this system, ad-
ded Fletcherl He also observed
that such a system would “assum'
considerable maturity on the part
of the student.”

Fletcher noted that he was cau<
tiously optimistic about this ma-
turity despite the mass exodus
from campus during the interim
period

Archambault characterized and,

divided college life into day-time
and night-time activity. He said
that during the day the student
crosses into central campus and
becomes a student, but when he re-
turns at night he changes into a

Power Failure in East, West Norris;
Norris Men Left Wandering in Dark

The 102 men of East and
West Norris halils awakened
Tuesday morning to dark halls,
gasoline fumes. smoke that
filled both lounges, and water-
less taps and fountains that
made early morning shaving
and washing a near impossibil-
ity.

The general power failure was
caused by a broken water main,
split as a result of contraction
and expansion from widely
varying Iowa temperatures. Its
water flooded a utility room
in the basement of the five
year old building, and pro-
duced a small explosion when
the water level reached the
electrical transformer. located
in the storage room. Gasoline
pumps, placed on a lot behind
the halls, were used to draw
the water from the flooded
basement and created a nox-
ious gas and fumes which perv

 

meated the
both dorms.

The power, which went off at
4:25 a.m., was not resupplied
until about 10:45 a.m, and run:
ning water was not returned to
the halls until nearly 3:00 pm.
