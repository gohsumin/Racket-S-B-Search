C. A. Harrell Calls for Effective City Government
To Meet Social, Economic Problems of New Age

By Glen Ashmon

Professor Gilmour called him
the “dean of city managers."
Professor Bradley called him
a “giant in the field of public
administration."

But he began his lecture Mon-
day night in the South Lounge
by “cutting himself down to
size.”

C. A. Harrell declared “The
Role of Government in the
New Age” involved a three‘
fold responsibility by local gov-

effective implementation of pol-

and democratic e x a m p l e
formed the three elements with
which local government must
be concerned now and in the
future.

Efficient city government, in
Harrell‘s opinion, centers
around housekeeping services
(Le, structural organization).
Effective city government em-
phasizes the social and eco-
nomic problems with which 10-
cal government is confronted,
Harrell held this effective gov-
ernment to be a workable al-
ternative

Foremost among the prob-
lems effective city government
must encounter is financial
planning. “Local government,”
Harrell claimed, “is big busi-
ness.” and he Cited the 314.5

cal units in thls country. These
expenditures, he pointed out,
ran $1 billion above income.
One of the reasons for this dai»
icit, according to Harrell, is
the fact that 45% of the tax dol-
lar is expended on projects
which return only 6% of the
tax. Included in such projects
are urban renewal and local
welfare programs.

Who finances these services?
Will this source of income con-
Linue to support an expanding

A. Harrell delivers his Sua-

local economy? is it fair to ex-
peCt this source of income to
continue to carry the weight of
th e local economy? These
were the questions which Har-
rell tried to answer and which
local government will encoun-
ter more and more.

The answer to the first ques—
tion is simple enough: it is the
property owner. Harrell does
not believe, however, that
property taxes can meet the
cost of these expanding serv-
ices nor does he believe they
ought to. He argued that local
services affect people, not
property. He feels, therefore,
that the tax burden should be
shifted from property to people,
i.e. to services extended to
people. This, he maintained,
can be done through sales
taxes and charges on servicesl
where such charges can be ap-

 

plied equally to all residents.
As examples, he referred to
charges applied to the water
system, g a r b a g e collection,
and, in some cases, recreation.

Federal and is a necessary
though reluctant means oi fi-
nancing expanding services as
Harrell pointed out. Harrell
further noted that increased
services to business areas and
downtown rejuvenation will not
only reverse the downward
trend of income from those
areas, but is necessary for a
city’s own protection.

Another problem area with
which Harrell said local gov-
ernment must contend is social.
Included are such problem
areas as urban renewal, educa<
tion. and the mass transporlar
tion problem. Harrell main-
tained that the mass transpor-
tation problem is not being met
and will grow increasingly
acute. A partial answer he feels
is subsidation of expressways,
mass transportation systems,
and parking areas by local
government.

Concluding his lecture, Har-
rell emphasized the need of lo»
cal government to get its citi-
zens interested in their governe
ment and concerned With its
welfare. According to Harrell,
the local governmental system
is the foundation of democracy.
He reiterated the long-standing
concept that if democracy is to
blossom on a national level. its
precepts must be practiced at
home, i.e. at the local level.
His final advice to all citizens
was, “Acquaint yourself with
the power structure of your
community. If it: is good, sup-
port it; if it is bad, oppose it."

Grinnell Prof AuthorsVolume
On Early Yeats Manuscripts

“Yeats at Work," a critical
study of William Butler Yeats'
pre-publication manuscripts by
Curtis 8. Bradford (English)
will be published in June by
the Southern lllinois Univer<
sity Press.

Publication or the 384-page
book will commemorate the
centennial of the Irish poet’s
birth. He died in 1939.

Bradford has devoted most
of his scholarly research to the
work or Yeats for 20 years and
has been actively researching
the book since 1954. He did ter
Search work in Ireland during
the 1554-55 academic year and
again in the summer of 1960,

and at Harvard University dui‘
ing the summers of 1958 and
1959.

Bradford's research included
combing through the vast but
nearly illegible collection of
working manuscripts left by
Yeats and tracing the develop-
ment of poems, plays. and
prose from their beginnings to
finished form.

Vernon Sternberg, director of
the Southern Illinois University
Press, calls the book “an in-
credible work . . . the result of
a Herculean task of collation
and hard labor by an extremely
dedicated and accurate textual
scholar."
