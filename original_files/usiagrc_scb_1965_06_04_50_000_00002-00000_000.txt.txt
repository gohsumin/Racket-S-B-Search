As French House Disappears — So Does Le Fee

By Kris Nash

The closing of French Housei
next year will mark the disappear-l
once or one of Grinnell Cullege's‘
most engaging personalities, She.
iS AnneMarie LeFee, a “special
student” who has acted as head»
resident at French House for the
past two years.

A native oi France, Miss LeFee
was born in Montlucon, an indus-
trial city at about 60,000,

Miss LeFee obtained a “License.
d’anglals" degree in 1963. The Li-
cenSe-d'zlnglais qualiﬁes her as an
English teacher in any French sec-
ondary school. Although compari-
sons are awkward, the License—
(le'anglais is roughly equivalent in
an American MA. degree. Though
she carries a typical Iohour class
schedule at Grinnell, most at the
courses are taken as "audits.”

The system oi higher education
in France is completely diiierent
irom that ol the 11.5. Secondary
school students graduate one or
two years later than in America,
and are presented with degrees or
slightly less value than the Ameri—

Inlernational Education in New
York. She Wanted a job whlch
would allow her to make instruc-

‘tinllal use at her knowledge at

French as well as enabling her to

. . Iowa College, at Grin-j
neil, has been a great lorce in
Iowa. The prospect that it will
make a larger growth and ex-
tend its influence is one to be
met with general acclaim in this
state, The college was born
rlgi and has lived right, It has‘
been not only one oi the best
or educational institutions but,
a lorce ior righteousness in liv-‘
ing and in politics. Always there‘
has been “something different”
about the school. It has created
a term in educational circles
“t h e Grinnell atmosphere”,

in the

microns, nutrinos,
alpha particles, beta particles,i
and. . and. . l

“And gamma rays."

“Yeah. You just go on and
on making more and more, It
never stops! What have you
got then?"

“This iS a real philosophical,
probleml Look what you've got‘
—notning but surface!” ,
”N0, there's still the Same
volume.”
“Oh. Really? Still, but who
about all those little particles

ii mean, they get smaller an

really cut ’em down to nothing;
what would you have, man?.
How do you get volume out 0

Miss LeFee'S tenure at Grlnnell
was arranged by the Institute at

Last summer, the 25-year-old
English major went on a three-
week bus tour which carried her
lrhrough Atlanta, Birmingham, New
Orleans, and other points in the
Deep South, The l.I.E, made it

 

,posslble for her often to stay with
‘lamllies living in the areas she
;visited. This was an opportunity
or extreme interest, ior she dIS-
covered the people to be congenial
,antl outspoken, with a variety 0!
attitudes toward the many Comm-
versial issues existing in the South.

This summer Miss LeFee plans
another llE. Greyhound tour to
New England and areas oi iha
Eastern United States. This five-
week trip will be complemented
later by a six-week junket through
New Orleans to the West coast and
Northwest.

When America is finally left be-
hind, Miss LeFee’s future offers
numerous opportunities, either
abroad again or in France, She
may remain at home and study
for her Ph,D,, or She may Seek
employment as a teacher or as a
translator in some lndustrlal field.
though she claims to be undecided.

Another lit Miss LeFee‘s firm
preierences concerns big cities.
She has become used to life in
these areas and feels that Gl‘lnnell
and similarly isolated Institutions
may be slighting their students. A
Certain "dreamrqualily" of delach<
maul exists, She believes, at a
iscllool located “on the plains."
“Although I have many view-
points which I’ve changed since
icomulg to Grinnell,” she explains,
‘thls Is one I still maintain.”
