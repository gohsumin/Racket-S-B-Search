LETTERS TO THE ‘EDITOR

Refutes Dean Wall
0n FBI Statement

To the Editor:

I would Ii e to correct the mis-
‘nformatian presented by Dean
“7311 concerning the recent. FBI
investigations. I was involved in
the investigation because my
roommate was arrested in Chis
cago. Contrary to Dean Wall’s
statement I was not contacted
by anyone in administrative au-
thority, and the meagre attempt
to relay :1 message failed mis
erably. No one ever inioimed
me of my legal rights. I was not
aware that 1 could have had
legal counsel or someone pre-
sent during the questioning.
There was never any agreement
to meet with the agents. I did
so only because no alternatives
were ever presented.

Asks Frank for "Proof"

To the Editor:

(Re: “Des Moines Register"
29 October 1969 pp. 1 st 7)

Lawrence Frank, a member
of the Grillnell college com.
munity, and one of those who
went to the SDS meetings and
demonstrations in Chicago over
the weekend at October 11,
made the statement that he and
some others (he used the term
”we") “saw information passing
both ways" between the college
administration and the FBI be.
fore and during the meetings
with several members of the
group that was under investiga—
tion by the FBI

As a member oi the college
community. as well as a citizen
at the United States. interested
in what is happening around
me. I would call upon Mr.
Frank to publicly state, without
any equivocation or double talk.
exactly what information he and
his lricnds “saw” pass trom the
administration to the FBI. So
iar, all he has done is to call
the administration’s words into
question; that's hardly proof of
anything.

To indict is one thing; con-
viction requires proof, So iar,
there has been none.

Ob Squad "Too 0b"

To the Editor:

As both a Grlnnell alum and
a “townie" of recent years, I
have been favorably impressed
with the growing support tor
Grinnell athletics as evidenced
by increasing attendance at
games and the spirited enthus-
iasm among spectators

This tall the “Oh Squa
Grinnell's unorthodox cheering
section, has provided it unusual
but lively support tor the root
ball team both at home games
and away. This support sur-
Dasscs any enthusiasm I have
witnessed at Grinnell since my
undergraduate days here.

In addition to the spirit they
rally. their comic although
sometimes offrcolor antics have
Provided a source of amusement
and entertainment for the rest
of the crowd until recently.
Many of the cheers used with
gusto at the Monmouth game
were extremely distasteful to
those spectators who support
Grinnell College, Gl'innell ath-
letics, and Grinncll students and
NIH) enjoy taking their children
70 Grinnell games. I hope that
during the basketball season the
0b Squad will continue its an-
ties, but with more intelligent
ingenuity and less founlettel‘
words.

Wants Manners on Campus

To the Editor:

I would like to comment upon
the ideal of the college com-
munity and its debasement on
this campus. I conjecture that
its maltreatment is derived not
from ignorance her lack of
ideals, but egocentrism and self~
interest,

We hear news to surfeit about
the purportedly “beautiful peo.
ple;" the liberal, considerate.
nonsplastic, humanitarian, gor-
geous, groovy, wonderful, lov-
able person. And. supposedly,
there should he a very largo
number of such beings on this
very campus. Many people
staunchly maintain that there
are; l staunchly maintain that
the only things that are beauti.
Iul around here are perhaps the
trees and maybe a dog and a
squirrel here and there,

mi. as

senators 7 and Weathermeni
so I’ll qualify: or the large num-
ber of people i have met on the
Gnnnell College campus. 1 have
round perhaps one or two in the
entire community who could be
considered even remotely po-
tentially “beautiful," Note. I say
potentially. (I can just hear my
“friends” saying, “He must
mean me")

The foundations of my argu
ment stem from small ann0y~
ances, which in gestalt build to
create fissional iorces rather
than cohesive ones and are thus
detrimental to the college com.
nunity as well as contributing
to the “ugliness” of many indi.
viduals . .

l_recall with sentiments bor-
dering on violent nausea incl-
dents of blatant and obnoxious
selfishness in the dorms. intra-
mural sports, collegiate events,
meal lines, dining halls, and
extracurricular activities. 1 or.
ten find it extremely diii‘icult
to stand in meal Lines without
closing my eyes so that 1 don’t
have to see all of the people
doing all their little obnoxious
shticks with the added annoys
ance of asininc “jock” cuts. Al-
50, I have vowed not to partici.
pate in intramural sports due
to already bad experiences.
Some of these affronts have
been personal but most have a
generally prismatic eliect on
the community as a whole. 0th-
er manifestations of this sub
eretan moronic behavior are ob-
servable in the broken iorum
door and other destruction of
college property which is, in
actuality, our property that is
being destroyed by the very
pteople (us) who are paying for
V .

The popular generic term
“ego trip” very adequately ex.
presses a major cause of this
entire problem. You don’t have
to be socialistic to be at least
a little humanistic and sincerely
considerate. I say sincerely con-
siderate; attectatlon does not
belong here. We can do nicell
without pseudodiberalism. But,
if everyone would just still
maintain their individuality on
a less obnoxious level, condi.
tions might be at least tolerable.
l, for one. am sick and tired of
living with people whose exist.
once is defined by slovenly ar-
cissistic behavior and swi ish
attitudes, I am exasperated by
the misinterpretation of “free—
don-l“ as license to proceed to
tally uninhibited by anything

but self-interest. I am disap.
pointed that. at Grinnell Col-
lege, it is exigent to be extreme.
ly aggressive and thoughtless in
all activities including such nor.
mal ones as eating and trying
to enioy yourself somewhat at
sport or whatever.

Bring 'Em Home
To the Editor:

Many of my college friends and
fellow countrymen are probably
11 under the false assumpv

n that President Nixon plans
to end our military commitment
in Vietnam and abolish the
Present draft System The ar-
rival of my induction notice on
24 Oct, 1969 awakened me to
the fact that the United States
population has been consuming
a steady stream or propaganda
concerning these issues for the
last few months. at least.

After three months of job
hunting. both through employ-
ment agencies and individually,
it became apparent that most
employers are extremely hesi—
tant about hiring 17A college
graduates. When Nixon an-
nounced that troop withdrawals
from Vietnam made it possible
to spread the induction of those
men on the October Call over
November and December and
cancel the calls for these later
two months, I approached my
local board and was informed
that I would not be threatened
with induction until after the
first of the year. I decided to
seek temporary employment to
await what I thought would he
a rapidly coming announcement
that the draft system had been
drastically modified. I was giv.
en a job in a local US. Post Oir
[ice and proceeded to make a
tow charge purchases, i now find
myself in a bind to pay my
debts before my induction on 12
Nov. 1969, My local board said
that they too were surprised to
receive orders for a November
call. They also mentioned that

the call was the largest in sev-
eral months.

It is time that the American
people is given the truth by its
government. I urge you to do
everything in your power to in.
fluente congressmen and other
elected officials. Let's get all
of our representatives striving
to end the war in Vietnam,
the present Selective System,
and the steady stream oi mi n-
formation ilowing from the or.
(ice of the President of the
United States. it is not in the
least hard to understand why
many of my contemporaries
want revolution. They and 1
both hope for a totally tree and
equal world where all men are
treated as individual humans
rather than numbers, While this
totally irec world is impossible
without a third world war,
there is no valid reason that
the United States can not be.
some more free and humane.
Only an actively concerned pub.
lic can put an end to the in-
human treatment of our mi i.
tary system, No longer is it
realistic for the us. to try to
protect the rest at the world
irom communist aggression.
Now is the time to bring our
men home where they belong to
help make our country a better
place to live and work.
