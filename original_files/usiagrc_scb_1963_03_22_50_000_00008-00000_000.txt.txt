Ex-jcistice ConJemns Decision

To the Eilitur:

Because the Grinllell College
High Court has rendered itselt
virtually impotent. 1 am an-
nouncing my resignation [mm
the, position OI Justice of the
High. Court. in essence, the
High Court has decided that it
is not competent to rule in cases
of constitutionality. This is par
(lclllarly unfortunate because
the Student Government Assoc
ciation Constitution says, “Only
the High Court shall have the
pow-er to interpret this consti~
tution"

For the benefit oi both my
colleagues on the court and
the students of Gimnell, i must
elaborate. What do I mean
when I say, "The High Court
has decided that it is not com-
petent to rule in cases of com
stilutionaltly"? On Tuesday ev -
ning, March 19, the High Court
heard the case of Margaret
Martin vs. AWS Board Miss
Martin was contesting the con—
stitutionality of an election
procedure which the AWS
Board had instituted. After the
court heard the case presented
by both the plaintiff and the de~
fcndant, the court deliberated
and reached its decision. That
decision upheld the arguments
which the plaintiff, Margaret
Martin, put forth, by a vote
oi 3‘2.

When this do sion was rcaclle
ed, a {acuity advrser to the
court stated that thc defends
ant. the AWS Board. might
choose to contest the court den
cision by questioning the inn
partiality oi at least one of the
High Court members, He noted
that one member of the AWS
Board had suggested this possi-
bility to him, Immediately, the
court members
ollcd in an attempt to
impartiality, but they could
reach no consensus. One mom»
ber‘ said that impartiality is an
absolute term; another said that
no court member can be impar-
tial it he has heard any argue
nlcnts presented outside of the
courtroom; a third said that nine
partiality simply is a conscious
etiort to keep an open ninid
during the court proceedings.
And so the court members hurL
ed dciinitiens back and forth at
one another tor an hour.

But the integrity of thc court
had been challenged. Ther-elore,
each court member was asked
to state whether or not he
could render a disinterested
judgment, When the two wo~

nicn members were called upon

to state their impartiality, prob-
lems arose which the court was,
not able to overcome. Clcarlyl
the decision oi the High Court
would aliert every woman at
lGrinncll. Could either woman:
on thc court, then, be if inter-i
cstcd‘>\ Furthermore, discussions;
on the issue had permeated the
quadrangle. Could cither wa—
man say that she had escaped
hearing all such discussions7
Ultimately, both women ab-
stained because their integrity
had been questioned, and he-
icause they could not honestly
answer “yes" to either of the
above questions. Because both
women abstained, the oiiginal
decision oi the High Court was
reversed, and the deichdant
won by a vote oi 271.

ii the High Court continues to
proceed according to the policy
which determined the outcome
of the case of Margaret Martin
vs. AWS Board, it will no long-
er bo able to decide in cases of
constitutionality. if ever a pro—
vision in the Men’s House

the court must disqualiiy (hem-

The court has indulged in an

no such thing as the kind of
impartiality which the court
member. have been seeking.
since each court member lives
within the system he is being
asked to judge, he, cannot pos-
sibly be absolutely impartial
All that can be expected of any
court member is that be honest
1y try to hear both sides oi
every case.

Quite candidly, i do not think
that, in the luture, the court
