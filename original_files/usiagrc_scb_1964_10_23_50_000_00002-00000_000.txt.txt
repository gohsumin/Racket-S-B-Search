Resident Advisers

‘- A program for residential advisers in halls on

North Campus is in the discussion stages with college
officials. .

\ In a statement made this Wednesday, Dean of the
College James H. Stauss admitted, “I have an interest
in the wide consideration of the possibility of ball ad-
Yisers.”

Dean of Men S. Eugene Thompson also professed
an interest in such a program He stressed, however,
that the presence of David McBlain, an instructor in
mathmetics, in East and West Norris halls this year
Is not in any way meant to signal an imminent imple-
mentation of a resident adviser program.

“McBIain is an instructor in mathematics and noth-
ing else. His residence in the Norrises is due to the
availability of the suite left vacant when Mrs, June
Main became a housemother on South Campus,” said
Thompson

Although the program is only in the discussion
stages and although McBlain’s only official duty is to
teach mathematics, the vacant suite on Norris seems
to have provided college officials with an opportunity
to study student reactions to faculty advisers

Explaining the extent of administration considera-
tion of a resident program, Thompson said that he has
been talking with officials from colleges which have
such programs. “We know resident advisers work well
at other schools, The program is worth studying. There
is, however, nothing in the college’s budget for this
program, and there is no hiring going on. It has been
discussed with the CofHP and a couple halls.”

Thompson assured the campus that no resident ad-
viser program will be instituted without consulting stu«
dents.

As Thompson sees the advisers, “They would be
people with a standing in the academic community,”
They would include faculty, graduate students, and oth-
ers with academic positions.

According to Thompson‘s argument, r e s i Cl e n ts
would provide an adult source of information and would
not be used for policing.

Grinnell now is one of the few colleges in the coun-
try with no resident adviser program in conjunction
with a hall system, A resident program was given'up at
Grinncll in 1953, partly because residents were not easy
to find. Thompson noted that while there was apparent-
ly no student agitation for doing away with that pro
gram, there also was no great sense of loss.

Should Grinnell have to exhume a program dead
eleven years — a program that Thompson admits is
hard to staff? Is this program mainly an adult source
of information or an adult source of continued uncer-
tainty?

To the Editor:

We suggest that the columns
now known as “Scarlet Fever“
and “Animal Life” either be
renamed “Clark Hall Fever"
and “Isn't Clark Wonderful?"
respectively, or return to their
former policies of considering
athletic events of concern to
the entire campus.

FORUM NEWS

“The possibility that the
Forum will be open for use be-
fore Christmas vacation is not
very great," reported Merritt
Ludwig, vice president, this
week.

In other news concerning the
Forum, Ludwig said that me
ad hoc administrative commit-
tee for the Forum is in the
process of formulating a gen-
eral policy for operating the
newest campus addition, This
committee -— which now in
cludes Dean Thompson, Dean
Slocum, Mrs. Jewell Hawk,
Miss Georgia Dentel, Fred
Huggins, and Ludwig — will
soon be joined by four students.

Dear Editor:

in this letter I wish toadeal
with Master A, Sad Freshman’s
latest failure. His “penetrating
observations on campus imma-

turity were definitely confirmed
by two letters in last week’s
S813” — especially his own. He
wished to offer examples of
immaturity — he certainly did.
One can easily dismiss his
"sad" letter. However, I will
condescend to enter an epistola-
mry debate with this pole-
micist. I feel a change in direc~
tion is needed from condemna-
tion of imaginary faults to pro-
posals for the common good.

In reCEnt weeks the role of
the Student Senate and SGA
has been questioned. They have
been criticized for serving no
purpose. Despite the usurpation
of its power by The Administra—
tion, student government can
remain as a functioning body —
a domestic peace corps, so to
speak;

Why should the school drait
troops for the “Forum Legion,"
and consequently incur addi-
tional expense? Responsible
student leaders could volunteer
to fill the ranks.

Student Senate politicos could
also serve in other ways. The

Homecoming floats have lit-
tered the campus. Trees are
dropping their leaves. A com-
mittee of civic-minded student
leaders could clean up the cam—
pus by picking up napkins,
preps victimized by upperclass~
men‘s “innocent humor,“ and
dead leaves, This “White
Knight” committee could also
patrol the halls Sunday mom-
ings to dispose of Saturday
night's refuse, thus saving the
hall exorbitant BELG assess—
ments. In time the White Knight
committee could extend its op-
erations into other aspects of
maintenance I feel the student
leaders are responsible enough
to perform these tasks.

At first glance these pr0<
posals may sound a bit unrelan
ed to SGA'S normal duties. Yet
the future of student govern~
ment is in doubt, its legislative
power has been removed. but
its service power remains. By
their actions student leaders
can set an example of “cone
sciousness of social responsibil-
ity" and “service to their fels
lowmen (College Bulletin)" .-
thus perpetuating their offices.

These are but a few proposals
for student service. Student
government is an hereditary in-
stitution, but its future rests on
shifty foundations. I call for let»
ters supporting my proposals.
(Those with other proposals
and arguments may a l s 0
write.) “I doubt not that they

will be forth coming." SGA—all
the way.
