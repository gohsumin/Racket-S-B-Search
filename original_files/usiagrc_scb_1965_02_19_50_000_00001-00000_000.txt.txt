South Campus Doors Need locks.
Senators Proclaim In Resolution

By Jeanette Mall

The following resolution was
unanimously adopted at the
Student Senate meeting Wednes-
day night:

WHEREAS it is the right of a
student to be secure in her
person, room, and posses-
sions (page 43, Student
Handbook), and

WHEREAS students are re-
sponsible for their own per-
sonal property. . . and the
college is not responsible
for loss, theft, or damage
to such property arising
from any cause (page so,
Grinnell College Bulletin),
and

WHEREAS doors locked when
a person is absent from her
room would not destroy the
congenial student attitude
within the quadrangle but
would rather prevent an at-
mosphere of suspicion, and

WHEREAS women students are
not at present allowed to
assume the responsibility of
personal protection if they
so desire, and

WHEREAS the theft rate in
the women’s quadrangle
has increased noticeably

“Be it resolved that the Stu-
dent Senate feels it is the re—
sponsibility of Grinnell College
to provide its women students
with a means of protecting their
personal property by installing
locks on room doors in the
quadrangle,"

Another resolution concerned
with the SGA election date was
adopted. “Resolved: That AF

 

ticle 11, Sec. D, (1) (a) of the
SGA Constitution shall not pre-
vent the election of the SGA
President from being held on
March 15, 1965."

The son constitution states
that the SGA election shall be
held in the second semester no
later than three weeks before
spring break,

ident Judy Edquist reported
that the proposed change in
room drawings for women’s
dorms was overwhelmingly de-
feated in house meetings last
week, The change had been sug-
gested by Dean of Women Jean

Is Religion Going to Church? Variety
Of Answers Offered by Seminarians

relevance of contemporary re-

By Connie Simon

A panel of five senior semi-
nary students, visiting Grinnell
last weekend under the spon-
sorship of the Board of Relig-
ion Interfaith Committee, spoke
informally Sunday night in the
South Lounge comfortably
filled with students.

The panel centered their
thought around the announced
topic, “ls Religion going to
Church?" Members included
Fran Myska (Bethel Theologi-
cal Seminary, St, Paul); Wil»
liam Brown (University of
Chicago Divinity School); Miss
Bertha Eby (Chicago Theologi-
cal Seminary): Larry Bremer
(United Theological Seminary
of the Twin Cities); and Neil
Housewright (Vanderbilt Un
versity Divinity School),

Viewpoints presented ranged
from support oi the Church as
an institution to a considerably
more liberal point of view. All
members of the panel, how-
ever, expressed a belief in the
church, in some form, as be-
ing requisite lor religion,

Representing the conserva-
tive point of view was Brown
who based his support of the
church upon its connection with
Christianity, which he spoke of
as being “distinguished from
and preferable to “mere relig-
ion."

0n the other h'and House-
wright frankly questioned “the

 

ligious institutions," His en<
thusiasm for the church sprang
not from its traditionally
ascribed functions, he said, but
rather from his recognition of
the church of today as “a great
orealtlve force" and the source
of “much social action." House—
wright cited the founding of
colleges and the furthering of
the civil rights movement as

Stealing Major Problem In Quad;
Numerous Cases Heighten Concern

By Sue Taylor

Several thefts in the women‘s
dormitories last week have
brought the problem of stealing
to the forefront of campus con<
cern. The speculation within
and without the quadrangle as
to the sources of and answers
to the problem has increased.

See editorial on page 2

That ‘thievery has been a
little more prevalent this
year than last,” was confirmed
by Mrs. Marjorie G. Ravitts,
assistant in the quadrangle of-
fice, to whom all reports of
stealing are submitted,

However, Jean M. Slocum,
dean of women, said many

‘A’ * ‘k

thefts occur which the office
never learns about.

Most often it is money that
is stolen, These thefts usually
have occurred around the quad-
rangle dining room and in stu-‘
dents‘ rooms.

Mrs. Ravitts pointed out that
stealing was particularly heavy
just before Christmas vacation.
Another heavy wave of stealing
has occurred within the last
three weeks.

On Dec. 9, Miss Slocum sent
a memo to all women students
warning “that money and
purses cannot and should not
be left unattended," and urging
particular caution. She also
announced that arrangements
had been made with Saga of-
ficials for women to carry

son.

Thompson and the local po-
lice brought the case to a con-
clusion last Saturday night af-
ter the student was recognized
from a description provided by
his last Victim.

The two known break-ins oc-
curred on the evenings of

dows along the loggia roof on
the second story. From there he
walked up to the third floor.

Several articles of cloth'mg
were taken during the first en-
trance; these were later found
torn and discarded near Cowles
hall.

In the second breakdn, the
student was surprised by his
victim and escaped by jumping
from the third story window to
the loggia roof and then to the
ground, Nothing was taken in
the second break-in.

Student ‘on Ride’
Ends in Suspension

A West Norris junior has
been suspended for three
weeks for taking and using
John Burma’s (sociology) auto-
mobile without the professor's
permission.

The car was taken from in
front of Burma's home on
Ninth Avenue late at night on
Thursday, Feb. 11.

Dean of Men 5. Eugene
Thompson said that the stu-
dent had been drinking but was
not intoxicated.

The student was apprehended
when the car halte‘d because of
a mechanical failure and a
Grinnell police car on patrol
stopped to see if .help was
needed, There had been no re-
port of a stolen car, and the po-
lice had merely stopped to help
what they thought was a car
stuck in the snow.

The student was alone when
apprehended. No charges were
filed or pressed by Burma.

 

their purses into the quad din-
ing room, a practice which had
previously been a rule yiolw-
tion.

During the first twelve day:
of February, according to Mu,
Ravitts, about $150 was stolen
in 17 different cases. The great
majority of these 17 thefts were
money, she said.

Valuable books, jewelry, reo-
ords, perfume, and clothing
have also been taken from
rooms.

Main hall and Read hall havl
been hardest hit in the thefts.
However, no hall in the quad-
rangle has been entirely free
of stealing, The president of
one hall knew of only two
cases of stealing (both money
in the range of 310-15) in her
hall, while the president of an-
other hall reported only threo
cases, all thefts of money.

On a single night following
comprehensive exams, two
sums of money were taken
from one room in Main hall,
and a second room on a differ-
ent floor was rifled but nothing
was stolen,

One basement room had $10
and $15 stolen from it on sepe
arate nights in the same week.
In both instances, the money
was hidden in drawers under
clothes or cosmetics,

In another basement, four
rooms were robbed the same
night during interim, but the
total amount of money taken
was small,

Other thefts range from
framed pictures to purses con-
talning such things as glasses,
keys, and identification.

One purse which was taken
contained $35 cash, as well as
other valuable items such as a
pen and glasses. Recently, sev-
eral purses containing around
$20 cash have been taken from
Main lounge.

The library has also been the
scene of several thefts, rang-
ing from cash Values of $.25 to
$26.

A check was made with Pete
Read CofHP president, and S.
Eugene Thompson, Dean of
Men, both of whom said that
stealing has not been a parti<
