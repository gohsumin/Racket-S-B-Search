Men 0r Marmalade?

Men have always loved to label. Tlley have labelled
with equal zeal everything from plum preserves and paclo
ages to races, religions and beliefs. We have little argument
with the plum preserve people. Where this sort of thing
can become dangerous however, is outside of tlle kitchen
or the posteoffice, in history books, the arguments of care
less debaters and on the college campus.

, Jiidx‘ ”null. sum FM“

One such careless form of labelling seems to be occur—
ring presently at Grinnell. Some people are delighting iii
pointing fingers and loosely assigning" tlle titles of ”Con-
servative” and “liberal” to almost everything and everyone
\in sight. It seems to us that these are rather strange lines

of demarcation on a campus dedicated to liberal education,
a campus where so many shades of belief ex t.

Furthermore, nobody seems to be very sure just what
these labels mean. The best we have been able to get from
the average Grinnellian who is freely using these terms are
personal references. “So and So is a conservative” ”So and
So is a liberal.”

, Last week‘s “Forum for Dissent” suggests a specific
instance of dﬁigerous labelling in the college community.
Labelling professors according to supposed political beliefs
can lead to the worst sort of academic calamity. Would it
not be contrary to everything this college stands for if
professors were hired on the basis of their political at-
t"udes rather than their abilities in various fields? The
extremes of tapeerecorders iii the classroom, suppression of
opinion and eventually loss of academic freedom are only
steps away from this kind of thinking.

It is interesting to see how careless sorts of labelling
fall down in practice. An example of this was seen at a re-
tent coffee hour when two professors, supposed ”liberals”,
took almost opposite positions on the Berlin crisis. One be-
lieved that negotiation must go on, and that we might in
fact have to withdraw from Berlin; one felt that negotia—
tion was no longer possible.

We have never encountered a professor who made an
editorial remark iii class that he did not identify as just
tliati The problem among some of our population seems to
be a lack of perception in distinguishing the editorial re—
mark from the interpretive remark. Such problems as the
“Forum" mentions arise, not from increased editorializing
on the part of the professor, it would seem, but ratller, from
the laziness of the student who does not carefully investi-
gate the pertinent classroom material. We must remember
that few significant faculty changes have been made in the
last four years to warrant the strange reaction \vliicliisnow
occurring. Furthermore, never in all our four years at Grinv
hell, have we rilii into a classroom situation wllere all views
were not given “equal time". We have seen papers pure
porting positions on the right and positions on the left re-
ceive D‘s and we have seen both kinds of papers receive A's.

It is true, of course, that there are those students and
faculty with political views which might be easily located,
either to the left or right of center, and we are by no
means suggesting that people become wisliyewashy or silent
about their beliefs. What we object to are those few care-
less critics who refuse to remember that there are countless
pigeonholes within the pigeonlioles alid beliefs within be-
liefs, and that there are Vast unexplored areas of thought
which can hardly be accounted for by only one or two
names which we have hardly begun to define.

What lies behind this tendency to label is the apparent
need to escape the comple. ties of our 20th Century exis—
tence, by seeing everything as either black or white, and
imagining our world as a place where good guys and bad
guys are the only inhabitants. We cannot escape reality so
easily without doing ourselves grave harm. The world
is not that simple, and we must face its challenges honestly,
and carefully. We must re-considei‘ our labels and accusae
tions. People are just not plum preserves.

Your general assessment, Bill,
is both ccncious and reasonably

something is being done to one

you when you spccify lack of

to be a poor class. He also
hopes to keep on thickening

some writing in it as well.

The faculty member tries to
achieve a continuing liberalizing

Burkle Describes Japanese College

Ed. Note: For those of you
who are new to the Grinnell
campus, Howard it, Biirklc,
professor of philosophy and
religion, is presently on leave
from (ii-iiiiicll, spending time
at International Christian Uni-
versity in Tokyo. What follows
is a recent letter from Burklc
giving some of his observa—
tions and insights into the en-
vironment of the Japanese
university.

by Howard Bui-klc

We thought that it might be
of some inicrcst to Grinncll
students to hear something
about their couiilci-pnrts in this
Japanese univcrsiiy, particularly
ihcii- thinking on recent inlei»
national events.

Since the Japanese school
bcpins iii the spring. the fall
term is only a continuation of
the current school year and
therefore lacks the quality of
freshness which surrounds the
opening of school in the USA.

Here the books have already
been bought, the courses long
ago registered for and the
merits of this year‘s freshman
class (the best in history . . .
only those from the upper lcn
pei cent of their classes, etc.)
have been sung. Out of phase,
we Americans came upon ilic
dinina already in progress.

Yet there is something new
in the pic. The Russian deci-
sion to resume nuclear test-
ing and the American decision
to follow suit struck sharply
at campus nerves, The Julia»
iiese never for a moment let
you forget that they alone
have experienced the destruc-
tion of nuclear explosion.

All political poi-ties are united
in their open and explicit op.
position to the manufacture,
testing or use of nuclear weap-
ons. Even the Communist party,
which is a tiny minority usuak
ly loyally approving whatever
tllc Soviet Union is doing, felt
compelled to express regret at
this Soviet decision. All of‘ this
kccps the Japanese public aglr
tated They are not hysterical,
noi- wildly aroused, but they
are. as one columnist i~cccntly
put it. inﬁnitely sad.

The ICU students, like most
Japanescsiudcnis, are discuss-
ing World problems \t'lih great

enthusiasm and the boundless
desire to do something to make
their voices heard. They i-e—
membci- quite vividly ihc del'nr
onstrations and riots — largely
student led which occurred
at the limo of Eisenhower’s
scheduled visit.

Some of them wci-c in on
these demonstrations, and they
are proud of men part; houu
ever, ihcy ai-c wary lost their
choirs now be seized and nin—

.nipulated—as they won then—

by destructive forces bent on
blind violence.

There is pent-up frustration
among Japanese students and a
large measure of ethical root-
lessness because of the utter col-
lapse of thell‘ previous ruling
powers and the disintegration of
its system of values. For in
sance, nearly 70Vper cent of ihe
present lcu student body de-
scribes itself as having no slice
glance to any religious body in
tradition.

Thus, the sentiment against
nuclear armaments mun-ms
the stature of n national i-e»
ligious conviction; it is a ml-
lying point for the open sup-
port oi the one value on
which all Japanese today
agree.

All of this provides the back-
ground for lCU’s particular cone
tributlon. One of the members
of the freshman class is Ted
Reynolds, son of Dr. Earle L.
Reynolds, the skipper who in
1958 sailed his ship, Phoenix,
into the U.s. Paciﬁc testing
grounds to protest the testing
of hydrogen weapons there.
As you have noticed if you've
read the papers closely, the Rey»
holds family has recenily sailed
from Hiroshima, whcie ihcy now
live. to Vladivostok, to protest
lhc Russian resumption of icsi.
ing. The Reynoldses' son after
long deliberation, decided to
join his family despite the like-
lihood of their being im oned
for entering without a Visa. or
on some more serious charge.

The ICU siudenfs held an
all-school convocation and for.
inulnted ii resolution support—
iiig the Reynoldseﬁ‘ voyage.
They are also laying plans hu-
a demonstration in Tokyo at

Some people have
that i haven't done anything
this year but use up spice in
an otherwise interesting news

I smile sadly, shake my head
and say nothing. Frankly, there
is nothing i can say. FO)‘ i

rather quaint, but unrcaiilishok-

change in attitude on the part
of the students.

I speak speciﬁcally about
the decorum of the troops at
the Bartok concert Wednes-
day. The Fine Arts Quartet
did, of course, a haul-Mu],

mediate foreground, Roberts

cd and did everything but
whip out a banjo and join in

There must be a correlation
between this almost prevalent
illness and the dazzling show
of bad manners two nights ago.
I refuse to believe that Gi-in-

manncr unless they were sick.
or course, I didn't believe any—

At the end of the Quartet's
display of talent they dared to
bow to the audience three
times. After a smattering of
applause. they were left alone
in the big, new theater. The
crush of Grinnclllans on their
way out was truly a power that
exceeded all force of arms. This
surely was illness, not merely
poor taste, social pressure or a
sudden aversion to Bnrfok's inu-
sic.
