; Senate Studies Bill To ‘Promote Awareness' 0% Grinnell

By Wayne Stengel

Wednesday evening, November
ith, the Grinnell Student Senate
,voted to postpone further consider-
ations of a bill by Senator Dennis
Murphy of East to “formulate pos-
ltive suggestions for making in-
formation about Grinnell College
available to a greater number of
high school students," until a reg-
ularly scheduled Senate meeting
on November 18th,

Senator Murphy's bill was kept

intact despite an effort by Senator
Dan Bucks of Gates to delete the
second of its two proposals which
would establish a committee to
suggest means of “improving and
broadening" the admissions re-
quirements at Grinnell College.
Buck’s motion, overwhelmingly re-
jected _by voice vote, preceded his
expressed opposition to the entire
bill for fear that its adoption would
bring strong criticism on the Sen-
ate for moving into this area at ad-
ministrative affairs. Senator Nol'd
Brue of Cowles reflecting similar
dissensiul’t said that word of mouth
would always be the strongest fac»

tor in interesting students from,

geographically distant points in
Grinnell, and that, despite its
limitations, the Admissions Office
tines an excellent job in selecting
students.

Senator Murphy was quick to age

ert that his bill should in no \vay
‘ e interpreted as an attack on the
Admissions Office, but rather as a
progressive move to make well<
ﬂualified students from all areas
or the United States, particularly
gilt West Coast more aware of
' rinnell, or at least as propor-
tionally aware as such students

erlin, and other schools of‘Grin-
nell’s size and comparable aca-
demic stature.

Using statistics gathered from
the freshman classes entering
Grinnell in 1960 and 1963, Murphy
sighted that only 860 completed an
plicetions reached the admissions
office in 1963, causing admission's
officers to reject one half or less

of all those applying, an occur-
rence somewhat inexplicable at a
small distinguished liberal arts col-
lege. t

The College Board Scot-e median
for the class entering in 1960 was
sufficiently lower than that of any
of the schools which Grinnell nor
mally likes to consider its intellec-
tual rivals. Though the College

Board Score median has risen as
of 1964, Murphy feels that Grinnell
consistently lags behind its aca-
demic competitors because of this
recurrent inability to make itself
known in all parts of the country.

The first tangible aspect of his
bill would be the formation of a
student committee to find out how
the members or the student body

and alumni became interested in
the college and why they made
their final decision to attend Grin-
nell. Senator Murphy declined to
comment on more specific imple-
mentation of his resolution until
after a conference with Admis<
sions Director Robert Sauersend
the final verdict on his proposal on
November 18.
