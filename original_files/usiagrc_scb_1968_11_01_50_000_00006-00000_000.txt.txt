i, Mogee Presents
4-Point Proposal
Before Committee

in a titty-minute talir before
the Student AITairs Committee
Tuesday, James Magee (Politi-
oal Science) blamed students,
laculty. and administration for
the current dormitory visttalion
problem. He ieeis that because
the students and administration
have toiled to solve the problem.
the solution rests with the facul-

cyMaigee stressed his opinion
that the college cannot possibly
accept “home rule" because
students would not enforce the
rules for other students, and
the college cannot be responsi-
tile for students under such con-
ditions,

Magee altered a four-point
Ernposal with the goal of recog-

izing the fact that individuals
mature dramatically and at
different rates during college
His suggestions were: 1) the
organization oi freshman halls
with upperelassmen to serve as
oounselors and supervisors.
l‘hese advisors should be re-
sponsible to the college and con-
genial to the rules; 2) an in<
crease in the offecarnpus non<
dorm living option; 3) a series
or dormitory living options from
which students may choose
;(none including a 24-hour opens
option)? 4) a statement in the
catalogue and to parents that
violation of rules would be pun-
(shedi

For the duration of the cur-
rent school year, Magee sug-
gested that no change be made
in the rules except ior an open
lounge option which, he felt,
would take care of the problem
of legal Visitation. He also pro-
posed that the role of resident
advisers be reexamined, and
that these nles be made more
responsible.

Magee explained that there is
no sense in iiberalizing rules
when students have made it
clear that no rules would be ene
Iorced, He added as the political
lesson that there is some sense
in keeping the outside commun<
icy ignorant of the de facto sit-
venom

ize that, if East's bid was legit-
imate, his partner could have at
a maximum 5 points, raised to
3 diamonds, which was passed
out.

When the dummy was laid
down, South was able to draw
some valuable conclusions about
East’s hand. Observing that the
missing points totalled 16. he
knew that they were all in
East's hand, due to the one N.T.
opening, He also assumed that
the distribution would be fairly
even in all tour hands. He
ducked West‘s opening lead of
the 10 of hearts, which East
took With the queen. East, ﬁnd
ing himself endplayed in all
four suits, returned the king of
Spades to the board's ace. South
then iinessed the diamond jack,
taking the queen in his hand. A
spade lead to East's queen was
returned to his own jack. A
round of trump was played in
which East’s 10 took the boards
9. To prevent (messing himself
in clubs or hearts, East returned
a diamond t0 the board’s ace,
drawing all but one trump in
declarer’s hand. South ledout
the 13th spade, on which he
dropped a heart after East
Sloughcd a club. He then cashed
his heart ace and rutied a low
heart in his hand. Playing East
for 3 clubs to the kingejack,
50th led a club to the 9 on the
board and East took the trick
With the 10. he was left With
the king-jack, the lead or either
of which gave South the two
tricks he needed to make the
colltlact.

The teani-ol-iour tournament
has finished its second round
of competition ill the Forum.
Any new partnerships interested
in playing should contact either
Ken Gordan (ext. 567), Mike
(The Dog) Perry (ext. 353), or

New Lighting To
Brighten Darby

The college is installing new
lighting tixtures in Darby Gym-
nasium. The cost for the project

will be 33,500.

When Mr. Dale Hawn, Direc-
tor of the Physical Plant, was
asked why the college was ill-
stalllng the lights when a new
gym was being built, he replied
that the gym will continue to be
used [or varsity sports since the
new P.E. Complex will not his
fitted with bleachersi

The old lights only provided
18 lootrcandles of light apiece,
while the new lights Will yield
as toot-candles apiece. The new
lights use only 71/2 amps of elec-
tricity as compared to 10 amps
for the old fixtures. There Wlll
thus be a 25 per cent decrease
in operating costs.

The college did not contract
the installation of the lights.
Rather, use men are installing
the lights on what would other-
wise he unused time,

According to Mr. Donald
Lambie, treasurer of the col<
legc, the funds are coming irom
general plant funds which are
used tor capital expenditures
and general improvements.
