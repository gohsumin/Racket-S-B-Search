'Cohon Plans Strict, Student-centered Rules

There is a great disparity be-
tween the law as prescribed and i
thc law as entorced on North ‘
Campus, A major reason is that j
house presidents are called upon 1
to eniorce rules which they andi
their hall mates a) did not maker,
and bi do not behcvc in. l ami'
proposing a rule of law on North _
Campus strict rule, but one :
that is directly related to what E

the students believe is just. ‘

If elected, l intend to Clues-is
tion all the legislation which are:-
facts thestudents and lormulatc
new legislation which is compati-
ble with the beliefs ot the stu- ,
dent population. The house presi—
dents would be responsible to
the students to make sure that
discussions would be made avail-

Converse Calls for Widening 0f CofHP Perspective

The problem hung the ColHP
president at present is [war
l‘old, First, the ComP does not
have a consistent sphere ol cons
*1 ccrn. Herc its president must act
as a coordinator Through his po-
sition on the executive cabinet,
he must establish what issues
and problems the Council should
examine, thus donning that
sphere to which the CotHP can

again, is an important function
of the president of the ColHP in
coordinating the emphasis of the
