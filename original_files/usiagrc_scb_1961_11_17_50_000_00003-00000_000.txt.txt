Washington Trip

To the Editor:

1 would like to congratulate
Coach Bowers and the tootball
tcam tor one ofvtlle best seasons
Grinnell College has ever had.

Many of us don’t realize the
hard work that these coaches
and players do. It takes many
hours oi hard practice totde—
velop a team such as the one
we had this year. More than
this, it takes a lot of desire on
the part or every individual. All
year, this team showed the re-
sults ot this hard work and
great team desire. Time and a.
gain, the last part ot the sea-
son, our team came rrom be»
hind to win, And when they
lost, it was not because or lack
ot desire.

We no longer have to make
excuses tor our football team
We don't have to say “Well.

We’re an intellectual school. not‘

a football school " Now We can
proudly say that We are both.

Along with being one ot the
most outstanding schools of
learning, we have good athletes
too. At Grinnell there is no
sucli thing as a “dumb iootball
player," and l think we can all
be proud of this, We combine

_ athletics with studies and come
out ahead in both. This is one
oi the many things that makes
Grinnell the great school it is.

The fact that Coach Bowers
inherited a team with a very
poor record and in. two years
built a championship team is
next to amazing. And he does
this without athletic scholar
ships!

Let's forget the big bomb and
the world situation {or a minute
and pay tribute to a good foot
ball team and a good coach.
Congratulations, coach and team

and let's get ’em again
next year.
Boll Shepherd

has becn the wording oi the
reterendum that took place
Monday, November lath. Every-
one i think should be against
atmospheric testing it proved
unnecessary and dangerous to
our health. But there was noth-
mg in the resolution that said
or hinted that it could be nece
essary, the implication being that
it was automatically dangerous
and unhealthrui The retereir
dum in my opinion was already
_setl.led before It was even voted
upon, The even more ridiculous
part oi the resolution asked if
you were in favor oi the U,S.S.R.
continuing its testing. That is
like asking the Soviets to be.
have themselves as betitting
good little comrades.

I am glad to know that these
pseudoelnlelleciuals would solve
the world's problems if given
halt a chance to do it their way.
I am further enlightened to
know that God has once again
given the Ten Commandments

to a chosen people.

Vaciferously yours,
James Glenn
