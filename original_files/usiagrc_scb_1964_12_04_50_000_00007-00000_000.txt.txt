Ali

By Paul Trigg

I continue this week with
what, quite tragically, appears
to be the only issue which peo-
ple concerned with Grinneli can
address themselves to in our
school paper—that of the “jock
image." Again. I hope that by
delving further into this prob-
lem I will be able to make
both the context of the problem
and my own feelings more ex-
piicit.

The most obvious, and there-
fore most easily overlooked,
fact involved in this problem
is that no one is admitted to
Grinnell who is intellectually
dull. Certainly one could not be
naive and. absurd enough to
suggest that the admissions de-
partment is admitting “dumb
athletes" who do not have the
potential to add something to
this institution or are not able
to appreciate the many advan-
tages which it offers
, Secondly, as Mr. Pl H. Pat-
terson (class of 42) so adroitiy
pointed out in his letter last
week, there are many Grin—
neil athletes who attain fine
records both at and after Grin—
nelI. The oft—used grade point
comparisons (Athletes 2.7, all
North Campus 2.6), the fact
that three of seven Friars are
lettcrmen, and the many fine
individual a C hie V ements of
Grinnell athletes after gradua-
tion are evidence of this, For
mis article, however, I would
like to eliminate those athletes
with better than a B average,
for generally they are consid-
ered to be academicians rath-
er than part of the “jock
image.” Whether this is fair or
unfair is irrelevant in mis Con-
text. It is the 3‘0 and under
athletes which constitute the
‘jock image" to most students
and faculty on campus.

1 stated in my original article
that it was unfortunate that the
”jock image" was too often
nonacademic. More unfortun-
ately, I am afraid this image is
often a false one which is for-
mulated prior to adequate ex»

perience. Too often students
and faculty fail to judge these
gentlemen as individuals rath-
er than as a ‘jockﬂ‘ There is no
reason to believe that the man
with the Honor G jacket is not
as concerned with who he is and
the nature of man and society
as the long-haired rebel in
boots.

The obvious question now is
what does all this mean? It
means that although Grinnell
may admit a few people who,
except for athletics would not
have been, and as I stated last
week even this is controversial,
the athlete is too often not giv-
en a chance to become an "in-
tellectual." For reasons far be-
yond the Grinnell campus, the
word "athlete" seems to have
noninteliectuei o o n n otations.
Grinneli is striving to overcome

Candidates, Issues and Strut-
egies, a non-fictional work writ-
ten by three behavioral scien-

and Popkin, has been selected

this image and integrate ath-
letics and academics in an in-
tellectually meaningful way.
Until the “jock image” atmos—
phere on campus disappears,
this cannot be achieved.

I cannot resist ending with
a quick retort to the “irate par-
ent," who, along with the “Sad
Freshman” has caused quite a
bit of consternation here. I am
afraid that you don’t know
what you are talking about.
You made outlandish state-
ments which were given no sup-
porting data, and in this writ-
er' 3 opinion, could not be giv-
en any supporting data. In
short, I guess I resent having
my article used as a spring—
board for such an incoherent
and absurd statement as ap—
peared in last week's issue.
