Plan Created for Student- lnit.‘

The following is a proposal
Tor Student Initiated Courses
(SIC) made by the Education
Project to the students, faculty
ind administration for their
consideration. The project mem-
bers have been writing and dis-
cussing several proposals for
curriculum change, but consid-
ers the one [or student-created
courses the most important ior
bringing not only a substantial
change in the lrinds of courses
offered, but also for changes in
methods and student—teacher re-
iationships. Please read the pro-
posals and feel iree to criticize
and make additions to them,
The next meeting of the Educa-
tion Project will be Tuesday,
8:00 p.m., Younker Lounge,

I. Definition: A Studentrlnl-
tinted Course (SIC) is a course
which originates with students,
the planning and direction of
which is a student enterprise
done in consultation with the
faculty. The role of the iaculty
may be as participant, consult<
ant or teacher as defined by

the students. While, as in any
accredited course, the ultimate
evaluation is a iaculty respon-
sibility, the process of evalua-
tion should be largely a student
concern. In particular, the stu-
dents should evaluate the course
as an educational venture, com-
paring it and contrasting it to
more traditional educational ex-
periences. SIC courses will be
identified as divisional, rather
than departmental, courses, i.e.
Social Studies SIC —— (number
to be determined by the initia-
tors in consultation with the di»
visional are appropriate to the
“level" of the course).

ll. Procedure. Students who
wish to initiate a course must
submit a tentative course sylla-
bus to the Educational Policies
Committee in the division with
which the course will be identi<
fled prior to the first meeting or
that committee following the
mid-term break. If a divisional
EFC reiuses to recommend ap-
proval oi the course, the student
may take his proposal to an-
other division or directly to the
Executive Council of the fac-
ulty. Student initiators (and
their faculty sponsor if it is de-
sired) should attend the meet-
ing of the EFC when their pro-
posal is being considered. The
syllabus shall be signed by the
student initiators and their tac-
ulty sponsor.

iii, Syllabus: The tentative
syllabus for the course will in-
clude the name of the course,
the division in which it will be
otiered, its proposed course
number, the number oi credits
expected, the semester for
which it is proposed. It will deal
with the following topics:

1) The content of the course
Ind the evolution of the idea
of the course (How has the
.,orlgtnal idea been modified?
What was the process of
consultation between students
and faculty involved?)

2) The structure and educa-
tional method of the course.

3) The resources to be util-
ized. (Bibliography, tapes,.
films, iield trip, visitors. how
to ﬁnance.)

4) The evaluation p r n c e-
dures to be used. (HOW and
by whom? What evidence of
accomplishment win be pre-
sented to evaluator(s)?)

IV. Enrollment: Alter the
course is approved by the di-
visional EPC and the Executive
Council of the faculty, the
course description will be suh<
mitted to the registrar for in-
clusion in the published list of
courses. Any student may reg-
ister tor the course, subject to
a registration limit imposed by
the initiators of the course. If
the course is oiiered in the fall
semester, incoming freshmen
are eligible to enroll if its mem-
bership quota has not been
ﬁlled by prerregistering upper-
classmen.

V. Grading: Student initiators
of a course may decide whether
it is to be graded, pass-fail, or
credit—erase, or whether this
may vary with individuals in
the course. The credit—erase op~
tion, to be created especially

‘for SIC Courses, implies that if

the student does not meet the
minimal standards oi [h e
course, it will simply be erased
from his transcript.

VI. List 0! Examples: ”Ven-
tures" in Content and Method.
The iollowing' course descrip-
tions were selected from a list
of SlC courses at the University
oi Calilomia, Berkeley, and
from Free University Berkeley,

RACE AWARENESS
AND SENSITIVITY

2-5 units, Sociology 191, grade
of Pass/No Pass. Barbara
Auther, a young black activist
writer and poefess, will give a
series of lectures on speciﬁc
areas of problems of race, such
as: “How Americans Become
Dehumanized," “Equal Ignor-
ance,” “Fear of the Unknown."
Poetry will be used to stimulate
discussions in class. There will
be field trips into the ghettos.
No limit to class size, Tuesdays,
7:30.930 pm.
AUTOMOBILE MECHANICS

Ever been burned by your

“local authorized dealer"? . . .
Ever been struck on the high-
way? . . . Want to know how
the "points" work? What about
buying a used car? This course
will attempt to give a broad
background in the functions of
your auto so you Can rind what
is wrong. We will also discuss
aspects of repair including cost,
so you can protect yourseli ironr
high/fraudulent repair charges.
Preventive maintenance and
other repairs as desired will ue
a part of the course (tools are
available). The relationship of
the auto industry to the (unc-
tionings of the capitalistic sys-
tem and how to cope with this
problem individually may be
topics for interesting discus-
sioll. Time to be arranged.
SARTRE

AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF EXISTENTIAL FREEDOM

2-5 units, Political Science 199,
P/NP. The first weeks of the
quarter will be spent on the
intellectual background of Sar-
tre’s thought. Selections from
Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Kierke-
gaard, Malraux, and auber will
be studied. For about 2 weeks
students will read and discuss
the earlier novels and plays of
Sartre. The remainder of the
quarter will be spent on ex-
cerpts from BEING AND
NOTHINGNESS and Existential
Psychoanalysis, Throughout the
entire quarter, the emphasis
will be on mutual participation
between students and discus
sion leaders, with the prob—
lems of freedom, authenticity,
interpersonal relationships and
human emotions pmvlding the
thematic focus.

There will he a variety or
guest lectures irom other in-
stitutions.

Vii. Motivation for student in-
iated courses.

Grinnell students have al«
ready b e g u n to initiate
courses, but they have been
proceduruuydlsgulsed as
group independents. Obviously
an administrative procedure
is needed to lactiitate the ac-
creditation of these courses
and to insure that all students
not merely the aggressive
few have access to them. The
process we have outlined does
not call inlo being any new

ted Courses

bureaucratic structure;
does insure that courses will
be thought out and submitted
to a certain amount of scru-
tiny before they begin.

It is believed that the credit«
erase option diminishes to some
degree the "taskmaster" role of
the iaculty member. While
evaluation will occur, it is (le-
sirable that this take place m
an atmosphere of cooperation
and joint concern, rather than
one in which students compete
for rewards or punishments.
The crediterase option may in~
deed complicate the task OI des
termining when a student’s
academic standing is inadequate
to allow him to continue at the
institution. It is hoped that this
difficulty can be overcome by
requiring that x number of
credits be completed at the end
of each semester with Y minih
mal grade point. Unlike a re-
corded failure, the “erase" op-
tion does not become an alba.
tross about the student's neck,
and does not scar his record. it
simply signifies what has in
fact taken place; he has tailed
to accomplish this particular
educational goal, and so does
not receive credit for it.

This semester group inde-
pendents — the Education
Project, Contemporary Europe.
an N o v e1, Communication:
Seminar, and the Seminar in
Ethical Discussion -— are ex-
amples of courses which would
fall under the SIC heading.

This list of examples is, at
best, incomplete; the variety
of SIC courses is limited only
by student imagination and
EPC willingness to accredit
them. Catalogs oi SlC courses
from other institutions are
available in the Conference
House lounge lor reading at
any time.
