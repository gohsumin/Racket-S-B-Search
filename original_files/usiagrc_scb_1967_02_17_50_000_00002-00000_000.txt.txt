Siimulu-s for Creativity-

There is some radical thinking going on in our midst. The
Faculty Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum dares
this community to challenge its very foundations. The Committee is
saying that we must be concerned with "the inability of the liberal
arts college to come to terms with the contemporary world." The
Committee asks whether the academic environment at Grinnell —
pspecially present course requirements — produces an adverse
"disciplinary introversion.” To this we respond with an unqualiﬁed
yes, and hasten to add —— it is stifling.

For instance, how many exceptionally native people can Grin-
nell credit to its name. We knew one a few years ago who went on to
a top position in an experimental branch of the communications
field, but then he never graduated from Grinnell; he "dropped out.”
Originators at Grinnell — people with minds of their own who go
far independently — often do not succeed at Grinnell. The narrow
academic rigors force conformity. (It is interesting how, at Grinnell.
everyone looks, thinks and acts pretty much the same.)

The situation of student publications on campus is a case in
point. Those students motivated to contribute to the yearbook, to
Nous or to the 5&5 do so outside the system of acceptable credits
for graduation; thus, often at the expense of their college career.
The problem has wider ramifications to the college as a Whole.
Publications suffer in quality, few students elect to work on
them: they easily die out.

Where does the student at Grinnell find support for creative
energies? The art department offers no independent credit for non-
majors. Grinnell's English department used to offer writing sem-
inars in many literary forms; it does so no longer. We think
Grinnell‘s theater department is an exception, though, and indi-
cates a good trend for the rest of the campus to follow. Right now
one student is developing her ability at film-making under the
auspices of this department.

Grinnell needs to encourage the special abilities of more stu-
dents. Extracurricular activities (Le. student government work),
like any valuable learning process, also deserve credit. A commu-
nication arts department ~ including offerings in broadcasting,
photography and creative writing — should possibly replace the
present Englishrjournalism discipline. Further, the limitations on
independent credit should be dropped. independent study, being
the only study which will continue beyond our college years, act-
uaily deserves priority in our academic program. Grinnell should
be in the business of producing vital people. if it is, its students
will be immersed in the process of creative personal development
and Will be capable “of coming to terms with the contemporary
world." —K. .

Allin Endorsed —

A student government president’s perspective must be broad,
his judgment sophisticated. he must be capable of commanding
respect. We feel SGA candidate Craig Allin is well in tune with
student aims, best fulfills the criteria for mature leadership, and )5
prepared to carry on progressive and constructive government.

An introduction to the Modern Revolution

Cybernatioii: Topic of Broad Scone

By Arnold Adelberg
(Mathematics)

in light of the forthcoming Cybernetion Week—
end, it seems relevant to consider some of the
terms used and look at a few publications that
examine the subject from different vantage
points.

“Cybernetics" is a word coined by the mathe-
matician Norbert Wiener (in a book of the same
name published in 1948) to denote the science of
control and communication processes in both ani-
mals and machines. it is derived from the Greek
word for “steersman.” Cybernetics underlies all
systematic analyses of automation and com-
puters. The field deals with Such diverse sys-
tems as nerve networks in animals, electronic
computing machines, servo systems for automatic
control of machinery and other information proc-
essing systems. It overlaps the fields of neuro«
physiology. computing machines, information
theory and automation, and seeks to find common
features for these.

Just as the 15th century is commonly identi-
fied with the Industrial Revolution, in which men
harnessed machines to replace a considerable
amount of hand labor, the 20th century is often
called the time of Cybernetic Revolution. it is
also known as the second industrial Revolution
and is characterized by the use of machines to
control other machines. The burgeoning technol-
ogy of electronics has been instrumental to these
developments, and in particular, the electronic
computer has been an lndispensible aid.

The high degree of automation of many in.
dustries and the increasing automation of others
is apparent, as is the utilization of computers in
scientific research. In fact, as Daniel Bell, pro<
lessor of sociology at Columbia University, points
out in his book The Reforming of General Educas
tion, “The use of these new ‘intellectual technol-
ogies’ gives mathematics as a subject — and the
computer as a tool — an essential role in re-
search (in the social sciences as well as the name
Ial sciences) and a crucial place in the curricu-
lum. . r 4 All future work in social science will
require a high degree of mathematical training
and sophistication.”

A good introduction to the impact oi Cybernet-
ics on society, present and ruture, is a pamphlet
prepared for the Center for die Study of Demo~
cratic Institutions entitled Cybemaiion: The Si~
lent Conquest, by Donald N, Michael it is here
that the term “cybernalion” was invented. This
refers both to automation and Computers, the
former consisting of devices that automatically
perlorm sensing and motor tasks; the second, of
devices that perform routine or complex logical
and decisionmaking tasks with great speed. Cy-
bernetics is more commonly used to cover the
entire fieldI and in fact, the distinction between
the classes of devices disappears at the many
points where they converge,

The pamphlet explores the effects of Cyberna-
tion on “Employment and Unemployment," ‘ d—
ditional Leisure,” “Decisions and Public Op -
ion." lt Studies methods to control Cybemation,

which apparently creates as many problems til
it solves. it is far from optimistic about the ef-
fects of the eventual and lneluctable Cybernetic
takeover.

information is a paperback consisting of
articles from the September, 1966 issue of the
Scientific American devoted to the subject of in
formation theory. The book covers computer log-
ic, memory, input and output; systems analyses
and programming it discusses the use of com-
puters in science, technology, organization and
education. There are also chapters on "informa-
tion Storage and Retrieval,” and on “Artificial lu-
telligence." A bibliography is provided for more
detailed study of each area.

The Scientific American book is far more san-
guine about the effects of the new technology than
the Cybernation pamphlet. it is not concerned
with such problems as unemployment. or the cre-
ation of a new technological elite, but rather with
the manifold possibilities of electronic information
processing. Among the most striking is the possi-
bility of computers available to the general pub
lie at all times through telephone link-ups, pro-
viding instantaneous information and data proo-
essing.

Another possibility is the utilization of com-
puters in education. Thus, in an experimental pro-
gram at a California elementary school. an lBM
l500 computer is being used to teach mathematics
to first-graders. The point here is not one of eo-
richment, but rather of providing the student with
individual attention and a carefully controlled Way
for him to proceed at the pace best suited to his
needs. The results are remarkable, but of course
at this stage of development, formidably expen-
sive. (See the article “The Computer as Tutor” in
the Jan. 27 issue of Life Magazine.) Furthermore,
it seems clear that computers will not only be a
valuable tool in science, management, etc, but
will in many respects alter nur approaches to
these areas, as they redetermine what is possible
and what is not.

Finally, we have the intriguing possibilities of
the computer “selfreducation.” Basically the in-
formation processing done by electronic com-
puters consists of three operations — input by
which data is lead into the machine, internal
processing of the data, and output. These opera-
tions are of course not independent because the
kind of data processing that is dune and the out-
put are determined by the input. 0n the other
hand, there is a kind of feedback or self»correct-
ing feature whereby the computer — deciding on
a course of action # can refer to its oWn enors
mous memory plus the data available to it at any
given instant. This memory feature enables it to
learn from its past experience. it is conceivable
that the properly programmed computer will not
only perform the tasks assigned to it by its pro-
grammer, but also consider and solve problems
not envisioned by him.

The intent of this article has been to give some
indication of the scope of Cybernetics. *The pur-
pose of the coming Weekend is to provide an op-
portunity to learn more about the subject.

Mariiucinu

To The Editor:

The college community
should attend very closely to
the deans commentary on the
punitive consequences of mrrb
juana usage. As someone who
has gone through the agony of
being arrested and charged
with felonious possession of
marijuana, i can say trom ex.
perience that apprehension is
not only expensive and un-
pleasant, but also leads to pro.
found emotional problems of a
personal nature.

The Marijuana Tax Act of
1937 which led to my unpleas-
ant experience with the law
was the result of misinforma-
iicn, vested interests, and hasty
judgment by the powers that
were. 1 feel an obligation to
publicly correct the dissemiiia~
tions or inaccurate inforinalion

instance, the Deans’ Commit—
tee.

item ' . . as even many
habitual users will agree,
marijuana has no therapeutic
value for those who suffer
from depressions or anxieties
. , The professional litera
ture has reported marijuana to
be or substantial therapeutic
value not only in the treat
merit of neurotic depression
(1, a), but also or anxiety
states, reactive and hysterical
depressions, obsessional tits-
orders, (a) anorexia (1,2), nl~
coholic and drug withdrawal
conditions, and dysphcria (1,4).
The works from which these
references are drawn are rcpr
utable and extensively ref-
erenced.

item 2: i . Dependency
with the use of mariiuaiia
comes about when one is led,
perhaps while under its efa
facts, to use a more dangerous
drug (herein, for example. can

revocable dependency) . . .
Regardless or the ambiguity ct
this statement, there is an ex-
tremely large amount or evi-
dence which indicates that
marijuana usage is not addict
ing (1, 2, a, 4, 5, 7), and does
not tend to lead to the usage
of dangerous drugs which are
themselves addicting (1, 5, 6,
7); only a few of these sources
are tootnuted. it should be
noted that when such infre-
quent progressions occur, they
usually take place in lower so-
cioeconomic strata, where in-
dividuals obtain mariiunna
from criminal elcinents who al-
so scll addicting drugs and
who stand to profit from cre~
ating addicts (a); legalization
of marijuana would inlitimlle
this phenomenon

Tile deans are to be com»
mended for their attempt to
present reasonable informi-
