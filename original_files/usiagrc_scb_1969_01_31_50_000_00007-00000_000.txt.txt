Struggle Pays Off

Last Saturday, Grinnell’s "struggling"
wrestlers oonm’uued their individual win~
hing records, ﬁelding a triple duo in Wis-
mnsin. Three Iowa warns, Grinncll, Cor-
nell. and Coe, wrestled each of three
Wisconsin teams, Beloit, Ripon, and
Iaw-rence. Grinnell's Kraitsik, Laden,
Glick. mppel, Wedding. and human
were all undefeated in their three
matches at the meet, While Kawahara
and Hutchings each had two Wins
and one defeat. Thesp victories enabled
Grinnell {9 remain undeleated in the con-
ferenoe. Kraitsi‘il’. and Wedding both re-
tain ma'r 6-0 records making ﬂhem prime
comenders for conference championships
in meirweight divisions.

Coach Kimbo should be highly wm—
meyided for molding eight wrestlers into

conference championship. Obviously un~
dammed in every "meet. the wrestlers
still continue their winning ways. The

Frosll Victory

ﬁlmy night, the Freshman Bas-
ketball Team won their ﬁrst game of tho
season by beating Knox’s freshman 58-
56. The Freshman, now 1-1 for the sea-
son, are led by 8-8 Bob Burnett at center,
63 Gilbert and 613 Meyer at the for-
wards, and $1 Bombinski and 6-1 Hirsch
at the guards.

The Fresh are like the Pioneers in
that they are good shooters but weak
on dcicnse and rebounding. This was
reﬂected in the high score of their 92-91
overtime loss. Primarily, their main
problem is a lack of conditioning caused
by a six—week layoff.

Originally, Coach Boyd planned on
using a slow offense, and a man to man
defense with a press as the team got
into condition, bu‘ the Freshman beat
Knox by playing very strong defensively
while playing weekly on onensc. This
may cause Coach Boyd to reconsider his
strategy for the Friday game against
Cornell.

Pioneers Miss By One

Tuesday‘s heart-stopping 5953 1055 to
Knox gave the Grinncll College Pioneer
basketball team an o7 conference re—
cord. Autemptlng to improve his team,
Coach Bowers has slowed down the Grin-
nell offense. This strategy change was
panu'mly mponslble for the close scores
oi the Cornell and Knox games

However, in the Knox game, despite
the strategy ohangc, problems with de-
fense rebounding and consistency of play
were still present. In the first half. Grin-
hell was scoreless for four and a half
minutes and made only 30% of their
shots. in outuebounding the Pioneers 19~
11, Knox, on many occasions, had threa
or tour players wanking aminst one or
zero Pioneers under Grinnell's offensive
basket.

in the second half. the situation was
reversed. The Gninnell defense held Knox
to two points in five and a halt minutes.
while the “tense scared ten points to
give Grimell the lead. The Pioneers
tied Knox in rebounding but they still lost
it few because of imperfeot cooperation
under the boards. Gl‘irulell's guards,
woreless in the first half, scored thirteen
crucial points in the second half.

The second half of the Knox game
showed Gninnelll's potential. if this im-
proving tcam can establish mnsistency
or play, it could win the majority of their
renaming games. whatever happem.
everyone should come to the games on
Friday and Saturday because they Will
be very good, just like the Knox game.

Student Considers Future of Music Dept.

By ANN KIRSCHNER

This seems to be a bad year for string
quartets: the world is losing the Budd-
pest and Griinnelll is losing the Lenox.
However, the world will continue to sur-
vive, and it is now up to the music (le-
partment of me college to gather up its
resources and prepare to go it alone,
without the educational and performance
skills of the Messrs. Marsh, Pettys, Mc<
Call and Hersh.

There is no doubt that the benox has
been a drawing card for many students.
both prospective music majors and oth
'ers, and undoubtedly some professors.

Swimmers Meel
Monmouth Defeat

The Monmouth College swimming
team defeated Grinnell 48 to 47 on Jan-
uary Z5. Grinnell was never behind till
the last event. Monmouth lost no dual
meets last year, and they have four
excellent swimmers back. However.
they lack depth and young swimmers.
Grillnell’s team is stronger than ever
before. It is a young team, having but
one senior, a bevy of juniors, and six
sophomores.

Grinnell swims Beloit and Lawrence at

and there is no question that it has en-
riched the artistic life of the college in
general, and the education of the music
students in particular. In fact the Lenox
has had such an imp-ant on the musical
life of Grinnell that it is more or less
being asstuned that a comparable in-
strunienlal group will be hired in its
place. However, without meaning to de-
precate the worth of die Quartet, i think
it would be instructive and highly bene—
iicial to the entire college community to
consider the alternatives to a setup such
as has existed with the Lenox.

Several ideas Come to mind in thinking
of ways to enhance the music curriculum
and extracurricular ohen‘ngs at Gr' -
nell. For instance, why not extend in -
tdtions L0 musicians of various idioms.
such as vocalists, conductors, brass play<
ers, etc. to participate in brief midsu-
tlal programs. such that at least one dil-
ferent musician will be in residence at
Grirmell each year? This could be com—
pamble tn the exchange program in
which the theatre department is partici-
pating with the Milwaukee Repertory
Theatre under a Rockerfeller Fund
grant. The musicianunqesidenoe for the
semmer or year would teach a course.
give recitﬂs. hold workshops. and gener-
ally be available in all interested metri-
bels of the college community.

Other suggestions that have come up
include expanding the concave“: so
as to divem'fy the annual presentations.
Another idea is to hire three or four peo-
pie who are primarily music attractors.
out who would. of course. also he dampe-
tent performers. The emphasis hero
would be on encouraging more student
pcriormanocs. with this program, it
would su'll be ﬁnancially possible to ex-
pand the concert series, supplementing it
won lesser-known performers who would
lie willing to give lectures as well 3:
concerts.

The music department is undergoing
comprehensive alterations for next year.
with more curricular emphasis being
given to course offerings of a non-tech—
nical nature geared to non-music stu-
dents who have a desire to enlarge their
music education, but who have run had
sufﬁcient prerequisites to enroll in cur-
rently » offered music courses.

A reappraisal of the role or the en-
tire music department on this campus
mold make that department one of the
strongest in the college. it is an oppor-
tunity that should not be bypassed.
