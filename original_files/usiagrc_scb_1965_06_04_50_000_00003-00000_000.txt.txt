SCARLET AND BLACK

Seniors leave Different famous;
(lounges Seen As Striking, Solitle

By Sue Taylor

When the class of 1965 came to
Grinnell as eager, naive freshman
in the fall of 1961, we came to a
different campus from the one we
will leave nus afternoon.

The campus looked different and
it lelt different. Some oi the
changes have been the kind that
jump out and hit you in the face,
but some of them are more subtle.

The face of the campus has
changed. The fine arts building
and Roberts Theatre were new
when we arrived. Barber Plaza

was completed that first year —
if Il'S ever been completed. The
library was just one year old —
and the science building didn‘t
have its addition _ even partially
finished.

And the Forum wasn’t here. We
were the first class [D live in three
unions. First there was the old
barracks —< We liked its “Warm"
atmosphere and its sentimental
memories. Then there was Main
hall basement. That, too, has its
memories.

But this year saw the opening
of a new millinnrdollar building
for the union—rat. We adjusted
quickly.

But it the new soon becomes fa-
miliar, there are some old things
that this class knew. Perhaps we
are dated because we really knew
Duane Frankhouse not just
heard about him. But we also knew
the era that he stood for. And it’s
an era that we have seen pass
from the scene.

Maybe it was more of a feeling
— an atmosphere, an attitude.
But it's no more.

Maybe it was enthusiasm. May
be it was just being able to have
fun — and have it wrtltout trying.
Perhaps it. \vas knowing how to

 

taught. because that’s not some-
thing you learn in school.

Our freshman year, there was a
student variety show — complete
with legs contest and a twist con-
lest # and now the twist is so out
dated that it takes courage to do it
in public.

We saw the beginning of liquor-
by~tlieri'oom, and the new permanr
ent openrhouse policy as opposed
to the Various “trial” programs of
open dorms and open moms.

And we are really dated by be-
ing able to say that we celebrated
our 2lst birthdays at the old Rex.

We Witnessed the entire life of
the Ford Foundation grant and its
matching fund. The years of our
Ford were the brunt of several
jokes, but they also brought in
$6,000,000.

There were four years of activi—

ties in politics — both kinds. Stu-‘

dent government had just been re—
organized when we came to in-
clude something new—the student
senate. And this spring witnessed
its death — and the advent of the
advisory council — just half as
much. So go cycles.

And in the world of real politics
— well, a lot happened. The names
of Humphrey. Goldwater, Truman.
Eisenhower, and others graced the
campus. The PPPE saw its great
momenu.

Our freshman year was the first
quasi-legal spring riot. This year
may have been the last spring riot
— legal or otherwise

There were changes in academia.
too. The JLA, and interim came
and went. R. R. Palmer’s History
of the Weslem World Went and
came.

We've seen the coming of a new
dean of men and a new dean of
women — and we’ve been through
the end of the term of a president.

These were years of social con.
scmusness on campus a years of
concern with the movements which
have captured the imagination of

take the tianot having to be . young people all over the nation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One of the more popular relreais from the world of the
academic is the Forum's plush green pool mom — and a.
pmyetl above. its appeal is universal.

They were years of academic
growth and development. They

were years or great moments, ol‘

big plans,
events.

and of many little

A lot of new things have hap-
pened on campus since we came.
A lot of growth has gone on. A lot
oi progress has been made.

But there is something missing
that was here when we came.
Maybe it’s a life style. It's some-
thing that has to do with knowing
how [D have fun. It's a kind of iris
formality that just happens — it
isn‘t planned. Maybe now there is
more “inlori'nality” — fewer tra-
ditions more activities. But
there is a spirit, an attitude, an
atmosphere that isn't here any
more, And it’s too bad.

This afternoon the class of '65
is leaving. It’s too early to de-
termine whether we've left our
work. But we’re no longer as naive
— and perhaps not as eager.

We leave as different people, and
we leave a different campus bee
hind us. who can predict what hap-
pens now?
