Disaster Strikes l in 52

This was a great week for local news here in
Iowa, enabling us to produce a great Iowa news-
paper. Disaster, it seems, strikes en masse one week
every year.

We had the opportunity to cover a robbery
'(LEGGETT DE-DEFURRED, see Page 3); a Grin-
nell professor apprehended for suspected drinking
under age (ALEXANDER PIX, see Page 3); a
quasi-obituary for a former 5&3 copy neditor
.(HECKER ENDIT, see Page 6); a real obituary
(LOCAL IOWAN BURI-
ED, see Page 1); and a
fire — shades of The Vi-
car of Wakefield »— de-
vastating a local minis-
ter’s h o u s e (KATZ
FETCHED FROM HOT
HOUSETOP, a l s 0 on
Page 3).

I o w a weather, of
course, is always a dis-
aster. And apparently it
is always deserving of a
banner headlinerat least
as far as the State’s larg-
est daily, The Des
Moines Register, is con-
cerned.

On the national
scene: Campus cops in
Detroit keep files on all
s t u d e n t s containing
“homosexual tendencies”
and “political de<
Viations;” they also own
a tractor that converts in-
to a riot tank (Page 1).
At the University of
Utah, campus police use
chemical mace as a
“purely defensive” measure (Page 7). We feel like
real live newsmen.

The proposal for alternating dorms (Page 1)
seems a disaster to the editors of the 5&8, but Mr.
MacDowell asked us not to comment on that this
week.

It really was a fine week for black humor.

So you think you've got problems? Things have
been worse, if not just 5 bad. Jonathan Routh’s A
Book of Disaster (available in paperbound for a dol-
lar) goes you one better.

The book contains Vintage-1890 photos and
drawings depicting Some Pitiful People (for exam-
ple, “A Poor, Sick Person Being Visited by His Bet-
ters”); Some Miscellaneous Disasters (eg, a series
of etchings including “Abyssinians Being Massa-
cred," ”Massacred Abyssinians,” and “A General
Exhorting His Troops to Massacre More Abyssi-
nians"); and the like.

“By comparison, ”Routh tells us in a preface,
“the reader's own puny problems and personal de-
pressions are guaranteed to fade into total insignifi-
cance.”

Also featured are Some Mean Thoughts (cg,
“Concealirlg Oneself in thc Undergrowth and Flick-
ing Bread Pellets at Elderly Callers to the House")

All instances of disaster are instances worth rc-
porting. All instances worth reporting are instances
of disaster. All instances occurring this week were
instances of disaster.

Assume your premises, put your statements in
standard form, and draw your own conclusionilogi-
cal or illogical.

Friday, March i. I?”

TOM-TOM PANS POWER. RAPS REC

By SUE T. MILLER

(Editor‘s Note: Tom
Thomas, Gates Sopho-
more, won the SGA elec-
tion Tuesday, Feb. 20,
with a til-vote margin.
Out of a total 839 votes
cast (79 per cent or the
electorate), Thomas got
53 per cent; his oppo-
nent, Dan Cheitetz, got
47 per bent of the total
vole. In this interview
held a week after the
election, Thomas gives
some candid comments
on his aims for the com-
ing year.)

Since the question at the role
of student power was frequenb
1y mentioned in the SGA cam-
paign, Thomas was asked how
much he telt student power
would eiiect administration de-
cislons like the new reception
center.

“Well, they (the students)
can go out and steal the cen-
ters lumber as they ship it in,”
he oiiered, or “like at NYU,
they can lie in front of the
bulldozers as the trees are
plowed: but there’s not a
damned thing i can do about
it. The reception center was
fought by three student govern—
ments beiore me.”

“They (the administration)
are the ones that have the
motley — we can express our
opinion, I think they want us
to, but the students have no
power.”

However. Grinnell Students
and their government do have
the power to organize, Thomas
said, and thls organization
should take place “before we
(himself, com? and AWS Pres-
idents, and the Committee oi
Thirteen) ever go home for
spring break.”

Thomas feels student govern-
ment action Should center
around several key problems:
i) all-campus room—draw; 2)
student advisot system; 3) in—
tegrated campuses; 4) no staii
additions; 5) elimination oi
over-crowding on campus.

“I‘ve given the all-campus
roont draw iitst priority,”
qillpped Thomas, “Since no it-
nances are involved.”

As tor his second priority,
Thomas expects the 70 new
student ndViSOi‘s to be “all the
things the ballleboard should
be, and is not.”

“This includes lots of minor
things," he added, "like iust
lettltig people know when they’re
being obnoxious."

Thomas said he was “dis-
appointed lll [he manner the
administration (1 ho S e to inte~
grate the campuses" and that
he would [Ike [0 see the plan
changed.

“Their integration will Stretch
Gt'inliell's building budget lo
the limit. The blocking eni-
ployctl was dictated mainly by
finances,"

The new SGA President sees
his ionrth pi'iutily problem a
the new RA 5 tom —— as a
“ralhel siruclu A! bull sesslon."

“l'll give on example, Last
year my hall (Gales) had a
Blast year, with everyone not
mg each other, everyone pissed
over what each other had been
doing, So we got together one
night and told each other what
was il'rilalini; about us, things
we had never Sultl. Alter two

months of hate, the problem
was solved."

Thomas puts campus over-
crowding last on his list or
priorities because “some would
rather tolerate it and concen-
trate on other changes."

“Unfortunately," he said, “the
overcrowding, especially on
North Campus, is being amel-
iorated by simply changing the
quads to triples. Already, 51
student living quarters on North
Campus have been eliminated.
This is not an adequate solu-
tion to the problem"

Two ither things Thomas
would like to accomplish this
spring are the ﬁrst steps to-
ward a “free university sys-
tem,” and "considerable ex-
pansion oi the Student Used
Book Store."

”The taculty here has a great
amount of talent that isn’t be
ing used now,” he added.

“It would he a nonrpressure
system—informal meetings in
residence hall lounges, or avail-
able ARl-i classrooms.”

Asked about the status of the
present petition for credit (or
extracurricular activities, Thtk
mas said that it’s still Deﬁne
the faculty. The problem. he
said, is ”how to determine full
participation, For example, how
many times does one have to
sing in the choir to be a choir
member?"

Thomas concluded by reat-
iil'ming his belief in the “indivi-
dual approach” to government.

“We want to get SGA out of
the vacuum, unto the cam-
pusr” Asked to define Ihe vacu-

um, he gave his answer in
the form or a question: “how
often has Ric MacDowell been
in your hall?”

“1 hope l‘m not disappointed,"
he added, “with the people who
turn out to run for the Comv
mlttee of Thirteen. Practically
any student on campus has a
chance of getting elected. i hope
they don't leave it to the
politicos."

“The broader the base (01
student participation), the more
originality of proposals there
will be injected in student gov-
eminent.”

DREAM PREY
T0 HAWK

(the 5&3’5 lawn News Service)

A poster publicizing a Feb-
ruary 25th recital in Roberls
was removed last week from
the Forum bulletin board by
Mrs. Jewell Hawk, Forum Direc‘
tor, prior to the Sunday per-
iormance.

In designing the poster Fred<
ricka Nelson used a small re<
print of “The Dream,” a paint<
ing by the French primtttylst
Henri Rousseau which depicts
a reclining nude serenaded by
a native playing a horn in an
African tainiorest setting.

The original was donated by
Governor Nelson A. Rockeleller
to the Metropolitan Museum at
Art in New York, where it now
hangs as a permanent acquisi-
tion.
