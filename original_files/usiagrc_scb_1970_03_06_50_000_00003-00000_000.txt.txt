President's Report:

The Structure 01‘ Student Power Committees Play

Toward the end of last term,
in response to the desire of
students to consider how they
might play a more effective role
in the decisionrmaking process of
the college, i asked Messr.
Kimbo, Milner, Ryan, Walker
and Kleinschmidt of the faculty
and staff to meet with Messrs
Cohen, Lew, Mears. Nissen,
Schaalman. and F, Thomas,
students who had been appointed
by the Student Senate, and form
an Ad Hot: Committee to
deliberate what Considerations
and procedures it thought might
be most effective.

Subsequently, this Ad Hoc
Committee established three sub-
committees, as follows:

(1) Committee on Social Rules
and Regulations
Students:

Ida Gudema
Lauren Levatin
Steven Ma nnheimer
EstherMosak
Daniel Moshenberg

Mr. MacMuIlen
Mr. Obel‘miller

Mr. Wall

The Committee on Social Rules
and Regulations ls now meeting
and is charged with the
responsibility of reviewing the
existing decision-making
processes, in evaluating
established procedures, and Will
formulate recommendations if
needed, for any change of
procedures. When these
recommendations are ready, i
expect them to be presented via
the Dean of Students' office to a
group I shall designate as
“Committee A," (for Ad
ministration), which will Consist
of Deans Wall, Walker, Low and
Kimbo; the Chairman of the
Faculty, Professor Kleinr

Government Association and the
student coordinator. “Committee
A,“ in turn, will make its
recommendations to me, which
i will then carry, with my own
recommendations, to the Board
olTrusteesattheiunemeeting,

The Committee on Student
Services, which has a mandate
in its area Similar to that of the
Committee on Social Rules and
Regulations, will present its
recommendations via the Dean
of Administration of “Committee
A." “Committee A,” in turn, will
make its recommendations to
me, which I will then carry, with
my own recommendations, to the
Board of Trustees at its June
meeting,

An existing Committee on
Counseling, established by the
recommendation of the com,
mittee of Student Affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of evaluating the student and
resident advisory program and
working with the Dean of
Students. This committee and its
particular function will continue.
A parallel group, consisting of
members of the original come
mittee, plus two additional
students designated by the

Studentb/ Student Senate and Dean WalL

as a resource person _is now being
set up by the Ad Hoc Committee
The mandate of the enlarged
groups is to review the existing
decisionemaking processes, to
evaluate established procedures,
formulate recom-
mendations That is to say, the
function of the enlarged Comr
mittee on Counseling, within its
area, is procedurally similar to
that ol' the Committee on Social
Rules and Regulations and the
Committee on Counseling will
make its recommendations via
the Dean of the College to
“Committee A,” which will then
proceed to forward its recomr
mendations to me and the
trustees as will the Committee
on Social Rules and Regulations
and the Committee on Student
Services,

While these committees set

about doing their work, the
processes of the College must
continue, Existing decision:
making mechanisms must
go on, For instance,
the College must begin
almost immediately to interview
candidate for a counseling
position for an associate
dean of students and

for student and resident.
advisors. in this interviewing

process, appropriate student and

faculty groups, as well as staff
persons, are already involved
and will continue to be. Ideally,
I would prefer to wait for such
interviewing until the three
committees had made their
recommendations and the
trustees had responded, but the
rapidly approaching end of this
year, the need of the committees
to deliberate without undue
haste. and the supply of available
candidates are matters which
have to be considered
realistically and promptly.

Other student Senate comr
mittees which are more con-
cerned with short-range planning
will make their recom-
mendations through regularly
established Channels, It is my
understanding that the Student
Housing Committee and the
Student Handbook Committee
are now meeting with the Deans
of Students and making
recommendations which affect
planning [or this semester.

The Drug Committee,
established by the Student Senate
during the fall semester lose to
plan the drug symposium, has
been enlarged to include three
faculty members, two resident
advisers, and seven students Its
responsibility is to make
recommendations for an on-going
educational program (including
perhaps a “crisis clinic") ap~
propriatc to Grinnell College.
Specific recommendations for
the formulation of any programs

will be sent to the Committee on‘

Student Affairs. This Committee
will study the proposals and its
comments and recomr
mendations, and submit both
reports to me.

i believe you can all see that
the period between now and the
middle of May will be extremely
busy for all who are serving on
the Committees, for the in-
terviewing teams, and for all
those involved in the general
process of giving constructive
thought to how the decision
making processes of the College

can be made more represen-
tative and more effective, For

my part, I want to keep
frustration and impatience to Ca

New York Brass Quintet

By Kathryn Heinze
The New York Brass Quintet,
performing under the auspices of
the Grinnell College Concert
Series, presented a concert last
Saturday evening February 28 in
l-ierrick Chapel. The quintet,
considered to be one of the best
in the country, played to an en-
thusiastic full house and even
merited a standing ovation from
a small number of Grinnell
students. The program which
included works from every
century since the sixteenth
presented an interesting sam-
pling of brass music from all
musical periods. Special em-
phasis was put on the twentieth
century, and for those (ﬁinr
nellians who have developed an
allergy to contemporary
music. the intermission provided
an excellent opportunity for exit.
To this writer’s way of thinking,
it is unfortunate that so many
people chose to turn chicken and
run away at the threat of hearing
something more modern than J.
5. Each; they missed several
very interesting and challenging
works and forfeited the op-
portunity to see an impressive
array of brass mutes which
ranged from a plumber’s friend
to a tuba mute that was so large
it reminded one of a footstool.‘
The concert opened with an
anonymous sonata from “Die
Bankelsanerlieder" (“Bench-
Singers Songs”). The Bench

minimum, so that what finally
comes out will represent our best
and most sensible efforts. From
time to time, between now and
May, I hope to be able to give
you progress reports, by letter
or general meeting, or perhaps
by both,

musicians who were probably the
German counterpart of the
French truubadoursl In this
rather brief and lively piece, the
quintet exhibited the skills and
musical sensitivity that pervaded
every work they performed that
evening. Their intonation was
superb, their lone robust, their
runs even and they even played
soitlyl The latter comment had
no sarcastic intent; it is just mat
amateur musicians perpetuate
the myth that it is impossible to
play a brass instrument at a
softer dynamic level than mezzo
forte. The New York Brass
Quintet destroyed that myth
widlin the first few measures of
the first work. It was indeed a
joyful discovery.

The first half of the program
remained within the baroque
tradition with the exception of the

Works.“Qu t in B-flat minor.
“Opus 5” by Victor Ewald was
perhaps the least famous work
performed. it was written by
an obscure Russian composer
and represents one of the few
nineteenth century compositions
in the brass chamber mustc
repertoire. Even though it was
described in the program notes
as having some musical value,
I found it to be much less exciting
and interesting than the other
works. It was romantic to the
point of almost being corny 7
