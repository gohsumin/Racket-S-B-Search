Wyly’s Collegium Presents Renaissance Music

Herrick Chapel was once again
filled with sounds of Renaissance
music last Friday evening when
Grinnell's Collegium Musicum
presented its ﬁrst concert at the
semester This Renaissance
concert did not attract the crowd
that David Harris, the lutenist,
did, and [or understandable
reasons: the masses do not love
a dilellante and Grinnell music
organizations are full of them.
I am by no means belittling all
those amateur musicians who
keep the Grlnnell music depart
meiit in existence and who put
in one helluva lot of hours for
every concert in which they
perrorm. But i do believe that
there are a number oi things that
could be done to make their
pertormances appear livelier and
more professional,

The guiding principle or the
Collegium Musicum is an admirv
able one. The majority of their
concerts represent experiments
in the reconstruction of 16th or
17th century sonorities. That is
to say, they attempt to use
combinations of instruments and
voices which most closely resems
ble those that were popular when
the music was written. The
opening and closing works on the
program most vividly demon-
strate what I am trying to say.
In ”Laudate Dominum” by Ciao
dict Merulo the instrumentation
included a soprano soloist, a re-
corder quartet, a vocal quartet,
one Violin and viola, two trom-
bones, one lute, and harpsichord
and cello continue. To the twenr
tieth-century concert-goer
this seems like an odd congloms
erate of instruments, and one can
hardly imagine the five Vocalists
being heard at all, Similar in-
strumentation was used in
Giovanni Gabrieli‘s “Magnificat
Anima Mea.” However, in this
polychoral work the vocalists and
recorder quartet remained up
trout and on opposite sides oi the
stage and the strings and winds
were put further back and
directly in lront oi the altar, in
short, the choice and arrange
ment of instruments and voices
is an important part oi recon-
structing 16th century sonorities.

Thisrtypie oi experimentation
does, nonetheless, present some

problems for the amateur
musician. A polychoral piece
leaves small groups or instru»
ments and voices dangerously
isolated from each other,‘ and
every part is transparent. Ina
tonation and ensemble visibly
suffered in both the Merulo and
Gabrieliworks.

The concert also included
several Montcvcrdi madrigals,
These were presented by the six
vocalists ol the Collegium an
companied by Prolcssor James
Wyly on the harpsichord, Al
though thcir intonation problems
were somewhat disturbing, l
consider a spiritless rendition the
grcater transgression. Madrigals
can be iun to sing and just as
much run to listen to, yet except
for a few moments, I felt as
though the Singers were dragging
themselves through the pieces
and not relaxing enough to give
Monteverdi a chance. At the risk
oi being redundant, I must make
similar comments about the
instrumental groups that played
tour canzonl by Frescobaldi.
Pitch. ensemble and style lelt
much to be desired.

Floyd Slotterback's per-
formance of “Five Songs" by
John Dowland was definitely the
highlighter the program. Accoms
panied by Timi Townsend on the
lute. Floyd successiully captured
thc spirit oi each song. His in-
tonation and tone are consistently
good, and he is to be applauded
iorhisstage poise.

Perhaps making comments
about stage presence is going to
make the appear all the more
stuiisshirtcd and bourgeois, but
there is something that really
disturbs me about musicians who
do not know how to react to ap-
plause. Too many Grinnellians
shuttle their lect and look
anywhere but at the audience.
You would think they were ems
barrassed to be there, Grinnell
musictalls! enjoy, enjoy! Per-
torinances would pick up considv
crably it you relaxed a bit more,
looked as though you were having
a good time, and let the audience
know that you had heard them
applauding. Music is a joyiul
thing, and it IS your responsibility
to communicate that to those who
come to listen to you.

Uncle Sam's Club Makes Appeal
For Help From Grinnell Students

Uncle Sam’s Club, a
recreational youth center in
Grinneli, is in desperate need oi
college help. The club has a
program which provides ac-
tivities {or children and youth
irom iour years old through high
school age. College volunteers
are badly needed, usually one
afternoon or evening a week, to
help supervise and stimulate
activities.

William Roecker, Assoc.
Professor of German, who was
recently elected to the club’s 15
member executive board, ex~
pressed concern over the lack oi
interest by college students this
spring, Mr, Roecker said‘ “In
years past we have had as many
as so or so students participate,
But this semester there are only
7 students coming irom the
college.”

The club was founded in 1901
by a group oi Grinnell students
who wished to contribute to the

Crosby, a Grinnell student who
spearheaded the club’s program
during the 1940’s and affection
ately known as “Uncle Sam", is

tion,

Uncle Sam's Club is located in
a homelike structure in Grin-
nell’s southwest side, about a
mile lrom the college, The club
has a full time director, Mrs.
Robert Thomazin, who has been
assoClated with it {or over 30
years,

New equipment in the form of
tumbling mats, additional
games, and boxing gloves, have
been purchased Cooking

Halftime festivities will include

assassination of especially se-

the Grinnell College Pep Band
playing selections of martial
music from The Battle of Algiers.

Noted Mathematician
