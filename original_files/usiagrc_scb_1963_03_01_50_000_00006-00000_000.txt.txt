tlor Field of Political Reporting

Political reporting is an ex-
panding field. This was thEZ

point by declaring. "Don't wore
r-y about mechanical procedures.

Judgment of [our Iowa political
’icporters who were on campus
last Tuesday afternoon for a
cottee hour wtth members or
Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sig-
ma Pm and tor a panel discus
sion in the Arena Theatre

Clitf Millen. editorial writer
for the Des Moines Register and
Tribune, opened the coffee hour
discussion by noting that there}
ale now about 20 repoiteis cov-t
cring the iotva legislature. “Asl
goveillment glows larger,“ Mill, '
en stiesseot -moie people are
needed to report it."

When the question of back
giound for political rcpoitingl

the states laws and politicalt
background. In addition, getting!
along with the politicians is of
utmost importance

Frank Nye Associate editor of
the Cedai Rapids Gazette agiﬁeed
with Millcn and tuither trigedl
that the iepor-tci have curiosity
and inteiest. l

William Spiccr of United Press
International was asked about
the adVisability of a jot dlism-
school education for political re-y
porting. He admitled that he
had graduated from such

had had a liberal education,

What you should learn is the
ability to think on your feet."

The first question that arose
during the panel discussion con—
cerned the journalist's duty to
steer clear of sensationalism.
Millen fielded this question by
Claiming that the reporter cant
ignore the human side of stor-
ies. An article would lose its
interest if it repoitcd only the
wording of bills and the even-
tual vote

”Should the repeitei ol politi—

the
news

another question put to
panel All agiced that
should be unbiased but that
occasional delinition of terms
and background material is
needed [or the readei to be able

opinions should be isolated on
the editorial page.

The problem of censorship
was deemed vital by the panel.
Millen observed that many pa—
peis accepted censorship during
World War II. He continued,
”This country is now involved
in a Cold War. it is a war in
one sense, but there are no war—
