Murphy Feels Enrollment Jump
Would Spread Grinnell Too Thin

To the: Editor:

This letter is in response to the
administration's recent announce
ment that enrollment at Grinnell
will be expanded by approximately
150 students as soon as new dor-
mitory space can be provided. The
proposed enrollment increase
seems to me unjustified and un-
wisc tor the tollowing reasons:

First, and most obviously, the ex-
pansion could lead to an unfortu-
nate overcrowding of union. -
brury, and auditorium faCili as.

Second, due to a relatively un~
do ized iullsiime teaching staii,
many classes at Grinnell are un-
desirably large. An increase in
enrollment without substantial ad-
ditions to the faculty can only re»
suit in the deterioration oi an al-
ready unsatisiactory situation.

Third. the proposed enrollment
increase is completely unjustiiied
iroin a standpoint oi easing ad~
missions pressures. At present the
college accepts tor admission he-
tueen one hali and two thirds oi
those students who apply; the pro.
per course for Grinnell would
seem to lie in the direction or
attracting more outstanding ap-
plicants, not in accepting a higher
proportion of the inadequate num-
ber oi students who are now ap-
plying,

Fourth, enrollment increases are
lilV their nature irrevocable. while
i is
Liberal Arts exams, revise curricu-
la and alter calendars, a new dor-
mitory, once completed, has to he

filled, To commit Grinneil to a-

possible to abolish Junior-

 

nccessarily permanent enrollment
increase at a time when we are
without a president may restrict
unduly our new president's tree
doin to pursue policies he ieels in
the best interests or the college.
in sum, I am suggesting that a
policy oi expanding enrollment
could prevent Grinnell irom
achieving what has thus tar prov.
en to be the highly elusive goal
ot academic excellence. In view oi
this tact, I otter the tollowing
proposal tor consideration by the
administration:

i. Present plans to increase en»

rolinient to be abandoned.

ii. Funds that are now intend-
ed ior the construction oi a
new women’s dormitory be die
rected instead to the pro~
curement of additional iacul.
ty members.

The preceding arguments and!

proposal are based on the conten-
tion that providing an excellent ed—
ucation ior 1,150 students is more

important than providing a good,

education for 1,300 students. 1
sincerely hope the administration
will reply publicly to this letter,
stating explicitly why a policy of
increasing enrollment is more pru~

dent than the proposal outlined

above.
