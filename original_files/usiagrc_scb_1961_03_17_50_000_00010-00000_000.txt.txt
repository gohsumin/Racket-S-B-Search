Grinncll has had a poor-
wrestling season by the books,
This year’s varsity mat team
could bring home only the scalps
of Knox and Coe in dual meet
competition and a ninth place
ir. the Conference meet.

But, looking at the season
meet by meet and noting indi-
vidual progress it would be uri—
fair to let the “poor” rating ap-
ply to anything more than sta—
tistics.

At least two men would have
been welcome in the best of
wrestling circles. Dick Harris,
l‘llnnel‘rup at lslepounds last
year as a sophomore in the con.
ference meet, returned this
year to terrorize his opponents
throughout the season. He racked
up eight wins against one loss, a

to the top division of Midwest
conference wrestling.

While failing to win a meet
this year, the yearlings picked
up enough experience, according
to Coach Edd Bowers, to make

them potenlial troublemakers on;

the mats next season.

Jon Larson and Al McKnight,
at 157 and 147 pounds fresh
co-captains, hulwarked the young
mat crew. Larson Carded a 1-1-1

and droupcd one.

‘Carl Rattner, rugged little 137.

season. David Scott, wrestling at

Bill Patton, captain of the
Grinnell w estlers, piled up a
7 4 1 record in the 130 pound di—
v ion. He wrestled in every
Pioneer- meet and faced morc'
opponents than anyone else or
the squad. An ankle injury ham—
pered his attempts in the latter
part of the season but he finish

The Grinnell Herald—Register
described the Pioneer freshman
swimming team as the "hottest
thing to hit Grinnell since the
great tire of 1889." This may
have been a slight exaggcration,
but only a slight one, for the
frosh went through their season
undefeated and set new confer.

many cases they smashed Grin-
