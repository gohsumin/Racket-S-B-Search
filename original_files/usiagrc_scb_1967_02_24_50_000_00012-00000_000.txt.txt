"0n the Right Track"

By Barry Ancone

The basement of the women's
gym is small, dank and poorly
lighted. It is also the home of
Grinnell's indoor track team.

Nine men, under the coach-
Ing of Gene Kowert, comprise
the team, the smallest in years.
Most of the nine are middle-and
long-distance runners, leaving
sprints, hurdles and field events
harely touched by the Pioneers.
The coach expects to pick up
some hurdlers and sprinters
tram the basketball team, but
this will give an outdoor squad
of only about ﬁfteen.

Where are the track men?
The coach feels he has almost
every good upperclassman run-
ning. The college just isn’t get-
ting track men, or very many
athletes at all, for that matter.

"Athletics is down here,"

Coach Kowert observed “and
probably our only winning
teams next year will be swim-
ming and -wrestling.” The
coach hestitated to assign
blame for the decrease in inter
collegiate participation, but
felt that the current Admissions
Office attitude toward athletics
was somewhat responsible.
“They bring in a group of
freshmen and expect to find a
cross - section of high school
graduates, with a proportionate
number of athletes.” Within the
recruiting rules of the Midwest
Conference, Kowert felt that
more could and should be done
to secure the “scholar-athlete."
“The new fieldhouse would be
a good drawing card,” he add-
ed, "College track meets would
make the atmosphere here
more desirable for high school
students considering Grinnell
and high school meets would

introduce many students to us."

The present track cannot be
used for meets, and its hard
surface and potholes make it
dangerous. The team ran with,
or rather behind, Iowa and
Northeast Missouri State at a
meet Feb. 11 at Iowa City. It
was excellent practice running
on a good track, and Ric Mac-
Dowell turned in 1257.8 in the
hali~mile, llis fastest time.

There is an interest in inter-
collegiate athletics at Grinnell,
but it waxes and wanes with
the success of its teams. Ath-
letics is, and should be, a part
of Grinnell life. It is unfortunate
that present circumstances have
placed it in such a poor position.
Consideration of a new field-
house and a more realistic ad-
missions policy are not the
only solutions to the problems.
but they are certainly on the
right track.

Maimen Win
Saturday Match

The Grinnell wrestlers upset
a strong team from Monmouth
College 21-19 Saturday in Darby
Gym. The victory was not as-
sured until the last second of
the final match.

Mike Martinson, 115, won a
5-0 decision; Roger Claw, 123,
was pinned in 3:30; and Grin-
nell forfeited the 130 class. This
put the Monmouth Scots ahead
1073.

John Loventhal, 137, fought
his opponent to a,6—6 tie. and
John Sharpe went unchallenged
at 145. Bob Van Wyck won u
6—0 decision to put the Pioneers
on top 13—12.

Randy Stare lengthened the
lead, winning 5-2 at 160. The 161
match, feared to be a forfeit by
Grinnell, turned out to be a “no
contest." Don Kraitsik, moving
up to 177 for this week’s meet,
came close to a pin several
times and won M, putting the
team scores at 1912.

The heavyweight class was a
forfeit by Grinnell due to Bob
Geller's move down to 191, so
the score entering the final
match was 19-17. A three point
decision would have been
enough for a Monmouth vic-
tory, but Geller came from be-
hind to tie his match at 2»2 and

' lend Grlnnell to victory.

In f r e s h m a n exhibition
matches, Dave Jaeger, lis, won
t 16—0 decision, and Bill Wed-
ding won 4-2 at 177. Bob La-
Bell, 160, dropped 2‘13. Bob Jen-
kins, wrestling MollmDuth’s var-
sity 130 man, pinned him at
2:40!

The grapplers did not fare as
well against Cornell Monday.
The freshmen were defeated
2979. and the varsity shared
their fate, losing 3043.

The resignation of the Pioneer
varsity’s no man adds another
gap to the thinning teani. The
wrestlers take on Carleton and
St. Olaf tomorrow at Northlleld.

[age Will, Lose Two

By Barry Ancona

The Pioneer basketball team
stopped their losing streak at
22 by beating Coe 5245 last Fri.
day at Cedar Rapids. The long-
awaited victory was witnessed
by five Grinnell students.

The Pioneers played an eX<
cellent game, and led through
out. They were up 4246 at the
half. The team played heads-up
ball, giving up only two turn-
overs and hitting most of their
free throws. Rebounding: , rk-
ed by Thor Evenson, nclped
keep Grinnell on top all the
way.

The Pioneers ran a successful
stall for the last three minutes
of the game, something they
have rare occasion to do. The
scoring: Schwartz, la; Evenson,
13; Wlngata, 12; Hill and Able,
10; Lower, 93 Hibhs, ﬂ; Rankin,
4.
The team's effort against Be
loit the next day was less effec-
tive. The Pioneers lost 7354. No
Grinnellian scored more than
oightpoints.

The Pioneers hosted Mon-
mouth niesday and the Scots
were victorious 87-71. The first
team started'but was replaced
as the first period wore on. The
Pioneers trailed by only iour
points at the half.

The defeat came in the first
few minutes of the second half,
as Monmouth rolled up a '
teen-point lead. The scoring:
Evenson, 16; Hill, ; Able arid
Hibbs, 8; .Schwartz. 7; Brintnall
and Wingate, a; Lower, 5; Watt
and Musser, 2..

, Schwartz and Hlbbs dropped
to seventh and eighth in confer-

ence scoring after Tuesday’s
game.

The team travels in Northfield
this weekend to take on strong
teams at Carleton and St. Olaf.
A home game against Coe next
Friday should give Grinnell tans
a chance to see a Pioneer vio-
tory. A big turnout would look
good in Darby, and we should
be rewarded with a win.

Swimmers Win
Triangular

The Grinnell swimming team
was victorious over Coo and
Knox last Saturday in the Grin-
nell pool, Final snort of tho
triangular meet was Grinneil
73, Knox 59, C09 22,

Bill Lontz captured two first:
and Rich Lance and Ken Adel-
man each won single events.
The medley relay team also
won,

The freshmen swam exhibi-
tion in both relays, and broke
conference records in both. The
team of Warn-ran, Siekzrt, Wil-
iiams, and Pedersen broke the
old iooyard medley relay mark
with a time of 4107.5. The old
mark was 4:08]. The AUG-yard
ireestyle relay oi McElain,
Pedersen, Schaalman, and
Warman eclipsed the old record
by five seconds with a time of
3:38.

The Pioneers swim at home
again this weekend taking on
two strong teams: Lawrence to-
day at 4 pm, and Eeloit to<
morrow at 1 pm. These should
be fine meets to watch,

“Is this what everyone wants
to play?" With this query, play.
er-coach Betsy James sent her
James Hall purehearts out to
tackle Mears in the battle of the
titans, Going into this contest,
James led the league With a 3—0
mark while Mears was 24].

Betsy James and Cindy Root
jumped center and with the tip,
the last semblance of sanity and
organization passed. The first
five minutes of the game was
highlighted by seven jump
balls. four fouls and no points.

By the end of the first quar-
ter, Mears had jumped out to a
7:0 lead in a fantastic some‘
thing or other shot by “Red"
Railsback. The second quarter
brought disaster to James as
Betsy James went to the side.
lines with a sprained ankle.
With this, James lost their best
player. Cindy Root scored and
Marsha Drake made the first of
her free throws and the halftime
score was 4-1.

The last halt was equally ex-
citing as Marie Wong got four
points to pace Meal-s while
James could only cash in on an-
other oi Marsha Drake's soft
free throws. The final score was
10-2 and the victory catapulted
Mears into first place, James
dropped to second and Main
held third with a 2-1 mark.

For those interested, there is
an all—star game Saturday, Feb

ruary 25 at 1:00. For the uninili.
sited, this is a spectacle worth
seeing. i think the type of game
you will see can best be ex-
pressed by the remark of one of
the Mears girls made late in the
game, “Pass it to her, she's in
the end zone."

Returning to the mundane
world of North Campus bas<
ketball, Clark continued to show
late season improvement as
they beat co—leader Smith twice.
The “A” team, led by Bill Lee:
30 points beat Smith “A" by
nine while Sam Cartell’s free
throw with 8 seconds leit in the
game gave Clark “B" a one
point victory.

Dibble solidified its hold on
first by tossing West its fifth
and sixth losses of the season.
South “A" confounded the ex.
perts by winning a game. thul
leaving only Cowles and Gate:
“B" squads without a triumph.
That stalemate will end this
week although it is possible that
both teams will lose. The ac-
companying statistics are not
quite as interesting as those
displayed in the girls’ basket.
ball game but at least they are
accurate (t h r o u g h February
15).

The intra—college bo w l i n g
league tightened up as only five
games separate the iirst and
last place teams. Dave John~
sun’s 217 and Bill Gray’s 213
were the highlights of last
week’s kegling.
