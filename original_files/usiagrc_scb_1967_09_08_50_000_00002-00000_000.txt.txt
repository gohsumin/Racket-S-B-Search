MAKING YOUR SCENE

in his remarks at Convocation Monday, Peter Hackes spoke
of the technological growth that has occurred since his undergrad-
uate days, and predicted the trend of further growth to the year
1000. None of us would deny the great changes that science has
made in our world, nor fhe importance of continued scientific en-
deavors.

it was unfortunate, however, that Mr. Hackes digressed from
his catalog of the good things in life to comment on “the gang
that turns itself on.” He is as sure that his world of technology
is the scene to make as he is afraid the hippies believe theirs’
is the only way.

We are certainly not reassured about room for spiritual and
social growth in the world when the hippies are described as
working for love only by “lying back on (their) long hair and
dreaming," and when earning a degree from Grinnell helps
guarantee its owner “a placid life and a sensational career.”

We hope that Mr. Hacites does not believe that all hippies
are lazy because they don’t want to work hard to earn a placid
life. Their effons in many other directions point up their willing-
ness to work. Each person has his own indiVldual scene to make,
and if he denies it, he denies his individuality.

Technological growth is a man-made blessing of our age, but
spiritual and SOCIal growth must also Come from men. The lalter
must accompany the former if We are to ﬁnd any satisfaction in
our scientific paradise.

THE GRINNELL MAGAZlNE

We are pleased to hear about Dean Thompson’s new Grinnell
Magazine. The plan to enlarge the size and expand the content of
the old Alumni Scarlet 8r Black is well thought out.

Through this new medium, Grinnell alumni and friends will be
able to see the best in news, creative writing and photography
from the campus. Their enjoyment will not be disturbed by irre-
sponsible editors, or crank writers, or other detractors from the
true Grinnell picture. And of course, the magazine will continue
to publish true stories about the college while Student publications
wallow in evil, deceit, and corruption

Grinnell students will surely Want to see What their college il
really like, and the magazine should oblige them

One suggestion: Why not include favorite campus jokes, vo—
cabulary tests, first person stories ot heroism and arlicles by
conservative alumni and call it Grinneliians’ Digest,

THE LONELINESS OF THE
IONG DTSTANT STllDENT

Paul Jones

One of tile most prevalent attitudes or philosophies among
creative people at Grinnell is that which I chose to call ‘alones
ness’. This is not the same as trying to be an individual, or 'lden—
tity crises’, or apathy, or any of the other longtime maladies with‘
which Grinnell Supposedly has been plagued But, on the other
hand, it is perhaps the basis or one of the prime bases of some of
these nominal problems.

This is not to deny that there are virtues to being alone with
yourself and indulging in introspection at times, but carried to
extremes, as in anything, it becomes an evil which by far oute
weighs its virtues. To hear people complain about having no-ono
to 'talk to’, to hear them say that there is nothing to do here, is
one indication of this. But a much greater and more important
indication is the pretty much total unwillingness of many people
— students and faculty alike —— to express what they as individu-
als feel or Lhink. There are plenty of ‘sincere’ people on this
campus, but it is hard to prove this by public example.

I for one elm convinced that there are a majority of people
at Grinnell who have deep and important feelings to recognize
and, if ever expressed, thoughts that would probably approach
the limils of proiundity.

Why, then, is this the case? Is it because there is not a will~
ingness to express? I don’t think that this is the case at all. It is
more a fear- to express. There is the fear to allow yourself to be
placed in a position to be criticize ‘ mean criticized in the sense
of judged or measured, not or zed in the sense of being
walkedon. To fear being walked-on is a legitimate fear, but un-
fortunately one engendered by the former sense of ‘tn be criti-
cized'. That is, most of the ‘judgment’ that takes place is a do
structive type that forces most people to conclude that to be
placed in tiny position of criticism, outside of the classroom, iii
dangerous and to be feared.

What does ail of this have to do wilh ‘aloneness’ that I men-
tioned before? Perhaps this attitude of aloneness is only a ration.
alizallon for the fear of criticism or judgment, and the unfortu-
nate result is that creativity becomes a private affair.

When this happens, a college campus becomes a sterile and
quiet place. it is untortunate that Grinnell has assumed this
atmosphere,
