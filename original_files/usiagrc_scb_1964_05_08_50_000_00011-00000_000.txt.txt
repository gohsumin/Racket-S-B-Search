Meet Knox, Monmouth

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell's diamondmen take
to the road again this weekend
as they journey to Illinois in an
attempt to get back in me win
column and sidetrack the pen-
nant hopes of the Knox Siwash.
The Pfitschrnen tangle with
Knox today and move on to
Monmouth for a doubleheader
tomorrow.

After a little over a week of
inactivity due to inclement
weather, the Pioneers took on
Coe Tuesday in a single game
at Cedar Rapids, Taking it on
the chin for the fourth straight
time, the Scarlet lost 5-1 and
are now virtually out of the
running for either of the top
two spots in the MCAC South-
em Division.

Against Coe, however, the
Grinnell hitters finally broke
out of a serious slump and.
banged out eight hits, one
more than the Kohawks, in-
cluding two doubles and a
triple. Cal Collier and John
Shierholz each chipped in a
pair of hits and accounted for
all the Scarlets' extrarbase
cloutst The only run for the
Pioneers came in the eighth on
two base hits and an error by
Coe on an attempted double
play. Denny Hanssen, who
worked the first seven innings,
took the loss. Reliefer Barry
Anderson worked the last two
frames for Grinnell.

Commenting on the game,
mentor John Piitsch said, “I
was very pleased with the bat»
ting in the Coe contest, but we
couldn't put together more than
two hits in any one inning.
We’ll have to do better than
that if we’re going to win this
weekend. Pfitsch noted that at
various times during the sea
son the Pioneers have dis-
played fine pitching and hitting
but can never synchronize the
two for any one game.

The Scarlet Will have to do
just that, however, if they want
to stop Knox today. The Purple
and Gold are riding the top
spot in the division right now
and boast an Eel conference
mark. Siwash coach Harlan:
Knosher will probably throwi

 

Doug Ziech at the Pioneers in
the game today. Ziech pitched
both ends of a twin bill here
two weeks ago and held Grin—
hell to just one run. Knosher
can also count on Marty Pschir-
rer, Tom Wingader and George
Shea to spark the hitting attack.

In the doubleheader tomor-
row the Scarlet will be fighting
it out widi Monmouth for third
place The Scots hold down a
3-6 record right now as com-
pared to Grinnelrs 3-5. Denny
Elliott and Harold Wertich, the
aces of the Scots' staff, will
most likely work Saturday’s
games. Wertich, in adition to
his 16 inning stint against Grin-
nell on April 24, is also the
leading hitter ior Monmouth
and backing him up at the plate
are Don Moore and Jerry
Young.

Pfitsch plans to start the
same lineup he’s used all sea»
son, with Steve Tilly on the
mound against Knox and Hans—
sen and Anderson to go tomorr
row.

SCARLET AND BLACK
E ’

By DAB LITTLE

The maiden form made its first appearance on the
Grinnell tennis courts April 29, in a Midwest Conference
intercollegiate contesteand this time it was legal.

Nancy McClane, 18, a Cornell freshman, played in the
number four position in the Grinnell—Cornell freshman match
and was narrowly defeated by Grinnell‘s Tim Dailey, 7v5, 3-6,
64.

The road to Nancy’s participation in that 'match could
probably be traced back through generations of female cxs
clusion from intercollegiate competition. in fact the issue
has come up more than once in the history of the Midwest
Conference,

However, the fact that Nancy played last week, and that
any female can now compete in Midwest Conference inter»
collegiate athletics, stems most recently and directly from
the furor caused one year ago by a quiet, attractive, unassum-
ing Grinnell coed named Julie Litchfield.

Julie Litchfield is a golfer—and a darn good one. She
came to Grinnell in 1963 sporting thre’e Des Moines Junior
Girls’ Golf Championships and four years of high school
girls’ golf team participation. She tried out for Grinnell’s
freshman squad and made it.

Julie played in the first match against Cornell and
whitewashed her opponent, She became the first woman ever
to participate on a Grinnell athletic team, but—her first ap~
pearance was also her last. ,

At the spring '63 meeting of the Conference Athletic
Directors it was decided that Julie was ineligible for partici
pation on the basis of a “males only” rule in the Conference
“Conduct for Sports” and an amendment to the conference
constitution was proposed that would read “all competition
in the Midwest Conference shall be limited to male athletes
only.” If passed this amendment would end all dispute—and
all female participation.

The proposed amendment was presented al the fall
meeting of faculty representatives from the ten conference
schools for ratification The amendment needed seven of the
ten votes to pass. The voting went four in favor, four against
and two abstentions. The abstentions counted as votes against
and the amendment was defeated,

Since the amendment was not ratified, Midwest Confer-
ence Commissioner Robert Ashley, Dean of Ripon College,
felt that it was the opinion of the majority of the confeience
that women ought to be allowed to compete in intercollegiate
athletic events. He overruled the “Conduct for Sports" rule
and ruled in favor of female participation.

Of course this ruling does not end the dispute. There are
many problems involved in female athletic participation and
the issue will come up for debate again and again. For the
moment, however, the women are in.

Cornell has a tennis player and Beloit has a golfer:
Grinnell has ...... Julie, come back ! ! l I

Golfers face Two
in Quest Of 2nd
Perfect Dual Meet

Two m e e t s, 7 Wednesday
against Cornell and Saturday
with Beloit, stand between
Grinnell College’s golf team
and its second straight unde«
feated dual season. Both meets
are on the road.

Currently the winning skein
hung up by Coach Larry Crew.
ford’s young team stands at 13
and stretches back into the 1962
season. Last year, the Grinnel-
Iians Were 1070.

Now the race is on for the
No. l spot on the team as Dave
Sellergren, the early leader,
appears to\have found his game
again and is ready to make I
run at Ted Risser.

Risser has been the surprise
of the team thus far with hil
fine play. Continuing to im-
prove his short game, he has
the best average for the year,
and is still holding against Sei-
lergren’s challenges,

Taking over the third spot is
Russ Harden, who started the
year one notch lower, but since
then has come along fast to be
one of the most Consistent of
the lot.

Following this pair oi‘meets.
it Will be Midwest Conference
tournament time, when the
Grinnellians try to unseat
Knox as the loops champion.
