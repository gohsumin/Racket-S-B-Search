Lawrence Examines Three Concepts of lime

By siizie Gelbcr

Nathaniel Lawrence of Williams College opened
the annual Gates Memorial Lecture series at 7:30 pm
last Sunday in Hcrrich chapcl, pledging "incisive and
provocative" subicct treatment. Dealing with ,“Au
Anatomy oi Time: Cons iousness and Time," the phi-
losopher dcdicatcd his lccturcs to Paul Spencer Wood,
latc prolessor or English at Crinnell.

In a comment on the incoherence and ”uncx'dmmed
pet’suppositions” characterizing the usual human coir
ccption oi time, Dr. Lawrence noted that time dcrivcs
mcariiiiclulness only from experience and “thcrcloro,
there is no such thing as acttlal, abstract, empty timc,”

Contradicting the ”presupposition of ‘oue time',"
the lecturer stated that tcniporality is not a single
“current oi passage” hilt two or more; time itself
iiiiictions as an abstraction of temporallty.

“Each component or complement ol consciousness
has its 0\ n individuality, which is intrinsically rev
lational . . . Consciousness prevades the verbal mean-
ing and conception or time," declared the protessor
in examining the concept of “multiple tampornlllies,"

While on the topic or consciousness, 13-. Lawrence
explained that ”in analysis, it is most important to
consider what consciousness rcicrs to, since cone
sciousness is inherently vectoral," Lawrence listed
sell-consciousness, recognition of “its own past; pel‘~
ceptual consciousness. awareness or the perceived
world; and communicative consciousness, awareness of
"other minds” as three mayor components or con—
sciousiiess.

The tact that “there is a dciinite human urge to
be in conscious community with other consciousness"
caused Dr. Lawrence to raise a question as to
whether consciousness is merely "the conilucnce of
the consciousness of external tactors."

Negating determinism, Dr. Lawrence quoted Sartrc
(”existence precedes essence") in discussion of the
question of self-consciousness: Who am I? with a
brief mention of Buddhist doctrine (“as a man's deeds
are, so the man becomes"), Dr. Lawrence included
poetry, love, and psychoanalysis as man's methods
or determining an answer to the question of extstcncc,

In "The Shape of Time,“ the second Gates Loco
ture last Monday in Hel‘l‘lck Chapel, Nathaniel Lau-
awrcnce compared Greek, early Chr ~tian and later
Christian views or time as represented in the u rigs
oi Plato, St, Augustine, Newton and several post-
Newtonian philosophers, respectively.

Generally, thc "shape” or Greek time is a circle,
at early Christian time a line, and ol later Chrl ion
a spiral, Lawrence said,

Although the‘sc “shapes" dilter, “all the theories
implicity or lellcily refer to creativity." Lawrence
cmphasiccd.

plato derived his idea oi time trom the circular,
constantly recurring motion or the heavcnly bodies
He believed that when a man died, his soul He
turned to earth later in another torm; thus lite was
cyclical.

Early Christian time is linear Its beginning is
God's creation, its end God's judgment

St. Augustine inocliiied the Creek concept oi time
as concrete and visible, making it abstract and con—
tained within the mind or soul. “Time is what the
individual retains trom the passage oi events . . . , and
creativity may be lound in this arresting ot lune,"
Lawrencc said of Augustine,

Lau-renec called Newton’s concept ot pure and
empty trmc continuously engaged in perpetuating it.
sclt lrom its o n nature “Newton's Miracle,"

“Although this concept is devoid oi content and
inexplicable. crcativity, sclf—cleativlty, is a part of it,"
Lawrence temai'ked,

Ilc pointed out sciontis. who rollorved Newton's
‘idca that only time could create itsclt rverc lorecd
to investigate the causes of things, rejecting the
notion oi spontaneous creativity.

Lilsc Plato. Hegel saw temporal creativity as the
result ol a “objective lite force," but he saw the events
within the pattern as nonrecurrcnt. Lawrence desigv
lnatcs the shape of his time, theretorc, as a spiral.

Lawrence ended his lecture by questioning the
validity of the implications of its title By thinking
of the various concepts of time in terms one may
make temporality too abstract and static.
