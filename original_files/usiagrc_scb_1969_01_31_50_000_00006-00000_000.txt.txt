Rosenfield Lectures

Costly Disappointment

By RON SIEINIIORN

One thousand dollars was the prlco
paid to Rosenl‘leld lecturer Glen 11 Sea-
borg for two disappointing lecturer.
Though his stated purpose was to Show
the relationship oi atomic energy to
the International situation, Seaborg only
obliquely covered this topic.

Wednesday nighl‘l lecture was an
enumerstiou at post accomplishments
OI the AEC DI which Seaborg I! Chair‘-
mon. International Atomic Energy Corn-
rnission, the possible peaceful uses of
atomic pow”, and fixture applications
of atomic power. Impressive as these
achievements are, anyone could find
them in an encyclopedia. It this was
not being condescending enough, his al<
tilillie toward the Soviet nuclear scien-
tisls at a first meeting with them in
1955 was condescending, He was amazed
to find they were “real people very
much like ourselves.” While the drama
oi the cﬂnlerences must have been real.
Seaborg failed to mention the opposition
to this conference Within the U,S.. as
well as our desperate efforts tn create
a nuclear superiority over the Russians
at the time. He further disregarded
U.S actions when he explained why the
U. r-Soviet agreement oi 1968 to ex-
change scientific intormation was not
approved by the (1.5., because “oi
course, the tragedy of the Czechoslo-
vakian invasion" made it Impossible.
He iorgot about v.5. involvement in
Vietnam which tho Russians saw ﬁt to
ignore in 1904 when they implemented
a similar agreement with us.

The second lecture was saved from
being such a complete disaster by at
least being relevant. Seaborg dealt with
the Nuclear Non-Proliiemtioin treaty, in-
ternational checks, and the ability of the
highly industrial nations to produce
nuclear weapons now and in the
near nlture. He was at his best
when he was able to bring his tech-
nical, rather than administrative point
of View to hear on these questions. but
tailed too often to bring across this point
0! view.

What he did not say was most reveal~
lug. He spoke about Us. precautions in
the prevention of use of radioactive
iuels for weapons when sold to other

countries. but did not indicate tllat the
[1.5. was going to stop making nuclear
weapons. Also unexplained was US. aid
in the use of nuclear explosives to build
a harbor in Australia, and die lack of
(1.5. relations with the nuclear power.
Red China.

Perhaps having a big name speaker
like Seaborg was a good thing for col-
lege publicity, but for the audience ho
was highly unsatisfactory. The choice at
I scientist I! not objectionable, but Sea-
borg's limited treatment or such an im-
portant topic was disappointing.
