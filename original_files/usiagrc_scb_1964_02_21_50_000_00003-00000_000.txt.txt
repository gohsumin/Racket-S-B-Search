Miscellany and Digression l

“Student government must
reorganize itself drastically. It
must no longer care whether
or not it is graced with admin-
istration sanction and legit-
imacy.” With these words
which appeared in a dittoed
statement distributed lastgweek
and signed “Publius,” the
source of tlte‘problems of the
Grim-tell College community
could be seen.

For in the statement by Pub-
lius is the type of reasoning
which has created the prob-
lems which are manifest on the
Grinnell campus. The thoughts
of Publius, whoever he, she or
they may be, are the product of
a selflisl‘l, unrealistic, and to-
tally irresponsible philosophy
which has developed on the
Grinnell campus.

Behind this philosophy seems
to lie a belief in some sort of
divine right of students. Free-
dom and the sanctity of the in-
diVldual appear to be corner-
stones of this philosophy. But
missing is any conception the
regulations and responsi ties
which must be present in any
society to insure freedom and
sanctity of the individual for
everybody.

This philosophy assumes that
the students possess the defini-
tive knowledge and judgment
concerning social beliefs and
practices. Thus, whatever the
students want, they should re-
ceive. The right of the faculty,
administration, and even the
Board of Trustees to have any
control over student regula-
tions is denied.

Perhaps Publius is right
when he says there should be
a reorganization of student
government. However, the fail-
ures of the present system are

 

not the ones he pictures. The
current problems in student
government certainly cannot be
blamed on an overemphasis on
rule enforcement.

Perhaps student government
has failed because it has been
guided by the same philosophy
which guides Publius. Perhaps
the administration views stu<
dent government with contempt
(a claim made by Publius) be-
cause student government has
viewed the administra 'on with
contempt.

Basically the process of stu-
dent government is analogous
to a game. But one cannot suc-
ceed at a game unless one un-
derstands and follows the rules
of that game.

Maybe more could be accom-
plished with a student govern-
ment which understands and
willingly observes the rules of
the game. For the rules of the
game are not going to be
changed simply to suit the
whims of a group of students
who will spend only four years
on the campus. And if those
who are attempting to destroy
the game succeed, they will
have destroyed their only road
to accomplishment.
