ASC Hears Speech
0n Testing Drugs

By Judith Wallace

Mr. Garland Reed of the
Food and Drug Administration
outlined the procedures and
problems of testing new drugs
in an address to the Grinnell
Chapter of the American Chem-
ical Society Wednesday night.

”The greatest surge" of new
’drugs has come in the past few
years, according to Mrl Reed.
,This has contributed greatly to
man’s benefit: — but has also
opened new possibilities of
harm. The increasing complex-
ity of drugs has made their
testing more difficult, he said.

The Pure Food and Drug Acts
have prohibited the adultera-
tion or mislabeling of drugs.
In 1962 the Kefauver-Harris
Amendments added the require-
ment that a drug be effective
as claimed when used as pre-
scribed, as well as safe.

With the anew application
forms, the FDA requires sub-
mission of full reports on all in-
vestigations, quantitative listing
of the drug’s components, and
full reports on methods and
controls in the manufacture and
storage of the drug. Samples
and the proposed label are also
called for.

The responsibility rests with
the drug’s makers to prove it
safe and effective to the satis—
iaction of the FDA, Inadequate
testing, lack of evidence of ef<
fectiveness and false or mis—
leading labeling are grounds
for refusing certification.

After the drug has been
marketed the FDA’s interest in
it continues. Under previous
legislation, the manufacturer
had no responsibility to save or
iorward reports of adverse ef-
fects caused by their drug.
Now, they are required to file
complete reports of further
testing and of reactions to the
drug. The FDA judges decide
whether the drug should con—
tinue without change, requires
a change in labeling, or should
be withdrawn from the mar-
ket Failure to report is suf-
ficient for the drug’s withdraw-
al,

The Kefauver amendments
also'set up an extended time
limit by which the FDA must
act on the drug Formerly, if
no action had been taken at the
end of so days. the drug was
automatically considered ap-
proved. Now the FDA must act,
although the manufacturer is
given the right to appeal their
decision to a federal court.

D e s p i t e the formidable
amount of testing required even
before a drug ls cleared for
testing on humans, it is almost
impossible to determine all of
a drug’s potential effects. Re-
actions vary widely with the

Norris \Wesident' Plays New Role,
Pioneers New Advisory Concept ‘

By Wayne Stengel

What‘s his proper title?
Would you call him a “house
father"? Certainly not. He
doesn’t bake cookies and darn
socks for the men of East and
West, and he’s much too young.
Would “hall adviser" be more
like it? Well, not exactly, you
say. That doesn‘t explain that
he lives there Well, then how
about faculty adviser? No,
that's worsei Everyone has a
faculty adviser, and only the
98 men of East and West have
Mrl David MCBlaini

David McBIain 24, of Atlan-

tic, Iowa is holding a most ’

unique position under rather
unusual circumstances, He is
the first faculty member in
Grinnell history known to re-
side permanently on North
Campus and is himself a 1962
graduate of Grinnell. Mr. MC-
Blain's role in East and West
is the beginning of a projected
plan by the administration to
have whet might best be called
“faculty residents" in each of
the halls on North Campus.
Ideally. these residents would
be younger men with several
years experience in graduate
school or industry so as to ef-
fectively advise seniors in par-
ticular, and underclassmen in
general, concerning their plans
following graduation. '

Lenox Plays Sunday

Works by Schubert and Bee-
thoven will be played by the
Lenox Quartet this Sunday at
3:30 pm. in Roberts Theater
as the second in a series of
three fall concerts. The third
will be at 8 [Lin' Friday, Oct.
30, also in Roberts Theater:

Open to the public, with no
tickets needed, the Sunday con-
cert will feature the posthu-

age of the patient, the packag~
ing of the drug, its age, and so
forth. Even rigid controls
sometimes do not prevent vari~
ations from batch to batch; two
brands of the same drug may
have different effects.
However, as Mrr Reed em-
phasized, the new regulations
are not as inhibitive as some
have feared, More potentially
harmful drugs are ”caught"
before they reach the market;
more careful and thorough
testing still opens up unexpected
possibilities for drugs

with the faculty"' said Mc-
Blain. “Where two years ago
it was Mr. and Mrs now we’re
on a first-name basis. But there
is still a certain degree of for
mality between us, probably be-
cause I was a student so re-
cently.” McBlain admitted to
knowing only a few familiar
faces among seniors who were
freshmen when he graduated.

Profs Write Book

Three members of the Eng-
lish faculty are co-authors of
a book, “A Preface to Literary
Analysis,” just: published by
Scott, Foresman and Company
Chicago, ‘

Sheldon P. Zitner, James D.
Kissane, and Myron Mr Liber-
man have, according to the
foreword of their 140 -page
book, “tried to present some
of the distinctions and skills
necessary in literary ahalysis.”

After describing the uses of
literature and its three major
kinds — lyric, narrative, and
drama — the book goes on to
discuss “close reading." appli-
cations to speciﬁc works, and
the premises of literary criti-
clsm.

_Prof, Grad Publish

James Kissane (English)
concluded a two-year term as
president of the Iowa Colleges
Conference on English at the
organization’s annual meeting
held Oct. 2-3 at Morningside
College, Sioux City.

Henry-York Steiner (English)
presented a paper, “Students
and William Blake: A Problem
in Perception." at the meeting.

“I pretty well hibernated dur-
ing my senior year. I had a
double major in physics and
math; two comprehensivee to
study for, and l was gone sev-
eral weekends looking over job
offers."

McBlain’s current job, for-
mer education at Grinnell and
youthful appearance have ai<
forded him a few amusing inci-
dents. A few weeks ago as the
forming outside
Cowles at dinner time, an irate
senior, possibly remembering
him vaguely but nontheless cone
fusing him with some illustrious
track star, demanded to know
why he had not gone out for
cross-country this year. Me
Blaln’s reply that as a mathe-
matics instructor at Grinnell he
was thoroughly ineligible was
enough to send the embar-
rassed inquisitor into the
swarming crowd.

Asked if he had found Grin-
nell adequate preparation for
graduate school, McBlain said
that the ”full content” of the
courses at Grinnell made this
true, He added he was glad to
see that his own field of en-
deavur, the math department
had expanded from three in<
structors to five in his two-year
absence.

McBlain, having experienced
several “institution food serv-
ices.” had high praise for
SAGA and like everyone else
on campus these days, had a
comment to make on the ma-
turity of the average Grinnel-

‘ lian, “They seem much less

mature than when I was a sen-
ior or even a freshman myselfr
But then I guess it’s partly a
matter of a twentyrfour-year-
old looking on seventeen-year
olds rather than seventeen year
old looking on twenty—one year
olds.

Next year it’s back to S.U.I.
for “house father" McBlain.
