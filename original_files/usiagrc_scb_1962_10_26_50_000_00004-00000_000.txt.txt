ond half and go on to win. 22.0.
The game, played at Beloit last
Saturday, was held on a ﬁeld
muddy from Friday night and
Saturday morning rain.

In the ﬁrst half Grinnell’s
powerful rushing offense bogged
down in the mud and was Con-
tained by a Beloit defensive line

considered by many to be the ,

toughest in the conference. The
Pioneers could manage only one

ﬁrst down and could press only-

to the Beloit 45 during the en-
tire first half.

The Grinnell defense was
hardly less ferocious than Be-

loit’s, allowing the Bqu’ offense".

only four ﬁrst downs and no se-
rious threats on the Grinnell
goal.

THE EARLY part of the third ‘ ,

quarter saw no change in the
outlook of the game, but with
about seven minutes left in this
period, a strong rush put on the
Beloit punter caused a fourth—
down punt to go out on the
Rue 35.

This ﬁred up the Pioneers
and they covered the distance
to the goal in only seven
plays, with Elston Bowers go.
ing over from the 1-yard line.
Bowers ran across for the two-
point conversion.

In the ﬁrst series of clowns
following the ensuing kickorf.
Grinnell’s Craig McManus pounc—
ed on a fumble on the Beloit 20.
It took only two plays from
there, with Steve Howell making
a diving 11—yard touchdown
grab of an Art Peterson pass.
Dave Gauger converted.

The Pioneers retained their
momentum into the fourth
quarter, and early in that peri—
od a Beloit punt was partially
blocked and went out of hounds
on the Buc 20. One play, a pass
from Art Peterson to Bowers,
put the game safely in Grin—
nell hands, and reserves played

much of the rest of the way,
Beloit was unable to gain a
first down during the entire
2nd half. '

IN INDIVIDUAL rushing the
threelleaders were Elston Bow-
ers, who gained 41 yards on 14
.carries, Joel Goldman, who
gained 34 yards on 12 carries
and Carlton Peterson, who gain-
ed 22 yards on 3 carries.

Art Peterson headed the pass~
ing attack with a completions
out of 7 attempts for a net gain
of 55 yards; sophomore Denny
Hanssen, who played during the
4th quarter, completed 2 of 4
for a net gain of 22 yards.

victories in the past week. Last
Saturday the kickers edged
Carleton 3—2 and on Monday
swept easily past Beloit EH).

Carleton’s highly touted of.

the first half and two in the
second' to come from behind to
win.

Vince Anku kicked in the
first two tallies for Grinnell,
and Frank Chilingulo scored
the winning goal in a tense fin-
al quarter.

Eeloit Anku again led the Pi»
oneer offense by scoring twice.

lies of the contest.

:nell faces Carleton in a Confer—
Ience football battle tomorrow.
IThe Pioneers, on the heels of a
lstrong showing last Saturday at
iBeloit, will attempt to mar the
ICzlrls’ Parents Day festivities.

I Describing Carleton as a “good

passing team.” Grinnell's coach.
Edd Bowers, said, “We’re in
«,good shape for the game with
the exception of Jim McKlveen,"
who is currently hobbled by\a
leg injury, Bowers added that
if his squad doesn’t get “too
worked up” over the Carleton
contest. Grinnell could continue
on its unbeaten path.

For Crinnell on defense Bonn
lers plans to start Bob Chubrich
land Craig McManus at the ends;
Arlen Danne and Dennis Asby
or Dennis Homerin at the tack—
Iles: Steve Warrick, Gene K0»
wcrt and Pete Heinzelmann in
the linebacker slots; Kirk van
Rooyan at center; Car Smith,
Howie Dunn and Upton Ethel-
bah in the defensive backfield.

0N OFFENSE Bowers will go

Carleton's football fortunes
were dimmed last Saturday by
their 2743 loss to St. Olaf. With
the loss of their No. 1 quarter-

Dave Larson. Larson, a senior
