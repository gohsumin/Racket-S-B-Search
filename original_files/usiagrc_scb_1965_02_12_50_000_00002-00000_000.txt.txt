The ln’rerim Poll

The 5&3 poll on the interim taken last Tuesday
in the lunch lines was fairly successful in terms of the
number of students answering and in terms of infor—
mation gleaned. Fifty»seven per \cent of the student
body is a good representation, and an examination of
the result yields some worthwhile information and
leads to several suggestions

A strong majority agreed with the decision to do
away with the three—year—old interim experiment. And,
indeed, the poll did indicate that the lectures were
poorly attended and that over half the students left
campus for more than a day during the interim. ,

Nonetheless, the results of several questions in-
dicated that the interim was not such a terrible flop
and that much independent study was undertaken.

Over 60 per cent of those answering felt that they had‘

benefited intellectually from the interim, and 87 per
cent read at least one book during that time.

It appears that a period of independent study does
benefit a large portion of the students We would hope
that the statement by Chairman of the Faculty Kenyon
Knopf printed in this issue of the SSzB is followed up
and that other arrangements for independent study are
tried,

Other questions on the poll concerned the use
of interim for studying for the Junior Liberal Arts
Exam and senior comprehensives. Juniors and seniors,
by a Z»l margin, felt that the interim offered a good
opportunity to study for their respective tests The
same people, by almost the same margin, did not
eel that they could have studied as well over the
Christmas vacation.

Although the people who made the decision to
drop interim have pointed out that the lengthened
Christmas vacation of three weeks should provide
enough time for juniors and seniors to prepare for their
tests, there is also a feeling, as expressed in a letter to
the editor this week, that it is often impossible to study
at home. In many cases the research facilities just
aren‘t available, and in other cases it is simply incon-
venient to study at home.

Juniors and seniors ought to be allowed to return
to campus before second semester classes begin to
study for their tests

The results of this poll and the proposals made
above should be considered seriously. Some time should

be allotted' for independent study in the new calendar,
and juniors and seniors should be allowed to return to
Grinnell early to study for JLA and comps. . . ' _

' Shades of Gray
What The New World Halh Wroughl

By Carl Otis Gray

She stands as a symbol for all that is pure
and noble, for all that is good and kind, for
that certain superiority that marks our civili-
zation. She is the physical embodiment of
Florence Nightingale, Cleopatra, The Virgin
Mary, Brigette Bardot, and Queen Victoria
all rolled into one. She possesses that hybrid
vigor, that “melting-pot" essence that de-
scribes our society. She is, of course, the
American White Woman.

Indeed, she is the shining example of
American civilization from her Revlon lac-
quered toenails to her lpana brightened
smile to her dazzling Lady Clairol hair ~—
all that and only her hairdresser knows for
sure. Truly she has only one life and she
chooses to live it as a blonde. Though nature
had designs to have her pursue her destiny
as a raven haired beauty, it denied the Anglo-
Saxon in her; the Mediterranean strains were
forced to surrender to the overwhelming
forces of hydrogen peroxide Now with the
help of a skilled lens grinder she can have
eyes as blue as the Baltic. And Helena Ruben-
steili has seen to it that her dark olive com-
plexion need no longer be mistaken as He-
braic or something even worse; she can go
from Florida tan to city white in less time
than it takes to powder her nose.

To the American White Male she repre-
sents the American Dream 7 straight from

Scandinavia. Like her male counterparts she
is concerned with the great social problems
that dominate her generation and although
her concern never reaches the limits of in-
volvement she prides herself ‘on her aware-
ness and duty as an American. Thus, she has
all the potentials for the American Wifea
beauty, and awareness.

Most important, to the American Nonrwhite
Male she is that unattainable superiority,
that forbidden delicacy, possessor of that
contraband kissi Inviolable she is the thing
that he spends his whole life lusting after,
grabbing for, worshipping, molesting. He,
the sexually superior brute that he is, will
go to any extreme to procure from her just
one taste of that ultimate intimacy. Thus,
she must be protected, sheltered, hidden, iso-
lated from the ugly forces of interracial love.
Though her brother, American White Man,
may indulge in such indiscretions provided
there is a cash and carry relationship, Amer-
ican White Woman is denied the degradation
regardless of the financial propositions put
forth.

From May Britt to Little Eva she is that
which must be protected as we protect the
rights of the individual. She must be idolized
as we idolize the flag that represents a nation
under God. She must be free to realize her
potential just as much as every oth er
American with its ideals of God, country and
motherhood.

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

He ran his hand through his blond, crew-cut, col-
leglate hair and pondered over his problem for a
minute. Then he looked up and said, “You know I
think the meeting went fairly well. i thought we took
care of the problem in good ordain”

His mend look a long drag on the cigarette that
hung roguishly from the corner of his mouth,
scratched at his mustache and said, “Yeah, l think
it went well. No fuss. NC. argument We did what
had to he done."

The youthful one was having trouble with his
problem and he ran his sweaty palms down the sltle

of his Vrileck sweater. “Yes, interim was a noble
idea, a noble Idea but l: simply didn‘t work out. Our
students simply didn’t have [he rlglit attitude about
it. 1 think as members of the faculty we were ohli~
gated to discontinue it,”

The mustached-one curled his legs around his legs
on his chair and blew a cloud of smoke at the over-
head ilght. “Yes, I saw no evidence of anything but
wasted time during the interim Very little if any
independent study proiectsi Poor attendance at the
lectures. They made a tame of the whole thing.”

“Yes. they just weren‘t imbued with the proper
spirit. i guess they aren't intellec-

 

tual enough, I guess we gave them
too much credit," A wave of in-
splration flowed across his rosy
checks. “i think i have the solu~
tion [0 this little problem you gave

“Oh yeah,” said the rnuslached-
one getting up from his chair to
get a better View. “What is it?"

“Cue ball off that cushion and
seven ball in the corner pocket "
