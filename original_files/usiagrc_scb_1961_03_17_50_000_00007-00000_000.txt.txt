Half of the eginn’s
force is engaged in agriculture.
though only 5 per ccnt of the
land is considered good enough
for agricultural production. De-
spite this, Latin America seems
to be emerging (com a self.
sufficient agricultural economy
and to'bs headed toward a mod-
ern. much subdued, industrial
revolution.

A vel‘y'important "factor to
consider is the volume and di-
rection of investment. How-
ever, in Latin America, many
countrics don't have the capac—
ity to use investment funds of—
tectively because of such fac-
tors as la) a shortage of Erie
treprcncurs’ to new ventures, to)
a lack or supervisors, managers
and trained labor, (c) an insqu

Using as an example a per

per cent per year until 1975, (a
growth rate which many econr

China, paintings and iurntturc
are among the many antiques
‘ieloneind to the collection of
Sam Tctft, Grinnell iunior. For
nany years Teltt has been
browsing through antique shops,‘
going to auctions and visiting
the attics of old homes in search
of pieces to add to his Collection
The fun of the hobby, says Tefll,‘
is “making a,flnd:" for objects
of great interest and beauty can
turn up almost‘ anywhere,

At one backwoods auction in
Vermont, Tefit picked up an old
drop lcal table and a primitive
painting of a milkmaid for (\Vel‘k
ty cents. Another of his pu
chases includes a pan- oi Carth-
agiiiian lamps and an Egyptian
scarab, originally bought in
Tunis by a professor from the
University of Chicago. ‘i

According to Tom, these i
things which have survived 1
(or so many years help to tie l
history together and to pro ide
a link with the past. Unlike
modern {neloryrprmlutcd arti-
cles he added. they have uni- i
one personalities and back-
grounds. i

Tcift's collection includes
many early American pieces
such as samplers, a plate lrom‘
Harvard College and a cherry
{our pastor bed. The bed itself
cost only $15, but it turned out
to be no bargain when Tom
was obliged to pay $120 for a
mattress to fit it llis tainily has
also inherited some antiques bee
longing to British ancestors who
came to Ame ca and settled in
Boston in 1635. l

One of the good things about
this hobby. according to chtt.
is that the antiques are useful
as well as beautiful, One of his
most interesting rinds is a pawl
or no year old Hcpplewhite
