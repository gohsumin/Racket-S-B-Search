Applirarions Now

Available For ACM
Overseas Programs

Applications are now avail—
able for The Arts of London
and Florence, a program of
feted by the Associated Cole
leges of the Midwest for non-
specialist students in the lib
eral arts.

Students interested in being
considered for either the fall
1971 program (late Augustr
December 15) or the Winter
1972 program (early Februr
ary-late May) must submit
their applimtions by Decem»
be]: 1, 1970.

Participants will spend ap-
proximately seven weeks in
each city, undermking two
courses in each locale. One
such course in each instance
will provide credit in an art
subject; the other will be in
history, literature or other
topics related to the ACM
staff member’s discipline.

All program offerings will
rely heavily on the use of
local arts resources, andalso
much of the formal instruc—
tion will be enriched through
use of local Britishand Italian
scholars and other specialr
ists.

More information about the
program and applications are
available onyourtcampus from
Dean Joseph F.‘ Wall. Or write
to ACM, 60 West Walton, Chi-
cago, Illinois 60610. ‘

Off-Campus

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Due to a shormge of typewriters, student typists at Collegetown, USA,
have resorted to using each others' backs topractice on. “A poor variety

, of group interaction," one student commented, ”the only thing I've learned
‘ is who‘s wearing a bra." Advanced courses in typing will use much the
same technique; however, they will hop to and fro in a style reminiscent

of the bunnyr hop.

Dr. Cloh‘elier Publishes Book
Exploring The Nature Of Space

GRINNELL, IA. ,_ Dr. Beryl
E. Clotfelter, professor of
physics at Grinnell College, is
the author of anew book, "Ree
ference Systems and Inertia
" The Nature of Space," just
published by the Iowa State
University Press.

The volume is a study of ex-
perimental results bearing on
the two questions: Does an

absolute space exist7and What
is the origin of inertia?

Prof. Clotfelter discusses
many experimental attempts
to verify the existence of ab
solute space. He points out that
although these attempts have
been uniformly unsuccessful,
the concept itself is important
for an understanding of the
science of mechanics, which
deals with the morion of ob
jects.

An unanswered question in
the study of motion iswhether
a football, for instance, is
really moving when thrown or
whether it only appears to be
moving. In the observer's
view, the football's motion is
noted only in relation to the
status or location of other ob-
jects.

If on the other hand, the foor
ball could be proved to be moe
ving in and of it itself and not
merely in relation to other ob*
jects, this would be "abso»
lute" mutton which would
mean that there is anabsolute
space through which such mo
tion takes place.

The question continues to be
significant because attempts
to build logicaldcscriptions of
mechanics without the use of
the concept of absolute space
have so far been unsatisfac~
tory.

A related question which the
book discusses has to do with
inertia, the property which
muses matter to resist a ch-
ange in its motion. inertia
makes an object hard to start

moving, and makes it try to
continue moving once it is
started. The question is whe—
ther inertia is a builtein pro-
perty of matter or whether it
is a result of interactions of
one piece of matter with the
other matter in the universe.

if, for instance, the total
mass in the universe were
reduced by half, would a foot-
ball be easier to kick than it
is now? Many of the sensitive
experiments carried out in
attempts to resolve the ques-
tion of inertia are described
in the book.

According to the preface, the
book makes available to stun
dents with a minimal backgr-
ound in physics andmathemae
tics an introduction to current
work and modern thinking on
these concepts which are im-
portant to the ultimate ques-
tion of the large-scale struc-
ture of the universe. Thus,the
book alsodiscusses Einstein's
general theory of relativity
and its relation to the con-
cepts of absolute space and
inertia.

A member of the Grinnell
College faculty since 1963,
Prof. Clotfelter is currently
Chairman of the Faculty. His
graduate work was done atthe
Ohio State University and the
University of Oklahoma. He
received his Ph.D. degree at
the latter institution in 1953.

He is a member ofthe Amer-
ican Physical Society and the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science. ‘

Deadline For ACM

Oil-Campus Plans
To Be November l

The application deadlinesare
approaching for a number :of
off-campus programs of the
Associated Colleges of the
Midwest.

November 1 is the deadline
for application materials for
the following programs: Cosm
Rican Development Studies,
whose program datesare Jan-
uary 11 to June 11; Newberry
Library Seminar, which runs
from 'March 22 to June 25;
Urban Studies, February 1 to
May 13.

Also, Urban Teaching, which
has its regular program from
January 4 to April 16, anda
special “[ermrlength" pro-
gram from January 4 to
March 19.

The November 1 deadlineal-
so applies to the newly-estabr
lished New York Arts proge
ram. Students who enter this
program may tailor the pro-
gram dates to suit their own
college calendar. _

The applimtion deadline for
India Studies is December 1.
Dates for this program are
March 29 through mid-De-
cember 1971.
