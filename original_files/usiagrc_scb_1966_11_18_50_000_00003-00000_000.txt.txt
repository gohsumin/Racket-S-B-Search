To the Editor!

Alter consuming an entire
oyening of prime study time in
discussing the recently proposcd
Women’s hours changes, 1 iind
K cannot let go of the subject,
dnil so must put in a few last
words to the 5&5. Unless I
come from the most conserva-
tive floor on North Campus
(which admittedly may be
true) the opinions expressed
here tonight would tend to In-
dicate that the men of Grinnell
are more concerned about their
well~being (academically, inor~
ally, or otherwise) than are the
Women. We don't want you, the
zvomen of South Campus, {0 be
timed loose upon us! The
gemptatlonx are too great. You
right to feel it a compliment
to your Winsome ways, if noth-
ing else, that we feel there is
a need for some form of wo—
men's hourli. This may be I
form of graduated restrictions
ending to no regulations for
wnior women, or some such
thing, but that is beside the
point.

The point is that some of
III are incapable of handling un-
limited freedom. Human nature
simply does not cooperate, This

oes not necessarily imply the
angers oi illicit moral behavior.
although these dangers surely
exist. If only because we may
be too tempted to prolong the

leasantries of an evening when
here is need for rest or study,
please protect us. while there
are those amung us who may
lack the necessary maturity to

revent some actions or be-

avior which we may later rea

ret, we do feel that we can

aturely accept women’s hours
as a needed regulation

As one of several — I would
hope many — let me urge you
women to appreciate the tact
that somebody sees fit, in a
pociety such as Gi‘innell. to

seem more responsible, from
both student and administration

tion which realistically meet!
human needs? Nobody should
have to mature overnight. There
will remain inequities in any
system, but lessening restric-
tions gradually as the indivi-
dual (hopetully) matures in col-
lege would seem most intelli-
gent. To augment this system.

have occurred at a busy inter<
section where the City has so
far refused to place a slopligbtl

Despite these conditions, the
people have not completely lost
hope. A 9cycarcld woman re—
peats to Dunn each time she
sees him that she plans to move
away sometime. A resident who
called Dunn a “fool” two years
ago for attempting organized re-
dress now says, “I think we’ro
going to make It." What are the
causes {or this renewal of
spirit? Repeated attempts at
group protest seem to have
brought fourth a rekindled
awareness or personal dignity.
A delegation confronted a great-
ly chagnncd traffic engineer
with a demand for a stoplight;
it this is not met, the delegates
told the official they would go
into the street as human beings
and halt traffic until the light
was installed.

In another demonstration of
neighborhood seltcxpression, a
group from the Southeast side
attended a City Council meet-
ing which was considering pro<
posals tor the construction or
costly apartments in the area.
The neighborhood group pre
seemed an alternative plan, ap-
proved by an architectural con-
sultant, tor badly needed low.
cost housing in the vicinity.

Dunn believed that the atti-
tude or the municipal authori-
ties is well illustrated by a con-
versation b e t w e e n Mayor
George Whitmer and the Rev.
Frank Kroll, a supporter oi the
Southeast Side Project. The
minister was told: “I think you
should get your rabble-rousers
the hell out of here!"

Although Dunn is an advu<
bate oi non - violent social
change, he fears that continued
neglect could bring severe riots
in this area of Des Memes; the
sight of tho gilded Capitol dome

man hours are not to extend
beyond the end or first semes<

by the Aws Board in consul-

The Student Senate proposal
also recommended the introduc-
tion or a regular program or
discussion, to be held in El
residence halls, to “introduce
ircshmen to upperclassmen,
faculty, and stair, and allow
them the opportunity to raise
questions and express opinions
regarding campus life."

Still another topic of discus-
sion ln the proposal was the
consideration of open house
