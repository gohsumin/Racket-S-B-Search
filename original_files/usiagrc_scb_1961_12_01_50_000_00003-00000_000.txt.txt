Campus Action

To the Editor:

The idea of the dignity and
power or man, which gave
man the strength and courage
tor the tremendous aecom~
plisliments oi the last ieiv
centuries, is challenged by the
suggestion that we have to rc-
vcrt to the acceptance or
man’s ultimate powerlessness
and insigniﬁcancc. This idea-
threatens to destroy the very
roots from which our culture
grew.

Erich Fromm, “Mal-l tor Him-
seli."

The challenge that Fromm
refers to in the above passage
is no longer a mere suggestion,
Man, today, is being threatened
and bullied into accepting his
“u ate powerlessness and in-
significance." He is being com~
pcllcd to sacrifice his values. his
judgment and his reason to the
realistic fact that with a push
of a button he can be obliterat—
ed. The question being ‘forcsd
into mans thinking today is not
of the survival ot truth or vir-
tue, but of survival.

The Grinnell campus continu—
ally feels the crlccts of this
world pressure. Currently this
has been displayed in the issues
of disarmament, nuclear testing
and, most recently, the proposed
fallsout shelter. It is not my in.
tention to discuss the pros and
cons of these issues, but rather
to examine the campus reaction
to this challenge to mall’s dig.
nity.

It is true that many have
voiced their stand on these
issues, both locally and natiolie
ally. Resolutions and i-cteren-
dums have sounded out opilh
ions. Support has been lent
both through iasting and fi-
nancial aid, Then, does not
this speak for itself? Is not
this enough? Have we not re-
acted in such a way as to
credit man's dignity?

To a great extent, yes; how-
cver, perhaps ‘to a greater ex-

To the Editor:

On Monday evening, Nov. 6,
West Norris hall had a serious
discussion concerning the Stu.
dent Senate resolution on nu-
clear testing. After an hour this
discussion was cut short because
our senators had to go to the
Student Senate meeting and be»
cause a large number of our
members were scheduled to play
volleyball at 3:15.

Arriving 16 minutes late, one
minute past the 15smintlte pe—
riod of grace, our teams were

,told that they had lost 6 games
with East Norris by default, A
protest was lodged with the 1M
Beard and was deleated

The loss of the 5 games is
relatively of little importance,
What concerns us is the seems
ing lack ot perspective of some
of the members ot the 1M board.

tent, no. Too olten l have ioundl
the opinions bring Cxpl'

cd by the same productive lcw,l
For every one student who is
genuinely concerned, it seems,

so described, But, you say, how‘
can 1 say this in view or the
great numbers participating in
the last and thc r-etercnduin,l
thﬂ
seemed quite unaware of what‘
they were actually doing.

Many who xprcssed a stand
on dincrcnt i-ues
quainted with the facts of those
issues, or even of the implicas
tions or their stand. This was
particularly true of many who,

voted in the referendum.

Again, many who participatcd‘

following their own dictates, but
rather those of friends who on
couragcd them to join. But per
haps most noticeable of all are
those who are simply content to
sit back and criticize, joke, make
sarcastic remarks, or simply be
indiderent. These especially rep—
resent what Fromm was con—
ccriicd about. 1
i

All those cases in the above 3
paragraph are to some extent ,
beginning to how to the threat
oi our age: that man is power-
less and purposclcss. Their 1
stands are more verbal than
personal. Their inlormation is
more guess-work than iact- ,
work. Their interests depend ,
too much on the voices dietat- ,

illg those interests. l

And this is what the voices ot
nuclear destruction would want‘
man to bC—one who slowly‘
loses taith in stands and cone
victions. One who iealizcs the
realistic probability of Cataclysm‘
and problems of s ival. One‘
who can, smiling, sit back ill‘
oblivious serenity, and stare at'
the “Home, Sweet Home” plaque
on his iall~out shelter Wall. l

This is not to say that we do
not favor the 1M program or,
the generally ﬁne administration
of the pl‘ugram. However, we-
purport that practical experience
in democratic procedure, serious
discussion on matters oi national
and international importance,
and a real sense or participation
in the a airs or our country are
of more importance in a liberal
education than a recreation prev

gram.
We feel that all OI those [2017
loge experiences can and should

Exist, but i[ the former should
occasionally encroach on lhe lat-

ter, the latter should yield. This,
of course, is El matter of uplns

ion. We hope it is the opinion
at the overwhelming majority or
students at Grinncll.
