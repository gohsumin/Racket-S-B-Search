Warnings. Probations Issued
For Student Drinking Violations

The Student Primary Court
Issued two warnings and placed
two students on conduct pro-
bation last weekend.

The cases heard Saturday
Involved two South Younker
men who were apprehended
downtown on Feb. 1 by local
police for illegal possession of
beer and were subsequently
fined by an area Justice of
the Peace. The student court
Issued 3 severe warning to each
of the students.

The court explained that it
did “not feel obligated to im-
pose punitive measures in this
nose; both students have an-
swered to municipal authorities
tor their actions, and the court
tools that their position of po-
tential double jeopardy is net-
ther desirable not necessary.”

However, the Court reminded
the students that when a mem-
ber at the College community

leaves the campus, he comes
under the jurisdiction of mun-
icipal authorities and most com-
ply with the laws and regu«
lations set torth by those an.
thorities. The Court stressed
that. the actions of each mem-
bar at the campus community
retlect upon the College and
it is therefore the student's
responsibility to consider the
potential effect at his actions
not only upon himself but upon
the college community,

The other cases, heard Sun»
days, involved two stu-
dents, a Smith junior and a
Rawson lreshman, who were
observed to be sick in the
forum in separate incidents on
the evening or January 28. In ac-
cordance with the College rule,
their actions were brought to
the attention at the dean of
men. On being questioned, both
admitted that their behavior
and illness were the results of
excessive drinking The Deans'
Committee, in consultation with
the Executive Cabinet, refer-
red their cases to the Student
Primary Court. After hearing
the cases separately, the court
placed both studean on con-
duct probation tor a period be-
ginning immediately anti ex-
tending until spring vacation.

In reaching their decision on
the two cases, the court ad-
vised the students that “drunk-
enness does not absolve an in—
dividual from responsibility for
his actions, and that especially
in a public place, such behavior
at least inconveniences more
people than just the individual
himself.” The court further
felt that since both Students
were under 21 years of age,
their actions could be detri-
mental to the continued ei-
tectlveness of the current col-
lege drinking rule,

College Editors
Confer on

Generation Gap

Nearly 500 college editors
met in Washington last week-
end ior a conference on the
“Generation Gap." A Washing.
ton Post story told how the

students asserted their dissat-
istaction with society.

Presidential aide Walt Ros<
tow and columnist Walter Lipp<
man both spoke at the con-
ference. Rosww was hissed and
booed when he reprimanded the
students for presuming to speak
for their generation when oth-
ers of their age were tighting
“valiantly” in Vietnam. One
student answered, “What gen~
oration has ever been charac-
terized by its majority?"

other students talked of the
“sensitivity gap" (saying too
many older people are insen-
aitive), the “communications
gap," the “relevance gap"
(claiming much or academic
life is irrelevant). and the
knowledge cataclysm.

Bub Terrell of Morehouse
College summarized the reeling
of most at the editors when
he said that the generation
gap “arises out or disillu-
sionment with the adults who
have given up and traveled
the middle road despite its
ruts and the crap that rails
on them.”

Julia Van Camp from Dav.

enport, Iowa, editor at the
Mt. l-lolyoka College News, elu-
cidated student sentiment as
follows:
“it just bothers me to go home
because I have to lie so much.
l’m just sitting there and wish
ing I could tell them I'm an
atheist but I can‘t yet. My
mother clips out all these art-
icles about smoking and sex
and sends them to me. My 13
year old sister can't go through
this ignoranceisAbliss sort or
of life I had."
