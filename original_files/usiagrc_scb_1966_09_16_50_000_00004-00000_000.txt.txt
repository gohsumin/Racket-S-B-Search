Social Workers Counter Apathy

By ANNE FARRER

Besides performing t h o s 5
functions expected or them as
members of the Grinnell com.
munity, i.e., attending classes,
digesting SAGA iood. etc,. many
students make time, or con-
structively utilize their academ-
tc apathy, in various on or on
campus activities. Depending
upon the direction one wishes
his existential development to
take, one may become a dark
spirit in the drama department,
expound tor SGA or go on aca-
demic pro in the publications
room. However, for those who
have a tinge or social work in-
grained in their very beings, or

NotI Babysitting

'According to Bill Shaul. one

Tom Karger, Kaye Handiord,
and Bev Korsladt — "IL is a
club which is directed by col-
lege students and which serves
a neighborhood in southwest
Grinnell; it keeps the kids off
the streets and is the closest
thing to a Y they have.” At. this
juncture of the interview, the
others interjected that although
Uncle Sam's Club is NOT baby-
sitting, it is not exactly a social
experiment in the raw. How-
ever, this leaves quite some

Big White What?

The tnllowing appeared in
the PARSONS PORTFOLIO
under the head, “Parsons ls
Approaching Inc American
Dream" and a picture or
President Roberts captioned,
la and then there was this
big white bird":

Think Ior yourselt, tind out
ror yourself, test it yoursell, and
even live it yourself. Form your
own opinions and never let any-
one torm them tor you.

Such was the message and
main theme of Presldent Mll-
lard Roberts’ annual Summer
Convocation Address delivered
to an almost capacity crowd in
the Fry-Thomas Fieldhouse last
Wednesday morning.

num’s “Great Willie Bir

Students Needed

Speaking or what’s doing at
Uncle Sam's Club, more would
be if more college students
would participate. At present
there is a severe dearth of
Eagle Scouts, With which a
much needed troop could be or-
ganized, and with an increasing
interest on the part of the Grin-
nell jack and lie-man faction,
more tresh air and sportsman-
ship could be imbued in various
young male members. And any—
one \‘vho has musical capability,
not necessarily talent, will he
welcomed as well as anyone
with a passion for linger paint-
ing. In Short, as Bev Korstad
detines it, anyone who can be

'a good listener and likes kids

is qualified. Those interested in

Uncle Sam's Club should con- ’

tact either Bev Korstad, Kaye
Handiord, Eill Shaui or Tom
Karger.

vehicle to get the above point
across, Dr. Roberts also
stressed the fact that Parsons
is approaching the American

dream oi providing an educa-
tion for anyone who wants one,

Following the invocation giv-
en hy Campus Minister, Jack R.
Steele, [he “Chorale,” led by
Director Grier Davis, sang "Old
Man River,” highlighted with a
solo by sophomore Roger Behr.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Wiillam E. Munson then
introduced Dr. Roberts as a
man of many accomplishments.
Alter receiving a standing ova-
tion. President Roberts de-
scribed Parsons, its faculty and
its students,

He spoke or the school's aims
and purposes with the assuring
news that the college was
achieving most of them. Along

with the main theme of “form< .

lng your Own opinions." Presi-
dent Roberts also discussed
many or the problems or educa-
tion and how Io overcome them
—specitlcally how Parsons over-
came and is still solving many
oi them.

At the conclusion of the ad—
dress both faculty and students
responsively sang the Alma.
Mater and then. as the iacuity
ﬂied cut, the student body
waited respectlully until the
hand ﬁnished "Fanfare and RE-
cessional."
