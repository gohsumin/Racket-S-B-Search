Tuesday's Riot Spontaneous;
loggia Tortress' Breached

By Bob Hodieme

It started as an abortive fight Tues-
day night on north campus and grew
rapidly into spontaneous spring riot.

About 75 men “marched on” south
campus and at about 12:30 broke into
the loggia at the south loggia door.

The group milled aimlessly around
the doorway for 10 minutes making
short “penetrations" into the more mys-
terious reaches of the north end of the
loggia.

Someone finally turned out the lights
on the loggia ceiling and, with the bless-
ing of anonymity, the number of men
quickly swelled and the “breadth of
march" increased.

Soon there were about 150 men in the
loggia with perhaps as many more ob-
serving irom outside.

The rioters were much like the dog
who caught the car and didn’t know
what to do with it. “We’re here, so now
what?"

“Now what" was an attempt to get
the girls to leave the loggia. When it
appeared that only 40 or 50 would leave

 

9mm

of their own volition,
the rioters pushed an-
other twenty or so
outside.

With no leaders or
"established lines oi
communication,” th e
“riot" degenerated in-
to nothingness with
men standing self-cone
sciously in the loggia
with no place to go

loggia apprehensively measuring the
distance to the nearest ioggia door.

Student government, under the lead-
ership of Jerry Goddard, SGA presi-
dent, and Chris Peterson, aws Board
president, “moved in" about 1:00.
They gave the rioters a choice. They
could continue to “riot" with women'.
hours extended until 2:00 with no or
ganized riot at a later date or they
could break up Within 15 minutes and
have an organized riot some other
night. ‘

The rioters decided to go home.

Goddard said he decided to stop the
riot because “it was a disorganized riot
and we were protecting property and
people. It could have gotten out
hand." ,

Goddard went on to say that the “dif-
ference between this (the Tuesday riot)
and an organized riot was that at an
organized riot someone will take th.
responsibility."

Phone calls were made to north
campus warning the more intrepid
girls who had ventured north to com.
home for bed check.

By 1:45 the loggia was free of men
(with the exception of SGA and tho
5&1!) and most of the women we“
back in their respective halls. Chris
Peterson, AWS Board president, ro<
ported that there were no girlie miss-
ing during the bed check.

Damage was remarkably light on
south campus. There were two window.
broken and a few screens pushed out»
The final total on damage is still in

THE REAL RIOT

The Real Spring Riot fi-
nally came off —— or went
off —- last night. It was
11 o t ab 1 e for fireworks,
broken glass, tennis courii
dancing, and the “tradi-
tional activities." _

Congratulations, 0069i

 

Kissinger. 0n the opposing panel
Will be Mary Wright, also an ex»
pert on the Far East, and Hans
Morgenthau, director of the pro-
gram for the study of American
foreign and military policy at the
University of Chicago.

According to Sam Barnn (his-
tory), the teach-in will have more
the flavor of an academic debate
than a confrontation.

Arrangements for- the Grinnell
hock-up were made by an informal
faculty committee comprising Bar-
on. Lynn Parsons (history), Ron-
ald Kurtz (anthropology), and Rob
art Haveman (economics).

Several campus organizations
will help pay the $150 telephone
bill for the teach-in. Those groups
that have already pledged support
are lRC, Yﬂung Democrats, and
Young Republicans. Faculty dona-
tions are also helping to pay for the
hook-up.

The teachrin is being sponsored
nationally by the Inter-University
Committee for a Public Hearing
on Viet Nam. Committee organiz-
ers include David Riesman, B. F.
Skinner, Robert Hutchins, Jerome
Frank, Kenneth Boulding, Albert
SzenteGyorgi, and others.

Police Nab Pro

A Grinnell College senior and a
town resident were apprehended
by town police after a night watch-
man at the quad alerted the police
to the presence of the two on the
laggia root Saturday, April 24.

The case was handled entirely
through town authorities. partially
because I non-student was in-
volved in the case, Dean of Men'
5. Eugene Thompson said.

The two were fined for disturb-
ing the peace. The college took no
action in the case.

In another case involving the
town pulch, B leblc freshman
was found guilty of a conduct vio‘
lotion by the men’s primary court
after he was apprehended by local

town, and later turned over to col-
lege authorities,

He was put on conduct probation
until the end of the semester and
Was lined $15, $10 of which was
suspended.

Local authorities took no action
in this case.

The case was novel for the men's
primary court in that the defend-
ant was charged with A violation
of the general conduct clause as
outlined in the preamble to the
men’s house rules rather than with
a violation oi a specific rule.

The court's decision was 4—1,
with the dissenting magistrate
claiming‘jhat the preamble should
be only . an introduction to the

 

lice for being inwxlutcdrin

house rules and that there was no

”semen.” u. .

wlers: Couri- Seni'ences Frosh

reason to believe it was intended
to be a catchall rule.

The majority opinion pointed out
that the Court had a right to rule
on what parts of the men's house
code were actual rules and that
the court had decided the pre-
amble need not be considered I
mere introduction.

The majority then went on to
state that certain actions of the
defendant were in violation of the
precepts of the preamble because
they tailed to show good judgment
and because they reflected blamv
ant irresponsibility. ~

There was a cancansus that this
case points up a need for legisla-
tion that would allow the court to
hear cases that involve off-cam-

 

pm- .violations.

 

papers in Chicago, St, Louis, and
Kansas City.

The two journalism societies on
campus — Theta Sigma Phi and
Sigma Delta Chi —— are in chargc
of the press conference.

A complete schedule for Eisen-
hower's visit was printed in last
week's 5&3.
