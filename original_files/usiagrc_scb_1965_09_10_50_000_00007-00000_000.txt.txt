t~ aurvive it. At least i have not spent any
time in telling you not to be true to the
natural instincts 01 your generation, or
in telling you not to question the nulhor»
ity and responsibility ol the older gens
eration, or in telling you not to search
inlly ior new experiences or to right

,; liercely ior your rights, or, in general

_ to carry on its you will any way no ma
ter what I say. i do not tell you these
things because i can assure you that the
authority or the older generation needs
constant inspection and surveillance; it
it it generation that can take itselt with
too much eeriournees and it oiten needs
outside help to get reioeused. but while
you're giving it surveillance, you might
also give it some sympathy The chier
problem.with authority is not that in
blind or unwarrstruck but that it has to
reach declslons, not merely conclusions;
and these decisions have to be made in
an immediate physical and social en-
vlroninent which seldom permits any or
the nice quaiiiications and philosophical
inodiiications or conclusions. Lest you
think all this is somewhat overly delenr
sive, l suggest you consult your student
leaders, who are surely learning this dIlr
ierence, as at the same time they are
learning what it means to he prisoners
or their constituents. either tunnel or in.
tormel. one or the most poignant and
yet amusing sections in literature is that

but i don't really want to spend any

- more time talking to you about what sepr
aretes us but rather about what unites
as, young and middle-aged i mean being
students together and getting ourselves
educated. And the ltey words here, It
seems to me, are discipline and imagine.
tion, let these are the qualities that can
move on ndividual mind back and torth
over centuries, over generations voung
and old, those that have had their day
anti those that will. i mean, too. to use
these words to suggest a collaborating

esses. who is respocttui toward the in-
tegrity or small iacts and details, who
can communicate clearly whai he lrnows,
and ivho has the 'maglnr'lllall and enough
control over his instincts tor seIHuve to
admire an excellence he lnnisett may not
be able to not. re, So iar as i know,
neither at the two true ties, d ci
or imagination, is restricted to a particu-
lar curriculum, but i can sugeesl that
imagination can be nurtured only it you
have both the perteoiion anti grace to
admire something better than yourseli
and your own achievements 7 wlictiier
it be in the tine or applied arts or simply
in other people. No man really raises
hiinscit by worship g he
needs to admire someihing out
self and then train and discip ne lllmt
sell to reach it, or at least come close
to it. That is why the person who seems
to expucl too much oi you is the man to
hasten on with your ivhoic h art: tie is
your best tcacncr, cherish inn he may

 

drive you into proving that you really
are better than you thought you were,

is based on one oi the oldest pedagogical
devices or all time 7 doing your homer

you're talking about. it may start as a

whole purpose is to expose you to lt,

you are worthy. and it you will return
the compliment honestly, you can catch
what its- trying to trap you with. me
that point torward your only complninl
about the place will be there lsl'l'l more

you, rellects a wish that unites all or
