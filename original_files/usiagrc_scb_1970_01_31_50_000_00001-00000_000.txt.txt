Anderson Leads
Christian Symposium

Between Sunday and Tuesday
of this week, Dr, Francis Ann
dcrsen was the featured speaker
in a symposium, the Future oi
Christianity in the Poserhristian
Era, Copies of Dr. Andersen’s
speeches will be available soon
from the Grinnell College Chris-
tian Fellowship.

Dr. Andersen, a native Aus.
tralian, is Professor of Old Testa-
merit Literature at the Church
Divinity School of the Pacific in
Berkeley and Visiting Professor
of Ugaritic at the University of
California. He holds seven
degrees, including an MA in
Physical Chemistry, an MA. in
Russian language and literature
and a PhD. in Oriental
languages from John Hopkins
University. His specialty for the
last 15 years has been early
Canaanite and ancient Hebrew.

In an interview the 5&8 asked
Dr. Andersen whether he thinks
his broad education has given
him any important insights in his
field. “of course it's difficult
enough to excel in one subject
these days. let alone many. But
I prefer to have had the broad
experience than not. Most theolr
ogians can‘t base an opinion of
scientific work on knowledge. A
scientist who loves his subject —
and appreciates the structure of
the world isn‘t necessarily
godless as some theologians
say." Dr. Andersen said that as
far as he knows, no institute has
yet been formed to join the sciena
tist and the theologian for long.
range work. Such an institute
might be helpful to both. ”When
a scientist raises questions about
the origin of the universe, he is
outside the range oi purely scien-
tific speculation.” How would Dr.
Andersen distinguish between
theology and science? “That is
a hard distinction to draw, but
part of it is this: Although the
methodology in science is agreed
upon. theology is done in many
different Ways by different theol-
ogians. Some theologians begin
with man and make their theol-
ogy a sort of selfvunderstanding.
Others study it as a classical
discipline, a system of thought
which can be learned and

Arnold Stein, Professor of
English at the University of
Washington, will deliver a talk on
John Milton entitled “Love in the
Garden” next Thursday at 3:00
PM. at Grinnell House. Author

Donne, John Milton, and George
Herbert, in addition to a book of

personal experience and can't be
learned from a book. Still others
begin theology with the
assumption that God has
revealed himself, For these, the
task becomes to discover what
God has revealed about himself

places himseli in the last group.
“Scientists, on the other hand,
may avoid the philosophical task
of questioning what they are

quately preparedi Andersen said
that although many are well
trained, he Wishes that more
were practiced in thinking
critically and following an argu—
ment. “Many seem to believe
that anyone has the right to say
anything he wishes without the
responsibility of supporting his
statements.” He suggested that
undergraduate seminars might
be a good way to solve the
problem.

”The students we have now are
far more candid and interesting
than those we had lo years ago,
There seems to be a revolution
against the attitude that the prep
fessor is there only to inculcate
knowledge, and this is right. Part
of the professor’s task is to in
spire in the student a life-long
interest. But at the same time
the student should not believe the
professor has nothing to teach.”

Andersen observed that many
students can talk openly and
irankly about sex but are very
coy about studying religion.
Perhaps they don‘t discuss religr
ion enough. “Is there a limit to
how far a question can be pur-
sued in the classroom? It would
be tragic to think that anything
that borders on theology is off
limits. This raises an important
question: Can neutrality be
preserved in the university?”

What are Mr. Andersen‘s views
on the student power movement?
It always seemed important to
me for students to have a real
role in the community they com-
prise. When a group of students
requested that student observers
be allowed to attend faculty
meetings, 1 ielt it was not enough.
Students should he allowed to
participate in running the school
a they should help both in
making decisions and in doing the
work." Anderson pointed out that
the Seminary’s students are all
graduate students, many on their
way to careers in universities.
”They are not fools, but they are
inexperienced in running a uni-
verslty. The only way to get
experience is by helping to run
the school,” Andersen said that
any proposals which would give
the taculty no voice are ob-
jectionable. “There should be a
sense of common enterprise.”

(35 On Black America

The speakers who came to
Grilmell under the sponsorship of
the Concerned Black Students
lectured last Saturday on the
American black experience and
its implications.

William E. Cross, Jr., in
structor in Afro-American
studies at Princeton, presented
ahypothesis that a black person
“experiences a series of well de-
fined stages in becoming trans
formed from a ‘Negro,’ with all
the bad connotations of that term,
to a “Black" or ”Afro-Amer
ican," with all its good connoo
tations.”

Finley Campbell, assistant
professor of English and
chairman of the AfroVAmerican
Studies Committee at Wabash
College, portrayed the Black
Panther Party, guided by a com-
plex ideology and a humani-
tarian outlook, as the key force
inblackliberation.

In his lecture, “Black Ex—
perience Seen as Process,” Cross
divided the process of the trans
formation of the American black
man from “Negro" to “Afro—
American” into four stages: pre
encounter, encounter, im-
mersion-emersion, and inter
nallzation and commitment.

During the prerencounter
stage, according to Cross, the
lower or middle class black leads
a contented life, but with the
world view of the white racist
society. Although he knows that
society is wrong, he does not
believe the system is at fault, and
in his personal life he adopts the
white cultural value system, with
its emphasis on the advancement
of the individual. as his own.
_—

At the seminary, the students
participating are doing well.
The gravest weakness, however,
in the system is the “complete
lack of Continuity." There is such
a rapid turnover that by the time
a student learns the ropes he
quits. He indicated that although
the participating students may
learn a lot, the university hasﬂg
gained much in the long run
because of this. Nor‘do programs
worked out with these students
always satisfy the student body.
This year, for instance, a new
curriculum was instituted at the
various Seminaries in the Bay
area. “It was worked out in close
consultation with students 7 in
fact, one could almost say it was
student written." The new
curriculum was not accepted by
the students as a whole any better
than the old one had been. Dr.
Andersen blamed two factors:
First, many didn’t know that
students had helped in designing
the Curriculum. Second, this
year‘s class has a diilerent
outlook from the students who
helped write the curriculum.
“It's hard to respond to student
needs when those needs change
or are hard to discover.”

The world view and personal
outlook oi the black in the pre-en-
counter stage is often disturbed
by some event or experience that
causes him to question his outs
look and values, Cross explained.
After this experience, or “ens
counter," he will consider new,
more radical, interpretations of
the black experience. In this
stage, he will also begin to feel
guilt for the way he has been
living.

This guilt erupts and results
in a new search Tor black idenr
tity, in the third “immersion-
emei-sion" stage. During this
period, he will “immerse himself
completely into the world of
blackness“ and he will tear him-
self completely from his previous
white outlook. He will also
develop a ieeling of black super-
iority and will think of the white
man, as biologically inferior.
According to Cross, this very
race conscious black will seek
confrontations with whites,
especially police, during this
period. When his urge for con
frontation is satisfied, he will
enter me “emersion” period #
a state of relaxation during which
he will discard his formerly
racist outlook as he begins to feel
more and more in Control of his
life.

Finally, the experiences of the
previous three stages will either
frustrate or inspire the individ
ual, and this will determine
which direction he will follow in
the fourth, “internalization and
commitment" stage. Here,
Cross said, the individual may
feel disappointment and rejection
or may continue in the “immer-
sion" stage if he has been frusA
trated, li he is encouraged, he
may either “incorporate
psychologically the idea that he

can dig himself,“ and go no
further, or he may commit him-
self to action.

Campbell, who spoke on the
“Ideological Roots of the Black
Panther Party,” discussed the
many ideologies which the Black
Panther Party draws on, with an
emphasis on their humanistic
facets. He said that the ideolog-
ical motivation of the Panthers
— “What’s to these guys other
than that they can die“ — is
complex, and normally not well
understood.

Because the Black Panther
Party will be leading this fight
against the white man’s exploita-
tion of men and the environment,
Campbell said he expected many
others who are concerned with
these things to join with the
Party’s efforts in those fields. He
emphasized, however, that the
primary concern of Black Pan-
thers is the “black national com-
munity,” and no one can follow
the party only part of the way.

Campbell concluded by listing
three ingredients to the party’s
actions. First, the Panthers
combine tribalism and politics in
“Tribalitics,” a way to “col-
lectivize the political iacets oi
society without interfering with
the individual in that society."

Secondly, it combines “Euro-
Christian radicalism” with the
African Christian tradition into
the concept of developing cone
science and intuition collectively
7 according to Campbell,
“everybody does the same thing,
but in their own way."

Finally, the Black Panther
Party, looking at American
populism with a MarxistLeninist
interpretation, takes “newV
populism" as a third ingredient
to its ideology, according to
Campbell.
