Plan for Advice ,
ls Formulated
at Encampment

By Ellen rear-cc

"We malized a philosophy
of adv' ng” is an approp tat
summary or the report from
the Committee on Student~Fac-i
ulty Relations of this fall's En»
carnpment.

The “philosophy of advising”
began with the freshman and
his adviser. “The adviser is an
introduction to the academic
realm and to the prirpose of a
liberal arts education it wa5r
felt that perhaps the prolessorsi
don't realize the value students,
place on this service and that
students could give the profes~
sors some help and advice in
this respect

The committee proposed that‘i
the ireshman write an essay for
hrs adviser during the summer;
discussing “what he would llkei
to obtain from a liberal artsr
education.” which would allowl
him to “speak frankly without
the pressure involved in the es-
say he writes tor acceptance to
Grinnell."

sirgestions were also made‘
that the adviser meet his fresh—
men informally first and give
them more time for consultation
and registration.

For upperciasmen, the com-_
rnittee recommended for those’

who have not declared majors.I

a‘iarotessional advisory system."

Fol declared majors, they sug-
gested more independent study
projects promoting more rotor—
mal academic atmosphere and'
also presented the novelty: “tin.
dcr this program, the laeulty
member and student could work
together, too, on material for a
project that the professor is de-
veloping

Following the attempt through
their suggestions to make the
s t u d e n t . faculty relationships
more personal, the committee
considered comprehensives.

“Often students ‘teel reluctant
to talk to their maior proIQSrl
sors because they know that
this man is
ministering
srves. The

their Comprehen»
institution of a
board oi examiner from another
college for seni comprehen—
sives would relieve this tension
The student and faculty mem-
ber would be working together
to beat the board of examiners",

in the social arena the com l
inittee suggested the elirninatron
of faculty chaperones which

they describe as “painful for-i
both parties." students invitingl
faculty members for dinner and;
the faculty inviting the students;
for informal dropeins was 'en~
couraged instead.

In concluding the committee
touched on several problems}
worth further consideration.

“When a prospective studentl
applies to Grinncll, he is told‘
that there is a close student—
faculty relationship, but today,
we are undermining this by the,
attempt to make a name for;
our-selves. To become a prestige
school, prolessors must publish;
to become well known in their
ﬁeld, and the departments mustt
bring distinguished guest speak»
ers to the campus. All of these
things take away from the time‘
the professor has to get to
know the student and deteatl
this objective of our small ilb»
ei-al arts college."
