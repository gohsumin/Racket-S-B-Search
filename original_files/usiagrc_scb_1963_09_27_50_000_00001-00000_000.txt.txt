Israeli Ambassador Siresses l
lmpor‘iance of Small Naiions

“I'm quite prejudiced in think»
mg that small nations are very
important," said Israeli Ambassa-
dor to the United States Alli-ham
Harman. Harman spoke Sunday
night on “Israel: The Role of a
Sindll Nation in the World To-
clay."

In emphasizing the smallness
of the state or Israel. the
speaker said it lud only 2,—

dicated that, regardless oi size,
no n' tion is willing to surren-
lilei- i own personality by any
dictate. Another basic principle
or a small nation the ambnss
sador pointed out, is its stake
in international peace and hare
mony.

“Peace is not the absence of
war, It is a positive concept, not
a negative one." in reference to
the present Siluatlon betwe‘an the
Arabs and lsi-aclis, Harman said
that every day which passes in

hearts and minds ot the people

The ambassador feels that a
small country should not en-
deavor to compete with a large
one in quantities, but should
try to keep defense quality on
an equal level. In isracl the
people are less removed from
the government than in a ing-
ci- country, and they tend to
criticize from the viewpoint of

Harman concluded his spccchl
by voicing the hope tor a “unit-l
