US. Population Suffers Assault On Eardrums

Have you noticed? It’s get~
ting noisier.

Already the world's noisiest
nation, the United States has
suffered a steady assault on
its citizens’ eardrums. Sound

levels have increased an esti-
mated one decibel yearly for
the last thirty years. Those
thirty decibels represent about

: one-fourth the level of sound

that can cause permanent dam-
age to the ears. Moreover, an
article in me October Read—
er’s Digest points out the rate
of increase is climbing and the
din is expected to rise even
more sharply in the future.

One main reason for the rac-
ket is that along with popula-
tion growth we are experi-
encing a proliferation of ma-
chines, The average suburban
home may reverberate to as
many as twenty different mo-
tors ranging from automobile
to air conditioner.

Scientists attempting to stem
the rising tide of noise are
meeting a surprising obstacle—
reluctance of us consumers to
give up the image of power
created by sound.

For example, laWn mowers

earsplitters. They can be made
far less noisy at little cost. But
when one manufacturer tried it
some years ago, his sales
dropped. The reason: custom-
ers felt that the less noisy mo~
tors had less power.

The converse reason explains
why any kid converting an old
car to a “hot rod" makes it a
first step to remove the muf—
tier.

Similar feelings on the part of
consumers have prevented au-
tomobile manufacturers and
makers of refrigerators from
making their products quieter.
Many of us find a good secure
feeling in the sound of an au-
thoritative clunk.

There is no question that
noise annoys. Studies indicate
that Workers in offices and fac-
tories with high noise levels
have more personal conflicts—
at home and at work—than
those in quieter surroundings.
Mounting lawsuits and com-
plaints also attest to the noise
created furore.

 

Science is doing its part to
help quiet things down. To al~
low them to do the job that
must be done, we as consum-
ers will have 'to abandon
our false idea that noise and
power are identical. Once we
