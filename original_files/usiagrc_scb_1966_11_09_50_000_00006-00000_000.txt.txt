physical surroundings and to
audiences."

“The audience reaction tem-
pers an actor’s performance.
Different audiencﬁ stimulate
the actor to see different as-
pects or a role. Even a dull
audience is good hecause it
makes an actor really work
hard; he challenges the audi-
ence to respond by the amount
he puts into the role."

“It’s so great to be selfvdi-
rested, selfrresponsible and ma

valved in a purely artistic en-
deavor without any academic
restrictions hanging over us,"
Brenda went on to say. She also
advocated an expanded touring
program tor drama majors (in-

All those involved in the pro-

stay had to be limited to a few
days. Rehearsal time was inad-

chance to gain a close view at
campus life.

SCARLET AND BLACK

In the little house which Le-
Moyne provides for its Grinneli
students, there were a few
small get-togethers where the
visitors could talk informally
with LeMoyne students and
with one faculty member. But,
as one prolessnr remarked as
we were leaving on Friday,
“You just got here, why are
you leaving already?" He also
suggested we bring many more
students next time and stay
much longer.

Letters . . .

To the Editor!

Perhaps after reading this
COPY of one of such letters from
“The Voice of the People" in
a Chicago paper the students
will have the answer as to why
education for the Negro is in-
ferior in Chicago. Quote:

INNERCITY TEACHERS

Chicago, Aug. 5—The added
work load carried by the teach-
ers, clerks, and the custodial
stati in inner-city schools cer-
tainiy warrants additional com-
pens'dtion. Transfers, both in
and out. take many hours of
the day. Also. vandalism and
many problems requiring pan
ent interviews make additional
work and record keeping tor
those employed,

Generally in outlying schools
children enter the schools in
ﬁrst grade and remain until
graduation. There is little or
no damage to schools, the chil-
dren are generally well dis.
ciplined, and little or no parent
coniercnccs are required.

I have had my can seriously
damaged three different times
hy irresponsible drivers who
carry no insurance and have
no job and no hrakcs. Also,
our cars parked at the schools
are constantly getting tires
slashed and windows hroken.

or course. the answe is to

erage hy hall members, and 2)
more imaginative use of the in-
itiative fund to supplement their
depleted social fundsr Other
senators concluded that it was
not the function of the Senate to
underwrite irresponsible actions
and misuse of property on the
part of students by covering the
consequences of such action.
The proposal was defeated by
D. 20 to 15 vote.

 

transfer out, but this Is proo-
tically impossible Those in out
lying schools never transter.
Almost all the new, young
teachers are assigned to inner-
city schools This is very do
moralizing for young people
in view of what we have or
gone thru this summer. we
should receive combat pay. The
danger is very great and nerves
ara frayedr
May 1 perhaps suggest some
of the students in sympathy
helping by being teachers ln
these areas instead or complain-
Ing about what others are not
doing
