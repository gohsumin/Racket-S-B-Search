Grinnell's athletic teams did a dangerous thing last
weekend. Each of them won its contest and the cross-
country team showed the results of too much deviance
from academic goals by beating four other'schools.

If this trend continues it will certainly allow our
athletes to enjoy a disproportionate amount of prestige.

People might start coming to soccer games; athletics “

might become a campus conversational topic; and

(heaven forbid!) people might go as far as to yell, ‘

scream, and carry on in a most juvenile fashion at foot-
ball games. Let this be a warning to all Pioneer athletic
teams. “Watch your winning ways!” They are the first
harbingers of the ruination of Grinnell’s healthy atmos-
phere.

I hope that through the medium of exaggerated
sarcasm, I have somewhat accurately satirized existing
feelings among many factions of the Grinnell student
body, administration, and especially the faculty. The
arguments against the vigorous pursuit of athletic ex-
cellence at Grinnell College are many, and for the most
part, I think, ill founded, or at best based upon valid
criticisms of institutions of an entirely different nature
from Grinnell. Next week I shall present a few gen-
eralizations which should serve to refute to some de-
gree some of the arguments of these “anti-athletic"
factions.

Perhaps the answer to our problem is named Gene
Mauch. We could probably find the shortest path to
athletic oblivion in no time under his guidance, al-
though ho would certainly have competition from the
city of Cincinnati. Now there’s a place which has to be
full of academic excellence. After all, only 7,000 people
turned out to see the Red’s play a crucial game with
the Pirates the other night. Isn't that somehow indi-
cative of a really healthy community sense of values?
It must be.
