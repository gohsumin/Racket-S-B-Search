Senate Discusses Newspaper;
Possible Support for Thomas

Lately there has been a lot of
pressure put on the folks who run
the SRiB to answer student de-
mands that the editors and staff
try to conﬁne their political views
to the editorial page and leave
reporting. editing, and layout
free from the oppressive burdens
oi political bias. The college com-
munity desires that this paper
approach its coverage of events
and issues with complete political
objectivity.

In an attempt to establish an
objective distance between my
assignment and my political
prejudices (such a distance
would obviously facilitate a de-
tached View of the senate
meetings( I now submit a report
on a senate meeting which i did
not attend. Although sprinkled
With fact, this report is essential-
1y composed from rumor, mali-
cious gossip, and slanderous
character assasination.

Johanna Ward is finally a
senator.

Mick Schaalman reported from
the student-faculty ‘student
power’ negotiations. Mick said a
forthcoming statement would
“tell all," but he did announce
that progress has been made in
establishing plans for student in-
volvement in general education
reqm'i-ements and other aca»
demic affairs, Mick pointed out
that his committee was dealing
with only academjc issues, and
that other committees would
have to take it upon themselves
to work out plans for residence
reforms, social guidelines,
grapes in the jello, etc.

Mick asked that the senate fill
the three vacancies on the com-
mittee (Prawn, Stranger, and
Schwartz), and the senate was
delighted to oblige (Alan Cohen,
Jim Lew, and Frank Thomas.)

Jon Stein has received per
mission from Mrs, J, Hawk and
Mr. S, Chuck to sell food in the
Cafe del Faro from B-l2 on Friday
and Saturday night. The fare will
include tea. coffee, pastry. bagels

and lox (pronounced “‘lahks”).

Expansion of sales to Tuesdays
thru Thursday and a gala Sunday
brunch seem feasible for the
future,

Moved by his fellow students’
hunger for relevant reading
matter, Mike Penzner asked the
senate to give postable copies of
the minutes to house presidents.

Mike then asked the senate to
revoke the finance committee’s
ruling that no hall can get its
social funds if it has outstanding
damage fines, (The rationale for
this ruling is that the finance
committee does not want hails
to pay oii tines with social
money.) Mike, desiring to return
the power to his people, asserted
that a hall should be able to
determine how it wishes to spend
its money. Whirlwind debate on
halls and hall funds resulted in
the passing of a motion that no
hall funds could be spent without
a major vote of the hall, but a
motion to revoke the original ii-
nance committee ruling about
denying initiative funds to halls
with outstanding damage bills
was defeated.

Tom Tom wants money again.
Tom wants to start his own paper
and asked the senate for an allos

cation. Recalling the ghost of
Henry Wilhelm, Torn assured the
senate that they would not be the
major contributors to the paper
and, therefore, would not be re
Sponsible for legal hassles which
might come up.

Frugal Andy Loewi wanted to
know if Tom had returned the
senate money from his opus “,The
Second Battle of Chicago.” Tom
assuagcd Andy's concern with an
assurance that part of the money
had been returned, Debate
followed on the virtues of having
several small newspapers in-
stead cione “biggy.”

Frank Thomas, in an unfortuns
ate semantic move, suggested
that the senate give Tom “all the
money he wants.” Tom asked for
fifty thousand dollars, but Frank
only had one buck on him and
refused to give it to Tom bccause
he needed to play ping-pong alter
the meeting.

Someone asked Doug Klein,
mild-mannered student auditor,
if the student government had the
money to give to Tom in the event
that they vote to do so. Doug’s
reply was a firm, self-assured “I
don’tknmv."

The senate tabled poor Tom
until next week, when Doug will
report on the rcsey condition or

SGA finances.

revealed a sharp mind. For in
stance, concerning the lndians’
demands for government reim»
bursement for confiscated lands,
Papakee quipped, “If they paid
us, maybe we wouldn’t have to
be doing this (singing).” The
audience seemed to have great
respect tor Papakee and his
music, although they did not
personally identify with it.

Following the Papakecs was
Glen Ohrlin, superb yarn-spinner
and master of the art of un
derstatement. With a completely
straight face, Ohrlin amused
everyone with his tales and
cowboy ballads, while ac-
companying himseli with a
simple unsophisticated guitar
strum.

Bukka white, quite a
storyteller himself, also got a
warm reception. His strong,
hardrdriving, blues beat counter-
balanced some fine, delicate
guitar improvisation. Especially
impresswe was his use of a metal
cylinder on his left hand. which
achieved dobroseffects on his all
metal guitar.

Maybelle Carter, best known of
all the participants, did some
fairly good flatspioking and
doublethumbing on banjo and
guitar, but her singing technique
did not quite measure up to her
reputation. In addition, her
compulsion to apologize ex-
cessively made her seem very
unsure of herself and distracted

TheSilver Light Gospel Singers
were a (me example of spiritual
singing at its best. Without the
aid of any instrument, they
maintained perfect pitch
throughout a varied and in-
tercsting rcpetoire of black folk
music.

Undoubtedly, the high point oi
all the workshops and concerts
was the unparalleled Cajun
Band. Those who left the
Saturday concert early missed a
rare experience: to the beat of
over two hundred madly clicking
spoons and clapping hands, the
Balia Brothers and Nathan
Ashire thrilled the audience with
a reireshing combination of
bluegrass~Virginia reel-French
care music. Long after the
concert, echoes of “WhoaaatH”

Judging irom the affectionate
and enthusiastic reaction to the
Cajun Band (they were the only
group to receive a standing
ovation), the college community
would certainly welcome them
back to play at a dance,
