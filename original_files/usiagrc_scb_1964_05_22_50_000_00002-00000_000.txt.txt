In his final chapel appearance as President of the col-
lege, Dr. Bowen illustrated that he has not abandoned for
Grinnell those high ideals which he believes can make the
college finer. During his years here, President Bowen has
held the notion of the independent learner in a free society
paramount. In his Game of Numbers, Revisited on May 8,
he presented additional proposals offered in the Game of
Numbers two years ago.

Most important to the student in these proposals is the
attempt to eliminate pressure without decreasing the quality
of education. The comprehensive exams, both on liberal arts'
and in the major field, would take on greater importance,
blit preparation would be more concentrated toward this
end. The liberal arts exam would be given to sophomores”
or accellerated freshmen, when the student had finished hisi
preliminary liberal arts courses. The interim session, asi
such, would be abolished, and the time put to better use:
during the whole of the semester. After passing the iiberall
arts exam, the student would be prepared to enter completely
into study in his major field. The comprehensives, under
this system, would be more carefully planned, more consci-
entiously prepared for, and of greater value to the student
and his record.

Especially designed for eliminating pressure is the pro
posed revisal in the grading system. The rigid A, B, C, D, F,
categories which often cause the student to seek out easier
courses or professors for the sake of jacking up the grade-
point, or wllich discriminate heavily against the borderline
student would give way to a high pass, pass, and fall system.
The wider boundaries would most certainly take away some
of the fine lines that honor societies and grade schools ap-
preciate, but it would give greater opportunity for students
who clutch the gradepoint ladder to engage in something
other than “self-service."

The independence in learning is most avidly supported
by Dr. Bowen in his view toward a modified tutorial system
in which students would be engaged with faculty tutors dur-
ing their college year on a regular and extensive basis. Inde-
pendent accomplishment would be measured and directed

y the faculty tutor. Immediate student concern with this
proposal was that such a system be definitely improved from
the freshman advisor system now in operation. It would
take a competent and active faculty to provide the number
of qualified, interested tutors needed. The heavy responsi-
bility here would be in choosing the tutors for each student
and for allowing for flexible change within the choices should
students become dissatisfied with the tutors chosen.

It would most likely be necessary, as the President has
suggested, to have two major groups of tutors, one for fresh-
men and sophomores, concentrated in the liberal arts, and
one for juniors and seniors after they have selected their
major field.

Although a great deal has been said about the Game of
Numbers during the last two years, the same old contest
is still being played here semester after semester. Every-
one seems aware of pressures on the students and of the
inability of the present course-faculty system to take on any
real movement toward student academic freedom. The interim
period has only been a frustrated attempt to accomplish in
two weeks what necessarily demands four years. Students
agree with Dr. Bowen’s ideals, but wonder just when action
can be or will be taken. Are they going to be removed from
our sphere when the President moves on, remaining in the
office files, and in the old copies of the S If; B as only “well-
sald thoughts?” LD

Letters to the Editor
Loss of Library Books May Cause “Distasteful” System

To the Editor:

The quality of students at
Grinnell allows for many priv-
ileges and freedoms in the
course of our college educa-
tion. Both professors and ad-
ministrutors frequently employ
an honor system in regard to

academic and social policies,
In the past few years there has
been one area of student of—
fairs in which this system has
failed miserably. Library in-
ventories reveal that. more
than 800 books disappear from
Hurling Library each year.

 

Rattner Finds New Art Form—
His Modernistic Pretzel-Bike

To the Editor:

As a graduating Art student
so engrossed in his major field
of study, I make no pretense to
any literary talents, much less,
as yet, to an accomplished pro-
ficiency in any of the other
areas. But I must speak With a
certain Pride and conviction
when relating a recent dlSCOVv
cry, for venturing, the other
day, beyond my usual sur-
roundings, i believe I finally
came upon a piece of true un-
diluted creation; Yes, an art
form that hurl been conceived
with such force and emotion
that it. seemed to surpass even
the wildest dreams of human
capability.

There it was, in the after
glow of an Iowa sunset, my

Member of Old Guard
Fires Up Over Apathy

To the Editor:

Let me prelac’e this letter
with the statement that I am
part of the “old firedrup guard"
and not a part of the "new
guard."

As of late there has been
much talk of an increase in so-
cial fees. And 1 should like to
reply, ”Why increase them?”
My proposal would be to re-
duce the social fees to naught.
After all, dOESn't the majority
rule? And our majority does
not attend the excellent social
events provided.

I should also suggest that
Spring Day be dropped because
it. Is evident that it is an un-
necessary nuisance for the stu-
dents. By why, you say. The
picnics were well attended.
Yes, nature has a great power
over hungry Grinnellians. What
about the other e v e n ts?
“They’re a farce." . . . . “and
that awful weather.” Lous-
ey, worthless excuses.

My suggestion is that we
abolish all social functions and
create the strict academic at-
mosphere that the “new guard"
seems to Want. Let’s have Burl-
ing remain open until 12 mid-
night Saturday nights, to get in
step with the "new guard.”
The Forum shall replace the
temporary Union and shall only
be used for intellectual dee
bates and discussions. Down
with I. Mrs. We only have time
for books.

Ahhhhhllhhhl The “n e w
guard”! How we will pride our-
selves on our perfect academ-
ic atmosphere and our number
of mental crack-ups.

own bicycle—to think it should
happen to rue—wrapped around
one of our own campus trees
like a Swedish pretzel. One has
only to imagine how I stood
transfixed in this vision of mag»
nificence.

Perhaps it might be asked
Who was the master of this
plastic discipline and where
had he ever received his tram-
ing. But that answer, I am
afraid Will not as yet reveal it~
Self. for his style, although not
without a certain assuredness,
is still somewhat confused.
(perhaps he is still in his blue
period) At any rate, the grace
and finesse with which hel
smashed all the spokes like a'
spring cloudburst is surely a,-
sign of the more refined ten-‘
dencics of the neorococco; in,’
this sense he must be a very
sensitive person. Yet the very
grand conception of an entire"
bicycle, handlebars, basket and‘
all, crumpled to a pulp is qultel
Baroque, and betrays thosel
qualities of a well thought:
thoroughness that always bringsi
an idea to completion,

Possibly We will in the near
future see his style crystallize
into a full maturity with furthr
er bending; Alas that i had but
one bike to offer my country.

Considering the fact that the
cost of cataloguing a book usuv
ally equals its purchase price,
the annual financial loss to the
school approaches 38000. In ad
dition to this financial loss, the
scale disappearance of book;
indicates a disregard for pro-
fessors who must plan their
courses and for other student:
who must complete their re-
quired work.

Faculty concern over this
problem has resulted in exten-
sive study by the Faculty Li-
brary Committee, Several solu-
tions have been presented, few
of which are complimentary to
either the Faculty Committee's
or student leader’s conceptions
of student responsibility, Wheth-
er unintentional or purposelul,
the permanent removal of books
from the library cannot be tol-
erated.

Perhaps the students are not
completely aware of current
library policies. For instance,
a book may be checked out i -
definitely it it is not in immedi-
ate demand. There seems little
cause for books to disappear in
the process of completing as-
signed work.

Beginning Friday, May 22
and continuing until May 31
there will be boxes placed in
the dormitories for the pur-
pose of Collecting “borrowed"
library books. We hope that
students Wlll realize the gravity
of the present problem, return
any books which they have not
checked out, and utilize the li-
brary’s present Checkrout pro<
cedure.

It the students act now there
will be no need for the intro—
duction of a system which
would be distasteful to stu-
dents and faculty alike.

Stuuss Presents Figures on Faculty;
Disproves Recent fCompurutive Study’

To the Editor:

According to an article in the
last issue of the 5&3, mere is
“concern over loss of profes-

sors, courses for next year."
Further, the article referred to
a “comparative study" show-
ing that “at this point there is
a net loss of ten faculty mem-
bers. . .”

Tile following are, at this
point, my best estimates of fac—
ulty size next year. Note also
the data for the present year:

I have not gathered data on

the 1964-65 courses. It may be

that the number of courses to
be offered is slightly less than

the number offered this year. 1

hope that this is the case: but

i have no confidence it will oc«
