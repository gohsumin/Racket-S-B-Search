From the Past .

Forty-five years is a long time in the history of a college
as well as anywhere ‘else 1919 seems to be a very great dis-
tance in the past, remote from our modern world and the
Grinnell College of the PPPE, the Civil Rights Group, and
tshe Forum. Was it really so different, though? A look at the

8&B’s published 1n the first semester of the 1919-1920 school
year reveals some interesting differences, and some astonish-
ing similarities.

This was just after a world war, and the boy- girl ratio
was still upset by the number of Grinnell men who served in
the armed forces But the men who did live on North Campus
in that far- off year returned to school under a new residence
system described as follows: “There will be faculty men re-
siding in the suites formerly known as the house chairman's
suites, but they will have no responsibility for the conduct of
the men in the dormitory and are in the dormitories only for
the friendly association with the students . , . ." And, from
one of the new residents,” My only desire is to serve as a
means of communication between the men and the administra-
tion, to develop such plans of government as the men believe
Will maintain the high standards of the Grinnell college . . . .
they (the men) can be trusted to develop for themselves ideals
and traditions which will make life in the dormitories a dis-
tinct good.”

This was the era of daily chapel meetings, except during
the flu epidemic and the diptheria scare, Freshmen were re-
quired to attend several “Freshman College Adjustment
classes,” and all students were required to attend class meet-
ings. A prize was offered to the women’s cottage which pre—
sented”.. .the best record in the observance of house regula-
tions . In orde1 to fostei community spirit in its broadest
sense . . .to reward the girls who strive with the Community
Aim in view." But prepping, including an enforced serenade
in pajamas, ahounded, and there was even a Flunk Day. And
social life, too Note the paid advertisement which appeared
in an October issue: “All engaged girls are requested to wear
insignia of such, as diamond (or) frat pin. .in order that a
more accurate census may be made. —- Ex- service Man”

Problems such as the League of Nations petition, Red
Cross Drives and a 3-inillion- dollar endowment fund drives,
received publicity in the pages of the 5&3, already in its
27th season. B&G problems were there, too: “When you can’t
turn the faucet off in your room, and you haven’t any rug on
the floor, and the lights are on the blink —- two blinks, in
fact — and the drinking fountain is broken, and the gas
leaks in the kitchenette, and the iron won’t heat, and your
alarm clock goes back on you so that you are late for your
eight o’clock —_oh, cheer up . . .” (Consolations include sec-
onds on butter, roomcleaning service, and mail delivery to
the student’s room. What consoles us?)

Grinnell-in-China, a fore-runner of the present 5th Year
Abroad program, and the exchange with Anatolia College in
Greece, now a pan of the same plan, were both going strong
in 1919 So was a person familiar to every present Grinnellian,
as proved by the following letterl “If nominations to the Hall
of Flame are in order, might 1 not propose that Nonessential
Citizen, that Walking Big Ben which locks the animals in
the Quad? And might I not say of him, as Uncle Sammie ,far
more falsely says of his mail carriers: ‘Neither snow nor rain
nor heat nor gloom of night stop this courier from the swift
completion of his appointed round!’ — N.H,S.” ——

Between studies, religious activities, and fun came an-
other omnipresent aspect of college life —— the Student Coun-

' cil. Shades of the 1960’s these quotes from the first editorial
on the subject in January of 1920. “. . . we at Grinnell see
the college body of which we are each a part afflicted with
a member which is fullyas grotesque and as useless as legs
on a fish or fins on a horse, The member passes under the
name of Student Council . . . in the past four years at least
the body has lain in a stupor awaiting the death which so far
has not come. Its duties during that time' have consisted, so
far as anybody knows, of’apportioning the semester fee and
directing the college dances , . . , The reason for the failure of
the Council probably lies either in the indifference of the
students, the negligence of the faculty in granting sufficient
power to the Council or the inefficiency of the Council itself.

One last article, not because“ it proves anything at all, but
just for the fun of it. I swear to its authenticity. The head-
line reads “Red Lights Remind Noise Makers to Use Soft
Peddles." The article, in its entirety, tells: “The Quadrangle
loggia has recently brought forth a crop of beautiful red
lights, It is rumored that their purpose is to remind the girls
of the necessary pianissimo,

”0f couise, the more poetic girls, when they start up the
loggia, shivering, to breakfast, say that the rosy glow makes
them th. .k of sunrise in the springtime ‘n’ everything, but
whatever you think of, the fact remains that in front of each
cottage a red light sheds its warning rayi Those who live on
the log: '1 say it’s a danger signal: it will be dangerous for
anyone cafter to come down that ruddy district at some
unearth , r explaining to her roommate with squeals and
giggles , , tie had to eat and what “he" said while she was
away 0 . J week-end." Quiet hour warnings have never
been li _ .n my daylli Maybe times have changed!
