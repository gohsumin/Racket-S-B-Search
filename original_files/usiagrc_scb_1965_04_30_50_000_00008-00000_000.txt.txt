It has came to my attention that
some people are in disfavor with
my article of last week. which is
all right in itself. but most of them
have misinterpreted the point of
the article, or, more specifically,
one paragraph.

The purpose of this column is
not indiscriminately to criticize
Grinnell athletes and is certainly
not to criticize individual Grinnell
athletes. Its real purpose is to
point out weaknesses in the Grin-
nell sports system. The views 1
take are originally purely my
own, but I have found a great ma-
jority agree with me.

In my experience with college
baseball and other baseball of
similar calibre, it has always
seemed advantageous for the mana
ager or one of his assistants to
coach third base. For from third
base he can keep a tight control
on the game with the signs he
gives to the batters, his signals to
the baserunners, and so forth.

So Morgan Michel was actually
a victim of circumstances. He
happened to be the third base
coach when I was watching the
game. What I said in the article
was that no one but coach Piitsch
or another coach should be on
third.

From the baseball team I have
heard Morgan is now an assistant
coach and so is capable of taking
the responsibilities of the third
base coach. I send my congratula-
tions,

Now if some people question oth-
er parts of the article, they can
bring up their questions with me,
and, if necessary, ! may spend the
last month of the school year ex-
plaining my ideas.

As for this week's article, I am
sure glad that Morgan himself has
a cooler head than some other
people, especially two of his
friends who visited me last Friday
night, or i would probably be in
no shape to write this article now.

in a bitter letter I received Wed-
nesday, signed by The Baseball
Team — although i highly doubt
everyone had a part in this — it
was suggested among other things
that I should perhaps transfer to
Monmouth or maybe become a
coach next year.

Unfortunately I have already
paid my $50 and am planning to
draw for a room next Monday.
And I am sure the sports budget
would not allow another coach,

If the authors of the letter would
like to use their ability to write
baseball stories, instead of criticiz-
ing them, we would all probably
be happier. For i know an actual
player can always get a better in-
sight intu the game than a report-
er can.

I also know that if the team
spends as much energy against its
opponents as it did in this letter,
it will be getting many hits and
will really be tough for the rest
of the year. Let's hope they can.

stitutes, 2) cooperation with Negro
colleges such as LeMoyne, 3) send-
ing faculty members out to other
institutions, 4) a crash program
for the Negroes in this area of the
country to help them learn the
basic R’s.

“The true tragedy," Betts con-
cluded. “is that we have to single
out the Negro in discussing educa-
tion."

We must convince Negro stu-
dents and parents of the value of
a liberal arts education which of-
fers the luxury of an affluent so-
ciety, Betts said. The utility of
this education is not measured in
figures,

Grinnell has been amazingly suc-
cessful in attracting academically
qualified Negroes. ”You have no
idea what the battle is on the mar-
ket right now!" Walker explained.

Kissane Publishes

“Tennyson: The Passion of
the Past and the Curse of
Time,” an article by James
Kissane (English) appears in
the March issue of the “Jour-
nal or English Literary His-
tory.”

Kissane’s essay examines the
Victorian poet laureate‘s sense
of time as it dominates much
of his important poetry.

Women's IM's

“Assets for Leadership" was
the theme of the twentieth Na-
tional Conference of the Ath-
letic and Recreation Federation
of College Women held in Lin-
coln, Nebraska, April 11.14.
Four Grinnell women, LeAnne
Hoepner, Lynne Stoelting, Vicki
Crandall, and Rin Yeisiey, at-
tended the convention accom-
panied by"Mis‘s Joyce Buck,
adviser to WRA hero on camps
us.

Participants in the confer-
ence included 260 persons from
27 states. Time was divided be
tween speakers and workshops.
During ohe workshops prob-
lems of WRA's at the local level
were discussed. It was learned
at the conference that in most
schools all women students au-
tomatically become members
of WRA with their enrollment
in the school. It was also found
that funds for operation of
WRA in these schools comes
from the activity fee.

According to Rin Yeisley,
president of WRA at Grinnell,
the Conference "proved Val-
uable no the individual and has
the potential of being Valuable
to the local organization.” Its
main worth in presenting an
opportunity for a large amount
exchange among students and
among advisers.
