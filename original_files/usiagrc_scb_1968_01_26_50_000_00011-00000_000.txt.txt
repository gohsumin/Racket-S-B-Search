GRINNELL "66" — IN ”68"?

Publication of Henry Wil-
helm’s "oldest unpublished col-

lege yearbook West of the Mis-
sissippi,” Grinnell College—1966,
has been delayed again.
Wilhelm, 24, a lornier Grin»
nell student and former editor
or the oilicial college Cyclone,
explained the new delay in a
letter to subscribers mailed a
low days ago. '
"when we last wrote you the
book was at a printer who had
agreed to do the job for us,"
Wilhelm said. “Subsequent to
that, a senior oiticer in the firm
decided that they would mt

print the book because," he
said, of ‘the book's past his»
wryr.”

“We have been told by the
(new) printer," he added, “that
the book will be completed to-
ward the end at February, so
we’ll pass that on to you.”

"But," he noted, “we teel
rather embarrassed to guaran-
tee anything, so we can’t pro-
mise that date tor sure.”
NEW PRINTER ANONYMOUS

Wilhelm said he had located
another printer, this one in New
York. He told the 5&3 that his
lawyer, Michael Horwatt, oi

Washington, D. C., advised him
not to divulge the name of the
new printer “because or possi-
ble harassment by the college."

College records, however, did
not indicate that Chapman was
an alumus of Grinnell.

“At this point the type has
been set and prooled, and the
plates are being prepared,"
Wilhelm explained in the letter.
“The very same double-impres-
sion printing process is being
used as we previously adver-
tised. The new printer is chart
ing somewhat more; (The cost
of the book has reached tour
times the original estimate,
Wilhelm later told the SM?)
the difference will come out Of
our pockets.”

ROUGHLY 750 SUBSCRIBERS
Asked how many copies of
the unpublished annual had
been paid tor, Wilhelm guessed
“roughly 750, I'd say."

“We've still got a long way
to go to break even," he con-
eluded.

“The type is absolutely set.
The book is deﬁnitely progress-
ing,” the Grinnell, la. resident
stated. “We've now reached the
point of no return."

TRIP TO N. Y.

Wilhelm went to New York
last weekend to “personally"
check on the progress of the
publication He said he’d be
back in the town of Grinnell
later this week to report on the
progress.

“We hope that you will bear
with us on this;" he said, "we

ADMISSIONS BOOK STYMIEI]

By DIANA SALURI

Limited student response has
temporarily halted work on the
proposed student-written ad.
missions booklet. Publication
will not be in time tor this year’s
prospective students as was
originally planned.

The Student Senate Admis~
sions Committee, sponsors of
the project, received only lit-
teen contributions in response
to a school-wide soliciting cam-
paign at the end of last semes-
ter.

According to committee chair-
man Doug Tolletson, the con-
tributions were lacking in varie.
ty as well as in number.

“Many ot the topics students
chose to write on," he com-
mented, “were quite similar.
Because we didn't get the com-
prehensiveness we teel is neces-
aary to represent all aspects
oi Grinnell, we don't feel that
we should rush into putting I
book together right away.”

Plans (or a student - written
admissions guide lor prospeo
tives were ﬁrst made after mem-
bers oi the committee studied
a similar publication put
out by Carleton College. The
project is backed ﬁnancially by
the admissions office budget

and subject to the review of the
Faculty Committee on Admins
rions.

Dale Terry, director of ads
missions, thought the book would
be a valuable supplement to the
regular catalogue.”

Toilefsun sees three possible
alternatives for the tuiure at
the booklet: the committee will
again solicit contributions at
large, assign specitic contribu-
tions, or appoint a single author
for the book.

In addition to publishing an
admissions guide, the Student
Admissions Committee has tall}
en over the job of arranging
student contacts with prospec-
tives over Christmas vacation,
They have also been gathering
application terms and admis.
sions data irom other mllegel
tor a comparative study or ad-
missions procedures.

Tolleison defines ihe main goal
at the oommittee as being “tho
attraction or topnotch studento
by presenting the interesting!
creative and exciting aspects
Grinnell."

Other members of the come
mittee are Sara Hartman, Terry
Mossholder, P e a r l Kadota,
Kathy Lester. Hubert rarbes.
and David Cavander.

 

doubt that you feel as grieved
about this delay as we do.”
HISTORY OF BOOK

Grinnell College — 1966 was
originally going to be the ol-
ticial college yearbook tor that
year. Wilhelm and co-editor
John Phillips, 21, formerly of
Algona, 1a., mailed the manu-
script to its ﬁrst printer, a ﬁrm
in Hannibal, Mo., last April—
long after the normal publica-
tion (late.

The printers mailed it back to
Grinnell, telling the college they
would only publish it it they re-
ceived a hard and last releaso
irom any legal responsibility
irom Grinnell College.

The book, the llrst printer

suggested, “was a major do-
parture from what is normally

found in a a college yearbook."

The book allegedly contained
pictures of a marijuana party
on campus, a male and temalo
student leaving n local motel
together, and coeducational
beer blast.

“There weren’t any obscenq
pictures,” Wilhelm told the As.
sociated Press last May, "N
nudes or anything like that.

John F. Bierman, the attorney
lor Grinnell College said h.
counted "at least 30 instance!
oi potential libel" in the year-
book.

Both Wilhelm and Phillips, t
book‘s editors, ﬂunked out o
Grinnell. The College refused l
publish “Grinnell College—1m,
and Wilhelm decided to Mil.
it published himself.
