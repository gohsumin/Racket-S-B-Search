a standing loan collection, a
membership to STASH (the

extensive collection of books

contributed by individuals, in

be elicited from state and local

Bradford Euloqixed

To the Editor:

If some sense could conceive
bly be found in Dr. Bradford's
death, it would have to emerge
from those who experienced the
power and grace of the man. A
quiet dignity lived there, pro-
jected through the power or
awesome intellect and scholastic
achievement. As a student who
admired hnn, who would seek
to eulogize him from a tragical-
ly peripheral position, 1 can
only attempt to remember and
fulfill the growth that this man
released within me, and to ask
from uncomprehendillg Death
a chance to dcscry the awesome-
noss of His deed.

I wondered many times at tho
extent of Dr. Bradford’s knowl-
edge, and the enormity of his

vision. One finds ill Yeats what
one would cherish most in End-
lord. and it is inevitably so, (or
why also would a man devote
himself with such obvious ador<
ation to a poet, unless poet and
critic had finally merged? His
Very Style of life called forth
the aristocratic shade that was
Yeats, called it forth and mods
it breathe with its own devotion,
so driven, so relined, so bewild<
ered by excess of love, To learn
from Bradford was to hold for
unbearable seconds the ﬂame
that poetry ignites, and to
mourn anew the chill that even
now creeps across in hand that;
once was warm.

We have our Visions and our
refuge; our dreaming refuses
to die in silence or in night. Let
there then be some salvation,
if only a ghost of hope within
disbelief. Let there be no end
to remembrance.

Comments on Fence Rnnling

open Letter to Student Body:

Last spring Jerry Rubin came
to our little world and pro.
claimed his intent to “shake the
fence" in order that no one
would be left straddling it, The
response favoring such “action"
was (Seemingly) overwhelming
in his favor (it's hard to tell
what the response was favoring
—but that’s another issue).

last faculty meeting by a pro
posal from the Committee on
Faculty Organization on student
participation in faculty meet-
ing was also carried a step
further and nearer at least
temporary resolution on Thurs
day. The earlier proposal was
a general one, calling for a
group of ten students to attend
and vote in all regular faculty
meetings, and shortly after it
was introduced, it was tabled
for future discussion.

The committee, headed by
Prof. Raymond Betts (History),
brought the matter up again
yesterday. This time, it was
recommended that the Commit-
tee on Faculty Organization get
together With the student senate
to appoint an adhoc committee
to bring recommendations be
for the faculty meetings on
student participation.

Meetings that students might
attend, however, were narrow-
ed from any regular meeting
to faculty meetings dealing
with curricular and general
educational policy. The Bette
committee foresees the student
senate electing the ad-hoc
students. The committee would
have an equal number of fac-
ulty and students, and their
lunciion would be to draw up
a formal proposal regarding
student attendance at faculty
meetings.

As a temporary measure, at
the next faculty meeting, Octlr
ber 23. the faculty will admit

aws President Jane West
told the crowd, ”We desperate
ly need more students involved
in all aspects of the college.

“You need to make your in-
terests known," she said, add-
ing that there “is a deplorable
lack of participation by wom-
en."

Loose Hall President Mike
Penzner expressed “a very
cynical view" of the other
speakers' comments. “We've
been saying it year alter your
alter year,” Penzner said.

"Most changes at Grinnell
have come as a result of lac<
uity work rather than student
work," he continued. “It's
easy ior us to stand and talk,

hard to sit down and

two 5&3 reporters and two
KDIC reporters with note-pads
and pencils, to release faculty
news to the paper and to the
radio station. The only pm-
hibitioii so far passed is that
no tape-recorders be used for
news-gathering The policy at
admitting reporters is only a
temporary one, subject to more
discussion and possibly revi-
sion. As it stands now, accord<
ing to Worley, the faculty will
be inlormed of the reporters'
names in advance, and they
will enter with credentials from
the 5&3 and KDIC.
