Katz Works on Book

For the past year, Seymour
Katz (English) has been on leave
to carry out independent research
work for a book he wlll write.

The research work was done at
Widener Library, which is located
at Harvard University. Widener is
one of the largest research librar-
ies in the United States. Katz
stated that he found much enjoy-
ment “wandering through Willem
er's stacks and Iindlng books i
never knew existed.”

While at Harvard, Katz studied
the changes in Nathaniel Haw~
[home's distinctive conception of
character and the changes in his
technique or detailed character de-
velopment as they reach a cul—
mination in the Scarlet Letter. He
will now investigate the evolve.
ment or Hawthorne’s imagery and
narrative technique before writing
his book.

Harriers Take Les Duke Second.
Travel to S.C.|. Dual Tomorrow

By BOB KATZ

Grinnell‘s varsity cross country
squad ﬁnished runner—up to win-
ner Luther College in Saturday’s
Les Duke Invitational Meet. It
was the tirst time in the history of
the meet that Grinnell failed to
capture the Winner's trophy.

Luther had a point total of 38,
as compared to 57 tor Grinnell,
108 for St. Ambrose, 113 for Loras,
134 for Black Hawk, 149 for Cor-
nell, 171 for Central, and 233 for
Graceland. The score was not
tabulated [or either Beloit or coe.
because both teams had only tour
finishers. Five runners is the
minimum number needed to score
in cross country meets.

Bradford Ends
Yeats Study

Yeats at Work, Curtis Brad-
iord’s study of all the writings of
William Butler Yeats, was pub-
lished Monday by Southern Illi-
nois University Press.

The publication or the extensive
treatise came in the centennial
year of Yeats’ birth.

Bradford (English) exerts most
of his scholarly ellorts In the World
ot Yeats. His research has already
yielded many articles on the poet.

in 1954-1955, Bradford was a
visiting lecturer in American Lit-
erature at Trinity College in Dub-
lin, while on a Ford Faculty Fel-
lowship which enabled him to
assemble preliminary details tor
the hook. in 1960, a grant irom
the Lilly Endowment gave him
another summer in Dublin where
he was able to delve into papers
otherwise inaccessible, including
unpublished papers in Mrs. Yeats’
possession.

 

Grinnell was again led by John
Sharpe and Jeri Langhan, whose
respective times of 22:11 and 22:28
for the tour mile course were good
enough tor sixth and seventh
place. Ric McDowell ran a line
race, in placing tenth with a time
of 23:23. Hob Grant Captured iii-
teenih place, running 21 seconds
behind McDowell. Steve Brintnall,
Doug Dray. and Spence Clarke
rounded out the varsity entree in
19th, 23rd, and 28th places respec-
[ivelyr

The lootball crowd was treated
to a fine pertormanoe by Gene
Takle of Luther, The defending
NCAA small college three and six
mile champion won by a wide
margin in a time of 21:08. His
teamaies placed titth, eighth, elev-
enth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, in
clinching the team championship.
Other strong individual pertoi-m.
ers were Dennis Karnstedt of Cen-
tral, Bob Johnson of Black Hawk,
and Larry Gusman, who took sear
mid, third, and iourth place honors
respectively.

Coach Dick Young was some-
what disappointed over the team’s
lack of cohesiveness. He stressed
that he wants this team unity to
be achieved by bringing the trail.
ing runners up to the trontrun-
uers, rather than having the lead-
ers slow down.

Rain continued to hamper the
training methods of the team. The
wet turt has made it impossible
tor Coach Young’s harriers to do
the repetitive short distance speed
Work which is so vital to a run-
ner's conditioning. Overdistance
running, eight to ten miles per
day, has had to SllﬂiCEt

Tomorrow the varsity will travel
to the State College at Iowa tor
a dual meet. The ﬁrst league meet
will be on homecoming against
Monmouth.
