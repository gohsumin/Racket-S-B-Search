“ert'l’ em up if they don’t deliver!"

He Says What He Thinks

When it comes to seeking candid comments,
you’re a hell of lot better off talking to Big Jilin Sle-
biska in town than talking to Negro students on this
campus.

At least Big Jim will tell you what he thinks.

Based on the evidence volunteered —- the in-
stances of verbal or physical aggression against Ne-
gro students actually reported by them — there
would seem to be no problem in the town of Grin-
nell, Iowa.

But there is.

After interviewing almost everyone involved,
only a handful of incidents were agreed on by Ne-
groes at the College.

But ask the same students — so reluctant to re-
port their own individual confrontations with the
townies —— if there is imminent racial violence in
Grinnell, and you'll find their feathers highly ruf-
ﬂed.

By now it should be obvious to everyone that
students don’t have to go to Chicago or Des Moines
to find incidents of racial hatred.

A lot of people ought to be nailed up for the
‘trouble they’ve caused.

Everyone from Grinnell Chief of Police Bill
Peters to Boycott-planner Max Helfgott agrees that
the College could have and should have pressed
charges against townie aggressors in a number of
instances.

Most people agree that the Police could have
and should have acted more quickly in potentially-
dangerous and often physically-damaging confron-
tations between town bullies and Negro college stu-
dents.

And a good number of people rightfully think
that the Grllinell College White majority should be
morally indicted for apathy in the face of danger
to their Black fellows.

But you can’t nail up anybody without evidence
and support.

And until Negro students become willing to re-
port what happened . . . until both White and Ne-
gro students realize that quiet, lazy discussions
aren’t the only solutions to which they can com-
mit themselves . . . until the College adminstration
is jolted by tragedy to act first and think about
town-gown rapport later. 1 . until the activists learn
to plan before jumping to guns and boycotts . it
seems pretty unlikely the trouble will decline.

Max Helfgott acted too soon. He admits it, and
there's no sense crucifying him for an error of judg-
ment in the form of an information leak.

The College and the Police haven't acted quick-
ly enough, and maybe they can learn their lesson
before the real —— now potential — trouble starts,

The Negroes haven't been candid enough in the
face of actual investigation. They remain covert and
self-shrouded in mistrust, mysteriousrless, and
secrecy.

And Big Jim —— stereotyped the town bully ——
has simply got to be congratulated God help him,
he thinks he’s acting for the town of Grinncll.

But at least he says what he thinks.

By FRITZ SCHWALLER

As usual, when the Admin-
istration is contempiaiing a
basic change the students have
been kept in the dark as to
what the change will involve or
who it will effect,

More often than not the rea-
son ior this “lack of commune
icatinn” has been that the Ad»
ministration itsell doesn‘t know
what is going on.

This vacuum of knowledge at
or from the top has caused
rumors m be thrown at the un.
Wary student with such rapid-
ity that it is sometimes diiiiclllt
to separate the rumors from
the divine oracles. But sums
ideas do stand in the lore-
ground as actually being pr0<
posals.

The most certain of these
proposals is the principle ct
alternating dorms or at least
coeducational campuses, not to
be coniused with coeducational
dorms.

Dear Mrs. Low: Why on
earth would you want to co
educate, or rather integrate,
the campuses it there will re»
suit the same delineation be~
tween purely male domain and
female? I refer to the south
campus wall system. What dit-
terence is there to men remain.
ing solely on North Campus
than to being placed at the
southern extremity of South
Campus?

1 can think of few things
that might help the social situ-
stion at Grinnell better than
alternating dorms, Yes. alter-
nate, like Mears: womentl
Main: men; Cleveland: women.
This would keep men and wom-
en out or each: other's halls,
but would still give the atmos-
phere of one uniﬁed campus
and not two separate and dis-
tinct ones, How about making
Meal-s and Main the same sex
as East and West? Now it's I
long walk for a guy late on
Saturday night returning from
his chivalrous escorting of his
date to her "door".

The second most obvious pro-
posal, it not now a tact, comes
to us as the allacampus mom
draw. In my opinion the status
gun is far superior.

Men, being what they are,
prefer rather set groups oi
friends, at least to live with.
When u freshman is placed in
a hall, he must mold himself
to his new environment, as he
will have in do under ”its new
system. But as it stands now
that male will remain in his
group of rather intimate iriends
unless he wishes to leave his
hall, which he is tree to do.

Okay, I put in my plug for
the old system. Well at least
someone has come ollt into the
open and defended a View, 1‘5-
gardless of its merit.

As things stand now Bur-ling
Basement had better get busy
and drop some more proposals.
When someone Said no one
knows general student opinion
(in the affair he made the un-
derstatement of the year.
