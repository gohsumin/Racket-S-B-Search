Refugee Asks fasl Support

The Sudan, the largest country in Africa (one million
squure miles), became independent in January, 1956, as a
result or a unilateral declaration of independence, which was
quickly recognized by the two codomini, nrltain and Egypt,
each for its own reasons. History has accidentally and artifi-
oially out the Northern and Southern Sudan into one country
—- the Sudan. The result Ill this is now one of the bloodiest
Ind most ieroclous civil wars in the world.

The outside world knows very little about what is going
on in the Southern Sudan, because, for obvious reasons, the
Khartoum government does not allow foreigners to travel
ireely in the Southern Sudan. Nevertheless, a newsman lrom
the Daily Mail whose mlcle appeared in the Washington
Post (Feb. 20, 1966) managed to go to the Southern Sudan —
illegally, oi course. He observed:

“For mile alter mile in this wlldemess, the wreck ot
civilization meets the eye: the burned-out shells of Mrlcan
villages out to the torch by Arab troops oi the Sudunese army.
Where now then worked Ind children played and cattle
grazed there Is now no sound except the coughing or baboons
and the wind rattling the dagger spikes oi thorn trees. . . .
The people or the Southern Sudan are dying in tholsande For
some death Wines via the Arab bullet, as happened in the
tub: Massacre (July less) when either 400 (government
sources) or not) people (refugee sources) were killed in one
bloody night."

The result of this mankilling has been a collapse of
trade, administration, and agriculture. Communications have
been destroyed, and the lat commercial enterprise of any
significance, that was run by a subsidiary 01 British Ameri-
can Tobacco, has been abandoned, leaving behind a crop
worth about 8 million (U.S.) dollars. A state of emergency has
been in force since I was in grade school.

From such n wild state of malls, relugees (l urn one 0!
them) have fled into nelghborhg countries: Kenya, Uganda,
Ethiopia, The Central African Republic, the Congos, and
Chad. There are estimates that over I million Southern Su-
danese have either fled the country or died. Some or these
rclugees m in camps under nominal UtN. inspection, but the
majority of them are crammed, sometimes do to a hut, in
border villages. Others are students eager to learn with no
body to support them financially. My present interest lies in
these young men. Some of my triends in Tracy, Minnesota
and San Francisco are now sponsoring eight at these rehrgee
studean in African high schools. It costs between 100 and 2M
U.S. dollars to educate a student for one year in high school:
Some of these sludents will be qualiﬁed tor U.S. college
studies by next month, and I hope to be able to find enough
tunds from sympathetic sources to bring them over to study
in the U.S. The Grinnel’l College Student Senate has already
endorsed a proposal to have a fast on campus. The money
will go toward this cause.

if you would like to help, please send your contribution,
which will be deeply appreciated and gladly received, to
Dean Richard H. Winters, Grinnell College, Grinnell, town
50112. i will gladly answer any questions to the best ot my
present knowledge of the situation in Southern Sudan.

Dunn Tells D.M. Slums'l
Needs. Accomplishments

By DAVID DlLLON

The most urgent response to the poverty of Des Moines' South-
east Bottoms is to communicate to the residents that they are hu-
man beings, according to Jim
Dunn, director or the Southeast
Side Project which has aided
the citizens in forming a com-

parks and pool halls. Their par-
ents have been reduced by the
same pressures in the Mk-

munity organization. Once they
have been led to recover the
sense of worth the power struc-
ture has denied them, they will
press for improvements in
streets, traffic control, housing.
and plumbing as a natural con—
sequence.

Dunn led a meeting in the
Forum and a later dlnner dis-
cussion with interested students
Tuesday evening. He said that
his experience in community
organization of Chicago’s West
Side had revealed to him the
extent 0! rejection sustained by
youth in poverty areas. Racial
discrimination sharpens this
despair, leading the youth to
term a society of its own in the

ways at subservience, verbaliz-
ing platitudes to the white em-
ployers and landlords on whom
their subsistence depends.

The living conditions on the
Southeast Bottoms were pur-
trayed as unlit on human oc-
cupation, Eighty per cent or
the homes are dilapidated; an
equal proportion have outdoor
toilets. in one area, forty to
titty families obtain water train

City only recently paved an ac-
cess route. A woman house-
holder is becoming ill because
her outdoor toilet is too close to
the well. Several fatal accidents

Valid Generalizations

When is this school going to

time the administration ended
the existence of the Grinnell {lei

but it is one which bears repeat-
ing.

This college is not living up
to its ideals as a liberal arts
college. These ideals should in-
clude e willingness to change,
to evolve, with respect to the
norms which exist and pass
away every moment. But what
do we have? We have a group
of men cast in a mold of Vic-

upon themselves the responsibili»
ty ot determining what the ab
solute truths of college life are.

it does make life rather easy,

though. We don't have to worry
about what we’re going to do
after midnight. it is all decided
for us. We go home and say
“hi” to our friends, study dili-
gently, and go to bed at decent
hours. And, of course, we will
all leave here as decent, up-
standing, well-rested, and unin-
teresting members of our event-
ual and respective communities.

We will build a bigger and
better America, Think of itl

Speaks at SDX Convention

Gallup Calls Vlel Nam Leading Election factor

By HENRY WlLHELM

Dr. George Gallup, speaking
at the Sigma Delta Chi National
Journalism Convention, said a
"protest vole" over Viet Nam
was the most important under-
lying taetor in the nationwide
shift to the Republican Party in
the recent election.

Gallup, Director of The Amer-
lcan Institute of Public Opinion,
and well known for his “Gallup
Polls”, said this vote was not
an expression or disapproval of
the Administratiah's handling of
the war; rather, it was a symp-
tum of the desire. on the part of
the average American, that
some new leadership can be
found which will be able (O ne-
gotiate an honorable withdraw-
al irom Viet Nam. Gallup
claimed that this “Viet Nam
protest vote" was a much more
important factor than “white-
backlash" in most localities. He
said, however, that “white-
backlash” was a signiﬁcant lac—
tor in some cities such as Chi-
cago and in some of the south-
em states.

Former Editor

Dr, Gallup, who attended The
University of lowa and was edi-
tor of the campus paper. made
a sweeping attack on the Amer-
ican political system and on
politicians in general. While not
referring to any statistics, Gal-
lup said, “The public is ted up
with the way we conduct cam-
paigns in this country; they are
fed up with the length ol cam-
paigns, the amount of money
spent. the nameacaliing, and
the avoidance of serious discus-
sion of issues." Gallup sug-
gested that a limit be put on
the amount of money a candi-
date can spend, pointing out
that Rockerieller spent nearly
5 million dollars of his personal
tunds in the New York election.

Distrust of Politics

Citing the current “credibility.
gap," Gallup commented, “our
polls ﬁnd a great deal 01 disr
trust about people in political
life.” He noted that in Eng.
land, where the amount of
money that a candidate can
spend and the length of a cam-

paign is regulated, people gen-
erally have a great deal more
lalth in politics. In a sweeping
statement Gallup said, “Ameri-
can politicians will never, ever
write an issue on a ballot that
makes any sense. They are al-
ways up to their old tricks.
Take the case of the New York
Civilian Review Board: it was
worded in such a way that the
"No” meant “Yes” and the
“Yes” mean! “No". it took a
concerted campaign by the
newspaper's to straighten this
out."
Faith in Public

Gallup said that in his 31 years
at polling tile American public
has made him an “evangelist
of democracy.” He went on to
say “The Public’s opinion is
generally extraordinarily sound
and is generally ahead or
elected leaders in bemg pre-

Scarlel and Blue

pared to make changes in the
political system." lie said the
public is not influenced to any
great extent by billboards, spot
television ads, public handa
shaking, and kissing babies.
Again not giving any statistics,
Gallup said, “we have evidence,
tons of evidence, that bumper
stickers do not generally have
any inﬂuence on the voting pub<
llc." He said that people want
to hear what a politician has to
say on specific issues and “all
of these ancient primitive ritu-
815, such as the national con-
ventions, are a lot a! nonsense

Gallup called tor an open pri-
mary to replace the convention
system pointing out that had
there been on open primary in
the 1964 presidential election.
