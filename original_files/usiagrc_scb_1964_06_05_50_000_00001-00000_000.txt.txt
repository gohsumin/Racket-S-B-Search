Grinneil College seniors were
told Thursday night that “those
arts and sciences which seemed
so impractical during the aca-
demic grind may finally be the
most practical of all your stud-
ies.”

The speaker was the Rev.
Theodore A. Gill, president of
San Francisco Theological
Seminary, who delivered a tra-
ditional baccalaureate sermon
before more than 1,000 seniors,
parents, alumni, and other
friends of the college, in Dar-
by Gymnasium,

The services were followed
by an out-of-doors reception
hosted by President and Mrs,
Howard R. Bowen on the col-
lege campus, V

“This means take seriously
everything you have learned,"
the speaker said. “Let it make
a difference in you, and that is
the way you let it make a dif-
ference in the world. The edu<
cated person is not one who
knows the different facts. The
truly educated person is the
one in whom a difference has

been made by whatever faCts
he has."

man of the Board of Trustees,

after Mr, Bowen himself had
conferred similar degrees on
five candidates.

The citation read in part:
"We need here no review of his
high accomplishment. We should
remember his belief that the
decisions which make an out-
standing college are essentially
acls of iailh." ‘

Mr. Bowen became the sev-
enth president of Grinnell July
I, 1955, and leaves the college
ml the ninth anniversary of his

nell presidency has been

dEnt of the American Tele‘

the graduates to ”. l . . choose
a goal that will strain all your
ability.”

your life is to be truly success
ful,” the speaker said, “but it
must be a dream, not a day-
