Castro-land I

Duringr Christmas Vacation, Jim Gilbert, 21 senior at

Carleton College, spent ten days in what the American,
press calls “Castro-land.“ Since travel to that island is‘

now prohibited by the United States government, Gilbert
and the editors of this paper feel that some of his observa-

tions are worth sharingr with students who are no longer,

permitted to see for themselves what is going on,

_ Together with 380 other Americans, students, houses
\i'ives, working people, businessmen and families, Gilbert
went on a special tour sponsored by the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee.

The stur,’ printed below first appeared in Carleton's
paper The Carletonitln, and caused quite a stir there. At
a coffee hour next Sunday, Gilbert, and Howard Weinstein,
' tirlent f oln Chicago who also iterl Cuba not long ago,
Villl discuss their views 01' the ’land, and slides will be
shown. The presentation will provide seine first hand back-
ground for the coming; Latin American Conference. This
is one you shouldn’t miss.
