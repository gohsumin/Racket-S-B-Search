House

By Ellen Pearce

For those who are complain-
ing about the student-faculty
relations, the staffs of the eco-
non-lics and political science de-
partments have taken a step in
the right direction The Caucus
Room in Carnegie has been the
scene of nickel coffee and in-
formal conversations between
students and professors every
class day morning from 9:30 to
10:30 since last fallr Each of
the professors seems to view
the conversations a little bit dif-
ferently, but most agree they
have been a success for those
who have participated.

The purpose of the coffee
hour is to provide an informal
gemogether for political science
and economics majors and the
professors of those departments
to discuss anything of common
interest. The topics range from
current national and interna-
tional news to campus gripesr
Paul Smith (poll, sci.) sees the
coffee hours as a means of giv-
ing political science majors
more of a feeling of community
and awareness of their field on
a non-professional basis; he 31»
sofeels the discussions should
be used for course evaluation.

Robert Haveman (econ) pre-
fer the coffee hour because he
doesn't like to walk all the way
to the union; besides, “You
know, it‘s nicer when you can
talk to someone." in a more
serious vein, however, both
Haveman and James Magee
(pli. sci.) feel that it is up to
the students to take advantage
of this opportunity. Few stu-
dents have ever given the pro»
gram a try.

Magee sees many possibilities
for the program but'is some
what fearful mat the project
will turn into a concession
stand for Carnegie,

The coffee hour is supposed
to be self-supporting, but i-iaver
man noted that “total cost ex—
ceeds total revenue" Magee
added, “figuring unit cost, total
costs and that sort of thing is
the job of the economics de-
parlment."

As far as suggestions for im-
provement go, Haveman sug-
gested Charging Go a Cup so that

 

a subscription to the New York
Times could be sent to the Cau-
cus Room as a base for more of
the discussions, He feels that
the subjects talked about are
sometimes trite.

Smith suggested that more
women attend.

Student comments had much
greater range. David Burkhold-
or said that he thinks the eco»
nomics department has the best
studentrfaculty Contact and that
the coffee hour Is a contributing
factor. Andy Goldstein said,
“The coffee tastes like mud,
and i've tasted better mud else-
where, But when the profs come
in, it's a hall."
