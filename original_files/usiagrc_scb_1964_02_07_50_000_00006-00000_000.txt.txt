Pioneers Top (0e; To Meet Rams Tomorrow

By Pete Kollman

Grinnell remained in the
thick of the MidWeSL Confer-
ence basketball race with a
hairsraising 73-71 victory over
Coe last Saturday in Darby
Gym, The game was a “must"
for the Pioneers and the win
put them into a second place

tie with Cornell, both teams/

only one game behind league
leading Ripon.

The game started slow with
neither tealn looking particu—
larly impressive, Coe failed to
hit from the field for the first
6 minutes and trailed 10-4 at
that point. Then the Kohawks
began to connect and the game
became a see-saw battle with
the Pioneers in the lead most of
the time. A basket just before
the halftime horn by Dick Ul-
rich, Pioneer guard, sent Grin-
nell to the dressing room with
a 38732 lead.

Affer the half, the game
”see-sawed" again, but the
Pioneers steadily increased
their margin until it reached
ll points with about 10 min-

utes to play. At this point the
game seemed safely in
Grinnell’s hands but the K0-
. hawks fought back and took
the lead with about three and

a half minutes remaining.
Grinnell retaliated with two
buckets to make the score
71-68.

Once again, it looked like the
game was safely won but a
missed free throw and a bad
pass put Coe in possession
trailing 71—70, when Kohawk
guard Dave Collie was fouled.
He sank his first free throw
but his second bounced off the
rim, The jump ball which en-
sued was controlled by the Pio-
neers, who called a time' out
with 23 seconds remaining to
be played. Grinnell waited un-
til 8 seconds showed on the
clock, when Jeff Ftantz shot
from 2|) feet out. The ball
bounded high but Pioneer cen-
ter John Sundell was there to
stuff in the winning basket.

Notable performances for
Grinnell were turned in by co-
captains Jim leilin, who
scored 23 points and got ll re—
bounds, and John Sundell, who
scored 16 and pulled in 24 re-
bounds; and by reserve guard
Ulrich, whose' pass to Mifflin

under the basket enabled the
Pioneers to regain the lead,
69-68, and whose ensuing good
fake and lay-up gave them a
three point hulge. Guard Jim
Eeckman led the Coe scoring
with 20 points.

Bothteams were equally cold
from the field, each shooting
33 percent. Neither team did
much better from the free
throw line with Coe hitting 11,
of 20 for 55 percent andi
Grinnell hittiing only 9 of 43‘
for 39 percent.

Journey to Dubuque University

By Ken Clymcr

Grinnell’s undefeated varsity
wrestlers open the second half
of their season tomorrow with
a non-Conference bout against
Dubuque University on their
mats. Dubuque threatens to
give the Pioneers more com-
petition than they have prev-
iously encountered.

Before Christmas the mat-
men had compiled a 4-0 record
by defeating Lawrence (39-0),
Ripon (3273), Simpson (22-10),
and Warthurg (22-15% With
their best team in years the
Pioneers hope to give peren-
nially strong Cornell a real
battle for the conference chant»
pionship March 6th and 7th.
Last year Grinnell surprised
the whole Conference by edging

out Carleton for the
spot.

At Dubuque, coach Edd
Bowers plans to wrestle Bill
Barnes (123 lbs.), Ken Stub<
ler (130 lbs), Al MacKnight
(131 lbs.), Will Van Home
(147 lbs.), Ken Clymer or
Nick Nonas (157 lbs.), Larry
Miller (167 lbs.), Jeff Lewis
(177 lbs.), and Morgan
Michel (Hwt.). Barnes, Mil-
ler, Lewis, and Stuhler re-
main undefeated in du all
matches so far this season.
Lewis has pinned four oppo-
nents in four matches.

Second place in the Midwest

, Conference basketball race W|ll

be at stake tomorrow evening
when hot shooting Jack Grams
and Dick Calbow and their Cor-
nell College teammates take
the floor in Darby Gym. The
7:30 Contest Will not only break
the second place tie, but it Will
probably drop the loser out of
contention for the Conference
championshlp,

Ripon is leading the race with
an 8-1 mark while Cornell and
Grinnell are both 6-2. Ripon,
however, faces a tough sched-
ule this Week as well. Fourth
place Knox, which defeated
the Redmen last week and res
juvenated Monmouth will be
the visitors.

Grinnell coach, John Pfitsch
is still uncertain about his

starting lineup. Since Kin-

kead’s departure the team
has not been Working togeth-
er as smoothly as before.
He hopes to remedy this with
a few changes. John Sundell,
of course, will Start at cen-
ter with Jim Mifflin at one
forward position. Either Jeff

Frantz or Clyde Smith will

start at the other forward.

Three guards, Dick Ulrich,
Tom Buchholtz, and Dave Sel-
lergren will see a great deal of
action. Pfitsch has been im-
pressed with Ulrich’s play in
the last few games and Buch-
holtz is probably the best out~
side shot, Sellergren has been
a regular starter.

The Rams boast two of the
top scorers in the conference
in Jack Grams, the scoring
leader, with 22.3 points per
game and Dick Calbow who is
averaging 18.1. Dal Zierk and
John Shillinglaw will be the

probable starters at guard with
John Allhaugh at Center. Bob
Moore should also see quite a
bit of action at center as he
is B-ﬁ and may be needed to
guard Sundell.

Cornell uses a zone defense.
the best in the league, while
Grinnell uses a man to man.
Coach Pfitsch is counting on
Sundell to keep Grams from
raising his average, but says
that he is not particularly con-
cerned about the team's de-
tense. “Our biggest worry is
getting the ball through the
hoop."

LaSalle basketball captain
Frank Corace led his team in
scoring last season wlth 441
petnts.
