more ﬁrst places than anyone else. Grin<

Placing first for Grinnell was the mile

relay team, Jeri Langham in the 880-
yard run and in the mile, and Tom Wood
in the javelin. Carleton took a ﬁrst in
the shot put and Monmouth took a tirst

in the 2-mlle run.
Grlnnell was hurt by the loss of Steve

Brinmall, who pulled a leg muscle. Brint-
nall had been expected to place high in
the 440-yard run and anchor the mile
relay team, Had Brinmall run In the
mile relay (an event ci-iiinell won any-
way), that would have released Lang-
ham to run in the 2-milc rim and perhaps
given Grmnell more points there.

Dray, who took a third in the mlIe run
and a ﬁfth in the 2-miIe run. Mlke
