Arts Program for Grlnn || Children

By Mary Malcolm

Whatever it may lack in competence, Chil-
dren‘s artwork easily compensates tor in natural
humor and boldness, An exhibit of the work of
local children will be open to the public March
15 at 1022 Park Street, new home at Grinnell’s
2-year-old Community Art Association.

According to Mrs Howard Burkle, a “found-
ing mother” of the organization, its primary
activity is art programs (or children, With gen-
eral promotion or the arts as a subsidiary aim.
The art program is experimental, stressing op-
portunites for young children to play freely with
many different kinds of artistic materials, to
“let children play so that they are not afraid of
art,” notesMrs. Burkle.

An oriicial incorporated nonpioiit organiza-
liont the Art Association is run by a board of
town businessmen and teachers, while most oi
the work with children is done by Grinnell col~
lege students. Thus the association is a unique
cooperative eiforl among Grinnell townspeople,
faculty and students, “A liason between college
and town."

Children's lessons are offered in art, guitar,
drama and dance. The classes are broken into
age groups In the younger group [here is very
little tormal instruction but great diversity at
materials The children have worked with clay,
wire sculpture, paints and collages created from
natural objects. At this early stage the intent is
exposure to many art media and to the world
which they represent. For older children the
stress falls slightly more on techniques or imita-
tion, although the attention span and co—ordina-
tion of children have natural limits and the

in Ihe dramatic arts, Karyn Zimmerman
teaches a program of creative dramatics for
children ranging irom 1st to 4th grades. Ana-
lagous to Ihe free use of diﬂerent media in the
visual arts, Miss Zimmerman's goal is [0 make
the children at ease and help them discover
their natural creativity, while adding subtle hints
about gestures and techniques. Miss Zimmerman
worked last session with 14 children of wider age
range with a more conventional approach and
concluded the lessons with a production. Credo

duction. ‘

The emphasis leans toward more formal train-
ing in basic dramatic techniques in junior high
classes, according to Max Helfgotll Heligott, as-
sisted by Dennis Rich, works with 20 Children
and anticipates a production at the end of the
session. Last year the junior high group, taught
by Howard Harned, wrote and produced an or-
iginal melodrama.

The Art Assomation is planning to sponsor a
spring art sale, possibly open air. in late May.
Grmnell students, along with artists from Mar-
shalllown, Newton, and Oskaloosa, will be invited
to show their work, according to Mrs. Burkle.

The Park Street house, acquired by the as-
sociation February 15, is being rented from the
college. Publicity for the children’s art classes
through [he public schools has been requested.
The association anticipates gifts of artwork from
various professional and nonproiessional Grinnell
artisu, among them Messrs. Cervene, Burkle,
McMillan and Miss Stemfeld.
