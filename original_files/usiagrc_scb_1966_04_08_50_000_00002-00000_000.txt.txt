More Than Grinnell

We feel that there are things more important than
that which transpires at Grinnell. Because we feel this
way we have an exchange column, we go to Selma and
we do poverty issues and cover peace marches. We
have an active interest in things which involve thous~
ands of other students as well as things which involve
everyone in the country. The Scarlet and Black is com~
mitted to the belief that there is more that can be done
than obsequiously and unimaginatively sitting and
contemplating an indefensibly stagnant status quo.

Because we feel that the status quo at Grinnell is
unsatisfactory and because we feel that there is some-
thing beyond the confines of our “quiet community of
young scholars,” we are starting this week a three-part
series rather grandly entitled: The Liberal Liberal Arts
College and Its Students.

The first part of the series deals with Reed College
in Portland, Oregon (see page 7). The other two parts
will deal with Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
Ind Carleton College in N orthfield, Minnesota

We will admit now that we go into the series with
a bias. The bias is simply that we don‘t believe Grinnell
is making progress towards becoming more liberal. A
kind of preservist attitude prevails. We have chosen
Reed because it is more academically liberal than Grin—
nell. We have chosen Antioch for its unique academic
approach and its liberal social outlook. Carleton was
chosen to show that one can be more liberal than Grin-
nell and still be in the Midwest Conference.

The stories have been written by students at the
colleges under consideration and consequently reflect
a certain lack of objectivity.

We Will not contend that any of the colleges chosen
for examination are perfect. We are not suggesting that
all of the features of these colleges should or could be
incorporated at Grinnell. Rather we ask you — per-
haps implore is a better word — to carefully consider
Grinnell’s attitudes and rules in comparison to the
colleges we are presenting to and for you.

Need ‘Rockei Men'

We’ve waited long enough without saying anything
-and since we missed April Fools’ Day I feel obligated
to mention it. Where the hell are the nine remaining
installments in “King of the Rocket Men”? While the
rest of the country is caught up in low, high, and mass
camp, Grinnell remains uncertain as to what its policy
should be with regard to this phenomenon. We had in
our hands a treasure of the pop art world — an original
"so bad it's good” Hollywood flick—and we’re missing
a tremendous opportunity. We want Rocket Man.

Letters . . .
Anti-Intellectual?

To lhe Editor:

I would like to make one comment with l‘e<
gard lo your editorial concerning the Executive
Council's report on the residence halls. You
are at course entitled to your opinion concern-
ing the report, and I do not wish to argue with
you in this letter. I would like lo point bul, how-
ever, that i see no evidence in the report {or
your comment that {he xepim assumes “Thai
antrinteileclualism runs rampant now on North
Campus.” In considering the matter of rash
dence halls and in writing if: report, the Couna
cil intended to consider possible constructive
changes which would enhance the intellectual
climate of the campus, and not to recommend
punitive measures or to pass judgment on the
plesent situation. 1 submit that a careful read-
ing of the report would make our outlook Clear.

Banal. Disruptive

To the Editor:

There is the unique. the humorous, and the
unusual. Then, there is the ovel‘played, unsa-
pilislicaied, flair falling, hunlorless, ballal,
and disruptive. The latter is characteristic [If
several longstanding traditions at Grinnell
that should have gone out wuh the Boar's
Head Dinner.

Case in pbinl: Monday night’s tapping of
the new members of Mortar Board. As They
say in the Old Country: “Enough is we
much."

Women on lricycles, those parading around
the dining hall simulating the ”family way"
or bedlghted in overalls similar to those of
our esteemed Baa, ringing cow hells through-
out a 45 minute meal, just do not reflect me
high ideals in scholarship and character (he
Mortar Board is supposed to represent. Fun?
I! loo exists, but so does dignity. Humor and
uniqueness have their dignity also.

Life in 'Zoo'

To the Edltnr:

The “iron triangle" analogy excerpted from
Mr. Goddard’s farewell address, and quoted in
the sun, was fascinating. South Pit, Lun'rln
basement, and Cowies Zoo. We’re pleased to
find that Mr. Goddard is so well aware of our
situation. His knowledge at least is not with-
out an investigated basis. After all he does
deliver our paper at 7:00 each morning—how
better to find out what the Zen is really like?
Sublectively speaking, we also ieel that we
got more Votes in the SGA Convention this
year than Mr. Goddard would have. Perhaps
this loo says something.

To the Editor:

mic is u you call "silly boy?” Who is if you
tell to be iree? At our time in life, few are
fortunate enough in be Stephen Dedalus. Can
you expect someone to be Bloom, when few
are yet Stephen? Are you the Molly whn will
he fulfilment for Bloom?

You say talk to you of Sartre; Sartre who
says, “Values are sown an my path as thou-
sands of little, or real demands, like the signs
which order us [0 keep off the grass (L’Etre
et le Neant)." IS it no wonder then that one
will aid: you in a movie, rather than to walk
on the grass? Sartre goes on m say, “Thus
the being or value qua value is lhe being of
what does not have being." When you say to
he free, how do yoll escape this?

Before you-call one “silly boy," remember
the words of Almustafu:

iar you can only be free when even the

desire of seeking freedom becomes a har-

ness to you, and when you cease m speak
of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.

Freedom lhus becomes a fetter to a grealer
freedom, and is no longer value qua value.

when you say, “a day like this and days

Friday. April 3. lm

like it to come are zoo few to spend alone
. . .” it seems that you accuse “silly boy" of
not seeking you out. Yet why do you not seek
lllm out? is to remain anonymous to seek one
am? Are there not many to seek?

To be without another’s physical presence;
is [his to he alone as you intimate? I think
not. As the prophet says, to stand naked in
the soul against the wind, in walk the eanh
with bare feet to feel etc. . . . could one ever
thus be alone? Nor is to whisper a haiku, l0
call u puem — these are iew or many ways
to be with something beyond one's self.

Physical presence, too, is often needed and
very important. But to merely talk of Niela
zsche, Blake, Sartre or spring is homing un<
less there is sharing. To merely talk of ab-
slraction requires no verve, verve that is so
important to live the life you seem to advo-
Cate. Here i can only repeat what you have
said in another way.

Aristotle. rightly i believe, states that to
have knowledge, one must first have experi-
ence. Thus the degree of youth in a person
(in contradislincliun lo maturity) is deter-
mined by the person's experience. Is it no
wonder then that at our age we are all not lo
some degree “silly boys"?

To wade in a pool, to pick some flowers, to
drink some wine, to fly a kite Ihave done
these things many tunes. Yet, i am siill a
“silly boy.” In the world I live in here at
Grinnell, I find the Values are sown along my
path almost wherever I siep to find experla
ence and knowledge. I have found few to seek
and still fewer who seek. “Silly girl,” why
do you not seek me and the many like me
here? We have kites, bare feet, desires . . .

To the Editor:

These two silly boys will be glad to go ily a
kite with Miss Anonymous — ii there are no
strings attached.

Another Proposal

Ed. Nine: the following ls an excerpt min
I letter written by Craig Allin to the Ad Hoc
Committee an “all hmgmlnuon uni Presi-
dent Glenn Leggelt. It is in response (a on
proposals of the Executive Council.

1. Setting Up Freshmen Hall! . . . Freslh
men integration to campus life requires pri-
mary group experience which includes mem-
bers of the other Classes . . . Imagine a col»
legersupporfed system of psychological prep-
ping-hyrsegregation.

2, Assignment to Upperclass Hulls . . . the
Council has proposed a similar that mun
surely n'val rushing In the magniiude of lln<
wanted results.

3. Structure of Upperclass Halls . . . i! one
may assume that These (interest) “groups"
Will be assigned to balls as ireshrnen groups
are to be. it will result in small cliques mov-
ing about together, never becoming fully inte-
grated into any hall . , . The change in elee.
tion procedure to an appointive balllehoarrl-
type system will produce no practical change
In rule euioreemenl or hail goveming but will
serve 10 rob the students bi their right [0 else:
their leaders.

4, Provisions for Certain Uppercluss Students
. . i can only point out that “language
ﬂoors” have H1 the past constituted some of
the most rigid cliques Grinneii has witnessed.

5. Student Government. This proposal Seems
aimed at eiﬁuency. Abolition of the Student
Senate and the Primary Court system in fa-
VDr 0f the Coil-[P and the AWS Board is \‘Bl'y
efficient But what about the opportunities
for student participation on a campus where
every opportunity lur maturing responsibly is
stifled?

6. Other Matters . . . Advisers can be a
Valuable aid to the Student insofar as they
help the Student make the decisions of MP
parlance.
