LEGGETT 0N
GONVOOATION

President Leggett, addressing
the Senate informally, expressed
his support for a human values
course. “It's a marvelous idea,"
he said, noting, however, that
it will probably take a long
push to obtain {acuity approval.

Leggett feels that the ieculty
may balk at substituting it for
existing r e (1 u l r a d ireshman
courses or adding human val-
lies to the present course load.
He also noted that introduction
oi such a course may neces‘
sitate hiring faculty members
who specialiu in ethics,

Leggett also briefly discussed
administration rationale regard-
ing Homecoming - Convocation.
Affirming the indirect financial
motivations for the Convoca-
tion. he said. “What is at issue
is the future of colleges like
this i’m trying to broaden the
basis oi support. l'm trying to
ghow oil the college to them
(potential contributors)."

Small liberal arts colleges
Iuch as Grinnell, Leggett ex-
plained, face increasing com.
petition from major state uni-
versities that now combine both
guallty and quantity.

The upcoming Convocation
Is without precedent, "There
are all kinds or things we can
he to make a splash," Leggett
said. “Mr, Stauss, Mr, Wall.
and i decided to do it on the
basis oi massive qualityi"

Answering a suggestion that
it is easy to attract big names
It enough money and honorary
degrees are preferred. he ex-
plained that the dignitaries are
not getting paid much more
than their travel and living
expenses.

“As for degrees," he added,
“obtaining them is no problem
for people like Martin Luther
King, Ashley M o n t a gu. and
Marshall McLuhan,"

He estimated overall expense

MONEY WON’T TALK

CONVO COSTS

College Treasurer Donald
Lambio and Director of Devel‘
opment James Avison told the
Side they could not pinpoint
the definite source oi money
used to ﬁnance Convocation,
but noted that expenses will
necessitate an increase in giits
to balance the budget

“The Convocation will be ii<
nanced largely out oi gifts,”
Lamble said.

Avison, however, had previ«
ously noted that the develop-
ment budget includes funds
that may be used for Convo-
cation.

He declined to specify their
source.

Anticipated iunds for a given
iiscal year are budgeted among
the various college oiilces, Avi-
son said. “Convocation is one
oi many items on which the
budget money will be spent."

Avison was reluctant to es-
timate the total cost at
the Convocation at Wednesda
night‘s Senate meeting in All .

President Leggett, speaking
informally at the same meet-
ing. said he estimated the cost
at the weekend at $20,090.

MONTAGU AND GILMAN TO PARTICIPATE

ANN-WAR RALLY PLANNED
FOR SUPER WEEKEND

By NEIL FISCHER

An anti-war rally-including
Grinneil Chairman of Faculty
Joseph Wail. Princeton Univer<
sity anthropologist Ashley Mon-
tagu, and Yale University
drama professor Richard Gil-
man as participants—has been
approved for 1 - 2 pm. Sunday,
October 29, on Barber Plaza,

Oiiicials oi the Grinnell Stil-
dant Movement (GSM) said that
the rally would "serve as a
culmination oi the GSM's pres-
ent anti-Vietnam activities on
campus"

Montagu and Giiman will ad-
dress an ekpected group at
several hundred students iol~
lowing an introduction by Wall.

Roth visiting proiessora will
sign a GSM anti-war petition.
The petition began circulating
Tuesday among the Grinnell
community.

Gilman wrote to Deslonde
Lamb—a worker on the GSM'S
Vietnam Committee—Tuesday
stating that he would “be happy
to make a . . . speech."

Montagu had previously writ‘
ten the GSM that he would
participate providing President
Leggett considered the move
“proper" during his visit here
during Convocation.

Leggett last Thursday told
Ron Millar—B Vietnam Com«
mittee representative—that “. .
. .what Mr. Montagu does with
his time is his own business,"
“He's his own man,” Leggett
said.

The Vietnam Committee pe-
tition states that the present

war is “immoral and a uso< '

less loss oi lives.”

It further lists three points
agreed to by all who sign:
that bombing oi Vietnam—North
ﬁnd South—should cease; that
the 1L 5. should declare a uni-
lateral cease-lire; and that the
Ui S. should recognize that the
National Liberation Front has
significant support in the South
and should be allowed to no-
gotiate.

Copies oi the signed petition
will be mailed to President
Johnson. Secretary Rusk. Sec-
retary McNamara, S e n a to r
Fullbright, Senator Robert Ken-
nedy, and several other sena-
tors and representatives on the
Armed Services committees.

Miller said that possible pr
ldential candidates (Romney.
Rockefeller, Nixon. Percy, etc,)
would also be sent copies.

He added that students will-
