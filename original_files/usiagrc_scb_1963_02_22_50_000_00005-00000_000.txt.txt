The Services rendered to stu-
dents by a college are many
and varied, Not the least at
,thcse is the college bookstore
,whei-c Spearmint gtun rubs cl-
thaws with "The History of Cin

The bookstore was established
ncar the turn oi the century to
aid Gt‘ii‘il‘iell Students in procur-
ing supplies and textbooks not
available in local stores. This
store was originally a “books
iroom" an was open only at the
beginning oi the semesters ior
ldisti-ibution oi textbooks Soon
the Operation expanded into
school supplies.

“For many years the book-
store was located in the north
basement oi Carnegie where it
was affiliatsd with the niaili‘uum.
In 1956 the complctc operation
was moved up to the ﬁrst floor
of Blair Hall, which used to
bC nCzll‘ thC site of the present
Fine Arts Center. With the imc
minent, demise of Blair Hall in
1960, the present area oi Car—
negie Hall was remodeled tor
bookstore occupancy, and the
Trustees invested in a new set
of ﬁxtures. It was at this time
that the bookstore adopted Self~
service,” said Samuel J. Was“
soin, manager oi the bookstore.

Wassoln, who has managed
the bookstore since 1948, is aid-
ed by a regular stair oi two
employees. Temporary employees
are hirEd to help cope with the

semester. A11 personnel are on

In a historical perspective the

would actually be a “reuniﬁca-
