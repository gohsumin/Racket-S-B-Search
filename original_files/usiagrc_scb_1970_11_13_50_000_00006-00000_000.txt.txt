Unfortunately, they had to
admit that Riverview is a uni'
que institution. Apparently,no
such Others of Riverview‘s
quality exist in the country.
The men felt this a terrible
injustice to others not so for
tunate as they, who have no
chance to readjust before be
ing thrust into society. They
pointed out that quite a bit of
social change occurs when a
man is behind bars for 25,10,
or even 2 years. They figured
that this was a large factor
contributing to multiple-
crime convictions, statingthat
about 42% of men who have
spent long periods of time in
hard- core institutions return
to criminal activities, while
only about 4-10% of those re-
leased after six months or
more of readjustment at Riv-
erview commit future crimes.

When asked what they felt
should be done about stateand
federal penal practices, they
agreed that more release cen-
ters such as Riverview should
be built. McDaniel felt that,
eventually, most penitentiar-
ies should be phased out in
favor of the release center
approach. He believed that
penalties for first-offenders
should be increased, to ena
able them to reevaluate them~
selves and to make use of the
counseling services which wo—
uld be made available to them.
He continued with a proposal
to increase second-offense
sentences, to serve as incen-
tive for firstroffenders to
reorient themselves the first
time, rather than slowly, after
many convictions, or never at
all;

When asked if they were at
all bitter about what society
had done to them, they ans-
wered “No," to a man. They
agreed that they had felt bit—
terness at first, but that, as
time had gone on, their atti»
tudes had changed toward th~
eir captors. They felt that
time had softened their bit-
terness and had replaced it
with a determination to ad-
just to the society they had
left. They were grateful for

The night of Saturday, Oct.
24, Cowles dining hall was
the scene of yet anOther ofthe
famous SAGA record-shatter-
ing eating displays. Folloiw
ing on the heels ofMarkHam-

North Younker residents Ch-
arles Brichford, Steven Ad-

son, and Langan resident Don
Dagenais demolished the res
cord of the number of SAGA
strawberry shortcakes cone
sumecl during the course ofa
meal (the old record: 46, a
9.2 per person average). In a
mere 40 minutes, the quintet
downed not only their steak
dinners, but no fewer than 50
shortcakes (led by Steven Ad-
ams' record-tying l3 consu-
med), a 10.0 per person aV’
erage. At the conclusion of the
feat, the Younker four engaged
in a race back to the dorm,
climaxed by the sudden ape

Mogee Describes Stay In Ethiopia

"Ethiopia is a fascinating
place, but it is a very closed
society; they keep foreigners
at a distance,” saidDr. James
Magee, Grinneil's resident
expert on African economic
cooperation. "Its government
is very similar to the feudal
societies of Europe in the 14th
and 15th centuries; although
they do have lightbulbs and
modern weaponry and such,
the structure of the economy
is very backward." Magee,
who is also an Associate Pro»
fessor of Political Science
here, was describing his ex
periences in Ethiopia during
the first six months of 1969.
For the past year and a half,
Magee has been on leave from
Grinnell, the first semester
on an ACM noanestcrn study
grant, the last year on a sab-
batital.

His first six months were
spent in Ethiopia doing re*
search at the headquarters of
the U.N. Economic Commis
sion for Africa. His arrivalin
late January ofl969 fortunater

ly occurred during the tenth
anniversary session of the
Economic Commission. As a
result Magee found the visit
a "very exciting"experience,
since the convention was con-
cerned directly with his own
specific area of interest.

His last year of leave was
spent at New York and at Fri
inceton, where he studied the
nature of the problem inmore
detail and also did research
at the United Nations.

Magee feels that one of the

economies is that they do not
have sufficiently large markv
ets to justify the construction
of large firms which could take
advantage of economies ofch
ale. The creation of anecono~
mic union between countries,
accompanied with the break-
ing down of tariff barriers,
would expand the market in
order that such factories could
be built, thus helping Africa
to climb out of the depths of
their present situation, which
he describes as that of “sub
sistence peasant economies."

He sees the chance of formr
ing such a union, however, as
being very small. Newlyrinr
dependent nations are “jeal-
ous of their sovereignty" and
suspicious of each other. Sm-
all countries tend to feel that
the larger countries (such as
Nigeria) would dominate such
a union, while larger countries
out of spite tend to boycott
the idea. Such suspicions pre-
vent any real progress when
the bargaining gets down to
such details as the location of
the factories.

Magee sees the nature of Af-
rican politics as basically
”unsettled." The military has

political force than in thepast.
