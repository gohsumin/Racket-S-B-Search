Resioraiion Singers “Catch 0n" é

By JEFF DUNN

As those who attended the
Forum Catawba Dltliyramb last
semester Will know, the “Catch
Club” is ﬂat Major Albert
Omer’s division of the Faculty
Softball Team, but rather a
gang oi “profs" that spends
most or its time “wining and
wenching" ~ musically, that
ls—with Malcolm Nelson (Eng-
ﬁsh)

The Dithyramh ieatured ihe
ﬁrst Griunell periorniance or
that group —— more formally
known as Restoration Catch
singers — who are devoted to
the rendition oi those peculiar
sort of seventeenth century
rounds as “Catches”.

Since that highly successful
display oi musicianship, the
Cathers in roadtrip recitals have
caught on among students oi
Luthers and Graceland colleges.
And now, world weary, they
have iortumately consented to

sing again in the Forum to‘
night.

The club members are strict-
ly music history hurts. Mr. Nel-
son, who organized the singers
from the faculty, has made
extensive researches via Uni-

versity Microfilms in order to
locate unexpurgated editions,0i
catches for the hobby which
has fascinated him since 1952i
He describes the “catch” as
“a sophisticated canon in three
or four parts usually dealing
with women and wine. It is un-
accompanied polyphony tor
male Voices; and the text oiten
contains puns or obscenitles
which are emphasized, or even
created by the music.”

A catch diilers from a true
round or canon in that parts
are not necessarily duplicated
in all voices and tend to catch
up with one another toward the
end oi the composition, finishr
ing on a unison (hence the

name “catch”), The catches
had their most common usage
in men’s drinking clubs of the
Restoration and later (hence
the restricted range of topics;
(Are there any other?)

The major purpose of the Re‘
storation Catch Club ~— how-
ever professional its outrofeiown
bookings may seem — is to have
a good round of fun for all con-
cerned. Although parts can be
difficult and need close cor-
ordination (and straight iaces!),
Mr. Nelson does not wish to
be maestro to his singers.
Within certain limits, all sing-
ers are expected to sustain their
own individuality of line, It is
amazing how well this demo<
cratic approach fosters spon-
taneity oi periormance.

Other members of the group
include Givens Thornton (psy-
chology). George Eastman
(education), Robert Canary
(English) and Charles Sellers
(Assistant to the President)

Examining produce in an open—air marketplace in Lisbon is one way to broaden one’s knowl~
edge of the ways of the Portuguese people. These girls found exploring the nlnrkcls or cities around
the world a relaxing change from studies undertaken during a semester at sea on Chapman College's
noating compute now called World Campus Aﬂoat.

former Peace Corps Volunteer, ﬁrst pursued graduaie sludies in International Relations and re-
turned a second semester as a teaching assistant in Spunish on the world-circling campus.
