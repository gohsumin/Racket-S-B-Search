The confusion which is
lunning rampant across the
country concerning the fall-
out shelter issue appears to
be plaguing Grinnell College
and its Board of Trustees as
well.

The Federal government
has, in the past few months,
urged institutions Such as ‘Grln—
hell to install fallout shelters
in available areas. At about the
same time students here voted
against such a proposal by a
slight margin, the College Board

lof Trustees discussed the prob~

lem.

In February it was decided
to postpone any decision con-
cerning the installation of a

motions against immediate afe
firmatron of continuing member
ship were made.

The first. by Bob Benowicz,
was a motion to postpone decis-
ion on the matter for one week
during which an impartial com.
mittee would be formed to
weigh the merits of joining. This
motion was not passed. Last
week while an evaluation of
Grinnelrs port in the NSA was
read, senator-s left the meeting
one at a time until there was no
longer a quorum.

fallout shelter at Grinnell. The
reason, according to President
Bowen, was a general confu-
sion among the members of
the Board as to the value of
such an installation.

In an interview this week,
Grinnell Vice President Merritt
C. Ludwig said that the out
come of the student poll played
no part at all in the Board’s
decision. Ludwig went on to
say that the postponement would
be an indefinite one, depending
upon Changes in the “interna-
tional situation." President Bow-
en could not say whether Pres~
ident Kennedys decision to re-
sume atmospheric nuclear test
ing would be a factor which
would necessitate a reconsidera-
tion by the Board of Trustees.

In answer to another ques—
tion. Ludwig stated that the

at Grinnell House.

of scholar-ship, leadership, and
service to compose the 1962-63
Mortar Board, are Lynda Bray-
‘rnan, Frances Holland, Peg
Martin, Carol Miller, Nancy Lee
Norton, Myrna Sumption, Sue
Toenges and Carolyn West.

The second motion was
made by John Williams who
strongly suggested that the
issue he handed to a committee
which would submit the ques-
tion to a student referendum.
This too was voted down.

A final attempt to postpone
the vote on whether or not Grin—
nell should remain a member of
the NSA as made by John Pil-
grim, who moved to postpone
the question indefinitely

One reason why a postpone—

in their plans would not cause
the College to include such
plans in the construction of
the proposed Student Union.

So it seems, for the present
at any rate Grinnell College
will be “shelterless and the
confusion surrounding the issue
will continue to exist. The policy
for the future will be one of
cautious, “watchful waiting."

spring solicitation will begin
Monday with a dinner for. rep.
resentatives res onsible for the
drive in-each all. The drive,
held each spring, will continue
Iuntil Monday, May 7, and will

Some of these projects were re.

ment was atempted is that some
persons felt that not enough stu-

possibly because not enough
students were familiar with the
NSA and .the services it pro.
vides.
immediately after the vote
was taken, a brief recess was
called At the end of the recess
there was no longer a quorum
so the meeting was adlouined.

ly scheduled to follow the NSA
issue, was rescheduled for next
Wednesday.
