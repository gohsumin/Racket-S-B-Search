This Saturday night (7:30)'
and Monday (8:00) there will
be showings in ARK of Akita
Kurosawa’s The Lower Depthsl
I originally requested this film
for a class assignment for
Drama {11, to be coupled with
a reading by the steti ot Gorky’s
play and followed by inevitable
discussions at the possibilities
of the (Wu media (drama and
film) and the cultural differen-
ces implied by Kurosawa's han-
dling oi the Russian play

Now the film is to be made
public and l’ve been asked to
say something about it. First,
it is by one of Japan’s leading
film makers. It is not his most
influential. That was probably
Rashiminn, which started the
West's interest in Japanese
film; nor is it his best, which
might be Throne oi Blood, lki-
ru, or The Drunken Angel; nor
his best satiric film, which has
to be his endrall comment on
the American Western, Yojimbo,
which was shown this last week
end in ARHi

But it is one at his great
films and you should enjoy it
first, then judge Kurosawa's
reputtatlon as an artist, Much
ink is spilled about this film
maker’s alternation of stillness~
and-action, his fascination with

in support of her position,
she refers to at least one na-
tional questionnaire, and her
personal conversations w i t h
many psychiatrists and other
Deans oi colleges.

Prominent a m o n g these
sources is Dr. Famsworth, as
sociated with Harvard Univer—
sity and M.I.T. In a conversa-
tion with her last year, he indi-
cated that, given a choice, a
college should not institute
open dorms. As a professional
psychiatrist with much experi-
ence with college students, he
said bluntly: “Bedrooms and
balhrooms should remain seg-
regated.”

Dean Low turther pointed out
that obviously, the fact that
few colleges have open dorms
indicates the degree of opposi-
tion to them

Asked about datinitlve works
on the subject, she said that
because the question is so new,
there have really been no con-
clusive studies made. Even if
there were such information.
she cautioned against a reli-
ance an outside studies of sla-
tistics, warning that, because
at the great difference in col-
leges, a study in another col-
lege might not necessarily
have relevance to this college.

Considering the available in-
formation, Dean Low sees no
evidence that open dorms aid
the academic processes, and
she stated that any innovations
at Grinnell would be made with
the goal in mind oi improving
the academic processes,
