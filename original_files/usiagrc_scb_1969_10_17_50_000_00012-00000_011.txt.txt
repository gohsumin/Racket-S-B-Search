FRED HAMPTON, ILLINOIS BLACK PANTHER PARTY CHAIRMAN, speaks at demonstration outside Cook County Hospital. Over 400
protesters attended the Friday afternoon rally. Hampton called for "health care to meet the needs of the people."

"The health care system in this
country is going to be changed by the
people, and they (the doctors) can work

"‘with us or against us.” The doctors have

ered a lengthy tirade against the demon—

strators. The speaker, a young black
wmnan, told the group "You are all
fanatics, you donIt know what you are

to decide." ' ' jdoing."

”Doctors have a role here —— a
definite role —— but they are going
to have to decide whether they are
part of the problem or part of the sol—
ution."

Ronald Satchum, Deputy Minister of
Health of the Black Panthers, described
the free health clinic. He explained
that the center was being opened to
"heighten the contradicitions existing
in the capitalist system, to point out
that the only solution is socialism.

Satchum said that the Panthers
"strongly believe that the health
institutions — that all institutions -
should be controlled by the people of
the community in which they are lo—
cated."

In telling of the origins of the
"People's Health Clinic," he empha—
sized that "we went to the people
first, and asked them what kind of
services they wanted most. When they
told us, those were the services we
worked hardest to develop first."

He said that work on the clinic,
though delayed by financial problems
and harassment, was almost completed
and that volunteer staff members were
being secured.

Fred Hampton also spoke and a short
guerilla theater skit was presented
contrasting health service at the
County Hospital and the Panther clinic.

After scheduled speakers had fin~
ished, it was announced that the micro—
phone would be opened to any who wished
to speak. Several members of the aud—
ience came forward, one of whom deliv—

"What right do you have to demand
a free health service? ‘Do you know how

much it costs to get a medical education?"'

JYou want to tear down the power elite,
but what do you put in its place?" she
asked.

"THE PEOPLE!"

The rally disbanded shortly after—
wards and Mike Klonsky again cautioned
the group against confrontations with
the police and advised them to leave in
groups of four and five. The crowd
quickly dispersed, although discussions
among some participants at the rally
continued for a short time thereafter.

Earlier on Friday the Weathermen
moved out of their main movement center
eat McCormick seminary. A carefully
worded, neatly typed note explained
"An arrangement has been reached b
the National Action Committee (NAG of

SDS and the McCormick Theological
Seminary, whereby no further use of

these facilities will be made during
the National Action by SDS." A
Weather Bureau member later said simply
"we were forced to give up the center."

The Weatherman central office told
demonstrators to go to two new movement
centers in Evanston, the Wheeden Metho—
dist Church and the Covenant Methodist
Church. Students had stayed at the
churches the previous night after leav—
ing the Garrett Seminary.

A contingent of about 60 Weathermen
were at the Wheeden Church under the
leadership of the Ohio collective.

The groups with the Chicago collective,

now numbering over 200, met at the
Covenant Church.

‘, At the Covenant Church a seven hour

'general meeting took place as demon—

strators debated both tactics and
philosophy in preparation for the
saturday action. The discussion was
not_as well organized as_the previous
night, due mainly to the lack of natiore
al leadership.’

The Weathermen began by reiterating

; much‘of the philosophy of their faction '

for the benefit of several new members
who had only recently arrived.

The demonstrators again evaluated
previous actions and sought to under—
stand the necessity for following
through with the planned march on Sat—
urday although they were certain to
face suicidal odds. One collective
leader pointed out that the newspapers
had led the public to believe the
Weathermen had been crushed by the
police. "It's important to show them
that that is not true. We've got to
show them that even those of us who
have been busted or messed up are
ready to back out on the streets and
off the pig. Many of the people in
this room are out on bail and face
four or five charges already, but that
isn't going to stop them. We're going
to go out tomorrow and tear the mother—
fucker down."

A leader from the New York collect—
ive said that "the fact that they have
called out the National Guard is a vic—
tory. Why is it a victory — because for
every soldier they bring in here, that‘s
fewer than can vamp on our brothers in
Vietnam, our brothers in Lr.in America,
in the ghetto. For every soldier they
bring in here, that's more breathing
space for our brothers."

‘Tn a funny sort of way," he added,
"the more they vamp on Weatherman, the
more they oppress us, the more Weather—
