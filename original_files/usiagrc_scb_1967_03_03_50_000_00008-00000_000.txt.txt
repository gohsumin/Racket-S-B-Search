and it does not have to mean
collectivization. Although our
social artistry is much less de
veloped than our command oi
physical nature, our growing use
at tools might make social art-

ists of us.

The aiiluent societies created
by the cybernetic age may be
characterized by the surplus 01
money and resources that are
available ior social goals. There
is a rise in both skill and re-
training requirements. Educa-
tion is‘consistently replacing
business as our major institu-
tion.

Religion Needs Explaining

Religion and the divine must
now be explained, not explained
away. Mesthene says religious
experience is too persistent a
fact of history and human na-
ture to dismiss. While the con-
tent of truth changes as the
World does. the function does
not. Value changes, valuing does
not. Religion satisﬁes man’s
ability to see, act and unity.
it is a common vision oi what
man could be if he were so
human that he would be no
longer physical. God is maker
and ultimate purpose. Man is
pure artist. God is what man
has made him with his tools
and because of man’s use oi
these tools, it is his best work.

In a subsequent interview
With the 5&3, Dr, Mesthene
commented on those jobholders
that will be displaced by the
increasing demand ior skills.

The LM. basketball season is
iinally dragging to a close and
a new champion has been
crowned. Dibble swept through
the last half or the season to
finish with a 19-1 record. The
Dibble “A" team was the only
quintet in either league to flu-
ish undefeated. Gates “B" lin-
ally broke their loss string at
thirty~nine games by beating
Cowles “B”, 37-32. The game
was witnessed by a crowd
nearly equal to those at the
varsity games.

He said it is up to the younger
generations to realize that jobs
have always changed as so«
cieties progressed, and to edu<
Cate themselves for these
changes, not blindly follow the
paths ot their tathers. Many
of the new opportunities for em-
ployment will he available in
the service occupations depend
ing on the society's degree of
aiiluence. Grinneli should pre-
pare its students for the cyber-
netic age by emphasizing the
values of our society in our
courses,

Dr. Mesthene expressed his
faith in man’s ability to use
his increasing technological
prowess to maintain his exist-
ence and advance his abilities
in a universe whose natural
law seems to oppose this pro-
