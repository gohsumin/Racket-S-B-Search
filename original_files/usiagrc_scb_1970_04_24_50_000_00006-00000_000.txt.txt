honesty and juslice and a

mean the colleges and univer
sities ior some proiessors are iust

as weak or ruthless in promoting
their own interests at the expense
at their colleagues, by pei‘r

iorming acts which in llieir
younger days they regarded as
unworthy oi the protession and
even despicable. To quote the
“master oi them that know,"
concerning youth, “Young men
have exalted notions because
they have not yet been humbled
by tile or learned its necessary
limitation, they would rather do
noble deeds than useful ones;
their lives are regulated more by
moral teeting than by. reasoning;
all their mistakes are in the
direction or doing things exe
cessively and vehemently; they
love loo much and hate too much,
and they think they know
everything and are always quite
sure of it, lor which reason they
overdo everything,"

Inshort,. what colleges need
these days ot academic turmoil
is less “personal morality", less
yielding to unreasonable
demands, and more and more

class discussion of ethical issues,
What is the nature of the good,

what is happiness, what is virtue,
what is the aim of life, what is
the aim of education? By
definition, students are in
colleges to learn. Accordingly.
they must submit to learning and
not claim authority to knowledge
and act upon it On the other side,
teachers are in colleges to leach,
and ethics is just as important
as chemistry and literature. A
teacher in ethics should have
arguments for certain kinds of
actions as being pi-eierable to
certain other kinds, and raise
questions on diiticult issues. A
course on ethics should be a
discussion and not it led
ture course. resembling the
discussions in Agora and Plato’s
Academy There will be many
unresolved problems, but the tent
should be set. and an atmosphere
or inquiry and learning should
prevail. and not an atmosphere
oi dogma and action, The come

difficulties in having such
courses are acknowledged, but a
beginning is better than no
beginningatall.

One theoretical difficulty is due
to the varieties of assumptions
concerning lite, Happiness for an
atheist is limited to this life, but
a believer will-have to define
happiness in terms oi eternity;
and there are differences even
among hclicvers. Nevertheless,
all or them have something in
common: ior example, all agree
on being just, on promoting
the intellectual and social values,
and, in general, on treating in-
dividualsras ends in themselves
rather than as instruments to be
used for one‘s own ends. And if
diiierences exist, pr udices are
more likely to dim ish if the
various assumptions are made
known and discussed, for some
respect and tolerance for dite
ferent assumptions is likely to
follow.

As for physical education and
health, they are well taken care
or in most colleges. Next, we shall
proceed with the final part,
