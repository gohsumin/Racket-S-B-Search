Huber, Brown report on Principia peace talks

Says Uniteol Sial’es must maicll
Soviets' ideological appeals

by Phil Brown

Henry A. Kissinger states the
lollewing in his book “Nuclear
Weapons and Foreign Policy":
“Foreign policy has its exprcs~
sion in the judgment oi iacts 7
the judgment that we exercise in
discriminating among them.”
One of the central topics oi de-
bate at the Pi-iiicipia College
Public Aiiairs Conierence was.
the relevance oi moral analys
and judgments to the issues in-
volved in nuclear politics.

Seville Davis, Chiei Editorial
Writer ior The Christian Science
Monitor. said the common con.
iusion between a moral or ctliis
cal view oi politics and a view
based on political and economic
consideration leads to emotion.
alism and a distortion oi the true
picture oi a world engaged in a
deadly battle oi power politics.

An example oi this is the
built—in deception or the dis.
armament probleiu The masses
oi people in the United States
not only desire disarmament, but
have internalized their wish and
pushed it into the rcalm oi the
conscience. By considering (llSr
armament as a moral issue or
ethical stand, one transiorms
what what is in reality a politir
cal judgment into a moral posir
tion and. in a larger sense, an
expression oi opinion toward the
behavior of the Soviet Union.

The person who conceives oi
the politics and power oi the
nuclear age in terms oi the
abuses oi love and compassion
is headed toward a philosophy
oi appeasement which is in-
consistent with the preserva—

tion oi our democratic society.

Davis envisions the moral
problem or iorclgn policy as cenr
tering around, the positive and
negative aspects oi strength and

criniinating in the right use oi

end must be that lirmness and
decency are compatible,

The two opposing questions
which appear to rise out oi this
general stand are (1) How can a
hmit be placed on the degree oi
iirmness which the U. S. will use
in preserving itseii as a iree and
independent country? and (2)

tion spanned the iull range oi
moral and political judgments.
“The primary objective oi the
United States is preserving the
American way oi hic, ii neces-
sary, at the expensc or peace."
This was the morals-subordinat—
ed answer oi one commission.
Other individuals, however, held
the ulti-amoi-alistic position oi
paciiism: “It is better to suiier in
doing the right than to inilict
suiiering in doing the wrong,"

Although the entire conference
was oriented in the direction or
the iii-st answer, the important
value which i, and most or the
conierees, received was having
to iace squarely the problem oi

ship of newly elected Speaker
Terry Parssiiien, the student
senate adopted some amendr
ments to the women’s house
rules (pages 47—52 in the 1961-
62 student handbook). The rule
changes were sponsored by Jill
Dennington, retiring AWS board
president. As amended, the first
paragraph oi article HI section
A reads as follow,

“The loggia and Mcars doors
are locked at 10:30 pm. Sun-
day through Thursday nights
The lights in the loggia will be
blinked ﬁve minutes beiore it
is locked and a warning bell
rung three minutes lbeiore clos—
ing hours, The lights will be
blinked at lelin i-iall entrance
by the night check girl rive and
two minutes beiore iinal closing
hours, which will be determined
by the Main Hall clock, Lack
oi the time trainings will not
be considered a legal excuse ior
lateness.” The last sentence was
added because it was pointed
out that the time signals are
only a convenience and might
not be exactly on time, or on
rare occasions might be entirely
omitted.

Article in section A—Z.a. has
been rewritten to provide a
change in lateness penalties.
“Main hall entrance will be
locked at midnight
through Friday and at 12:30
am. Sunday (Saturday night).
Any woman arriving aitcr the

considered late, The normal

hall. Men leaving the Quad—
rangle through the Main Hall
entrance aiter the loggia and
Mom doors have been locked
will incur the regular lateness
penalty ior their dates."

This change was contested
by the representative from
James on the ground that since
the library closes at 11:30 and
women's hours are 12 put, any
violation would be ior social
reasons, thus no distinction
should be made in determination
or penalties. in answer, Jill Delia
nington pointed out that more
violations occur on weekends
Some discontent was voiced
over the provision that a wom-
an could be subject to a penalty
causcd, not by herscli, but by
her dates tardiness in leaving.

5 that iii-any disarmament mover

because such movements make
Russia think that the United
States may not be willing to re»
sist aggression,

“To the degree the Russians
believe that there are groups in
the U. 5. who would do every
thing to prevent nuclear war,
Russia is encouraged to use 100
megaton blackmail,” he added.
(These statements are echoed in
Kissinger's latest book, “The
Necessity For Choice,” in which
he says the course oi the cold
war depends not only on the
military strength of each side but
also on its willingness to use that
strength.)

Kissinger said that “what lit
tic chance there was [or a test
ball was eliminated by those
peace groups who said we should
accept any Russian propo- 1,"
because these demands climinab
ed our negotiation position in
regard to Russian proposals.

“If we think history is work

is to sunlvc," Kissinger said.
But history is not on our side, “It
