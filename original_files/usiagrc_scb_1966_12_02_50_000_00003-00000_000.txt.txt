Senate Supports Student Leaders
Cites ’lnconsisiencies’ in Policy Areal

By DON WINNEY

The Senate overwhelmingly
passed n resolution Wednesday
night expressing support for
the actions of the Executive
Cabinet and the joint house
presidents. The resolution, in-
iroduced by Hank Balikov,
read:

Whereas the Executive Cab«
luet has acted with tho ut-
most deliberation in demon-
strating the student body‘s
concern with the panalty
handed the 3 suspended stu-
dents and the need for cloth
lication in the policy area;

And whereas the present
violation and penalty was
simply an example of the
basic lnconsislencis of in-
iraction and punishment in the
policy area;

And whereas by petition
and group meeting the Execu-
tive Cabinet informed the stu-
dent body or the reasons he-
hlnd the proposed action and
the timing of dist action;

The Senate indicates its
concern over the existing Sit-

stillborn, an experimental
film by New York Universliy
students will be shown in the
Forum on Monday, December
5, The camera work, editing
and acting, as well as the di-
rection, are completely nunrpl'oA
fessional. For a student produc-
tion the film has had a great
deal of commercial Success in
experimental theaters on both
coasts. The plot, if a surrealis-
tic film can have a 'plot’, deals
With the mourning remem~
brunce of a dead romance. Two
young people meet on a barren,
deserted plain. The boy is then
carried through a series at
dream sequences revolving
around boui the girl and on
failure of the relationship.
Finally the boy is delivered to
(remembers) the relationshlp’s
beginning. This central scene,
in which black and while are
reversed, works superbly to
embody the irashnass and
beauty of the inception at tho
romance. What keeps the film
tmm slipping into either insipid
sweetness or avantrgarde con-
fusion ls the Camera work. The
delicacy and precision of the
cimematography are in diam.
selves enough to recommend
the ﬁlm

port to the attempts of the

Executive Cabinet and Joint
House Presidents to respond

to it.

By “inconsistencies," Balikov
said he meant the punishment
or a social ottenss by academic
penalties. Speaking tor the reso
lution, he said, “Ever since I’ve
been here, the primary tactic
of the administration has been
to talk _ to talk and talk and
talk.” Only through action by
students, he said, has a par-
ticular Student issue been re<
Solved.

Speaking against the resolu-
tion, Sandy Hesselink said, “Too
many broad general conCEms
were involved in the protest.
The faculty and administration
is now aware of these concerns
and further action might an-
tagonize them and is unwar-
ranted.”

Most senators agreed that, in
light of a petition now circulat«
ing among the student body ex-
pressing rcservalion about the
action, the Senate should reaf-
tirm it by expressing iormal
approved-tent.

On a point of iniormation,
Bob Foote stated his belief that
any future illegal visitations ap<
prehended by student leaders
and taken to student court
would result in a serious Wam-
ing, For any illegal visitation
apprehended by the FSA Com-
mittee, he Said, “I wouldn't
want to be one of the students.

Aiicr the Senate passed the
resolution, Karen Lauterhacll
said she thought students in
the last few days had been
too preoccupied with the
propriety or impropriety of
the action, with repercus-
sions of the action, and were
forgetting about the purpose
or the protest. She said com-
munication between students
and faculty had never been a
problem in the aiiair and that
sud] communication had dou-
bled since the protest.

Before the resolution was in-
troduced, lion Johnston, retir—
ing social coordinator, gave a
few “tearsoakcd” comments of
rarewell. l-la encouraged the
new social coordinator to in-
troduce people to new ideas and
to new things. The budgeting of
entertainment, he said, should
be thought oi not only in terms
of cost but also in terms of
worth to the Student body, in
terms or campus reaction and
whether the event Will con-
tribute to the campus. Because
of the coordinator’s freedom
and budgetary control, Johnston
Said, the coordinator is in a
unique position to bring in out<
side people like Pike or Car-
michal to stir up the campus.
He urged that this and other in-
novations be enacted.

Carletonians Demand Resignations

A statement recently an
pcared in the Carleton College
student newspaper calling tor
the resignation of the college
president, the dean of women,
and the men's dean. The stato-
merit, written by Carleton Stu<
dent Association President Pete
Iverson a nd Men's League
PIESldent Bob Masur, resulted
in the administration's firing of
IversOn from his proctorship.

The Iversorbli’lasur statement
claimed: “. r . if the College
wishes to impose its rules and
its morality through a Faculty
Administration Committee, stu-
dents should have nothing to do -
with such a structure. We
cannot cooperate with a body
whose basic reasons and prem-
ises for existence are ones
which we believe to be invalid."

Iverson was dismissed bcr
cause of “nonrcooperation with
regulations, the enforcement of
which he was paid by the col-
lege to perform,” according to
Dean of the College, Willis
Wentheriord, The Dean of
Men, Merrill Jarchow, said that
[verson showed a "lack of loy-
