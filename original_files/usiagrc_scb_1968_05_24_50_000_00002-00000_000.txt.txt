TRADITIONS

We, the undersigned members of the Grinnell College class of
1968, will not wear caps and gowns to any of the ceremonies re-
lated to graduation for one or more of the following reasons:

1. In the tradition of liberal education we will not accept tradi-
tional actions without rational justification. No reason has been
advanced as to why this dress is necessary.

2. We consider institutional pomp meaningless.

ii. We object to enforced uniform dress.

4. We object to the exclusion of student voice in the decision
of this issue as implied by late notification.

5. $3.75

6. We object to bookstore monopoly. .

7. We consider such dress uncomfortable. inappropriate to the
Iowa climate, and restrictive.

Now that you’ve seen the petition, let's talk about it. Permit
me to take the points out of order.

Point 7 seems to have an immediate solution. Wear shoes.
rocks or stockings, the gown, and nothing else. It's really very
comfortable, and not exactly restrictive either. As far as appro-
priateness to the climate, if somebody has found garments suitable
for wear in tornadoes, let him step forward.

To those people who objected to gi ng ,_ 75 to Smilin’ Sam’s
ovil monopoly i say why not entertain competitive bids? We had
competitive commencement announcements — why didn’t you or
ganize and undersell the bookstore? Dr rent your cup and gown
elsewhere?

Point one: oh, contradiction of contndictionsl How can you
call upon the TRADITION of liberal education to explain nonac-
ceptanco of TRADITIONAL actions? If you still feel compelled by
this point, I would suggest n short session with Mr. crossett. I
ihinlr you will find that although you might be justified in not
wearing a cap and gown, you won’t easily find justification for
doing much else.

I can find no provisions for enforcing uniform dress. Did you?
By student voice, i presume you are speaking of the collective
student. I’m sure that individual students still do have a voice in
what they wear simply by not wearing the cap and gown.

And, by the way, if you consider institutional pomp meaning-
less, why are you going to commencement anyway? Let's just
piclr up our degrees afterward.

Rut here's the real scoop on commencement. Just like every-
thing else at Grinnell, it’s not for the students. It's a fascist ma«
nipulative plat to get money from alumni and friends of the Col-

lege. You see all those caps and gowns disguise us, and remind the
alums of what they looked like, and stirs memories and things
and they cross Glenn’s palm with silver. Now, I risk you, is this
bad?

Since this protest is being staged by graduating seniors, sev-
eral assumptions must be made. We candidates for the BA. have
been here up to four years — we‘ve stuck it out, To stick it out,
you must fall into one of these categories: I-you couldn’t get out;
2-you are a masochist; 3»you liked it.

To the iirst, i say wait five minutes and it will all go away,
like a nightmare. To the second, I say enjoy, you perverts. To the
third 1 make my plea.

If you liked it, there's n good chance you would want your
younger brothers and sisters, or your children, to come here.
They can't it the college doesn’t get coin. Because if it doesn't
get coin, it will ily nwny train the world. So . . . wear your cups
and gowns, turn on the alumn, get that cold cash rolling iii.

If you feel the need to communicate to our President your
sincere concerns about our old folks’ home, I’m sure a discreet
button, or perhaps a few choice words as he welcomes you to the
world of the alum,‘ will do magmilcentiy.‘

MONEY AND INK

Yes, this is on salt. No, Neil didn’t use up all the money. Yes,
he thought he had.

Seems that Steve (Business Manager) Wal'sh let the mock
convention people borrow his adding machine, and he was totaling
bills in his head. Turns out he counted a bill for over $300 twice,
and in the final accounting, he found we had some loot left.

Meanwhile. Neil had already planned to leave before com-
mencement, and the new editor hasn’t been named yet, so here I
and again.

I wish I had had more time to work on this issue, and a staff
to assist me. But finals week is a bad time to start anything. ex<
cept maybe studying.

I would like to know where Bill Gray put his column because
I Couldn't ﬁnd it. I wish J. R had come through wit-ii what prom-
ised to be a very good feature.

Great thanks go out to Roger (he’s everywhere, he’s every-
where) McMullin, Information Service News Director, for his
service in directing me to infomation and news. And iivo skins
are due the multifaceted Mike Schwartz for his caricatures.

I'd like to say more, but I have to hurry over to commence-
merit. I’m first in line, and as Mr. Mendoza said, “you can make
ll 01‘ break it."

I’m going to try to make it. If I don’t, keep it to yourself. I’m
an alumnus now.‘

NOTES FROM THE
OlROlllJlR FILE

A few recent sessions in the Des Moines Airport have convinced
me that something must be done to protect students flying standby
from being bumped off waiting lists by men ﬂying military stand-
by.

After iili, isn’t that favoring the right-wing-military-industrial—
complex? It seems to me that student activists ought to be given
the same privileges as military men.

of course, the same restrictions would apply to the activists.
They would have to be in uniform.

since activist uniforms are rather easy to come by, our new
ﬂying elite would be required to produce orders requiring them to
travel (a note from S.D.S. headquarters would do).

I’m sure that this move would put a little spice into the his
line business, although we might have to get a Supreme Court rul<
big prohibiting the airlines from releasing the contents or the
orders.

LEGGETT ANSWERS
CAP AND GOWN PROTESTORS

[is several of you know, and as most of you may know,
Wednesday noon 1 was given ii statement, signed by some 63
members of the graduating class, to the effect that they “will not
wear caps and gowns to any of the ceremonies related to gradlk
ntion for one or more of the following reasons:" The reasons, or
objections, are essentially that the wearing of cap and gown is
meaningless, expensive, uncomfortable, and undemocratic. As
far as the College is concerned, these objections — which may or
may not be true — are n matler of individual judgment and value.
Certainly, except for the remarks of the invited commencement
speaker, the graduation ceremony is a ritual, traditional pomp
and circumstance; and participation in it is not a condition or
whether or not h graduating senior gets his diploma.

Accordingly, any graduating senior who finds the ceremony
meaningless or offensive or inconvenient Should exercise his privi-
lege not to participate in it, but rather attend as a spectator or not
attend at all; and then obtain ills diploma alter the ceremony
from the College Marshal, Professor Mendoza. The solution seems
very simple to me. Believing that everyone knew that Commence-
ment was a ritual chielly designed for tile parents and friends or
graduating seniors, I am puzzled only by the question of why
these matters cannot be approached with a sense of humor and
a good natured attempt at understanding.

PREXY OBITS
OVER FOUR-
LETTER WORDS

TALLAHASSE, Fla. (CPS)<
Florida State University Presl-
deiit John Champion resigned
this week in the wake of a cen~
sorship dispum over the use of
four letter words in the campus
literary magazine, but the board
of regents has refused to accept
the resignation.

Champion resigned after the
arts and sciences faculty, rep<
resenting the largest college in
the university, held a special
meeting to discuss the admin-
istration’s censorship or student
publications. The faculty tabled
by a vote oi 175-165 a motion to
censure the president and de-
mand his resignation if lie would
not reverse his decision to cen-
sor an article written for the
Legend, the literary magazine.

The president announced his
resignation only 30 minutes at-
ter the faculty voile. “In view of

this sentiment, i hereby tender
my resignation, effective im.
mediately," he said, His state
ment also said, “it is evident
that I no longer enjoy the con-
fidence of a major segment of
this university faculty.”

The Florida board of regents,
however, held an emergency
meeting and refused to accept
Champion’s resignation, Cham-
pion has not responded to the
board’s action, but many ob-
servers think he will make his
resignation stick. Others say
he can be persuaded to stay.

Three of Champion’s assist-
ants resigned along with him.
They were the director or uni-
versity relations and two spe-
cial assistants to the president.

According to rules set by the
board of regents, Champion is
responsible for all student pub-
lications. He had announced his
decision the day before the sp6<
cial faculty nicedng not to let
a controversial short story en-
titled “Pig Knife," appear in the
literary magazine. The short
story is about two uneducated
Negroes who use a variety of
iour letter words, on a limited
basis, in their conversation.

Champion labeled the article
“filthy and obscene." The board
of student publications earlier
had cleared the article for publi-
cation because of its literary
Value. The board held that the
four letter words added to ma
mood and tone of the story.

Hundreds of students have pro-
tested against the censorship.
Before Champion announced his
final decision, the students held
a 24—hour-a-day vigil in iront ot
the administration building to
await his announcement. After
Champion‘s resignation, Acting
President Laurence Chalmers
appointed a student-faculty com-
mittee tn study the publications
regulations set by the Regents
and make proposals for revi-
sions. The students called a
moratorium on their protest to
await the committee’s report,
which is due next week.
