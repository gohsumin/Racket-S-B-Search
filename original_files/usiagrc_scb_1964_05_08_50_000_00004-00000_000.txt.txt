Miscellany and Digression

By Tom Fullmer

Today we take you to a city
in Kentucky where the leaders
of an integration movement
are holding a meeting. The
group leader is speaking. Two
men listen.

LEADER: Well, gentlemen,
what are your thoughts on this
frogram of action I have out-
ined for next yearl‘

FIRST MEMBER: As I see
It, the program seems to be a
repetition and extension of last

ear’s program with the one
major change being the addi-
tion of that special target you
talked about.

SECOND MEMBER! About
that special target, I really
wonder Whether this should be
part of our program. After all,
we've never done anything this
radical before.

LEADER: This is true. How-
ever, let’s Climb the hill and
look at its from topside. There
,is perhaps no other institution
In American society as segre-
gated as this one. It has man-
aged to exploit this segregation
for profit. Even its name sug-
gests segregation

FIRST MEMBER: Yes, but
can we get our membership to
support a nationwide program
of action? Won’t they consider
this as just an isolated case of
legregation?

LEADER: I thought of that
too. But let’s follow this into
the high grass and see what it
gets. We have been constantly
emphasizing the bad publicity
which the U. 5. receives abroad
because of segregation. No
other segregated institution gets
anywhere near the publicity
abroad as our special target.
It has gotten much play behind
the Iron Curtain.

FIRST MEMBER: I see. If
we can get integration here
then the rest of the world will
believe there is nothing which
cannot be integrated.

SECOND MEMBER: Let’s
not get too confident here. Re-
member; these will be some

retty big boys we’re going to

e fighting. Every year at-
tempts are made to beat this
group. They thrive on beating

roups from a different race.

ave we got a person who can
successfully integrate them?

LEADER: When We first
dropped this into the well to see
if it would swim this was a
problem that received our ut-
most attention. I've talked to
the man I think can do the job.

‘ He realizes that he is going to
be pushed, and tripped, and el-
bowed as he tries to do his job,
but he is big and willing to lake
It.

SECOND MEMBER: The big
thing we’re going to have to
fight is the image of superior
ity they have built over the
years. We all know this is fic-
tion, but they have that record
which looks good on paper.

FIRST MEMBER: I think
everyone realizes this. Our big-
gest job will be to get this to a
court. If we can do this we Will
have succeeded.

LEADER: That’s true if Once
there we can‘get the ball to

 

bounce our way. Well, gentle-
men, can I count on your sup-
port for this special project?

BOTH: Certainly. One hun-
dred per cent.

LEADER: All right, we will
start immediately.

(At this instant a young Ne—
gro bursts breathlessly into the
room.)

NEGRO: I’m sorry I'm late.
I had a little trouble getting
served by that vending ma-
chine in our office. This is bhe
first meeting I’ve missed since
I helped organize this group.
What did we decide today?

FIRST MEMBER: The group
unanimously decided to make a
fullvscale effort to integrate the
Harlem Globetrotters,

LEADER: And next year our
prime target will be the Black
Muslims,

Dr. H. Spiegelberg
Ends Order Series

Dr, Herbert Spiegelberg, pro-
fessor of philosophy at Wash-
ington University (St. Louis),
will be the last of a series of
guest lecturers in the ”Inter
disciplinary Seminar on Order.”

An authority on phenomenolv
ogy, Dr. Spiegelberg will speak
on “Rules and Order” at 11
a. in. Monday in Herrick Chap-
e1.

His major work to date is a
two-volume “The Phenomeno-
logical Movement: A Historical
Introduction.” This 735-page ef—
fort constitutes volumes five
and six in a seven~part series
written by outstanding philov
sophical scholars,

Born in Strasbourg, Ger-
many, he has studied at Heidel-
berg, Freiberg, and Munich,
where he took his PhD. When
forced to leave the University
of Munich in 1937, he spent a
year of study in England before
coming to the United States.
where he has taught philosophy,
first at Swarthmore, and then
at Lawrence, before going to
Washington University,

The order seminar, directed
by Dr. Paul G. Kuntz (philoso-
phy and religion) has been a
yearlong study of the basic
concept, with over 20 visiting
scholars, representing various
phases of the disciplines,
brought to the campus to lec-
ture.

SCARLET AND BLACK

By John Wolf

The effect of natural root
grafting in trees is being stud-
ied on a college-owned farm
northeast of Grinnell by Ben
Graham (biol.) With the help of
a grant from the National Sci»
ence Foundation.

Graham explained that "trees
in forests b e o o m e united
through their root systems.
Once united they are able to
transfer water, diseases, and
nutrients between one another.
There are as many as 25-30
trees in such a union.

“Our prime objective is to
determine the significance of
these unions. We have 5000
trees of white pine, red pine,
Austrian pine, and Norway
spruce planted in various ar-
rangements to determine the
effect of species and spacing."

The trees in the nursery were
purchased in 1960 when they
were two years old. Some root
grafting was already notice-
able. .

“We hope to work out a tech-
nique to check on the extent of
grafting without having to dig
up the roots. This summer we
will begin on a radioactive
tracing techinque.”

Graham Went on to explain
the significance of this experi»
ment. “Tile concept in the past
has been that trees are discrete
organisms. In actuality, a tree
in a forest cannot be treated
as a separate organism.

“Foresters have trouble with
‘backflash’; when thinning trees
by poison, the poison often is
circulated to neighboring trees
by root grafts, Dutch elm
disease and oak wilt are also
known to be transmitted in this
way.

”We also plan to check the
results of some Russian expere
merits in root grafting. Russian
foresters have tried ‘nest plant-
ing‘s,’ in which clumps of trees
are planted and allowed to
grow until their roots are
grafted. Then all but the most
vigorous tree are cut away.
This tree, with its extra root
systems. is studied. Some Rus-
sian reports have claimed that
the added system is beneficial;
others say this added system is
parasitic."

Jim Frank, senior, has done
an independent project on root
grafts in a stand of white pine
near Amana. Frank checked
the rate of growth in stumps
which were grafted to living
trees. To Graham's surprise,

Frank found none.

“We thought that some
growth would be detected in
those stumps,” Graham said.
“This phenomenon is observed
quite often. For example, in
New Hampshire we found that
80-year-old stumps in one
stand still had live roots
grafted to living trees. These
stumps still exhibited diamet-

Graham noted that natural
root grafting in trees has been
observed as a curiosity toy
hundreds of years. In fact,
there is a rcierence, to the phe-
nomenon by Theophrastus from

ly recent that work into the
significance of such grafts has
been started.
