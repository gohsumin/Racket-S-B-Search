’l‘or Herbie we wish a week full of cheer,

And fifteen new majors by this time next year.
in the crystal palace with all its lights,

We wish young lovers happy nights,

And our Sad Freshman, who’ere they be,

We give you to Parsons University.

Over at Newton, John Turek and the gang,
Santa’s bell for you will loudly clang'.

It’s been a year, special issues and such,

For all of your patience, thanks very much.

The Scarlet and Black, long may she stand.
West of ole’ Miss and best in the land.

To all who in the columns have been hit,

Santa offers a handy first-aid kit.

To Editor John and his journalistic pinemate,

A year without crises, inudslinging, or hate,

And for sake of harmony in this holiday

May the S&B love SGA.

To all the men of the M. and St. L.,

And trustees, and alums, a joyeux Noel,
Refreshment we give to Penny and Zeke,

Just like they give us when our days look bleak.
For the CofHP, Wade and Gummy,

And Judy and her gang, bedchecks chummy.
For other members of the bureaucracy,

A gilt-edged handbook on hipocracy,

A brown helmit and if it doesn’t fit,

A big gold star for Mike Dewitt.

To members of Langan, north and south,

A Christmas case of “foot in the mouth."

We‘ll ignore the JLA

And as for comps, what are they?

To the Burling library sneakie thief,

We give a coal black holiday wreath.

To the Courts, men and women’s, and high, one, two,
A Faculty Committee on “affairs" for you.

For our faculty, lest they feel forgot,

A student committee, which could really be hot
For frustrated students, an “open house,"

In lieu of a Forum with rule — NO MOUSE.
To those who are worried by parents unnerved,
Santa leaves them the ghosts of those who swerved.
To Clark and Trigg and the rest of the jocks,
Four points all, and dirty sweatsox.

To Killer Young and physical Edd,

What might be left in Santa’s sled.

Now Santa has finished his yearly trek,

His sled, like your poets, is nearly a wreck.

Pot, Twinkle, and Gummy, Wade, Babes and the rest:
Maris, Jimbo, Stods, Annie, all in jest,

Richard, Susan, Philip, Helen, and Lenore,

Like the Raven shall return nevermore.

Only with plagiarism are we this erudite.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night

Prof Proposes Periodic Assembly of College Community

To the Editor:

There are some great events
here at Grinnell that are known
only to a few. More members
of the college community
should have been told in ad-
vance last week to spare an
hour for Dr. Li of the Univer-
sity of Iowa and for Mr. David
Maitland of Carleton College.
I have heard many lectures in
art history, but never one so
good as Li's on “Sung Land~
scape Painting.” I have heard
many talks on question and.
answer, on hearing and listen
ing and responding. but never
one so good as Maltland’s “On
Listening.” Robert McMillan
and Roger Eldridge are modest
men. They didn’t shout at you
when their guests came. But
these men had something very
important to say, said their
messages well. Many students
who didn’t miss these events
were deeply impressed and ex-
pressed regret at the small st-
tendance.

I have often missed a good
lecture or concert or play. I
used never to miss a good mo»
Vie. Why? Because I had two
friends who followed the re-
views and who alerted me
Weeks in advance so that I
could budget my time. I miss
these friends very much; oh, I
still have one who knows mo»
vies and I turn to him for ad-
vice. Why can’t someone pro-
vide information about speak—
ers and artists and scientists
who are to appear? Surely the
Grinnell Information Service
can get the ordinary cursus
vitarum, the who's who stuff.
But this needs to be supple-
mented by someone who knows
the guest personally and can
relate his interests to ours. I
would like here to express a

 

word of appreciation to Mr.

Eldridge and to his secretary
for having provided copies of
Samuel Miller’s most recent
articles. I found them in the
R. A. R. and scanned each of
them. They helped me to un-
derstand what the Gates Leo-
turei‘ was driving at. And in-
deed I picked up a book of
Dean Miller after he departed
and followed up the theme of
metaphor in my philosophy
Classes. May I add that I find
every public event a great stim»
ulus to work in my field and
never. well, or almost never, a
distraction.

Perhaps students think of
Grllinell College as a place for
lectures, plays, and concerts
but not a place for sermons,
The sermons are indeed inte-
grally related to the worship of
God and one may say that
there is no God, or that what-
ever cosmic force there is nev-
er asks in he prayed to or to
be praised in song. Or at least
doubtless he never told you that
one day in seven was sacred
and that you should go to His
house to listen to His prophet
proclaim the Word, You may
add that this version of meta—
physics is primitive arld out<
moded and that you hate to
aid in the continuation of sup-
erstition. Positively'you may
say that the spiritual life can
be better cultivated through
the ministrations of the Lenox
Quartet, and our moral fer-
vor better geared into the Civil
Rights Movement. Music and
desegregation, you may argue,
are the religion of the modern
intellectual, along with fine
sexual relations.

I should like to answer these
difficulties not from my own
experience but from testimony
of sir Julian Huxley. Huxley
is not only a great biologist but

 

Berry Discusses Forum Uses.
Responds to 'Deluded Sectors'

To the Editor:
The Forum has just opened
and already indignant protests

of “betrayal” can be heard
among certain deluded sectors
of the student body. “They're
trying to civilize us” runs the
hue and cry among certain
young rustics. My own re-
sponse to these pathetic whim»
pers is “Get off it, Jack, you're
just. yellow!" because I think
these people misunderstand
the intentions of the Forum’s
creators.

For my money the Forum
represents a recognition by the
powers that be that we students
have had a legitimate vexation
with the former drabness of
Grinnell. In fact we must have
made our case awfully well by

the looks of things, because the.

ladylove’s earlobes in one of
ttli windowside alcoves. bash
the piano keys, giggle, guffaw,
wail roar, pursue Britomart
over the hill and dale, etc, the
Forum is not going to be of<
fended. The Forum is so com-
pletely padded, upholstered,
berugged, hedraped, patient,
motherly etc. that a great deal
of ructions and cacapho‘ny are
not going to upset its compos-
ure.

As a matter of fact, I think
the planners oi the Forum will
be disappointed if students
don't tear up the pea patch and
sow a few wild oats in their
little castle, All they expect is
that we don’t carve our initials
in the furniture, don’t spill pipe
ashes on the rugs without clean—
ing them up, and dont hold

I would not be using Sir Jul<
ian’s witness if it did not coin-
cide with my own experience.

I should like also to add a
few words from the address of
F. S. C. Northrop. Northrop is
a philosopher of science, pro-
fessor emeritus of Yale Law
School, author of The Meeting
of East and West, and altogeth-
er one of the finest teachers
that my friend Klausner and I
have ever had. At least we do
not brush his thought away
lightly. Northrop spoke in 1954
when Beloit rededicated its
Chapel. I believe his points
about the relevance of a Chapel
Program to the integral life of
our community and of the rela-
tion of other fiEIds to the ideas
there presented are true,

and experience,and even if oth-

argues, upon philosophy and

should take seriously his argu-
ment that the whole commun-
ity needs to be periodically
gathered. Otherwise we lose
the sense of common purpose,
we become atomized individ-

(ions and cliques. There was a
time when the whole commune

convocation. There was a time
