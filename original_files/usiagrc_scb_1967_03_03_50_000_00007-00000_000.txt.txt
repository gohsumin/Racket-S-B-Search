the college. Grinnell students
have recognized the need roi-
these facilities tor some time
and they have been persistent
in expressing a desire for them.

I hope the students will be
just as persistent in expressing
their desire for retorms in the
present sﬂclal system at Grin-
nell. Judging from recent ac-
Lion hy the administration and
lack of action by the faculty, 1
think a great deal at student
pers' tence may he called tor
if G innell is to maintain its
tradition of sensitivity to the
needs of the student in a
rapidly changing society.

Mr, Leggett tells me that
the students at Grinnell Ire
too impatient. Although I have
forsaken the warmth and shel-
ter of Grinnell and now inhabit
the cold, cruel world, I still
find myself sympathizing with
the students’ impatience. From
my vantage point in the out-
side world, I find that the liv-
ing conditions at Grinnell
seem more inhuman than ever.

Perhaps Mr. Leggett would
he a little more impatient if
he were forced to live the life
of a Grinnell student for a few
days or weeks. Living in a
dorm, eating in a dining hall,
and making love in public
Flaces are somehow not quite
as satisfying as living in a
home, eating with one’s inti-
mate friends, and making love
in private.

It living conditions at Grin-
neli were a bit more conducive
to the healthy development of
the individual into it self-gov-
erning and responsible human
being, perhaps there would be
no need for expanded mental
health facilities.

The Vietnam War
To the Editor:

With all the discussions and
arguments about the war in
Vietnam it might be enlighten-
ing to stop and listen to an
outside opinion. Today I re-
ceived a letter [ram 3 girl I
met in Switzerland during a
Girl Scout eVenL She is 22,
Danish, and was a missionary
in Afghanistan for a year. I
wish to quote a paragraph
from her letter. I have not cor~
reeled her grammar because I
feel it is the content 01 the
letter that is ant, not
the form.

. l i think in Vietnam —
when will this murder stop?
I think, that this war is one
of the worsest there ever
has been in the world. X can
not understand, how people
can he so against another:
I have tried to understand
it, I have read and put my
mind to it, out 1 cannot un-
derstand it. But I shall not
judge, hr with that which I
judge other people, l shall
myself once be judged. out
the only thing I am able to
do, it is to pray for that it
will stop, so all the people,
who are involved in this,
may come to this conclusion

to be good to each other and
to love each other without a
war like this. All says if. is
lor freedom they are fight-
ing, but my opinion is, that
the only freedom, which is
right treedoiii, is that trice-
dom that is won through a
conversion or the mind of
man and not through killing
another. The greatest com-
mand, that is given by the
Lord Jesus Cln-ist, and this
is: “Love your neighbor as
yourseu" and that the fishy
ing men do not practice this
commend, I think, out or
course, it is difficult to stop
suddenly, but l think, it will
do the world hotter, when
the war stop . . . __ _____

Are you
discontented
enough
towork for
G.E.?

Does water pollution bug you? Or smog? Does 1!
concern you that some places in the country never
have enough teachers? Or nurses? And when you
read about the growing pains of a developing na~
ticn. do you wish you could do something?

You can. Thousands of General Electric people
are helping‘to solve the problems of a growing,

changing world.

Generating more (and cheaper) electricity with
nuclear reactors. Controlling smog in our cities
and pollution in our streams. Using electronics to
bring the teaching skills of an expen into many
classrooms at once, the trained eyes of a nurse
into many hospital rooms at once

it you’re not content with the world as It is . . .
and if you have the brains, imagination and drive
to help build a better one, we‘d like to talk to you.

See the man 1rol1l G.E. during hls next campus
visit. Come to General Electric. where the young

men are important men.
