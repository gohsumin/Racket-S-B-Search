Trustees Increase Tuition $130;
Comprehensive Fee Now $2, 730

A 5130 increase in Grinnell’s‘
1966.67 tuition was agreed upon by
the Board of Trustees during a
meeting here last weekend.

The total rec paid by Grinnell
students next year will be $2,730.

in a letter sent to parents this
week, President Glenn Leggett ex-
plained that. “this increase in tui-
tion charges is directly related to
an expected increase or about
$225,000 in operating costs for
195676 .”

Dr. Leggett itemized the areas
in which more money needs to be
Spent next year:

“To keep raculty salaries at a
point where they are competi-
tive means that a particularly

heavy burden is placed on the
budget ior current operations

“in addition, it has been clear
to me since my arrival, and to
the deans and the faculty at
Grinneil for some time, that we
need to Improve our student per-
sonnel services, especially as
they relate to a more elicctivo
organization or the residence
halls.

“I am also persuaded that we
need to make additions to the
iaculty in certain departments.

Finally, like most of you, we
have to meet general inflation
in our costs."
in commenting on the fee in-
crease, Vico President Merritt

Ludwig said that additional fl-
nancial aid would have to be pro<
Vided students of modest means.
He said that the college has never
lelt an upperclassman financially
stranded.

Ludwig also said, “The iuturo
holds the likelihood of the con-
tinuing trend toward increased
lees; as this trend continues, one
hopes that government financtal
aid programs will help to bear a
major portion of these increases."

Concerning the recently enacted
bill to provide iederal money tor
student aid, Ludwig noted, “The
provisions are uncertain enough
that we have not been able to
evaluate iully their consequences."
