Senior men comment
on new draft threat

By Sue Galvin

A random sampling of senior men
indicated that the Change in draft poi-
lcy, which makes graduate school no
longer a basis for deferment, has created
some serious student concern about the
future without appreciably altering any
immediate plans.

Said one senior who wished to re-
main anonymous, “1 may find myself
a political refugee in another country
because of my moral and political ctr
jections to the war." A number of other:
who have also been accepted at grad-
uate school may be forced to choose
the same recourse.

Sam Lucas is going ahead with hi:
plans for graduate school, but com-
mented, “I may be sorry in a year."

Said Steve Shendel‘, “I still plan to
enter graduate school but have also
t'nade an application to the Naval Ola
ricers Candidate School."

Bond Faulwell plans to enlist in the
army However, he said that “this is
not totally a result of the change in
the draft policy, but the change did
make me think to get my obligation
but of the way rather than having law
Ichool interrupted."

‘A‘rt Arnold's response typified the
reactions of most of the individuals
interviewed: “I am not immediately af<
fected by the change, I am going to
continue with my longtime plans of
graduate school. However, I will think
u lot more about the draft and the
various programs I could enter, and
which ones I would definitely consider
if it becomes necessary.”

A Grinnell graduate’s IBM 1401 com-

Monsoon offensive.

Lieutenant David McBlain, Chief of
Programming and Analysis at the
Army‘s Combined intelligence Center in
Saigon, uses a computer to sort and

in 1962 and returned as an instructor
of mathematics in 1964, supervises the
Automatic Data processing branch

“With ADP," McBlain wrote in I
letter to Professor E. R. Mullins (math<
ematics), “seemingly unrelated infor-
mation gathered from captured Vietcong
reconnaissance personnel and aerial
photographs of trodden—down grass can
lead to the uncovering of communists."

“Our knowledge of the enemy is fan-
tastic and growing rapidly," said the
former math major, “and ADP is the
first intelligence unit in the history
of warfare to disseminate theatre army
tactical intelligence as far clown as
the battalion level in the field."

“Our job is to be able to retrieve
knowledge quickly in an intelligible
fashion. We can get radio requests in
the late afternoon and have the inter
mation in tile field user’s hands by

Visitor on campus

Yugoslav on Economics

By Dan Bucks

Emphasizing a pragmatic and empiri-
cal approach to economic problems,
Milos Samardzija, Professor of Econom-
ics at the University of Belgrade, traced
the development of the Yugoslavian
economy for Grinneiiians during his visit
here. April 25 and 26.

Professor Samal‘dzija’s 24-hour visit to
the campus included two lectures, a
class appearance, and several informal
conversations With faculty and students

Maintaining a vigorous verbal pace
throughout his visit, Professor Samardr
zlja described how Yugoslavia has
achieved a 7.1% rate of growth of na-
tional product through the construction
of an economy that represents a com-
bination of planning techniques and man
he: relations. Through the Yugoslavian
formula that "state ownership does not
require state management,” enterprises
remain “Socially-owned" but are homes
illgiy managed by “worker’s councils"
elected by the laborers in an enterprise.

The system of specialized production
units managed by “worker's councils"
is integrated through market organiza-
tions, State intervention primarily takes
the form of control over the “endpoints"
of the production process: the supply
of raw material inputs and the demand
for the final output. Ideally, the inter-
mediate stages of production are left
to the control of the market.

The state also maintains control over
approximately 30% at new investment
funds. This investment is channeled into

basic transportation and communications
systems or into industry located in un-
derdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia.

Samardzija described the two major
stages in the evolution of the post-war
Yugoslavian economy as “deetatization”
and “de-politizationl” “De-etatization,"
which occurred in the late 40's and early
50's, was the process of abolishing state
management of enterprises and the es-
tablishment of “worker selfamanage
ment." “Depoli zation,” which has oc-
curred in the mid 60's, has consisted of
removing the Communist Party control
of the worker’s councils. Through these
processes, the political pyramid that
characterizes a Soviet style system has
been abolished in favor of a more de-
centralized system of management.

In a markedly non-ideological manner,
Samardzija frequently stressed that econ-
omic techniques must be adapted to the
historical and cultural conditions of a
country. Whether a technique was social-
ist or capitalist in nature was of less
concern to him than whether or not the
technique improved the performance of
the economic system.

Samardzija, who is currently a visiting
proiessor at Western Michigan Universi-
ty, has concentrated his teaching intelu
ests on introductory courses. For Yugo-
slavian students he has designed course
materials that combine theories of plan-
ning and of market systems to explain
the unique Yugoslavian experience. This
“best of both worlds" approach to econ-
omic thinking has been expanded in
Samardzija's book, The Economic Sys<
lem of Yugoslavia.

 

SGA Open Dorms Committee presents
questions for discussion by students, faculty

Ed. Note: The following is a state
ment by the senate committee on open
dorms.

The SGA Open Dorms Committee is
currently involved in attempts to find
rationale either for or against an ex-
pansion of legal open visitations. The
committee realizes that certain funda<
mental questions must be answered be
fore any positive recommendation can
be submitted for student and adminisr
trative action,

1. If there is presently little danger
of upprehenslon for daytime or evening
IV's, why should we bother with try-
ing to extend legal opens? What in
owning with structured hypocrisyr. ,

2. For example, is our present rules
structure the best method of providing
a measure of assistance and support
for students struggling with unresolved
sexual issues?

3. It increased open dorms lead to
at least some increase in sexual inter-
course, “emotional trauma, and preg-
nancy," how could you, as a college
administrator, justify extending opens?

4. Could a local option system of
open dorms (each hall deciding on
its opens program within prescribed
limits) fail to protect the rights of the
individuals Voting in the minority? .

5. Could such a local option system
lead to more effective in-hall enforce
ment—as with the present quiet hours
and disorderly conduct rules where
the hall sets the standard of punishr
ment when one person’s actions are
annoying to others? .

it. with a significantly expanded sys-
tem of legal opens, what types of
penalties would be appropriate for
those violating the rulesf.

7. How can an extensionsof opens be
presented positively to parents and
financial supporters?,

8r What type of general rule struc-
time can promote most effectively stu-
dent responsibility and maturity in so-
cial, as well as academic conernsr.

The members of the Opens Committee
feel that the question of extending open
dorms provides a logical focal point:
for the discussion of many current stu-
dent concerns. The discussion must of
necessity touch on the questions of pri-
vacy. student maturity and responsibil-
ity, the student’s role as a member of
a hall and of the college community,
the “formal date” emphasis of the
present social structure, rule enforce-
ment, and the general aims of a resi-
dential liberal arts college

This committee is attempting to or-
ganizo and synthesize student, faculty,
and administration opinions on these
questions into a meaningful statement
regarding the open dorm policy. ob—
jectivity and openmindedness are pri-
mary considerations in our discussions,
and if our studies recommend it, we will
suggest that opens not be extended.

As the committee hopes to have a
recommendation ready early in Septem-
ber, they hope that the above questions
will he discussed in house meetings and
in informal student-facultyrand admin<
istraticn groups and that the opinions
presented will be forwarded to mem-
bers of this committee. The question
of open dorms should be the serious
concern of all members of the college
community,

The above questions will be discussed
Monday at hall meetings and Wed-
nesday at senate. All students are urged
to participate in the discussion and at<
tend the senate meeting.
