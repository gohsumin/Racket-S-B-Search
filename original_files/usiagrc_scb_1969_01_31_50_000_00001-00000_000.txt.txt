'A look a! San Francisco Stale

. (an Students ‘ reel 'Ilieir Education?

By CATHY JONES

The current strum at San Francisco
State is developing into the most signifi-
cant at recent attempts to change the
gm" structure of a university, but is

rlgcly ignored or poorly covered by the
nation’s mass media.

The strike is actually two strikes, one
by union professors and one by students.
but While their demands are different,
the present alliance between the two
poses a continuing daily threat to the
existence of the university as it is now
governed. The speciﬁc demands by the
L‘Black Student Union and Third World
Liberation Front include the establish
ment of a 20-mn Black Studies Depart-
ment under Dr. Nathan Hare, with the
sole power on hire and fire resting with
the department; the admittance to the
university of all black students who want

to attend next fall, the establishment o!
a School of Ethnic Studies for Third
World students with sole hiring and fir-
lng power; reinstatement of Black Pan-
ther, George Murray as a teacher for
1963—69, and amnesty lor all students
arrested during the strike.

The repeated announcement by stu-
dent leaders that all demands are non<
negotiable and that the strike will con-
mlnue until they are met, underlines the
real issue at hand: the question oi who
controls the university.

Faculty demands for educational re-
form, and a written collective bargaining
contract also point to the desire for a
restructuring 0! present power relation-
ships wimin the university Faculty
strikers also support the removal of the
police from the campus and agreement
to the students' demands, but while the

two sets of strikers are pfcketing and
working together now, student leaders
are carelul to point out their demands
cannot be negotiated and their strike will
continue regardless of the outcome of
the American Federation of Teachers
Strike.

The strike tuellc marks a new phase
In attempts by students to control the
educational process. It goes far beyond
the tactic of simply holding I building
where one mass Irrest ends the cons
mntallom The strike ls u continual
problem for the admlnlstration and
police, and even a major bust like the
one January 23 where so students,
faculty and supporters were arrested
does not halt the movement.

Of course. the presence of the San
Francisco Police Force is a continual
problem, too, but this may also be soon
as an indication of the strength and

weight of the threat the strike pose]
to the administration.

Police,ractios also go beyond those
used in previous confrontation attempts.
Heliwpter‘s hover above the campus, g“.
sibling police to spot miscellaneous acts
of low violation, relay the description at
the violator w the ground where the per-
son may be arrested hours or days la«
ter. Leaders of the Strike have been
subject to arrest at any time on back
warrants for violations or any kind (in-
cluding real or imagined). But so iar
these arrests have failed 00 demoralizo
the strikers or break the strike.

There are other important difference:
in the San Francisco State situation from
other campus power struggles. The stu-
dent body is quite different from what

Senate Takes Slep Toward Democracy

by ED HlRSl-I

A Step Towards Democracy

On Wednesday night the Grinnell Sen-
ate decided to take a major step in over-
coming their basic fear of the student
body by holding a representative elec-
tion for the two recently vacated senate
seats. The election will take place on
February 6th at 7:30, in the north lounge
of the form. Any student who wants to
vote must do so at this meeting Thurs<
day night. Those students seeking office
ohoulld file applicahions before 2:00 pm.
bn Monday, February 3rd. Applications
can be made by conuactirig either Tom
Thomas or Tom Triplet! in the Student
Government Office, or by placing a note
in the Student Government Mailbox.

It seems typical of the Grinnell Senate
that when they found that Richard
Sohneirov had transferred and that Deb-
bie Friedman had taken a leave of ab-

sence, causing two vacancies in the Sen-
ate, their first reaction was to hide the
fact that these two vacancies had no
curred and to think of electing two new
senators themselves. They would then
eventually let the word leak to the stu-

"The Democratic revolution, establish<
lng freedom, justice and equality has not
yet occurred in the Unit States.” This
was the comment of vi ling Professor
Charles H. Nichols in his ﬁrst class in
”Retormism in the US." Reformism is
not a new invention of the 1960's. It is
as old as any American institution, and
has assumed many forms.

Professor Nichols is well equipped to
explain early reformism and its con-
temporary relevance. He wrote his dis~
sertatiun for a Ph.D. on “A Study of the
Slave Narrative;" he has published,
Many Thousand Gone, The Ex-Slaves’
Account of Their Bondage and Freedom,
and is currently working on a biography
of Theodore Parker,

The early reformers began the attempts

to establish equality and assert the hu-
man dignity of the Afro-American. Re-
formers of today owe a great debt to
and share much with these men. The
”Black Revolution" is the latest form of
this struggle. Dr. Nichols sees three
basic causes behind the recent rise of
“Black Power." First, AfrorAmericans
are becoming more aware and taking
greater pride in their heritage. The Afro-
American has a culture which has con-
tributed to many positive aspects of
American society. Secondly, as Dr. Nic-
hols points out, the new direction of the
movement is a reaction to the assassi-
nation of Rev. Martin Luther King. Men
became further alienated by the failure of
Non-Violence. Thirdly, there has been
or rejection of American Imperialism. The
outrageous treatment of the Vietnamese
people has created a universal solidarity
among colored people. Dr. Nichols em-
phasizes that the violence committed in
our cities in recent years is very small
compared to the violence perpetrated
upon Black men through the centuries.
He feels that the message of men like
Le Roi Jones and Eldridge Cleaver is
to respect the “Holiness of human life,"
something that has not been respected
sufficiently in America. A society that
produces for profit, not for people calla

not easily achieve this value. Civil Right!
Legislation can never be effective until
White America is willing to enforce hus
manitarian laws.

Dr. Nichols has been the Director of
the Department of Literature at the Free
University of Berlin since 1959.

During this time he has observed many
Americans in Europe. Their arrogance
and lack of concern for the people around
them has caused him to question the
values of the society which produced
them. He has concluded that ii White
America refuses to renounce its imperi-
alistic attitudes then ethical men should
attempt to gain the power to bring about
those changes. This would necessitate a
revolution. However, Dr. Nichols feels
it is still the goal oi the Black people to
make American society truly humane.

Dr. Nichols is a 1542 cum laude gradus
ate of Brooklyn College who holds a Ph.Dy
from Brown University. He has taught at
Morgan State College, Hampton Institute,
and Bmwn. While a Fulbright Visiting
Lecturer in Denmark, he also lectured in
Germany and later joined the faculty of
the Free University of Berlin. Beginning
with the academic year 1965-1970, he will
be professor of English at Brown Unl<
versxty.

Opry AI' Grinnell

Saturday night at 10:30 music from
rural Tennessee will fill the South'
(Southem) Lounge. Clint noward, Fred
Price, and their sons Clarence Howard
and Kenneth Prlce will present a cons
cerl. of downrhome, old-time music.

Clint Howard and Fred Price gained
reputations far from their farms near
Nashville during the folk revival of the
early ’605. They are regular performers
at the Newport Folk Festival, and last
July in Washington they were greeted
enthusiastically at the Smithsonian In-
stitution’s Festival of American Folk-
life. The group is commonly associated
with Doc Watson, with whom they often
perform in concert,
