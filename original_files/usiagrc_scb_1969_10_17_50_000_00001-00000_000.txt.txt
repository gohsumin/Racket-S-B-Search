Students Vote to
Abolish Queens

by a Staii Writer

The thousand proper parents
and nostalgic alumni who be

night tor the annual Homecom-
ingrParent’s Weekend may be
relieved to learn that unlike last
year, Griiinell College will not
have a male homecoming queen,
H 0 W e V e r, the traditionalisLs
among them might be somewhat
disappointed when they discover
that, in tact, Griirnell will have
no homecoming queen at all this
year.

In a referendum held last
night in dinner lines, students
voted to abolish homecoming
queens at Grilineil by a margin

to the question “Do you want a
homecoming queen?”, 312 stu-

Piitsch, Chairman of the Physi-

“0! course we will abide by it.

“Our department doesn't want
to jam a queen down the stu-

one,” Wilson said. He said that
his department has “no special
concern" about whether or not
Grinneli has a queen, and he

Large Crowds Hear Presentations
0n Student Decision-Making Role

By Henry Scheii

Hundreds of students iilled
Roberts Theater Tuesday night
as the Grinnell student senate
and other interested students
called for the creation Di 3
“student community" at Grin-
neil In which students will play
a substantial role in the col-
iege's decisionmalting process.

Speakers outlined issues of
student Concern in five basic
and wide-reaching a r e a s —
counseling, student social serv-
ices, social regulations, aca-
demics, and administration.

Committees were formed in
each of these areas to discuss
proposals and to elect or ap—
point live people to write a
basic student position paper in
their area, to become part of
a cohesive statement that will
be brought to the senate after
mid-sern break, discussed,
amended, and then presented
to the administration for action,
Those involved hope that this
statement will be hacked by a
majority or the student body,
and all students are being en-
couraged by the senate to par-
ticipate in the discussions and
in the formulation oi the docu~
merit.

Senator Bill Stranger started
Tuesday‘s meeting with a

brief history of the activities
that lead to the mass meeting.
A few weeks ago several inter<
ested student government mem<
hers and other students began
to question the roll of the stu-
dent at Griiiiiell College. They
set up meetings to discuss this
question and to determine the
best way to bring this issue to
the student body.

At least one person on every

the Rev. Newell E. Davis, min-
ister of the United Church 0'
Christ Congregational, who was
to speak later in the evening
during the rally at the park.

Davis explained that he did
not represent either all or his
church or even most of the
town, but spoke as air individuat
