Manly (ites Increasing Danger
in finchainetl Executive Power

By Nord Brue

In his speech Wednesday ln
Herrick Chapel, Chesly Manly
or the Chicago Tribune at-
tacked the trend toward “unfet-
tered executive supremacy and
authoritarian statism” in our
American form of government.

Manly began with an indict»
ment of President John F, Ken-
nedy for his proposed efforts to
make himself the sole instrur
ment in setting American for-
eign policy, He added that Otto
F. .Otepka was dismissed from
his state Department position
because he had testified truth-
fully to a Congressional com-
mittee about the laxity in se-
curity in the U.S. Department
of State.

He maintained that these
Incidents were not important
in themselves but that they
were symptomatic of the
trend toward increased exec-
utive power. Manly wryly ob-
served that Washington is
becoming the “Grimm World
of the Brothers Wonderful.”

Manly contended that the ex-
treme liberal and the tradi»
tional conservative are seeking
the same end and differ only in

their means to this end.

He said, “Whereas tradi-
tional conservatives favor an
aristocracy of wealth and
family, the modern liberals
put their trust in an elite of
great brains and master
planners.” “The liberals,” he
said, “intend to secure their
end by feigning a love for the
common man, while the tra-
ditional conservatives disdain
Sommoners."

To prove that the extra
power which has been given to
the executive branch since the
election of F.D.R. has been
misused, Manly referred to the
Yalta and Tehran conferences.
This policy of appeasement
was carried into the Truman
era as witnessed by the fact
that the US would not help the
Chinese Nationalists and al-
lowed that country to be taken
by the Communist forces.

Manly held the Eisenhower
administration responsible for
the {all of Cuba to the Commu»
nists and he maintained that
Kennedy’s failure to .give air
support to the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion caused that expedition
to fail. And in the Cuban Cri-
sis of 1962 the President was a
momentary hero, but he paid
a high price.

Mnnly did not hold the
Presidents personally respon-
sible but indicated that they
were the ideological captives
of their advisers. A case in
point was censorship of the
military and an anti anti-
communist policy adopted in
the summer of 1961.

The conclusion Manly drew

 

was that the powers of the pres-
ident should be restricted. This
is not to relegate him to the po-
sition of a mere figurehead for
he has many legal responsi-
bilities, In essence, he should
lead but not command.

In 1955 he rated Grinnell as
one of the top ten liberal arts
colleges in the U.S.

Information Paradox Complicales
Government Formation of Policy

By Kathy Elliott

“There is a basic parodox
between the public’s right and
need to know and the govern—
ment’s necessity for privacy,"
said James Garfield last
Thursday at 8:00 p.m. in Her-
rick Chapel, Greenfield, Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary of
State for News in the Bureau
of Public Affairs, was a guest
speaker for the Grinnell Col-
lege Student Symposium on
“The Democratic Process in
an Era of Crisis.”

“Today there is not enough
public knowledge,” said Green-
field. “An ill-informed public
does not serve the government
No policy is worth one cent un-
less it has the support of pub-
lic opinion, and the public
must have access to material
to make intelligent decisions.
Basic policies must be fully
and openly :scussed and pub-
lic enunciation made.

“However, all official busi-
ness can‘t he conducted on
Main Street at hlgh noon. 0f-
ficials must keep in mind
that what is disclosed to the
public will also be disclosed
to our enemies along with
our allies and the committed
and uncommitted nations,"
said Greenfield.

“A false leak at the wrong
time can ruin a delicate negoti-
ation. If the public were edu-
cated and interested in politics,
and If the world society
believed in open discussions,
there would be‘no fear of dan-
gerous disclosure."

_ In answer to recent accusa-
tions that the State Depart-
ment has been keeping cru-
cial information from the
public, Greenfield pointed out
that 300 neWsmen are as-
signed to cover the State De-
partment and that the de-
partment spends a third of its
time explain policies to the
public.

Greenfield specifically re-
ferred to the Cuban Crisis when
the state Department had
eleven people working around
the clock to answer 400 phone
calls daily and supply informa-
tion. “The fact that the ‘Read-
er’s Digest’ was able to write
a book from the information re»
ceived from the State Depart-
ment just one month after the
crisis hardly qualifies us for
charges of secrecy,” said
Greenfield.

 

Speaking on the lnterwork-
ings of the government and the
press, Greenfield defined the
press as the “principal ma-
chinery of communication and
dialogue between the govern-
ment and the public,"

Greenfield pointed out that
"there are moments when the
serving interest of the governa
ment and the informing inter-
est of the press don’t coincide.
The government is responsible
to the public as a whole and
not to any strong segment of
the public such as the press."

The major problem of the
press today is that it still prac-
tices the same approaches to
reporting government news as
it did when our country was en-
gaged in only one crisis at a
time, Greenfield said. “Today
we are engaged in 15 to 20
crises at a time. The amount of
information printed on govern-
ment affairs is small compared
to the material given out. Each
day’s fragments remain frag»
ments, while crisis becomes
more and more complicated."

The press is far from con-
tent with this dilemma, and
the process of “soul-search-
ing” Is beginning In journal-
ism, said Greenfield.

“With the soul~searching of
the press and the awareness‘of
government to the public’s
right to know," concluded
Greenfield, "I am confident we
will prove that democracy can
work and will prevail."
