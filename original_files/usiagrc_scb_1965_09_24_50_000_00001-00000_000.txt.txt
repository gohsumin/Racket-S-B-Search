. Encampment Topics Included

Liberal Education to iotin! Lite

Sixty students, faculty, and administration members
spent two days last weekend dodging the rain, playing bridge,
participating ill a ”College Bowl” contest, getting to know each
other in a non»acadenlic way, and — more in line with the pre-
announced purpose of the encampment — discussing the col-

lege and its problems.

Participants in the encampment arrived at_the Episcopal
camp near Boone Friday night and began five discussion

groups, which were concerned with topics from the social at-
mosphere at Grinnell to the nature of a liberal education,

On Saturday morning, President Glenn Leggett nloder<
ated a general session of all encampers, Dr. Leggett noted
that college students don’t face the fact that they are in a self-
regulating society and are consequently too tolerant of things

that might upset that society.

“Colleges have to let people make mistakes, but they
can’t allow the students to get away with mistakes day after

day,” Dr. Leggett said.

Dr. Leggett continued that the students don’t realize “how

 

‘Geishas' Itost
Campus Men

South campus is entertaining
the opposite sex tomorrow night
by turning itself into a “Geisha
House" where honorable gentle-
men may avail themselves of a
-variety of indispensable services

The occasion: Quad Open House,
of course. That's the time for all
inhabitants of the North to mi-
grate South and spend the two
golden hours from 8:00 until 10:00,
roaming the halls of the Geisha
House while scores of temporarily
oriental and obedient gelshas await
their bidding.

In anticipation of the desires oi
its guests, the House Stair plans
to provide the tollowing:

Off Campus Houses—facials,
shaves, and haircuts;

Mears and James—massages;

Mathemanicures;

Cleveland and Hainesiironingi

Read—shoeshines;

Loose—teahouse,

0n the stroke oi ten, when the
geisltas turn back into pumpkins,
guests and pumpkins may repair
to Gardner Lounge. There they
are invited to dance the rest of
the night away—to the tunes or a
rock-and-rnll band.

Gannonball to Give

Civil Rights Group Plans Study,
Lectures, Des Moines Prb/ects

In the nonhrganizational atmos
phere of the South Lounge, the
Grinnell civil Rights Group held,
what president Karen olson
termed, a “basically organization.
a1 type meeting” designed to ac-
quaint students with the group’s
planned activities for the year and
with the student exchange prde
gram with LeMoyne College in
Memphis, Tenn.

The group will concentrate its
activites in three ﬁelds. First, a
number of study groups of {our
to six people will be formed to
research social problems. Not lim-
ited to civil rights concerns, some
suggested fields ior investigation
included migrant labor, Indian
problems, the legacy oi Recon-
struction, prison treatment, and
the enforcement of Iowa Civil
rights laws.

Each group will have a laculty
member or knowledgeable per.
son as a sponsor. When the group
has completed its study, its tind-
ings will be presented during cot-
tee hours or dinner discussions:

Second, a limited number oi Iec~
turesAtwo or three at most—with
th most prominent leaders of the
civil rights movement—Martin
Luther King, c. T. Vivian, James
Farmer, Hosea Williams and Roy
Wilkins were mentioned—are
planned but have reached only the
idea stage. Karen Olson didn’t
rule out the possibility of invit-
ing a member of the Ku Klux
Klan to the campus “to stir up
a little controversy on campus,”
as she put it

Third, in addition to the Le-
Moyne College student exchange
program, which no Grinnell stu-
dent took advantage or this se-
mester, a slum project in Des

 

Moilles appropriately enti-
tled "The Des Moines Project” ~
promises to be the group's major
undertaking or its short history.
probably in conjunction with the
Students for a Democratic Soci-
ety group, the social action com-
mittee oi the Board of Religion,

and other student groups on cam-
pus, the Civil Rights Group plans
to work in the “Bottoms" dis-
trict where presently there are un-
paved streets, limited plumbing

Educare’s First Meeting Attracts 50,
Winters Speaks About Student Apathy

In the initial meeting or Edu~
care, the new Grinnell College ed-
ucation association, Associate
Dean Richard H. Winters spoke to
a group or so students and taculty
members about the apathy of to
day's college students.

Winters blamed the present lack
of enthusiasm on outside pres-
sures.

“This is a generation of tested
and measured students. They are
too concerned with grades. But it
there were no grades, how could
a student’s comparative standing
with other students in the college,
or even in the nation, be mea-
sured?”

Winters went on to say that he
had never heard ot a completely
uniﬁed college except tor "cer-
tain seasons and sports."

"There can be no unity or spirit
or interest. There is usually a nu-
cleus for diversified interests.
Each student must find an area
with which he can identify," Win-
ters stated.

“The college community is a
corporate body. Within and be-
yond one's scli,
community must

The associate dean ended his

thoroughly they control the situa<
lion. They aren't aware of the ter~
rifying responsibility they have.
The students have to create their
own environment beyond th 3
rules."

Answering a suggestion that the
students need guides for behavior,
Dr. Leggett said, ”Maybe you

The rest of Saturday was spent
in individual discussion groups.

On Sunday morning, discussion
group chairmen presented sum.
maries or their groups' talks,

The hall his group reported that
members of that committee had
agreed that there was a lack of
responsibility and maturity on
north campus.

To help alleviate this situation,
the group suggested several vari-
eties of “integrated dorms,” in-
cluding alternating men's and
women’s halls on north and south
campus or making one campus
exclusively upperclass and the
other entirely lowerclassl

The academic discussion group
recommended a syllablls of every

professors so that students can
learn what is expected in each
course.

This committee also suggested
that students of sophomore stand-
ing and above be allowed to take
