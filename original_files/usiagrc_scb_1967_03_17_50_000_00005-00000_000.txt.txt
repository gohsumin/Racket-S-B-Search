To the Editor:

Having read Mr. Jones’ let-
ter, I feel bound not. to defend
myself, but to correct some
(also impressions.

In the iii-st place, I was in-
vited hy the Scarlet & Black
to review the opening night oi
the show and not to “have re
maitied one or two more nights
heiore making (his) Judg-
merits.“ Whether a show he
collegiate or protessional, the
practice ct revrewing on the
first night is not deemed un-
tisiial. Indeed, when I was un»
der the impression that certain
things were under par because
it was the opening night, I
noted them as such in lily art-
icle.

I am not sure what Mr.
Jones means when he says he
was “given the review to
read“ and it thereupon spoiled
his enjoyment of the play.
Surely it was up to Mr. Jones
and no one else whether or

not he chose to read the re-

view.

As for being preoccupied
with "dramatically and techni-
cally protessional theatre,” may
I remind Mn Joncs, that as a
student at the University hf
Iowa, I encounter college pm-
duotions all thc time. The
point is that in choosing to
perform so sophisticated and
ditticult a play as “After the
Fall,” the company assumes a
certain responsibility. what I
as a reviewer am interested in
is not so much “professional”
theatre, hut GOOD theatr .. I
never saw the Elia Kazan
production of the play. I
matched the production
against nothing but itscli and
what seemed to me to be its
olln aims and foul lines, and i
found not that the performance
was especially lacking (it you
\lill re-read the article), but
that the play itselt tell short.

Finally. let me assure Mr.
Jones, that it he came away
moved and involved with the
play, i am more than pleased.
When so much etiort and time
has gone into a show (any
show), I would much rather
see it work than fail, and will
be happily proved wrong.
George Bernard shaw, when ac.
cused of ruining a play's
chances in a review, argued
that it a work is really good.
