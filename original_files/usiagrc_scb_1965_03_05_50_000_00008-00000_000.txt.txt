Distinguished GuestI
Discusses Polymers

By Susan Barquist

Dr. Charles Overberger was
greeted by a record tumrout as
he addressed the Gl’innell stu-
dent affiliate chapter of the
American Chemical Society last
Friday afternoon. Dr. Over-
berger, professor of organic
chemistry and dean oi science
at Polytechnic Institute of
Brooklyn and director of the
Polymer Research Institute,
spoke on the chemistry of mar
cromolecules.

Dr. Overberger summarized
the problems to be tackled in
polymer chemistry and then
discussed two particular, cur
rent research projects.

The basic process in polymer
or macromolecule chemistry
is “making large molecules out
of small ones." Molecules can
be induced to farm chains and
networks of chains by several
methods. In general a catalyst
is used.

In studying polymer reactions
there are several areas of in-
teresL: end groups, chemical
structure, dis t r i bution of
chains, and stereochemistry
(the relative position of atoms
or groups of atoms in a mole-
cule). The last category is that
in which the greatest recent
progress has been made. There
are a variety of ways a given
group can arrange itself in a
molecule. Often a catalyst will
direct this arrangement in a
specific way. These arrange-
ments (configurations) each
have their own properties and
characteristics, Important re-
search questions include: 1)
how can it be shown that pre—
ferred conformations exist in
solutions as well as in crystals,
2) what is the influence of stero-
chemistry on physical proper-
ties. 3) how is it possible to
change stereo structure by us»
ing dilrerent catalysts.

The two specific research pra-
jECts discussed dealt with opti-
cal properties of a synthetic
protein molecule and the cata-
lytic effect of an enzyme re-
moved from natural conditions.

Oily Study Available
For Spring Vacation

Ten Gl‘innell students will
have a chance to spend a week
of spring vacation in Chicago
working with two church-re-

lated inner-city projects and
several secular organizations to
study the problems of the city.
The program will run from
March 27 [0 April 1, but stu-
dents wishing to spend more
time in the project may do so.

The program has been ar-i

By Sue Johnson

Back In the days when Vic-
toria ruled in England and
Gates ruled at Grinnell, issues
or the 5&3 reflected the in.

fluence of both the aiore-men-
honed personages. Despite the
astounding number of varia<
tions on two themes (”John
Q. Student received a
visit from his parents on Sun-
day” and “Purity Pays"), the
189971900 5&3 did manage to
scrape up a few items worth
the paper on which it was
printed.

At that timE. Grinnell was
still known as Iowa College and
was divided into three branches
of study: Group System of
Studies, lowa College Academy,
and Iowa College School of Mn-
sic. In 1899, after a reception
for the men students new to
Iowa College, it was reported.
“President Gates then gave one
at his valuable talks, emphasiz-
ing the purity of social life
among college students."

The library at the turn of the
century was located in Good-
now hall, and one editorial
reads, “The dark, cloudy days
of the past weeks have em-
phasized again the need of hav—
ing Goodl‘low hall lighted.” It
is interesting to note that no
such protest was made about
the chapel buildlng, in which
social gatherings were held.

The sophomore class of 1900
showed one of the highly intro
quent bursts ot devilishness
when it rallied and locked the
freshman class out of the
chapel building on the night of
the freshman class party.

At one of its meetings the
Calocogathia Society discussed
the private lives of “present
day rulers." Included were the
czar of Russia, Wi iam of Ger-
many, and “Queen Victoria and
her ramily lire". . .0)

Showing a typical 1965 vote
of confidence in the intellect
and reason of the student body,
one of the editorials of 1900
reads. “The election of Dr. F.
K. Sanders to succeed Pre -
dent Gates was announced this
week. While the students are
not qualified to select a man
tor president, and their judg-
ment in regard to such a selec-
tion could be questioned, no
one doubts but that they thor-
oughly appreciate the task
that was before the trustees to
ﬁnd a man to take up the work
where President Gates leaves
it”

Another editorial advocates
social reforms:

“In a faraway land, where,

people have strange ways and
look askance at customs much
different from ours, there was
once a nice little college in a

 

nice little town. This little col~
lege had always prided itselt on
its reputation ot living in a
pure, clean atmosphere, and or
preserving a comparatively
high standard of morality,
which, tradition said, had been
maintained since the beginning
of its history."

But one day ﬂier: was a foot~
ball game. A team tron-i a
neighboring institution came
over to this little college and
played for the championship.
The game was very onersided,
and the home team had small
trouble in winning a decided
victory.

“But, during the progress of
the game and as the final re-
sult became more certain, the
visitors on the gridiron and
along the side lines grew ir—
ritated and, being further ot-
fended by sundry flagrant visa
lations of scientific football in
their own team, gave vent to
their teelings in language loud
and strong

”It was said they swore —
and awlully, too — oaths which
were plainly heard from the
grandstand. This hurt the feel—
ings of the little college. The
little college rather thought
that, out of respect to the ladies
present, such language ought
not be used.

“But, oh no! not in that tar-
pwoy land where people have
strange, oh such strange ways.
Surely the little college has
ideals too high; if it could see
games in our Own land, where
loud swearing is oilen a fea«
ture, it would adopt more liba
eral standards. But then this
all took place in a land far, fal‘
away. . ."

And long, long ago.
