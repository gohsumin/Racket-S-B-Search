What's Expected

Today Steve Kent was elected SGA president. He
was elected by a huge margin,

Throughout the campaign Kent and the other can-
didates have spoken of lack of student involvement. It
became the key word of the election.

New Kent is faced with the problem of taking this
”Catch phrase” and turning it into some kind of work—
ing reality. His first step will be a questionnaire to find
out where the students interest is. Beyond this, what
Kent can do is a question with which we are all con-
cerned.

The lack of student involvement, according to
Kent during the election, was in part the fault of the
Goddard administration. This is a strong criticism and
we think it is important that as Kent takes office he
keeps it in mind.

It is the duty and responsibility of the SGA presi—
dent to evoke student response. He cannot find safety
in saying I can’t do anything because the student body
is apathetic. During the next few months we shall
watch and hope that Kent has some method of stimu-
lating Grinnell students, of lifting them from their
state of profound apathy. If he can’t do this then the
words of his own campaign will most assuredly come
back to haunt him — from both Goddard, who knows

how difficult a task that is, and from the 5&8, who
doesn’t know it for sure but Who suspects it strongly.

 

It Only Took Two

Convention Ballots

Saturday's convention ended rather abruptly with only two ballots.
The first or instructed ballot was almost totally jag since 161 votes were
cast for unconventional candidates and were thus termed uncommitted
0f the actual candidates running. “We love you" Er Brow won 36 votes
followed by Wittgrai with 30, Shender with 21 and Kent with 15,

The second and rinal ballot was taken more seriously and became a

whirl oi changing votes in the last few minutes.

Final results are as iollows;

(on motion Sees Kent over Wittgruf
dsSlionderDelegutionlendsSupport

By PAUL BRADLEY

Steve Kent today was elected
SGA President.

Thus ended a hectic weekend for
Steve Kent which began with the
nominating speeches in Saturday's
convention In their speeches all
three students nominating Kent
emphasized their candidates past
achievements but again reiterated
the campaign theme oi student in»
Volvement.

Nord Brue gave a delailed ac-
count of Kent’s active role in
college aiiairs, while Dorothy
Dosse spoke oi how “99 percent
talk or active strident govern-
ment, but only one percent ac-
tually do the hard work i
valved,” and that “encamp-
ments are useless unless some-
body is willing to do the work

Non-Subtle Humor

Provides Respite
From Campaign

Kicking up a clcurl oi peanut
shells and sawdust, Grinnell
plunged into the political arena
with the sen convention Saturday.

Although the Main Hall Sisters of
Salvation and Road's seamen of
the as Slo-Come proved avid
demonstrators, the backers of E.
Brow, the “intellectual” candidate,
exhibited the greatest degree of
student involvement and enthiisi»
asm during the course oi hot cam<
paigning and parleying.

Kris Nash, in his nomination
speech, succinctly stated E.
Brow's platiorm and qualifica-
tions: “He is not winning as a
member of Honor G, he is not
running as a representative and
employee oi SAGA roads, but as
a grosspolitician in support oi
intellectuals on campus."

As tar as the ﬁrst balloting
went. some of the more success-
iul attempts at wit included:

One vote to the South preps (ls
it true blondes really have more
fun?)

One vote to the William Penn
boys. who seem to think that
Grinnell is where the action is

Two to the departed members of
Read Hall, who had to leave in
order to Show that Grinnell has
not yet gone to pot

One vote to the last visible testi-
mony of Carl Otis Gray, the bad
check list in the Book Store

One vote to the Rex, the campus
retreat from the Pepsi generation

One vote to the boys in the bot—
tom half of their class

Two votes to the CIA and two
votes to AP.

ED NOTE: I’d like to take
this npportuniiy Io thank the
people who helped us put out
[his special issue of the 5&3.
John Turek and the rest of the
people at the Newton Daily
News — the people who print
the 5&3 —- were more than co-
operative. Henry Wilhelm, co-
ediinr of the Cyclone, assisted
John Wait and lne in covering
the convention photographicnlly
and in editing the over 600
pictures that we look. A special
thanks to the election board for
making Ihe results available to
us so rapidly.

 

required after the encampment
is finished,"

Finally Ray Horn spoke on the
task of Student government for “if
student government proves to the
student body that it can get re-
sults, only Ihen will the students
really become involved in campus
issues." Horn ended the Kent
nominations with, “Only elfeclive
student leadership can give ellec—
tive student government. VOTE
FOR STEVE KENT! !”

During the early part or Ihe
balloting, hopes in the convention
were not very high for Kent,
especially when he only received
ﬁfteen votes on Ihe ﬁrst ballot,
the lowest of the three candi-
dates. As preparations were be-
ing made by Kent’s iloor cam-
paigners for the second roll call,
the estimate for his strength
was around so delegates. How-
ever, as me second roll call
progressed and every hall gave
their votes it soon became ap-
parent rhat Kent and Witlgraf
were on their way to an easy
Victory.

 

When it became apparent that
Wiltgral and Kent were Ihe lu'u
victors, Steve shender, the third
candidate, appeared on the plat-
form to concede victory, Shen-
der thanked his workers for ties
voting so much lime to his cause
and said, “I didn't believe lhnl
anybody could get people fired."
In conceding victory, Steva
threw his support behind another

Candidate, "I don't think there’s

any doubt in onyone’s mind who
should be the next SGA President.

I support Steve Kent for the Pres-
idency."

Afterwards Kent said that he
was very happy about the con—
velllilnl results, and said, “1 am
thankful ior Shender‘s support,
it’s going to be a diiiicult ﬁght.”
Kent made one iinal request,
“Send people to me C of HP,
the AWS Bnal‘d and the senate
who are willing and active and
alert, and i think i can promise
you an son with a record oi
accomplishment diiiicult to
equal."

 

Wiilgraf Emerges from Conflict
Wilh lag of level-Headed Realist

By MARTHA BERKEY

George Wittgrai came out oi the
convention with solld support and
enough votes ior nomination on
roll call of [he first serious bal-
lot.

Wittgraf’s sound platiorm oi
student — faculty cooperation was
echoed in his nominating and sec-
ondlng speeches. In his speech or
nomination. Dick Reichmann
called for "a carefully reasoned
program oi student action.”

Reichmann characterized Witt-
graf‘s program as not only con-
taining “21 series or speciﬁc, pra-
gmatic goals attainable in the
immediate future," but also having
“the further merit of introducing
student opinion as a vital motor
in determining the policies oi the
college.”

Secondlng speeches were made
by Anne Hogansun, Jan Streiii,
and David Lighthourne.

Miss Hoganson stressed Wilt<
grai's record oi achievement and
his “realistic, practical steps to a
feasible goal,” While Miss Streiff
urged students to support Wiltgrai
(or a “government With students
rather than above students."

Lightboume drew a laugh irorn
the crowd as he said, “My iasci-
nation with personality politics
and SGA gamesmanship rises to
active disenchantment only when
it manages to escape proiound
apathyr"

 

Lighthourne saw that—whatever
the future course of SGA—“our
one prime consideration” must be
[0 choose “that candidate who can
carry on level-headed relations
with the administration on a daily
basis." He therefore supported
Wittgraf as “a candidate With the
intelligence and imagination to
conceive oi SGA in an entirely
new way. a candidate with the
impetus to broaden the base at
student participation in this com-
munity."

As the voting came in, Wittgrat
carried three halls completely and
had a substantial majority in
three more. Kent carried one hall
and had good support Irom others;
Shender Carried two halls. Then
vote switching began. Cowles
changed from 100 per Cent back-
ing oi E. Brow to substantially
Kent support Shender lost his two
halls, and was obviously on the
way out.

Rather than be graciously voted
out, however, Shender got up to ,
throw support to Kent and a little
mud to Wittgrai. His unexpected
method or withdrawing put a
peculiar twist on the mob enthusi—
asm and a peculiar end to the
convention. Later. Wittgral said,
"it's too bad. Personal antagon-
isms will build up over this which
will last for months; and in the
meantime, people will forget all
about SGA within a week.”
