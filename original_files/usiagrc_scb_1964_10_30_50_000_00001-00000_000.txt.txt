Mrs. Goodbroil Takes Administrative
Post to Work with Tradition, Rules

By Nancy Gromko

-“The sole function of the new-
ly created Quadrangle Office
is to answer questions which
bear upon tradition and college
rule," states Mrs. Harriet
Goodbrod, assistant dean of wa-
men.

“Due to the increase in col-
lege growth, the administra-
tion felt a need for an office
devoted to Quadrangle interests
alone,” the assistant dean
stated. "This Will leave Dean
Slocum free to concentrate on
counseling and far-range plan-
ning.”

The new office, concerned
with routine aflairs, serves to
relate regulations and respon-
sibilities to the individual girl.
“Our purpose,” Mrsr Good-
brod continued, “is to help the
Grinnell women conform to the
established pattern of college
life.”

“Any institution which ac-
cepts money for the care of an
individual,” she explained,
“must know at all times where
the individual‘is. Thus one of
our biggest responsibilities is
to regulate the daily checking
in and out of students.”

This ‘»”co-ordinating office"
works closely with the quad so»
cial chairman to plan activities
for girls, such as houseparties
and divhy‘rambs.

Mrs. Goodbrod, a graduate of

 

the University of Nebraska, has

MRS. GOODBROD

been teaching in the education
department at Grinnell since
1960. For the past three years
she has supervised student
teachers in elementary educa-
tion.

Asked her reaction to the cur-
rent effectiveness of the new
office, Mrs. Goodbrod replied,
“What has impressed me most
is how long there must have
been a need for such an of-
fice.”

Mrs. Ravitts and Mrs. Main,
housemothers of Mears and
Main, will also be assuming re-
sponsibilities in the new Quad-
rangle office.

time to talk with Kierek and
Gaines.

“1 am studying law because
