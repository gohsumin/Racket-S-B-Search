cumstances of the meet. The
cold and damp weather was the
same for both teams but the
Pioneers had a tough time ne~
gotialing the hills of the course,
giving Monmouth an advantage
right away.

With Sharpe and Montgomery
gone, Obermiller estimated that
the Pioneers lost ten points
that would have given them a
win.

The coach, though, is still not

give Carleton a tough run for

but the team has yet to come
up to that potential.

perimenting with new players
in the backfield, trying to get
more heft into the running
game.

The Beloit Buccaneers will
come to Ward Field also in the
midst or a slump. Aiter beating
Knox 426 and Coe 36-14, the
Bucs have lost their last two
ball games 2149 In Carleton
and last week 36-0 to St. Olaf.

Beloit has one of the most
explosive olienses in the league.
Relying mainly on a poweriul
air attack, they can score any-
time. A majority of the offense
is due to the passing combina-
tion of Rick Stutz and George
Lindenberg. Lindenberg is con-
sidered to be one of the best
ends in the league and Stutz
was instrumental in the defeat
the Bucs gave the Pioneers last
year at Beloit.

The running attack though is
below average and must teams
that have been able to contain
the passing attack have been
able to stop Beloit. This is what
happened at St. Olaf last week
when Beloit was able to com-
plete only 14 of 39 passes.

This week Coach Bowers has
to build up the size of his back-
iicld, Against Monmouth the
Pioneers were not able to score
a Couple of times when they
got close to the goal because
they were too small to move
out the Scots.

Monmouth was able to score
a fluke touchdown when 2 Mon-
mouth player temporarily tum.
bled a punt but picked it up
and caught all the Pioneer de.
tenders running the wrong di-
rection and went all the way
{or a score. Their other touch-
down came after they had
blocked a Pioneer punt on the

15 yard line. The Pioneers also
scored twice, once on a pass to
Mike Schwartz, but were bi:-
hind in the fourth quarter 34-13
after missing a 2»point conver—
sion. Twice the Pioneers drove
deep into Monmouth territory
but were stalled and had to try
field goals. The first one was
wide and the second was short.

Coach Bowers has decided [u
shift hardrrunnillg Rich Weeks
from quarterback to halfback.
Weeks picked up 110 yards run-
ning last week and is expected
to be just as tough at halfback.
Moving in to the quarterback
slot will be either Tom Lower
Dr Kent Thomson. Rounding out
the backﬁeld will be Don Krait—
sik at the other halfback and
Jon Buswell at fullback. With
this backfield Bowers expects
to be able to grind out more
yardage on the ground, espe-
cially up the middle where the
small Pioneer linemen have
been haying trouble moving out
their opponents.

Bowers is not planning to
make any great changes in the
line. At center Don Malum may
replace Bob Geller, Ken Aug-
ustine may be called on to play
some offense in addition to his
detensivs duties, and Mike
Schwartz may be given more
work at offensive end. Aside
from this the line will stay in-
tact.

The Pioneer defense has been
steadily improving and Bowers
is quite pleased with it. But
Beloit's defense is also tough
and, aside from last week, has
been very impressive.

Both Beloit’s offense and die
tense ore third in the league
while the Pioneer offense is
sixth and the defense fifth.

 

If we do something that dis-
pleases you, TELL its. WE are al-

ways glad to hear constructivo

criticism. Of course we may chase

you out with a butcher knife .
