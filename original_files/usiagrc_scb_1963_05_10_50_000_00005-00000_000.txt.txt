burst in the third inning of the
nightcap broke open a 3‘2 ball
game and turned it into a rout,

in Tuesday's game Hanssen
came up vvith another fine hur-
ling performance giving up only
two hits while striking out l1
on the way to a 2-1 victory.
Still, his fine pitching effort
would have come to naught had
it not been for some ninth in
ning heroics by the Pioneer
batters

pitch over the left field fence
against a stiff Wind for a game

ran their record to 6-1. Playing

two lost for the first time 6-3,
6-3 to Jack Ankerson and Jim

The Ripon meet was at home
on Friday, Lawrence at home on
Saturday and Coe away the

so close together coach Bowers
was able to use ten men.

red when number four man Bob

not play on Saturday. Sixth man

Tomorrow’s meet with St. Olaf

rates the Oies as better than
Lawrence and Ripon and just
below Carleton.
