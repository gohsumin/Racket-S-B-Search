Play Questioned

Lust week-end the Grinnell
community was given a special
treat: a protessional periorni-
ance ot a poor obscure Greek
play, At this point, i leave the
review to the critics and ques-
tion the decision to produce the
play in the iii-st place as well
as the so-caued “casting."

Our theatre department seems
to have lost any incentive to
produce plays that will be or
educative value or simply iii-
teresting to either the actors or
the audience. Our connections
with Peter Amot and the Mil-
wankec Repertory are both'cx—
citing. but it seems that there
is no conceivable excuse [or the
absorption or drama tunds tor
then-.nse. The second semester
budget allows for two major pro~
ductiolls. We have seen one—
tllr other will be a musical late
in the semester (which will not
be ahie to involve all serious
drama students, who are leit
to lawrbudget one-acts in the
Arena). l will admit you can

. learn ei great deal by watching
protessioiials, but when will stu-
dents have a chance to apply
what they've learned? The ques-
tion is not “a good perionnance
by prolessiollals” or “a bad per-
torniaiice by students." We have
had the worst: an inelfectual
production by pmiessionals that
deprived students or the right
to demonstrate their talents for
the criticism and enjoyment or
the college community. Again,
we have a classic example or
this college trying to suppress
student spontaneity, and under.
mining confidence in students'
desire to learn by doing.

l think the drama department
owes it students ol the perform-
ing art. more than a token ac-
knowledgement Give the one
act: to the pros and let the stu-
dents use the resources set up
for their use.

Open Minded?

To the Editor:

Now i am not one to defend
Apple pie, motherhood, or God
and country without reserva-
tions, nor am i one to repudi-
ate, without reservations, the
value of maturity at nude-ins.
What l do deplore categorically
is the hypocrisy or some of the
“open-minded" students who in-
habit this campus. A golden ex-
ample oi this hypocrisy was
printed in the 5&3 last week
under the title “Come all
people, now . . First the
author took 243 words (give or
take a lew) to tell me that the
students oi Grinnell are a bunch
01 button llpped, establishment-
bound automatons who brush
their teeth but don't look at
their bodies when they take
showers — at best a generaliza-
tion well steeped in verbosity,
and at most, Worth about 205
Words of wasted ink.

Aller sitting Out the spirit of
the author's condemnation, 1
real! .ed that he had a point. He
' , indeed accurate in chance
te ‘ig our ‘apathetic or (to
coin a wotd),unoutspoken Stur
dent body.

1 was especially amused,

however, at one of the examples
the author used in his Chorale
terlzation. Hc reierred m a let-
ter, signed by 7 women, coli-
denining the Gates Hall demoti-
stration. lroriically, he chose
this example or student energy
to put into a context ol student
apathy. in disagreeing with the
argument or that letter he in-
sulted our intelligence by dis-
carding it without su much as
a hint or rational argument. Ap-
parently, ii oiitspolien students
do not agree with the author
he throws out their opinions be-
cause they are inane and not
worth the lime to debate reason-
ably. The students who say
nothing at all incur his wrath
for being apathetic.

Therefore, (0 have a brain in
one's hcad one must agree un-
equivocaily with the author. He
appointed himseli judge, jury.
and executioner; indeed. he
must be the god or reason. Un-
fortunatclv, that deity went out
with the Greeks.

Grinnell Defendéd

To the Editor:

The discussion between Stu-
dents and taculty members last
Sunday night leit the cold. it is
one thing to negatively and
rather maliciously deplore Grin
nell's “Conservative" education
al system; or as o e student so
witheringly put i the Grinnell
Marshmallow.‘ it is quite an»
other to positively and seriously
sit down with protessurs and
other students in your discipline
or related disciplines and a"
cuss workable means of prov‘
ing the most variety and in .
vidiial creativity within the
curriculum. 1 repeat “the most
variety and individual creativ-
ity" because sortie students so
often tail to acknowledge the
time limits oi protessors (espe-
cially good proiessors) not to
mention money and department
size as inherent limitations to
the number of new educational
possibilities. Negativism win-
out a positive and sincere de—
sire to 'worlt ior improvement
within the “system's" limita—
tions is not only impotent but
depressiiigly sell-righteous. Neg~
ative (and i use the term pejor-
atively) is, of course, an indu-
lent state or being.

Oil behalt oi the positivists in
both iaculty and student camps,
1 Wish to resluie some of the at
tempts to improve not only
faculty-student relationships but
the educatlmlal curriculum.

Glick Answers Gray

To the Editor:

In a letter to the 58d! last
week Mr. Bill Gray argued liis
posttion on many issues. i would
like to reply to all of them, as
I disagree with almost all at
them, but for lack Di space I
Will coniine myseli to a much
bmztdcr topic which, l ice], coin
ers in sufficient degree each Dl'
his points.

Mr. Gray. to the best or my
knowledge. did not attend the
n iig held at Conference
House one week after the dim-
otistrution at which the demon-
strators attempted and i be-
lieve succeeded, in showing
other people why they felt their
action was necessary. 1 also
wonder it Mr. Gray has ever
tallied personally with those
who took part in the demonstra-
tion. It so, i give my apologies
to Mr. Gray, but i sincerely
doubt that such is the case. I
believe [his lack of any attempt
to comprehend the reasons for
such an action, one wlllcli goes
against almost all prevailing so
cietal values, is nothing less
than tragic,

Most members or society look
at what happens. not why, and
they make no attempt to under-
stand lhe actions of other hil-
man beings It is this attempt
at understanding that has to
come belole there can ever be
a democratic society, a society
collcemed with human values,
as opposed to the concern now
with objects, money, and power.

i wonder it Mr. Gray agrees
with acllon of Mrs Rosa Parks
when, in 1955, she decided that
she was sick or being treated
as less than a human being and
thus sat down in the white see
tion of the bus in Montgomery,
Alabalita.' why didn’t she talii
it out with the bus driver? Per-
haps because she and many
millions of others had been
talking about it tor over 300
years, but she didnt reel that
things had really improved as
much as should be the case. As

This is a beginning and a
great deal more can be done it
and when more students and
iaciilty take not only an active
but a constructive interest in
educational improvements, '

a result Mrs. Parks used action,
instead ol merely words. to
make her point. From thill
seemingly small and isolated
event came the civil rights
movement with an impact so
strong, although even now only
in the beginning stages, that it
seems incredible that it could
have been started In such a
way.

i have heard. in the past two
weeks, “silly, childish, and un-
wise" and other similarly de—
rogatory words being used to
describe the demonstrators It
is my guess that nine out at ten
cl those who use these words
have not attempted to talk [a
the participants, or having
neither the time nor the desire
to do that. have not trictl to
analyze either the p is
reasons (or such an aetion or
the possible bcnelicial eliccts
or it on society,
