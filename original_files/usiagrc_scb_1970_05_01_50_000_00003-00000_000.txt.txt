College Approves Program To Help
Blocks To Live In Clusters In Holls

By Mark Sableman

A plan which would allow a
number of black iipperclassmen
and freshmen to live in the
same dormitory next year has
been approved by the college,
The so-called “Younker proe
posal" is designed to help ease
the problems of adjustment.
both social and academic,
which black freshmen face
when first coming to Grinnell.

As plans now stand. there
will be ten llppel‘ClaSS black
men in North Younker. arid
eight upperclass black women
in South Younker, Entering
black freshmen will be sent a
special letter, asking if they
would like to live in Younker.

Associate Dean of Students
Conney Kimbo. who has been
involved with this proposal
since its inception, plans to fill
no more than approximately
forty of the 106 spaces in Youn-
lter witll black students. Dean'
Kimbo said that black students
will be scattered throughout all
the floors in Younker.

The plan is optional for all
black students. It is the out-
growth of an earlier proposal
by the Concerned Black Stu-
dents (CBS) for an all-black
floor, and the final plan was
decided on just last Monday.

The original proposal by
CBS, an all~black floor, was
sent to the Student Housing
Committee appointed by the
Student Senate last month, It
contained a number of reasons
for the need for a living situa-
tion which would provide an
“atmosphere that would pro-
mote better adjustment to Grin-
nell by black freshmen."

The Housing Committee rer
fcrred the proposal, with their
approval, to the Student Deans
office. Last Saturday. Dean
Kintbo and President Leggett
discussed it with the CBS com-
inittee of Quinton Phea, Larry
Wright. and David Lewis,

Both Leggett and Kimbo felt
that the request for an all-black
floor was unwise. but that the
reasons given for the need for
some kind of special orienta-
tion for black students were.
in Leggett’s words. "very per-
sttasive.”

Last year, a kind of informal
“cluster arrangement" was fol—
lowed iii assigning black sttlr
dents to domiitories; for ex~
ample, several dormitories
have five or six black students.

Last week, President Leg~
gett informed several of the
Trustees who have special in-
terests in this area, of the CBS
proposal for an all black floor.
and asked for their opinions.
President Leggett spoke to
Mr. Robert Noyce (chairman
of the Board of Trustees). Mr.
Lawrence Towner (Vice-Chair-
man), and Mrs Elizabeth
Kruldenier, a trustee who has
been involved in civil rights
work in Des Moines Dean Kim4
on spoke to Mr. James Lowrey,
a Trustee who is a black gradu-
ate of Grinnell. All four of
those Trustees felt that black
freshmen would need some oriv
entatioii. but preferred to do
this without having a black
floor.
