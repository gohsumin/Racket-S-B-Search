submitted to the university
president tlor approval.)

The basic premise on which
our recommendation is based
is that a resident University
such as Stanford should try
to provide optimum living con.
ditions for those of its students
who choose or are required to
live on campus. Dorm residents,
especially those required to
live in dorms, should have free.
dom to choose, individually and
collectively, how housing facili-
ties will be used. We do not, of
course, mean to suggest that
each student can or should be
given absolute freedom to de
termine how he or she will live
in a University residence. Some
regulations are obviously neces
sary in the interests of health,
safety, sanitation, the protection
of property and tile mainten-
ance of pleasant living and stir-
dy conditions.

Every restriction on a stir»
dent's use of his own room

ought to have an affirmative
justification besides the fact
that it is traditional. Further,
limitations on use should be de-
termined by dorm residents
rather than hv University rogue
lations.

in our view, the underlying
matter of principle involved in
the open house issue has alrca-
dy been do a by the Uni-
versity. Visitor of the opposite
sex are now permitted to be in
tlle rooms of Stanford students
for substantial periods of‘time
each week. Consequently we
have not debated the accent»
ability of open house as a mat-
ter ot principle, but instead
have concentrated on two prag-
matic questions:

1, Should the number of
permissible open house
hours each week be expand.
ed if the students so da-
sire?

2. Who should decide if
and to what extent open
house hours should be eit-
pandedi

Our answer is that, subject
to certain limitations discussed
below, open house hours should
be those Which are agreed up-
on by the students in each resi-

dence, except for freshmen
G

residences during the autumn
quarter, to set their own open
house hours. provided that an
open house would not be per
mittcd to last beyond 2:30 am.
or begin betore 10:00 am.

We do not believe, on the
basis of the evidence that has
been presented to us, that most
residences will in fact set open
house hours at or even near
the maximum which our pm-
posed regulations would permit.
We propose a “basic" open
house regulation, to prevail in
the absence of affirmative ace
tioii by the students concerned.
The “basic” regulation would
permit open house tour days
a week from noon to midnight.

in reaching our conclusions,
we have carefully considered
the argument that open houses
inconvenience a o m a stu-
dents. We rcilize that wlnlc
there is widespread student
support for expanded open
house hours, there may be some
students who will feel that the
privacy and informality of their
residence will be impaired by a
more liberal open house policy,
The problem of balancing these
competing interests is a delicate
and difficult one, but it seems
clear to us that they must be
balanced rather than he re-
solved wholly one way or the
other.

We have concluded that the
most practical and educational.
ly desirable way to strike the
necessary accommodation is tor
the students in each residence
to balance the various coinpct
ing interests themselves, pro-
vided only that minority Iter-
csts are adequately cor ’dered
and protected. With reference
to roommates, this is justly one
of many questions which they
inust resolve in mutually ac-
ceptable ways.

We realize that not everyone
agrees that inconvenience and
privacy are the only relevant

considerations in determining
open house limitations, For
some it central concern to
whether a more liberal open
house policy will encourage sort-
ual relationships among std
dents. We think this false issue
is exaggerated. students deny
ﬂint they seek more liberal
open house hours for such pur
poses, and comment that a Unl-
versity residence is not an ideal
or even a likely place for sexual
relationships.

in recommending modified
open house regulations, we ex-
pect that living conditions for
those students who choose or
are required to live on campus
will be improved. We make
this recommendation in the ex-
pectation that Stanford stu-
dents will oomply with the pro-
ccc-rai requirements recom-
mended, will respect the rights,
preferences and sensitivities of
all students involved, and will
observe and support the en-
forcement of the limitations on
open house hours which would
be established by or under—
the proposed regulations,
Should our proposal be adopted
and these expectations not be
realized, the matter of open
house policy should than, in
our opinion, be immediately re-
considered.
