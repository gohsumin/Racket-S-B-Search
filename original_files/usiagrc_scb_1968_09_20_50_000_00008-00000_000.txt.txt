Pioneers vs.

After two iairly poor sea.
Ions (both 2-6). most students
have predicted that we're in for
another bad year. Hints oi a
strange optimism can be seen
in those who know something
about this year’s team. Rumors
or a “new look" and “maybe
‘win hall" can be heard around
the “inner” circles.

The “new look” starts with
the two new coaches, Conney
Kilnbo from Indiana University
and Ray Boyd, tormerly head
Iootball coach from Grinnell
x-tigh School Coach Bowers,
who has proven his ability with
the right material, is still head
iootball coach.

With only nine returning let-
termen, part or the new look
will be the players themselves;
many members or the last
year’s undefeated freshman
team will hold starting posi-
tions this year. Steve Hutch<
ings shows potential as a line-
backer and Alex Karlin should
have a great year at delensive
tacklci Larry Grimm and Jim
Edwards are agile but big and
are likely to do a fine job at
the guard positionsi Roy Lewis
is out With an ankle injury, but
should soon he ready to play
again Roy's big, fast, and has
excellent moves.

The success oi the season.

however, will mainly depend on
the returning lettermen. Rumor
has it that the captains Bob
Lillis and Don Kraitsik have
sadistically hard workouts.

For those of us who love to
Watch hard hitting tullbacks,
Jon Buswell's backt Jon spent
last year in Costa Rica and he
should have a good year.

Bryan Barnes is lighting to
keep his position at haliback,
and from the way he is running,
he might hold it.

Don Kraitsilt will be the wing~
back, and he's another hard
hitting runner,

Doug Fink will be starting
quarterback, the only junior
letterman, Doug threw some
line passes last year, and could
have a good season

The new look in oiiense is ru-
mored to be an “I” formation
with a permanent “up" and
“down" side.

The opener tomorrow against
St. olat should be a very tough
game. They only graduated
two starters and are picked to
win the Midwest Conference
this year. The iirst chance
most of us will have to see this
year’s team will be next Sat-
urday, the iirst home game,
when we meet our annual ri-
vals, Cornell, Be sure to make
that one, support the team and
see it you aren't surprised by
the “new look"—the beginning
or a good year for Grinnell ath—
letics (its about time”)

STUDENTS INVENT NEW COURSE

A new course is included in
this year's curriculum because
oi the eitorts of a group or stu<
dents. Philosophy 101, Seminar
in Ethical Discussion, was cre
ated as an experiment to serve
two iunctions: l) to provide a
course in Ethics based on the
students’ own assumptions and
interests rather than the history
of ethics, and 2) to reason out
a series of rundamentai ques-
tions tor group discussions in
the resident halls.

According to Grant Crandall
and Donald Stump, both '69,
Who initiated the idea of the
class, it was accepted by the
philosophy department and by
a general vote or the racuity
last spring with only minor
changes in the students' pro-
posal. The readings and weekly
schedule of topics for the two
credit seminar were worked out
with the instructors, Mr, Haas
and Mt: Worley.

The first eight weeks will be
spent in arguing philosophical
questions like the existence or
tree Will and the ultimate goal
or man. The remaining weeks
will be spent in applying the
distinctions made to problems
of current importance, such as
those posed by Black Power,

drug use, and premarital sex.
Students select their own reada
ings trom lists of short articles,
both ancient and modern, rep<
resenting major ethical sys-
tems. Forty students are par-
ticipating in the experiment and
about thirty more were closed
out, Haas said,

South," reminded M a r I l.
“Younkers is the only exception
The social experiment is not
here, contrary to what the ad
ministration says."

One pro-administration argu-
ment is that the plans for altera
hating dorms will not necessari-
ly house the number of men and
women students at the college.
The administration spent $35,-
000 Ior the reception center and
was willingrto enclose the North
Campus ioggia. so they should
"at least be willing to tear down
a few walls." stated Mari].
“They should be alternating at
any expense."

Although Mari! lives oil—cam-
pus, he ieels both he and the
organization he heads can be
more effective this year than
in past years.

er the Grinnell Field Hockey
team.

Despite the skirts and long
hair, all their quaint and quiet
mannerisms were left in the
dressing room last year as they
mauled every opponent while
compiling an undeieated record.

This year's squad is encap-
tained by inner Mimi Euntz and
fullback Marcia David. Most of
last year's team has returned
and look better than ever.

Any girls interested in play
ing can still join the teal-ti by
contacting either captain or
showing up at practice (Tue:-
days and Thursdays at 4:15).

The first game is against lowa
State on September 21. Also
watch out for the date of the
“soccey” game ieaturing the
soccer club against the girls.

Cross-Country View
Looks Attractive

The 1968 Pioneer cross-coun-
try team, under the direction
of coach Ray Obetmiller, is
looking forward to a winning
season in the Midwest Canter-
ence.

The team has largely im-
p r o v e d, although graduation
took Doug Dray, number one
runner last year, and Bob
Grant, the second runner. This
year’s team will sport a youth-
ful look with the top five run-
ners including two juniors and
three sophomores.

The top returning Veterans
are Bob Asbilie, number two
runner; Bruce ”Luecke”, a sen-
ior; and John Siekert, the num-
ber live runner.

New races on the varsity in-
clude Eric John, number one
runner on the team, who took
sixth in the Telegraphic meet
last (all. John Russell, another
sophomore on the team, is run-
ning third tor the varsity at
the present time. Tim Power,
the other sophomore, holds
down the fourth running posi-
tion.

The first meet for the varsity
was held at Coo College, in
Cedar Rapids, on Saturday,
Sept, 14, Unfortunately, the
opening meet was a one point
loss to the Gas Kohawks.

The Pioneers’ top five run-
ners captured third through
sixth, and ninth places.

Eric John was the top run-
ner for the Pioneers with a
time or 17 minutes and 40 secs
onds,

Tho lreshman cmss~country
team looks extremely promis~
ing. This promise is exemplitied
by the fact that Chuck MC-
Grath, oi Bellewoﬂd. Illinois, is
the best runner on either the
varsity or the frosh squad.
Other fine prospects on the
team are Phil Mocales, 0i Mil.-
waukee, Wisconsin; Oscar Rat-
tenborg, of Chicago, and Mike
Daley, 0! Aurora, Illinois,

In September again, as
shown by our typical autumnal
deluges (Camelot this is not),
and we are again immersed
(what a clever verb choice) in
the pleasures and rigors of
l. M. football. The game is the
some and the people are the
same and yet, somehow, the
thrill is just not there. Dibble
no longer hates Smith and, aft-
or titty yearn oi tradition, who
can work up a good antagonism
against Haines Hall? Nonethe-
less, the show must go on, on
September 16th, the teams
marched (swam?) out to the
football wars.

The balance that has been
characteristic oi the other
years is somewhat lacking this
year as a result of the fact that
the 0ii»Campus team is made
up entirely at seniors while
most or the other North Ca'm-
pus halls have about ten seniors
in the entire hall. Loose has al-
most one hundred meu, more
than double most oi the other
halls, and yet the system
creaks on with no structural
changes.

As for my customary pre<
season picks (which have been
correct tor the last two years),
I feel I can say, without iear

vVWW

oi contradiction, that the Oil-
Campus team will go undeleata
ed. The Dkies (clever?) heat
Dibble 12-7 in a game which
can only be described as ludi-
owns and they should have
clear soiling from here on in.
Dibble should finish second and
from there on out your guess in
as good as mine.

The college bowling league,
which started today, provides
an excellent way to have iun,
not study, meet people and tul-
iiil a P, E. major or minor.
