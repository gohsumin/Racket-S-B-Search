SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Monmouth, To Host Midwest Trad! Meet

The Midwest Conference track
and rield championships will
be decided today and tomorrow
at Monmouth, with host school
Monmouth and defending Cham-
pion St. Olaf favored to win

individual champions, wliol
will be back to defend .their
titles, include St. Olaf’s Dave
Wee in the two mile, Jerry
Larson in the low hurdles and
Ken Hokeness in the shot and
discus.

Pioneer Ernie Rutherford and
Carleton’s Jim Cheshro, who
tied for first in the pole vault
last year, will resume their
dual in that event, and Mon-
month’s Glenn Brooks will de-
fend his broad jump title.

Grinnell has beaten both
Monmouth and St. Olaf in
dual meets this season, but
in both meets the Pioneers
depended heavily on field
event strength. Both the Scots
and the Oles should bring
better balanced teams into
the Conference competition.

Along with Grinnell, Cornell
and Carleton also have good
point potential and should hat—

 

tle it out for third place, Con,
nell placed second behind the
university of Chicago in the

Conference indoor meet and is 53001“; place, but foul" Ql‘inllelli
capable of twitter efforts than runs m the seventh inning andi

they have recently shown.

Carleton will chiefly rely
on pole vaulter Chssbro and,
miler Chuck Jennings, but the
Carls will also pick up enough
other points to be a third placei
threat.

Grinnell should place Carle-
ton Peterson in the high hur-
tiles and John Edgren and pos—

i
l
sibly Peterson in the low hur—l

dles. Rutherford and Gene
Kowert should get points in
the pole vault and Rutherford
again in the javelin.

A combination of Kowert,
Dennis Asby and John Har—
tung should get a couple
of places in both the shot
and the discus. Kent Roger-
son in the high jump and Bob
Earl-ill in the broad jump

should also place. l

The mile relay team ought to
do well, and another point pos<
Sibllity is Hartung in the 440.
if Jim Fisher, Fred ‘Arnold,
Jim Cross or Chris King can
place in the 440 or half mile,
the Pioneers may be able to
present a Challenge to St. Olaf
and Monmouth since entering
the Conference in 1939, the

Pioneers have won the meet
twice, in 1043 and in 1956.

Knox, Belolt and Lawrence
didn‘t appear to be threats for
the top five places, but Beloit’s
mile relay team and quarter
miler rlodine should win their
respective events. Ripon and
Coe appear to have little chance
of getting more than a couple
of points in the meet.
