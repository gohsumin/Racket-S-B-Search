Love's Labor Soon

The theme oil Shake-
speare's Love’s La ’5 Lost
“is Cupid’s revenge. nd it is
composed in movements al-
most like an elaborate bal-
let. It abounds in inexpli-
cable lines, allusions, topi-
calities, jokes and personali-
ties that bewilder even the
must erudite of commenta-
tors. But taken in the right
spirit, it is a most amusing
entertainment,” says the
critic G. E. Harrison. Tick-
ets for the October 17-19
Grinnell performances of the
comedy may be obtained
Monday to Wednesday at the
Forum desk.

“we make no apology for it;
it doesn’t mean violence, but it

College Drops
Plan to build
New Dormitory

By BENSON SMITH

A proposal to build a new
dormitory on South campus has
been shelved, according to
Dean Alice Low. Plans for the
building were approved two
years ago «by the Board of
Trustees and a studanaculty
committee, but the dormitory,
which would have housed 150
students, Will not he built.

Mrs. Low said that when she
came to Grinnell plans tor a
dormitory had already been
completed but were not ac-
ceptable to the Board pi Trus-
tees. Under her direction, new
plans were designed and sub-
sequently approved.

when. questioned about the
need for the new building, Mrs.
Low stressed overcrowding,
which she maintains still exists
this year. The dorm had been
planned on the basis of a pro-
jection of the college's future
needs. The data for the projec-
tion was collected in a room-by-
room study conducted two
years ago. Mrs. Low said that
the projection was not based on
any plan to increase enrollment
and that use of all present
dormitories would have con-
tinued. She also claimed that
with the new dormitory, more
students would be able to take
advantage of the oti»campus
living option.

Mrs. Low did not explain how
more students would have been
able to live oil-campus. Last

Hearing

Tuesday Session

Draws 2 Deans,
400 Undergrods

Last Tuesday the Judicial
Council met in the South
Lounge oi the Forum to hear
the Richard Schneirov case.
Schneirov was charged with
having a girl in his room at
8:00 pm. on September 26 in
Violation of the college's rule
on open dorms.

That the girl had been in hls
room at the time was estabe
lished by Kenneth Etzkom, res.
ident advisor of Loose Hall.
Charges were brought by Dean:
S. Eugene Thompson and Alice
Low. .

Schneirov admitted the pres‘
once of the girl, who is not I
Grinnell student, saying, “The
charges are true, but I plead
‘not guilty.’ The administrae
tion’s authority regulating co<
educan'onal use of residean
halls is illegitimate."

The defense, managed by Ml-
chael Brandon and Bonnie Tin<
ker, attempted to show the ac-
tual situation in residence halls
with respect to the enforcement
of the present visitation rule.

Five hall presidents discussed
their reiusal to comply with the
present rule and stated the in-
lorn-lal policies in their halls.
Most policies were based on
“discretion” and “considera<
lion of others.” All the house

Smith Hall Tries
Individual Floor
Visitation Policy

In recent weeks Smith Hall
has been experimenting with it
new policy of handling illegal
vlsitations. Each ﬂoor formlb
Iated its own policy, suited to
its individual needs, and desig«
nated its own hours.

Merryl Penson, president of
Smith, found that she and the
student advisers of her hall
could not enforce a college rule
which they felt to be unjust. II!
was decided that a policy
should be formed in order til
alleviate the problems brought:
about by student disregard or
the rules restricting visitationa,
and that this policy should
stress consideration [or others,

Smith is currently reconsid-
ering its policy in tho llght of
current moves by the adminis:
tration that might possibly loud
