lldminisiratidn Will Request Funds For
$2 Million Physical Education Complex

By Jean Vandervoort

Tenative plans lor a two mil.
llon dollar physical education
oomplex were submitted Wed-
nesday to the Higher Education
Facilities Commission of the
state of Iowa.

The physical education com-
plex has been granted priority
over other needed lacilities such
as classroom renovation.

The building itself will
cost about $1,600,000; equip-
ment, architect lees, land-

' costs, eto., make up the

rig expense. The plans
anticipate two large buildings,
one to house a swimming pool
and the other a gymnasium.
The two will be connected by
smaller buildings which will be
used as classrooms, offices, and

Student Wages

Campus workers are re-
ceiving long and short-term
wage increases, according
to Craig Allin, chairman oi
the now defunct Committee
on SAGA wages.

Under the provisions 0!
two amendments to the
Fair Labor Standards Act,
minimum base pay for all
campus jobs is $1.00 per
hour, retroactive to the be
ginning oi the semester.
”Skilled” workers (lBM,
science assistants, Forum
desk assistants) receive $1.25
per hour.

Minimum wages on cam-
pus will increase titteeri
cents per hour every year

the minimum wage has

locker rooms. The complex will
cover 83,463 square feel; this is
about three times as large as
Darby.

The college has applied for a
grant and a loan under Titles
of the Higher Education Act
which together would defray
75% of the cost. lowo‘s l-l. .
Commission rates the prop sol
and sends it on to the Depart
inelit oi Health, Education and
Weiiare in Washington, D. c,
with its recomltteudaiiolls. AC-
cording to John A. Pittsch (phy—
icai education), the college
was encouraged to make ap-
plication before the January
31 closing date because oi the
amount of ltlllds now available.

Plans ior physical education
lacllities have been on the col-
lege’s building agenda since
1961. President Leggett says
that the building at the library,

fine arts building and forum
pushed aside the construction of
new “RE.” iacilities. Dr. Leg<
gett said he is continuing with
building according to the 1961
priority list.

The present swimming pool
was built its a temporary stnw
ture originally. Due to deteriorar
tion or the plumbing, it is ex-
pensive to maintain. The Wo<
men’s Gym has been structural-
ly unsound lor several years.

Secondly, the swimming pool
is located where a new women's
dorm would probably be built.
To make room for the dorm.
the pool must be relocated.

One View is that other needs
may be as pressing. Renovation
of ARl-l. Can-legie, and Goodnow
was also planned during Presi-
dent Bowen's administration.
But the college is more likely to
receive lederal funds for the
”p.e." complex than ior class.
room renovation, President Leg-
gett contends, because Grinnell
compares favorably with other
schools as far as classroom
space per student while its
“p. " facilities are worse than
those of other schools.

The physical education build—
ings will be adequate for a stu-
dent body three times as large
as the present one, according
to Ptitsch. President Leggett
says Grinnell does not anticapate
a radcial enrollment increase in
the near future. The question
had been raised as to the neces-
sity of such a large and costly
sports building lot a college the
size of Grinnell.

Several simpler proposals
were considered by the archi-
tects. One involved an addition
to Darby, but this presented
several problems. Building ex-
penses would be higher due to
:l water table at this site. Fur-
thermore, this area seems to be
the favored location for central
dining facilities, A “p.e." com-
plex here would crowd out din-
ing iaciliiies,

The proposed plan seems to
be more economical than many
other alternatives. Mr. Lambie,
business manager at the col-
lege, says that the complex
should be adequate loi‘ the lile
of the buildings, which will be
on or 70 years. The suggested
structiiie is probably more prac-
Iical than a structure which
would necessitate additions in
a relatively short. time.

Piitsch iavors the plans
on the grounds that they will
provide space [or iniormal re-
creation, aild they will augment
the present course offerings.

crinnull must cope with a
long winter during which the
greater part of the “pa.” pro-
gram must take place inside.

Now, intercollegiate sports he
tivities must take precedence

over other recreational activities
during the most popular part
of the alternoon. The new build-
ing otters enough space for all
groups.

The course olierings of the
"p.e.” department are limited
because there are only four pos-
sible teaching stations on cam-
pus. The new buildings will al-

Hours Elminoliion

The Faculty Committee on
Student Alialrs will offer its
recommendation on the women’s
hours proposal this Monday,
January 30. The proposal calls
for the elimination of hours for
all women except iirst semester
ireshmen.

The Senate approved the pro-
posal last November 16. The
Faculty Committee was unable
to make the recommendation
within the 30 day limit because
of its involvement in the sus-
pension case of last December.

The committee met in closed
sessions earlier this week on
the proposal and will probably
meet with the Executive Cab-
inet before a definite statement
is released.

Dean low, AWS Board Define
Qualifications of New Advisers

By Paul Nachman

“We hope they will sup-
plement hall programs without
usnrping responsibilities from
established student government
structures,” noted AWS Board
President Karen Lauterbach a-
bout new resident advisors for
South Campus.

The resident adviser program,
slated to replace the existing
structure, was a topic of discus-
sion at the AWS Board’s Tues-
day meeting with Dean oi Wor
men Alice Low. Miss Lauterbach
indicated that few concrete
activities guidelines have been
set (or the advisors.

Dean Low and Miss Lauter-
bach agree that the new ad-
vlsors would best suit the Grin-
nell environment it they are
academically oriented. To this
end, the college is searching
among graduate schools nation-
wide {or qualllled candidate!
with masters’ degrees.

Dean Low described the role
oi the residents as twofold in
the non-academic sphere: coun-
selors on a personal level and
advisors lor social activities.
They will ease the load on the
individual hall presidents by
taking over many minor admin-
istrative duties. Dean Low
added that current responsibil~
ities sharply decrease the presi-
dents' study time, and they are
not qualified as counselors.

impending rules changes will
make the switch to resident
advisers more meaningful.

Dean Low noted. Dean Low
explained that in a nonrhours
Situation, there will be more

with their advisors.

Existing resident advisor sys«
tems on North Campus have
proved of limited effectiveness.
"This is because they were
never given any guidance or
directions for what they were
supposed to be doing in the
halls.” explained Miss Lauter-
bach. “i hope we give the
residents more clearly defined
dutiﬂ on South Campus." She
stressed, though, that some
ﬂexibility must be left in tho
system so that any difﬁculties
may be ironed out "in the
working relationships."

Miss Lauterbach emphasized
however, that their duties should
not extend into the ﬁeld of
discipline. “The enforcement
function has to be maintained
by the student govenimcnt.
The residents are not to act as
policemen." It the counselor:

Both Dean Low and Miss

sibility oi employing married
couples in the advisorships. MrSr
Low indicated that Women stu-
dents would benefit from the
availability of a man’s point ol
view. saying, “Some women re<
late better to men.”

She also admitted some dls<
advantages in bringing single
young women to Gi'innell hes
cause the environment is so
isolated.

She added, though, that “0er
hell has advantages not found
in a large university. We can
