Another Tradition

I suppose each editor tries to find a novel way of
composing his final editorial. It’s a hard thing to do,
especially thinking up new expressions for thank you.
analyzing the past year, and choosing a clinching last

line.

I guess the easiest way is first to thank everyone
who has appeared on the masthead since January 8 this
ear. These people have, for varying lengths of time,
een able to overcome the feeling that a Grinnell stu—

dent must do nothing but study.
There are other people who deserve thanks, but

I’ll send them Christmas cards.
So we can get to the second part of the traditional
farewell editorial—in this case an analysis of 1965. And
for that, I think I will simply refer you to “Grinnell

Noel XII.”

Essentially, that leaves me with very little to say
except to note that the year has been, well, interesting.
Good luck on finals, and season’s greetings.

 

leggell Speaks at Cue,- Tuilions Up;
Results of Grading Survey Revealed

“The point oi education is still
the private person," Grinnell Pres-
ident Glenn Leggett emphasized at
Coe's annual Founder's Day Can-
vocation Nov. 30,

Education in the “good old
days,” before World War II, left
almost no means for the promising
students to find themselves,” Leg-
gett explained.

"What we all need to do today
is strengthen that part of the edu-
cational program which will Show
Students that their minds, and the
proper disciplines of their minds,
are what makes them unique,” Dr.
Leggett said. “Education trains
man to be preClse, but only man
can teach himself to think effecr
tively. . . . Thus, to enable each
individual to think more ellectiver
ly modern schools have become
more specialized than the self—
contained classrooms of the ‘good
old days.’ "

“This specialization is reﬂected
by the grouping at students accord-
ing to aptitude and innerest by to-
day‘s schools. . . . Hence. modern
education has become all enter-
prise which tends to reflect tastes
ol’ all its constituents a its laclllty,
students, and Classrooms."

$2700 will be the cost oi tuition
and board for a Carletonian next
year, an increase at a hundred dol-
lars over the present cost. Cornel-
lians have also had their total Cost
raised to $2600 {or the school year
1966-1967.

A survey last year at 55 univer-
sities and liberal arts schools re
vealed that 44 use the conventional

 

letter grades, l'ive use numeral
grades, three have a different type
of letter grading system, two issue
no grades except for college use,
and one gives grades only after
graduation,

Reed college uses the conven-
tional grades, but students do not
see them until aitcr graduation.
The grades are reported to ad-
visers when students need Counsel-
ing. Bennington and Sarah Law-
rence have eliminated grades but
periodically give to the students
Carefully written evaluations which
analyze thoroughly the student‘s
progress. For a student who is ap-
plying to graduate school, how-
ever, both Bennington and Sarah
Lawrence supply the conventional
ratings. Carleton and the Univer-
sity of Rochester allow a student
to take a course outside his major
and be graded on the pass-(ail sys-
tem. The Universlty of Minnesota’s
General College experimented with
giving every student in the general
art courses an "A” at the end at
the quarter. This was to encourage
individual creativity by eliminat-
ing a grade [actor which might
make students overly cautious. The
university hopes to try this system
In other Classes as well.

The one problem the Colleges
have is the graduate school’s de-
nland for a deimite interpretation
or a student's academic standing.

(Ed. now: The Grinnell faculty
is presenlly considering pro.
posais to initiate some torrn bi a
pass-rail grading system here.
The proposals were presented at
Monday’s faculty meeting. No de
cision will be made until next
semester.)

Alumnus Won'l Supporl School;
Says Noihing Changed al Grinnell

To the Edimr:

i understand that five students
have been expelled iron. Grinnell
for having i. party in the men's
halls with women aiter hours.
When I was out there last winter
for a visit, students were being
suspended and put on conduct and
academic probation [or drinking,
being in the women's hulls after
hours, having women in their
room, etc. There’s a lot oi rule~
breaking at Grinnell and a lot or
heavy punishment. The administra-
tion was still saying, "This is
another example or Grinnellians’
inability to take responsibility to.-
their own lrvcs. When the students
demonstrate that they can handle
adult freedom in an adult and re-
sponsible manner, it will be grunt.
cd them.“ This is the same cunt
students were hearing when i inst
came to Grinncll n. 1960. Nothing
has changed, From what 1 under
stand, in fact, there is loss irccdon.
at oriuncll lhan ever beiore. Rules
are stricter in all areas, more strict
ly enforced; the administration i
less sympathetic to the studen
the oli~cnmpus houses have been
closed; a glass building has been
built, providing tor a very modern,
public place ior students to go.

Most students aren’t permitted
cars, there’s hardly any place for
them to go downtown, they are cut
off train the outside world. and any
other avenues to privacy are being
reduced. The rooms. the class.
roolns,, the corridors, and campus
are all public domain.

Where does a student live his
own life, find his own valuES free
iron. control, apply what he has
learned iron. his liberal education
to a vcallife situation, experiment,
expand himself? 1 think that what
is happening at Grinnell is very
damaging to the students. Under
the circumstances. it almost looks
as it l'ulcebreaking is virtuous, it
certainly dcnnmstrates student’s
awareness that they have more
rights thm. the administration
seems to feel thcy do. To break

 

a rule is not always n bad thing.
It depends on the rule, doesn't i\’!

 

Five years ago some students
were answering this view with:
“Then why not change the rules
through proper channels? Acting
in a criminal way is no good eith-
er." This was being said iive years
ago and I imagine it’s still being
said. The bald truth however, is
that students at crinncll College
have never been permitted free.
dom to live their owll lives, to ex-
periment. or allowed to lake re-
sponsihil v (or their actions. The
adminlsll [ion has not acted in the
host interests Di the students, but
in their own intcrcsts, which ut
many points conflict with the stu-
dents' interests. I'm not surprised
lhal students break rules, that the
Boar's Head Dinner is always a
near-riot, that the spring riot iSi
always an explosion which never
quite Collies off I’m also not sur-
prised that punishments and strict
er rules don’t ease [he sitintrion but
somehow worsen it. The student
body at Grinllell is made up ct

eople, and people usually want to

live their own lives. (There is un~
fortunately a large percentage of
students at Grinnell who actually
don't want lo be allowed freedom
and privacy and this obscures the
tact that everyone has the right to
these things alld that a person's
growth depends on thent)

When it comes down to it. rule»
breaking is a dead end, also. it
certainly doesn’t develop good
living habits. Students nre stuck.
Maybe that's why i keep running
into ex-Grinnell students here in
New York City, people who have
transferred to other schools to es-
cape m. impossible living situation.

There are many things I love
about Griunell, the proicssors, the
iriends i made lbcre, the land,
Now that rm an alumnu though,
i would never support t e college]
or recommend it. .

Yule Log Ceremony
Lacking in Dignity

To the Editor:

Last Sunday evening the women
of South Campus celebrated the
50th anniversary of the Yule Log
dinner. Three years ago, when the
present seniors were impression-
able freshmen, Dean Gardner
spoke at the Yule Log ceremony.
She related to us. among other
things, the history or the Yllle Log
and told us that we would have the
opportunity to participate in the
golden anniversary of this tradition.
Main Lounge was so quiet during
her speech you could have heard
u pin drop. We are certain that lhe
senior Women will remember the
Poise and dignity with which both
the Ceremony and the dinner were
conducted.

How exactly then was the golden
anniversary of the Yule Log celer
bratetl this year? From the quad
dining rod... Came the resounding
notes of “Best Wishes to You.”
while in Gardner Lounge, raucous
laughter and the exclamation
"Santa Claus is dead"Y reverberat-
ed Ihl'oughoul the room.

We were very disappointed bv
the periormnnce. it isn’t that we
don't have a sense of humor, as a
Friday night iag sucll conduct
would have been great. But, there
is a time and a place [or awry-
thiug, and the Yule Log dinner
was neither the time nor the place.
We would hate to admit that Grln»
nell women have become so conr
pletely wrapped up in themselves
that they can no longer exert ~e
common courtesy toward 0|l\81'.
It formal dinners do not appeal to
you, you are entitled to your mum
inn, However, we are also entitled
to ours. and we believe there are
at least a iew who really appreci-
ate the once-a-year opportunity to
Sit back und relax undenioy a
formal, dignified tradition such
ps the Yule Log. You should either
stay home, or conduct yourself .u
a manner appropriate to the sltua~

tion,
