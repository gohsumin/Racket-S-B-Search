Halt Charging Baby Elephants:

By Karen Adkinson

Ever walked'a baby wolf cub
or dug a grave? These are some
of the things Grinnell students
did in the course of their sum-
mer jobs.

Nancy Self worked in the
Children’s Zoo in St. Louis as
an attendant. Part of her job
was to exercise some of the anie
mals such as “the llamas and
wolf cubs by strolling them
around the zoo. She also pre-
pared 75 formulas a day for
baby bottles, including one for.
mula of elephant milk with
crushed bananas or tomatoes in
it.

“From my job 1 think I learn.

]ed that people are much funnier

than animals,” Nancy said. “It
usually wasn’t the kids who ask.
ed the stupidest questions, it
was their parents. For example,
a baby llama bears absolutely
no resemblance to any kind of
a rabbit, yet we had a cage with
baby rabbits and baby llamas in
it and every day you could count
on someone asking whether the
llamas were the parents oi the
rabbits. ,

“incidentally, do you know
how to stop a 350 pound charg—

ing baby elephant? i know this
sounds like an elephant joke;
but really the best way to stop
an elephant is to stick your
thumb in its mouth.”

Grinnell's grave digger was
Manly staley, who spent his
summer working at. a ceme-
tery in his home town of Can-
ton, Ill. Most of his time was
spent tending the lawns and
shrubbory rather than acting
as a. ghoul.

Pat Looney spent her summer
as a companion to one of the
Gabor sisters. She explained, “I
got the job by answering an ad
in the paper, I already had a
job as a waitress at a place'
where I had worked the sum-
mer before, and just Went to
answer the ad an impulse, when
I got to the house mentioned
in the ad and was waiting to be
interviewed, I noticed all these
photos of the Gabors. I remem-
ber thinking, ‘Gee, they must
know the Gabors.’ Was I sur-
prised when my employer turned
out to be Magda Gabol‘ GallucAl
oi.”

Pat‘s job was to be of general
assistance to Magda, who had
had a stroke and was afflicted
with aphasia, a condition in
which the language'taculties are
impaired. ,

“Imagin‘e feeling perpetuallyl
that you have a word on the
tip of your tongue, and you can
get some idea of what, aphasia
is like. For Mrs. Gallucci it was
worse since she spoke ﬁve lan»
guages tluently. Although she
has diniculty in speaking and
must train other parts of her
brain to take over the function

 

of speech, she can still under—

stand everything," Pat said.

She continued, “Because her
vocabulary was so limited, I
spent a good part of the sum-
mer playing charades or twenty
questions. Sometimes it would
take 20 minutes for me to un-
derstand what she Wanted.

“As a psych major, it was in-
teresting for me to see the re»
actions of both Mrs, Gallucci and
the family to this unusual
stress."

Jeff Burnham served as a
recreation director on the Pa-
Page Indian Reservation in
Arizona. This was one of the
ﬁrst years college students
were pemined to Work in di«
rect Contact with the Indians.
Jeﬁ explained his job, ”In the
summer there is absolutely noth-
ing for the Indian children to
do on the reservation. My job
was to plan and execute 3 rec-
reational program for all the
children of this tribe.

“This was really my ﬁrst work
with children, but by the second
week I had realized the needs
of the program Fulﬁlling them
was another in Er, for super-
vising the acti es of four or
ﬁve groups of children simulta-
neously demands the attention of
more than just one person. Al-
together, it was a very reward—
ing, but frustrating. summer,”

Other unusual jobs of Grin-
nell’s students included count.
ing cow heads, working in the
Up and Down Department of the
mit Cake Bakers of America,
being a ﬁreman on a railway,
serving as a garbage man, work-
ing as “Santa’s helper," and
blowing smoke through sewer
pipes to find leaks.
