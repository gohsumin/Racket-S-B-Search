Average Grinnetl

Student Spends

91 Hours Working and Sleeping

How does the Grinnell student
spend his time?

The average student, accord-
ing to a report issued last Fr
day by Grinnell President How-
ard R. Bowen, spends 39 hours
a week studying and conferring
with professors. He spends an
average of 5 hours a week in
class and 52 hours a week sleep-
lug.

Meals and personal care take
21 hours a week, while free time
takes a 41 hour chunk out of
the student’s week.

Dr, Bowen’s report was based
on a survey taken of a test
group of 64 students, on a sur—
vey to see where all students
were during the week, and by
his conversations with scores of
students.

"The great majority of stu—
dents study from 5 to 8 hours
a day," reported Dr. Bowen.
“And the average work week
about 54 hours,”

 

noted, is “considerably longer
than the ‘forty-haur \veek’ com-
mon in business. However, Grin.
nell students do not spend time
in commuting have relatively
few household responsibilities."

From the 41 hours a week
which were found to be “free
time” comes time for “employ-
ment, relaxation, recreation,
public events, and extracurricu—
lar actiivties."

In the week that Dr. Bowen
took his survey the average
student spent 42 hours in the
union, 2.5 attending public
events, and 2.2 participating in
sports.

“The work load of Grinnell
students appears to be heavy,
but is generally accepted." Dr.
Bowen concluded. “However,
there is a great need for careful
management of time and sched—
uling . . . Many studentscan.

-agrees with Toynbee that Com-

munism, for example, is Judaeo-
Christian heresy, but attempts to
deﬁne in great detail what the
error is that has made our age
a time of troubles.

Whereas Toynbee looks for.
ward to a world-religion, em~
bracing elements from both
Hinduism and Christianity, Voe.
gelin is a professed christian.

Born in Cologne, Germany, in
1901, Voegelin, who is a natur-
alized citizen of the United
states, received three years of
his education at, among others,
Harvard on a Rockefeller grant.
He received his Dr. Rer. Pol.

ment, American class conﬂict,
and LoFolletie's Wisconsin ide .

A public official and scholar
in Germany, Voegelin was con.
cerned with the rise of Hitler.
Clearly anti-Nazi in theory and
in practice, he concluded one of
three controversial books pub-
lished during the 1930’s on a
practical note. namely, that the
concept of race cannot serve as
the basis of any modern govern.
ment.

He was dismissed by the Nazi
government in 1938, spending his
“cxile” teaching at Harvard, Ben-
nington, the University of Ala-
bama, and ﬁnally at Louisiana
State University, where he was
Boyd professor of political sci.
ence from 1942 to 1953.

”Order in History," a philo—
sophic study, is the outgrowth
of his “The New Science of Pol-
itics," which was never pub-’
lished, but read as the Walgreen
Lectures at the University of
Chicago in 1952,

This work will comprise six
volumes, of which the ﬁrst:
three were published in 1956-57.
Voegelin says the “last three
volumes have become one large
theoretical study which will bear
the title ‘Spirit and Power.’ "

Some say that in his that three
volumes he is spelling out the
faith of the Bible: “Unless the
Lord build the house, they labor
in vain that build it."

 

The positions are salaried.

Boston Views SGA'S Year;

McCarran Act

by itichard 0hleineycr
5&3 Staff Writer

Hours tonight will be 1:00 am.
This word came from Donna
Jo Briley, Associated Women
students Board President when
she reported to the senate Wed-
nesday.

In his final report to the Sen-
ate, Ai Boston. Student Govern»
ment Association president,

the government of committees
that we had this year. In men-
tioning several committees he
remarked that the information
and programming services of the
National 5 t u d e n t Association
committee had improved since
last year. He felt that there was
still more room for expansion
of NSA programming. Boston
suggested that the foreign stu—
dent program should be examin-
ed by the senate. He expressed
doubt as to whether two more
foreign students would improve
our program in proportion to
the amount of money spent on
them. As an alternative use of
funds be mentioned a campus
charity chest. While on the sub-
ject of money, Boston said that
in his opinion too much of the
SGA budget was spent for so»
cial purposes. Out of a $45,168
total, social activities received a
$35,178 budget last year.
Boston addressed himself to
the new sGA personnel when
he emphasized that to insist
that we win not obey the

will not enforce them will get
student government nowhere.
Finally he admonished the
senators to bring more mes
to the student senate them-
selves and not wait for isms
to he brought up by the ex-
ecutive cabinet.

Steve Howell, President of the
Council of House Presidents,
Confined his remarks to three
areas. On men’s hall constitu-
tions, he reported that some sec-
tions of the ten constitutions re»
ceived Were not constitutional
under the SGA Constitution and
should be reveiwed. 0n the
drinking rule, he called for a
constant enforcement procedure
that would not vary from hall to
hell. On new student orienta-
tion, he stated that most of the
halls had good programs but an
unsuccessful approach.

The sum of 333090 was ap-
propriated to send two dele-
gates to the Massachusetts Insti—
tute of Technology conference.
All but $l40 of this sum will be
returned by the conference
sponsors.

The McCarran act resolution
favoring repeal of the Internal
Security Act of 1950 was passed
23 to 6 with 4 abstaining.
