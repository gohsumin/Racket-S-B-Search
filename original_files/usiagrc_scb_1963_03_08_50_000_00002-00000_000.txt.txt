to the editor At this point I am
somewhat confused, and i think
it is time for some defining ol

Furthermore I should like
to point out that the fashion
expert who was here with the

Style Clinic found that the

girls on this campus were
very well groomed, except ior

a certain minority, whose

rights we, as members of a

would like to suggest that Mr

the Action, Belief Equal?

By Peter L. Klein

Docs justice ask any man to tester his own
sores? Does equality ask any people to foster-
their own enemiesl Does freedom ask any goveriv
merit to protect its own assassins"

Jus ce, equality and freedom when applied
to societies 01‘ nations are not abstract ideals. It
is a misconception or these terms to believe that
a just state or a free society can maintain equal-
iiy for all. Justice is before the law, equality.
within the law. Those violating the law do not
face the same equality, as those obeying i

A government based on law acts within its
matrix of justice, equality. and freedom when it
punishes those who violate its rules; but this
matrix also fixes the maximum restrictions the
a government can place on the rights of its title
zens.

IS THE DICCARRAN ACT consistent with our
basic rights? Our government is justified in
punishing anyone who violently tries to oven
throw our government But. is advocating the
over-throw of a government equivalent to at-
tempting to over-throw a government?

If advocating is a crime. is it also a crime to
admit belief in the same principles" Does our-
government object to the results or the Coin-
mun t movement, or is it just their methods
if it is only their methods, could the satire re-
sults be achieved by gradual. legal methods”

These questions can not be completely ans-
wered in this article or in this wholo series of
articles; but before we too rashlv judge the Me-
Cari-an Act, we must examine them more close
1y. First, several terms used in the act must bc
defined:

“The term ‘zldvocates' includes advis recom-
mends, furthers by overt act. and adm - belief
in; and their giving. loaning, or promising of
support or r . _ anything or value , . . "

“The giving, loaning. or promising-of support
or . any other i ing oi value for any pur-

pose to airy organization shall be conclusively
presumed to constitute aililiatioii therewith;
. " tboth definitions are front HR. 9490 See.

Since the term “advocates" incluclcs both
“fulthels by overt act" and "admits beliel ii 'l
it is eudent that the Mac an Act finds 'aclc
ing." "amocatlng," and "admitting belief in",
eqiivalent tei-ms. Thus. if advocating is a crillle,l
then to admit belief in the same principles is}
also a crime.

From both of the above definitions we caul
also see that advocating conclusively constitutes
affiliation with an organization. Mere membership
in a Communist organization. however, is not 2.
crime; active participation is necessary. But
since “advocates" includes “furthers by ovel‘ll
act” it is an active participation; lherct‘ore. adv
eating is a crime. since advocating is a crime. it‘
follows logically that admitting belief in tlit,
same principles is also -.i crime —

The McCarran Act finds two major objections
to the Communist inovcment‘ tll that it uses
espionage sabotage .and tellorism to accomplish
its objective“. and (2) that its primary purposei
is to establ h a totalitarian dictatorship in the
United States.

Tim AFOREMENTIONED definitions clearly
show that airyone merely admitting a belief iiii
the Communists obiectrves is committing- a ci- ne‘
Thus, it anyone tried to accomplish the Com
munist‘s objectives by purely legal methods, they
still would be committing a crime. l

When our government made “acting," "ddvo-l
eating," and “admitting belief in“ equivalent
terms, they entered the thought control business ,
No longer are they exercising their legal rights;
but they have transgressed the rights of their
citizens. Freedom does not ask any Eovernmenfl
to protect its own assassins; but it does demand
that a government does protect those merely v ' el
ing a difference of opinion. '

the alternative
lstrategies of “counterforce,” and
“finite deterrence.” The latter
holds that a force capable of
inflicting unacceptable damage

“counterforce” strategy, on the
other band, would act for the

ATTE ers at limiting any

hindered by two factors- struc—
tural inertia in the Pentagon

reluctance to deny any defense
