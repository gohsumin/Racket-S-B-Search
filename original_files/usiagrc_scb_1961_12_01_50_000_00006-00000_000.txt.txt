sophomores and two fine sen—
ior guards, form the basis or a
creditable squad.

Bob Musser and Ray Horton.
senior forwards, are co-caplalns.
Musser has been Grinnell‘s lead—
ing scorer the past two seasons,
and Horton's rebounding and
steadying influence were an ime
port-ant iaetor in last year's suc~
eess.

Guards Bill Parsons, George
Gray and Ron Sandler are the
other senior representatives. Par-
sons, a letterman two years ago,
spent last season in Poland

Gray, n transier student, will

be seeing his first action as a
Pioneer and is being counted
on as one of the tnam’s lead
ing scorers, Sandier was with
the squad brieiiy last year and
is slated to see more duty this
time around.

Junior players include letters
men Denny Asby. Gar Smith, and
Kent Bagel-son, in addition to

Bob Shepherd and Bob Branison.
Smith, a regular last year, is a
play—making guard.

Big men Rogerson and Asby
will do a large portion of the
board work. Shepherd, a 196!)
transfer student, and newcomer
Bramson will provide additional
backeourt help.

Sophomores Jim Mifilln, John
Sundell, Marty Jacobson and
Jack Griffin round out the team.
Sundeil, at 6’7" the tallest man,
will play a lot at center. leflin,
possessor of a fine jump shot, will1
be in the running for a starting
berth at forward. Griffin givesi
valuable depth at iorward, while
Jacobson's flashy guard play will
get him some action,

Coach John Ptitsch has an
air of cautious optimism about
the team’s chances, In the pre- l,
season poll taken oi the Midr l
west Conference coaches, Grin- 3‘
hell was not rated among the
first five teams. Piitsch feels
this could be a blessing in dis.
