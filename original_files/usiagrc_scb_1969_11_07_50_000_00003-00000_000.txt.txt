tember as a sophomore. She

Rabbi Explains "Contextual Religion“

By Kay Carlson

“Earth is the cannibal
mother.” said Rabbi Richard
L. Rubenstein. 1969 Gates lec-
turerr "She gives us forth and
then she gobbles us back
again.”

Beginning last Sunday ever
ning and continuing through
noon Tuesday, Rabbi Ruben-
stein explained his philosophy
of “contextual religion" in
three lectures entitled “Re-
ligion after the Death of God."

position, (“Right," Rubenstein
believes, “is what is appros
priate for one’s own needs and
the society one lives in”) he
holds that “man must live
within his own skin,” rather
than constantly striving for
what he ought to be, as tra-
ditional religion would have
him.

“Such ‘now’ oriented people
in America needn’t pay for this
belief with their lives, but only
remain in college,” Ruben-
stein suggested in a South
Lounge rap session following
the first lecture.

Hailing from the University
of Pittsburgh, the 45-year-old
Rubenstein received his M.A.
at the Jewish Theological
Seminary and his doctorate in
the psychology of religion at
Harvard. He has also had two
books published, “After Aush—
witz" and “The Religious Im-
agination."

McCiirty’s only comments on
seeing the house were, “That’s
very nice; they left the lights
on.”

The next morning, Miss Tep-
ier awoke to iind a message
instructing her to call the
McCurry’s. When she did, Gene
McCurry, the owner, informed
her that her “hours had been
terminated“ and she could pick
up her pay in cash. When she
asked for a reason, he said,
‘it’s your environment, the way
you live."

Two ‘89 Grinnell graduates,
Krystyna Neuman and Jim
Rudolph, accompanied Miss
Tepier to the cafe. McCurry
saitl he had already sent the
check in the mail, so he and
his eXremployee went back to
the kitchen to discuss the mat-
ter. At this time. Miss Neuman
tried to take a picture of them
from the front oi the cafe.
McCurry moved out of the
camera’s View, and came
towards Miss Neuman with
what she described as a “really
vicious look on his face." He
tried to talte the camera irom
her. Another employee came to
help him, but Miss Neuman
wouldn’t let go. They finally
managed to force her outside;
Miss Neuman said she noticed
her hand was bleeding when the
scuttle was over. Rudolph had
also been bodily removed item
the building.

Chiei of Police Bill Peters ar-
rived, aiid McCurry wrote the
check to Miss Tepier. He told
her that she would never be
a waitress, and that she only
came to make troubler Miss
Tepfer later noted that Mrs.
McCurry had complimented

her the previous evening on
how well she was doing, con»
sldering she was inexperi-
enced.

That night, Miss repier
ieceived about ten threatening
phone calls, some saying that
the next person stepping out of
the house would get his head
blown off. There was also a
call supposedly irom Mayor
Floyd Beaver, telling her to
come to the police station imr
medialely. She did so, but no
one was there to meet her. The
police also came to the Gallery
because of the threats, but
found no one on the grounds.
Miss Tepier thougnt all the
calls were made by one man,
and said he mispronounced her
name in the same way McCurry
did.

On Wednesday, Miss Neuman
tiled assault and battery
charges against McCurry and
his employee, Opel Swatosh.
Rudolph filed the same charges
against Opel Swatosh.

On Oct. 31, Miss Tepier went
to Des Moines to file a com
plaint with the Iowa Civil
Rights Commission, charging
discrimination on the basis of
Creed. This week an investi»
gator {rpm the Commission
came to Grinneil to talk to
McCurry and Miss Tepler
separately. Miss Tepfer expects
the case to go on for about
a year, after which she may
get her job or some money
back.

in Commenting on the inci-
dent, Miss Tepier said, “One
thing I've learned is that people
in town tolerate freaks if they
are taking money from you, but
it it's the other way, they’re
not so open-minded. It's one
thing to be a student here, but
it’s a whole other thing to live
in Grinnell as a non-student
The townspeople are really
scared of you." she also said
she assumes she can't get
another job in town because of
the McCurry firing and subse-
quent publicity.

Miss Tepfer said she is press-
ing Charges for two reasons.
First, she said, “townpeople
deny there is discrimination
against freaks," and she con
tends her case proves them
wrong. Also, she wants to show
that “freaks" should have the
same rights as anyone else, and
townspeople should recognize
