Senate Revamp Defeated

By ALAN AXELROD

The Senate lives on.

The proposal made by SGA
President Jerry Goddard which
sought to abolish the senate was
defeated Wednesday night 17-5.

Senator Dan Bucks opened dis
oussion of the proposal With an
explanation or his stand on the
proposal, “My opposition is not
based on romantic wishiulness for
the past. I feel that the goals of
the proposal such as improved
rule enforcement and increased
efficiency can he achieved in other
ways.

Bucks went on to express the
feeling that the proposed form
oi government would narrow the
range of participation in student
government by delegating all leg-
islative responsibility to the hall
presidents. He said that some of

the projects oi the Senate, such
as the committee investigating
admisslon‘s practices and the
distribution of course evaluation
forms. had been worthwhile and
that the senate has the ability to
function as an efiective legisla-
tive body.

At this point Bucks distributed
mimeographed copies of suggest-
ed changes in the organization of
SGA His suggestions entailed
three proposals: the return to a

senate composed of two represen-
tatives from each hall, the selec-
tion of the speaker of the senate
by the SGA president with approv-

Student Group Forms
7' Seek Bole (dodges

About thirty students — most or them freshmen —- met last night in
the South Lounge in the most recent of a series of “organizational" meet-
ings. The group is organizing what they call the “Grinnell Committee for
Student Involvement” and are interested primarily in rule changes at
Grinnell.

A steering committee met shortly before the main meeting and ape
pointed officers. The officers are: David Levine, chairman; Carl Bef-
liner, vice chairman; Kit Leder, secretary; and Richard Kaiser, treas-
urer, Chairman Levine explained that “we couldn’t decide who should
be voting members” and said that in a month or so there would be an
election by the entire group for officers,

Levine read the group's guidelines, calling the group “an organiza-
tion seeking to promote the active involvement of Grinnell students in
the important issues and decisions which aitect them."

The guidelines went on to say that “Grinnell students have the right
to maximum intellectual and social freedom and that this is nece ary
for the iull development of independence, maturity, and respons y.”

In order to reach these ends, Levine indicated that the organization
would work through committees, The committees named were “public
affairs, student government, social lules and action, faculty and admin-
istration, academic and coordinating,"

Levtne said that sometime early next week —- he wasn’t sure when‘
or where — the group would have a general meeting open to everyone.
When asked if the group was to have a limited membership he replied
that it would be limited “to whoever wants to join."

for a mouth, were'on campns‘last
Friday and participated in it slow-
mnVing coilee hour ill South
Lounge.

A journalist formerly from Ha-
noi helpfully attempted to answer
two questions at such length, and
with such an accent, that interest
wanted.

He answered a question con-
cerning the common interest at
Russia and the United States in
the containment of Red China, by
saying that the Viet Nam war was
one of conquest and that China
would never be satisfied with half
of the country.

Speaking on other topics the
journalists could not understand
the U.S.'s lack of a full effort in
Viet Nam and they did not look
for a “strong man" to take over
there.
