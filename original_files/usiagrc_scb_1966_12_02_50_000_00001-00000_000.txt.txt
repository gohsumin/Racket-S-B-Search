Sludenl Leaders Commenl
On Goals. Plans for Future

By SUZANNE GELBER

"Progress, thus far, has been
more superficial than real," ree
marked SGA President Steve
Kent, expressing the opinions or
the SGA Executive Cabinet on
the administration reaction to
rules protest during a noon
meeting Wednesday with 5&3
reporters. Karen Lauterbach,
AWS Board president, added
that “most significant campus
reform during the past four
years — te, pass-tail, and the
reinstitution Di interim — has
come about only through Slii<
dent initiative and agitation.”

The student government of-
ficials feel that the focus of
activity is once again wom-
en’s hours, which will most
lutely not be instituted until
next tall because some people
feel counseling lacilities must
be expanded, “We believe
that the provision or more
adequate counseling services
is a legitimate concern or the
administration in this case,”
commented Karen.

“Student protest." said Bob
Foote. “did not accomplish its
basic purpose re the illcgal vie
itatioil case a to change Presi»
dent Leggett’s decision about
suspension. However, it did
open the door {or administra-
tion clarification of its rules
policy and this is at least a
limited victory." Tile student
courts are now considering the
significance of morality as a
relevant factor in judicial hears
lugs.

SGA President Steve Kent

offered the following state<
merit:

“I have a conception of
Grinnell. or, more accurately,
— oi what Grlnneil was and
wants Io be, as a tnily liberal,
radical, innovative and assert-
ive place. It’s not on original
idea but one I’ve acquired
since coming to Grlnnell and
one which i think a lot oi
Grinnellians hold.

“The decision to suspend
the three students for the rest
or the academic year and the
trepidations involved hi the
whole process that led up to
that decision, I think raise
some doubts as to the validity
of my conception The cir-

“War Without End”

By DAVID DILLON

“The historian's job is to re-
Create history. Our best schol-
ars are creative artists because
they are creating something
which is their interpretation of
what happened. . . . The use of
history and theater such as the
documentary play is becoming
more popular.” Thus Richard
Meyer, Director 0! Theater.
summarized his View of the in-
terrelatlon oi the historic and

on War Without End, by Ray-

Courts Hear Violators'
“Concern for Community"

By HAROLD FUSON

In a tense atmosphere clouded by unfriendly silences and
bitter glares, the Faculty Committee on Student Attairs and the
deans sat along with the student primary courts in hearing the

cases of 19 AWS Board and
CoiHP members who de-
liberately broke the College's
visitation rule last week.

Women's court chief magis
irate, Linda Neal, opened the
Sunday aiternoon session in
Gardner Lounge with a brief
discussion 01‘ the student courts'
approach to violations. Miss
Neal noted that evidence of a
Violation indicales “a certain
amount of Conflict within the
system.”

Leggeii Rejects
Siudenis' Appeal

By HENRY WlLHELM
Last Sunday President Glenn
Leggett rejected the final ap-
peal of Robert Hanenberg,
Michele Anderson and Frank
Knowltori to reduce the suspena
siorl penalties given them by
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent. Affairs.

Leggett said: “I lelt physi-
cal separation from the cam<
pus was the proper choice
considering all the available
alternatives.” He said that
the students would be per-
mitted to take their final
exams for this semester “in
nbsentls." They will also be
allowed to enroll as Gﬁnnell
students in another college or
university, or in any of Grin-
nell’s off-campus programs
for which they may be eli-
gible, Credits earned will be
lransferred to and accepted
by Grinnell College."
when the case was reviewed
by the Committee on Student
Affairs Leggett was out or town.
He said, however, that he had
been in touch with the deans by
phone as the case progressed,

tempt to “sit down and discuss
the problem" and within the
discussion to realize a “resulth
tion of the Conflict." While this
case constituted an “expanded
court session,” the procedure
would remain the same, “Still
discussing the problem in-
volved."

AWS Board President Karen
Lauterbach opened the delensu
followed by Coil-KP President
Robert Foote.

Miss Lauterbech stressed
that at no time was the vio-
lation “the result of either
isolated or impulsive acllon
on onyone‘s part.” There
were, she continued, I “large
segment of agitated and frusa
trated studean.” The vlola<
(ion was conceived as a “rep-
resentative action by a rep
resentative group intended to
express the concern of these
students."

The violation according to
Miss Lauterbach was something
the participants “understood
the reasons for and seriously
believed in." it was an action
which was by no means taken
lightly in View of the conse«
quences for both the individual!

Miss Lauterbach stressed that
ihe violation was “not donI
merely as a protest." It was an
”action in response to some of
the questions that have been
raised." The violation repre-
sented ”mostly a question at
policy and a concern for a pro-
cess in arriving at a policy de-
cision." This was a question
