Art Colloquium
Censures Dept.

By JONATHAN STEIN

The Gllnnell art department is not as

ood as it could be. it is under-staffed.
glhkil‘fg it Impossible for nonrmajors to
take courses, and it is di icult for majors
to pursue their education. The depart-
ment lacks scope in the introductory as
well as advanced courses. In the case
of a leave of absence, there is no effort
(trade to hire a temporary replacement.

t the introductory level, the depart-
nent sometimes assigns a man quali-
led only for studio instruction to an art

istory class. As a result, the quality of
instruction is poor in the course, and he
is unable to teach a studio course for
which he is qualified. Art majors are not
‘nly limited by the courses, but also by
‘he eight credit restriction on indepen
dent study.

With’these problems in mind. the art
majors held a colloquium last week—
pnd to organize themselves and make
suggestions on how to improve the de-

artment.

r The colloquium recommended the ad-
illtion of two new staff members, one in
art; history and one ill the studio in-
junction.

They all decided to circulate a ques
tionnaire in hopes of determining how
bunny “non-majors" have been unable to
take courses and workshops. The majors
will be asked to put down in writing the
courses they feel are necessary for their
education.

The colloquim also decided to go to
Chicago on April 4—7 where they will
yisit Chicago art schools and museums,
‘the majors are also trying to make ar-
rangements for an underground film
series. The main obstacle to both the trip
and the movies is money; as the art de-
partment's budget does not provide
enough money for extracurricular acti-
vities. The money will have to come from
the students.

As a result of my article on the need
for nude models, the majors have locat-
pd a Zlayearsold, married, lion-student
lwith modeling experience. willing to
inodel for a reasonable fee. The students
gow hope to convince the department and
‘ e administration that nude models are
n necessity for serious art students.

NSA to Oppose
End of 1/2 Fare

Recently there has been a great deal
of consternation on campus concerning
the proposed abolition of standby fares.
The 5&3 contacted United Airlines and
learned that stand-by rates still exist.
The airlines also assured us that they
will extensively publicize any changes.

The National Student Association is
protecting student interests in this mat-
ter. NSA has retained legal counsel to
oppose the recommendation of a CiVil
Aeronautics Board examiner that youth
fares are “unjustly discriminatory.”
Arthur S. Present, the CAB examiner
reasons: ”Although youth fare rates are
available to everyone in the specified
age groups, this attribute does not excuse
the discrimination unless age is a prop-
er foundation for that discrimination."
no maintains that ”the rule or equality is
paramount." Lawyers representing NSA
will prepare briefs and oral arguments
for presentation before the CAB, The
NSA will support youth fares by citing
the educational, social, economic, and
cultural benefits gainedr

m

loquium's suggestions will affect the art
department. If the department is not
improved, serious majors will be unwill.

will not be interested in coming.

Liberals Organize

An organizational meeting for a new
liberal Democratic pressure group in
Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Conference
(IDC) was held in Grinnell Monday. The
Poweshiek County meeting was part of
a state-wide series of organizational
meetings in preparation for a conven-
tion to he held in Ames, Iowa on March
3.

Professor Alan Jones (History), chain
man of the county meeting, and eight
others out of thirty present at the
meeting, were selected to attend the
state convention.

The IDC is foreseen as a liberal pres
sure group within the state party. whose
purpose would be “to focus attention on
issues." It's purposes are, however, still

. very vague, and they should be more

clearly defined at the state convention.

The group, currently headed by Dan
Johnston of Des Moines, has been en-
dorsed by state party leaders including
former Lieutenant Governor Robert Ful<
ton, former State Treasurer and guberna-
torial candidate Paul Franzenburg, and
former 4th district Congressman Bert.
Bandstra. The DC is conceived of as a
group which will criticize the state party.
as well as work with it, although many
state leaders are not prepared to do this.
Generally, Iowa's Democratic Party is
progressive compared with other states';
thus, IDC liberals should be able to Work
very closely with the regular party.

The meeting in Ames will be open to
everyone; anyone who is ‘interested
should see Mr. Alan Jones or Mr. Ed
Moore.

”I'd hate to have students see some of
the very silly things we do in faculty
meetings," Professor Joseph Danforth
(Chemistry) told the 5&3 last week. “We
do some things we're ashamed of our-
selves when we're flnlshed.”

Danforth was one of five members of
the faculty's Executive Council who were
contacted by the 5&3 and asked to we
plain why students are excluded from
faculty meetings and to give their re—
action to a suggestion that students be
admitted to the meetings in a non-particl-
patory capacity.

Danforth said that the faculty isn't con<
cealing “great secrets" from the Stu-
dents, but he believes that students
should not be present at most faculty
meetings. although they should have ac¥
cess to the minutes. “i would personal-
ly be influenced by some of the students
I respect ii I knew they were observing,"
Danfonh explained. “With students there
we would put on a show and wouldn't be
our ornery selves."

Chairman of the Faculty Joseph Wall
(History) told the 5&3 that the question
of student admission to tacuity meetings
has never arisen before. “The meetings
have always been closed to students and
also to all administrators, except those
with academic rank,” Wall Said. Fresh
dent Leggett, rather than the Chairman
of the Faculty presides over faculty
meetings.

Wall believes that only voting members
of the faculty should be present at the
meetings. “1 would object to any specta-
tors, because I think it would change
the free nature of the debate," be ex-
plained.

P hilllp Kintner (History) also said
he would oppose the presence of students
at faculty meetings. He said that topics
discussed at faculty meetings range “all
over the map," and include curriculum.
student referrals and various academic
matters which might be of concern to
students, “However, having students pre-
sent would reduco the viability of diS‘
cussion." Kintner said, "Many things
that are discussed have to do with the
individuals present, and some things are
said that shouldn't be thrown out in
the open."

Professor Raymond Betts (History)
thinks if students were allowed to attend

faculty meetings, "the kind of free and
frank discussion that often occurs would
be inhibited,” However. Betta believe!
that, “Students needn't be excluded un-
qualifiedly on all occasions, and in
many instances student participation
wouldn‘t be out or order." He said that
students should not be present when the
faculty discusses certain “discreet" sub
jects. Asked to explain what he meant
by “discreet," Betts begged the question.

Professor Waldo Walker (Biology)
said that the faculty “discusses some
things that are personal problems that
don’t concern the students." He termed
the faculty’s closed-door policy towards
students as "sort of a tradition." Asked
if he would oppose admitting students to
faculty meetings, Walker replied, “i
guess it wouldn't hurt anything, but it
would limit faculty participation to some
degree." Asked Li a students stake in his
education didn't warrant his being pre«
sent at faculty meetings, walker com-
mented, “Well, I think most studEntl
would be bored."
