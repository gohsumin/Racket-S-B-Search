Scarlet Fever

By Lou Czrloduey

3&1} Sports Editor

About two or three years ago wre ﬁling might have

been considered thc forgotten sport at Girnrlell. From 1949-

3 the Plonecrs lrelded teams that captured second place

fill the Conference on three occasions, but ali‘ter that for-
,ltunes on the mat \vaincd.

‘ When Edd Bowers tool: over as head football coach in

1961, he also inherited the coaching; duties of the‘ wrestling

 

the lead guard, “‘85 given an honorableitcam, a sport he had not handled before. Bowers was only

‘supposed to ‘\\'rest1e’ with the team for one season until a
regular Wrestling couch could be found and Bowers \\0ul(l
;bc allowed to concentrate on his other two sports, football
land tennis.
The zulministration’s attitude toward wrestling w
lflcctcd in their choice of a new coach — a senior ph 1
education merior dud football standout, Terry Moore, \rho
W W had nei'el' wrestled before.
The new coach had several
major problems facing him
_ before he could begin his job.
While he cheCted the ex,
pericnced members of the
- team to help with the tench-
ing of’ the many complex
i; ’ ‘ ' V ,, moves in the sport, he had to
' L v ‘ lenrn enough to have 2\\\‘01'l(—
ing‘ knowledge of wrestling.
Secondly, ho had to learn the
exercit s and drills necessary
. to pro, 9 a team for their
schedule of matches. Thirdly,
and most difficult, he hzrd to
gain the respect of a team
, that had been his classmates
the year before, and know
that he had no experience in
wrestling
In his season, last
‘ "ear, Moores suuzld was
1 _'ued by injuries and a poor attitude in some places, and
it rrshed last iii the Conference meet. This season the pros-
pects didn’t look much brighter with no returning letter-
men and only one returnee from last year, The wrestling
prospects notes in Grirrnell’s winter sports book seemed
’like a pre-season apology for another poor season: "With
nine sophomores on this year’s team and no returning let-
ltcrmen, this will be a rebuilding year for Coach Terry
‘Moure and his wrestlers . . .”
] Using some new ideas in cmrclringéh’lool'e ‘built his
group of sophomores and juniors into a team that the Ben
loit wrestling coach casually termed the surprise of the Con-
ference tournament. I belicre that if some kind of unoffi-
.cial poll were taken, we would [ind this Coach joining eight
lother Midwest Conference helmsmen and the Grinnell wres—
ltling‘ team in giving Terry Moore their vote as l’Iat Coach
of the Year.

Unfortunate] Moore‘s tentatir‘e‘plans after completing;
his masters tleD e in August lean toward going into the
iI’cace Corps, and not returning for another year as coach.
With the prospect of the best wrestling team in Grinncll
history‘next year, I only hope that the administration will
not forget the team, and ‘11 get a coach who will do as
‘conscientious a job as ”Big F" has done in the past two
,vcars.
