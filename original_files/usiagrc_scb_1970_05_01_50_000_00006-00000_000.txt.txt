lee Saturday tilternoon, Dean
Kimbo met with groups of
black students and they dis-
cussed alternative proposals.

Tile plan was the major topic
of discussion at o CBS meeting
Sunday night at the Black Cut
titrat llousc, a meeting which
lasted almost seven hours. It
was at this meeting that CBS
tlccrded on the plan as it now
stands,

Dean Kimbo, who was at
that meeting, said that a num-
ber of alternatives was dis-
cussed, including simply in
creasing the current cluster
arrangements, but that the pro-
posal which was eventually de-
cided on — the Younker pro-
posal —— seemed to best meet
the goal of helping freshmen
black students adjust academa
icaily and socially to the col»
lege.

Preslclent Leggett made the
decision to accept this proposal
Monday hecause he ten it was
the best of the alternatives.
Dcan Kimbo met with the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee Mon-
day atternoon and intormed
them of the decision.

Those who were involved in
formulating it hope that the
Younkers Plan will deal effec-
lively with what President Leg-
gett called “the Very special
problems in social and academr
IC orientation" on the part or
black students. According to
Dean Kimbo, it is :l cultural
shock for black students who
have grown up in an all black
community to come into an all
white community and college
and be able to function as
students immediately, and the
Younker Plan will be important
in helping incoming black fresh-
men ”make lt” in their first
semester.

Dean Kimbo Said that much
thought went into the proposal
on the part of all those in-
volved in making it, especially
the Concerned Black Students.
”it is not a capricious type
or proposal," he said.

Presulent chgett feels that
the plan is in line with the pol-
icy the Trustees decided on
alter their special meeting
with black students in May or
last year in Chicago. Thc open-
ing sentence of the policy
statement that came out of that
meeting reads, “Grinncll Cole
ng0 is trying to fashion its
emotional and operational a".
vironmcnt so that it is in fact
a multi-racial society of stu-
dents and taeulty acting togethr
or in understanding and mutual
Dlll'pDSE.”

The exact number oi incom-

yet known, although Dean
Kimbo predicted that there will
be approximately the same
number as last year. if that is
true, almost one half of the
hlrtck freshmen will be in
Younker Hall if they choose
to accept the opportunity to
live there.

That right?

Solon lets him in on the Prizes,

“Then, Solon, you amazing
person, when you said magnifi-
cent prizes to tell of, you spoke
of apples and parsley and a
sprlg of wild olive and a bit oi
pine?” He then goes on to point
otit that even a youth could
procure such things at most
stores and market places at
considerably less trouble and
risk.

Solon is appropriately out-
raged at this and, losing ilot a
lnoment, seized the opportunlty
to Grate Movingly Upon the
Subject.

Athletics, he says, is only in
cidental to civic virtue (the only
game in town at that point),
and is useless without the cul~
tivatlon oi the soul. This latter
IS accomplished by tirst ”enr
flaming the soul with Arithme-
tic,” followed by a diet of
“healthy flctinns" and cock-
tights.

such a training, along with the
spectacle of virtue offered in
cockiights and the comedies oi
Aristophanes, would enable
Athens to beat all and sundry
who may hear her evil inten-
tions. The object of this gym-
nasium, in short, is to provide
the polls with a fierce and har»
dened army,

Two conclusions spring imme-
diately to mind:

(1) Sports had no intrinsic
value, even to Solon, Their
main justitieation is utility and
their principal utility is force.

(2) Solon had not heard oi
Black soup,

So i should like to question,
given the legitimacy and eter-
nal relevance of the Greek to
all and sundry of our preoccu-
palions, Much Less, just to
what extent sports is inhibitive
oi violence. Solon, in tact,

Friday. Mag l, l'?70

points out the critical Truism
of this dispute, that the capac-
lty ior Violence and iorce is
increased, rather than dimin»
ished by exercise.

Tile case of Aquinas is still
more distressing, The mother
of a friend of mine, a fine lady
who had attended a Convent
school for about as long as
such things can be endured,
put her finger right on the
problem.

“i suppose that his philosr
ophy is all right." she sighed,
"but he was just so fat.”

Now the difficulty seems here
to devolve around some am-
biguities in the translation of
Thomas' dictum (Summa con-
tra Nihilisticos XCX, cXC, etc.).
i believe that it our corres-
pondent would return to the
text of this remark he would
find the more appropriate
translation to be ”War is the
moral equivalent of Sports.”

Now the fact of the matter is
that, so far as any scholars
can ascertain, St. Thomas had
only one encounter with a Sport
or any sort whatever. As Ches-
Lerton tells it: . . . when his
brothers introduced into his
room a particularly gorgeous
and painted courtesan, with the
idea of involving him in a
scandal . . . he was very ani-
mated indeed. He sprang from
his seat and snatched a ﬂam-
ing brand from the Fire, and
stood brandishing it like a flam-
ing sword. (Get it?) The wom-
an . . . shrieked and fled. (The
Dumb 0x)

I suppose that my final word
on the subject would be in con-
cert with st. Thomas’ late.
great commentator, St. Neot
the Navigator. in Neot's private
copy of the Summa contra Ni<
hilisticos, is found penciled in
