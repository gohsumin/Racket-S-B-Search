.To Assume Vanderbilt Position

Dr. Winston L. King, Rand
professor of Applied Christian-
ity, is resigning from the Grin-
nell faculty to take a new po~
Eition this fall at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Ten-
hessee.

At Vanderbilt he will be
ﬁrefessor of the history of re-

member of the Divinity School
faculty but will be teaching in
the university itself at both the
undergraduate and graduate
levels.

Joining the Grinnell faculty
in 1949, Dr. King was dean of
the chapel until 1963 when he
relinquished his chapel duties
in order to devote more time to
teaching and Writing. During
the current year he holds the

completing his two year elective
term as faculty chairman.

books and has written numerr

been based on his experiences
and observations during a two
year leave of absence, from

958 until 1950. During that
time he was a visiting profes-
sor and adviser to the Ford
Foundation at the International

 

Institute for Advanced Buddhis-

for four months at Ahmednager
College in India.

vard. During World War II he

Hoffmann Views ﬁfth Republic:—
Its Political System Am! Society

By Susan Taylor

There are two sides to the
post-war problems of France,
according to Professor Stanley
Hoffmann, Rosenfield Lecturer,
These are the continuing

troubled history of French poli-
tics, caused by the presence of
so many political parties, and
th e transformation of the
French society in the period fol»
lowing 1945.

Speaking on ”France Under
the Fifth Republic,” Hoffmann,
professor of government at
Harvard University, Wednesday
night analyzed the problem and
discussed the background. the
quest for political stability un-
der De Gaulle, and the pros»
pects for the future.

“In spite of the hopes of re-
juvenation and regeneration
which followed world War ii,
the French were not able to
solve the basic problems of the
instability of the political sys
tem,” he said,

The society was divided on
fundamental issues, I-loifmann
explained. These included ewv
nomic and social divisions
which were not necessarily re-
lated to the equally prevalent
divisions on an ideological ba-
sis and a "division of the tem—
per itself.”

Hoffmann explained that folr
lowing the war, under the gov-
ernment of the Fourth Repub-
lic, a new role of the state
emerged. “The state was for
the first time able to play an
important role in French so-
ciety and Fiench economy."

He explained that the impact
of the transformation of the so»
ciety under the Fourth Repubr
lic had no effect on the politi-
cal system. T h e economic
changes only contributed to the
weakening of the historically
messy political system.

Under General De Gaulle,
who took over the government
in May, 1958, Hoffmann said
that the social and economic
transformation Continued and
accelerated. But, he said, under
De Gaulle's fifth Republic the
changing society has benefitted
from political stability.

According to Hoffmann, De
Gaulle believes that the French
state must be preserved at all
costs against the accidents of
history; that the state must be

constructed “as the common
framework and the guiding
force of the nation”; and that
the state must be a republic.
Under the di sions in the
French society, there is a “la-
tent general will,” and only the
executive can awaken this will.
Parliament cannot, because of
the many divisions it has within
itself. De Gaulle, according to
Hoffmam‘l, realizes that the di-
visions on the surface of the so-
ciety are realities reflected only
too accurately by the parlia-
ment — which leads to “a per-
fect recipe for deadlock," ac—
cording to Hoffmann.

“De Gaulle has become the
dominant element in the sys-
tem,” Hoffmann Said. He has
imposed a strong executive over
the parliamentary republic. In
his constitutional reforms of
1962, he further strengthened
his position by having the pres-
ident elected by universal sub
frage.

But, Hoffmann explained, the
stability imposed by consoli-
dating the dominancy of the
presldency, and by attempting
to force the parties out of their

 

grooves to fight for the election
of the President instead of par.
liamentary seats, is brought “'1‘
to question by me problem of
succession. What will happen
when France no longer has De
Gaulle, Hoffmann said, is the
question most Americans ask.

In asserting the prospects.
Hoffmann pointed out: the lim
fations of the present constiiu.
tional system. “The bottle neck
lies with the parties,” he said,
He also pointed out the tension
between the old parties, and the
new forces, essentially non-p0.
iitical pressure groups and
“think groups” which are play.
ing an active role in the eco.
nomic and social machinery of
the government.

"De Gaulle hopes to reshape
the relation between society
and power,” and to reshape the

parties, Hoffmann asserted. He
must reshape the political sys-
tem such that it will outlast
him. But, Hoffmann said,
“There remain a number of
question marks." At present he
saw no answer as to what the
future of the Fifth Republic
would be.
