pension of college activities on

Kleinschmldt also asserted
that “there is a possibility that
by successive endorsement of
suspension or elimination of our
activities we will not be serving
the purposes of the Moratorium
Committee or our own pur<
poses, but will rather be serv-
ing the purpose of another group
of people who would use the bas-
tion of this institution and
similar American institutions
as a base from which to destroy
those institutions."

"That sounds like Agnew’s
argument that protest en-
courages Hanoi," responded In-
structor Alan G. Nasser
(Philosophy). “It may be true,
but it doesn’t matter. That
argument is as weighty, no
more, no less, than Agnew's."

Associate Prof. Edward E.
Foster (English) expressed
agreement with Kleinschmidt.

"We would not want to use the
educational process as a lever
to eiiect political change, part-

icularly change that would desA
trcy that process," Foster said.

Associate Prol. Donald R,
Liggett (Education) suggested
that the college dismiss classes
one day each month ”to give
publicity and demonstrate how
strongly we feel" about ending
the War.

“I think this is an issue on
which we as a faculty should
take a political position,” Ligr
gett said.

“I think the townspeople
would be more impressed ii
students went out (to work
against the War) during their
leisure time." responded
Associate Prof. Karl DeLong
(Biology).

Asst. Prolr Neal A. Milner
(Political Science) and {he
structor Gregory Guroll
(History) argued that faculty
members already have the
option to call classes without
penalty under the established
policy of "procedural
ﬂexibility."

Worley, however, said that
the special motion regarding
the Moratorium was necessary
to give students an option on
class attendance.

After the motion was ap
proved, Prol. Beth Noble
(Spanish) upbraided the
taculty:

“I find it increasingly difficult
to vote with this faculty. 1 no
longer know what this college
is. I have no idea 0! what the
nature of the liberal arts col-
lege is in respect to this in-
stitution, and l donut know what
the aims and goals of this
college are. It doesn't seem to
me that the college makes any
sense any more . Is the ad-
ministration, the trustees, or
the executive council going to
come out with a statement or
what we are and where we are
going, or doesn’t anybody
care?"
