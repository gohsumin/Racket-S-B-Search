Stauss Outlines Role of Student.
Parents in Liberal Education

By Cynthia Brust

In the annual Parent’s Week—
end lecture, presented last Sat-
urday in Herrick Chapel, James
H, Stauss, Dean of the College
and acting president, explained
what the college expects of stu<
dents, parents, and alumni.

Stauss began with a brief
summary of the goals of a lib-
eral arts college. it is. he said,
created for “teaching. learning
and scholarship in the sciences
and arts,” as well as for pro»
professional training. He de«
scribed the ideal graduate as
an “intelligent amateur” in the
wide range of liberal arts sub-
jects and an "intelligent “ap-
prentice” in his major field.

”We expect our students to
do work which merits the re—
spect of their professors,"
Stauss stated, He also declared
his desire to develop “hard—
boiled realism” in the Students
and their parents in two areas

A Mock Presidential Election

‘ for students and faculty will

be held next Tuesday, October

27, just one week prior to the

November 3rd national election
date.

Students will vote in the lunch
lines at Cowles and the Quad-
rangle between ll am. and 1
pm. Faculty members will vote
through the Faculty Exchange.
Paper ballots will be’used.

The Mock Election is co-
sponsored by the Student Gov-
ernment Association, the Young
Republicans and Young Deni-
ocrats, and the Program in
Practical Political Education.

Commenting on why voting
machines will not be employed
as they have been in past
events of this sort, PPPE Di-
rector C. Edwin Gilmour (Pol.
Sci.) said that the County Aud-
itor was unable to make the
machines available because
they- are presently being check-
ed and prepared for the elec-
tion, November 3rd.

which often present great emo-
tional problems. The first of
these is the “arithmetic of col—
lege competition,” the Well-
lmown fact that only one~half
the students can be in the up-
per 50% of their class.”

The second related area is
the ”emotional trap caused by
the distance between actual
possibility and unrealistic ex-
pectation,” on the part of either
the student or his parents. This
problem, according to Etauss.
is often involved in the con-
flict between dependence and
independence which plays such
a major role in a college stu~
dents emotional life. We expect
the students to look toward
their maturity,” he said. “We
want them to be hard-boiled,
realists ~ to declare their in-
dependence of unrealistic ex-
pectations and relax.” Stauss
emphasized that he was not ad—
vi'sing students to ignore the
expectations of their parents,
but rather to not create an emo-
tional issue of them.

The parents’ role in this de-
velopment was outlined in three
areas: to allow the students to
adjust to reasonable expecta-
tions—“We ask you to 'accept
the standard of the students’
own best efforts"; to allow him
to discover and affirm his own
interest; and to realize that he
owes it to himself to think for
himself.

Stauss pointed out that the
student must be left emotion-
ally free to meet the commit
merits of a liberal arts educa-
tion. These are the commit-
ments to a humane under-
standing of the world’s great
ideas and ideals, to informed
and responsible citizenship on
every level, and to sophisti-
cated entertainment for him-
self and others.

He touched briefly on the
need for improvement in the
dormitory systems on campus.
We need, he said, to develop a
student culture which will sup-
port the liberal arts concepts.
The students must develop ma—
turity and meet standards of
dignity and courtesy in their
relationships, In this area, he
pointed out that the adminis-
tration and faculty expect un-
derstanding of these aims from
the parents and alumni. He
asked in conclusion that all who
care for the college and its stu-
dents bear in mind that “rule-
making for students is not the

“Grinnell is one of about six
American cities, and the only
college city, in which filming is
being done for this tour of the
Philharmonic," said Don Jones
(music). “A documentary
film ~< for use on Polish TV
and American educational tele—
vision — will then be put to—

point of the movie.”

Jones also noted that this
marks the first time the Polish

Dil'hyramb Uses French Theme:
'Discotheque' to Be Featured

,Grinnell borrows an idea from
the French for the first dithy-
ramb of the season to be held
following the Warsaw Philhar-
monic Orchestra concert to-
morrow night in Loose Lounge.
The t h e m e Discotheque
means “records" in French. It
refers to a type of nightclub
that is found all over Europe
and is now becoming popular in
the United States, The surround-
ings are not extremely elegant.
and it is the type of place that
would be frequented by high
society. Entertainment music
is from records rather than a
band. It is one of the newest
developments in the small din»
ner club atmosphere.
Committee chairman Martha
Montgomery said “We are try-
ing to ayoid the tea and sand-

wich idea and get something
more substantial in planning
the menu.” Dithyramb is serv-
ing different sorts of cheeses,
bread, dill pickles, and punch,

The idea behind dithyramb is
an attempt to provide a maxi-
mum of sophisticated enter-
tainment to a small number of
people'after a formal event. It
usually includes a formal menu,
and some type of music, pat~
terned after night club enter-
tainment. A small admissiOn fee
is charged to control the num~
ber of people attending. Social
money is budgeted for this, but
it does not cover all of the ex-
pense.

rarnb are available in the Fine
Arts office at 50c per couple

”I think this shows that the
cultural exchange program can
get things done better than sit<
ting on our fences yelling oaths
at each other," Jones res
marked.

The Warsaw Philharmonic is
in this country as part of an
exchange in which the Pitts-
burgh Symphony went to P0-
land. Jones said, “The Pitts-
burgh orchestra was received
very hospitably in Poland; we
would like to see an equally
kind and generous treatment
for the Warsaw orchestra while
it is here.”

The orchestra‘s regular 90
members, under the direction
of Stanislaw Wisiocki, will play
Berloiz’s Roman Carnival Over-
ture and Beethoven’s Eroica
Symphony at both Grinnell con<
certs. The matinee perform-
ance will also include piano
soloist Wladyslaw Kedra play-
ing Chopin's Piano cencerto in
F Minor, while the evening con-
cert will feature violinist
Wanda Wilkomirslia in the War
lin Concert by Karlowicz.

The Philharmonic arrived in
this country for its second
North American tour on Octo'
bar 2 and began its concert
series October 4 with a per-
formance at Constitution Hall
in Washington, D.C. They have
since played in New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
and Minnesota. The orchestra’s
only other Iowa performance
will be in Waverly. Their last
performances of this tour will
be in Carnegie Hall November

64- -year history, it has retained
its reputation as one of me
world's outstanding orchestras
despite two world wars, the
second of which devastated
Warsaw and the Philharmonic

orchestra has recovered. Since
1958 it has played in Belgium
at the‘ Brussels World Fair, in
East and West Germany, Engv
land, France, Switzerland, and
the Soviet Union. The orches-
