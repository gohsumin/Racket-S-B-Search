Netmen Finish Second to Carleton
In Conference Meet at Monmouth

Grinnell‘s varsity netmen came
through in top form at the con-
ference tennis meet held last week-
end in Monmouth, Overall, the Pin-
neers scored 14 points to edge
Ripon with 13, and Lawrence with
ll. Carleton won, as expected,

with it] points

Grinnell clinched second place in
the last match of the tournament
when the Pioneers‘ second doubles
team of Mike Greenﬁeld and Ken
Clymer defeated Carleton for the
conference title. Greenfield and
nymer, playing their best tennis
of the year, beat the Carls 7.5,
(H.

The final match was played in
near perfect form by both teams.
There were only four service
breaks in the two sets, three to
Grinnell’s advantage.

Before beating Carleton. Clymer
and Greenfield had set back Be-
loit 6-4, (H. after a shaky start.
They then went on to defeat St.
Olaf 673, 6-4 in the semifinal
match. clymer and Greenfield had
been defeated last year by the
same St. Olaf team in the confer.
ence tournament.

Another highlight of the tourna—
ment was the success of Pioneer
Larry Shannon. Shannon, seeded
fourth, played in the number one
spot. Playing erratically as he has
most of the season, Shannon near-

 

ly lost his opening match to Mead

of Cornell, ﬁnally winning Z~6, 7»5,
6»).

Shannon then settled down and
played close to his potential in de-
feating Cooper of Lawrence, who
had drawn the number two seen,
276, 6-2, 6-2. Shannon met Doug An'
kerson of Ripon in the final match
at 7:30 in the evening. Ankerson
had just defeated highly touted
(and cocky) Jev Sikes of Carleton
in the most exciting match of the
day.

Ankerscn defeated Shannon 6‘1,
6-], but the Pioneers had an \meXr
pected second place at No. l sin-
gles.

Mike Greenfield at No. 2 singles,
was seeded second to Jim Keenan
of Carleton. That was the way it
finished. In his first match. Green-
field defeated his Beloit opponent
6-3, 6-2, He made short work of
his second opponent 6-4, 672 before
losing to Keenan in the final
match 53, 6-4.

Lige Hicks scored points for the’
team at No. 4 singles and also at
No. l doubles. Hicks defeated his
Monmouth opponent ea. 64) hefore
losing to Carleton in the semi-ﬁnal
round 6-2, 673.

Hicks teamed with Shannon for
the doubles contest. They nearly
lost their opening match to Cornell, .
hut finally managed to win o2,
