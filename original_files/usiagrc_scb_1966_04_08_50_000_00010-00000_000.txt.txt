Debicki Decries Intellectual Slack
As Frosh Gradual y Become Seniors

By ALAN AXELROD

“In making proposals to the Ad
Hoc Committee on Hall Reorgani-
zation the Executive Council at»
tempted to formulate something
which would be beneflcial to the
College community, not try to take
over the role of college disciplin—
arians."

In an interview Wednesday, An-
drew Dehicki (Spanish) revealed
some of the thought behind the
proposals that included freshman
dorms and l system oi North
Campus room drawings.

peblcki said he thoughhthat a
system at treshman halls would
make it easier for the freshmen
to ask questions and pursue means
lngful topics. “There was a gen-
eral consensus that students didn‘t
talk to each other enough about
extra-curricular intellectual activi-
ties." He pointed out that he
meant discussion that is not neces-
sarily about classroom work, but

 

lather topics that have provided'
enough stimulation that students
would be moved to do some ins
dependent thinking. “Sn often I
see students in my classes mere-
ly come to class, take notes, and
hand it back in a neat package
on tests, without ever asking ques-
tions. showing intellectual Curios-
ity."

Interestingly, Debicki said his
best discussions come in fresh-
man humanities classes. He re-
marked thst students seem to lose
their intellectual zeal gradually,
until when they are seniors, they
have, for the most part, lost the
spark, "Campus life is simply not
conducive to students getting to
gether and asking questions."

Debicki said he wanted to make
it clear that he does not consider
the residence hall system to be
culpable for all the flaws in the
intellectual atmosphere. He does,
however. feel that it is time for
a change, and feels, as Preslden!
Legget does, that in any system

 

 

an occasional change is needed
to add Vitality. “Any system after
a number of years is caught up
in its own mystique. The inertia
within the system perpetuates tra-
ditiun.

“It is uniortunare that energies
are being channeled into a direc-
tion that isn't worth it. The kind
of inﬂuence exerted on the fresh-
men by upperclassmen in particu-
lar halls is bad. it is my impres-
sion that the freshmen are often
made to conform to detailed and
trivial regulations and problems of
importance are neglected."

Debicki emphasized that ideas
he had about the residence hall
system often came from the stu-
dents themselves. and that in talk—
ing with students on a personal
basis he cited iinds that they are,
in ﬂat, rather disenchanted with
the present residence hall system.

Another fault he ﬁnds with
North Campus is that it is diffi-
cult to choose one's own friends.
Debicki backed this up with com-
plaints he has had from students
who say that intermingling among
the halls is discouraged.

He commented that in freshman
dorms treshmen would be more
likely to seek out their peers for
discussions, and as he pointed out,
freshmen share a common bond
called humanities and historical
studies. Whereas the proposals
called for one upperclassman to
every eight or ten ireshmen, De-
bicki said he would perhaps like
to see more upperclassmen in the

frosh dorms. He further remarked
that the success of freshmen
dorms would, to a large partpde-
pend on the upperclassmen in the
dorms.

In regard to open dorms, De-
bicki said. “The Executive Coun-
cil did not feel ready to make
recommendations about u p e n s;
the problem must be studied care
fully.” He said, however. that he
realizes there is a problem of pri-
vacy. but suggested that there
might be other ways or solving
the problem without instituting ad-
