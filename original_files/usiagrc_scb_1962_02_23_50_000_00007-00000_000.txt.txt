Last. weekend after the Pioneer cagers had finished
drubbing St. Olaf, comments such as “we just. saw the
worst teilm in the Conference” fly around Darby, And
yet this was the team picked to finish nctlr the top of the
Conference.

of course'these some experts chose Grinnell for n
cozy secondediyision l" islt. The Oles (although their big
center Ltlrry Hindermann was unable to play last. weekend) ,
htld on their sound til; the outset of the season the eleven
lettermen that cti d Inst year's team into a sccond-plnce
finish (in n tie with Carleton).

Then what‘s wrong with the Oles? It seemed apparent
during last; Saturday’s gnme that their coach, Bob Gelle.
lllld as little ft notion of what’s wrongr as we do. He justt
couldn’t Seem to find the combination he wanted, as he
operated his team on the “shuttle service” principle, throw-I
ing new men into the lineup every couple of minutes.

But in any case we wish St. Olaf well, for they (on
Saturday) filling with Cnrleton (on Friday) will lie meet-
ing Monmouth in Northfield, Minn. Both the Curls and
the Oles ride into the Weekend’s action uith 7-7 Confer-
ence marks, and While both have from time to time flash-
ed brilliantly, the Cnrls with their sticky defense and
pattern offense have the best chance to knock off the
Scots and shove the Pioneers, if they will. into clear pos~
session of first place. I

A big factor in the Nol'tllficld cage action could be
the crackerebox home courts that both Carleton and St.
Olaf nossess. These gyms, when filled with screaming Oles
and Carls, often make good basketball seem like wishful
thinking.

Jerry Mall of Monmouth, continuing to score at a tor-

slate gives him the opportunity of catching- the record.

The Conference record is 506 set by Ron Altenberg‘ of

final dual contest with Loyola

The Grinnell swimming team will splash in its last dual meet
of the season tomorrow against Loyola University of Chicago. The
meet will be held in the Grinnell pool starting at 1'30.

The Pioneers lost to Loyola
last year in a close meet, getting

rnone expects a similarly light
contest again this season, and
said it should wind up a nip
and tuck affair.

Simone could not pinpoint any

of the meet might l‘mLie. men-

tioning that Loyola had a great
team strength.
with several of his swimmers
injured, Simone felt that the
Pioneers would have an es
pecially difficult time netting
their eighth victory of the cniu
rent campaign.

Simone hopes that the Loyolal

encounter will help put the
tankers into top shape for de-
