Revolulionarie:

Are Determined

To The Editori

I've got to hand it to Roger
Koenker and his followers
They have something that we
don’t have, and Dan Winney’s
comment in last week's son
made this very clear.

With clever language and
cynical tono, Don winney
laughed at the revolutionaries.
He did not criticize their pro-
posal for revolution. No, he
divcllcd on the quality of the
speaker’s voice and the nature
of a supporters gesture. Ha

did not doubt the revolt but
the sincerity of those involvedi
Don's emphasis was misplaced,
The revolutionary method is
something worth criticizing,
but certainly not the honesty of
the revolutionaries.

Furthermore, Don’s “slap-
happy“ attitude toward last
week’s Senate meeting repre-
sents the attitudo of a good
number of students on this
campus. That is, a lot of stu-
dents do not havo a serious at-
titude toward not only the i
sues or college policy and visi—
tation but also campus life in
general.

Doubting the honesty of the
revolutionaries rather than the
revolution, Don pointed to a
flaw in our attitude and also to
a basic strength in Roger's
revolutionary movement: the
determination that we lack.
Most of us on campus do not
take this deter-mined attitude.
The revolutionaries do, They
have set out to finish what was
started last fall. and they just
might be successful.

“Grinnell As If Is"

To the Editor:

The general debate over tho
aims of campus lifc has become

stymied by two obstacles: ad.
ministrative caprico and our
own failure as students to clari-
fy our values and objectives.
We are therefore impelled to
examine our failure as a socio-
ty, the promises which remain
to be fulfilled, and the means
of their attainment. 1n facing
these problems with outspoken
clarity, we shall be better able
to press forward with the goals
of last fall's Encampment
First. North Campus is a
spurious community. We have
passively allowed a noisy but
insecure minority to impose
standards of abuse, banality,
and disrespect as the norms of
hall life — to subvert the very
notion of personality. To bols-
ter their sell-confidence and
remove status anxieties, many
students form tribal loyalties,
symbolized by Inrlokes, man.
nerisms, exaggerated imitation,
and the scrupulous exclusion of
noncomformists, The goal is to
be “one hell of a man.” The
result is abdication of manli~
ness, the formation of a herd,
Where fellowship invites
variety, the pack appeals to the
least common denominator: the
cheap, the vulgar, and the ob-
scene. As in other primitive cul-
tures, the iolkways are enforced
by an irrational taboo: the pun-
