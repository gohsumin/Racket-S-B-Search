Quartet Premiere

by Luciano Berio

To Be in Roberts Wednesday Night

Roberts Theatre will be the
scene of the world premiere
of a new work by the eminent
Italian composer Luciano Be-
rlo on Wednesday, November
25, at 8:00 p.m.

Borio, himself, will fly to
Iowa for the first performance
of his ”Sincronie, for String
Quartet," which was commis—
sioned by the college for per-
formance by the Lenox group,
Grinnell’s quartet-inrresidence.

The “Sincronie” will, as cus—
tot-nary with premieres, be
played twice, at the beginning
and end of the program. Claude
Debussy’s “String Quartet"
will be presented between the
two presentations of the new
work.

claim in both Europe and the

Argonne Applicants
Still Being Sought

Only one application for the
1965 Argonne Semester pro—
gram has been submitted from
Grinnell, according to LaVerne
Durkee, (biology) advisor for
the program.

Durkee said, however, that
applications may still be made
for the September 7—December
23 period even though the dead~
line was November 15. The first
period of the 1565 program
will be March 22-July 9; one
biology major has applied for
this time.

“Grinnell biology students
can fit the Argonne semester
into their schedule more eas»
ily than chemistry or physics
majors because of the many
required courses in the physi-
cal sciences," Durkee noted.
“Nonetheless, among the nine
other Associated Colleges of
the Midwest which participates
in this program, biology stu-
dents are the hardest to get.

The purpose of the Argonne
Semester is to complement the
liberal arts program by pro-
viding to science majors a
unique opportunity lor ad
vanced study in a research en-
vironment and laboratory eXr
perience as coworkers with
leading scientists.

Because of conflicting sched-
ules “among the participating
colleges the program is now
designed to last six months—7
four month instructional period
during which students divide
their time between a paid rer
search assignment and aca-
demic work, and two months
as a full-time paid student aide.
The student aide work can be
done‘ before and/or after the
instructional period, depending
on the student‘s college sched-
ule.

Student participating in the
Argonne semester pay the reg—
ular tuition to their home col-
lege. Housing at Argonne is
available in guest facilities on
the laboratory site or at nearby
institutions Regular college
vacations do not apply to stu-
dents in this program,

Grinnell’s participant in the
spring 1964 session was Mar-i

major,

United States, Berio’s works
include many compositions for
various traditional musical me-
dia, and he has also been ac-
tive in electronic music.

Called “one o! the most re»
freshing and provocative com-
posers to emerge from postwar
Italy," Luciano Berio is a com-
poser-teacher who divides his
time between the Studio of Ra-
diotelevisione ltaliana in Milan
and Mills Collage in California.
He studied with Paribeni and
Ghedini at the Milan Conserva-
tory and later with Dallapid
cola at Tanglewood under a
Koussevitsky Foundation schol-
arship,

‘Of his new “Sincronie” he
writes, “I was interested in
using the string quartet not es«
pecially as a polyphonic en-
semble, but rather as a single,
homophonic instrument. The
four participants elaborate the
same sequence of harmonic
blocs almost continuously, sim-
ultaneously ‘saying’ the same
thing in different ways.”

Members of the Lenox Quar-
tet, now in their third season
as artists-in-residence at Grin-
nell, are Peter Marsh and
Theodora Mantz, violins; Paul
Hersh, viola; and Donald Mc-
Call, cello. The focus of their
activity on campus is on cham-
ber music through teaching and
performing.

The quartet is currently in
New York rehearsing with Be-
rio.

Formed while its members
were performing as Fromm
Players at the Berkshire Music
Center, Tanglewood, Mass, the
group has become widely
known for its concerts at the
Spoleto Festival in Italy the

) Accident

Continued from page i
one foot. As soon as doctors allow
her to travel, she will return with
her parents to their home in Pitts-
burgh tor a lengthy recovery
period.

The most seriously injured of the
survivors, Miss Adra has not been

told of the death of her companion For
and friend. Doctors feel that they r’ ,

must do everything they can to
build her strength; she laces sur-
gery to set the broken bones in her

arms and legs. Following the ac— ‘

cident, Miss Adra spent hours in
surgery to close a severe lacera~
tion in the back of one knee. She
is reported in good spirits in the
Constant Care ward of lawn Meth-
odist Hospital, Des Molnes. (Under
the rules of the ward, patients are
not allowed ﬂowers, although mail
and cards are welcomed and en-
couraged.)

The campus tragedy was felt es-
pecially in the Park Street wo-
men’s White House residence,
which housed seven freshmen and
three npperclassmen. News of the
late Friday night accident didn’t
spread among the students until
the following morning. Immediate
plans were made by student'gov-
ernment officials to cancel all so-
old! events for the evening. A
chapel service conducted by Rabbi
Edward M. Zerin from Des Moines

was held in Herrick Chapel. The‘

girl's parents and two brothers at-

 

Pagp Seven

tended. Flowers for the services
were purchased with student gov-
ernment funds.
