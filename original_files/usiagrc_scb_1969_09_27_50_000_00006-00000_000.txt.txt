fWImt tlie‘ Hit/i is Going 011 Here. . .

By MARK GRAESER

To all them psuedo—sophistl-

ales on the east and west
hinges of our beloved country,
town is an uninterrupted waste
of crewcuts. condields, and
Imelly bums.

Grinnell. it seeml, ls suito-

ating in anonymity, a pearl

ast adrift in a sea of swine.

t can't even boast of a tar-

ished image in the east and
host; it has virtuauy no image
ht all to scores of high school
[tudents outside the Midwest.

All this information is to in-
troduce the heroes of the soon~
to-be—solved crisis: Jim Hormel
and Milt Bellows of Campbell
Films.

These gentlemen are making
I recruiting film for the Ad.
missions Office to be shown on
both commercial and educa<
{loual television, and in high
schools throughout the country.

The film will be in color, 281/2
minutes long, of general inter-
Qst and painstaking honesty —
that's an encapsulated view 0!
the ﬂick as expressed by Hor-
hiel in a recent interview with
the 58:3. The film has a dual
purpose! to acquaint prospec»
tive students with the idea oi
the ”small liberal arts institu-
tion," and to show Grinnell in
Its uniqueness.

“One thing we are selling

quite hard is the concept of
going on with your education
and how the small liberal arts
school is one option in that
continuity," said Hormel.
“Then beyond that we are fo-
cusing on those iactors that
make Grinnell different,"

Frequently, the iilming or
movies for college; has been
undertaken solely for the pur-
pose of soliciting alumni dona-
tions. The truth in such flicks
is often lost, or at least mis-
laid, Even Grinnell has had a
bad trip along those lines. A
movie made for AIM (Academ-
ic improvement Masterplan)
and shown at Various fund rais-
ing gatherings, was shown to
students, who found it had the
impact or a dead marshmal-
low. It seems the movie
abounded in oesrdlesa smiles.
students studying (mooing?)
conientedly under trees. and
couples walking hand in hand
down the railroad tracks to-
ward the sunset.

The new ﬁlm ought to be a
very different plum—less sweet,
but much easier to swallow.

“The primary requirement of
the film is honesty," said Hor-
mel. “We will be dealing with
students in this rum, and it
you’re going to try to do that
you've got to be honest. You
just can't get away with the

kinds of things that used to be
done in college movies. People
just don't go ior that bullshit
any more.”

“It is going to be an honest
movie,” assured Director of
Admissions Dale a. Terry. “We
have to be able to show it to
the student body without being
embarrassed."

Hormel and Bellows left Grin-
nell yesterday after only iii-
teen days oi shooting. How can
one get to know a place well
enough in such a short period
or time to portray it honestly?

It is not an easy task to be
sure, but both men — although
young —— have had much expe-
iience in making movie. or
this kind. They have made
films on Amherst, Bucknell,
Colby, Williams, Middleoury,
and eleven or twelve others.

They go to a college with a
conception of how to quickly
learn what and why things oc-
cur. They learn who is consid-
ered to be the most articulate
spokesman tor the rlght as well
as the left. They extract opin-
ions and all shades of student
thought. They speak to dean!
and faculty as well, principally
for background information.

“You just can't find out what
a place is like by talklng to the
president of the school. You’ve
got to speak to students," Hor-
mel pointed out.

The real key to findlng out
"what Grinnell is all about,"
Hormel said, “is to learn
where to put you'le faith. We
put our faith in students.”
Cynics among us may aver
that the collage can uiiord to
’let some things be said, out
they would never allow
(gasp!) complete honesty! Hon-
rnel denies that this is true. He
and Bellows were hired. he said,
without a script. They were
hired to come to Grinnell and
answer on film these questionsl
Why do students come hero'P.
Why do they stay? What is

good here?
What is bad?

“Our function here has been
to investigate and recommend,
not carry out orders," Hormel
stated.

All the film has been shot
for the movie, and now they
take it hack to Saans River.
Vermont, where they will edit
it. It is they who decide what
stays in and what goes, Hers
mel said. But what i! the Ad-
missions Ofﬁce finds something
terribly offensive in the final
product? “They gave their ap-
proval to everything we shot
at the time we did It, I just
don’t see the possibility of that
happening."

if the final product reflect.
Hormel's impressions of Grins
nell, as it no doubt will, there
is llttle for the Admissions 0f-
flce to worry about. He is quite
impressed with the place.

“Grinnell is as impressive a
place as I've ever been. it in
really exceptional,

“The most outstanding thing
about it ls the amount of tal-
ent that exists here. At Mid-
dlebury, an orchestra can’t
even be maintained because of
a lack of talent. but Grinnell
has a fine one.

“The ideal of the liberal arts
education seems to be much
more of a reality here than at
most places. Students seem not
to specialize so much here.
but may have diverse interests.
For instance, people who aren't
journalism majors work on the
newspaper, athletes get in.
volved in student government,
and so forth.

“One of the most impressive
things about Grinnell has been
the way students reacted to
the cameras. You can tell a
lot about the sophistication of
students that way. Like at a
little all women’s college in the
east where once the girls get
in from of the camera they
start giggling and waving at

and (shudder)

There was none or that shit at
Gmlnell."

Technically, the movie wlll
be mostly in “synch,” that is
the actuality of an event will
be preserved, but the ”voice
over" dubbing technique will
also be used. This involves
showing footage of a scene
while tapevrecorded segment!
of interviews with students are
played. For instance, a dass-'
room scene is shown while a
student’s voice is heard dis-
cussing what classes are like
at Grinnell.

Nearly all of the actual
shooting of the ﬁlm was done
indoors, although some shots,
like oi dogs, squirrels, and
folks holding hands on the rail-
road tracks walking toward
the ,sunset. were done outside.

it you thought tho lights at
the a. B. King and Jesse Ful-
ler concerts were rather bright,
you were really only mistaken.
“They really aren't as bright
as they looked," said Hormel
oomiortiagly. “We used light.
log only to duplicate natural
lighting in the room, we didn't
try to be artistic." This pt54
sumably means the movie will
appear just as the real thing,
except the stars may ha I
