Mile-Relay Team
Eyes 3:125 Time

Goals are set to be met and
Grinnell College's crack mile-
relay.quartet has every inten»
tion of meeting the standards
they have marked down for
themselves.

Before the season started.
tine allrjunior team — Ron
Schachel, Jeri Langliam, John
TePaske and Bruce Beckord—
got together and decided they
would hit 3:125 in the event.

“The talent is therE," says

Coach Dick Young. “And I
wouldn’t be too surprised to
Ice them do even better than
that if they are all clicking at
once. We perform well at the
Drake Relays—maybe it will
be there.”

Even though handicapped to
some extent because of poor
indoor trainingdacilities, this
crew has already set one new
record~a 3226.4 in the Chica-
gorMidwest Conference meet
last weekend.

This, however, is not the best
time logged by the four. in
trials for the Chicago Daily
News Relays they turned in a
3: 4.8. Running for the first
time on the boards, the quartet
won its mile-relay division
with a 3:25.11.

The record 3126.4 does not
seem too Spectacular by itself;
but take a look at what the four
did during the three hours
prior to the race, Schachel, the
leadoff man, ran in three 6|)-
yard dashes and three 60-yard
low-hurdle races. Then he
pushed out two 2le legs and a
440.

Langharn was warming up
for his contribution by clipping
off two 880’s. TePaske opened
the afternoon’s work by com-
peting in the broad jump. From
the pit, he ran a pair of 220’s
and an 880.

Meanwhile, Beckord was not
loafing. Before the feature
event’s call, he tackled three
SOsyard dashES, two 220 sprints,
and an 880. The mile relay was
his seventh race of the day!

To meet that 3:115 goal,
Young figures Schachel will
have to run a :435 out of the
blocks, with both Langham
and TePaske following with
ids’s. If they do this, Beckord
needs just a :47. but Young
thinks he is capable of going
lower than that With a run-
ning start.

This mile mark isn't the only
goal these four have set for
themselves as a relay unit. if
they can cut their times to
meet a 3:211 standard in the
sprint medley, they‘ll be hap-
PY-

To do this, Beckord needs a
:47.5 quarter, while Schachel
and TePaske get :2l.8's in their
220’s. That leaves Langham,
who seems to be the most at
home in the 880, With the re-
sponsibility of going at least
1:52 in his specialty.

“Actually, this goal doesn’t
seem as far out of reach as
the mile standard.” says
Young. “These fellows have all
had times close to these break-
downs, but never at the Same
time.

”One of these days they are
going to click and there will
be one happy relay quartet and

 

one very pleased coach.”

I'hinclads Win at North Central
Rod Brown Takes Two Firsts

The Grinnell cindermen swept
to a victory in the North Cen-
tral Relays in Naperville, out-
distancing host North Central
by 9 points, ending up with a
total of 49 markers. This was
the first Naperville victory by
the Pioneer thinclads, having
finished third and second in
two previous years.

Grinnell's victory was due to
their fine effort in the relays
and the individual distance
events. Ron Schachel, Jeri
Langham, John TePaske, and
Bruce Beckord won the 12 lap
relay and finished second in
the eight lap, with times of
4:013 and 231.4, respectively.

The 20 lap team also tri-
umphed, with John Teising, Te-
paske, Langham and Beckord
covering the distance in 7:32.55.

Rod Brown repeated his feat
of last year, Winning the mile
and 2—mile with times of 4:38.6
and 9153.1.

Coach Young singled out Jim
Miller, sophomore shotputter,
who came within one inch of
the school record, tossing the
shot 48'4” and Mike Dewitt,
who improved greatly to finish
third and fifth in the high and
low hurdles, Young also pointed
out the inconsistency of his
jumpers and Grinnell's weak-
ness in the sprints.

Looking to the future, Coach

Young noted that the Pioneers
would be strengthened with the
addition of pole-vaulter Clyde
Smith and shotrputter Jeff
Lewis, refugees from Winter
sport squads, and John Kelsey.
