Senate Appoints New Committee
Bureaucratic Octopus Flourishes

by Tom Greenﬁeld

Greg Vranicar launched a
thirty minute hoopla about
student power last Tuesday when
he denied the much accepted
notion that the student power
push of last semester had died
with Steve Schwartz’s grade
point. While perceptively
acknowledging that students
seemed apathetic toward the
student power issue, (why should
this issue be different?) he forces
fully asserted his own interest
inthe student steering committee
negotiations, and requested that
the Senate find out what has been
happening in the meetings, Andy
Loewi and Phil Mears defended
the closed meeting of the steering
committee and Mr. Betts’ faculty
committee. (“They have been
hacking out things for quite a
while and it Will waste time to
go back and explain things over
and over again to new people
sitting in.”) However, the Senate
decided to assign Jim Lew and
Frank Thomas to attend the
meetings and report back to the
Senate.

The student power discussion
grew out of a Senate report on
its recent dinner With President
Leggett. At the dinner, Dr.
Leggett announced to the Senate
that Dean Kimbo will take over
as Dean of Students next year.
The Senate announced to Dr.
Leggett that they were ”ticked”
at the administration for not
allowmg students to participate
in the selection of Mrs. Low’s
replacement. When Dr. Leggett
assured the senators that the
students would participate in the
selection of the assistant dean,
the students stated that they were
not'sure that they even wanted
an assistant dean per se. Con~
sidering the fact that Saga was
serving chicken and mushroom
sauce that night, one can only
surmise that it was a fairly
depressing dinner all the way
around.

In response to the procedure
of Dean Kimbo’s selection, (The
Senate was careful to note that
they were raising no objections
to Mr. Kimbo personally or
professionally) the Senate issued
an “offical protest” on the matter

and urged the students on the
student affairs committee to
start working on a system which
would allow students to par
ticipate in the “decision
making process“ of the Dean's
Office.

Andy Brill announced that he
is looking for a poobplaying
biologist With a knowledge of
lewd stories and Hebrew to fill
a vacancy on the finance cunb
mittee. The position is open to
allstudents.

In a surprise move, Frank
Thomas announced that as of 3: 00
yesterday, no posters could be
placed on the library walls or
doorways Without Mr. Alden's
approval. Although Frank in-
sisted that the.rationale for this
rule was that posters harm the
“aestheticbeautyofthelibrary,”
nobody believedhim.

Moving from the ridiculous to
the sublime, Frank called on

students to register their ar-
ticulate gripes about the foreign

language requirement with his
office, so the SGA can “do
something about it." (the Crowd
roared.) Further discussion led
to a motion to take an already
established committee of
students concerned with the
problem and make them (drum
roll) AN OFFICIAL COMV
MITTEE OF THE STUDENT
SENATE WITH ALL THE OF-
FICIAL POWERS AND
PRIVILEGES AND PRESTIGE.

Drunk with its own power, the
Senate took the student com-
mittees on grades, residents
halls, freshman curriculum, and
counseling and rendered them all
official committee of the Senate

Jayne West then proposed that
the Senate create three new
committees, thereby bringing the
total to 1649. Jayne said that this
figure represented a new ACM
record and that the money gained
from this prestige would help
defray the cost of the Physical
Education complex. Alter ap-
proving a committee on
residence halls, health center,
and (get this) the student hand-
book, everybody went home.

Student Reviews Admissions Promotion Film

The new film Griniicll recently
released by the Admissions
Department nicely serves the
purpose of recruiting new
students. The iilm presents all
that one would expect of a college
public relations effort 7 smiling
faces, earnest' eyes, industrious
students, dedicated teachers, a
busy and happy campus. Aiter
a rather pretentious beginning of
the Star Spangled Banner, the
Vietnam War, and Riots in the
Street, the film settles down to
describing the advantages ,of a
liberal arts college. Classified as
the same type of school as Porno»
na, Swarthmore, and Oberlin,
Grinnell is presented as a socially
liberal, politically active, and
academically ﬂexible institution
whose primary goal is the
development of the proverbial
“wellsrounded personality.”
Students who are “eager to test
their ideas" are encouraged to
come. The ideals of change,
growth, and (almost) enlighten
ment are suggested. And over
and over again the necessity for
“involvement" in the social and
academic environment of the
College is stressed. Grinnell
College in the eyes of a potential
student must seem an attractive
challenge.

The many remarkably un-
staged episodes of the movie
exhibit most aspects of college
life. Classes, of course. get their
share oftilm coverage. The many
scenes of Central Campus and the
Forum suggest a friendly and
relaxed atmosphere. Music,
dance, and art serve to em-
phasize the creative element of
education, Dormitory existence
is embodied in lounge parties and
cozy bedroom chats. By pres
senting a section on student
government, the film introduces

the concept of student respon-
sibility in dectsion making.
“Drugs, free sex, and drinking”
become symbols oi a new and
unexplored world of personal
freedoms to be found on the Grin-
nell campus Jesse Fuller and B.
E, King represent the tormal
social activity of the college. Two
surprises arise in the film. First,
the shots of the lowa countryside
are amazingly attractive, and
second. Grinnell’s relatively
small athletic department
becomes an asset to the college’s
scholastic reputation, Even the
problems of civil rights, racism,
radicalism, and student unrest
are touched upon. No one could
accuse this film of not showing
the view of almost every type
of usual college activity.

TURNEki cont. from page 1
Mr. Turner would tell a group
of women just that, were he so
inclined. Certainly, Mr. Turner
is not a clever semanticist and
would never risk employing tact
in lieu of trenchant commentary.
Naturally l inquired into the
Turneresque interpretation of
factual events surrounding the
involvement at the Attorney
General's office in ﬁle Grinnell

campus are unaware of the issues
and general substance of these

administrators? Does it convey
the various kinds of experiences
at Grinnell" Perhaps. At least,
as far as any public relations film
could ever be honest or accurate,
this film is both. The benefits of
the smallness of the school are
voiced repeatedly. Even the
advantages of being located in
Iowa receive much attention.
However, there are some things
missing, There are no “freaks,"
there are no unbeautilul, un-
diligent people. While there is
great importance accorded to the
demands students may make
upon professors. little is actually
said about changing curriculum.
Most of all, there is an expected
lack of anguish, of nonssuccess,
of failure. Life comes too easily
in the movie. The film conveys
only a very pleasant and
sometimes amusing picture of
me“goodness"oflife at Grinnell.
