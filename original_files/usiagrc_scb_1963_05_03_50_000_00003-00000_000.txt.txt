Nyasa/ander on Tour
‘0 ‘;_Curl Lamb

Relaxing in a large Chair in his room at Grin-

neil House, Konyama Chiuinc. the Minister of
Education of Nyasatand, remarked on the irony
or his oiricial State Department tour of the Unite
cd States Just three years earlier. Chiume had
spent some tune in the United States upon exile
here his native country at the time his Malawi
Congress Party iinally emerged as a threat to
British rule thoie.

At that time, also, the State Department was
keeping a caretul watch over Chiumc. In the
three short years since that time. the rapid
flux or Airican politics has elevated Chitimc to
the position or Minister or Education and Social
Development of the soonstosbe independent
British protectorate oi Nyasaland.

There is one oualirication for membership
in the “power elite” of a new African nation
asserted Chiulne: “identification with the colonial
struggle." As African states finally abandon
their colonial status. the previous requirements
of an Oxford or Harvard decree hecomc “not
all that important.” Personal experience with
colonial persecution serve as a loyaltv oathsins
action to eliminate those ”shepherds" that would
“desert their flock in a storm.”

One or Mr. Chiume’s iii-st projects upon his
appointment as Minister of Education was to
embark on a ten-fold men use in secondary
school enrollment. He is also interested i In-
crcascd collece opportunities [or the M' uwi.
During the California portion oi his tour. Chiui e
hopes to observe “Disneyland and the California
Junior College system.”

Although he expects Iew insights Irom the
iormcr. the latter interests him as a means to
broaden the base or Malawi citizens with hiohci
education. Operating in an area in which “necesr
sity is ottcn the matter of invention." Chiumc
feels that the introduction at an abbreviated
college experience could prove an important
educational innovation.
> For a continent in n “terrible hurrv" cvcn
lol‘l’ years is too long to wait for desperately
needed civil servants, technicians, and govern—
ment leaders. An ”established piece or paper”
granted atter tour years or college has little
meaning when compared to the task of building
a nation ironi scratch.

The flexibility of credits and emphasts on
student initiative in the American higher ctlu»
cational system impressed Mr, chiume. He trit
that, by contrast, the British s stem was a
spoon-red, “pat-0il—the»l)ack" alter-nut . Things
British rarely rarecl well when Submltted to the
exileeinadeemin' te s close scrutiny and keen uit.

Chiumc rema :ed pointedly that in all the
years or his t a mug as a teacher he had never
studied the history of Nyasaland His education
had consisted of mastering “Victoria, ‘ both
Charles‘ and Cromwelrs, and tracing the railroad
lines from Liver-pool to Manchester"

The birth at the Malawr lstory program
took place in a rail several ycais ago when Dr
Banda, the present Prime Minister at Nyasaland
lound hiinselt imprisoned with some teachers
similarly persecuted for their political beliefs
In that cell the teachers taught Dr. Banda their
disciplines and he in turn outlined to them the
history of the country that had then relected
him but which he was later to load to inde-
