relationship rather than its regulation.

For most faculty members, the college
level is the most important level of dis-
cussion. The important questions at this
level tend to he: does the ROTC program
conform to the standards applicable to
all other courses at the college, and if
not, can it be made to contorm to these
standards.

The argument has been made that both
the contract the school has signed with
the Air Force, and the laws establishing
the ROTC, provide that the contents of
ROTC courses are to be determined by
the Air Force, and the books used in
these courses are to be prepared by the
Air Force. it is further argued that
the staff members who teach these

courses are proposed by the Air Force.
although the college may reject them.
Thus, some Grinllell professors mama
tam the ROTC program is independent of
the College. Unlike other courses, the
ROTC courses do not receive divisional,
executive council, and faculty approvals.
Since faculty can control neither the
Contents nor the Standards of these
courses, they should not be regarded as
acceptable academic courses deserving
academic credit.

There are two basic objections to their
argument: (1) that Air Force control,
although provided for by the contract
and the law, is not really exercised, and
(2) that the faculty doesn’t really control
any courses. However, the Air Force
does set goals and establishes limits on
the contents of these Courses, and if
at any time Washington officials Should
chose to pay attention to Grinnell, they
have the legal authority to exert control
beyond what the faculty normally has
over courses. Thus ROTC independence
of faculty control is a qualitative step
greater man that of any other course
or department.

It is the independence of faculty con-
trol that is the main basis of the move-
ment to deny credit to ROTC courses.
There are other less central arguments
motivating this movement. Some de—
scribe ROTC courses as advocating the
specific political and military viewpoints
of the Air Force, and thus proselytizing
rather than promoting a dispassionate
search for the truth.

For those who argue at the college lev-
a], there is no question of termination
of our Contract with ROTC. The question
at this level is how independent ROTC

The committee planning the Student
Symposium on Poverty has announced
the names or the conference speakers
and the topics of the panel discussions.

On April 22, Robert Coles, research
psychiatrist at Harvard University will
give the opening address providing an
overview of poverty in America and a
general definition of the problems in-
volved in reducing poverty. Also on
Tuesday, Grant Crandall, senior politi-
cal science major, will moderate a panel
on Urban poverty with panelists Craig
Beverly, administrator of the Milwaukee
inner City Development Project, Robert
coles. and Philip Hauser, proiessor of
sociology and director at the Population
Research and Training Center at the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

We panels and two lectures will take
place on Wednesday, April 23. Dick
Hartz, junior anthropology major. will
moderate a panel on Rural Poverty
made up of Harry M. Caudill, attorney
at law and author, Robert Coles, Hurry
Huge, attorney at law and participant
in the southern Center for Studies in
Public Action, and Tom Sasaki, associate
prolessor of sociology and anthropology
at Johns Hopkins University. Roy lnnis,
Executive Director of the Congress on
Racial Equality, will speak on the (actor

is, and whether this independence is so
comparatively great that we should deny
them credit. Some faculty are concerned
that the denial of academic credit would
have the same effect as termination of
our contract even if it would take longer.
However, there are now six institutions
which give no credit for Army ROTC
and 3 which give no credit for AFRoTC,
and in none of these cases has the ROTC
program been withdrawn by the military,

Finally, there is a group which can
siders all the above questions irrelevant,
and quibbling about trivial principles. To
these individuals, the most relevant faCA
tor is that no students are being harmed,
and that some are being helped. They
favor the retention or the ROTC contract
on the grounds that some could not at~
tend Grinnell without ROTC funds.

This appears to be a horribly narrow
perspective to take on this issue, Surely
Grinnell is not so poverty stricken that
it must depend on the Air Force to ii~
nance the education of deserving stu<
dents.

ty. Wednesday’s schedule,is completed
by a lecture on the role of community
organization in reducing poverty by saul
Alinsky, Executive Director of the InduSn
trial Areas Foundation, followed by a
panel on the same topic led by Diane
Ruvﬂelaere including Saul Alinsky, Edv
win Beriy, Executive Director or the
Chicago Urban League, Stoney Cooks
administrator of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, James Lowry,
New York social worker, and the Rev
erend Calvin 5. Morris, associate Direc<
tor ot the National Operation Bread—
basket.

On Thursday, April 24, the final panel
will deal with governments role in re
ducing poverty. Howard Ward, a senior
political science major, will moderate
the discussion among Anthony Downs
evaluating present attempts to eliminate
poverty and attempting a prognosis o!
poverty in America.

During the Symposium several com»
munity action and social welfare groups
will be represented on campus. The stu-
dent body is encouraged to look into
these constructive organizations for
summer work. Throughout the days of
the conference there will be many small
discussion groups for students to dis-
cuss iurther with the speakers the prob
lems and conflicts brought out by the
panels and lectures.

tionship with a wide range of college:
and universities.

A student in the Air Force pro-
gram on this campus is consistent-
ly challenged in his ideas, his
beliefs and his conclusions. He should
1 think, be more perceptive and sensitive
citizen and officer as a result. By the
same token, so long as AFROTC main<
tains a position as an integral academic
department, the Faculty, Administra-
tion, and students have a better oppor-
tunity to exercise strong influence over
the kind of education given to future
officers. For example, the AFROTC pro
gram has met, and will continue to
meet, all requirements established by
Grinnell College for review and approval
of curriculum and instructional staff. Ac-
tions which loosen the bonds between
the academic community and the Air
Force ROTC program are therelore, i
believe, regressive.
