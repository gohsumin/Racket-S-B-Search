St. Olaf games in Nm‘thfield
two weeks ago and should be
able to do a more than adequate
job. Smith is Currently the fifth
best scorer on “he team with
8.6 points per game and has
nearly eight rebounds per cons
test. Pushing Smith for the
open starting berth has been
sophomore Ted Risse'r.

Filling out the starting ﬁve
will probably be eases/ptains
John Sundelvl and Jim Mifflin,
Jeff Fra-ntz, and Dave Seller-
gren. Sundell, a 6-7 senior, is
the conference’s top rebounder,
pulling down 207 stray shots ior
a 20.1 rebounds per game aver»
age. Mifﬂ’in is third in Lhe con-
ference in scoring with a 20.3
points per game average Soph-
omore Jeff Frantz is also

among the top individual scor»
ers witii 153 points per game.
Framz' average was knocked
down a couple of points after
the game at St. Olaf, where he
suffered a sprained ankle in the
first two minutes oi play. The
starting five is rounded out by
Dave Sellergren, who scored
the winning basket at St Olaf.

The Pioneers are now 8-2 on
the season with a 5-1 Midwest
Conference record, losing only
to iirst place Ripon early in the
season. Grinnell is second in
the conference behind Ripon
(741 in conference play) and will
have to beat the Scots tomor-
row if they want to stay in sec-
ond place. Ripon and third
place Cornell (6-2) are both idle
this week and a Grinnell loss

would drop the Pioneers to third
place.

Monmoiilh’s eighﬂi place i~at~
ing and M record in conference
play is certainly a misnomer.
The Scots are fresh from vic-
tories last weekend over Carle-
ton (93-79) and St. Olaf (81-76}.
Two of their five losses were
by only one point, and they lost
to Goa by only tihree points.
79776.

Three of the Scots are among
the conference’s top scorers.
Gary Gilliland with 10.1 points
per game, Dick Rodgers with
17.3, and Harold Rathgeb wiih
15.3, Gilliland scored 37 points
in the Carleton game last week-
end and boasts a fall-away
jump shot that’s just about im-
possible to block. His shots i'e-
mind a number of people of
ex-Moninouth star Jerry Mell
of a couple of years back. Rath-
geb is tough on the boards in
addition in his point getting
ability. 4

Starlers will probably include
Rathgeb, Rodgers, Gilliland,
Dick Yahrike, a 6-3 forward,
and Dave Lindgrem Lindgren,
a Mo guard is a junior trans.
fer student who just become
eligible at tlhe start of the sec—
ond semester. Lindgren played
well against Carleton and St.
Olaf and can be expected to
contribute a great deal to the
Monmouth attacki

Other action in the Midwest
Conferende includes: Stl Nor-
bert at Lawrence today. and
tomorrow’ St. Ambrose at Coe.
