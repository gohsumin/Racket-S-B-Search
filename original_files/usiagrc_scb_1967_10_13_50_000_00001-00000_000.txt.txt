CARLETON UPS OPENS

from THE CARLETONIAN

Saturday night open houses
have been extended to 1 a.m.
as a result of “good arguments"
by the Open House Committee.

with this modification, the
new agreement~ which will go
into eitect tomorrow nightels
identical to last years The
East Side will have open houses
between 7:30 p.m. and man pm
Friday and on Wednesday and
Sunday afternoons.

West Side open houses will be
Saturday between 7:30 and 1:00
am. and Tuesday and Friday
afternoons. All afternoon open
houses extend from 1 through 5.

Widespread Approval

The extended hours on Satura
day night have met with wide-
5 p r e a d approval by Men’s
League, Women’s League, R.A,'s
and Proctors, who have all re»
Cel'itly approved the open house
proposal,

Aim Laws, Chairman of the
Open House committee, attribu-
ted the extended hours to “the
Deans’ willingness to listen with
open minds to our arguments,"
In its meeting with the Deans
last week, the Committee had
contended that an extenSlon of
the hours would make Saturday
open ho u s e s more flexible,
Couples would no longer have
to choose between open houses
and other activities —- they
could go to both. Also, the com
mittee pointed out, roommates
could schedule their visits to
open houses so they wouldn‘t

coincide. “Any inconvenience
which might result because of
later hours can easily be work<
ed out among roommates,"
stated Miss Laws.

Arguments ‘Convincing’
Dean Jean Phillips agreed that
the arguments were “quite con<
vincing. They made very good
arguments; with the later wom-
en's hours it makes good sense
to have longer open houses."

Joel Tibbets, assistant Dean
of Men, feels the extended
hours indicate the College is
“willing to deal with people as
human beings." and is very
happy with the new agreement.
He pointed out, though, that
proctors have been instructed
to enforce the ”No drinking by
mixed couples during open
house" rule.

Commented D e a n Phillips,
“While 21—year»old couples who
drink together outside of open
house might naturally want to
do the same during open
houses, we can't Consider that
possibility for some time. The
FA Committee was quite ex<
plicit in forbidding mixed
drinking in open houses.

“It wouldn't be wise to agi-
tate for future change on this
matter until the values of the
present social policy Change!
are confirmed."

Twenty-one year olds not in
mixed company will be able
to drink in the dorms during
open houses.

iii RADIO NEXT MONTH I

By PAUL NACHMAN

Grinnell‘s ten~watt FM radio
station will take to the air
"hopefully towards the end of
November," according to sta-
tion manager Babak Arinajani.

“The radio station will be
amateur,” he said, “but it’ll be
better than what you can get
now. We'll be stressing classi<
cal music, serious jazz, and seri-
ous folk since the airwaves are
pretty well saturated with rock,"

The station employs 133 peo-
ple—more than one-tenth of the
campus. Many or them are in-
volved in an enormous amount
of behind-the-scenes operations
including engineering, purchas<
ing, and program development.

“It’s an educational experience
for all of us," noted Armaiani,
a senior political science major,
“Few of us know much about
radio."

He stressed the educational
and creative outlets the station
will provide. “I expect there
will be something regarding
communications in the Curricu-
lum Committee’s report. Mr.
I-laveman (a member of the
committee) is very excited
about the radio and has helped
us a lot," Annalani explained.

The staff has just finished
scheduling the 120 hour broad-
cast week. Morning \vakerup
programs, rock shows, news-
casts, and delayed broadcasts
will be interspersed with the
more serious musical offerings.

”Delayed broadcasts" include

BBC transcripts of topical dis:
cussions, tapes of on—campus
gatherings such as the recent
Vietnam discussion in Gates. re<
cordings oi programs at Ex
Loco Parentis, and other gen.
eral features.

“Our news department is tre‘
mendous,” Armajani said with'
enthusiasm, ”I think the 5&1],
may concentrate more On fea<
tures once we get started since
we can get the break on any
campus story,

“We'll have excellent national
and international coverage—in
great depthaby taking full ad-
vantage of what the UPI wire
service provides."

The station has a fairly exteih
sive library of records and will
be able to draw on several pri-
vate campus collections. An
RCA Red Seal classical library,
consisting of more than 140 rec-
ord sets recently arrived unan-
nounced, Armajanl noted—i!
complete gift, he added. other
record companies make regular
contributions.

The disc jockeys for the roclf
shows will play their personal
preferences as to type of mush!
on their programs. “Rock is de.
fined in the broadest sense,“
Armaiani explained. ”We wan!
to encourage the deejays to use
their own discretion in deciding
what to play. The variety will
be a learning experience for
everyone."

The station will be quartered
in the northeast corner of Darby
on the first and second floors.

 

SENATE SEEKS PUBLICITY

The Senate meeting this wed-
nesday was one of the shortest
on record, lasting 21 minutes.
The major issue was an inquiry
by a senator from North con-
ceming the necessity for a reg-
ular column of Senate and other
student government activities to
be run weekly in the 5&1}. It
was felt that the student in-
terest in the workings ot the
government would be height-
ened by the constant exposure
to a description of these ac
tivities, and the general apathy
that is present on campus
would be counteracted.

Another prominent issue was
stimulated by Neil Fischer’s
column on the College Book
Store. An inquiry was made as
to the reason for the lack of
progress by the committee on
the store organized last year.
David Swee answered that in
the chaotic Spring-Fall Senate
changeovers it was absorbed
and smothered by the commit-
tee on the student used book
store.

The lack of visiting privileges
in the Health Center was dis-
cussed. At present, the rules
call for visits only by the North
Campus house presidents and
the South Campus hall health
chairmen. An investigation was

commissioned to d e t e r min is
whether visitation rights could
be extended to include all cases
which would not endanger the
health of the visitor or the
patient.

A Cabinet statement con-
firmed the report that the Wed-
nesday night dress rehearsal of
the Verdi Requiem Mass was
to be cancelled, due to the
professional singers' desire to
preserve their voices.

JUDICIAL COUNCIL

(“The Council will make
public a brief statement ex<
plaining the basis for any
disciplinary action taken."
SGA Constitution, 111, B, 8,
g)

The Judicial Council feels
that stealing from SAGA II
a serious offense. The Coun-
cil believes, however, that
the evidence in the case just
brought before it indicates
that the individual con-
cerned was not guilty of re
current acts of thefts. it
therefore gave him a strong
reprimand and warned him
that any further acts of
theft on his part would M
dealt with more severely.
