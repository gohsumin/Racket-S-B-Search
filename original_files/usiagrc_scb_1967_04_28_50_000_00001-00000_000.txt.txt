Campus radio station
to operate next fall

by Mary Malcolm

Pending iinancing and administra-
tive approval, the Grinnell radio sta-
tion will set up its equipment this spring
and begin broadcasting in the tall, ac-
cording to Babak Arntajaitl, manager of
the embryonic station.

Arnlajani will have a functioning stati
of over 50 people by the ettd of next
week. SGA will subsidize the radio sta-
tion. Armajani said a college beneiac—
tor has pledged to match a fund drive
if additional money is needed. After the

Work on the proposed college radio
station will be delayed tor several
weeks until a FCC broadcasting li-
cense ls received from the district
office in Minneapolis.

lnitial installation costs, Armajani esti-
mates the minimal yearly cost for sal<
arias, maintenance and growth at
$1000.

The station will be registered with the
_FCC as an educational FM station. Ar-
majani explained that FM provides
higher quality sound, “so that we can
broadcast classical music without feel-
ing guilty about it," and is less expen-
sive and complicated to operate.

Since the idea of the radio Station
began two years ago with Armajani and
contact with other college stations, or-
ganizations and services providing pro-
grams, record companies, and the FCC.

The radio project was "adopted” by
a senate committee ullder the Kent ad
ministration. Present SGA president
nlc MacDowell appointed Armajani sta-
tion manager. Armajani appointed Cloud
personnel manager.

Armajani sees the radio station a lab-
oratory ior students at the social
aciences. The Station will provide op-
portunities for large numbers oi people
in journalism through news broadcast-
[rig and editing. It will otter opportulli~
ties in speech, business administration,
personnel work, and creative program-
ming. The Station will subscribe to the
UPI teletype Service and handle nation-
Al and international as well as campus

Senate debates Initiative
Fund. abolition of Riot

By Andy Isaacs

Senate controversy centered this week
around the initiative fund, the actions
of the college paper and “Spring Riot".

The resolution favoring the abolish<
ment of “Spring Riot" was designed
to spark discussion among the students.
Senators defeated a motion to establish
a committee on the riot, preferring to
discuss the matter as a body. Hoping
students would be more likely to ex<
press ideas to their individual senators
if a definite motion were made, the
Senate brought the motion to the floor
for discussion and tabled it until next
week to await student reaction.

Senators generally seemed to agree
that “Spring Riot” had little to recom-
mend itself. Ray Horn and Derrick
TePaske expressed the belief that few
people really enjoy the riot, while Mike
Pill suggested that setting aside one
Special day for letting loose tended to
create social pressure to conform to

Interim Court’s action
By Richard SchneirOV

Tuesday night the Interim Court con-
victed seniors James Stuart. Ken
Adelntan, James Drasdo, and juniors
Barry Nemmers and Dale Mossey oi
disorderly conduct during “Spring Riot.”

The court recommended that James
Stuart be expelled from the college.
They also recommended social expulsion
for Drasdo, and Adelman, and that they
not be allowed to participate in grad.
uation exercises. Social expulsion means
that the students involved would have
to leave the college campus by Satur<
day, April 29, and take their Senior
Comprehensive exams off campus.

It was recommended that Massey be
given social expulsion and conduct
probation for next semester and that
Nemmers also he put on conduct pro-
bation.

The Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, with the Deans sitting in as
advisors, will shortly consider the recom-
mendations of the court and appeal:
by the tive delendants.

The case involved charges by David
Dillon and Adrienne Lemmons that the
five Cowles Hall members harrassed
them with water balloons and eggs
during ”Spring Riot.” The speciiic de
tails of the case were released to the
college community in a letter printed
in the Reporter last week signed by
both Dillon and Miss Lemn‘lons.

in judging the case members at the
court relied not only on evidence ob—
tained during “Spring Riot” but also
on past actions.

Witnesses testified to a “sick society"
in Cowles Hall. Rick Sprott, former
president of Cowles testified that a
“Dillon hate campaign has been going
on intermittently tor the last three years
and that nearly everybody in Cowles
has been involved in it at one time
or another.” He laid the blame on a
small group or approximately ten people
with James Stuart as the main influence.

Sprott went on to say, “This can-
not be handled a: one incident. It can
only be looked at as a larger problem.
There has been at complete lack of
respect for people in the Cowles com-
munity. . . it has gone beyond the
polntof fun."

He described how some students threw
Water balloons at visitors and at de-
livery boys from Ahrvano’s Pizza, how
paper clips were used to jam doorsn
how students anonymously telephoned
girls on South Campus to make dates
for other hall members; how doors were
burned down and Smashed in as “pranks”
and how certain members at the hall
were held up to ridicule.

He also told of the harassment of
girls who Came to the hall. “I'VE had
several girls who came into my room
in tears because of this.u

Spmtt related how he tried to control
the situation through tines, personal
conierences, consultation with resident
advisers, from other halls, Kenneth
Christianson, faculty adviser to Cowlés,
and finally Dean 3. Eugene Thompson.

Dr. Christianson (biology) Spoke at
the hearing backing up previous testi-
mony. He described Cowles Hall as
having a "Mafia”-like atmosphere —‘ot
vendetta - where people are afraid
to testify, The hall system in Cowles
has been totally unable to deal with
the problem."

A petition signed by 33 members at
Cowles Hall accusing the live defendant!
was also submitted as evidence. Dil<
lon said that earlier he had been wile
ling to settle for a public apology but
that many of the petition signers had
asked for a public airing of the case,

In R statement to the court. Dillon
asked for penalties of conduct pro<
