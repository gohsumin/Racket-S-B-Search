To the Editor:

While 1 e ‘oyed Protessor
Nasser‘s pe -eptive and superbly
written review oi “Midnight
Cowboy." I am sorry to have to
call attention to all error in
elementary logic committed by a
philosopher This is the use or
two word as though they had the
same maiiing; “liberal" and
”ruling class " The name of this
tallaey is “equivocation”
Prolessor Nasser uses it to beg
the question.

There are liberals in the ruling
class tKennedy, McCarthy,
Rockclellcl', Lindsayt; there are
liberals out of it (me). But there
are also people who are not
liberals in the ruling class
(Nixon, Thurmond, Ellender,
Goldwater), and these people,
whom we call “conservatives,"
slow and obstruct the liberal
revolution because they do not
want it to happen.

Professor Nasser speaks of the
diselilranchised, who are also the
Concern of the liberal, The goal
of thelibcral revolution sinee1932
has been to clllranchise the

slow. but [hat it has also been
rcdl. substantial, and durable, I
call on any candid and impartial
obserrcr to judge

[I l’rnlcssnr Nasser has any
quarrel with the liberals, it lnust
lic either in their arms or their
methods. One always has the
suspicion about the New Left that
its adherents seek not so much to
remedy injustice as to topple the

mg order so that in the
resultant scramble they may
[arm a new one with themselves
at the top What do you want to
do [or the disenfranchised,
Prolcssor Nasser?

Or, it Professor Nasser does
not object to enfranchising the
disenlranchlsed. his objection
must lie in the liberal
methodology, which essentially is
that ot persuading opponents and
the uncommitted to the necessity
of ret'orin Perhaps we have
round the real objection here, ior
Professor Nasser writes “that
some species oi revolutionary
action Is the only solution to
their lthc disenfranchised's)
plight.” The language here is
much like that which Orwell
complains about in “Politics and
and the English Language,”
are you talking about when you
say “revolutionary action,”
Protessor Nasser? Do you mean
“shooting people,” or what? You
must remember that you are
talking about a revolution of
about twenty percent or the
population against about eighty,
and you must realize that any
solution which brings such iorces
into Violent controntatlon must
needs leave the diselitranchised

tar worse oit than tney are now.
My own personal vision is or a
world in which all men are
brothers and each is tree to
achieve his own happiness in his
own way, so long only as he does
not re net the happiness oi
other . That is i believe a
liberal vision l invite you to join

were airaid; ior they had leit

ought to have done and there was
no help ior it.

And there were many abiding in
the dorm who had kept watch
over their books all night but it
availed them naught.

But some there were who rose
peacelully, [or they had prepared
themselves the way and made
straight the paths or knowledge,
And these were known as wise
burners oi the midnight oil. and
by others they were known as
“curve raisers.”

And the multitude arose and ate
at hearty breakfast, and they
came unto the appointed place
and their hearts were heavy

And they had come to pass but
