Pioneers Finish Year

W iih Title, Shut-out

This past; season has been a
year of ups and downs for the
Pioneer teams ~ ranging from
a conference champion-
ship wrestling team to a last.
place basketball squad. Plo-
neer athletes have also been
able to pick up several records
along the way including a new
tnile record by the David Theo-
philus trophy winner Jeri Lang-
ham and a new career scoring
record by Jeff Fl'antz,

Dick Lamb, Tom Lannon, and
John Lawson were named to
the all‘conference fo 0 t b a 11
team.

The crosscountry team also
finished second. Coach Young
at the beginning was not opti-
misttc bttt the harriers bent
Drake in their first dual 2234
and were on their way.

When wtnter came around.
Terry Moore started the wrest<
ling season by predicting it
would be a building year. He
built fast, though. To lettermen
Ken Strubler, Bill Barnes, Gary
Wilson, and Bob Geller he add-
ed sophomores John Sharpe.
Mike Martinson, Lou Kelley,
Rey Mendel, and Joel Richman
to make a successful dual-meet
team.

At the conference meet
Barnes started by winning at
123 and Strubler followed with
a first at 130. John Sharpe won
at 145 and Wilson finished with
a 160 triumph. Martinson took
third and Kelley second to help
the Pioneers to their first wres-
Ming championship

Unfortunately, the basketball
team fared not so Well, With
the high scorers of last year,
Jelf Frantz, Elliott Hibbs, and
Tom Hill, plus some high scor-

ing sophomores, the prospects
looked good. But. poor shooting,
defense, and rebounding
through the year brought a 1-17
conference record.

On January 29, Frantz poured
in 25 points to set the new
career scoring record. He fi-
iially enrled the season witli
1,312 points.

The swimmers also fell. With
a miniature squad, they were
able to heroically pull out a
couple of dual meet wins but
were pushed down to seventh
in the conference meet. The
highlight was Ken Adellualt's
record breaking perlormance
in the Mayan] butterfly at the
meet.

Alter four years of being con-
ference Champion, the indoor
track team slipped to fourth
in the conference meet at Clu-
cago.

The outdoor team also was
lacking in manpower. One out-
standing performer has been
Jeri Langharri who has twice set
la new Pioneer mile record,
bringing it down to 4:171

The baseball team has had
its moments but on the whole
has not been performing well.

The golf team has come
along well and has won sev~
eral meets, Leading scorers
for the team have been upper-
classmen Ted Risser, Dave
Shelienbarger, and Al Wheeler
with sophomores Bill Lee and
Russ Heuckendorli Shellenbar—
ger has also set the varsity rec-
ord with a 69,

The tennis team has been led
to several wins by Mike Green-
rield. Lij Hicks, Dick Lovell,
Jim Greenebaum, and Pete
Kollmani
