WHEN RUMORS RUN WILD ,

NEWS LEAK KILLS BOYCOTT

By NEIL FISCHER

(Editor‘s Note: In an at-
tempt to sift through the boy-
cott situation that muddled
itself together all this week.
the 5&3 Staff conducted over
sixty Interviews and spent
over fifty man-hours. Two
staffers — Joshua Sachs and
David Horwatt — deserve
credit tor a good part oi the
tollowing news analysis
which represents, the sol;
feels, an accurate account of
the events which rocked the
campus for the last few
days.)

By the time the Forum open-
ed a little after 2 pm. Sunday,
a very enticing rumor had
reached the 58:3 offices. TWO
or three ditlerent sources said
that Max Helfgott had gotten
very up-light some time over
the weekend at Toad Hall —
an oil»campus house at 1525
6th Ave. — during a discussion
of the Town vs. Negro Student
problem.

They added that Hellgott
was trying to organize a boy-
Cult of the hamlet of Grinnell
by the entire student body of
the College.

That was a rumor that de-
served some checking.

But more wasn’t any time to
do any checking.

On his way back to campus
Saturday, Helfgott — an oli-
campus senior —- showed D.
Mayer, owner of the East End
Grocery, a copy ot the plans
and asked him what he thought
0! the boycott idea.

LEFTOVER ON THE
MEAT COUNTER

The meat counter was a little
busy that day, and Moyer
said he didn’t have time to
look at the mimeographed
paper Heltgott gave him.

Hellgott went. off to class,

and Moyer left the document

out on the counter for all the.

town to read,

Prof. Alan Jones (History) —
also a member of the Grinnell
City Council — happened to see
it there above the raw ham-
burger.

The mimeographed sheet at
East End was, Helfgott said
later. “the only one then in ex-
istence — the only poster post-
ed.”

Some townspeople found out
about it and got very up—tight.
The CuiHP found out about. it
and discussed it, according to
President Ron Cogswell, for
about iive hours Sunday night;
they got very up—light. And, in
their turn, the Negro contingent
on campus found out Heligott
was serious about the boycottt,
and they got very, very up-
tight.

But by then the snowball of
rumor was going all down hill,
and everybody seemed unwill-
ing to Stop it.

LARGE GROUPS
DISCUSSING

Monday large discussion
groups Could be found scatter-
ed all around campus * in
Main lounge, in the Forum
grill, in off-campus apart-
ments, in North Younker
rooms.

Some groups were continuing
plans tor a weeklong, ”token
boycott" of the town.

Some were discussing the
necessity for and practicability
of boycotts in general. Some
were making up new, wild ru-
mars.

Others — notably groups of
Negro students »— were won-
dering if boycotts might not be
the wrong answer after all.

Meanwhile Helfgott and his
group were trying to get in-
iorrnntion to the student body
» “a most futile effort indeed
around here," he told the Si‘rB

rooms, in the Forum grill . . . Background on

Tuesday. They wrote out a list

of half a dozen instances of ag<
gression against Negro
dents by townies, made a sten-
cil, and took it over to the Col-
lege Service Bureau to have
1,200 copies run oii,

Father John Hedger and
Reverend Newell Davis, both

ministers in town, offered to'

“get the money somehow" to
ilnance the mimeographing,
according to l-lelfgott.

T00 CONTKOVERSIAL

FOR THEM

The ladies at the Service
Bureau, however, took one
look at what was Written on
Helfgott’s Stencil, decided it
was [on controversial tor them,
and told the boycott group they
couldn’t run or: copies oi
“that" without College approv-
Bl.

They sent Hellgott to Mary
G. Jones, Alumni Secretary
and head of the Service Bu-
reau operation.

She told the group the same
thing and sent them to Dean
Richard Winters. So Heltgott
and group puiied and panted
over to Burling basement only
to hear {mm the dean that the
stencil would have to have a
faculty sponsor.

The forthcoming campus ra-
dio station — represented by
oil-campus senior Eabak Ar-
majani, one of the early plan<
ners oi the boycott H oifered
to sponsor the mimeographing.

Winters said that Wasn't
any good, either.

Heligott asked Chairman of
the Faculty Joseph Wall to
sponsor it, but before Wall
could answer, Prof. Robert. Ca-
nary (English) agreed to put
his name on the Stencil as
sponsor,

PREﬂlul' PROFESTS

By MARTHA BERKEY
5&3 Special Writer

A small return on the campus
recruitment poll run in last
week’s issue of the 5&3 showed
strong approval (59 yes; 1 no)
of President beggett’s decision
to postpone the Marine recrulb
ers until the recruitment obliga<
tions oi the college had been
iurther discussed. The reason
scents obvious as only four of
the sixty people who answered
the Dow questionnaire ex-
pressed doubt that Grinnell stu-
dents would demonstrate ii Dow
rent a job recruiter to campus.

There was. however, a varie-
ty of speculations concerning
the nature of the demonstration.
Forty»three said they thought
that such demonstrations would
be peaceful while twelve said it
would be violent. A majority
thought it would be small rath-
er than large. A majority also
said that they thought the dem-
onstrations would be composed
ol students and faculty mem-
bers.

Although only 15 ol the so
said they would be uncomfort-
able with 3 Dow representative
on campus, thirty-five said they
would demonstrate against Dow.
Four said they would see the
Dow representative it he came.
None were seniors. More than
half said that the college should
not allow representatives of the
military to recruit on campus.
About the same number were
opposed to the college's allow-
ing the C.I.A. to recruit on Cam-
pus, Nine men and one woman
were interested in talking to a

military recruiter on campus
and eight were interested in
talking with a representative of
the OLA.

Thirty men and thirty women
responded to the questionnaire
and there were approximately
equal numbers from each class.
One faculty member filled out
the questionnaire, and lie in-
dicated that he would demon<
strate against Dow,

A variety of answers were
