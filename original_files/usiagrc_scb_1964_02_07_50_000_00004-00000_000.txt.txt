Golden: Entire Mock UN
is Arranged by Students

By Susan Taylor

David Golden, who will serve
as president of the General As-
sembly for this year‘s Midwest
Model United Nations Confer-
ence, emphasize?! that the con-
ference is “completely organ-
ized and run by students.“ Un-
like so many other student or—
ganizations of regional or ha»
tional’scope, MMUN does not
have any full-time employees.
All of its officers are full time
students at midwest schools,

The General Committee, this
year composed of the Grinnell
3 t u d e n t s, ,
a e l e c t s the
agenda items.
"We have to ,,
-c o m p r e s s
an October-to-
March session
into four days,"
G o 1 d e n ex-
plained Neces<
sarily, t h e n,
s o m e depar-
tures from ac-
tual Unite d GOLDEN
Nations procedures occur.

Golden explained that the or-
ganization gets some support
from the St. Louis chapter of
the American Association for
the United Nations, but the
students themselves make all
the arrangements and the de—
cisions “We’re really proud of
the fact that we run such an
excellent Conference,” Golden
said. "It proves that college
students 0 a n do something
that‘s constructive and means
ingful in an organized and ma-
ture manner.”

“We try to set up an organ-
ization to meet the United
Nations as it actually is,“ he
continued. Some of the dele-
gations ’go out of their way to
make the atmosphere more
realistic: they speak English
with an accent typical of the
country they represent; they
stage battles and play up
splits in the delegations on the
floor of the General Assem-
bly; and they give very so-
phisticated speeches.

"We have a few agenda items
that the United Nations does

not discuss,” he said‘ This is
to give the participating schools
a chance to do some Creative
work Within the philosophy and
in accordance with the record
of their country.

This year there are sixteen
agenda items. They include
such things as the admission
of Red China, disarmament,
withdrawal of A m e ri c a n
troops from South Korea,
the establishment of a perms-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nent UN armed force, the
Berlin question, the avail-
ability oi capital development
funds in the developing na-
tions, and, of special interest
to Grinnell delegation, the

noncompliance of the govern-
ment of Portugal with the
Charter of the United Nations
in its management of Portu-
guese overseas territories.

The delegations from the par-
ticipating schools may submit
resolutions on th e various
agenda items. Golden explained
that each of the five main com-
mittees considers three agenda
items and the resolutions sub-
mitted under them. Each coma
mittee reports one resolution to
be discussed by the General
Assembly, and m ay report
other resolutions to be voted
on but not discussed.

The model Security Council
will consider only one agenda
item — disarmament, Golden
said that, besides the fact that
the United Nations charter gives
the Security Council the issue
of armament control, the Gen-
eral Committee felt that this
item could he better discussed
by eleven nations than by a
hundred

Golden defined the purpose
of the Midwest Model United
Nations as “to provide educa-
tion for college students on

 

the United Nations itself -
how it Works through political
maneuvering, and the prob-
lems involved when you have

such diverse nations working
together for compromise.”

Golden himself believes that
we must support the United
Nations “as a living ideal;
something that’s here and rep-
resents a great possibility for
the future." Even though the
General Assembly, much of the
time, is a debating society, it
compels nations to confront is-
sues a nd compromise. “it
forces nations to stop shooting
and start talking,” he said. He
feels that the UN has made good
progress, especially in the eco-
nomic and medical areas.

Deeply involved with the
United Nations — as well as the
MMUN —.all of his college
career, Golden does not plan
any immediate activities relat»
ing to the world organization to
which he has devoted so much
time and effort. He plans to
spend the next few ‘years in
medical school. .

He is well prepared, however,
to serve as President of the
General Assembly at the third
annual MMUN, since he has
been active in the leadership of
the other two conferences. He
is also president of Clark Hall,
and treasurer of the Interna
tional Relations Club.

PPESTON’S

By Nancy Giomko
"Chicken wire and jigsaw
benches will highlight the set,”
said William M. Sherman,
guest designer and technical
supervisor for the coming pre—
sentation of ”Tidings Brought
to Mary,” to be given by the
drama department February
23.

Sherman, professor of dra-
ma at Bennington College,
will remain at Grinnell until
February 25 to replace, tem-
porarily, Professor Richard
Meyer as technical director.
Meyer is on sabbatical leave
at: Columbia University.
Sherman's visit is made pos-
sible by the non-resident ses-
sion at Bennington during
which time “the students go
out and find work and the fac~
ulty can do as they please.”

“in the past I have spent this
period in New York," Sherman
explained, "working on set de<
signs for modern dance produc-
tionsi"

Sherman is skilled not only
in technical vdesign'but also
in the field of art. A collec-
tion of his watercolors en-
titled “Aegean Paintings” is

now on exhibition in Main
Hall Gallery.

The paintings, all done dur-
ing Sherman’s recent six-month
stay in GreeCe, reilem a blend-
ing of ancient Greece and con-
temporary Greek living. “I was
trying to get across the pliysia
cal and emotional sharpness of
the atmosphere,” he stated,
‘fwhile at the same time retain.
ing a tranquillity throughout."

Sherman finds working with
the Grinnell Students “delighh
ful,” but because of the inter-
im session there is not as yet
much activity on the set.

When asked about the coming
production, Sherman replied,
“it’s going to be an all-metal
set. This idea should produce
very unusual results and I ad-
vise all the students to come
and See the presentation.“
