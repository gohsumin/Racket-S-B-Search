quent responsibilities: for if
too many students abuse their
privileges, the privileges will
be withdrawn not only from
'tha guilty ones, but also from
the innocent ones. For this
reason, I feel that the anger
over the South Younker case
should be directed toward the
students involved and not to-
ward-the faculty committee. In
many cases rule violations are
understandable, because it is
difficult to obey rules which
seem unjust and irrelevant to
one’s own best interests—but
tn the South Younlrei- case the
rule is, I think, just, and its
yiolation is to be condemned.
I welcome almost any at-
tempt to liberalize the social
and academic rules of the col-
lege, but would—be rule-chang»
ers must realize that they have
,‘10 rights 00 Stand on. “Justice"
is irrelevant, practically speake
ing. In requesting more privi-
leges it is necessary to show
that: 1) the recommended rule
change is for the good of the
students and everyone con-
cerned; Z) the students will ac-
cept the consequent responsi-
bilities; 3) the rule change will
not damage the reputation of
the college, and if possible, will
enhance its glory. The most im»
portant is (3), where»(l) and
(2) should be the most impor-
tant, and would be if educa-
tion rather than glory were the
primary purpose of the college.
This is my view of the situa»
tlon. I don’t like it—for the'
most part I despise it. I wish
Grinnell College were a demo-
cratic society, with a student
government having linal legis-
lative and judicial power in
student affairs, instead of the
authoritarian society that it is.
But as long as this is the way
things are, we are at least better
off if we approach problems
with a realistic attitude and
don't waste time butting our

heads against brick walls.

hampus Learns That
Time Reveals Truth,
Writes Sail Freshman

”To the Ediior:

Time, whose course clarilies
impressions, ineVltably brings
to light Truth. The campus
laughed in October, but in No-
yember your smile fell into
sorrow. Conduct probation has
sobered many. The Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs
has dealt severely but justly
with the South Younker case.
The haze has been lifted; fact is
replacing fiction on the Grin-
nell campus.

But I think a lesson has been
learned. Rules are rules are
rules. Infractions lead to punt
ishment and, I hope, re-eval—

revocable has been inflicted.

'lraie Parent'
Gets Answer

To the Editori

Having glanced at a pamph-
let in the admissions office re
cently, I discovered that the
number of native Iowans at-
tending Grinnell in 1963 was
approximately 250.

I am unaware of any radical
increase in that number this
year. Perhaps the red haze
apparently clouding the eyes of
last week’s “irate parent,” who
quoted the number as 600-700
plus, is responsible for such a
misinformed statement, as well
as for the general tone of the
letter—~one can only hope that
it was not the product or a
mind operating in its rational
state.

ident of the State Board of

ture." a theme implicit in the
