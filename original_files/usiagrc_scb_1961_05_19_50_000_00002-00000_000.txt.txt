“Group at Grinnell" '

A recent story in the Des Moines Register discuss-
ing the Fair Play for Cuba committee, under the sub-
head ”Group at Grinnell,” revealed that the Grinnell Sill-
dent Council was on the Fair Play For Cuba Committee’s
mailing list.

What the story did not go on to clairify is that there
never has been, nor is tllere presently, a Grinnell chapter
of the Fair Play for Cuba committee.

We are getting sick of trying to convince the world
that though Grinnell students were interested in all sides
of the Cuban question, the position of the committee

was one with which even sympathetic Grinnellians couldl

not completely agree. '

The sub-head “Group at Grinnell” is either so am-
biguous as to be misleading or an out and out misrepre-
sentation of fact. How many times must we clarify our
position?

The Davis-McManus Leller

Just before the American Revolution several “faith-
less” colonial malcontents, disagreeing with English foreign
policy, wrote the Declaration of Independence It was not
much later that groups of sockless, unshaven, hairy men
fought for such things as Hunt Davis’s and Craig Mc-
Manlls’s light to write letters such as the one which ap-
peared in this week’s Des Moines Register.

They laughed at long-haired Einstein, and Stevenson
was called an egg-head because he couldn’t find time to
have his shoes repaired. Messers Davis and McManus's
letter is certainly not unprecedented in the good ole’ safe
conformist tradition.

As much as we may resent one group’s attempting
to represent themselves as all of Grinnnell College, we
likewise deeply resent the Davis—McManus use of “all
Grinnell" figures that are as unverifiable as their im-
plied definition of ”beat."

Before the gentlemen from Smith go on another
letter»writing binge we would suggest that they remem-
ber that they represent a school purporting the so—callefl
liberal posture. In this light, the sort of narrow-minded

ness which their letter reflected is p llblicity of a far more,

detrimental sort than anything which has come out of that
group of “belittlers of foreign policy."

To the editor:

John Kennedy disagrees wilh
the foreign, economic and so.
cial policies of the Eisenhower
administrations. Stevenson, Rusk
and Bowles disagree with lhc
present administration’s policy
on Cuba. Richard Nixon is
presently acting as the cons
science of the Democratic party

The naivete of the purpose of
critical dissent apparenl in some
of our students surprises me.
Primarily, lhis action creates
an awareness of a problem. The
state, whether il is local. state
or nolional, is nol 2n infallible

‘ cnlily.

1f lhc southern Negro had
continued lo accept the Local
state's policy of segregation
and refused in dissent. the
moral posilivc good of the
sit.ins would have never oc-
curred.

The dissenter is the con—
scicncc of lhe state and society
and, in being such. insures
the existence of this elementary
right of the individual in a de-
mocracy.

The basic difference between
our democracy and the totalitar—
ian state is lhc right of the
minorily to exist, and if neces-
sary, lo disagree wilh lhc pow.
ers which govern them. If we
condemn lhis right. we arc no
'better than lhis political idc.
ology we so steadfastly oppose.
I would hope that we do not
fall into the false sccurily of
conformity with the belief lhal
our government’s policies
principles are infallible.

1 wish to take lhis opportunity

My second point deals wit
