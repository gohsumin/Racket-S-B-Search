and no television, so I get to
read a lot.

“I ride a bicycle to rehear-
ﬁals, and there is a road that
would take me there in half a
minute. But it is a one-way
street, so it takes me fifteen
minutes to get to rehearsals."

Kierek could have gone on
indefinitely, but he was called
to do the Lenoir scene.

Then it was time for Gaines.
He explained that the film be
ing produced would cost $25,»
000 and would run 45 minutes.

“Half the movie will be of the
Pittsburgh orchestra in Poland,
however. I was over there to
help him that.” Gaines has
done other overseas work and
is also in charge of producing
a weekly science series in Span-
ish and Portuguese for the
.USlA.

The sequence in the Fine
'Arts Center had to be filmed
several times from different
locations since there was only
one camera. This was the only
time the five‘musicians were
noticeably restless.

While this filming was going
on. a bus bringing several Phil-
harmonians to watch the Gri

nell-Carleton soccer match was
supposed to arrive from Des
Moines. Also on board were
supposed to be four string play-
ers to film a jam session with
the Lenox Quartet. Neither soc-
cer spectators n o r quarter
showed up. and Gaines, now
very behind schedule, sped up
affairs.

A meeting with selected fac-
ulty was quickly carried out in
the Fine Arts Center. This was
followed by a walk to Burling
and a brief meeting with Dean
James H. Stauss.

It was now 4:30 and the film-
ing was officially over for the
day. Everyone in the entourage
was tired but the Warsaw quin-
tet. They toured the library
and admired the permanent
art collection and the Congres-
sional documents.

Even then the day wasn’t
over. The party proceeded to
the soccer game; where Gaines
got in some unexpected filming.
The five got to see Vince Anku
kick his record-tying sixth goal
during their brief stay. Kierek

noted that this game com-
pared favorably with Euro-
pean soccer.

The day ﬁnally ended with
dinner in Cowles, Before leav-
ing, the five were given copies
of the 5&8. Kierek read the
story about the Philharmonic;
his first comment was that the
name of the composer Berlioz
had been misspelled.

The hectic day was over; the
musicians had enjoyed it im-
mensely. The only people who
didn’t go home relaxed were
Gaines and his cameramen,
who still had some difficult
scenes to shoot at the matinee
concert in Roberts Theatre the
next day.
