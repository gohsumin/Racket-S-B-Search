the ice on the Barber Plazal
rink, ‘

These men spend tour to iivc_
hours daily scraping the rrnh'
of the prcvrous night's ice chips
and spraying a fine mist of hot
water on the rink to fill in the,
nicks and gauges. ‘

The amount or water sprayed
on must, be caretully conti‘olled‘
since the optimum depth of ice

is three-quarters of an inch to add extra

an inch. Above this level the lcei
will not stay frozen.

THE RINK uses the air condl»
tioning setup of the Fine Arts
Center as its cooling system.‘
The looton air conditioner
pumps r-etrigcront cooled to 12
degrees through pipes under the
rink to keep the ice frozen,

The rink is opened when the

itemperaturc is assured oi stay-‘

ing below 40 degrees. Even be-
low timing the air conditioning

sure proper ice conditions.

"Until it gets below 14 or
15 degrees. the cooling system
must be used. This costs $1.50
an hour, so you can see how
expensive keeping the rink
irozen is,” stated Evan Wale
den, director of the physical
plant. \

The sand and tiles provide

will not settle, while the cables
insurance that the
