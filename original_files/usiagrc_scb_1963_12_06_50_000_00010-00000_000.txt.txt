Swimmers Travel lo Knox Relays Tomorrow

By Jack Harrod

The 1963-64 edition of Grin-
nell’s swimming team opens its
long season tomorrow at Gales
burg, lllinois, in the annual
Knox College Relays. The tank-
ei-s' twelverman squad will
iield relay teams in all nine
events plus a Woman entry
in diving. This meet promises
to be a good preview of Mid-
West Conference strength this
season since all but two MCAC
members Will be entered as
Well as IllinOlS' Augustana Col-
lege and Bradley University.

St. Olaf and league title far
vorite Carleton will participate
instead in the Minnesota Time
Trials.

Following the Knox Relays
the Pioneer swimmers go
against a powerful Cornell
squad at Mount Vernon on De
cember 11 in the first dual
meet of the campaign.

Coach Irwin Simone tabs
this season as a rebuilding
year. The twelve-man team
is a numerical improvement
over last year's squad but Si»
mone will still be hard
pressed to fill the 24 spots
necessary for a dual meet.
Added to this is the fact that
many of this year’s crew, al-
though promising, lack exper-
ience. Therefore, Simone
IOI'esees a Pioneer finish of

 

no higher than fourth place.
But since all members of this

season's team will return next

year, along with several good

.freshmen, the future holds in

store a good possibility of a re
turn to the llrsl~rate Grinnell
swmiming teams of the past
lew years. ’

When asked to Comment on
the conference race, for this

season, Coach Simone replied
"We're in much better shape
than last yearibut so is the
entire conference. I look for
Carleton and Beloit to have the
strength to sit on top this time.
Lawrence is coming out of the
woods and should place third.
We Will be lucky to come off
fourth, or possibly third, it
we’re very much improved.”

“Gentlemen 1 pro p o s e a

to that one institution on the

fooled some of you in thinking
that I was indicating IM’s.

It seems strange that an un-
usual number of volleyball
games result in 670 or 5-1
scores. Perhaps this year the
teams can be claSSlfied as
either good or bad. Or perhaps
some halls just don’t give a

damn, Remember gentlemen
it’s not whether you wm or lose
or even how you play the game
but rather it you play the game
at all,

The livl swimming meet is
this Saturday at 3:15 p.m, Past
years have indicated that Com
petition in the meet is very
tough. A special note to those
of you who want to impress
the fairer sex with your “big
strong beautiful bodies" the
girls are invited to come and
watch (only if they behave
themselves in the midst of all
those “men"). One last remind-
er to those of you who might
be a little out of condition, there
Wlll be a limited number of

the street is the Health Center.

 

ite again this year, The Red
men boast four
starters from last year's oham~
pionship squad: Gary Mevis,
Jack Ankerson, Jim Cahoon,
and Willie Alexander. MeVis
led the team in scoring with
19.3 points per game and An-
kerson was a close second with
17.4 per game, Cahoon is a con
sistently good player, and Al«
exander is a good rebounder.
Filling in the open starting spot
will be Dick Bennett or sopho-
more Doug Ankerson, Jack’s
younger brother,

Grinnell lost twice to Ripon
last year, in the first gam‘e by
one point and in the second by
two points. According to Coach
Piitsch, ”Just because they
are champs
panic. We only lost by a total
of three points in the two games
last year, They play Cornell
Friday night, and this year
everyone in the league will be
laying for them.

Pfisch feels that if we win 0
of the two games we will e
off to a good start. Pfitsch
says, “In this conference [here
is a tremendous home court
advantage, The team that can
win 50 per cent on the road
will take the title.” ‘

QUESTION: What do you
think of the proposal to have
face guards placed on the in-
tramural football helmets?

Vicki Crandall, Freshman—
I don't think they should, Since
Lhe referees are students, I
think it would just cause more
violations because the officials
don't call everything.

Jan Llnnell, Freshman—Fire
up for face guardsl

Ann Showaltcr, Freshman—
What are face guards?

Ton'l Fullmer, Senior—I have
no opinion,

John Phillips, FreshmaniAt
first 1 was against it, but now
I'm for it. I don’t know too
much since I’ve never had a
helmet on.

Jacquie Morgan, Freshman-
l’m for it, Fm tired of going
around with beatrup boys.

Tom Hartman, Freshman-
In Japan they don’t have face-
guards — why should We have
them here?

Steve Johnson, Sophomore——
I'm against the proposal, We
pay for the use of the infirm-
ary, why not use it?

Bob Metcall, Junior—It's a
good idea. 1M football seems to
lbe a rather vigorous sport in
which many unnecessary lnr
juries are sustained.

Lou Gotz, Junior—I’m for it.
I enjoy body contact, and i feel
that the face guards will en-
courage more of it.
