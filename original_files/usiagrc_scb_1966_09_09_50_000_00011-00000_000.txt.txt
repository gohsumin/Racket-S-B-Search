no part of the college commun-
ity can do it alone in isola-
tion tram Elle other component
parts.

I have purposefully been crlt»
lcal of the college in these
remarks, but it has not been
my intention to cry out a
jeremiad OI despair. Gn'nrlell
as a college is strong enough
and self - conﬁdent enough to
be able to criticize itself and
to grow stronger as a result
of that criticism. We have made
great progress during the past
ten years toward educational
excellence. Arthur Schlesing-
er‘s thesis that there are in the
political life of this country
cycles in which periods at
creative growth altemate with
periods of consolidation [or gains
already made can be applied
with equal appropriateness to
the life of an academic com-
munity. I feel that we are about
ready to move Into a new cy<
cle of creativity. We have an
exceedingly bright and attrac-
tive new lreshman class to join
the more sophisitl'cated, and
not, i mist, more jaded upper
classmen. We have a properly
restless faculty, and we have
a new presidential administra-
tion. All of this should mean
that there will be on the cams
pus this coming year, that kind
of discontent which the Greeks
called divine, and which I shalI
more cautiously call hopeful.
