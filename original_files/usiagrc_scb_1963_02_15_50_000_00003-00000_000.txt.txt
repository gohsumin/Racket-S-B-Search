SCARLET AND BLACK

Grabendorff sees lillle fashion;
finds few well dressed women

By Wolf Gl‘abendorﬁ

Our grandparents used to say
“Winter does not know any
iashion—it knows only warm,»
clothes!" But now we have spe—
cial boot designers and a whole,

. industry toi- ski and ‘apres-ski’l‘
fashions, iust to name the niostt
important winter tashion conti'ibr
utors

Only Griniiell seems to observe

. the same rule as in our grand—
parents' times, But this is true,
untoi-tunately, almost the year
around, so that a careful spec-
tator might come to thc conclu-;
sion that the Grinnell campus
does not know any tashionsl

After my ﬁrst week at Grin-
nell I discussed the fashion
issue with some oi my friends.
They only laughed and saidi
“Well, it you want to see nicer
ly dressed girls, you have to
go to church on Sunday!”

At the time I thought that
was a real good i but have
since discovered that it is the
pure truth, But i just can't see
why the boys should go to
church on Sunday morning just
-to see the inhabitants of south
campus’ in a civilized outﬁt.

1 really wonder it our new

more than a dozen people on
campus, most at thcin girls, who,
although not always well dress-
ed, at least desire to make a

“The boys (girls) don’t care
about onc's appearance anywayl"
Both statements sound good, but
they are wrong.

The example ot Radcliile girls,
reported in “Life,"
shows that even stralghtrA girls
can look pretty it they want to.
To run around gypsy—like is not
a sign of dcvoting all oile’s time;
to studies, but shows laziness
and carelessness,

People who think they can
stress their intellectual iion- ‘
contorinity with beards and
jeans may have their place unv ;,
der the bridges oi the Seine, ,
but here in Grinncll it looks i
much more like shtlw- sten-
tinlisni.

How about the oltcn used or

people it they really like gii si

A great task or statcci-att is
