North Campus Heads Favor Rule
Enforcement and B & G Reform

As in every campaign, the basic
Issues oi' those running tor the
presidencies oi the men’s halls
were the candidates’ characters
and capabilities. The principal
platiorm or those elected consist-
ed of more hall unity, their policy
of rule enforcement in the area of
illegal visitations, and reforming
BKzG.

The presidents at South Younker,
Cowles, Langan, and East Norris
represent in their platforms the
need for improvement in hall co-
hesion which was stressed by all.
Roger May of South Younker em-
phasized the need for the house
council to combat the hall’s apa-
thy by personally seeing that
there he more participation in
house meetings by the upperclass-
men and by seeking residents’ 0-
pinions on vital issues. The major
portion or this program, said May,
would be making tactions or the
hall work together as a unit in
hall projects.

Cowles has a similar problem
According to Rick Sprott of “too
many individuals living in singles
and not knowing' each other." He
desires it better freshman orienta-
tion program within the hall to in-
spire unity among the freshmen.
Social iunctions for which the en-
tire hall works as a unit Sprott

‘lees as another vital 'way, in
which hall cohesion may be in-
rpired. ,

According to Bob Swortwood oi
Langan, the halls must be im-
proved by means of closer relations
with the dean. The dean should be
shown that Langan students are

 

acting more maturely in respect-
ing others' rights, and that the
large ireshman class within the
hall is having a lot to do with the
change in the halls image.

In East Norris, the chief issues,
according to president-elect lay
WilliamsY “are how to improve
the hall through social and IM
programs and through g ater
participation in hell activ es.”
Most of East Norris was very con-
cerned with improving the hall
physically so that it would remain
liveabie.

Open Dorm Policy

illegal opens is a touchy issue
in every hall. Most hall presidents
have decided to abide by the non<
controversial stand at not looking
inr violations of the visitation
rule. instead they say that as
long as one individual does not
interfere with another hall resi-
dent's rights, and as long as his
girl and be are not careless or
ﬂagrant in their violation or the
rule, nothing will be done. Some,
including Ray Hom of Rawson,
wish to make residents more care-
iul it they propose to violate the
law in order to prevent the hall
from acquiring an adverse reputa-
tion. Hom hopes to keep the ad
ministration out or the hall by
making hall officials more may

‘to ﬁne violators.

For the prosecution of violators,
Bob Swortwood of Langan pro-
posed that the house council work

New AWS Board Stresses Individualism. Privacy
As Planning Stage for Next Year Gets Started

The newly elected AWS board
members have already met once
and are working in the planning
stages for next year. Some areas
that will probably be looked into
are changes in the selection and
pricing at the bookstore. an exten-
sion of the car rule, possible re-
ﬁnement of the late minutes and
locking procedure. and a key sys—
tem for South Campus. '

The ten new board members
were interviewed individually by
the 5&3 and were asked such
questions as: how do you view
the balance in a hall between pri-
vacy and participation: how much
of a role does each individual hall
play in relation to the rest of the
campus; in what areas would you
personally like to work as a mem-
ber of the AWS hoard?

Susan Sal-outs! ~ Main

"The balance between privacy
and participation depends on the
girls in the hall. I would publi-
cize everything at interest on cam-
pus and leave it at that.” Miss
Barquist thinks there are some
things, however, that cannot be
done without a minimum number
of participants, such as coffee
hours with iaculty members, and
taking trips.

Miss Barquist's main preoccupa-
tion as a board member would be
an examination and clarification
of the philosophy of the rules. She
feels that the board must know
where it is going, that it must de«
Clde whether it believes in the
rules or not. how they are going

 

Antioch to Give Contraceptives;
'Open Dorms' Subject of Survey

A policy allowing iernalc stu-
dents over 21 years of age to re-
ceive contraceptive medication or
devices without parental consent
has been adopted by Antioch Col-
lege.

The c h a n g e represents the
"maximum liberalization" which
the college health service could
undertake because of Ohio’s con-
servative state law. Students un-
der 21 must Still have parents' per-
mission to receive the medication.

The contraceptives will be pro
vided by the Antioch health ser-
vice wilh communication between
the student-patient and physician
being private and coniidei-itial, as
would be the case with any other
physician in private practice.
Women’s Hours — Open Dorms

hours will spark much interest.“

Allegheny have no hours on week—

In the number of open dorms
hours a week, 'Amlferst, a men’s
school, has 52 hours a week; An-
tioch, 54 a week; and Rochester,
20 hours a week. Most colleges
agree that there are reiorms need-
ed, but as the editor at the swarm-
more student paper wrote, “It is
very difficult—reform will proceed
as quickly as our president pleas-
es. The deans listen politely and
explain, but most of their state-
ments are to a iew students and
OK the record."

Comiiims Tutoring

For the past six weeks, 18 Cor-
nell College students have given
up one night I week to tutor un-
der-privileged children . in the
Wood Lane Area of Cedar Rap-

The project, sponsored by the
Comell Civil Rights Project and
financed by the Religious Liie

Debbie Downs-Pine Tree

“There are certain things in a
hall that are communal and de-
mand cooperation, such as quiet
hours; but social life in the dorm
should be on a purely voluntary
basis,” Miss Downs feels that
while there should be no iorced
participation there should always
be activities in which to partici-
pate.

She thinks certain things have to
he hail-oriented ~ for example,
house parties and intramural
sports~but that campus questions
should not be imposed on the in-
dividual halls other than ior gen-
eral discussion. Miss Downs con-
siders Ihe role of the senators
very important in conveying infor-
mation and bringing the consen-
sus oi the hall back to the Senate.

Cldney Dunning~Mears

Miss Dunning will first evaluate
the type or students in her hall
and provide maximum opportunity
for them to mix with each other
and participate in such things as
IM's and house parties. “It would
certainly not be a forced afiair. I
would wait and see how well the
girls responded to such uppnrtun<
ities and gradually otter more and
more. I would not invade anyone's
privacy,” said Miss Dunning. She
would like her hall to be enthusi-
astic and hopes that the girls
would be happy to ‘ re up“ for
certain activities. Miss Dunning
feels that a hall should function
in its own unity. Individual halls
cannot aitect the entire campus,
because rule changes are not in-
itiated in a hall. She feels that
the hall should primarily be in-
volved in keeping its girls togeth-
er.

of the hall, be aware of interest
and cultivate it."

Miss Edelen believes that there
must never be pressure toward par-
ticipation, but channels of coma
munication should be set up
through the House Councrl and
aaiileooards with regard to such
activities as IM'S and student:
faculty get-togethers. She thinks
that each hall has its own im-
portance because it is the home
base for a certain number at
girls. She would strive to draw
out all types of interests within
the hall.

She also said that she would like
to see the AWS board meet once
a week throughout the year with
the Dean of Women to work to-
ward a more realistic set oi rules.

Susan Monte-Conference House

Miss Monto believes that both
privacy and participation have
their place. “My primary interesl
would be privacy, but at the same
time, each girl owes certain con-
siderations to the other members
of her hall." She would work
{rpm the inside out and hope that
the compatibility ot the girls
would stir up interest. Miss Morita
believes that interest cannot be
externally imposed, and that sim-
ply being told to "fire up" will .
have no eiiect on participation in
the hall.
