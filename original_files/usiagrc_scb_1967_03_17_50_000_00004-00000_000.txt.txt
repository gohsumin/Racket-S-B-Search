of faculty, administration and
students began to work more
carefully with plans, we realized
the idea to be both unfeasible
and unworkable in the current
situation. We therefore aban-
doned the concept in reference
to the Judicial Council. We ex-
cluded administrative represent-
ation on the council for the
same reason we excluded stu-
dent government officials: we
were trying to Create a body
which could work as impartial
ly and objectively as possible
with student disciplinary prob-
lems; a group without an insti-
tution or constituency to be
responsible to, or to “repre-
sent.”

2) A second major concern
of ours in constructing the pro-
posal 7 besides trying to create
an atmosphere of objectivitye
was the tragmented, “enclave”
nature ot our campus: men stu-
dents, women students, facility,
administration. We suggested
the establishment of a com-
mittce of faculty. students and
administration to recommend

and evaluate policies for the
campus (perhaps primarily con»
cerned with student lite). This
we feel to be the proper place
for the discussion of campus
and student concerns, joining
the main elements of the resi~
dential campus — the faculty,
students, and administration7
in these discussions, This would
be the place for those concern-
ed with voicing particular in-
terests to attempt to formulate
common decisions regarding
those interests.

3) Faculty members were
suggested for both the judicial
council and the policy evaluat-
ing committee tor several rea~
sons, not merely or solely to
act as a “buffer" between the
sometimes conflictive views of
students and the administra-
tion. The school has made
significant progress this year
in working out some of the dif
ferences in opinion held by the
various element ot the campus.
However, ive still have can»
siderabie way to go in coming
to common understandings
about student life in the gene
eral and specific case. The
faculty is an element of this
campus and should be a part at
fig; creauonruf this understand-

regarting student lif .
While the facility member:
should not be seen as neces—
sarily “representing” the facili-
ty (any more than the student
Judicial Council members
should be expected to “repre-
sent" student views). their in
dwidual opinions and concerns
should be included in the at-
tempt to arrive at a generally
acceptable way of living.

I believe the proposal to be
a reasonable way of addressing
ourselves to the various prob»
lems of student life. and of ar-
riving at some general agree-
ments regarding life at Grin»
nell.

The Grinnoll REPORTER

Crosseff questioned
To the Editor:

it seems to me upon reading
Mr. John Crossett's article in
last week’s 5&1: entitled “Cum-
inunity Court" that he did not
present the tacts. but rather
had several misconceptions
about the council, its nature,
and its purpose which should
be careiully considered.

First is his application of the
term “community court.” The
originators or the ideas of the
proposed court system revita-
lizhlion have not used that term
since the proposul’s intancy,
simply because of the reason
mentioned in Mr. Crossett’s
article — the phvsical impas~
sibiiity of such a group. They
have used the term “judicial
council” since the time of that
realization # a name that is
unquestionably suitable to its
purpose and nature.

This brings me to the secs
ond misunderstanding in the
article which is bound up in
the purpose for creating a nciv
system of jurisdiction and polls
cy evaluation. l question Mr.
Crassett‘s statement, “ I would
argue that there has been no
lack of communication but
rather a lack of intellcgent in-
terpretation." Communication,
or the lack of it. is a problem
basic to all of our interactions.
The judicial council is a means
of combining the present stu~
dcnt courts with the present
FCSA. The aiudicative and
policy evaluation iunctions
would then be separated into
the judicial council and the
policy evaluation council. in
such a combination. both the
court and the evaluating coun-
cil would (in theory) bring to.
gether the opinions ot the fa-
culty and those of the students
and the administration into two
bodies, constructed to eliminate
an overlap of functions and at
the same time represent the
opinions of what today amounts
to the three “factions" on cam-
pus. In these united councils,
all the members can much more
easily communicate and inter-
act with one another than in
the present system, and can
make decisions based on their
joint opinion.

in taking the niartyi"s posi-
tion as a faculty member, in.
Crossctt was confused. again in
the factual basis for his inror
lndtiun. The proposal was pre»
sented to the Scnatc by the
student members of the present
court system; but it was con.
structed by not only those stu-
dents bnt also by Dr. Joseph
Wall and the student deans
nir. Crossett was concerned
tiiat the facultv would he
placed in a middle man between
the administration and the stu
dents. However. all the meme
bers of the council would be
equally involved with any rc-
commendations made to the

New dining facilities

working closely with the

of needs. One possibility is a
basement “Rathskeller”.

And finally, 1 don’t want to
let the question of the academic
sphere oi the campus versus
its social life, misconducts, and
punishments become any more
unclear than it is already. The
objection ot the sell, SGA, and
others has been concerning
academic punishments for so
cial misconduct. This is not to
be confused with “academic
