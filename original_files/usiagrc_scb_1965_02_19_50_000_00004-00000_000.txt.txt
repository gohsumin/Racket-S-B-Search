This famous science~fiction
adventure series, starring Bus-
ter Crabbe in peroxide—blond
curls, originated in the early
1930’s. They were first pre-
sented in serial form at neigh-
borhood movie theaters on Sat~
urday afternoons.

A new experimental course
at Beloit College, the Under-
class Common Course (UCC),
is now required of all entering
underclassmen. UCC consists
basically of freshman English
extended to three-term length
and reoriented with the arts,
science, and religion. The Be»
luit Round Table writes, “That
undelrclassmen should like the
course—though not unanimous-
ly~is perhaps the surest sign
of success. A fellow under-
classman can always be recog-
nized by the peculiar combina-
tion of books he carries: Pla-
to, Coriolanus, Walden Two, and
Sartre. It simplifies pickups at
the Student Union."

Robert M. Shelton, imperial
Wizard of the United Klans of
America (Ku Klux Klan), in 3
Cleveland television interview,
called Antioch College a “mas-
sive center of Communism in
Ohio.” In an earlier statement
issued in September, the
American Legion had called
{or Congressional investigation
of the college because “re-
peated opportunity” had been
given “known leaders of the
Communist party, U. s. A., to
propagandize students on the
Antioch College campus."

The winter quarter formal
social program at Antioch will
include ringerpaintlng parties
with paints, papers, and back-
ground music furnished by An—
tioch Community Government.
Saturday nights will feature
poety parties with candles and
“bring-your-own" poetry.

The ten schools in the Asso-
ciated Colleges of the Midwest
are engaged in a program to
recruit faculty members and
graduating seniors for Cutting-
ton College, Liberia, West Af-
rica. Dr. Christian E. W. Bak-
er, President of Cuttington, is

 

touring each of the ten schools
in the association to meet with
faculty members and interview
candidates for the program.

Three Antioch college seniors,
studying in Mexico under the
Antioch Education Abroad pro-
gram, were arrested in Laredo,
Texas, when border inspectors
lound 43 ounces of marijuana
in the spare tire of their car.
The three, who have temporar-
ily withdrawn from Antioch,
face possible fiveryear prison
terms on narcotics smuggling
charges.

Student Showe Says
Classes Too large

To the Editorl
After the initial shock of re-
suming classes subsided, I be—
came sadly aware of the tre-
mendous size of many of my
and other classes. I have been
substantially convinced of the
merits of Grinnell-type instruc-
tion (with an outstanding 11:1
student-faculty ratio) which
could provide an intimate stu-
dentefaculty relationship. I have
yet to see it, With a rather nor-
mal schedule 1 rind my classes
averaging a hectic 43 students
per meeting—larger than most
high school sessions! in view
of the facts that (1) this is sole-
ly an undergraduate institution
and (2) there exists an ample
and partially untapped faculty,
I feel that the situation dimin-
ishes the value of the class-
room meetings and that the
students deserve and desire a
closer exposure to our excep—
tional faculty. This opinion ap-
pears to prevail among the stu-
dent body, and we would wel-
come a faculty or administra»

tion comment.

POLL ERROR

The 5&3 last week mistaken-
ly reported that 552 people had
Dalton the $513 interim poll.
The number should have read
652. Also, the final tally on
question one should have read
366-275.

Administration, Faculty and Students
Have No Communication, Dillon Says

To the Editor:

Cultural and intellectual life
has blossomed this year at
Grinnell. Classes, guest lec-
tures, dramatic productions,
and concerts have all been
stimulating. There is an active
group social life; adult lead<
ership still generally displays
a moderate attitude toward our
affairs. Yet there is a sour note
in the symphony. Something is
wrong.

Students are dismissed or
placed on probation with scant
explanation. When a protest is
made at the increasing strin-
gency of discipline, those in
authority reply, “Pretty soon
we start shooting people down."
The word gets out that if one
is “heat.” he had better be-
ware. Faculty, parents, and
alumni are reported to be urg-
ing more stringent control, The
reader may say that this is
merely a mood in the air, un—
defined and poorly supported.
Yet this is the key to the prob-
lem. If some among us have
specific proposals to make, can
they not identify themselves
and speak out publicly, so their
ideas may be maturely and
reasonably discussed? This
open approach might be highly
constructive and certainly less
confusing.

Admittedly, we as students
must take responsibility for
our many mistakes. I do not
believe we are committed to a
burdensome and pharisaic in-
terpretation of all social rules,

 

but I know we are obligated to
serve the end of those codes—
buiiding a happy association
where tolerant people respect
each other. ,

Where we have failed, our
freedoms have been lost. The
emergency in Langan Hall il
an example. We all must recall,
however, that student peroga-
tives have not only been A
longtime part of our way of life,
but may be found in the earliest
Western universities of the Mid-
dle Ages. The arbitrary author-
ity of administrations is n
more recent innovation. in re-
forming our government
through the coming referen~
dum, we will be continuing a
process which is no new lad.
but is in various forms the
heritage of centuries.

The solution to our misun-
derstanding lies in the very
nature of the Grinnell experi-
ment. We have grown by a
free use of reason and a toler-
ant social milieu. We will stag-
nate by the nostalgic imposi-
tion of sterile middle class mo-
rality. Expulsions, suspensions,
and probations will miss the
mark. The youthful, spirited,
and emancipated character of
Grinnell student society would
be quickly lost if its liberal
essence were removed. Open
dialogue on policy with certain
respect for our rights is essen-
tial for us to work harmonious-
ly and creatively with the ad-
ministration.
