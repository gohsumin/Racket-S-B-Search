'War on Paveri’y' in Chicago
Seehs Awareness. Sensitiviiy

The Federal War on Poverty is
' irected in Chicago by the Chicago

ommittee on Urban Opportunity,
the CCUO. Like all Federal pro-
grams involving the amounts or
money that this one does, it is sur-
rounded by controversy

The biggest claim is that it is a

litical organization. The public

lotions man for CCUO, Peter
buel, claims, naturally, that it is
not. Duel asserts that “in the last
live or six years government has
changed from insensitive bureau-
oracy to socially aware" and that
those who charge the CCUO with
being “political" are just mad be
cause they don't have control‘

,The CCUO operates 33 different

programs and, as a general rule,
subcontracts these programs ra—
ther than doing them itself, For ex-
ample, insiezitl of operating a
school in house keeping they sub-
contract that job to another or
ganizatlon.

Tile ccuo also operates 16 naighr
borliood centers which is CCUO’S
way ot (lecenlralizing and estab-
lishing Closer contact with the peo-
ple, they are Working with.

The director of one of the Cen-
ters, the Lawndaie Center, Clar-
enoe Cash, told us that his area is
ﬁve and one half miles square
with a population oi 175.000. His
center has fifty representatives
who are selected irom the people
of the area and who Works With
them,

”Heretolore,” said Cash, “these
people had not been reached by
anyone on a dayrto-day-baSIS,”

Cash said the CCUO through the
project centers is trying to find
employment, strengthen the fam-
Ily life, improve the education, and
Improve the housing.

The project center, said Cash,
acts as a clearing house for jobs
imd training programs. “We're try-
ing to get them into job training
and trying to find out why they're
memployer,” said Cash.

l .Cash also said that while there

 

is still much racial discrimination
in employment, there has been a
“broad expansion of job oppor-
tunities in the last rive years.”

“We work on two levels,” Cash
pointed out, “We open opportuni-
ties and prepare the people for
the opportunities." . .

Most of the Negroes in the ghetto
have come north from the South
and have no skills other than
those required for work in the
fields. Even when a Negro can
find an employer who Will hire
him he often doesn’t have the
background for the job.

“After three or tour attempts a
day with nothing but failure you
give up," saiol Cash.

One of the primary reasons that
employment is so important, Cash
said, was to "get the male eme
playable so he can assume the
role of head of the household.”

“This is a matriarchal society.
Forty per cent of the families are
wtthollt males,” Cash saidr

This breaking down of family
lite is fairly deep rooted in the
North. Common law marriages,
desertion, and falling off of church
participation are among many of
the symptoms.

Along with employment, educa-
tion is the biggest area of govern.
ment activity. In Cash’s area

Another concern of the CCUO
is housing, A representative at the
downtown office said that slum
clearance involving the actual
tearing down of buildings has gone
about as far as it is needed to in
Chicago. The buildings left, he can
tended, need rehabilitation not re-

He also illdlcated that ol the 75
communities ln Chicago, 24 have
housing problems. These 24 com-
munities have a population or 545,-
009 and an annual family income
of $3,000.

Cash indicated that the real
estate people are the biggest prob-
lem to the establishment of fair
housing because they refuse to sell
a negro a house in a white neigh-
borllood.

it was also pointed out by ale
most everyone that the public
housing projects were invariably
built in Negro neighborhoods thus
maintaining the segregated hous-
ing patterns.

The ills of this pattern of housing
are obvious — the schools remaln
segregated, whites and Negroes re-
main ignorant of one another, and
owners of the homes tend to lose
interest in maintaining the homes
when there are Negroes liVlng in
them,
