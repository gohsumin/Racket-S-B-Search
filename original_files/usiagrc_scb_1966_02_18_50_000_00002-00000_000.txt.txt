Romping Backwards

In case you missed it in your haste to turn to the:
editorial page, 1 refer you to the Senate story on page

one,

If this proposal is being presented in any serious-
ness I think it is one of the most ill-conceived and out-
oi-step actions that the AWS Board could possibly pre-
sent. I refer not to the body of the proposal but rather
the ”final comment,” the rider to the bill.

While everyone else who is concerned about wom-
en’s hours talks in terms of liberalizing them, extend-
ing them, or even (God save us) eliminating them, the
AWS Board seems to be romping backwards in an at-
tempt to make a bad rule worse. The AWS Board is
right when it says that its little rule will “culminate in
more uniform and stringent penalties for lateness.”

I suggest that right now is the time for students
who give passing service to the cause of more liberal
women’s hours to go to their Senator’s room and have

a short chat with him. A

very short chat: Vote no

against the AWS Board’s rider. Vote yes for the 15!

minutes of “grace."

 

Amherst Drops Junior
Who Didn't Take PE

Amherst College has dismissed a
junior, Andrew Plnkowilz. ior iaii
me to meet his physical education
requirement. The administration
decided upon this action alter Pili~
kotvitz told the dean that he had
no intention oi fiiliilling his gym
obligation.

Pinkowiiz had already been dis-
missed alter his freshman year
for tailing four subjects, but he
had been readmitted after studying
a year in a New York college.
When he returned as a sophomore
for the second term of last year,
he was placed on academic pro-
bation. Pinkowitz had three Se
meslei's of gym left to iiiltili a
that lilne, and he received credit
for one of those semesters that

spring.

In the first hall ot his junior'

year Pinkowltz did not attend
gym classes and consequently re-
ceived a letter from the dean in-
forming him that he might be sus-
pended for negligence, He signed

up for gym the next semester but-

after attending a week found that
it cut into his studies too milCl'L
(Pinkowitz had raised his accum-
ulative average lrom 53 to 83,)
Since he was not attending gym
classes, Pinkowilz was dismissed
from Amherst. The administra-
tion gave as the reason ior dis-

 

missal the Student’s failure to
meet the physical education re»
ouii-ement even though taculty
members had urged consideration
of the individual case apart from
rules involvedt students and faculty
at Amherst are outraged at the
expulsion with numerous student
groups and professors appealing
the decision.

“To make clear to the world
that we are not all insane,” was
the reason given by Amherst stun

dents as to wily they marched llli
protest against resumption of
ombing in Vict Nam, Onerliundl‘ed
and Seveuiyriive students from
Amherst and Smith marched int,
Northampton. Massachusetts, two-i
weeks ago. Many oi the marchers
were participating tor the iirst
lime in a public demonstration.

The students marched down the
main street and then held a meeir
lug in a Unitarian Church. They
were unable to get into the city
hall where the meeting was first
scheduled because seventy - live
counter - demonstrators blocked
the entrance Order was kept by
the demonstrators despite taunts
and ridicule by the hecklers car-
rying signs such as “Kill tlie_
Commles.”

SCARLET AND BLACK

The "Grudge Pot

(Nole: Today's World is full of
naked brutality, unscrutabie pain,
and blinding ignorance, and the
only way to escape it all is
th r o u g h airy, inconsequential
ilights oi fantasy. Toward this end,
I present the following romantic
fairy [alkin two parts:

Minnie and the Dozen Dwaris.

A small castle overlooking the
Rhine and a beach-house on the
Riviera. Minnie Twerp often
dreamed of such wonders as she
lay in a puddle in the damp, dark
basement of her cruel step-moth-
er's broken-down (disapproved by
Duncan Hines) castle buried deep
in the shadows of the Black For»
est.

Minnie was a simple lass and
carried the burden or her royal
birth with courage, if not nobil-
ity. Her dire step-mother had
murdered her mother and married
her father and murdered her fath-
er and thrown her in the cellar
with the rest of the junk, but Min-
nie rwcrp always wore a happy
smile.

in keeping with a long family
tradition, Minnie loved mirrors.
The basement was full of them,
and she would whirl about from
one to another like a dmnken bal-

 

lerlna and flash her pretty smile
and laugh, “Mirror, mirror on the
wall, who's the fairest of them
all?”

“I am, Shorty." the mirrors in-
variably replied as she twirled a-
way still gayly smiling, How could
she deny it? Each mirror looked
exactly like her,

Minnie had a problem—several
problems, in fact, When she had
been born, three peals oi thunder
preceded three streaks of light-
ning that struck her father’s origi-
nal palace on each of its three
towers, burning the whole place to
the ground in the grandest blaze
that the peasants had ever wit-
nessed Naturally, everyone knew
that such an amen meant that
Minnie someday would marry a
handsome prince in 3 Walt ois-
my movie and make her fortune
new

But Minnie at the age of 17 was
only six inches tall. Fate, which
tricks and begulles us all, made
her a hill-sized adult at birth, and
she had been shrinking steadily ev-
er since. She had been the most
popular kid in the neighborhood,
the leader of the sandbox set, a
femme fatale even before her
Oedipal contlicts had begun.

Friday, February is. not

She and her smile had been me
delight of society, and now both
were disappearing. Soon, she
knew, she would thin to a vapor
and her wicked step-mother ruth-
lessly would command the friendly
mirrors. “Mirrors! Mirrors on the
floor: Am i not the greatest
hour? A sickening, loathsome so—
cial slug, I disgust with mouth and
mug!"

Minnie threw herself on I
matchbox and wept. She remem-
bered the days when she still had
freedom and had circled the near-
by ponds. kissing irogr in hope
that one might be a prince. Lato—
ly, she had even kissed the Cock-
roaches in the basement, but mi (-
lessly. The inevitable clasp oi timo
soon would snatch her.

Escape, To run, to hide, per-
chance to live, that was the only
answer. The doors and Windows
were fast shut, and a dirty mouse-
hole was her lone exit. “Good-bye,
sweet mirrors," she said with I
sad smile. “Take care”

"Goodbye, shorty," they re-
plied, and she disappeared into the
dark tunnel,

Grinnell Campus Again
Seen lacking Freedom

To the Ediior:

As we are all aware. this is the
week of announcements of candir
(lacy for the SGA Presidency. As

l in years past, the basic issues are

again those concerned with rule
changes. This year I for one have
come to recognize for the ﬁrst
time an unjust state oi affairs
which exists Within the realm of
student rules. it is only natural
that Gi‘iunell students, like our
compatriots across the country,
should desire io undergo our col-
lege experience in a real-life al-
mosphere, Thai is to say, here at
Grinnell we do not experience
real life because we are cloistered
imnl it, and that is good to some
extent. But what better way to
prep re us to assume the respon-
sibilities of society, or more spe-
clilcally to allow us to determine
a responsible personal morality,

, than to grant us some of that [631‘

ity during our Grinnell experi
ence? How does one assume
responsibility? I! it is a charac-
teristic which is inherent in our
personalities, and has only to be
awakened at some mysiel'iOHS mo-
ment ill our development, then i
have grossly misjudged its nan
ture; for l have always recog-
nized it as an attribute of matur-
ily, which is itself necessarily a

‘ piodiict of experience. Obviously.

I think, the only way in which one
can obtain experience is by en-
countering some of the realities at
life “outside." and it seems equal-
1y obvious that sheltering us from
them will never develop a true
sense of responsibility, only an ar-
tificial one at best. Tliemiﬂre we

 

make periodic noises through the
appropriate channels expressing
our desires in that direction, at

which times we are invariably h-r

formed by our student l‘epresenlnr
(iVes that it would not be “pru-
dent" to make such requests at
the present time. And should the

‘occaslon cvel’ arise that silch re-

quests might actually reach re-
sponsible ours, We are, after what
I aln sure is careful c0u51deraii0n,
usually turned down. Why? in all
honesty. it must be admitted that
the administration has every right
lo deny us any change, even any
consideration oi our proposals, for
after all it does have sole opera.
tion rights on the college, son
notwithstanding. or course we all
know too that there are trustees
and various contributing alumni
who necessarily sway our admin-
tralion's decisions, and I am sure
we are equally aware of the gen-
uine validity and signitlcancc at
such considerations. Nevertheless,
l think the administration owes to
the Students of Gi'iuuell some re-
sponsibility toward our desires, iii-
deed our needs in this area. For
it is utter all to a large extent
the students themselves who de-
termine the spirit and image of
the college, and i do not use this
as any kind of a threat But neither
do I believe that this college is
set up as some monstrous game
In which the administration et uli
merely manipulate the students to
their own ends. I was under the
impression that Grinnell's purpose
was to give us an education, and
not me~ ly an academic one, and
