Secondly, I would like to empha-

changes in our condition; what we
most certainly don't want is tor
this college to be thrown com-

it has been pointed out in thc‘

for those women over twentyrone
and a junior car rule similar to
that enjoyed by seniors. As moth-
er tasks that must be perinrmed
by the senate, Kent is “not satis»
tied that students have been as
effectively utilized in admissions
work as they could he," he hopes
for a change in policy towards
students, use of college vehicles
[or “its just about impossible to
line up a college wagon tor a week
end and the college bus is an
abomination,” and he things that
“parts or the Forum particularly
the Carlee House could be better
utilized than at present."

The North Campus problem is
complex, but says Kent, “1 do not

see how any proposed change in
the hall system except perhaps in-
tegrated North and South cam-

puses would Improve this problem

North Campus Problem has nev-
er been clearly defined." He he-
lieves there should be closer in-

ships out that the “money cur-
rently paid out tor the resident
program could be better spent.”

In his speech Monday Kent de-
clared, “Alone the SGA Presiden-
cy is nothing—an exercise in frus-
tration. But with an active and
enthusiastic Student base it can
provide leadership and direction
tor the accomplishment oi great

he thinks that the degree of ap-

the student government will not
reoccur. Much or this apathy, says
Kent, “was a result of the trouble
and dispute which took place
when the senate underwent u
change in structure two years ago.
The campaign or only one candl-
date last year tor the SGA Pres-
idency showed how much the dis—
