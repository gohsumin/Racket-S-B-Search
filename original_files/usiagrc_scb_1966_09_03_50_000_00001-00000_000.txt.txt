Success Story of F armor 8&8 Editor

BOB HODlERNE, tonne. 5&3 editor. interviews a resident oi
Chicago's west side. Hodieine is now a war photographer in

Viei Nam.

Ed. notet The following report
was written by Henry Wilhelm
'68, a close friend of tanner
5&3 editor Bob Hodierne. Hi)-
diei-ne is now a war photograph-
er in Viet Nam.

By Henry Wilhelm

"We were walking across this
big open area (much like a valley
between mountains or jungle) and
from quite a ways up ahead two
machine guns (30 cal.) opened up
on us. The land we were on was
sloping up to a plateau where the
machine guns were and they were
quite distant from us. So the bul-
lets couldn’t get low enough

The above was taken from a
letter by Bob Hodierne, former

5&3 editor, who has temporarily
quit school to work as a war
photographer in Viet Nam. Short-
ly alter the conclusion of last sea
mester. Hudieme sold some stock
to buy a one way plane ticket,
told his parents that he was “go
mg to travel around," bought two
Nikon F cameras, and left for Sai-
gon by way or Hong Kong.

When he arrived in Hung Kong
he found that he could not be in
Viet Nam for longer than seven
days since at the time he was not
accredited by any “responsible
news organization." But he went
on anyway in the hope that he
would find someone to accredit
him otter he got there.

Hodierne wrote: “1' got to Sai-

gon late Monday night and went
to the UPI oﬂice ﬁrst thing Tues~
day morning. They were pleased
as hell to see me. They got me ac<
credited at once, are taking care
or my visa and have provided me
a place to stay. They also provide
me with all the lilm I can 1159.

New Dean Discusses Grinnell

By Ann Kirschner

Mrs. Alice Low, Grinnell's new
dean Ol’ women, is more interest-

ed in establishing a philosophy oil

living for the residence halls than
in putting emphasis on rules.

Mrs. Low teels that college stile
dents should continue to assume a
great deal of responsibility with-
in the hall system. however, she
also said in all interview last week
with an 5&3 Writer, “You cannot
put 500 girls in the Quad and not
have rules. There are some people
who might olherwise iniringe on
the freedom of others." Mrs. Low
said that a rule should be put into
ettect it a situation logically re-
quires it and if it also makes
sense in a longer-snge view.

Greater studenlrfaculty commu-
nication outside the classroom is
one of Mrs. LnW's main concerns.
Many or the taculty expressed in
terest last spring in having more
informal discussions with students.
Mrs. Low said, “This is a two-Way
street, but students must take the
initiatiVE.” She would like to see
groups of students interested in
having a particular discussion in-
Vlte professors to the hall lounges.
Mrs. Low feels that it is not the
number of Students involved that
would determine the success of
such a meeting, but how meaning-
iul it was to those who participat-
ed. She hopes that the discussions
will become more informal.

Mrs. Low has taken a special int
terest in the availability at more
academic and personal counseling.
Aside from the professional ser-
vices oiiered to students, Mrs.
Low will be meeting with the Bat-
tleboards to better prepare them
to deal with the problems they
might encounter in their capacity
of advisors.

in response to feelings expressed
last year by students about how
ing at greater say in determining
the curriculum, Mrs. Low feels

that the administration should be
‘willing to listen to suggestions and
iparticipate in profitable diSCIlS<
‘Sions. She Said that the students
must realize that Wllile they will
not be able to make the final de-
cisions, the administration should
be very interested in working
closely with them to determine the
feasibility of instituting courses
where interest has been shown and
also for explaining why certain
courses may not be given,

Mrs. Low was dean of women
tor the past six years at Central
Washington State College, Elicns-
berg, Washington. where she re-
ceived her master's degree. She
was an undergraduate at Eastern
Washington State College.

The “great parking lot contron
Versy" which stirred campus con-
cern last spring appears to be
solved.

in an interview with an 5&3
writer earlier this week President
Leggett said, “We're committed
to the idea that it we have park.
ing lots they will be on the cam-
pus ner. “l'v.” : ' would
not disturb campus greenery.

Leggett said he plans to ride a
bicycle this year and expressed
the hope that [acuity and stair
members would follow his exam-
ple in an eliort to mlieve the shorts
age at parking space.

The controversy arose last
spring when 3&6 employees be-
gan construction or a parking lot
in the grassy area across the railr
road tracks 1mm Burling Librarv.
A group or students protested the
action and staged a sitdown strike
on the construction site. The con-
troversy we : unsettled when
school ended,

Credit-Fail Comesl'o Grinnell:
New Faculty Joins Old Guard

Accompanying the new laces on

innovation [or Grinnell, the credit-
iail grading system, Any Sopho-

one course each semester under

the conventional numerical grades
in the elected courses. It the
grade is “credit" it will not be in-
