SCARLET AND ILAOK

Friday. September IE, ”57

 

IN THE BEGINNING . . .

Last December set the preo-
Odent, and now both the ad-
ministration and the student
body are reaping the results
of the turmoil which that in-
conclusive battle created. “Now
we must try again," is the
cry; challenge the stains quo;
go to the extreme to get re-
sults, action over reason, not
for the sake at, or in the ser-
vice of reason, but for the sake
of action itself. What is the
cause of this annual battle-cry?
What is the end in View? What
are the real motivations for so
aciing? Pleinly not everyone
feels exactly the some way, or
has the same end in view, but
at the same time. a large num-
ber of people are willing to par-
ticipate In a common action, or
common means to diverse ends,
How can this be?

The first confusion that must
he noted is one having to do
With ends, or what those peo-
ple who have originated the
controversy really want. That
is, are the ends which are
sought broadbased enough to
warrant such overt action, or are
they really too miniscule to
be allowed to assume the
proportions of principles
Worth fighting for? This
‘l‘Iistlncthn must be realized he-
tore any action whatsoever can
be taken The problem is that
too many activists are crying
for a change not in the form
of principles (from which rules
are derived) but are starting at
the wrong end with rules and
then trying to develop princi-
ples. This confusion can be
clariiied by asking, “What is
the longstange goal of any re-
iorm: principles on which to
set up rules which will then be
longrlasting. or the rules them-
selves?" The answer is an 0b-
.vious one, of course: one should
seek first for the principles and
then derive the rule from the
principle. This is the only log.
ical way of maintaining any
continuity in a community or
any sort.

But it, on the other hand,
one is led by a small number
of pseudwrational activists who

narrow point oi view, the only
result is e derensive and very
likely overt reaction on the
part of the party whose prin-
ciples or lack of principles are
challenged. To be blinded by
the emotion of the ‘ceuse', and
not to perceive the narmwness
of the aim ultimately leads to
a kind of selfrdestructiarl.

Again, though, what is the
reason that this type of thing
happens over and over again?
Is it because students are in
actuality irrao‘onal. or narrow-
m i n d e d, or overly-emotional
cause-seekers? Fortunately this
is not the case. But rather, un-
iortunatcly. the cause is larger
than this and stems from a
problem which is not as easy
to perceive. The problem is one
or a confusion on the part of
those who actually do deter-
mine the principles by which we
live on this campus; and from
which indeterminate principles
the rules are derived. The con
fusion boils down to the inabil-
ity to determine whether the
principles or this college are
ethical or political. And it one
or the other, what kind of eth-
ical or political posture is cor-
rect. The fact is that ethics
and politics are not necessar<
ily mutually exclusive. and that
in use this distinction as a
basis tor iustitying conilicting
decisions or viewpoints is only
rationalization and another in-
dication of the ambivalence of
attitude and belief an the part
of the administration, What is
the goal of this college any
way? To create happiness for
all of the Students equally, or
just tor the greatest number
possible? The problem is that
principle-making resolves itself
into an old and very diiicult

philosophical problem: equall-
tarian ethics vs. utilitarian eth-
ics. That is, should principles
and then rules be set,up for
the sake of each individual
equally, or for the sake of the
greatest happiness or the great-
est number? The vacillation of
the administration IS, on this
whole, an indication that no de<
cisiun has ever been reached
concerning this dilemma. In a
sense, the attitude M the stu-
dent body is justified when put
into the light of the adminis-
tration’s indeterminacy, An ex-
ample of the result of this is
last December‘s debate con-
cerning ‘ilexible policy: Now
this phrase is a contradiction
in itself. (or a policy is a set
or determined principles and as
such is not tlexible. The prob»
lems which arose last fall were
not the result of policy, but of
a type or amoebic flexibility,

What is needed then? Per
haps the iirst thing to do is
to call for a statement of actual
policy or principles on the part
of the administration with re-
spect to the desires of the stu-
dent body evidenced by certain
recent activities; then it will be
possible to formulate rules in
line With these principles, and
it will be easier to judge when
and ii a principle is violated.
The next step is for the student
body either collectively or
through their representatives to
decide whether these principles
are “good" or “bad" and in
the presence or the administra-
tion. On that basis then lustb
iiable action can be taken. But
let us not be so blind and ir-
rational as to continue a pro-
cess which has led and will
continue to lead only to more
and more conluswli, and on
such a narrow basis as that of
rules. Let us be aware of and
seek for principles.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Nei Fischer

II' Walls at Gdnneil could speak, they wouldn't. They’d
scream. . . .

And they do, some at them. especially on North Campus.
Smith l-lall walls are, in tact, among the most loquacious, fluent,
dependable, resourceful, and coherent walls I have ever seen . . .
or is it heard?

The fellow who put them up must have added a little extra
something in the mortar because — unlike most students who
dwell inside college walls — they Stand up for something.

The ﬁrst piece of graffiti I noticed was a quote from. i think,
Alice in Wonderland: “‘THE TIME HAS COME,’ THE WALRUS
SAID, ‘TO DO AWAY WITH CHILDISI'I THINGS.’ ” “Fire up {or
opens!” was penciled in by a later author at the bottom.

Then they got better: “I'M HOMOSEXUALI A VICTIM OF
MY ENVIRONMENT." I always did wonder why such a protec~
tive, conscientious college still allowed boys In other boys' room:
late at night.

“I'M HETRO-SEXUAL (le) , . , HOW ABOUT YOU?" Well.
I couldn't say. You see, I've been here a couple or years and . , .

One graffiti) was an alleged Smith interview with the deans.
The summation: “The bastion of liberalism took a beating Imm
a seige oi conservatism . . . Please do not approach your illus<
trious hall president for a while; he is in deep meditation over the
fate of SGA.”

I'll bet you some ones there are who do not love that wall.

How about “SMITH IS READY . . . ARE YOU?" or “SMITH
HALL STANDS FIRM AS EVER.” I'm sure the building does, any<
way.

One last example. particularly interesting (and thet'eiote radi-
cal): “WE WILL NOT SETTLE FOR HALF-A-LOAF! RAZE THE
OLD REGIME TO THE GROUND!!!"

But please, guys, it you do. leave the walls. Stone walls do not
necessarily a monastery make, And anyway I believe in “Fon-
tastick” miracles: “Remember. you must always leave the wall."

I encourage administrators who Want to know What other
students are thinking to read the walls daily and not my column.

Some walls, of course, are less radical (and thereiore less in‘
teresting) than others. The one inside the Langan doorway. for
example, just exhibits a note telling tieshmen they can get new
light bulbs from the maid, It is so easy to be enlightened at Grilk
hell.

The top Iwo floors or Boiling Library have walls of booksi‘
walls in Burling basement ere notably devoid of utterances.

Other walls lecture quietly on American constitutional history
in ARI-I.

Walls are weighty matter to think over, and I must admit I'm
a little bewildered while writing this Column. Last week, you
know, all i iliouglit l was doing was quoting a few administrators
— in context for a change. A faculty member labelled that column
“a tantrum,”

When 1 urged the student body to act in its own behalt, at
least one administrator implied I was a “Iascist.”

So this week I thought I’d just write about brick walls, I hope
you all write in aild call me a Mason.
