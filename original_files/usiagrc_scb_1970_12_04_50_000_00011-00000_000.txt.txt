Aqua Jocks In Tune-up

Bulletin: On November 27,
the Grinnell College Aqua
jocks divided and competed.
The outcome was:J. Roilie's
Trees 58, Mike Haley's
Beaks 45.

Winners were: the Beak in
the 160 IM and 100 yard br-
eaststroke, Gabby Ward in
the 60 yard freestyle in which
he was only .4 ofa secondoff
the pool and school record.
Hulk Dale was the pinnacle
performer in the 100 fly
event and Swacko Swa ckham»

stroke event. The Tree's
Medley relay was victorious
as Flecky, Gibby, Hulk and
Curls intimidated their op-
ponents. The infamous Dan
Weiss won the 200 and 500
free, but alas was the pri-
mary reason the Tree's 400
free relay won as he false-
started twice. His response
was that it felt good so . . .
The crowd was tremendous
until sitedown started and
then the Tree girls left and
Mrs. Ohermlller remained
aloof and unbiased. Thusly
interpreted, your presence
will be welcome at the swim
meet December fifty at 1:30
p.m. against Coe, Loras,
and the UNI Panthers.

Swimmers Shoot For second-Title

The goal this year for the
swim team is championship
No. 2 in a row. Being last
year's only Grinnell Confer-
ence Team Champion, the
team has to overcome the
same problem this year, the
pool. Practicing in the "big
bathtub" is certainly no plea-
sure, but as Coach Obermil-
lei: puts it, ”You should see
the looks on the other teams'
faces." The team, not quite
the harassing power of last
year, may have an uphill spe
lash in its pursuits.

The aqua jocks are led down
rhe lanes by “Beak" Daley,
'1]. Rollie" Rollins, and head
chearleader, “Crabby" Ward.

Wrestlers

The male diet association of
Grinnell, sometimes Icnownas
the wrestling team, opens its
70- 71 campaign on a more
optimistic note than they ended
last season. The reason ap-
pears to be twofold, exper—
ience and numbers. Coach
"Moe" Hunt is rather enthu-
siastic at the prospects ofthis
season, in that he will have
five grapplers with collegiate
experience on the team. Also
on the roster are many fresh-
men (preps) who have know-

Other seniors, besides Rol-
line, on the squad, are ”Swa-
cky" Swackhamer, "Hulk"
Dale, and "Alice" Kaufman.
Important underclassmen fro
om last year’s teamare "Sur-
fer" Bramer, "Freak"Free*
burg, and Sheena Brown's lit-
tle brother Bob. Prep power
is supplied by, yes folks, an-
other Williams (Mark), Dan
Weiss, “Bums" Fleckenc
stein, "Pontoon" Huntoon,
and “Curls" Rosenfeld. Th-
ere are many Others but
they're anonymous as all the
preps look the same - weird!

Losses from lastyear‘s team
did hurt the squad in depth,
but not in glitter. It is thought

‘that five seniors graduated.
One sophomore went off to the
promised land, because of his
roommate and his snakes. And
a prep, who was built like a
lumberjack, was enticed to IU
as our pool wasnot bigenough,
and his girlfriend was at IU
(minor point).

This year’s squad will host
the Pioneer Relays, an annual
event next year, on Dec. 5 at
1:30. UNI, Coe, and Loraswill
be there if the pool still is at
that time. Highlights of the
meet will include the invom-
tlon by Gabby, Hulk and his
T- shirt, and Mrs. (bermiller
escorted by Irving Glick.

Hope To Win A Few

ledge of this sport of refined
mauling.

There are fifteen men on the
lists, Which doubles last
year’s total of eight (almost
doubles7). Really, the fact shr
ould be that it quadrupled,
since Grinnell wouldbe behind
25-0 before the meet started,
as most of Grinnell's oppon-
ents faced only four men, with
the other weight classes being
forfeited. But the gods have
smiled on well liked “Jogger"
Hunt, and he may be able to
fill all positions except the
158 and 177 pound uniforms.
Anyone who weighs in the in—
dicated regions and likes down
to earth associations is we]-
come.

The team is led by co-cap-
mins "Mr. Football”, Wash-
ington Alston and Mrs. Bra
own's son, "Mouse". A re—
tumee after a layoff of a year
in Costa Rica is 01' "Emphy-
sema Steve" Hutchings. A
surprise is that Coach Hunt
has a heavy heavyweight in
Big Barry Huff. A letterman
dominates the lightweights
(118 lbs.) in the form of Ted
Weckel, Loose Hall's pride
and joy.
