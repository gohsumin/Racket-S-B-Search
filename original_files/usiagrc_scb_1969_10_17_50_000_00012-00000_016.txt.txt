Jeff Jones (left) is subdued by police officers
at the corner of Madison and LaSalle. Jones had

attacked an undercover policeman (above) as the
march turned the corner. Still fighting, Jones
was removed from the area by four officers. At
the time the picture at left was taken, Jones had
just been sprayed with MACE. Note empty holder
on officers left hip.
