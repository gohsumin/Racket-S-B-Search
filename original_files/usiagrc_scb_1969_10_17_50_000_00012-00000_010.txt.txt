Leaders also said that those who
broke through the lines Wednesday night
were showing "exemplary action" and
had been expecting that others would
follow.

The leaders spent considerable time
discussing the entire concept of re—
volutionary struggle in America. The
goal of the national action, they said,
was to "build a red army, to show that
white kids are really ready to fight."

"We showed them that Wednesday night.
It was like unfurling a gigantic Viet
Cong flag in the heart of Chicago."
The important goal of the action, said
one leader, was to "establish our pre—
sence in the nation's mind."

In fighting a war, said a member of
the Weather Bureau, one must "think in
terms of losses." The losses in battle
are expected to be balanced by politi—
cal gains.

Wednesday night definitely raised
the level of struggle in America,
the leadership maintained. It was the
first time vhite students had been the
agressors. It was a demonstration that
the group was "out to win."

Leaders felt that all previous move—
ments had failed in their attempts to
build a revolutionary movement. Said
one person, "We are the most pro—
gressive group in the country." He
went on to say that because of the
Weathermen's progressive nature, they
had few models to follow. Thus,
actions had to be experimental. It >
was pointed out that there had never
before been a revolution in the
"mother country of imperialism."

The Women's Militia march was con-
sidered as one such experimental act—
ion. ”Although the affair was a military
defeat, many of the marchers confessing
that they felt humiliated, the group
belieVed the march, in total, was a
success. Both political and tactical
gains were cited.

The Weathermen felt that the mere
fact that women armed themselved and
attacked police was a significant ad-
vance. Newspaper headlines of "SDS
Women Fight Police" would establish
the presence of a women's fighting
force, armed and ready to participate
in reVolutionary struggle. This ful-
filled both the goals of "estab—
lishing presence" and "raising the
level of struggle." It was also
possible to observe how police func—
tioned in that kind of situation.

The significant changes in operational
procedure from the Democratic Conven—
tion, for example, were important.

It was also observed, however, that
the_fact that only a small number of
women demonstrators followed the leader
ship into the police line indicated
again the need to more adequately
prepare individuals for confrontations.

_ "You.have to completely understand the
political reasons for your actions be;
fore you ever go into the street," said
‘one Weatherman. “If you don't know
_exactly what you have to do and why,
you shouldn‘t be there.“

The Weathermen extensively dis—
cussed the concept of "(white skin
privilege." They felt that most
people in America would never fight

on the side of revolution, as they
were not oppressed by the conditions
felt elsewhere in the world. This
situation was contrasted with the pos—
ition of a Vietnamese, who experiences
American oppression on a day to day
basis.

One leader said that for this rea—
son, mass support of the Weatherman
action must be discounted. ”Most
people will be turned off, you have
to expect that. They are going to be
fighting on the side of pigs if they
ever fight at all."

Therefore, the group abandoned most
efforts to appeal to the working class,
a traditional source of revolutionary
support. The working class, too, it
was contended, can exit under their
white skin privilege and do not have to
suffer the oppression levelled against
black, brown, and yellow peoples.

Similarly, most college students were
discounted in another departure from
traditional revolutionary strategy.

The college students were seen as too
secure in their present position to
be willing to "lay their lives on the
line" for the cause of revolution.

The basis of appeal must be directed
toward the "alienated youth culture,

pgrticularl working class youth."
om among he youth who are not yet

part of the system and who are totally
alienated by it must be drawn the fight—
ing force. From this segment of the
population the Weathermen hoped to find
youths committed to "smashing the state"
so that "we can build something better
in its place."

The meeting finally turned to a
discussion of activities for the re—
mainder of the national action. Lead—
ers announced that the demonstrations
at high schools, originally scheduled
for Thursday afternoon and postponed
until Friday, were to be called off
entirely. Heavy losses at the high
schools, which were to be guarded by
hundreds of police, would prevent the
group from being at full strength for
the Saturday march, the Weather Bureau
said.

'Demonstrators were encouraged to go
into the city on Friday in groups of
2 or 3 and "scout out" the march
route in order to be thoroughly fam—
iliar with the area. Wall posters
were also being printed which the group
was to paste up Friday night.

As the meeting closed, it was
emphasized that "nobody should consider
tomorrow a day off." "We‘re going to
win by not thinking of losing!"

Seminary officials objected to the
radicals meeting. They had previously
made arrangements for about 30 SDS
members to stay in the seminary during
the national action in an effort to
"keep them off the streets at night."

John Morin, president of the Garret
Student Association said, "We accept
full responsibility for their presence.
We affirm their right to be here. We
believe that fundamental change in
American society is necessary. However,
that does not mean we believe that all
the tactics Currently used by SDS con—

SDS refused to confer with school
officials, but spent the six hours
during the meeting negotiating with
a committee of students. The SDS mem—
bers refused to allow Garret students
into the meeting and frisked all stud—
ents who entered the building.

Garrett President Orville H. McKay
said, "We thought we could make some
contribution, so that they wouldn't
have to sleep in the streets and avoid
confrontations m’ the police." The
Garrett Dean of Students said ”they
have violated all agreements with us."

When the meeting concluded, shortly
after 2 a.m.rall but thirty students
left the seminary. Arrangements were
made to house the students at churches

in the Evanston area.

The only activity scheduled for Fri
day was a rally at the Cook County Hos
pital called by the REM—II group. The
rally was intended to protest the "in—
humane practices of County Hospital"
and particularly discrimination agains
women and low imcome patients.

As demonstrators arrived, they foun-
the front of the hospital guarded by
17 policemen in riot gear. Although
a light rain had falled throughout the

“morning and continued throughout the

rally, over LOO attended the rally.

The demonstrators gathered in a sma
park across the street from the hospit
where large banners were displayed
reading "Community and Worker Control
of Hospitals" and "support Black Pan—
ther Free Medical Clinic and Young
Lords Day Car Center." About 50
policemen formed a cordon about the
park and a squad of 100 officers was
held in readiness on the sidewalk.

The rally was joined by over 50
workers and staff members from the
hospital, distinguishable in their
white uniforms.

The rally was opened by a woman
HEM—II leader who told the crowd "we
know that the health services of this
country are not designed to meet the
needs of the people, but to serve the
needs of avaricious businessmen."

"If we can struggle together,
however, we can make those health
services respond to the people."

Lynn French of the Illinois Black
Panther Party spoke next, describing
the Chicago hospitals as being "run
by the same people — the corporations
who run the war in Vietnam. And just
as they profit from that war in Vietn.
they profit from these hospitals — the
profit off the people."

"The Black Panther Party here in
Chicago is organizing a people's healt

center," she said, "Free to those
people who need care."

Ron Berman, a medical student and
representative of the Student Health
Organization, delivered an impassioned
attack on the American medical estab—
lishment .

"When they say that County Hospital
runs at a deficit, it must be remember:

tributes to the creation of a more humanethat there are also people making a pro

society."
