“Lil Dulce
and “The

Movies. such as
Vita," "L'Al'mttill‘a,”
Seventh Seal." are indications
that in our time a new art
medium is in the process oi be—
ing realized and perfected. While
foreign ﬁlm companies are pro—
ducing works of creditable sta—
ture, however, the American
ﬁlm industry, the oiiginal pio»
neer, with its great wealth or
resources. has taken another
tack, sensationalism. Succinctly,
it has turned toward the large
rather than the beautiful.

This is not a. condemnation.
The American ﬁlm industry
can do something that no oth-
er country in the world can
do; that is, produce a. tech»
nically periect movie oi such
awesome proportions that
words like “colossal" and “stu-
Ipent'laus" are inadequate to
describe it,

But still, there seems to be no
reason why, having outdistanced
all others in technique, we can.
not turn now to producing sub-
stantial works of art as well.
At this point, you think I’m
about to say that the ﬁlm in-
dustry merely mirrors what the
public wants and the American
public has long ago been irre-
vocably vulgarized by large
breasts and loud noises. But i
don't believe that this is the
case.

it an uneducated Elizabethan
peasant could trudge into Lon-
don in order to see “Hamlet”
performed and could cnjoy it,
there is no reason why the
comparable cannot be true ot
a twentieth Century American.
Perhaps the problem paradox-
ically arises from the very fact
that the American ﬁlm industry
is the richest in the world. At
any single moment, an audience
can be convinced that it is
equally as moved by massive.
ness as artistry, and it mas.
Sireness is the more expensive
to produce, it is by the same
token. the less elusive.

As a result, many ﬁlms here
are repositories tor stock tim-
matic conventions; the deeper
the love the greater the pass
sion; silence denotes strength;

The recent controversy relate
ing to the questions of whether
student government should take
stands on political issues and
whether students should cone
cern themselves with current
political problems suggests the
larger question of the academic
community's [responsibility to
the “outside” world. My next
tour columns will consider this
problem.

Enduring social orders must
be adaptable. Changes within
the political, economic and social
order create the need for philo-
sophical and institutional ad-
justments. .A large order for
any society is to, on the one
hand, preserve the values and
goals upon which it claims to
be established and at the same
time rid itseli or beiieis and in-
stitutions made obsolete by
changing conditions. Thus, the
‘capacity of a society to sustain
its ultimate ends and its per-
manent existence is contingent
upon its capacity to accommo-
date to change.

Within less than a hundred
years irom its inception, the
united states was transtorm.
ed train an atomistic, agricul—
tural, commercial society into
an interdependent, industrial
manniactining society. in the
process, problems unanticipats
ed by the Constitution-makers
arose. Til ir appearance (Ice

on.

On the other hand, foreign
ﬁlm companies, in a sense, have
nothing else to oiter the public
and so must make their movics
artistic \\'oJ‘I'< in order to com-
pensate tor inadequacies in tech-
nical resources. And the artistry
or such a movie does not his
volve the grain of the ﬁlm or
the size of the cost. it depends
upon other taetors.

For example. in “The Seventh
Seal," the scene cuts from the
face oi the silent girl, who is
smiling because she is con—
tronted with Death, to the lace
of Mary, who is smiling be.
cause she is eenirontcd with
life. I can’t help thinking that
Hollywood would have missed
this and that the cut would
have been, say, irom Dcath‘s
right eye to doorknob or
something equally as inane.

And the casting would have
been entirely ditterent. Marlon
Brando would have played Jolls,
Rock Hudson would have been
Antonius Block, and Joseph
would have been played by
someone like Pinky Lee.

Most likely the script would
have to he changed, loot Jons
and the silent girl would have
a lender love scene to Henry
Blancini, God would spcak at
least once, Joseph would have
saved the Witch, and the
knight would be rescued at
the last minute by an angel.

At any rate, whatever the
reasons, the American ﬁlm in~
dustry has fallen behind those
of other countries artistically.
And this is perhaps something
to keep in mind, when we con-
sider that in the future. the
twentieth century will be r
member-ed not only for its
bombs and satellites but also
very possibly for the advent ot
a new art medium, the motion
picture.

call these valucsinvested means
“the cake ol custom." Most civ—
ilizations. he remarks, retain
their original form and ideas.
For this reason, ”stagnation is
the rule of the world and prog—
ress is the rare exception,” How
does ‘a society iacilitate change?
According to legchot.

“it a‘ nation luls in any con—
siderable degree gained the
habit, and exhibited the capac-
ity to discuss these questions
tthe questions involving the
visible and pressing interests
oi the community) with freer
dam, and to decide them with
discretion, to argue much on
politics and not to argue ruin-
ously, an enormous advance
in other kinds oi civilization
may conﬁdently be predicted"
While Bdgehol's claim sullers

from Enlightenment optimism,
there is much to be said tor his
argument, There are a signlﬁs
cant number in our society lilo
are still capable o[ recogn 'ng
and reacting to truth it they
are only exposed to it. Criticism
then is a device capable of en.
couraging social change and
consequently inci’eas s the adap
tive ability or society.

Since a society's ability to
survive is proportional to its
on' ity to acconnnotiate,arrd
criticism through discus on is
a lorce tor change, ‘
can increase a society‘s power
to sunlvc.

Americans fight Communism in South Vietnam

South Vietnam is one spot

training native Vietnamese in a
war against communist gue'

preserving freedom in this tiny
Asian country illustrates the
dangers involved in conducting
American toreign policy.

This country isn't viewed by
many Asians as the showplnce

IRC concerned

by Paul D. Samuel

The Americans may be war»
mad about the Russians, the Cu-
bans may fear the Americans.
and the French may be watching
the Algerians. But all ct these
problems, and many others, have
become the concern of Grinnell’s
international Relations club, for
all of them have to do with the
politics or other lands and other
peoples.

The Inc is Gi-innell's biggest
student organization, having over
420 members, more than onc<
third of the student population.
There are also fire or six lactlls
ty members who belong to the
club. while other iacuity, ale
though not IRC members, have
ing reguarly attended many at
the meetings. The ice tor meme
bet-ship is one dollar a year, or
so cents a semester.

Dan Figgins is president oi
IRC. He is a politi al science
maior, and is active in other
campus organizations, including
thc Friars and the Young Re»
publieans. He is a former na-
tional Vicesprcsidcllt of the Cole
legiate Council tor the United
Nations (CCUN),

Under Figgins, the Inc has
almost doubled its membership
in the past yeah The increas-
cd iunds which it has reccived
have enabled its board oi di—
rectors to secure better speak—
ers and more interesting events
tor its members. But there are
other, more important reasons,
[0 belonging to the club.

”We have two goals, an im—
mediate one and a long—range
one,” Figgins said. “Our immed-
iate goal is to give our members
better and more personal con—
tact with the speakers who come
here to address the [HQ

This would be impossible with
more than 400 people, but by
breaking the club down into
small groups, it is easier to give
the students a chance to meet
and to speak with the persons
who address them it

"Our longsi'ange goal, on thc
other hand ,exlcnds iar past our
lives as students at Grinncll We
wish to give America a more
inlormed citizenry, one which
can exert pressure toward the
government in the hope of male
ing it a better government. We.
like to think that we are malt»
ing progress toward this objec»
tiVC.”

In addition to eating meals
with speakers, there are other
activities which a student can
participate in only it he is a
member or me. These include
weekend trips to nearby con—
ierenccs and conventions (such
as the Foreign students Cons
iercnce which was held recenta

CAMPUS

by Ann Fetter

six juniors were asked the
following question: What is
your reaction to the junior lib-
eral arts comprehensive exam-
ination'!

Nancy Lee Norton

”It the administration plans to
institute these examinations as a
graduation requirement they
should dcvi a schedule which
gives all juniors an equal a-
mount oi preparation time. Since
1 was beginning three lower oli-
vision courses this semester, ‘1
had an ~ernely short reading
period. In addition I found the
syllabus unduly redundant."

Steve Aldrich

“I think that the liberal arts

exam should be retained; how-
ever, an inordinate weight was
placed on the Area test. While
recognizing the ditiicuity of
testing and grading the essay
sections fairly, 1 feel that as the
kinks are ironed out more
weight should be given to them
since more preparation and test
ing time was devoted to them.
The essay tests require a deep-
er understanding of the subject
matter than do the area tests,"

Linda Brayman

“My main criticism of the proA
gram was the lack of direction
given to us. I thought that the
philosophy behind the tests was

sound i enjoyed reading in
fields unrelated to my major,
but found it irustrating to try
to make up tor courses I‘ve ne\'s

up no matter how hard you try.
