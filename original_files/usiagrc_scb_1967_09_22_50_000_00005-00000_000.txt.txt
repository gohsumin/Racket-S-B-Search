PEANUTS GGSPEL PREACHED

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Mr. Robert Short, author at
The Gospel According to Pea-
nuts, gave a slide lecture and
a sermon during his visit to

Grinnell last weekend. On leave
from the University at Chicago,
where he is working on his
doctorate in Theology and Lita
erature, Short travels through-
out the country giving his slide
presentation on Peanuts.

The department oi Theology
and Literature, one of several
new interdisciplinary approach
as to theological training at the
University oi Chicago, aims at
t e a c hi n g “literary criticism
irom a theological point or
view." Short’s preparation ior
work in this field consists of
a BlD. in theology trom South-
ern Methodist University in

Dallas and a MA. in English
from nearby North Texas State.

A class at S.M.U. where thu
teacher atten illustrated them
logical points with examples
trom Peanuts gave Short the
idea ior his best-seller, which
he began shortly before starts
lng work on his PhD. The booli
was not, as is often supposed,
originally a thesis or a clasl
assignment.

For his doctoral dissertation,
he intends to write about Franz
Katha, showing that the Geo.
man novelist is "more of all
orthodox Christian thinker than
most people think."

Charles Schulz, creator of tho
Peanuts strip, is reportedly,
pleased that Short has written
this commentary which he, the
cartoonist, could not convene
iently make.
