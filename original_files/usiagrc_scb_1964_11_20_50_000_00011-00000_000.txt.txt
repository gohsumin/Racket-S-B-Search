SCARLET AND BLACK

Page Eleven

 

By Paul Trigg

 

The repercussions from my effort last week have
induced me to return to predicting game scores for a
while. Seriously, there has been enough agitation to
warrant a curtain call, but I would rather wait until all
the ballots are in before hopping back up on the shoot~
lng gallery. So, without lingering longer, let me launch
into asubject a little less controversial (I hope).

The 1964 Midwest, Conference football season is
over and Grinnell finished in a respectable tie for
fourth with Beloit, behind co-champions Cornell, Ripon

and Coe. More luster was added to our finish by last
week's impressive 28‘10 victory over St. Olaf to close
out the season Fourteen seniors played their last game
and they are to be congratulated for in three years of
varsity competition they played to a record of 17 wins,
8 losses and 1 tie. This is especially outstanding con-
aidering they were playing before a school which, for
the most part, is passive toward athletics But that is
, another subject which I would rather not get into right
nowi Regardless, I congratulate, as should the entire
school, these seniors and the football team for a good

season.

Having received a few gibes for lack of fortitude
in making predictions, thus accounting for my perfect
record this fall (95 right, 0 wrong and 1 tie); I reply

this week by placing my head on the guillotine. First.
Michigan 26 Ohio State 21 and a trip to the Rose Bowl
for the Wolverines. Secondly, and may the Lord help
me, Iowa 22 Notre Dame 21 in the upset of the year.
With this comes the end of the football season.

Next week — back to more serious matters.

 

End of Mifflin-Sundell Era al Grinnell
Coach Faces Big Rebuilding Tasll Now

The Mifflin-Sundell basket-
ball era has ended and Coach
John Piitsch faces a big re-
building task this year. ‘

Jim Milflin and John Sun-
dell, both 3«year stars and all-
conference performers, were
the only graduation losses, but
they formed the hem of last
year‘s team. accounting for 50
per cent of the rebounds and
Al per cent of the points.

Both wrote their names prom-
inently in Grinnell’s record
book. A 6-7 center, Sundell set
single game (sl), season (443),
and career (1031) rebounding
marks. Mifﬂin, a 6-4 forward,
tossed in 438 points last winter
to tie the school career stand
lard of 1101 Their departure
leaves Pfitsch with What will
probably be the Midwest Con-
ference’s shortest team.

Tallest man on the squad is
6.5 sophomore Jim Rhodes, the
probable starting center. But, he
broke his collar bone in an in-
tramural football mishap and
isn’t expected to be ready un~
til after the Christmas break.

Pfitsch has seven returning
lettermen, but only'lhree of
them—senior Clyde Smith, and
juniors Jeff Frantz and Ted
Risser, are in the 672 and over
class.

Frantzp who Piitsch says
"Could he the best basketball
player l've ever had,” set a
sophomore scoring record of

 

391 points in 1963-64 for an av-
erage of 17.8 per outing. The
most consistent scorer during
the second half of the cam»
paign, he averaged 23.6 points
for the last 10 games.

A deadly outshooter and
hard driver, Frantl is most at
home at guard. But Pﬁtsch
may have to move him to for-
ward because of his rebound-
ing skills. He ranked second to
Sundell in that department last
year.

Smith was a starting forward
in 1963-64 and averaged 6.8
points and pulled .down 98 re-‘
bounds. Kisser lettered as a
reserve forward.

The third returning starter is
510 guard Dave Sellergl‘en. A
2-year veteran his main forte
in his floor play. He averaged
4,7 points per game last sea-
son. Tom Buchholtz, Randy
Morgan, and Dick Ulrich are
the other lettel'men.

Top sophomore prospect is
Elliott Hibbs. A 6-0 guard and
another fine outshooter, he
paced last winter's lrosh team
with n 23»point average.

Other sophomores who are
given a theme to break into
the first unit are Steve Brint-
nail, Tom Hill, Dick Lovell, and
Bob Walt. None top 6-1.

Pfitscli's ﬁrst unit may in-
clude 10 Pioneers rather than
the usual {we or six. Because
of its lack oi size, Grinnell Will

lorry Miller leads
Pioneers’ Wrestlers

Coach Edd Bowers has only l0
candidates {or the nine spots on his
Grinnell Pioneer wrestling team,

but seven of them were regulars
0n the 196364 nuifit that posted a
7-1-1 dual meet mark and tin-
ished third in the Midwest Con-
lerence meet.

“We could have as good a team
as last year it we don’t have any
injuries and it a couple of our
sophomores come through," Bow-
ers stated But it appears unlikely
that the Pioneers will be able to
match last year's record as Cor-
hell and State College of Iowa have
been added to the dual meet sched-
ule. Both are perennial powers and
Cornell is expected to retain its
lnop crown,

Leading Grinnell {or the third
straight year will be Captain Larry
Miller. Miller, who combines
strength, savy, and a great com-
petitive spirit, has lost only once
in 26 matches during his Pioneer
career. That was early in his soph-
omore year. Since then, he has
copped 24 straight ‘matohes and
twice won the conference 167-pcund
crown.

Miller injured a leg in Grinnell’s
opening football game and sat out
the rest of the season, but should
be ready to go at full speed by the
opening wrestling meet.

other Pioneer lettermen are sen,
lei-s Ken Clymer, Jeff Lewis, Mop
gan Michel, and Many Ringo and
juniors Bill Barnes and Ken Strub-
ler, '

Barnes and Sirubler, a pair of
tough little guys, will till the 123-
and ladpound spots, respectively.
Strubler posted a l4—3-l mark a
year ago and came in third in the
league meet. Barnes placed sec
and though his season mark 0! 7-5-
1 wasn‘t as impressive.

Clymer, who was 44$ a year ago.
and sophomores Mike Deatherage
and Lynn Richman will ﬁll the
137-, 147-, and 157 pound slots, but
Bowers isn't Sure of the order.
Deaﬂlerage is a former Grinnell
high school star. >

Lewis is tabbed for the 177-pnund
pOSition, but may be slowed at first
by shoulder injuries he received in
football. He Won 11 of 16 matches
in 196364 and placed second in
the conference. Sophomore Eob
Geller is also available at 177.

Ringo and Michel, the two big

go with a running game. And

because of the about equal
ability of some 10 squad mem-
bers, Pfitsch will likely substi-
tute frequently.
