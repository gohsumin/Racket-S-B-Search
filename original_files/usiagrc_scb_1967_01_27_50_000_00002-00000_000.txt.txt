Sex Education —

As Bob Weber of Iowa’s Planned Parenthood Association said
ring the best attended Interim coffee hour, “Sex is here to stay,"
hile this pronouncement is hardly a revelation, it is an un-

duestionabls fact which is too often ignored. An upcoming Sex Ed-
“cation Seminar, planned by Grinnell’s Sex Education Committee,
plans to deal with the subject of sex on a laudably realistic basis

The seminar will include lectures by University of Iowa Hos-
tal gynecologist Kerschmar and Iowa sociologist fra L. Reiss,
uthor of “Premarital Sex Standards in America." (Melinda Ward

reviews his book in this issue.) Kerschmar, experienced in discus-

ing the physiological aspects of sex‘ will include slides, basic in-
ormation and the medical philosophy of sex in his talk while
iteiss plans to deal with the psychosocial aspects of sex educa-
tion.

Besides the two professional lectures, the seminar will offer a
Grinneli faculty panel on ethical factors of sexuality, Optional dis-
uussion groups based on the lectures will be open to student partick
pants and will be led by student volunteers.

The Sex Education Committee, according to AWS Board presi-
dent Karen Lauterbach, “hopes to involve faculty members and
students in the seminar’s informal coffee hours and discussion
groups,” and is presently seeking participants for the faculty
panel and student discussion group leaders

If Grinnell Students display substantial support of the seminar,
there is a good chance it will be instituted as an annual event~ as
the committee hopes. A yearly sex seminar offering the latest ins
formation on all aspects of sexuality, like a similar extant Oberlin
seminar for freshmen, would be a valuable addition to the Grin-
nell education.

An achievement of which the Sex Education Committee and its
motivating force, Karen Lauterbach, can he justly proud, the im~
pending seminar proves that committees can accomplish ends.
t-lappily, there exists at Grinnell a viable mode of community re
sponse to student stimulus. Students have made obVlous their in-
terest in a sex education program by overflow attendance at Mr.
Crossett’s virginity monologue and the Interim coffee hour on pre-
marital sex. Coming at a time both opportune and 'cnicial with
respect to the probable elimination of women's hours, the seminar's
pragamatic emphasis will be a welcome, much needed change from
previous discussions exclusively moral approach —5. G.

Student Initiative —

The student Theater Board and the Grinnell Players are to be
commended for the active interest they have shown in extending
their own education in drama and related fields. They set up a
"Theatre Interim Seminar” in which several plays that the partici-
Eants had read were discussed. This semester the Board plans to

ave a series of “informal seminar type talks" led by faculty
members; those taking part include Professors Kissane, Nelson,
Foster, Farslow, Steiner, Crossett and others.

The Board, which for a while published its own ditto news-
paper, also has a program of movie discussmns; recently 23 stu-
dents saW “Morgan” at the Strand Theater and then held a “coffee
hour” to talk about it. will W.

Credit Due —

Last week we commended students for their efforts in pro-
ducing a successful Interim but further credit must go where
credit is due. Although students met with hesitancy on the part of
some members of the administration, we have been informed that
this skepticism was not universal.

President Glenn Leggett and Dean James Stauss helped make
Interim a reality by providing financial backing. They found
lufficient funds to keep the campus open for those extra days, to
pay maid and janitor salaries and to commission SAGA.

Dru Joseph Wall, Chairman of the Faculty, is also to be

thanked for aiding the students and helping to obtain support from
“Ihe faculty and administration. —K N.

Book Review

A Sociological Look at Sex

By Melinda Ward

“Premarital Sexual Standards in America”
by Ira L, Reiss, a sociologist at SUI, is a socio-
logical investigation of the relative social and cul»
tural integration of American standards. This
book, unlike many books being written on sex
today, deals with sexual standards rather than
behavior. Reiss feels that by studying standards
“one can see more fully Ihe role of society and
culture in sexual behavior.” In this review X will
at pt to convey the contents, rather than
or ze the methods and theories.

The book can be broken down into three
main sections, the first of which deals with
the sexual nature of man and America‘s sex-
uni heritage. Relss “established man‘s roots
in the animal klngdom" hy illustrating physh
illogical similarities of men and animals and
by giving examples of parallel muting habits
and characteristics. For instance, we find the
male-dominated family system among sen
elephants and the icmale moth is a recog-
nizahle Coquette.

Beyond these superficial similarities to our
customs, there is a major difference, that being
the concept of learned behavior, Although there
are biological and inherited aspects found
in all of man’s behavior, there is a
great deal of Variance to be found in differ-
ent societies concerning sexual standards for
men and women and social customs of courtship.
“in determining specific characteristics learning
is the dominant factor, and the inherited aspect
only a minor limitation.”

Reiss goes on to give examples of cultures
which do not. consider the male the aggressive
sex. For instance, “at a ceremonial dance the
Goajiro woman (on Bali) is permitted to trip a
man; and if she succeeds he is dutyrbound to
have intercourse with her.” Reiss also shows
us that our standards of sexual beauty are far
from universal. What appeals to men in one so-
ciety does not appeal to men in other societies ——
this is learned behaviorr Likewise there is no
universal standard concerning premarital and
extramarital intercourse ur homosexuality. In
light of this "learned behavior” theory, the con-
flict between “body and soul” can be dispensed
with and be better stated and understood in
terms of a conflict between “a learned desirable
way of satiating man’s partly physiological and
partly icamed sexual desires, on the one hand,
and his learned ideas about right and wrong, on
the other hand”

Following this introductory explanation, Reiss
discusses America’s sexual heritage; from what
cultures our present-day standards have come
and developed, For instance, the proverbial
double Standard is to be found in the divorce
laws and sexual morality oi the anClent Hebrews.
“Although abstinance was the formal standard
(both men and women were forbidden premari-
tal or extramarital coitus), informally the writ-

ten punishments and social censure was much
greater for the female than for the male.

In Greek civilization women who were
married stayed in the home and extramarital
sex was strictly forbidden However, men
were expected to have an extramarital sex
life. Demosthenes is quoted by Reiss. “Man
has the Hetaerae for erotic enjoyments, con-
cuhines for daily use and wives of equal rank -
Io bring up children and to be faithful house-
wives.” Homosexuality was also acceptable
for Greek men. Roman women had I few
more rights. They were allowed to appear in
public with their husbands. "The Romans
idealized their mothers and women in gen-
erni. To Insure virginity, the Romans taught
their women from birth to think If chastity
as the highest good."

Apparently the early Christians had a very low
regard for sexual relations and marriage based
on their belief in the Second Coming of Christ.
“The early Christians felt that marriage was a
second rate choice, but if one lacked self-con~
trol, he had to take a choice. 'It is better to
marry than burn'." The status of women bit the
lower depths under Christianity — woman were
the source of sin. However, “the woman who was
not a temptress could perform a respectable rule
in Christian societyr She was given the alterna-
tive of marriage or a nunnery." Women gained
a kind of equality in that abstinence was the for-
mal standard for both sexes. ”The Christian in-
fluence has given our culture an element of
gUilt associated with all sexual behavior outside
marriage. We still have this attribute to a con-
siderable degree at the present,”

The birth of Romantic Love in the 11th
century plays a large role in our sexual
standards today. “Out of the Christian de' 'a-
datlon of sex rose the romantic idealizatmn
of it. To the knights and troubadour, his
lady was an angel, in collection of perfec-
tion." In those days love and marriage did
not go hand in hand and for awhile it was
thought that to consummate love with sexual
intercourse Was to destroy it. This tradition
underwent many changes and finally the love
object became a single girl rather titan a
married lady of the court, love and marriage
were wedded, and parental right to choose a
mate was seriously challenged.

The final influence that Reiss cites is that of
the feminist revolt which came along with the
industrial revolution. After 1848, women began
to go to college, earn their own living, and be-
came freer sexually, all of which began to weak-
en the traditional standard considerably. With
the industrial revolution the tight-knit family of
an agrarian society began to disappear and
cities provided a place for divirgent ideas and
anonymity. In the twentieth century We have
had more rapid change than ever before. In next
week’s article i will talk of Reiss’ analysis of
today‘s sexual standards and of the behavior and
consequences that are a result of the complex
and conflicting standards of modern America,

Letters . . .

To the Editor:
Some weeks ago, a number

by Mike Amow
With the recent purge of high-

ranking state official Clark
Kerr, the civil war in Califor-
nia has entered a critical stage.
All out—Of-Slale reporters have
been confined to quarters, and
no first-hand accounts of events
are available. However, observ-
ers at the near-by off-shore is-
land of Santa Catalina have
been able to piece together this
account from emigrating college
students:

Governor Ronald Reagan has
ordered a shut-down on all came
puses of [he Califoniia “niillti<
versity." Thus, all students will
be freed from scholastic chores
to pursue the goals of the anti—
cultural revolution.

The governor has mvited stu-

dents to serve the people of
California by touring the state
and routing out subversive culta
ural elements. At last report,
three beatniks were dragged
from a street-car in San Fran-
cisco, and made to confess their
crimes publicly, "The Right
Guards"—as the students are
known — gave each of the beat-
nills a shave and a copy of
“Chairman Ronnie’s Thoughts"
(it is Suspected by some that
these thoughts are, in fact, lines
from G. E. Theater).

At last notification Chairman
Ronnie had announced that, as
soon as the anti-cultural revo-
lution is consolidated. the state
of California will be able to
move forward in its "Great
Leap Backward."

It seems that Grinnell is just
too progressive and visionary,
yea, too radical, for them
Well, they may now rest assured
that such is not the case, for
our administration is currently
highballing us straight back in-
to the past. “Yea, rah Pioneers!
Ronald Reagan, here we come!"
