Six Coeds to Help
Mentally Retarded

Six Grinnell students will
spend the weekend of Febru~
ary 7-9 working at Woodward
State Hospital for the mentally
retarded, just west of Des
Moines.

Susan F o s t e r, Suzanne
Gelber, Susan Gilmore, Susan
Goldberg, Suzanne Watkins,

and Jean Watson will partici-
pate in a weekend institution-
al Service Unit, sponsored by
the American Friends' Serv-
ice Committee.

In this program, students
from several colleges spend
one Saturday and the follow
ing Sunday morning in the
wards of the hospital-school,
caring for mentally retarded
children. \

“The purpose of the pro-
gram," says Jean Watson, who
organized this weekend's trip,
“is to acquaint college students
with the problems of the men-
tally retarded.”

The program also includes
discussion and evaluation
session with volunteers and
leaders. During these ses-
sions, the students compare
reactions to the program, and
share their experiences.

The students sleep at the hos—
pitalschool, free of charge.
The only charge AFSC makes
for the weekend is $1.50.

Students interested in a simi-
lar trip may receive applica-
tions from Mr. Roger Eldridge,
college chaplain, or from Jean
Watson. Anyone may apply.

Termed by some reviewers
the “most distinguished chor-
ale ensemble to be presented
to the American public in al-
most a decade,” the group of
young Southern Californians
is currently making its third
(our of the U. S. and the Eu-
ropean continent, where they
will appear in 50 cities.

“They look like refugees
from a college prom,” wrote
Time of the Gregg Smith Sing-
ers at the Darmstadt Contem-
porary Music Festival last
year. “But they soar with un-
canny ease. . . through music
. . . as difficult as any being
written.”

The Gregg Smith Singers be-
gan in 1955, when Gregg Smith,
a graduate teaching assistant
in the music department of the
Lo 5 Angeles campus. Uni-
versity of California, gathered
a group of music students and
young musicians interested in
singing the new music and
rarelyrperformed old works.

Early in the group’s life,
support came from compos<
ers and other musicians in-
trigued by the unusual
phenomenon on the musical
scene—a choral group of pro-
fessional calibre actually de-
voting time and energy to the
singing of works other than

Handel’s “Messiah” and
other standards. Many were
contemporary compositions
never heard in concert be-
fore.

In 1958, an invitation came
from Monday Evening Con—
certs Director. Lawrence Mor-
ton, to perform Schoenberg‘s
Opus 27, a work which had been
scheduled several times before
but never offered because of its
complexity. “Actually, they ex-
pected us to turn them down,”
remembers Smioh. “But our
group felt there was an enor-
mous value in Schoenberg, not
to be overlooked, and that the
preparation and discipline in
volved would be good back-
ground for our doing other
composers." ‘ ‘

Ten months later, the eliLe
avant-garde Monday Evening
Concerts audience heard the
Schoenberg. “A standout,"
said the Los Angeles Times.

Prominent Roles in Midwest UN
Manned by 13 Grinnell Students

Thirteen Grinnellians will be
playing prominent roles when
the three-day Midwest Model
United Nations convenes in St.
Louis, March 18, for its third
annual session, Eight students
will be active in the leadership
of the conference, While five
others will represent the
school—taking the role of the
delegation from Portugal.

David Golden, Grinnell Sena
ior, who will serve as President
of the General Assembly at this
year's MMUN Conference, de-
scribed the meeting in St.
Louis as ”playing the serious
game of the United Nations.”

“Our main purpose is to
delineate the issues and to
show what happens when
countries have to become ace
countable for their policies
and actions," Golden said. In

is Next Speaker
In ‘0rder Seminar’

The “Interdisciplinary Semi-
nar on Order” will begin its

second semes-
t e r w i t h a
speech by Dr.
Monroe Beards-
] e y, professor ‘
of p h l l o s o«
phy at Swarth-
m o r e College. ’
He will speak
on “Order and
D i s o r d e r in
Art" at 8:00
p. m. Tuesday
in H e r r i c k
Chapel.

“The \ Nature of Artistic
Creation” will be presented
by Dr. Beardsley as the fine
arts lecture on Wednesday.
Both lectures will be open to
the public.

Dr. Beardsley received both
his bachelor’s and doctor’s de—

playing the game, the 500
delegates from schools
throughout the midwest learn
how this process occurs in
the actual United Nations
sessions in New York. This
process, ierces the nations to
confront issues and to com-
promise.

Delegations of five from over
a hundred colleges and univer»
sities throughout the midwest
will gather at the Chase Park
Plaza Hotel in St. Louis. Each
delegation will represent a
member nation of the United
Nations, These students will at-
tempt to take the role at the
Model UN which their country
plays at the General Assembly
session in New York. Thus, stu»
dents learn not only about the
policies of their country, but
also about the bloc of which
their country is a part,

The delegation from Grin-
nell, which will be represent-
ing Portugal, the last classi-
cal colonial power, is com-
posed of Dan Bucks, chair-
man, Phil Johnson, Peter

Miller, Tom Lane and Paul,

Thurston.

Golden explained that the
MMUN represents only the
General Assembly and the Se<
curity Council. These are the
parliamentary bodies of the
United Nations, and they do
little of its actual work. The
work i done by the agencies
and civil servants, but these
are the organs in which the
give and take among nations
takes place.

The General Assembly, in a
manner similar to that of the
United States Congress, does a
great deal of its work in Corn-
mittees, Golden explained. At
the conference itself, must of
the time is spent in model
committee meetings, and in
model General Assembly ESSA
sions. Each of the five dele«
gates from a school serves as
a part of the delegation in the
model General Assembly ses-

sions and also represents his
country on one of the five com-
mittees of the General Assent-I
bly.

Grinnell students will serve
as chairmen of these various
committees. Paul Courtright
will chair the Political and
Security Committee; Tom
Evans, the Special Political
Committee; Curt Lamb, the
Social, Cultural, and Human-
itarian Committee; Mike Pat-
terson, the Trusteeship Com-
mittee; and Paul Reichs, the
Economic and Financial Com-
mittee.

These schools whose coun-
tries sit on the Security Coun-
cil will send six delegates, on.
for each of the five commit¢
tees, and one to represent the
country at the model Security
Council meetings. Jack Chap<
man will serve as president of
the Security Council.

Another Grinnell studen'
Steve Fleck, is chairman o
the Conﬁrmations Committee,
responsible for the election of
officers and the continuation of
the conference from year to
year. Other major officers of
this year’s MMUN session are
students at the University of
Illinois and at Drake University
in Des Moines.

Proiect Gets Support

The National Science Foun-
dation has granted $9,900 to
Grinnell College to support a
catalytic research project. for
two years, starting this month.

The research, titled ”Soluble
Silica-Alumina Catalysts,” is
directed by Dr. Joseph D. Dan-
forth, professor or chemistry,
who has b e e n conducting
studies of catalysts, particular-
ly in their application to “crack
ing” of petroleum, over a long
period of years.

The new grant supplies con-
tinuing support for the studies
of catalysis begun under a
grant from the Office of Naval
Research in 1948.
