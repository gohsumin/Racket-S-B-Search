Scarlet Fever

by Len Calndney

Buck Tumbull of the Des Moines Register gives Grin-
nell the edge over Monmouth for the conference champsl
iOX‘iSllllL He, as most observers, attributes this to the sched-
ule advantage the Pioneers have over the Scots Grinnell
has four home and one away' contests remaining, while
Monmouth has two home and four road games, including a
pair at Carleton and St. Olaf.

 

l

Conservatism is not peculit only to politics, but is al-
so found in athletics, as is demonstrated by the currentl
controversy over the fiberglass vaulting“ pole. The loudest
cries come from former pole vault champ, Don Bragg, who
feels that; the new pole is a gimmick, and does not Show
true ability.

It seems as though Bragg would really like some more
time to husk in his former glory, instead of accepting the
fact that progress brings new and better methods of doingl
things.

Carletolt's 21-15 wrestling victory over St. Olaf has
rocketed the Cal‘ls into the position of the teanl-to-beat
in the Midwest Conference meet coining up next month.
To accomplish this feat. they will have to defeat peren-
nial champ Cornell, who has taken tlle top honors 20 of
the past 21 years.
