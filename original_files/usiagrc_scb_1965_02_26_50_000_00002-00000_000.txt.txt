Shades of Gray
living Up

By Carl Otls Gray

In the past two weeks I have constantly been
amused by the responses to my last article. it
seems that by_attacl-iing America’s sacred cows
1 provoked an overwhelming majority or my read-
ers. Paul Roberls' column last week took particu-
lar care to note the “depth of my hatred” im-
plying that l was “vicious, hateful, bigoted, narrow-
minded and arrogant." it seems that. Mr. Roberts
and Company need some setting straight. l intend
to live up to my reputation -— so Mr. Roberts, I’ll
be arrogant enough to defy anyone who tells me
I have no right to do so.

it there are any other self established experts
on the Negro mind in the audience l would urge
them in forever hold their peace, because they
cannot and never will begin to scratch the surlace
of a problem with which they have never come face
to race. 1 have a right to be presumptious enough
to say that no one. save another Negro. can tell
me anything about civil rights. While liberal or
not, I knew more about American democracy, or
whatever it should be called, at the age of ten than
you will even be able to know. As the hypocrisy that
calls itself acceptance wends its way into our lives,
new hypocrlsies will slowly be uncovered and ran
vealed. Don’t tell me how I Should [eel about being
given the privilege ut living in this wonderiul "ldylr
lic" community because i could not be less interest.
ed. Realize this, you're doing me no lavors.

it you honestly want to delve into that thing
that you all know so well, “the Negro mind,” ask
Eddie Atkins’ four year old sister who was beaten
up by her iellow kindergarten students because she
was a Negro. Ask the children who were herded
through the streets of Selma what it means to
be an American. Then and only then can we begin
to converse on a level with me as the teacher and
you as the student.

Until I was so dubbed by Iellow Grinnell stu-
dents as an embittered young man, l had never
considered myself as such. But if that is the case,
well then, “you ain’t seen nothin' yet." I would
suggest that it any of you are interested in pursuing
the development of bitterness in the American Ne-
gro you should read (he works or w. E. DuBois to
begin with and then as you graduate to the rela:
tively techie voice or James Baldwin you hold
your stomach and read LeRoi Jones' personal
statement in Kulchul‘ 9, the one that ends with his
final word to Negroes — CUT THEIR THROATS!
All that: men are distinctly out of the realm of
hlaclr Nationalist, Black Supremist movements, so
that charges oi ianatictsm are totally invalid. Alas,
even James Baldwin, In a debate with William F.
Buckley at Cambridge last week mirrored my
views by stating “The American Dream is held at
the expense or the Amerlcari Negro.”

And furthermore — get the hell off my back,
you've been on it long enough; it's my turn.

Paul Roberts
Roberts Rules Of Disorder

As spring approaches — slowly - a young man's
fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love and base-
ball and tennis and like that.

Not so at Grinnell, Men of normally sound
sense turn rather heavily to nights or lancy or, to
be more explicit, to thoughts of SGA elections.

This year — even before the sap has started to
run - some ol the “edge" has been taken off the
election. SGA has been simpliﬁed. Alas, no more
complex procedure, no more “cumbersome checks
and balancas," no more unwieldly Senate sessions.
In short, no more charm.

Lest titer: be any contusion, SGA was and re-
mains a game to he played by campus politicos,
devoid oi any significance or importance. lt ac-
complished little before. It will accomplish little in
the luture. It cannot possibly do more than set petty
penalties {or petty oilenses, argue petty points in
a petty manner, and create sell~inflated images of
importance tor its ofﬁcers.

By simplifying the game. by reducing the num-
ber of players, by making the rules easy to under-
stand. the game has lost any challenge. Embroil-
merit and experience in practical political pro-
cedure was the only accomplishment of SGA. Now
we‘ve removed that.

The advance or spring at Grinnell usually brings
thoughts or the gall Course by night, water lights
and — the greatest circus at all — the sen con-
vention. Almost as a corollary to SGA’s loss o!
charm, it looks at ii there might not be I conven-
Klan.

In order to have a convention, there must in
three people ioolish enough to want the job of SGA
president. Seemingly we have no such huﬂoons. "l‘is
a pity. You would think that on a campus or this
size and nature, there would be at least three peo-
ple willing to play the larce or SGA president.

Or perhaps the board scores have gone up so
much that . . w

letters to M other

I’m sitting in the northwest corner or the North
Lounge at the Forum, watching my brand new,
Corvette—wheeling buddy Casual stucco dance the
Harlem-shuttle with a hippy girl with ratted hair.

I'm getting nervous because Casual la imitating
the people on the Lloyd Thaxton show, mouthing
words to the jukebox and weaving around across
the ﬂoor, his eyes closed in a transtixion of glory
which only Calitomians apparently understand.
Meanwhile, the Forum has has sent in goons to
check out the noise and one hau just pulled out a
balloon used in sobriety tests.

“Stucco, we’ve got to split."

Stucco notices the unrest in the crowd, mutters,
“Like this scene is hurtirr, man”, and dispenses
with the unknown girl with the railed hair by
murmuring gently, "Take live in the crusher, baby."

with a sigh ol reliel l head lor the door. But
Casual has just gotten hung up on the ﬂashing ligth
warning glrls that the Faculty Committee is literally
hallrslarved [or more Victims. I finally drag him
out a Side door, safe (mm the stampede, to south
campus. Once agatn casual lS oblivious to the
activity around him, as he dances down the Slde<
wulk pretending he's got a guitar.

We got to lind a place to put him up while
he's Visiting, so we head tor Langan and look
around. One thu‘d of the hall has disappeared. C85
ual is naturally preplexed. “It looks mlghly strange,
man, all these cats splitting so sudden.”

“No sweat, man. it’s just like u mid-winter
Berkeley lelist purge.”

Relicved, Casual produces a Barry, God and
Mother button and starts testing pads. in one
deserted room there’s an electric guitar abandoned
0n the floor. It belongs to a student on a on»
month vacation. Casual has round his bag again
and tucks the instrumznt under the blankets next
to the pillow.

“This is it, man, Throw some sand in the box
to i can catch my 2's."

Latter that night I'm awakened by the sound
or large vehicles pulling up outside. instinctively
I run for Stucoo’s room in Case we have to hide
out in the heating tunnel again. Stucco's asleep
with his guitar, but the screams or hostages being
dragged down the hall and thrown into the trucks
soon wake him up.

“Listen Casual, we’ve got to get out of hero
{or a while. Will you drive m to Marshalltolvn?”

"Sure man, anything but this. A not can't.
even lake a nod around here.”

Next morning, Casual has his red Corvette
packed and ready to roll, The chick with [he railed
hair is standing by the cor, painting her linger
nails and wavmg a temporary farewell.

As we Spin out, 1 say, “Casual, like Who's the
daily with the hair."

“Tune in next week, man "
