IIII IMMODEST PROPOSAL

By DON WINNEY

Author's note: Any sexual or otherwise scintillating sym-
bolism herein stated, whether intended or distended, ex«
tended or attended is hereby declared slmply symbolism,
unless otherwise perverted.

Not long ago our esteemed President declared there is a Resl~
dential Hall Problem, not to be confused with last year‘s South
Campus Problem or the previous year's North Campus Problem,
He asked for a frank Solution and now, Irl all immodesty, I should
llke to propose a very natural one. But first, perhaps an existential
example from my tnil at Grinnell will help one candidly conceptu-
alize this humble answer.

A couple years ago one spring rlot night after diligently wres<
ding with the social implications of my gradepoint, I was calmly
contemplating realities of existence in a North Campus lavatory.
There, surrounded by cool green walls, lulled by a sweet, seques-
tered quietiide occasionally rippled by the sibilaut suddenness ol
sloshing water, I gargled transfixed by the Very pastoral sanctity
of this haven, reminded as indeed William Wordsworth was of
nature's welcome refreshment.

"Five times," I murmured to the rythmic rain of cleansing
water, “Five long times have I passed to thee this day. And again
I hear these waters swelling from their natural spring i .

“Pooh, you 5.0.3., you," I heard a friend politely posit. I ma
quiesced to that affectionate euphemism, although no one before
had ever called me “Pooh."

“Pooh," he implored, “This bitch has to take a ———”

“cognizance of our facilities?" 1 suggested. He was referring
to the sleepy, curvacious bundle of silken beauty seductively nes-
tled in his virile arms. “Why certainly," l replied, although dutl<
fully noting its gender, one usually foreign to our North Campus
facilities.

He gently dropped her on the floor along with several cans
of roaming liquid and staggered to the mirror where he wrote in
lipstick some obscure classical word, it looked like a derivative
form of the Latin Verb “iucco, fuccere,”

“Come on, Pooh," he begged in a somewhat unscholarly man-
ner, “Let's leave this bitch and go rape South Campus."

Why what did he mean? Never before had I been proffered
such a philosophical proposition. After all. it might be easy to do
that kind of thing to a bitch. But tn a universal . , . Suddenly I
seemed confronted with a moral dilemma of enormous propor-
tion, one unequal to my mental or physical fortitude. Should l fol-
low my friend‘s sinuous and sinful path to South Campus like an
animal or should I remain here amidst the amenities of Civilizav
tion? That was the question: To go or not to go?

I had to go. Quickly I walked over to the lacility, Just then,
however, this bitch started tervently clawing at my leg. I looked
down and as i did. as 1 gazed upon those sultry lips, upon that
silken skin and sensuous body, upon that wagging tail, it was as
if the burdens of Civilization were somehow to be discharged, as
if face to face we stood naked unto the world unashamed oi out
corporal beings and now awed with a transcendental sense at hu-
man bretherhnod. l quickly pulled up my pajamas.

As my uncouth friend impatiently left, I graciously held the
door or the faculty open while she soampercd in. Yet I too was
relieved. At last there was a solution to the Residential Hall Proh-
lem a a civilizing emission at the human condition: coeducational
johns.

DEFENSE PLANNED AS
INVADERS RETURN

 

Again alter legal visiting
hours, though this week on Fri-
day night. six strange young
men found their Way into Read,
Loose. and Meats dormitories,

They went first to Read, en—
tering by the loggia door and
passing a Read girl who had
witnessed the invasion of Sat-
urday the eleventh.

She said: “At least one of
them was the same; he was a
big guy and easily recogniz<
able. One wore a jacket turned
inside out, but it flapped open
and showed a William Penn
College insignia," and added,
"They were drunker this time.”

One man entered a second

. floor room but left when told
by the surprised girl that she
was going to call the police.

The SIX then went (0 Loose
lounge where Bette Davis, Res-
Idellt Adviser, prevented them
from entering actual bedrooms.
She phoned the police, was told
about the Road call, gave dlr
recllOllS In the dormitories and
went to Main to look for the

patrol car already en route to
South Campus.

Their last Visit was to Mears.

“About 12:15 a.m. I went to
my mom; i opened the door.
A guy was sitting inside on the
windowsill, using my tele-
phone," a Mears girl said.

The window, which had no
look, was open, revealing the
boy's friends who were waiting
outside on the ﬁre escape. The
loose window screen had been
torn off.

“I asked him What he was
doing and he asked to make a
‘phone call," she continued, “I
told him he couldn’t, pried his
ﬁngers from the phone, and
pushed him out the Window, onto
the fire escape.

They ran to their car which.
she said, was a red Chevy
Convertible with a white top

The police, although they have
not caught the offenders, re<
portedly told the nightwatch-
man that the boys were from
Brooklyn, lcwu.

BOOK REVIEW

ON NELLY SACHS,
HER POETRY

By GEORGE YOUNG,
RUSSIAN

The first German-English edi-
tlon of the collected poems of
Nelly Sachs (0 The Chimneys,

published last month by Far-
rat, Strauss, and Girou) is a
book of very important poems,

Hans Magnus Enzensberger,
in his introduction to the book.
calls the oeuvre of Nelly Sacha
great and mysterious, two
words which are among the
first we teach freshmen to
avoid when writing about liter-
ature. But Enzensberger use!
the right words,

Her poetry is great because
in poem after poem Nelly
Sachs iinds human voice and
human words adequate to speak
of the inhuman and unspeak-
able agony of the death camps.

Her poetry is mysterious be-
cause her words, her Voice, her
images quietly, without forcing
or fudging, transmute real
Bgunles into real joys. in her
poems the dust that rises from
the death furnaces becomes, by
magic that is not slight-of—hand,
the dust the butterlly carries
on his wings. The dust from
Dachau is carried, by winds
which man can not control,
across seas to become the soil
of Israel.

The themes here are the old,
timeless ones: death and re-
birth, catastrophe and redemp<
tinn. But what is fresh and
timely is the voice with which
Nelly Sachs speaks of these
deaths and these reblrlhsi

One certain problem for ev-
eryone today. but especially tor
the literary artist, is that daily
one witnesses and learns more
of the unspeakable, but one has
only words. Nelly Sachs fled
from Germany to Sweden in
1940, when, as she said, lan-
guage was all she had left. Not
many writers in any language
can lind words that say more
than a picture of a pile of emar
ciated bodies, or Words that
speak more eloquently than the
seven digit number of the
people wllo were killed. Only
the rare Word \leI not bounce
back, only the rare voice will
not scream or fail. Moreover,
the news media show us so
much of the unspeakable so
Often that our ears no longer
hear, say, the weekly boxscores
from Vietnam; our eyes no
longer see that humans, not
just televised objects, are be-
ing killed. For sanity we make
ourselves blind, deaf, dumb.

The achievement of Nelly
Sachs is that she gives us eyes
(her eyes on the dust jacket
photograph are unforgettable),
ears, and Voice to rehumanize
ourselves as, today. we con-
stantly must.

IIEIIN PATROL ROOMER RUMOR

Uncommon to popular belief,
up student has yet been tound
in violation of residence hall
regulations, Dean Thompson
said. Asked about patrolling, he
said that there has not been any
since the Spring Riot last year.
and he does not plan any in
the near future; he has no
plans for, as he puts it, “wane
dering around looking for trou-
ble." Thompson does, however,
reserve the right to intervene

if informed specifically of any
trouble.

Thompson said that house
councils, consisting of elected
officials, seemed to give pri-
mary loyalty to their constitu-
ents than to the administration
in conflicts that arise between
the two. A “civil service sys-
tern," he stated, might there
fore be preferable. The South
Campus ”batilehoard system"
was commended by Dean
Thompson as one such example.

the fact of the Volunteer's serv-

In future appeals, Vaughn
will write letters to the board ,
describing the circumstances in
each case and urging board

members to grant a determent
until completion of the Volun<
teer's overseas tour.

“We have a serious situa-
tion," he said. “The problem
of induction notices to overseas
Volunteers is becoming a ma-
jor concern for us. Pulling a
Volunteer off a productive job
at midatcur is unfair to the na-
tion, the host country, the
Peace Corps and the individu-
al.”
