Women's hours?

Some Grilinell authorities apparently feel that with-
ticlt women's hours free love would flourish and ti lt Gilli-
nell would immediately be tabbed as a college with low
tr l'al standards
l THESE REASONS seem to me to lie based largely on
conjecture. I have always felt hours regulations to be a
c'enial of a basic right of women students: to decide for
themselves how they will live their days i all 4 hours 01'
titemi

A morality dependent on regulations rather than
one founded on conviction is a handicap, not an asset.

Grinnell's women will not have the “convenience" of
cill'fews all their lives. Why impose upon them a set: of
regulations which relieves them from the responsibility
ct mak lg decisions which will. for many, inevitably arise
after giadnation.

And “ill the name of the college suffer that much?
Will it be criti ized by those people \ihos Clitlcisln can

erill lnqurrrcs as to why i signs

The incidcnt of chaining the

While, because oi the conius.
ion it caused some people, it \vaa
unfortunate that this example
appeared in the printed lctlcr,
i strll dcllnitely agree with the
basic prcrnisc oi the lcttci .This
is that the collccc rulcs policy
fosters irresponsibility,

But, since the stunt 01
ing the Quad frftccn nrrnulcs

the locking of the Quad every

sighted as an example of thc

To the Editor,

The Executive cabinet has per:
vcrtcd the foundations of student
government. They have usurped
our right and have decided that
student government is not for

,thc students but is a place to

test the effectiveness of “power
politics," These budding politic
crans have ignored thc rcoucsts
and rights of the students in
their quest for selfraggi‘andize-
rnent.

WHEN QUESTIONED about
the Missisippi resolution, 104
out of 13:: students requested ‘an
all-campus referendum on the
‘issue. The Strident Senate added
its unanimous approval of such
a l'efelcndum in response the
Executive cabinct denied both
rccucsts.

Boston explained the
cabinets action by blaming it
on student apathy. This nrust
bc false. for by their actions
the students have deﬁnitely
demonstrated their concern.
Mr. Boston further complains
. of disinterest in student gov-
eminent. Yet when interest is
ﬁnally d'plnycd. he and the
exccirtivc cabinet stiﬂe it and
promote further disinterest by
ignoring the voice or the stu-
, dcnls.

The preservation of student
government lies in on hands.
We must express our dissatisfac—
tion with this course of events
Thc leaders must bc cducatcd in
the fundamentals of democratic
govcrnnrcnt. Mr. Boston and Mr.

incn in st be stopped in

thcrr altcmpls to st in the stu-
dents of student government.

FORUM;
DiiEENi

By Tom Phillips

For my initial ioray into tile
acid of “columny.” 1 would like
to takc up a question which is
often found burning upon the
nation‘s campuses, and which. i
imagrnc, Continues to smoldcr on
into later lifc. Thc question be.
ing. of coursc, “Which is bettcr,
communism or capitalism?"

Now rm going to approach
this seriously. My friends often
tell me that communism is
better because: it eliminates
selﬁshness rind competition
which result in vicious econ
ncmic and social inequalities.
That it provides noble common
goals instcnd of personal goals
And that. by its control of the
means of production, it is bets
tcr able to comply with actual
demand, thus doing away with
big surpluses. recessions, and-
similar phenomena

Now I realize that what my
fricnds are doing is describing
communism in theory rather
than communism in practice, but
that doesn't really bother me at
all. What really bothers me is
that they arc ignoring a big
ccntrcl oucstrcn which is also
rather obvious, namely, “15 conic
munisrn “in” (Or more propor—
ly. "Would communism be tum")

HERE I‘M GOING to take my
stand, 1 like capitalism bctter
than communism because the
former is more fun than the lat-
tcr: that's my stand. And now
lct us take some Cesas in point,

Last week. aftcr an extended
abscncc, the Minncapalrs and St.
Louis freight train resumed run-
ning through the middle of our-
campus as in ola- of yore, And
do you know what happened
when that ﬁrst train of the ycai
hovc into view? Wcll, about any

people empted from
nearby buildings and chalged
out to the railroad tracks yell-
ing and waving.

IN THE UNION. a lot of pet)—
gatlrcrcd around lhc windows
to watch, and among other
things they saw one young lady
run alongside a boxcar and
jump up onto one of those littic
ladder-s.

People like that train. and
now we must attempt to tie-
lineate why: partly because of
the whistle and the nnise, part-
ly because you can wave to
the cabooscman and he'll wave
back, but mostly because of
those boxcars with signs on
them: slog-airs like Route of
thc Vista-Dome North Coast
Limited," or "Ship it on the
'Frisro," or “The Peoria Gate-
way," or that very best one of
nlL "The Southern Serves the
South." Wonderful signs. Ciill
forth visions,

At this point 1 would like cw
cryonc to cast his or her mind
back to that Russian movie we
all saw in Roberts theater, the
one in which we got a good
extended look at a Soviet freight
train.

were all lhc same
color, weren’t they? And the
same size, And did you per,
chance see any picturcs on them,
lrkc that mountain goat on the
Greal Norther-n bexcars'.’ And
would you. my friends, have rim
out of the Union with such glee
to greet a long. plain. grav
freight train?

Well. i have another main
vclorrs example which conccr
a teddy bear 1 won at Concy
island. and some very witty
Burma-Shave signs which i real-
ly should inform gcu or. but
I'm afraid that space rcuuln ions
preclude such obstr-cpcr sir :. And
so, until then. 1 remain.

the newspapers would stop
playing thc situation up, and if
the troops would be urtlrdrawn.
