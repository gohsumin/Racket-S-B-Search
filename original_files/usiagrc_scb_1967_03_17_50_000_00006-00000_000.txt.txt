counselling and resident advisors. In
- dition to her other suggestions, she
said of olt campus living for women:

"Now with at least a tentative and tem-
porary possibility tor women’s apart-
ments, 1 can only hope the college will
hesitate long enough in its plans for
a new women’s dorm to seriously con-
sider alternative forms or residence.
My personal feeling as a member of
the dorm plaruiirig committee is that
by accepting at this time as unalterable
truths the college policy towards resi-
dence living and the separation of the
campuses, we are moving too quickly
to a plan which only solidifies the
present system and eliminates other
possibilities."

CofHP President Bob Fonts reminded
the Senate of the considerable progress
that students have made in the past
four years He added that he hoped
to see the elimination of the car rs-
striction rule, drinking regulations, and
women's hours in the near future,

SGA President Steve Kent spoke of
this year's new “student image", but
oautioned students to remember that
the “problems are complex."

Finally, the Senate approved the al-
location of $270 from GB&R (General
Budget and Reserve) to cover the hall
damages incurred this year,

Steve Kent also announced the no
pointrnent of John Denny as Social
Coordinator, Gary Giddins as Concerts
Chairman, and Theodora Underwood
as Dithyramb Chairman.

”There will probably be a request for

Initiative Fund

“Serious attention must once again be
given to this allocation. The people who
serve on the Senate Initiative Fund
committee must be tnily interested in
making the fund work; such was not the
case this year. There are several sug-
gestions which should be considered,

(1) ”Placing a senator as chairman
DI the committee. By doing this,
perhaps the senate will find one who
is more responsive to its wishes and has
an easier time communicating with Its
members.

(2) “Having the North Campus Social
Chairman chosen by the old com? or
the Executive Cabinet and having him
concern himself directly with the ques«
tions or the administration fund,

(a) “A suggestion to the hall —- they
should stop groaning about the money
lost and come up with suggestions to
make the fund work instead of sitting
back contented with what can only be
called an abysmal social program. Sev-
eral halls this year have made good use
of the fund, and we think their social

board members past and present agreed,
is on establishing a variety or resident
opportunities for students or Grinnell.

Dean Eugene "lhompson concurred
with the general tenor or the students'
suggestions He recognizes the desirabil-
ity of a concept of the college that goes
beyond dormitory living.

Lynda Thoman, who is on the
Building Proposals Committee, em<
phasized that her objections to the
“women's” dorm is based on her hope
for integrating the dorms — alternating
men's and women's halls.

So far these proposals are, in the
words of one new board member, “an
underground movement.” No concrete
courses or action have as yet been pro
posed.
