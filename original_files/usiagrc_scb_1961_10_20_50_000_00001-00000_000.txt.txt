Dancers Revive

, by Ruth Gruenewald

Over a lunch of yogurt, fruit
salad and baked beans, yester-
day, lndrani and her troupe of
dancers graciously entertained
four Grinnell students, with con~
vcrsation ranging from the
British occupation of Indra to the
educational systems in America
and India and to the bewildering
v iety of languages and dialects
being spoken in these countries

What impressed us most abouti

grace of movement and tlleil,

Although the dance is still
performed as a religious cere-
mony in the temples, it has also
found wide acclaim as a purely
artistic form. “It is too late,"
said lndrani, “to close the gap
between it and religion.”

A noted critic in South India,
K. v. Ramchalldran, paid tribute
saying, “In-
drani’s dance is beautiful because
she Clings to tradition. Her devo—
tion evokes the atmosphere of
the temple where the art was
born and grew.”

The importance of tradition
was brought home to us by a
story that lndrani told. Some
time ago, Arthur Godfrey was
in India and wanted to make a
film of her dancing before a
famous tomb, lndrani refused
request, although he
