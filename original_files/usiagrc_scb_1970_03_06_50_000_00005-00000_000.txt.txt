The Senate Meets The Administration To
Discuss Grinnell's Financial Problems

By Tom Greenﬁeld

Shakespeare was right, Tho
demisc, corruption or overthrow
DI heads of slate leads to a mam-
moth disruption or the natural
order ofbeing,

In the absence of Jim Lew,
Andy Loewi took over the chores
of ring master [or the Senate
meeting, This devastating politi»
cal shift touched oil the following
highly unnatural chains of events.

1) The Senate cut back on its _

spending. 2) Tom Thomas did not
ask the Senate to do anything.
He wasn't even there. 3) There
was no castigatiuns oi the SM}
or Mr. Bierman. 4) Art Knowles
was dragged into the Senate
meeting to [ill the one needed
chair tor a quorum, thereby
making him personally responsi-
bleior starting a Senate meeting.
5) The Senate, for the most part,
undertook important business.

Dean Walker asked to speak
to the Senate’s “collective
mind.” He was informed that this
was impossible because Steve
Schwartz is no longer in school.
However, he made do with what
he had.

Sounding not unlike Doug
Klein, Dr. Walker announced that
the College is hurting for money.
As a result the College is con-
sidering the lollowing proposals,
tor reducing student services
next year: the elimination oi
linen service (a savings at some
530,000) and ZLthe elimination
of maid service to the individual
rooms. (Dr. Walker believes that
a program can be instituted
whereby the students could have
a choice of using a commercial
service or providing their own
linen and doing their. own
cleaning.)

Sally Hamanrl raised the
question about the late at the
maids if the elimination of maid
service to rooms were to occur.
Further discussion raised the
following questions: Will the
maids be eliminated'.I Will they
be forced into janitorial work?
Will they be phased out? Will the

college community know the
administration's thinking on
these issues before the budget is
drawn up and approved?

Dr, Walker was not sure about
these questions as Mr. l-Iawn has
been responsible tor working out
all of these details Dr. Walker,
however, said that he would
straighten out all 01 these mat-
ters by volunteering to talk to
Mr, IIawn. The Senate was taken
aback by Mr. Walker's unbridled
masochism, but agreed that this
would hea good idea.

Kathy Heinze launched a den
pressing report on the Health
Center. The College is finding it
quite difficult to attract staff to
our fair town. Even substantial
linancial otters may not be suia
licient to entice the number of
people necessary. Dr. Walker
assured the Senate that the ad
ministration will keep working
with the problem. The College
urges students to try to stay very
healthy until the problem is
resolved.

Students concluded the
discussion by questioning Drs.
Wall and Walker on the general
state of the College’s finances.
in keeping with the College's
desire to compare itself with big
name eastern schools, Dr, Wall
proudly announced that Grinnell
is now deficit spending 7 just
like Wesleyan. When asked for
a comparison of diis year’s
budget and last year’s,‘ Dr.
Walker said that we were able
to come up with a surplus last
year by working on a ten month
fiscal year. This clips a iull two
months off the old ACM record.

Charlie Doherty openly
claimed that he caught some
iaculty members making "prer
meditaled prevarications” and
“frantic jestutes“ last Friday.
The Senate thought at first that
Charlie had busted another
iaculty party, They were relieved
to discover that he was objecting
to the tact that students were
turned away irom the crowded
Dada happening in lavor oi
[acuity and friends of the per~
formers who were in the back
of the waiting line. The Senate
will send letters noting this dis
crimination to the public events
committee and Dr. Leggett.

Senate starting after break.

Andy Brill would like some stu-
dents to help work up a prelimi
nary budget tor next year. A
knowledge oi subtraction (and a
willingness to use it) are
essential. _

Bob Wilson sounded out the
Senate on the problem of tem-
porary loss of hearing due to the
volume of the North Lounge
Dances. Bob wondered about the
possibility of some sort or control
ol ti_tls problem (maximum
decibel level). Alan Cohen
challenged Wilson’s concern.
Taking a hint from tormer SErB
columnist, William F. Buckley,
Alan said that the students did
not have to go to the dances, and
moreover had the right to ruin
their own cars. The Senate
decided to postpone action on this
problem, but, as a preliminary
measure, ordered the publicity
committee to make up twenty
posters reading “Caution:
Bultaco May be Hazardous to
your Health."

Brecht fled the Nazis during
their reign and spent several
years in the United States. There
was very little market for his

plays here, and he felt like a man
an audience as
long as he stayeu.

During the early hearings
ol the House Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee. Brecht was
called as a Witness, because his
writings were not above
suspicion. He had the distinction
of being commended by the
chairman ior his cooperation.
when he was asked whether he
had expressed certain thoughts
in his writings, he said he had
not, alleging politely that the
works in question had been
mistranslated. Since the com-
mittee was not prepared to look
at the German, it was the
playwrights’ word against the
translators After the war.
Brecht returned to Germany.
where he directed the theater in
East Berlin until his death in
1956.
