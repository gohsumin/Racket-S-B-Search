New SAGA Checking System Causes Controversy

By Molly McGuIru

Has the Grinnell student ii<
nally been reduced to a num-

her? Is the new checking sys-
tent in the dining halls really
necessary? Or will it even do
the job it has been set up to
do —- namely, keeping the
eighteen students newly-ex-
empted from board lees out of
the dining halls?

These were just a iew at tho
questions raised as the new
checking method went into al-
tect last Monday at Cowles and
the Quad. The system, in at:
oordailce with a provision of the
referendum of last week allow-
log the eighteen exemption, re
quires each diner to give his
meal card number to a check-
er at each meal before eating.
Although this honor . number
system is not as strict as a
meal card presentation system,
it nevertheless is a change irom
the previous relaxed policy or
allowing entrance to the dining
halls without any term oi identi-
ilcation.

According to Business Man-
ager Ralph Poinerenk, both the
business oitice of the college
and Saga saw the need for some
way or checking who ate in the
dining halls, ii any option were
to be put into operation. “When

you have options or paylng
board or not,” Pometznk said,
“you have to have more than
the honor system iii the dining
halls. Saga can't teed everyone
that Comes to the door, and the
college can't administer the
program (of options) unless
there is some system of check-
ing who eats. We can’t aitord
3 ‘Come one, come all’ policy."

Pomerenk said that he had
originally recommended to the
Student Affairs Committee that
ii photo lD card system be in<
stituted, because such a system
would eliminate many prob-
lems created by the number
checking method. But the com-
mittee “worked him down" to
the present “nominal honor and
number" system. According to
Student Coordinator Frank
Thomas, the SAC decided that
the number system would he
the most efficient, yet minimal,
method the college would oc-
cept.

The checking system was
fully described in the referena
dum, and students voted their
approval. But there are come
plaints (presumably by the 700
students who either didn’t vote
or voted against the proposal)
about its very existence, its ei-
iectiveness, and the inconveni-

once it is causing by forcing
students to remember their one,
two or three-digit number and
tell it to a checker in the line.

One irate student voiced tho
complaint that he “didn’t mum
to Grinnell to be a number" and
that now Grinneli has joined
the "number cult" along with
big universities, Those sharing
this view, in order not to be
forced to go against their moral
principals, are allowed to show
the checker their meal card,
and thus bypass identitying
themselves by a number. (Ac-
tualiy, every student is not only
a meal card number, but also a
computer number to the col-
lege.)

Questions have been raised as
to the eiiectiveness of the new
system in keeping out non-
boarders since numbers could
be duplicated at both dining
halls and anyone can use any
number as long as it hasn't
been used already at a parti-
'cular meal. Fomerenk realizes
that the system has "potential

leaks," but none of these weak-
nesses were unanticipated. The
success or the system depends
upon the cooperation or the
boarders, or, as (Saga) Chuck
Hand, Food Service Director,
said, “the system will work as
well as the students want it to
work."

Several dissatisfied students
have suggested that instead or
checking all the diners, pictures
or the 18 be posted in each din-
ing hall, with perhaps a line im-
posed if they should show their
race in either place. The store-
mentioned disgruntled student
explained, “Atter all, we’re not
a vast, faceless mass, and it
isn’t fair to be inconveniencing
1100 people to be convenient ion
18.”

Tlils proposed “mug shot"
system would not be enough,
according to 'Tomerenk and
Hand, because there would be
no assurance that the non<
boarders would be recognized
and identified it they should
show up tor a free meal.

Since the checking system has
been in eiiect only live days,
all has not been said or realized
about it. Pomerenk feels that It
is “shaking down reasonably
well, and will probably gain
more acceptance as checker:
gain more speed.” Hand be<
lieves that like any new system.
It is an inconvenience at first,
but the situation will improve.

while the checking system in
receiving an untavorable stu.
dent response, that response is
not above criticism. Student Co-
ordinator Frank Thomas is “fed
up” with the negative student
response, and maintains that
the uncooperative students
(those refusing to y've their
number or those giving any
thing except their own number)‘
are causing most of tho incon-
venience.

“On a Saga issue." Thomas
assorted, “the student body
generally displays those adole<
scent actions and emotions
which are always expected or
it by the ‘other generation.‘ "

 

Judicial council: Mistrial In Clark Hail Case

By a do vote with one absten<
tion, the student taculty
Judicial Court, in its lirst meet-

ing of the year October 2, heard
the appeal or senior Patrick
Perry and junior Thomas Cole
and reversed a decision made
by the Clark Hall Council last
year, declaring a mistrial.

"The Clark Hall Council of
1968759 violated the judicial
saicguai-ds guaranteed in the
Student Handbook in that it did
not properly notify Patrick
Perry and Thomas Cole or the
hearing May 17, 1969 at which
they were lined," the council
ruled in a statement issued by
its chairman, Asst. Professor
Bernard Mergen (Am. Studies).
“The Judicial Council also finds
that the Clark Hall CounClI de-
layed the hearings unduly from

the time or the incident and
then acted too hastily. The
Judicial Council therefore der
clares a mistrial."

The case stemmed from two
hall parties given in Clark Hall
during the first semester of last
year. The first party, held in
the lounge during midsemester
break, Involved what Art An—
drews, a member of Clark
Hall's Council last year, de-
scribed as “an assault on tha
soia. Several guys were violente
ly jumping up and down on 't.
They even invited the Pagliai’s
Pizza man to join them,"

During exam time, there was
a second party in the rec room
in which two male students
were wrestling on the rug, as
the third, a visitor irom Purdue
University, pelted them with ice
cubes. This party finally re-
sulted in red, blue, and brown
stains on the rug from beer
and crepe paper,

The Physical Plant House-
keeping bepartment notiiied the
then President of Clark Hall,
Jim Sebern. ’69, that $350 in
damages was done to the rug
and Bola, and that the hall was
expected to pay ior the repairs.

Alter $85 was taken from hall
iunds. Sebern brought the mat-

‘ ter of the remaining sum before

the hall council.

in an action on May 17. 1969.
the Council iined‘ each member
of the hall Si, fined each hall
member who had attended
either party $4, and apportioned
the remaining lines to various
individuals according to their
participation in the damaging
activities.

According to Sebern's res
cords, only $25 In tines, paid
by twelve liall members, was
ever collected. Senior David
Petta, last year a member of
Clark said, “There were rumors
of the administration withhold-
ing senior transcripts of those
who wouldn't pay." However,
this action was never carried
out.

Ralph Pomerenk, the college
business manager, commented.
“The fine is Still on the hooks."

Patrick Perry and Thomas
Cole appealed the Clark Hall
Council’s decision in the last
days Of the academic year 1968a
69. Tile Judicial Council, at
that time, decided to hold it
over until the first meeting this
year.

In their ﬁrst meeting the
Judicial Council interviewed the
1968-69 Clark Hall Council: Art
Andrews, John Robinson, Neil
one and Gary Jones. They
reached the decision cited
above. Professor Mcrgen said
that it is now up to the hall
whether there will be a retrial
or not,

Other business of the Judicial
Council at their iirst meeting
was the election of Mergen as
chairman. other members or
the ﬂameniber Judicial Council
are Associate Professor Arnold
Adelberg (Mathematics), Asso-
ciate Protessor Ralph Lueliocn
(Anthropology), senior David
Petta, sophomore Ed DeBus.
and sophomore Nick Russo.

“The JudiCial CounCll is set
up to hear speciiic cases," Mel'—
gen commented when asked to
define the role at the coult’ctl.

' “It is not to make judgments

on college life in general.”
