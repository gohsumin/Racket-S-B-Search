Tankers to Resume
Season Against Coe

Grinnell College's swimmers will
open a four-meet home stand by
hosting the cue Kohawks at 1:30
pm. tomorrow in the college pool.

The meet is the first in nearly a
month and a half for Coach lrv
Simone's Pioneers. They have
shown marked improvement dur-
ing practice sessions during that
span and simone feels they are
ready both physically and mental-
ly for the fast-paced, rugged sche-
dule ahead.

The development of added depth
has been one of the features of the
long break from action and Simone
feels he has 10 men capable of
finishing high in the points in their
events. They are:

Lettermen —- Roger Abendroth,
diving; Tony Horton, backstroke
and sprints; John Kraai, breast-
stroke and individual medley;
Ralph Pray, distance; and Howard
Schein, sprints.

Sophomores Ken Adelrnan,
butterlly; Richard Lance diving
and sprints; Ray L a n g h a m,
sprints: Bill Lontz. sprints and
breaststroke; and Charles Schnell,
distance.

Grinnell will take a H) dual meet
mark into the cue engagement. The
Pioneers topped Augustana 5340
with Pray winning both distance
events and Adelman and Horton
capturing their specialties, the 200-
yard butterfly and zoo-yard hack»
stroke. The AOO-yard medley tour-
same of Horton, Kraai, Adelman,
and Schein also came in ﬁrst.

The medley crew also tapped the
field at the Knox Relays, setting a
new meet record.

Hoping to Cure Second Half Slump,
Cagers Scheduled for Practice Only

A recent scoring drought
triggered by second half slumps
will be the main problem
Coach John Pfitsch Will attempt
to correct during Grinnell’s 3—
week semester test and interim
study break.

’The Pioneer cagers, who are
idle until meeting Augustana
(lll.) on Jan. 30 in a non-con-
ference game, will practice
only about one hour a day dur-
ing the break. Offense will be
the main order of the practice
sessions because of a disastrous
road trip to Minnesota last

weekend that resulted in 19-
and 20»polnt setbacks.

Boasting an 84.5-point aver-
age before the trip, the Pio-
neers saw their point produc-
tion plunge in an 83764 loss to
St. Olaf and an 88-63 defeat to
Carleton.

Successfully slowing down
Grinnell’s pressing, run and
gun game, the Oles and Carls
limited the Piitschmen to 69
and 75 shots. Only once before
had the Scarlet and Black been
held to less than 80 shots.

A second half slump was the
chief villain in each outing.
Ahead only 33732 at the inter—
mission, St. Olaf surged to its
easy win on 67 per cent firing
in the final 20 minutes. At Carl-
eton, the Pioneers could shoot
only 25 per cent after trailing
but 4039 at the midway point.

“Lack of offensive poise,"
Was the way Pfitsch described
it. The sophomore and junior
dominated Pioneers were un—
able to regroup forces and turn
the tide of battle when the vet
eran Oies and Carls began pull-
ing away, he explained.

 

Despite giving up 171 points
in the two outings, Pfitsch felt
Grinnell’s defense was respeCt-
able.

”But, we have got to develop
more offensive poise," he reit-
erated.

Now 3-5 for the campaign
and 273 in the Midwest Confer<
ence, the Pioneers have out<
scored opponents 642-638 and
boast five men in double fig-
ures.

Guard Jeff Frantz is the top
pointmaker with 163 for a 21.0
average. 46- and 37-point
splurges in two games figure
prominently in his total.

Frantz also tops the team in
the rebounding department with
66. Bunched closely behind
Frantz in scoring are center
Jim Rhodes. 93 points and an
11.6 average; guard Elliott
Hibbs 91 points and. an 11.4
average; forward Tom Hill,
89 points and an 11.! average;
and forward - center Clyde
Smith, 81 points and a 10.1 av-
erage.

Forward Ted Risser has
notched 63 markers for a 7.9
average.

Rhodes and Smith rank close
to Frantz in rebounding with
GI) and 57, respectively.
