Grdff lilies being
jatii-oiuall-lrades

At the age of so, when many
men e slowing down in their
aciiy ties and beginning to look
toward retirement, Albert Craft,
0[ 1526 Spencer St., is putting
in a full 70-hour week and .seotrs1
at the idea of cutting don-n. Aft-
er all, how can a man think at
retirement when he has just bee
gun a brand new way oi lite?

In 1954, alter 52 years oi~liiu
ing, working on. and owning‘
farms in Chester township, Grah‘
and his wiie decided to move in-
to Grinnell and leave their son,
Albert. Jr, to run the farm. in
order to l-zeep himseli busy and
provide a small supplemental me
come. heaccepted a light main-
tenance job at Grinnoll College.

Took Job In 1958

In the case oi multitudes oi
younger men, the call of tumors
tunity is met with a deaf ear.
When Al Graii, then as, was of-
iered an opportunity to work
long hours at a strenuous lob,
he jumped at it, In 1953 he as-
sumed his new position of col-
lege athletic equipment manag-
e .
"When I ﬁrst started at the
college I had only planned to
do a little light carpenter work,”
he said, “I never dreamed that
I would end up in charge of the
athletic equipment. Now that i
have the job though, I wouldn‘t
trade with anyone."

Graﬂ‘s office is a 10 by 10 ft.
cubicle at one end of the men’s,
locker room in Darby gym. Dur~
ing the school year it resembles
a cluttered antique shop. ‘

Uniforms of all descl‘ (ions
and sizes hang Irom the Ceiling.
A huge table, which takes up
tho-thirds of the ﬂoor space in
the odice, is heaped high with
equipment ranging from broken
football helmets to unstrung ten»
nis racquets. Under (his tsble
and overﬂowing into the illrdee
ﬁned aisles around it is an in-
describable pile of various ath-
letic sundries which have been‘
collected and dumped there over
the years.

The walls of the “Cage," as it'
is reier d to, are ringed wlIh
ceiling high cabinets ehocked
full of everything from seeks to
shotguns.

Buried in one corner- of this
crowded cage is a heat up old
desk barely discernablc under a
variegated heap of materials,

When the peppery. leathei slime

around his Miles: or involved in
a treated discussion with one of
the many people who stop to
talk, Grari can be lound bent
or his tattered lodgers mut»
tering ineoherencies and seratcln
ine his head.

To the uninilialcd outsider the
Cage would seem as disorganized
as a church rummage sale. To
A] Grail this quasi chaos is as
well organized as the best run
llbtary and has the advantiige ot
compactness. When one of his
spemai boys, the athletes. re—
quests an unusual piece of cquipr

rubble only to re» opeor seconds

In addition to his ohicial due
ties, Al “Cage,” as he is known
on campus, also serves as unoﬂls
cial nurse, chauffeur, seamstress,
and number one Pioneer Ian.

His average work day during
the school year is from 7 am.
to 7 pin, His longest days conic
during the basketball season
when he will oittinies be at
Darby gym irom 8 am. to 11
p.m,

Rather than slowing him
down, this exhausmg schedule
seems to stimulate him.

“Working here at the gym
and being around the boys is
what keeps me young," he notes.
“This job is the kind that one
can never tire of because some.
thing new and unexpected hap»
pens every day.”

When asked about retirement
a look of amazement crosses his
face, almost as it he had never
even considered it as a possi—
bility.

may never be able to get me to
