-—Mni-e, Utopia

“Student government on this
campus ls presently mired In a
Serbonian Eng (see the most
relevant work in the English
language, Paradise Lost, Book
II, 592-603) from which there
appears no immediate escape.
Its legal standing is ambigu-
ous; its political power is vir-
tually non-existent; and the
miasme of conflicting theories,
Incompatible iunctinns, contrary
procedures, and impossible
rules which envelopes the ter-
rain makes it impossible {or
even the most earnest pilgrim
to find his way to higher
ground."

At this juncture, "guiding
philosophy" on our part is sit-
pertluous, "news" reporting un-
necessary, and an attempt at

political analysis oi the situation

irrelevant by the time of puh‘
“cation.
Better luck next week.
Yours truly?
