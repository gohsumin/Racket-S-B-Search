NSA Discontinues CM Support
Grinnell Rep Views NSA Fulure

By Martha Berkey

The disclosure last week that
the National Student Association
has been secretly receiving sub-
stantial funds trom the Central

Intelligence Agency for the last
14 years, has stirred indegent
reaction throughout the organi-
zation and has provoked lurth-
er investigations of CIA pene—
tration in other nonrgovernment<
til associations.

NSA is the nation’s largest
college student group with stu-

dent body membership or about
300 campuses including Grin-
nell. The association operates
on a yearly budget of about
$900,000, $200,000 01 which has
come from the CIA under the
cover oi as private ioundatiun
grant, primarily for use by the
International Affairs branch.
The discovery came in an an
nouncement of an article com-
ing in the March issue of Ram-
parts magazine.

Grimell NSA coordinator Phil
Bertenthol says or the exposed
link-up, "As far as Grinnell
goes, this won't have any aitect
on NSA here. We are involved
primarily in the student-services
angles — the insurance plan,
student lD's, and travel plans.
There are really very low par-
ticipants in the international
activih'es.”

In a statement released by the
National Supervisory Board or
ﬁle USNSA, it said:

We are shocked at the ethi-
cal trap into which young men
or great integrity have been
placed by convert actions or
the cm. Honorable people act-
Ing out of the best or motives
were faced with an impossible
choice: to expose the relation-
ship and thereby harm them-
selves and hundreds of others
or to remain nine: and there-
by be dishonest to new gener-
ations of students.”

Only one or two top oihcers
each year knew about the CIA
funds.

The National Supervisory
board has unanimously ordered
the complete and permanent
severance of all ties with the
CIA.

The State Department in cola
laboratiun with the CIA. issued
the following statement of the
government’s position.

"The purpose of the govern
ment support was to provide
free students with the means
to do the things they would have
done unaided had they had the
funds. Federal support was be-
gun at the peak of the cold war
tor use in Combatting Commu-

nistrlinanced efforts at subver—
sion."

Bertenthal, who was u dele<
gate to the NSA National Con.
gress last summer, said about
that meeting, “I got the im—
pression that there has always
been some suspicion cast on
the international branch affairs,
with the idea that they were
trying to act as a junior state
department.” He expressed
hope that now, with the CIA
lunds cut—oil, the asociatlon
would be able to get funds (or
programs more concerned With
the majority of the student
members. This would include
expansion at student services,
and funds to back the drive for
the 13—year-old vote and civil
rights support “which have
been very much stiiiled by
lack 01 funds,"

At any rate, the NSA-CIA ex.
posure will spark a revealing
investigation into the clande-
stine activities of the Agency.

ultimately, I am even more sick
of listening to often-intelligent
people make excuses for food

Perhaps the meals have at.

they have been so long indoc»

“Dub, well, we can get. lots

Well, surely, that fits into
