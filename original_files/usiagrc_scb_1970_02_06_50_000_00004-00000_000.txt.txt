Instant Ministers in Florida

Rev. Art Fox, 13.13,, and Rev.
Dick Kerekes are two young
actors trom the Miami, Florida
area. They attend acting
workshop in the area and have
appeared in several productions,
television commercials, been
guests on local talk shows, and
are presently scheduled to ap-
pear in a television pilot.

”they became ordained miniss
ters by mail and were granted
a charter to start their own
church: Universal Life Church,
of Custer St. in Hollywood,
Florida. They are quickly gaining
notoriety for their practice of
making anyone an ordained
minister just tor the asking and
a free will oiiering to support the
Church. Fox tells, “Over 265,000
ministers have already been or-
dained.” He adds, “The ULC has
no doctrine itself; it only believes
in that which is right. We recog-
nize everyone’s belief.” Fox
says, “The ordination papers are
legal and are recognized by all
50 states and several foreign
countries." He also says, “You
may perform marriages, bap
tism, funerals, dedications, visit
hospitals and jails.” Kerekes re
veals, “Many modes of trans
portation offer reduced rates

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Part I

by it. c. Apostle

One of the greatest difficulties
in solving a problem, whether it
relates to knowledge or to value
or to action, is a clear and
adequate understanding of the
principles involved. in a science,
without a clear and adequate
knowledge or the principles,
demonstration and richness of
theorems become difficult; in
politics and ethics, without clear
and adequate knowledge of the
ultimate values and the princis
pies in their understanding,
discussion becomes aimless and
even verbal; in action, without
the necessary proper habits,
along with the required knowl-
edge to direct them, a worthy
goal is not easily attained, Our
main concern is the principle
upon which colleges are based,
the one which goes by the name
“Liberal Education.” In this our
first article we shall make some
preliminary remarks about
principles.

Principles are the starting-
points of things or of knowledge
or of action, and they are the
hardest to comprehend or
choose; so it is with good reason
that the ancients considered
them as worth more than half
or the whole. The principle ot a
circle is its definition, and with
out this, knowledge oi the proper
ties of a circle is almost impos-
sible, The principles oi physics
as elements are the ultimate
indefinables (matter, time,
length, and the like), and without
these, definition of the subject
matter and the properties of
physical objects become im-
possible Now, while the prin-
ciples in the natural sciences are
quite accurate, partly because
they are iew, those in the
biological sciences are less ac»
curate, for additional factors
enter into the composition of
living things, and those in the
social sciences and politics are
even more involved for the same
reason. This, however, should not
deter us irom making the best
out of the situation, for while the
value ot one subject may lie in
its accuracy, that of another may

lie in its importance, and both
are desirable. The objects of
mathematics easily lend them~
selves to accuracy, and so
mathematics proceeds to deiinite
conclusions with little hesitation.
Historically, this science was the
iii-st to advance. The objects of
sociology and politics, on the
other hand, are complicated and
vague, Some men even refuse to
colistder politics asa science; but
the political and social upheaval
of our times aild the urgency for
the solution oi such problems
testify to its importance.

Lack of clarity and of
adequacy in principles is
usually reﬂected in the ter-
minology used. in sociology and
politics contrary terms are
usually employed to signiiy
objects with contrary values,
e.g., objects which are either
good or bad, either beautiful or
ugly, either true or false. Such,
for example, are the following
contrarieties: reactionary
progressive, conservatives
liberal, static-dynamic, absolute
relative, tormal-lntuitive,
toleranteiiitolerant, equal rights;
unequal rights. The most recent
colitrariety is the one advanced
by Professor Bowman: Ardent
Lcltist-Archtypal Aristotelian;
perhaps both terms of this can»
trariety are intended to signify
something bad, with good lyi'ng
somewhere in between, One often
condemns the reactionary, or the
conservative, or the absolute, or
the static, but praises what he
considers as progresswe or
liberal or relative or dynamic;
sometimes one does the opposite,
All these terms in the social
sciences are for from being used
clearly but they are often used
without hesitation; and they are
almost as bad as slogans, Their
usageto describe others amounts
practically to name-calling We
may illustrate.

Not all absolutes are false or
bad, nor are all of them true or
good, and the same applies to
all relatives The law of cons
ti‘adicticn iS absolutely true, for
if not, it would be possible, for

example, for a man to be alive
and dead at the same time; and
it you allow the derivative of x2
to be, say, 5x as well as 2x, and
water to have no hydrogen
sometimes, you will destroy
mathematics and chemistry, or
else be prepared to flunk both,
Further, it you want to live, food
and water are absolutely
necessary, and absolutely good.
On the other hand, the contrary
of the law of contradiction is
absolutely false. Total
deprivation or food and water is
absolutely bad [or the con-
tinuation oi life. The same may
be said of relatives, for
corresponding to an absolute
there exists a relative; but we
leave this as an exercise for the
reader, Those who admit only
relatives, we may add, are taced
with a contradiction because they
will have to admit as absolutely
true the statement “no absolute
is true,” for if they do not admit
it as true, they will have to allow
some absolutes, contrary to their
position.

As for equal rights (as against
unequal rights), something which
some students are inclined to
demand in colleges and
universities, this too is vague,
unless further qualified. There is
a political right, and a property
right, and a right based on
knowledge, and other rights; and
it is encouraging to see this
distinction made in this
semester’s first 5&8 editorial.
Now when the term “right” has
been sufficiently defined or
determined in its application,
there is still the problem of
whether the parties to such a
right are equally qualified. it is
the patient’s right to choose a
doctor, but the doctor's right to
deCide 0n the kind of medicine;
it is the student's (or his
parent’s) right to decide on a
college, but the college’s right to
decide on the various college
requirements tor graduation; it
is the citizen’s right to Vote for
a candidate but Coitgress‘ right

to legislate. This does not bar
