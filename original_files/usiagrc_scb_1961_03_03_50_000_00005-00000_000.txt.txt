backciless situation to an even inorel

‘llopeless resolution through a
series of inverted climaxes. Each
peak of emotion draws the
characters tarlher down, finale

llabellcd this “intensity without
polish."

Miss Hansen's portrayal oi
:Julie approached brilliance. i
'was constantly amazed at the
depth and perception of the
characters she achieved.

Mr. Stanley, as Jean, also did
an excellent job.

I telt each time I saw the
play that the separation be«
tween part and actor had dis—
appeared and that both had
succeeded in sriklng a hail»
once between the meaning oi
the port and iorcctul presen—
tation of it, Their responses
to one another were well in-
tegrated and moving.

Miss Autman played her part
too automatically, I thought. she
seemed incapable of handling
the raw emotion of the later
scenes which the other two did
so skillfully.
