Registrar Reveals Grinnell Suffers
From Limited ‘Withdrawal’ Symptoms

In the dead of winter wild
rumors often circulate the
campus about the number of
students Who withdrew or flunked
out of Grinnell during the
Christmas recess. Here are the
statistics according to the
records of the Registrar.

A total of twenty-nine students
withdrew permanently from
Grinnell College after the first
semester. There were seventeen
voluntary withdrawals ( some of
which may be transfers to other
colleges) and twelve academic
dismissals. In addition, 16
students went on either academic
or personal leaves and‘twentyasix
enrolled in oif-campus ACM
programs. Five students com~
pleted their graduation
requirements atmid-year, 0n the
other side of the balance sheet,
twenty-nine students returned
from leaves. The total size of the
student body at the beginning of
the second semester was 1107, of
which 593 were men and 509 were
women. In addition there were
a few special students and a few
unclassified students.

According to Dale Terry,
Registrar and Director oi Adr
missions, about one-third of the
students who leave Grinnell for
any reason before they have
completed their requirements for
graduation normally leave at
midryear. Seventyone students
left after the first semester. Last
year a total of 176 students left
for all reasons. The number of
academic dismissals is higher
than usual for midyear. Three
or four is more typical. Terry
expressed confidence that there
would be fewer such dismissals
than usual after second semester
as a result of this.

Ten years ago the yearly with-
drawal rate was roughly fifteen
percent of the student body.
Between 1961 and 1966 with-
drawals were fairly steady,

Bowers Atquitted
In Assault Trial

The following is the statement
of Judge Lincoln concerning the
trial of the state vs, Edd Bowers:

It is the conclusion of this Court
based on sworn testimony that
a reasonable doubt exists as to
the alleged assault on the person
of Lawrence Frank at the Main
Lounge oi Grinnell College on
December 18, 1969 by the
defendant Edd Bowers.

Therefore the Court finds the
defendant Edd Bowers not guilty
and costs of the action be charged
to Poweshiek County State of
Iowa.

Dated this February 3, 1570.

around twelve per cent per year.
During the last two lull academic
years the withdrawal rate has
again been about fifteen per cent.
At Grinnell one per cent oi the
student body is roughly eleven
students.

Mr. Terry stated some reasons
for the rise in withdrawals during
the last two or three years. First,
the number and capacity of ACM
programs has increased. Second,
the College has relaxed its policy
on granting academic and per-
sonal leaves, He indicated that
there was an unusually high with
drawal rate in 1967-68 (15.7 per
cent) for a number of reasons.
The high withdrawal rate was
partly a fluke and partly an
expression of uncertainty about
the future of the college. The
junior class, which entered in
that year, shows a decided imr
balance in males and femalesglw
males, as females. The junior
class is smaller than the senior
class, which also reﬂects the
withdrawals in 1967-63.

“The great majority of trans»
tags from Grinnell occurs in
freshman and sophomore
women," said Terry. Students
have many reasons for trans-
ferring. Some dislike the social

Honorary Degrees
Voted; Changes in
Credit-Fail Program

Last Monday, the faculty held
their second meeting of this
semester. President Leggett
announced that the following four
men will be offered honorary
degrees at commencement this
spring: Horace Mann Bond, and
three Grinnell graduates:
Messrs. Stoessinger ’50, Mathews
‘20, and Rew ’07. The President
also noted that the current
average faculty-student ratio
was 1:10. In a conversation With
the 5&3, he lamented the fact
that a college the size of Grinnell
cannot afford to maintain for; long
this desirable state of affairs.

The faculty decided to make
several changes in the credit»fail
option program. A student is now
allowed to take courses in his
secondary field with the credit-
fail option. Also, courses in the
ACM Urban Studies Program
and the Colorado College Sum-
mer institute may be taken on
the creditrfail basis and can be
applied to major and secondary
fields,

atmosphere. Others wish to
obtain more vocational training.
Still others, “A" students in high
school, find the academic
competition more intense than
they want Others do not like
living in a small town.

Transferring students tend to
go to universities, which would
be less expensive and larger.
“But when students transfer to
small colleges,” {said
Terry,“they tend to go tu very
good small schools."

The college must get students
to replace those who have with—
drawn. Mr, Terry indicated that
it takes four applications to
replace one student. Since the
college does not get many
transfer students, it is difficult
to restore balance in the various
classes once it is lost, Mr. Terry
predicted that the college will
probably receive between 1350
and 1400 applications for ad-
mission this year. About four
hundred new students will be
admitted. Applications to
Grinnell have been increasing in
recent years, according to Terry,
even though at many schools the
number of applications seems to
be dropping somewhat. In- ad
dition, the percentage of students
who accept admission to the
college once it is offered has risen
considerably during the last five
years. in 1965 it was 42 per cent;
and this has increased by regular
jumps, to 60 per cent last year.
Terry indicated that in this
respect Grinnell compares quite
favorably with the other schools
in the nation.

'The Battle of Algiers':

Anatomy of in Revolution

by Alan G. Nasser
Instructor of Philosophy

,politics is the soul of
everything." Lin Piao, Long Live
Tire Victory of the People‘s War!

During an interspace of
silence, the interviewer John
Swinton interrupted Karl Marx
with the question “What IS?” The
philosopher's reply was swift and
emphatic. Struggle.” If there is
substance to this Marxian social
metaphysic, 'then Gillo Pon-
tecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers
is a stunning depiction of the
ontology of revolution. We see.
in an unprecedented application
of cinema veritE to a recon-
structed historical event, the
heroic and dogged struggle of the
National Liberation Front in the
war for Algerian independence
the French colonialists.

You will find yourself unable
to believe the disclaimer in the
titles that Battle contains NOT

primer for what is to happen in
American cities in the near
future?”

And Battle is not without its
moments of wry irony, When
French paratroopers enter the
city to smother the rebellion, it
is made clear that their com-
mander, colonel Mathieu, was a
hero of the Resistance "They
call us fascists," says Mathieu,
“forgetting that some oi us are
survivors of Dachau and
Buchenwald” a delicate
reminder that yesterday’s
liberals are all too oiten today's
oppressors.

The Battle of Algiers is, in a
number of ways, a paradoxical
film. For it absorbs you totally
and completely, yet it never
appeals to Hollywood’s stock
cinematic formula of absorption,
such as romantic acting
techniques, flashy editing and
cutting, and rapidly sentimental
dialogue. It will drain you
emotionally, perhaps as no other
film ‘has. You will see Grinnell’s
favorite formula film, The
Pawnbroker. as a soap opera by

has actors, but no acting. The
Pawnhrpher presens an entirely
superficial treatment of a tragic
situation, and tricks you into
drinking that you have tran-
scended your customary mode of
awareness by manipulating your
emotions with Hollywood's most
familiar techniques. Battle
