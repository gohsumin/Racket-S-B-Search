First Coed Fetzer Sing ts Scheduled
April 25 to Modify School Tradition

Saturday evening, April 25th,
will mark the 29th annual Fet—
zer Sing. For the first time in
the history of this event, North
and South Campuses have
combined and the competition
will be between mixed chorus-
es.

Fetzer Sing had its begin-
nings in the 1939’s when, with
the help of the women’s glee
club, the women of the Quad-
rangle held annual singing con-
tests. These were held on May
Day, outside of the Quadrangle,
usually on the steps of Main
Hall. John C. Fetzer, men vice
president of Grinnell, was en-
lhusiatic about the event and
wishing to make the program
an all-campus activity, he en-
couraged male participation.
He donated a trophy for the
men, which has passed from
hall to hall since then. During
the war, when the men were
away, the annual sing lost its
male voices, but was revived
after they returned. Fetzer Sing

 

evolved into a Mother's Day
program in which the town of
Grinnell and parents of students
could come to enjoy special
entertainment. More recently,
for practical considerations,
students have felt it; should not
be held so near the end of the
school year.

Since 1935, there has been
some type of intramural sing-
ing competition on the Grinr
nell campus. The main idea he-
hind the program was to pro-
vide an opportunity for students
to enjoy singing together.

During the last four years,
Fetzer sing has been held dii-
terently each year. This year’s
senior class, as freshman, par-
ticipated in an all-campus Fet-
zer Sing held in the afternoon
of Mother’s Day. All of the
women’s halls competed for the
South Campus trophy and the
men’s halls competed for the
North Campus trophy. in 1962
the singing competition was be-
tween women’s hallsonly, and

 

The formal, Hartl said, was
changed from its traditional
date, the night before the be-
ginning or spring vacation, to
take advantage of the warmer
weather and to get the band.
He said the administration also
preferred that the dance be at
another time.

Hartl announced the mem-
bers of the social coordinating
committee, which plans the
campus social programs. and

last year only between the
men’s hallsi

During me initial planning
last semester for the 1964 Fet~
zer Sing, it was suggested that
Fetzer Sing be competition be-
tween mixed choruses. This
suggestion was met with ep-
proval by both North and South
Campuses, and it was an-
nounced that Fetzer Sing would
be a coed event for the first
time in its history.

Since this is the first time
the program has been held in
this way, certain changes have
been necessary. Mr. and Mrs,
Norman Goodbrod, who have
long been associated with Fet-
zer Sing as judges and as in-
terested faculty members, have
agreed to be faculty sponsors.
Not only have they helped the
Fetzer chairmen plan creative-
ly for this year’s event, but
have insured continuity by in-
terpreting the original spirit of
the event to the students.

Since North Younker won the
men’s trophy in three consecu-
tive years, the North Campus
trophy has been retired. A new
trophy as well as plaques for
second and third place winners
will be awarded. The following
pairings have been arranged:
Gates - Loose, North - Read,
SouthAHaines, RawsonJames,
Cowles - Cleveland, Langan—

cial coordinator, are Steve
