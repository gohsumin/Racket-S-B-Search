Concluding his lecture, James
related the story of a small
Negro child who had gone up
to a man with multi—colored
balloons, and asked him if the
black balloon would rise as high
as the others, The experiment
was tried, and the black bal-
loon rose equally high as the
others.

The point of the story was,
James musedV “It ain’t the
color that counts, It's the stqu
inside that makes it rise."

N0 BETTER HAS TROUBIES

By JOHN WILES

The premiere of Robert Ing-
ham’s No Better was, at best,
a tedious evening of unfulfilled
potentialities. At worst, suffi-
cient potentialities just were not
there within the play itself.

No Better ooncems a Jim
Crow regiment during the Ko
rean War, although the work
lacks a basic focus of dramatic
conflict and development,

There is a morphine-addicted
medic who is out of morphine
and on the verge of going cold
turkey. There is a corporal
from Cleveland who doesn’t
know quite what to make of
the company oi Negro attitudes
in which he ﬁnds himself.

There is the White lieutenant,
who recognizes that to be lead-
er of the regiment he must
"get to” its soul leader. There
is a rebellious Negro private,
a coiled spring of bitterness
who wants to help the medic,
challenge his white command-
er, and also get the hell out of
the war and the defense of I
country he clearly hatesr

Yet nothing really happens,
True, there is some “meaning-
lul dialogue" exchanged There
are two deaths There is some
attempt to impose symbolism

in terms of the Korean cause it-
self.

it doesn’t hang togetherr

Bill Saylor has never offered
such an interesting perform-
once; one wishes that the part
of Lt, Porter ottered as much
to interest the audience.

Grady Murdock had trouble
with cmoting, but was outstand-
ing in the medic's moments of
humor.

Henry Wingate displayed real
acting talent, although he had
precious few moments in which
to display it.

Lou Kelley ranged from we-
some to awkward as Private
Brown. It seemed to be Lhe
kind of part which Kelley
should have been able to grab
hold of with effective impact.

The fault lay with the play;
Kelley was shot down long be-
fore‘his character’s death, With
little responsibility being as-
signable to him.

in fairness, there were very
bright moments — two of them.
One was a recollection by
Brown of a Negro preacher’s
firerandrbrimstone sermon. The
other involved the antics of the
