The Minority Speaks Out Le++er From

On Tuesday, May 5th. 1970, at
a special iaculty meeting, a
majority of the faculty passed a
resolution condemning what it
termed “official repression" in
the disaster at Kent state and
linking this with the military
action in Cambodia and the
policies ot the present national
administration. The motion was
substantially the same as that
brought to the taculty by some
Students, who claimed to
represent a majority oi those
attending a meeting in South
Lounge. The number of students
was, we were told, somewhere
between 300 and 400.

Despite these figures, the
resolution claimed to represent
“the majority of the faculty and
students.” Furthermore, the
iaculty extended this claim to
represent ”Grinnell College as an
institution.”

The joint iacultystudent
resolution, then, claims to be
representative in two ways, and
both ways are, in the judgment
of the undersigned, ill founded.
But it is the second claim —- to
being representative of “Grinnell
College as an institution” 7 that
merits censure, and we are ape
‘pealing to you. the trustees, to
make that censure We argue as
follows:

1. Although the meeting was
well attended by faculty and

s:

administration, there were no
representatives of the trustees,
the parents, or the alumni.

2. The claim by one part oi
the institution to represent the
whole institution necessarily
involves those who dissent; and
such a claim is especially unfai'i
when many members of the ins
stitution had no voice at all in
the proceedings

3. The majority resolution is
highly political in nature 7 an
unprecedented and, in our view,
an improper kind oi resolution
for a college to make.

4. By suspending classes as a
part or the resolution, the iaculty
placed those who wished to
dissent in an impossible position
morally and, perhaps, legally.

5. By linking together diverse
issues, and by failing to revise
die extreme language oi the
resolution, the majority
prevented a rational conclusion
irom being reached.

We would iurther point out that
the temper oi the meeting was
highly emotional, so much so that
the majority openly violated a
long-standing tradition oi the
College; to respect the rights of
the individual conscience,

We therefore wish to dissociate
ourselves from the resolution,
and we request that the trustees
make a similar statement
available to public notice.

A symbolic Commencement was held on Central Cum-
pus May 13. Five students — Susan Fowler. Jonathan
‘Jenltins. Helen Lindblom, Arthur Searie, and Sharon
Vander Jug! — and (our faculty members — H. G.
Apostle. John Crossen. Edwin Kulawiec. and Ralph
Luehhen — attended. Several other students and facul-

SGA President’s Statement

Because oi my role as chair
man in the various meetings that
have taken place recently I have
not been in a position to state
my views on the issues before
us. However, in my role as 5.0.
a. President i feel it my respon-
sibility to state those views,

We have reached a critical
point in our history. Decisions are
being made and will continue to
be made in the near future which
will determine what path our
nation will follow ~ self-deter-
mination or intervention abroad.
liberty or authority at home,
indeed, freedom or repression in
all our actions. These are the
Choices.

In light of these events it is
necessary now that Grinnell Col-
lege leave the ivory tower oi
academia and engage itseli in the
struggle at hand. This departure
from formal academic endeavor
will necessitate sacrifice by all
members of this institution. But
diese sacriiices pale when com.
pared with the sacrifices exacted
by our nation oi the young, the
dissident. and people oi color all
overtheworld,

For these reasons I whole-
heartedly support the Thomas
proposal.

Facul’ry Head
On Closing

To tiic President:

To summon, to order, to
elucidate the events, the factors,
the elements which led, over a
period oi iivc days, to the
decision of Grinnell College on
8 May to terminate its academic
year on 13 May, sixteen days
before its scheduled Commencer
ment, would be a lengthy and de-
manding task. Many and varied
and complex were the events, the
factors, the motives, the states
or mind which ted, or con»
ditioned, or informed the act.

But in my own Case, the con-
cern which rose, so to speak, to
the top as l approached the meet
ing of the Faculty on 8 May was
that which I there articulated:

" . , . The College cannot permit
itself as a college to be so
politicized, nor indeed appear in
the public eye to be so politicized,
that its abiding purposes are
nullified and its effective func-
tioning as a locus or tree inquiry
is precluded or impaired The
College cannot today convert
itself into a political ground, be
it a real political battleground or
a mere political playground, and
expect tomorrow to resume its
stance of disinterested Search, of
measured deliberation, of
hospitality to the widest range
of ideas alld opinions and to their
written and spoken expression.

“1 have come, over the last two
days, slowly and reluctantly to
the conclusion that circum-
stances without and within the
College, the events of the last few
days here, and the present
temper and temperature oi the
student body, as l assess them.
so seriously limit our freedom oi
maneuver and action that the
College must close its doors to
protect the very existence or its
educational house. True, in so
doing it cannot continue to fulfill
completely its contract with
students for instruction and in
quiry under conditions congenial
to instruction and learning (and
this . . . I deplore and profoundly
regret), but in not so doing, 1
fear that the College forecloses,
or may ioreclose, the possibility
oi writing any future contracts
it can pcriorm with honor and
effectiveness.

“I support the recom-
mendation of the President and
the Trustees and I urge upon the
Faculty its acceptance."

Today, 7 days later, I remain
convinced that the action of a
May was the proper one. As I
see it, the move may well have
saved the College; in any event,
it saved the chance to save the
College,

President's
Statement 1

To Parents

As you have probably heard,
either directly from your son or
daughter or indirectly through
news reports, we are closing the
College oliicially at 5-00 PM. on
Wednesday, May 13, This is two
days beiore the formal ending of
classes, as previously scheduled,
so that only the period ot iinal
examinations and com
mencement activities could have
remained. The copy of my iormal
statement to iaculty and students
on this matter is enclosed. The
faculty voted 91-4 to support it
in a separate meeting. At a
general faculty and student
assembly held Friday aiteriioon,
the student vote to support the
statement was virtually
unanimous.

The reasoning behind my
statement is essentially as
follows: No matter hoiv one may
regard the attitude oi students
both here and throughout this
nation, toward the Cambodian
affair and the Kent State in
cidcnt, it is a fact that almost
all students, irom dcctrinaire
radicals to conservatives, have
suddenly become so politically
involved that they are no longer
able to give proper concentration
to their academic studies. On this
campus, as on many others, their
attention over the past two weeks
has been almost completely
diverted into discussions and
activities about the political
crisis. In some educational in-
stitutions, as you know, this
activity has taken Violent forms.
Though there have been some
threats of such violent activity
here, it has not yet happened;
demonstrations here have been
disruptive in only a minor way.
But the important fact, as I say
in the statement I enclose. is that
the existing atmosphere and
temper make it impossible to
continue the normal and
traditional functions of the
educational institution. Aer
cordingly, I believe it is best to
close ﬂ'le school and permit
students to carry on their
political activity elsewhere than
on this campus, not under what
might be interpreted as the
authority, formal or informal, of
the College itself.

it 1 were talking here about
something less than the great
majority of Grinnell students, I
would have recommended to the
faculty and students that
alternative ways be initiated oi
approaching the problem of
completing the school year, so
that those students who wished
to complete their school year in
a regular fashion could do so. But
I think that the present en-
vironment does not allow for such
an option, rational and proper as
the case for it may appear to
those who believe the College
ought to be able to manage it.

No. IS

President's
Statement 2

To Faculty and Students

Recognizing the grave political
and educational crisis which this
nation and this college presently
face. I believe that the College
cannot continue to carry on its
llormal and traditional functions
in the next two weeks. I recognize
the desire and the need of inv
dividual members of the Come
munity to participate in non-
violent and informational
political activities, and by sus»
pending normal activity {or the
remainder of the current
academic year we allow indi-
vidual members of the come
munity to engage in such ac-
tlvitics,

After consultation with the
Chairman of the Board of
Tmstees and other members of
the Board, I am therefore recom»
mending to the Faculty that
classes be suspended for the re
mainder oi the academic year
and that the campus be officially
closed at 6:00 p.m. on Wed-
nesday, May 13.

This means that: 1) there will
be no final examination period
this year 2) there will be no
Commencement activities this
year 3) that by the period be
tween now and May 13th students
will have the opportunity to meet
with their instructors to work out
arrangements for the conclusion
of their academic responsibilities
under conditions which Dean
Wall will discuss 4) that individur
al Grinnell students will have the
opportunity to engage in
educational and informational
activities of their own choosing
until the date oi closing.

Regrettably, the College cannot
manage it without using a means
of pressure or enforcement that
it neither can use nor coun-
tenance using.

In the iive days between the
suspension of classes (that is,
from Friday, May a, through
Wednesday, May is), our major
etiorts are being directed toward
interviews with faculty and
students about academic
decisions involving individual
students. As the enclosed
statement indicates, we intend to
do everything possible to see that
equitable arrangements in.
volving all aspects of student
welfare, academic and other-
wise. are completed.

I ask for your understanding
in this time of great distress for
the College and its Con-
stituencies.

sincerely.
