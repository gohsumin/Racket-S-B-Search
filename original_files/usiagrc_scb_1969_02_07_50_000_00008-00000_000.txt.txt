large increase in the number of men
who refuse to register or who turn in
their draft Cards. (5) There were repeats
ed calls for an amnesty for all those who
have turned in their draft cards and
gone to prison, all those in the armed
forces who have refused to fight and.
have gone to military prisons, and all
those who have deserted to Sweden ra-
ther than remain in the armed forces.

Action? Two things were done
which I guess could be called action.
One afternoon We all ambuloted over
to the plush and heauu'rul Senate
and House offices and spoke to our

respective Congressman. personally
i was, not surprisingly, frustrated.
i saw Sen. Miller and my “Repre.
sentative” from the district in New
York state in which I live. and both

were equally ignorant of conditions
in the developing nations and ap-
parently unwilling to think over any
opposite views. However others did
have some success, and those peo-
ple who visited Sen. Hughes were
very impressed with his seemingly
sincere compassion and understand
lug. Overall I would say there was
some effect, but my cynical nature
toward Congress as a whole forces
me to add “very little and very tem<
porarily."

The other action, which I felt to be
more important and personally rewards
ing, was a march to the Justice depart
ment steps, led by Mrs. King and Mr.
Cottin, at which place Mrs. King spoke.
it was a moving and inspiring service,
but I have no idea what effect it had
on the government minds. Perhaps it
this action helped to give the people the
strength to work at the revolution upon
returning home, then it was a success.

Uncompromising Arlisl Presents New Jazz

By GARY GIDDENS

Cecil Taylor, pianist, composer, poet,
and allramund musical guru tor the jazz
advance guard, will he on campus Feb-
ruary 6, 7, 8. Leonard Feather has writ<
ten of him, “The lreedom, complexity,
harmonic innovation and emotional bril-
liance of Taylor’s playing have estab-
lished him as one of the truly original
minds in American music . . Taylor‘s
fast and intricately structure lines, al-
most percussive in their intensity, have
had a stirring effect on the new horn
techniques of the 60's . . A lack of ac-
ceptance by some musicians and critics
and pitifully infrequent opportunities to
record, have kept Taylor‘s reputation and
following limited to a small but devoted
group of admirers"

That's not the half of it, Taylor has
been screwed royally by club owners
who were more interested in selling
drinks then providing a free rein for ar<
tlstic expression, Record companies have
used him for a tax loss and don’t both-
er to distribute. in this, Taylor Is not
unique. 0n the contrary, there are very
few—jazz musicians who have not suf-
iered under a similar strain of capita-
lism. The new jazz is the bastard child
of American music: it can't make it
on a popular music level and it is not
accepted by the classical elitists. Taylor,
however, is an uncompromising artist
who puts his craft first and refuses to
kiss the asses of the money grabbing
critics and hucksters who control the
(gasp) “muslc business." Unfortunately,
the payoff at times was one major gig
a year supplemented by working at
Macy‘s ln the afternoons

And now‘twelve years after his first
major date in New York — the critics and
the public who criticized him as being a
charlatan and anti-jazz are coming
around Cecil Taylor is a virtuoso planist
who unlike many of his imitators—some
of whom are better known than he—can
express on the keys what‘s happening in
his head. And that's what jazz is about
—expresslon and communication. This

doesn't mean that he is any more ac»
cepted by the public. Last August, he
despalred as to whether he would ever
record again. Those who have heard him,
know that if ln a hundred years some
historian asks whether people in the
20th century could communicate, Cecil
and some other musician like him will
serve as one at the new affirmative ans-
wars.

Previously our ideas of time and space
have been negated in favor of a collec<
tlve sound emanating from individual
musicians surrendering their individual-
ity to a group feeling This music is not
intended for background music; it is a
total music.

During their stay here, the Cecil Tay-
lor Unit Will be available to the entire
campus for discussion, etc, Thursday at
4:00 p.m. there will be a lecture-discuss
slon. Friday at 8:00 pm. there will be a
drum workshop and at 10:30 pm. a
poetry reading by Taylor, All of these
events will be in the South Lounge. The
concert is in Roberts, Saturday nlght at
8:00 p.m.

Open up your mind and give them some
of your time. They're worth listening to.
