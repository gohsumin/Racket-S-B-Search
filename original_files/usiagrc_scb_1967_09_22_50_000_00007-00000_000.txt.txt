) DRUGS

(Continued from Page 6)

investment are needed tn devel-
up a new drug. And with the
normal life span 0: a drug last.
ing only live to ten years, it
is not surprising, says Dr. Long,
that small drug companies are
disappearing, and schools are
no longer producing new niedit
cities. However, industry is car-
rying on research, and many
surprising developments have
come of it.

Dr. Lung also discussed the
pharmaceutical house, and its
method or discovering, produc-
ing, marketing and testing a
new drug. He made it clear
that great care was taken to
insure that nu adverse effects
at the drug would harm the
individual.

Towards the end of the lace
ture a question was raised as
to the great diiierences in price
between generic drugs and
brand name drugs. Dr. Long
indicated that the Cost of con<
stant research [or new drugs
demanded the high cost at
brand name drugs, and, though
it was possible that the drug
companies enuld turn over their
research to the government
and manutacture drugs at a
lower cast, he didn’t believe
that government research would
be as rewarding as industrial.
