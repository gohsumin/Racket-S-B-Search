“Snowangel” Bombs; “Chairs" Frenzied and Strong

A Review by MARY MALCOLM

Carlino’s “Snowangel” and Ionesco’s "The Chairs"
opened Tuesday evening before a very uncomfortable
audience. “Snowangel,” directed by Tanya Hovanessian,
was a tedious and awkward presentation of a somewhat
trivial play. Miss Hovanessian’s blocking was inadequate
for the arena theatre. The two actors tended to take posi-
tions and keep them during long monologues, leaving the
audience to look around at a very untidy stage set.

Ken Hicks as John never
seemed to get started in the
role he was playing. It may be
partially attributed to the tact
that it was opening night. Hicks
relied too much on minor at-
lectatlons like tumbling with his
cigarette, jerking his chin, swal-
lowing trequently in a strained
manner. He gave an over-all
impression of a fumbling and
nervous actor rather than a
rumbling and nervous character.
tricks and Brenda Thomas, as
Connie, tailed to direct their
acting at one another, perhaps
because the two characters in
the play tail to communicate or
be really aware of each other.

Miss Thomas acted well at
any given instant, but with a
general inconsistency that spotl-
ed her performance. She chose
to portray Connie as a very
changeable, hot-tempered char-
acter, but did so with more
jerklms than flexibility.

“The Chairs” was uncomfor~
table for the audience also, but
in the way that ionescan drama
intentionally is. J. Dennis Rich
directed the workshop with a
rare combination of creative
Itaging and precise timing, His
use of sound effects in the door-
bell scene was very effective.
Rich took full advantage of the

{eculiarities oi the arena them.

as more effective in “The
, hairs" than i have ever seen
it previously. There was a cer-
tuln stamina in Rich’s produc<
um allowing every moment to

be prolonged just a little too
long and carried a little too tar.
The play was too much of a very
good thing. The “overproduc-
ing” or the play heightened both
its comic and disturbing as
pects.

Rich achieved a symmetry
between his characters both in
their strength as actors and

DeGoulle Dilemma
At IRC Opener

The dilemma oi Charles De-
Gaulle will be explored by Dr.
Carl - Christoph Schweitzer at
a pm. Thursday in Roberts
Theatre. A native of West
Berlin, where he is currently
Chief of the Division [or Mass
Media, Dr. Schweitzer will
speak on “GermanyADeGaulle-
Europe." All informal coffee

sored by the International Re-
lations Club, will follow the lec-

Schweitzer graduated irom
Oxiord University with degrees
in philosophy, history and pol-
itical science. An active mem-
her at the German Foreign Pol-
icy Association and the Council
for Christians and Jews. he has
served as member of the local
town council in Potsdam, reps
presenting the Social Democra-
tic Party.

Jones as the old man first ap-
peared on the stage and con<
tinuing until the double suicida
was kept up remarkably well
by the actors, Jones' perfor-
mance was more than oom-
patent. He was strong in the
beginning with his description
of the motion 0! the World ”a-
round and around and around"
and he did not falter in the re
mainder oi the performance.

Miss Tinker’s acting was also
excellent. My only criticism is
that she was playing the same
role, that of a demented old
woman, as she played in “The
Phys' Sts” and “The Dream
Play" last year. I suggest di-
versity for Miss Tinker, whose
talent in this Speciﬁc kind of
role is established, Her contro
versial ﬂirtation with the photo-
engraver was a piece oi bril-
liant pantomime and was con-
sistent with the tone of Rich's
production.

Confused

By HENRY WILHELM

Wednesday night’s A r e n a
Theater presentation of Eugene
Ionesco's “The Chairs" did not
go on as scheduled. The audi-
ence had just returned irorn the

~ intermission ioilowing the ﬁrst

presentation of the evening,
“Snowangel,” by Lewis John
Carlino, when the following
statement was read: “Mr. Mey-
er and the administration feel
that: ‘The Chairs’ as it was
presented last night is not fit (or
the Grinneil audience. The
people involved in this reel that
the show cannot be presented
in a restricted form. Under
these circumstances we tee]
that we cannot honestly present
the play and therefore regret-
fully announce its cancellation '

Following the previous night:
performance Mr. Richard Mey-
er, Director of Theater, told
Dennis Rich, director of the
play, that it could not be pre-
sented again in the same form
due to the “gross and lewd"
handling of one of the scenes.

The rules change recoin.
mendation which came from
the AWS-CniHP, relaxes dress
regulations for the Quad din-
ing room. Discussion raised
only minor objections from a
tew senators who felt that
perhaps 5 e n a t e approval
should be withheld to encour-
age further amendment which
would completely ellminato
coat and tie rules {or men.
The amendment, which has
been in effect on a trial basis
since the beginning of the se<
mester, requires skins tor
women and coats and ties for
men to be worn only at sit-
down meals and Saturday din-
ner. This measure represents
a substantial liheratinn from
previous rules, under which
casual dress at the Quad was
acceptable only at hreaktast.

In the only other business of
the meeting, the Senate unani-
mously voted $250 to Gadabouts
for Homecoming. 5175 to NOUS,
$200 to the National Student As-
sociatian, and $337.50 to be held
in General Budget and Reserve,
NSA chairman Phil Bertenthal
explained that the $200 allot-
ment would go to cover regional
conference and national con-
vention expenses for Grinnelt
delegates.

In other reports, AWS Presi-
dent Karen Lauterbach an~
nounced the end of freshmen
hours and a change in tire drill
procedure. The new l‘icy, she
explained, is that “fire drilil
are fire drills, not bedchecks."
They will occur once each se<
master.
