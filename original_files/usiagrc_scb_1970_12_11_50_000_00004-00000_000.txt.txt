IM Chairmen NotOn The Ball Aqua—Jocks L059 With Humor

the 5&8.
Re: IM Chairmen

For a volleyball match sch~
eduled to begin at 8:00 p.m.
on Thursday, December 3,the
nets were not up at the arris
val of the two teams, the balls
were not available until 8:30,
and the cards on which to re-
cord the results were not dis
tributed until the eventual ar-
rival of Dick Pipe at about
9:30. On Tuesday, December
8, for a 7:00 p.m. volleyball
match, the nets again had to
be put up by the two teams,
the Volleyballs were "found"
in an open locker instead of
being handed out by a respon-
sible authority (the word found
is used because no instruc-
tions were given to the teams
as to the whereabouts of the
balls), and the cards to record
the scores were still net av’

Profs Swamp league; We Need New IM System

The final 1M sport ofthe sem-
ester, Volleyball, roared to a
close this week, with Read
holding on against West and
Smith to stay in first place.
Read's record of43- Sput them
first in the overall standings,
which don’t include gamesag-
ainst the Profs. It‘s a good
thing for a lot of teams be
cause the Profs, led by such
terrifying husband and wife
combinations as the Kexels,
the Ericksons, and the Wor-
leys, were tearing up the lea-
gue. They beat Read 51; they
beat second place Clark 4-2;
and they beat fourth place
Smith 5-1. The only team to
get the better of them all
season was third place West,
who won 5-1, and diatnight the
Profs were only able to field
one team because many of
their players were getting ti-
red of showing up and finding
no opposition. ‘

ailable when the two teamshad
completed the match and left.
The IM Chairmen’s duties
concerning volleyball are to
1), see that the netsareput up
on time 2), supply the volley-
balls 3), be sure that cards to
record the results of the
games are available. Either
Craig Gordon, or Dick Pipe,
or both were negligent in all
three of the above duties to
some degree. We feel that the
Hvi Chairmen have entered into
a binding agreement to serve
the students of the College.
They have breached that
agreement, and if they do not
intend to honor itin the future,
they should resign from the
job of IM Chairman, andallow
someone willing to accept the
duties to take over.

So what’s all thismean? That
our older and wiser teachers
are more physically fit than
we are? i don’t think so. The
Profs come out for the fun of
playing, not just to win games.
There seems to be something
lacking in the hallrbased syS‘
tem of intramural compatition
when there are as many for
feits as this year's volleyball
season has seen. Only three
halls were able to complete
the entire season without a
forfeit.

There has been some talk {1*
oating around the elite IM cir-
cles about conducting an ex
perimental interestgroup lea-
gue for basketball. What this
means is that the hall teams
would be scrapped and any
group of 6* 10 guys could or-
ganize their own independent
team. This would allow for
such teams as Saga Cowles,
the Clark Preps, Black stud-

The Panthers from UNI gut-
tered the Grinnell Aqua‘jocks
as they took home the team
trophy at the First Annual
Pioneer Relays. They (UNI)
proved to be too deep in cap-
able swimmers, in that Grins
nell took first place in five of
the nine relays and did notwin
the meet.

The final tallies were UN!

2. Grinnell winners were in
the 400 yd. medley relayi(Br-
ammer, C.D. Meyer, Dale,
and Rollins); the 180 yd. sprint
relay, (Ward, Swacky, and
Rollins); the Diving, (Pontoon,
and Burton); the 300 yd.
Breast-stroke relay, (Mark
Williams, Thomas Gibbions,
and C.D. Meyer); and the 400
yd. free relay, (Mike Daley,
Swacky, Ward, and Rollins).

The meet was not all drab,
as Grinnell introduced some
new twists to its Grinnell tra-

ents, History Majors, Cleve-
land Hall Freaks, etc. Instead
of playing with the guys you
happen to live with, you could
play with the guys you do
things with, the guys you would
like to get out on the basketr
ball court and jag with. Any
hall could still organizea team
if it liked, but there would be
more freedom, which is what
everybody seems towant these
days.

I think this is basically a
sound idea. Sure, itwouldpre-
sent lots of problems, like
some teams are going to be a
lot more skillful and compe»
titive than others, and the tier
centralization of power is go-
ing to necessitate a lot more
work organizing the sport; but
the IM Directors seem willing
to give it a whirl. It may just
be the best thing that has hit
Grinnell intramurals since the
days of the Smith Machine.

ditions (7). Coach Obe wore
his new Tie-dyed Trshirt of
numerous colors. On the back
it pronounces him Coach of
the "Grinnell Freaks” much
to the Team's delight. Truly
a Grinnell Experience to bee
hold.

Other humorous activities
included trophies that were
small mugs, that Coach
Pfitsch thought might be in~
ducive to consumption of ale
coholic beverages. Diane Win~
ters gave out appropriate ins
structions of use as shehand-
ed them out, though.

Outstanding performances
were turned in by both divers,
probably because no one told

Pontoon he was supposed to
lose. C.D. Meyer came out
for the team on Wednesday,
after a year layoff, and turned
in two outstanding performs
ances, being the winningstim-
ulus on the 400 yd. Medley
and 300 yd. Breaststroke re-
lays. In between his events he
went to Loose and watched the
football game on the tube.
All in all it was a good meet
but the team lost to a better
team. The Aqua-jocks have
all Christmas vacation to lick
their wounds and try to do it
right the next time in the
Grinnell Relays on January

23,1971..... The Fish

BB Team loses A Few,
But Still Has Hopes

It's getting so thateither this
writer should stop making
predictions, or Grinnell‘s
teams should stop pussyfoot-
ing around and start living up
to their potential. My record
as a prophet has now gone to
0’3 (1 don‘t think i could beat
the Bear) since the Grinnell
disasters at Millikin Univer-
sity and at Central. Ian-l told
that l underestimated the Milr
likin five (that‘s what happens
when one operates without an
effective scouting staff). ln~
deed, now I'm told that Grin-
nell simply is not in the same
class as Millikin and that,
were the Millikinites in the
Midwest Conference, lheyWOr
uld dominate year after year.
It is somewhat mollifying to
know that one has been crushr
ed by class.

The Central game was an—
other matter. Perhaps the Pia
oneers were just ”down”from
their devastation by Millikin.
At any rate, even the players
admit they had a bad night (as
was born out by the box scor
res: Grinnell had nobody sco~
ring in double figures, while
Central had three people sco—
ring 20 or more),andthatthey
should have won. Unfortun‘
Yately, even losses that should
have been wins go down in the
record book as losses.

The next event on the Hoopr
sters' itinerary is the Holiday
Tournament at Colorado. As T

said last week, the only come
petition here, aside fromalti-
rude, is Knox. Thus, I shall
stick my neck out one more
time and renew my prediction
of a Grinnell victory. The
Pioneers should knock Knox
for the championship.

In spite of the disasters at
Millikin and Central, thereare
several factors which justify
my continued faith in the plays
ers of Grinnell. Among these
are “Kraut" Kraut, Greg
"the Beck" Beckman,Quinton
“Super—Q" Phea. and
” “ Patterson. Th—
ere is no doubt thatGrinnell’s
performance against Millikin
was impaired by the absence
of Patterson, out with the
SAGA flu, and of Fhea, who
was unable to attend anumber
of early practices. Both were
back for the game against
Central and performed solid-
ly, with Super-Q winding up
as one of the high scorers for
Grinnell. As they play more,
they will improve consider”
ably and be of invaluable ser-
vice to the Pioneers. The
Kraut and Beclcman were high
scorers for Grinnell against
Millikin with 25 and lUpoints,
respectively, and both came
back against Central to give
strong performances inspite
of the 83* 50 loss. Grinnell can
still win it all, if they start
playing the way they should.
