With all the emph'asis placed on winning, it is n won-
der that no one has yet complained that the purpose of
the intramural program at Grinnell is being destroyed
For. as Mr. John C. Trucsdole (physical education), director-
of IM athletics says, “it is designed for all those boys not
in intercollegiate athletics who are physically able to par»
ticipate."

We do realize that each hall has a natural desire to
win, but this certainly does not arouse the fact that the
spirit of HTS is stiffled in the maJOi spring sport, softball.

In each of the other major sports, football, volleyball
and basketball, a simple method of free substitution is in

effect, enabling any hall to allow as many boys as they‘

wish to parti pate in each contest. Granted, this is more
difficult to arrange in a sport played like softball, but at
least and attempt at a solution should be made. Unfortunate-
ly, as it stands now, softball is virtually a teneinan sport.

John Husted, 1M chairman of Cowles, has devised a
sensible, limited substitution plan that could easily be in-
corporated into the softball rules. However, to hear some
of the other 1M chairmen talk, one would think that they
were managers of professional teams who would lose their
jobs if their team lost too many games, especially if the
losses were to the second string players of other hulls who
would be given the opportunity to participate that they
would otherwise not have under the present rules.

By Husted's plan, five or six athletes would be
designated as special substitutes “110 would be able to
repl a starter once. The starter could return to the
‘gnm‘e t a future time. this happening only once. The still
would have to play at least one full inning. When the
starter returned to the game, he would go back to his

ml spot in the batting under to prevent unfair
stacking of teams in late innings. Of course, additional
substitutes could replace other starters who could not re-
turn to the game as is the case now.

Only two objections were voiced to the pin The first
was it fear that scoring would become too complicated, but
this problem would be minimized because the new rule
“ould involve limited substitution.

The second obiection was that the plan 'did not follow
the normal rules of baseball. This logic is completely
invalid because there is no reason why we at Grinnell must
allow it rule ncccs y to the profs. ioniil sport to inter-
fere with our effort to make the 1M program what it
should be, open to all. .

Because it will broaden IM’s, Trucsdalc favors the
change in the softball rules, and hopes that a solution
. to the scoring problem will be worked out.
