Faculty Approves Proposals:
Ad Hoc Committee Formed

At Monday’s faculty meeting,
the Executive Council's recommem
dations to the ad hoc committee
on the North Campus problem were
approved. According to laculty
members present one ieature oi
the proposals is to have students
on North Campus paid to enforce
rules,

These recommendations are not
final, however. They go to an ad
boo committee which will discuss
them and then make ﬁnal recom-
mendations to President Leggett.
Leggett said yesterday that he will
approve Steve Kent, Bob Foote,
Karen Lauterbach, Henry~York
Steiner (English), Luther Erickson
(chemistry) and R. Homer Norton
(history) as members of the com-
mittee. The committee will be
chaired by Richard Winters, asso-
clate dean of the College.

The Council's suggestions have
not been released formally to the
student body. The iaculty and ad-
ministration members involved are
willing to release the material but
the student members want to wait
until after spring vacation so that
they can go from hall to ball to
explain the faculty’s proposals.

”As a whole," said one faculty
member, “the proposals were not
radical." Another facility member
told the 5&3 that the recommenda-
tions are “relatively mild” but
that they “involve change and
when you're reactionary any
change looks radical.”

FORUM HOURS

Mrs, Jewel l-iawk, director of
the Forum, has announced that
the Forum will close tomorrow
at 3 pm for Spring vacation
The grill Closes tomorrow at 2
pm

The Forum will reopen Stin-
day, March 27 at 4 p.1n. The
grill will open that same day at

President Leggett said yesterday
that he was planning a convoca-
tion for sometime soon after spring
vacation, perhaps the ﬁrst week in
April. He Said that he and the new
student government officials would
take part in the convocation and
that the North Campus problem
would be one of the topics dis-
cussed.

The faculty announced yester-
day that they have elected Joseph
