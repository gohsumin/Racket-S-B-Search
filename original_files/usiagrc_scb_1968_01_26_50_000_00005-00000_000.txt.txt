Campus Recruitment Scanned

USMC WAITS FOR LEGGETT

President Glenn Leggett and College Director of Placement
Nicholas Ryan weren’t exactly gungrho when the Marine Corps
Officer Selection Team offered to visit Grillnell and recruit on
campus. The visit. scheduled for January 13, was cancelled.

[ii a letter to Capt. Bruce McKenna, a Marine Corps Selection
Ullicer, Leggett asked recruiters to "wait until our discussions are
rinished and our policy clearly articulated."

“As you are aware, a good deal oi attention has been focused
recently on the recruitment process on college campuses," Leg-
gett emphasized in the December 27 letter. “and we are now in
the midst ot such policy discussions at Grillnell."

“We expect to Complete the discussions shortly." he con-
cluded, “but would prefer to have them without the pressure of
an early deadline. Accordingly, we would rather that you did not
visit us on January 23. . .

“As soon as we have reached a Clearer understanding of our
responsibilities to our students in so lar as recruitment and place-
ment are concemed, we will be in touch with you."

To ieach that "clearer understanding,“ Leggett told the sub.
on ad hoc committee on recruitment and placement has been cre-
ated by the college udmhiistrutloii.

The ad hoc committee, which held its first meeting January
12, includes three members of the Executive Council (Prof. Alan
Jones, Prof. John Kleinschmidt, and Chairman of the Faculty
Joseph Wall); the Chairman of the Judicial Council (Prof. Arnold
Adelberg); the Chairman of the Student Alfairs Committee (Prof.
John Burma).

Committee members also include four students —— all from the
student government's executive cabinet: SGA President Ric Mac-
Dowell:CofHP Presidentrkonald Cogswell; AWS Board President
Leida Schoggen; Speaker of the Senate Phil Bertenuial.

Leggett said the decision to ban military recruiters temporar-
ily came “after noting trouble other colleges and universities have
had during and after such campus recruiters' visits."

“It is my nation," the president told the SEE, “that the timl
an discuss potential trouble is beiore it happens and not after.”

“We Weren't particularly expecting trouble," Leggett ex«
plained, “but other Campuses that didn’t expect trouble had 50ml
anyway."

The president cited recent demonstrations against the Dow
Chemical Company, notably at Harvard and the University at
Rochester, as examples of “troublesome” recruiting situations,

According to placement director Ryui, Dow has not visited
Grinnell during recent years and has not scheduled a recruitment
visit here this year.

Marine recruiters Came to Grinnell during the first week of
school last semester, Ryan said.

“There was absolutely no difficulty when they came in Sep-
tenlber," Ryan added. “People were just coming back to school
and weren't very concerned about the possibility oi protesting."

Teh ad hoc committee on recruiting has reached no conclu-
sions, Leggett said. He added that the Committee would like a
sample student opinion on campus recruiting as to whether agen-
cies and Corporations linked with the Vietnam war should be al-
lowed on campus.

“I have no reason to believe . . . Violence could be provoked
on the Grinnell campus," Leggett said in a mailbox letter to stu—
dents yesterday.

But, he added. “if the opportunity interests you, will you write
me within the next two weeks your own view of the positions an
institutional statement on recruiting and protesting ought to ake?"

Leggett emphasioed that such a sampling of opinion would not
{me the College into a policy oi “selective recruiting.

A questionnaire on recruiting appears on page five of this
Week's 5&3.

in the Spring of 1966, students at Grinnell College became
among the first to demonstrate against campus recruitment visits
of the Central intelligence Agency.

Six students engaged in non-violent protest of a CIA recruit-
ment visit. and no disciplinary action was taken by the adminis-
tration. The protest, however, received national publicity from
wire services.

“The gentleman from the CIA told me later," Ryan mused,
“that he didn't mind the protest here at all. In fact he said it pro-
duced a number of unsolicited inquiries into job opportunities with
the CIA.“

(AAC) last week that the Fed-

half of all funds for higher
education by 1975.

Piter. whose foundation is

growing movement toward fed-

reason why federal support

He went on to tell the edu-
cators that financing is not the
only major problem they face.
He called for better co—operd-

the Federal Government, add<
ing that “We can no longer an

BAN LIFTED

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (CPS)
—George Washington Universi—
ty has lifted its ban on military
recruiters.

The university, along with Am«
herst College and Columbia Uni-
versity, has banned recruiters
as a result of Selective Service
Director Lewis Hershey's letter
to local draft hoards recom-
mending the induction oi anti»
war demonstrators.

George Washington President
Lloyd H. Elliott said the ban
was lifted because of a recent
White House statement that
the draft Would not be used to
punish demonstrators and a
statement by the Justice Depart-
merit that prosecution of draft
violators would be lelt to the
Courts.

Hershey has refused to com-
ment on the White House state
merit and has openly disagreed
with the Justice Department
position, but Elliott said the two
statements "clearly indicate
that the courts will provide the
mean: of redress and protec-
tion.”

“These developments make it
possible, he said, for the Uni<
versity to return to its basic
policy of an open campus.‘ "

Neither Columbia l'ior Amherst
have announced any plane to
rescind their orders.

The women came from all

of them took only one action-
to “petiiion the Congress for
the redress of intolerable grie-
vances,“ not so much for the
good publicity that such moder-
ation guarantees. but because
they generally believed that
Congress would listen.

However, the blitzkrieg en-
forcemenf of an 1882 statute a
week earlier kept them from
getting even to the icebound
steps of the Capitol building
(although a small delegation
went inside), so the others had
