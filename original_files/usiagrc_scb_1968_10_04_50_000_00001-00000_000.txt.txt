— Ptero Editor's I-V
Trial a Test Case

A girl, not a student of Grinnell College, was
found in the room of Richard Schneirov by a mem-
ber of the cleaning staff of Loose Hall on Wednes—
day, September 25. Schneirov is the editor of the

pterodactyl, the “underground"
newspaper produced by Grin-
nell students.

Richard Schneirov was not in
his room at the time

The case will come to the new
gidicial court. This will be the
’rst time the issue of illegal
visitations has faced the court.
Schneirov will refuse to stand
trial unless the trial be open,
he indicated in an interview.
l-le does not think the trial will
begin until next week,

“I think l’ll get Conduct pro,"
laid Schneirov. But a verdict
of this sort Will be unacceptable
to him. “Anything less than
‘nbt guilty' will be unaccept.
Ible," he said.

Schneirov war warned on
Thursday, Septt 26, of what
might happen to him if the girl
did not stop living in his dormi-
tory room, Nevertheless, the
girl stayed, When asked why he

ad her stay when he knew it
might endanger him Schneirov
replied, “Because i wanted her
to stay, I like her and wanted
her to stay. I didn’t obey the
administration b e c a u s e it
doesn’t have the right to make
miles concerning the l-V situa-
tion in residence balls”

The case will be turned into
a test case, if Schneirov is suc-
oesstul,

Dean of Students Eugene
Thompson Said that a Situation
in which there is coeducational
use of dormitory rooms is
simply not tolerated in this
.World.

It the case does not go as
Schneirov hopes, he says there
may be mass sleep-ins, or some

Last Friday live 18-year aids
were arrested in Merrill Park
for illegal possession or beer.
Only three of the five were Grim
hell students; two were visitors
from out-of-town.

The five were taken to court
iiaturday and lined $100 each
plus court expenses, which
amounted to 54 in each case,

When Police Chief Bill Peter!
was asked about the recent
number of arrests tor the illegal
drinking by minors, the chief
replied, in effect, that it under
lge drinkers are caught they
will be arrested. The large
number at recent arrests, he
laid, does not represent it

SENATE PASSES RESOLUTION
FOR 24 HOUR OPEN LOUNGES

Faculty Accepts
Credit-Foil Grade
In Social Studies

The elimination of the tradi-
tional grading system in the
ﬁrst semester (1968) Social
Studies course, approved Mon-
day by the faculty, is meant to
stimulate students to think let
themselves rather than to raise
the pass-fail issue for all
courses, stated Gregory Gur<
on (History).

The decision is an exception
to the passiail option allowing
upperclassmen to elect one
course, outside of general and
major requirements, per semes-
tar as pass-tail. The interdis-
ciplinary Social Studies stall of
13 was unanimous in its pro-
posal to experiment with the
new course, which is “man-
dated to experiment," said Gun
on The Educational Policy
Committee in the Social Studies
division released the staff’s
proposal to the faculty in the
division about a week ago.
Monday, it was given to the
entire faculty for a final deci-
sion without a recommendation
from the Executive Council, ac-
cording to William Pollak (Eco-
nomics).

The one-semester innovation
will allow for the second se-
mester statt to proceed with
the course as they see fit, Some
or the laculty were hesitant to
approve the proposal because

EDITOR'S NOTE:

We are printing stories
about the procedures two
other schools in our conier—
ellce took to change the op-
en dorms rules on their cam»
poses, and what their new
dorms programs are.

Gi‘innell Students are not
the only ones dissatisfied
with present rules. it might
be helpful to the inevitable
debate on open dorms to
compare our present living
situation with those of oth-
er schoﬂls.

Then again, perhaps his
tory does not teach, and
perhaps (for which there is
a great amount of evidence)
men do not learn by the ex-
perience at others. it such be
the case, these stories may
be Considered curiosities.

Cornell Siuclenis
Vole Own Rules

During the week or Sept, 9,
the Student Council of Cornell
College, Mount Vernon, Iowa,
in a closed meeting passed a
resolution giving each dormi-
tory jurisdiction over its open
dorm hours

The plans were not submitted
to the Oliice of Student Affairs,
the branch of the administra-
tion which is concerned with
such issues as open dorms, but
the office was simply notified of
the decisions the student gov<
ernment had made

The boys' dormitories voted
to give themselves four nights of
open dorms. In general, the
hours voted upon were from

Open Dorm Issue

Money Delayed

The student Senate, October
2, passed a resolution advocat.
ing 24 hour coeducational use
of dormitory lounges, and ap-
proved a statement supporting
Richard Schneirov, who is short-
ly to go beinre the judicial
council for having had a girl
live with him in his dormitory
room for five days. The Senate
looks at the Schneirov case as
the result of an unacceptable
open dorms policy.

The Senate also considered A
request by the Ptemdactyl for
$300. This request was deferred
until a spokesman irom tho
Senate could consult with the
college’s lawyer. The spokes-
man for the Pterodactyl wished
to determine whether the paper
could remain independent 01

Longcm Changes
Open Dorm Rules

Katherine Karlson, ’69, presh
dent of Langarl Hall, has formu-
lated a policy ior her hall where
by there are no restrictions on
open dorms except “considen
ation at others,”

“We have open dorms that
are based on consideration oi
other people,” said Miss Karl-
son. She explained that she
did not want the decision of all
individual to disturb others in
the hall.

“1 want to getaway from the
secretiveness that has existed
in the dorms,” Miss Karlson
continued. When a boy is going
to enter a git-rs tloor, an ac‘
companying girl will be expected
to shout, “Man on the floor"
to inform others ol his presence.

There are discussions in the
dormitory every week. Miss
Karlson said that “in the dis-
cussion, people can learn to be
intentional and not to yield to
peer pressure,"

There are no restrictions at
all on hours for the dorms.
They could be 24 hours. It is not
necessary to ask permission
from the president {or any open
dorm, according to the new
policy. The only restriction is
that those involved not disturb
others.
