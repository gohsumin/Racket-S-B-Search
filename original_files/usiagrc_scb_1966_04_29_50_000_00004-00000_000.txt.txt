‘llncertainties’ in American Society
May Deter 05. Cultural leadership

By LINDA SECKELSON

Millard Sheets, noted painter
and educator on the West
Coast, lectured last Monday eve-
hing on “American Painting and
Culture in 1966." Sheets feels
that American art has evolved
into a new phase since 1925,
a phase of searching, charac«
terized by a liner sense of aes‘
thetic organization. He noted
that the arts today are at a
peak with regard to public re—
sponse, due to the continuously
evolving Search for new means
of expression.

Sheets’ primary concern was
with art in a social context:
the social "function” of art
and the role of American
culture in the world. He said
that arts supply the connective
tissue oi existence, and serve
to bridge the dlcllolumy be.
tween the realms of the human-
ities and the sClences by creat<
ilig new means iui communica-
lieu,

But despite the public suc-
cess of American an, Sheets
feels that the present cultural
situation is a precarious one.
Are we, in 1966, at the hegili<
mng or the end of a peak in
cultural excellence? The con-
flicting ditterences in values,
feelings, alld beliefs, the com-
plex of uncertainties which
characterize American society
are, Sheets teels, a potential de-
terrent to American cultural
leadership in the world.

"Our society is sick with on»
bearable pressure” . . . which
affects our cultural stature di-
rectly and indirectly through in
eitecc on the quality of politi-
cal leadership, education, and
the creative arts. Political
leadership today suffers from
lack of cultural understanding,
from mediocrity of mind and
ability. Education suffers in
that its objective seems to be
conformity. And formal educa-
tion in the creative arts lacks
enough emphasis on a complete
knowledge of form and stnlcture
in the legacy of Western and
noanestern art.

Sheets feels that the United
States' is or: “Cultural trlal"
with regard to the rest of the
world, that there must be a re-
vitalization of the democratic
system, and the establishment
of a deeper understanding of
ulhel’ peoples. But of priinaiy
importance is the necessity of
recapturing spiritual balance
in order for America to emerge
as a cultural leader.

Sheets made nu mention of
“American painting in 1956” as
he indicated he would in his
title. His concern about the
“sickness" or Amrican society
and its effect on culture was
sincere and valid. But his
cliche-ridden handling of the
role of the artist in relation to
all of the above points made
one think that he grabbed the
wrong speech belore jumping
on the plane in Grinnell.
