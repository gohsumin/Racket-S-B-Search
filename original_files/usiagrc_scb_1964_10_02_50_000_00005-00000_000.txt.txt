PPPE Announces
Book of the Month

The 480, a political novel
about the 1964 presidential cam-
paign. has been selected by the
Program in Practical Political
Education as the October-No»
vember Political Book-of-the-
Month.

The book's title refers to the
480 different classifications of
income, occupation, race, re-
ligion, class, etc,, into which
the American electorate has
been divided by a behavioral
science corporation, in order
that computers then can simu-
late and predict voter reaction
to any candidate or issue. The
novel tells how John Thatch,
a happily married, successful
engineer, is lifted from politi-
cal oblivion, packaged, pro»
cessed, and sold to the Repub-
lican National Convention as
the Party’s candidate against
President Johnson, by two he-
havorial scientists using the
new computerized politics.

Burdick, author of earlier
bestsellers The Ugly American
and Fail-Safe, sees these anony—
mous professionals — whom he
calls “the new underworld of
American politics”—as an oin-
inous threat to democracy in
the U 5., unless their actions
and activities are known and
understood by the public.
