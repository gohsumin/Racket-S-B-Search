last one in May, we have picked
up a frightful momentum.

in searching for ways to face
this world, and to deal construc-
tively with iLAa search that all
of us in this room, young and
old, are preoccupied with—i
came across two pieces of writ
ing that have some relevance.
The first is a shout poem quoted
by Secretary of Education, John
Gnrdner, in one of his books.
It goes like this:

To whnrn can l rpulr loday7

The poem was written by a
young unhappy Egyptian dul‘~
ing the time of the Middle
Kingdom about 4000 years ago.
The second piece of writing is
a‘ paragraph 1 wrote myself
some years ago. it goes as fol-
lows:

This was i sermon i delivered
some 25 years ago at a convocar
tion to a group of my college
classmales’ parents, including
my own. I found it in the dust
bin of my own history while
searching, as middleraged men
often do, for memories of my
own father and mother in their
own right and not merely as

What is important about the
two pieces is their reflection of
