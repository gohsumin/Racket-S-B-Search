ation” and, with Mishael Schul»
hof. senior, “Undergraduate

members are nearby, occasion-
al faculty lecturers for a three-
month quarter,- and occasional
consultative service or repre-
sentation in the United States.

Continued sending of Grin-
nell Travel»SerVice Scholars to
Ahmednagar each year and ex—
change of students for specified
periods of study are other fac-
ets of the program.

Use of qualified Ahmednagar
faCulty members as visiting
locturers at Grinnell would also
be involved. Grinnell has al-
ready had one Ahmednagar
representative—Thomas Barna-
bas, principal (president) of
the collegevas a visiting pro-
fessor of chemistry here, dur-
ing the first semester this
year.

Pointing out his conviction
that such an expanded pro-
gram would be very meaningful
to Grinnell students and facul-
ty members, Bowen said that
