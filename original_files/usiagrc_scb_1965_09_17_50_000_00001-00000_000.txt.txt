Students for Democratic Society
fie/ii Discussion for interested’

By MARY MALCOLM

“Does anyone have a car that
they would like to take to Ala»
hama tomorrow morning—there
might be a demonstration and ii
there isn’t, there are always all
kinds of things to do there,” said
Grinnell student Bill Barnes in all
seriousness at the Wednesday
night meeting in South Lounge of
students “interested in” the Stu-
dents ior a Democratic society.

Very little business penetrated
the anti-organizational mood or
the meeting. Questions as to the

aims or ms were dismissed by
veteran members.

“It’s almost easier to tell about
the aims oi the individual project
because SDS is kind or nebulous."
Jean Vandervoort, past vice pres-
ident of the Grinnell chapter said.

The closest anyone came to de-
fining the {unction oi the group
was Nancy McCannon, who said
that the structure included three
parts: the indigenous movement
which concerns itself with com-
munity organization or poor peo-
ple; the peace movement which
sponsored last spring's March on

Washington protesting the Viet
Nam situation; and the campus
movement which played a role in
the Free Speech Movement at
Berkely and protests college ada
ministrative “in loco parentis”
policies.

Aims of individual projects were
discussed by students who took
part in summer projects directly
or indirectly connected with SDS.

Summer project workers inclu-

Grinnell College C oe

A sociological survey was con-
ducted last spring of the sexual
attitudes and practices of Grinnell
women. The survey sampled 100
women lrom all classes in approX<
imately equal proportions

Some of the conclusion drawn
by the Kinsey-like survey were:

I. Ninety-eight per cent or the
sample had engaged in some
type of petting.

2. Twenty-three per cent had
experienced sexual intercourse.

3. A greater percentage oi in-
dividuals felt that intercourse
would be acceptable for them
than had experienced it.

4. The number who have pet-
ted and have had intercourse
increases with the year in school.

5. Sixty-one per cent of the inn

 

dividuals felt that their attitudes
toward sex have become more

liberal since entering college.

6. Individuals with no relig-
ious beiieis have a higher per-
centage of both petting and
intercourse than individuals with
Protestant beliefs and among
Protestants, the amount of sex-
ual activity increases with de-
creased participation in the
church. Samples from other re«
iigions were too small to draw
conclusions.

The survey used Kinsey's delin—
ition of petting. it was deﬁned as
“physical contacts which involve
a deliberate attempt to eiiect
erotic arousal."

The ninety-eight per cent of Grin-
nell women who had engaged in

 

some kind of petting compared
with ninetyone per cent at a simi-
lar age, education, and social
background in the Kinsey report
published 12 years ago.

Kinsey's definition included kiss-
ing. When the various categories
of kissing were removed irom what
might be considered petting, 77 per
mm oi the Grinnell women had
potted,

The percentage of Grinnell girls
who had engaged in sexual inter-
course was twenty-three per cent,
as compared to twenty per cent
tor a group of women at similar
age, education, and social back-
ground in the 1953 Kinsey report.

The report showed that {or all
areas of sexual activity a Grinnell
girl is more Inclined to participate

in that activity with someone the

survey called a “steady date."
This percentage was higher than
that with a "fiance,” notably be-
cause the report showed that a
low percentage of Grinnell wom-
en have ever had a fiance,

The report said that “the indi-
viduals whose attitudes were more
liberal than behavior Cited lack of
opportunity, tear of the activity or
its consequences, lack of an ap-
propriate setting, and uncertainty
about attitudes as the factors re-
sponsible [or the diiierence.”

The report went on to say “the
few individuals whose attitudes
were more conservative than be-
havior telt that temporary loss or
rationality due to alcohol or hi0-
