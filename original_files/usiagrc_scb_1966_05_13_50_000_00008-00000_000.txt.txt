SDX Dinner Addressed by Bill Vaughan;
Renaud. Turek, Wolf, Hodierne Honored

The Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi and Theta Sigma Phi. men's and
women’s journalism societies, met this
Monday evening tor a dinner and ad
dress by Bill Vaughan, syndicated col-
umnist and associate editor DI the Kan-
sas City Star.

Before Vaughan gave his speech, a-
wards were given to Bob Hodierne oi the
SBtB, John Wolf, Mrs, Jane W. Renaud
of the Public Relations Office, and
John Tiirek of the Newton Daily News.
the S&B’s printer. All of these awards
were given by the Grinnell iournalism
soueties for distinguished service to
journalism.

In a speech titled “The Better the
Newspaperman the Worse the Speech,"
Vaughan gave the audience an idea or
what the modern columnist has to strug-
gle with. Vaughan has two columns which
are syndicated in over 150 newspapers
around the world, has written two books.
Bird Thou Never Wert and Sorry i Stir-
red It, and witnessed the last official
hanging in the state or Missouri, an ac<
tivity which he touched on in his speech.

wrote a couple oi months ago that was
so good?"

He went on to say that he started in
journalism as a paragraph writer. an
art that was dying out like that or the
iceman or the blacksmith. “In that job,”
he said, “the only advantage was that
you didn’t live in the constant fear OI
promotion.”

Vaughan went on to make some ‘tan-
dom comments on newspapermen and
journalists.” He touched on the topic
of technical obsolesceitse, that is, the
computerized, ticker - tape newspaper
offices of today in contrast to the old
ways. He also talked about the need for
some manner or “compulsory journal-
ism” in schools. The reason for this was
What he Called the “inability of educated
people to read and to be able to “criti-
cize intelligently.”

Vaughan asked the audience the ques-
tion, “What sells newspapers anyway?"
He called it a building process in which
both the readers and the newspaper de-
veloped a mutual trust of each other on
the basis or integrity and quality. He
said that the newspaperman must work
on the assumption “that the reader is
not always right,"

At the end of his address, Vaughan
mentioned the challenges facing today's
journalists. "The biggest and most im-
portant one." he said, “is having the
ability to originate and transmit the
most exciting ideas to the public in an
age of computerized journalism."

After his speech, Vaughan was made
an honorary member of the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Beta Chi.
