Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale Give Views On Trial

(John Froines, a member
of the “Conspiracy 8" pres-
ently on trial in Chicago, will
be on the Grinnell campus
tomorrow. Earlier this week,
two other members of the
Conspiracy, Tom Hayden
and Bobby Seale, released
statements on the current
progress of the trial. Por-
tions of those statements are
printed below.)

Hayden: We came to Chi-
cago last year because we
were living under a system
that did not represent us, that
was culturally and politically
meaningless, and l think that
we have now been vindicated
as prophets.

The war in Vietnam still
goes on. President Nixon has
carried on the policies of
President Johnson. President
Nixon in fact has used John-
son’s very words in condemn-
ing and ignoring the anti-war
sentiment.

This is what we were pro-
testing last year when We said
that we have no role in this,
that this had no meaning to
us — there is no real choice
for the American people. And
when Hubert Humphrey at the
time of the Moratorium be—
came the man to endorse Rich»
ard Nixon’s policy, it all came
through in the clearest and
simplest way: for here were
the same men who we said
represented no choice last
year. now endorsing each
other and trying to carry on
policies of last year.

The people who came to the
streets of Chicago last year
were prophetic about which
way this country was going —
how long it was going to con-
tinue the war, how it was go
ing to treat black people, how
it was going to treat young
people — and now i think we
see the same process recur-
ring in the courtroom that oc-
curred last year around the
Convention.

The government attack on
Bobby Scale, on myself and
omer people in the courtroom
follows the same line that
their attack followed last year
around the Convention. There
was a vivid demonstration of
the way the government deals

with facts, deals with evi—
dence. yesterday when Mr.
Schultz summarized in his
own selective way what Bobby
Seale had said in the morning.
Bobby Seale came into the
courtroom, said that he was
standing on his constitutional
rights, said several times that
he wanted people in the audi-
ence to keep cool no matter
what happened, they said they
would, and then later, when
Bobby was thrown back in his
seat Schultz got up, told the
judge that Bobby Seale had
earlier told people in the audi-
ence to be ready to make an
“attack."

it was only after our in»
sistence — we almost had to
scream our insistence — that
that was not the case. that
Schultz, since he was before a
stenographer, had to back
down and acknowledge that
there was something else that
Bobby said.

Life Magazine was very pro»
phetic when it said that this
was not so much a trial as
an act of vengeance because
men go mad when they know
they have lost. and Judge
Hoffman knows that he has
lost. the social order that he
represents is finished. The so»
cial order that President Nix-
on and Vice President Agnew
represent is finished.

That's what is going on and
I think it's going to get worse.
i think now, the quieter we
are , . . the more that we are
respectiul. the more that we
simply sit there in the room,
the more outraged and frus-
trated and boiling they will
become. The process is now
simply underway. Whether we
scream or whether we are si-
lent, it will go from one step
to the next until the entire
trial disintegrates, This is a
prediction, it is not a threat.

Seale: Why am I handcuiled,
shackled to a chair, and
gagged in Judge Hoiiman’s
United States District of Illi-
ndis courtroom? i am sure
the masses of Americans, es-
pecially the Black People, are
intelligent enough to see the
injustice irom the very begin-
ning of this trial as a railroad-
ing operation of US. imperial-

ism abroad and domestic im»
perialism — fascism — here
at home. We should know that
racism plus capitalism breeds
fascism; but, we see how the
newspapers and especially the
TV and radio news media try
to say or imply that the rea
son I was shackled and gagged
was because ol what this pig
Judge calls outbursts or “in-
terrupting the court proceed-
ings.”

The masses oi working
people (the employed and un—
employed Black and poor op-
pressed people) can see fur
ther than that. And those who
cannot and/or those who are
coniused about it all can now
see the real reasons fascism
is showing its hand more open-
ly; because a man stands up
and speaks in behalf of his
constitutional rights to be rep-
resented by legal counsel of
his choosing and if not that,
then the constitutional right to
defend himself by being his
own lawyer until his ill law.
yer, who is most effective in
proving his innocence, can
come to defend him.

I have sat for hours and lis-
rened to testimony, most of
which is lies, directed against
the other seven defendants.
The only times We stood up
and demanded my right to le-
gal defense are when a wit»
ness says my name. Then I
stand up and say “I object on
the grounds that my lawyer.
Charles R. Garry, is not here,
I've been denied his services
and l have been denied the
right to defend myself, so I
object to this witness testify-
ing against me.”

Everyone knows this trial
should not be going on. Every-
one knows that constitutional
rights are being attacked by
this rotten power structure in
America.

The right to free speech and
freedom to assemble and
peacefully protest even in
court. This fascist court put
chains, handculis, and gags
on a person. What are they
really doing? WHY? what is
this?

Simple: the constitutional
laws are supposed to protect
me or any citizen in America,

Chicago—Eights Froines

Friday. November 7

To Speak Here Tomorrow

Despite the refusal of the
Program in Practical Political
Education (PPPE) to give 5100
for his appearance, John
Frames, one of Chicago’s
“Conspiracy 8,” will appear at
Grinnell tomorrow. Froines will
speak in Roberts Theatre from
3 p m. to 5 pm,

Froines is currently on trial
in Chicago with seven other
persons (or conspiracy charges
resulting from his participation
in the demonstrations at the
1968 Democratic National Cons
vention. He is a chemistry pro-
fessor at the Universrty oi
oregon, and has participated in
radical pclitical activities for
many years. During the trial,
he can only leave Chicago on
weekends. and he uses this time
to raise money lor the trial and
appeals, by speaking throughout
the country.

According to Jim Lew, SGA
president, PPPE earlier im-
pile-ﬂ it wculd help pay for
Froinc's appearance. However.
when instructor l-ienry Klein
(Art) proposed that PPPE pay
$100, the Suggestion was defeat-
cd by a 5-2 vote oi the PPPE
Advisory Committee. The Stu
dent senate had already agreed
to pay $150 to bring Froines
here, and the additional $100
will new have to be raised
through donations.

in a note to Assoc. Prof.

K i e i n, Edwin Gilmour,
(PDlitlcal Science) PPPE Dir-
ector, said, “The Committee
wanted you to know that this
action was not disapproval of
Froines’ appearance at Grin-
nell; rather, it was the judg-
ment of the Committee that this
action was not within the pro
gram jurisdiction of the PP
FE.” Klein said that he be-
lieved they thought the issues
involved were not of broad
enough importance to justiiy
the grant. Klein expressed
”amazement” at this cons
clusicn.

ln a separate action the
senate passed the following
resolution at its Tuesday meet-
ing: “Since the central question
involved in the trial of the
“Chicago 8 Conspirators” is the
use Cl the American judicial
process as a political weapon:
a question which involves us
all—and since John R. Froines,
a member of the “Chicago 8"
will be on campus Sat. Nov.
8. the senate urges the college
community to give generously
to the campus fund drive to
support the “Chicago 8.“

Tomorrow morning, Froines
will meet with chemistry
majors due to his professional
interest. Other scheduled ac-
tivities include a lunch with stu-
dents. as well as the afternoon
speech.

 

Bobby o.

Seale, national chairman of the Black Panther

Party, was held in contempt of court Wednesday and sen-
tenced to four years in jail by Judge Julius J. Hartman. Hoff-
man also declared a mistrial for Seale, separating him from
the other seven conspirators and setting a new trial for April
23. (Photo by David Goldstein/Dock of the Bay/LNS.)

but the administration, Nixon
et. al., and the courts do not
intend to enforce or recognize
the rights of the people, es-
pecially a Black man's.

We have to defend ourselves

.against the repression in
the courtrooms. Only we the
eople can, as a unified prole-
tariat. do this. if they attempt
to take the first amendment
away (rpm the American
people overtly, and that’s
what the Hugs are doing. then
we the masses of the people,
especially the Black, Brown,
and poor White people, we
must exercise the second

amendment and do what the
first two paragraphs of the
U.S. Declaration of Indepen—
dence say. What do they say?

“The right of the people
to keep and bear Arms shall
not be infringed."

“When a long train of
abuses and usurpations. pursu-
ing invariably the same ob-
ject evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute despot»
ism, it is their right, it is their
duty. to throw off such a gov-
ernment, and to provide new
guards for their future secur-
ity."

All Power To The People.
