itises may often be called the
‘battle or the slylos,” for unless
s college concentrates its plan:
ning and building in one rela-

tively short span of time or
willingly iiinits itself to one
cm of architecture regardless

of expense and future pl'acllbllr
ity, it will need to adapt its
.rchltecture to changing needs
nd contemporary tot-ms, Grill-
ell is no exception, ‘

At present the old and the
new are in sharp contrast as
one walks about the campus and
ompares Burling library, Nor»
i-is hall, Roberts theatre and the
tine arts building to the older
tyles of architecture, most com-
monly. called “l‘evivztlist” since
they are patterned on a classic
iorin of architecture,

Thesc revivalist styles include
he romanesque of Goodnow, the
ethic of Blair hall, now gone
from the Grinnell scene due to
physical deterioration, and the

Like all ionns of art there is
. iii-eat: deal of individual taste
.nd feeling in architecture, and
the fact that the newer buildings

.nd Merrill. architects of some
.istinction, is a primary factor.

The architectural influence
fou‘nd in, these buildings, as in
many oi the 5.0M. works, is
that of the Bauhaus or interna—
ional style. It was developed in
he post—World War 1 period
in Germany at Bauhaus and car.
ried during World War II to
ainoridgc by Walter cropius,

The primary interest 'at Bau-
iaus was to torce -the architect
o work with both artists and
ndusti-ial designers. This results
d;in a more frank use of mar
terials in the most functional
vay possible.

‘ln these new buildings one
will notice the absence ot any
ttcmpt to hide the materials.
id in fact they have been used

the architecture in such a
vay as to become an integral
art of the bu'ilding’s beauty.

‘ The long concrete beams of
Roberts theatre might be said
to be analagous to the frills
and intricate carving of gates

color of the brick was to give
the work a sense oi lightness;
the exception to this is Nor—

significance, is the fact that
there is considerably less cost in
these new buildings than there
would be in continuing an old
pattern. The intricacy of the
Gates tower was very expensive
forty years ago when these
buildings were built; today it is
three to six times more expen»
siye.

By not forcing the architect‘

to conform to a pattern oi
architecture sci, by previous
generations, the college pl‘ovldr
cd for buildings growing from
the spirit of the age and dis-
tinctive in their beauty and
original design. This also per.
mitted greatest functional use of
college funds and ‘space.

These new buildings have
been constructed in vieiv oi
the total deyelopment or the
Grinnell physical plant as ea-
visioned by the administra-
tion, it is their desire to make
the atmosphere as pleasant as
possible using all . available
space in the most tunctional

tant characteristic oi the in
ternational styles. '

 

 

More areas of the campus are

According to Mr, A'lden, Bur-B

as follow in June of 1960, the
ilibi'ai‘y contained 137.000 vols
iumes. He cstimatcs'that when
the count is completed this
June. 6490 new books will have
been added.

  

Attendance is on the rise im-
;the second year in a row, When
'the library opened in 1959, a
440% increase was recorded
‘ovei‘ the old library'sthe previous
year. This year, attendance has
iincreased still another. 20%.
iThls increase, Mr, Alden says,
gis more than the increase in
student body. '7

Burling has also addgdvﬁﬁ
new titles on the periodical list.
‘And in the last two years. 132

There have also been slight
structural changes recently iii

crease ovcr the current year.

The class distribution ,breaks’
down to 415 freshmen, 299 sopho-
mores, 211 juniors Vand 202 sen-
iors, The expected freshman en-
rollemcnt for the academic year
1961432 is 355.

One of the most marked sta-
tistieal shifts is found in the
college attrition rate. The cur-
rent year saw only an eight
per cent attrition compared to
14 per cent last year and 20-25
per cent in previous years.

The most popular department
for this year’s graduating class
is sociology, which has the most
senior majors. History, biology,
Englis, political science and
psychology are'the other top
departments on the basis of sen-
ior- enrollment.
