SCARLET AND BLACK

King of the Rocket Men Becomes Fetish of Youth

By ANNE FARRER

Using the term loosely, Grinr
nell's fall social season has gotten
underway and has, or hopes to,
bring an array or diverse events
to supplement the ordinary stimu-
Iating atmosphere or the Grinnell
campus.

La Dulce Vita and Cannonball
Adderly have come and gone with
Homecoming and Dance IM's soon
to make their annual appearance.

However, the highlight to date has
been that classic oi the silver
Screen, King of the Rocket Men.
But Jetf King has a certain
ooompli that Cannonball seemed to
lack#a snappy dresser, battler of
evil (lacilitated by the tact that
his oppressors sport black suits in-

stead of conduct pro slips), utiliz-
ing the latest technical advances,
he is an exemplary hero tor to
days lost youth. Whether they em-

nlale or sublimate through Jeff
King, it seems evident that as an
idol he should be ranked with
such greats as Captain Midnight,
Superman, and Captain Video, or
if not heights as dizzying as this,

at least the Popeye and Spin and
Marty level. A prototype of the
clean living, clean loving Ameri—
can, Jeff King may well go down
in folk history as the male Shlr~
ley Temple.

Eastman Directs Teacher Education;
Says Schooling Must Be Modernized

Directing teacher education at
Grinnell, as Well as offering two
courses in education and plillosor
phy, is now the duty at George
Eastman.

Eastman comes to Grinnell from
the University of Toledo, Ohio,
where he taught in the philosophi-
cal loundstions department or the
College of Education.

Atter receiving a B.A. in Eng-
lish from the University of R0-
Chester, Eastman explored various
fields at post-graduate study, in
cluding doctorate work in English
at Princemn, study at Yale Dlvln-
ity School, the completion or an
MA. in secondary education at
the University of Rochester and of
an Ed.D. at Harvard University.

Eastman has taught English and
speech, on both junior and seninr
levels. In Rochester, N.Y., as well
as general psychology and philoso-
phy at Brockport State Teachers'
College.

Eastman‘s two main interests
are language analysis in its appli-
cations to education, and the “de-
veloping of models and schemas
lor the analysis oi broad human
problems.”

Eastman observed that his po-
sition at Grinnell gives him a schee
dule which will permit involvox
ment in research. He ﬁnds Gl‘ll’h
nell “more exciting and intellect-
ually stimulating” than other
schools where he has taught.

Eastman’s interests have led
him to formulate Certain education-
at ideals. “It is my opinion,” he
says, “that almost all of the high-
er education in the United States
needs to be drastically over-
hauled or revised. It is in almost
all of its Essentials anarchrunislic.
it is an education based upon it
medieval world View with its roots
in Judeo-Christian Culture, What is
needed, I believe, is a system OI
higher education and, by exten-
sion, a system oi public and pi-i.
Vale schuollng, which will be gen-
nninely in phase with the altered
world view of an advanced tech-
nological nationl"

Education today, Eastman goes
on to say, produces ”many people
who are schooled, but only a hand-
ful who are educated” He defines
an educated person as one who
“has so integrated learning that
there is no line of demarcation
between living his lite and learn.
ing about it,"
