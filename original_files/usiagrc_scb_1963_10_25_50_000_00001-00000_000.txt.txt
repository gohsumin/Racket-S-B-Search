Truman Calls Story
in Regisfer 'Hoaey'

Former President Harry s
Truman yesterday called a
story in. the Des Moines Reg-
ister “a lot a! honey." The
story said that he called stun
Idents' questions “disrespect~
iul.”

A bylined story written by
George Mills said, “Mr. Tru-
man said aiterward (alter the
press conference) he though
some of the questions were
(1' respectful to a iormer
President or the United
States."

Truman discounted the any
tire story, saying it wits un-
true, that he had never said
any such thing.
