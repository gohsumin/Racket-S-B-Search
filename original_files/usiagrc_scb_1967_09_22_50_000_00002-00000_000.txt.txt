TOWNIES ON CAMPUS

The rock and roll dance Saturday night in the North Lounge
was attended by college and high school students, and the com-
bination didn't seem to work. The blame did not lie with the
townics.

The high school students, attracted by the Pete Klint Quintet
(which was popular on the Iowa band circuit this summer), and

with nothing else to do that evening, arrived at the Forum
promptly at 9:30 pm. Most oi the college stttdents who were
going to the dance were still watching the hRH movie.

Even before the dance floor became crowded, high school stu~
dents were being told to leave, and those outside were told not to
come in. Forum guards patrolled entrances to the North Lounge.

The townies that remained inside were subjected to rudeness
and physical abuse at the hands of some ol the less liberal arid/0r
sober college students. Most, however, retired to the terrace out-
side the North Lounge. Here was witnessed Line of the more in-
credible sights oi the evening, as a prominent administration
ilgure announced to the townies (who were sitting harmlessly
and listening to the band) that: “all high school students must go
home." Most ot them were gone by ll pm.

Let those people who say that the high school students pay no
activity tees and theretore should not be admitted he reminded
that our omnipresent triends irom William Penn pay no more.

Let us also remember that college Students didn't start to
crowd the dance floor until alter IO p.m., and that the high school
students could have been allowed in until then and then told p0-
litely to leave.

Poor relations between the town and the college are perpetue
ated by such actions as transpired Saturday night. It is uniortunato
that the first action in 8 long time that finds students and admin-
lstration on the same side finds them both in the wrong.

REALITY iS BAD I‘OR P.R.

“The October Convocation is a iundraising vehicle tor the
college, and other benetits train it are secondary." This was told
to the sol; by James Avisorl, Director or Development

We see nothing wrong with raising money tor the college. We
see nothing wrong with doing it on campus, during the school
year. We see nothing wrong with inconveniencing the students a
little.

What is objectionable is turning Homecoming and Parents‘
Weekend into a three ring circus, and inrcing plans on the college
community, students and iaculty alike.

. . . According to the latest inlormation, Martin Luther King.
who is receiving star billing on lhe weekend, will arrive at mid-
night Saturday, preach the Sunday sermon, and leave immediately
afterward.

. . . Homecoming iloot building was eliminated this year be-
cause the noise would disturh all oi the participants, who were to
live on campus. Three at them are staying on campus.

. According to the weekend schedule, separate dining for
men and women students (men and their guests at Cowles, and
women and their guests and alumni at Quad) is the order of the
day.

Is this an attempt to balance dining iacility use (which usually
balances anyway) or is it also an attempt to retain. it just for
the weekend, the “old way or life” at Grinnell, so people can re-
member it “as it Was” rather than how it is?

There are other examples, and other problems with Convoca-
tion weekend that should be worked out. Reality may be bad ior
public relations, but it is wlizlt the students must live with the
rest of the year.

tor of promotion is Richard
Chapman, Grinnell class of ’21.
Grinnell College —- 1966 is now
scheduled to be ready ior dis—
tribution in December.

Price of the book has been
raised to $10 to cover a more
costly photo printing process
and other expenses,

everything you say; you’re just
politically naive.”

"I make a career out of be-
ing naive and writing ﬂqul it,"
McCurmally mused.

“I take up a lot of lost causes
myself, you know,” Gilmour
concluded.

“But," he added, "after in-
vesting thousands of American
lives and millions of dollars,
you tell me we’re just going to
get out?” the political scientist
asked.

“It is my personal opinion,"
McCormally answered, “that
as one Iowa newspaper editor
who has read everything he
could get his hands on . . . and
talked to everyone he could get
hold of I think we ought to get
the hell out and 12! Ho (Chi
Mihn) have it."

Turning finally to the Repub»
lican candidacy, McCormally
was asked by Gilmour who he
thought would be the Republi-
can answer to Johnson.

“Ronald Reagan,” McCor-
mally answered resolutely,
“And it scares me to death."

“When you run out or alter—
natives and answers,” the Iowa
editor added, “Reagan is the
altemative — the fictitious an-
swer, a guy who gives the im-
pression, who . . . looks good
and sounds good."

“I think people would be
much more willing to pay $100
to hear him (Reagan) speak
than Nixon," agreed Ptoiessor
William Vanderpool (speech),
county Republican chailltlan.

“I think Reagan can’t win
against Johnson,” McCormally
added, “But I think a Rocketel-
ler might be able to ur a Per.
cy -— or a RockelellereReagan
ticket."

“You all got sold down the
river tor Goldwater; we got
sold out by Johnson," he said.

“I voted for the man because
he said that Goldwater would
give us war in Vietnam,” he
explained. “and now I . ."

“Lyndon is week by week,
month by month, losing all of
his best people."

The verbal joust was “all in
the spirit oi knowledge and dis-
cussion,” PDG head otlmour
said at the outset of the meet-
ing.

“it those two guys (McCor-
mally and Gilmollr) didn’t love
each other enough to get more
rietl,” observed McCormalIy's
son, Sean (Gates sophomore),
“it could be really bitter.”

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Neil Fischer

There is nothing more distasteful to me than u lot of talk
and no action - especially when all the talk is about not having
enough action.

And after a couple weeks reading columns on the “loneliness
of long distant” students, reading letters concerning loneliness
on campus, and listening to chatter — and chattering a little my-
self —— about “not enough to do at Grinnell,” I have come to a
conclusion a bit out of character {or this column.

Namely, that our college has become a place characterized
by myriad verbal "tordo’s" about everything bttt also by people
who don’t want to do anything, and that it’s not the administra-
tion‘s fault,

Or to he more tacky — Grinnell students are ingenuuus, but
have no ingenuity.

They are staunch supporters of the freedom to have an active
social liie, but they seldom 7 it ever — come up with anything
interesting or unusual to do on campus.

Take “no hours for women students.” Since my last Epistle
on the subject, individuals have come up to me ﬁrmly stating
that the only reason the “no hours” system was advocated last
year was “the principle or the thing.“

I disagree, or course, but it “the principle of the thing” was
the only reason, what the situation boils down to is this: “We
weren't interested in doing anything with the time; we were only
interested in the freedom to do nothing.”

This, while noble, seems a waste of time 101‘ everybody -t
students, administrators, SGA members, and columnists alike.

Or take the monthly social calendars distributed in the mail-
boxes.

Most students take them anyway and on Friday and Saturday
nights — and every other night ior that matter — ioilow them
like they were Army strategy maps,

A inend of mine pointed out a notable phenomenon to me the
other night — a student reading his calendar and jotting down on a
pad: “8 RM. — GO TO STUART DEMPSTER CONCERT IN
ROBERTS . r I 10:15 RM. COFFEEHUUSE FLAMENCO GUITAR
IN COFFEEHOUSE . . . 10:45 RM. ~ GO TO JAM SESSION,
NORTH LOUNGE, FORUM . I ,” etc.

But when nothing is marked on the Almighty Calendar, nobody
is in the coffeehouse or Roberts or anywhere else.

Can’t you people just go tor a cup of espresso or tell im-
promptu jokes on the Roberts stage or have a midnight picnic
in the local cemetery?

Do you always have to go to the scheduled movie?

Someone with just a modicum or ingenuity organized a Satuh
day night “Camp Out.” Good Stuiil More of that.

God damn it, can’t you do something? Anything? Try running
down the Herrick Chapel aisles during the Sunday service scream-
ing, “1 am saved! i am saved!”

or course, there ls always danger involved in advocating
new, wheel, and therefore lnteresting activities. Last year Protes-
sDr George Young (Russian) elucidated the need [or “more crazy
people" at Grinnell. Among other things, he suggested “bull-
hghts on the central quad.“

Little did the good proiessor know that, tor the above comment,
he can be indicted under Section 726.7 of the criminal statutes of
the Code of Iowa:

“it any person keep or use, or in any way be connected
with, or be interested in the management of or receive money
lor the admission at any person to, any place kept or used for
the purpose or lighting or baiting any bull, bear, cock, dog, or
other creature, or engage in, aid, abet, encourage, or assist
in any btdl, bear, cock, or dog tight, or a tight between any
other creatures, he shall he gudty of a misdemeanor."

A misdemeanor in Iowa is punishable by as much as a year in
jail, a $500 line, or both.

The risk, i think, Is worth it. But students, I guess. have lost
the knack to tell each other where to go,

I note the loss with extreme grief.

Good griei, though, maybe this week you all will do some«
thing about something. And, anyway, you can’t say it’s the ad-
ministration’s fault when you won’t.

The classes are great here, the teachers are line;
It’s the mealtimes at Saga that can blow out one’s mind.

The Iood‘s bad enough here, the sit~downs are murder,
Perchance I’d do better to pick rail-side vol-duke.

In classes. my stomach seems to talk more than I.
That load is not ottered I don‘t mean to imply:

Our kilchens, lhe Forum, and rest’ranis are great,
But with equally thin budget, my appetite shall not sate.

Why not, instead or the room and board ice,
Be given a chargeaccount about this city?

The SAGA snack bar Shall remain for most meals:
More proiit, less waste; choice shows how one feels.

Excuse my poor poem —it’s difficult to Ihink ‘
When one‘s starving ll‘osh slulnach has gone on (he lilink.
