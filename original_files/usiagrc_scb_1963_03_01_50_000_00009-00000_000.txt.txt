to Alan Simpson, dean of the
college at the U. of Chicago.

American Conterencc of Acae
dcmic Deans

Liberal education, said Simp~
son, is a matter of intellectual
tools. literary skills, some
brcadth oi knowledge, some
grasp ol standards, and some
sensc or style. “it is the ex-
perience which equips a learn-
cr to road, write, think, count,
judgc, and act _ and tn do
so in the light ot a good gen—
eral culture It's an education
in discrimi ion, in creative
imagination, in logical thought,
and in practical wisdom.”
Bemuan'ing the “erosion oi the
old standards," Simpson said he
“would cheer-hilly sacriﬁce any
n um b e r or interdisciplinary
courses in the senior year ior
one successlul course—or expert
encciin English composition."

llc noted the need ior clear
expression in “the mush of

ful thud of bureaucratic jar-

gon, the melancholy masochism ‘

at Madison Avenue, and the
smog which descends on or-
gans like the New York Times
Book Review."

Stressing thc need for “a 1d
cral education at the college le
el," Simpson warned of the
“squeeze produced by the col-
lcgeslevel courses in high schools
and the pleagl‘aduate courses in
college.

“Let, them (the colleges) by
all means build on better stan-
dards from below; but let them
also deiend their duty to civile

both the precocious special-
ist and the luturc citizen. And
let them insist that, in the fur
turc as in the past, it will
normally take them ioui- years
to discharge this duty."

On the role or change in edu»
cation, Simpson commented: “in—
struction is one domain in which
Jen'crsonls doctrine that no So—

in the sober light,

iour'
tasks lor “the programs we of-,

ladvalices, said Simpson. How—1
ever he noted that the Collegc
at UC has so far been adectcd
“very little" by the “pl'ollferaa‘
thn of tubes and tapes and,
teaching machines," 1

Education must also be cons ,
corner] with and aware of the
larger, more general problems i
of a changing world, said ‘
t Simpson. ,

One at thesc problems is "the
domestication Of science within‘
jthc general culture," Simpson
,urgcd that an under-standing Of
tseielice as inquiry and of the
,directions and social
,tions of modern science be part
0L the “equipment of an edu—.
cated man."

“The social implications pic. i

sent no special problem," he trier-shaded “not only to store up on objective tests 7 those ignor—
lions Hmowledge but to stem the tides able

Said; “but 'to give the
science major somc ieeling bee
yourl awe or frustrated bewil—
derment lor the most distinv

, tivc intellectual achievement or
modern man is an altogether-
hardcr task."

Anothey major issue is ”edu- lain death at public 517’ it. —— a‘motc the

gested that ‘the systematic study
or some culture other than our

educational gibberish. the mire ,

Cation."

Beyond “exposure to the cul- l
tures of the non-Western mem- 1
hers or thc human family," i
l Simpson looked tor-ward to the

development of “a year—long .

course in world history which .

will occupy the same irnpor- .

tant place in our programs as

the Western civilization course." i

The creation at such a course
is contingent upon “the eliorts olt
scholars to produce a better in»,
tegrated conception of world hiSr
tory than any new extant," he‘
said, for many members of the
historical profession have been
lcontent to supervise dissertations
on the herring industry or Ont

the Parliament of 1688 rather,
than attempt “to embrace the
lexperience oi the whole hulnzln‘
llamily,“ .

“World history has been lett to

Another large issue involves‘
the problem at getting the hu-
manities and the social scicnccs‘
“into a more eiieetivc relation-‘
ship with the hie around us, left

as specialists,” said Simpson. ,

“Concentrations i n v o l v ing

cultivation of a sense oi social ‘
