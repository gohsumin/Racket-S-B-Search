Soot Split Follows
Knox 14-0 Shuioui

By Jack Hartod

Coach John Pfitsch’s dia-
mondmen take a break this
weekend as regular Midwest
Conference action makes way
for the 1964 league playoffs to
be held Friday and Saturday at
Carleton, The Carls, the only
unbeaten squad in the MCAC,
will play host to Knox, the
,Southern Division representa-
tive, in the best—of—three se-
ries

Knox captured the divisional
pennant last Friday as the Si-
wash rolled to a 14-0 decision
over Grinnell. Steve Tilly, who
took the loss, was retired in
the sixth after being touched
for nine runs in the two pre
ous frames and Cal Collier fin-
ished up for Grinnell.

On Saturday, the Pioneers
salvaged a split in a twinbill at
Monmouth thanks to the fine
pitching of Barry Anderson.

The Scots won the opener,
but in the nightcap the Pfitsch-
men turned in one of their best
performances of the year to
shut out the Scots and take a
44] decision. Anderson held
Monmouth to three hits in go-
ing the route and striking out
ten.

The latest MCAC standings
show Grinnell dropped to fourth
and holding a half-game lead
over Monmouth. The Pioneers
are 451. Cornell, which Won two
last weekend, moved into third
with a 475 record. The Rams
have a doubleheader With.Coe
to go and also a single game
against Grinnell that was
rained out and has yet to be re
scheduled. Conceivably, Grin-
nell can close the year in third
place by downing the Rams in
the makeup contest. A loss
would relegate the Scarlet to a
cellar tie with Monmouth.

Golfers Aim for Top;
1963 Ghampinns Knox

“Let's finish first for a
change,” is the chant of the
Grinnell College golf team this
week as it prepares for Friday
and Saturday‘s Midwest Con-
ference Meet in Cedar Rapids.

Early in the season, Grinnell
tipped the Siwash, to halfway
avenge its second place stand-
ing last year, but it was a close
meet all the way. Last year,
Knox was three strokes better
than the Pioneers,

Leading Coach Larry Craw-
ford’s entries will be Dave Sel-
lergren, the medalist last year,
who has apparently found his
game again after a mid-season
‘slump.

His main challenger for the
individual honor could be team-
mate Ted Risser, a hard-hitting
sophomore, who wrestled the
No, 1 spot away from Seller-
gren and has been reluctant to
give it back. .

Also returning 'i'rom last
year’s team are Eric Miller.
Who was fourth in the individ-
ual standings, and Russ Har<
den, who copped sixth last year.

Out of his first league meet
is Mike Miller who has been
coming on strong of late and
could push the four above him
to better rounds.

 

Racqueleers Win 3;
MCAC Meet Next

With three straight dual wins
to close the regular season,
Grinnell College’s tennis team
Will be making I} bid this week-
end oo hang onto a first division
spot at the Midwest Confer-
enca Meet in Cedar Rapids,

Shannon, who was unde~
heated in dual meets last year
at No. 3, had troubles getting
Started this season when he
moved up two notches. How-
ever, he has won his last four
matches, coming from behind
in two of them

Also coming back strong has
been Mike Greenfield, Bowers'
No. 3 man Greenfield. just a
sophomore, has won his last
five tries, in addition to team-
ing with Ken Clymer to win
three doubles matches in a row.

Clymer, the No. 2 man, has
also been making a comeback
and could surprise a few again
this year. Last year, unnoticed
before the conference meet, he
fought his way to the semi-fi-
nals before falling to the even-
tual No. 4 champion.

Playing in the No, 4 spot this
year, and teaming with Shan-
non to form the top doubles
outfit, is Bob Koxnfeld (Chica-
go, Ill.). He has won two of his
last three matches.
