A fonner soldier who had served in
Vietnam commented, "We've got to win
little by little. That's what the
Viet Cong do. They hit a little here,
a little there, and that's how they
Win."

Many of the demonstrators expected
that several of the group would be‘
killed in the next day's action.

One youth from Baltimore said "pro—
bably a lot of us will get shot. But
for every one of us that goes down,
there'll be five to take his place."

Another radical commented that “if
you back to your home, and you've had
your arm shot off, or you're best
friend has been killed — let's consider
the possibilities — but if this happens
and you still want to fight, that's
going to impress the hell out of them."

Other Weathermen felt that it was
unlikely that many people would be
seriously hurt. People referred to
the concept of "white skin privilege,"
under which many vhite people hide to
avoid true commitment to the revolu—
tionary struggle. "In a strange sort of
way," it was explained, "we can exploit
that white skin privilege."

"If a bunch of black brothers marched
down the street and got shot, it wouldn't
make much difference to people in this
country. But if they shot a bunch of
us, even if the people hated us, they
wouldn't stand for it because we're
white."

About half way through the meeting,
one of the students who had been shot
in the Wednesday night fight entered
the room, still wearing Cook County
Hospital pajamas. He told the group,
"The next time I come to Chicago, I'm
going to take a couple of pigs with me."

Several youths immediately respond—

ed that such a position was "not correctﬂ

"That's an individualistic, terroristic
thing. We must think in terms of the
group, in terms of furthering the revol—
ution."

Leaders explained that individual
terrorism or action by small groups
was not the proper strategy for Sat—
urday. "We must remember that the pur—
pose of this action is to build a red
army. There is not much difference
between black terrorism and brown
terrorism and white terrorism. Blow—
ing up a few things or shooting a few
pigs from rooftops may do more damage,
and we may get into that later, but
not at this time."

"The action tomorrow has to demon—
strate that white people are willing
to join the sturggle, willing to fight.
To do that, we have to be on the streets,
in the Loop."

The direction of debate changed
when a girl from Iowa told the group
that although she could accept the
Weatherman philosophy in principle,
she could not get over the emotional
hurdle of going into the street with
the intention of killing a policeman.
"Although I know he's a pig and I should
hate him for it, I can‘t help but think
of him as a person."

The group agreed that this was a
problem that many seemed to have. A
girl from Michigan said, "We don't
like to hit people, to hurt people.

We don‘t like to get hurt either. But
the pig, whether he's a person or not,
is the only think that is holding the

man up, and the pig must be smashed.

The way to tear down the man is to off
the pig."

Another student added, "We must
fight because it is correct. You
hate the pigs so much you want to kill
them. We may lose militarily, but
by smashing pigs, we will win in the
.eyes of the people of the world. We
will win in the worldwide revolution—
ary struggle."

The girl from Michigan added,
"offing a pig is more than just hate,
it's love. Love for the revolution,
love for the oppressed people."

When asked if she thought the Viet
Cong should fight, the girl from Iowa
replied that she did. She added,
however, that she believed that there
"could be an alternative for people
living in America in l969."

A Vietnamese in the crowd rose and
delivered a bitter attack. "That is
exactly the hiding behind the white
skin privilege that we have been talk—
ing about," he said. "She can just
sit there and say the Vietnamese shoul-
fight but she doesn't have to. She
is a nationalist chauvanist racist.
The Viet Cong would kill her. She
shouldn't even be here. We should
kick her out."

The girl was allowed to remain but
it was decided that the group was
wasting its time talking with a pacifi-
and should return to the problems it
would fact the next day, as the bulk
of the group intended to fight.

Several leaders said that they

felt that there was a defeatist attitu-
in the group. "You can't go into the
streets tomorrow thinking that," said
a New York leader. "You've got to go
out there knowing you're going to win,
knowing you're going to win even if yo
die."
