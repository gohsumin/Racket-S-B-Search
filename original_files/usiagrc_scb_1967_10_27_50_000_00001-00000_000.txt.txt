SWEEZY
0N REVOLTS

“Communist revolts are now
caused by underdeveloped coun-
tries breaking out of the cap-
italists‘ system of international
aconomics and developing out-
‘ide of it. The real question is
whether the capitalist metropo-
lis will win in the long run and
retain control of the under-
developed nations"

So concluded Marxian econos
lnlst Paul Sweezy in his lecture,
Jon“! Future of Capitalism", in
the South Lounge Monday after-
noon. His credentials for pre-
‘henting the critique were many
and varied. He is a graduate
“(both BA, and Phd.) of Hal'-
yard in economics and a former
member of their faculty, and is
the founder of the “Monthly
Review" a socialist publication.
He is also author of several
books offering Marxian inter.

rotations of contemporary cap-
- lism.

In reaching his conclusions on
the inevitability of revolts by
thud-world nations, Sweezy dis<
Bounced the two prevailing
Mews of the world situation
ﬁnd its economic development.
.11. capitalism as a western
phenomenon. 2. Two types 0!
mmpetlng systems, i.e. capital—

of the third World), and ad-
vanced his own theory of west-
om economic development,

This premised that Western
nations only reached “take-off"
after they had “suckecHn” the

in the Saturday Mime Troupe
show, the answer is printed
here. It Is apparent to the 5&3
that a communicatiom break-

that no one person should be

needed capital from the "ex-
ploited underdeveloped nations.”
The underdeveloped or periph-
eral nations thus provided the
needed raw materials and mor-
ket-place for finished goods to
support the “capitalist metrops
olis."

For an underdeveloped na~
tlon then to reach “takeoff"
it has to break out of the
"straight jacket" of capitalist
control. This can only be done
by revolutions against, “unpop<
ular governments retained in
power by foreign aid from cap-
italist nations"

"I ought to punch you in the

mediately told Giddins.

"i ought to punch you in the
mouth." Giddins answered.

Professor Denis DeCoteau (mu-
sic) stopped the argument from
escalating into violence.

Davis told the Ski that his
troupe had agreed to do a short
show at 10 pm. Saturday fol-
lowing : Lenox Quartet concert
for $150 plus donations from the
audience.

He said that when he finally
was able to reach Giddins late
Saturday afternoon, he found the
troupe was actually doing a
“major event at a college that
could afford it.”

He said that Social Coordin-
ating Committee members didn’t
tell him that the show had been
rescheduled for 8 pm. Satur-
day until he called Giddins from
iowa City at 4 pm. the same
day.

“We found out that we had a
major Sl'mW scheduled in less
than four_ hours.” Davis ex-
plained. “it takes nearly an
hour to drive from lowa City
to Grinneil, and we were tired,
and we had to eat, and our
stuff was still set up at the
Universtity [of Iowa] and we
had to take it down and pack it
and come to Grinnell and un-
pack it and set it up again."

“We really couldn't be ex~
pected to come on stage fresh-
as-a-daisy." Cohan added.

“We were angry," Davis said,
"and we asked for more money,’

Giddins told the 58:]! he thought
the time settled on was definite-
ly 8 pm. He said that Miss
Georgia Dentel, Activities Coun-
selor and Program Director of
the College Forum, said she
called the Mime Troupe’s San
Francisco office on October 16
to check the time of the con-
cert.

Giddins said he was told that
the troupe’s secretary read the
time Of the concert to Miss
Dentel off of a printed itinerary
as 8 pm.

Miss Dentel later told the
5&3 that she asked the secre-
tary tn tell the troupe that
"the Lenox had been moved
to another night and that the
Show was scheduled for 8 pm.
as no definite time had been
originally set for the troupe to
perinrm."

THE GREAT JEWEL HEIST

PRESIDENT'S PENDANT
PURLOINED

The President's Medallion was
stolen from its case in Hurling
Library early Monday morning.

The thieves, at least one man
and one woman, apparently re-
mained in the library after
closing, and left ' through the
front doors after taking the
Medallion. The night watchman
went through the library a few
minutes after midnight - the
case 'was_still' intact.

At 2:30 amt, the college
switchboard operator received a
call from inside the college, and
a girl requesteld the telephone
extension for the sen' editor. A
few minutes later the 5&3
phone rang, and the editor was
told by a man Lhat "we havt
just taken the President’s Mo<
dallloll." ,

Ten minutes later, the editor
was looking through the locked
doors of the library. The glass
of the side panel, of the viewing
case, which had been smashed
(after an attempt to use a glass
cutter) by the thieves to remove
the Medallion, was clearly vis-
lble.

EXPLAINS
REPORT

(Editor's Note: The following
excerpts are taken from a pre-
sentatiou by Dr. Robert Have.
man of the report on his Spe-
cial Faculty Commlttee on Edu-
cational Policy and Curriculum
made to members ‘of the faculty
on October 23.)

I would like to make a few
comments about the contents of
the Report and the style oi edus
cation which its recommenda<
tions imply.

Following a rather prolonged
period oi reading and studying
the literature on the problems
of contemporary higher educa
tion and the changes occurring
at other institutions of higher
learning, the Committee gathers
ed data on the operation of the
College curriculum irom the
Registrar's office, alumni, stu-
dents, and the Faculty. on the
basis of these efforts, the Com-
mittee was able to develop a
set of propositions which de-
fined a number of areas of con,-
cern at the College.

On the basis at these proposi-
tions, the Committee made sug
gestions on changes in direction
and emphasis in a number of
areas. After consultation with

The BisG man on duty in thl
Physical Plant building did not
have I set of keys. so the li-
brary was not entered until
3:30 3.111., when the night Watch-
man showed up.

The silver necklace was gone,
and in its place hung a strand
of gumdrops and a rubber scor<
plan. Two dollar bills (to pay
for the broken glass?) and I
poem (see page 11) were also
in the case.

President Leggett was notified
of the loss at 7 mm, and h.
notified the Grinnell police.
Chief Peters and an assistant
took several fingerprints from
the case.

The Medallion was found Tues<
day morning by Mr. Alden. it
had been hidden under a desk
behind the reserve book shelves.
It was r e t ur ll 6 d. somewhat
scratched but otherwisa un-
harmed, to the President.

“Sherlock" Alden was also on
another trail. Working on A
hunch that originally occurred
to the 5&8 editor early Monday
morning, he found a library
book referred to in the poem
left in the case. Written on the
overleaf of the book was the
Dewey Decimal number of an-
other book.

On an exciting search that
took much of Tuesday, Mr. Al<
den unearth a virtual anthology
of poems hidden in books in
the library.

As far as the college ls com
cemed, the case ends with the
discovery of the Medallion. The
police, however, are still search-
ing for the person or persons
who stole the necklace, and
have a grand larceny charge
waiting for the daring and po-
etic thievesi
