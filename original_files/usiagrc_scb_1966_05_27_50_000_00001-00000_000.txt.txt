' 228 Seniors Rescue Degrees Today

[yon Tells G ads:
Education Will be
lifetime Concern

Commencement speaker E. Wilson
Lyon told the Class of 1966 that “think-
ing about education will be your liietime
responsibility.” He added that “you have
more than you realize now in prepara-
tion as ‘tuture rulers of state and na-
tion.‘ "

Lyon, who is president of Pomona Col-
lege in Calilnrnia, delivered an address
entitled “This We Possess” to the gradu<
ating seniors this afternoon. He discussed
the extent or higher education today, and
the role or the liberal arts college in pan

Lyon said that while attempts to read
the iuture are hazardous, “one [act
about our society is abundantly evident.
Our country will be increasingly occu-
pied with high education and everything
that pertains to it.”

He said that “in extent and volume
what we are embarking upon dwaris
even the rise of the medieval universi-
ties in Europe, historically regarded as
the greatest age of higher education.”
Education iS now too important to
handle essentially in the sense of the
personal.

Lyon noted his personal experiences
with the American Council of Education.
British Universities and a recent convo-
cation at the Center tor the Study or
Democratic Institutions in Los Angeles,
He cited all three as examples of the
current discussions over “the organi7a-

and the concept or what a professor
should be and do." .

The value of the liberal arts college is
that “it provides the ideal opportunity
