my teeth upon some near-by iron-

St. Caraunus, his lively face split

In my dismay, I tried to tell him
of our old aquaintance, dating

Pianist Gives Excellent

Performance Before Small Crowd
By Kathryn Heinze

. The first Concert of the
semester was presented January
22 in Roberts Theatre by pianist
Nerine Barrett and it may go
down in the annals of history as
one of Grinnell’s more shameful
moments. For those of us who
complain about the cultural void
of the Iowa Cornfields, this
concert was a prime example of
why getting excellent performers
to come to.Grinnell is like pulling
impacted wisdom teeth. We
cannot ask reputable artists to
play to empty concert ‘halls or
on a poor piano. These-problems
were painfully evident on the
evening of Miss Barrett’s recital.
The attendance was so piddling
that any number of music
students could swear to have had
a better turnrout when they
played “Humoresque” at their
first piano recital, and God only
knows What the erratic action of
our twOVyearrold Baldwin did to
her playing.

In spite of these problems, the
hardcore concertrgoers were in
for a treat. Too often Grinnell
audiences are forced to put up
with a program heavily peppered
with renditions of hackneyed
music literature, Miss Barrett,

Suddenly I awoke to a cold grey

however, possessed the good
taste and the intelligence to
present a concert which con-
tained several rarely-performed
and interesting works.

She opened with Mozart’s “Ten
Variations in G on a Theme by
Gluck, ‘Unser dummer Pobel
Meint,’ K. 455,” and had Mozart
heard it, he would have leapt for
joy and smiled at the, heavens.
But in this Work as in the other
two Mozart selections that
followed 7 “Adagio in E minor,
K. 540” and Glgue in G, K. 57 ”
she had definite problems with
the piano. Several keys in the
middle register refused to
respond to anything short of a
good, hard poke. Consequently,
many of her chords were broken
and punctuated with facial
grimaces. It IS embarrassing to
find oneself slave to a faulty
instrument, and this realization
was of no help to her in the Schu-
bert sonata. Although the
“Sonata in A minor, Op. 143” is
a challenging work, her perform-
ance of it was technically solid.
Miss Barrett, howeva, seemed
to have difficulty relaxing into
the keys, and her pauses between
sections were uncomfortably
long. Whether this can be at-
tributed to nervousness or to her
own distinctive style of playing
ishardto say.

The second part of the program
provided Miss Barrett with
numerous opportunities to
display her impressive technique
and musicality. Her performance
of Ravel’s “Valses Nobles et
Sentimentales” told the audience
that she was more at ease. It
is a delightful piece, and she
captured its lilting rhythms quite
successfully. The recital ended
with Prukovief‘s ”Sonata in D
minor, Op. 14,” and I have no
complaints about this work: it
was well executed, and Miss
Barrett appeared to possess the
necessary strength in her playing
that aProkovief sonata demands.

It would have been worthwhile
for anyone to have attended this
concert. The works performed
were of definite merit, and Miss
Barrett is a young and promising

pianist. It is regrettable that her
recital was presented to an
audience of thirtyrfive people and
that she was forced to play on
a malfunctioning piano. Perhaps
little can be done about a small
audience, but the Baldwin could
be taken care of— the city dump
is six miles south oftown.

Lawrence Halls
May Serve Beer

A Lawrence University Com~
munity Council (LUCC) proposal
permitting dormitories to serve
beer during approved parties
held in the living units was signed
this week by President Thomas
S. Smith.

The proposal, under study by
a LUCC committee for me past
year, is directed at encouraging
the use of residence halls for so-
cial activities and at keeping
these activities on campus. Prior
to the enactment of the
legislation, social groups and
residence balls were holding
parties off campus at clubs where
beer was being served. This

- arrangement necessitated trans-

porting students to and from the
parties, and. in some instances,
limited the number of Students
who could participate in a party.

The legislation requires that
parties at which beer is served
must be approved by a majority
vote of the residents
and must be registered with the
Dean’s office. No more than four
parties per term may be held in
aliving unit.

Parties will be limited to the
common areas of the living unit
and beer will be served only
during times designated for a
party. The Dean’s Office wiu be
responsible for regulating the
program.

The swimming test will be
given on Monday and Wednesday
at 3:00 AM. and on Tuesday and
Thursday at 3:00 and 10:00 AM.
for the rest of the quarter. It is
necessary to pass this test to help
fulfill your physical education
reuuirement.
