Bob Fooie Elected
GotHP President

“We'll have to wait until after
the Hall Reorganization Commit«
tee puts forth its proposal on
changes in the hall structure he-
fore much work can hegi ' said
Bob Foote, the new COIHP Presi-
dent. speaking of his future pro-
‘gram.

“The two areas, however, where
work can begin immediately are
I committee on student—138:6 re-
lations and a reformation oi the
men's primary court," continued
Foote. He wants to set up a
CofiiP committee to look into the
men's judicial primary court with
the object of changing it into a
judicial committee. This would do
away with many or the formalis
ties and precedents begun by the
primary court this year without
making a basic change in the stu-
dent government system. A c0<
ordinating committee between stu-
dents and 8&6 is also presently
being set up.

“Open halls are touchy because
at pressure from trustees and the
administration’s past experiences:
nothing will be done in this area
until after the Hall Reorganization
Committee brings out its propos-
at," Foote said. He will also do
nothing on extending the car rule
until the proposal is heard.

Foote, of course, is for a liber-
aliz‘lng of the open dorm program
and allowing juniors the right to
have cars on campus. He also iaw
ors giving senior women unre-
stricted hours.

and Saturday — all the doors or
the loggia are locked half an hour
before closing time with the excep.
tion of four doors, Main. Loose,
ﬂames, and Haines driveway.
Then, at hours, the nightcheck ‘giri
locks Main and the night watchman
locks the other three. The result,
argues the AWS board. is that the
doors are all closed closer to hours.
This results in fairer enforcement
of the closing hours rules, they
feel.

Under the old system, the night
watchman started locking the door:
of the women's halls at Meats and
then walked down the luggia, look-
ing doors as he went. As Dean of
women Jean Slocum pointed out.
he was a slow walker. .

The AWS board felt that this res

Social Budget Independence Nixed
As Senate Meets for last Time

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Meeting {or the last time in its
current form Wednesday, the sen-
ate discussed a recommendation
train the social coordinating com-
mittee that its budget be separate
irom that of the student govern-
ment.

President .ierry Goddard said
that the proposal was “not in the
interests of the Grinnell student
community,“ although he ielt that
the committee’s other recommen-
dations were “thoughtful and ex-
cellent and embody the social ideas
we would like to see on this cam-
pus.”

Goddard said that the Senate is

in a good position to reflect where
the emphasis in programming
should be, because it votes on the
budget. Acceptance of the social
com in i tte e's recommendation
would mean that it would be on a
fixed fee exempt from the bud-
getry process and safe from bud-
get reductions. The means of allot-
ment would be transferred from
the Senate in the administration.

Goddard said, “The students
should have control through their
elected representatives as to how
their money is spent."

In response to a suggestion that
the social committee iclt it could
get more money trim the adminis-

 

EURIPIDES ANTI-WAR play

‘The Trojan Women'
To Play Here Sunday

come down through the centuries
as one of the greatest and most

"The Trojan Women," which
captured almost every dramatic
award possible during its long run
in New York, including the covet-

. ed Drama Critics Circle Award.

'The Troian Women' will be

presented to Grinnell students Sunday.

will be presented here Sunday. 3
and s p.m., in Roberts Theatre.

“The Trojan Women" is a pow.
eriul anti-war play as meaningtul
now as it was in 416 ac, when
it was iirst produced. The passing
years have in no way diminished
the anguished protest this tower-
ing tragedy voices e the universal
cry of outrage against the cmelties
and barbarisms or war.

The Greek tragedian, Euripides,
wrote “The Trojan Women" while
Athens was at war, a few months
alter an especially barbaric act
was committed. The people of the
island oi Melos wished to remain

neutral during the Peloponneslan'
' himself what War is like when one

War, in enraged retribution, the
Athenians enslaved the women and
children and murdered all the a-
dult males.

Euripides, horrified at this mis-
erable byproduct of war, wrote
his play of protest, using the vic-
tory of Greece over Troy as his
theme. “The Trojan Women” has

 

universal tragedies in dramatic
literature. The vanquished Trojans
become the protagonist of the
drama, helpless victims of the
horrors of \var, who, nevertheless,
valiantly strive to retain their no-
biiity.

The late Edith Hamilton, recog-
nized as one of the great scholars
at the classical world, proVided a
new translation ot “The Trojan
Women” which remains true (0 the
original spirit, and yet adapts with
stunning pliability to the demands
of a modern stage — and a mod-
ern audience. Compact, terse langr
uage carries the author’s burning
conviction through the centuries to
a living audience today.

Edith Hamilton Wrote of “The
Trojan Women"; “Euripides asked

looks straight at it. This play is
the answer. He was called the poet
oi the world’s griet. in this play
he sounded the deepest depth of
that grief.”

Tickets are available at the
Forum desk. An activtties card is
required.

 

tration than from the finance com-
mittee. Dan Bucks said it was
probably because the social com-
mittee was not well—iniormed last
year. its expectations were too
high because it thought the entire
budget increase was $11,000, when
it was only $7.000.

Bucks felt the new system 01
having two non-voting members on
the ﬁnance committee, irom the
social coordinating committee and
board of publications w 0 ul d
remedy this.

Goddard said that the social
committee has gotten more in-
creases over the past several years
than all other areas put together.
This is because of rising Costs, but
he said, “The pic is only so big,
and there are only a certain num<
ber of ways we can cut it.”

Money is always requested in ex.
cess of what is available, and the
finance committee tries to bring
the budgets into the realm of the
possible. “No one can get all the
money he wants." ,

The Senate also approved th
finance committee report. The
three items were $350 to the diihyz
ramb committee for the inaugural
Dinner on Saturday. April 15; $100
to the Grinnell Review for experi.
mentation with next year’s issues;
and $110 to send Dan Bucks and
Rick Edwards to the iniercolle<
giate Conference on the Urban
Challenge at M.i.T,

Chris Peterson told the Senate
that the grace minutes proposal
has not yet gone into etiect, al-
though temporary changes in door-
locking procedure began last weeie
end. She said that no student I'EiBP
endum was necessary to approve
the new plan, because it is not a
constitutional change. it will go to
the faculty meeting on Monday
and ii there is no objection there
it will go to the trustees.
