classes, live in residence halls
and participate in extracurri-
cular student activities during
their. stay.

“The governors will make no
formal remarks during their
stay,” said Gilmour. “We feel
that the extensive student con-
tacts constitute the real work
of (he politicianeineresidence
program, with more lasting ef-
fect than a mere formal ad-
dress."

Both governors will attend
the seminar in American Stud-
les (Urbanism) and the Politi-
cal Process class. Hughes will
attend a European History lec-
ture; and Morrison, a class on
Race Relations. The wives,

 

 

meanwhile, will attend fine arts
classes.

stay in Langan Hall, Morrison
in West Norris Hall, Mrs.
Hughes in Haines Hall,.and
Mrs. Morrison in Main Hall. In
special ceremonies Thursday
night, they will be made honor-
ary members of these halls.

‘A Psychological Study of Two Thiigs'
Provides Project for Hicks, Brooks

“Through inane conversation
the play exposes the basic
fears of the characters," stated
Bill Hicks. director of “The
Dumb Waiter,” to be presented
by Hicks and co-actor Steve
Brooks as an independent
theater project on March 1 and
2 in Roberts Theater at 8 pm.

Although neither Hicks or
Brooks is majoring’ in the the-
ater, they classify themselves
as “extracurricular drama mu-
jors.” Both have acted in prew
ious Grinnell performances.

A psychological study or two
thugs in the ‘basement of a
warehouse waiting for their
kill. the play projects the pria
vate, terrors and personal
farces of daily life. “If you
question life, life does away
widi you,” stated director
Hicks. “This is the theme of
the play.

Asked why he picked this
particular work. Hicks said,
"I did it last year‘in Acting
and Directing. The play is in-

l

 

tense for its length. It's differ-
ent because you never know
what’s going on until it's over."

Hicks, who is also designing
the scenery, described the set.
“Previously the play has been
done with a realistic back-
ground, but we’re trying a dii'e
ierent approach. Instead of du—
plicating a room, just the sug-
gestion or a room will be given.
This is the idea of a fragment
ed set."

“One of the main problems,"
according to the pair, ”is time
ing. We have been practicing
since the middle of November
and the play can very easily
get stale. We have to time our»
selves so we will reach the
peak of our performance on
opening night,"

When asked about plans for
ru t u r a dramatic activities,
Hicks stated, ”I would like to
get people interested in a com-
edy but this current project is
enough to keep me busy for
a while."

 

Phil Johnson, a junior polit-
ical science major from Dav.
enport, Iowa, was elected
president of the Student Gov-
ernment Association in‘ n
campus wide election Mon-
day. With 73% or the students
voting, Johnson received a
total of 495 votes.
