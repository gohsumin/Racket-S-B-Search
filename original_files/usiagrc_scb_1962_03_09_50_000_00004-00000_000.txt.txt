Donagan leveled three criti—
cisms at Miss Rand's position.
Her system does not deal with
the problem of institutions in
the 20th ccntury. Secondly. she
is wrong about what many re-
ligions term as “Original sin."
Thirdly, she lalsely identiﬁes
creative personalities with the
ability to barter. In Donagan's
view, to be sharp in husincss
'- not neccssai-ily to be crelb
tive.

In spite of the fact that Dona.
tgan‘s criticism invalidates Miss
‘Fiand's political solutions. he be—
lieves that she is an "thl‘emer
good and improving lnurnlist.”
