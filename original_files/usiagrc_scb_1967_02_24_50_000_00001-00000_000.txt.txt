A Review of 'Mfter the Full"

thculcr productions but changed to movies oe-
cruise his round it “dliiicnit to review plays
where your rrieuds are involved.” Know.
ing this is align the case at Grlimt-H loo. ins
set'a Weill “outside" to rind someone to deal
with “Alter the rail." Here he is.

“If we are all innocent, where does all this
evil come from?" Quentin asks in the Grinnell
College production of Arthur Miller’s “After the
Fall." Where indeed? For three hours the audi-
ence is questioned, preached at, raged at,
threatened, teased, cajuled and pummeled as
Mrr Miller tries to answer his own question. The
production is a failure, but more than half the
failure is Miller’s for having written a terribly
self-conscious, embarrassingly introspective play.

The first question is does one want to he the
target of a marathon monologue (punctuated with
flashrbaci-ts and tidrbit remembrances) ni Quen-
tin’s life? Is he all that fascinating as a charac-
ter, as he inarticuiateiy gropes with every Con<

ceivable question pertaining to life, liberty and
the pursuit oi happiness? is the theatre a pulpit?
Must a man out himself open in lull View of the
World and spill his innards out? Will it necessar-
ily be engrossing theatre it he does? To be sure.
he will occasionally hit a target relative to each
individual audience member if he goes on long
enough (and he does) but will that justify or in-
sure the success of the whole? it won't and it
doesn't. And this is the mammoth problem the
cast and director of the Grinnell production (or
any production) are confronted with.

All in all, they do surprisingly well, consider-
ing the handicap imposed by the overwritten
script. But even so, the final result is a kind oi
cocktail party lapel hanging by someone who has
had too much to drink and eventually begins to
bore his captive listener, The cast is uneven,
as are most college productions. Ken Hicks is n
tolerable Quentin once he hits his stride, but he
falls into repetitious patterns of movementi

Selective Service
Moiy Eliminate
2-5 Classification

By Susan Fogg

Student draft deierments may
be eliminated in a reform of
the Selective Service Act due
to go into etiect by June 20.
An article in the Feb, 10 issue
of Higher Education and Na-
tional Affairs states:

The National Advisory Com-
mission on Selective service,
appointed by president John-
son last July 2, is completing
the ilnal draft of its report
and is expected to submit its
recommendations to the Pres-

At its meeting Wednesday
night, the Senate discussed the
suggestions or a court-appointed
committee concerning the re-
vision oi the present judicial
system. The proposed changes
would involve the dissolution oi
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs and the student
courts, There would be instead
a judicial council consisting of
three students and three faculty
members and a faculty — stu-
dent ~ administration commit»
tee on policy evaluation and
recommendation would be in-
stalled.

According to Linda Neal,
chief magistrate oi the Women’s
Court, the proposed judicial
council would have jurisdiction
over all cases involving an in-
traciion or college regulations.
Secondary iunctions would be
those of a court oi appeals for
cases tried within the house
councils, and reviewing board
ior hall regulations

The Senate was iniormed that

these are only suggestions to be
worked upon in the following
weeks The iinal proposal must
he passed in nearly identical
term by both the Senate and
the taculty, as it involves n
change in both the student
constitution and the faculty or-
ganization. it appears that this
will not be so easily done.

Already, the basic problem
seems to be confusion, or at
least doubt, concerning the
council’s primary jurisdiction
over iniracted regulations. Ac-
cording to Miss Neal it is now
uncertain as to whether the
oouncii would serve in an ad
visory or decision-making ca-
pacity.

Joseph Wall, {acuity chair-
man, differing somewhat in his
interpretation, believes that a
recommendation would be sent
to the president only in cases
involving punishment. in the
event of an acquittal, the case
would be dismissed.

While this poll shows a significant positive response to the idea
nivoi‘frcampus apartment living. it must he 'cnutioned that people
who reply to such a questionnaire may be those who favor the
proposition in question. On the other hand, the overwhelmingly ai-
ilrmatwe response to this questionnaire and
the fact that the aiiirmative response in-
creases with each succeeding class are trends
which cannot be ignoled in any determination
of students' attitudes toward the environment
in which they live, or in which they would
like to live.

The ﬁgures show, whether they are wholly representative of
campus opinion or not, that at least 217 students would choose to
live in on campus apartments it they were readily available, This
is a sizable percentage in a student body at 1,150 and indi-
cates not only dissatisfaction with the present residence system,
but a positive response to an alternative system which is feasible.

would be willing to rent apartments to both male and female stu-
dean and that apartments and rooms in private homes not handled
by real estate agencies are equally available, with rents averaging
$90 per month for or rooms,
