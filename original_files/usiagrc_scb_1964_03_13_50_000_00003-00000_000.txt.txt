Grinneii's ACLU Head Presents

Lane's Opinions on Assassination

To the Editor:

A shadow of secrecy clouds
the investigation of President
Kennedy’s assassination While
public and world opinion com»
pelled President Johnson to ap-
point the present commission
headed by Justice Warren, its
original intent, to Conduct a full
public investigation of the
assassination, has been trans-
formed into a supercsecret
probe. Warren himself has
stated “some of the facts in
this case will never be known
In your lifetime” The Warren
Commission is restricting its in-
yestigation only to evidence
submitted by the Dallas Police,
FBI, and the Secret Service
Before public protest, led by
Mark Lane, was voiced, the
Commission refused to have
counsel appointed for Oswald,
and denied the right of cross«
examination; they still refuse
the right of presentation of new
evidence, and have maintained
their secrecyr

, Under these circumstances

Mark Lane, a prominent New ’

.York lawyer and former as-
selnblyman, decided to submit
to the Warren Commission a
lawyer's brief evaluating the
evldence leaked to the public.
Lane was astonished to discov-
er numerous contradictlons in
the government’s case. startled
by his findings. he determined
to conduct his own investiga-
tion by going to Dallas and in-
terviewing witnesses. He has
obtained interviews, photostats
of police affidavits, and other
information directly Contradict-
ing the government‘s contenr
tioiis. '

Some of his
been:

findings have

 

(l) The murder weapon was
transformed from a German
Mauser to an Italian Carbine
after the FBI discovered that
Oswald had ordered an Italian
rifle from a mail order house.

(2) The manufacturer of the
Italian Carbine Stated that in
his opinion the weapon was in-
capable of the accuracy needed
to shoot the-President from the
sixth floor ’of the Book Deposi-
tory Building,

(3) The authorities claim
that three shots were fired, yet
ﬁve bullets were found.

(4) The opinion of four doc-
tors auending Kennedy at Park—
land Hospital that the wound in
the neck was an entrance
wound has changed after the
FBI presented the doctors with
a felt accompli. ‘

(5) The witness to Tippitt's
murder swore the murderer
was “short, stocky, with curly
hair"; Oswald was medium
height, and thin with sparse
hair.

(6) The paraffin test by an em
pert determined that Oswald
probably did not fire a riﬂe
on November 22‘

(7) According to the District
Attorney’s own report, Oswald
walked out of the surrounded
Dallas Book Depository Build-
ing unmolested, walked three-
quarters of a mile, took a bus
back to where he had walked
from, took a taxi with a non-
existent taxiedrlver threerquar—
ters of a mile past his house,
and then went back home to get
a coat on a warm day, leaving
$150 in his roomr

Mr. Lahe, based on his inves-
tiagtion, raises other ques-
tions; he makes no claim to

Sanity of Stones

A great deal of money has
been made recently since the
death of President Kennedy
“Memorial books" selling for $2
each have been printed by both
the AP and UPI and have sold
in the millions of copies. Other-
mementoes of the late Presi-
dent include a 97c JFK salt and
pepper set; a candy bar named
“Vig'ah”; an “Eternal Flame
of Light to Remember" selling
for 31 which is advertised to
burn for 50,000 hours; JFK
phonographs, records, photo‘-
graphs, busts, desk weights,
etc.

Newsweek recently called it
a “memorial boom" and has
quoted a Washington. D. c.,
novelty manufacturer as say-
ing: “People are always hun-
gry for the buck."

“Togetherness” it appears,
according to the Burlington
County (N. J,) Department of
Civil Defense, is just one more
virtue of nuclear war. If you're
one of those stubborn people
who is unable to realize how
"close" family members get to
each other while cramped to-
gether inside a fallout shelter,
then you obviously haven't

 

heard about “Operation Togeth-
erness” — the latest thing in
modern family livingiconducte
ed January 18 and 19 in Marl-
ton, N. J.

in order to prove that even
under the minor stresses of a
nuclear war life can be wonder-
ful, more than 200 Volunteers
emiombed themselves for 24
hours “under exactly the same
conditions as might be expect-
ed in any public shelter in the
event of a nuclear attack,"
During the 24 hours the volun-
teers slept on cuts and ate “sur-
vival biscuitsr" Realism was
provided by a tape recording
public address system which
simulated the warning period
followed by the attack, with

simulated radio messages re-l

porting conditions in the area
and across the United States.
All the volunteers, as far as it
is known, appear to have sur-
vived the experience

Of course, there are always
a few malcontents who don't
believe in such things as “to»
getherness." TWO hundred local
residents picketed the shelter
while “Operation Together-
ne‘s's'VWas being conduCtédl'

 

knowledge of the assassin (5)
he does maintain that if we
are to accept the news leaks,
Oswald could not have been
the assassin, Of course it may
logically be argued that the
government has not divulged
pertinent information which
might contradict Lane's as-
sumptions. Hence what is need-
ed is an open public hearing
where all the facts can be
weighed before a commission
which is representative of the
American public, not a former
CIA Chief, a former FBI agent,
two Dixiercrats, a Republican
Senator, and on inﬂuencial
businessman, who presently
constitute the Commission.

The petition which is being
circulated this week calls for
an "open public hearing," and
requests “that some counsel
representing the interests of
the late Lee Harvey Oswald be
permitted the right of cruss~ex—
aminau‘on and the right of pre-
sentation of evidence bearing
upon (Oswald's) role, if any,
in the assassination. r . ."

A nation-wide organization
has been formed on this basis.
Groups are springing up on
numerous campuses. The pres-
sure which these groups have
generated has already con-
vinced the Warren Commission
to appoint a lawyer for Oswald
and to allow Mark Lane to tes~
tify. Public opinion can also
influence the government to
call an open public hearing.
