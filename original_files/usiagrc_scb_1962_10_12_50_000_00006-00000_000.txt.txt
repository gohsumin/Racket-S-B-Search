Grinnell's unbeaten football
team will risk its pericct rec-
ord against a young and sure
prisingly good Coc team in a
Homecoming hattlc here tomor-

row.

Coo. with only eight ex-
perienced players returning
from last year's squad, was a
preseason choice to wind up
in the second division, out the
Kohawks have put themselves
in contention for the title by
posting a 271 record and tying
for second in conference
standings.

The Kohnwks dropped the‘
opening game to St. olaf he-
iore upsetting highly rated
Riponl Last week they mauled
Knox 34-0.

COE EXHIBITS a strong run-
ning attack from a wmg»T of—
fense. Halfhack Ken Poling,
fullback Jack Fridley and quar-
terback Warren Nicholas pro»
vide the offensive punch,

The Kohzlwks have an exper-
icnced defensive line which
runs several defenses. The over-
all team speed is good.

Pioneer conch Edd Bowers

is looking toward Coe as a
crucial game. “It's :I real im—
portant game against a coming
team. A win could put us in
an excellent position in the
conference," he stated.

Bowers does not plan any ina-
jor Changes for the game. Hr.
will, however, make greater use
of offensive and defensive pla-
icons (ham he has in the past.

Grinnell’s varsity Iootball
team used a staunch defense
and a crushing ground attack
last Saturday to roll over its
most formidable conference con—
tender, Lawrence The score of
the game, played in Appleton,
was 21—7.

oneers immediately assumed
command of the game hy
marching the 50 yards in 10
plays and running across the 2
point conversion to lead 2370
with 7:07 remaining in the 1st
quarter.

Dick Orchard scored the
points for Grinnell, rolling out
one way for the TD and the
other for the conversion, Dur-
ing this initial drive, 22 and
16 yard passes from Orchard
to Dunn were key plays.

Freshman Coach Terry Moore’s
tootballers open their season to-
day against Coe on Ward ﬁeld.

Both teams will use the

rently popular in the Midwest
Conference. In this ottense, a
.halfback lines up one yard

his end on every play. To 191s

fans should be alert for the
use of the belly series and
trap plays as Grinnell will em-
phasize the two,

Coe is expected to hold an-
other strong freshman team,
making this a ditticult contest

for the Pioneers who have been
hurt by an exceptionally small
turn out of only 23 men. This
lack of depth could be vital, al—

second quarter when a Viking
punt rolled dead on the Grin-
ncll as. The Pioneers, featuring
a 22-yard Art Peterson to Gene
Kowert pass, drove the 64 yards
to the goal in 11 plays and
scored with 7.35 loft in the first
halt: Once again, Orchard cov-
ered the final yardage on a

AN UNUSUAL aspect of this
depth shortage is that there are
six capable guards, yet icw ends
or tackles. Moore is-searching
for an end who has size and can
catch the hall. in comparison
with the line, the backs are in
good shape, and are the strong
point of the team.

Moore tccls that this year's
team has developed more quick—
ly than his 1951 trosh squadl
This, he says, is because Moore!
and h|S student assistants, Bill
Henry and Dick Nye, can work
more closely with 23 men, and
the young coach has one year or
experience under his belt. ;

impressed with the calihre
of athletes on the team, Moore
says, “They are all toprnotch
