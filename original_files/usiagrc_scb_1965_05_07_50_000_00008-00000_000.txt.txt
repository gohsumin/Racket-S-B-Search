As the spring sports season heads into the home stretch,
the Pioneer golf team looks like the best bet to bring a con-
ference crown to Grinnell. After an opening loss to Iowa
State 61/2 - 8V2, the linksmen have whipped off six straight
victories, including five conference wins.

The golf team’s one non-conference win was over Drake
141/2-Vr. The list of conference victims includes Monmouth
14V2-l/2, Coe 131/2-1V2, Beloit 16-8, and Carleton 9-6. The Pio-
neers also avenged, on Tuesday, their one defeat of last year
with an 11-4 win over Cornell.

The last four matches for the Pioneers that were played
here on Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday give a good picture
of the team.

On Friday the Pioneers beat Beloit 16-8. In the individual
competition three golferSADave Sellergren, Ted Risser, and
Dave Shellenbargerawon while Eric Miller tied. In the 2-man
best ball competition Sellergren and Risser also won their
match.

On Saturday the Pioneers had a big triangular meet with
Drake and Carleton. Against Drake all five Grinnell golfers
—Risser, Sellergren, Mike Miller, Eric Miller, and Jeff Kohl-
man—notched victories in the rout. Risser, Sellergren, and
Mike Miller also won in the match with Carleton as the
Pioneers ran away with the meet victory. In this meet Kisser
also took medalist honors with a 70 While Sellergren and
Mike Miller both had 723.

On Tuesday the golfers had a match with Cornell and
whipped them easily. Risser, Sellergren, Eric Miller, and
Dave Shellenbarger all won in this meet.

Among the six golfers on the team, three are now unde-
feated and only one, the sixth man on the team, is under .500
in dual meet competition. The three undefeated linksmen
are number one man Ted Risser with a 5-0-2 record, number
two man Dave Sellergren with a 7-0 record and number

'five man Dave Shellenbarger
with a 5-0 record.

Number three man Mike
Miller and number four man
Eric Miller have 43 and 4-2
records respectively. .1 e ff
Kohlman, ,,who shares the
number five spot with Shellen-
barger, has a 1-2 record.

The golfers will finish
their season with the confer-
ence meet at Knox next week-
end. I do not want to put a
jinx on the team by predicting
a victory. But the fact is that
it will take a minor miracle
to keep this team from fin-
ishing near the top in the
standings.

As coach Merrill J archow of
Carleton said after the Pio-
neers snapped his team's three
match Winning streak: “Grin
nell will be the team to beat
in the conference meet.”

Nelmen Beat Ripon,
lose to luwrence

The Grinnell varsity tennis
team was on the tennis courts
from 9:00 am. until 6:30 p.m. last
Saturday. The Pioneers met both
Ripnn and Lawrence on Grinnell'l
courts.

Ripon was supposed to he the
tougher oi the two schools, but the
Pioneers won four of six singles
matches and two of three doubler
to win 6-3.

Winning for the Pioneers were
Greenfield (No. 3). Hicks (No. 4)
Lovell (No. 5) and Kinsey (No, a).
Grinnell's second doubles team of
Clymer and Greenfield, a confer-
ence title threat, won in three sets
as did the third doubles team of
Lovell and Hortonr Clymer and
Greenfield have not lost a doubles
match since the season opener at
Carleton.

The afternoon match against
Lawrence proved tougher on the
Pioneers. Grinnell managed to will
only one singles match outright.

Clymer (No. 2) won 6-1, M, 64.
Mike Greenfield, playing his sec-
ond marathon match of the day,
agreed to terminate play after two
sets in order to begin doubles play.
Greenfield Won the ﬁrst set 11-9,
but lost the second set 7,9,

In doubles, the Pioneers almost
swept Ripon. Clymer and Green-
iield won again, as did Horton and
Lovell in three sets. But Shannon
and Hicks, playing No. l doubles.
were unable to defeat their Ripon
opponents, despite a victory in the
first set.

The ﬁnal score DI the Lawrence
contest was Lawrence 51/2, Grin-
nell 3I/2.

The netmen are playing at Belolt
today. If they continue to play
good tennis, they should have lit-
tle trouble with Beloit. The Pio-
neers have one more match be-
fore the conference match. On
Monday, the netmen entertain
Iowa State on the Grinnell courts.
ISU is favored.
