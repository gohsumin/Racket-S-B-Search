Inaugural Events Will Honor President

teggett Address Will Concern Role
Of Individuals in College Community

Weekend Feature:
A Milli Original

By JUDY SCOTT

BBtG has had to stretch its in-
genuity for the Inaugural Week-
end. At first it seemed a small
request: find a 400 foot canopy,
needed to run [mm the science
building to Darby tor Sunday‘s
procession as protection against
possible rain.

According to Physical Plant Di-
rector Evan Walden, there was no
canopy to be found ill Waterloo,
Des Moines, or anywhere else in
Iowa or its neighboring slates.
After the fruitless search, B&G
constructed one using wood sup-
ports and a polyethylene covering

Despite Walden's iii-st illtent to
get a “candy - striped, or some
such iancy one,” B&G's own cre-
ation ivas originally designated to
be painted black. Then black was
rejected as too ”iunei'alish”;
white was the next possibility but
was also thrown out as being too
blar' g The ﬁnal decision was a
luscious, light olive green which
should blend in nicely with the
general complexion color of the
inaugural participants it the wea-
ther does turri toui. Then again,
since the canopy is one of the
biggest expenses tor the weekend
it would almost be a shame if
it did not, at least, lightly sprinkle.

plies to the residential college. He
will put emphasis on the preser-
vation of individual identity while
increasing and improving methods
of communication between educa-
tors and students.

This communication will entail
the continuing involvement or the
iaculty in the total community
Leggett observes that the students
have become separated irom the
community, and that while this
has served its own purpose, it is
now time for a new understand-
ing hetweeli the students and edu-
caters.

ln Leggelt’s view, Grinnell is “a
college that takes the risk or do-
ing only one thing and doing it
well.” This thing is an under-
graduate, liberal arts education

Alarm About Faculty Departures

oii campus lately there have
been growing concerns about the
rate at which members or the fac-

departure, and is the current rate
alarming?

One of the universal observa-

heads and administration mem-

problem in high faculty mmover
is not a problem at all. One pro-
iessor said that perhaps the issue
is not that too many prolessors
are leaving, but that too few
are leaving. The reasoning behind
this is that a moderate turnover
or faculty members indicates the
willingness of the college to seek
new ideas. One professor went on
to say that this does not necessarily
mean that there is dissatisfaction
with the existing staff, as can be
seen by the consistently high qualr
ity of the faculty

Another observation made was
that there was not a problem oi
faculty moi-ale involved in the pres
sent turnover. it was, of course,
admitted that a person would not
leave a position if he were pet:
iectly satisiied with the position
and wanted nothing more. Howard

Saw Little Sell-Motivation Here

Seymour Katz (English) leaves
Grinnell at the end of May to
teach at the University or Massa-
chusetts’ new Boston campusi

As a member oi the college’s
division of humanities, Katz will
teach three courses in humanities.
He also hopes to teach American
Literature when such courses are
termed.

“I have two reasons for leav-
ing,” Katz said. “I want to try
a dllfercnt kind of institution and
gain a diiiereut sort or experience
in my career. Grinnell, alter all,
has been my only teaching exper-
icnce thus far.”

Katz’s second reason tor leaving
Grinnell is his desire to be closer
t0 the Eastern research libraries.
He plans to continue work on Save
eral l-iawthoi-ne papers which
will eventually toim part ot
a book. He has been doing research
on Hawthorne tor the past tour
years.

“I think the students are very
agreeable, capable. and interested,

 

and they pertorm well — when
you ask them. But," said Katz,
“I see very little self-motivation

and reaching out. Occasionally
students ‘catch lire,‘ but never a
whole class."

Katz stated that in his eight
years at Grinnell he has found
the challenge “a continuously ex-
citing one, tlle courses interesting
and of a great variety, and a
wonderrul freedom to experiment
in those courses.”

Next year's English department
at Grinnell is Viewed by Katz as
very challenging. He referred
particularly to the new courses in
American Studies,
