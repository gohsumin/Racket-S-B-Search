Based on grades ior iirst semester, 175 students made the Dean’s List. To qualify tor
a place on the list, according to Dean oi the College James H. Stauss, a Grinnellian must
take enough credit hours (twelve hours) to qualify him as a tull-time student.

Those maintaining grade-point averages oi 3.5 or better or those who rank in the top
ten percent gradewise tor the semester (which ever group has a larger number) have let-
ters of recognition sent to their homes and news releases on their vast accomplishment

The 5&3 received a number oi inqui es lrom students who received incompletes in
courses, thereby preventing them tronr making the Dean’s List. Dean Stauss assured the
son that alter grades are substituted for the incompletes, students who would make the
list based on their grade-point average wouid then be sent letters or recognition.

THE RIGHT

BY
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

Twice in a single month, gentlemen oi the Right have applied
pressure on me to modity my views — not so much on things in
general, but on things particular, namely themselves.

Pressure is the gentler word for blackmail. most specifically
threatened by Mr. Robert welch, the head of the John Birch So-
ciety, who grieves because neither 1 nor any thoughtful conserva-
tive have found it possible to share his delusions. I wrote recently
about the John Birch Society, to comment on an analysis of it!
gradual disintegration as described in the Wall Street Journal,
and now Mr. Welch has replied in tones most threatening.

“ . In all seriousness,” he writes in the current Bulletin of
the John Birch Society. “we now make to Mr. Buckley the legen-
dary otter by an oldtime honest politician to one of his opponents:
‘You refrain from telling falsehoods about me, and I’ll continue
to retrain trom telling the truth about you! which,” says Mr.
Welch leeringly, “under the circumstances disclosed by our bulg-
ing tiles, about Buckley and some or lils associates, is a very gens
erous otter, indeed."

Mr. H. L. Hunt of Dallas is most easily identified as the rich-
est man in the world. I had never before wrltten about him, but
wheir a month ago the Saturday Evening Post asked me whether
I ielt 1 could write an essay in deiense of the rich, I accepted the
challenge, even athwart the massive presence of MI. Hunt, a man
7 as I put it — of “eccenlrlc understanding of public affairs, 0‘
yahoo bigotry, and of appallingly bad manners.“

Embarking on a one~lnan campaign to prove my point, Mr.
Hunt began by writing are a garbled and rather pathetic letter,
closing with the suggestion (hat I “make some amends,” and sing
gesting that I might “Say something favorable about something I
have done or am doing if you can find anything.”

whereupon Mr. Hunt began to barrage newspaper editors with
exposures oi my own political infidelity, the suspicious company
I keep, and a defense of his own pllblic.career, most of Whlch, at
the moment, is Vested in a radio program called Life Line.

The unguarded Mr. l'luut informs the editors that "Lile Line is
not dominated by my rlglibwlng politics nor by any ioundalion I
own. Llle Line actl‘lltles are conducted by Life Line Foundation,
its president, Board of Directors, Board of Advisors, writers,
speakers and other gifted Freedom technicians."

Having established the total independence of Life Line, Mr.
iluut writes that “it could serve a good purpose it it becomes
known precisely where (Buckley) stands,” and appends a copy
oi the Internal Security Subcommittee’s Guide to Subversive 0r-
ganizations and Publications, earmarked to show “Frank s. Meys
er.” an Editor or National Review > ”From 1938-1941 director of
the Chicago Workers School, which was under the direction of the
Communist Party” and “Will Herberg” -— Associate of National
Review, “former Managing Editor cl Revolutionary Age, official
organ ol the Communist Party.”

Mr. Hunt does not mention that the Senate Internal Security
Suhcolnmlttec has published testimony and essays by Mr. Frank
Meyer. Or that l alluded to the work oi Dr. Herberg as among the
classics or an:i»Commulusm . . . probably because he doesn’t
know.

Nor does he know the riot-st oi it, which now, under the press
sure oi exposure by him and Mr. Welch, l publicly confess, for the
first time.

I an! a Russizn agent. My real name is Buhkliski, and during
the months of July and August 1946 — nobody has ever asked me
where l was during July and August 1946, which shorts what is
happe . g to our internal security — the real william Buckley
J12, touring in Eulee, was abducted; and I, who had been trains
ing at an espionage Denier in a Moscow Suburb, began my long
impersonal: r l‘iiy payniaster at Yale University was me Catho-
lic chaplain.

What happened to the real bucklcy — he was an awfully nice
fellow 7 I don’t know, though the tumor ill the Party is that he is
back in [he States, rising the pseudonym David Flye. My order-s
wore in penetrate the right wing and immobilize and otherwise
cause damage. My successes hate been extraordinary. and indeed
seuu Into the back of my lrlpcl, in imiSlhle thread, is the Order of
Lellllt.

l siiiglchandcdly contrived the ioliiistown llootl, Hurricane
Esther, tile Vietnam War, (Hid the election of John Lindsay.

Nﬂw l have been caught. But if I had it (o (it) all over again,
lltl rio the same g tor the glory oi the revolution,

As Stalin used to say, to me — \Vllal ﬂ wise old one he proved
to be — “you're doing line Olily hatch out tor H. L. Hunt and
Robert \i/clchky. They're the only ones we haven't been able to
toolslty.”

How right he was.
