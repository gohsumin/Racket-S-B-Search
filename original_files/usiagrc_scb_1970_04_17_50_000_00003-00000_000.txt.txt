New Senate Calls Self
'The Student Vanguard"

by Toni th-contieiit

The New Senate. consisting
mostly of nervous ircshmeii and
jaded sophomores, was
predictably siiy and coiitrite at
the opening of their first meeting
Aiter two hours had elapsed.
however, the Senators realized
tiiat iiiey had not only shot one
whole evening down the tubes,
but also missed a Humphrey
Bogart ilick on TV
t“CaSablanca" constars
Claude Raiiies and Ingrid
Bergman) By two, they were
visibly irritated The color had
drained out oi Kit Cage's com-
plexion, Bill Kilpatrick was
suffering writer’s cramp, and
Golda Mass was on the verge
of collapse from underexcite-
inent. At the risk of appearing
to be under the sponsorship of
one of our rival publications 1
can only say: “Free the Student
Senate."

Mary Brooner brought up the
subject of proposed eon
educational iiall changes. Mary
said that one program called for
educational living by rooms.
tTiiis shall be known as the Loose
proposal.) There is also another
proposal in exislance which
suggests coeducational living by
floors. tThis shall be known as
the NotrSonLoose proposal 1

Mary then coniirmed the
rumor that the studentrwide
questionnaire on hetero»~ual
living was poorly administered
and. lurihermore, the
questionaire that had been
returned had not been tabulated,

The Senate moved to make a
resolution in iavor of the Loose
proposal John Onstead cons
tended that the Senate should not
make such a proposal now.
because tiic untabulated
questionnaires were meant to
assess tiic student's opinion on
the subject, John was countered
by AI Cohen. “That doesn't
matter We're not representing
anything " Amen,

Belorc the gathered throng
launched a discussion on the B&G
strike, Greg Vraniear bestowed
a new epithet upon the Senate

7 “The Vanguard oi Student
Opinion” With a chorus ot

‘ltlghtron tno opposed, one ab-
stentiont the Senate adopted
the mnilicker as its own. This
action is Significant in that it

MikePenziier rose to say that
the Vanguard of Student Opinion
had asked for donations to a
strike fund and no one was giving
any money. A] Cohen rose to say
that the Vanguard oi Student
Opinion had asked students to
join picket lines, and that there
was only ‘\‘a‘ trickle”. of par-
tictpation.

Mike Peiizner, who has con-
ducted a zealous fund raising
drive lor the strike fund,
suggested that Thursday’s allr
campus meeting be held at 3:00
AM, in the James third john.
Tiiat way, not only can the
stiidcnls discuss the issues, bul
the strike fund people can line
everyone five bucks a piece for
quiet hours. The Senate
dismissed this motion however,
because there is no john on
J'dn‘icsthlrd.

Chuck Garman wanted the
Senate to put the squeeze on the
initiative lurid for it “Macrobiotic
Dinner" to be cooked by one John
Larsen on April 23. When asked
how macrobiotic food differed
from tlle lood that would be
served at Saga that night, Chuck
said that Macrobiotic iood has
no preservatives The Senate
pointed out that Saga food doesn't
have preservatives either,‘ but
Chlick and Ron Stclnllorn went
onto explain that iood is organic,
and therciore. its preparation
and consumption are not
disruptive to the natural enr
\iil‘onment

President Loewi used his
discriminatory powers and asked
for a hand VDIC instead of a votce
vote on the issue of the
macrobiotic dinner. Locwi said
later that a voice vote was imr
posSihlc because Bill Thomas
was eating a Forum hamburger
