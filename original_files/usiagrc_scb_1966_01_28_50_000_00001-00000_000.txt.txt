semester, but on the whole preter-
red ending the fall semester

cent survey by the 5&3 revealed.

Of the 250 survey forms re-
turned. 69.5 per cent favored the
new semester exam schedule,
with an additional 5.25 per cent
iavoring the early exams. but a
shortened Christmas vacation.
Some suggested a longer mid«
term break in the tall and more
breathing space at the end of the
semester for written work and ex-
am preparation. Only 18 per cent
advocated a return to the old sys-
tem, with exams following Christe
mas vacation. Seven and a quar-
ter per cent indicated indifference
on the questionnaire.

Pressure Greater

Comparing last fall with pre-
Vious fall semesters at Gi‘inilell, 41
per cent indicated that they found
the pressures on them toward the
end much greater. Another 31 per
cent said the pressures seemed
slightly greater. Twenty per cent
of the Students found end-of-the
semester pressures unchanged,

 

while only 3 per cent indicated
that they seemed less than usual.

The lengthy Christmas break pro-
vided 60 per cent of those ques-
tioned to do more unrequited
reading than during previous va-
cations. Twentyrsix per cent said
they did the same amount of un-
required reading, while 14 per

per cent found it lighter. They

clined in 25 per cent.

caused major inconveniences to 12
per cent of those questioned. On
the other hand, a few students
and faculty members suggested

gust to aViid such tight finals

reading during last semester as
more, is per cent; less, 31 per
cent; and the same, 53 per cent.

Move to Abolish Student Senate
Progresses in Wednesday Session

By LIBBY PANNWITF

Wednesday night, after a week
ot deliberating on the subject of
reorganizing the present student
government system. the Student
senate came to a vote of 1277 in
favor of putting the proposed
changes into amendment form.

As it stood last week, the major
changes involved tlle abolishment
of the Senate, and the establish
ment of a Council of House Pres-
idents by combining the AWS
Board and the Coil-1P.

SGA President Jerry Goddard
opened the evening’s discussion to
general questioning from the sen-
ators and members of the commit-
tee iormed last week to draft the
iinal proposal,

The discussion covered the fol-
lowing general areas:

1) Will the proposed system en-
courage enough participation of
students not actively involved in
SSA?

2) At present the administration
doesn't discuss its actions enough
with the Senate. This is not the
fault of the Senate and Should not
be used as a point of criticism.

3) Will the coordination of the
AWS Board and the CofHP be a
more efficient system and Still
representative of the students?

4) Karen Lauterbach said those
in favor of abolishing the Senate
were those who were never active
in the Senate, and that the Senate
was effective as a political train-
ing ground and accomplished a
great deal.

5) in the past the Senate has
been given more of a chance to
be an effective part of the student
government, some senators said.
This year it has not been given
the chance and has been Worked
around in general, these senators
contended.

“The important thing," Goddard
Said, “is what each [if uS consid-
ers student government to be. I
think that the SGA functions to do
a job—to govern eiiectively and
also to talk with college officials.”

Chris Peterson, AWS Board
President, said, “Any system you
haveethe Senate or the new pro<
posed system—depends a lot on
personalities involved. It‘s only

Poverty Speeches in Des Moines

Seen As Pioiett

By DAVE DILLON

“I see no reason whatsoever
why students cannot and should
not be involved in community af-
fairs, anymore than 1 can under—
stand why more universities and
colleges are not more actively in-
volved in the community from
which they draw their money and
in which they participate to a
great extent. . .1 think this is a
university and a college responsi-
bility,” This was the response of
Office of Economic Opportunity
Specialist and Grinnell graduate
Walter Valverde to a question
about student work in social ac—
tion projects.

Other leaders of the ”Governor's
Conference on Community Action
Problems" held last Friday in
Des Moines affirmed the active
