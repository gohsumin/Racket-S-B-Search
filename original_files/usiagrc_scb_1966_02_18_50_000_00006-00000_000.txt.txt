Intious with the faculty and ad-

making itself more interesting to
more people, faculty and students
alike.

Sheitder feels that SGA should be

unrest and dissent. and political
activny, and not just for the re-
organization or itself. “Concern
with campus problems will lead
to broader and more serious con-
cerns about the world, which are
now lacking on this campus.”

He approves or such groups as
the Griunell Committee [or Stu-
dent Involvement and would like
to see the tics: working closely
with the Senate to expose wide.
divergent views. He would also
like the SCSI to develop into a
political party to keep the campus
alive between considerations OI
major issues. It opposing parties
subsequently arose, tuture son
elections could be more crucial.

The iaculty and administration
should be considered the friends
or the SGA and not just a group
or adults trying to impose a mor—
tality on the student body.

“Rule changes don’t come meree
1y because a student leader him-
self expresses a desire for them.
It must he made evident to the
administration that student con-
item is serious This will foster
serious communication, and it is
in this new atmosphere that rule
changes can best be eiiected,"

Among the issues that can be

 

raised are more open rooms. an
alteration of women's hours, and
greater automobile privileges.

An example of how he believes
an issue can be raised and pre-
sented to the administration is in
regard to more open rooms. Shen-
der would present such a request
in the context of the privacy issue,
with more open rooms as provid
ing the chance tor small groups
of students to meet and talk on
weekday aiternoons. Thus the em-
phasis would not be on open bed-
rooms, where it has so often been
misplaced.

“We can stay quiet and satis-
fied and there won’t be any real
noise on campus, but we have to
show the administration that we
want to talk, and they will listen
it serious student support is
shown."

Leadership and personality are
the key characteristics of a good
president, according to Shender.

“The president needs a willing-
ness to get others involved, and
must be the kind of person that
others are willing to work for.

“I welcome ideas from other
people, I don’t have all the an-
swers~nobody does. The more
people get together, the more ideas
will emerge. For the past sev-
eral years the student government
has taken the too-many-cooksA
spoilethesbroth attitude. but they
don't even know any more what
they are cooking."

Along these lines, Shenl‘ler would
put out an SGA Editorial News-
letter to acquaint everyone with
current campus problems and
views.

Physics Professors
Make the Big Time

“Evaluation of Commercial Ap<
paratus tor Measuring Me." an
article by Roger J. Hanson and
Beryl Er Clotlelter, appeared in
the January issue or the Ameri-
can Journal of physics

The article evaluates the use,
in an undergraduate laboratoty,
of commercial equipment lor the
measurement of the ratio of
Planck's constant to the charge ot
an electron.

The two professors tested the
equipment and prepared the arti-
cle at the request or the American
Institute of Physics' Center for ed—
ucational apparatus in physics.

would also reach many people and
would necessitate the cooperation
of many. Shender feels that this
would be a good way to merge
student and faculty interest For
instance, he reels there may be
physics protessors who would en-
joy helping students make the sta-
tion a reality.

Shender entered the presidential
race because he was upset by the
fact that students have not been
asked to do anything about their
own campus. He says, “The SGA
is your government, the Senate is
your Senate, and the president‘ls
your president.” It is Ill this con-
text that he hopes to create and
lead student concern on the Grin<
nellcampus,

North Yolltlker’s ‘5’ team looms
as the only undefeated squad in
the league tollowing the iourth
week of I.M. basketball action,
North survived what Should be its
slernest test this past week, trip-
ping Langan 39-35 in an erratic,
sloppily-played game. Chuck Wall,
Deacon Jim and the Greek were
North’s high scorers, while Dave
Luthy paced Langan. Carelessness
and over anxiousness caused nu-
merous turnovers which held the
score down and cost Langan sev-
eral early chances to establish a
lead.

Undermanned Cuwles dropped
its first contest at the season in
the ‘A' branch, bowing 6447 to
Smith, who new rules the overall
standings with a 10-4 mark.

College Journalists
Urged to Criticize

The Washington Post recently re-
ported that at a convention of stu-
dent newspaper editors, Harold
Howe ll. Commissioner of Educa-
tion under the Office of Equal 0p«
portunity, urged the editors to an-
noy oiticialdom and to criticize the
administration of their university.

The Post quotes Howe as saying
that "the old-timers, or the estab-
lishment in education, are worried

about. . .the student press." He
said he thinks one function at the
college press is to annoy the in-
stitutlon’s administration.
