experiences. An interesting
point brought up by Miss Wright
was that of the relationship be-
tween the Communist guerrillas
and IVS Volunteers in Viet
Nam. There is an unwritten
agreement that the Red ver
hicles that IVSrers travel in are
left alone' by the Viet Cong.
in comparing the two agencies
the idea was advanced that the
larger, more publicized, gov'
ernment sponsored Peace Corps
may be becoming a sacred cow,

Whereas the IVS with its small- ~

er, private organization might
decrease its effectlveness if it
expanded too much. At any
rate both programs, each per-
forming a service—to the mar
derdeveloped countries and the
U. s.—are striving toward the
same end, with the Peace
Corps figuratively taking the
high road and [VS the low.

The committee has asked that
only students who have books
to sell some on the first day.

Students who bring hooks to
sell will be given a numbered
receipt showing the name of
the book, the student, and the
amount that will be paid for the
book.

When the book is sold the stu-
dent will be sent a notice to
come and pick up his money.
It the book is not sold by the
time that the coop closes for
the semester, the student will
be sent a notice to pick up his
book.

The coop will start operating
on a small loan, of about $20.00
from the Student Government
Association, but the loan will
be repaid with no interest when
the coop closes for the semes-
ter. The rest of the margin,
which the coop hopes to make,
will be deposited in an inde-
pendent fund for use when it
sets up its operation for the
first semester of the 1965-66
school year.

said that the administration of
the college is cooperative with
the project and has provided
the room for it to set up its
operation.

Amendments to SGA Constitution Explained

Ed. note: The following is an
explanation of What SGA hopes
will be accomplished by initiat-
ing several constitutional amend
ments. The article was written
by Dan Bucks, a member of the
committee which drew up the
amendments.

Student government has often
been a irustrating experience for
those who have served on one of
the many student boards or com-
mittees. Hopefully, though, a ma-
jor source of that frustration -—
the cumbersome checksand-bal-
ance system on which the present
SGA is based — would be allevi-
ated by proposed amendments to
the SGA constitution, which were
recently given a nearly unanimous
vote of approval by the Student
Senate

Ideas ror changing the present
government were iirst discussed
earlier this term at the encamp-
ment. This discussion of reorgani-
zation was continued by a com-
mittee formed by the Executive
Cabinet. All of the meetings of this

 

group were open to students. and

several took advantage of the op-
portunity to voice their views on
student government. The new pro
posals were a product of the spe-
cial committee.
The major theme of the proposed
amendments is centralization and
simplification. Under the plan,
executive and legislative functions
would no longer be separated.
That much maligned body, the
Student Senate, would be replaced
by a smaller group, the Advisory
Council, comprised of one repre-
sentative per hall, the AWS Board
President, the CotHP President,
and the SGA President, who would
serve as chairman of the organi-
zation. At present, there are 41
Senators. The new body would
have 21 members. In practice, the
smaller size would allow the group
to function in a committee-like at-
mosphere, in contrast to the pres-
ent Senate meetings often ham»
pered hy its size, which necessi-
tates formal parliamentary meth-
ods. Opinion articulation and de-
cision»making will be aided by the
less formal meetings.

Actually, the Advisory Council

would be comparable to an an.
larged version of the present
Executive Cabinet. Currently, the
Student Senate usually has formal
proposals submitted to it which it
can either approve or disapprove.
This action is then subject to veto
by the Executive Cabinet. The Ad
visory Council, it is hoped, would
play a greater part in shaping
new proposals than what the
Senate has been able to play.
Moreover, since the Executive
Cabinet would be included as vut—
ing and speaking members of the
Council, the Cabinet vem would be
eliminated for the constitution.

As chairman of the Advisory
Council, the SGA President would
assume the duties of the Speaker
of the Senate. This change would
eliminate the disruption and (load
lock of student government that
has occurred in previous years be
cause of conflict" between the
Speaker and the SGA President.

Another major innovation would
glve the Coil-[P and AWS Board,
