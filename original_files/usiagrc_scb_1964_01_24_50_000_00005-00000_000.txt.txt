One of the cogent (printable) things that numerous critics
have called the Scarlet and Black, affectionately known to many
critics as the “Scab," its “a historical record of the momentous
and noose-momentous events mat take place within the confines
of Grinnell College." To fulfill this noble function and give our
readers a pleasant, nostalgic trip through the recent past we will
recount some of those events that helped to make that the semes-
ter that was

The semester started with a splash. Approximately 1150 stu-
dents converged on what, in some circles, was affectionately
known as the "ol’ Swimmin’ hole" to find that the ancient “N0
Swimming" sign had been removed and the forbidding "3.2
Lake” legally opened to qualiﬁed swimmers. The rejoicing and
revelry caused by the removal of that moschovered sign will

_doubtless echo in the respective loggias for years.

It was a semester of rule change and important d isions on
campus life, The students were suspicious of the admi istration,
the administration was suspicious of the faculty, the faculty was
suspicious of everybody and President Bowen left the country.

The Grinnell Nonconformist club forged, or rather putted,
ahead in characteristic progressive style by declaring, through
gritty teeth and moss covered lips, the new Non-club motto, “Two
wheels good, four wheels bad.” The emblem adopted by the group
was entitled, “Ainu Astride 3. Chrome Cyle.”

The Scarlet and Black changed printers, got a much needed
facevlift, came out in glorious red, white and black, held forth the
promise that it would be the finest newspaper ever produced on
the Grinnell College campus; and failed to appear the following
week.

A conservative group of enlightened Grinnell dowsers and
alchemists predicted a deluge of gold water in 1964 followed by
four years of joyous prosperity.

Campus skeptics scoffed at both predictions saying that, if the
first came to pass, the second would necessarily fail. “Anybody
knows that gold water would never make anything grow.”

It was a semester of close communion with nature. Half the
student body spent a weekend talking about “those students” in
a sylvan setting, the men of Clark and Cowles sold down the
river, President Truman bit the dust, and Dean Wood decided to
head for the hills.

President Harry Truman visited the campus as the year’s
official "Politician-in-Residence." Before his visit was over he

, had flopped (in a bush) and the P,P.P.E. was almost committed

to carry Harry,

Construction on the Forum moved ahead at a pace that made
the students currently attending Grinnell wonder “‘for whom?”

The male students and representatives from the faculty and
administration attended a traditional holiday dinner. However,
the three groups couldn’t agree on What tradition was traditional
and when nhe ensuing controversy came to a head it was de-

cided that the whole thing was too booring to argue about and
toasted its abolition,

”Barbie,” Grinnell’s thick-skinned, $75,000 white elephant,
was placed in her cage early in December, But, as if she was no
better than any common, ordinary, “cheap” slab of concrete, she
refused to perform until the temperature got below the freezing
point. ~

The semester officially ended with those Grinnellians, com-
monly called “off men," that couldn’t find their way home look-
ing forward to a rosy field of new lecturers to add to the three
per student total that had already visited the Grinnell campus
during the semester that was. .
