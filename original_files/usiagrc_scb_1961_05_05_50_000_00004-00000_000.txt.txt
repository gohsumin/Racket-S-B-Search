1T0 the Editor:

I recently heard via the Chis

liege board scores for next year

This to me is a very disturb-
ling policy, and if it goes into

A ‘zi potential aggressor is obsosl

nut relatively unscathed'l
little investigation of surprise
attack mechanics proves the
contrary.

Both Russian and Us. air
force generals know that the
most successful Soviet surprise
attack would consist of her
launching her entire airborne
arsenal of 35 odd ICBM'S, 300
bombers and firing her400 800.
mile missiles so that they all
would be detected at once. ln
this way one us. base could

not detect part of thc incoming “"e

attacking force and warn
another base and thus increase
its warning time.

We might, therefore. picture
a perfectly timed attack report—
ed on the civil defense bands
as “All overseas bases prepare
to be hydrogen bombed in 7
minutes; all U. 5. cities in 15
minutes."

Even this grim news would
produce panic in the cities; the
lﬁsminute warning would allow
the Strategic Air Command to
get 1/3 of its home—based bombs
ei-s (about 300). its 15 lCBM’s
and a few of its medium range
rockets and bombers in Europe
off the ground. Missiles are un-
stoppable and. raccording to
Newsweek, about so percent of
our bombers would reach their
targets.

lncvitubly then, a Russian sure
pries attack would result in our
delivering at least 250 hydrogen
bombs to Russian cities and in-
dustrial centers. Since Hiroshi—
mat-sized bombs .are being used
merely to detonate present
bombs. it is certain no city—
in Russia or anywhereiwould
survive a single thermonuclear
bomb. Also it might be mention-
ed that the Japanese killed in
the Pacific a few years ago
were over 300 miles down~wind
of our ‘test explosion.

’The picture thus painted is
hardly a pretty one. Even a
politician as hyper-security eon»
scious as Wayne Morse estimat»
ed that Russlan casualties would
probably be about 100 million—
and that would be for the first
so minutes of the war. it is
evident that World War lll, if
it comes, will be like no other
war mankind has ever fought.
‘Convmtlonal' or feasible war is
a thing of the past.

is it even possible then to
believe that Russia would em-
bark on n surprise attack,
knowing that every inhabits
ant of its major cities and
iuost of its industry would be
wiped .out 30 minutes aftc'r the
war gets under way? Hardly.

What mania is it then that
drives us to producing more and
more weapons every year? What
sadistic or masochistic (both are
applicable) forces impell us to
increase our ICBM’S from the
present number of 15 to 300,
clnublc the number of super car-
riers :lnd increase our
launching subs by 15 times in
the next three years? Both the
East and the West seem to en-

demon of surprise attack so that

it is imperative, therefore, that
take the initiative in eas-
ing international tensions by the
discarding of our missile, and
‘submal‘ine building programs. By
this i do not mean complete
unilateral disarmament; that
would be naive at best and dan~
gerous at worst. We must, how-
ever, begin a partial cut—back
of our colossal expenditures for
weapons by at least $10 to $15
billion per year so that we can
examine (1) the salutary effects
on Soviet attitudes and (2) has
gin to cope with the economic
problems which will inevitably
confront us.

Since, as l have tried to illus-
trate, our present deterrent
forces are more than adequate
we might hope for a total aboli—
tion of our arms budget in three
or four years.

For those who may protest
that a son billion arms out is
too great for our country to
adapt to in four years, it
should be pointed out that we
successfully adjust to a govs
ernincntal arms out of a
ticn dollars at. one strike after
World War 1‘ without reces:
sion or depression.

After we have ceased to allow
expenditures for weapons, we
could turn our attention to the
dismantling of our existing
lweapons with all the attendant
problems of controls and inspec-
tion,

i i think the suggestion made‘

here is a compromise between
the existing extremes and con»
tinuing or accelerating the arms
race on the one hand and total
unilateral disarmament on the
other. It is obvious we have

arrived at the point where some- 1

thing new must be ventured. We

can no longer afford the dubious‘

lluxury of hurling epithets across
U.N. tablcs or talking back to
the Russians. The course we are
presently pursuing is suicidal ~
land perhaps genocidal.

shadow his high school record

are present to use this score
