Mrs. Fernandez, Refugee from Cuba's Communist Regime
Arrives at Grinnell to Work as Cook for Food Service

By Susan Taylor

A charming young mother
has found her way from Cas<
tro’s Cuba to Grinnell’s Saga
Food Service since September,
1962. She is Mrsl Marie Fernan-

dez, who, with her husband and-

child, left a good home and a
law practice in Cuba to escape
the Communist government of
the island.

Mrs. Fernandez is a cook for
Saga at the Quadrangle kitch-
en. She said that they are very
happy to be in the United States
and in Grinnell, even though it
means that she must work now.
She expressed her gratitude for
the opportunity to be in the
United States and to raise her
children here

Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez
spent their first year in the
United States in‘ Miami where
their second child was born six
months ago “We miss very
much Cuba," Mrs. Fernandez
said, using the word order of
her native Spanish, "but we
have our children here, and we
are grateful to the government
and the people of the United
States to be here,”

Mrs. Fernandez explained
that the family had made plans
to settle in Indiana, but they
decided to come to Grinnell be-
cause of the urging of Mr. Fer-
nandez’s life-long friend, Vin-
cent Range], who teaches Span-
ish at Grinnell High School.

Fernandez and Rangel grew
up together and both became
attorneys in Camaguey, Cuba.
The Rangeis were brought to
Grinnell through the efforts of
the school system and the Jay-

pledge by which they would

accept the responsibility for en-

forcing all laws equally. Inter-

national problems could be

solved by having all the coun-
tries of the world Sign a pledge

obligating them to uphold the
~ UN charter.

Certainly it is about time that

a reasoned and intelligent sug-
“»gestion to the solving of our
enforcement problems such as
the pledging program be pro-
pogiI It has been obyious for

 

settes (wives of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce mem-
bers). The Rangels were so
pleased with the community
that they urged the Fernandez
family to come here.

Mrs. Fernandez vividly re-
calls the day the family came
to Grinnell. It was the day of
President Kennedy’s assassina-
tion, November 22, 1963, The
young refugee reports having
learned of the national tragedy
in Chicago, en route to Iowa.

Mrs. Fernandez explained
the one and one-half year pmr
cess she and her husband went
through in preparation for im-
migration to the United States.
They left shortly before the
October crisis in 1962, when
there were still two flights a
day from Havana to Miami.
They were allowed to bring
only one set of clothing along
with the clothes they were
wearing All of their property
had to be turned over to Cas-
tro’s government before they
left the country, ‘

Upon their arrival in the
United States, the family’s first
concern was to find milk for
their year-old son. The Cuban
officials had confiscated a
quart of milk which she had
taken to the airport for her
child.

Mrs. Fernandez left her par-
ents and her sister and family
behind in Cuba. They had origi-
nally planned to come to the
United States, but the means
of transportation was cut off
before they were able to leave.

Cuba was once a country of
middle class people, according
to Mrs. Fernandez, and the

quite some time that a group
of college students with above
average intelligence such as we
have at Grinnell cannot be ex-
pected to take seriously the
rules printed in the student
handbook of rules. It is an in-
sult to the intelligence, and
more importantly, the individ-
uality of the Grinnell student to
expect him to abide by and
enforce these rules.

if more approaches like the
institution of pledges can be of-
fered as solutions to the prob-
lems of society, the day will
come when We will no longer
have to worry about society.

 

people" do not adapt easily to
Communism. The young chil-‘
dren, who started in the com-
munist schools five years ago,
are taught to believe in Com-
munism and to support Castro.
But the older people do not
support him.

"But the Cuban people can’t
do anything,” she continued.
“They are very poor, and have
no weapons or supplies. The
Children must go to Commun-
ist schools.” She explained that
her niece cannot get food or
clothing unless she attends the
Communist school,

“It is useless for us to send‘
food or other things to our rela-
tives still in Cuba because the
government takes it, or at least
half of it. Why should we make
the sacrifice for the Castro gov-
ernmen " she questioned.

further remuneration.

_Chaperons also have the op-
portunity to visit in homes and
communities t h r oughout an
area of the country and to see
their own country through the
eyes of students from varied
backgrounds.

However, this is more than a
chance for free travel. AFS
chaperons assume responsibil»
ity for the smooth functioning
of the entire trip and for num-
erous details along the way.

Students desiring further in-
formation or application forms
should Contact Judy Johnson,
