Iiagers Seek Victory

The Grinnell Pioneers will be
traveling to Beloit Friday and
then be moving on to Coe on
Saturday. They will be attempt-
ing to make up for the two set-
backs they suiiered against Ri<
pan and Lawrence last weekend.
These two losses dropped Grin-
nell’s conference record to Hz.
and left the Scarlet and the
Black two full games behind
ninth place Ripon.

Coach Edd Bowers’ big task is
to revitalize an offense that
could manage only 55 points at
Ripon and 53 points at Law»
rence. Deiensively, the Pioneers
have done much better. They
limited kipon to 68 and Law—
rence to 63.

Bowers is considering some
lineup changes for this week-
end's games and doubts that
the starting unit will he identi-
cal both nights.

"We will be racing two com-
pletely dirierem ball clubs,"
Bowers noted. “Beloit is big and
relatively slow while Coe is
small and last. We may go with
sine at neloit and speed and
quickness at Coe."

Coe shares third place in the
standings with an e5 record.
Beloit is seventh at 57.

Fast Proposed

The student Senate is looking
for ideas for this semester's
SAGA fast. Those who have
ideas should present them at
me Senate meeting this coming
Wednesday. One suggestion has
been to pay lawyer’s tees and
court costs tor the people in the
Playboy demonstration. Costs
have been estimated at about
31200, exclusive of any bail or
lines.
