South Africa 7 Historical Dis
lcnnna," the f11st in a series of
foul lectures on Afiican affairs
was presented by R. B Ballin

ling Hay. -Whitney pr .
-on Wednesday 111 Her-
rick chapel.

Balhnger, who served as lcc-
turer in history at the Univeiu
sity of the Witwater ‘and 111
Johannesburg, South Attica, has
also been an executive member
of the South African Institute
"of Race Relations, serving as
chairman of the publications
board for the institute.

Sketching briefly the history
'of South Africa, he discussed
'the beginnings of the presents
'day Capetown Provmce, as
'established by settlers of the
Dutch East India Company 111
'1652. From the early problems
of cultural and religious gulfs
to isolation and domination by
whites, Ballinger traced the de-
velopment of the four South
African provinces —— Cape Col-
ony, Natal, Orange Free State
'and Transvaal.

. Historically significant in the
evolution of current South

African attitudes was the

meeting of native tribesmen,

Bantus, with the Dutch far.mcr

The mobility of the natives,

moving further and further

away from the settled farmer
- by Capetown, helped create
two separate societies early in

South African history.

According to Balhngcr, the
,Trek Boer was a “law unto him-
self' with an intense belief in
limitless land. the use of Afri-
gaanse as native language. and
the desire to avoid governmental
intertcl'ence. His society was
never touched by the enlighten-
rncnt, liberalism, or industrial
revolution evident in 18th and
19th century Europe.

The Cape Province people,
developing from the original
mixture of Hotentot, Malay and
white blood, provided the urban
population which was greatly
affected by the British occupa-
tion beginning in 1806.

Further sketching the de-
velopment of British influence
in South Africa, Ballinger relat»
ed incidents of the Great Trek
of 1836-38, when great numbers
of the Boer populace rounded
the eastern frontiers and set up
the free states — Transvaal and
Orange Free State. In-this light
be illustrated the growth of in-
tense African independent zeal
and the ideal of republicanism

Concluding the historical sum-
mary, he discussed the people's

opositlfm to participation in the A

World Wars as a denial of sov-
ereignty and the convention of
South Africa which set up each
state as a province with its own
franchise.

Since the union of South
African states in 1948, Bailin.
gcr cited three spectacular
developments affecting the ter-
ritory — 1) the industrial rev-
olution, 2) the urban revolu-
tion \vhirh was accentuated by
the “poor white" problem,

Africa to a full View of her his-

threefold historical dilemma e

spoke 111 He; irlc chapel Wed-
nesday on “South Airica: Apart-
held," the second 111 a series of
{our lectures on South Africa.

He concerned himself in [he
lecture with the origin of the
term “apartheid" us applying to
the separation OI race: and its
implications in Africa today. He
sald that the term, originated by
the NailO-‘I'llISL party. may have
different meanings.

A11 understanthng South
African history SinCC 194B is
necessary for a comprehension
of the connotations of “(wars
lheld.”

Ballinger explained that the
population or South Africa
consists of about 3,100,000
whites, -of which 39 per cent
speak English; 500,000 lnrtians;
about 1,500,000 colored persons
who lack lrihftl tics; and about
ten million Bantu Africans,
some of Whom are in white
urban industrial centers, some
in “native reserves,” and some
in the rest of the country
working on rural European
(arms.

In 1948 (:10 Nationalists, a par-
ty of Afrikaanci’s (South Airl—
cans of Dutch descent), came to
power. They hlld thought that
white supremacy in South Afrir
ca was about to collapse, as
Bantus had been coming into
the white “industrial complex-
CS," bu 11g shanty towns and
working there, The old laws
governing noanul‘opeans were
believed to be outmoded.

The Nationalists thought that
a new policy was needed to
strengthen the racial scpalation.
wnh the s gun, “Sul'c White
South All a,” they \ton the
election and crme to power.

The Nauonaiists put' through
lcgislauon to further their sep-
arate development idcas: laws
to prevent mixed marriages,
laws to provide separate educar
tion, laws stopping court cases
based on the ~rd ”separate”
meaning ”scparule but equal"
They did not have to reverse
former trends, said Ealhngcr.

Ballinger said he believes
the “development of reserves ’
is an absolute essential" on[
humanitarian and economic
grounds, but impractical as a
permanent means at future
development.

At present there are many
problems involved. There is a‘
lack of space on reserves for the
growing Bantu population; the
