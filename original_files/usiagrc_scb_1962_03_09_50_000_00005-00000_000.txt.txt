Frantz: strengthen Ila/ls, alter drinking rule];

by Tom Fraiitz
My plattorm includes:

. Strengthened. workable hall
system.

.lncrcased hall autonomy

. Responslble, etrcctivc (:0th
leadership.

. Strong, representative, North
campus voice in the Execus
tire Cabinet and Student
Senate.

5. Realistsic modilieation oi the

drinking rule.

The aiost urgent necessity on
North campus is to strengthen
and preserve a workable re, —
dance hall system on the
grounds that it is one oi the
most important and beneticial
aspects of Grinnell College tile.

The tenor of the Grlnnell Stu—l

dent body is changing. We are
admitting more intelligent stu.
dents and as a general rule the
desire tor individuality sc ms to

increase in proportion to intel-
ligence. The crying need on
North campus now is to devleop‘
la hall‘ system that will tullill'
the needs and desir s ol’ thci
ichanging student body. it is iin»
lpeiatiie that we do this to pr

'vent a disasterous decline et out“
owii halls into idle dormitories.

Residence balls on North
campus are made up oi vary
ing kinds ot men with vary-
ing ideas and traditions. As
there are many individuals
within each hall. so each hall
is an individual within the
framework or ciriimell student
government,

Because of these dillerenecs
between halls, it is sheer lolly
to impose specitic rules and mg l
ulations which apply to all oi‘
.North campus regardless ot the
desires of the men in
dividual halls,

Therefore, I feel that there

 

should be certain minimum den i
cl‘zil rules to which all Nollhl
campus must adhere Hal 1
ever, within this geneial
ll'itnlcviolk l emphatically bes-
lieve that each hall should be'
able to act and govein itselt as
it desires This will enable each
hall to hc the type of hall it,

Thus, 1 am adioeatiiig more
Ireedoin tor the halls. now—
ever, lrcedom goes hand in

increased autonomy for the
halls, each hall nienilicr, hall
oilieer and CutlIP member is
going to have to be ready to
assume the responsibility that
comes with more autonomy.

The CGIHF will need to be a

added stipulation that drinke
