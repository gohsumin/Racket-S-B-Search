David Sellergren Advocates Consistency With Flexibility,
Wants To Stimulate Sense othesponsibility On Campus

The relationships of the men
of north campus are to be
,viewed with an eye to realism.
Rule changes, individual ac-
tion, structural
o r g anizations,

‘ student a f t i~
tudes are all a
p e rt of the
Grinnell C o l-éﬁj
lege Commun-
lty. Emphasis
should rightly
be placed on
t h e students’
welfare. Real»
ism is a term ’
which is the key SELLERGREN
for leadership, and this realism
must be implemented so as to
benefit the students' Welfare.

Consequently, the role of the
Coil-1P is to stimulate a sense of
responsibility among the men.
The men are their own best rep-
resentatives. Consistehcy both
in attitude and, resultantly. in
rule enforcement can be both
an end and a means. Consisten<
cy cannot, however, mean uni-
formity since such an equation

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignores the flux and dynamics
of the real situation. Consist-
ency is to be the ideal—a real-
izable ideal within a year’s
time if we recognize the guide

’ lines and limitations of the de-

mands of social order, If we
wish to alter the limitations

. presently set down for us, we

must work within those limita-
tions and accept responsibility
for them in order to implement
change. '

On the other hand, the Coil-1P
must be flexible: Intimate, per—
sonal relationships in Grinnell
College are close and in a State
of flux. Only' the hall Council
and the elected hall leader, the
hall president, know the at-
mosphere of their respective
hall; these are best able to
judge situations and make
choices. They must, however,
bear in mind the limitations and
intimacy of north campus life.
Flexibility holds primary im-
portance because of the dual
purpdse of the CofHP—that pur<
pose being problem solving and
representation.

 

The purpose is best achieved

 

through a re-establishment of
rapport among students, stu-
dent leaders, administration
and faculty. Through individual
and joint action with the stu—
dents and other divisions of
student government, the Coil-[P
Should strive to instill mutual
trust with the administration
and our fellows. The dual pur<
poses of CofHP are interde-
pendent, and rapport must be
established to erase any dis-
tinctions.

Grinnell College is unique in
several instances which are, at
this time, best confronted in a
realistic manner, First, the stu-
dents are isolated both physi<
Cally and in their ideals. Sec
ond, the distinct men’s resi-
dence hall system is such that
each hell is autonomous and
mutually responsible to the
Whole. Third, the advent of a
new, unknown Dean of Men
provides an opportunity to re
establish satisfactory relation—
ships. The CofHP Ought to be
organized to meet the unique
ness of the total situation.

Read Cites Need for CotltP Progress in Two Areas;
Student-Faculty Discussions and Enforcement of Rules

I feel that progress within the
CofHP must occur in two
areas: student-faculty discus-
llon and rule enforcement, The
ovents and att‘
t‘udes of this
past year have
disclosed o u r
w e a k n e sses.

The rift be-
tween students
And faculty in,
regard to the
discussion and
establishment of
social and aca-
demic policies
ls n 0 longer “A"
practical. The aftermath of the
Boar‘s Head Dinner revealed
that many faculty members
are interested in our problems
and can offer pertinent sug-
gestions. Mainly they are will-
ing to sit down and talk with
us. Meeting in small informal
groups, students and faculty
can consider a wide range of
subjects, perhaps entirely un-
related to immediate college
problems. Though with no par-

Republicans Name
Convention Heads

Young Republican President
Bob Savage has announced the
names of those students who
are chairmen of the candidate
campaigns for the mock politi-
cal convention to be held in
April.

They are Robin Converse,
Goldwater: P e t e r Kollman,
Rockefeller; Barb B e n d a,
Lodge; Laurie Houdek, Scran-
ton; John TePaske, Nixon; Ken
‘Adelman, Romney; Larry Hutt-
gren, Margaret Chase Smith.

Savage also announced the
appointment of Jim Stoddart as
head of publicity and general
effects for the congention.

ticular action in mind, these
discussions can result in pro-
posals for the improvement of
our academic and social life.

I propose the i 'ation of stu-

’ dent-faculty discussions on a

fairly regular but highly flex-
ible schedule. Each individual
hall would decide the time,
topic, and participating faculty
of these discussions. Evaluation
and synthesis of these discus-
sions would‘occur within the
CofHP.

This year we have witnessed
a decline in the respect for
rules, Too easily many of us,
if we have disagreed with a
rule, have violated it. Those
charged with responsibility
have too frequently looked the
other way, Grinnell is a society
Whose rules reflect the con-
cerns not only of students but
also the College President,
T r u Ste e 5. Administration,
Alumni, Faculty and our par-
ents. If a majority of students
disagree with a regulation or
hesitate to enforce it, then they
must work with these other in»
terests to effect a new policy.
Yet the very essence of law and
student government depends up-
on the enforcement of existin
rulesi '

I believe that the majority
of students now realize the need
for rule enforcement but at the
same time racknowledge the
presence of certain policies
which inhibit proper enforce-
ment. I propose that individual
halls be allowed to impose pen-
alties for many violations now
under the jurisdiction of the
Men's Primary Court. This pro
cedure can facilitate the en-
forcement of certain rules, in
particular open rooms and ilr
legal visitations, and has prov-
en effective in some halls this
year. Until this method is legal~

 

ized, I expect that each hall
would enforce present rules,

 

thus insuring a sound basis for
future liberalizetions.

If it is to be a year of change,
let us have it prefaced with re-
sponsibility and discussion,
Some changes are certain and
I hope an earnest evaluation of
our attitudes toward rules, to-
ward the larger goals of Grin-
nell life, and toward the im-
provement of our community
will be among them. To these
ends I pledge my strongest ef-
fort.

McKlveen for Rules Changes
To Suit the Students' lclecils

Responsibility is not defined
solely as upholding the laws of
a system, although this is cer-
tainly necessary for maintain-

ing the stabil-
ity of a system,
and for achiev»'
ing the goals -
for which the
system is estab-
lished Respon»
sibility ,
may be defined
as recognizing
the necessity

for c h a n g e 5

Within the exist-

ing s ys t e m. McKLVEEN
Neglect of this second aspect
of responsibility is just as ser-
ious as negleCt of the first.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

While at Grinnell it is expect-
ed that we take every advan-
tage of the academic opportuni-
ties; it is also desirable for the
individual to recognize and ac-
cept his social responsibil' ’es,
Ideally the social responsib i»
ties of the student, like that of
the citizen, are to act in a man-
ner which will promote Com-
munity harmony and cause no
discomfort or harm to others.

At Grinnell the ideal system of
rules could be limited to those
which prevent deliberate harm to
others. One rule would he suffi»
cient to insure that ideal, a rule
pertaining to disorderly conduct,
including a quiet hour provision.
The purpose of the legislative body
at Grinnell is to legislate only
those rules which the student body
wants, Again ideally, the system of
rules should accommodate the
beliefs which the student body
holds; moreover, the student body
should not be forced to adhere
to laws in which it doesn‘t believe.
it is to be realized that there will
be a time lag between the evolue
tion of student social practices and
the passage of laws consistent with
these practices.

is to determine ﬂie ideals of the
men of North Campus. He
should attempt to influence the
administration and the Senate
to negotiate a system of laws
consistent with the ideals which
the student body holds. I be-
lieve that we need only two im-
mediate rule changeFan ex-
tension of car privileges, and
opendorms on Friday nights
and Sunday afternoons placed
on a permanent basis. If the
opportunity presents itself, I
will support abolition of the
rule prohibiting coed drinking
in openrdorms.

It is also the duty of the Pres-
ident of the C of HP to Com-
municate directly with the
Trustees of ﬁne College and the
Board of Overseers. If elected,
i would feel it my duty to re-
main on campus after Com-
mencement to provide the Oh
ficers of the College with a full-
er understanding of student
opinion and social practices.>I
would also encourage the House
Presidents to stay for the same
purpose.

Under the existing hall sys-
tern, we find that different halls
have different identities. These
differences of hall personality
make uniform rule enforcement
difficult. This inconsistency is
inevitable within the hall sys-
tem, although it should not be
encouraged. Different social
practices exist in the halls and
different values are held by the
house president and the house
Council. The President of the
C of HP can not force house
presidents to adopt identical
enforcement policies, but he
can encourage them to be sensi-
tive to the social ideals of his
particular hall. Until a consen-
sus exists, this is the most rea~
sonable and accepted policy to
follow in the enforcement of
rules. Once the student body
holds a common idea about a.
law, as the liquor law in the
past, it is not a difficult pro-
cedure to get the law passed by
the Senate and accepted by the
administration.

The court system may be made
more effective by revising the pen-
alties, making them more realistic.
The courts would then become the
practical mechanism of legal con-
sistency, rather than a theoretical
one as they now seem to be. An
example 3f an unrealistic penalty
is the possi lity of supension for
two late violations of open dorms
By enhancing the effectiveness of
the court system, pressures on the
house council will be diminished.
The courts, were created to judge
violators, and they should judge.

Ultimately, we must secure
laws consistent with the ideals
and practices of the Student
body.
