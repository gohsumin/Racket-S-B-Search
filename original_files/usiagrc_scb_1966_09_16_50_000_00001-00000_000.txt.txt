Leggeil Seeks Campus Plan.
Asks Siudenl Poriicipdiion

By HAROLD FUSON

President Glenn Leggett this
week sketched the broad out-
lines of a planning program
which he hopes will “tell us
where we want to be as a col»
lege ten or twelve years from
now." In an interview with this
reporter. President. Leggett dis-
cussed several proposals which
he will present to the faculty in
the Coming weeks in an effort to
implement this planning.

The general organization of
the program will be based
around a set of three commit-
tees: a central steering commit-
tee and two subordinate com-
mittees, one on educational pol-
icy and one on physical plan-
ning and landscape. The latter
committee Leggett suggested
would be divided into subcom~
mittees dealing with particular
areas such as landscape, resia
dence hall development and
physical education iacilities.

_ Details to Come

The details of the commit-tee
organization are yet to be
settled and the whole program

. insofar as it touches upon aca<
demic policy is still subject to
iaculty approval. Leggett hopes,
however, to have the program
firmly on the road within a law
weeks.

Leggett said he felt that the
committees must be so organ-
ized as to allow “Wide active
participation in discussions” and
at the same time provide a
means for “coming to focus”
and oriering actionable alterna-
lives. The aim according to
Leggett is to avoid “splendid
rhetoric" and instead arrive by

Participation stressed

Leggett expressed concern for
obtaining student participation
in the work or the planning com.
mittees. He has been consulting
with SGA President Steve Kent
and other student leaders as to
the best means of bringing
about this participation. Stu-
dents will likely be asked to sit
on the committees and certainly
to utter advice in particular
areas.

Leggett said there is a possi-
bility that he and iaculty and
man Wall might ask to gnrbea
tore the Senate in a row weeks
to more fully discuss his pro-
porals.

Lauterbacii Discusses 'AWS Proposals

By ANN KIRSCHNER

“Prioriiy Will be given in dis-
cussions this year to is consid-
eration of Women's hours, but
we are equally concerned with
other campus problems," said
Karen Lanterbach, president or
AWS Board, at a recent inter-
view,

C Oming E ncampment

Seeks Philosophy

Forty students and twenty
faculty members will attend the
1966 Encampment Sept. 3!) to
October 2 at Boone. All are be«
ing chosen by the Encampment
Committee from among inter-
ested applicants. in addition,
P re 5 id e nt Leggett, Deans
Stauss, Winters, Thompson and
Low, and Mr. Wall, chairman
oi the Faculty, will attend all or
part of the session. Robert
Noyce, Chairman or the Board
of Tlustees, and several mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees
are expected to attend part of
the session.

The Encampment Committee

has announced that this year's.

encampment will be organized
to steer attention away from
specitic problems to get at the
basic philosophy and purpose oi
the college.

"Back to Campus"

Kathy Jagow, chairman oi the
committee, stressed in an 5&8
interview that one or the major
concerns of this year's encampa
ment will be how to “get it back
into campus.” Miss Jagow
hopes that the ideas and spirit
generated at Boone can be car-
ried home to all students and
faculty.

In line with this aim, Miss
Jegow outlined a number of
steps which the encampment
committee hopes to take after
the encampment. The usual
summary report will again be
distributed to the entire commu<
nity through the campus mail.
in addition, panel discussions
will be held and perhaps a
series of hall meetings will deal
with encampment r e p o r t 5.
There is also the possibility that
the encampment discussion
groups might continue meeting
after encampment to lurther de-
velop the ideas discussed at
Boone.

Six Amos

Discussion at Boone will be
organized in these six general
areas:

1. Grinnell presented to the
outside world —- public rela-
tions, fund-raising. alumni ab
tails. The availability of inter.

. motion about administration and

student activities both on and
oif campus.

2. The student “personality"
— What is the Grinnell student?
The role of admissions in de»
termining the type at students
attending Grinnell.

3. Academic demands and
goals of both students and fac-
ulty at Grinnell. A critical look
at curriculum and classroom,

4. The obligations of the col-
lege in regulation and restric-
tion. The right of different
groups at Grinnell to participate
in basic decision making.

5, The relations or the college
to the outside world — oil cam-
pus programs, political activi-
ties, social protest groups and
so on. Should there be more oi
this? The advantages and prob-
lems or Iowa isolation.

6. The responsibility oi, the
college to society in general.
Do we have a public service ob-
ligation to iuliill? The goals of
higher education and the suc-
cess oi the liberal arts college
in meeting them.

will be spent in getting women’s
opinions on hours, Miss Lauter-
bach leels that the board should
represent istudent concerns in
areas other than rules, particu:
larly those oi academic and so
cial matters. A specriic project
of the Board is to have New Stu-
dent Days group leaders extend
their. activities beyond the first
week oi school to act as liasons

between the ireshmenand their»

faculty advisers. in this way.
students could be made to feel
more comiortable talking to
members oi the iaculty and ad
visors could be potential coun-
seling assistants. The battle-
boards would share the respon-
sibility of being aware or the
problems of all students, not
just freshmen.

the Board, has now gone into

Speaker Dan Bucks, in com-
menting on the speaker's role in
the Senate, said his primary
aim is ”seeing that the Senate
achieves the goals it sets ior it-
sell."

“1 Will be highly intolerant of
petty politics. We have too
many purposes to achieve to get
bogged down with the sort of
inciiiciency that has plagued the
Senate in the past."

In zeierenco to last year’s
controversy over the worth at
the Senate, Bucks said. "i don't
conceive oi the Senate on a
game." He went on to say that
the Senate can realistically
serve to inspire and motivate
the campus.
