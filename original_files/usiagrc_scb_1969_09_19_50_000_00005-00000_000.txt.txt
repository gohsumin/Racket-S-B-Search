Faculty Proposal “twist

The {aculty is presently considering n recommendation by its
Organization Committee that would allow ten ”representative"
students to vote at faculty meetings, which are presently closed
to students. Implementation of the Committee’s plan would be un-
WiSe tor the faculty and inimical to the student position

Allowing ten students to vote would be no more than a gesture
ot_tokenism that would subvert the Students’ role in College de~
cision-making. Ten student votes, even ii cast together, would
rarely decide an issue beiore the faculty

Establishing a student voting privilege would endanger the
concept oi a “iaculty decision." The College’s “wider constituen-
Cy” could easily disregard faculty opinion as being too heavily
shaped by the student voters.

Aside irom the obvious diificulty oi iinding ten tnily repre
sentative students, permitting Selected students to Vote Wollld
possibly discourage iaculty members from seeking the opinions
of other students. ,

The proposal seems to assume a mythical “harmony of in-
terests and direction,” a notion that was popular in college gov-
ernance several years ago. In reality, the interests oi students,
faculty, and administrators are divergent at several points. A
student point of view could be more clearly and equitably articu-
lated if it were tormulated as such and then presented to the ap-
propriate hody, rather than falling to the province of ten small
voices.

The compromise or the student position inherent in the present
proposal is readily apparent. Appeasement is not the issue; par-
ticipation is not synonymous with power. Student dissidence
could too easily be dismissed with the argument, “You had a
vote." it must be realized that a token voting privilege for stue
dents would actually be antithetical to positive political Conse«
quence.

There are other options that the faculty must Consider. A tar
more satisiactory proposal would be as follows:

1.) All students should have the right to attend faculty meet-
lngs.

2.) The student senate should have the permanent privilege to
speak and to present motions at facility meetings, but not to vote.

3.) Other students should he allowed to speak and present
motions at the discretion of the faculty’s preSIding officerl

There may be a time when many college decisions can be
made under the tenets oi participatory democracy with students,
faculty and administrators working together. That time will not
come until all parties can be truly and equitably represented.
Until that time, permitting a iew students to vote at faculty meet-
ings is of no help. The faculty should defeat the Betts' committee
recommendation and take immediate steps to open faculty meet-
ings to all students and to grant them limited speaking privileges.

Former Griiiiiell Prof Charges
Discrimination of Local Hotel

By Henry Schett

Last summer a Farmer pro-
lessor at Grinnell alleged that
he was discriminated against
at a local hotel. On Tuesday,
August 12, Mr. John \Villis, a
former instructor in Anthropol-
ogy at the college, filed a com-
plaint with Mrs. C. Edwin G
mour of the Iowa State Ada
visory Committee to the us.
Commission on Civil Rights. in
the complaint he alleged that
Mrs. Ann l-loyer, Manager of
the Park Hotel. Elﬁ Broad St.
refused to rent him a room on
the previous night because of
his race. Willis is black.

According to Willis' com-
plaint. Mrs. Hoyer had accepted
a telephone reservation, but
had no room available when he
arrived at the hotel. Willis said
that he was told the room had
already been “rented". His
complaint stated in part: ”I
iind it hard to believe that this
room could be rented within the
period that had elapsed be.
tween the time I called and
when I appeared. r d It is
my opinion that the manager
or lady I dealt With was re-
tusing me rental of the hotel
room because of race"

Willis was in Grinnell that
Monday to pack up the last or

his belongings before leaving
ior Kalamazoo, M i c h i g a n.
where he has accepted an as
sistant prolessorship in anthro—
pology at Western Michigan
University. l-le was visiting two
friends, Mr, and Mrs. Tom Mat<
tailscli of Grinnell. Willis had
planned to leave Grinnell that
eveningpbut when it became
apparent that he had more to
do than he had anticipated, he
decided to spend the night in
town

He called the Park Hotel at
approximately 10:50 p.m. and
made a reservation, saying he
would arrive in 15 minutes. He
was late, arriving at the Hotel
at 11:30.

Mrs. Hoyer said later, “He
called me and asked for a room
and he said he would be here
in ﬁfteen minutes. But it was
a lot longer than that, sn l
rented the room before he
came."

Mrs. Hoyer denied that she
was discriminatory “I have
rented to colored people in the
past and surely will in the tu—
ture ii there are rooms avail<
able," she was quoted in the
Grinnell Herald-Register.

Max“theFIyingGrandpa” Conrad Visits Grinnell

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

Still ﬂying high at a craity
67, veteran pilot Max Conrad
touched down briefly in Grinnell
last Monday to tell the story
of his attempt last winter to
circle the globe using a new
route—ilying over the North and
South polesr

Conrad, better known as "the
Flying Grandfather," holds sev-
eral light-craft aviation records,
and he has saloed across the
Atlantic Ocean more than 140
times

Ever since he learned to fly
after leaving college, Conrad
has made his living through his
love of ﬂying. For several years
be operated a ierry service that
delivered planes manufactured
in the us. to Europe, and lie
thus accumulated many of the

transatlantic flights on his re-
Cord,

Conrad made his ﬁrst record-
breaking flight in 1959 when he
ﬂew non-stop from Casablanca

to Los Angeles, a 7,683mile trip
that kept him high (in the air)
ior so hours, as minutes. That
night broke all previous distance
records tor light planes.

Looking young despite his
white crew cut and tanned
weather-beaten skin, the tall,
transplanted - Mlnnesotan spoke
to some 100 persons at the Vet-
erans Memorial Center Monday
during a program sponsored by
the Grinnell Airport Promotion
Committee.

Conrad began his talk describ—
ing the planning that led to his
iirst attempt at the polar ilight.
Although the trip was unsuccess—
tul, (he only made it half way«
from St. Louis to the North Pole
to Africa to the South Pole,
where he ran into engine trou—
ble), the slides he took while
aloft provided exciting illustra-
tions for his traveloguelike nar-
ration about the completed leg of
his journey. His casual delivery
held the attention of the audi»
ence for more than two hours as
he told about his adventures.
surprises, and memories of the
polar flight.

Undaunted by failure, Conrad
has committed himself to try-
ing the polar ilight again. He
is determined to be the ilrst
man to pilot a light cratt around
the world, over the poles.

“After all," he explained,
‘‘who could I live with if I
couldn’t live with myself? That
would be the Case if I didn’t
give it another chance."

This time, the Flying Grand-

father is going to take oil from

his Winona, Minn, birthplace on
November 30, in a “reverse di-
rection," heading south ﬁrst,
rather than north like he did
last time.

Although he has spent much
of his lite soaring around the
World, Conrad somehow found
the time to help raise [en Chile
dren. He acquired his nickname
twelve years ago when his ﬁrst
grandchild was born.

Before he was dubbed “the
Flying Grandfather.” Conrad
was known to many as “the Fly-
ing Songwriter,” because he
habitually composed songs dur-
ing his long, lonely hours aloit.
Several years ago he produced
an album featuring some of his
many songs to help finance his
[light around the world attempt.
(This time, he plans to sell 12
thousand postcards, which he
will mail to die purchasers when
he teaches the South Pole.)

Recognizing that he isn't the
only flying grandiather around
(Federal Aviation Agency sta-
tistics list some 150 thousand in
the us.) Conrad is now ionning
an exclusive club called “Flying
Crandiathers Unlimited,” whose
home base will be at Max Con-
rad Field in Winona, Conrad
says he has already received
numerous checks paying for $100
charter memberships, despite-
the iact that the club isn't even
organized yet.

Before ilying out of Grinnell,
Max Conrad explained that the
“adventure and personal chal—
lenge" his kind at ilying otters
is preferable to the “comic“;-
able, protitable, but boring" life
or a commercial airline pilot.

”Besides,” the Flying Grand-
father pointcd out, “commercval
pilots are done flying at age 60."
