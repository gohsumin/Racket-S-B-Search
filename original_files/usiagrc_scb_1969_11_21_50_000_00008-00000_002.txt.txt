The censorship issue does not remain confined to Newton. After Mrs.

Wilma See of the Service Bureau had agreed to print this _S§c_B special, College

Business Manager (and Administrative Supervi'sor of the Serjlice Bureau)

Ralph K. Pomerenk called to inform me that the Service Bureau would not
print it because "it doesn't have appropriate content."
I immediately called President Leggett who, after consulting Mr. Prescott,
ordered Pomerenk to print what you are reading at the Service Bureau.
The dedicated staff of the Scarlet ﬂ Black will not be intimidated;
we will try to find a printer and publish once again next weekend.
