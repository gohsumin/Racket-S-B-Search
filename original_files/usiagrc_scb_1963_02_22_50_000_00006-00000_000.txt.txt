‘Cagers defeat Cornell; to battle Carls, Oles’

Three Pioneers
in double figures

The Grinncli varsity basket-

left to play,

The Rams took the floor with
an unusually well—balanced and
talented team, but they simply
couldn't cope with the fierce
Pioneer drive and determina-
tion. Three players scored in
double figures for the home
team Jim Mifflin drilled home
18 points, John Sundell pumped‘
in 14 points, and Car Smltlt ndd-‘
ed a ‘very important 13 points.

Although it was an excellent
game for the spectator who eiiaj
joys excitement, the game could
only be described by the gen.
eral play as erratic. At times
both teams appeared to be mak-
ing a conscious effort to throw,
the game away, and Conlelll
finally succeeded late in the
second half when their wllolei
offense collapsed. 1

Ed Truelson fouled out with
one minute and 33 seconds re
maining in the contest, and
Dick Calbow fouled out with‘
about one minute to go and this
practically immobilized the Ram

machine.

Freshmen beaten by Cornell 71-66;
edge Central in three overtimes

The freshman basketball team
ended their season this week
with two games, one against
Cornell and the other against
Central, lt lost to Cornell Sat.
urday afternoon in Darby gym
and beat Central in the same
place Tuesday evening.

The Pioneers had three men
in double figures including
Cord Kinkead with 22 and chf
Frantz with 20 but their defense
they allowed
five Cornell players to score
ten or better. The final score
was Grinnell so, Cornell 71,

The Central game was a dire
ferent story, The Pioneer flee
fensc, which has been hurting
all season, finally began
click and this, combined with
excellent shooting, sent the
Crinncll frosh to an
point lead. The second
played the last five minutes of
the first half and the half time
buzzer sounded with Crinncll
ahead 38-29.

Coach Bowers switched his
team to a maneloemftn defense
in the second half but it did
not seem as effective as Central
closed the gap about halfway
through the second period From
this point on the score stayed
close and thc lead changed
hands several times. The second
half ended in a tie and it look
three overtimes to decide a i-ic—
tor, Crinnell 86-84.

lunder pressure, scoring six of
his ten points during the oven
time periods The last two Pio-
neei- points were two free
throws made by Kinkead.

According to Coach Bowers
the biggest problem of the team
all season has been its weakl
defense. They have allowed the‘
opposition to score too many
easy baskets, Bowers said "The
difference between good teams
and mediocre teams is the dc.
fense and we were mediocre be-
cause of our defense." He thinks
that Frantz and Kinkead will
make valuable contributions to
‘ncxt year's varsity.
