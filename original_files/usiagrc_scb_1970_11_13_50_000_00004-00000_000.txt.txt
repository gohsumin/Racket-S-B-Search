Curriculum Discussion Logs

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

The Faculty convened Monc
day for its long—awaited vote
on academic reform, but
somehow didn't quite get ar-
ound to it. Ithadbeen generalc
ly expected that the faculty
could pass on the Wall-Jones»
Clotfelter proposal after two
weeks of pollingand consider
ation.

The Wall-JonescClotfelter
proposal was introducedat the
previous meeting as a prog—
ram representing a consensus
of divisional interests and of
many of the numerous propo-
sals offered since the faculty's
first meeting of August 28. It
'provided for the substitution
of a freshman tutorial prog-
ram in the initial semester
for course requirements for
graduation. Included also was
a hcultycstudent Freshman
Year Committee to pass on
tutorial curricula.

’l-Iowever, last Monday's
meeting was entirely devoted
to consideration of amendme—
nts to the proposal offered by
Luther Erickson as 3 ”Sci-
ence Division Response to the
Freshman Tutorial Progc
ram."

The Science Division feltthat
it would discourage their par
ticipation in the program ,1“.
less:

1) tutorials were offered both
semesters of the freshman
year; and

Mears Dears Fall,

The Mears Dears have struck
back. Have you seen the Quad
bulletin board lately’.7 Well the
sign is gone but the thought is
still there. Liberation, my fr-
iends, in the form of sexual
interplay for fun and profit.
Get the picture? Orwhatever?

Mears, other than Phil, has
been lmown for its sweetsugar
coating for several years on
this campus. No longer, dear
customers. The first sign on
second floor reads, "Pay here
and proceed down the hall.”
A blow for freedom. Not really
but it is really a nice way to
make money if that‘s your
thing; Perversions a little
higher. I haven't been ableﬁto
check into the profit aspect of
this enterprise as ofthis date,
but money isn't everything.
Besides, l-laines has proved
that there must be something
to it, since they have started
an equal butopposite business,

‘ Where are the days of the

Mears song ayinst “demon
rum"? Gone, alas. Thank God
for small favors.

2) tutorials could be tied to
courses offered by the Divi-
sion. (This is described asa
”4 - 4 operation.") It was
objected that if the tutorial
program were of value as de-
vised, much of itsmeritwould
come from being offered im-
mediately to entering fresh-
man in their first semeSter- ,
preparing them for course'
planning and independent re
search later on. Ric McDow—
ell spoke to this point atsome
length, citing his experimen-
tal Humanities section last
year, and arguing thatexperi-
mental and tutorial programs
are best offered early to fr~
eshmen.

Peter Bowman pointed out
that the second section of the

Erickson proposalwoultl leave
one section of the 4 - 4 under
departmental control, with the
other section responsible to
the Freshman Year Commit-
tee.

There followed a great deal
of rather perplexing debate
as to whether tutors should
also act asprincipaladvisers,
whether the Freshman Year
Committee should be of three
faculty and three students,
three and two, or two and two
(and if so, why?) etc.

The upshot was that the face
ulty voted to have a two-sem-
ester tutorial offering, not
tied to courses already offer-
ed, with tutors as principle

For Biting Commentary

by J. C. Labowitz

Dale Hawn called me the
other day and asked me to
sound out opinionaroundcam-
pus about his pet ultimatium -
to wit, that all pets found in
dorms after the mid-sem br—
eak would be taken down to the
veterinarian's and put to
sleep. This action was evic
dcntly necessitated by the
maid staff, which has been
complaining about the anic
mals' pop bottles, pizza box-
es and other messes that they
have been leaving around.

I decided to get a truly reps
resentative sampling of opin-
ion by asking a few ofthe came
pus pets themselves, since
they seemed most directly in
volved. I started with Caine

Tederman, but ran into a lot .

of problems because he did
not want to stay in one place

Woman’s Lib Slicrh‘ers Labels,
Explains Chauvinism--Sexism

by Andrea Frey

In talking with those involved
in Women's Liberation on car
mpus, l was able to dispense
with many of the misconcep-
tions that had previously en-
couraged me to avoid the mo
vement. Any organization's
activities should include ac-
tion centered on recruitment
of new members, and it is
unfortunate that the comma
tions that have been attached
to Women's Liberation by the
American people and media
have forced us into a misin-
terpretation of the movement
and its goals. For this rea-
son, many women have been
discouraged from allying th-
emselves with the structure
altogether.

Since the onset of what the
media has labeled the New
Morality, the word ”libera-
tion" has attracted manysex
ual connotations. Because of
this, many people assume that
Women's Liberationwill make
women easier objects for men
to overcome sexually. Wom-
en's Liberation has also been
referred to asan "anticmale"
movement. Although they
voice grievances concerning
how they feel they have been
treated by males as a group,
WL by no means advocates
a hatred for the members of
the male sex en masse.

Two words appear consists
ently in WL literature and sp-
eeches. Even though I didn‘t
know the exact definitions of
the words "chauvinist" and
“sexism", I thought that I
was aware of their meanings
simply because I could use
them in grammatically sound
sentences. The women I talked
to defined a chauviniSt as a
male accustomed, either con-

sciously or unconsciously, to
manipulating women by definc
ing his own role as superior
to that of a woman. They cxe
plained sexism as an attitude
which supports an interpreta-
tion of roles as differentiated
by sex. After understanding
the connotations of these
words, I realized that sexual

Freudianism is not what Lib-
eration is about. Muchlike the
word “liberation", the word
"sexism” lends itself tomis-
conceptions.

The deceptive qualities [have
described are causes of the
mediocre turnout at the WL
meetings on this campus. A
few of the fifteen women pree
sent at the meeting [attended
felt that the lack of mass par-
ticipation was due to an inabi~
lity of new members to relate
to the older ones. Women's
Liberation does n0t merely
entail the need for day care
centers and abortion clinics,
although these things are both
in the forefront of the Wells
publicized WL demands. Wo-
men‘s Liberation also means
intimate discussion of female
sexual andpsychologimlgrie-
vances. Many of those new to
WL apparently find some of
the older members unrccep-
tive to their need for an al-
most therapeutic exchange of
ideas. Therefore, they feel
that they can bestsatisfy their
needs elsewhere.

The movement is at present
hoping to fill these gaps. Dor-
mitory discussion groups are
being formed. It is hoped that
within these groups, women
new to the movement will be
able to communicate their dis-
content concerning their de-
signated roles as females. The
Women's Liberation Confer"
ence will take place November

13 , 15. The campus WLgroup
has invited several women
from outside me college com-
munity who are lmowledgable
in topics relevant to Women's
Liberation to Stage a panel
discussion. In addition, there
are two Women's Liberation
group independents on campus
in which members read and
discuss books like Sexual Poe
litics and The Second Sex.

long enough for me to askhim
any questions, and besides
that he was wearinga football
helmet. I did ask his mother
what she thought, and she was
all in favor of anything that
would put Came to sleepahout
10 o'clock every night.

I then encountered Gaylord,
the small black and white dog
of undetermined heritage who
frequents die Grinnell cam'
pus. He was more than happy
to discuss the situation with
me, but he would only meet
me in a place that would be
secluded so that we wouldn't
be overseen by B and G. I
suggested Cowles cafeteria at
lunch, so we met in the lobby,
and walked on in after Gay-
lord gave the checker Eric
Hines' meal wrdnumber, with
nothing being noticed out of
place. I then queried Gaylord
about the pet situation over
hot dogs. I asked first about
the threat to take pets down'
town and put them to sleep.
Gaylord fired back, “1 don't

‘ see that as a genuine threat.

I have spent a lot of time
around ARH, and I can tellyou
for a fact that you don't have
to take me downtown to put
me to sleep. All the guys down
at the hydrantagreewithme,"
he added with finality.

I then inquired about his liv~
ing arrangements around
campus. I recalled that Gay-
lord and Iliad been neighbors
when he was rooming with
Alex Karlin in North Pit.
“This year I have a real nice
room' in a girl's dorm on
North Campus. I did spend
some time over in White House
and German House, but what .
I am really waiting to see is
Dog House”, Gaylord reveal-
ed as we went up to SAGA
Martha for seconds. Gaylord
went with the pigs-in-a- blan‘
ket this time. Gaylord then
apologized fornothavingmore
time, but he was due at a
Pets Emancipation Thrust
(PE 1") meeting, where he was
bringing up a proposal for the
health center staff to include
a full-time veterinarian. He
departed with a clenched paw,
exposed canines, and a wag-
ging tail.

ored downtown, making them
less accessible to the stud-
ents. According to Christian-

The main function ofthe Libc
rary Committee is to assist
the librarian with policy mak-
ing, make recommendations to
the President and Dean on lib-
rary needs and policy, and
plan the book budget with the
librarian.

Committee members are Phr
ilip Kintner(chairman), Henry
Alden, Robert Christiansen,
Donald Irving, Gerald La-
londe, Carolyn Ashbaugh, 13*
nda Camilli and Curtis Scrib-
ner.

Thus far the committee has
approved the total bookbudget
of $33,000 for the present fisr
cal year. This amount shows
a 15% increase overlastyear.
When asked for the reason for
this increase, Mr. Chrisrianc
sen said, “Some people felt
that expenditures for books
were inadequate."

The committee also set the
agenda for the year. Qie ma-
jor concern will be the sapce
shortage in the library caused
by the administration offices.
Because of this shortage,
older periodicals are new St’

sen, the problem increases
yearly because of the growing
administration staff. He comc
mented, "They usurped one of
the seminar rooms this fall."

Other topics discussed will
be the periodical bank and
the problem of items disapc
pearing from the collections.
