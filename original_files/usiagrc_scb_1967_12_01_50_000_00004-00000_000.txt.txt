GRAY MATTER

The hope of every sports-
writer is to be able to cover
the battle between the No. 1
and the No 2 teams in a certain
sport. The ideal situation is to
have a tense battle with one
strength eventually overcoming
another and asserting itself,
{This week brought about this
exact situation with South play
ing North for the volleyball
championship,

The result? A miserable 33
the which proved absolutely
nothing except that they‘re too
good for each other and much
too good for anyone else. South
now has lost 6 while North has
dropped 9.

North had the misfortune to
play Rawson in the first game
of the season when they were

While we're on the subject,
coed volleyball will be played
this Sunday from 7-9 pm, in
Darby Gym, This game has
much more to recommend it
than regular volleyball since
girls can’t spike as well as
boys but they’re much more
fun to Watch jumps It'll be the
last chance before finals to let
off steam.

All in all. We been oven-

As a result, North dropped 5

THE KIIITZER

By JOHN RAZ

When one member of your partnership deals or when an oppo«
nent deals and passes it is possible for your partnership to employ
the Forcing Pass System of Sarcastically Obscure and Misleading
Psychological Bids. Although this system may sound as though it
should belong to the Oneupmanship variety of conventions as sug-
gested by Stephen Potter in Gamesmanship, it has a fair amount
of credibility and it is difficult to construct a logical defense with-
out deliberation and altering the structure of the Standard Amerh
can system.

When you hold
. 0-16 pts

 

You bid

One of it suit (with weaker types of
hands try to open the major, strongEr
for the minor suit openings)

Pass, which is forcing and the equiva
lent of a Shencken Club opening bid.
Partner gives negative response by
bidding 1‘: (less than 9 p18 needed for
game) or positive response: any other
bid, game forcing.

‘ Upon this basic structure can be added the Weak NoTrump
convention (14—16 pts), The Weak Two-Bid (8-12 pts and six card
suit), Preempts, etc.

The success of this system in actual practice depends upon
the quality of the defense since it is an exaggerated system of of-
fensive bidst If the defense hesitates to double at the low levels,
which is more often than not the case on this campus, the system
has a definite advantage in initiative and preventing the opponents
from arriving at their proper contract, Practice should demon-
strate certain sequences and conventions to be superior to others
and it is a matter of experimentauon to determine the best way
of handling the system.

Attention should be paid to the maintaining of limits for defen-
sive values since they will be convenient when you double the frus-
trated oppositions ovcrbidding.

The greatest difficulty of the system is reaching game on hands
which do not afford the use of the forcing pass, This could be alle-
viated by reducing the requirement for the forcing pass to a mere
opening hand but there can probably exist a system of step-relay
bids for this purpose,

Generally, this system is constructed to take advantage of an
opposition which does not base its offensive bidding on a sound
defensive bidding system; l.e., it works best against a weak or
timid defense. Although it works best against an unwary defense,
astounding results can be produced by first informing the oppo-
nents of the use of the system beforehand. And like the excellent
continental system, (e.g., the Roman and Neopnlitan Club), it can't
be used in A. C. B. L. master point tournaments.

HOOPSTERSi
HEIGHT? HOPE!

Tho Grinnoll Pioneers will be
fighting to overcome last year‘s
disasters as they take on Cul-
ver - Stockton on December 2.
The team has only won 12 of
66 games in the past three years
and has been last in the Mid-
west Conferenco since the
graduation of John Sundell in
1964.

Luck of depth seems to be a
predominant factor of Pioneer
teams and this year’s roundbait
squad is no exception Only 11
men came out for the squad,
which is barely enough for an
inter-team scrimmage, It seems
probable that a lot of the op-
position’s points will come in
the last period as the team tires.

Fortunately, the problem of
height is not as great as it was
a year ago. While still giving
away an overall height advant-
age, Coach Pfitsch has Terry
Holloway, a so" sophomore
Last year, Holloway averaged
23.2 points per game with the
trash and once pulled down 40
rebounds in one game.

Other members of last year's
fresh, now with the varsity, are
Don Peterson and Gordon Abel,
Peterson is a guard and Abel
plays both guard and forward.

Members at last year’s varsi-
ty still with the team are Mil-(e
Schwartz, Thor Evenson, and
Roger Able. Schwartz is 8 guard
and Evenson and Able are for-
words.

The team is rounded out by
forwards Greg Rankin, Ralph
Christensen, Carl Muller, and
Sam Carrell,

points; if you read my point
(1) again, you will find it para-
phrases your point (2) and (3).
Only our basic premises differ.

The main thing I want to say
is that i am concerned about
the subculture and have heard
this concern expressed by oth-
ars, and I wrote my letter to
try to express some aspects
of the situation to others who
felt the some way. You are
not concerned with the situau'onll
you applaud it as healthy. Nuv
turally, you, the people in tho
subculture, Would not feel the
same way. My article was writ
ten to suggest why you don't.
The fact that you are so on the
defensive as to feel you must
reply and justify yourselves is
indicative of less moral sure-
ness than your letter indicatesl

i wrote my letter primarily
to the white students who, like
me, believe in integration. We
are upset because it seems like
we can‘t even make integration
work at Grinnell, here where
we are so apart from the real
world.

Let me and by saying that
integration does not mean as—
Slmilatinn. And when you have
resolved the paradox of your
[WEI statements: “The ‘self isola-
tion’ that you speak of is im-
perative to the Negroes’ search
for an ethnic ‘soul’ " and
”Ethnic pride does not mean
social separation" perhaps we
will agree.

Meanwhile, my letter's chal-
lenge to the white students still
stands: we have failed to pm
vide positive and concrete re-
atﬁrmatioiis of our desire for a
genuinely non-prejudiced and
nonaracially oriented society.
We can decide apathy is easier
and let our ideals go down the
drain, or we can each decide
to do something and perhaps
succeed at Grinnell where most
of our country failss

CANADA SETS
POINT SYSTEM

WASHINGTON, (CPS) — The
factors used by Canadian offl~
clots in judging young Ameri-
cans migrating to Canada have
now been revised and codified
in a point system.

This system replaces old reg-
ulations under which some
would-be migrants could be
turned down by an immigration
officer because of a single de-
ficiency. Any immigrant scor<
ing 50 out of a possible
100 “assessment units" will
now be admitted to Canada

The scoring under the new
system is as followsl

—Education and training, 20
units. One unit for each year
of schooling or training,

—Personal assessment, 15
units. Adaptability, motivation,
initiative and other such quali-
ties as judged by an immigra-
tion officer during an interview,

—0ccupational d e m a n d, 15
units, Based on demand for Vu-
rlous skills in Canada, unim
are assessed according to the
demand for the occupation the
applicant will follow in Can-
ada.

—Age, 10 units. 10 units if the
applicant is between 18 and 35
—l.e., of draft ago — but one
units deducted for each year
over 35,

—Arranged employment, 10
units: 10 units if the applicant
has arranged employment in
Canada or has received offers
on a previous Visit.

—Knowledgs of French and
English, 10 units: Five points
for each language spoken flu-
ently. with extra points for
some knowledge of eitherl

—Relative, 5 units: granth
when the applicant has a rela-
tive in Canada willing to spon<
sor him,

—Employment opportunities
in the area of destination, it
units: a maximum of five units
if the applicant intends to go
to an area in Canada where'
them is a strong demand for
labor.

Under the new regulation:
there is also a new applica-
tion form. The main change
from the Old one is the dele-
tion of the question “Wily do
you wish to migrate?"

self that it is doubtful even
Shakespeare or Albee, every-
thing eise being perfect. could
have survived
