“The American City in a Rev»
olutionary World” was discussed
by the Rev. Donald L Benedict
last Friday morning in Herrick
chapel. it was the' third in
series of critiques oi American
culture sponsored by the Board
of Religion.

Rev. Benedict is the director
oi the Chicago city Missionary
Society and has spent all of his
ministry in the “innencitics” oi
New York, Cleveland and c1
cage, He described a home mi
sionary as “a foreign missionary
without a halo or furlough" and
said that from the inner city
one can see what is happening
in the entire world.

Benedict listed three main
revolutionary iorecs which are
loose in the world today and
which can he secn irorn the
inner city. The ﬁrst at these
farce: is technology; it has he-
come the “god oi culture." He
went on to say that in some
parts oi Chicago 25% of the
male workers are unemployed.
and that as a result the chil—
dren lose their sense at aspira—
tion and [eel that “there is no

Urbanization, the

Benedict as the second

revolue

tionary force. and this urhaniza- logical aspects oi both the innert

tion has led to three kinds of
alienation.

THE FIRST is the alienation
of man from man which is lound
in segregation. An example of
this type can be felt riding in
a subway at rtish hour, whenl
onc develops a “subway stare“:i
that is, being able to ride on a
subway With the eyes open while"
seeing nothing. ‘

The second type of alienation.
is that or man from commun y,‘
whereby man becomes transient‘

said. there is only one half on

Harpsichordisi
will begin 1962
concert series

By Mary Gwynneavaughan
s at 3 Stan Writer

Ralph Kirkpatrick, regarded
by some as “the world's greatest
harpsichordist," will open this
year’s concert series with per-
formances Friday and Saturday
next week at a p.m. in Roberts
theater. .

Kirkpatrick's early - reputation
as an “authority,” established
by his relatively tcw writings
and editions, has been followed
by his general recognition as a
pertormer oi the ﬁrst rank

He has- long been known to
music lovers ol this country. but
recently has expanded his ea—
reer to the extent that his para
torinanees abroad now outnum—
ber those in the United States.

in addition to pertorining‘at
the Vienna, Berlin, Edinburgh.
Lucerne and Allsbach iestivals,
Kirkpatrick has been welcomed
by numerous countries as an
interpreter of their own music.
He has been engaged to play
Scarlatti in Italy. Mozart and
Haydn in Vienna, English music
in London and French music at
Versailles.

Besides making harpsichord
recordings, Kirkpatrick has re-
corded his clavichord playing
and has pertormed on the eight
acnllrcentury piano and the
modern piano. ,

Reservations tor the Kirkpat-
rick harpsichord concert must
be made in advance at the stu-
dent uoion irom lo a.m to l2
noon or lrom 2:30 to 4:30 pm.
next Tuesday through Thursday.
Activity tickets will be required.

THE LAST KIND et' alimla»‘
tion explained by Benedict is‘
that oi man ironi God. In our
culture, he said. there is a feel:
men feel that there is nothing
they can do about lite. There iSr

a popular lallacy that knowl-

SCARLET AND BLACK

edge of a problem solves it. Hal

concluded hy saying that a loss‘
at transcendence results in a loss
at Justice. a loss which' should
not occur in a culture where it
is believed that all men are sons

of God and equal under ‘Him. ‘

Sen-determination was cited
by Benedict as the third revolue
tionary iorce in our world to-
day. This iorce was on the verge‘
of completion at the time of the
American Revolution and
ﬁnally he realized with the
equality ct Negroes to whites.

Benedict stated that the
main questions iaeing whites

today ar ~ “Do Caucasians

have the spiritual depth to ab-
sorh 200 years of terror?" and

“Can we absorb the hostility

oi the American Negro who is

now going to assume his right-
iul place in society?”

Benedict concluded his lecture

realistically {ace the problems

by-lzroduct of the metropolis, and that tllel
by role oi the church must vary inl

order lo deal with the techno—

eity and the outer city.
