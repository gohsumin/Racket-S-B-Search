Protests Questioned

To the Edilnrl

“There is no correlation between in
telligence and judgment. A man can be
awfully smart, and be a screwball oi the
first order." That astonishing statement
is round in a book by Vance Packard,
“The Pyramid Climbers." It really isn’t
so astonishing to tile older generation,
those who have often noted the antics of
“educated tools,” as a homespun phllu-
sopher inelegantly pllts it.

The purpose or this letter is hard to
explain. We oldsters yearn over the ideal.
lstic. impractical young; but ieel helpless
to keep them irom damaging themselves
and our beloved alma mater, in their ill»
considered eiiorts to right someundoubt-
ad wrong. Perhaps it they could be made
to ieel less cocksure oeiore taking heed-
less action, some good could result.

“Meaning well" is no excuse for harm«
ful action. Otherwise what good is Intel-
ligence, of which the fortunate Grinnell
student has an abundance?

Comps Need Action

To the Editor:

Whatever happened to the comps pro~
pnsal? Now that comps are over, one
may very well ask thar question. But
just because comps are over, does that
mean that the issue ls dead. There are
many pertinent questions yet to be
asked. What is the purpose oi a compre-
hensive? Are they relevant to a liberal
arts education? Do they add to a stu-
dent's knowledge or help him evaluate
his work?

The original proposal for a change in
the structure of senior comprehensives
Is now on the agenda or the executive
cuuncil of the faculty. But the executive
council is very busy and the iervor over
Comps has died down. There are two
weeks of classes leit and the executive
council has never been known to make
a hasty decision. Are we willing to let
the issue die on the table?

There are many avenues oi approach
ior bringing the issue back to liie. Bonnie
Tinker has chosen one way or demon-
strating the irrelevancy oi comprehen-
rives. But she is one person and issues
are not settled by the actions of one per-
son, The major part oi the work remains
to be accomplished.

The present comp proposal was drafted
in the aitennath oi the first comprehen»
sive period. Action now needs to be tak-
en next fall to afford time (or careful
evaluation and clear thinking. The initia-
tive must come {mm the students. Are
students willing to take the initiative?

Haas Helps Resist

College Chaplain Dennis W. Haas
subjected himsell to possible pros-
ecution Thursday night by aiding
in the drait card turn»in of sopho-
more .7. Theodore (Ted) Glick, who
could now be reclassified for in-
duction, jailed or iined.

Some 200 persons attended a
dralt resistance rally in Herrick
Chapel at which Gllck gave his
dl‘ai’t card to Haas, who will mall
it to Gliok’s drair board. Gllck’s
drait card was passed through a
crowd or about 100 persons belure
it reached Haas.

“I must raise my voice against
immorality and, more than that,
I must put my physical liberty
against (America’s) Sick pnllCles
as an indication or how misguided
I believe our society has become,”
Glicn declared, reading irom a let-
ter to his dralt board.

Explaining his cooperation with
Glick, Haas announced to the au-
dlence; “I’m nilly aware that this
is illegal. For me it is a question
or immorality or Illegality. i choose
illegality.”

More than 150 Grinnell students
signed statements or complicity
with draft resistel‘s last week,
Glick told the 5&3. He also said
that two other students turned their
cards over to Haas Thursday, and
that a third student burned his
dralt card arter the rally.

 

IRREGULAR ACTS
BY SENATE

By TOM THOMAS

Questions of Irregular procedure and
conflict of interest have been raised over
action taken by the Senate Monday night
Following last week's complaints about
the interviewing process for finance com-
mittee chairman, the Senate met to in-
terview all applicants for the position.
The applicants were Andrew Brill, Mich-
ael saeger, and David Cavender.

During the interviews the meeting
was closed to students and the press.
This reporter objected to the closed
meeting, citing the SGA Constitution that
all Senate meetings are to be open to all
students. Chairman Jim Lew responded
that the Senate was meeting as a commit-
tee of the whole plus the student coordi-
nator. Lew, however, agreed that the ac-
tual vote of approval [or the new chair-
man must come at a regular meeting at
the Senate which would be open. Lew also
stated that this vote would take place
at the regular Senate meeting on Wed-
nesday.

According to Senate members, the Sen-
ate then met in closed session until about
11:45. At that time the meeting was pro
claimed open and all those present (i .,
the library maid) were allowed in. The
Senate then voted 7»6 to approve the
nomination oi Andy Brill made by the
SGA President. Although there are nor-
mally only twelve Senate votes unless tho
chairman is voting. it was conﬁrmed that
