FRANTZ GRASS A REBOUND off ills Grinnell boards.

 

Franiz Approaches Scoring Mark;
Pioneers Journey Up lo Wisconsin

Grinnell’: up and down
cagers will be trying for their
first road victory in nearly two
months when they travel to
Wisconsin this weekend to face
Midwest Conference foes Ripon
and Lawrence

The Ripon game is slated for
7:30 pm. today and the Lawr-
ence tilt {or 1210 p.111. tomor-
mw.

Jeff Frantz continued his red
hot shooting, firing in 41 and 33
points in last weekend's pair
with Coe and Heloit. The 74-
point blast moved him to the
top of the loop scoring race
with 267 markers and a 24.2 av-
erage.

Overall, the 6-2 junior who
can play guard, forward, or
center, has rammed in 368
points for a 24.3 average and
has topped 30 points six times.
Now only 78 points shy of the
Pioneer season record of 445
notched by John Musser in
mass, Frantz appears a vir-
tual cinch to crack it, probably
during the Monmouth rKnox
series here on March 5-6.

Frantz is also the top Pioneer
rebolinder with 129. He claimed
a personal high of 18 against
Coe and added nine against Be-
lnit to pace Gr‘innell both days.

“I thought. we played some of
our best ball of the season dur-
ing the first half of the Coe

 

game, especially on offense,"
Pfitsch stated. “And I was
proud of the way our boys
stood off Coe's second half
challenge and then won the
game in overtime. They looked
very tired against Beloit Sat-
urday. I assume the Coe game
took a lot out of them.”

Pfitsch will go with the same
lineup he used last weekend,
Joining Frantz, Tom Hill, and
Elliott Hibbs on the starting
five will he Ted Risser and Bob
Watt.

Starting tor the first time,
Watt collected 17 points against
the Kohawks and ﬁnes and
turned in good floor perform-
ances.

Clyde Smith will again see
heavy duty in the front line.

Ripon, which moved Into the
loop lead with a 58-62 win over
Lawrence on Saturday, is led
by the scoring of Jim Cahoon
(21.3 average) and Roger Beck
(16.4 average) and the rebound
ing of Willie Alexander Rogers.
Now 9.5, the Redmen topped
Grinnell 71-68 here early in the
season.

Lawrence, now eighth with a
6-8 mark, dropped a 95-72 cone
test at Grinnell. Tom Steinmetz
and Earl Hoover are the big
Viking guns. Both are averag-
ing more than 17 points per
game.

Facing each other across the
greerlrnetted tables this weekend

i will be entrants in the Women’s

Recreation Association's table ten»
nis tournament. Pinging will be-
gin at 1 pm tomorrow in the
Women’s gym. There will be a
warnrup period prior to this, be-
tween 12:30 and 1 pm.

Lorinda Yeisley, WRA president.
has described those slamming for
the 1965 winner's slot as “the top
players on South Campus, as de-
termined by elimination games
held informally by each hall this
week.“ Lynne Stoelting, referee
board chairman. Will be handling
this year’s tournament. Each hall
may enter one singles player and
one doubles team. Additional
tables have been moved into the
gym to facilitate several games
running concurrently during the
afternoon. .

Next weekend will give the bad-
minton enthusiasts a chance to get
into the swing oi things. The WRA
badminton tournament, Saturday,
March 6, will involve a similar
matching of contestants who will
have proven their skills on the
court in individual hall play-offs.

Volleyball is now in the past {or
this year, but the halls in the win»

discretion in giving cases lo the
student courts. Students have
maintained that there is a dearth
of cases in the student courts, but
Stauss supported the use of admin-
istrative discretion in dealing with
cases sufficiently serious to involve
questions of suspension or dismis-
sal and in the handling of certain
other cases.

Staiiss acknowledged that many
possibilities of error exist: in con-
nection with due process and juris-
diction, but he stated, “it's typi-
call with courts in general." Ad-
mittedly, he said, a need exists
for a common rationale of penal-
ties in student courts, student dean
offices, and the Faculty Commit-
tee on Student Affairs.

Weekend Matches

By Lee Rothstein

Morgan Michel wrestling in
the heavyweight class for Grin—
nell turned in his most out-
standing performancc of ﬁre
season last Friday. He defeated
his opponent in the final peri-
od with an escape and gave the
varsity matmen a 19-16 victory
over Monmouth.

Contributing to the victory
were Bill Barnes with a deci-
sion, Ken Struhler, with a pin,
Mike Deatherage with a deci-
sion and captain Larry Miller
with a pin.

Saturday Grinnell hosted a
quadrangular meet with guests
Westmar, Simpson, and Coe.

In the meet Grinnell sported
50 points. second only to West»
War with 25 points.

Grinnell wrestler Bill Barnes
at 123 was the only home grape
pier to make it through the
finals as he decisioned his op-
ponent 574.

Although Barnes was the only
successful Grinnell wrestler in
the final round, Commendation
certainly must be given to Ken
Strubler at 130 who wrestled
one of his most outstanding
matches. Strubler, who earlier
in the day pinned Oliver oi
Coe, succumbed to the West-
mar opponent 7-8 on riding
time.

'Larry Miller lost in the finals
2~0 only after receiving an In-
jury.
