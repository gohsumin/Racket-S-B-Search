A New President?

It has been nearly 14 months since President
Howard Bowen quit his post at Grinnell to become
head of the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

1n those months, several rumors of the impending
selection of a ner president have proved unfounded.

Each passing month and each groundless rumor
make the no-president situation more discouraging to
members of the community of a highly thought-of col-
lege.

 

We realize that it must be a difficult task to find
a new president. Still. we would think that the trustees
and administrators could be farsighted enough to real-
ize that men like Howard Bowen are going to advance;
therefore a group of men should be under consideration
It all times for the presidency of the college.

Of course, if our view of the situation is naive and
superficial, it might be because we are not told many
of the facts. The secret meetings with presidential
prospectives continue, but the students never find out
about them because “the privacy of the candidates
must be protected."

A 1900 editorial in the 5&3 noted, “While the stu—,
dents are not qualified to select a man for president,

Shades of Gray
Showing Your True Color

By Carl Otis Gray

it’s spring! Anyone who hasn’t noticed it
should take care to note the rich green car-
peted campus and the tawny tan tapering legs
that are beginning to grace the sun deck on
Main. the tennis courts, the Forum floor, and
all those other intimate niches that the campus
has to provide. This of course, is nothing new;
for years a coppery coat of skin has been the
sign of healthy clean living people of the Pepsi
generation. Now putting aside all denials oi ra-
Cial chauvinism, I find this seasonal phenome-
non highly significant as a point of departure
in an investigation of certain psychological
trends.

Okay, let's start with Man-Tan. In accord-
ance with all the principles laid down by Vance
Packard and David Ogilvy, ManATan is a suc-
cess. Man-Tan is virility. It promises the
rugged, ruddy complexion that marks lumber.
jacks and steel driving men; it promises the
allure and excitement that was previously rer
served for life guards and movie stars. Minutes
irom the everyday "city White,” it can assure
its users of a Florida tan that makes the sec-
ond requirement of “tall, dark, and handsome"
available to everyone from coal miners io oi-
t'ico clerks. There's something overwhelmingly
male about darkness, something strong and at-
tractive.

Then, at course, there's Coppcnonc, This
has an appeal to the young ladies. It promises
that sun»ravished cupric hue that complements

femininity with the “fresh, glad to be alive”
look.

But both of these have a mass appeal calel‘A
ing to the middle class ideal; it's Bain de Soleil
that truly captures the upper class eye. It prom-
ises no less than a ”love alfair with the sun."
No doubt, such an affair would he momentous
even for the most frigid of women — the more
thought of it arouses torrid passions. But such
an undertaking (so to speak) implies a certain
decadence that only Wealth could ever achieve.
Indeed, the golden girls oi this generation are
searching for new thrills and excitement; it
appears that anything under the sun is fair
game. The erotic overtones of a suntan seem to
be getting too hot to handle. .

The suntan worth a mi ion dollars is no
longer a mere advertising cliche but the harsh
reality of John Howard Griffith. 50 when Mr.
Griffith says. “Black Like Me," he does not
strike a discordant note in the ears of Anglo-
Saxia; he merely points out the advantages of
a temporary tonal change. All this is. of course.
in harmony with summer shades. So now, not
only are mns masculine, feminine, and erotic
perlections, but they are financially rewarding.
One can only assume that to have a tan in
America is to have the best of all possible
worlds. This is how America views it accord-
ing to all the available mass media, and yet we
wonder how the black supremacists get that
way. After all, the blacker the berry, the
sweeter the lece!

 

Memphis, ‘Place of Good Abode,‘

 

and their judgment in regard to such a selection could
be questioned, no one doubts that they thoroughly ap->
preciate the task that was before the trustees to find a-
man to take up the work where president Gates leaves
i.t" (As an interesting sldelight, the man whom the
trustees had selected and for whose selection the S&Bi
was praising the trustees in the editorial never took
over the presidency of the college, and Grinnell went
from 1900 to 1902 with an acting president. The col-
lege has also had acting presidents from 1884 to 1887,
1954 to 1955, and 1964 to present.)

Students of 1965 probably wouldn’t take such a
dim View of their abilities for helping choose a newi
president; but since we weren't asked to help, we would i
simply remind the trustees and administration that
taking 14 months or more to select a new president
looks more like desperation than deliberation

Memphis. Tennessee: the name
“Place of Good Abode.”
The billboards point out its repu-
tation as the cleanest city in the,
nation, and the Chamber of Com-
merce spends thousands of dollars
every year on a carnival to pro-
mote Memphis as the ”Cotton
Capital." White Memphis prides,
herself on her reputation as the
most liberal and “peaceful” city
in the South.

But there is another Memphis.
one that most Memphians never
see, or notice. Gradually. l have
come to sec Memphis as the "Com-
placent City." or rather. as two
complacent ciiics. The Place of
Good Abode is a city or white pet»;
ple. Their lite is, at all times, quite .
far removed from that of thei
Negro, for this is a strictly seg-i
regotcd city in spite or its lib»i
et'rllity.

housing in Memphis is so segrer,
gated that buses almost never run
with an integrated load. People al-
ways look at us questioningly, and
they olieii ask it we are sure we
are on the bus we wanted. There
is no hostility, just a friendly con-
earn (the reception we have gotten

nity), There are the usual “nice”
neighborhoods. and there are gave

heartbreaking slums. There are_
mixed neighborhoods, too —— horticr'
areas that used to be white, until
the realtors decided to ‘break" the
block. gradually forcing it into
transition and then into the segre-
gated Negro area adjoining it.
