Cornell Reinstates Protesiors
After Six Weeks of Trials

Civil Charges
Face Students

Cornell College‘s Judiciary
Board reached a decision con-
cerning the student protesters

, ld Sam, the college’s admin-
istration building. The Student-
Faculty Judiciary Board sus-
pended the suspensions oi the
as black protesters, and put
them on disciplinary probation.

lvll charges brought by the

inn County Attorney against
his students are still pending.

The takeover at Old Sem oc-
curred on October 17, 1968, when
36 black Students and three non-
otudants locked themselves in
the building, They presented the
’ﬁdministration with a list of
live demands, which they asked
Cornell's president Samuel

tumpf to promise to implement
within 48 hours. The demands
.were that a black activity cen-
ter be established, that at least
10% of the convocations be pre-
sented by black speakers, that
the curriculum be revised to in-
elude courses on black history
and culture, that the college
step up hiring of black instruc-
tors, and ﬁnally, that no
charges be brought against the
protestors.

President Stumpf refused to
aign the statement, believing
that he did not have the auth-
ority, and Lhat the goals could
not be accomplished in so
short period of time. Because
of pressure from non-protesting
otudents and the Cornell Admirv
istratiun's failure to persuade
the protesting students to give
up control of the building, Col-
lege Vice President and Treas-
nrer Charles Cochran Called the

The report of the Special Fa-
culty Committee on Educational
Policy and Curriculum, the
Haveman Report, submitted to
the faculty and President last
year, has proven to be one of
the most iatvi‘eaching reviews
of academic liie at Grinnell in
recent years. Since the report
was made, several new cour s
have been added to the curricu-
lum. and all departments have
felt its iniluences. Some propo<
sais have already been imple-
mented, others are being
planned. The general reeling is
that curricular afiairs are pre-
sently in a slate of (ion.

In the Science division, a
modification of the science re-
quirement went into eiiect this

ered in two lorms. This year, it
is a a credit course, being oil-
ercd both semesters. Next year

erad. Science I and il may be
taken in either Order.

Midwest Faculty
Meeting Planned
For December ll

An informal discussion among
concerned ia c ulty members
from Grinnell, C08. and Cor-
nell will take place at Grinnell,
December ii. The general topic
for this discussion is the range
of problems which affects in-
stmctors at small liberal arts
collegcs. Some problems that
may be discussed are student
unrest, student pressures, cur-
riculum reform, and social re-
sponsi lity.

Mr. betts, along with a fac-
ulty member from Cornell, has
organized this gathering. Belts
said that in addition to the
problems affecting the Colleges,
“there is a concern about the
academic development of Such
colleges and the role they might
play in an academic world
verging on change, if not revo-
lution."

“We protessors hops to in-
iorm one another on these prob-
lems and gain some insight into
them. Of course, nothing may
come out of it, but hopeiully
this discussion might lead to

Division Meeting
Poorly Attended;
Disinieresi Noied

A meeting was called Mon-
day for all Humanities division
protessors and junior and sen-
ior majors in the division, The
purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the proposal by the
Executive Council regarding
student participation on Edu-
cational Policy Committees in
the three divisions. There were
similar meetings in the other
divisions.

About thirty students and
three prolessors attended the
meeting. According to Dr, Shel-
don P. Zitner, chain'nan of the
division, those who came
were mainly those who agreed
with the ideas set forth in the
proposal, and they were those
who were interested in work-
ing on the Educational Policy
Committee. The discussion.
therefore, centered around the
finer points of the proposal,
such as the number oi students
on the taculty committee and
the role of those students,

Dr. Zitner felt that the most
significant aspect oi the meet-
ing was the lack of interest. Ho
pointed out that if the same
number of students attended.
the meetings held in the other
divisions, the total number or
juniors and seniors interested
in the educational policies gov-
erning their academic interests
would not be more than 100,

The proposal being discussed
concerned the suggestion that
students either participate on
the faculty policy committees or
that they serve on separate stu-
dent Commiitees. It also in‘
cludes suggestions tor function:
to be served by student coma

The Grinnell House, Home of College Presidents

(Continued flom last week)
By STEPHEN GROW

Designed by the Boston Archi—
tects Erainerd and Leeds, the

President's Home was patterned
after the home oi the President
ol Harvard University, it con-
tains 18 rooms and 51/2 baths
on three floors and a base-
ment. It includes such luxuries
as a central vacuum cleaning
system and a dumbwaiter.

It contains such architectural
oddities as wooden gutters,
sand-moulded brick, and spe-
cial rooi tile, differing from the
tile used on the roofs of the
men’s dormitories — Smith
through Dibble — which were
constructed in the same year,
The house still has the original
gutters and root tile, though
the tile on the dormitory roofs
has since been replaced. It also

has the original bricks; so do
the dormitories, Because Presi-

dent Main was so (all, 6'4”, two
oversized bathtubs were in
cluded,

Very little was written about
the house during the adminis-
tration of President Main, but
there are some interesting facts
related to the house. Mr. L. V.
Phelps, retired former Treas-
urer of the College, was head of
the construction crew which
built the Grinnell House. Presi-
dent Main hired him in the
same year that the house was
completed, and he Worked tor
the College until almost 19'
Dr. John Parish, a local physi-
cian, worked for President
Main when he was a student
at Grinnell in 1925, He chauf-
feurcd Mrs. Main around town
in a Hudson automobile, helped
vacuum the house, and cleaned

the numerous oriental rugs
which the Mains had collected.
At the time, it was one of the
most prized jobs on campus.
More information is available
about the life in Grinncll House
during the administration of
President John S. Noilen. Mrs.
Nollen still lives in Grinnell.
She particularly remembers
entertaining guests while living
in the President's House. “Al-
though tha stnictui-e was pat.
terned after the Harvard Uni<
versity President's home, i
thought it was nicer,” said Mrs.
Nollen. “it had a certain
charm." That was fortunate baa
cause every guest lecturer,
speaker, or college administra<
tor was housed and entertained
in the President’s home. Often
the Noilens would entertain
