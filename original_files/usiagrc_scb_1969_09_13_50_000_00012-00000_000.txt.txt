"The passing attack should be

is the big question mark be-

in the backﬁeld and should im-

Bowers says he sees St. Olaf,
Monmouth, and Ripon as the
conference powers with Coo and
Gl’innell as darkhol‘ses. He
believes that the team will be

Fischer also said that at the
time of the broadcast both the
low: Attorney General’a Office
and Mrs. Prescott "indicated
to me that they had some evl<
denoe that What I said in the
editorial was true."

In his request for $20,000 gens i
oral damages and $5,000 spe-

cial damages, Wilhelm allege:
that the statement distributed"
by the college “through Ruth
Prescott" made it clear that he
was being referred to in the
editorial, and that he was “oo-
cused oi the crime oi conspiri-
ocy to commit a misdemeanor,
oi advocating or inciting crime
for his own profit and that the
plaintiff is operating a rolling
business.”

Wilhelm charges that as a

“suiiered o c o n o m l 0 loss

Wilhelm’s enrollment at the
college was terminated during
tho lessor year tor academic
reasons. At that time he was
co-editor oi the 1966 college
yearbook which the college res
fused to publish after legal ad-
visers round that a variety of
material for the book was po.

’ tentially libelous. Wilhelm said

Wednesday that he is "still
working toward publishing the
yearbook, but money is a prob<
iem.”

Asked whether he had helped
organize the Playboy protest so
that he could take photographs,
Wilhelm replied, “That whole
notion is absurd."

Wilhelm admitted being pres-
ent when the protest was or.
gallized, but denied that he par-
tlcipaled in planning the dem-
onstration, He said that neither
Fischer not Mrs. Prescott ever
contacted him to Verify the al-
legations in the editorial, and
that “no one has ever apole
