The defending titlist at 123,
Barnes is 14-2 for the cam»
paign and undefeated and un-
tied in league action.

Strubler, who placed sec-
ond at 130 a year ago, has an
8»2-1 mark for the season
with a tie his only blemish
in conference competition.

The team’s top winner at
14-3-0, Sharpe has a perfect
loop mark at 145, his usual
weight, but dropped one de-
cision when he moved up to
152.

Wilson, the third place fin-
isher at 167 in 1965, is 13-3-2
overall this winter and 6-0-2
against conference foes, His
victims include last year’s 157-
and 167-pound champions.

Other Pioneers likely to
pick up points are Joel Rich-
man, 137; Ray Mendel, 152;
and Lou Kelley, 167.

Coach Terry Moore’s club
topped six conference foes—
Ripon, Beloit, Knox, Mona
mouth, Carleton, and St. Olaf
—in dual meets while losing
to Lawrence and Cornell.

INDOOR TRACK

With only six lettermen on
a 12-man squad that Coach
Dick Young calls the weakest
he’s ever had at Grinnell, the

 

Pioneers are expected to drop
several steps down the ladder.

Only three of the squad
members —— pole vaulter Walt
Neal, high jumper Tom Wood,
and sprinter-middle distance-
man Steve Brintnall—collect-
ed points a year ago as the
Pioneers edged out Carleton
by five points for the indoor
championship and by two
points for the outdoor crown.

A fourth letterman, Jeri
Langham, was one of the top
pointmen on the 1963 and
1964 championship outfits.
but missed the 1965 campaign
while in Central America on
a special study project. He
will anchor three relay teams
Friday.

Probable Pioneer entries in

individual event are:

60-yard dash —« Brintnall
and Jon Buswell; 60-yard low
hurdles »—« Brintnall; 2-mile
run — Doug Dray and Spen:
cer Clark; pole vault —- Neal;
high jump — Wood; long
jump — Buswell; and shot put
—Tom Russell.

Running on the relay units
in addition to Langham will
be Rick MacDowell, John Kel-
sey, Brintnall, and Dray.

SWIMMING
Though picked to finish

 

near the bottom of the stand
ings, Coach Irv Simone’s Pio-
neers are counting on strong
individual performances to
lift theln into the middle eche-
Ion.

Best Pioneer bets for high
placings in individual events
appear to be butterflyer Ken
Adelman and individual med-
ley specialist Steve Holtze.

Holtze has twice defeated
Cornell's Bob Reimers, the
league's defending medley
champ, this winter. Adelman
has lost two times to Phil
Gibbs of Cornell, the loop tit-
list, and Knox’s Brad Routon,
but is hoping the old “third
time a charm” adage comes
true

Sprinter Bill Lontz is anoth-
er Pioneer who could place
among the leaders. He was
second in the 50 freestyle last
winter.

These three will also see ac-
tion on Grinnell’s two relay
units, along with the other
three members of the team—
Bill Batschelet, Rich Seiiert,
and Bob Wells.

Both foursomes are potenti-
al point-getters.

 

Worst Basketball Year
.45 Pioneer: See/t 2nd,

The Pioneers dropped three
more games this past week and
assured themselves of the Worst
record a Grinnell basketball team
has ever had in the Midwest Con—
ference.

Last year's team, which had a
513 record, was the worst previous
one. If the Pioneers pick up both
wins this weekend, they will only
have a 3715 record. Wins this Week-
end will not be easy as both op-
ponents, Knox and Monmouth, own
earlier victories over the Pioneers
and are rated among the better
schools in the conference.

 

The Pioneers spent the weekend

in Wisconsin, visiting Lawrence
and Ripon. There they saw the
home teams pour through the near-
ly unbelievable total DE 225 points
in the two games.

PRO-LIKE FIRST HALF

Lawrence greeted them on Fri-
day night with a 66 point barrage
in the first half, a total usually only
professionals can achieve. After
cooling on to only 49 points in the
second half, Lawrence still finished
with a torrid 54% shooting average
from the field.

The Pioneers did not have a bad
night in shooting, hitting 41%, but
were thoroughly whipped in re-
bounding 63735, which kept the
game iron-t getting close. The ﬁnal
score was 1157B. Jeif Frantz's 27
points led the Pioneers.

HOSPITABLE RIPON

Ripon proved to be a little more
hospitable, Waiting until the second
halt to bury the Pioneers. The Red-
men took only a 48-33 half-time
lead, but. made up for it by poor-
ing in 62 second halt points for [he
110-72 victory. The Pioneers suf-
fcred another humiliating night on
the boards _ losing that battle

3rd Wins

One bright spot for the Pioneers
was guard Mike Schwartz who
scored 20 points.

17 STRAIGHT

Tuesday night the Pioneers trav-
eled to Mount Vernon where they
lost their seventeenth straight road
game 103-70. The last time the Pin-
neers won a road game was the
opening game of last season when
they beat Cornell. This time the
Rams showed no mercy and as-
sured the Pioneers of thelr ﬁrst
undisputed last-place ﬁnish in the
Midwest Conference.

The Pioneers stayed close for a
while. It was tied at 12712 once.
but then Cornell ran off twelve
straight points and were never
again headed.

The halt-time score was 5640
and in the second half the Rams
pushed over the century mark ~
the third straight opponent to do
so — to win 103-70. Cornell was
also the third straight opponent to
enjoy a healthy margin in re-
bounds. The Rams won this battle
63-33.

Leading the Pioneers were Mike
Schwartz with I7, Ted Risser wlth
12, and Greg Rankin won 10.

Calls. Oles
Fall Victim
To Malmen

The Grinnell wrestlers won their
last two dual meets of the year,
beating St. Olaf 23-19 and Wallop‘
ing Carleton 37-8. The two Victories
bring the grapplets' dual meet sea-
son record to an 8 and 6 mark.

Bill Barnes, Gary Wilson, and
Louis Kelley led the Pioneers to
their triumphs with a pair of wins ,
for each. Bames collected two falls
in times of 4:42 and 2125; Wilson
and Kelley each pinned one oppon-
ent with Wilson gaining the fastest
fall or the day in 1:32. ..

Mike Martinson and Bob Gelle
won on one forfeit and one deci-
sion. Ken Stmhler tied in his first
match and won by decision in his
second. Splitting for the altemoon
were John Sharpe and Ray Men<
del: Mendel pinned his Carleton
opponent.

With a look, now, at all the con.
terence teams, Grinnell enters the
Midwest Conference ”1' o u r n a-
mom with promising expectations.
in the past, a pre-lournament tav-
orite to take home the crown has
never been difficult to select;
Cornell has had a long-standing
supremacy that dates back over
more than 20 years. Last year.
however, Cornell won the tourna-
ment by only one point over Mon-
mouth with Grinnell a more dls«
tant third. And this year a light
battle appears even more likely,
for no one is expected to run away
with it.

with a cautious optimism, how-
ever, Coach Moore believes Grin-
nell has the best chance of cup-
ping the first place trophy.

Girls Wipe Parsons;
