‘ For Narrowing Rather than Liberating Students

. Mary’s COUege,

“The pursuit of the undergradu-
ate major is the cart before the
horse," Norman Springer of St.
San Francisco,
Colit, told an audience of stu-

Springer advocated an Integrat-
ed approach to teaming in which
the teacher steps beyong his spec-
ialty to become a learner himself.
Admitting that the image of The
Educated Man, with deep leurn~
ing in all ﬁelds, can only be up
proached. Springer insisted that
despair or a comionhble sell-sat-
isfaction negate even the ap-
proach.

Speaking as a literature teach—
er, he said, “To investigate liter»
ary objects one must ﬁrst be the
sort who would pursue other ob-
jects, especially those one might
tend to take for granted."

never straying into subjects be-
yond his specialty nor welcoming
dilettantes into his own.

“The teacher will have to face
material with fewer ready-made
answers” Springer said, it he nc-
oepts the new kind of education,
the truly liberal education.

“One knows the part one works
on better when one knows what
it is a part of," Springer said,
emphasizing the need to he edu-
cated in more than one discipline.

Summing up, Springer said that
“the general View of the major has
crippled most or us in the dis-
cussion ot a curriculum that
could he truly liberating."

 

East Men Request Answers
To North Campus Questions

To the Editoﬂ

John Burma. chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Student Af-
fairs, suggested in his sociology
class recently. “Anytime that you
wish to change the climate of
something, whether it he on a nu-
tionnl scale or on north cam us,
the ﬁrst thing that must be one
is to define t a problem, It is ne-
cessary to know exactly what the
problem is."

We agree, It is in In Iﬂempt to

define the problem of the prO‘
gosed change of the north campus
all system that we would like
Someone (myone) in the adminis-
tration to answer some questions
that have occurred to us:

1. What attempts have been
made to define the “North
Cam us Problem.” and what
cont: usions have b e e n
reached?

2. Who has been involved in
the discussions to date?

I. What action has been tat-ten
and what decisions have lil-
ready been made by the ad-
ministration?

. \Vhat alternatives have been
proposed and which are most

under consideration?

5. Will [he men of north camp“!
be able to choose in a reier-
endum tram among the pro:
jnosed alternatives, including

eeping the present system.

We don't suggest that this is «no
best of all. possible worlds. but w
do speak as Grinnell students \vh
are pleued with the hall system
as it exists today. It there is n be
ter system. we want to be I run
of it. but we have the feeling ml
we haven’t been consulted Ibou
the proposed chin as. We thin
we ought to he, an . indeed, hav
it right to he.

An answer from somebody in
the administration would greatly
expedite the discussion as tar no
we are concerned.
