SCARLET AND BLACK Friday. October 30, I964

Sir Denis and lady Brogan Enio y
Grinnell's firearm], Relaxed Tone

 

By Susan Taylor

“My wife and 1 are only four-
teen hundred years apart,” Sir
Denis Brogan observed as we

: sat around his office. His wry
humor was showing again, but
he was altogether serious, tool
Both he and his wife have writ-
ten books on France; hers end-
ing in the fifth century; and his,
during th e Third Republic
(1870-1940).

Sir and Lady Brogan are both
visiting professors at Grinnell
this semester. Sir Denis holds
the Rosenneld professorship in
American studies, and he is
teaching a senior seminar.
Lady Brogan teaches two his—
tory classes: ancient civiliza-
tion and archaeology.

It is, then, their academic in-
terests that are fourteen hun-
dred years apart. Their fresh
outlook and charm are very
contemporary

Though they normally reside
in Cambridge, Where Sir Denis
is a member of the faculty of
Peterhouse, a college of about
two hundred students, they
travel to the geographic area
of their main interests each
year. Lady Brogan goes to the
Mediterranean area for a cou-
ple of months, while Sir Denis
comes to America. “We have a

SIR DENIS

 

rendezvous in England from
time to time,” he said.

This is the ﬁrst time they
have spent an extended period
at a small American college.
The C o n pl e find Grinnell
“cheerful and ‘iriendly," but
they said that it is too early in
the year to know enough about
Grinnell students. I asked if
they had heard any rumors
about “North Campus.” Sir
Denis said that he has sensed
a concern, but does not really
know much about the problem.
He said lie would ask some s'tlL
dents what was going on.

They like the relaxed atmos-
phere on campus. “You don‘t
seem to be hurried and fussed
and to think only of your
marks." Lady Brogan said, She
explained that at Grinnell there
doesn't seem to be the competi-
tion to get in things and to do
things that she had observed at
larger American universities.
They were also glad to note
that “nobody had heart failure
at football games.”

While at Grinnell, Sir Denis,
a correspondent of long stand-
ing, is doing some articles for
the London Observer. He re-
cently completed an article on
Cole Porter for the Cambridge
Review. Always busy at his

 

portable typewriter, Sir Denis
is revising his big book on
France, which he wrote in 1940.
“I haven’t read it in twenty-
four years,” he said. “it’s Very
interesting.” The new edition
will be entitled ”The Develop—
ment of Modern France,” and
will be issued in the spring.

In addition to their busy aca~
demic life, the Brogans find
time to enjoy both the college
community and the town of
Grinnell. “We enjoy being able
to walk where we want to go,”
Lady Brogan said. i‘In Cam-
bridge I get around on a bi-
cycle. Here I do all my shop
ping on my two feet." Mrs.
Brogan enjoys the grocery
store in town as much as she
does the college. a professor
told me. She shops at one of
the large supermarkets, but
asked whether it might be un-
fair to print its name.

She smiled as she said that
they enjoy the “lovely rows of
trees and little russet squir<
rels.” Lady Brogan explained
that they have never seen rus-
set squirrels beforesonly grey
ones.

Sadly, Grinnell will have to
bid farewell to (this charming
