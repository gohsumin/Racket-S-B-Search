Repression: Canada . . .

UnnOticed amid the remarkable apathy that has shrouded
Grinnell students to an unusual degree (even for them) this fall
has been a major event on the internationalscene that has grave
portent for civil liberties andsocial change in the United States.
I speak of the extraordinary invocation of the War Measures
Act by Premier Pierre Trudeau of Canada in order to deal with
the terrorism (and the two recent kidnapings) by Le Front de
Liberation de Quebec (FLQ) and the complete equanimity with
which that action was received by the Canadian people.

The War Measures Act, previously used only during WWI&II,
allows the government to arrest anyone without a warrant and
to hold them without charge for up to 21 days. Trudeau, in
announcing the new powers (which did not require parliamenc
tary,approval for institution), saidthatarrests wouldbe limited
to FLQ members and "sympathizers." However, the highest
estimates of active FLQ membership have been about 120;
more than 430 persons have been arrested (of which number
more than 175 have been released, leaving at least 250 still
imprisoned). There are anestimated2,000 "inactive"members
of FLQ.

The War Measures Act has been used so far to justify more
than 1,600 raids on private homes, suppression of any state
ments of support for the FLQ, prohibition of the publimtion in
Canadian newspapers of any FLQ statements, arrest of anyone
suspected of any association whatever with the FLQ. Students,
reporters, workers, politicians (two candidates for mayor of
Montreal were arrested) all have been arrested and face up to
five years in prison unless THEY um DISPROV'E even a remote
connection with or support for the FLQ.

The War Measures Act in Canada violates many of the basic
civil liberties that Americans (and Canadians) have long taken
for granted. However, what little opposition thatwas expressed
to Trudeau's move was stifled after the murder of one of the
hostages, an'act that wasprovokedat least in part by the unduly
harsh measures invoked by the government. Trudeau won a
confidence vote in parliament 190* 16, with the only opposition

' coming from a small minority of leftists who said the govern-
ment was "using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut."

For those who say.“ cannot happen beret-think twice. The
government is already doing its best to eliminate the Black
Panthers, and the public's extreme concern with law—and-
order following this year's rash of bombings rwill tempt the
feds to take strong measures soon. The lack ofa backlash to
the suspension of civil liberties in (‘anadawill tempt American
politiml leaders even more. Expressions of support that the
government has sent to Canada recently do not make me feel
any better.

In 1968 when 10 Mexican students were killed in rioting in
Mexico City just before the Olympics, I rejoiced that sucha
tragedy could not happen here. It happened. Let Canada be a

better lesson for us all.

' Speaking of repression and alluding to Kent State, recent de-
velopments in Ohio immediately come to mind. As most of you
know, 25 students and faculty members have been indicted by
grand jury and the National Guard has been whitewashed by the
same group. While Icannot express surprise,my dismay cannot
be withheld. Will the Feds allow the state to continue? Will the
Scranton Commission's platitudes remain just that? Will the
newly- regained apathy of college students allow the forces of
selective law and order to continue to makea mockery of their
own slogan? Remembering the Fred Hampton case in Qiicago
and watching the same pattern being repeated atJackson State,
I am afraid my questions become merely rhetorical. it makes
Agnew's words sound like extreme understatements when he
says "Americans prefer repressiontoanarchy." Recent events
make one wonder if Americans aren't ready to take Erich
Fromm's "Escape from Freedom." The burden seems too
great for them to bear.

Bill Thomas Explains Position

Dear Sir:

Last week in your paper an
article appeared intimating
that I might be a mndidate for
the honorable ofﬁce of presi-
dent of the Student Govern-
ment Association. Much as I
am flattered by the thought
that I would be worthy of that
position, I feel that I must
make clear, as my responsi—
bility to the people of this fine
college, my position in regard
to the upcoming race,

I disavow, firmly and unequr
ivomlly, the statement thatl
will probably run for SGA pre-
sident. Although this would be
a wonderful opportunity for
me, and although I would cer-
mainly enjoy the experience of
serving our community, my
present assessment of mypo-
sitlon in the Grinnell political
sphere and my present pro-
jected commitments for the
forthcoming college year draw
me to the conclusion that l
would be unable to harness
myself to the buggy of Student
Government.

The office of SGA president

is a grave responsi ility, one
not to be taken lightly, and
certainly one calling for the
highest degree of tact, arti-
culation, and plain old horse
sense. He that as it may, I
must report to the voters that
I am definitely not' currently
in the running.
yours for the people,“
Bill Thomas

Volunteers In
lEAP Program

(continued from page 1)
other groupactivities andhanr
dles much of the recruitment
of volunteers) headed by Grr
anvill Smith of the Physics
department. About 200 volun-
teers have participated in
LEAP, many of them by wei-
ghing garbage, reading odo-
meters or gathering otherda‘
ta.

For this year at least, LEAP
is concentrating on the collec
ge's pollution problems. The
solid waStes group has com-
pleted one three week mea-
suring period and plans to
start another after mid-sem-
ester break and a third in
December. This group is try-
ing to determine ways of les-
sening the considerable am~
ount of solid wastes we pro-
duce at Grinnell. The possi-
bility of grading paper and
selling it exists and bottles
and cans may be recycled.
All recycling plans, however,
are tentative at this point.
There really is not enough in-
formation now to allow forany
extensive planning of solu-
tions.

A survey of the dorms willbe
made after the mid- sem break
by the chemical wastes group
to try to determine chemical
pollution and energy uses of
students. Hopefully, after lea-
rning how We behave LEAP
will offer suggestions as to
how we can make our behav-
ior less damaging to the eco-
logy.

Eventually LEAP hopes to
involve the town in its prog-
ram and cooperate with it in
developing a program for oth-
er small communities simi-
lar to Grinnell to combat their
pollution problems.
