of the most exciting games of
the season played against con-
ference champion Riponl The
Redmen came into town after

Swimmers Journey To Monmouth:
Conference Championship Meel

Carleton College is a slim fa-
vorite to repeat for tShe third
straight year as Midwest Con-
ference swimming champion at
the meet this weekend in the
Monmouth College pool,

The Carls lost several lead-
ing swimmers by graduation,
but still have an individual
titlist, backstroker Scot MC-
Conachie, and several placers,
Stan Siefer, Stu Wilson, Dave
Goldstein. John Kaiser, and
Dennis Meadows, back,

Picked to be the toughest
challengers are Beloit and Law-
rence, with the host Scots ex-
pected to be in the thick of the
fight. Beloit, last year’s runr
nerup, has two outstanding
swimmers in John Van Slyke
and Bill Putnam. Van Slyke
won the individual medley and
butterﬂy. while Putnam took
the 5|] and 100 freestyle last
year. However, the Bucs are
now injury plagued.

Lawrence has good balance,
but will depend mainly upon
Dick 3 n y d e r, breaststroke
champion, and Dan Foster.
diving titlist. Other potential
point winners are Pete Eetzer
and Walt Isaac.

With Dale Heimblich in the
distance freestyle races, Al
Snyder in the backstroke, and
Joel Auble coming on in the in-
dividual m e d l e y, Monmouth
could surprise a few in their
own pooll A leading diver is

 

John Harvey.

 

Cbatlengers for first division
are Cornell and Grinnell, The
Rams will be strong in both re-
lays and have top entrants with
Bob Reimers, Dave Wilkinson,
Phil Gibbs, Jack Bonaker, and
Doug Kirkpatrick Grinnell‘s
main hopes ride with its big
four, Ralph Pray, Tony Hor-
ton, Howard Schein, and John
Kraai, who has bettered the
league mark in the breast-
stroke.

Knox has only one letterman
back, Tod Brown, who was
third in diving and the 200 but-
terfly, but could get points
from Jim Johnson in the indi-
vidual medley. St. Olaf's main
threat is Erik Lokensgard, one
of the best in the backstroke.
Weak in numbers, Coe could
move up in the standings if
Bruce Hop continues his line
performances in the freestyle
sprints.

Trying to close out the sea-
son on a winning note, the Pio-
neers go on the road this weelo
end against Knox and Mon
month. Tonight the Scarlet
plays the Siwash at Galesburg
and Saturday take on the Scots
in the league finale.

Grinnell has already downed
Knox twice this year, once by a
recordrbreaking 10240 margin
at home and again in the U. of
Chicago Holiday Tourney cham-
pionship game, 64-61. Since
then, however, the Siwash have
picked up and are currently in
4th place in the MCAC and
sporting one of the league‘s
best offensive averages, 31.4
points per game. Earlier this
season. they rolled up 118, 106
and 105 points in three conse-
c u t i v e conference games.
Strangely enough, Knox has no
one in the league's top 14 scor-
ers. They rely on four men—
Jeff Sandburg, Brandon Piper,
Doug Ziech and Dave Wotring—
who average in double figures
and give Coach Harlan Knosh-
er just about the most balanced
offense in the circuit.

Monmouth surprised Knox
last weekend 61-55. but it
wasn't enough to lift the Scots
out of the conference cellar.
Possessing only four wins, one
of which was an 83779 upset
over ‘Grinnell, Monmouth relies
mainly on the scoring of Gary
Gilliland, Whose 19.3 average
puts him seventh in league
scoring. Gilliland also gets
plenty of support from Harold
Rathgeb and Dick Rodgers. The
Scots are currently ranked
among the top ten teams na-
tionally in free throw percent-
age, a fact which was instru-
mental in the win over Knox.
The Illinois crew hits well from
the floor in addition, netting H
of their first 17 shots earlier
this year at Darby Gym.

Coach John Pfitsch plans to
start the same lineup he used
last Weekend and in the loss at
Cornell on Tuesday. Plitsch had
a great deal of praise for the
spirit of the team in the last
few games and singled out
Randy Morgan for special
mention. Morgan, a reserve
most of the year, started at for-
