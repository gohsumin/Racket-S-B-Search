NORTH CAMPUS It Mo‘s

By JIM WILSON

The great Sigmund Freud
stated in one of his scholarly
works that "any kind or trus-
rtration, any thwarted instinct-
ual satisfaction, results or may
result in a heightening of the
sense of guilt." In order to
relieve the many frustrations
caused by the academic lite
and to reduce the sense or
guilt caused by certain actions
in the last two weeks the men
or North Campus have return-
ed to the football ﬁelds and
tennis courts for another year
of I. Ml’s. ' f

The football season opene
Monday with easy victories for
gates, who beat South 234, and
Dibble, who ran over Smith‘
BM. North also won out over-
the chicanery or Cowles Hi,
Tuesday saw West nip Rawson
8-0, and East pummel-Langan
dl-ol East must have an

awful lot of frustration and
guilt feelings. South was again
defeated, this time by Clark,
17-6.- Dibble looks like the
éam to heat but this will take
some doing.

Tennis is again being run as
a team sport. Dan Markman,
head or the program, says that
this is to enable more people
to participate in the intramural
program and it- seems to be
rulrilling its purpose very well.
North. Smith, and East figure
to be the powers in tennis in
what should be an interesting
season. ,

A Clinic for officials has been
instituted this year and the pay
oi the officials has been in-
creased. This should improve
one of the major short comings
of the program; the need for
competent officiating. All in all
it looks like it should be a Very
cathartic year on North Cam-
pus.

week in antimpatlon at its open-
er against Cornell two weeks
from tomorrow Coach Edd
Bowers continues to be cau-
tiously optimistic by saying that
the Pioneers have as good a
chance as anybody to take the
conference crown.

B ow e rs is particularly
pleased by the great amount at
depth that the Pioneers have
this year - something that has
been lacking in past years.

At the moment he has an
offensive line that has only one
non - letterman in it. At 0i-
tensive ends he names senior
Tom Hill and Junior Jim POL
son as the leaders Olher first
stringers are Junior Phil Wood-
ward and co . captain Rick
Andersnn at the tackles, sopli

Coach Ray Obermiller. some
what optimistic this season, re-
marked that “things have been

looking belter.’ Although sixth ‘

man Steve Home is out with a
lame foot, he noted, there are
three new additions to the six
man varsity squad, These three
are not quite ready for real
competition, says Obermiller,
but they should be genuine as-
sets to the squad as the sea-
son moves along,

long distance training, Coach
Obermiller has lately begun

sprints. Through all of its pun.
ishing practices, mentioned the
coach, the team has maintained
good spirit, .

The Pioneers will really get
a tough run in their opener.
Drake has a rugged team fea-
turing many outstanding in<
dividuals, including four sophO‘
mores who were all state
champs in their high school
days. In the National freshman
twomile meet. Kansas—led by
world milerrecord holder. Jim
Ryan — was the only schoul to
beat the Bulldogs.

Obermiller also hopes tor
good things from his ir‘eshmau
cross-country runnersr Although
most oi the boys on the large
freshman team are inexper-
ienced, explained the coach,
eight or nine have the potential
to become outstanding runners.

Bowers does not have as
much backfield depth as he
would like because of having
