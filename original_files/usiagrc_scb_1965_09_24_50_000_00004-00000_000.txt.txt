New Instructors State Ideals,
Otter Experience, Achievement

Ed. Notell Following are
mries about four of Grinnell‘s
new professors. Next week more
of the new faculty members will
be covered.

Zimmar

A new instructor in psychology
is George P. Zimmar, Zimmar
holds 35. and M.Al degrees from
Roosevelt University. He has spent
the past {our years working on
a variety of research problems in
psychology at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Buffalo. He
also worked as a part-time instruc-
tor at Millard Fillmore College,
the evening division of Buffalo,
teaching physiological and intro-
ductory Psychology, He has been
It lecturer at Rosary Hill College
in Williamsvllle, New York. Sev-
cral of his papers have been pub-
ﬁshed.

Pollak

Desire to teach in a small liber-
al arts school was chief among
the motivations which brought
William Pollak, new instructor in
economics, to Grinnell College this
fall. A graduate of Oberlin Col-
lege, he received his master's
degree from Princeton University.

Preferring a student discussion
approach in his classes. the young
instructor believes that the pur»
pose of a professor is to develop
rtudent interest in his field. "Too
often a teacher feels that his job
Is to impart to his classes the
knowledge which he has accum-
mulated,” he explains. "l teel that
the real challenge is to create a
curiosity about our field and to
show students how to pursue this
curiosity."

 

Nelz'gar

Benny D. Nefzger, new instruc-
tor in sociology at Grinnell, comes
to us with a B.S.c, degree from
the University of Iowa He re
cently completed his M.A. re-
quirements at Southern Illinois
University. where he also finished
nearly all courses for his PhD.
degree.

Between his graduation from
Iowa and his matriculation at
Southern lllinois, he spent three
years in the United States Air
Force and worked for the St Louis
branch of the Maytag Companyl

Edwards

The theory that a liberal arts
education serves no practical pur-
pose is strongly refuted by Jack
Edwards, Grinnell‘s new assistant

professor of political science. “For
most professions, four years ot
college is not enough; more spe-
cialized training is u sually
required." he commented.

Four years of instruction in bus-
iness administration, for example,
is no longer a passport to success
in the business world, according
to the young teacher. “Most com»
panies are interested Ln bright.
capable young men whom they
will be willing to train them-
selves." he continues l‘The broad
understanding and perspective
which result from a liberal arts
education give the Grinnell grad-
uate an advantage over the typi-
cal university graduate."

Specializing in the American [)0
lltical system, Edwards is a grad-
note of Macalester College and
recently completed studies for his
LLB. at Harvard University.

 

‘Hidden Scholarship’ Is Worth $1200
To Us Poor. Tattered Grinnellians

Did you realize that you. you
poor, broke, tattered Grinnelllan,
are the proud, it unwitting, pos-
sessor of a $1200 scholarship? A
“Hidden Scholarship" — that‘s a
clever little term that the adminis-
tration applies to the tact that if
each student were charged the
full cost of a Grinnell education,
he would be coughing up 53700 per
year instead of his present gruel-
ling $2600. And what are the other
sources of financing? Or, to put it

in more Grinnellian terms, who
the heck kicks in the rest?

Well, there's the endowment
fund—including the income pro-
ducing properties, like “our" se-
curities, oil wells and such, which
totaled up are worth about l5 mil-
lion and yield about $350,000 a
year. Then there are capital giits,
like the Ford Foundation affair,
and. on the other hand, gifts from
people. All of which are quite vital
and necessary since the 1964—65
budget was $4,110,619.

Expenses range all the way from
$22,000 tor laundry (think what
they could save it they’d only let
the student body sleep on their
bed pads) to $200,000 in fringe
benefits for employees. Others in-
clude: 75,000 for electricity; 13,000
for water (signiiying that Grinnel—
lians study more and bathe less?)
60,000 for fuel; 16,000 for fire in-
surance (possibly this could be
reduced if some funds were chan-
neled into buying some ashtrays
for ARH); 673,000 for building and
grounds (probably subsidized by
north campus social funds): and
1.400.000 for salaries.

What it all adds up to is that if
someone just off the top of his
head decided to buy GrinnEII Col-
lege, it would cost ’em 25 million.
And although not always consid»
ered an asset by the administra-
tion, it causes one to wonder—is
the student body also included in
this figure?

Wall Discusses Year in Sweden.
Describes Scandinavian Education

By ANNE FARRER

“Like a Minneapolis on the
coast" is how Joseph Wall (his-
tory) describes oothenhurg, Swe-
den. where, taking a bit of a
husman's holiday, he worked at
the University of Gothenburg last
year setting up an American Stud-
ies program.

Teaching a lecture course and
a seminar, he found that Swedish
students do not work quite as
hard as American since they take
their final exams at their own
discretion—and as a result of their
own discretion, some had re
mained ot the university for ﬁve
or six years and gave no indi-
cation ct leaving within the near
future.

Sweden’s educational system
neatly avoids two rather common
us. collegiate problems: open
dorms and beards. The ﬁrst is
due to the fact that Gothenhurg,
as most European schools, has
no residential campus, or much of
a campus at all, since the depart-
ments are scattered all over the
city and the two dorms that they
do have are owned by the govern.
ment and run by the students.

Swedish secondary schools give
the student the equivalent of an
American junior college educa-
tion. and by the time they reach
the university, the students are
approximately 20 and have
"grown out of and gotten over (he
heard stage.”

Wall ter Sweden is "pleas-
ant and civilized country" which
has also rather neatly avoided a
few domestic problems by avoid—
ing war and not having war costs
to burden the national budget.
However, this does not imply that
militarily or ideoligically Sweden
is in a state oi vegetation, for
“it is a neutral but not pacifistic
country" with universal conscrip-
tion. Wall expressed the View that
within the next three or four
years, unless there is an inter-
national armament control, Swe-
den will develop itself as an atom-
ic power. He also observed that
the high standard of living there
is matched and well correlated
with its cost. As for the people,
the Walls enjoyed them, although
“they seemed to be eating most
of the time."

To avoid “the long. dark Swe—

 

dish winter" the Walls traveled to
Greece for Christmas. .During the
summer they made several side
trips: to Leningrad, which had ‘
“depressing air of post-war ex-
haustion” and a limited selection
or material at the news standsn
to the other Scandinavian coun-
tries, which are quite distinct from
one another; and to northern Swo-
den, where Wall attended a semi-
nar tor English teachers from all
over Scandinavia, including Ico-
land.
