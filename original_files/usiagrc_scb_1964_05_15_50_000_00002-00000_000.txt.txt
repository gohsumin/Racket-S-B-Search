Transcript Trouble

Last June, the Board

scholarship repayment rule because of student
sure in the form of a referendum which calle

of Trustees abolished the
YES-
for

repeal of the clause by a vote of 644-77. The reason
for rescinding the rule, given both by the students and
by the Board, was that such regulation was not in
keeping with the philosophy of a liberal arts college.

There is another un-liberal-arts like rule that ought
to be brought to students’ attention and which ought
to be rapeaied by the Board of Trustees. This regula-
tion states that any student who sends a transcript
to another college immediately loses eligibility for a
room the following year, regardless of the fact that
he or she has paid the $50 room-reservation fee.

In explaining the reason behind this rule, one ad-
ministration member noted that il: makes it easier for
the college to assure rooms to students who are sure
of returning. While this might be the case, it is still
a fact that the student has paid $50 to guarantee a
room and that this $50 will be lost if the student finally

does decide to transfer.

This $50 should be sufficient payment to the col-
lege in cases where a student really is not sure of re-

turning in the fall. Why

compound his worries by

cutting him off from this college before he is accepted

at another school?

The college has every right to want to keep its
first-rate student body, but it should use positive

means of doing so.

Sanity of Stones

Of course, it goes without
saying that there will be a
few ”minor problems” and
*"little difficulties” [0 be taken
care of after’ a nuclear holo-
caust. » One of these “minor
problems" concerns itself with
the question of what we are
going Do do about our jobs
after a nuclear cataclysm.

The United States Govern»
silent, in its inimitable way, has
come up with the answer to
this question. Most of the gov-
ernmental branches have sent,
in recent months, memoran-
dums to all personnel concern-
ing what is expected of them
regarding their job obligations
after a thermonuclear war.
Illustrative of these memoran-
dums is the following directive
from Madeleine O’Brien, ad-
ministrative officer of the U. 5.
Commission on Civil Rights:

“All employees, if prevented
from reporting to their regular
place of duty because of enemy
action, are requested to go to
the nearest Post Office and ask
for a federal employee registreu
tlon card. Fill out all spaces on
the card and return it to the
Post Office clerk. The employ»
lug agency in the registration

 

card should be shown as Gen-
eral Services Administration,
with the branch as the U. S.
Commission on Civil Rights in-
asmuch as our official records
are maintained by GSA. The
Post Office will forward your
card to the Civil Service Com-
mission. When the Civil Serv-
ice Commission- receives your
card, they will notify the Gen-
eral Services Administration.
They can then decide where
and when you should report for
duty. This should be done as
soon as possible after an attack
to enable you to be kept on the
roster of active employees and
to have your pay forwarded to
you. If you change your ad-
dress after the card has been
sent, get a new one in the same
manner prescribed above. Ali
though you complete your reg-
istration promptly, there may
be some delay before you re-
ceive your work instruc-
tions. . .”

I am indebted to Jack A.
Smith of the National Guardian,
which is, incidentally, an excel»
lent and highly informative
progressive newsweekly, for
this beautiful example of “Red
Tape uber alles."

Letters to the Editor

Corrects Herzog Statement:
Clarifies Position on Nominees

To the Editori

Since I was substantially mis-
quoted by Mr. Herzog in the
Senate article which appeared
in last week’s 5&3, I feel that I
must endeavor to set the rec-
ord straight. Referring to the
High Court nominees of Pete
Klein, Nonie Goldman, Vince
Anku and Bill Zwink, I was
quoted as stating, “there could
have been better people."

Essentially this was not my
opinion then or now. A minor‘
lty of the Nominations Commit-

tee abstained from voting on
one nominee but it should be
emphasized that not one vote
was cast against any of these
people. The statement printed
by Mr. Herzog was a minority
opinion representing neither my
views nor those of the majority
of my committee.

If Mr. Herzog wishes to quote
such a statement, I feel he
should endeavor to place it in
the proper context. Slipshod
methods of reporting the news
benefit no one.

lfurasch's Critique,

Defends Movies Program at Grinnell

To the Editori

Grinnellians, pity Don Kur»
asc‘h—his main hope has not
been realized In his recent let-
ter to the editor (May 8), he
introduces his brilliant com-
mentary on the pizza purchase
by the following statement:
“My main hope in this letter

is that my anger after reading
the article in last week’s 5&3

(regarding the budget passed
by the SGA) does not cause me
to go astray and obliterate the
point I plan to make." I’m
afraid his anger has lost him
in areas far distant to the piz-
za purchase. I wish to com-
ment on only one of Kurasch’s
profound but unrelated pro-
nouncements.

Kurasch severely criticizes the
movies program by stating that
students “have often and right.
iy complained about the quality
of die movies brought here."
He characterizes the typical
film shown as being a “Grade
C piece of film trash." 1 ques-
tion the quality of Kurasch’s
knowledge. As a point of mu,
Hollywood's ranking system
does not extend beyond the B
level. Therefore, it is impos
sible to show a Grade C pic-
ture. Furthermore, if one

checks the published spring
film calendar, one can hardly
generalize these works as “film
trash."

As the new movies chairman
for 1964~65, I am receptive to
knowledgeable and intelligent
criticism. Kurasch’s statements
are neither. His personal “an»
ger" has led him astray in this
area too. Because his anger is
so overpowering, 1 seriously
question Kurasch’s qualifica-
tions for spokesman of total
campus opinion. Perhaps Kur-
asch has verbally complained
in the past about the movies
program. If so, I would appreci—
ate any thoughts he has con-

cerning it, but not absurdities

} Senate

Continued from Page 1

Campbell suggested that the
student body does not unden-
stand the functions of the courts
and this hinders effective coun
action. The Senate voted to
send a directive to the Execu-
tive Cabinet asking that a com-
plete list of the combined rights
and obligations of the defend-
ant be placed in the next Stun
dent Handbook.

The question of disaffiliation
from the United States Nation-
al Student Association was
postponed until the next Senate
meeting. Phil Johnson, 5. G. A.
President, could not attend the
meeting and, in a letter to the
Senate, asked that the discus.
sion of N. S. A. be delayed for
a week.

There was some dissent over
the matter of once again de-
laying action on N. S. A. John
Black felt that the call for de-
lay was a “tactic to put off de-
bate until a time when the
Senate would not have a nude
rum." Richard Heilbron stated
that "we should not delay this
particular business any long-
er.” The Senate, heeding John-
son’s plea, decided for delay.

The appointment of Carol
Yenawlne as secretary to the
Executive Cabinet was ap-
proved. in reaction to the criti-
cism leveled on the Senate for
its pizza resolution, the body
refused to approve the remain-
ing $20.49 from the judicial re-
serve of the school year 1963-
64 for the purpose of a party
for the members of the Men’l
Primary Court then serving.
Students funds are safe for the
time being
