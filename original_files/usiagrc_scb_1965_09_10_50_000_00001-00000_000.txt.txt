“I don’t believe in the ‘ln Loco
Parentis’ conceptr The time iii
gone when the administration of a
college can regulate student mor-
ality; besides. I look too young to
be anyone's father," said 47-year-
old Dr. Glenn Leggett during an
interview Monday.

Grinnell’s new president thinks
that freshmen need to be guided
through their first year; “then
regulatory controls should be red
laxed."

No specific proposals will be
coming from the president's office
for a while. Dr. Leggett says he
still needs some time up look the
situation over. He wasn’t cone
tacted about the presit’ runtll
late in May.

He was offered me post un July
9 and officially accepted on July
12. Dr. Leggett's appointment was
effective Sept. 1, but he won't be
on campus permanently until Sept.
16‘ or 17r

To get to know Grinpell better.
Drr Leggett will start talking with
the college constituency about in
promises and problems.

"My concern is mainly with the
academic environment. I want to
arrive at a definition of the aca<
demic environment at Grinnell.
Our definition will, however. need
constant reevaluation to prevent a
stagnant environment."

‘Dr. Leggett was provost of the
University of Washington in Seattle
since 1963. He had been directou'
of freshman English, special asslst-
ant to the president, and vice pro-
vost.

He has a BA. from Middlebury
College and an MA and Ph. D.
from Ohio State University. He
taught at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Ohio State be.
fore going to Washington.

In other comments, Dr. Leggett
said, "I’m not an ‘either-ar' man
in the field of education. I believe
in public education, but l recognize
the special integrity and responsi<
bility of a small liberal arts
school."

Also, Dr. Leggett sees taculty
salaries, the residence hall situa<
tion and monetary support for tho
college as some of the big issue!
that must he faced this year a!
Grinneiir

Dr. Leggett said he has observed
a healthy feeling of respect and
pride for Grinnell among all seg-
ments of the Grinneil community
without reaching the proportion:
of selfrglory found at some schools.

Dr. Leggett explained, "when
you reach a certain age. you want
to be in a situation where you are
still growing. This is why I came
tl) Grinnell. And I intend to be the
president here."
