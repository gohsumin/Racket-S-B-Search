Cornellians Decrie lack of Power;
Declare Legislation ‘Non Existent'.

3 “Student Council is. a deceit. At t posal that "an open dorm policy

Cornell, student government has
a power to do anything but ex-
press opmion and allocate the
budget,” said Cornell College's
Student Council President Trayer
at a gathering of 300 students and
faculty.

The meeting occurred after a
hapel talk which questioned the
administration’s propaganda for
attracting prospective students
with "government by the stu-
dents” when in the speaker’s opin<
ion, such government did not
exist. He declared that if the
council does not receive more
authority it should disband.

The new council president said
that while there were a ‘few sig-
nificant changes that had oc-
curred, 1 submit that they do
not seem worth the effort of meet-
ing once a week during two sem-
esters." He stated that legislation
was “non—existence in Cornell Stu-
dent government."

When as dean was questioned
during the meeting about dress
standards, he said that no changes
ad been made because of a lack
of communication between stu»
dens and administration. As to
who makes recommendations for
.eform, the dean said that since
the faculty does not concern it-
self with the daily student life, all
decisions are made by the presi<
dent through the deans.

Open Dorms —Ciosed issue

. "The matter of open dorms is a
closed issue,” declared Coe’s pres»
ident in an open letter to the cam-
pusr His reason was that “sev-
,ral excellent colleges which
have open dorms have greatly re-
stricted the program in the light
of experience, or completely
bandoned the policy,"

The open letter was an answer
to the Coe Student Council's pro-

 

be instituted on a trial basis for
four weeks in the spring term."
The suggested hours were 1-4 on
Sunday afternoons. Coe already
has no hours for senior women on
Friday and Saturday nights.

Beloit Civil Rights

The Beloit Civil Rights Interest
Group is planning to enlist stu-
dents in an effort to help the dis-
advantaged townspeople of Eeloit
help themselves. For the last two
weeks a task force has traveled
to various service organizations
in Eeloit finding out what they do,
their needs, and what role the
college students could play in the
community.

On a tour of the community, stu.
dents reported individuals living
in squalor as had as the slums of
the large cities. Four or more
families live in facilities that were
intended for only one family. In
South Beloit, people are housed
in chicken coops,

Beloit's varsity lettermen club
has already built a $1200 basket-
ball court in an economically de-
pressed part of Beloit, They also
built a baseball diamond which
the city refused to build.

Parsons Blackout

Two weeks ago Parsons College
faced a blackout when an elec-
trical storm caused all the power
to be cut off. Without the lights
all Hell broke loose.

A car of boys drove around the
campus yelling “let's go get ’em”
and moments later hundreds of
boys swarmed into the girls’
halls. They broke down doors,
tr e m pie cl proctors, ransacked
rooms and stole articles of Cloth-
ing. One girl reported that $67
worth or clothing had been taken
from her room.

The student union suffered only
a small student-lit fire.

 

in the _

fraternity area, firecrackers reXr
ploded constantly and large
groups of boys slung mud on the
windows of the sorority houses.
