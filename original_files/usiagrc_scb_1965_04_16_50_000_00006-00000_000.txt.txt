b ‘We Don'i Serve Mixed Groups'

(Continued from Page 3)

places is only nominal, Walk
into the Pancake House down-
town in a mixed group and you
will shortly hear the words:
"I’m sorry. we don't serve
mixed groups. it you will sit at
separate tables. I'll be glad to
serve you.” Or perhaps the
waitress will put down three
plates for the three Negroes
and ignore the white person,
saying: “I have to serve them
but I don't have to serve you,"
an erroneous assumption. The
question why? is unanswerable

and out of place in this situa-
tion.

One white Mississippiau said
that all the Negroes he knew
would like to get their hands on
James Meredith for forcing the
situation the way he did. A

white middle class couple told
us of a social structure in which
a good name was the most im-
portant thing. This is the aris-
tocracy and the good name is
its tradition. Here the place of
the Negro is in the homeY the
white home. This position pm~
yides honor, security, and live-
lihood for the Negro. He is
treated with dignity and respect
in his subservient role. But
what about the Negro with a
college education? Flash cards
again, but no answer. Then they
say Negroes have only been ex

posed to civilization for IOU
years; consequently, their so»
cial customs and education
have not evolved to the degree
of the White institutions. But
isn't it rather that ﬂiese things
have been held back and isn't
education really something to
be gained Within the lifetime of
each individual and not some-
thing which evolves? Again the
flash cards, but no answelx

But there is light even in this
darkness. There is a feeling of
guilt about the crimes of Philae
delphia and Selma. Sheriff
Rainey and his cohorts do not
represent the South and their
actions are inexcusable and uns
justifiable. In some places there
is a certain pride attached to
having a decent relationship
with a Negro. And recently, the
most influential businessmen’s
organization in Mississippi has
ofﬁcially approved the Civil
Rights Bill as right, good. and
necessary, but perhaps only at
the threat of suspension oi fed-
eral aid.

In conclusion, as was noted
in New Orleans, the confeder-
ate flag still flies front and

center in the parade, but now
there is a Negro in the band
that is playing Dixie.

Grinnell students Meg Eluhm,
Cynthia Brust. Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens are now in resi-
dence at LeMoyne.

Rare Gas Research
Is Physicisi’s Topic

By Susan Barquist

The noble (rare. inert) gases
have intrigued chemists and
physicists since their discovery.
Tuesday evening Dr, Howard
Claassen spoke to an ACS
meeting on this interesting top-
ic. Dr. Claassen, oi the depart
ment or physics at Wheaton Col-
lege, gave a brief history or
work on the rare gas elements,
describing in detail research at
the Argonne National Labora»
iory. '

The history of rare gases be-
gan in 1894 when argon was
first isolated from air. By 1900
all the “inert" gases had been
discovered. Claassen indicated
that the notion of their ”inert-
ness” has been doubted from
time to time since their dis-
covery.

Claassen described the activ-
ity and surprises ot the re-
search lab as a group of scien-
tists worked to synthesize the
first clearly identified rare gas
compound—xenon tetrafluoride.
With a laugh he told of a by-
product which formed in the
traps of the apparatus and ex-
ploded when warmed. \

During the question period
Dr. Claassen answered the ex
pected — “What uses do these
rare gas compounds have?"—
With a calm “The research sci-
entist doesn't usually think oi
such things.

— Jack Swenson (chemistry)
and Donna Renaud.

Miss Renaud is a [964 Grin-

advanced study in biochemistry
at Western Reserve University.

Dicyanocarbene was success-
