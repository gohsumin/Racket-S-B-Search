By Jim Herzl):

Worried frowns are beginning to form on the brows
10f Grinlicll’s full-sports coaches. Here it is, October 12, and
lilo Grillilell athletic team has yet managed to lose it con-
lfei'eiice contest. “Has the faculty read in the 5&3 that
lour winning teams tire the result of '1)1'ccise calculatioli’

lili recruiting?” the coaches might well be wondering.

‘ There hasn’t been I! mill [or a fllculty investig tion
iyct. But if the Gl'innell athletic teams don’t stop their ins
lcessantg victory mongering, an investigation is in order.
i If I had the pleasure of heading a facility investiga-
:tion coln’mittee, I’tl first question Irv Simone, the soccer
iconch. I’d ask him what effective scouting network had
‘idl'scovei-ed two of his top players, Frank Chilingulo and

lViliceiit Anltti, both students from Africa.

1 I’d budget- him further about his well conditioned soc-
‘cel' co-cziptains, Bill Molitfoi't (from New Jersey) rind Don
iCook (‘ll'om Geneva, Switzerland). Then, as Couch Simone
lsat speechless (from guilt of course), I’d turn my ntteiis
‘thllS' to Dick Young, the cross country coach.

l I’D‘ ASK YOUNG how he managed to come up with
‘ifive sophomore runners just as the varsity hopes began

ito dim. If he replied that three of these runners had not

‘revell l‘llli cross country in high school, I’d look on to facts
illnll.

0.

Here I'd put both Head Coach Edd Bowers and his
football assistant, Athletic Director John Pfitsch, on the
island. I‘d continue lny questioning along the same line as
before. Hours later, after Coach Pfitsch had finished his
opening I‘em‘dl'l and had noted the high grade-point ave s
rig-c ol‘ Gi'illliell athletes and the fact that the Grilmell Col-
lege football team‘s roster lists players from 13 states, I’d
motion that the committee cancel tiny further investigation.
