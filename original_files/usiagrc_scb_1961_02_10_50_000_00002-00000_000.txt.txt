To the Editor:

Mr. Morris’ letter of last week‘
concerning the “Grinnsll Re.
view” deserves, I think, an an
swer by someone who is more
aware of the problems which
confront such a student publiv
cation and of the recent history
of the “Review" than Mr. Mor-l
ris appears to be. since its in-‘
ception in the spring of 1959,‘
the “Review" has made no pro
tense of being an exclusively}
literary journal. it ‘has printed
two articles dealing with his
torical topics, one with biology,i
and a group of pseudo»philoso-
phical analyses Each of these‘
seemed to be met with a good
deal of interest by our sub—,
scribers
l The reason for such diversity
is obvious The job of editing,
such a magazine is primarily al
selective, not a productive one.
In other words, a lack of good
fiction is a lack on the part of
the Grinnell students rather
than the editorial staff.

On a campus which has only
one class concerned with writ—
ing creative prose, where stuvl
dent poets (and we have some
remarkably good ones) have to
work entirely on their own with-

shown in some of these articles
we feel is compensated for by a
unique breath of point of view
and their pertainacity to the
Grinnell student.

Another reason that the "Grid
nell Review” feels free to use
material from a variety of fields
is because unlike “NOUS” it is
neither sponsored nor subsidized
by any department or studenti
fund to whose purposes it would
bc obliged to limit itself. It is
financially dependent, therefore.
on advertisements and studentt
subscriptions to cover its operat
ing expenses, and we have di
covered that both these sources
tend to vary rather too unpr
dictably for comfort. 1 persons
ally doubt that a student pub-
lication of the nature of the
”Review" can exist for long and
Serve a meaningful role on cam-
pus without some more depend~
able means of financial support.

These are the reasons for the
abbreviated length (you needn’t
count the pages, they‘re numr
bored) and the only partially
literary contents of the latat
issue of the “Grinnell Review”.

A committee appointed by the council to consider mem-|

bership reported a few weeks ago that it would delay
any final recommendations until “The Beloit Report" a
detailed analysis of Beloit’s investigation of the organi-
zation, and its recommendations had been considered

The Beloit analysis proved a favorable one for the
Association, but there are still objections to be reckoned
with. One of these comes from the budgetary point of view.
NSA membership will cost at least $200 dollars; right
now the council has 49 cents, Some have suggested that this
money might come from a decision to resign from the
national Association of Women Students wllich presently
spends $162.00 annually. This money is used by the AWS
Board in order to Send officers to the regional and na»
tional conventions. This ”out" however has its drawbacks

from his usual mental condition,
but this week he is especially at
‘odds with the world. Perhaps his
feeling of unrest is due to the
four flimsy little papers he re-
ceived in his mailbox Monday
afternoon, or perhaps he has seen

mum of real thought and study;
it also contains several points
which, I cel, make it inferior to
the existing one.

down and spewed forth a bewilda

But the happiness faded as

Some adventurous souls, in-

influence felt,

The “pro" side of the NSA questions is filled with
the fine record shown by the organization during the loy~
alty oath problem The NSA is a recognized lobby group

which has made itself felt in Washington on several oc-
casions and often on matters in wllich Grinnell students
have shown some interest or sympathy. Among its other
activities are included a continuing liberal stand on the
sit-in movements, support of the Peace corps and a lobby
concerned with the dubious practices of the House and
Senate Investigating committees.

In addition to its national voice, NSA at Grinnell,
locally, might provide some of the “continuum" needed to
preserve the interest in national affairs encouraged by
Duane Krohnke and company, Such “continuum" may come
in handy next year when the student council leadership
leaves their hands. The pressure provided by an outside
group dedicated to reflecting and encouraging “the broad-
er loo ” among students, may well be the very thing
which will keep the work of this last year’s Student Colin—
cil from falling by the wayside, as just another wave in
the Grinnell interest cycle.

As has been shown, membership will involve some
problems; leaving national AWS may not be the answer
to the bugetary question; the Women’s Association should
certainly not be dropped without a thorough investigation
and report Aside from the money, however there seem to
be few insurmountable obstacles, and arguments for NSA
membership look too good to be overlooked

For a few minutes my pro-

made of many thin layers of
pastry—nuts and spices through-
out, swimming in a syrup.
