Senate Defeats
Election By Law

A constitutional bylaw whiclii:
would have changed the proce—

dure of electing class oﬁicers,vt *

avoiding some of the confusion
which was connected with the F
last freshman class election, .
was defeated at Wednesdayl‘
night’s Senate meeting.

CFlie by—law, which was made
by Main hall senator Sue Tay—
lor, was: “I move that the pro.
cedure for electing class oiri—
cers be as follows: Nominees
shall be those students subl‘n
ting an application to the out
going class piesident (or other'
poison designated by him) prior,’
to an all class nominating elec-
tion. The two candidates for
each onioc drawing the highest
number of votes on the nomi-l
nating election will be the nonNiel
inees for the ﬁnal election.
Sooner than 48 hours after tNhe‘
results ot the nominating elec<
tion are announced, the otricers
shall be elected by a inajo ty
of the votes cast in the norm-
nating election, he shall be due
clared elected at that time,”

The by_»law was deieated
chieily because many senators
telt that the whole issue of
class elections was too impor-
tant to issue single by-laws on

. Therefore, even as Miss Tay-l
lois b .1aw was voted down,
another motion made by her
was passed almost unaliimously.‘
This motion was: “that a come
mittee be created by the Speak—
er of the Senate to deﬁne the
position of class officers in SGA‘
and to present by—laws deter-
mining their duties. qualiﬁca—
tions, rights. privileges and the
procedure for their election."

The lay-law proposed liy Miss E

Taylor was the only motion
deieated during the entire—
Sonate meeting. others which
were passed were:

“That the Senate approve the
Executive Cabinet's appointment‘
of David Kennedy to the facul-
ty-student committee of the Pi-o—‘
grain in Practical Political Edu-
Catioll;“ I

“That. the Senate approve the.
appointment OI Nancy Lee Noi»
ton to the Freshman oi-ientationi
Commission,”

“That membership of the
Freshman Orientation
sion be expanded to include the
president and viceepresident ot.
the freshman Class;” I

"That SGA send one delegate
to the Peace Corps eonterence
in Kansas City on October 9 and
lo, and that this delegate he
chosen by Dan Figgins” (Figginsl
is president or the International
Relations Club and was a tormei
national alrairs vicerpl'esident of
the Collegiate Council or the
United Nations); '

"That SGA allocate $42 train

send the rodeo Corps cmlicr- .
cnte delegate to Kansas City;"
