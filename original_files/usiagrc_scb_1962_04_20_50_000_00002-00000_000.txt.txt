. A Tribute

Actualizing’ a new, l'al' from perfect constitution is
no easy task. inevitably the bulk ol' the burden fell upon

the shoulders of Bill Halanla and Cameron llendersliot.

With the help of tlle other Executive Cabinet members
the two managed to get the new macllille running, despite

l‘v‘lechanical confusion and constitutional vagueness

Early in the first year smooth operation was at times
inhibited by tile open rift between the Student Body

President and the Speaker of the Senate, Over time the
personality and poLicy gap closed and effective coopera-
tion followed.

While Hendershot helped to fulfill the new governr
.cJent’s need for constitutional and procedural self-dis-
cipline, Halahla provided the equally important demand
for spontaneity and flexibility.

Agreement between the two was strong- regarding the
proper role of student government. Both held that stu-
dents ought to concern themselves with crucial public is-
sues ol' the day. Not only did this policy confront the
campus with major social issues, but it also minimized the
tendency of campus government to consume itself on
“domestic” trivia.

The new SGA President and Speaker have much to
live up to. Both Halama and Hendershot have demon-
strated remarkable political courage. At times each has
taken unpopular stands and faced the consequences. The
lndny hours both gave testifies to the fact that each took
his responsibilities seriously. Both have often worked
twenty-five to thirty ho'urs a week to adequately meet
their obligations.

It the new leaders assume their responsibilities with
the same degree of commitment as the Halama-Hender-
shot team and show the same strength of conviction, SGA
should accomplish much iii its second year.

Our Code Too

In July of 1961, a code of ethics of the student press
was recommended by the 10th International Student Press
Conference in Rome. The Scarlet and Black subscribes to
that code which is reprinted below:

“This International Student Press Conference, believ—

ing that all student publications throughout the world
should respect the basic principles of human rights and
that they should maintain good quality workmanship and
a. high standa'd of conduct, recommends the following
Code 01' Ethics for observance by student journalists:
Tile student journalist should strive continuously to
be unbiased and accurate in his reports and should
equip himself adequately with facts to support his
published statements. He should fully realize his pe -
sollal responsibility for everything he submits for
publication.
The student journalist should reveal his identity as
a representat 'e of the student press bet‘ore obtailr
ing’any interview for publication.
The editor should not exclude a student point of
view solely because it is contrary to the editorial
policy,
The editor should apolo 'ze in print at the first
available opportunity for all mistakes.
A strident journalist should defend freedom through
the honest collection and publication of news and
facts and through the right of fair comment and
criticism.
A student journalist should respect all confidences
regarding sources of information aild private docu-
ments. He should not falsify information of docur
nlents or distort or 'misrepresent the facts.
Student journalists should be familiar with the laws
01' libel and contempt of court which e ist ill their
country and should observe the international copy-
right agreement—unless this interferes witll the
freedom of the press or the need to inform the pub,
lic on vital matters. Every effort should be made
to retain the independence of all student publications
from public relations, censorship, pressure or undue
influence from any outside body, political, govern-
mental, religious organizations or universities

Mr. iSnluckev (author or the
edilorial) inlsilltel‘prets Justice
Holmes’ neaning‘ when he quotes
the jurist's phrases. Smucker
says, “There are circumstances
in which . . . a communist par-
ty might constitute a ‘clcar and
present danger; ‘but that tune is
not: now."

Juslice Holmes did not mean
that circumstances alone created
a clear and present danger, but
rather that words could hclp
create the danger. 1 quote from
his statement in Schenk v. the
United States: “The question in
every case is whether the words
used are used in such circum-
stances and am of such :i nature
as to create a clear and present
danger that they will bring
about substantive evils that (the
state) has a right to prevent."

Communist Party uses is “of
such a nature" as to create the
danger l5 selfrcvldent; wliclher

Judy Darrh's work ‘appealing,

by Larry Homolka

Currently on exhibition in the
Main Hall foyer is a collection
of 15 paintings and prints by
Judy Du Though perhaps
lacking in niaiui-iiy and depth,
Miss Darrh's work is imniedr
ialcly pleasing in a direct and
unnretentious way.

The source of this immediate
appeal hes in her excellent sense
of design and uninhibited use of

A number of the paintings

dining room together to eat. I
had forgotten that it was Fri-
day night. But there would've
been no reason to worry. Mr.
Weaver enjoyed every minute
of it.

that of a child. Ancl the songs!
He loved all or then-i “They’re
my favorites," he cried ecsta-
ticnlly. “Why it’s just like :i

I began to say, “But it‘s not
supposed to be a summer
camp!" But I caught myself in
time, for it suddenly struck
me that there is nothing really
wrong wilh summer camps.
