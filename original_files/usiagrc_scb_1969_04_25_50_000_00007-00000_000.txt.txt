THE NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

is the senior college of the New School tor Social Research. an urban university
located in Greenwich village with all of New York city tor its camptis. There
_are three main New School units. One is the Graduate Faculty. at leading center
in the SocialScicnces that otters training to 2 40K! masters and doctoral \tudents
under scholars like Economist Robert Heill’aroncr. Pclltlcal Scientist Saul x.
Padover, and Philosopher Hannah Arendt. A second is the New School evcni g
division. which provides a vast range of courses. workshops, and lectures tor
some 12.000 New Yorkers annually. and serves as a maior cultural center tor the community-at-
laree with programs of concerts, ﬁlms, modern dance and art exhibitions. The newest unit is the

NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

an undergraduate program, limited In 500 students. The College otters a tworyesr program ior
students who have already completed their sophomore year elsewhere. and who are interested in
earning their BA. with emphasis in humanities or social science, in a program which considers

undergraduate education important in itself.

instead of lectures. every class in the College is designed as n seminar, with about twenty students
sitting around a table to learn through participatory discussion. instead or textbooks. the student
rontronts the actual works produced by great minds of the past and the present—Aristotle and
Sartre. Freud and Eriksont Sophocles and Pintera Marx and Marctise. Shakespeare and Picasso.
Joyce and Antonioni. antead ct requiring its teachers to engage in specialized research and publi-
cation, the College has a taculty whose primary eommltment is to teaching. and it trees them lrom
extrinsic demands so that they can concentrate their talents on the instructional program. instead
or taking a collection of unrelated courses, stttdents take a Divisional programea set ot courses
designed by the laculty to ﬁt together into a total educational experience, And instead or a t‘ iior."
each student pursues his own Individual Study Program in which he investigates. in con derable

depth and over a two- -year period a problem of his own choosing under the guidance ota

tutor.

The student. takes three year- 10 1; courses during his first year and two year- long courses during

his second. Thi

onstitutcs his Divisional Program. The rest of his time is spent in individual Stud-

ies. which he initiates during his first year and pursues tor halt oi_nis time during his second year.

THE DIVISIONAL PROGRA . Unlike most
colleges. we are not divided into specialized
departments like English History, or Psychol-
ogyi We have only two Visions—the Humani-
ties and the Social Sciences. The entering
student normally elects to study in either the
humanities or the social sciences. but may
choose to work in both.

The Signiﬁcance uf this unorthodox Divi-
Iiondl structure is twotold. It means that the
student takes courses at an advanced level that
are genuinely interdisciplinary rather than nar-
rowly spectallzed. And it means that the student
is free. in the Individual Study portion of his
vrogram. to investigate a problem that deﬁes
the boundaries or conventional departments,
perhaps cittting across philosophy and drama.
orpsychology and economics.

THE HUMANITIFS: The humanities com-
prise all the creations of man—in music, paint-
ing, and literature. in history, science. and
philosophy. Yet at most colleges. a student who
wishcs to study these creations at an advanced
level must limit hinrselt arbitrarily to the study
or a single kind. and even to a single country
or period. There is no “department" at most
colleges that will allow him to major in both
Thomas Mann and Dostoyevskyi bolh Pinter
and Proust. And even when he lirntts his study
to one of these ﬁgurex. the intellectual tools
lhat he requires for exploring the ideas ot that
writer in depth can only be acquired by taking
courses in sull other departmentsepnilosophy
or theology or psychology. Simtlarly. a student
who majors in the conventional Philosophy de-
partment cannot develop. within his specialized
courses, the aesthetic sensitivity that he need:
to penetrate fully the philosophy of thinkers
such as Plato and Nietzsche and Heidegger.
whose philosophic visions are expressed by
means ot image. myth. and dramatic action no
less than by rational discourse. It is for these
reasons that our study of the humanities is inn
terdisciplinary rather than tragrncnted tntri de-
partmental "maiors."

We have designed a set of courses that ﬁt
together into a comprehensive iniestigation oi
the creations ot man. It is possible tor us in
a single course to iuxta‘pose a treatise by Kant,
a novel by Earth and a movie by Godard in
order to deal fully with the problem under lvt-
vestigalion. The emphasis is less on assembling
intornralton about particular works than on
discovering the methods of understanding and
apprectatton that can he applied to rriiy‘workr
The goal is to provide tools of analysts that
will extend the student‘s insight into the hue
manitics when he pursues his own individual
Study.

Till: SOCIAL SCTENCES: The most worth-
while research in the social sciences tends to
involve two or more special s simultaneously.

Little Success

Last Saturday the Grinnell
baseball team defeated Cue at
Cedar Rapids by scores of 4 to
1 (in ten innings) and 4 to 3.

by the pitching of Scott Hanson

before, Grinnell had lost to
Cornell at Mount Vernon in a
game which was nip and tuck
until an eight run rally in the
sixth inning knocked Grinnell

box. Saddling him with the loss.
