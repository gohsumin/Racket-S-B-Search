LBurma and Wall Discuss Rights Bill

The main features and the
political problems of the Civil
Rights package' bill which was
passed by the House of Repre-
sentatives Monday were out
lined and discussed in a coffee

hour Tuesday afternoon in
Xounker L o u n g e. Featured
speakers about the bill were
Dr. John l-L Burma (Sociology)
and Dr. Joseph F. wall (His-
tory).

Burma started the discussion
with a factual report on the bill
as passed by the House, He
listed the major areas covered
by the bill and their provisionsi

l) DESEGREGATION OF
SCHOOLS: The bill proposes a
fact finding committee to de-
termine the actual situation,
the possibility of the federal
government ﬁling suit in cases
where individuals are not finan-
cially able to do so, and federal
funds being granted to inte<
grated schools from which
state governments have with-
drawn funds on the basis of
their integration.

2) VOTING RIGHTS: The bill
proposes a bar on discrimina-
tion in registration and voting
in federal elections, specifically
in the tests given as a prere-
quisite for registration and lit-

eracy tests; it also makes a
provision for three judges in
cases brought to the courts
This would prevent local prej-
udices of one judge and tend to
move the case faster. ‘

3) PUBLIC ACCOMMODA-
TIONS: The bill would prohibit
discrimination in those accom-
modations tied to interstate
transportation—hotels, motels,
restaurants, and probably fill-
ing stations, theaters, and re-
tail stores,

4) PUBLIC FACILITIES:
(facilities maintained by a gov-
ernment unit) The bill would
permit the attorney general to
intervene and take the financial
burden in court action,

5) FEDERAL AGENCIES:
The bill. would permit the use
of agency funds, with presi-
dential approval, for attempts
to end discrimination.

6) EMPLOYMENT: The bill
would in essence establish a
federal fair employment prac-
tices commission. lt,would also
outlaw employment discrimina-
ation because of “race, religion,
national origin, or sex," thus es-
tablishing a legislative base for
equal opportunities for women.

Burma further explained that
the bill would establish a com-
munity relations agency, a fact

 

finding and technical assist-
ance service. It would also ex-
tend the Civil Rights Commis-
sion for another four years.

Dr. Wall, in discussing the
problems the bill faces in the
Senate, said, “I'm not nearly
so pessimistic about the bill's
chances as I was a few weeks
ago. Even so, it’s going to be
very tough, and I don’t want to
paint an overly optimistic pic-
ture."

“There are two factors work-
ing for us in forcing a favor-
able Senate vote," Wall said:

1) “The ironic and tragic
death of President Kennedy has
undoubtedly contributed to the
success of the measure" by
changing the political align-
ment of some Republicans with
the liberal Democrats.

2! The Conservatives made a
tactical error in invoking clo-
ture in the liberal filibuster last
year on the American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company
satellite bill. Wall explained
that pressure to vote [or clo-
ture can be brought on those
conservative senators who
voted for it at that time,

He said that there is “no
question at all that President
Johnson will be happy to sign

A Gospel group, the Staples Singers, left, will give a concert
tomoriow in Darby gymnasium at 3:30 pm.

This family from Chicago began singing at home for fun.
Roebuck Staples, father of the group, accompanied them on the
guitar. Soon they were performing at local churches. In the 1950‘s
they organized professionally and toured the continent, singing at
churches, concert halls, colleges, and music festivals.

Two years ago the Staples Singers were selected ”New Star"
vocal group in Down Beat magazine‘s International Jazz Critics
Poll, the first time a Gospel group has received this award.

The group has not tried to discard the old spiritual and hymn
singing styles in an attempt to give their singing a more modern
sound, as have a number of others in Gospel music. Instead, the
Staples have chosen to ignore present trends, relying on the per-
manent appeal of traditional Negro folk music — songs of life,
hardship and happiness, songs of the common man and his faith
in himself, his people and his God.
