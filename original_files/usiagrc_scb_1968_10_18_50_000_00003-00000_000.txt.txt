PROPOSED WOMEN'S GYMNASIUM

Through the generosity of
Miss Carrie Rand, the women's
gymnasium. which has been
planned for some time. will be
built the coming season. A
considerable sum had already
been raised for this purpose,
but not enough had been
pledged to assure the building,
and Miss Rand Voluntarily
pledged the entire sum neces-
sary, stipulating only that she
be permitted to name the build-
ing “The E. D. Rand Gymna-

sium," as a memorial to her,

father and brother, who bore
the same name.

The plans will undoubtedly
follow those drawn up three
years ago by Mr. H. K. Hois-
man '91, of Chicago. This de-
sign calls for a building of
one hundred by forty-eight feet.
The first floor will contain Miss
R a n d ' I offices, gymnasium

Wilson Wins In
Student Ballot

Women's Votes Loses

Woodrow Wilson. Democratic
nominee for president, was
elected in the presidential
straw vote conducted by the
Scarlet and Black. The Victory
for Wilson was clear cut as he
received a comtortahle major-
ity over all the votes cast. Col-
onel Roosevelt was the second
choice and his support from
the men was even larger than
was expected by the enthusias-
tic Bull Moosers, Woman's
rights went down to sad defeat
by merely one vote and this
blow was dealt by the women
themselves, too.

Prof. Smiley Urge:
Work in Greek

Grinnell’s indifference to the
good which may be obtained
from the study of Greek was
Professor Smiley'e theme in
chapel Tuesday. In every line
of activity we find that the\
Gieek- has something which
is still an authority on the
subject, and yet less than five
per cent of the Grinnelliant
consider It Worth while to {it
themselves for the study of
these masterpieces.

Faculty Ballot Is
In Wilson’s Favor;

Pres. Maln‘to Voto
' For Roosevelt

September 21, 1917.

in a straw ballot, conducted
yesterday by the Scarlet and
Black among . the Faculty
members, Wilson d e l e B t 9 l1
Roosevelt for president by one
vote while President Taft found
but one supporter. The result of
ot the ballot of the legal voters
gave Wilson fourteen, Roose-
velt thirteen, Tait one and sev-
en members were either unde-
cided at this time or did not
care to commit themselves. . r .

The significant fact of the
whole census of political thought
among the professors is the
overwhelming progressiveness
of thelr beliefs. All those Voting
for both Wilson and Roosevelt
call themselves progressive,
and without single exception
the non-committal: declared
themselves in favor of progres-
sive principles,

Among the followers of tho
Bull Moose party there are
many tamer Republicans and
their reasons for their change
of political affiliation are three-
fold:

Dissatisfaction with President
Tait; disgust with the action
oi the Chicago convention; a
conviction that the Progressive
platform is based upon true re-
form motives.

President Main in explaining
his vote for President said, “It
I could VDtO for an individual
i should vote for Mr. Wilson;
as it is, 1 shall probably vote
the Roosevelt ticket. But I
would not do that if i were
voting for Roosevelt as an in-
dividual." The Chief interest
President Main has in the third
party is to knock out the ma-
chine meihod of politics and
thus give the people a new grip
upon their government. if the
mass of people could once real-
ize this, Mr. Main thinks the
Progressive party would poll 3
land-slide vote.

Study indicates
Duties of Deans
Are lndefinable

By CONNIE ERICSON

Although the duties of the ltih
dent deans and the provost and
dean of the college are clean
enough to the deans themselveii
and satisfactorily conjectured
by some at the students. the
actual functions oi the three
are indeflnable—if not inexpll-
cable—and unfamiliar to most
students.

Dean Alice 0. Low, in chergl
of residences, and Dean S, Eu-
gene Thompson, ln charge of
uilderclass advising, function ’
"almost like it central coordla
nating office.” said Dean Low.
Despite the overlap of the ace:
demic and social areas of .3,
student's life and the import-
tance of one to the other, the
student deans emphasise the
non-academic side of student
life through their counseling and
active participation in student
affairs.

Because Grinnell has the pro-
blems of a residential college
and a college in which impor-
tant policy changes are formu-
lated by arbitration rather than
by administrative authoritar-
ianism, the so-called “power"
of the deans is complicated and
the “definable" functions Vague.
Their daily agenda is varied and
the pressing issues unpredict-
able. Problems of dormitory
living are worked on constantly,
according to Dean Low. as an
a few other issues, but all-came
pus issues such as the current
debate on home rule and open
dorms change from year to
year. The resolution, however.
of such problems is never com-
plete but “problems are not
dismissed or considered unreal
just because they cannot be re<
solved," explained Dean Thomp-
son.

The case for student selfe
determination is not only re-
cognized by the upper echelons
of the college but is being
worked toward particularly by
the institution of the resident
advisor system, stated Dean
Low. "We ate trying to find
a better way of establishing
student responsibility so that as
changes are made they are
made with a grassroots kind of
structure."

Student responsibility, student
maturity, and student powen
are battiecries The real ques-
tion is who is responsible to
whom, why, and who is power-
ful to what ends," Deau Thomp.
son said.

The position of the provost and
dean, SCI-Called because Dean
James H. Stausa administers in
financial as well as traditional
academic planning areas, is
varied but easier to define. He
has overall supervision for the
budget for current operations,
academic planning and develop-
ment, faculty affairs relating
to hiring, and certain ottices
and activities, e.g., Library,
Admissions, Registrar, Place-
ment and Student Aid, Corn-
puter Services, Service Bureau,
academic advising, and educae
tional research. Dean Stauss is
also chairman of the Committee
on Academic Standing, which
is primarily responsible to:
the decisions on student ra<
quests to carry more than the
18 credit-hour limits
