English Dep’r.
Will Revamp

Senior Comps

The Grinnell English depart-
ment has disclosed some changes
in the pattern or comprehensive
examinations tor majors in that
department,
According
ment by
chairman

to an announce
Sheldon P. Zitiier,
or the department,
these changes will not affect
current senior majors in any
way. Majors who are now jun~
iors will have the choice of
proceeding under the old plan
or comprehensive examinations
or under the new setup.

All students majoring in
either literature or journalism
will take a common examination
on 21 announced texts. Journal-
ism students will, in addition
to this exam, write two exams
in journalism.

Literature maiors will be
examined on two topics chosen
irom lists established by the
English department. These stus
dents must declare the topics
upon which they are to be ex-
amined not later than the begins
ning of the second semester oi
their junior year.

The department feels that
this new pattern of comprehen—
sive exams will help promote
the studentsl mastery of the
chronicle or literature and pre-
vent the development of pre—
mature specialization.
