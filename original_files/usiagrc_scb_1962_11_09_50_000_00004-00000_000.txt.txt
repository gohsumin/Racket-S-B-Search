Art lecturer longman discusses l
three basic trends in modern art lat do”; n;

By Mary Gwynne—Vaughan
5&8 Start Writer

Dr. Lester D. Longinan oi the
University of California at Los
Angeles, lectured Tuesday eve-
ning in Roberts theatre on “The
Causes of Recent Trends in Art..”i
Dr. Longman is a graduate ofl
Oberlin College and has done
graduate work at Princeton. He
has studied under the Carnegie
foundation and has headed the
art department at the Unll‘el'r
sity of lowa. .

There are three basic move-
ments of art, says Longinan: the
abstract expressionism, the art,
of the contemporary image andl
the neordada gesture, ,

Art of the abstract expres» é

sionis class includes such works l

as would result from putting

paint on the bottom of auto
mobile tires or putting paint

on the soles of shoes. Such a i

work can be termed a ”life- 3

less document or a moment of

real living."

Art of the contemporary image
stresses the gruesome and more
bid. One such obiect “Woman_
out of Fire” is made of rooting,
cement, Longman says, howevem
that a certain charm can be de
tected in the horrible. I

THE PRINCIPLE of neo—dada

as rusty forks and spoons or the
arms and legs ot dolls are often
used in works of this kind.

Such recent trends in art are
overrated says Longman. The
first of his objections to these
trends is the element of con—
formity. Just as beatniks choose
to rebell in the same manner; so
artists rebell in the same man-
ner. “If an artist wants to get
anywhere, he has to fit into
these particular
states Longman,

Second. he finds iaults with
the fact that there is a move—
ment in only one direction:
leaving out what used to be
included. Progress has meant
leaving more things out, This
hogan by leaving out the sub-
ject matter and it has even
gone so far as to leave out the
(mm or the title. The pro»
lem is that if one urges put-
ting more into the work, he is
considered reactionary.

Third. Longman questions a
tendency to reductionism which
he terms a “nothingsbut princi—
ple.” This tendency reduces all

personality to its smallest come
