Brechi's 'The Measure Takenl
scheduled for rebroadcas’ring

by Ray Obstfeld

Bertolt Bl'eclit’s play, “The
Measures Taken,” was broad-
cast on Feb. 18, in an adaption
for radio by Samuel Schuman.
The play, ivhich is scheduled for
rebroadcast this Sunday over
KGRN (650 and 680) at 4:30
pm, is both a technical and
dramatic achievement.

it is the story of a young
Communist agitator before the
Chinese revolution who places
her humanistic ideals above the
workings of the party,

As a part of a mission assign-
. ed to foment rebellion, she
finds herself caught in the con-
flict of what she feels is right
as a human being and what the
party expects of her. Her dilem-
ma is in the end a fatal one.

As the hard core Communist.
and in several other smaller-
roles, Ann Fetter delivers an
excellent performance. Her
voice, and in a radio play the
voices assume even more im»
portance than on stage, carries
the ring of cold steel necessary
for the part.

Barbara Breckenridge,‘ as

 

conflict within her movingly
and does complete justice to ll
difficult. role.

Leigh Tracy, as the Contra

Fades’ dilemma, and like
questions which both Clarify the
play and stimulate the listen-

er.

His performance, as one_has
come to expect from him, is a
polished one. Alice Allen and
Mark Ferdinand, as 'the other
two agitators, both turn in com.
petent performances, though I'm
not Sure that Miss Allen’s voice
is entirely suited to the role.

The technical part of the prev
duction is superb. The difficulr
ties of editing. adding musical
background and adjusting voice
level have all been handled ad~
mirably by James Wilcox.

Samuel Schuman's direction
is excellent; he sustains the
movement of the play despite
the fact that it was originally

. meant for stage production.

As a “first” at Gl‘inncll “The
Measures Taken" is El welcome

'Three Experimental Plays done with finesse'

by Alvnh Stanley

On Feb 18 and 19 the Gl-ins
nell theater presented “ancc‘
Experimental Plays” in the Hal—
lie Flanagan Arena theater. The
program consisted of three short
plays—Garcie Lorcals “The Love
ot Don Pel'limplm and Delisa in
the Garden,” August Strinde
bergs “The Stranger” and a

alumna,

The plays were done with a'
good deal or imagination and
finesse; the only complaint might
be that the program represents
the only bill of one—act plays

scheduled in the Arena this sear
son.

It has only been Within the
past. few years that the one-act.
has come into its own as a ser—
ious dramatic form. The selecc
tion of the plays presented, and
especially the Lorca, bear out
the claim that the short play is

 

Campus Inquirer

Five Grinnell students werel
asked- What is your feeling an

lbout the fact that there will be

not to be passed over lightly.

“Don Perlimplin" presents
many interesting and exciting
problems both to the interpre—
ter and the audience. Many of
the problems arise from the
fact that the play is more of
a multiwoiced poem than it
is a clearly defined drama.

The effect and power that the
play attains come more from its
vivid imagery and the sheer
beauty of its words than from
the inclusion of the usual dra-
matic functions—character, plot,
and action, it is constructed with
the sort of precision and econo-
my that is more often asomatr
ed with non-dramatic poetic
forms.

The problem for the actor be.
comes one of giving “flesh and
blood” to a construction of po-
etic metaphors, and the prob»
lem of the audience becomes
one of abandoning preconcepr
tions and allowing the play to
operate on its own grounds. in
both instances the problems
were successfully solved.

Miss Petersllie's play presents
‘othel‘ problems. She has wiitten
a vignette which might be sev-
erely critized if judged as a
drama Takcn, however, as the
dramatic presentation of simple
experience—2i moment snatched
from time and held for exam-
ination—it can hold a good deal
.of charm. The play has little or
no action. The production of it
must therefore rest on sharply

defined and sufﬁciently detail-
ed characterization.

It is the simple story or two
particular people who are
thrown into a particular cir—
cumstance. To ask more of the
script would be a mistake,
especially since it succeeds so
well in its own right.

“The Stronger” seems to be
the least praiseworthy of the
plays which were chosen for
production. Although it is an in.
eresting piece for the student
of Strindberg and a worth—while
exercise for the actor. the tale
it has to tell is an old one and
its style is a bit stiff for modern
audiences.
