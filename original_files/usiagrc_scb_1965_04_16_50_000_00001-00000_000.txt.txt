partiCipants,

In a recent report to the campus,
the Grinnell Committee on Viet
Nam noted, “in View of President
Johnson’s recent statement that
the U.S. is ready and Willing to
negotiate at this time, this march
has become a march of support for
successful negotiations as well as

.a protest against the escalation of
the war in Viet Nam."

Tile students had varied motives
tor going,

“There's something to be said
for commitment for its own sake,"
Said Steve Woolpert. who admitted
that the reason he was going was
“mostly curiosuy,”

Terry Scott. who lives in Wash-
ington and who is providing a place
for the students to stay, is taking
this chance to get home to look
for a summer job as well as dem-
onstrate.

When asked why she was pro-
testing, Muttie Meyer said that
she was protesting the war in Viet
Nam but that the “war represents

Burma Speaks at Fourth Race Dinner,
Claims Preiudice Normal, Not Abnormal

By Pam Clay

Discrimination and prejudice
are normal rather than abnor-
mal patterns, said John Burma
(sociology) at Tuesday night's
dinner sponsored by the Board
of Religion. The dinner was
the fourth in a series designed
to educate participants on var-
ious aspects of the race prob-
lem.

“We usually do not get our
negative attitude by bad expe-
riences with a group," Burma
said. “We learn our attitudes
and values as a child, by the
tones of yoice, gestures, and

just by how things are said."

He explained that one cause
of discrimination and prejudice
in the South is that one natural-
ly fits into the normal cultural
pattern of the society of which
he is a part. A Southern child
is surrounded by only one set
of attitudes, values and be-
haviors. He is given no choice.
He necessarily accepts what is
available.

Advisory Council Holds Firsi Session;
Off-Campus Living, Budget Discussed

By Ted Lemaire

At the tirst meeting of the
Advisory Council last Wednes-
day a resolution supporting off-
campus housing for men and
upper-class women was passed.
The council also favored keep-

ing Grinnell House open
Sue Taylor. last year's SGA

treasurer. estimated that the

student government will be in
the red at the end of the cur-
rent academic year if expendi-
tures are made as budgeted.

A motion was passed provid-
ing that no picture contracts
would be signed with the Cy-
clone until the problem is
Studied. SGA owes the Cyclone
$9150 for pictures.

Also discussed was a sugges-
tion by Nord Brue to look into
the purchase of a new bus for
c a m p u s organizations, resi-
dence halls, athletic teams, and
long distance trips during va-
cations. Such an arrangement,
it was thought. would free the
college wagons for more exten-
sive use by individual students.

SGA President Jerry Goddard

reported that a proposal by the
executive cabinet which would
have eliminated payment of
damage bills from the hall so-
cial funds was turned down by
Acting President James Stauss.
The proposal provided that
when a hall was charged for
damages which it could not at-
tribute to an individual, it
would ”pass the hat.” If this
method of collection failed,
after thirty days the bill would
be taken to the treasurer’s of-
fice. where each member of
the hall would be assessed his
equal share. Goddard said that
Stauss's objection Cited irregu-
larities which would have been
caused in the Treasurer's of.
fice. The executive cabinet
will cenn'nue discussion of the
problem.

Other subjects discussed and
favored by Goddard were an
encampment at the beginning
of next September. an informal
party for last year’s CofHP, a
continuation of the book coop,
and a drive this spring for the
return of borrowed books to
the library.

 

Siauss: Prof
For Russian

An assistant professor oi
Russian has been hired by the
college to bring the Russian de-
partment back to full strength
in September, Acting President
James Stauss announced this
week.

Richard R. Sheldon of the
University of Michigan will
teach at least first year
courses. Second year offering:
will depend on enrollment.

The college did not hire a
Russian language professor this
year. In other years, Beth
Noble (Spanish) has taught
first year Russian, but this year
she has taught only Russian
literature courses,

In the some interview Stauss
discussed the proposed new
women’s dormitory. “The de-_
sign and location of a new resi-
dence hall for women is under
consideration, and the proba<
bility is that the building will
be approved. If it is approved
the expectation is that it will
be open for occupancy in Sep«
tember. 1966,” he said,

Stouss noted that the question
of continuing the Junior Liber~
al Arts examination was
brought up in this week‘s fac-
ulty meeting and will be dis-
cussed further at next week's
meeting.

He also said that the faculty
had okayed a proposal that
spells out circumstances in
which a student may defer His
torical Studies I to the second
semester of his sophomore
year.

 

leMoyne Presidenl Looks ai Exchange Program

lems of urbanization." stated

problem” community. “I don’t
mean to imply that Grinneil has
no problems." he said, ”but it
has none of the social problems
tound in today’s large urban
centers. It seems almost the
ideal community." By spending
a semester at LeMoyne, which
is located in Memphis, Tenn.

of the problems he will too.
