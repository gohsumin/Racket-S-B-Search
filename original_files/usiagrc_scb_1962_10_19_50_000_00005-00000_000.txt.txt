Disarm opponents peacefully
urges Martin Luther King at Coe

By Phil Bernstein
S to E Stat: Writer

Tuesday, the ‘Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King spoke at a meeting
ot the Committee on Human
Relations of Cedar Rapids held
at the Geo College auditorium.
Dr, King is president or the
Southern Christian Leadership
Contcrencc and is recognized as
one of today's great leaders in
the ﬁght for racial equality in
America.

In his speech, Dr. King noted
that as Atricari and Asian na—
tions gain their independence,
they make it clear that they
won't accept a nation that Segrer
gates a segment of its population
along lines of color or race.

Talking with African lendr—
ers, he has become convinced
that the United States must
desegregate or face the pros-
pect ot heing demoted to the
status of a second rate powerr
fte emphasized, however, tirat
“this problem (segregation)
must be solved not only he.
cause it is diplomatically exe
pcdient hut because it is moi--
ally compelling"

Commenting on the situation
at ‘Ole Miss,” Dr King placed’
the blame for the present crisis
upon the power structure saying
no politicat,religiou or academic
leader took a pos' ve stand on
the issue before it was brought
to a head. He praised the stand
taken by the federal govern
merit as a very forthright one

IN THE EFFORT ot the Negro
to get equal rights, Di King is
a strong advocate of non—v olence'
which he claims “1 ayes the op—
ponent glutted wrth his own
harha 'ty’ He warned against

succumbing to the temptation ofl

using violent means on the
grounds this would arouse a
new hatred towards the Negro.

Though he denounced the
violence oriented Black Muslim
movement, he attacked the en-
vironmental conditions t h a t
spawned it as a worse detria
inent to the integration cause
than the movement itself. Lag-
ging standards in the Negro
community, he feels, can
laid directly at the feet ot seg-
regationr

In a qttcstionranswer period
following the lecture, Dr. King
supported the NAACP’s plan tor
achieving integration by
rather tedious means of court
litigations but. hastened to
that the success of the integt'zta

tion movement depended on the!
coordinated crforts of all groupsl

concerned.

WHEN ASKED about the ef-t
tects or church policy in the
South on the integration move-
ment he said that churches are
realizing the need for integration

he!

the l

add ‘

and have begun to uphold the
195-1 Supreme Court dcctston
and to condemn segregation. '

He made the observation,
houcver, that Sunday morning
in the South is still the most.
segregated time and place on
earth and expressed some at
pleasure at church policy {or
being what he termed “an echo‘
rather than a’ voice." t

DRo KING pointed out that.
an important result OI universal‘
Negro suftrage in the South will‘
be a liberalization of United
Statesvdomestic and foreign pols)
icy. This, he Said. will be accom
pllshcd when the Negro voter
helps to retire om oftice the
Southern D
ioi-ity in Congress enables them
to control many of the nation’s
policies,

Concluding. Dr. King reaffirms,
ed his faith that eventually sued
cess would be achieved in the
ﬁght for desegregation and aquull
rights
