ancient art of scli delcnse,
karate.

course which will meet on Fri-
day evenings The class will be
coeducational and will meet in
the Orchesis room ol the line

Young has been studying
karate for three years and has
reached the third rank or brown
belt. Belt color designates the
amount oi proliciency a person
has attained. The order or belt
ranking is white, green, blue,
brown and black, which is the
highest rating. Each belt cater
gory is in turn divided into
several i-‘ankings.

teaching and competing in
karate for the Hawaii Karate
Association. This is a branch ol
the Japan Karate Association.

The course will include some
iuiitsu. Young explains, “I have
found karate to be more eitcc.
livc in selfsclcfense, but there
are several things in jujiisu
which are also Valuable.”

The basic principle oi both
karate and ju tsu as Young
explains it is this: you strike
your opponent as he is about
to strike you. in this manner
the combatant can beat his
opponent to the punch as well
as attacking him while he is
all his guard and concentrat—
ing on his own attack.

The Grinnell soccer team
scored its second victory in two
starts last Friday by dcreating
Northern lllinois University one.

‘two goals each as the team

Flagucd by rather weak kick-

team from Delmlb, ‘11.. did,
ihowever. play a very scrappy
‘brand of soccer with the hard-
lest tackling that the Grinneil
lteam has yet experienced this
year.

cept of focusmg all the strength
of the body‘inlo a small area
such as the side of the hand or
the foot. It is this fucusilig of
power which enables a karate
expert to do the imports stunt
of slicing a board or brick into
two halves with his bare hands.

Young is quick to emphasize
that destroying bricks is not at
all a concern oi karate but
merely a demonstration oi the
cap-abilities of a karate trained
person,

THE SPORT of kaiatc is sim-
ilar to boxing with the addition
oi the use at feet. All blows and
hi E which normally would be
highly iniurious or iatal are
pulled belore contact is made,
The match is judged on the tech
mode and location ol the blows
made by each man.

Young plans to teach the
women karate as purely a means
at selfsdei‘ense, For the men,

t ) ;
however, he will go more into:
the sporting aspect oi it.

”When i iii-st started karate."‘
says Young, "I planned to work‘
up to the brown belt stage and‘
then I’d know enough to de-
ienol myself and I'd quit. But I
found out you never know
enough; ther is always some
one sinarte, So Young plans
to continue working and some-
day hopes to reach black belt
rank ,

FROM THIS desire to merely‘
learn sellsdel'ense through
karate, Young has developed an
interest in the whole Japanese
Civilualion. He says, “From
karate a person can learn about
Japanese ail, culture and relig-
ion." .

Young is now eyeing the pass
sibility of attending a karate
school in Japan while going to.
