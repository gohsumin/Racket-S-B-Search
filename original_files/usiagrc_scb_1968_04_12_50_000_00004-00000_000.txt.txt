Changes Finally Revealed

CURRICUlUM ALTERED TO FIT REPORT

By ADRlENNE LEMMONS
58x3 Staff Writer

After 5 e v er al months of
heated scrutiny, the faculty has
approved, with a few amend-
merits, nearly all of the rec<
ommendations submitted last
fall by the Committee on Edu-
cational Policy and Curriculum.

The report included changes
in course requirements, inde-
pendent study, and academic
credit for some activities now
considered extra-curricular.

Course requirements, accord-
ing to Joseph F. Wall (history),
Chairman of the Faculty, have
been altered along the lines
suggested in the curriculum re»
port. Beginning with 1968 in-
coming freshmen, students will
meet these requirements:

—Hulnanities I and II, fresh-
man year.

This course will attempt,
like the present Humanities
course, to teach techniques of
textual interpretation; the new
syllabus Will provide more study
at drama as a literary genre
and will probably include some
recent Works.

—Social Studies I and Il,

This is to be completed be
fore the end or the sophomore
year. Readings will cover
“classic texts in social thought,
including texts in philosophy,
religion, politics, economics, so-
ciology and anthropology."

The first semester, concen«
trating on periods ranging irom
classical Greece to the seven~
teenth century, will draw heav-
ily on philosophy, while the sec<
and semester, covering periods
from the French Revolution to
the present, will stress the so-
cial sciences. Emphasis will be
on intensive study at the ideas
and social issues of a new se-
lected periods rather than a
chronological survey of history.

—Sclence l and ii,

Which must be completed by
the end of the sophomore year.
The two courses will serve as
an introduction to biological
and physical sciences. Science
I is planned for the fall of

1968, with Science ll following
by spring ol 1969.

—Proﬁciency in a foreign
language equal to two years of
college study.

The present philosophy re-
quirement will remaln tor stu-
dents who have taken Histori-
cal Studies, but will not be
obligatory tor Social Studies stu-
dents.

The fate of Humanities Ill, 1:
course in music or visual arts
analogous to the present in-
troduction to Music and. intro-
duclion to Art courses, is still
undecided. A proposed change
would eliminate Introduction
to Theater as a means of
meeting the fine arts require-
ment, since Humanities I and
[I are expected to devote more
study to dramatic works.

To combat: a tendency to-
ward overspecialization, an up-
perclass general education re-
quirement has been approved.
Beginning with 1968.59 freshmen,
all students will be required
to take 16 hours either in a
special, nonrmajor program or
in electives outside the division
at the student's major, of which
at least two courses must be
Zoo-level or above.

Committees are being formed
to design special interdisciplin-
ary programs to fulfil this re-
quirement. Areas being con-
sidered include Religous Stud-
ies, Urban Studies, Internation-
al Studies, Communication Stud-
ies, and Studies in Philosophy
and Science.

In addition, 4 Credits of in-
dependent study will be re
quired (it all students begin-
ning with the graduating class
of 1972. Besides the present
2. and 4-credit independents, a
plan for course-related study is
being uttered, whereby a stu-
dent in a 4-hour course can
elect to pursue a 2-hour proj-
ect under the same teacher.
The 2- and 4-credit components
Will be graded separately, and
neither part can be taken cred-
itsfail.

Projects can be suggested
either by the instructor or by

WHERE ARE YOUR 127,000 CONSTITUENTS NOW?

(Editor‘s Note: while digging around the lie.
library at Berkeley, Ron Goodenow, '63, Grinnell's
West Coast Admissions Counselor, ran across this
item on i. o. Grinnell while doing research tor
his doctorate in the history oi education.)

In Febnlary, 1866, Grinncll, tllen serving in his second
term in the House oi Representatives, gave a speech on
the floor vehemently denouncing those Kentucky represen-
tatives who opposed the Freedmen's Bill, a proposal de-
signed to protect Southern Negroes from local violence and

discrimination.

A few months later, Representative Rousseau, one of
the Kentuckians against the bill, attacked Grinnell public—
ly in a New York speech, calling him a “pitiable politician
from lowa” who had departed so tar from “what every
body believes he ought to know and does know is the truth
that it is a degradation, not to his State, but to himself."

Grinnell shot back "When any man, I care not whether
he stands six feet high, whether he wears butt and carries
the air of a certain bird that has a more than usual ex~
tremity of tail, wanting in the other extremity — says that
he would not believe what 1 utter, I will say that l was
never born to stand under an imputatlctn of that sort."

Those were fighting words to the gentleman from Ken-

tucky. Three days later Rousseau approached Grinnell in
the east portico of the capitol and said, “I have waited
tour days tor an apology tor words spoken here upon this

floor.”

“What of that?” asked Mr. Grinnell,

“I Will teach you what of that," sold Rousseau, who
then proceeded to strike Grinnell about the head and shoul-
ders wltb a rattan cane, stopping occasionally to lecture

him in the following terms.

“Now, you d— puppy and poltroon, look at yourself."
Alter a few blows Grlnnell exclaimed, “I don't want to

hurt you."

“I don’t expect you to hurt me, you d—d Scoundrel,”
shouted Rousseau, “but you tried to injure me upon the
floor at the house, And now look at yoursell; whipped
here, whipped llke a dog, disgraced and degraded! Where
are your one hundred and twenty-seven thousand constitu-

ents now?"

Rousseau was later officially reprimanded by the
Speaker of the House. Several fellow Iowa Congressmen
presented Grinnell with a heavy cane made irom a bolt of
the historic Monitor so that he might protect himself from
further attacks. However, later that year Grinnell declined
to run for another term in the House.

LANGAN SWINE .
NATIONAL NEWS

Langan Hall's November pl
roast escapade made nations
news this month in Moderator
— “the national magazine for
leading students.”

“You’re not going to believe
this one," the magazine’s
“Grapeshot” column declared.
“The men of Langan Hall,
GRINNELL C 0 LL E G E, de‘
cided to hold a pig roast to
help raise funds for the cam-
pus charity iuod. They did it
the hard way.”

“Up early in the morning,
they went out and bought a
live pig,” the column con-
tinued, “hung it up in the dorm
shower to butcher it. Squeals
brought the director of resi-
dences, but too late."

“Grapeshot” is a column that
cites happenings at various
colleges and universities. The
column concluded with a con-
vetsation between the director
of residences and o Langan
freshman. Asked by the direc-
tor why the pig was slaughter-
ed in the shower. the lrosh re-
plied, "Where else, Mao
Field?"

In addition to picking up the
story or the Longan incident,
Moderator also attempted to
stereotype the Orinoco student
in its latest monthly issue:

“Ronald the Rad came to us
from progressive Summer Hill
High, where he called his pro—
iessors by their first names.
He has been all in favor of
ciVll rights, pot, socialism,
free love, and the rest of the
bag."

“His major is Russian,” the
Moderator description went on,
“the intorinal minor in drugs.
According to his application,
his grades are okay, but his
boards are better, which Ron
explains in a somewhat off-
hand manner, saying that
grades don’t matter, humanity
does.”

“That reminds us," the ar-
ticle concluded, “Where the
hell is Ronald?"

The computer, accordlng to
the magazine, would send him
— among other places — to
Grinnell College.

Other schools favorable to
the radical stereotype, accords
ing to the magazine, were Har-
vard, l-laveriord, Occidental,
Berkeley. and Claremont Men’l
College.
