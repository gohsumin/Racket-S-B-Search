Grinnell Prof's Son ls
Surgeon in Viet Nam

By Art Arnold

In South Viet Nam the hot
War burns itself into the side
or the entire population. Eighty
percent of battle casualties are
,civilians. In combat in part the
‘dire need for medical Care for
these wounded, the US Oper-
ations Mission maintains a hos-
pital in Can Tho, eighty miles
south of Saigon. One of the two
Surgeons working round the
clock at the hospital is Dr.
Robert Norton son of R. Homer
Norton (History). He has been
in Viet Nam since 1962 in the
midst of the fighting.

Can Tho itself is often a tar—
get for Viet Cong terrorists,
and Dr. Norton told Look Maga-
zine reporters_(Jan. 23, 1954),
"Sometimes an entire Village is
carried in at once. I‘m needed
here. I didn’t go into medicine
torstay in one part of the world

Iowans Competing
For Political Jobs

Competition has been opened
{or a program of undergraduate
internships with political can-
'dldates this summer, the Iowa
Center for Education in Poli-
tics announced in Iowa City
this week.

Up to eight fellowship grants
of $500 will be awarded, for a
two-month, full-time work ex-
perience with a political candi-
date or party headquarters in
Iowa.

Only students of sophomore,
junior, or senior standing who
are Iowa residents will be eligi-
ble for the awards, the ICEP
reports. Applicants are ex-
pected to be above average
lcholastically, have a sound
course basis, and present 9 rec-
ord of "active interest and par-
ticipation in the political party
of their choice. Each intern will
be asked to complete a re-
search project based on his in-
ternship, for academic credit.

Application forms are avail-
able from C. Edwin Gilmour
Director of the Program in
Practical Political Education,
In Room 207, Carnegie Hall, or
1mm his secretary. All appli-
cants must be received by the
ICE? by May 8.

 

and make money while people
on the other side bleed to
death."

Graduated in 1952 from Grin-
nell as a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Dr. Norton went to
Harvard Medical School, where
he was graduated in 1956, re-
turining to Des Moines for his

internship. After four years of

surgical residency, Dr. Norton
entered the US Public Health
Service and volunteered for his
present post. Dr. Norton. shows
his dedication in another Look
quotation: "We’re doing some-
thing vital here. Not just medi-
cally. When a Vietnamese, com-
ing out of shock, sees an Amer»
ican trying to save him the
‘Ugly American’ myth crumbles
a bit more."

As may be expected such a
hospital being a far cry from
its counterparts in the United
States, lacks sufficient facili—
ties. In a letter to the Grinnell
Junior Chamber of Commerce,
which is coordinating the Nor-
ton Fund Drive, Dr. Norton exl
plained some of the need. “We
have piped cold water only.
Our water supply is adequate
at the source but at present.
only the operating room and
the maternity ward have run-
ning water. . . . The means of
heating water is a problem
which I hope you will be able to
help us solve." However, his
biggest problem is linen. Only
postoperative beds have sheets,
and surgical drapes must be re-
used. “Our male and female ci-
vilian wards have no linen at
all. . . . The cots each have
from two to five patients on
them. . . . I do hope something
does come of this (the fund
drive) but I realize how large
an undertaking this is.”

The Norton Fund sponsored
by the Grinnell Ministerial As-
sociation with the Jr. Chamber
of Commerce has a goal of
$7500 to meet the acute need,
which also includes automatic
washers and dryers to aid in
the difficult job of cleaning
linen in such a humid climate.
The Board of Religion and IRC
are co - sponsors of a campus
collection to be taken tomcr»
row in the lunch lines. As Dr.
Norton said to Look, “Some
people back in the States do
nothing but rant about commu-
nism. In a way, we’re lucky
here. We can do something
about it.”

The smelter will be built and

ing Company and other Ameri-‘
can and European aluminum
interests. The New York

Times, January 20, 1964) In
spite of this obvious evidence
of private investment, the
January 9, 1964 issue of the Des
Moines Register accused Ghana
of waging “total war“ on capi-
talism. It should be noted in
answer to this attack that ac-
cording to the recent Capital
Investment Act, Ghana makes
generous concessions to private
investors. It has recently passed
legislation encouraging private
investment. Act 172 of the Ben-
efits Laws to Foreign Indus-
tries includes a tax “holiday"
of up to ten years and gener-
ous capital allowances for use
after the tax “holiday." The
Act includes deductions from
taxable income for scientific
research. It also provides‘ ex-
emption from indirect taxes for
certain projects such as those
which produce domestic goods
for export to replace imports.
It protects investments from
expropriation and allows the

free transfer abroad of the prof-
its after tax liabilities have
been satisfied. The government
recently abolished the law re-
quiring reinvestment of sixty
percent of all profits in Ghana.
This is the trend Which the Des
Moines Register of January 9,
1964, called the irreversible
trend toward a Marxist state.

6) Small-scale private capital
is included under the workers
sector of Ghana’s economy.
This segment includes private
ownership of small businesses
by shop owners, crop farmers,
tailors, and cloth weavers. A
Communist government would
not allow its subjects to partici-
pate so freely in a mixed econo-
my. The above sectors consti-
tute the economic aspects of
African socialism.

An eye-witness, St. Clair-
Drake of Chicago, made the
following remarks about Afri-
can socialism:

". . . African socialism in
Ghana is .what Nitrumah says
it is, not what Khrushchev or
Tito or Mao or Castro say it is.
There is no Commuinst party
in Ghana and the Convention
Peoples’ Party is not one of the
81 parties which make up the
international Communist move-
ment.

 

All Soviet satellites have his
dissoluable economic b o n d s
which tie them to the dominant:
country. Ghana has no such ties
with either the U. S. S. R. or

China. Less man 10 per cent of
her exports and imports in-
volve Communists, and the
bulk of Ghana’s valuable cocoa
crop is sold in the West.

Since 1960 Ghana has tried
to free herself from the risk of
chronic price fluctuation in the
West and a possibility of suffer-
ing from future depression by
cultivation trade ties with the
East to balance off those with‘
the West. Most of the capital
invested in these major devel«
opment projects is Western.

Canadians— not Rusisans—
are helping to train the armed
forces. and a medical team is
on the way from the United
States to organize a teaching
hospital. No “satellite” would
be allowed to absorb this much
Western technical and {inane
cial assistanCe. . ."

Ghana‘s political emancipas
tion would be meaningless un-
less it brings economic pros-
perity. To achieve this end.
Ghanaians choose, neither com-
munism nor Capitalism. but Af-
rican Socialism.
