mouth Scots could manage only . r . . ,
29 percent. Most of the night’s
damage was done in the first
half as the Pioneers racked up
a 49 to 36 half—tilne lead behind -
the shooting of Jim Mifflin and
Denny Asby.

Asby, playing his best game
of the year, led Grinneil With 22
markers. Mifflin made good use
of his patented, high altitude
jump-shots to finish with Zl
points.

Mell, the Conference's scoring
leader with a 27.4 per game
average, scored 32 points to
gain the evening‘s scoring hon-
015.

ser, the squad's most consistent
shooter With a 16.6 per game
average, scored 16 points before
fouling out. He ranks eighth in
Conference individual scoring.
Grinnell field general, Gar
Smith. the only Pioneer to play
the whole game, hit for 14 points. -
Big (6Y 7") John Sundell, a
promising sophomore, made ll
points and earned defensive hon-
ors by pulling 27 rebounds off
the boards.

George Gray, whose 16.1 per
game average ranks him tenth
in the Conference and Kent RD-
gerson each added seven points
to the victory.

The following night, Gray
singed the nets for 25 points,
22 in the first half, to pace the
Pioneer victory. Mussel- and
Miﬂlin hit for 1'1 apiece and
Asby added 13 to give the
squad a 33 per cent average

Knox hit 30 per cent of their
shots. Jeff Sandburg, who play-
ed with an injury-protecting
shoulder harness, and Kip Weld
