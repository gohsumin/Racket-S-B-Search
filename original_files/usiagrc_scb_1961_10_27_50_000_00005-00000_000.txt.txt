New Arts Center

An outstanding piece of cquip- ,

ment newly acquired by the Cole
legc is a pr-acti . pipe organ or
“Ha S Orgel". The instrument
has just been installed in the
college's new $1,400,000 Fine Arts
Center. which will be dedicated
this weekend,

Elbert Morse Smith, (modern
iorcign languages). College or.
ganist, explains that the instruc
ment is Called the “Haus Orgel”
01‘ house organ because its small
number or pipes and its com—
pactness make it ideal for res-
idence installation.

“The design and tonal qual-
ilies of the Haus Ol‘gel are
distinctly baroque, and similar-
to those of the small instruments
used in Europe during the time
\of Bach,” Smith said,

The console, or “key desk"
and the pipe case are char-
coal black to match the ﬂoors
and woodwork of the Fine
Arts Center. The keys of the
two manuals are of English
ivory.

The 280 varnished wood and
Silverccolol’ed metzil wines in
foul ranks are complctcly cxl
posed to view. They are gradu-
ated in size. l

Air for the pipes is provided
by a small Swiss blower locat—
ed on the floor directly beneath
the pipe rack Both the console
