Cafe de] F oro

For the past three weeks, Grinnell students have
been blessed with an opportunity for relaxing weekends
such as has long been lacking. Jon Stein’s coffee house
in the Forum, appropriately named Cafe del Fore,
has provided us with a Weinstube contrast to the
Bierstube atmosphere of the Forum Grill. It is quite
a pleasurable diversion from study to be able to sit
quietly, sipping cider or tea, and enjoy folk music
or other entertainment drawn from the plenitude of
talent available among the students of Grinnelli

Jon has worked a long time to make this coffee house
possible He was one of many students who were
disturbed that no use was being made of the excellent
facilities available'between the Grill and the South
Lounge and aware of the need for a quiet alternative
to the Grill. He did something about it. He has garnered
the best performers from among the students to provide
entertainment, and they are of such quality as to have
surprised many of the students who were unawa
that such talent existed at Grinnell. He has gone to
Des Moines and Chicago to provide fresh pastry, talked
students into baking cakes and made tea, cider, coffee
and espresso available, Yes, Shirley, you can even
buy lox and bagels with cream cheese at the Cafe del
Foro.

Attendance has been somewhat erratic. It is to be
expected that the cultural events of a Grinnell weekend
will draw a certain number of students who might
otherwise spend much of the evening at the coffee
house. But they have managed to pack the place several
times. Jon has promised us that he will try to opEn
the coffee house during the week and for longer hours
on the weekends if response continues to be good. We
hope it will.

If you didn’t know about the coffee house, or if you
just haven’t been there yet for some reason, try to
stop by this weekend. You might be surprised.

 

We have gotten several comments, some favorable,
some unfavorable, on our policy in the letters to the
editors column. Some people feel that we should devote
less space to letters and more to news, campus or
otherwise. We agree with those who are glad we are
providing a forum for members of the Grinnell College
community. We feel that in many cases the availability
of this forum is even more important than the limited
amount of news which a college paper this size can
provide. Oh those occasions when we do not publish
a letter you wrote, you can be sure that it was because
01 space limitations, and not because you disagreed
with us. This should be apparent from the letters in
today’s column. We edit this newspaper because we
feel strongly about campus issues. If you feel strongly
about campus issues, we want to give you a chance
to make your feelings known.

Letters to the Editor . . .

To the Editor:

Having just returned lroni a
trip to the East Coast, 1 was
distressed to read Bruce N issen's
letter in the Feb. 20 $528. I find
it astounding that Bruce
disclaims ever having said ”. .
we're working for a society that's‘
above tree'speech." So Bruce
calls me a liar for saying that
he did make the statement, and
I say Bruce is a liar for saying
that he didn’t, ‘

I also find it rather amazing
that Bruce should claim that I
”admitted that it wasn’t a
genuine quote.“ I never said any
such thing, least of all to Bruce
who has never even talked to me
about the matter. He would be
better oil not using secondhand
information from his girlfriend
Sally Hamann when engaging in
such personal attacks.

But all of this isn't really
getting to the heart of the issue.
Bruce might have much better
written a letter about just what
are his political views vissarvis
the free press. I find it most in»
tcrcsting that the Bruce Nissen
who claims he is a supporter of
Cuba's present policy oi lack of
freedom of the press is also the
Bruce Nisscn that writes the Ann
Arky columns which have up»
poured in Ptero and High and
Mighty. Anarchy on Monday,
tascisloianday?

And in the next issue of the
5&5 I note that Crossett has
joined in the fun. John now ac;
nepts the “tact” that I mis-quoted
Bruce, Now please, John, in the
name of better journalism ins
stead oi worse, you should have
checked with me before you said
that. Lets just call cach other
liars and immoral slohs and call
it a day Mankind has a long way

To The Editors:

In the traditionISM of the
greatEST negatiVISTS of our
generationISM, n. R. GrossIS’l‘,
Strom ThurmIST, and Shirley
Temple BlackIST, we encourage
the Grinnell student body to
support the 5&8. In last week’s
stirs the editors promised us that
their endorsement would be the
“kiss 0[ death” to any candidate.
We believed the editors because
everything they have condemned
this year has succeeded. For
example, last week the editors
recommended that the students
boycott the election. We can see
no other reason for the stu-
pendous turnout. This can lead
to only one conclusion. It the
editors really believed that their
support would constitute a kiss
of dcath then it would only seem
rutioiiaLthat they should have en-
dorsed all the candidates. Fora
tunalely. they acted irrationally
To paraphrase last week's
editorial' we do not intend to
impugn the characters oi the
editors. Nor do we believe that
this negativisin is necessarily
reprehensible, but we do believe
that irrational negativism cx-
crclcs something which isn’t the
product oi a maliunctioning
pituitary gland.

To The Editors:

We believe it necessary to
correct the ‘tacts’ and, perhaps
more importantly, the con-
jectures of last week‘s sou
editorial. It is unfortunate that
this seems to beawcekly chore.

First, although your financial
statistics are roughly accurate
(after all, you got them from us),
the context in which you place
them is highly misleading. You
ncglccted to mention the close to
200 copies we distributc ircc each
week, you ignored the [act that,

pending legal negotiations, we
had yet to claim the $50 allocated
by the Senate; and perhaps you
didn’t know that we give a
commission of 10 cents per copy
to all stores and non-staff
salesmen who distribute High
and Mighty.

Secondly, High and Mighty is
not a profit»making enterprise.
High and Mighty goes into debt
each issue and manages to repay
the debt only by selling copies
across the state, no simple task.
individual staff members pay the
bulk of each printing bill out of
their own pockets. So far, all of
these loans paid back by.
our offrcampus sales.

The iinancial goal or High and
Mighty is to raise enough capital
to pay each printing bill without
borrowing irom individuals. The
economists call this capital in-
vestment, not profit. In addition
we are trying to raise enough
money to subscribe to Liberation
News Service (the UPIVAP of
undergrounds), Underground
Press Service (an exchange
network with other papers), and
other syndicated items, hoping to
provide a better newspaper for
our readers.

In explaining your editorial,
You told us that all ol the above
may be true, but “if you stopped
publishing after any issue, you
would have a profit left over.”
on the contrary, all funds go
right back into production of the
paper and if any money is left
at the end of the year, we would
try to put out a free issue.

We would like to add a further
concerning the finances oi the
student Senate. Although it may
be true tllat, as the student
auditor stated, the Senate is flat
broke, the special Senate budget
is only one small part at the total
