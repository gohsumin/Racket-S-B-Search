Southeast Bottoms Project

Biscussed a

By BONNIE TINKER

At a conierence last Saturday
students from six lowa colleges
discussed the philosophy and
operation at a new project in
Des Moines.

"The Southeast Bottoms Pro<
ject,” unrelated to “The Des
Moines Project” or S.D.S., origi-
nated last summer. Jim Dunn,
a former social worker at the
Wiiltie House in Des Mnines, orr
ganized the summer staff oi nine
who began preliminary block
organizing.

The most tangible results of
last summer’s work were sev-
eral “demonstrations." Granted,
the neighborhood still doesn't
have a stop light, and it doesn’t
have sewers, but something
much more significant was at
complished. Gradually some or
the people in the Bottoms be-
gan to believe that change was
possible, and that they could
help to bring it.

Although most at the stall
left at the end of the summer,
the Project continued. This tall
it rented a house which the
people iixed up as their “Project
House.“ They use it tor regular
meetings or the neighborhood,
[or social acti ‘ties, and for a
weekly medical and psychiatric
clinic started by doctors irom
the College ot Osteopathic Media
cine and Surgery. A donated
mimeograph is used to put out
a neighborhood n e w s p a p e r,
“ACT.”

The community, of course, is
not yet “organized” but the
spirit of unity and optimism
continues to grow These people
are no longer talking about sim-
ply “improving" their neighbor-
hood — they are no longer going
to be satisﬁed with the paving
around the public water trough

—they are talking about end~
lug slums; and they re doing
something about it

There are several immediate
needs at the neighborhood if it
is to develop One is a com-
munity co- operative and credit
union The people are consist-
ently overcharged by local mer-
chants, on whose credit they de»
pend since they are unable to
get loans trom banks and loan
companies.

Another important project is to
get the area rezoned in the
city’s current urban renewal
plan the Bottoms area is zoned
industrial, although there is no
indication industry would use
the area.

A hasic premise oi the End
the Slums Movement and OI
the War on Poverty is that
change must come about pri—
marily through indigenous eta
torts. People from outside the
community may contribute re-
sources not inund wllhin the

t Conference

community, but the real leader-
ship and direction must be (lit:-
tated by the neighborhood. in
this context, the conference also
discussed possible involvement
of students in this and similar
projects. it seems that college
stuuems may tunction in two
hasic ways: they could go to
Des Moines on weekends to
work, and they could raise mon-
ey to help iinance the Projectt

Student volunteer work is like
ly to be unreliable, and most of
it could be done by neighbor-
hood volunteers or start anyway.
Financial help is likely to be
much more helpful to the com-
munity. Funds could be used,
for instance, to hire people irom
the neighborhood as stait men‘r
hers.

Helping to ﬁnance a project
is not as exciting as running
your own crusade, nor is it. as
righteonsly grimy as a worlt
camp, but in the long run it
may be the most significant
contribution affluent societies
can make to developing areas.

There Will be a meeting in
the South Lounge, Monday at
7:00, to discuss the “Southeast
Bottoms Project” and possible

Grinneil involvement.
