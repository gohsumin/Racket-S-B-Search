A REVIEW
By DAVID DILLON

“Every sane person knows
that it is a better thing to
build a City than to bombard
it, to plow a lield Ihan to
trample it, to serve mankind
than to conquer it, And yet
once the armies get loose, the
terrific noise and shock 01
war make all that was valu-
able seem stale and dull and
sentimental . . . seem to sink
to so much whimpering futil-
it .”
