SAGA Flicks

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

As another juicy morsel in his irothing
Cauldron of goodies, SAGA Chuck is
dishing out a new delicacy to the stu-
dents — a SAGA-inspired, SAGA-spom
sored ﬁlm festival. The extravaganza
will be held In the Sacrosanct conﬁnes of
the Quad dining hall this Friday, March
7, (tonight,) at 7:30 pm (meal cards
are not necessary and the doors will re.
main open thmughout the evening.)

Contrary to popular opinion, the even-
ing’s entertainment (billed as SAGA
Soul Night on the social calendar) will
not include SAGA Martha and Jo doing
the Bop, nor a documentary on the his-
tory of SAGA since the Middle Ages (it
was called the Black Plague then.) in-
stead, the revelers will be entertained by
movies by such oldies-but-goodies as
W. C. Fields, The Three Stooges, and
the Little Rascals, with a few 10-minute
extracts oi old horror rlicks (the juiciest
parts) thrown in for added spice. See
Frankenstein in halid-to-hand mortal
combat with the Hunchback“ Tremble
as the Deadly Mantis invades the air!”
Watch as the Mummy ages mo years in
two seconds — then back again in iourl ll

Chuck vigorously denies the rumor that
he will be showing special skin ﬂicks,
but who can tell what he may do it
enough people Show upl

Not only will SAGA provide the enter-
taiiiment tree-ofscharge, but also the
goodies to lnuhch olll Peanuts, popcorn,
and Pepsi will be available to everyone
(with ample seconds it you save your
plate.) Rumor has it that Chuck has or.
dered 90 lbs. of peanuts for the festivi-
ties. so let this be a warning # it they
all don’t get eaten tonight, we’ll probably
be in [or a new taste sensation in our
mystery meat and jello tor the rest of
thet Semester!

Chuck plans to have more or these ies-
Iivals in the future, and said that if
anyone is interested in showing movies
outside in the spring, he would be happy
to provide refreshments (a SAGA Sleep-
in. maybe?)

nny Cox Returns to Grinnell

By GARY GIDDINS

This Saturday evening at 10:30 there
Will be a twinsbill concert in Younkers
Lounge. The periormers will lie Donny
Cox and the duo of Brewer and Shlpley.

Cox perlormed to an enthusiastic
audience at Grinnell last September. An
excellent singer and guitarist, he sings
a remarkably large repertoire ot iolli
music, blues and pop material. He also
plays guitar arrangements or rages,
Christmas Carols and the choral 5804
tion from Beethoven's Ninth, Danny.
who currently makes his home in San
Francisco, has been an itinerant folk-
singer for several years, traveling
throughout the countly. In the last year
he has begun to get wider exposure
singing on several Trv. variety shows
and performing at many colleges. The
theme or his music is H you guessed it
friends — love, with all its schmaltzy
ramifications proudly advertised. Like
Lord Buckly, he asks his audience,
"Would it embarrass you it I were to
tell you that i Love You?" It usually
does embarrass the audience, but re<
markably enough he means it, and, more
importantly, he communicates it.

Mike Brewer and Tom Shlpley have

also traveled around the country, pen-
iorming as a duo, for many years.
Though they come irom Ohio and Okla-
homa respectively, they met when both
moved to California. Each had worked
with various groups before they started
working together. Since then they have
recorded a tew singles including Keeper
of the Keys and Green Bamboo and
their llrst album. Brewer and Shlpley
Down in LA. Although they record with
rock accompaniment, their live pens
iormances feature their adept acoustical
guitar work and a tight harmony in
their singing. They compose all their
material, which consists at grass roots
folk inspired melodies and personal but
communicative lyrics. Broadside Magni-
zine in a record review, wrote of them,
“They have a well produced, advanced
folk-rock sound with is wellsstressed ems
phasis on rhythmic patterns. Over this
they add a good tlght harmony iollow.
ing good melodic lines," And High Fidel~
lty wrote of their albuml “The results of
this talented duo and so many right de<
cisions is one of the most satisfying and
professional debut albums ever heard in
rock."
So come and hear them.

perhaps Guerllla Theatre was planning
another performance (just think what
they could do with those spoonsi) Whero
could the precious metal be?

Finally, Friday noon a ransom note
was presented to SAGA Chuck that pr0<
mised return of the abducted spoons,
”unmolested” it he would agree with
the looter‘s demands. The note, protes-
sionally fashioned out of magazine and
newspaper letters, was signed ”GGFS."
(Ahal A superskidnaping mastermind-
ed indubitably by SDS—vthey control ev.
erything else around here, or so we’ve
all been informed.)

In a secret, closely-guarded interview
with the bandidos (to set the record
straight, they are not connected wilt
SDS—yet) held under the slide at Mon
riil Park, the 5&1; got the hot dope on
the story behind the spoon-napping.

Apparently, the idea for this super-
orime originated after a served meal
one night when the “Gentleman’s Gour.
met and Friends Society" had to Wait
too long for their food, and then didn't
get enough. For revenge, they decided
to subtly pilter at least 143 spoons from
the dining room (class of ’71 and '72.)
Throughout the week each member at the
gang stealthily lett each meal with any-
where irom one to five spoons concealed
on his body. At last count, they had col.
lected over 200 spoons, all of which are
stored in o topsecret, subterranean
cache awaiting their eventual release.

Appearing at tirst very amused and
calm about the catastrophe, Chuck was

conspirators, 1n the hopes or redeeman
his lost silverware. But, since the nuts
asked for nothing more specific than a
"decent and ample" meal, he was unable
to do anything until the “GO FS” clari-
ﬁed their terms. Through an exceptional
lack or communication which seems to
be so popular lately, the two sides
