The Eyes Thai See

Business Asst.

Amid one or two jeers and a great deal of applause,
the Latin American Conference came to a close last Week.
Jeers from those few with eyes that are always “looking,
for something" who thought that the Conference was too
one—sided, applause from those of us who found the four
exciting days of discussion most interesting and informative.

The Conference as We see it, was not a series of “pro-
Castro” meetings and discussions, Mr. Shapiro and certain-
ly Mr. Alexander were not here only to advocate a pro-
Castro stand. They presented us with a good deal of in«
formed opinion which was at times complimentary to the
present Cuban regime, and more than occasionally suggest-
ed the many difficulties involved in complete acceptance
of the Castro government.

“The revolution in Cuba,” said Alexander, ”goes be-
yond Cuba and Castro and much, much deeper,"

If the Conference was at all weighted, t was weighted ‘
with clear thinking speakers who were able to back up
their opinions with experience and facts and with speakers
:vho were interested in presenting many sides of the ques«

lOn.

Furthermore, this conference was not concerned with
Cuba alone, Neither commentators nor panel members re
flected any pro-destination of the conference. If discussion
seemed to turn toward Cuba, it was because the Cuban
problem is a pertinent one.

Discussion often wandered back into the Cuban dif»
ficulty, not through the efforts of the speakers but
through the students themselves; who, as we have sug-
gested before, are becoming more aware of the problems
involved and more interested in learning as much as possi-
ble about this “in-the-news" area.

If the eyes that see more than is there and the ears
that hear only What they Want to hear want something
to yell wolf about, we might suggest a look into their own
furry faces. It is not the sort of talk which comes out of
the Latin American Conference but rather their own spe»
cial concoction of fairy-tale nonsense that deserves closer
scrutiny.

 

Bowen Sees Art, Fitness Emphasized;
Praises Conslilulion, Travel Grants

by Ruth Gruenewald

”New Developmenls at Gri -
hell" was the subiect of piesi—l
dent Bowen’s chapel speech!
Wednesday, in which he out-
lined some of the important cur—
rent developments concerning
the college. ‘

should be approached wilh the
excilemenl that comes from be-
ing u part of an interesting and
promising new educational
idea," rather than wilh n de-
featlst c: frightened attitude.

if the program proves success

In discussing the new consti-
tution, Bowen said. “No one is
perhaps fully satisfied wilh il,
in every detail, but I think there
is general acceptance of it As a
sound basis for orderly and
progressive sludcnl govern-l
ment.” He complimented those
students who hclpcd to ell-owl
il up, adding that “good governs
menl at any level is a product,
not so much of formal conslilu-l
tions, as of responsible citizen-
ship and wise and dcvolcd lead-
ciship.”

Bowen emphasized that lhc
constitution is directed toward
the college conununily as a
whole, although specific prob-
lems and inleresls of indi-
vidual halls and of north and

soulh campuses should not be

ignohed.

The president went to
speak about the junior year ex-l
aminations which will be given'
next year to the class of ’63
on an experimental basis. Hel
pointed oul the fact that “it'

on

 

ful, it “may eventually lead to

profound change in the educa-
tional program of the College."

Such changes would include
a reduction in the emphasis on
grades nnd individual courses.
and an increase in freedom of
students lo pursue their educa-
tion independently.

By offering credits to stu-
dents who successfully pass

the test, it is hoped that they
will be able to reduce their
regular coursc loud, thus leav»
ing lime for “reading, reflec-
tion, and pursuit of worth,-
whlle extracurricular in-
tenests."

In the area of physical edu-
cation and recreation Bowen ex-
plained the new system of non-
compulsory physical education
to be instituted next year. In
stead of having required classes
students will be Dbliyd to dem-
onstrate ability in swimming, in
a team sport and in a carry—over

To the Editor:

1 think mosl of us agree that
the use of the fences on a college
campus lo control foot traffic
creates a very ugly appearance.
At their besl, lhcy are merely
reminders to help mainlaln the
bcauly of our campus by using
lhc walks and help avoid the un-
sightly bare pclhs that would
otht—rwise occur. Al their Worst,
lhcy suggcsl a control for anlr
mals and are out of place.

Our decision lo replace part of
the fences wilh small signs as ice
minder: to use the walks has paid
off unusually wcll lo date. We
want lo express Oul‘ appreciation
to the students and staff alike
for lhis fine cooperation.

We would likc to encourage lhc
usc of all areas of our campus for
lhc gathering of formal or infers
in _ groups, bul we want its
beauty lo justify such use. There

You have a standing invitation
to suggest ways of helping to
improve the funclion and beauty
of our campus. in the mcanlimc,
wc hope everyone will ccnlinuc
to observe the little signs, ”Please
use the Walks.”

To the Editor:

On the evening of Mondayi
March 13, I returnEd to the l'-

 

lord

had left my books was now bereft
of these, i made a Search of lhc
vici lityiand found nothing. Ex-
pressions like lifted, pllfered,
heisted and hacked come lo mind,
bul I dismissed them'immediately.

Surely not at Grinnell, lhe
Harvard of the Midwcsl, could
such a deed be perpetuated. A
fruitless trip to the assorted
Grinnell pawnshops confirmed
my fears. Truly, here Was a case
of common thievery.

Granted, I had sinned in leavA
ing a large black loose-leaf note-
book, a German text and a small-
er tan notebook to hold my place;
but surely if 100»odd other peo-
ple indulged in this, it must be
socially acceptable.

Bemused, I remembered that
the large notebook contained
all my notes for all my courses,
and that the German text con-
tained copious notes for a test
the following Friday.

I reflected stoically that, after

all, il could have been womb
someone could hnvc appropriated
my new gnu»fur lap robe which
i save exclusively for use in the
library of a chill night.

ll is perhaps time that Grinnell
should think seriously about the
bunch system. Al prcsenl We
seem to have reached lhc plalcuu
of ethical concern. somewhere in
our intellectual peripheries stands
lhc qualion cf the honor syslem.
Sporadically, the question asserts
itselffat gatherings likc the cue
lumn encampment — ils advo-
clltcs enclump lhcmsclves around
lbis question and some even agl-
late for il when they return lo
the Campus. .

i am nol so sure now that lhc
muchstouted system would suc-
ceed, but I am unduly pessimistic.
i must not allow myself lo be
soured on lhc intrinsic colleclivc
honesty of the Grinnell sludcnl
body lhrough one isolated inci-
denl, Surely lhjs way madness
lies, and lhc honor system will
eventually come lo pass.

Meanwhile, will the person
who made off with my book and
notebooks heed a fervent plea for
their return? Leave them on the
table by the main entrance of
the Union, the lobby of the lip
bral‘y, some other obvious place

First Week in March

The reign of apathy was brief,
but the effects were far-reaching.
jThere was an exodus toward
lthe philosophies of lhc early
'Stoics. The campus situation be-
came so apathetic that those
who were the most staunch sup-
,porters of apathy no longer
cared for recruiting new mem-
bers, leaving the field wide open

Second Week in March

The week of the LAC.

5 The Latin American Confer-
lencc had such a great cifccl up—
on Grinnell students that any-
one nol speaking Spanish was
shunned and had to listen to the
proceedings over KGRW to a-
void being seen in public.
lThe Third Week of March
During this time, folk music
lwas the greatest lhing in lhe
world. A Mr, Finney came and
sang ethnically lo the tunes
plunked oul on a Mandoscella
with only six strings tuned like
a guitar. A Hootenany was held
in the Union wilh Peter Cohan
accompanying himself on Naida
Tushnet.

The Fourth Week in March
was the week of shaving off
hair.

We can hardly wait to see
what new non-conformity will
.be the order of the day.

 

llS Peace Corps
, Will Teach, Work

1 by Craig Henderson

The Peace Corps, one of Pre—
sidem, Kennedy's pct projects,
is beginning to lake a definite
form and may be sending stu-
dents lo foreign countries by
next fall. Already there have,
been over 17,300 applicclions
submilled to the Corps. and the
four page, so question applica—
tion form is yel to be published.

The ‘Peace Corps will be com-
posed primarily of young college
graduates and non-college youlh
with special skills who will go
lu underdeveloped areas of the
world to “teach, build or work”
on a local level, This movement
has taken hold on campuses
throughout the United States
and especially in the Midwest
Conference. Grinncll may Very
likely contribute some of the
first members of the Corps.

According lo an announce-
ment published late last month
by the White House, colleges
and universities will be one of
five bases of recruilmem.

In addition, the Corps en-
courages young people to work
through private agencies, var-
ious government agencies such
as 10A and the U, s. Informa-
tion service, the U. N. and
direct recruitment program.

Members of the Peace Corps
will teach and work on health
projects, in agriculture, on con-
struction piojecls or in govern-
mcnl administration. il is hoped
that universities will cslnblish
training programs, and special
summer training sessions will be
inaugurated this Summer-

Students who speak a foreign
language, especially Spanish,
will be in line for leaching jobs,
while non-collage applicants with
special skills, such as construc-
tion wcrkers and factory per-
sonnel, will be used on local
level improvcmenl projects.

Those who participate in this
program will live among the
people wilh whom lhey work
nnd will receive from lhc Unit-
cd States government or spon—
soring agency no allowance for
food. housing and clolhing. Upon
their return, participants will
receive a $50-a-month bonus
paymenl. Men who participate
will be temporarily deferred but
ncl exempl from lhc draft.

phcsized ils desire lo attaln the
