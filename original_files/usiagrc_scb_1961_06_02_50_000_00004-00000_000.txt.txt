New Dillisional Organization Pldn TNew Ice Rink lGrelchen Hayes Vii-ews Prlze Piciures;
Advocaled By President Bottell

A new plan tor divisional or.
ganization oi the college has

been suggested to tho iaeulty.

by Prcidcnt Howard R Bowen
and is now awaiting the approv-
al of the trustees

Bowen‘s proposal is to estabr
lisli.a “general division” con»
sisting of the departments of hiss
tory, mathematics and philoso—
phy. These three departments
by the nature ot their subiccls.
have intimate relations with
many other departments.

Bowen said that only aminor
change in the divisional organi-
zation recommended by the

faculty would hive to be made.‘

This would involve movingr po-
litical sclent‘e and air ‘science
to the social studies division
Mathematics, would be moved

sciences to the “general diviSr

is hoped that this general

on might become a

bridge-builder cantributinz t0 ‘

the unification of the rolle‘ze

and helping to counteract the ‘
tendency toward insulnritv in i

departmental‘ and divisional
organization.

In dealing with educational
policy, the general division
would be concerned not only
with its member departments.
but also with'the relations of
these departments to the entire
college.

The unifying ciiect which the
new di\ n would have on the
departments of the colleE-f: can

tory would ,be concerned with
the history of science. mathe-
matics would stress mathematics
and statistics as a basic tools

"The work of the new diviSr
ion would be to consider how
‘llle three fields might contrib-
Lite to the total program ot the
college. to serve as an import
ant link in the communication
among the divisions and den
partments and to suggest ways
in which the many departments
of the college might contribute
to the historical. mathematical

of students,“ according to
Bowen's report.

Bowen.- by his proposal for
creating the new division. would
like to achieve better logic in
the divisional organization. to
break down barriers between
the disciplines and to build
bridges between them.
