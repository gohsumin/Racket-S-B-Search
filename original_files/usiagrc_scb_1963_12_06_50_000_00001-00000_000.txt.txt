His career began as a teen-
ager in the New Orleans Dixie-

reached such a preeminent po-

most of today's trumpet play-

Much of Armstrong’s fame
rests in his ability to play in
the high registers with incred-

succeed in forcing out an F

Gilmour Announces
Selection of Book

The Senate Establishment,
by Senator Joseph S. Clark, the

Gilmour, Director of the Pro:
gram in Practical Political
Education anounced this week.

In February, 1963, Senator
Clark delivered a ringing at—
tack on a small minority of
Senators from both political
parties who, he claimed, dom-
inate the rules, the committee
appointments and chairman-
ships, and all legislative ac—
tions of the us. Senate. Docu-
menting his charges with evi—
dence from recent political
events,‘ he asserted that “the
Senate establishment is almost
the antithesis of democracy."

This explosive speech, which
has been likened to the earlier
addresses of Webster, Clay, or
Calhoun, provoked a spirited
debate, with most of the legis-
lative is: a d e r s condemning
Clark’s stand and with Senator
Paul Douglas as his lone sup-
porter.

Gathered here in one volume
are the entire text of Senator
Clark’s speech, the resulting
dialogue, and the concluding
address of Senator Douglas.

“Seator Clark’s charges here
are serious and sobering; they
should be carefully analyzed
and considered, in the light of

 

the resulting debate." Gilmour
observed.
