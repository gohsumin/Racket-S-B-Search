Washington Demonstration Boasts
Both Beards and Mothers in Protest

By BOB HDDIERNE

As demonstrations with 25,000-
50,000 people go, last Saturday’s
Peace March in Washington Was—
n’t much to “write home aboutr"
Or at least on the surlace it
Wasn’t much.

The march was well organized,
smoothly run and easily ended~
which removes most at the typi-
cal news attractions such as tights,
mass arrests and other similar
disturbances. The match was so
well run and the demonstrators
so well disciplined that even a
determined groop oi counterrdemr
oustrators could not get anything
started. George Llncoln Rockwell
did jump cue marcher who was
cariytng a Viet Cong ilag, and
several or his colleagues tried
much the same thing out they
were all quietly hauled away and
then ignomtniously lined a mere
ten dollars and set tree.

The Washington policeLno no-
vices when it comes to this sort
of thing—must be given tremen-
dous credit for the patient, almost
courteous way in which they han-
(lied the marchers. They know all
the tricks of handling crowds.

But just as important in main-
taining order were tlhe “marshals"
oi the participating organizations
—marked by orange arm bands—
who kept the crowds moving—a
Washington ground tulkand‘ who
otherwise assisted the police in
maintaining a semblance Di order.

All or this surtace tranquility
on the part of the marchers is

 

somewhat deceiving, however. A-
mong their ranks were at least
three distinct iactions all fighting
to gain control at the socalled
Peace Movement. The groups—
loosely identified—Were a moder-
ately left wing iaction, a radical-
ly leit wing traction and the South-
ern delegation, the civil rights
people whose support is being
sought.

At the convention which was
held in Washington most at the
week proceeding the actual dems
onstiauon, these groups [ought
openly, olten to the point of
wrestling matches tor the mlcm~
phone. or the three groups, the
civil rights people were the least
interested, In fast, they were
down right cold about the whole
idea at getting involved in a move
ment that would “use" them
more than "aid” them. So while
the radical and moderate groups
taught between themselves they
also were righting to keep the
souLhern delegation interested,

telling the southern delegation that®

they were all bound together by
a common interest in “self-deter-
minatlion.”

On a somewhat ditferent level,
the differences within tlhe move-
ment were readily visible just by
watching the crowd Saturday. lt
ranged mm the usual bearded,
longrnaired “heats” to ministers
in conventional, conservative
suits, to middleaged matrons car-
rying signs asking to have their
"boys" hack home.

iRich Character Interpretation
Viewed as High Point of Play

By MARY MALCOLM _
Audience and actors rollickod
together to a riotous evening on
Monday and Tuesday evenings at
the college Piayers’ perlormonce
oi Phillip King’s See How They
Run, directed by Tanya Hovanne
sian.

The farce, given a masterful
climax by its cast, called for rich
character interpretation and ac
tors let loose with gestures, facial
expressions and accents that con-
sistently hit their mark.

Debbie Abbott, as Ida the maid,
delighted the audience with her
scatterbrained simplicity and at»
iusive enthusiasm. As the pun

i2

tanical Miss Skillon, Melinda
Ward reached a. high point at
cumbersome lack of dignity,
spending much of the play drunk
in the closet

J. Laird Garland and Cathy Cosr
man played the vicar Lionel Toop
and his wife Penelope. Garland
was equally at home on stage and
running around cit-stage, as well
as in his parson's costume and
“state of undress.” MlSS C05-
man's acting ability was most
manitest and delightlful in hEr ex-
pressions of openreyed and inno-
cent non-complicity in the insane
atmosphere at the Vicarage.

Bill Downey played Clive with
comically extreme but always ap<
propriate over-acting. The Com-
munist spy was done with con-
trasting and equally effective r5<
straint: by Max Heliigott, Rick
Roehlk, as the bespectacled Hum-
phrey, expressed the audience's
own happy confusion with his bat-
ﬂed, good-natured sincerity. Ken
Hicks dashed irantlcally about as
the pajamaed bishop and cap-
tured the proper ratio of absurdity
and pomposity. Bruce McConach-
ie, as the Cockney sergeant, was
most notable for his cavedrin
chest and protruding abdomen.

Cowles Dinner
Fetes Children

By ANNE FARRER

Parking their boots in the hall
and their bubble gum behind their
ears, approximately 125 ﬁrst
through sixth graders descended
on Cowles last night for the Uncle
Sam’s Club Christmas Dinner,

Eating, squirming, giggling, spill-
ing milk, and eating some more,
they made short work or roast beef
and apple pie They presented,
perhaps, a pint-sized version of the
North Campus Problem — no one
could exactly define the situation
and anything went.

Grinnellians scrambled to wipe
the noses or, get third helpings for,
and discuss new math somewhat

, intelligently with, their respective

guests. Although entertainment was
provided by means of Scarlateers.
Tanagers, and cartoons, Santa
Claus Milt Tootle (ho, ho) put on
the biggest show, as he passed out
treats.

The evening proved a reciprocal
fun for the younger generation and
success — it provided food and
sublimation for the older WiLh

 

Following open house on both
North and South campus from
8:309:30. the Three Souls, a jaZl
instrumental group, will provide
music tor dancing in the North
Lounge. The music will also bl
piped into the South Loungl
where tables will be set up.

The Forum will be decorated
for Christmasqlne decorations ins
eluding seven Christmas trees and
a photo exhibit oi the activities
held in the Forum during its first
year.

Also on the weekend calendar
is The Third Man, a film directed
by Carol Reed. It will be shown
tomorrow at 8:00 and again Sun-
day at 9:30 in ARH Auditorium.

A thrilling mystery story, it
deals with an out-otrwork writer
who returns to Vienna to renew
an acquaintance with an old
friend, Harry Lime, but arrives
just in time lol- his friend's [Ir
neral.

This issue is the trial issue
for editor-elect Bob Hodierne.
Next week's paper will be the
last issue by the 1965 editor
John Wolf,
