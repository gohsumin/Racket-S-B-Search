the year, was held on Sept 27

Howard Burkle (philosophy

Christiansen (biology) composed
the panel of faculty members

from abroad

in Panama last year helping the
YMCA enlarge its Armed Serv—

mented, in comparing the Uni

that obtaining- a higher educa—

The students are very serious
about their studies and ex-

organized and provides little so-

All quiet on the ethnic front?

One at the greatest unsolved
problems today, according to
John 'Burma (sociology), is co—
operation between majority and
minority gioups. He expanded

Sociologists and psychom—
gists have reached it new un-
derstanding of prejudice and
discrimination It does not
Stem from any single cause,
but most of it can be traced
to one of three miljor Sources,
said Burma.

The first is that it mcets per—
sonality needs such as frustra—
tion and ego-building. Another
is that it can be employed in
“political and economic attempts
to get what one wants." To ap—
pear rational, one voices “plaus-
lble" reasons for Dnc’s prejudice,
The third source is the gradual»
ly built up hatred which has
been transmitted by process of
assimilation.

Three stages mark the change
in Negroswhlte relations. in the
"accommodation" stage, Negroes
sought concessions irom the
whites. We are now in the ”mile

legal equality, White good will
is no longer the only means.

When they achieve full legal

lie with the individual. “The

l The exhibition, which

from the Bertha Schaefer Gal»

Decades of Morris Kantor.”

Mr, Robert McMillan. who
twill give the gallery talk on
‘ this exhibition, commented, “in-

opportunities to gain a retro-

laboratory in the world,

Christiansen stated that his

primary connection with Grin—
nell while he was in France was
through the Scarlet and Black,
“The 5&3 revealed a frivolous
life at Crinnell compared with
the all work and no play atmos~
pheres at French universities,”
he remarked.

The schools in France make
great demands on the students
and have very high require
nients. Not only do the students
work hard. but they are also
active in politics.

Christiansen concluded that
most of France’s resentment to-
ward the U.S. lies in her refusal
to accept her role as a second.
class nation in the world today.
