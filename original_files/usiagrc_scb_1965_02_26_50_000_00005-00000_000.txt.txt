‘Faces of Mexico'

Photo Exhibit

Makes Debut in Forum Saturday

By Bob Hodierne

“Faces of Mexico,” a photo-
graphic art exhibit resulting
from [he eight-day, 3200»mile
interim study project of two
Grinnell students, will make its
debut Saturday morning in the
bulletin board area opposite
the Forum desk.

The exhibit. is the brain Child
of John Phillips and Henry Wilr
helm. The two bearded students
made their photographic safari
in a'VW and, during the course
of the trip, [00k 600 pictures.
The Show will feature about 50
of those.

The two say the trip wasn’t
originally planned with on eye
toward an exhibit. In fact, they
say, the trip wasn't really
planned at all. It just happened.

Not until nearly the end of
their trip did the idea of an ex-
hibit occur to them. “Twenty-
four hours away is an entirely

 

different culture," said Phil-
lips, “Most people don’t. realize
that. We thought we’d bring it
baCk.”

“We wanted to show some of
the many facets of Mexico,”
said Wilhelm, a 21-year-old
freshman who served a year in
Bolivia as a member of the
Peace Corps. “We wanted to
show Mexico’s beauty as well
as its povertyl"

Their photographic studies
sweep from wealth and plush
night-life lo bulliighting to the
children of the Monterrey
slumsr

The two achieve their most
dramatic results in their photo-
graphs of the people, especial-
ly the children The faces of the
children say more of the life of
the peasant than could ever
hoped to be said in Words. The
exhibit is truly a remarkable
Work of art.
