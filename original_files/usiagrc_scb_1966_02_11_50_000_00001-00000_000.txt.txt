Committee [lotion
Found Acceptable

Acceptance of the proposals on
Senate reorganization Wednesday
evening brought a tentative halt
to recent Senate preoccupation
ivith structure and purpose.

Proposals from the committee
on reorganization, Chaired by Dan
Bucks, provided for a return to
the old system with two senators
from all residence halls with be-
tween 31 and 70 members, three
from larger halls and one irom
smaller halls. The amendments
provide for rules and hail regula-
tions changes to originate only in
joint meetings of the aws board
and the c oi HP, subject to ap-
proval by the Senate. They also
restore the office of Speaker of
the Senate, to be nominated by
SGA president and elected by a
majority vote or the Senate. Ad-

‘ dltiohal nominations require a sec-
ond from onethird of tile Senate,

Bucks said that his committee's
plan “divides the efforts of stu-
dent government and gives to those
respective groups the responsibility
which in st concerns them.” The
respoiis‘ 'y ior rule changes is
placed with the house presidents,
while the Senate takes Care of

the power to initiate rule changes,
included house presidents in the
voting body or the Senate, and
allowed the C of HP and AWS to
meet separately. Tlle Bucks pro-
posals require joint meetings.

In presenting his amendments
to the amendments, Black com-
merited “I decided to indulge in
the game we’ve all been playing
of constitution writing.”

Bucks defended his committee's
division oi power, saying “it is
my opinion that house presidents
have been here tour years and
are informed. Nonetheless house
presidenis’ primary concern is in
the rules area.” Bucks stressed
the importance or having each
branch deal with that area which
most directly concerns it.

Dick Chady differed with the
committee’s change in the Sen-
ate’s structure. “The only argu-
ment you've presented is one tor
wider participation. The arguments
we have over structure are large-
ly irrelevant, I have yet to he
convinced that we do need a

Freshman ﬁuspendcd
0n Visitation Giordes

By Bob Hotlierlle

A Read freshman woman
was suspended from school
for the remainder of the aca-

demic year this week by the
Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs.

The suspension came Tues-
day after a meeting of the
Faculty Committee The wom-
an told the 5&3 Thursday
that She has not and will not
appeal the decision.

The Suspension of the wom<
an follows last week’s sus
pension of a Smith sopho~
more man. The man was SuS<
pended when he was found in
his room with a woman by in

Approval of the 1966-67 academ-
ic calendar was the major con-
sideratinn at last Monday's facul—
ty meeting.

The new calendar will have one
signiticnnt change: a four - day
mid . semester break in early No-
vember, one day more than this
year’s.

Dean James H. Stauss, who

. chaired the meeting, declined to
comment on the rest of the agen-
da.

legcs that the woman sus-
pended is the one who was in
the mall’s room.

The man did not at any
time identify the woman to
the committee. The woman
does not admit to being in-
volved in the incident. It is
the feeling of friends of the
students that the committee
and the deans acted upon
supposition and circumstan-
tial evidence only in suspend-
ing the woman.

The Scarlet and Black
asked the chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs, John Burma
(sociology), and the various
deans upon what they based
their identification of the
woman Suspended. All re-
fused to comment ill any way.

In the past it has been the
policy of the Faculty Conl-
nlittee and the (leans not to
comment or give justifica-
tion for suspensions.
