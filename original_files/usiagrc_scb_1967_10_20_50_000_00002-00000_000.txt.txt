TOWN AND COLLEGE

Relations between the young people of Grinnell and the stu-
dents 0t Grinnell College are at a very low point. The hostility
can be traced back to the objectionable behavmr of a few persons
on each side: "townles" who steal from college rooms and lounges
and vandalize college property, and “college queers” whose ac-
tions downtown are repulsive to the sensibilities of local residents.

Fear on each side that the respective ways of life are in
danger, and the subsequent rumors and exaggerations, have led
to hostility toward all members of the opposite group.

College students have two responsibilities: we must be tolerant
of the “tomles” and we must make sure they are tolerant at us.

“Townies” who steal and vandalize must be caught and turned
over to the police. “Townies” who verbally and physically abuse
Negro students must be identified, and complaints filed with the
police immediately.

Police Chief Peters is firmly dedicated to the maintainace of
law and order in Grinnell, but he is handicapped by the hesi-
tanco of students to press charges and produce witnesses. We
must be willing to lace the problem and deal with it directly.

The 5&3 urges President Leggett to work to establish a town-
college commission to examine the difficulties between college
students and young townspeople. The problem wants study; it
must be eliminated soon.

ANTI-WAR PETITION

The 5&3 urges all members of the Grinnell community to
llgn the anti-war petition being circulated by GSM. Marches and
draft card burning have their places, but the political implica-
tions of petitions circulated among college students are far reach-
lug.

The most obvious response by the Johnson Administration is
to dismiss such petitions as the work of idle college noise-makers.
The coming majority of many students and the rapidly approach-
Ing election year should, however, temper this view. A series of
luch petitions on college campuses around the country would
certainly help to push the peace question into the forefront in this
coming election year.

Let those of us who have been active in the peace movement
be the first to sign this important document. And let those of us
.who are just awakening to our responsibilities as citizens and
yeaccloving people make signing the petition our first commits
merit. Let us show President Johnson that the new voters of the
United States are opposed to his war.

NOTES FROM THE
CIRCULAR FILE

Four of the convocation guests will be staying in the mens‘
residence halls. But where in the hall? Dean Thompson told the
Resident Advisers that the guests would stay in the house presi-
dents’ suites; he told the house presidents that the guests would
be staying in the R. [Ls’ suites. He told the 5&3 he wasn't sure
where they were staying.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

lllllliillllllillllliillllllillllllillllllillllllllHillilllllillllllllll
To the Editor:

Due to some of the response
to the letters posted around
campus announcing a “drug
discussion and aid service” be
ing implemented, we would like
to clarify a few points:

1. The major project to he
carried out is a regular semi-
nar to be held at Eli-Loco, Sev-
eral students are working to-
gether to plan it, and the lirst
meeting is tentatively sched-
uled for Wednesday, November
I.
2. The “old" service, if he-
gun, can be no more than an
information service. No Haight~
Ashbury “main switchboard" is
being planned, and there is no
Intention of playing with il~
legality. Nevertheless, as dnlg
use spreads, people may want
advice. No such service now
exists, and if anyone has sug-
gestions or advice. put a note
in Box 513.

3. Perhap most importantil
the seminar will not be pro-
moting drugs. Hopefully, it will
air opinions and facts. Pot and
most hallucinogenics are illegal,
and that is a fact that no one
should forget. But, they exist,
and need to be examined, be-
cause they are so widespread
and reﬂect the society in which
they are used. The seminar is
not being addressed to the
“head" on campus, but to
everybody.

We hope this letter clears up
n iew oi the fears and ob-
jections that have been ex-
pressed.

I usually dislike the aroma
or newlymimeugraphed docu-
ments, but when I opened my
copy of the Haveman report
Wednesday night I genuinely
hoped for something.

What I hoped for—roughly
imagined and paraphrased—-
was just a paragraph some
thing like this:

“The Special Commltlee on
Educational Policy and Curri-
culum recommends that every
Grinnell student have the op
tion of taking a semester of
oft-campus work. Such students
would be placed in jobs in
large cities by the college of-
ﬁce of placement.”

What I hoped for, alas, was
Antioch. l . or maybe Beloit.
. . ,but never, I guess, Grinnell.

The paragraph wasn’t there,
but a little autobiography, 1
think, is necessary here.

Last week I took a little
mindrsobering sojourn to Boston
for six days. I didn't go to visit
there: I went to live there.

And I lived with some people
from Beloit engaged, as it
were, in just the kind of pro-
gram 1 want to talk about
(or talk around.)

They—excuse me, we—shared
an apartment. It’s really a very
fun thing to decorate an apart-
ment and live and cook for
yourself.

They went to work at typi-
cally workaday jobs — at the
Harvard Co-op or insurance
companies—every morning.

And i went to work every
morning. . . iollowing them.

I’m not sure What it is I
want to tell you, because ac-
tually the column this week is
nothing more than one lengthy
sigh.

But they were learning how
to live away from Grinnell and
—for six days—so was i.

“A really liberal education,”
Tom Greenfield mused to me
the other day, “has really got
to include getting out of Grin-
nell, Iowa now and again.”

The point really hit home,
because all the rive-hour bus
trip from Chicago to Grinnell

ERROOOR

By Neil Fischer

I found myself thinking the
most incredible and untoward
or thoughts. . . for me.

“Zowie,” I thought, “it will
really be good to get back
or home or whatrtbe-hell-ever
to Gﬁnnell."

Then I recanted: “What are
you doing, you nincompoop?
Aren’t you the one always
stumbling across campus mums
bling how much you hate the
place?”

“Self," I said to myself, “Stop
this immediatelyl"

But I couldn’t, because it
really was good to be going
. . . back.

Why? Because I thought I
was bringing something back?

Yes?

Why can't we get away from
Grinnell to bring something
back other than what We are
at home or at Grimell?

We have our Argonne Semes
ter and Newberry Library but
why can’t we all get away
from Grinnell more often?

Can’t we? Just because we
aren’t Antioch?

And can’t we learn what it’s
like to liveiindependently and
inconspicuously—in a pla cs
where there aren’t convenient
forums and scheduled social
events and trees and other in.
solating verdure?

Let’s have a bus-trip to Chl-
cago every other weekend, It
would only cost ten bucks if
we tilled a charter bus.

And you all know we would
fill it.

Dear readers and enemies I
wanted to wrim a single un-
disturbed unpretentious column.

This is the closest I want
to come, and I don’t care it
you like it or not.

I liked Grinneli for one whole
day after that trip.

I believe this, and maybe if
I strip away some of the tacky
phrasings and esoteric journa-
lese for a week, you’ll under.
stand that I am not~always~
a professional cynic.

This week it is my problem.

Could we do something about
it. . this time?
