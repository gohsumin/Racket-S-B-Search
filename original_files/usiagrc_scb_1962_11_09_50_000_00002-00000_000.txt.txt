The Seventh Crisis

There once was a man from the West
Who kept saying that he was the best.
Brown won in a pout, ‘

Dick started to pout,

And cried to the world, “I’ve been press’d."

Smucker-Hatfield

No drums, no trumpets

He strode out the locker room door and then he saw
her. She was in jeans, under a Ginkgo tree, playing a nine-
string banjo. He was smitten. He nearly dropped his bet-
ter-than-average grade point. It . . . was . . . love. With-
out thinking of the possible consequences i (she might ask
him to wear her pin—a peace pin) his mind machine—gun-
ned through his repertoire. A line. Which one? .

“Have you read ‘The Lonely Crowd’?" he asked ten-
tatively.

She struck an E-flat chord in answer. Then she spoke.
“No,"i’ she said. “Have you read the ‘Bagavahd Gita‘Y" she
aske .

“No," he said, falteringly. Had he stmck out already?
His hopes were dimmed. But he could not give up. He
waved his friends on to late dinner. ,

“How about a. lime phosphate?” he asked. She turned
her eyes downward. Then . . .

"All right,” she said. “Just one."

He knew he had scored. Not only had she consented
but she had stopped playing her nine-string banjo. She
rose to her feet quickly and they headed ofﬂ toward the
Union.

He was elated. But then his heart fell. The Union was
out of fizz-waterr No phosphates, But it didn’t seem to
matter to her. She settled easily for papaya juice.

Refreshed, they gazed into each others‘ eyes. Then
they rose together and walked out and, shoulder to should—
er, made their way toward the Minneapolis and St. Louis
Railroad tracks.

They Walked in silence, He stubbed his toe. The ties.
They were too close together. It’ll ‘be hard, he thought,
It'll be tough. She’s different. Society will reject us.

“It’ll be hard," she said, reading his thoughts.

“I know," he said. “But I’ll try. I'll really try I‘ll . . .
I’ll break training."

“I‘ll try too," she said. "I’ll wear socks.”

"And I‘ll give away my hall paddle,” he said

“And I’ll teach you how to play my nine—string banjo."

“That’d be nice," he said.

. Think of the money I’ll Save on razor blades, he
thought,

I might even learn to like my housemother,
thought. And maybe the orchestra needs a banjo.

I could drop out of athletics, he thought. Slowly.
Varsity first and then IM’S.

She thought, I could join Young Democrats . . . or
even i . . Young . . . no . . that would be to much all
at once.

Night had fallen on the campus and women's hours
were drawing near. They had walked for an etemity. But
now they found themselves at Main door.

“Adieu,” she whispered, a Single tear falling on his
hall pin.

”Good bye," he murmured. ‘
_ He darted nimbly down the steps, sworn to make it
work. The next morning they met again. At dawn. Near
the Shotput ring. He was sockless. His fingers were , w.
He had picked his roommates ukelele ‘til four in anticlpae
tion of the banjo lessons. He had traded his hockey stick
for a collage. He was sensitive now, She flitted across the
dewy infield. He hardly recognized her. It was the pixie
out. Or, possibly, the Women’s Honor G sweater, She was
radiant.

“It’ll work for us i . . I’m sure of it," she said breath-
Iessly. “I’ve changed. Guess what. I’m running for IM
chairman And I gave my roommate a quiet hours war

g All the while he stood there, taking her'in.

“She's changed," he muttered, dropping
against his sweatshirt. “She’s changed."

' Her eyes swept over him. She involuntarily took a
step backward. She ran her fingers over the red G on her
pocket.

“He’s chailgef, she murmured,
eyes downward. “He’s changed.”

They turned and walked away from each other, he
suddenly feeling the dew on his bare ankles and she rec
membering her IM dance rehearsal.

“FORUM .

FOR

DESCENT

By rom Phillips
Marmeladov, in “Crime and
Punishment," says that on the
Day of Judgment the Lord will
stretch forth his arm to all the
drunkards and' thieves and
whores in the world and receive
them. because “not one of them
ever thought himself worthy of
it." And I would like here to
talk about these sorts of things.

ACTUALLY, I think there are
two kinds of people who really
,desecve God’s grace; Marmala-
dov’s drunkards, and Saints. The

erything he has to God and
knows that it is not enough, and
the drunkard is a man who
gives nothing at all to God, and
knows that it is not enough.

The Saint commits no sins,
and the drunkal'd commits ev-
ery sin but the sin of Pride;
and so both are blessed be-
cause both are poor in spirit.
In the sight of God, than, the
ultimately good and the ulti-
mately depraved stand side
by side, for the only real
boly men ‘aro the ones who
realize their own wretched-
ness.

Leonard E. Meyer spoke on
“The End oi the Renaissance:
Notes of the Radical Empiricism
of the Avante Garde” Wednes-
day morning in Roberts Theater
and at a coffee hour that after-
noon, Part of the Fine Arts lec-
ture series, his talk was in com

junction with Paul Kuntz's (phi—
losophy) lectures, ”Order and
Chaos in the Arts.”

Meyer, who is a noted comv
poser, author, and musicologisi,
is chairman of the department
of music at the University of
Chicago. He is known for his
interest in aesthetics. psychology,
and communication in relation
to the arts,

His primary concern in the
lecture was with anti-teleologi-
cal (that which is not “goal-
oriented") art. There are three
methods for achieving
which John Cage describes as
“chance“ music. In music “free
from one's memory and imag-
ination." the composer re-
moves bimsclf from what he is
doing and “randomizes” to
get the full score.

In the second way, the com.
poser makes a drawing or graph
,and the realization of the Score

 

ensembles each performer re-
;ccives his own line drawing nnd,

‘be very random. “Tidbits” of

being aware of life itself; they
have no sense of “final causes."
They don’t Want to “do some-
l thing." As one Said when he
was questioned about why he
was an artist, “I am an artist
because I’m not a bricklayer."

Another question referred to
the consistency of the stand pbi—
losophically. Prof. Kuntz asked
if there could be knowledge
without some relevancy, since
“the radical empiricisls maintain
Ithat nothing in the world is
connected. Meyer said he thought
this position was not consistent
with experience.

Electronic music which is a
lconglomeration of recorded
sounds, may be random or com-
pletely pro-planned. In “calm
posing" computer music, another
type, the computer follows ine
structions or a set of rules for
form and picks notes from the
group provided it by the com-
poser. ,

BOTH TELEOLOGICAL and
random music are concerned, in
la Sense, with man's position in
Ithe universe, he stated. But anti-
teleological music shows no di-
rection or motion; it is just
“there." In this it has much in
common with existential philos-
]ophy. it seeks, by the absence
of form, to destroy habits, tra-
ditiol-ls, theories, etc., which are
obstacles alienating man from
nature, or more specifically
inc listener from sounds
sounds.

It is not an attempt to create
order out of chaos, but rather
to let the mind work of its own
accord. It differs from existen-
tialism in that being and non.
being are not categorical op.
posiles, but merely different
states.

Radical cmpiricism denies
the reality of relations or in-
teraction, of cause and effect,
Meyer said. There are certain
“consequences" — a word he
admitted was paradoxical in
this context — to this denial
of causality. The demand for
communication ,is irrelevant
becnuse the observer sees what
he wants to. Reduce the part
played by responsive control,
and error disappears. He de—
lined random acts as “these
for which the performing indi-
vidual is totally responsible,"
