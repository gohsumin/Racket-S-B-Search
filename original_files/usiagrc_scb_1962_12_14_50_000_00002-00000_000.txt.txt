To the Editor:

, Last week's letter from “A
{Concerned Student" was meant
l1 am sure, “not as fully-develop i
led proposals ready for immediatel
adoption, but as a basis for dis.
cussion of what We must all feel
are problems.” For although the
general ideas are very good, con»
siderable comment is called for.

This Concerned student cites
at length the case of a student
who received “A‘s" from an
outstanding high school, “700‘s"
on College Boards, and “D’s”
at Grinnell College. His con-
clusion is “that the professors
involvcd in such cases are
. without proper interest and/or

education to stimulate and v
challenge the “Ibo-plus hoard I
score studen ." In passing I -
should like to substitute «abil-
ity" for “education" in (his

conclusion, for I think that
there is no member of this ,
faculty who lacks “propel- odu— )
Cation,” although it is probable
that some members of any fac-
ulty have the interest but lack
the ability to do this

“Why should an ‘A’ student
GrinneIIY”? He should not. i
would assert further that he
could not, except by his own deal
ing. Grinnell has enough mien,
esting and able faculty mem-
bers that such a capable stur
dent could not consistently get‘
poor grades unless he refused to
be interested and refused to be
taught, This student obviously,

not "stimulated," even
though he must have had some‘

Friday. December l4, I962

Lei-fers if) ﬁle Edi’ror .

there is no student at Grinnell ;
who could not add to the list, i
as I have done in the previous
paragraph Every student at .
Crinnell is acutely aware, as

be is paying a tremendous
amount of money in hopes of
receiving a first—rate liberal
arts education. For these rea-
sons I am certain that every i
Grinnell student would wel- :
come with open arms an op-
portunity to evaluate courses
and teachers, as the Concerned .
student suggests, WITHOUT
THE msx OF BEING Clulm- i
FIE!) which this lone brave
individual has taken,

now that not all stu—

ism would be sound,
that there would be unjustly
bitter students (like the one dis-,
cussed at the beginning of this:
letter) who would be unfair to
teachers, and a portion of the,
student body would not bother’

even if it were in favor of the
idea. HOWEVER, the Board of
Trustees, or some appropriate
non-faculty committee, would be-
able to separate the sound from
the unsound, the unbiased from
the sour-grapes, and, even with.
out total participation, the prev—
alent from the unusual criticism.
Furthermore, there would be
constructive criticism and praise
of both curriculum and faculty,,
for Grinncll students, in their
quest for a good education, will
be quick to encourage the good
aspects of the Grinnell education,
if they are given a chance.

To the end that the students
be given such a chance to help
make Grinnell's education a bet-,
tar one, I urgently implore all
these students to take to heart

Readers answer ‘C‘oncerned

To the Editor:

After having read the liter.
ary effort of “A Concerned
Student," (in the Dec. 7 soon),
we agree with that humanities
professor who said that he
“looks for too many angles."

1T 15 TRUE that nearly cv-
eryone has legitimate gripes
about “intro” courses and hu—
manities, or about a few pro-
fessors in his first two years.

lBut why condemn the whole
lfaculty to the ninth circle of

ban for the “sins” of a few
professors?

We also disagree with “Cou-
cernerl’s“ r e commendations.
We do not think that the stu-
dents in general—and “Con-
cerned" in particular are qual-
ified to determine such a
serious matter as a profes-
sor’s salary.

"Concerned" also asks that
professors “do research on their
ow n time." Each professor
teaches about three courses, for
which he must grade papers
and exams, prepare lectures or
at least guidelines for discus-
sion, and read every bit as
much as the students, simply
in the pmcess of teaching his
course,

Also, he will probably have
committee and faculty meets
ings, give extra lectures, and
have conferences or discus-
sions with students now
much time are professors ex—
pected to give us?

At the risk of being called
members of the “mutual ad-
miration society,” we would
like to suggest that “Concern-
ed” get off this griping kick
and help the President and pro-
fessors make Grinnell the out-
standing college it can be.
