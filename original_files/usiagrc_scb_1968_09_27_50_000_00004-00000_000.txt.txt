KDlC, Grinnell's own radio
station, has begun broadcasting
alter two years of preparation,
The idea {or the station ﬁrst
began two years ago when Ba-
bak Armajeni, '68, organized
the first board of the radio sta~
tiun, It consisted of A station
manager, a personnel director,
all audio purchasing agent, a
news director, a program direc-
tor. a chief engineer, a public-
ity director, and a secretary.

Because Grinnell’s previous
nation (started in 1948) had
gotten in trouble with the FCC
and had consequently lost its
license, the new station had dil-
iiculty in getting its new li-
cense. After this obstacle was
overcome, the broadcasting was
iurther Slowed when the area
housing the station was not
completed, Limited broadcast-
ing did eventually take place
last spring during graduation
week.

Financing ior 1(ch comes
from SSA lunds. Most oi the
equipment in the station itself
was donated by Sherman M.
Fairchild, along wuh money
from alumni.

Because the station is broad
casting 121 hours per week, one
of the keys to its operation \5
the students involved. At the
present time there are 85 stu»
dents on the staif, 40 of whom
are DJ’s. The goal set by the
station is to have all the staff
obtain 3rd class licenses [mm
the FCC.

News for KDIC comes from
several sources. UPl provides
news on a 24 hour basis. Other
news is gotten from outside
newspapers, as well as tram
several c a m p u s reporters.
There are presently 15 people
on the news stall, which Is
headed by Martin Wiesenield
’89.

One of ‘the most important
features of the news staff is the
nightly show from 7 to a PM.
This hour, termed Special pro
grams, is devoted to topics or
Current interest. It includes in-
terviews, taped music features,
or panel discussions at impor»
tant Issues (such as the recent
ones on the grape strike and
the presentation by CBS.)

"We hope to be ﬂexible, When
Iomething important occurs on
campus, in the nation, or in the
World, we Want to do Some-
thing about it." is the reeling

enteld.

The editorial policy of the sta-
tion is decided each week by
the board of KDIC, consisting
of the Station Manager (AI
Cloud, ‘69), the News Director
Martin Wicsenfeld, ’69), the
Programming Director (Diane
Pomerance, ’69), and one other
member of the board. From
editorials submitted to the sta-
tion each week, one is chosen
and read on the air. Agree
ments or dissensions on what
was said may then he sube
mitted to' the station. Some oi
these may be read on the air.

A feeling of many persons
Involved with KDIC is ex
pitssed by Jeiirey Dunn, ‘69

but look at it only as a personal,
pragmatic way or doing their
military service."

As a 17 year old sophomore,
Duncan Wntters entered into a
scholarship contract with
ROTC. When his personal con-
siderations had come to a head
and he had solidified hls posi-
tion on the war. he requested a
release from the program. Last
spring he was called in tour
years active duty as an enlisted
man. Now 18, Walters may be
ordered into iiiiilorm any time,
alid certainly within two years.
Watters thinks that his Calirup
was at least partially political.’
His beliefs on the war and on
the “military mentality," his
military background, his pic
ferences or hair style, clothing.
and footwear were introduced
at a military investigation. He
was told by a full colonel that
his case would go all the way in
the Secretary or the Air Forte,
because ROTC had recently
been attacked in Congress as a
haven for draltrdotlgers ml that
Watters’ case was theielore po-
iitioaily sensitive,

“What bothers me about the
deiense of ROTC as voluntary
is that the services are signing
up boys too young to make ills
formed decisions on the direc-
(ions of their lives. ROTC IS it
place for dogma, ior specialized
training," continued Walters.
“A liberal arts institution is ii
place [or free inquiry."

“Even though they might not
he taught to pull triggers.”
said Waiters, “the emphasis in
ROTC is on turning oiit mana-
gers and leaders tor a machine
whose final object is to kill."
