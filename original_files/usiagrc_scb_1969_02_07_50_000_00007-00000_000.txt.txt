(Continued from Page 1)

young men are no longer inter-
ested in young women clothed or
unclothed. . .

5&3 — But it's not nudity in
a healthy sense; you go over
them five hours with makeup,
an interior decorator spends a
day on the room and tllcll you
go over the negatives with an
airbrush to remove blemishes!

Playboy — We don’t spend
quite that much time. . .

5&8 — Besides you have a
breast and ass letish that makes
for some strange poses,

Playboy s As tor the mamary
fetish, Since Hefner is the final
arbitrator on who becomes a
playmate — that’s his bag.

5&3 — All right, would you
say that Playboy has been a
leader in the “revolution in mor—
his" or has it merely kept pace
with this lucrative phenomenon?

Playboy — First and tore
most, we are a business, we
are in business to make money,
we can also spend money on
worthy causes. We have helped
pay mun expenses tor abortion
cases and have supported sex
education programs.

5&3 —— Every big business
does that. Could you tell me
how much Playboy donates to
social causes?

Playboy —- About two million
dollars.

8&3 — That’s contingent on
proﬁt isn‘t it? How much do
you make a year?

Playboy — Approximately 51/2
million dollars.

5&8 — will Playboy go into
political causes more deeply?

Playboy — We don't want to
go overboard on any one thing.

5&3 ~ I’ve noticed that Play-
boy has had only one Black play-
mate, and recently you ran a
pictorial article on Barbara Mc—
Nair in which her color was
lightened considerably more
than it is in actualityi Was that
indicative of policy?

Playboy -— No, we just can't
ﬁnd Black girls who want to
model [or us. Incidentally, the
issue that contained the Black
laid-out said very well in the
south,

saris — Another complaint 1
have is that Playboy has kept
up with the revolution in morals
only [0 a point. You have oft-
ered nu elhical solutions, For
stance what about responslbl
ity?

Playboy H The man must
take precautions We have
never advocated irresponsible
tree-love.

5&3 ‘ Okay, you mentioned
the physical problems, what
about the emotional repercus-
sions?

Playboy H Sure, a girl may
be willing 'go to bed alter too
many drinks, only to later be
faced with an emotional cri5ls.

5&3 — What about respect?

Playboy — That has to be
there.

Gray M alter

By BILL GRAY

In IM basketball this year,
most of the talent seems to have
congregated in the “A" leaguei
Scoring has not been at a very
rapid clip due to the fact that
most oi the teams play a slow
patterned offense, work for the
good shot and consider it a mor-
al victory ii a shot goes within
5' ol the basket, After having
talked to many of the players, 1
ﬁnd that their iavorite strategy
is to us the slow-down, fast»
break with an occasional hack
to keep the other team on its
toes.

Perhaps the highlight of the

SCARLET AND BLACK

season has been the emergence
of a team made up of over—age,
over - educated athletes known
Collectively as the faculty. You’d
be surprised how hard it is to
make a jump shot when Mr.
Worley shouts at you that it
can't go in because it would vio—
late the paradox oi Zeno or
when Mr. Horton tells you that
there is really nothing wrong
with getting a “C” in one or your
mom courses.

Some people still have trouble
understanding how l.M. sports
can he reacted to With such en-
thusiasm. I merely relcr you to
the social calender for this week-
End and ask Whether it looks
like something you should save
up your energy for?

Pioneer Cagers Face

N0. 1 St. Olaf Tonight

Tonight the Pioneers take on
Number one St. Olaf, 11.1 in the

didwest Conlerence. Second
place Carleton rolls into town to-
marrow While Monmouth will
visit Darby on Tuesday, closing
out a sixrgame home stand.

Tom Lower will probably re
gain the starting berth he held
earlier in the season, Bowers in-
dicated. The senior forward
Came off the bench to ram in
22 points against Florida Pres-
byterian.

Terry Holloway’s 44 points
gave him 189 in 12 games [or a
15.3 average. Scott l-lonson, who
was right hchlltd with 43 week-
end tllllles, boosts a 14.5 average
on 163 markers in ll aulillgs.
Henry Wingate IS also hitting in
double figures With a 10.7 aver
age for 12 games.

In early season road games,
the Pioneers lost all Monmouth
98779, St, Olnl 94431, and Carlton
76‘66.

Under-Rated Profs
Make ll’t‘l Title Bill

The Professors ran their IM
mark to 31 as they hlitzed
Haines Sunday night, winning
the ”A” game 48731 and the
“B" contest 4217. The hapless
Haines defenders played vali<
antly, but they were clearly
outmanned.

The Profs jubilant coach,
Terry Parssinen, flushed with
victory, entertained the team at
the Longhorn arm the game.
Parssinen seemed somewhat
bothered by the “A" team’s
sloppy play, but praised the
“B" squad eirusively. He also
threatened some player
changes it the “A" squad does
not “shape up." “Winners never
quit," Parsslnen Said, "and
quitters never win."

Attendance was again sparse,
though it was better. The Profs,
disregarded by the experts in
the pre-season pollsI now look
like they may he a contender
for the title.
