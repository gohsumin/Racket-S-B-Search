SAGA Option

By Molly McGuire

Nineteen offscarnpus seniors
will be able to cook their own
stew for tharremainder of the
year as a result of the Saga
referendum held last Tuesday.
With 64% of the student body
voting (an unusually large
turnout for a referendum), the
result was 403-290 in favor of
allowing the nineteen to forego
their board fees, although it
means paying an increase of
about $3.65 per boarder next
semester.

Another sidereffect of the op-
tion will be the necessitation
of a checking system in the
dining halls. Effective October
6, according to the rererendum,
each boarder will be required
to give his meal card number
to a checker and in some Cases
identify himseli upon entering
the dining room for each meal.

in another section of the ref-
erendum, a small majority in-
dicated they did not want more
Saga options, presumably be-
cause more options, according
to the referendum, would an-
tail showing a photo LD. card
at each meal.

But most students did vote in
favor of the college issuing
ID. cards to each student to
provide pillar of identity, age,
and student status, According
to the Student Coordinator's
Office these will be issued soon.

The business of a special fac-
ulty meeting on Monday was
“special business” — presenta-
tions by the administration

that were in some cases re- ,

quested by the faculty.

No proposals could be dis-
cussed or voted on because of
the irregular nature of the
meeting, although at one point
a proposal was made for action
on the Oct. l5 Vietnam Mora-
torium. “It couldn’t be voted
on, because this was a special
meeting,” explained Professor
John Worley (Phil), secretary
of the faculty. Also ruled out
Was discussion of the recent cona
troversial proposal for student
participation in faculty meet-
ings.

There were three items on
the agenda at Monday’s meet-
ing. “A tight money situation"
prompted‘tlie first, according
to Worley. Dean Joseph Wall's
presentation was on the ques-
tion of ways and means of cut.
ting costs and achieving a suf-
iicient level of incoming giiis
to support the current opera-
tions. Chairman of the Faculty
John Kieinschmldt commented,
“We need ways to meet the fi-
nancial problems which become
more acute with inflation and
the skittishness of potential
givers in view of tax i-eiorin."

A general proposal by Presia
dent Leggett through the facul-
ty‘s Organization Committee on

effecting ways of involving stu-
dents in curricular considera-
tions was also presented The
so-far unpublicized statement
used the words “orderly, mean-
ingful” to describe the consid-
eration or ways to involve stu.
dents.

The final agenda item was A
clarification by Dean Waldo
Walker of the current budget,
Walker, who had previously
distributed part of the budget's
details, answered questions on
the facts and interpretations or
it to the iaeulty,

The rationale for the special
meeting was partly to get these

Angered by possible indica-
tions of an aconinistration
“crackdown” on the illegal use
of drugs, some 250 students gath-
ered in front of Burling Library
late Wednesday afternoon to
protest a statement reportedly
formulated by the resident ad-
vlsers earlier in the day upon
Dean Alice LDw’s instructions.

The statement, which was
mimeographed and distributed
to students by several members
of the senate, said: “if we

President Glenn Leggett said
Thursday afternoon, “Things are
at the status quo."

“By status quo, ! mean before
Dean Low told the resident ad~
visers Whatever she told them,"
the president continued “I
think the status quo was basic-
ally that resident advisers we"
looked upon as counselors.”

Leggeft, who was out of town
when Dean Low issued instruc-
tions to the resident advisers on
Wednesday, said he will issue a
statement on the resident od-
visers‘ role in the drug policy
“after I have talked to many
more people."

He added that he wants every-
one to “calm down and talk
rationally” about the situation.
