DRAFT DODGER' S GUIDE TO EUROPE

By DAVID SALTMAN

COPENHAGEN, Derb
mark (CPS) -—- In the middle
of October, two three-loot sup-
ply rockets landed in the Us.
Army Compound in West Eer—
lin to disgorge thousands of
leaflets addressed to the 5,000
American soldiers garrisoned
there. They gave advice on
how to avoid sen/ice in Viet-
nam and ended:

“We olier you refuge in Can-
ada, Sweden, or Denmark. if
you have a chance to spend a
weekend on leave in Denmark,
ring the following telephone
numbers. . ."

On May 28 Dutch National
Television claimed over 500
US. soldiers stationed in
Europe had deserted.

Gen. James Polk, Com-
mander—in-Chief oi the US.
Army in Europe and ol the
U.S. seventh Army said there
has been no rise in the number
of American desertions in re-
cent months.

On August 17 the London
TIMES said in a special re~
port that “more than 1,000
American servicemen stationed
in Europe are expected to de-
lert this year.”

Then Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara described
the Times’ story as “sheer non-
nonsense.”

What's going on?
POSITIVELY E00 DESERTERS

“I can say positively that
there have been at, least 600
desertions irom the American
Army in Europe this year.
There are male to come,"
btated Poul Nexmand, the sec-
retary of the Danish affiliate of
the War Registers’ Internation-
ll.

“It is impossible to give an
exact number (of deserters)
because they are being pro-
tected by several organizations
in all the Western European
countries," added an official 0!
a radical Danish youth organi-
lotion.

The Danish minister of jus-

tice will grant residence per—
mits to American refugees “as
long as they don't make too
much nuise," the otlicial atlde
ed. “At present there are 25
American political refugees in
Copenhagen alone — desertels
and draft resisters.

'There is a bill now under
study in the Danish Parlia-
ment which will almost auto—
matically grant American de~
setters asylum in Denmark.

Since the Danish hill hasn't
passed yet, American soldiers
who want to desert for politi-
cal reasons are advised to go
to Sweden. France, Canada or
Algeria, according to an offi-
cial of the Danish Socialist
Peoples' Party.

Follr American sailors who
jumped ship in Japan to pro-
test the Vietnam war have
been granted political asylum
in Sweden. Canada’s position
is well known. France grants
similar political asylum; A1-
geria treats American relu-
gees like heroes.

A man known as “Mr. Cook"
is the head of the French de-
serter network. He says that
every European country has
active groups who will look
alter American deserters and
get them to neutral countries.
DESERTION MOTIVES VARY

Pacifist groups and radical
organizations realize that de-
sertion isn't always for politi-
cal reasons.

“We don’t care," comment-
ed Knud Jensen, 3 Danish ac<
tivist who handles desertion
cases. “of course we would
like to have a deserter who is
a Marxist. you know, but it is
enough to show the American
people that their army isn't
holy."

The international Herald
Tribune reported last summer
that deserters were only
granted assistance after they
signed a statement against the
Vietnam war. Danish authori—
ties repudiated the Trlbuno
statement.

merchants,” said one authority
in Copenhagen. “This is ahso
lutely false. if any soldier
wants to desert, or if any
American wants to avoid con»
scription, we will help him
with no conditions attached.
Any soldiers who wish to de-
sert should call me in Copen-
hagen.”

DESERT WHILE 0N LEAVE

Would-be deserters have a
number of ways to get off
their bases and into neutral
countries.

Gordon Mepham, 28, told re-
porters that he had deserted
last August in Vietnam by vol-
unteering for extra service.
This entitles a U.S. soldier to
30 days leave anywhere in the
world.

Mepham went to England
and told the press that he “did
not intend going back to Viet-
nam,"

“I know of many other sol-
diers who have deserted and
come to Britain," he added.

Soldiers stationed in Europe
can simply get a weekend pass,
hop on the Friday night train
to Copenhagen, and he assured
of full protection by dinner-
time Saturday.

if they haven't arranged
proper asylum in Denmark he.
forehand, they can be hustled
on a night boat to Sweden
where they will be safe.

It a deserter wants to go to
France, it is slightly more
ticklish. Though the French
have withdrawn from NATO —
and thus are not required to
return deserters to us. forces
— they are still nominal Amer-
ican allies.

A deserter in France is usuv
ally put up in a town with it
strong Left. The groups pro-
tecting him, using the leveraga
of the Left in the countryside,
negotiate for a residence per-
mit. Paris quietly grants the
permit, on the condition the
refugee keeps his mouth shut.

PRETTY GIRLS,

BARS BEST CONTACTS

"it is really quite simple to
contact the soldiers. A name
and phone number written on a
lavatory wall, a pamphlet, a
sympathizer in a place used
often by Gl's,” Denmark’l
Nexn'land noted.

“We have n couple of pretty
girls who speak excellent Eng-
lish, and we send them down
to the railway station to pass
out leaﬂets and talk I0 sol-
diers,“ szld Nexmand.

“We also have a sympathizer
who works in one of the bars
for American soldiers. l-lo
gives out our phone number to
anyone who seems interested,"
he continued.

"lnmdentally, we have n lot

Nexmand added. There is an

RADIO STATIC

The campus radio station—
in fetal stages last semester—
is expected to begin broadcast-
ing by February.

Personnel Director Albert
Cloud said they wuldn’t start
because the equipment hadn’r
arrived. The equipment, he in-
dicated, was not in because at
confusion over whether the do
nor -— the owner of Falrchild
Electronics — would be supply-
ing the money or the equipment.

Money for all but the trans-
mitter and the antenna, is being
supplied by Fairchild. The equip»
ment, purchased from Gates
and Allied Electronics, has been
placed on order and is expected
to arrive “any time now — to-
morrow, or the next day, or the
next,” says station manager
Eabak Armajani.

The transmitter and antenna
were gifts of Grinneil trustee
Robert Noyce. Noyce happens
to be Vice President oi Fair-
child Camera and Instrument
Inc,

Records for the station, EC-
cordlng to Cloud, have gener-
ally been donated by the record
companies. An SGA budget of
$1000 annual operating expenses
may also be used toward the
purchase oi records.

Armajani says that there are
over 200 record albums in the
library at present, and “an
infinite number of 45's."

A dozen office chairs and I
big table arrived last Friday.
The reason that furniture had
not arrived until now, says
Cloud, is “we couldn’t order un-
til we had the money. Now."

DANGERS lN
PHONY PAMPHLETS

There are dangers, of course,
since American ofﬁcials don’t
take all this too happily. There
is also on intriguing suspicion
here that the CIA is publishing
leaﬂets which advise soldiers
to desert, but gives them (also
contacts.

The soldiers calls a number
in Copenhagen and says, “i
want to desert," The voice on
the other end says "Okay,
where are you? We‘ll
come and pick you up.” The
guy says “I’m at such-and.
suc ,” and in 15 minutes he's
in jail.

The CIA suspicion started
when some radical students in
aerlin picked up some of the
pamphlets they had distributed
to US. soldiers. They found
some with altogether new
phone numbers and addresses
listed as contacts.

“We're not sure, of course,"
lays Poul Nexmand. “I mean,
it could be a proctlcal joke by
men irom outer space.”
