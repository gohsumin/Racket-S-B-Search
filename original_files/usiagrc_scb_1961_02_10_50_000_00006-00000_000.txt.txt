Backus Sees Greece

Cont. from 11. 2

stopped again. i saw, to my hor-
ror, that I had taken thewrong
bus, and hadn’t any idea where
I was. My Greek failed at this
point, giving way to various ex—
clamations of surprise, shock and
strong disapproval. His English
also gave way, so he iust stared.

At that point, a warm voice
said, “I speak a little English.
May 1 help?" Turning. i saw a
large woman, tightly holding-
her unmbrella against the storm.
I left the bus to explain my
story to her, and as i was
speaking to her, it left. She sawl
by disappointment, and told me
not to worry. I was quite near
the college, although it would be
impossible to go in the rain, as
l was aheady soaked. "So," she
smiled broadly, “you‘ll conic
home with me: You’ll stay with
my family tonight and tumor—
ro\v~well, we’ll see.” ,

My feeble protests were]
ignored as she marched me to
the flat that was home, shout.
ing ahead to the family to stop
quarreling—she was bringing a
”kathigit'is” (teacher) with her.
Soaked, exhausted and bewild-_
cred, I entered the small home
to find myself enjoying tradi—
tional Greek hospitality, begin-
ning with a preserved fruit, a
small cup of strong Greek Cafr‘
fee and the standard questions,‘
“Where me you irom?”—“Howi
old are you?"—and “Are you
married?” A rather hectic in—,
troduction to Mrs. Diktiopoulos
and her family.

Near Anatolia college is any
other American school which
was described in the Reader’s
Digest (Sept. 1960) in an article
entitled, “They‘re Helping
Greeks to Help Themselves” (I,
think that was the title, any}
way) and one of the students
there is Kostas (short forKon-
stantinos) Koprantzellas. I met
him while visiting English class

 

girl from a neighboring school,
from the same town, and was to
meet this girl and go there.

indignantly refused to believe
that my loyal friend Kostas
would lie to me, so called him
two days later, He was not at the
Farm school. Didn’t I know? He
left for Sarrai two days earlier.

1 spent a delightful Christmas
vacation plotting the best way
to get revenge for this insult.
When the students came back, 1
was rudely awakened by one of
the college boys beating on my
door at 7:30 am. to tell me 1
had a phone call. It was still dark
(I for-got 1 had pulled the cur»
tains the night before), so l told
the student to take the message.
He returned to tell me a stu-
dent from he Farm school had
called, named Kostas, “What?”
1 roared. “At this hour? What
did he want?” ”Sir, he says he
sends you his greetings.” An exs
tremely rare phenomenon fol—
lowed this: J was speechless.

I saw Kostas about three
days later, and then by chance,
since I had gone to visit John
Minatsios. Smiling broadly as
usual,, Kostas came in and
tried to think of something
to say. Finding nothing, he
just smiled, although a little
less strongly.

Finally the suspense was more
than 1 could stand, and I asked
how his Christmas was. He an.
swered so quickly that I pur-
sued the topic in mind, and ask.
ed about his girl friend. With a
look combining hurt and shock,
he asked what girl i meant. No,
he had gone home alone. 1 rec
minded him he left at 2:00,

meeting her at the station, and‘

got to Serrai at 5:00. But. . .g 1?
He couldn’t remember any girl
I could mean. Of course, he had
been with his cousin,

At this point.l broke out in
laughter at his unabashed lies,
and told him that both he and

For four years this column has
neglected its job of reporting the

ter issue, the Cowlcs eagle
(when not in Lake Acre or lee

ed in victory and excused in der

bicle in Cowles, seeking the coui»
age to write an objective columni
when the ghost of Jerry Gray
rose up before me, clothed in a
laded Cowles sweatshirt. saying,
"The whole world is fruit." This
bit of wisdom led me to realize
the error of my thinking. The
torch of chauvinism has thus
'been passed on once again. I
only hope 1 may be able to do
considerably more acclaiming
than excusing.

After two weeks of play, the
basketball picture is still a bit
muddled. Cowles, the defending
champion, is currently ilndefieat»

to see a Greece I rarely see.

The night before the students,
left, I was attending a Christmas
program at the Farm school and
told Kostas when i would come,
He, instead of being happy about
going home, sadly told me that
he wouldn‘t be going to Serrai,
but had to spend the entire Vaca-i
tion at the Farm school making‘
up days he was absent.

Apart from my own disap.
pointment x was very sorry for
Realms and angry at the laws
which make a student miss his
family at Christmas, and, in an
effort to make him happier, I
asked him to come to the col-
lege for lunch one day.

The next day as lwas walking,
back to the college with another-l
friend, John Mintsios, l expound
ed at some length on the in»
justice being dealt, and was sure
prised at a confused look on hisi
lace, and then, laughter. it
thought perhaps he misunder-i
stood me or my faulty Greel(,l
and repeated my comments more‘
slowly. When i got the same reel
action, l knew that l was the;
one with the problem of lacking ;
information. John asked who toldl
me this, and when I told him;
that it was Kostas himself, he
tried, unsucessfully, to change
the subject. l

Finally the truth came out;
Kostas was leaving at 0 that
very afternoon for Serrai andl
hod no intention of making up;
his days. It seems that he had aI

many who still consider the
acts of a government as sep

religion.

But, Rabbi Rosenthal conclude

signs that the millenium may

l
lCouncil
,Cont. from p. l

by the social coordinating co
mittee.

Shipley’s motion was impor—
tant. too, because in approving
it, the Council overrode a ino-
tion that it had passed sev-
eral weeks ago to send all
concert requests back to the
halls for their approval. How-
ever, because Shipley empha—
sized the lack of time avail-
able to contact Miss meson,
and because of the superb
reputation which Miss Russell
enjoys, a majority of the Coun—
cil‘s members felt the motion
important enough to pass. The
vote on the motion was 16-7.

In the early part of the even
ing, various reports were hear
by the Council.

SC President Duane Krohnk
reported that the social coordin
sting committee, in a ineetin
on Monday, had defeated the mo
tion made and passed in th

Council that salaries for mem

bers of the social calendar com
mittee be abolished. The you
was eight against and seven fo
and among those in favor wer
the SC president, CofHP presi
dent, AWS board president anr
‘social coordinator.

Kenneth Christiansen, faculty
adviser to the Student Council
gave additional information con
cerning the junior comprehen
sive examinations to he give
next year. These exams, he said
will definitely be required a
all juniors and will count t
credits if passed.

A grade, such as is given in
all college courses, will be re-
corded on each individual's rca
cord. The credits will be given
to encourage each student to
prepare for these exams as
adequately as for my other
course.

Gary Thurston, chairman ol
the mechanics committee for th
constitutional convention,

cussed some of the problem
that are still being experience-
with the constitution. Foremos

 

tained in that document, yet
they will be voting for or a—
gainst its ratification next Mane
lday. He urged all students to
.,study it carefully; copies have
,been placed in all the halls.

SQ also approved a report
made by Peg Sutley, chairman
of the committee on academic
affairs, in which she asked for
the “gn»a'head" to make a study
of the humanities and historical
studies courses as they are now

being given at Grinnell. This re-
port, which will be presented to
lthe faculty committee in charge
‘of these courses, will be given
to every sophomore and fresh—

inlan by the end ‘of this year.
