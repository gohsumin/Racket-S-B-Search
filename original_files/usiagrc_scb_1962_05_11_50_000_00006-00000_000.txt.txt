The score stood knotted at 6-6

got an iniield hit to the mound,
and 'chk lMitIclbttsher, the Pio-

neer pitcher who had come on;
in the seventh in reliei of Cole
tier, re-injured his knee on the
play. He stayed in to pitch to
the next batter who hunted Ior

Chris Sprung was then called
in from third to put out the tire.
After getting a force at third,
Sprung walked a batter With
the bases loaded Sprung got the
