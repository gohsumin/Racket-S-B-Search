Senate. As outlined, the program is entirely voluntary iii

words any hall or student not I isbing‘ to talie part in the
program, has the right to abstain. No hall has tlle light to
make hall membership contingent upon part )ation in
this program.

niciuicd a program to the Senat

discussed before next Wednesda
when the Student Senate arrive
at a final de I'sion. In the mean
time. a poll will be taken on Sat

on campus who has any kind 0
an opinion on orientation to par
ticlpate in the poll.

to know for certain the prevalen
