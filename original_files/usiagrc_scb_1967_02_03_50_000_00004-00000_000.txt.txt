in our stance toward the
civilization of our students we
cannot escape standing for
something, even if that some-
thing may turn out to lie
nothing. But we can take
some comfort in the fact that
on the problems of student
culture we are in the fore-
front, and that only first-
rate institutions appear to
share it with us. it speaks
to the essential quality of
our students and the faculty
that attracts them . . .

In this environment we
cannot say, as some academi-
cians do, that free experience
is a valuable educative pro-
cess and then lock ourselves
in our private studies.

Nor can we say, as some
outsiders do, that tougher
rules and stricter enforce-
ment will “straighten the lita
tle rascals out," to use the es.
pence of their words.

We live in an environment
that our attitude helps to
make, and its results are vie
this, growing human beings.

or doctrinail'e about, and I

New Environment

Effective ways of improving
the environment involve a
number of things. One neceSc
sity is to improve our inherited
physical structure — by reno-
vations, by new buildings. by
new arrangements. Another
necessity is to discuss and re-
fine or even change our pres-
ent rule structure against the
background of a rational and
philosophic position — a pro-
cess that cannot be accom-
plished overnight but must be
gin immediately if we are to
get ourselves out of this series
of constant emergencies and

confrontations. Still another is-

for all of us to admit that the
decision-making in any aca-
demic community will always
be a somewhat painful one for
all of us, but particularly so in
an institution like this one
where we cherish not a ma-
chine-like efficiency but the ed-
ucational virtues (and delays)
of discussion, consultation, con-
sensus, and process.

Let me speak more specifi-
cally, in late November of last
year, your Senators presented

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

a proposal on “women’s hours”
to the Facility Conuliittee on
Student Affairs. Within the
period of 30 academic days al-
loted to it, this committee has
reviewed the proposal, suggest-
ed certain changes, and for-
warded it to me. The conclud~
ing recommendation of the
committee is as follows:

The Committee is recom-
mending m the President of
the College that the College,
contingent on workable solu-
tions to the problems out-
lined above, require no he
deuce hall “hours" for wom-
en students. Because the
Committee feels some confi-
dence that the problems can
be met, or at least that rea-
sonable answers to the prob-
lems will be in sight by the
end of the second semester
of the 1966-67 academic year,
it proposes September of
1967 as the earliest realiza-
tion of the elimination of
women’s hours.

Submit to Trustee!

According to the Procedural
Regulations in the student
Handbook, 1 have all days in
which to make a recommenda-
tion about the proposal to the
Board of Trustees, which shall
take final action at its next
regularly scheduled meeting,
provided that notice of the pro.
gosed modification is received

y its members at least so
days prior to that meeting.

The aorday notification re-
quirement means that formal
action by the trustees on the
proposal will not be possible
until the spring meeting, which
is scheduled for late May. But
the trustees will be here this
weekend and i expect to dis-
cuss the proposal with them
and arrive at some informal de-
terminations. In keeping with a
practice 1 established last fall,
I shall ask several students (to
be recommended to me by Mr.
Kent) to lunch privately with
the trustees, ,the discussion
topic to be determined by the
students. i assume Mr, Kent
will nominate his most per-
suasive classmates and that the
matter of women’s hours will
be central to the discussion. In
the meantime, i expect to dis-
cuss the proposal with mem-
bers of the Faculty Executive
Council, to send copies to in-
dividual faculty members for
their comment, and to deter-
mine what recommendation
about the proposal i shall pre-
scnt to the trustees. Quite
frankly, my recommendation to

the trustees will be influenced
by what I hear from the E»
ecutive Council of the Faculty,
from the faculty at large, from
the deans and the members of
the Committee on Student Af<
fairs, and of course from stu-
dents themselves. The ami-
ability and constructive lia-
turc of the discussion will also
have their effect. At the ino-
ment, 1 have concerns about
some aspects of the proposal-
its range, its implementation,
and its implications for our
whole social structure, but at
the minimum, i expect to take
an affirmative attitude on the
matter of some liberalization
in women’s hours with the
trustees this weekend.

Workable System

In its proposal to me, the
Faculty Committee on student
Affairs speaks at some length
about the firm expectations
and conditions which the col-
lege believes to be prerequisites
to a successful realization of a
workable system of unrestrict-
ed hours for women. The pro-
posal remarks about privacy.
overcrowding, the need for
more recreation and lounge
space. It also remarks about
the need for a \velirunderstood
agreement on the role of resi-
dent advisers, house presidents
and house councils and how
they relate to one another in
the process of improving and
maintaining residence hall life
and dealing with the disruption
of it. The proposal also exA
presses a concern about the un-
resolved "open rooms" ques-
tion, saying as follows:

Perhaps most closely re
lated to the practical aspects
of thc elimination of wom-
en’s hours are the still un-
resolved differences of opin-
ion on coeducational use of
dormitory rooms. Only with
a careful review of our pres-
ent "open dorms" policy can
we hope to dispel the existing

atmosphere of contention
and distrust, and the Com-
mittee expects to have a full
discussion and rcview of the
entire "open dorms" question

and to make definite rec-
ommendations by the end of
this semester.

"Open Dorms" Question

Now, a full discussion of the
entire “open dorms" question
ought not to take place in an
adverse climate in which
either-or confrontations dic-
tale the strategy. This uneasy
climate is likely to continue
until we deal with the center of
it, not just the edges. It seems
to me that at the center are
some large, unresolved prob-
lems about fundamental college
positions _ specifically on sex
ual behavior, or drinking, or
the range and limits of student
government. As you will dia-
cover when you see the pro-
posal, this concern about ir-
resolutions on major issues is
reflected by the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs in
dealing with the matter of
women's hours, which in itself
seems the relatively simple
matter of recognizing that
women are as responsible as
men about the apportionment
of their time. In this instance,
the concern of the committee
does not prevent its recom.

mendation that, given certain
Conditions, the proposal of
women’s hours is workable.
But on the matter of “open
rooms,” the workability of any
proposal depends not simply
on the responsibility of indi-
vidual students but on (2
Whole milieu of student civili-
zation.

"Position" Papers

Accordingly, I wish you to
begin now to work out a sys-
tem of consultation with your-
selves, with representative fac—
ulty, and with the deans so
that we can develop what we
might call “position” papers on
the proper and realistic stance
of the College on the questions
of sexual behavior, on drink-
ing, and on student govern-
ment. We have the drug state»
ment of last year to provide us
with something of a model, Po-
sition papers, as I choose to
call them. do not of course
eliminate all problems; the hu-
man condition cannct be cir-
cumscribed by print, But posi-
tion papers. if they are honest
and dignified, can give all of
us the security of knowing
where individual rights end
and college concerns begin. 1
think we ought to begin this
process of consultation and
writing at once. i am not going
to ask the deans to call you to-
gether and provide the im<
petus. You have a consulta-
tive process of your own and i
am going to ask you to involve
the deans and faculty in it.
What comes out finally must
be the position of the College,
not just the point of view of
separate constituencies, Until
this is accomplished, i am per-
suaded that the matter of
"open rooms" should be kept
at the status quo; that is. open
houses Sunday afternoons, and
in connection with a limited
number of lounge and house
parties.

Pledge of Faith

I ask for your cooperation
and good faith on this matter,
and l pledge you mine. If you
will invite me, i would like to
return every two or three
weeks with comments and prog-
ress reports and listen, in
turn, to yours. 1 have no de-
sire to fasten an authoritative
code of behavior on the Col-
lege. I desire only that our ac-
tions reflect the moral values
the College believes inherent
in the study of the liberal arts.
These values are many, and in-
terpretations and definition of
them will vary, but those most
pertinent to this discussion are
selflessness, social responsibili»
ty, a preference for excellence
and quality in ideas. people
and actions and, much more
generally. the strength of char-
acter necessary to resist per-
sonal conduct which is destruc-
tive of any of the ideas which
study in the arts and sciences
demonstrate to be good. I re-
fer here to such things as hon-
esty (both public and private),
compassion, reverence for
life, an awareness of the gen.
eral advantages of order over
chaos and so on. There is not a
course of study in the College,
nor is there an extracurricular
activity, which does not try, in
some way or other, to demon-
strate the normative value of
these things and things like
them.

In saying this I don’t mean
to ignore or excuse the fact
that these values are some-
