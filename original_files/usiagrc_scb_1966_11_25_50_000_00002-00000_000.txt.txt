To the Editor, and that self—
styled North Campus spokes-
man who refuses to grant us
even the authority of his own
name:

We are glad to see that
there are members 01 this cams
pus who are mature enough to
accept restrictions which apply

ot to themselves, but to others.

2 do have several pertinent
questions:

1. of whose Well-being are
you speaking? Only the men’s,
or that of the entire campus.

2. Are the women of South
Campus responsible for your
well-being to the extent that
they should be penalized for
your immaturity?

3. Does the “some of us"
who are "incapable of hand-
ling unlimited Ireedom” re-
fer to the entire campus, or
men only?

4. As you are so willing to
accept with maturity restric-
tions placed on others, could
you with equal maturity ac»
cept the same restrictions up-
on yourself? Graduated men’s
hours?

Gran-led a plan for graduated
hours may be the best, because
it would allow students to as
rume responsibility gradually as
they reach definitions of Iheu‘
“social and moral standards."
We agree that the question of
“illicit moral behavior" should
not be the only guideline in tie»
termining miles both workable
and conducive to the develop
ment of this maturity.

We are not asking the col<
legs to “cater to the demands
of students who seek an en-
vironment where they can
practice their brand of freedom
without regards to the need of
students who one not prepared
for such a step." What we are
seeking is an environment
which will encourage the de-
velopment of mature, reasoned
behavior, rather than behavior
iii-bitrarily imposed by external
regulations.

Your suggestion of “a means
by which special permission
may he obtained to (occasion-
Illy) stay out beyond hours” is
already available when a plans
had activity is being undertaken
and such plans are made known
to specified authorities before
the fact. This plan does not take
into account such unexpected
contingencies as counseling_ a
friend under emotional or in-
ullectual stress, coed Studying
iifter hours, etc.

You may have some valid
points to make and you may be

eading in a constructive dimer
tion. it so, the tone of your
letter is both inappropriate
and one sided: it tends to block
communication rather than en~
courage it.

Thanks for the compliment.
If your letter was written
"tonguesinrcheek" we apologize
However, if such is the case,
the misunderstanding is a re
suit of your writing, rather than
our reading,

Makes Proposal

To the Edito .
The following is a short piece

submitted to the Executive
Cabinet at the all-students meet-
ing, November 22.

l have a proposal to make.
First of all, I am assuming that
we want action on the long
range issues of open dorms,
abolition of the faculty com-
mittee on student aflairs, and
increased student participation
in college policy. in accordance
with this assumption I disagree
with the proposed method of
action, namely the executive
cabinet sit-ill. lt is a very dras
tic stcp to take. We are playing
all our cards at once and we
are breaking a rule. if our
move tails our lawlessness will
be criticized by everyone. And
because there is little organiza~
tion of the student body as a
whole, our move will he likely
to fail. Because this action has

seemed virtually spontaneous lo
the student body, many will
hold back for [ear of “rushing
into things" and “going too
for.” Certainly the faculty will
be alarmed. The advantages of
orgauitation in this case out-
weigh the advantages of press
ing for our demands during a
period when martyr sympathy
runs high.

Therefore, I propose a step
by step process organized and,
lawful and rational. By escalat-
ing our methods of protest one
step at a time we solidify stu-
dent unity and we give the ad-
ministration time to think the
issue over. We give them an
opportunity to save face and
agree with us. Right now we
are backing them into a corner.

I propose the following tenta-
tive step by step plan:

. Petition

. Resolution by the Senate

. Personal appeal by the
Senate to the President

. Executive cabinet sitrin

. Campus sit-in

. Resignation by

officers

We can decide to make the
steps different. That can be
decided in deliberation later.
My main point is that we ought
to organize our movement realr
ist‘irally with some chance of
success.

This proposal was made Wed-
nesday night. Now that the ac-
tion has been taken, however,
I find that as a student I must
support the executive cabinet
and senate in their goals and
activities. Nevertheless I urge
that concrete plans he iormu-
lated with long range goals in
mind.

invalid Generalizations

Last Friday night, a professor told me that I
should be ashamed. I asked him, "Ashamed for
what?" The reply was, "Ashamed for that col-
umn you wrote in today’s 5&3." Well, I thought
about it, I did, and I finally had to agree with
him. Doggone if, I an. ashamed. The grammar
was terrible wasn’t it? The paragraphs didn’t
flow easily, did they? Yes, i am ashamed that
it was badly written. But I’m not ashamed be-
cause I wrote it. As a matter of fact, far from
being ashamed for my column, I am ashamed
for my school. I am ashamed that I have been
here so long and not become ashamed of this
school until now. Yes, by God, I’m ashamed.

So, now, “Why", you ask. Happy to oblige, of
course. There have been a great many things
said about the administration, what it’s doing,
what it’s not doing, and What it should do. My
question is now, “Has the school been acting in
conscience?” I wonder if this school has any
conscience at all. You continue to kick out the
most worthwhile and keep the most worthless
people; you maintain standards that are antiqu-
ated and expect the student to remain quiet and
go blithely about his business; you push onto

spirits.

our student leaders the responsibilities for seeing
the school function well, and watch the best ones.
the ones who try, crumble under the load, from
student government to the campus publications.
And the student who is imaginative, inventivo
and is willing to take on responsibility (which ho
can do only by inventing it at this school) doesn't
get much of a chance to stay here. As usual, a few
people do all the work. This school had better
decide whether it wants its students to read book.
or learn how to live.

Perhaps 1 did speak late in my column last week
about an issue that was already a matter of
policy decision, but even if late, at least 1 spoke.
That is one better than most of the people on this
campus. Sometimes I can’t believe you’re really
out there, you’re so silent. I'm afraid, though,
that I Can’t be blithe about this school. But let
me change something, Before, I said that l was
ashamed for my school. But I don't want to he
a martyr; I won’t shoulder the blame for what
this school does. The shame is on you, of you; i
am ashamed of you. So if you are out there, let’s
hear from you. I’m tired of a school full of blithe

leMoyne Applicants Needed

By, KRYS NEU'MAN

Students interested in particl-
pating in the exchange next se-
mester with LoMoyne College,
Memphis, Tennessee, s h o u l d
Contact Richard Winters (Asso-
ciate Dean of the College) by
next Wednesday, November an.

In a recent 8&3 survey, stu-
dents who have already partial-
pated in the program and cam-
pus administrators who have
been involved in its planning an-
swered questions about what a
Grinnell student should expect
in going to LeMoyne for a se-
mester and mode suggestions as
to desirable attributes for the
exchange 5 Lude n t. (LeMoyne
was also included in this sur-
vey, but its response was too
slight to be considered repl‘e»
senthtive.)

Responses to the survey indi-
outed dissatisfaction with the
selection process in the past.
Winters, present head of the
program on this campus, says
that not enough students apply
for the exchange to allow for
competitive selection. Last year
he had to recruit students up to
the last minute. Few men ap-

Perry Named To
Admissions Post

The appointment of Tracy B,
Perry as a Grinnell College ad-
missions counselor has been
announced by President Glenn
Leggett.

Perry, who joined the Grin.
nell admissions stafl NOV. I4,
will work principally in laws
and Illinois.

A graduate of the Nichols
School in Buffalo, N.Y., and
llebron Academy in Hebron,
Me., Perry received a B.A. de-
gree from Middlebury College
in 1961. He has done graduate
worn at the University of Var»
mom and the University of
Buffalo and has also Studied at
the Goethe Institute in Ger-
many.

Perry has held a position in
industry in Buffalo for the past
year.

plied and only one was sent to
LeMoyne with four women.
These students felt it bad policy
to send only one male.

it was also suggested in the
survey response that Grinnell is
only sending its “safe” students
— that less emphasis should be
put on accepting students with
good grades and more on those
who stand out socially, in ex.
tracurricular a C t i V l t i e s or
through a special talent.

Although one participant felt
that a special talent might
cause those around him to stand
in awe, and, therefore, create
barriers to friendship, the others
considered a talent quite useful.

One respondent suggested,
“Why don’t they send someone
controversial who would be
missed? Send someone who is
public in his way of life. He
should be one who is actively
e god in extracurricular ac<
f as on campus — in the
newspaper, drama, art, for ex;
ample. If he is the type of per-
son who stimulates those around
him here, he may do so also at
Lelvtoyne and at Grinnell again
when he comes back. More
people will gain from his expe-
rience."

The respondents generally
agreed that grades should be
either a secondary consideras
tion in accepting exchange stu-
dents or should be judged only
on a par with social attributes.
The ability to meet and get
along with people was greatly
emphasized.

One student proposed that an
applicant with less than a ‘0”
average should he considered if
other worthwhile activities were
prohibiting him from attaining
higher grades.

The qualities of sincerity,
maturity and motivation were
usually the first to be recom-
mended by those questioned.
One Student stated, “Dissatis
faction with Grinnell should not
he the major motivation.”

It was also the predominant
opinion that primary motiva<
tion for applying should be the
desire for a different cultural
experience and for the under—
standing that grows out of it.

Dale Terry (Registrar), who
helped [0 put the LeMoyne prcls
gram into effect several years
ago, mentioned that a semester
at LeMoyne should particuiar-
ly concern Lhose students inter-
ested in or majoring In the so-
cial sciences.

There was a difference of
opinion as to whether the ex-
change program should neces-
sarily affect the wider campus
community or whether its pur-
pose should be limited to that of
individual experience and gain.

One participant Said, “The im-
portant and unique thing about
the program is that it is a stu-
dent exchange, and Gzinnell
students go there as student:
and friends, not as reformers,
lecturers, crusaders.” This ra-
sponse went on to state, "I per-
sonally felt that I received more
than I gave to the program."

Another approach was that
the exchange “wastes opportu-
nity” when the available “di-
versity of background and expo-
n'ence is not shared on an ‘in-
stitutional Ievel'.” F u r t h e r
(from a different response), the
opinion was held that exchange
students should be involved in
the larger Memphis community.
This former exchange student
listed groups on the LeMoyno
Campus itself which provide in-
roads into such involvement.

Those who were of the opinion
that the exchange should have
a broader, rather man merely
individual, effect generally did
not feel this had been accom-
plished as the program now
stands.

Although one respondent said
that the exchange prevents stu-
dents from taking courses or-
taxed at Gn'nnell that they spe-
cifically want, the others em-
phasized that the experience it-
self is much more important
than classwork he might take
that semester.

When asked how graduate
schools View a student’s semes-
ter away from Grinnell on the
LeMoyne program, Mr, Terry
Said they don’t consider it det-
rimental to be involved in such
a program even though it means
interrupting the Grlnnel] course
of study.
