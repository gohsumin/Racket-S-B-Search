ances, at 7:30 and 9:15 both
nights, are open to the public,
but tickets must be obtained at
the Alumni Offices in advance,
due to the limited size of the
Arena Theater.

Although written in the typi-
cal realistic mode of the con-
temporary Russian th e ate r.
which necessarily retlects cer-
tain Socialistic tenets, “In
Search oi Happiness" contains
“a certain universal depth and
humanness to the characters,”
according to director Heligott.
Except for references to the
Communist Youth Organization,
which could make an easy tran-
sition to a Western counterpart
like the Boy Scouts, the play in
tact has very little to contine
it to its locality, and still less
that can be construed as pmpa<
ganda.

In his introduction, the play-

wright expresses his intention®

as “to sound an alarm, to warn
people against rash steps in
liie, for when all is said and
done we all want happiness in

While Devil Coffee

Malcolm Nelson, Department
of English, Will Chair a coffee
hour discussion of The White
Devil at 4 P.M., October 25, in
the South Lounge of the Forum.

The While Devil is a drama
about a sixteenth century law
case involving a series of com-
plex murders. it will be pre-
sented on a modern stage in
modern dress. Performance is
scheduled for 4 PM. and 9:30,
October 29, in Roberts Theater.

Mr. Nelson expressed belief
that a discussion in advance
might enhance a student’s ap-
preciation oi the play. The un-

, derstanding motivation or some
of the characters is especially
important in the understanding
of the play, he said.

attempt to dramatize the dis-

happiness, Ruzov presents a

The main conﬂict of the play,

Considering that the play in—
troduces a cast of 14 in its hour
and a half span, the charac-
ters are remarkably clear and
interesting. Heligm has angli-
cizetl some of the names to cut
down on the contusion in iden-
tilying so many characters in
so short a time.

As a prelude to the play, a
panel discussion on the Russian
theater took place Tuesday alt-
ernoon in South Lounge. Some
concern was expressed then

about audience reaction to the @

alien vocabulary that crops up
occasionally in the script. Since
the play is not blatant political
propaganda but a serious
drama at human values, it is
important that the audience not
be put oit by such phrases as
“When communism is estab-
lished . ” Richard D. Meyer,
director of the Grinnell Thea-
ter, reiterated his confidence in
the Sophistication of the Grin—
nell audience.

The play centers around a
family in Moscow, consisting of
three sons and a daughteri The
eldest son, Theodore (Frederick
Schwaller) and his Wife Helen
(Deborah Abbott) are living
temporarily with the iamily un-
til they find Iheit‘ own “Hat."

and the adolescent son Victor
(Dick Hertz), who writes poetry
and loves fish. At the end of
the second act Helen and Theo-
dore move away [rpm the fam-
ily Theodore. once a promis—
lng young scientist, has been
corrupted by his Wife's domi-
nance and materialism. The
play is not very good literature
or theater and tends heavily to—
ward the sentimental. How

ever, it is interesting as an ex- ‘

ample of modern Russian
drama, and Heligott’s presenta»
tion looked Very promising in
rehearsal.
