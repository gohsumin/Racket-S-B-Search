Experience Qualifies Richard Nixon
For Top National Leadership in '64

By John Tepasko

Richard Milhous Nixon was
born January 9, 1913 and grew
up in the community of Whit-
tier, California, Where his par-
ents ran a combination filling
station-grocery store, A ft e r
graduating from high school,
he went on to work his way
through Whittier College. He
graduated second in his class
in 1934. He was awarded a
scholarship to Duke University

NIXON

Law School, and in 1937 re-
ceived his L. Li D. degree.

He returned to California to
gactice law with a firm in

hittier for five years During
this period he married Patricia
Ryan, an attractive Whittier
school teacher. Nixon left the
Whittier law firm to become a
member of the legal staff of
the office of Price Administra-
lion in Washington.

After five months Wiﬂh O. P.
A, he was commissioned in the
Navy as a lieutenant, serving
in the South Pacific for 13
months with the Combat Air
Transportation He earned two
battle stars and two commen-
dations.

In 1946 Nixon was elected
congressman from his district
in California. During his first
year in Congress he spent two
months in Europe as a mem-
ber of the Herter Committee to
study the Marshall plan He

 

also participated in the draft-
ing of the Taft-Hartley Labor-
relations act. By 1948 his pop-
ularity and hard work had
earned him the nomination of
both parties ‘for another term
under California’s cross filing
system.

Nixon attracted national no—
tice for his work on the
House Un-American Activities
committee in exposing Alger
Hiss. Not often mentioned are
the reforms of that committee
which he introduced to protect
the right of the individual.

At the time he said, ”It is
essential also to be extremely
careful in this field, where a
man’s reputation can be de-
stroyed by accusations of Com-
munist affiliation, to distinguish
between an individual who is a
voluntary participant in the
Communist conspiracy and one
who innocently may have had
contact with it."

In 1950 Nixon won the sad
ate election by a wide margin
and in both 1952 and 1956 was
selected as Dwight Eisenhow-
er’s running mate. During his
tenure of the vice-presidency,
it was transformed from a rela-
tively insignificant office to
an office of great responsibility
and public significance.

In addition to his constitution-
al duties as president of the
Senate, Nixon was a statutory
member of the National Se—
curity Council, actively partici-
pated in cabinet deliberations
and presided over meetings of
both in the absence of the
President.

With a friendly dignity which
has brought credit to his coun-
try, he has visited over 50
countries throughout the world
as the President’s personal
representative and brought hon-
or 'to his country.

He was chairman of the
President’s committee on GovA
ernment Contracts, which seeks
to eliminate racial and religi-
ous discrimination in the em»
ployment policies of firms hav-
ing contracts with the federal
government He was also the
chairman of the Cabinet Com»
mittee on Price Stability for
Economic Growth.

By Larry Hultgren

Mrs. Margaret Chase Smith
resides in Skowhegan, Maine.
She has served the Republican
Party as a key member of the
House of Representatives from
1940-1949. in 1948 she was
elected to the Senate by the
highest percentage majority
and the greatest total vote ma-
jority in the history of Maine.
She has served in the U. S,
Senate from 1948 to date.

Again in 1960, when she was
re-elected to a third term in
the Senate, she was the top
vote getter of all candidates
for all offices—setting a new
all time record for Maine in
the number of Votes.

She is the only woman ever
to have been elected to three
full terms in the United States
Senate. She is the only woman
to serve in both houses of
Congress. Mrs, Smith’s coms

tors, and served as a. signal to
Washington and Moscow that
the Senate might ratify a test
ban treaty.

The Test Ban Treaty was not
the only accomplishment of the
Kennedy Administration which
owed its existence to Senator
Humphrey, On June 15, 1960,
Humphrey introduced a bill to
establish the Peace Corps—
several months before Presi-
dent Kennedy voiced the idea
in the closing days of his cam-
paign.

Respect for Hubert Hum-
phrey is nowhere higher than in
academic circlesr He is himself
a graduate (Phi Beta Kappa)
from the University of Minne-
sota and former Professor of
Political Science at Macalester
College. Humphrey has contin-
uaily stressed the vital role of
higher education in modern
industrial society.

 

 

principles of the Republican
party In a recent speech Mrs.
Smith said: “Today we have
a Democratic Administration
that has developed a mania for
loose spending and loose pro-
grams. History is repeating it-
self— and the Republican Par-
ty again has the opportunity to
emerge as 'the champion of
unity and prudence.”
Ambitious candidates have
continually q u i z z e d Mrs.
Smith as to the proper place

‘ of a woman in our society. Her

answer is short and simple.
"Women’s proper place is ev—
erywhere.” There is a definite
and inescapable future in poli-

, tics for women. It is only a
