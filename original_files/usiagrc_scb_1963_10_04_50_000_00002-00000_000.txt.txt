Cast of Characters
‘ Jack—a; freshman. He‘s well groomed, neat, has a sub-
scription to Sports Illustlated, Playboy, and in high school
won the award given for participation in extra-curricular
activities.

Gerry—a sophomore. They say he’s gone heat, but he
was once much like Jack until he cancelled his subscrip-
tions to Time and Playboy and purchased the Realist.

Bob—a,sel-lior. Didn’t run for a student office wheni
a junior. He's not an introvel‘t, but he‘s not interested in
many campus activities, subscribes to no magazines, and
is neither beat nor well groomed.

(Scene—a Ford Hall triple.)

Jack: Gerry, I received that extra-curricular activity
booklet today; so, I joined IRC, the Young Republicans,
and the Cosmopolitan Club. I’ll probably Sign up to work
for the yearbook, but I hear that‘s uncool work.

Gerry: I‘m sorry you joined those clubs, Jack I know
you‘re a frosh, but you Shoulda known which clubs to jolnl
by now. Like for example, this is a, liberal campus; 50, you
join the Peace Group, the YD’s, and you work for the,
Scarlet and Black.

Bob: Talk about it later, guys; I’ve got a lot of read-
ing I want to do for my seminar. ‘

Jack: Gerry, we‘ve got to go to this liberal arts lec-
ture tonight, It’s optionally required extra work for the
Junior Liberal Arts Exam. .

Gerry: I’m going to that; then I’m going to hear that
PPPE expelt talk on socialism. How about you, Bob? ‘

Bob: Sorry, guys, bllt I want to do this reading. (Jack
and Gerry exit.)

Jack: What’s wrong with Bob, Gerry‘.7 He doesn’t give
a damn about all these clubs and doesn’t go to but one or
two lectures a week. Doesn’t he want to make the most
of all the visiting lecturers:7 _

Gen-y: I don‘t know about Bob. He used to belong to
some of the best campus organizations and go ‘to hear {l
most of the lecturers. But now he seems to think he‘s

SNC C Gets NSA Support

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Com-
mittee is an organization of Southern student}
devoted to the elimination of all forms of racial
discrimination. SNCC (pronounced “snic") pur-
sues this goal through non—violent but direct
action. its primary activities have been in the
area of voter registration, where the group has
done canvassing and educational work, and, when
necessnry, has organized demonstrations. sncc
also works against discrimination in educatio ,
job opportunities, the equal use of public fncili.
ties, and all of the other areas which the noble
and numerous white man has decided are not
to be shared with anyone but his fellow
W.A.S.P,’s (White AnglerSaxon Protestants).
The United States National Student Associa—
tion has for a long time recognized a common
interest with SNCC. The basic policies of USNSA,
set by the National Student Congress during the
summer of each year, have consistently taken
a firm stand in the area of civil rights, including
full support both of the goals and of the non-
violent means of SNCC. USNSA has been further
concerned with this particular organization be-
cause the people involved are students. SNCC
is a student-run, student-staffed, and students
financed organization. This sets it apart from
many of the civil rights groups now working in
the South, and this peculiar make-up demands
the careful attention of the student community.
USNSA has not had the funds to support
SNCC momentarily, but it has lent its full
weight in policy statements, and organizational
assistance wherever possible. The 1963 National
Student Congress, attended by Jim Parkison,
Vance Opperman, Dan Friedlander, and me, vol:-
ed renewed support for SNCC, and then passed
a special resolution on the situation in Americus,
Georgia, where on August a; of this yenr three
field secretaries of mm (two white and one
Negro) were arrested while leading a peacful
demonstration. They were beaten repeatedly by

police, jailed, charged with “incitement to insur-
rection” a a crime which carries the death
penalty in Georgia a and are being held in
lieu of $360,000 pence bond until the grand jury
can meet some time in October.

This incident is not rare one. SNCC work-
ers have been beaten, j led, and thrown out of
towns, ridiculed, threatened, and last spring a
young Negro man, Jimmy Travis, wns murdered
in Mississippi while working on s chc votei-
registration program.

Life is not pleasant for the 150 or so young
men and women who make up the full-time staff
of SNCC. They are paid about $10 a week for
subsistence, and usually have to find a part»time
job in order to eat. Transportation is as often as
not by foot or by mule. violence and brutality
are constantly waiting if they push too far. Pro-
gress is heartbreakingly slow. Yet these young
men and women remain at work because they
share a common goal _ a goal which most of
us will freely agree with, fat and happy here in
Iowa where such ideas are not very dangerous.

SNCC’s biggest problem is a lack of funds.
The Freedom Singers who sang in A,R.H. last
spring were on n tcur trying to raise funds for
SNCC. The organization is yery largely depend-
ent on contributions from campuses across the
country, but these campuses have not in the
past been overwhelmingly responsive. At least
Grinnell is safely with the majority in this score.

it would be a darn good idea if someone
actually tried to run a fund-raising campaign for
mac around here, At Grinnell I mean — here.
We probably would not lose any money for

SNcc, we might optimistically raise a nickel
or two, and it would be interesting to See if the
noble principles so freely espoused by all pro.
perly-liberallyzeducated students go far enough
below their skin to reach their pocketbooks.

Explores Cave

it probably doesn’t interest anyone in the
slightest, but there are only eightystwo more
dsys until Christmas of which only sixty-six
are shopping days. This startling piece of mccn—
sequential news found me in a rnther apathetic
frame of mind, but nonetheless l mustered up
my courage and fortitude and embarked on my
annual sojourn into childhood via the toy de-
purtments in the local stores

Usually I wait until a few days before Christz
mas, when every business establishment from
drugstore to gas station displays such s multiz
tude and abundance of toys for the tots that the
casual observer could swear that he was look—
ing st the very inner sanctum of the venerable,
jolly old Saint Nick’s hidezawvayeat the North
Pole; however, my enthusiasm to see what brain-
storms the toy tycoons had dreamed up soon
grew to a furious pitch and throwing all rc-
straint to the wind 1 took my hand and marched
myself downtown to take just a little sneak
peek into the land of childhood memories.

Very cautiously i opened the door of a store
i was sure contained somewhere in its depths
the magic words “TOY DEPARTMENT” which
was the key that unlocked the wonderful world
of childhood fantasy. Carefully l crept to the
rear of the store where i found myself surrounds
ed by games and planes and all sorts of won-
derous things. But something was wrong, Some-
thing was alien and strange. The toys i saw
before me were not those that l rcmbered play-
ing with as a child. No, instead 1 saw before
me games and playthings which sent achill of
icy horror reverberating up and down my spine.

Carefully I read the names on the all too
bright boxes hoping that perhaps my first glance
had been hasty and inaccurate. Methodically l
mouthed the words i read, too frighened to fully
comprehend their significance. “Combat-" (in
three demension lettering on a garish yellow
exploding background) 7 “Tank Attack, Crash
Tank through Enemy Obstacles, Test Your lant—
tle Skill.” “ch Fight, Air Battle Game, shoot

down as many of the enemy as possible _ one

skill and you’re an ace, two, a double ace.” “U.S.‘
Army Tank and Jeep—20 pieces, stage your own
All Out Attack. Tommygunitch, Tmytommyi
59c. Tactics 1, Tactics ll, Stalingrad, Espionage."
My horror grew to fever pitch and frantically 1
reached for one of the “games” and began to
read the “simple, easy to follow instructions" in
hopes of proving my fears groundless. With
trembling lips i read the description of a “game"
entitled ”Missile Attack."

“Missile Attack . , . provides . , . enough
nuclear battle equipment for maximum effort
warfare and massive counterattack. Never
before so much actual design working model
USAF-type firepower and manpower! Your
opponent prepares to launch a sneak atomic
attack. He sets the locking trigger and adjusts
the nutomntic elevation control on his ICBM
launcher. He iircsl But you nre rendyz Your
missile bnsc crewmcn intercept the warning . . .

oept . . . contdpt . . , you deliver the nuclear

by n doublezstage warhead and the second one
is bearing down. Your crew can only use their
hand—gun radiactivators. Can you still win?
Are you good enough to Survive? only you
can answer . . . "

l stared in utter disbelief; could it be true
i asked myself over and over ngninl Have we
regressed from sanity so far that even the ‘once
sacred innocent r aim of childhood now too
must be enrolled within the ranks of the neurotic
adult World?

As I turned slowly, completely numb and
disillusioned, my aye caught one more box. It was
,a paint by number kit for a 32" by 15” painting
reproduction of “The Last Supper.“ At this
point the stench of hypocrisy grew so unbearable
that I ran out of the store and down the street
in a headlong stumble back to my little white
“ivory tower" where l hastily locked and bolted
the door behind me, thus shutting myself off
from the world.

“The limited and demanding
conditions of a cave offer an
excellent opportunity to study
the evolutionary process in in-
sects that have adapted to se»
vere conditions," explained
Christiansen. Ohnistiansen .is
now experimenting with natural
selection to see if he can dupli—
cate some of the special charac—
teristics of cave snimnls. He,
hopes eventually to answer, such
questions us why certain cave
insects are found only in par-
ticular geographical areas.

0n Sunday‘s trip, in addition
to collecung specimens for his
research, Christiansen and four
students attempted n systematic
survey of the cave, noting where
cave insects could be found.
This survey was a check of a
previous detailed survey done
in 1959. Specimens found on
such tours are put into a spe-
cial chamber which was design-
ed to duplicate cave conditions.

Kathleen Friend, an ardent
cave explorer end one of the
students making the su/rvey, dc»
scribes the caves in this way,
“They’re always pitch black
and muddy. Some of the rock
