SDS Pickets Get National Coverage;
CIA Has Seen Better Demonstrations

By BOB HODIERNE

The story was being read by
wire editors of newspapers from
Bridgeton, New Jersey, to l-lamey,
Oregon, before Grinnell students
even realized that their campus
was “embroiled” in a “protest”
against the U.S.'s “super-spy or-
ganization.” the CIA

A handful of Grinnell’s some-
times active chapter or Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
were sitting on the floor of ARH
while a representative of the CIA
interviewed seven Grinnellians for
prospective jobs The students
held a few signs protesting the
CIA’s intervention in foreign coun-
tries

And then the Associated Press
found out.

And then the phone calls started
coming to the College officials,

The Associated Press told the
Sari} they felt at first they were
getting the "rurharound" by the
college when nobody knew any-
thing about the “demonstration.”

 

Soon they realized that tew here
were aware of a protest. But pret-
ty soon people tound out and the
stories started going out.

Stories went to the AP and
United Press International.

Stories went out to radio sta- ,

tions KIOA, WHO, KRNT, WDI,
and, not least of all, KGRNI

College otticials were quietly
hoping that the story would be
used one day in Iowa papers and
on radio stations and forgotten
But behold the power of the wire
services:

A radio
picked it up.

So did one on the East Coast.

And so did a television station
in California.

And then NBC radio used it on
their six o’clock radio “news on
the hour."

And finally the CIA in Wash-
ington felt obligated to make a
statement. In effect they said, so-
what—we’ve seen better demon-
strationsr

So have we,

number in boxed on James Thurber‘r "parable in pictures"

has a unique perspecrive on the
attairs and problems of the col-
lege which the other two parts
of the college community—«faculty
and administration—Cannot have.
In his opening speech Monday,
Wittgrat emphasized, "The stu-
dent has the responsibility and
should have the right to contribute
to the iormation of academic and
administrative policy because he is
the primary element of the educa»
linnal communityr Student govern-
ment in the past has not realized
the full implications of its respon-
sibilities in these policy and pro
gram decisions.

“I would like to see Grinnell
students gaining a more meaning-
ful voice in the functioning of
their college. I will work towards
a student-faculty council, which
would have broad advisory and
policy - deciding responsibility in
all areas or concern to the college.
it is time ior students and taculty
to wnrk together in those areas of
mutual concern rather titan dupli-
cating each others eitorts,” witt-

actions on an honest concern for
the improvement of the college
rattler than on a discordant atti-
tude of "anti—faculty, anti-adminis-
trationr

“Matters of house rules and regu-
lations would be handled primar»
ily by the C of HP and the AWS
board The C of HP and AWS
presidents would be ex—oftlcio
members of the Council.” When
asked about the function of the judi-
ciary branch of the Student Gov-
ernment Association, Wittgrat re
plied that the organization of the
courts might depend on the hall
reorganization decision, if a ma-
jor change is made in that re-
gard

AS to his idea of the students'
part in the hall organization de-
cision, Wittgraf explained that
this “has already been decided as
a result I)" the petition effort on the
part of SGA last fall." Students

authority in decision is vested in
President Leggett.

“It is lime lor us to thinlt very
seriously about what role we stir
dents can and must play in
changing and improving Grinneli,"
wntgrnt concluded. “it Gi'miiell
students are to have any voice in
what changes are to come about,
then they must be allowed u more
meaningful iwrt in the policy—
making process here at Gi'liillcll.”
