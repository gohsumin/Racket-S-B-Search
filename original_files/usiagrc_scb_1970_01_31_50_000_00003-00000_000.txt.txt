 

ON THE RIGHT

by William F. Buckley, Jr.

The
ident's
sage on
state 01 the
union was
pleasing to Mr.
James Reston,
a datum which
no doubt will
send the Dow

Jones average up ten points.
Much that Mr. Nixon said was,
of course, predictable: one
hardly expects a message on the
state of the union at which a
presidentexpresses the hope that
the years to crime will usher in
war, poverty, and hunger. The
meaty sections of the address
were a rhetorical ﬂirtation with
the notion that the government
can do something substantial
about the quality of our lives, and
the passages concerning our
obligations to nature.

It is widely accepted that Mr.
Nixon has promised to do
Something about the quality of
our lives, and it is important to
examine the question whether he
did so, and if so, what he meant
by it. Important because there
are those of us who believe that
the principal mistake made by
Lyndon Johnson is enunciating
his dream of a great society was
precisely in suggesting that the
government could utopianize the
human condition: that essential
human relations and spiritual
needs can be looked after by
government.

It is as obvious that this is not
the case as it is obvious that there
are people in this country with
no material worries of any kind
who nevertheless harbor foxes in
their bosoms Which drive them
to drink, to psychiatrist, or to
utter, desperate boredom. Mr.
Johnson‘s celebrated speech
concerning the shape of the great
society seemed to be saying that
under Johnson such maladies,
which are of the spirit, could be
made to go away, presumably
elevating them to Cabinet rank.
What happened, as they say, is
history.

is it to improve the “quality"
of human life, to do something
about pollution 7 the concretely
phrased objective of Mr. Nixon’s
speech? Perhaps, though it is to
stretch the meaning of “quality.”
I take it as axiomatic that no
one has the right to pollute the

Pres-
mes-
the

air I breathe, or the water I
drink, and that the latitudinarian
habits of a society whose frontier
was always bigger than any of
us, have finally caught up with
us, generating a common
revulsion. It is overdue for
government to assert its
responsibility in these matters.

Whoever said it was the
responsibility of free enterprise
to clean the water or purify the
air? Mayor Allotn recently took
a shot at Governor Reagan by
alluding to the million pounds or
whatever of sulphur in the air
over Los Angeles every day by
private users. To which governor
Reagan replied deploring the 70
million pounds of human offal
dumped every day into the San
Francisco by municipal sewers.

An unprofitable dispute, Adam
Smith himself, by the extension
of his notion that the government
is uniquely responsible for public
monuments, would surely have
accepted the notion that it is
governments responsibility to see
to it that the people do not despoil
the land, depriving future
generations of their birthright,

What we need to worry about
now is the nature of the great
bureaucracy which is inevitable
going to build up around the ten
billion dollar national anti-
pollution project. As my friend
Mr. William Rusher so adroitly
puts it, how much, after the
bureaucrats have taken their
share, Will actually be left over
for the chipmunks? Here is
where one hopes that there will
be an observable difference
between a Republican and a
Democratic administration of a
project which concededly belongs
to the government.

The trick, of course, is to lay
down the general laws, im-
partially, gradually, and let the
enforcement oi them be done by
the use of private mechanisms,
and mechanisms of the lowest
feasible unit of government. Mr.
Nixon has promised us an
elaboration. One looks forward to
it eagerly, hoping to find in it
accents on local responsibility,
and as little as possible of such
rhetoric as suggests that natural
hygiene will elevate the human
condition. Natural hygiene is
good because It is good. but it
does not follow from it that people

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

The conserr
vative case for
an essentially
isolationist for
eign policy
is on its lace
very strong. It
rests on the

- proposition that
remarkably few things mid

happen in this World which would
vitally affect our national inter
ests. We Should therefore
disengage behind, in Walter Lipp-
mann's phrase, ”blue water.” A
few solid commitments would
remain: the Monroe Doctrine is
usually taken for granted, and
we Would retain alliances with
insular powers such as Japan,
Britain, Australia, etc. Outside of
Latin America, we would View
with friendly disinterest events
in the developing world. What
concern of ours is it whether the
black tribe or the white prevails
in Rhodesia? Whether Com-
munists or non»Communists in
Vietnam? Arabs or Jews in
Israel?

If one extracts moralism as a
basic component of foreign
policy, the conservatives are
impregnable. 0ur continental
fortress is only vulnerable to the
Soviet Union, but for 25 years the
U.S.S.R. has been hoping that the
us. would agree to a spheres-of-
influence division of the world.
If We settled for the Western
Hemisphere, Britain and
Western Europe, Japan and
Australia, and abandoned
moralism (that is, the Cold War)
the sources of conﬂict with
Russia would presumably
vanish. In short, the two super
powers would go about their bus-
iness in their own baliwicks. (If
the New Left historians are
correct in asserting that the Cold
War arose from American pro-
vocations, this should bring
detente in short order; here, as
elsewhere. the New Left provides
conservative advance men .)

The high priest of this view of
national interest is the dis-
tinguished historian and
diplomat, George F. Kennan.
Back in 1951, Kennan presented
the essence of his position in a
little book that was a tour de
force, “American Diplomacy.”
With a surgeon’s scalpel, Kennan
opened up American 20th century

diplomacy and found it to be sufr
iering from a pervasive malig
nancy: Moralism 7 or, in his
precise formulation, “the legal-
isticrmoralistic approach to
international problems.”

With regard to Japan for ex—
ample, Kennan‘s tightly argued
thesis was that an intelligent
approach might have avoided
Pearl Harbor. But failing to
appreciate the forces that drove
the Japanese to expand, and
carried away by sentimental
attachment for China, we
“hacked away, year after year,
decade after decade" at the
Japanese encroachment on the
Asian mainland. “Had we been
over a long period of time more
circumspect in our attitudes
towards the Japanese, more conv
siderate of the requirements of
their position," he wrote, “there
was a possibility that the course
of events might have been
altered.” When we disregarded
“power realities in the Orient,”
we bought unnecessary trouble.

Kennan’s central argument is
proloundly pessimistic. Most of
our interventions, he suggests,
have created problems greater
than those they were designed to
meet. This was inevitable, per-
haps, because they are founded
on moralism, the crusading
fervor, rather than on rational
calculation of real interests. In
fact, we cannot shape the world
to our ideals, we cannot alter
history; thus he observed that
“the great misfortune of the
West, i suspect, was not Hitler
but the weakness of German
society which n. "é possible his
triumph.”

This leads one to assume a
spectator role in the world 7
except where vital interests are
at stake, say in Latin America.
(Lippmann, for example, sup-
ported our action in the‘Domini-
can Republic in 1965, while con-
demning Vietnam, because the
Western Hemisphere is vital and
Southeast Asia trivial.) It is an
argument with great intrinsic
appeal to the American people
— who, after all, did not go to
war with Nazi Germany until
Adolf Hitler declared war on us
7 but for the last 25 years the
moralists have held the initiative.
Then came Vietnam and the
desertion of the liberal in-
tellectuals, which will be
examined in a later column.
