been finally approved, Bowen
said, and, he pointed out, there
may be some changes made. He
,said that he and the Trustees
are particularly interested in

‘in deciding upon a final plan.

Two proposals which clrew
lvarying opinion from students
Monday were the plans which

ought to go with the recreation
center, which would be built
