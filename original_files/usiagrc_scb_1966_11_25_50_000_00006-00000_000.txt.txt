Lawrence had live each.

Coach Edd Bowers ot the Pio-
neers noted that there were
many highequality players in the
conference this year and so was
not surprised when only two

_® Pioneers made the elite teams.

He added that there was an
extra number of good backfield
men, :
“With only a 245 record and
no real outstanding player we
expected this," he concluded,

Coach Bower also had some
complimentary words tar his
team with regard to their per-
formances In the last two
games. “Fnr [he ﬁrst time in
the year we were able to come
up with the big plays," he
noted. “Alter six straight losses
and many injuries. the team re-
fused to throw in the towel."

Bowers did express disap<
poiniment that the Pioneers
could not win for the home
tans. He was very pleased with
the Way the students continued
to support the team even atier
several losses, and concluded
they should have been treated
to some winning football.
