Soccer Record Drops To 3-4-1;
Tries To Even Season Saturday

Since last word in this pub-
lication, the stars of the sec
cer field have been something
less than brilliant. They have
dropped two contests,andma-
naged only to tie their better
rival Knox. The final game of
the season is tomorrow when
the Pioneers travel to Drake.

The Knox game, played Oct-
ober 24th here in Grinnell,
ended in a 1’1 tie, with both
goals being scored in the first
half. Levi Wood put Grinnell
ahead with a sh0t from the
right wing, but all too soon
Knox tied the game up. Grin-
nell had another opportunity
when Tony Wheeler seeming-
ly scored for the Pioneers,
but it was brought back for a
foul against Knox. It was one
of many questionable calls on
the part of the referee.

The next week Grinnell hada
problem finding a goalie for
their game during Mid-Sem
Break at Cornell. Both regu-
lar goalies, Dave Coron and
Dave Klaus had gone East for
the weekend. After a little
searching Coach Fisher gave
6'7" at football punter Bruce
Rollins a tryout, and immed»
iately signed him toa big bonus
contract. Despite a fine eff
fort by all concerned, the Pi-
oneers lost a cold contest to
the Rams, 3—2. Grinnell's
goals were scored by Tom
Lincoln, on an excellent dir-
ect kick from about thirty
yards out, and Craig Gordon,
on a pass to Steve Korstad
that the Cornell fullback ins

tercepted and kicked into the

Cornell net.

Grinnell was shut out for the
second time this season last
weekend by Carleton, 3-0. Co-
ron and Klaus returnedtoplay
wing and halfback as Rollins
was recruited from the swim-
ming pool to play goalie again.
Grinnell had many opportuni-
ties, but just couldn’t seem to
put the ball into the goal. Car-
leton was a bit ragged too,
but still managed three goals.
Carleton’s record is now 7»l,
while the Pioneers will be try-
ing to make a .500 season out
of it against Drake tomorrow,
as their current record is
3-4-1. Soccerates

Gridders lose To Ripon, St. Olaf

Black days have fallen upon
Grinnell’s Pioneers since last
I wrote of their deeds. Over
the mid-semester break, the
offense reverted to form and
failed to move the ball with
any consistency as Grinnell
lost to Ripon 17-13. Then,
last Saturday, the defense fol-
lowed the offense as Grinnell
was crushed by St. Olaf 35’7.
Grinnell is now 4-3 in league
play (5-3 over all).

Against Ripon Grinnell’s de-
fense repeatedly gave the ball
to Gorgeous Gary Johnsonand
the offense in good field posi-
tion. Key defensive plays were
provided by ‘Mafia Jim’ Plr‘
olli, who filled a contract on'
a Redman fumble at the Ripon
Si, by Randy "the Neck"Sar-
ver, who picked off an errant

pass and ran it back to the
Ripon 17, and by a balding
Gary Jones, who jumped on
a Ripon fumble at their 38.
Only on the first fumble was
the offense able to capitolize,
however. Washington “Baby
Full" AlSton and Henry "the
Flash" Corona moved the ball
to the one, from where the
Flash eased in for the TD.
With the interception, Grin-
nell reached a fourth and goal
from the three and went for
six instead of a field goal(and
failed, as happened a second
time, at the end ofa long drr
ive), and with the second fum-
ble, Grinnell fumbled right
back. Two more scoring at—
tempts (both through the air)
were intercepted in, or near,
the endzone. Grinnell‘s only

IM Program Knocked

IM Volleyball appears to be
following the trend of IM spa
orts this year, as nobody but
a couple of "jock“ oriented
halls are even interested in
competing. The league is again
dominated by the gallant men
of Read, the Clark Creatins,
and the "soul squad” from
North. At the present there
are two surprises in the first
division, the Loose “loviies”
and the suave Smithies.

Games seem to be suffering
from poor officiating, as the
heads of the 1M program have
passed the buck to the halls
to supply adequate monitors.
The big queStion on the ruling
seems to be if the ball hits on
the inside of the line, is it in
or out’! And how over is over
the net? It seems only to be
when you draw blood in some
cases that you get called. Who
said this was not a contact
sport? It seems to be that the
lack of interest is because the
people in charge do not give a
damn. They get paid for an IM
badminton tourney even if no
one shows up. The amount is
reported to be $100 a major
sport, $50 a minor sport. Is
anyone getting their money's
worth? That is, besides Read,
who leads the Truesdale Tran
phy Race with 860 points, Cl-
ark with 760 points, andNorth
with 720 points?

Forfeits seem to be the in
thing, as a record 149 mat-

ches were forfeited in tennis.
There have been 17 forfeits

by the end of the second week
of Volleyball. There just is
too much of a hastle in lM’s.
There is not that much fun in
playing a team that has blood
in their eyes. Nobody cares
whether you show up or not,
so why bother? Little Rich-

ard, Curly Craig, and the 003'

ching staff get paid reyrdr

less of your patronage. If so-

mething gets done before IM
basketball season it will have'
to be by the halls. Perhaps a

hanging in effigy? Some off-

hand food for thought: scrap
IM’s by the Hallandletpeople

have identity teams; forget the

Truesdale Trophy and just

play for fun, like true gentle-

men; Demand more interested
IM program heads who would

work for less, and pay refers

ees more if they were certi-

fied.

As we have changed the hall
system, we must change lM’s
to fit the new Grinnellattitude
and style. It's your turn to do
something. The paperwouldbe
happy to hear your comments
and will be glad to express

your sentiments.
the C. Kid

the American Revolutionaries
of 1776 who, in spite of their
lack of discipline and profeSn
sionalism, defeated the Brit-
ish. Coming out on the field
looking like the ‘team' had
just been formed five minutes
before the game, Grinnellpre-
sented a sharp contrast to the
Iowa State team in their neat
little blue tunics. ISU looked
very professional until they
got out on the field. Grinnell
dominated the game and the
final score was 4’0.
Unfortunately Grinnell's luck
did not hold. They lost the
second game to University of
Iowa by a score of 076. The
third and fourth games were
played on November 7 in that
yearly fiasco known as the
Iowa State Hockey Tournar
ment from which Grinnell re-
turned two years ago as State
Champions. First Grinnell
was matched with Graceland
and was defeated 0-4. Next
they played Iowa University.
After a good fight they were
defeated by a score of 1-3.
Before I close, I think there
seems to be a general trend
here that deserves attention.
A few years ago, all the
'teams' that Grinnell played
were more accurately classi-
fied as interest groups who
practiced two or three times
a week and played for fun.
However, now most of the
teams are teams in the sense
that they are composed most-
ly of P.E. majors, they prac
tice every day, and they are
out for blood. I'mafraid Grin—
nell's triumphant hockey days
are over. Unfortunately Ihave
to predict many more seasons
as bad or worse than this one.

far-out fourth. Grinnell's I23
tally played fourth fiddle to
St. Olaf's 42, Eeloit's 64, and

Carlton's 68. St. Olaf was not-

pushed too hard as theyplaced
four of their top five runners
in the top ten finishers.

Grinnell's top scurrier was
Eric Jahn who finished 6th
despite a stomach cramp he
gOt after 1.5 miles of the four
mile dash. That’s real guts,
“Hairgod”l "The Mantis
Mauler” Chuck McGrath, last
year's third place finisher at
the ‘biggie‘, finished llth as
he remains down in the mouth
due to a toothie ach. Prep
Phil Frank swooped inat27th,
followed by Oscar Rattenborg
at 46th, and Jon Russell pro
ducing at 54th position.

The consensus at the Monday
morning joggers' meetingwas
that mid-semester break was
too much for the team. Any-
way, the team was surprised
at their inability and it was
stated that if the team would
have run as well as they did
at Cornell, they would have
won. Well Coach 0, since you
were gone that whole week,
that might tell you something
about your humor, ifone could
stretch the term. Possible
translation of the above: Mr.
Worley wants your job!

other score came on a one
yard slam by the Baby Bull.
Ripon scored on a deflected
pass reception by Steve Schn
midt, a 20 yard field goal,
and a onevyard dive by Jim
Beisner.

Against St. Olaf, Grinnell was
destroyed by Ole Gunderson,
a pretty good runningbackwho
gained 155 of the 312 yards
St. Olaf got on the ground,and
by St. Olaf’s quarterback,
Doug Johnson.

Grinnell scored first, going
70 yards in 14 plays, with the
Baby Bull punching over from
the two. From then on it was
all down hill. Gunderson broke
loose for scoring jaunts of 48
and 35 yards to put St. Olaf
up at the half 1477.

In the second half, it was
more of the same. St. Olaf
opened the second half with a
78 yard drive in llplays, cul-
minated by QB Johnson’s boots
leg from the five. A four yard
punt gave St. Olaf the ball on
the Pioneer 22, and Johnson
eventually bootleggedinagain,
this time from “18.12. The
score now stood at 28—7. In-
sult was added to injury when,
with 90 seconds left in the
game, an interception of a
G.G. pass gave the ball to St.
Olaf on the Pioneers’ 21, and
secondsstring QB, Al Montr
gomery, drove his team in,
scoring himself from two
yards out.

The final game ofthis season
is against Knox, at Knox. It
appears as though the Pion-
eers are sinking to the level
to which the experts Predicts
ed. Even though it means a
three game losing streak, it
is good that Grinnell sched-
uled the good teams for the
end of the season, for this
way, one can hope at the be
ginning of the season. For the
Pioneers to schedule the class
at the beginning would be like
reading the last chapter ofa
murder mystery first.
