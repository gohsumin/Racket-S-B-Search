other private college and univer-
sity presidents stating that as

young men and women, “We

gress a stepped-up timetable for
withdrawal from Vietnam, We
believe this to be in our
country's highest interest, at
home and abroad” At the rally,
he reaffirmed his position by
reiterating the statement.

Professor Robert Vbertmau
(Economics) addressed himself
to actions that can be taken
that may help change the
course of the War. “I believe
that we ought all very seriously
communicate to our congress»
men, senators, and par-
ticularly to the Foreign Rea
lations Committee, and to the
Senate Armed Services Com<
mittee, concerning the removal
of appropriations tor continuing
the war in Vietnam,” he said.
Voertman also called lor t
withdrawal from Vietnam.

John Otto, a junior, related
the view or a college student.
Otto concluded his speech by
asserting that “The War will
not end. . .until the rest of
America is convinced that
apathy is no virtue, that dissent
is no vice. , t . Unless we act
now, we may relinquish our
chances to ever ettect change
again."

Although a chilly rain began
to fall during the rally, over
700 people stayed until it was
over. Aiter the rally, on all»

“Nixon is trying to buy 011'

with troop withdrawal which

years ago,” stated Zigas. “We

not putting up with his empty

two teach»in speeches, soph-
omore Jake Margolin rose to
air his views on the Mora-
torium. "I did not want to par-
ticipate in the Moratorium, and
I’m not going to,” he said. “I’m
going to leave as soon as I
say this. . . .It’s good tor us
to come up here and give good
reasons. , .about why this war
is terrible. . and how we the
people aren’t going to stand it
any more." But, said Margolin,
“Don’t: we know already that
the people don’t like the war?
Nixon already knows it ..
“I think the one thing that
people have to address them-
selves to is to tactics. Going
to Washington and marching is
not going to make any dif-
ference, and we should realize
thi s,” Margoiin contended.

Good Luck,

faculty members, and townspeople attended
the rally, which was part or a day-long Viet-
nam Moratorium calling for peace.

When questioned about a halter-
native, he replied, “The alterna-
tive is somehow deciding“.
how the people are going to get
power. This whole thing (the
Moratorium) is a waste. We
con's ask (or power, can’t ask
for the war to be over, we
must force the war to be overt"
Margolin continued by saying
that what should he considered
by protesters are the tactics
that can be used to make Nixon
stop the war, which Margolin
feels the Moratorium will not

do. He then walked out of the
teach-in.

Next to speak was instructor
'Alan G. Nasser (philosophy),
who to some exiem supported
what Margolin had said. Nasser
spoke of the lack ot physical
opposition to the war by pro-
fessional academics and stu-
dents. Rather, he stated, they
resort to only verbal opposi-
tion which has been discounted
by the nation's administration.
Nasser then discussed other
possible solutions and tactics
to ending the war.

Other speakers at the teach-
in included instructors Stephen
M, Johnson (Poli. Sci.), Henry
F. Klein (Art) and Trio-in-
Residence member David W,
Able.

Shortly after the teach-in, the
members oi the cast tor the
play “The Brig,” pertonned on
the lawn in front of the thea-
ter, For twenty minutes the
lawn was turned into a mock
military training camp com-
plete with soldiers and officers.
The purpose or this demonstra~
tion, according to senior Greg
Wallance, director oi the play,
was to show what life in the
military is like.

During the afternoon, group
discussions with iaculty panels
were held in the lounges at
Main, Loose, Cowles, and Youn<
kers Halls.

Although classes were not
officially cancelled tor Mora»
torium day, at least 118 protes-
sors signed a petition saying
that they would not hold
classes, and classroom activity
was virtually halted Wednes-
day.
