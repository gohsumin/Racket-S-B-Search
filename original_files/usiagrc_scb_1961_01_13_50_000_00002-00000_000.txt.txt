Out of this week's Col'HP meeting. has come a stat
mcnt by one of the house pi sidelits that shows a neglect
of this responsibility; a neglect which contributed directly
or indirectly to the Hair-Cut party in Dccembelz

‘IAccording to air reports, which have been verified

bylprcsident Gary knamiller, the man who was later de—lmcsrdenp 11m 50pm Comvdmamr:government; Terry‘s hair and
tel-mined to be the leader oi the gang approached one of and the Coll-1P and AWS Boardeoar‘S

the presidents as to what would be the reaction of ie
Coi'HP to such an incident. According to reports, the pre
ident either gave his approval or failed to give 3 opinion
wl ch would discourage the action. Later the president
justified the situation with his statement whichwras given
'at llueiiday's meeting “I didn’t sanction it for the CofHP
‘ netioned it for myself.”
There is no “sanctioning for myself" for a person . i
a position of governmental responsibility. He cannot shii't
ml ”myself" to “leader" for the sake 01' personal con-
venience. If he is going to be a member of the Coil-1P
he must be a member full time. A

Governmental problems in the Grinnell college com-
munity relate to our determination to J ard that Com
m‘iinity as a state or as a fawily, and not as an amalgc-
motion of the two.

,Our “l'ainily” rationale of government includes our imag-
ined obligation to defend a hall mate or a ‘fhiidlly”~-no mat-
ter how wiong he may be It includes our judging an
idea on the basis of our opinion of the person express—
ing' it.

would be regarded in a regular state .or local situation ha

,iusti ed in terms of the “state.”

Breaking into a person’s pr vate home and attaching‘

him with malice and vioiousness is certainly an invasion of
liberty, such as the “underground” notes. Cutting a stil-
dcnt hair is not quite the same. ‘

The llai cutting was (lone as a prank (no matter how
uhuise) instead of as all assault.

The location was a nearby, unlocked room on common-r
