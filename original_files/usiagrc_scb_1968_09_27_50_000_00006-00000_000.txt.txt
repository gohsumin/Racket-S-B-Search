Editorial . . .
The Wallace Ad

During this past week a debate arose on the
very intricate issue of advertising ethics The debate
was centered on whether or not to publish an ad-
vertisement for George Wallace which we received
from the National Educational Advertising Service.

There were some who thought that such a pub-
lication would constitute an endorsement of the can-
didate, in the same way as when an ad appears in
the Good Housekeeping Magazine, an endorsement
of the advertised product is understood Some ar-
gued that publication of the ad might aid the cam-
paign of Wallace, and since we ought to do nothing
to help him, we should not publish it. Some also
thought that the ads appearance in the S&B would
offend a large number of our readers.

If an advertisement for Nixon or Humphrey had
arrived first, there probably would have been no
difficulty, for these men, while not model candi-
dates, do not stir such deep feelings of hatred as
Wallace. We thought that if one of these ads had
arrived we would have published it, Not to publish
the Wallace ad would have been a kind of political
censorship. Not having published the ad would set
a dangerous precedent for a free newspaper — that
only those whose views are compatible with those
of the editorial staff he represented in the paper in
advertising copy.

The notion that the publication of an advertise-
ment for a candidate constitutes an endorsement is
absurd. Never would this paper endorse a man who
threatens to run over demonstrators. A newspaper
publishes political advertisements because these ads
are a part of the forum on which ideas of the candi-
dates are expressed. The publication of such an ad
is not an endorsement, but is a recognition of the
man’s existence as a candidate.

if we were to run the ad, Wallace might well in-
clude Grinnell College in a list of “liberal" col-
leges where his ad appeared, and this might help
his campaign. Or it might hurt it. Yet if we were to
refuse to run his ad, he might include Grinnell in
a list of colleges who refused to run his ad, and this
also might either aid or hurt his campaign, It is also
uncertain whether the ad itself will be of any help
to him.

We worked strenuously this week to solicit ad-
vertisements from the other major candidates so
that we would not offend the sensitivities of a large
group by publishing the Wallace ad alone. We re-
spect those sensitivities Henceforth, however, it
will be the policy of this newspaper to publish po-
litical ads.

“It’s not a bargain if you don’t need it"

A new gym has been on the priority list of need-
ed constructions ever since the old women's gym
burned down in the late 1930’s. Darby Gymnasium
was originally built to be a temporary structure, to
tide the college over the war years when a new gym
would be built, The Fine Arts Building, the library,
the Forum and the two service buildings all dis-
placed the gym on the list of priorities

According to President Leggett, the renovation
of buildings is not an activity which must await the
completion of new structures. In an interview he in<

dicated that Steiner and ARH are on the agenda to
be renovated this coming summer.

Nevertheless, the planned gym is an excess, It
would fill the needs of a college twice Grinnell’s
size. Only if the college were planning a great in‘
crease in the enrollment would the new gym be jus-
tified, But the college plans no such increase, and
wisely, for a large increase in the number of stu-
dents would significantly change the ethos of the
school.

Could not the college settle for something
humbler? Is the gym a result of pressure from
trustees who see the size of a college’s gym as be-
ing directly proportional to that institution’s worth,
just as in the suburbs one’s status is measured by
the size of his swimming pool?

To save some money the college is not going to
put bleachers in the new gym immediately, so Dar-
by will continue to be used for varsity sports. Would
it not be less extravagant to convert Darby into a
women‘s gym and build a new gym for the men
smaller than the planned complex?

Even if there be good reason for the new gym,
there is no sense in its size.

Corrections

Last week we incorrectly reported the figures
on the election or" Lee Maril. There was confusion
between the SGA office and the S&B office, prob-
ably because of their proximity. Anyway, the cor-
rect figures follow:

Maril — 162
Secrest — 129

In one of last week’s editorials, it may have
appeared as if the David M. Gibson Memorial
Newsletter was the sole contributor of the commu-
nity bicycles. In fact, there were 15 persons who
collected funds for the bicycles. Two were contrib-
uted by the DMGMN, six by this group of fifteen.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Mergen F' es Error . l 5&3 Blasted

To the Editor:

May I correct an error of
fact which I unwittingly made
in an interview with your re-
porter last week?

In my enthusiasm for the
cause of the National Florist
Workers Organization, which
is on strike against the Kiiaya-
ma Brothers greenhouses (al-
so known as Colorado Floral
Products) in Brighton, Colora-
(in, l erroneously stated that
Bates Flowers of Grinnell re-
ceives Carnations from the
Kitayama greenhouses.

This is not true.

Bates Flowers buys Carna<
tlons rmm Denver Wholesale,
which is not on strike. A boy-
cott against Bates wuuld be
pointless.

Nevertheless, other florists
in your hometowns may buy
their Carnations lrom Kltaya-
ma. If you wish to support the
Florist Workers strike for de-
cent wages and union recogni-
tion, you should ask before
you buy. You can also support
the strike by making a linem-
cial contribution and by writ~
ing to your congressmen urg<
ing lhem lo support the hills
which would put agricultural
labor under the protection of
the National Labor Relations
Act.

To the Editor!

My husband and i have
worked hard to be able to send
our girl to a good school like
Grinnell, 1 can't tell you how
hard we’ve worked, the sacri-
fices we‘ve made, the degrad-
ing things we’ve done — like
jalning the PTA and giving up
our SNCC buttons, so we
wouldn’t offend influential
people in the neighborhood, and
my husband’s accepting promlr
tions in a big corporation,
whose guts he hates, just so
we could have the money lo
further our daughter’s educa-
tion. We’ve played bridge when
we could have been attending
courses in guerrilla warfare at
the local Free University.
We've served on social com-
mittees and Welcome Wagons
when we could have been Or~
ganlzlng the paper boys of the
city. We’ve led double lives, and
all because our image of Grin-
hell was. we thought, true.

We didn't choose a college

{or our daughter lightly. Ever
since TIME said that Grinnell
was hippie, we've studied it
carefully. We subscribed to the
58.3, We took the underground
paper, we watched the news-
papers for signs to confirm our
impressions of Grinnell as a
place where a student could get
a good 20th century education.
one that would adjust and train
him for the revolutionary world
of change that faces us all. We
admired the spirit of previous
editors of the 5&3. and when
lhe paper suspended publica-
tion in protest over the censor-
ship of the yearbook, we were
delighted — especially since
there were signs of under-
ground papers to take up tho
torch of education and pass ii
on with the victory cry. "Burn,
Baby, Bulnl"

Our daughter ls an extremely
gifted girl, as all who meet her
would confess at once. Her po-
litical views —— thanks to the
prevailing climate of opinion.
which approves of spliLs be-
tween parems and children —
have been able to differ sharps
ly from those bourgeois ones
my husband and l have had to
expose to the world as our dis-
guise. We were not exactly
happy when she joined the
"Clean ior Gene" campaign,
cutting her hair, taking ire~
quent showers, using deoden
ants, and even depilatories, and
wearing hose and heels. We
thought to ourselves, “My God,
me kid's turning out just like
her parents!" That is one 01
the reasons we chose Grinnell.
It’s awrully hard to know just
where to send your child, but
irorn all we could tell, Grinnell
looked like a safe place.

imagine our surprise, and
our despair. when we got the
ﬁrst issue of the 5&5. Not a
lounletter word in it —- what-
ever became of the FSM? All
announcement that the years
book was coming out. Where in
Henry Wilhelm? Shirley Temple
editorials congratulating people
in a nauseating attempt to ores
ate an era of good leeling.
Serious attention given to SGA.
And not one attack on the cal-
lously indiiferent and brutally
hypocritical administra<
tion which actually sanctioned
the appearance of a paper so
disgraceful to the Grinnell tra-
ditions! We were heartsick at
what we had exposed our little
girl to.

We are, at the moment, try-
ing to console ourselves at the
thought of the whole issue he
lng satire. The next issue will
tell. We won’t say we dare you
to print our letter, but we will
certainly draw conclusions, and
hegln looklng mm the transfer
situation it you don’t. Our
daughter’s future and the fu-
ture of the nation are not
mings m be toyed with.
