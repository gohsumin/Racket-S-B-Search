attack to win the game.

Knox scored in the first half
on a long scoring drive and held
the Grinnellians to one sixty

ifumble on the Knox 20 yard
line.

After receiving the ball on-
the kickoff at the start of the
second half, the Pioneers scor-

Kickers Lose;

Al' Northiield

The Grinnell soccer team’s
powerful offensive machine came
to a halt last Saturday, as Iowa ,
State ended Pioneer hopes for
an undefeated season with a 4—2
victory.

The Iowa State soccer team
managed methodically to score
once in every period, while the
Pioneers counted in the second
and third periods, with Bill
Montfort and Bill Hicks doing
the scoring.

Coach lrv Simone felt that al-
though his team’s play was a
little spotty, it lost to a fine
team, the best the Kickers will
face this season.

Tomorrow morning the Plo-
neer soccer team journeys to
Northfield, Minn., to play Carle-
ton. The game shapes up as an
even match on the basis of com-
parative scores. The Knights of
Carleton go into the contest
with a 471 record, while Grine
nell sports a 3—1 mark

Moore, “The whole team did a
ifine job.” He singled out Ethcle
bah, Mac Marshall Eric Miller
and Ship chrauch for than
performances, but gave credit to
everyone on the team for the
victory.

During the season coach Moore
said that the team improved on
pass defense and that in the fi—
l nal week the offense jelled. The
passing attack which the team
‘1 had planned to use against Knox
. was abandoned because of the
wind. I

The long-postponed doubles
match between Smith and East
has apparently degenerated into
a war of nerves, there being no
action since darkness called off
the first attempt after one set
last Thursday. The winner will
take on Rawson for first place
in the biacket.
