SCARLET AND BLACK

Bodies Are Beautiful in Bethesda too!

' Evidently, the effects of Grin<
nell’s nude protest against
Playboy last Feb. 6 have seep-
ed beyond the limits of our sell-
lmposed exile. The participants
in a Liberal Religious Youth
conterence at 3 Bethesda,
Maryland, Unitarian c h u r c h
last month held an “impassion-
ed burn-in” of Playboy center-
lolds, Carlos C. Van Leer, J11.
who led the discussion which
resulted in the spontaneous
immolalion, said, “Activists
must trankly acknowledge our
debt to 8 young Grmnell stu-
dents. A pat on the back to
the eight —— we hope it makes

them t'eel zt little better as they
run the lowa judicial gauntlet”

Van Leer also commented,
“Women feel they're supposed
to compete with the monster
breasts in Playboy and it
makes them feel totally inter-
ior." Apparently, two female
part 'pants agreed whole-
heartedly, and proceeded to
add two padded bras to the
conilagration in what was
termed a “back - to r nature”
movement.

Rev. William R. Moors, Assn-
ciate Minister of the Unitarian
Church in Bethesda, and also
present at the “burnin,” wrote

Playboy berating their philosos
phy. The following is an excerpt
from that letter:

“Far more serious than any
sit-called ‘pornography’ I have
seen, is the immorality oi mis—
representation. Young people
have enough to resolve in real.
ity without having to contend
with — and releam from —
fantasy worlds. I have been in
this business long enough to
know that many men marry
with a pinup concept of sex and
are at a loss when it comes to
relating to a real body — a
body that loves rather than se-
duces, a body that sweats,
emits, has odors; a body with
pubic hair, pimples, a nd
breasts that sag. I like human
bodies and I believe that all
people should learn [0 love the
human body as well as the
human soul. There may be live
models lor your pictures, but
it's hard to believe 7 hopelolly,
no young man believes it. They
are all white teeth and polish.
I! is difficult to believe they
have either alimentary canals
or vaginas.

“when you have the oppop
tunily, why don’t you read Whit-
man again and give us some
real women with a dab of hu<
manin and axillary hair. The
human form is divine, let's not
alter or misrepresent it."

Don’t you just love Unitarian
ministers? Somehow they al-
ways seem so human,
