There were several other

the show. Sue Browns choreog-

“Spiritual“ provided the fouli—
dations ior what turned out
to be an excellent opening
number for the show. This, as
well as the “Mind Bull" dance
became iorceful because of the
emphatic rhythmic nuali'cs
which were developed, How—

platiorms and the isolating
