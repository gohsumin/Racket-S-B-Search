We Win Again!

By Barry Anwna

An inspired Pioneer basket-
ball team hoisted itself out of
solitary’in the Midwest Corie
terenco cellar Friday night by
beating Coe College 75—66.

The victory eased Grinncil in—
to a ninth place tie with the
vulnerable Kohawlrs. The birds
from Cedar Rapids managed to
peck away two victories in the
conference before succumbing
to the Powerful Poweshiek
Pointgetters. Each team now
has two victories to its name.

Tom Hill sparked the Pioneer
effort With a magnificent 21
point showing. Tom’s outside
shots were on target through
But the evening, and his one
tree toss drilled the hoop, El-
liott l-libbs didn't see too much
of the ball, but when he did,
it counted: Elliott hit six for
seven to claim 12 points.

With a 43-32 lead at half-
time, Grinnell entered its usual
second half slump. Coe scored
eight points in a row to cut
the lead to three. It took the
Pioneers ten shaky minutes to
regain their half-time lead.

In addition to Hill and Hibbs,
the starters were Thor Evenson
with 13 points, Mike Schwartz
with 10, and Bob Watt with
1. Roger Able scored 7 points
in service in both halves. Tom
Lower had l and Steve Bn'nt-

SCARLET AND BLACK

Lance, Frohlich _
Dive One-Two

The Grinnell swimming team
took seventh place in the Mid-
west Conference meet at Mount
Vernon last weekend. The Pio<
neer poolmen were led by Rich
Lance and Cliff Frohlich, who
finished one-two in diving.

Other point-getters for Grin-
nell were Ken Adelman, who
took second in the butterfly,
the medley relay team, finishing
fifth, and Steve Holtze and Bill
Batschelet, who placed sixth in
the individual medley and 500<
yard freestyle respectively.

One of the factors hampering
the Pioneer effort was Holtze‘s
illness three days before the
meet. Steve was the team’s top
scoring man, according to Coach
Ray Obermiller, and having him
at less than full strength was
sorely felt.

The freshman swimmers con—
tinue to break records, They
won the conference telegraphic
meet with 72 points, far ahead
of secondplace' Cornell's 42.

Coach Obermiller is looking
forward to next year's Grin-
nell swimming effort: The fresh-
men Will be a welcome ad-
dition to his good. but shallow,
team.

Swimming has been at its
finest throughout the conference
in the past few years. Six re—
cords were broken, and two
others approached to within a
tenth of a second this year,
and two others were broken last
year. Competition next year
should be the best the Midwest
Conference has ever seen.

Finish Season

The freshmen basketball team
dropped its last game of the
season to Cornell, 8514.

The Little Pioneers, coached
by Dick Lovell, spent a good
part of the season on funda-
mentals; only five of the team
members went out for basket-
ball in high school, and of these,
only two started. The lack of
experience was evident in the
Cornell game. but the fresh-
men arc deiinltely on the way
up.

Terry Holloway. the ti'1" frosh
center, shot for a 23.2 point
average as the team went 1—5
for the season. Also in double
figures in season averages were;
Gordy Abel, 14.8; Rad Conner,
13.8: Don Peterson, 10.5.

ed iali season, the Grinnell
Soccer Club is organizing its

from Drake, State College of
lowa, and Knox have indicated

petition.

an oiilcial conference varsity
