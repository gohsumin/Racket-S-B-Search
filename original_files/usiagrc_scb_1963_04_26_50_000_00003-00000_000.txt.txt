Thai/and: Trees and Ant Eggs a Sign of Prosperity

Thailand's northern-most province (about
100 miles north -Of my home in Chiengmai)
borders on Burma to the northwest and on Laos
to the eas I recently spent some time travclr
iiig in this area by What; limited means were
available (use truck, riveiboat, foot, etc). I
found the living condi ions we encountered very
interesting for they seemed to reflect some of
the real differences in development and stabil—
ity which exist between the various countries
of Southeast Asia.

The government of Laos is presently so in-
effecti‘e in most regions of the country that
the activity of sneaking across borders (with-
out permission since it is nnobttiinable) is not
even too exciting, unless one makes the mistake
of choosing a section controlled by tile prorcomo
munist Pattiet Lao. Burma, however, seems to
be experiencing it period of severe reaction to
outside influence and the tworycar-old ‘revolu-
tionary regime’ has made 'sneaking’ somewhat
more challenging. While Thai people are allowe
ed into the country freely, the government;
seems to have a special aversion to Americ‘ns
and will usually permit them only in the capital.
But with the aid of several of my more ingen»
ious friends and my somewhat non-western zip»
peilrailce we were able to stroll causually across
the border bridge past the Burmese guards, as
we chatted away in Thai. Fortunately they
knew only enough Thai to recognize it but not
enough to realize how poorly I speak it. This
trip to Burma, however, was not as revealing
as my travels it few days later along- the Lao
border.

There is a region in the extreme north
where Thailand and Laos are divided by the
Mekong liver (the largest ill Southeast Asia)
before it swings eastward into the interior of
Laos and the mountains sepa tte the two Colllh
tries. It was along this river borticr that my
friend and I trampcd and that we encountered
some very noticeable di. imilarities between the
two countries. Traveling with trade ‘, farmei ,
soldiers, and even a lbw opium runners (this

activity is now illeg‘l btlt still a booming busi-
ness), we took a makeshift ri erboat down the
Mekong for 50 miles. Just looking at the Sets
tlement along either side of the river offered
some sharp contrasts. The river doesn't seem
to form a line of cultural difference as much
as one of economic difference. On the Thai side
We encountered several sdeublc villages, their
sturdy bamboo houses surrounded by towering
coconut palms. These trees do not grow easily
and usuully must be planted. They tithe up to
30 years to mature and in a village they tend
to be a sign of stability and reasonable prose
perity. The two villages and one small town on
the Lao side of the river had not a single one
among them, We also passed two towns on the
Thai side, both connected with the rest of the
country by road (of a sort) and telegraph. The
Lao settlements have to depend entirely on the
river. We spent several days at the Lao town
of Huey Sai, which is really little more than a
village, and the town of Chieng Khong across
the ri\ r in Thailand. The latter seems to pos—
sess a little more vigor than even some other
small Thai towns. As . veral remote towns here,
it reminds me of a g owing western frontier
town in the U. S, All activity centers along its
one, dusty. but very busy, main Stl'CCt. There
are over d dozen new buildings constructed eie
ther of plastericovered brick or more often of
teak wood. The single hotel and several restau-
rants (Thai people like to eat all the time, oft-
en (5 or 7 times it day) seemed to be doing a
thriving business. The hundreds of men from
the nearby army and border police camps keep
a number of other as ablishments in btlsine '

well its keeping the town altake into the early
hours of the morning. Every dity two or three
huge Japanese-nutde rice trucks rumble over
some of the worst roads in the country, milking
the 8-hour, 110 kilometer jottincy to Chieng
Khong. The town is typically Tiltti in that “hate

across the river in crrzy long boats which ride

about two inches out of the water. Lil ,
many Thai villages and towns, consumer good,
are readily available because there is a marlict
and because a buyers market here is never left
unszttisfied. Thus in the dozens of open-front
