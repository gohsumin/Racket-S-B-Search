Cans Replace Breakable Bottles
,In Campus Pep-Vending Machines

With the advent of the new cola
lege calendar, the new science
Wing, and the new president, a new
era of refreshment is sweeping the
campus.

No lunger will wholesome looking
coeds, avowed members ot the
Pepsi generation, be seen casually
sipping the youthtut dnnk irorn
wholesome looking bottles. instead
they will be swigging, swilling,
and guzzling trorn cans—the very
same type at cans that bear the
label of Milwaukee’s most famous
product.

The new can _ dispensing ma-
chines are bright, shiny, and ac-
cording to the Pepsi (20., almost
100 per cent trouble tree. There
is one catch, however. The going
rate for a l2—ounce Can is 15 cents,
which constitutes a 50 per cent
increase in price with only a 20
per cent increase in product.

vice President Memt Ludwig
cited a number of reasons for the
change, “in addition to acclden»
tal breakage, there is considerable
deliberate breakage. Moreover,
the housekeeping statl has to
spend too much time collecting
empties and carrying them to bot-
tle rack3#wliicli, incidentally, are
very unsightly."

However, students can console
themselves with the knowledge
that the choice was between the
15-Cent can vendors and loeent

 

cup vendors, And, as Ludwig
pointed out, “It bottles aren’t han<
dy as missiles, son's bills tor
building damages may go down!"
