Hatha Yoga is Grinnell's new—
est way of physical condition
ing.

The Yoga Club, organized
and taught by Phil Brown, of-
fers an alternative to Body

Building with the Royal Canar
dian Air Force program. Work
in this club may count as a
_ minor in physical education.

Hatha Yoga is an exercise
program based upon deep
breathing while maintaining
various postures. Its history
reaches back over 2000 years
and its foundation lies in the
philosophical systems of the
East.

“Yoga, in its Indian context,
is a set of six philosophical
systems whose adherents seek
Spiritual union with the trans-
cendant self,” said Phil.

He explained, “Each person
may choose the yoga he finds
best. Hatha Yoga is a part of
Raja Yoga, the most sophis-
ticated system which is based
upon concentration and medi-
tation. Concentration requires.
a strong, healthy, pure mind,
and this in turn requires a
strong, healthy, and pure
body. This is where Hatha
Yoga comes in. It is the yoga
of physical conditioning.

“Although Hatha Yoga is
‘ part of a way of life, the exer-
cises are good in themselves.
I’m not really teaching Yoga,
but merely the Yoga system of
exercise.”

In this program the perfec-
tion of all systems of the body
is stressed. Muscular develop-
ment is only one of a number

YWCA Investigates,

Aims and Purposes

The Grinnell College YWCA,
under the direction of President
Ann Bacon, is participating in
a nationwide three-phase study
of the wording of the student
,YWCA statement of purpose.

Sponsored by-the National
Student Council, the study is
aimed at two goals: to deter4
mine if the existing statement
of purpose expresses adequate.
1y what today’s Y is, and to
ascertain the possibility of hav»
ing one purpose statement for
the total YWCA movement.

Members of the campus club
have formed-committee groups
to discuss and formulate the
aims of their organization.
These groups are analyzing the
importance of the Y’s Christian
purpose and its function of pro-
,viding for women students’ cur»
rent needs.

Grinncll’s Y emphasizes the
latter aspect, as an opportunity
for community service to hos-
pitals, nursing homes, Camp-
ure and Girl Scout groups,
civic organizations, and Uncle
Sam’s Club and m campus ac-
tivities such as selling Home»
mming buttons and food during
the week in the women’s
dorms.

of objectives such as glandular

The combination of deep breath-
ing and posture Causes the di—
rection of reoxygenated blood

head stand feeds rich blood to
the brain, thyroid, pituitary and
pineal glands, while the heart
is given a rest from its usual
task.

Phil said, “Western systems
of exercise seem to come up
with similar system although
our emphasis is primarily on
one aspect of body condition-
ing and our exercises are rep-
etitious and vigorous. The more
medical information we gain
about exercise, the closer we
find ourselves to the Yoga prin—
ciples. The myths about the
origins of these exercises get
very supernatural, but the fact
is the exercises have developed
into something valid. I try not
to make claims in class about
the benefits, but I feel pretty
sure that they are tremendous.”

Phil became interested in
Hatha Yoga as a senior in high
school when he was investigat-
ing the philosophy and religion
of India. He is self taught, al-
though he spent a few days with
a Yoga master whose book
he had been using while he
was abroad last year.

The club has been a sporadic
thing, beginning two years ago
and suspending activity while

Philosophy and Exercise System
Phil Irown Explains Hatha Yoga

Phil was abroad. The first
classes this year began second
quarter with 12-15 regular stu.
dents. This quarter there are
two classes, one advanced and
one beginner. Workouts are
held in the orchesis room twice
a week.

Phil said, “In the advanced
class I’m having a tough time
keeping ahead of some of the
people, The main thing I have
is my knowledge. But, then, the
emphasis is to get people to
Work on their own. That’s the
advantage of Yoga; you can do
it in warm Weather or cold
weather, indoors or outdoors,
and the only equipment you
need is yourself and a rug.”
