SCARLET & BLACK SPECIAL
Friday, November 2), 1969

The two host recent issues of the §E§ have been censored by the
printer; E.K. Shaw, publisher of the Newton Qgily gewg, the conpﬂny
that prints the §E§, refused to print four words in today's issue.

Remarkable as it may seen, one of the words E.K. Shaw refused to
print was the word ”masturbating.”

I confronted E.K. Shaw shortly before today's press run to find out
why he had deleted the words, especially the word ”masturbating.” He
refused to discuss the matter, and told me:

"I just won‘t print them, and you better act as a halfway decent, clean
human American or I‘ll throw you out of my shop."

I left E.K. Shaw before he had the opportunity to carry out his threat.
Perhaps he thinks that printing the word "masturbating" would stunt his
growth or cause warts on his hands.

For the sake of freedom of expression and journalistic integrity, here's
how today’s paper was originally written:

On page one, in the story ”Four Ptero Vendors Busted,” the censored
paragraph should read-~“The allegedly obscene issue included a full—page
photograph depicting a male youth masturbating in front of several Playboy
magazine centerfolds and a short story by Pristine Pureheart vividly
describing a couple screwing,”

On page five, in the review "Mineral Patter: The Rolling Stones,” the

censored sentence should read, ”Theirs, like many of ours were on pussy and booze

and starting to be on dope, and they still are, but now there‘s the realization
that somebody’s going to have to fight back or we can‘t have all that good
shit we want."
Because of E.K. Shaw‘s pig-headed attitude towards censorship, I plan to ask the
Board of Publications to consider terminating the Scarlet ﬂ Black‘s contract with

the Newton Daily News. Michael J. Brandon, Editor
