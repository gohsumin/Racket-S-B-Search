Soccer Team
Defeated 4-2

The Grinnell soccer team suf-
ferred its first defeat last week-
end at the feet of MacMurray
College, 42. The first quarter
was slow but Grinnell dominat;
ed play. Chilingulo scored 21

cal early in the period but
grinnell failed to tally again in

he quarter. MacMurray ral-
lied somewhat in the second
quarter and scored two goals
While holding Grinnell score-
less. The first goal was on a
penalty kick awarded for use
of hands. Goalie Kaufmann had
been incapacitated earlier in

e the play, forcing fullback Ros—
enbaum to make a desperation
stop of a Maclviurray goal at-
tempt with his hands.

The MacMurray team came

n strong in the third quarter

ut Grinnell held them score-
ess. In the final period Mac-

urrey pressed their attack
and scored two goals. Grinnell
tallied somewhat and scored
once on a deflected shot by
Rinku. Tho final score. +2 Mac-
urray.

In general Grinnell did not

lay an aggressive, hard chal-
enging game. They failed to
game their opportunity early in
he first quarter and thus lot

MacMurray rally in later per-
lods. One must not take any-
thing away from the MacMur-
ray team. Their tight defense
oontained the Grinnell eIEVen
while their offense penetrated

Pioneer Victory 0ver Monmouth
Highlighted By Offensive Running

by Kris Nash

The Grinnell Pio n a ers
notched their second victory of
the football season last Satur-
day as they rolled past Mon-
mouth College 42-0. The game
marked the first time in three
outings that Grinnell’s back-
field speed and running ability
have lived up to its potential.
A combination of good blocks
and determined running a-
massed 307 yards rushing for
the Pioneers Added to the
typically potent passing of
quarterbacks Barry Anderson
and Denny Hanssen (ll of 21
complete for 144 yards), this of-
fensive overwhelmed the Fight-
lng Scots, who were able to
muster only 77 yards overall.

The Pioneer defense, in post
ing its second consecutive shut-
out, smothered the Monmouth

deep and often. Ons expects a
more spirited showing from the
Grinnell team in this weekend’s
home contest with Shimer Col-
lege (soccer field at 12:00).

attack efficiently enough that
more attention could be focused
upon Grinnell’s offensive prob-
lems. In the opening loss to Ri-
pon, numerous offensive mis-
takes which might have been
corrected, continued to cast the
Pioneers yards because coach-
es were forced to devotevtheir
attention to tightening a porous
secondary.

It was a far more aggressive
and effective defense that faced
the Scots, intent upon the idea
of a shut-out from the first. The
Grinnell line limited Monmouth
to 11 rushing yards and the soo-
ondary allowed them only 68 in
the air, with halfback Chip
Clarke making two of four in—
terceptionsl

The Pioneers lost a scoring
opportunity in the first period
when Monmouth defender Jim
Pilarski picked off a pass at
his own goal line Grinnell
came back with a SECDnd'quaF

vter drive that saw Hanssen

break the scoring ice with a 1-
yard sneak. Shortly thereafter
end Mike Dewitt grabbed a 15-

 

yard toss from Anderson to put
the Pioneers in front at half-
time 14-0.

Playing before a large and
enthusiastic h o m e co min g
crowd, Monmouth was reluc-
tant to submit, but a fake field
goal attempt with Anderson
again firing to Dewitt brought
Grinnell a single third-period

score. A similar play, though

unplanned, added a two-point
conversion.

In the fourth quarter Grin—
nell’s superior strength and
ability wore down the Scots and
produced a three - touchdown
barrage. Sophomore halfback
Bob Watt tallied on jaunts of 11
and five yards, but reserves
Bob Geller and John Kelsey
staged the most sensational
play of the day. Geller inter-
cepted a Monmouth aerial with
5:32 left in the game and
Instead of going down, later-
alled off to the nearby Kelsey
who scempered 25 yards to
score.

End Dave Gauger closed the
Storing by booting his fourth
extra point of the afternoon. In
addition to a 32—yard field goal,
Gouger has been successful on
five of seven conversion at-
tempts, with his only failures
coming on a blocked kick and
an errant center-snap.

Though they did not score,
backs John Shierholz, Elston
Bowers, and Marty Ringo were
the central figures in the Pio-
neer ground game with their
tough and elusive running.

 

Harriers to Run in
Inter-Squad Meet
