Tlicrc has been some question
concerning the seriousness oi
James Paiizee's candidacy.
Statements like “the lrees belong
to the people” and “vote tor Jim
Panzcc, tiie candidate with his

own armpit. a baboon to
mankind, I thougiit it was

tunafish myself” seem to have
aroused an adverse reaction, or,
worse, no reaction at all. A Jag.
Well, close butno cigar,

“Why have you campaigned as
an ape, Mr. Paiizee'!”

“I am an ape.”

“Aha! Theater of the absurd,
right?” .
“Close, but no banana. I see
complete involvement of the
student in self-government, I
choose to be an ape. Therefore
I am, Politics should start with
the apes, What’s good for General
Motors is good twice before
bedtime, It’s not just foolish to
run as an ape, but also to vote for
one and to elect one, Join the

party!"

“I take it, then, that in your
campaign you intend, in the
tradition of Queen Mellman the
lfirst. to attack currently in
stitutionalized roles through the
use of, in this case, not a sexual,
but a doctrinaire chiasn'lus of
absurd proportion? Politics of
Dada. Right?’

“You’ll learn, I want to be

instance, to call a meeting

SCARLET AND BLACK

By Tom Greenfield

I am grief stricken to report
that the Senate and the Board
of Publications are not getting
along very well. Frank Thomas
announced that he hild asked the
Publications Board to appear at
this week's meeting. but Mr
Pnrssiiicii. a spokesman in the
Board refused Frank said, how
ever, that Mr Parsslncll had
invited the Senate to attend any
one ottlie Board's meetings

Chairwoman Jane West sub-
mitted to the powers ot reason.
“We can't force them to come.
so maybe We should attend their
next meeting” Someone then
suggested that the Senate shoot
Terry l>arssinen, but this was re
jected immediately on the
grounds that the Senate cannot
afford to purchase a gun.

The Senate wants to talk to the
board about several financial
matters 7 the publication and
financial hassles with Montage
(Gary Giddins’ torthcoming
literary magazine), the seems
iiigly exorbitant SM} traveling
expenses to Newton, and the
possibility of retrieving any
surplus funds which the board
may have.

Tom Thomas reopened the
question about legal responv
sibility in the Senate’s allocation
of 50 dollars to “High and
Mighty,” Toni insisted that his
legal sources, w. H. Thomas and
Ralph Mattaz, disagreed with
Mr. Beerman’s statement, which
asserts that the college is respons
sihle tor the contents of the paper
if SGA funds are used to finance
it, When Frank Thomas
suggested that the Senate go
speak to Mr. Beerman, instead
of listening to second hand
reports, Penguin Dave took
serious objection. “He’s incred-
ibly slimey,” someone else

shouted that Mr. Beerman was
full of something, but I couldn't
qmtc make out what it was

Phil SﬂSICll raised a point [hill
nobody tit the meeting had
enough experience to judge the
merits of one legal opinion over
another. Bill Thomas dismissed
this argument as irrelevant,
“You can get any legal opinion
you want ityou look hard enough
I think Beerman's opinion is
spurious and I don't accept it.“

The furor halted when Chuck
Garman pointed out that there
is no need to worry about legal
problems. If the Senate were to
purchase an ad or buy a lifetime
subscription, all legal problems
would disappear. ‘

Frank Thomas announced the
names of the four candidates for
SGA Presxdent 7 Jim Panzee
(Mark Kass), Andy Loewi, Phil
Mears, and Frank Thomas. A
brief interchange followed be
tween Frank and this reporter.
Among the subjects commented
upon were inferior journalism on
campus and the relative merits
of Frank’s mother.

lda Gudema reported on the
meeting of the student power
committee on social change and
a faculty committee. ida told a
pleased Senate that debate on the
shape of the table was well under
way,

Al Hammond raised the issue
of lasts — one for CBS’ Martin
Luther King week-end (April 3)
and one for the ecology teachsin
(April 24). The April 24 date was
selected at the request of Mr.

ioiia Academy of Sciences Con-
ventlon. The Senate passed both
fasts

Debate then turned to the
Academy's convention itself
Tom Thomas objected to the fact
that the faculty's dcclston to call
off classes for the convention was
done Without consulting the
students. Torn remarked that this
maneuver was particularly
loathsome ili light of all the
hassling that the Moratorium
tolk get whenever they petition
the taeulty for class cancellation
Moreover, the contract-obliga
tion argument 7 which the
taeulty has used as a rationale
for the defeat of Moratorium
Committee proposals — seems
applicable to the Academy con-
venlion as Well. A motion to have
the Senate write a letter cen-
suring the faculty for their
decision was passed.

The Senate spent about fifteen
minutes carefully phrasing and
rephrasing the letter. Thorough
consideration of each single word
and meticulous evaluation of
each turn of phrase resulted in
the following: ”To the faculty:
