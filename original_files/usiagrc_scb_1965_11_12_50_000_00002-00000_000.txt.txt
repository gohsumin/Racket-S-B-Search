The Fees 60 Up . . .

The tradition wasn’t broken this year, and students

returning to Grinnell next fall will be $130 closer to

reaching the magic $3,000

comprehensive fee (which

ought to be reached by 1969-70 if the present trends

continue) .

Last week we argued for a guaranteed compre—
hensive fee at Grinnell, a plan now in effect at three
Midwest Conference schools — St. Olaf, Coe, and Be-

loit.

The plan was discussed by the trustees, just as it

has been discussed for the

past several years, and re-

jected because the present system makes budget plan-

ning easier.

It has been suggested that guaranteed fees are of-
fered simply as selling points by some colleges and that
they offer no real advantage because students are then
paying according to four-year projected college costs,
instead of one-year projections.

But sometimes sales gimmicks have side advans
tages. The added advantage to guaranteed fees would be
a lessened chance of mass exodus which might other-
wise occur at schools insisting on reluctantly tacking on
many unpopular dollars to fees year after unending

year.

Student Writes of Sgt's letter:
Must Remember Such Views Exist

To the Editor:

i enjoyed the ietlzr of last week
based on T/Sgt. Ginnutsos’ editorial
and appreciated receiving this ex»

i-ession oi a viewpoint that rare
y is heard on campus. No matter
how much one’s opinion is opposed
to the sergeanl's, everyone must
come to realize that such opinions
do exist and belong to intelligent,
lane and successful lnen. All living
opinions must help us build our
ﬁnal answers tor the present world
tituation.

l was somewhat disheartened,
however, by the scrgeant's own
lack oi understanding or the stu-
dent liberal “opposition." since he
has been overseas so long, though,
I can sympathize somewhat with

American idiom and currcnt p0pu~

A pale ghost of an undergraduate, one ior whom
the thread of inherited responsibility had become so
thin as [D be lost in the fabric of the present, alien-
aled originally by a barely perceptible speech de-
fect and a pair of nearly globular eyeglasses, later
by the human condition, sensed with mounting dis~
comfort that the unenrolled students and poemless
poets or Harvard Square had stopped providing him
with his meagre ration of their common, though
unspoken, belief; that human being need only be to
mean. Because he Was around twenty-eight. and no:
getting any younger, because he had watched the
philosophical season or the undergraduate genera-
rion change around him, and because his manhood
seemed to have gone lhe way or his identity, he re—
solved to make one small concession to what was
now his pride, was once his despair, and to seek an
alternative to anonymity. So one altemoon he picked
up the Current issue of the “Broadside," or perhaps
an imported copy of “Blues News," and lhumbed
through it, unadmitledly looking lor lhe names oi
lost Delta reiugees. He had to do something, and he
did: he went out and found Son House.

Perhaps he had never forgotten the gangling,
simple and unassailable Royal Dam in “The Prairie
Years," or this evocative and poignant transiorma-
tion or the New Jersey landscape or high tension
lines and industrial Smokestacks into a Vision of pure
longing by the hoarse complaint of a saxophone on
the car radio. AS we deﬁne the nature of all time

struggles to recover the now vague images of that
time, to make them relevant to the present. For what
are ieelings but images at the present, given mean-
ing by memories of the pasr and iinaginlngs of the
iuture? Past and iuture pound on (he dour, Dilend

assume that we were aware of the deed that he had
done, and that we knew it was somehow significant.
He was a skilled and ludiclous antiquarian. “If the
man doesn’t want to sing again, then you’ve got in
leave him alone,” he said His diction was painstak-
ingly exact, disturbed only by a nervous rush or air
in his throat Words like “catharsis" and “inter-
loper” came out with speech-clinical. mellculuusnessv
campus words, which both established his authority
and betrayed his madness.

He documented and praised at length the phenom-
enon he had succeeded in isolating, who stood in the
wings, Chording. But then he was totally eclipsed,
probably for him the most satisiying moment in the
profession he had invented for himself. It is [his mo-
ment that interests me; for San House was a man
authentically possessed by the devil. Humility had
come to him through an old suffering, told and retold
within him until it had been kindled into myth. The
old blues man apologized ior making a spectacle or
his necessity, tor having to let the demon out, if only
[or an apocalypic forty-live minutes, then cautiously
slipped the slaii out or the doorlatcht The iirsr symp-
toms appeared: hands iurtively tuning and plucking
the strings, voice deeply stirring. eyes closed and
mind calling up images or uncontrollable immenslly
and uniathomahle misfortunet Then he began, and
every heave and gasp for breath. every drop of
sweat, every cell in his body was committed to the
blues.

How is it possible for the harrassed intellectual
to find his Calling in this Old raisin of a man? Be
cause in this old blues man lhere is the nagging and
unrelenting awareness of the human condition, and
in his iace the torture and agony of a mere man
Whose mind and body must contain a universe. How-
ever unsophisticated in his mode of expression, it
moves him totally. it requires the full attention of
his mind, body, and spirit. His wisdom is simple and
powcrrul, lull oi paradox. But ior us, the important
thing is that he understands that moment that es-
caped us, has lelt that longing lor horizons; he brings
them back to us, brings back the painlul and joyous

Curtains Go Back

Because 'A Rule Is a Rule Is a Rule'

To the Editor:

We live on the north side of the
second ﬂoor oi East Norris hall.
Our view iaccs away from the unm-
pus onto the countryside which
is quite beautiiul, However, our
view was obstructed by the pres-
ence of curtains. No matter where
we moved them they would still
block some part oi the View. So
we took them down.

Three weeks later we round a
note in our room Saying that we
had to put them back because of
the Head lionsckceper's orders, in
conferring with the ilead House-
keeper on the subject we were
told that we would have to put
the curtains back up because “a
rule is a rule . . a rule is a rule '-
We were told that in any society
there were rules and that tor the
same reason one could not go
