Manches’rer book

William Manchester’s The Death 0'
A President, one D! the most cuntruver-
sial books of the generation and des-
tined to be all all-time best-Seller, has
been selected as [he PPPE Political
Book-oi-ihe-Monlh lor April and May.

Manchester was invited by Mrs.
John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert
Kennedy to record the history or the
pl'esldential assassination oi November
22, 1963, and the days immediately pre-
ceding and followmg it. Operating out
of the National Archives, Manchester
worked twelve to ﬁfteen hours a day
lor two years conducting his investiga-
tion throughout Texas and the US. He
was invited by Chief Justice Warren [0
be a privileged observer of the Warren
Commission's inquiry and findings.
Altogether, he accumulated forty-five
volumes and portiollos of transcribed
tapes, shorthand, documents and exhib-
lts, beiore he began writing.

The publisher, Harper and Row, con.
siders Death oi I Presidum to be “both
a Significant contribution to history and
an eminent literary achievement." Most
reviewers, however. have assessed tho
volume to be a grealer success as a
Illerary work than as history.

out at Burlillg Library or at the Caucus
Room in Carnegie Hall, with two-week
