are willing to pay tor every
job that is done.” Fomerenk em-
phasized that the justiﬁcation
for not splitting block time was
to insure that a full Crew would
be at the meal.

In a separate letter to Saga
workers, new policies to control
absences were outlined.

The second major issue was a
seniority increment above the
base wage. The students asked
tor a ﬁve cent increment above
any base rate after the second
semester of work and again
lifter the liitll semester.

In a letter to Saga workers.
James Stauss, Provost oi the
College, said that the College’s
budget is already tight. Because
the College must. increase the
base wage rate to reach the
minimum wage or $1.65 in the
next three years, student labor
costs already pressure the pro-
jected budget. lithe pressure or
increments were added, the Col-
lege might have to consider a
cheaper alternative to so much
ltudent labor.

The present wage base is $1.15.
February 1, it will increase to
$1.30. At that time all existing
increments will be discontim
lled.

The students in the Quad are

the only large group of student
workers currently receiving any
increment. They had not yet
been informed that the incre«
merits would be discontinued
next semester. There was some
contusion regarding a decision
to establish the increment sys-
tem two years ago. Some
thought that the system esta-
blished then was still in effect.
on Sunday the administration
produced a copy of a letter sent
to Saga workers then. The sys—

tem was only established for
that school year.

"The administration is fairly
satisfied with the agreement,”
said Mrr Pomerenk, “but we
are sorry that the students
struck. That type or relationship
that one finds between labor
and management in industry is
not appropriate under a system
where jobs are granted as a
form of financial aid.”

“we were pleased that the
administration was willing to
compromise." stated Shaw.
"The compromise on block
times was good. We only regret
that it took four weeks of dis—
cussions and a strike to settle
instead of the filteen»rninute
meeting Friday at which the
administration showed no will-
ingness to compromise, even
when the student negotiators
demonstrated their willing-
Hess."

Dr. Ponseﬁ Talk
On ’Don Quixole’
Draws Big Crowd

Dr. Helena Percas Ponsetl
(Spanish) lectured to a sizable
crowd or students and faculty
on “Cetvantes’ Creative Genius:
The Cave of Montesinos" in the
South Lounge of the Forum on
Wednesday night. The chapter,
from Part II or Don Quixote, is
generally considered to he one
or the most obscure and pro-
found episodes in the novel.

Mrs. Ponseti analyzed the
chapter in three ways: the lit-
eral, the figurative, and the
psychological. Extensive allu<
sions to classical and other par.
allels made Ihe lecture an il-
lumination not only of Don
Quixote’s character but also of
Cervantes’ place in western
literature.

The lecturer summarized the
views oi preceding critics be.
lore developing her own an-
alysis of the “psychological"
level, whose ambiguities are.
she explained, a means to in<
volve the reader in the book
and thus prevent him horn malt.
ing simplistic objective critt-
cisms.

The lecture is part 0! a longer
chapter, itselt to be published
as a separate article beiore in-
corporation into a book.

 

One college does more
than broaden horizons. It
sails to them, and beyond.
