) Seals Doom
(Continued irom Page 8)

on Pennsylvania Avenue you seal
your own dooms; the American
people won’t stand for it . . ,
(“Hey, hey, stop the scum . . t i
Can't take him seriously") . . .
I'd like to know, where is the
American Legion? They weren’t
here today but I think they will be
it you try it again . , . (”They're
haying a dance tonight”) . . . i
think the Ku Klux Klan will come
up here and help us. We've got
one or them and we'll get some
more.

For your Information, peace
creeps, tor your lntormation you
cowardly scum. we are organiz~
big a Nazi motorcycle corps that
is going to make Hell's Angels
look like I bunch Iii Girl Scouts.
(loud lpplause) We got twenty
motorcycles, and i can tell you
when our motorcycles come
rourlng into one or Ihese towns
where the Niggers are trying to
establish Communism. it’s go-
ing to stop. We’re not going to
tolerate any kind oi Communists
Inywliere, any lime.

All of you people who come
down here and think it's runny i
would like to take you over to Viet
Nam and let you see Americans
dying with your triends shooting
at themt I'll tell you what I'd like
to do, l’d like to come down there
and clean you out myself. . . t
(“Come onl”) . . . (loud applause)
. . . Believe it, listen, believe me
creeps, I would, but we just can't
ntiord itr . . r (“Aw, gee")

You‘re loud, you're loud and
you're vulgar and you‘re traitor—
bus and you’re rotten and scum-
my, but you don’t represent my
country. . . . (“You do?")

Anybody, anybody who adheres

to the enemy according to the us.
Constitution is a traitor, that's the
word, and Americans used to be
Ashamed oi it. I am, I'm
ashamed, ladies and gentlemen, to
see that a bunch of people stand
here and applaud the Viet Cong
in the shadow of the Washington
Monument. Shame on you! . , .
(Naughty, naughty") . . . (“what
else are you ashamed or, l . . .
I'm ashamed that there is a bunch
at people, while our boys are out
dying, that would come down here
to razz and jazz people who stand
up (or them, in front of the Sign
asking you to stand up tor them,
. . 4 (“Where's the American
tlag?") .

And I can tell you this ladies
and gentlemen, it we had our
kind of lighting men over there
in Viet Nam we’d Will lhll war
overnight. It isn‘t hard to win
tint war; we have the weapnns,
to wipe those people out, but we
won’t use them. And i say to you
that as long as one American
boy is over there getting killed,
we have the duty and the obliga-
tlon to use my Ind every weapon
in our arsenal to stop that war.

 

to win that war. . . . (“Rocky the

[lying scum”) .

All over this country, ladies and
gentlemen, are Americans, they
won't wear swastikas like me, but
they're thinking just what l’m say»
ing to you and all the whooping
arid hollering you can put on
doesn’t change the fact that you
are a despicable, despised, hated
bunch or peace creeps that this
country will not tolerate. All you
got to do is keep it up, just keep
it up and the American people will
take care of you. Everywhere
l’ve gone around this country, ex.
cept when you go to a peace creep
rally as we came down here, know-
ing what we’d lace, everywhere
you go, the American people are
fed up with communism, they’re
red up with subversion, and they're
fed up with race mixing Both
North and South. And when they
say to me. "yes, but you're too
awful. you're a Nazi," you know
what i say? “Well, maybe I'm too
awful, but at least we're out there
where the enemy is." Here you
are and here I am,

. . . There’s only one way to deal
with treason, ladies and gentlemen,
the constitution sets it iorth, when
you adhere to the enemies oi our
country. You’re helping to kill
Americans right here today, right
where you are. It will be in the
newspapers that you were here,
and they will have more spirit to
right on and kill more Americans.

You're killing Americans, you
tilthy creeps. Are you proud of
it? . . . (Yeah!") . r . Somebody
actually said yes, that they‘re
proud to kill an American.

Shame, shame, I never thought
l’d see this day. I usually keep
pretty cool in these operations,
but this is one of the most de5r
plcable and rotten that l’ve ever
seen.

For the beneﬁt of anybody here
that‘s still a good American and
realize what stench I have here
in {rent at me, let me say this . . .
(“Yeah and you make that
stench") . . . A lot of the conserv-
atives have a motto, “better dead
than red." We consider this to be
defeatism and it’s Yellow. And the
reds, these kind at peace creeps
here, say it‘s better to be red than
dead, one of them just hollered it.
Well, our motto, ladies and gentle-
men, is a ltttle diiterent. Our mot-
to is, “Not dead, not red. Dead
reds!"

Merry,
Christmas
