“They have thus broken down‘
the barrier of collective human

“The dlﬁerent higher religions
and philosophies have done alike
in bringing individuals into the
rect relation with ultimate spir—
itual reality though they have
ditl'cred, ﬁrst in their picture of
what ultimate reality is like,
and secondly in their precepts‘
tor a human being: attitude
and action towards ultimate‘
reality.”

Using “The Breakdovills oi

clared that it is ditiicult to
draw a ﬁrm line or distinction

D. Toynbce pointed out that
it is necessary to take philoso-
phies as well as higher religions
into account because some, such
as Buddhism, Neoplatonism, and
Taoism, have turned into i'eiig»
ions by appealing to the masses.

"In gcneral," he said, “the
philosophies have told pcoplc to

Dr. Toynbec said it is para—

“All of the main living civilir

have even become the establis

“Thus the higher religions
