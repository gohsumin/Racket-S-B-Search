Iniuries Turn Players to Coaching

Henry, Nye Continue Football

By Tom Lane

What happens to an athlete
who, according to Coach Bowers,
“was deﬁnitely ﬁrst—string var.
sitymaterial,"when, in the ﬁrst
quarter of the ﬁrst game of his
collegiate football career, he re
ceives such a severe knee injury
that he is told never to play
again?

What happens to a halfback
who, after making all—state at
his Colorado high school and ﬁrst
team defensive back as a sopho-
more for the Grinnell Pioneers,
develops an arthritic condition in
his knees that makes even the

simple act of running painful?

Some athletes become bitter in
their self—sympathy. many de—
velop new interests, but in the
cases of Bill Henry and Dick
Nye, they have stuck by their
ﬁrst love: football.

This fall the two seniors are
coaching the freshman Pioneer
football team. Last year they
assisted Terry Moore with the
freshmen, but since Moore
joined the Peace Corps they
have the job to themselves
it's a tribute to the two that
the coaching staff thinks well
enough of their capabilities to
give them sole control over
the team. Their job is impor—
tant, for they must teach the
freshmen Grinnell’s favored
winged—T oﬁense.

Both men bring impressive
football backgrounds to the job.

years at Grinnell. Nye also play—
ed for six years before coming
to Grinnell where he has played
two years and coached for one
year.

Similar as their backgrounds
are, they difrer radically in
their approach to coaching. Nye
believes “As a coach, even one
only two years older than his
Squad, 1 feel there must be a

.mental distance between the
Iplayers and myself. It's not a
feeling of superiority, but a de—
sire to stand back from the
lplayers, to reach objectivity. I
don’t want to have a bias to—
ward any single player."

Henry dlﬂers, “I don’t want,

to put myself above them. I
would rather be one of them
and earn their respect in that
way.”
It is this some difference of I
approach toward coaching that l
makes the two such a good ‘
combination.

Nye provides the team withl
the traditional leadership imagei
of ‘the Coach.’ As backﬁeld
coach, he is an interested stu—
dent of football teaching tech
niques. This contrasts with Hen-
ry who is a coach in a more
physical manner. He leads the
team in calisthenics and active—
ly participates in all nonecontaet
drills with his linemen.

Although neither plans to
make coaching a career, they
both ﬁnd it a satisfying experi-
ence. Nye says, ”I’d just as soon
be playing, though i feel we’re
making a valuable contribution
here." Henry adds, “In the fall
it bothers me that 1 Can’t. play,
especially when the varsity has
games. Sometimes, I don’t even
want to go to see them play,
but 1 always seem to end up

 

there at the game."

field coach gives tips to two
of his charges.

Grinncll’s varsity football team
chalked up its rirst win of the
season last Saturday, beating
the Knox Siwash 35714,

Grinnell’s ﬁrst touchdown was
set up by a 20 yard pass play
from quarterback Dick Orchard
to end Dave Gauger. Orchard
scored from the three yard line
with 12:49 left in the second
quarter.

Fullback Joel Goldman drove

over for Grinnell’s second touch-
down with 2:58 left in the ﬁrst
half,
1 Knox scored with less than
a minute left in the half when
quarterback Duke Botthof pass—
ed to Don Harrington on a 47
yard scoring play. The half end—

Halfway thru the third quar-
'lel', Botthof completed a 35 yard
ipass which took Knox inside
lthe Grinneil ﬁve yard line.
lGrinnell held till fourth down
when pass interference in the
end zone was called against the
Pioneers. This gave the Siwash
the ball on the one yard line
with a ﬁrst down. Botthof ran
over (or the touchdown.

Pioneer halfback Dave Synr
horst returned the Knox kickoff
47 yards to get Grinnell‘s oi—
fensie moving in the third quar-

pitching, my loyalty isn‘t changed. I don‘t know whether
it‘s more of a National league favoritism, at Yankee hatred,

win their four games, the better.

by the Hamm’s hear
it is written in the Selective
Service Manual that an individ—
ual can be deferred from mili—
tary service if he has a specific
physical handicap or a perma-
nent injury that would leave
the person incapable of perform—
ting his military obligation. it
seems apparent that many of
Grinneli’s 1M jocks are using
the intramural program as a
means of sustaining injuries in
the hope that they will be of the
4—r caliber. Not only isn't this
the “Grinnell Image” but it
isn’t the true American spirit.
So stop banging beads together
and play bali.

There weren't many games
played last. Week but there was
plenty of action. Gates showed
East how to play the game and
Ialso beat South to remain unde—
feated and unscored upon. Clark
also remains undefeated and
tied with Gates for first place.
