Pioneers Fall to Cellar with Losses
To Coe and Beloii Over Weekend

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
lost two important ball games last
weekend and were dumped into
last place in the Midwest confer-
ence. Poor shooting and rebound-
ing were directly responsible for
the defeats in both contests.

Against Coe the Pioneers were
thoroughly outclassed by the husta
llng Kohawks. The Pioneers tried
the 1-3-1 zone defense that was ef-
fective against Augustana, but
sharp quick passes by Coo solved
that defense. Coe then spurred to
a 22-11 lead

After Coe scored on several easy
lay ups, Grinnell shifted into a
man-to-rnan defense which was a
little more effective. The Pioneers
cut their deficit to five points with
six minutes left but could get no
closer, Coe came back and took
‘ 39-30 halftime lead.

Coe took complete command in
the second half. The Kohawks'
leading scorer, Skip Swan, and
guard Mike Collis started scoring
and Coe pulled away to a Sixteen
point lead with twelve minutes 1‘8-
mainingl Then in these last twelve

 

minutes while Gi‘innell could only
manage to score nine points, Coe
Scored freely and eventually won
80-53.

Frigid shooting by Grinnell and
hot shooting by Coe was the differ»
ence. Grinnell could only hit on
30% of their shots, including 26%
in the second half, while Coe netted
51% of their shots. Coe also took
command of the backboards by
nut-rebounding Grinnell 45-26.

The Beloit game completed the
disastrous weekend, This game was
similar to the cue game except that
Beloit clinched the game by half-

time when it held a nearly incur:

mountable 54-36 lead. The second
half saw the second stringers getr
ting plenty of action with twelve
different Pioneers and eleven dif-
ferent Buccaneers eventually scor»
ing.

Grinnell’s shooting improved ov-
er the previous night, but unfnr~
tunately Eeloit had a hot night to
easily overcome Grinnell’s im-
provement. The Pioneers connected
on 42% of their shots but the Buc-
caneers hit 55% of their shots. Be-
loit also humbled the Pioneers in
rebounds 49-30.

SCARLET AND BLACK

By Paul Trigg

Although I have promised the editor that I would not resort to the
Clark nail level of discussing intramural sports, last week's Animal
Life column and Mr. Haveman’s allegation at last Tuesday night's
coffee hour that there is a lack at student incentive in scholarly pur-
suits have triggered me into prognosticating the Women’s intramural
basketball race. i attempt this analysis with two goals: to prove that
the writers of that column were in error when they predicted Loose
hall would Win tile championship, and to do this in such a fashion as
to assure its comprehension even by sportswriters who seem to have
trouble reading. 1 also attempt this under what i thought was an ob-
vlous assumption a that Loose hall is only eligible for the 1M league
on south Campus.

in picking Loose hall to win the basketball championship, my car
horts neglected the fact that lowa is the only state in the midwesi,
and one of the few states in the country, in which girl’s high School
basketball is played. Therefore, Iowa is the primary “recruiting
ground" of the midwest. Because of this factor, it. is not the hall with
the most out of state talent, but rather the hall with the most Iowa-bred
personelle which has the best chance of securing first place. Thus,
the obvious choice for the 1M championship is Cleveland hall which
houses 18 healthy, intellectual, corn—fed iowa girls.

Speaking of basketball, 1 promised three weeks ago that after the
University of lowa played U.C.L.A. and Michigan 1 would discuss
their situation again. i must confess that the Hawks fared somewhat
better than I thought they would. i did not see the U.c.L.A, game.
but from all accounts they beat the Bruins thoroughly with a very
strong game. I did see the Michigan game, however, which unfortu-
nately became a debacle. It must be a real nightmare to turn over
the ball seven straight times without a shot, or to watch your opponent
score 19 points in a row, but these things as well as the entire game
can be explained by three factors. First, and most obviously, the Hawks
played a poor game. Secondly, they lack experience which showed up
when faced by Michigan's awesome power and talent. Thirdly, Iowa
has no depth. Most of the time they have only four first rate players
on the noon As 1 stated earlier, they are a year away from having an
excellent team. With the addition of a few junior college transfers or
members of this year’s trosh team, they could win the title next year.
