Poor Taste to Verse

To the Editor:

There once was n man called SAGA Fred

Who thought he could fix up a prelly crude spread.
As the table was served, the taces grew pale,

For .there, right beiore them, lay dead ietal whale:
And, as it such a torture weren’t. bad enough.

The main course~oh horroi-slewas heel stroganoit,
As money is saved, the meals get tlat,

Yet, somehow, by miracle, ole Fred gets tat.
Though supposedly he eats what he puts out,

But we can't. digest it, its sight makes us shout.

Even breakfast is a bit of fun

With hardboiled eggs that tend to run.

And the places they hide all the onions is silly—

ln eggs, in baked beans. even two-day old chili.

out even that doesn‘t cause quite the twitch

As the pineapple slice in the grilled cheese sandwich.
Did you hear the poor, ole cowboy who cried,

“Sure is lonesome in the saddle since my spinach died."t
And when it comes Friday, you’ll see fasting Catholics
Whom, Fred insists, can survive on two iish slicks,

And as the meatloai is served, the Himalayan explorers all sing:
Put enough ketchup on it 7 we'll eat ouytlungl

The brownies, thank God, don’t make us sick,

But they’re uneatahle without hammer and pick.

I see now my verse is becoming a ballad,

Perhaps a Saga, or legend, about iello salad,

While the tone of this poem may seem rather quippy,
liust we eat the oldest tood “west of the Mississippi”?

then abandoned it to return to
Harvard for his junior year. How-

college campuses and in Negro
communities. Because of insuffic—

rely on private support.

To the Edilor:

Grinnell is E special kind of
school for special kinds_nf peo
ple. You have to be a little odd
to love Grinnull. For example you
have to enjoy walking down that
one railroad track, into the barn
dotted country side, as much as
you like an evening at the Red
Onion in New York City, You
have in be able to hibernate in
the library basement for all of
Jan. and rebxs gray days as
much as you enjoy plodding the
slushy streets or Chicago. You’ve
got to like bad coffee, well-done
steaks, and luke Warm showers in
plugged stalls. You must be able
to marry a hook tor nine months
running and call the matrimony
holy You have lo know how to
peacerully retreat with ii few
ivory tower profs and some semis
bright contemporaries and be hap-
py. BUT MOST IMPORTANT, you
have to_be able to tolerate, to
even enjoy, yourself. For that is
what Grinnail is all about. Your
self.

You spend iour years lucked
away in a little corner of town
finding oul what makes you lick.

ther face yourself on that rich
farm land or, like Mr. Schiff and
other ex-Grinnellians, you trans
fer to another school “to escape
an llnpossihile living situation."

I stayed at Grinneil, I found
out what, I believed and where I
wanted to go. in the silences or
those long Iowa winter: I dis-
covered some rather strange and
dear people, Together we ex
plored the back pages or some
remote writings a i . the far cor-
ners or our minds and dreams.
My Grinnell experience has served
me' well, extremely well. Thus.
unlike Mr. Schiff, 1 consider it a
privilege, as an alumna, to as
sist in the support of Grinnell.

‘Fitth Year' Student Describes
A ‘Typical Day' at Ahmednagar

By DONALD BOGUE

Edi Note: Donald nogue is l
Travel-Service Scholar spend-
lng his ‘Fifth Year Abroad!

As many of you probably already
know, Ahmednagar College is an
Indian college which is located
about 150 miles inland from Bom-
hay and has a student body of
about 2500, The connections be
tween this college and Grinneli
are quite close, since for the last
tour or five years, Grinnell grad-
uates have had the opportunity [0
come to this college and work for
a year. This year not only i. but
also Professor Wayne Denny (phy-
sics) and his wife are spending a
year here,

For the last week or so, I have
been debating as to what the best
method oi telling you what lndia
is like or at least giving you an
idea of what I am doing here at
Ahmednagar. Maybe the best
method would be to give you a
run-down on how i spend a day
here at this college. Take today,
Saturday, November 27th, for in-
stance. ln one way, Saturdays are
unusual days for me, because ev—
ery Saturday at 7:30 arm, I be-
come a professor for one hour and
a half and conduct a Class for
the senior psychology students. I
teach an experimental psychology
practical (laboratory). During the
year the students are supposed to
learn how to do twenty-rive ex-
periments so that they can per-
fan-n them Well on their final elk
aminations next March. 50 after
a quick breakfast in my room, I
went oil to class to try to teach
my fifteen psychology students
how to do an experiment which
tests a person's manual dexterity.
i always have a little trouble com-
municating my ideas to these stu-
dents. They don’t know English
very well, and l imow very little
Marathi. HOWBVBI‘. after listening
to me talk to them in English
and then talking among them-
selves in Marathi, the students us-
ually figur- out fairly well how to

 

do the experiments and how to
write them up afterwards. Today’l
lesson wasn’t too difficult to ex-
plain, so i think the students um
dersmnd it fairly well.

After my class was over, i went
over to the iaculty tea, which
takes place every morning at I
a.rn. Tea is the most important
drink around here, and every good
Indian stops work in the middl'
oi the morning and in the middle
of the afternoon in order to hav.
a cup of tea loaded with milk land
sugar (just like the American coi-
lee break),

After tea I went back to my
room to bone-up on a little Maia
athi (the language oi this region)‘
were my lesson in this language
at if a.m. A student is now leaclr
ing nie Marathi tor a short period
each day, so i have succeeded in
learning a few words and phrases.
Marathi is fairly difficult because
the script and some or the sound-
are very diiterent than English, but
it is worth the effort in he abln
to carry on simple conversation!
with the students and the sen-
vants.

At 11:30 one ot my trienao
here on campus, a Muslim fellow
who is taking education courses at
the college, paid a call. He is quite
interested in religion, so I decided
to cut my Marathi lesson short
and spend an hour discussing is.
