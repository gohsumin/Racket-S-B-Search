Dunner Discusses Cuba

Cont, from p. 2

“It is my hope and my con-
viction that in the not too
distant iuturc it will be 17057
sible ior the historic iriend-
ship, hetueen us, once again to
iind its reilection in normal,
relations oi every Sort. Mean-
whilc, our sympathy goes out
to the people oi Cuba now
suffering under the yoke oi
a dictator."

I tor one, can not detect in
Mr, Eisenhower's statement a
“policy oi hostility toward Cu-
ba," to the Cuban people. On
Jan. 16, 1961, the Department
oi stale announced “that in
view of the u, s. governincnt‘s'
inability. following the break in
diplomatic relations between the
United statcs and Cuba, to ex-
tend noinial protective services
to Ameiicans visiting Cuba, Us,
citizens desiring to go to
Cuba niusl, until further 110»
ticc, obtain passports speciiically
endorsed by the Department oi
Slate ioi- such travel. . .cxcep—
tions to thesc regulations will
be granted to persons whose
travel may regarded as be-
ing in the best interests or the
United States, such as newsmen
or businessmen with previously
established business interests. . ,

“These actions have been.
taken in coniorinity with the
department’s normal practice
oi limiting travel to those
countries with which th e
United states does not mainr
tnin diplomatic delations."
Notice that during several
months preceding the issuance
of what amounts to a “limited
travel ban," such as was Impose
ed on the travel or United
States citizens to Nazi Germany
when similar conditions had an
risen there. U, S. citizens in
Cuba had been sentenced to
heavy prison penalties by “Re-
volutionary Tribunals" without
having been granted an oppor-
tunity to confer with the (line
lomatic representation of the
US, in Cuba or the Swiss Logan
tion which, at the request oi
the U. 5 Government. had as
greed to represent U. s. inter»
ests in Cuba.

In this respect, it should he
made clear that aliens are sub-
ject to the laws oi the coun-
try in which they happen to
be. But, it the humarcollntry
oi the alien can claim “denial
of justice" or “deficiency in
the administration or the judie
cial or remedial process," it
is entitled to submit the issue
to govenimental negotiation.
In the Cuban case, such dipr
Jomatic settlement has become
nearly impossible, as the lions
disputes by arbitration or re
course to the world court (now
the International Court oi JllSv
tice).

Consequently, the U S. gov-1
ernmcnt is conlrontcd with the‘
choice oi warrllkc measures in
behalf oi those citizens, who,
ior one reason or another. have
been suhiect to “denial ot ju
lice" or the is- iance oi a warn-
int,r to its citizens lhai by going.
In a country like Cuha they,
loose the customary protection
oi the U 5. Government,

policies, might have produced the

American trade relations with
Cuba. Let me again quote '4 rl»
lease of the State Department
which speaks for itse][

On Oct. 15), 1360, two and one
half nmnlhs before Cubll issued
its ultimatum, the State Dev
pal-tmellt: “Over the course oi
the past 21 months the United
States has been subjected hy
the Castro regime to all '
creasing campaign of host
and slander.

“Accompanying its words wilh
actions. the goveininent ot‘ Cuba
instituted zl SL‘I of orbitraly

twmic measures which have my
lut‘Cd thousands of American
citizens and have drastically ale
tcrcd the hitherto mutudlly bent”
[iclal pattern of trdde betnecn
the United States and Cuba,”

Illuotl‘allVC of what has hdpr
pened is the iact that the more
ment of the United States exports
to Cuba has been reduced to less
than 50 percent of the figure in
1958, and that came to power.
Meanwhile, Cuban exports to
the United Slates remained nor-
mal until July of this year, when
it became necessary to reduce the
Cuban sugar quotato provide fol"

pal incasureses taken by the gov-
ernmcnt of Cuba aimed at rcduc-,

None of these measures can

adequate. Rather they are the
