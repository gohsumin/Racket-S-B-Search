Past Spring Riots Cause Current Concern

By KRISTI RENNEBOHM

The Senate is now in the process
of reevaluating Spring Riot in
terms of its mounting property
damage and bills from BXLGT A
review of past Spring Riots re
veals the validity of their concern.

On Tuesday night, May 9, 1961,
North Campus men invaded the
Quad and remained inside the
locked loggia after hours. Fortun»
ately, the would-be riot caused lit-
the damage. Costs came to ap-
proximately $10.00.

The Riot on Wednesday, April
25, 1962, was a diiierent story. The
hall presidents were kidnapped
and taken to a deserted school-
house. According to the S St B re
port, the riot “was not an lrre
sponsible student outburst” but
rather“‘a well planned affair con-
trolled by various student lead-
ers.” The S 8: B regarded it as “a
substitute for the potentially dan-
gerous panty raid type of nut-
burst.” It stated that there was
"no malicious damage inflicted to
property in the incident.” How
ever, costs ran up to $117.39 in
addition to the $183.50 fine paid
by students for vandalism.

On Sunday night, May 5, 1963,
one of the longest and noisiest
water fights in the hisotry of Grin-
nell took place on North Campus.
Approximately 150 students had the
pleasure of drenching and drown-
ing one another,

0n the following evening, May 6,
another unofficial riot began with
the Burling library lights being
cut off. This was followed by men
breaking into the women’s dorms.
This riot turned out to be one oi
the most successful ones in the his»
tory of Grinnell.

That same week, on Tuesday
night, May 7, the oiiicially planned
Spring Riot took place, The com?
and AWS board members were
kidnapped and a dance was held.

) Senate

(Continued trorn Page 1)

spoke against the resolution, point-
ing out that halls lacked the power
to collect assessments against indi-
viduals.

Bob Foote answered that stu-
dents who fail to pay hall ﬁnes
may be taken to the Pr la ry
Court, Where an additionai fine is
possible, and that students who
rail to pay court tines may be
brought to the attention of the
Faculty Committee on Student Ai-
fairs.

Another part of the resolution
notifies the Student Auditor “that
it would be unwise to have hall
social tunds used to pay for dani—
ages.”

The Senate also sent to the ad-
ministration a proposal to extend
telephone hours to one hali hour
after the present women’s hours.
Ron Fiscus reported that 65 per
cent of the questionnaires returned
favored that particular time.

And the Senate continued its

concern with the most prominent is»

me of the last SGA‘ campaign:
ltudent involvement. Currently the
Senate and Coil-[P are organizing
committees to examine (a) the
tar-rule; (b) the Men's Primary
Court; (c) college transportation;
((1) curricular, affairs; (e) open
rooms; and (1) Building and!
Grounds.

 

Activities ended quietly at mid-
night as the students were exhaust-
ed from the previous two riots.
The total cost at these three riots
was approximately $140.00.

In the spring of 1964, another
successful riot was held. The elec-
tricity on campus was turned off
in all buildings. Water fights went
on all over North Campus and a
dance was held on the roof of
Cowles. The good time that was
had by the students cost $244.93.

On Tuesday, May 4, 1965. a

fight broke out on North Campus
which turned into a spontaneous
riot. It migrated to South Campus
where the rioters broke into the
loggia at 12:30 am. Students wan-
dered around and marched
through the loggia. Attempts
were made to get the girls out»
side either on their own accord
or by force. The unofficial riot
ended at 1:45 am Damage was
remarkably light —- two windows
and locks were broken and a few
screens were pushed out.

On the following Thursday, May
6, 1965, the ofﬁcial Spring Riot
took place. There were fireworks,
water tights and “happy” Grin-
nellians ﬂoating around Broken
glass and small fires were seen
around campus. The total bill for
these two riots came to $999.85

The high cost of damage done
during the riots at Grinnell is the
reason for Senate's concern and
re-evaluation of the traditional
Spring Riot.

Group Still linvolvetl.
But Who Gan Know?

Gl‘innell’s Committee on Student
Involvement, GCSI which, by the
way, is still in existence, is going
“through a state of flux” accord-
ing to the group’s leader, Dale
Levine. He stated that the pun
pose (sic) of the committee had
not changed substantially, but that
there were some “questions." He
did not elucidate.

It was noted that at the meet»
ing of campus leaders on the topic

oi involvement, there was a det-
inite scarcity of members or thu

group.
