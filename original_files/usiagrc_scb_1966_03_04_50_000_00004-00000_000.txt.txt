Buck had been removed after re-
ceiving considerable negative
comment from local people who
felt them to be "obscene“ or “of
questionable taste.”

As the faculty members met to
consider the censorship, they were
handed sheets by the students stat-

ing: “We, the students of Cornell
College, feel that censorship of any
work of art — regardless of the

 

Faculty Meeting

content or appeal of the art — is
detrimental to the intellectual
growth at the students of the col-
lege.” The students outside carried
such signs as “Ban the ‘Ban’ ",
and “Pornography is in the eyes oi
the beholder.”

In the faculty meeting a major-
ity decided to prevent censorship
of this type from occurring, and
Buck's drawings were tehung im-
mediately alter the meeting.
