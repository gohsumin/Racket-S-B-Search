Scronion's 'Aciion Noi' Words'

Promises GOP

Just who is William Warren
Scranton, Governor of Penn-
sylvania, and why has he roc»
keted to the eminent position
of a potential Republican Presi~
dential candidate? Why do men
like Hubert Humphrey view
'Scranton as the toughest pos-
sible candidate for the Demo-
crats_to defeat in November?

SCRANTON

How did Scranton manage to
achieve such outstanding politi-
cal recognition in just; three
years of government service?

The answers to these ques-
tions can be capsulized: Be-
cause in Scranton’s unassail-
able position as a man whose
public and private motives are
one and the some, he has man-
aged, in one short year, as
Pennsylvania’s governor, to
lead his state in the direction
of amazing political and eco»
nonlic recovery, His progress
has recoived national acknowl-
edgment and approval, Penn-
sylvania, like the U. S. is con-
fronted with the political prob-
lem of the twentieth century—
how to adjust human communi-
ties to the violent jolting of in-
dustrial change.

In 1962 Scranton, fresh from
a tremendous gubernatorial
plurality of 486,000 votes, faced
Pennsylvania‘s problems head—
on. in an aggressive yet sensi—'
ble message to the General As—
sembly he presented his pace-
aetting, progress~making pro-
gram, In less than a year he
had 90% of his program passed
by the legislature. With a ”don’t
tell ’em, show ’em attitude, he
had become more than a talk-
ing governor. His dynamic ad-
ministrative ability and genuine
public interest awarded Penn-
sylvania with a new hopeful
climate, ‘

When Scranton’s outstanding
achievements were recognized
and lnuded, his abilities were
projected on a nation-wide lev-
ei. Americans began to won-
der if he could do for his coun-
try, what he did for his state,
Subjected to such demanding
scrutiny, Scranton denied any
serious thoughts of becoming
a Republican presidential can-
didate. although he admits it
would be his “duty" to accept
an honest draft, Meanwhile, he
has become the most active
non-candidate in t h e field.
Scranton has developed the coy

'Honesi Drofi'

play as effectively as any ma-
jor politician in recent history.
The more he says “no," the
more interest he stirs up.

The 46 year old governor was
born and raised ten miles
north of Scranton, Pennsylvan-
ia, the city that bears the name
of his early ironrsmelting an-
cestors, He graduated from
Yale University in 1939 with a
a, A. in history. After mar-
riage and service in World War
ll as an Air Force pilot, he
returned to Yale and received
a law degree in 1946. As a
young businessman he built up
a reputation as a trouble shoot-
er for ailing industries. For 13
years he served on every level
of local activity,

Then in 1060 he was elected
to the U. S. Congress from
Pennsylvania's 10th District by
16,915 votes, while Presiden—
tial candidate Kennedy won the
same district by 14,963. In 1982
Scranton was elected governor
over Richard Dillworth — for
whom Kennedy campaigned—
by 486,000 votes. The Demo»
'crats had a 210,000 registration
lead in the state at the time.
In both elections, Scranton was
drafted by the party leader-
ship. Even though he main<
tains a detached attitude to-
ward politics, he has shown
himself to be a superb combat
commander. He is fascinated
by politics and once committed
to action or a race, becomes a
tactful, progressive leader. He
believes that duty, not politics,
beckons him and this gives him
the enviable position of self-
confidence; Scranton's person-
ality is something special. He
has an easy manner with pea»
ple, yet manages to remain
what he is, an aristocrat of
wealth and parts.

Scranton has expressed his
views on a variety of current
issues,

CIVIL RIGHTS: Approves of
the objectives of the civil rights
bill before Congress. Believes
the Federal Government should
take positive action on public
accommodations.

BUDGET: He is a balanced
budget man and doesn’t believe
in deficit spending He is not a
Keynesian theorist.

MEDICARE: Feels a need
for additional federal legislab
tion, but opposes medicare fi-
nanced by Social Security de-
ductions, Proposes financing
health care out of general tax
revenues.

FOREIGN AID: Supports for-
eign aid but is war 'ed about
Latin American distribution
Thinks the US should be able
to cut down on foreign aid
since there is an enormous
backlog in accumulated appro-
priations.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Feels
that the U. S, must have a
strong foreign policy, When-
ever Communists threaten the
free world, a strong stand must
be taken, even though there
may be danger.

William Scranton is a man
with the earmarks of a great
President. Neither lust for pow»
er, entrancement with leader-
ship or an inner self—doubt stirs
this governor's mind as much

 

as the nature of duty. He be-

tions, that convinced the late
John F. Kennedy to name
Lodge ambassador to South
Viet Nam in June of 1963. Dur~
ing his tenure in Viet Nam,
Lodge has managed to make
himself more than the hoped-
for non-Democratic buffer be-
tween the Administration’s
Southeast Asian policy and the
forthcoming election. In fact, he
has not let political considera-
tions interfere witll pushing
American efforts, He has shown
skill and toughness in exercis-
ing a co-ordinating hand over a
15,000 man U. S. military mis-
sion and heavily staffed Central
Intelligence Agency. w h i c h
tended to work at cross pur-
poses with each other and the
State Department under prev~
ious ambassadors,

His position on United States
policy is this: stand up or get
out. Yet standing up, for
Lodge, does not necessarily
carry with it an appeal to
arms, Rather. to stand up is to
fight inaction. “It is not enough
for us to be so strong that the
Communist countries are afraid
to attack us or encroach furth-
er on the rest of the world.
We are already strong enough
for that. We must do more; we
must lead the world to a last-

lieves in public, not pol lcal
office,

As a possible Presidential
candidate William Scranton has
a poWerful factor on his side—
his potent ability to unite the
Warring Republican P a r t y.
Among the middle of the road
Republicans there is an active
enthusiasm while right wing—
ers feel no hostility, Scranton's
unblemished record as a lead—
and a vote-getter is an indica-
tion of his ability to lead the
Republican Party to a victory
in 1964,

 

ing peace where true disarma-
ment will be possible.” Clearly
Lodge is most capable in the
area of international relations.

While Lodge's popular ap-
peal has been based largely up-
on his diplomatic ability, he
has not been one to neglect the
internal affairs of the nation,
As a senator, he was far less
hostile than most Republicans
to the New Deal, and he went
on record for the Wagner Act,
the Wages and Hours Act, and
in 1939 he sought to amend the
Social Security Act to increase
old age payments. His support
of the New Deal programs
along with his opposition to the
industry-wide. compulsory bar-
gaining clause of the Taft-
Hartley Act has made labor
more than usually receptive to
a Republican candidate, al-
though his official record on
labor problems ends in 1952
with his appointment to_the
UN.

Lodge has not been a John—
ny-come-lately to the questions
and problems of racial segre»
gation. In 1950, in an article
for the Atlantic Monthly,
Lodge proposed to end racial
segregation in the armed
forces and in housing projects
and educational projects fi-
nanced by the Federal gov-
ernment. In addition to numer-
ous statements made during
the 1960 campaign stressing

the need for a strong civil rights
platform, Lodge made known
his desire to include a qualified
Negro in the cabinet. should the
Republicans be elected.

Lodge, in a speech made at
the end of his 1960 campaign
indicated support for an active
federal role. He said, “We can
overcome the prejudice and de<
iects in understanding which
still stand between some of our
citizens and full opportunity.
We can provide the schools,
the medical care, the hospitals,
where these are needed.”

His awareness of pressing
constitutional issues has been
in the forefront, In 1950 he co-
sponsored the Lodge-Basset
Amendment, passed by the
Senate but turned down by the
House, which sought to do
away with the “antiquated"
electoral college.

In short, the aura of experi-
ence which has surrounded
Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., has
created a tradition of ability
both in diplomacy and in=poll--
tics, a tradition which won him
the support of Republicans in
New Hampshire.
