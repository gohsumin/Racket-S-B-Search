began to be debated again when
the faculty approved the recom~
mendations of its Executive
Council. They suggested that
freshman dorms be established,
that iipperclassmen rotate be

there was no North Campus
Problem. Respondents w e r e

nell. theatrical season this year

“The Fantastics,“ a contem«
pol‘ary hit musical. 'The Dream
Play,” an expressionistic drama
by August Strindberg was pro-
duced and directed by Howard
Horned. Tradition was broken
when Henrerork Steiner, an

yet over, “Slow Dance on The
