lHUAC

Cont. irom p. 2 .
in favor of the HUAC is disputa—
ble, although the observation is
sound

And Gordon Schcrer, repre-
sentative irom Ohio closes the
narration with the elucidating
remark that we have seen
“Communism with its mask
ripped off," all this to musical
accompaniment.

The climax oi the demonstra—
tion comes when the students are
driven out of the building by
water hoses, The students‘ reac—
tion is dcsc bed as lawless and
violent opposition to police forces
and the rilni illustrates this atti-
tude showing the students clown
ly back away trom the hoses
with their hands shielding their
races.

There are numerous other de—
vices uscd in the film to present
the HUAC stand in a positive
light. such as the scene or pure
pathos in which a very unhappy
ol ycar old policeman is shown
iniuied troni the contusion duiu
ing the hosine, .
. Also a long sequence at the end
or the film presents pcrsons un-
der questioning bcroi-c the HUAC.
This cannot tail but deter one
from the main question which
should be discussed, whether or
not thc demonstration was just:

The most common device,
however, is the invalidation or
various nersons’ statements by
simply dismissing them to the
category ot “typical Commun-
ist tactics." .

There are too many such de-
vices here to enumerate enti elv,
but they tend to make a Signifi-
cant point. Because the film
avoids the maior issue, that be.
ing the specitic cause of the
demonstration. but rather con.
cerns itself with saying what's
bad about Communism and
what's good about the HUAC, it
can onlv be considered properly
as a rather transparent presenta-
tion of propaganda de 'Ce t
as a proot ofﬁn’ny sor
