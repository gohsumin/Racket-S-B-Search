determined by inference from
her class year. The police de<
partment has a directory which
lists the years of all students
of the college.

“1 instruct my officers to
check in the bars every night.
Sometimes things come up, and
they don’t make it,” said
Peters.

if a minor has no identifica-
tion card, the store can he pe-
nalized for servmg him alco-
holic beverages. H the student
has a false identification card,
the store is not liable for pun-
ishment. Last year one store
lost its license for selling beer
to minors.

“Judge Soft”

"The justice of the peace may
be getting soft," said Peters.
He was explaining that the
iines for possession of beer
were always $100, but that now
the lines were often only 525.

“Making beer available to a
minor would be tougher. You’re
stepping up in the leagues
then." Any adult giving beer to
anyone under 21, or even any-
one just over 18 giving beer to
another minor would be subject
to a fine of no less than $300.
but no more than $1000 or 3
months to a year in jail. The
crime is classified as an in-
dictable misdemeanor.

“College students are doing
this all the time. I know it.”
The chiei of police elaborated,
saying that it he could get e .
dence of this he would not he -
tate at all in bringing charges
against any college student
bringing liquor oi any kind to
E friend.

When asked how he knew
that college students were
traiiicking in beer, he said,
"We have ways.” He would not
elaborate.

“Last yeari called in 15 or
20 college students who were
smoking marijuana. I would
have taken them to court if I
could have gathered evidence
legally."

Justice of the Peace Edwin
Lincoln, who levied the line on
the sophomore girl, said that all
fines went to the school fund of
Poweshiek County. This
amounts to between ploooiioo
a month.

MED STUDENTS
Grinnell has sent more than

from buying enough books to
really save money. Uniortu-
nately there is little hope of
doing anything to reduce the
price of books. The turnover is
just not large enough to sell
hooks at discount prices.

The prices of cosmetics and
drugs are set by the wholesale
supplier. According to Lambie,
prices are deliberately high.
The reason is to avoid any
competition with Grinnell mer<
chants. Even if this policy were
abandoned, the volume of drugs
and cosmetics sold is too small
to allow the store to purchase
sufficient quantities which
would be necessary to reduce
prices.

Those sticky price tags can
be removed. Wassom said that
a sunlamp will do the trick. I!
you are iussy you will have to
bake your books, The sticky
tags prevent price switching in
the store and they are con-
venient for the clerks during
the book rush at the beginning
of each semester.

The most important iunction
of the bookstore is to supply
students with the appropriate
texts. This function is not al-
ways luliilled. As a result many
students are without texts for
as long as three weeks. This is
inexcusable. Enough b o o k 3
should be ordered in advance.

Wassom argued that “It’s
hard to guess exactly how
many books will be needed."
He does not have to guess. Free
registration lists indicate ap-
proximately how many students
will be taking each course.
Wassom uses this list when he
orders books. However, many
more students sign up {or a
course than is indicated through
pro-registration. Surplus books
can be sent back. More than
enough books should be ordered
to insure that every student
will have one. some publishers
have stringent regulations re
garding the return of books and
not all books can be returned.
in these inirequent cases, the

college should absorb the loss
(which should not be too great).

Wassom contends that there
is not enough room to allow or-
dering more books than ap<
pears necessary. He added that
lack or adequate space is the
most serious problem concern<
ing the bookstore. Not enough
books can be displayed and the
volumes on the shelves are
crowded together. This makes
finding a particular title very
difficult. The shelves are also
too close together, making it
almost impossible for two
people to look in the same sec<
tion at the same time. IT was-
sum is concerned about this
problem, I think a solution
could be found.

Last year the Library Com-
mittee was presented with a
mandate from the laculty to in-
vestigate the problem of space
in the bookstore. The back or
the store is now used {or stor-
age. This could he transtoi-med
into a display area if another
location were found to serve as
a storage space. While the lac-
ulty committee did not have
sufficient time to investigate all
the possibilities (the mandate
is still before the committee),
some suggestions were pro-
posed. The college building
downtown is equipped with a
service elevator. P e r h a p s
available room there could be
used ior storage space. Another
suggestion was to use a small
section of the service building
for storage. Wassom, however,
was reported to be “complete
ly unwilling to innovate.”

Another possibility would be
to convert the women’s gym
Into a bookstore. Lamhie said
that he was in favor of such a
suggestion, although other uses
for the building have also been
proposed.

if more space were used,
many of the serious problems
could be solved. Enough room
would then be available to stock
a suiiiment number of text-
books. Also, perhaps a greater
number of books (other than
texts) could be purchased at
one time. This would result in
lower prices. l-lopeiully the Li-

Frank and Lew, appointed last

Faculty jurors are appointed

The present Judicial Council
signiiicantly differs from the
Judicial Council system oi
three years ago. The earlier
version was very structured and
consisted entirely of students,
Although the council had orig
nal jurisdiction in studese di
cipline cases, its decisions were
reviewed and could be rejected
by the Faculty Committee on
Student Allah‘s. This dualistic
system was replaced by the
present Judicial Council, which
combines a student jury and
iaculty jury by having a single
jury consisting or three stu-
dents and three faculty mem<
hers.

The Judicial Council at Grin-
nell is not powerless, but, to
quote lrom the Grinnell College
Student Handbook: ‘The Judicial
Council shall have original jun
isdiction in all cases in which
violations of college regulations
are alleged to have occurred
except those cases in which the
House Councils have original
jurisdiction.” That is, Judi a]
Council has original jurisdic-
tion in trying any offender oi
the college rules, regardless of
whether he is turned in by his
House, BKtG men, or individual
students, except when the de-
iendant is appealing a verdict
decided upon by his house
Council.

Furthermore, except tor hav-
ing to be approved by President
Leggett, the Judicial Councl]
verdicts are final. Depending on
the seriousness of the crime,
the council may impose fines,
conduct probation, suspension,
or expulsion.

brary Committee will not neg«
lect this problem, and hopeful-
ly Wassom will he more recep<
tive to suggestions in the future.
