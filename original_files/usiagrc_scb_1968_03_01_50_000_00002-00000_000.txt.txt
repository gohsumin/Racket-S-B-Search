living the Committee supports
“the offering of more extensive
living options for students who
reside off-campus either in col-
lege-owned facilities or in pri-
vate homes and apartments next
year,”

Student members have indl<
cated, however, that it will be
up to the student seeking pri-
vate-owned housing to find it.

An attitude in which the Cola
lege does not aid students to
find housing in town was cited
as a major stumbling block to
the Committee’s recommddatlon
for “uncrowding” men’s resi<
dencc halls.

SECURITY CHECKERS

A ﬁnal recommendation of the
Commit e's report to Leggett
is the hiring of three “security
check women,“ one for the junc-
ture of men’s and women’s halls
on South campus, one for the
juncture on North, and one for
the Younkers.

With reference to the Com-
mittee’s recommendations, Cogs<
well said that “President Leg-
gett is in broad agreement with
the plan."

The President has serious
doubts, however, as to whether
the College can handle the fi.
nancial hunden that incorporat-
ing the full package of recom-
mendations would entail.

Consequently. he has asked
[Dr and received from the Com-
mittee a set of alternative plans
scaled from $65,000 to $14,000,
which in eltect sets priorities
on each of the items in the
original list of recommendations.

The Student Affairs Committee
has given the proposed student
advisory system highest priority.

HISTORIANS THREATEN EUROPE 1
MOBILIZE PLASTIC ARMIES '

By SUE MILLER
& ADRIENNE LEMMONS
5&1! Staff Writers

Students in Professor Terry
Parssinen's European History
338 class were asked to take
over Western Europe last week.

The class was asked to play
it game called Diplomacy at
least twice. The object of the
game—stated in the instruc-
tions—is to “take over all of
Europe.”

Diplomacy consists of a map
board of Europe and plastic
markers which slgully armies
and navles. The method of win-
ning the game is gaining con—
trol of territories and extend-
ing one’s own borders as far
as possible.

The player whose manifest
destiny is greater than his op-
ponents is the winner, Parssi~
nen explained briefly.

“By rational calculation of
expected benefits and expected
losses,” he said, "the game is
to some extent the way com-
petition with countries actually
works.”

“To play Diplomacy as a
game, one is forced to give
serious arm-chair thought to the
underlying factors influencing
decision-makers in the game
and in real diplomacy," he con-
tinned.

After playing Diplomacy, stu-
dents were required to read
Laforo’s The Long Fuse and to
write a paper comparing the
eisioomaking factors of the
board game and of those elm
cidated in the book about the
origins of World War 1.

The game alone, Parssioen
stressed, is “of course only an
oversimpliﬁed version or real
diplomacy."

In playing the game, a stu-
dent decides “not only the most
rational course to maleize his
best interests, but must cone
vince the other players that it
is in meir best interest to act
in accordance with that course.

In Diplomacy n player can
matte agreements with oppo-
nents prior to actually moving.
An element of reality is added
because there is nothing in the
game requiring agreeing par-
ties to keep their respective
words.

“To make and break alliances
. . . this is where the pro-
longed diplomacy takes place,
not in the moving of the plastic
markers about the map," the
professor further explained.

The game board represents

about fifty geographical areas,
most of which compose seven
countries: England, France, in
lily> Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Turkey, and Russia. Plastic
markers represent armies, and
havies which can capture the
geographical areas.

Each geographical area can
potentially “supply” either one
army or one navy, and to re«
main in the game a player must
retain at least one supply point.

lnilially each country has a
number of armies or navies
depending on whether they are
a sea power or a land power
and on the number of native
supply points within the coun-
Iry.

During the first turn forces
strike out and attempt to cap
ture neutral supply points in
order to increment their forces.

During subsequent turns the
nations form coalitions and a1:
liances in which each side
weighs in balance the eilect of
such cooperative, measures in
the spirit of Von Neumann game
theory.

Parssinen Said he got the
idea to use the game from some
fellow graduate students at
Brandeis University a few years
ago. Althoug1 some of them
now use this method as a teach
ing aid, the idea had not been
practiced at that time.

“The rage was Bogcy moviel
and Diplomacy games," Parss-
inen said of his grad school
days,

He added that the main idea
in having students play the
game was “to teach people to
understand things from the his
side out, not the outside in. , .
Books—l mean this in the best
Collingwoodinn sense of the
word—sometimes do not do this.‘

“Some games make you re-
think the situation in doing, not
in watching,” he avowed. “This
is the best value games can
hav

have employed games as teach
ing aids. Professor John Wor-
iey used “Wff ’n Proof," a logic
game originated at Yale Uni.
versity, in his Symbolic Logio
classes last year.

Parssinen said he found wo-
men make very poor Diplomacy
players. “They can‘t detach
themselves (from the game)
personally.”
