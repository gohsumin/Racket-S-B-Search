ENOAMPMENT
TO BE AT
NEWTON

By MARTHA BERKEY

The 1967 Grinnell Encamp-
ment will be held Oct. 13-15 at
the Christian Conference Cew
ter near Newton, The event will
signal the exodus of sixty-five
students and twenty-five iacul—
ty and administration mem<
hers for a weekend of batting
brains together over problems
of the college community.

Encampment C o m m i t t e a
Chairman Tom Triplett ex-
plained in an 5&5 interview
this Week that the number of
student delegates has been in-
creased by 15 over last year’s
total “in a real effort to get
Wider representation of students
and a cross-section of all stu<
dent opinion." For the first
time, freshmen will be able to
apply. Applications will be
available next week.

“We want interested and in-
formed students," said Triplett.
“We are trying to de-empha-
size the elitist concept which
has grown up around encamp-
menti We want to broaden the
delegation from the standard
crew of student 'leaders in
elecled posulons." 0f the scope
of discussion topics, Triplett
voiced a hope for a more spe-
cific focus on campus issues
rather than the philosophic
themes of last year's encamp-
ment.

Other committee members
are Debbie Nelson, Peg Slice,
Hubert Farbes, Jim Peacock,
and Greg Wallace.

STUDENT 0N
LEMOYNE YEAR

By ANNE JENKINS

Perhaps the most frequent
question which has been asked
since my return from LeMoyne
has concerned the attitudes of
the students, their beliefs and
goals. LeMoyne’s student body
is no more a monolithic entity
than is Grinnell's: it is, in fact,
probably less so.

LeMoyne is a non-resident
Negro college, with almost all
students coming irom Memphis.
With no dormitories, students
have little opportunity to learn
beyond the time they are on
Campus; there is little chance
of integration and learning with
other students. This places more
importance on the professor,
and as yet, the professor in
most cases has not provided
either enough demand on or
stimulation for the student.

Planning for dorms is pro-
gresslng, but nothing will be
done Tor a few years. (Presi-
dent Price has served the col-
lege for 25 years, and will leave
the problem of converting Le-
Moyne to a residential school
to his successor.) Until thil

unveiling ceremonies on central Campus.

CAMPUS BICYCLES UNVEILED

A small number of students,
attracted by mysterious “Un-
veiling” signs, attended the pre
sentation of the first two David
M. Gibson Memorial Bikes to
the student body of Grinnell Col-
lege last Saturday on Central
Campus.

Master of Ceremonies Jim
Arieti began a count-down min
utes before the presentation be-
gnn.

An onlooker entered into the
momenous spirit by remarking
that the maid staff would be
unhappy it they could see that
Grinnell sheets were being used
as veils.

Another member of the group,
a recent victim of a bicycle
theit, had to be reassured that
the bikes had been legally pur-
chased the night before. As the
moment of unveiling neared, the
onlookers became respectiul,
aware of the importance of the
occasion.

With proper acknowledgement
of form, Mrs Arieti broke a but-
tle of spirits (’2) over the cov-
ered (arms, and then unveiled
the two bikes.

The bikes, a boy‘s and a
girl‘s, freshly painted orange

and red, were presented to two
representatives of the student
body, who promptly put them
to use by riding off. Further
bikes will be financed through
the sale of the David M. Gibson
Memorial Magazine and dona-
tiuns.

HOUSE PRESIDENTS WANT
LIBERAL ROLES LEGALLY

The following statement was read at the open Senate meet-
ing Wednesday by West Norris House President John Wiles.

We, the members of the Council of House Presidents and of
the Associated Women Students Board, both as individual leaders
and as representative of student interest and opinion, believe that
an expression of open dorms is integral to the realization of social
and intellectual goals of‘the College, and wish to state our Syﬂ'h
pathy with the dissatisiaction of those who would now declare their
independence from present college social regulations. We must ob-
ject, however, to any impettious. irresponsible, or potentially dam-
aging method proposed as an initial effort to achieve social reform.
We believe that [he opens question constitutes a valid issue in it<
self. but that it is but one of several important areas of college
life with which we and the general community should be concerned.
Moreover, in the consideration oi any proposal ior significant al-
teratlon in present social or academic conditions we respect and
fully recognize the necessity for maintaining facultyrstudent and
admlnlstration-student rapport as essential to the orderly pursuit or
progressive changes in the college environment.

We would like to state our conviction that the present open
dorms rule is a restriction which not only is unecessary to the
safety and wellrbelng of members of the college community, but
also is seriously inhibilive to a desirable development of individual!
who can accept. or be challenged to accept, the ultimate responsi-
bllity for their actions and for the respect which is due to others.
To us the structural ieatures of this college have already con-
tributed much to sustaining a sheltered sort of environment in
which parochialism, restricted horizons, and individual irrespons‘
bility can develop, survive. and flourish, We believe that we must
and should make a concerted effort as student leaders and repres
sentatives to oppose and remove unreasonable restriction on the
individual. We therefore commit ourselves to a program ot fro<
quent and iruitiul discussions with Student, faculty, and administra<
tinn. of such issues as the institution of an alternating dorm
structure. the possibility for academic revision, and a significant
relaxation of existing social regulatons.

The present rules on open dorms constitute, to us, a regret-
able social restriction. We exhort the administration and faculty to
respect the honesty of our criticisms, to listen with open minds to
our expressions oi justiﬁcation, and to be receptive to reasonable
arguments and requests for any reform. in the meantime, we re-
assert our dedication to pursue the changes initially through tlle ex-
isting legal system
