lenox String Quartet prefers -
silent audiences more closets

“Gl‘ilmell's Fine Arts Center
has some of the best facilities
we‘ve seen," remarked Theodore
Mantz, second violinist of the
Lenox String Quartet.

“But we'd like to make one
small additionaclosets," added
Peter Marsh, first violinist. ”All

famous violinists, such as
Jascha Heitetz, became success.
ful because their mothers sllcv-
ed them in the closet to prac—
tice. Here at Grllmell it a stus
dent gave the excuse that he
didn't. have time to practice
we’d just lock him in one of the
closets," he explained.

The Lenox Quartet will
spend time at Grinncll pre—
senting a program of instruc-
tion, informal lectures and a
series of concerts including all
of Beethoven's quartets,

”Griniiell‘s program is doubly
unusual," said Donald McCall,
cellist, “because it isn't otten
that a smaller college is able to
hear the entire series of
:Beethoven quartets, especially
over a long period at time. In

Court presents

most cases they are played with-
in e period at six or seven days."

THE QUARTET chose the
Beethoven pieces because of
their consistently fine quality
and also because they will be
playing them at the Town Hall
in New York City, ln trying for
as much variation within indi-
vidual concerts as an all Beetho-
ven program would allow, they
selected works from the early,
middle and late pertods‘ oi
Beethoven's musical develop
ment, considering also the key,
and texture of the music.

The 0 iginal quartet, drawn
together by their love of cham-
ber music, began playing HF
gether informally when they
were members of the Pittsburgh
Symphony 5 years ago. Tangle-
wood, a music center in Massas
chusetts ,engaged them to be
permanent quartet as consult-
ants on technical matters, Two
years ago when the original
violist was replaced by Paul
Hersh, the group took the name
Lcnox Quartet after Lenox,
Mass. where the present group
first performed together. This
summer the ensemble spent on
a tour of Europe with five

Asked how a quartet

mans ‘

ages to start and linish on tlic,

same boat and to stay together
during the piece, Donald Me-
Call responded, “It takes tech—
nical skill first of all—a mas-
tery of the instrument, and also
many years oi playing with th
same musicians so that individ
ual interpretations can be mcrgv
ed into a whole. But skillec
players cannot make a good
quartet even it they practice
together for so years ii there is
not a rapport between the mem
bers. As [or the best audiences,
the quality we most prefer it
silence” _

Perhaps the reason the
quartet came to Grinncll was
due to their introduction to
the campus. In the dead of
one of the worst winters in
Iowa's history the quartet
made its debut. The faculty
rose to the occasion with fresh
lobsters flown in ii-om Maine
and roasted outside over a
backyard borbequc.

“We have been impressed so
far with the calibre of both
faculty and students and cei»
tainly with the absence or a
stereotyped student body. it is
a great pleasure to be here,” the
quartet concluded.
