Terry is laced with an under-
standable problem. it is virtuauy
impossible 101‘ the admissions staff
to cover the whole country in any
depth. “We must visit schools and
we must have contact with high
school counselors. To augment
this program or contact With stu-
dents and high school counselors
located at distant points, it is nec«
essary to undertake a series of
hotel interview situations,"

In addition to increased alumni
wntact, Terry is also attempting
to organize a group of volunteer
faculty members to call on high
schools when they are in the area
While attending professional meet-
ings. A preliminary attempt in

this direction was made last
week when Dean bl Men 5. Eu-
gene Thompson visited English
teachers in several schools located
in the Chicago area to discuss the

establish a “student to student"
program, Such a plan would call
for volunteer Grinnell freshmen
to Visit their high school during
Christmas vacation to talk with
their former counselors and stu-
dents who were in the junior class
behind them. “A program of this
nature could have great impor-
tance tor the admissions operation
and supply a contact seriously de
sired by the high school counse-
lors."

Paul Thurston, president of the

Leggett agreed that rules may
have to be changed and that the

be “crucial" and probably have
to be reviewed.

Smiih: Bible Does Not Answer
Hard Questions by Modern Man

That the Bible doesn’t satistac-
torlly answer dialectical and ra»
tionai challenges concerning the
reality of God does not diminish
its value as a source in a religious
struggle, concluded Dr. John E.
Smith, Chairman of the Depart-
ment oi Philosophy, Yale Univer-
sity, at a lecture in Herrick Chap-
el Sunday night. in the lirst oi the
annual Gates Lectures, Smith
tackled the "Problem of God: Tile
Biblical Approach."

“The Bible is a chronology or
events through which God re-
veals himself to man; each hap-
pening is accompanied by a med-
iator who will interpret the sig-

A demonstrative rather than a
dialectical approach characteriz-
es the Bible. Any rational or apol—
ogetic argument aimed at proving
reality is absent: the book was
not intended to eliminate doubt,
but to disclose the nature at
God, “The true meaning oi the
passages becomes manifested in
its being rather than in its
claim," stated Smith emphatical-
1y.

Regardless of its simplicity of
purpose, the Biblical approach
does not answer the difficult ques
tions raised by modern man, be
cause it cannot assume l: dialeti—

explained. “Amidst these disclc»
sures may be found examples of
doubtfulness concerning the wis-
dom of God, as in this story of Job,
but skepticism never appears."

The Bible was never intended to
dispel! the doubts or a skeptic, he
continued “The questioning, prob-
ing mind introduced doubt; it
was not inherent in the writing
itselfi"

Thus, the task of Biblical writ-
ing is revealing God in an histori-
cal order by means oi concrete
events “The end of the quest is
not inlorrnation, but inspiration,"
Smith said. ”The inspiration orig»

religion and the Christian tradh

with a vague, but honest, sense
that religion has to be rooted in
reality beyond man; our impu-

human subjectivity," he observed.

But the dilemma must be overu
come. “Our attempts to preserve
a religion without a God hava
failed. Any religious belief faunas
