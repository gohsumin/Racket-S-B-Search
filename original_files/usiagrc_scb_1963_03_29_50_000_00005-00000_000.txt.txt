As a member of tlle Midwest Collegiate Athletic Cons
ference, termed the best conference set-up in the country
by John A. Pfitsch (Director of Intercollegiate Athletics),
Grinnell is in the unique position of offering high perfor-
mance on the books and the ballfield.
To achieve this end, Grinnell has been able to attract

rapidly reaching the point where we can compete favorably

What is it then about

for this class of student.
the Grinnell athletics that

makes it so successful? Pfitsch thinks the key lies in the
proper emphasis in the program. Many schools gain repu-
tations for producing perennial excellence in one sport or

another, but in the process
giate squads. Not so at Grin

neglect their other intercolle-
nell where a definite attempt

is made to promote all sports equally. Only by sending out
representative teams in all competition will we gain the

greatest benefit from our at

llletics, Pfitsch believes

Pfitsch also holds that we can attribute the overwhelm-
ing success of our intramural program to the varsity ath-
letics. Since those most interested in varsity competition
are generally also active in IM‘s, if intercollegiate athletics
were dropped, the school would probably lose ‘many of its

students with the desire and

BASEBALL

Grinnell’s varsity baseball
team has been readying itself
for the upcoming season with a
four-week session of indoor and
outdoor practices.

Coach John Pfitsch, taking
over head duties again after a
one-year absence, will have to re-
place three regulars lost through
graduation, in addition to last
years leading hitters. ,

Dale Furnish, Dick Mittel-
bushei' and Roger Miller have
departed and slugging outﬁeld-
ers Bob McIntyre and Thomas
A. Wanner are not out for the
team. Also missing is Chris
Sprung. Furnish was an all-
conference selection at second
base, Miller was catcher and
team captain, and Mittelbusher
was the team’s most valuable
player as pitcher. Wenner and
Mclntyre ranked 1-2 in hitting,
both having batting averages
well above «ha .300 mark. Sprung
was invaluable at third and on
the mound.

Pfitsch has, however, an out»
standing bunch of sophomores
to go along with an experienced
core of veterans. Captain Art
Peterson, ﬁrst baseman Jim
Ienks, outﬁelder Bruce Bell,
pitcher-outﬁelder Cal Collier and
inﬁelder-outﬁelder Jim Fl 5 h e I'
are the returning lettermen. Out-
standing among the players up
from last season’s undefeated
freshman squad are pitchers
Denny Hanssen and Barry An-
derson and inﬁelder Dick Ulrich.

The starting lineup has not
been set, but good bets are
Jenks at ﬁrst, Peterson at short,
Ulrich at third, with second base
being contested among John
McDonald, Phil King and Howie
Bunton. Joe Thompson, Upton
Ethelbah and Bill MCKlveen are
also well up in lhe race for an
inﬁeld berth.

Collier, when not pitching,
along with Bell, Fisher, Vern

Robinson and Randy Morgan,
will form the nucleus of the
outﬁeld.

Don MCWethy and Wayne
Gano will handle the catching
duties. Hanssen, Anderson and
Collier form an outstanding, al-
though shallow, pitching staff.

Other players include Mel
Chilewich, Masakatso Kate and
Bob Glass.

TENNIS

By J. Eric Jacobson
s a n Staﬁ Writer

WiLh an eye toward improv-
ing last years 5-5 record, 11
varsity tennis players have been
working out under coach Edd
Bowers. ,

”A better team in a better
league” is Bowers’ evaluation
of Grinnell’s position this year.
Ripon, Carleton and Lawrence
are expected to be the Pioneers’
toughest opponems with Knox
a league dark horse.

Even zhough only two regulars
are returning, Grinnell appears
to be improved from last year.
lThe two returnees are Bob
Eramson and Jim Smith who
played number one singles last
season.

An addition who will bolster
the squad is Guy Ashton. As a
sophmore, Ashton won the con-
ference number one singles
tournament and was on the win-
‘ning number one doubles team.
die is now back as a senior
after spending last year in Puer-
to Rico.

Bowers plans to play Ashton
and Smith in the one and two
positions. Bramson, Ken Clymer,
Bob Hewes, Larry Shannon and
John Schwartz will be ﬁghting
it out for the lower three spots.
Doubles teams have not been
composed as yet.

Other team members are Jim
Adelman, Chlp Clark, Ed Hill
and Dick Metzlei‘,

Tracksters Second at SCI

By Peter Kollmau
5&3 Staff Writer

On Friday night the Pioneer
cinderman face State College of

Iowa in a dual meet about
which Coach Dick Young said,
“This is the first time I have
felt that, with loo per cent per—
formance and a few breaks, we
could beat sol."

Last Saturday in s. nine team
meet, the Pioneers finished sec-
ond to SCT, scoring 54 points.
while the Panthers collected 80.
This is not exactly indicative of
the respective team strengths,
however, since the team balance
of the Pioneers is a greater fac-
tor in a dual meet.

At SCI, the Pioneers were
first in the sprint medley,
with the relay team composed
of Fred Berg, Tom DeBei-g,
John Edgren and Jeri Lang-
ham. The 24.1ap relay team,
consisting of Paul Patterson,

 

Pete Kmnz, Bruce Beckord
and Jeri Langham, and the

War/(outs

started working Outdoor
week.

GOLF

With Coach Larry Crawford's
return to Grinnell after com-
petlng in several tournaments
on the pro tour, official golf
practice will begin soon.

The unseasonably warm weal»
ther has given the team a
chance to get away from the
practice tee in the gym to the
country club course.

Several good sophomores make
the outlook for the team bright.
These include Dave Sellergren,
Pete Klein, Rick Miller, Mike
Miller, and Dick Orr, the top
five from last year's undefeated
frosh squad.

Only two returning lettermen,
Russ Hardin and Rick Fuller,
are back lo fonn this year’s nu-
cleus. other upperclassmenback.
ing them up are Gary Fisher,
Dave Eaetz, George Forrest,
Paul Nelson, and Jerry Cozad.

The linksmen will have to gel.
ready quickly for their first
meet April against iowa

the gym early in March and
this

12.1cp team, made up of Lang-
hm, Edgren, Beckord, and
Berg both finished second.

Outstanding in the individual
evenls were Kent Rogerson, who
was second in the high jump and
matched the wlnnlng leap but
lost out on the number of
misses and Gene Kowert, who
finished fourth in the shot put
with a throw which exceeded
his previous best by two feet;
and Bob Hal-rill, who finished
third in the broad jump.

While the varsity was com-

] excellent

paling at sex, the freshman
lock part in the AAU meet in
Des Moines. Coach Young com.
mended four freshman for their
performances. Jim
Miller, who finished second in
the shot, threw it 48’ 61/2",
which is better than the Grin-
nell varsity record and only 3"
short of the conference varsity
record.

The only other freshman to
place was John Tepaske, whose
52.3 time for the quarler was
good for fourth place.
