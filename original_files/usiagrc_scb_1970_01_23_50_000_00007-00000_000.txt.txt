lections” will open Tuesday (Jan.
20] in the Scheaffer Gallery in

vocative exhibition.”

Appel, Brian Rice. Ronald King,

Chaplin Film
This Weekend

Charlie Chaplin. says James
Agee, “was the first man to give
thesilentlanguageasoul . . . Of
all comedians he worked most
deeply and most shrewdly within
a realization of what a human
being is, and is up against, The
Tramp is as centrally repre-
sentative of humanity, as many-
sided and mysterious, as Hamlet,
and it seems unlikely that any
dancer or actor can ever have
excelled him in eloquence.
variety. or poignancy of motion."
Saturday and Sunday at 8:00
RM. in ARH Charlie can be seen
in TILLIE’S PUNCTURED RO-
MANCE. This film, released in
1914 and the first Six reel comedy
ever made, marks the emergence
of Charlie Chaplin as a star.
Mark Sennet intended the movie
to be a vehicle for Marie Dress-
ler. but it is Charlie whom thc
people watch. Another critic says
of Charlie's role in this film: “It
shows how . . . Charlie developed
tlle figure of humor and pathos
with the baggy trousers and cane
now so familiar to us.” Also
appearing with Charlie, besides
the Keystone Kops. are Mabel
Normand, Mack Swain, Edgar
Kennedy, Charlie Chance, Ches-
ter Conklin, and Hank Mann.

Showing Friday at 9:45 and
Saturday at 10:00 will be HALLE-
LUJAH THE HILLS, directed by
Adolfus Mekas (editor of GOLDV
STEIN) and released in 1564. It
is an “experimental" lilm, says
the distributor, about a love

President's SLuiement

We have engaged James L.
Rogers, an experienced and
respected labor relations lawyer
of Des Moines to represent the
College in our negotiations with
the union which the plant em-
ployes chose to represent
them, _

These negotiations are of real
importance not only to the em-
ployees directly involved and to
the union and the college ad
ministration but also to the entire
college community. Their
significance may extend many
years beyond 1970.

(1) because the Teamsters
with whom the college
must negotiate are long
experienced at this
business, and

because the college ad-
ministration is Without
any experience at all in
such matters, and

because we believe that
whatever is done here
ought to be done right,

we have asked Mr. Rogers to
represent the College.

Mr. Rogers has accepted the
responsibility of representing the
College. His instructions are to
do his very best to negotiate a
collective bargaining agreement
which is fair and responsible to
the employees directly involved
and to the entire college com-
munity and its future.

The job of the negotiators is
tough enough wimout being
complicated by the statements of
comments of others. In view of
this and in the interests of
promoting the effectiveness of
the negotiations, we do not intend
to say or do anything outside of
the negotiations which might in
any way have any impact on the
negotiations which might in any
way have any impact on the
negotiations or on the abilities of
the negotiators on both sides to
do their job of reaching a tair,
effective, and responsible
agreement.
