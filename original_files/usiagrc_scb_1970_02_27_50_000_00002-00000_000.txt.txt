1 Nebraska Conservation Professor
Gives Lectures Here on Ecology

Dr. James Drew of the
University of Nebraska spoke on
ecology here Wednesday. He
gave two lectures, one to over
200 students including the Science
1 class, and held a question and
answer session.

The first lecture, “Ecological
Implications of the Alaskan Oil
Development," never got deeply
into the subject before the period
ended. Drew has spent some time
in the Arctic slope region of
northern Alaska where oil has
recently been discovered.
Problems caused by permafrost
and earth slippages which
prevent die construction of roads
and pipelines were discussed at
length.

”infrared Sensing of Soil and
Range Conditions" was the topic
of Drew’s second lecture, which
was attended mostly by faculty
members. This concerned a
study he did in the sandhiils of
Nebraska, an undeveloped region
used fuzing. Remote sensing
techniques (aerial infrared
photography,) were used to map

pointed out that although these
men produced much during the
Twenties, the seeds of their
creativity had‘ been planted
earlier, Lowered restrictions
under the Weimar regime
allowed much profitable ex-
perimentation in the arts.

Koliman does not accept the
comparison of Germany of 1930
to America of 1970. There are
important differences: Vietnam
is a limited war, and Americans
were divided at its beginning;
America is basically a none
military society.

The second event in the
Symposium was a lecture—
discussion by Professor Henry
Klein of the Grinnell Art faculty
about Seigfried Kracauer’s book
From Caligari to Hitler. Despite

the soil types of this area, Certain
plant types grow only in certain
soils, These differences show up
through varied coloration an
infrared film. Boundaries thus
are clear unless man has altered
the vegetation patterns. This
technique, though expensive, can
be used to detect plant diseases,
such as Dutch Elm, long before
they show up normally. When
detected early enough, measures
can be taken to prevent spread
of the disease.

When asked about pollution,
Dr. Drew said that he is in
terested with the “basic aspects
of pollution rather than
developing specific technical
solutions to the problem. I mink
that we need to look at the basic
things first than to develop
technical solutions.”

Dr. Drew received his doc-
torate from Rutgers University.
He is currently teaching con-
servation courses at the
University of Nebraska, where he
is also advisor to the con-
servation majors,

political forces in Germany
which might have prevented the
rise of Fascism, like the left wing
and the intellectuals, Hitler did
eventually become Chancellor.

Kracauer’s book is one attemp
to explain why. In German films
of the period one can see certain
themes and motifs, which;
judging by their box office suc-
cess, were geared toward a set
of appetites in the German
people. By analyzing those films
which were popular and those
which were not, Kracauer ex—
posed some traits of the Germans
which made Hitler’s rise
possible.

The most striking charac-
teristic of the German cinema
was me way in which the
material was edited. The human
content of the shots was often
displaced by a visual motif, like
movement or texture, which gave
a rather detached View of human

Nationwide Teach-In Begins Next Month
To Discuss The Problems of Pollution

Plans are now well underway
for a nationwide Teachrln next
spring, April 22, on his grave
crisis facing the quality of the
environment and the quality of
life in America today.

A national headquarters and
staff to organize, coordinate and
service this effort are now
established in Washington. The
address is Room 500, 2100 “M”
Street, N. w., Washington, D. c.
20037.

The aim of the National Teach-
In is to encourage students across
the country to take the initiative
in organizing April 22 environ-
mental teach-ins on their cam-
puses and associated efforts in
their communities.

Successful teach~ins on all
campuses on the same day will
have a dramatic impact on the
environmental conscience of the
nation. They will be immensely
effective as an educational effort
in arousing public opinion con—
cerning necessary steps to
protect our environment and
establish quality on a par with

life. Klein pointed out that
similar material could have been
edited in a way that emphasized
the underlying humanity. The

, popular German films — Klein

cited “Berlin, Symphony of a
City” as an example — treated
people as formal objects, so
although shots of real people in
real situations were often used
in place of scenes staged by
actors, the films avoided a
confrontation with humanity. The
emphasis was on decorative
patterns, not individuality. In the
wartime films “real Soldiers and
tanks fighting at the front
somehow became cardboard
because of the way the pictures
wereedited,"saidl(lein.

American and British wartime
films seemed to be most in-
terested in identifying a real
person and confronting his in-

quantity as a goal of American
life.

There is no question that in the
long run, the environmental
challenge is me greatest faced
by mankind. Distinguished
scientific authorities have'bcen
warning for years that mankind
is rapidly destroying the very
habitat on which he depends for
his survival. In addition,
population continues to increase
worldwide, while scientists warn
that we may have already passed
sustainable population levels. All
across the country and worldwide
increasing numbers of citizens
are voicing the same intense
concern as has been so eloquently
expressed by ecologists and other
environmentalists.

Yet many are still not aware
of the environmental problems
being created by our advancing
technologyr Federally financed
projects, such as the supersonic
transport plane, raise grave
questions about possible new
environmental dangers. Many
respected scientists and national
leaders have indicated that
although some positive steps
have been taken, toxic and
persistent pesticides are still
accumulating in the world en-
vironment, wreaking destruction
,on fish and wildlife and
threatening man himself. Is the
price we pay for these products
in terms of their effect upon our
environment worth the benefits
we obtain from them?

The pollution of our rivers and
lakes and of the air in our urban
areas Continues to accelerate.
Suburban sprawl continues to
destroy vast scenic and
recreational resources, Withlittle
heed being given to plans to
create workable environments.
The millions trapped in our urban
and rural ghettos continue to

suffer the worst of the massive.

air, water, land and noise
pollution.

Who will finally bear the brunt
of this tragic irresponsibility?
The generation now in school, the
generation which will soon
inherit the world environment.
The time has come for all citizens
to begin drinking about the basic
questions raised by technological
advances and environmental
degradation,

Students in America and the
world, deeply concerned with the
hard choices which their
generation faces, are uniquely
well suited to taking initiatives
in exploring with all citizens the
problems created by man’s

growing impact upon his en-

Vironment.

The National Teach-In next
April 22 provides students with
the opportunity to accomplish
this objective. Hundreds of [each

ins on that day would bring'

together for the first time on a
national scale the many young
people who are already con-
cerned about the environment
and would involve and educate
many more as well.

In addition to bringing this
widespread involvement. the
teachrins would present in-
formation, draw the issues,
stimulate plans for action, and

demonstrate the strength of
concern for a livable world.

Furthermore, the en
vironmental teachrins present an
unprecedented opportunity for
the involvement by student
initiative of communities,
organizations, leaders and
Concerned citizens of all
generations in a common non-
partisan effort to meet a problem
of far»reaching con-
sequence. Thus, it is urged that
all campuses in America par-
ticipate in a broadly based teach-
in effort involving all individuals
and groups who share this con»
cern.

Already the student response
to this idea has been one of
overwhelming support, and a
number of campuses are now
well into the process of planning
an April 22nd teach»in.

At the University of Michigan
:1 mass meeting was called
recently by an ad hoc student
committee to plan a teach-in.
More than 350 people attended
and the plan is now Well un—
derway. University officials and
faculty were also contacted for

.their support and advice, a step

which is important for a suc-
cessful teach-in,

One of the projects now being
planned preparatory to the
University of Michigan event is
a comprehensive inventory of
environmental problems in that
community and region.

Similar inventories around the
country would be educational and
practical and would provide the
teach-in with specific examples
of local environmental problems
needing immediate attention.

if young people put their
energy. imagination and
idealism to work on this issue,
they will help write a bright new
chapter in the struggle for a
livableworld.

UNICEF Makes Appeal
For Nigerian Relief

The U.S. Committee for
UNICEF has issued a nationwide
appeal for public contributions to
support a massive rehabilitation
program in postwar Nigeria.
Noting that the Nigerian
government has expressed its
appreciation of UNICEF’s “good
and altruistic humanitarian
work" over the past two years
of the tragic Civil War, Mrs.
Guido Pantaleoni, .lr.,' President
of the US. Committee, said: “We
are heartened by the continuing
concern expressed by the
American people over the plight
of the Nigerian mothers and
children who have survived a
period of great suffering and
hardship. Now we must do our
part in helping to raise the
millions of dollars needed to
maintain and expand UNICEF’s
aid program in eastern Nigeria
durillg the critical months
ahead.”
