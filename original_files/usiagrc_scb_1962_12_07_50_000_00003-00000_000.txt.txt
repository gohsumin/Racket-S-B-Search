Mcal, we would like to express
our appreciation to the student

body and faculty for their en?

tliusiastic response to this sein-

As many of you know, an all

this unexpectcd participation in
the program. Saga has asked
us to extend their thanks

with the short supply or iood
and thc long line. At next sem-

you, an abundance of good food
will bc on hand.

We would also like to thank
those of the taculty who could
not attend the meal, but who
sent us contributions for the
Special income Fund which pros
vides personal expenses for
foreign students.

We hope that next semester
SharerA-Meal will be
suecessiul.

‘R. Bowen, disarmament weuli
present no drastic eeonomc
lproblems. He expressed thzs

Pcacc Group Tuesday night.
Speaking on the ”Economics

[of Disarmament," Bowen refer.

‘red to the periods of rapid and

drastic sai’mamelit follow

lboth word wars as examplrs

that disarmament could tare
place without causing an ecc—
nomrc breakdown.

Bowen, \tho holds a doctor's
rdegree in economics, pointed -o
Hhe 1920's and late 1940's as pr:
ds of prosperity which rolloi- .
cd lai-g scale disarmament.

IN 1945 we spent 44 per cent
rof our national income on no-
‘ ional security, while by lséz
:the percentage spent tor security
idropped to live. At the present
time, Bowen said, we are spent!»
mg approximately 11 per cent
for national secur _

Bowen said that n order s
ll‘educe military spending v.
lwould have to increase our pul:
lic expenditures in the ﬁelds or
isocial services such as education,
thighways, housing, national rs~
sources and foreign aid.

Spending in this area. Bowen
,said. could easilv be doubled in
a two or this ear period, A
he present time we are spentL
ing about equal amounts for na—
tional security and social seru-
ices.

Bowen rejected the idea lhzi

l Two obstacles in the,path to—
