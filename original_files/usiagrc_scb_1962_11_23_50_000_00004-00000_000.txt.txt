nell swimming team is prepar—
ing to face its ﬁrst opponents,
Monmouth and Cornell, at home
next Saturday.

In explaining the situation,
Coach Irv Silnone said, “We
won’t have a swimming team
this year. We’ll have a club.
We'll call it the Barracuda
Club and only the toughest
can get in the club. six men
have earned membership and
we’ll get another at the semes-
ter. We’re going to have fun

in this club."

The swimmers are Jim Adel-
man, Jim Cross, Palmer Hart],
Zal Lefliowitz, Ralph Pray and

Jim Sable, Howard Schein will

Cagers preparing for opener

The Grinnell basketball team
will open the 1962-63 campaign
next Friday when they journey
to St. Olaf.

Missing from last year’s cham—
pionship aggregation are stand-
outs Bob Musser, George Gray,
Bill Parsons, and co-Captain Ray
Horton. But Coach John Piitsch

boasts a ﬁne group of sopho..

mores in addition to ﬁve return-
ing lettermen. Good height, ex-
cellent shooting and. rebounding,

Brown named

captain, MVP

Grinnell’s ﬁne sophomore dis-
tance runner, Rod Brown, swept

all postseason honors when he,

was voted the most valuable run-
not and captain tor next year
by his teammates.

A durable little plugger, he
paced Coach Dick Young’s Pia
oneers all season, finishing sec-
ond in the Midwest Conference
meet and failing to win a dual
run only once. That time he
was second to a teammate.

His 15:20 in the threeemile
conference go was the best evA
er recorded by a Grinnelljran in
this meet, by some 14 seconds.
He also holds course records at
Carleton and Grinnell.

and fair speed characterize the‘
new version of the Pioneers.

THE VETERANS mentioned
include seniors Gar Smith, Den-
nis Asby and Kent hogerson.
Smith. a 540 senior, has been a
regular for two years and is
the playmaker of the club. Asby
and Rogerson, at 6-3 and 64, are
strong rebounder and accurate
shots. Juniors John Sundell, at
6~7 the tallest man on the team,
and Jim Midlin, 6-3, will pro-
vide much of the scoring punch,
as they did last year.

Other upperclassmen include
seniors Jack Grinin, 6‘1, and
Bob Shepherd, so, and junior
Tony Schroer, 6-2. Eight sopho-
mores round out the squad,
These include Barry Anderson,
6-0, Don McWethy, 5.9, Tom
Buchholtz, 6-1, Clyde Smith, 6-3,
Larry Neal, 673, Randy Morgan,
5‘11, Dick Ulrich, sea, and Dave
Sellergren, 5.10.

Coach Pfitsch admits to be-
ing “very happy with the
whole team" at this stage or
practice. Scrimmages have
been spirited and competition
intense, as everyone has shown
well.

Among the sophomores Pfitsch
lpoints to Buchholtz and Seller—
gran as being the outstanding
candidates for the guard spots
vacated by the graduation of
Parsons and Gray. Clyde Smith
has shown promise in the fore-
court,

 

6:00—12:00

 

Pfitsch expects to, emphasize
versatility again this year, con-
tinuing the plan which brought
the l961-62 team an 13-4 rec-
0rd. Miﬁlin and Asby are capa—
ble of playing nearly anywhere
in the patented Grinnell offense,
and Rogerson and Sundell pro-
vide ample height tor the post
positions.

Piitsch is very enthusiastic
about Miiilin, who is expected
to lead a well—balanced scoring
attack. Each of the ﬁve return—
ing lettermen had averages of
around lo points per game last
year.

The coach points to a genere
al improvement in the confer
ence teams as a major obstacle
to a. second consecutive cham-
pionship, but concedes that
the Pioneers have the potential
and must be ﬁgured as CD-
fnvorites in the running.

 

 

 

 

All,

By Jim Hermg
58:13 Sports Co-editor

The Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference has put
Life, Look, Sport and the rest of the Official AlleAmez’i-
can football team pickers to shame. Where each of these
magazines might pick a first and second team (22 play-
ers), the MCAC has for its All-Conference selections 61105"
en a first—team offense, 3 first-team defense, a second-
"team offense, a second~team defense and 58 honorable
melltions7102 players in all.

Thus the MCAC has chosen 102 players as the
best in it conference comprised of ten teams which
can only have 110 playels on the field on any time
during the five Saturday afternoon games.

The crystal-ball gazers named three Pioneers to the
starting offensive and three to the top defensive team,
giving Grinnell 27 per cent of the starting teams. They
gave Grinnell 18.2 per cent of the second teams and 17.7
per cent of the first teams, second teams and the honorable
mentions combined. This means 18 out of the 102 named
were from Grinnell.

A mistake has been made. The MCAC is naming every
good player in the Conference (and perhaps a few favon‘te
sons who aren’t even good) instead of naming the best
players. In 2t league of ten teams it’s deep within the realm
of the absurd to name 102 players.

0n the mythical team Denny Asby was named to a
stalting defensive tackle although he played little at that
position during the season. Sophomore Dennis Homer-in
played the defensive tackle spot for the Pioneers during
much of the season.

Beloit, one of the most impotent offensive teams in the
Conference, picked up one starter on the offensive team
iJohn Gomez, a burly tackle. And two Beloit backs, a.
guard, and a tackle received honorable mention as offen»
Sive players. How can stars be chosen from a team which
went nowhere?

Grinnell Sports a sixeman swimming team this year.
This virtually eliminates the team from any chance of
winning dual meets. Half of this year’s varsity consists of
lettelmen, all fine swimmers. The other half is untried on
the varsity level.

The Tact that the once outstanding Grinnell swimming
team is reduced to at six-man squad is Sad. Last year Grin-
nell possibly had its strongest team ever but: lost in the
Conference meet to an even stronger Carleton contingent.
Moreover, Irv Simone, the Grinnell coach, has produced
nine Conference champions in the last 11 years.

Then this year several outstanding swimmers
failed to come out for the sport they excel in. The
backstlloker who finished second in the Conference
last year and first the year before has quit. The finest
all-event swimmer on the team last year has quit. The
swimmer who was named the most improved for two
straight years has quit. The Conference champion div-
er has transferred. A transfer student who dove for
the freshmen last year has quit. Others have quit.

Last year Grinnell slm'mming publicity was filled with
information about three sophomores who were advertised
asefilrinllell's hope for the future. Two of them have re-
tir .

Why do these swimmers no longer wish to compete
on the intercollegiate level? Some say they’re tired of
,swimming. Some say they don't get along with the coach.
‘Some say their grade point suffers when they swim. Some
don’t wish to follow a rigid training schedule; they must
if they wish to swim for Simone.

Are these reasons valid? Do they have to be? I have
no pat answer. No student is under any compulsion to par»
ticipate in anything at Gl‘innell. I am not aiming an ang-ly
blast at the swimmers or the coach. I’m only pointing out
the situation which exists today.
