in Congress, and his reputation
In domestic and lorelgn affairs.
“1 just don’t think Nixon has
a strung enough personality to
deal with the problems of the
tlmes. He's iantastically wishy~
washy," commented a male
{union “Nixon will be a face-
ess president, and maybe it’ll
be best if he is," said another
boy. "I don’t think he'll have
the support or Congress, espe-
cially because the congressmen
won't ieel that the people are
backing them." observed a male
sophomore.

At least one black student
feels that Nixon will “push for
repressive legislation, stack the
Court more conservatively. and
probabty get rid or Attorney
General Ramsey Clark." Ac-
cording to others, welfare pro-
grams will also he cut back or
eliminated. “Nixon will get rid
of every decent program that’s
existed over the past iii years.
But ioreign policy is where
Nixon scares me the most, be-
cause he is not known for his
prudence or open~mindedness."

concluded A senior Political
Science major.

Young Republicans President
Jon Royal, '70, was pessimistic
about the chances of growth in
the liberal Republican move
ment because of a dearth of
young talent and the victory of
Nixon. It the liberal movement
can become more of a political
force, however, the power strua<
lure will now be available: “The
struggle may be harder but the
victory sweeter—it's that kind
of thing."

A proNixon Political Science
major believes that “it is a good
thing tor the country that Nixon
has been elected. He has the
capability tn unity the country
and bring back the Wallace peo‘
ple into the told of American
politics without calling out to
them. And even though Con
gress will be against him,
Nixon can get us out or Vlel—
nam and Start on new innova-
tive weliare programs tor the
poor and down-andout for a
change."

Royal, however, suggested
that “one at the mayor goals
of the country should be to see
that Nixon doesn't get assassh
Hated."

escort. There were. however,
no incidents during the three
mile march through the out<
skirts of Des Maine: to the
west steps of the state capitol.

The students marched ten
abreast, carrying banners de<
nouncing the election as a
hoax. They chanted anti-war,
anti-government slogans, such
as ”Vote no for president" and
“peace can’t kill you." The
march attracted attention from
passers by. but almost no
hecklers appeared during the
march or at the rally.

The rally on the steps or the
state capitol stressed several
or the complaints voiced hy the
slogans and signs of the march-
ers. The first speaker was Fred
Stover, a longtime organizer
Dl' an Iowa farm association.

He spoke out in favor of with-
drawol from Vietnam “unilat-
erally — like we got in" He
did not {eel that the election
of any of the candidates would
bring about change in Amer-
lca, responsive to the citizens.

Other speakers addressed
the rally, stressing that the
time for student alienation from
workers and soldiers was past
and that etim‘ts must be made
by students to contact these
groupp. The rally ended peace-
fully around 4:30 as marchers
dispersed
