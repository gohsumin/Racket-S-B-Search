Animal Lilo

Changes Proposed In [M B'Imll

By Jim Ramsey a
Nick Nonas

Since our last column, we
have come under considerable
criticism for not confining our
remarks to the IM program.
Our reasons for straying from
what the sole subject matter
of Animal Life has been in the
past are twofold. First, the pur-
pose of any column should
be to point out issues of inter-
est to the readers. Let's face it.
A drab weekly, playsby-piay
description of the basketball
games are less than thought
provoking and even less enter-
taining. Mayor issues which con-
cern all of us involved in the
program do not arise that often.
Secondly, it is our observation
that Animal Life, even in its
more serious and critical tones,
has had little, if any, effect on
City Hall—on those people in a
responsible position who can
act on a recommendation! How-
ever, we feel compelled this
week to devote all our energies
to a problem which must be
alleviated ii the 1M basketball
program is not to evolve into
one of the most hilarious de-
bacles of the year, In hopes
that our pleas for help will not
fall on deaf ears, but will
reach someone who will listen
and ACT, We address this let-
ter directly to City Hall.

Dear Mr. Pfitsch:

How long has it been since
you have taken a critical look
at, or made a serious evalua-
tion‘of the 1M basketball pro-
gram, and, in particular, the
officiating. If you could restrain
your laughter long enough to
consider the absurdity and in-
consistency of so many of the
calls, as ludicrous as they
might be, you might realize
that beneath the veil of amuse—
mom, a very serious problem
exists. It’s not quite so funny
when you’re laying on your
back, looking up at the foot
standing on your face, and hear
the referee call a jumpball.
Instances of this sort are too
many to enumerate. The prob-
lem is quite obvious to us who
bear bruises and injustices of
the game, and it is apparent
that the issue has not been
called to your attention. We
are sure that if you witnessed
some of these farces, your em-
pirical observations w o u l d
place you in hearty agreement
with us.

Before making any serious
recommendations, let it be said
that the crux of the problem
lies, not with the referees, but
in the very nature of the bris-
iietball program itself, In spite
of the incessant criticism which
any reieree is apt to receive, a

great deal of credit must go
to those men who “stick their
necks on the block” merely be-
cause their hall needs to pro-
vide a referee or sacrifice en-
try points. Unfortunately, as
the program is designed, a
horse could be given a Whistle,
if he represented a hall, and,
in some cases, it might be an
improvement

This cursory sketch of the
problem is all too brief, but let
it suffice to make our point, On
this, we urge most strongly
that the following persausions
be implemented, or at least lay
the groundwork for a revision
of the 1M basketball program.

First, as the situation pres-
ently exists, any 1M player (in
fact, it need not be a player or
even an enthusiast) can referee
a game, irrespective of the fact
that he might be unable to dis-
tinguish a basketball from a
pineapple or a foul from a bas-
ket, which would seem to be
the case in some instances. We
realize that the concept of an
officiating clinic has been tossed
around for some time. We also
realize that not one thing has
been done towards implement
ing it into the program, and
that it still remains an idle
dream, To our way of thinking,
the clinic should be more than
available—it should be compul-
sory for any referee who uffic<
iates an IM game. This is the
only way to procure the con—
sistent and capable officiating
which is now so sorely lacking,

Secondly, the monetary com-

pensation, which is now $.50 a,

game, might be distributed on

an alternative basis. There are,,
we feel, enough players with'

an interest and background in
IM basketball to participate in
a referee’s pool, At the begin-
ning of each season, these ill-
terested persons would be en-
listed info a group, of say 15
men, who would each officiate
three or four games a week on
a rotating schedule, The total
wages available for referee’s
compensation would be divided
among these personnel. They
would, in turn, be trained at
the clinic, consisting of at least
four one-hour sessions.
Certainly these recommenda—

tions are not the only to which'

you have recourse. But we of-
fer them as the most cogent
solutions which we can present.
Perhaps these particular sug-
gestions represent the views of
a minority of north campus, but
we feel that we are almost
unanimously accompanied in
our supplications for a drastic
revision 01' the officiating pro-
gram. It is about time that a
serious interest was taken in

 

the 90% of north campus that
does not participate in winter
varsity athletics, and are not
gifted enough physically to play
varsity basketball, If you have
neither the interest nor the
time, we beg of you, for the
sake of the TM program and all
of us involved, now and in the
future, to turn the program
over to some member of the
department who is sincerely
concerned and m oti v ate d
enough to do something about
it.

Sincerely yours,

ANIMAL LIFE

Swimmers Prepare
For Midwest Meet

Grinnell, edged out 5045 by Cor-
nell in the battle for “Dilly the
Duck,, last Saturday, will be look-
ing for revenge when the two clubs
collide again this weekend in the
Midwest Conference meet at
Northfield, Minn.

Carleton Will host the Friday-
Saturday meet in its new zayard.
six lane pool.

"We hope to get even this week‘
end at Carleton," said Coach Irv
Simone, who is counting on the
Cornell loss to provide his Pio-
neei's with an extra incentive. The
loss was the first of the year for
the mermen after eight wins. Core
hell is unbeaten.

Should Grinnell and Cornell slip,
Beloit could carry off top honors.
Bill Putnam is unbeaten in the
zoo. and 500-yard freestyle and
Ted Sheldon is a possible Champ-
ion in the 50 and 100. They are
also mainstays on the Bucs' allr
victorious freestyle loursoine.

Wrestling Team Goes

To Conference Meet

Grinnell IS expected to battle
Monmouth for second place in the
Midwest Conference wrestling
meet to be held today and to»
morrow at Monmouth, ill.

Cornell is a heavy favorite to
Claim its 22nd title in 24 years.

Dimming Grinnell's hopes is the
uncertain status of Captain Larry
Miller, two-time champion at 167
pounds.

Miller’s injury leaves l23-pound»
er Bill Barnes and 1307pounder
Ken Slnlbler as Gl'innell’s top
threats for individual titles.

Heavyweight Morgan Michel
Could also challenge for an indi-
vidual crown.

Other Pioneer entries will be
Cliff DDWlIrtg, 137; Mike Heather-
agc. 147; Gary Wilson. 157 or 167
Marty Ringo, 177; and Bob Geller.
