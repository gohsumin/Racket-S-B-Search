Avison Addresses Senaie.
Ouilines Expansion Program

Mr. James Avlson. head of
the Development Oltice, spoke
to the senate Wednesday night
about the college's ten year,
$25 million expansion program.
Oi the $12 million to he raised
In the next live years. he said
$5.8 million is earmarked lor
academic use. such as expan-
sion of the library and higher
faculty salaries. The rest will
he used for capital expansion,
such as the proposed 32 million
P. E. complex.

"The money tor P. E." Avison
emphasized, ”is not being taken
away irom other needs like
classroom buildings. 1 see no
reason that there will he a
change in emphasis at Grin-
mail because of the new P. E.
complex."

To raise the money, Avison
said, the alumni will have to
be reorganized, and the college
will have to relate to the alum-
ni in different ways. He said
a new and more “intellectu-
ally” oriented alumni magazine
will be published. He also men
tioned plans tor a three day con—
vocation next fall during home-
coming which will bring to
Grinnell speakers or national
reputation. Martin Luther King
and Clark Kerr have been in-
vited.

Speaking on the “oonrmunr
cation gap” between the stu-
dents and administration, Avi-
son said any such gap “is cer-
tainly not intended.” “We want
10 relate to you,” he said. “but
most or us—the Burling gang
—do not know how to do it.”

Avison said student demon-
strations have “little eiiect” an
ioundatiun grants but that they
“hurt" lund»raising among oldv
er alumni. “They don’t under-
stand (demonstrations)," Avi-
son said, speaking or older
alumni, "but they have to learn
to live with it.”

Reierring to the criticism of
the P. E. complex, he said, “I
have to learn to live with the
5&3.“

in Executive Cabinet reports,
Karen Lauterbach introduced an
AWS Board recommendation
“that the senate establish a
committee to investigate the
possibility of the college estab-
lishing a contractual agreement
with incoming students regard-
ing tuition and-or tuition in-
creases. We would like to raise
some questions.” The senate
established the committee.

Miss Lauterbach also said
AWS Board meetings are open
ior those interested. The board

Steve Kent said President
Leggett should announce a de-
cision regarding the hours pro-
posal sometime before or im-
mediately alter spring vacation.
Kent also expressed the hope
that other members oi the ad-
ministration and faculty, par-
ticularly Mr. l-laveman, chair-
man or the education policy
committee, would “be ready
soon" to speak to the senate
on campus issues.

Comment on Kirkpatrick

By Jeri Dunn

Having dedicated his liie to
dispelling the notion that the
harpsichord is an Interior pre-
decessor to the piano, Mr. Ralph
Kirkpatrick communicated his
own kind of fervor in his per-
iormance Saturday In Roberts.
Judging from the reaction to
his performance. as well as the
overflow attendance, he suc-
ceeded rather well In his goal.
Kirkpatrick demonstrated that
the harpsichord has been an in-
strument oi nuance by including
in his program a wide range
or early composers and styles
ranging from the technical dit-
iiculties oi Handel and Rameau
to the satire of Couperin and
the sobriety or Back.

The Couperin 0nzienne more
was oi particular Interest. As
Kirkpatrick explained belore
hand, Couperin wrote a series
of musical jibes at former
mistresses and, lucongruously,
the power-hungry Muslclans'
Guild. The latter organization
was routed at the end at the
the Gram by "drunkards, mon-
keys, and bears.”

Kirkpatrick won many new
adherents by substituting Bach’s
ltalian Concerto (for “acousti-
cal" reasons) in place at Scar-
latti. it was disappointing that
the composer best interpreted
by Kirkpatrick had to be shown
the door, for Scarlatti was 81-
must twentieth century in his
disregard of the musical status

quo. The only glimpse Grin-
nell got oi him was a single err
core.

Kirkpatrick’s technical virtu-
osity followed a classical slyll
oilingering.

It is almost impossible to
criticize Kirkpatrick‘o musical
interpretation. After receiving
his BA. at Harvard, he iraver
ed to Paris on a grant from
his alma mater to study tech-
nique under Landowska and
theory under Boulanger (whose
many iamous pupils included
Gershwin and Copland). Kirk-
patrick’s painstaking research
on trills (ﬁnanced by a Gug-
genheim Fellowship) and his
book on Scarlatti are considered
deiinitive.
