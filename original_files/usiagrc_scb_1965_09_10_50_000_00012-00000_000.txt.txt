Gridmen Face Rebuilding As Season Opener Approaches

With only 11 lettermen ro-
turning, a big rebuilding job laces
Coach Edd Bowers in his sixth
Season as Grinnell College football
coach.

The lid—man Pioneer squad began
practice Sept. 1. On Sept. 25, the
Scarlet and Black will open a
rugged sgame Midwest Confer-
ouce schedule by hosting Cornell,
t 1564 tri-champion. And the sec—
ond outing, to week later, is at
Ripon, another tri-charnp.

Graduation dealt the Pioneers a
staggering blow. Gone from last
year‘s team, which had a 53 mark
and tied for fourth in the loop
are 15 lettermen. all but one of
them regulars on either offense or
deiense.

Especially hard hit was the in-
terior line. Eight tackles, guards,
and centers departed, and only
three veterans are back Also
missing are four backs and a trio
oi ends.

Rely on Staph:

“Our sophomores are going to
have to come through, especially
in the interior line,” Bowers points
out. “We should be strong in the
backfield and at end, but so much
is going to depend on how fast our
Bophornore linemen develop. And
we really start the season with
a bang, meeting Cornell and Ri-
pon. But it we can get by them
in good shape, we could pull some
Surprises.”

Happily, the sophomore contin-
gent is rated as Grinnell's best in
five years.

'Announcers Needed

Two student announcers are
needed for the fall sports season.
Anyone interested should contact
Roger McMullin in the public re-
lations ofﬁce,

 

The only vets in the interior
line are co—capwin Paul Thurston,
a senior who earned all-conference
recognition as a linebacker last
year though weighing only 165
pounds; Tom Lannom, a 195 pound
senior who will be at center on
offense and at linebacker on de-
tense; and Rick Anderson, a 195
pound junlor who will go at offen-
sive tackle or guard. Thurston will
probably shift to the defensive
backfield this (all.

Top sophomore prospect up
front is Tom Russell, a 195 pound
Er who will double as an often-
sive guard and linebacker. He has
the credentials to become one of
Grinneil’s allvtlme great linemen.

Still Other Sophs

Other sophs tabbed for heavy
duty in the line are Ken Augus-
tine, offensive and defensive tack-
le; Louis Kelley, oftensive center
and defensive tackle; Dick Lamb,
defensive guard: and Phil Wood-
ward, offensive guard. All spark-
led on last fall's freshman teamr

Augustine, at 210 pounds, is the
biggest man on the squad. Lamb,
who win also battle for an offen-
sivo job at fullback, is 195; Wood-
ward 135; and Kelley 175

Two others likely to see a lot
of action in the defensive line are
junior Bob Geller, 205, and senior
Nlcl-r Nonos.

Three Ends

Letterman Al Peterson, junior
college grad John Lawson, and has-
ketball ace Jeff Frantz, Will share
Offensive duties at and. Peterson
was a regular a year ago, grabbing
ll passes for 143 yards Lawson
earned junior College ail-American
recognition at Ellsworth in 1964.
All are in the 180-190 pound class.

Junior veterans Tum Hill and
Nord Brue look like the defensive
ends. Hill is 195, Brue 185.

Left Half Position

Senior Dave Synhorst and junior
Bob Watt both veterans, will has
tie for the left half job,

A 130 pounder who put most of
his time in on defense the last two
years. Synhorst is last with a fine
change of pace. Wait, a stocky

yards 3 year ago for a 4.5 average,

is also a threat as a pass receiver
and on punt and kickoff IEturns.

(Io-captain John Shierholz, a 170

A smart and elusive darter with
good speed, he netted 323 yards as
a junior for a 5.1 average,

Back to direct the pro type oi-
iense from the quarterback slot is
senior Barry Anderson, 170. He
completed 63 of 134 passes last
season for 742 yards and eight
touchdowns.

Inexperienced Harrier Squad
Faces Si'clie Meei Saiurdcly

Graduation and rain—both are
hindering Grinnell’s cross country
prospects.

Three of Grinnell's veteran, ﬁfth
place team graduated leaving
what coach Dick Young calls “one
of the youngest squads I’ve had in
my eight years at Grinnell.”

What Young went on to call a
“growing year” is being ham-
pered by rain and cool weather.
“We haven't had a single good
conditioning day yet," said Young.
“But, considering the weather, I
guess we are coming along as
well as can be expected."

Tomorrow opens the season for
the Pioneer runners. They'll be at
a State Federation run in Ames.
Young plans to take eight Pioneers
to the meet. Those eight are letter-
men Jeri Langharn and Steve Brint~
nall as well as newcomers Dick
Lovell, John Sharpe, Doug Dray,
Ric MacDowell, Spencer Clark, and
Bob Grant.

Lovell, a junior out for cross
country (or the first time, has been
the big surprise so far.

”He's been looking good and
should help us," said Young. “And
I also like the way Brintnall is
shaping up." Erintnall is the only
1964 returnee. Langham, who ran
in 1962 and 1963, missed last sea<
son while on a special study prol-
ect and has been limited by an
operation he underwent during
the summer.

The rest of the team is made
up of sophomores.

An increase in the distance of
the course to four miles from the
old three miles will pose a prob
lem to the Pioneers according to
coach Young. He explained that
most of his runners are middle
distance men so it will be that
much harder for them to run the
longer distance.

Coach Young, though, has high

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hopes for the harriers. He expects
to challenge Carleton, the odds-on
favorite, for the conference crown.
Carleton will be seeking its fourth
straight championship.
