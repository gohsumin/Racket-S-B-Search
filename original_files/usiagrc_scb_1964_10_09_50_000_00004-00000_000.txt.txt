Al Press Conference

Dominick Declares Reporters Fair,
Columnists Unfair to Goldwater

By Susan Taylor

The mam issue of the 1964
presidential campaign is cen-
tralization of power, according
to Sen, Peter Dominick (R-

, 0310.). He made this statement

in a student press conference in
Roberts Theater Tuesday of
ternobn.

Dominick answered q u e s4
tions posed by a student panel
representing Theta sigma Phi,
women's professional journal-
ism iralernity, Sigma Delta
Chi, men’s professional jour~
nalism fraternity, Young Re-
publicans, and Young Demo-
crats. Later the questioning was
thrown open to the audience oi
students, faculty and towns
people.

Power has been increasingly
concentrated in Washington and
in the Executive Department,
according to Dominick. "it we
can dispense this power and
get back to more state and lo-
cal government, we can do a
more effective job,” he said.

Dominick was asked to de-
fine a conservative. “The clas-
sical philosophical definition of
a liberal is what we believe in
as conservatives,” he said. This
involves a concept of as much
freedom as possible for the in-
dividual,

When asked about the farm
price supports program, an is-
sue with which Colorado is con-
cerned, Dominick said, “We’ve
got to move in thesdirection of
getting the government out oi
the lives of farmers.” l-le fur
ther explained that we need to
get back to the law of supply
and demand, in which he ex-
pressed strong faith.

“The breakdown of law and
order is of conSIderable con—
cern all over the country,“ the
Senator said in answer to a
question seeking an explana-

, tion of a national police force.

“Neither Scnator Goldwater
nor I feel that a national po-
lice force is necessary.” l-Ie

 

saicl that integrity ot govern-

 

ment at the national level
serves as an example for local
areas of law enforcement.

Dominick also emphasized
that there must be integrity of
the national government — es»
pecially there must be a lack of
the corruption evidenced in
such cases as Bobby Baker
and Billy Sol Estes 7 to serve
as examples for local and state
governments.

When asked about the civil
rights situation, Dominick said
"I don’t think the CiVll Rights
Bill is a partisan issue." He
voted for the bill which was re-
cently passed by Congress and
signed by President Johnson.

“I don't think you’re ever go»
ing to solve a civil rights
problem by legislation You can
create equality of opportunity,
but it‘s a situation which must
be treated on an individual ba-
sis once you have established
the legislative opportunity for
people to go forward or back-
ward as they like,” Dominick
explained. You have to get a
change in atmosphere and cli-
mate, he explained, and this is
a difficult problem which can-
not be solved by making lawsr
He termed it a problem of the
heart and mind, saying, “You
can’t legislate prejudice.”

Dominick is active in the
Goldwater campaign, but he re
fused several times to speak for
the Republican nominee for
President. He said that he feels
that on the whole the reporters
for the national news media

have been fair to the Republi-
can ticket, but that some of the
columnists have not represented
the views, statements and be
liefs of the senator fairlyr

When asked about the John
Birch Society, as an extremist
organization Dominick said,
"That’s a phony issue too. You
might think they were an atom
bomb." He referred to the so-
ciety as a “patriotic organiza-
tion trying to do something
about the course the country is
taking # especially in foreign
policy."

Dominick was asked for an
example of a federal program
which could be done more ef-
ficiently by state and local gov-
ernments. He cited the poverty
program.

He said that the election 0!
Senator Goldwater to the priest
dency would be of benefit in»
ternationally because it would
“help our allies to know where
we stand, and heaven’s knows
they don’t know where we stand
now.” He further commented
that it: was not his intention to
run an America election on the
basis of what Europeans think.

The press conference, the
sixth of its kind on campus, was
attended by about 200 students
and faculty members. It was

sponsored by Theta Sigma Phi,

Sigma Delta Chi, Young Repub-
licans, and the Program in
Practical Political Education.
Another such conference is
slated for next Tuesday and
will feature Senator Birch Bayh
(Dino).
