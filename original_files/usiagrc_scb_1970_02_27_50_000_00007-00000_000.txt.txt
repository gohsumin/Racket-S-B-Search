Dr. Ronald Kurtz Returns From Liberia
To Discuss conditions all Gutlington

Cuttington College' IS a private
church related, liberal arts
college located 120 miles inland
from the capital of Liberia. Built
on tribal land purchased a cen-
tury ago by one of the American
Colonization Societies who were
returning slaves to Africa,
Cuttington is thought to be the
only American-style liberal arts
college in sub-Saharan Africa.
About one fourth oF its 250 stu-
dents come from African coun-
tries outside Liberia.

Sinre 199-3 the Associated Col-
leges of the Midwest has been
sponsoring a program to give its
graduates the opportunity to
serve as teaching assistants at
Cuttington and to give its faculty
members the chance to serve
on the Cuttington facility. Cut-
tington students can study at
ACM colleges in preparation for
American graduate schools.

The college has always had
limited financial resources, part-
ly because the Liberian govern-
ment and USAID give onlv
limited support to the church»
related school. The college
receives a few donations, but the
bulk of its support comes from
the Episcopal church, w. s. aid
agencies, and the ACM program,
which has been supported pri
marily by the Eord Foundation,
the Rockefeller Foundation, and
by faculty grants under the Fulv
bright-Hays Act. Although many
large American universities have
affiliations with larger African
Universities, none had bothered
with Cuttingtnn.

Dr. Ronald Kurtz, Associate
Professor of anthropology at
Grinnell, spent the last two
academic years at Cuttington
under a teaching and research
program sponsored by the ACM.
During the first year he taught
at the college, but he devoted the
second year entirely to field re—
search.

Kurt: said that it was sur-
prisingly easy to adjust to living
and teaching at Cuttington. The

housing was excellent, and the
college‘s facilities were good. He
was quick to point out that the
college community was some-
what isolated from the surround-
ing peoples, a bit like a colonial
compound. This was the dif-
ficulty in adjusting. The social
structure expects a certain kind
of relationship between faculty
mernbers, most of whom are
white, and the natives of the area.
Mr, Kurtz thought this a little
awkward. For example, “every-
one was expected to hire local
help in the household and not to
pay more than a certain amount
of money for the services."

“A man can, however, obtain
something of great value in a
context he may not like. I thought
that Cuttington was a very good
college." One of the great satis-
[actions for Kurtz was the op—
portunity to deal with such a wide
range of students. There were
Children of tribesmen and of
some of the elite families of
Africa all attending the same
college. Many tribesmen were
doing excellent college-level
work, partly because of the good
training they had received from
missionaries before coming to
Cuttington. All the students were
very challenging, freely
questioning many Western ideas
about politics and education. Mr.
Kurtz added that Cuttington is
doing the best it can to make
its college education relevant to
Africans 7 more African and
fewer European History courses,

a greater emphasis on African
writers in literature courses, and
in general a greater emphasis on
African culture and African
problems. This is a much dif-
ferent approach from some of the
European type schools on the
continent, which maintain unr
alloyed European curriculums.
Cuttington is not affected by the
kind of corruption, e.g. grade
buying. which the University of
Liberia in Monrovia is just be-
ginning to overcome;

Many of the foreign students
who attend Cuttington are re-
ceiving aid from the United
States government under a
program which allows them to
attend school in another African
country. The Africans generally
prefer this to sending students
to Europe or America to be
trained, because often the best
talent never returns from over-
seas to developing Africa where
it is badly needed.

One of the biggest problems
Cuttington College faces is
related to the sparsity of trained
men in Africa. Although the chief
administrators at Cuttington are
Liberians, the faculty is predomi-
nately white and temporary. The
faculty therefore has little sta-
bility. The college recognizes that
the long-run solution is to recruit
Africans to the faculty, but since
there are many challenging ca-
reers available to a college
trained man in Africa, this is
