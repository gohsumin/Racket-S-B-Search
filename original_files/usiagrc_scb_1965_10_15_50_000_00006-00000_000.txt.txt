WlIS Auction Deemed Success as $9M Is Collected

By ALAN AXELROD

Well OKAAAYY! The \VUS auction
laturday night bruught in $914 for the
.World University Service and at the same
time provided an evening or iroliosorne en-
tertainment and gay abandon for some 400
,wacky cullege illnsters.

Goad times? You better believe it. The
bidding was SCI ﬁerce that there was talk
of rolling Out the fire hoses to cool off the
overly exuberant. One girl who tainted af-
ler losing out on a Wesson Oil party said
she had withdrawn her savings from the
Poweshiek County bank for the occasion
and was utterly crushed at gomg home
empty handed. _

Pl‘ofessiunal auctioneer Dick Seers gave
the auctibr; a genuine flavor and an hon—
est-to-goodness Osage lndlan, who was
spotting the bids, gave the auction some
Inure genuine flavor or a riliterent nature.

Prices ranged from $1.50 for ironing
service to $135 for President Leggett’s din-
nerr Other big attractions were a party by

 

the ireshman cheerleaders, which went for
$45; a Gates Hall Roman orgy, $56; a Scar
leteers’ pajama party, 540; and hreakiast
in bed served by the Cleveland girls, which
was lmally plucked by Tom Pope tor $39.

Perhaps the most controversial item at
the evening was the North Younker sere-
nade that inspired“a top bid of only $6.
George Witigrat opined, “It was a very
conservative bid." And house president
Nick Nonas’ only words were, “I were
shocked! We was robbedl”

The auction itself brought $871. The re-
mainiilg $43 was brought in by a jail spon-
sored by WRA, a car-smashing event spon-
sored by ROTC, and a turtle race that
would have seemed paradoxical to Zeno
himself.

Tile only important ingredient missing
was the tradlliunal carnival belore the auc-
(ions However, there was a gala rock ’n roll
dance preceding the auction. and of course,
as a once-famous man once said, “You
can’t bake a cake and also eat your bread.”
