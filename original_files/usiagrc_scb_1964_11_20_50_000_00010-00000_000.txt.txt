Olaf Defeated
In Final Game

. Pete Staben

The Grinnell Pioneers ended
‘ the 1964 season with an impres-
sive 28710 victory over the
Lions of St, Olaf. Led by four
teen seniors, Coach Bowers'
professional Pioneer team
clinched a fourth place tie with
Beloit,

The Grinnell offense scored a
season high of 21 points by the
running of John Shierholz,
Marty Ringo, and Elston Bow—
ers. Whenever the running
game bogged down, wizard
Quarterback Barry Anderson
reached into his bag of tricks
and pulled out the football,
,Then he proceeded to complete

asses to star ends Mike De»

ltt, Al Peterson, and Dave
Gauger.

All in all, the season proved
successful. This writer feels
that the team could have fin-
ished higher if they only had
played consistently. The two-
platoon system proved effec-
§ive with the defense and of-
ense both rating high in these
two departments.

Prospects for next year look
good with an outstanding fresh-
men team and seasoned veter-
ans led by co-captains elect
John Shierholz and Paul Thur-
ston. The only question mark
is can a successful small-cob
lege coach continue to recruit
75% of his ballplayers from the
Iowa-Illinois area constituting
only 50% of the Grinnell en-
rollment. This writer feels that
if Coach Bowers can, .Grinnell
will be a conference winner in
the near future.

Seniors playing for the last
time for the Pioneers were
Mike Dewitt, Elston Bowers,
Rein Saral, Pete Staben, Mike
Miller, Morgan Michel, Den-
nis Hanssen, Marty Ringo, Den-

' ny Homerin, Rick Miller, Chip

Clark, Larry Miller, Dave Gau-
ger, and Skip Weyrauch. These
seniors were the nucleus of a
team that for a three-year pe-
riod Won l7—lost G—tied i. All
that is left for us to say is good
luck. Rookies,

 

Coach Depends on Veteran Swimmers
Three Sophs to Help Carry the Load

Given a chance to climb back
to the Midwest Conference throne
room after a 3»year lapse, Coach
lrv Simone will be depending on
four veterans and three sopllo~
mores to carry most of the load
for his swimming team.

The four lettermen H Tony Hor-
ton, John Kraai, Ralph Pray, and
Howard Schein — had a hand in all
3 points Grinnell notched on the
way In a fourth place spot in the
1964 loop meet,

Kraai, set a new Grinnell record
of 2:313 in the 200yard breast-
stroke a year ago and came in sec~
and in that event in the league
meet. He also swam on Grinnell's
second place Myard medley relay
foursome and was a consistent
high placer in the individual med-
fey event.

The team's distance ace, Pray,
came in second in the myard
freestyle and fourth in the 500-
yard freestyle at the conference
meet and also swam on Grinnell's
third place dooyard freestyle re-
lay team He won the two distance
events 17 of 20 times in dual meet
action.

 

Schein was always a high finisher
in 50-, 60-, and lanyard freestyle
events and came in fourth in the
100 at the league meet. He an-
chored the freestyle relay four-
some,

Horton specializes in the back
stroke and was beaten only three
times in 10 dual meet triesi He
placed fourth in the conference
race and also swam on the free-
style and medley foursomes

Other lettermen on the squad are
Roger Abendroth, a diver, and
Eric Jacobson, butterfly. They
picked up valuable points in their
specialties during the 196364 cam-
palgn.

Top sophomore prospects are
Ken Adelman, Richard Lance and
Charles Schnell.

The younger brother of if fore
mar Pioneer Star who still holds
several records, Adelman set a
new conference fresh mark in the
zoo-yard butterfly. _

Schnell will give Grinnell excel-
lent depth in distance events and
the backstroke. He wrote a new
loop freshman mark in the 500‘
yard freestyle.

Football Team Finishes its Season
Seniors End Their Playing Career

.rini Ramsey

A cursory glance at the Pio-
neer’s 573 finish would indi-
cate a somewhat - less » than
spectacular season; but a more
exact analysis reveals that the
record alone does not imply the
team’s true strength. This cone
clusion, although among the ra»
tionalizations of any season
postmortem, is borne out sulr
stantially by statistics. While
finishing in a 4th place tie With
Beloit in conference standing,
the Pioneers ranked 2nd in to-
tal defense, allowing opponents
an average 179 yards and lo
points a game, and 3rd in total
offense,

The Pioneer’s long suit lay in
an experienced and determined
defensive team, While the team
was primarily the same one
which a year ago proved such a
vital weakspot, especially in
pass defense, an added year of
eitperience and the coaching of
Gene chert molded it into
one of the league’s toughest
units, shuting their opponents
out in half the games. After a
first game defeat to Ripon, and
later losses to Eeloit and Coe,
the pride and determination of
the Pioneer defense was instru»
mental in recovery and subse-
quent victories.

The offensive attack, scor<
ing at least two touchdowns in
every game, was extremely
well-balanced, While a substan-
tial majority of total yardage
was gained on the ground. The
unique feature of this attack
rests in the fact that no Grinr
nell player was among the
league's top ten scorers, in
spite of our 3rd place ranking
in total offensive yardage: The

fact that opposing defenses
keyed their forces primarily
against halfback Elston Bow-
ers, leading team scorer and
rusher for two seasons, enabl-
ing other backs to shake loose,
may partially explain this con»
tradiction; but. more»so it illus-
trates the united team effort
which supported such a produc-
tive attack.

Individual recognition on
such an evenly balanced Pio-
neer squad would have to in-
clude a good majority of the
team. No one player or group
of players can fairly be given
credit for either the offensive
or defensive strength: a sec-
and ranked defense, a remark-
ably even distribution of scor-
ing among the offensive backs,
and 6 out of 7‘0ffensive linemen
receiving recognition in the
Des Moines Register's list of
outstanding Iowa linemen all
give clear evidence to the fact
that total team effort and de-
termination wera responsible
for a successful season,

With 14 seniors on this year’s
small squad, the Pioneer future
would at first glance appear
dim. But several factors may
shed some optimism on next
year’s forecast, First, with a
freely substituting tWOVplatocn
system, many juniors and
sophomores gained valuable
experience this year, Secondly,
the freshmen squad, boasting a
243-1 record may adequately
fill many of the gaps left by
gradaliting seniors. Finally,
Tom Lannom, varsity defensive
linebacker and offensive Cen-
ter, may receive another year
of eligibility, which would lend
both strength and experience on
next year's team.

As the Chill 01 the North Wind

atomy, the scene of physical ac-
tivity and rivalry shifts from the

The Sounds of volleyball are here
again

To acquaint our readers with the
many and diverse aspects of this
seemingly simple game, ANIMAL
LIFE has culluded with several
eminent authorities on volleyball,
whose guest editorials will appear
frequently in the following weeks.

Our first article, which deals
with the history of volleyball, was
written by Dr. Duard Farquardt,
instructor in Primitive Pastimes,
Brain More College for Women,

“Volleyball and the ILA"

Volleyball is a modern adapta-
tion of g game believed to have
originated on the Scilly Islands, off
the North Coast of Cornwall, Eng
land, centuries before the arrival
of the Romans, A favorite sport of
High Priests of the Druidic cult,
it was originally played outdoors,
the implements — burning tinder,
heartshaped boulders, Cobwebs,
and condemned criminals.

In the modern version, the haz<
ards of fractures, searing. tetanus,
and spider bites have been re-
duced, if not entirely eliminated hy
substitution of symbolic pieces
(ball and net) which permits the
playing of two or more games by
the same player, meanwhile re-
taining a surprisingly ibeful
amount of the original spirit-and
excitement. (Next Week — Pro-
liminaries).
