Anku on Ghana's OnerParty Rule

By Vincent Anku

By a resounding majority in
I referendum a few months ago,
the people of Ghana adopted
the OnerParty System of (from
ernment. Immediately some
sectors of American press
aharged Nkrumah with elimi-
nating the last vestiges of de-
mocracy in Ghana. They hast-
ﬂy labeled the whole referen-
iium e hoax. I think both accu-
Iations are unfounded. -

The revered American Presi-
ilent Lincoln imprisoned his op-

nents at an army camp in

e 1864 election. Does one con.
clude that the whole 1864 Pres-
Idential election was a farce?
Ihis reference is no attempt on
my part ‘to justify the flaws in
Ghana‘s referendum, but sim-
ply to substantiate my asser-
tions. 1 am painfully conscious
of some glaring inconsistencies
In the voting procedures. Some
lazy and negligent civil servants
are to blame, not Nkrumah.
However, it is erroneous to stig-
matize the whole referendum
as a farce. No wonder the
Ghana press retorted that the
monstrous and unpleasant ru-
mors about the referendum
were definitely fornented by evil
neocolonists in Ghana. ‘For
there is no doubt that at least
80% of the voters are already
[yoluntary members of Nkru-
mah's party. A few days after
to the referendum, the Febru-
ary 2 issue of the Des Moines
Register made this remark:

“Nkrumah is still an ex-
Iz'emely popular leader and
there is little doubt that his
party would win any referen-
‘dum it cared to back.”

How any sensible person can
make such a statement and at
the same time claim that the
yoters were all compelled to
yote ”yes” ls hard to under-
nand.

To give an example which
may indicate that the results
of the referendum was a gen—
uine majority decision, I quote
a Nigerian radio commentator
January 4, 1964:

“There is so far no evidence
that President Nkrumah is not
a majority ruler in Ghana. In
fact, few African leaders com-
mand the level of spontaneous
response and sincere support

 

President Nkrumah gets from
the masses of Ghana.”
Ghanaians, who are proud of
their efficient democratic sys»
tem, believe that the essence of
democracy, which may take
different forms, is majority
rule. One may then be tempted
to absolve Nkrumah from
blame and charge Ghana with
tyranny of the masses. As I
had observed in an earlier
article tyranny of the masses
is an inherent feature of all
democratic processes.

Is the One-Party State desir-
able in Ghana? Absolutely Yes.
Below are citations from a
leading British and an Ameri-
can journal which corroborate
my stand.

cannot afford to dissipate Its en»
deavors through the senseless
wranglings and destructive tac-

opposition encourages. There is
no sense to entertain filibusters,

countries like Sweden. In the
