Ind 9:30 pm. Sunday in ARI-i auditorium,

Dassin’s first French ﬁlm, leili, reputedly one of the finest
crime nicks ever produced, tells of a careiully-planned, shrewdly-
executed jewel robbery. Characters are developed so that the audi-
lnoe identiﬁes with the thieves and hopes for their success,

A full thirty-ﬁve minutes of the iilm IS without dialogue —
each moment and action of the robbery is scrutinized; the viewer
{eels all the suspense of participating in the robbery.

Bosley mether. of The New York Times, said that Dassin,
"ltaged the robbery like a ballet,”

Hawaii, taken from the book by James A. Mitchner, and star-
ring Julie Andrews, Max Von Sydow, and Richard Harris is

SLEEPY SENATE
SIFTS SMALLTALK

SGA President Ric MacDow-
ell, at Wednesday’s Senate meet<
ing, expressed his disappoint-
merit in Students‘ lack of in-
volvement in campus issues,
Noting that few students are
discussing changes in the hall
lystem, and that few showed
up at last week's discussion or
the Haveman curriculum re-
port, Machwell said that if
students are not participating
now, they have no right to com
plain about future develop-
ments. Lack of involvement and

plans tor a study group on
cities to meet during the second
semester. He wished to make
it clear that all plans are still
tentative

Plans call for an interdiscipli-
nary study group, with the par-
ticipants to receive two aca-
demic credits. Groups would
meet in Seminar form, receive
visitors, and go on ﬁeld trips.
Members or a iaculty study
group on the same prob-
lems would guide discussions in
the student groups.

Possibilities for visitors in—
clude the Ecumenical institute

apparent lack of concern, he
laid, "negate the whole idea
of student responsibility and
student power,”

LIIB NOTES

By DARCY KELLEY

Basic research does not set out to make better mousetraps.
These products are usually unintentional byproducts of scientiﬁc
investigations Basic research is done because the scientist Is in-

, terested in peculiar problems. -

Guillermo Mendoza (Biology) studies a family of Mexican ﬁsh.
These ﬁsh are viviparous. Embryos develop inside the combination
ovary-uterus until birth. The development of viviparity in ﬁsh has
produced many morphological and physiological adaptations, in
order to obtain nutrients from the ovarian fluid, for example, the
embryos have developed specialized structures which iunction in
nosonion. Such structures include the long ribbon~like strands of
tissue (processes) that grow (mm the perianal tin.

Prior to Mendoza’s investigations, it was assumed that these
processes were resorbed by the Iish shortly after birth. Mendoza
observed that the processes may drop on instead. Leaves drop
off trees in the tall. tar example, because of the growth or an no-
scission layer across the base pt the leaf-stem. Similarly, Mendoza
is investigating (among other areas) the changes in structure that
precede the detachment of processes.

Mendoza was introduced to these fish in graduate school, be-
came interested in them and is Still doing research on thEir biologi-
cal tunctions. Why? He might develop a new pregnancy test along
the way, but this consideration has little to do with his motivation
tor research. Curlnus animals :nspirc curiosity. in motivating sci-
entists, discovering prlnClples is more Important than discovering
products.

SHOW INITIATIVE FUND USE

By LEE ARBETMAN,
INITIATIVE FUND
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

Now in its second year of
operation, the Initiative Fund is
finally being used as It was
originally intended: to encour-
age uniqueness and creativity
in social planning.

Formation of the fund, which
was put Into operation in the
Fail or 1966, stemmed from a
desire on the part at the halls
to receive extra ﬁnancial old
when joining forces on a party,
and from the Senate's wish to
increase social interaction be
tween North and South Campus.

At that time it was decided
that the halls could apply to
the fund for inter-hall or hall-
taculty social gatherings. Ob-
iections raised were primarily
concerned with the {act that
halls were being unfairly co-
erced into multi-hall parties
which occasionally turned out
to be fiascoes.

This year, with a liberaliza-
tion of application criteria, most
requests for money have come
from groups of students inter-
ested in providing events open
to the entire campus. A few
examples of events either fully
or else in large part sponsored
by the fund include the Chess
game on Barber Plaza, the
BIi‘d»Bowl Hall, the GRAB (out-
door dance and sleep-out), the

In addition, the fund has
helped to defray the costs of
several ottcampus parties and
dinners tor students who are
tundless for social planning even
though they pay the same at.»
tivities tea as the on-campu:
students.

Halls are still encouraged to
apply for help in ﬁnancing
their social projects (though
multi-hall planning is not I
requisite condition). But this
year the Initiative Fund ha-
been able to liberalize its cri—
terin enough to allow it to sup
port events which illustrate
creativity and uniqueness—two
glaring weaknesses in most hall
sponsored social affairs.
