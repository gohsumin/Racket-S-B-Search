Change in Administrators

By DAVID swer:

This week, President Leggett oiiiclally
announced changes that will be made in
the Dean's Ofﬁce next fall. Dean Th0mp<
son (’58) will continue editing the
alumni magazine as well as handling
students' curriculum problems. But he
will no longer be called a dean, which
Is the title he has held since he came
here in ’64, and will be moved out of
his present location in the dean's oiiico
next fall,

At the same time. the college is in-
terviewing applicants tor another job.
that of Associate Dean of Students.
This dean will take on the same responsi-
bilities that Dean Low now handles. That
Is, he will be concerned with student life,
especially with respect to the residence
halls. He will also be involved in person-
al and group counseling for both men
and Women students.

Dean Low, Dr. Walker, Dean Stauss.
and President Leggett will make the
iinal selection They are fairly sure
that they want a man [or the position,
although there would be no designation
of women's and men's deans. Aside from
this, there is some controversy as to the
exact role of the new dean. For exam-
ple, a black man has been interviewed
for the job, and some members of the
administration feel that in the case that
he is hired, part of his job should be
working specifically with the black stu.
dents on campus. Others take the View
that someone else should be hired for
this role, and that the associate dean
should be solely concerned with student
life in the same manner as Mrs. 10w.
regardless of race. Obviously, the job
will be tailored, to some extent.

Siuuss To Join
Colorado College

James ii. Stauss has been appointed
executive vice president and provost of
Colorado College, beginning August 1, it
was announced last Friday.

He will become the chief administra-
tive officer under the president of the
college, Dr. Lloyd E. Worner. Stauss
will be specifically responsible for de-
velopment in addition to working closely
with the president on long-range planning
and general affairs.

“it will be a great reassuranoe to
have him with us as we move into times
which represent for the independent bol-
lege both extraordinary opportunity and
great fiscal concern", commented Presi-
dent Worner.

Is A Tea Party Obscene?

February 6 is seeming farther and
rarther away. in the Playboy demonstra<
tors' case the wheels oi justice are grind-
ing so slowly that it is questionable just
what they are grinding.

On diippinggreenhouse Monday, the
eight demonstrators hosted a post-ar-
raignment reception in Conierenco
House. The arraignment was handled by
their lawyer. Dan Johnston, Monday
morning,

Formal engraved invitations requested
the presence of people who had been
involved with the case. Raspberry red
punch with purple flowers iloatlng in it
and mamamade cookies were swal-
lowed unpremeditatedly. People, sitting
standing, and lying, talked about are
raignrnents and birth control and the
time oi day.

An “indecent exposure" trial seemed
ridiculously incongruous. But some
time between now and next {all there
will be one. The Poweshiek District
Court Judge is not sure when he will get
to hear their case. it seems that many
people are seeking justice these days.

If the trial were to be held this sum.
mer or next fall it would be unfortunate.
Witnesses and participants would have
to come lroin long distances and there
would be little chance for student sup-
port. The delay in setting a trial date,
the disproportionately intense investiga-
tion, and the unnecessary hearings raise
the question of whether the wheels of
justice are grinding at all. As it becomes
later and later, the situation takes on a
more and more Kaikacsque air, (a
Molly Malcolm term).

SAGA F lies High

Another SAGA extravaganza” A
chance for revenge on Chuckll

This Sunday afternoon, Mac Field will
be the scene of the First SAGA All-cams
pus Kite-Fly, with lots of added attrac-
tions. Prizes (events and judges to be
determined) include dinner for two at
IDs, and so, yes, thirty cream pies
to be thrown at the stationary target or
none other than SAGA Chuck himself.

A picnic supper will be served iollow.
ing the frolicking. In case of rain, the
KiteFly Will be held in Cowles Dining
Hall.
