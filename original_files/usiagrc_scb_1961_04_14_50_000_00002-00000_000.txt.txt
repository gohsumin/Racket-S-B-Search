The Dunner Lelle

Dr J scph Dunner's letter, (see letters to the edit '
collided by all "oye eadiue" ol' tlle 5&1} editol l,
‘ l'ttrlzllKl Let Us See Fill Ourselves” and by all
’ .ng’ly naive acceptance ol' the state department line.

The editorial. we think, was a mild one The noticor
I! hick ol‘ baclk mind was based on the a lmptiou
that both Sides oi the Cuban question had just been
thoroughly discussed at the, Latin American conference.

Because, however, there still appeals to be some
co'll'll.'oll. we are discussing Dr. Dunner's letter heie, ill
hopes ol cla ng' our oi ginal position.

One poillt must he made cle’ '. At no time did this
paper unoualii‘i nlev endolse the actions of Fidel Castro
or the revolutionary government. We view the revoluv‘
tilill a inevitable; we do not agree witll many (it its
methods or \\'\i.l]*‘ 11 ot its philosophy. We, like Di. Dunner,
are concerned with tile p '_ it of the Cuban people, alld
even mole important, with the strange attitudes which
seem to lead the United States tom one diplomatic blink
der to the next. Most important, we do not take a clear
cut motion in the matter because as we see it, the l'acts
simply are not all iii.

A desire to know the facts w a chief re n for

illg' the editorial We do not like the government
policy of increased sec ecy. We don’t like it ill HUAC; we
don‘t like it in the FBI or the CIA, and we cerainly
don't 1 e it ill Clba. Government rele ' ', and the pr '
( -ept in a few olated cases) have shown only one side
01 the picture \lh any side was shown at all.

if the situation ill Cuba were as horribly black and
white as the Nazi terror in Germany to which Dr. Dane
ner compares it, a strong position would be easy to take.
But more than a few reports just don't concur with the
position Dunner advocates.

Among these are reports heard from the group of ,i'iiakc sure “that the Cuban peo-

1;‘ilt persons who went to Cuba ji t a month before the
tlavel ban was imposed. According to tlielll, conditions
for the Cuban people (the greatest number of whom don't
consider themselves “r lied in dictatorship” are incom—
pal ible with what they were dur g the year of Batis
Shacks have become homes with indoor plumbing; schools
are being built.

Dr. Dunner also implies that visitors who speak
against the new Cuban government will be punished with—
out appeal. Isn’t this also when the case in lands ruled
by men such as Franco, DeGaulle and Truiillo'.7 Where is
Dr, Dunner’s demand for travel bans on those countries?
A revolutionary government is bound to be extra careful
ullt-il it stands on firmer ground. Many Tories, he may ier
call. ill our own revolution had to take to the hills. Mr.
Shapiro who was detained in Cuba and released seemed
not the worse for near, and still open-minded about the
("uhail s tuation.

That the Commun ts are Cuba's t' ends hardly
a wonder when we tied to win l'ricnd'llip ll) cutting ofi'r
their supply of dollars 'and loweril the .inal' quota,
when we are consistently over-conscious of our own ill-
tele. s and unconcerned with those of Cuba. The “utimiilh
iy'tion of industry in Cuba was made only after yeal
in tor the United States businessman, alld year of
' for many lower class Cubans. Some prool' at this is
evident in the fact that Ameri ill busin men were not
willing to accept the Cuban government's ol'l'ei' of pay-
him”. l'or their industries 2 cording to the prices they had
quoted as the industry's Value on tax returns.

The, state department notice that we were witlidral
in! the sugar quota because of United States need is \‘el,
hard to believe, especially nice we be me needy at such
n convenient time. Tile treatment C2 tro received dilrilllr
his United State' visit, likewise. will never win the U. S.
alii' medals for diplomacy. lll Cuba the commui

and the Commil "t, it is not the l'ault oi the ll‘ail' Play for

l'alllt lil' t‘ cilill anee alld a long history of bilttel'efingzereli
llilillilllatic polil

'i'liotlg’ll Dr. Dunner's letter has t'erced us into (le-
lelidilip‘ a po. ti we are not ready to del'elld, it has
helped to illdic te the l'a ’ous contradicto reports alld

with a considerable degree at

The most ambitious aspect
cl their project was the selecV

father meets his stepdaughter in
a brothel, but recognizes her
only when his wife reappears.
Thc inlcrlor .ulualicrr increases
in inl:nsity and terror as a re»

communicate with her iii-l son.
At last lhc young st illegitimate
child drowns in fountain. and
the younger son shoots himsclr.
The exterior play, the picture
frame so to speak, is relatively
simple. The participants in the
inner drama are characters
from life who have come to a
