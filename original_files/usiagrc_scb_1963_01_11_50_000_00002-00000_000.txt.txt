which impressed all of us.

The rest of our ten days we
spent in lectures and discussions,
not always as well received as
the social activities; no wonder,
for most of us had enough from
lectures in our universities. Nev-

to analyze their own viewpoint ‘

‘on the Us. One of the most
,funny things was the “bestseller
list" we made up.

ON THE PLUS side was the
outstanding friendliness and
helpfulness of the American
lpeople and on the minus side
were the date and grade sys—

But . . . was it the program,
or was it the kind help and
guidance of members of the starl‘
or the friendly American hosta
students? . . . somehow we soon
became a community and we
all made triends, whom we were

indeed Webster’s supposnhly,
ilurishing style has been Sacra-l
dotally unshl-incd. His authen—
