this effort. Students were
encouraged to contact other
students from their home towns
now on other campuses. in
addition, they should contact
existing peace groups or
sympathetic persons in home
towns to bring them into the
planning with the hope that the
Christmastime etfort could have
a lasting inﬂuence. Spokesmen
tor the Moratorium pointed out
that many students will return to
their towns again in January ior
between semester break and
could expand upon die initial
December activity then. Thus
anti-war sentiment could be
solidified or peace groups
organized in many areas which
have seen little anti-war activity
to date.

on the 24th, activities centering
on the Christmas theme of
”Peace on Earth” are planned. A
group oi prominent clergymen is
being organized to relate the
Moratorium to normal Christmas
religious actiVities. Among the
events which will take place are
vigils, processions preceeding
church service caroling which
will emphasize “Peace on
Earth,“ and special church
serVices,

GRINNELL
HOBATORIUM

This month’s nationwide
Moratorium against the Vietnam
War is taking place today, Friday
December 12, and tomorrow,
December 13. However there is to
be no ceasing of business as usual
on the Grinnell campus, since no
olTiCial changes in the schedule of
final examinations have been
made

The Grinnell Moratorium
Committee, although reportedly
disappointed by student‘s recent
lack oi enthusiasm in planning
this month’s events, have
scheduled the sale of Christmas
cards both today and tomorrow
as the major activity on campus,
The cards, designed by the
Moratorium Committee, picture
the words “Peace On Earth”
printed over a map of Vietnam
lnaddition, lo the sale, the cards
will be distributed to the town’s
people in a doorrtOedoor
campaign during the day by
various college students.

Iii addition, the Committee will
be showing two iilms on Saturday
night ior high school aged church
youth groups, at the United
Church of Christ in town.

Chairman “We feel the student

the lunch lines here on campus. It
