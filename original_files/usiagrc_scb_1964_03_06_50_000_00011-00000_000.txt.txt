Girls Team Wins
Basketball Game
Against Wm. Penn

By Nancy Gromko

The girls’ basketball team
fought their way to a 53-22 vic-
tory last Saturday over William
Penn, with Sandy Hoth, cap-
tain, scoring a high 32 points.

Miss Hoth was solidly backed
by the 7 other members of the
team; Anne Campbell, Jane
Smith, Marty Dixon, Sue Drie-
l-laus, Le Anne Hoepner, Jean
Watson, and Anita Freer

“it was the ﬁrst time we

- worked together as a team,”
Sandy stated The girls, who
practice an hour and a half
twice a week, usually play half
court against each other.

The Grinnell-Penn contest,
refereed by one girl from each
school, was forced to compete
with a varsity game going on at
the same time, "but. We’ve had
some pretty good crowds in the
past," Commented Sandy. ”The
boys who watch come in with
the idea that it's all a big joke,
but after they’ve been there
ten minutes they’re yelling as
loud as the rest of us.”

The girls’ basketball team,
“open to any girl who enjoys
playing the game," is under
the supervision of physical edu-
cation instructor, Miss Sandra
Leake. “The team this year,”
according to Sandy, “was or
ganized by some of us who,
having played previous years,
got together and started prac-
tlcing.“

“Penn will probably be our
only game this year," the cap-
tain stated. “The interim 5e5r
sion breaks up our schedule so
we don’t usually get to playing
other schools until well into the
second semester. Next year
we’re going to start practicing
during the interim session. This
will give us a Whole month of
actual playing.”

“We’re encouraging more
girls to participate," she ad-
ded. “it’s a lively game and a
good study break—a great way
to let off steam.”

Oldest rival on Penn
State's basketball schedule is
Bucknell. They first met in
1896.

is’ pin was the deciding factor

Trackmen Favored to Take Meet,
Have Bulk of Point Winners Back

The Grinnell College, with
the bulk of their point. winners
returning, is the top choice to
win its third straight Univerv
sity of ChicagOvMidwest Con-
ference indoor track meet in
Chicago tomorrowi

A quartet of Juniors who
make up a crack mile relay
outfit — Ron Schachel, Jeri

Langham, John TePaske, and
Bruce Beckord — lead Grin-
nell. Schachel and TePaske
are the sprinters, with Lang-
ham Ind Beckord the middle
distance aces. In the field,
Jim Miller, a ’saphomore
weight man, is the main
threat.

Expected to put the most
pressure on Grinnell are Mon-
mouth end Beloit. Monmouth,

a team of unknown quality, will
send a highly rated group of
sophomores, winners of the
freshman meet last year, plus
Jim Whalan and Doug Carlson,
two of me better distance men,
and Bob Tucker, a Speedster.

Eeloit, short on numbers, has
returning placers in Mik e
Wolfe, Craig Heiser, and Reed
McNeal, in addition to some
top flight sophomores, John
Schmid, Fred Sattler, Mike
Clary, Tim Corcoran, Alan
Goldberg, and Nic Noell.

Right behind these two come
Carleton, Cornell, and Law«
rence. Carleton appears to be
the toughest in (the field with
John Thiel, shot winner, and
Scott Harrison. a pole vaulterr
Scott Reinertson is a favorite in
both hurdle runs.

Cornell has one of the best
high jumpers in Mike Creigh-
ton, plus a good distance man
in Jim Jamison. Dick Landic
and Bill Trench are the Rams‘
best in the sprints. Lawrence,
hard hurt by graduation losses,
still has Dave Erainard and
Henry Rutz for the dashes, and
Bob Pepper for the pole vault.

Coe will depend mainly upon
To ny McCoy, one of the
league's best hurdlers for tho
past three years. St, Olaf hopes
for points from Dave Draheim
in the broad jump and Rod
Skoge, Warren Funk, and Jim
Heimarck on the track

Even though most of the con-
ference members participate,
this is not an official Midwest
Conference meet.

 

Matmen Challenge Cornell for Conference Crown
Picked to Place Second Ill Journey To Wisconsin

The Pioneer wrestlers travel
to Beloit, Wisconsin, this week-
end, in hopes of capturing the
conference crown from its per-
ennial holder Cornell. The Pio-
neers look strong heading into
the meet, though most coaches
are picking them to battle St.
Olaf for the second spot.

Coach Edd Bowers refuses
to accept this judgment and
gives the Pioneers a real
fighting chance for the top
spot. The grapplers have an
unprecedented 7-1-1 record in
dual matches and three re-
turning conference champions
in Will Van Horne, Larry

Miller, and Morgan Michel.

Miller is undefeated this year

and Van Home has a good

chance to repeat at 147 lbs.

His strongest opponent will
be Olson of Cornell.

Bowers is also pinning his
hopes on 130 pounder Ken
Strubler who has a near pereict
record. However, this division
will be among the toughest int
the Conference with Cornell,“
Monmouth and Beloit as well asr

 

Grinnell entering good men.

HERE

 

Jeff Lewis at 177 lbs. could
come through with top honors,
though he will have very tough
competition from Schmidt of
St. Olaf and Hrouda of Cornell.
both of whom have beaten him
earlier this season.

Marty Ringo, at 191 lbs.. and
Morgan Michel at heavyweight,
are definite dark horses. Ringo
has improved greatly and could
surprise the conference. Mi-
chel, deiending conference
champion, has been pinned
by three conference rivals but
tends to look better in tourna-
ments. Al MacKnight at 137
lbs., took third place last year
and could repeat. He was very
impressive last week" against
Harrison of Knox.

The conference meet promr
ises to be atbattle royal with
Monmouth, St. Olaf and Grin-
nell vying with a weakened Cor-

nell team. Tournament competi-
tion tends to be completely if-
ferent from regular competition
and the Pioneers should have
a good tournament teamr Last
year the grapplers had a fair
dual match record, but they
surprised the conference with
a second spot.

The Rams have two of lhl
5 e v e n returning individual
champions in Don Brown (123)
and Ron Zemke, a l30-p0under
last year who will probably be
at 137 this year, Contenders in-
clude Rocky Flint (130), Lee
Olson (147), Dick Wilkes (167),
and Bob Becker (hwt.).

St. Olaf has one winner back,
Dave Schmidt (177), who ha!
beaten both Lewis, and Cot»
nell's challenger. Dave Hrov
da. The Oles will also get points
out of Ed Rundell (123) and Al
MDen. '
