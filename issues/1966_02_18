Senate Discusses Women's Late Penalties;
Proposal Would Allow 75 'Grace Minutes'

A rider attached to the AWS bill turned out to be more con-

Discussion of an AWS Board proposal tor a change in late

minutes penalties tor women was the main topic oi Wednesday's
Senate meeting The Senate adjourned without taking a vote when
a quorum count was called.

The nws “grace minutes" proposal allows all women students
a maximum of 15 late minutes a semester without incurring penal-
ties. After these minutes have been exhausted, a woman must
serve the normal one night of hall conﬁnement for every five
late minutes.

Under the AWS proposal, each additional late arrival after the
l5 minutes have been used up will be penalized by three nights at
confinement plus one night for every five minutes at lateness

aws Board president Chris Peterson explained the proposal,
pointing out that “most of the latenesses which occur during the
week occur during the first five minutes after the doors are
locked." The idea or the proposal is “to give each woman student
15 minutes as a butter period to account for these accidental late-
nessest"

troversial than the bill itself. Attached to the proposal as a ”final
comment” it suggests that all but tout of the loggia doors be
locked early on weekends. so that they can all he looked promptly
at hours. It also urges the night watchman to start his rounds so
that the Main door he the last one looked and be locked exactly
at hours, ‘

According to the AWS Board “such a proposal will reduce ex-
cessive paperwork tor the nightcheck girls and the Women's Pri-
mary Court, and will culminate in more uniform and stringent
penalties for lateness.”

The procedure provides tor a tile box in the quadrangle ottice
containing a card tor each woman student. The student will sign
in upon late arrival and the nightcheck girl will countersign.

Each time a woman is late, She will be told how many or her
15 minutes remain, The night girl will be responsible for this
computation,

Excused lateness will not be included in the 15 “grace min-
utes.”

Death of Father
Brings Withdrawal

The fourth candidate for Student
Government president. Dan Bucks,
announced his withdrawal from the
race yesterday. The withdrawal
was caused by the accidental death
of Bucks' father. Bucks' father died
in a farming accident Thursday
attemoon near Doland, South Da-
kota. '

After Bucks' withdrawal, th.
election board met and considered
various courses. At one point it
was suggested that the conven-
tion be eliminated in respect to

Bucks' father and that a primary
he held Saturday with the election
on Monday At a meeting at 10:00
this morning. however, the elem
tion board decided to go ahead

Romping Backwards

In case you missed it in your haste to turn to the:
editorial page, 1 refer you to the Senate story on page

one,

If this proposal is being presented in any serious-
ness I think it is one of the most ill-conceived and out-
oi-step actions that the AWS Board could possibly pre-
sent. I refer not to the body of the proposal but rather
the ”final comment,” the rider to the bill.

While everyone else who is concerned about wom-
en’s hours talks in terms of liberalizing them, extend-
ing them, or even (God save us) eliminating them, the
AWS Board seems to be romping backwards in an at-
tempt to make a bad rule worse. The AWS Board is
right when it says that its little rule will “culminate in
more uniform and stringent penalties for lateness.”

I suggest that right now is the time for students
who give passing service to the cause of more liberal
women’s hours to go to their Senator’s room and have

a short chat with him. A

very short chat: Vote no

against the AWS Board’s rider. Vote yes for the 15!

minutes of “grace."

 

Amherst Drops Junior
Who Didn't Take PE

Amherst College has dismissed a
junior, Andrew Plnkowilz. ior iaii
me to meet his physical education
requirement. The administration
decided upon this action alter Pili~
kotvitz told the dean that he had
no intention oi fiiliilling his gym
obligation.

Pinkowiiz had already been dis-
missed alter his freshman year
for tailing four subjects, but he
had been readmitted after studying
a year in a New York college.
When he returned as a sophomore
for the second term of last year,
he was placed on academic pro-
bation. Pinkowitz had three Se
meslei's of gym left to iiiltili a
that lilne, and he received credit
for one of those semesters that

spring.

In the first hall ot his junior'

year Pinkowltz did not attend
gym classes and consequently re-
ceived a letter from the dean in-
forming him that he might be sus-
pended for negligence, He signed

up for gym the next semester but-

after attending a week found that
it cut into his studies too milCl'L
(Pinkowitz had raised his accum-
ulative average lrom 53 to 83,)
Since he was not attending gym
classes, Pinkowilz was dismissed
from Amherst. The administra-
tion gave as the reason ior dis-

 

missal the Student’s failure to
meet the physical education re»
ouii-ement even though taculty
members had urged consideration
of the individual case apart from
rules involvedt students and faculty
at Amherst are outraged at the
expulsion with numerous student
groups and professors appealing
the decision.

“To make clear to the world
that we are not all insane,” was
the reason given by Amherst stun

dents as to wily they marched llli
protest against resumption of
ombing in Vict Nam, Onerliundl‘ed
and Seveuiyriive students from
Amherst and Smith marched int,
Northampton. Massachusetts, two-i
weeks ago. Many oi the marchers
were participating tor the iirst
lime in a public demonstration.

The students marched down the
main street and then held a meeir
lug in a Unitarian Church. They
were unable to get into the city
hall where the meeting was first
scheduled because seventy - live
counter - demonstrators blocked
the entrance Order was kept by
the demonstrators despite taunts
and ridicule by the hecklers car-
rying signs such as “Kill tlie_
Commles.”

The "Grudge Pot

(Nole: Today's World is full of
naked brutality, unscrutabie pain,
and blinding ignorance, and the
only way to escape it all is
th r o u g h airy, inconsequential
ilights oi fantasy. Toward this end,
I present the following romantic
fairy [alkin two parts:

Minnie and the Dozen Dwaris.

A small castle overlooking the
Rhine and a beach-house on the
Riviera. Minnie Twerp often
dreamed of such wonders as she
lay in a puddle in the damp, dark
basement of her cruel step-moth-
er's broken-down (disapproved by
Duncan Hines) castle buried deep
in the shadows of the Black For»
est.

Minnie was a simple lass and
carried the burden or her royal
birth with courage, if not nobil-
ity. Her dire step-mother had
murdered her mother and married
her father and murdered her fath-
er and thrown her in the cellar
with the rest of the junk, but Min-
nie rwcrp always wore a happy
smile.

in keeping with a long family
tradition, Minnie loved mirrors.
The basement was full of them,
and she would whirl about from
one to another like a dmnken bal-

 

lerlna and flash her pretty smile
and laugh, “Mirror, mirror on the
wall, who's the fairest of them
all?”

“I am, Shorty." the mirrors in-
variably replied as she twirled a-
way still gayly smiling, How could
she deny it? Each mirror looked
exactly like her,

Minnie had a problem—several
problems, in fact, When she had
been born, three peals oi thunder
preceded three streaks of light-
ning that struck her father’s origi-
nal palace on each of its three
towers, burning the whole place to
the ground in the grandest blaze
that the peasants had ever wit-
nessed Naturally, everyone knew
that such an amen meant that
Minnie someday would marry a
handsome prince in 3 Walt ois-
my movie and make her fortune
new

But Minnie at the age of 17 was
only six inches tall. Fate, which
tricks and begulles us all, made
her a hill-sized adult at birth, and
she had been shrinking steadily ev-
er since. She had been the most
popular kid in the neighborhood,
the leader of the sandbox set, a
femme fatale even before her
Oedipal contlicts had begun.

Friday, February is. not

She and her smile had been me
delight of society, and now both
were disappearing. Soon, she
knew, she would thin to a vapor
and her wicked step-mother ruth-
lessly would command the friendly
mirrors. “Mirrors! Mirrors on the
floor: Am i not the greatest
hour? A sickening, loathsome so—
cial slug, I disgust with mouth and
mug!"

Minnie threw herself on I
matchbox and wept. She remem-
bered the days when she still had
freedom and had circled the near-
by ponds. kissing irogr in hope
that one might be a prince. Lato—
ly, she had even kissed the Cock-
roaches in the basement, but mi (-
lessly. The inevitable clasp oi timo
soon would snatch her.

Escape, To run, to hide, per-
chance to live, that was the only
answer. The doors and Windows
were fast shut, and a dirty mouse-
hole was her lone exit. “Good-bye,
sweet mirrors," she said with I
sad smile. “Take care”

"Goodbye, shorty," they re-
plied, and she disappeared into the
dark tunnel,

Grinnell Campus Again
Seen lacking Freedom

To the Ediior:

As we are all aware. this is the
week of announcements of candir
(lacy for the SGA Presidency. As

l in years past, the basic issues are

again those concerned with rule
changes. This year I for one have
come to recognize for the ﬁrst
time an unjust state oi affairs
which exists Within the realm of
student rules. it is only natural
that Gi‘iunell students, like our
compatriots across the country,
should desire io undergo our col-
lege experience in a real-life al-
mosphere, Thai is to say, here at
Grinnell we do not experience
real life because we are cloistered
imnl it, and that is good to some
extent. But what better way to
prep re us to assume the respon-
sibilities of society, or more spe-
clilcally to allow us to determine
a responsible personal morality,

, than to grant us some of that [631‘

ity during our Grinnell experi
ence? How does one assume
responsibility? I! it is a charac-
teristic which is inherent in our
personalities, and has only to be
awakened at some mysiel'iOHS mo-
ment ill our development, then i
have grossly misjudged its nan
ture; for l have always recog-
nized it as an attribute of matur-
ily, which is itself necessarily a

‘ piodiict of experience. Obviously.

I think, the only way in which one
can obtain experience is by en-
countering some of the realities at
life “outside." and it seems equal-
1y obvious that sheltering us from
them will never develop a true
sense of responsibility, only an ar-
tificial one at best. Tliemiﬂre we

 

make periodic noises through the
appropriate channels expressing
our desires in that direction, at

which times we are invariably h-r

formed by our student l‘epresenlnr
(iVes that it would not be “pru-
dent" to make such requests at
the present time. And should the

‘occaslon cvel’ arise that silch re-

quests might actually reach re-
sponsible ours, We are, after what
I aln sure is careful c0u51deraii0n,
usually turned down. Why? in all
honesty. it must be admitted that
the administration has every right
lo deny us any change, even any
consideration oi our proposals, for
after all it does have sole opera.
tion rights on the college, son
notwithstanding. or course we all
know too that there are trustees
and various contributing alumni
who necessarily sway our admin-
tralion's decisions, and I am sure
we are equally aware of the gen-
uine validity and signitlcancc at
such considerations. Nevertheless,
l think the administration owes to
the Students of Gi'iuuell some re-
sponsibility toward our desires, iii-
deed our needs in this area. For
it is utter all to a large extent
the students themselves who de-
termine the spirit and image of
the college, and i do not use this
as any kind of a threat But neither
do I believe that this college is
set up as some monstrous game
In which the administration et uli
merely manipulate the students to
their own ends. I was under the
impression that Grinnell's purpose
was to give us an education, and
not me~ ly an academic one, and

Antigone: Excess Intensity Spoils
Characters and Impacts of Play

By DAN MASON

“What one can do, one must do."
HAntigone

Tile Iirst thing I did after the our
tain or Mr. Donaiioe's production
oi Anouilh's Antigone was to take
out my Bic pen and insert a
“t” into the line which appeared
on the program's cover. it should
have read; “What one can't do,
one must do.” Such was the case
in this production.

Comments varied:

“That was a good play, Martha.
Wake up, Jimmy, the play’s over.
Its' time to go home.”

"Mr. Donahoe sure is great,
isn't he? I wish he would direct
me someday.”

“That |hing must have SIIIIered
in translation.”

“Hey Dick, I got the key You
wanta go?”

“They’re all the same. Every
play he directs is the some . .
pseudo-intellectual. . .a messen-
ger coming lroni the audience It

they can’t keep my attention on
stage. . .

“Nolhlng happened. The char--
acters come on playing one part,
and on playing one part. it was
like parallel lines. Creon and An-
tigone. Creon and Guard. An'
gone and lsmene. Creon and Hae-
mou, Haemon and Antigone Anti-
gone and Nurse. They never
met. it was like Antigone keeping
real tight inside, sayingi‘l teel
intense.’ and Creoli sensing his
voice, saying—‘Hey, listen to my
voice.’ There was only one little
passage where two characters ev-
en talked to one another, and i
can't remember where, now."

”That guard was great. wasn’t
lie? Terry McCoy. he’s always in
there stealing the Show, He’s the
only one that really played a part,
I sure couldn't believe that Hae-
mon. Fast cars and loose women,
my xxx. And Helfgott. . .was. . .
Heligolti Bruce did pretty Well,
but 1 don‘t know. . i What did
you think about the set?"

“I don't know. I really can't tell,
anymore. I’ve seen these people
around school so much. Maybe
that's it.”

“The whole thing seemed ster-
lie,"

“1 wish Monto would play some-
thing besides intensity. Fear. or
hate, or joy, or spite, I don’t
know. All that comes across is
intensity.”

“The whole plays that way The
intensity seems to lie Within each
character, yet it constrains the
Whole performance. There’s got to
be conflict in drama. There just
wasn‘t any conflict.”

“Hey, I've got two free tran-
scripts coming to me. What should
i do with 'them?”

The comments varied, I couldn't
help thinking, as l walked away
from Roberts Theater, that plays
are like school, It's not how much
you learn, or even what you learn.
It's what you don't learn that
counts.

 

Frank Gives Views

To the Editor:

An educational institution (in
this case, Grinnell) has a respon
siln ty 7 indeed. an obligation —
to CREATE that environment
which is most conducive to the
student's intellectual and social
maturation. The critical question
is: What is the nature of that en-
vil'onllient? Ann Kil' liner (ill her
letter to the edttor ill the January
28 issue of the 3&3) expresses
her new that Ihe position which
the college takcs. as expressed in
the college catalogue, is a hypo
critical stand; that in reality the
college has not created that en-
vironment which is most conducive
to the stated aims of the college
with rcspect to the development
of what one might call a selfrztct-
ualiZliig personality (see A. H.
Maslow, Motivation and PersonaL
ity, Harper Sc Brothers, New York:
1945). Her argument is Well docua
mcnted and clearly stated, In
hopes that it may serve some pos
itive function, I only wish to add,
train a retrospective position, that
I heartily agree with her stand
(and express my sympathies to
her).

There is no doubt that Gl'inneli
has made innumerable significant
advances in the past years in the
improvement ot its academic pro
gram, its present challenge MUST
be to expand the scope of these
advances into the realm of its
social environment. Any school is
more than its Iaculty and stu»
dents: the intellectual and social
milieu in which the process of
education (in the broad sense oI
the word) continues provides an
all important foundation. Without
neglecting the maintenance of the
academic calibre of Grinnell, I
think that it should be a challenge
to the administration of the coir
lege to begin to lessen the wide
gap which exists between that
which the college aspires to (as

Retired 5&B Editor
ls Complimented

To the Editor:

I would like to take this oppor~
[unity to compliment Mr. John
Wait for his admirable work as
editor of the 3&3 last semester,
His sound Journalistic skill and
deep Insight into the problems of
our multifarious Grlnnell com-
munity were, indeed, of no usual
nature.

It is my hope that the high
standards of editorship exhibited
last semester Will Continue during
the present semester; however,
since the transition to the new
editorship, the 58:3 may have de-
viated trom its worthy tunotion as
a student paper for, and by, the
Grinnell students. It is my desire
that standards of materialism and
selfrinterest will not become char-
aclel tic of our “Much - loved

Clarifies Aims at 5. Lounge Meeting

By JUDY scorr

Witll ”involvement" emerging as
the key word during convention
activity. the Grinnell Committee

tor Student involvement pushed
their new group tor-ward Monday
night.

The committee’s first open
meeting brought approximately 40
people to the Smith Lounge where
GCSl programs were further clatu

“In light of a new SGA, I am in
hopes that GCSI is not necessary,”
election chairman Jeff Hert told
the group. “But as I view it a
number or articulate, seriously in
terested people can help right
now.”

Herf expressed GCSI hopes to
work with the Senate. Members
were urged to vie for senator-

D.M. Project Meeting ,
Emphasizes Expansion

Members of the Des Moines
Project stressed organization and
expansion in their south Lounge
meeting Tuesday evening.

The establishment of permanent
committees, regular open meet-
ings in a more public place and
community organizing orientation
workshops will highlight the
group's attempts, according to Bill
Downey, project chairman.

These eitorts are an “attempt
to iniorm and interest as many
people around Grinnell as we can
in the project," Downey said.

in explaining the group’s pur<
pose, Downey expressed a con-
cern that the poor people in big
cities can be a “forgotten people."

Billy King, community organiz-
er in Des Moines, reviewed the
project's history and outlined iu-
ture plans. The main efforts in
the past have been concerning
housing and the organization oi
block meetings.

King touched on the success oi
rent strikes in the Walnut Hills
aiea, where the project is work-
ing. He expressed the hope oi es-
tablishing a tenants' union.

Other future plans include a free-
dom school, touching on matters
oi Negro history, community or-
ganizing and the weliare system.
King hopes to expand this into a
freedom house where neighbo
hood people could come to talk
over their problems.

Summer research programs are
tentatively planned on the War on
Poverty, board oi education, and
city government structure. King
explained that students would do

the research, but “it will be up
to the neighborhood to decide what
they want to do with it."

Des Moinesproject workers will
participate Saturday in it Work-
shop on Methods of Community
Action. Bernard LaFayette, jr.,
director of the Urban Affairs Pro-
gram oi the American Friends
Service Committee Chicago otfice
will speak. LaFayette has done
community organizing in ,the
South, He is a graduate of Fisk
University.

College workshops on commun-
ity organizing will begin next
Tuesday, directed by Jean Vander-
voort.

The project in Des Moines is
currently atiiliated, through the
Walnut Hills Neighborhood Union
Community improvement Prjoect,
with the War on poverty, Downey
said they have no other aitilia-
tions, but may try to bring in
another full - time organizer
through 5135. Downey added. how-
ever, that the project would re
main “autonomous”.

Pickets Not News

To the Editor:

Regarding the recent pickcting

it seems strange that such an un-
spectacular event involving such
a small number oi people could
receive nationwide publicity. The
picketlng had little popular sup-
port :iiid hardly a noticeable im~
pact on the campus and yet it was
considered “nesworthy” by the
Associated Press and news media
around the nation. It seems like-
1y that Grinnell’s student report-

the sight ot their stories in print

SDS Pickets Get National Coverage;
CIA Has Seen Better Demonstrations

By BOB HODIERNE

The story was being read by
wire editors of newspapers from
Bridgeton, New Jersey, to l-lamey,
Oregon, before Grinnell students
even realized that their campus
was “embroiled” in a “protest”
against the U.S.'s “super-spy or-
ganization.” the CIA

A handful of Grinnell’s some-
times active chapter or Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
were sitting on the floor of ARH
while a representative of the CIA
interviewed seven Grinnellians for
prospective jobs The students
held a few signs protesting the
CIA’s intervention in foreign coun-
tries

And then the Associated Press
found out.

And then the phone calls started
coming to the College officials,

The Associated Press told the
Sari} they felt at first they were
getting the "rurharound" by the
college when nobody knew any-
thing about the “demonstration.”

 

Soon they realized that tew here
were aware of a protest. But pret-
ty soon people tound out and the
stories started going out.

Stories went to the AP and
United Press International.

Stories went out to radio sta- ,

tions KIOA, WHO, KRNT, WDI,
and, not least of all, KGRNI

College otticials were quietly
hoping that the story would be
used one day in Iowa papers and
on radio stations and forgotten
But behold the power of the wire
services:

A radio
picked it up.

So did one on the East Coast.

And so did a television station
in California.

And then NBC radio used it on
their six o’clock radio “news on
the hour."

And finally the CIA in Wash-
ington felt obligated to make a
statement. In effect they said, so-
what—we’ve seen better demon-
strationsr

So have we,

number in boxed on James Thurber‘r "parable in pictures"

has a unique perspecrive on the
attairs and problems of the col-
lege which the other two parts
of the college community—«faculty
and administration—Cannot have.
In his opening speech Monday,
Wittgrat emphasized, "The stu-
dent has the responsibility and
should have the right to contribute
to the iormation of academic and
administrative policy because he is
the primary element of the educa»
linnal communityr Student govern-
ment in the past has not realized
the full implications of its respon-
sibilities in these policy and pro
gram decisions.

“I would like to see Grinnell
students gaining a more meaning-
ful voice in the functioning of
their college. I will work towards
a student-faculty council, which
would have broad advisory and
policy - deciding responsibility in
all areas or concern to the college.
it is time ior students and taculty
to wnrk together in those areas of
mutual concern rather titan dupli-
cating each others eitorts,” witt-
grai Continued.

As to matters or personal con-
tluct and freedom, Wiltgrat is in

actions on an honest concern for

rattler than on a discordant atti-
tude of "anti—faculty, anti-adminis-
trationr

“Matters of house rules and regu-
lations would be handled primar»
ily by the C of HP and the AWS
board The C of HP and AWS
presidents would be ex—oftlcio
members of the Council.” When
asked about the function of the judi-
ciary branch of the Student Gov-
ernment Association, Wittgrat re
plied that the organization of the
courts might depend on the hall
reorganization decision, if a ma-
jor change is made in that re-
gard

AS to his idea of the students'
part in the hall organization de-
cision, Wittgraf explained that
this “has already been decided as

part of SGA last fall." Students

(Continued from rage I)

Intious with the faculty and ad-
ministl‘ationi He feels that. SGA
pan shape student attitude by
making itself more interesting to
more people, faculty and students
alike.

Sheitder feels that SGA should be
the iocal point tor campus issues.
unrest and dissent. and political
activny, and not just for the re-
organization or itself. “Concern
with campus problems will lead
to broader and more serious con-
cerns about the world, which are
now lacking on this campus.”

He approves or such groups as
the Griunell Committee [or Stu-
dent Involvement and would like
to see the tics: working closely
with the Senate to expose wide.
divergent views. He would also
like the SCSI to develop into a
political party to keep the campus
alive between considerations OI
major issues. It opposing parties
subsequently arose, tuture son
elections could be more crucial.

The iaculty and administration
should be considered the friends
or the SGA and not just a group
or adults trying to impose a mor—
tality on the student body.

“Rule changes don’t come meree
1y because a student leader him-
self expresses a desire for them.
It must he made evident to the
administration that student con-
item is serious This will foster
serious communication, and it is
in this new atmosphere that rule
changes can best be eiiected,"

Among the issues that can be

 

raised are more open rooms. an
alteration of women's hours, and
greater automobile privileges.

An example of how he believes
an issue can be raised and pre-
sented to the administration is in
regard to more open rooms. Shen-
der would present such a request
in the context of the privacy issue,
with more open rooms as provid
ing the chance tor small groups
of students to meet and talk on
weekday aiternoons. Thus the em-
phasis would not be on open bed-
rooms, where it has so often been
misplaced.

“We can stay quiet and satis-
fied and there won’t be any real
noise on campus, but we have to
show the administration that we
want to talk, and they will listen
it serious student support is
shown."

Leadership and personality are
the key characteristics of a good
president, according to Shender.

“The president needs a willing-
ness to get others involved, and
must be the kind of person that
others are willing to work for.

“I welcome ideas from other
people, I don’t have all the an-
swers~nobody does. The more
people get together, the more ideas
will emerge. For the past sev-
eral years the student government
has taken the too-many-cooksA
spoilethesbroth attitude. but they
don't even know any more what
they are cooking."

Along these lines, Shenl‘ler would
put out an SGA Editorial News-
letter to acquaint everyone with
current campus problems and
views.

would necessitate the cooperation
of many. Shender feels that this
would be a good way to merge
student and faculty interest For
instance, he reels there may be
physics protessors who would en-
joy helping students make the sta-
tion a reality.

Shender entered the presidential
race because he was upset by the
fact that students have not been
asked to do anything about their
own campus. He says, “The SGA
is your government, the Senate is
your Senate, and the president‘ls

and a junior car rule similar to
that enjoyed by seniors. As moth-
er tasks that must be perinrmed
by the senate, Kent is “not satis»

effectively utilized in admissions
work as they could he," he hopes
for a change in policy towards
students, use of college vehicles
[or “its just about impossible to
line up a college wagon tor a week
end and the college bus is an
abomination,” and he things that
“parts or the Forum particularly
the Carlee House could be better

The North Campus problem is
complex, but says Kent, “1 do not

In his speech Monday Kent de-
clared, “Alone the SGA Presiden-

he thinks that the degree of ap-

Kent, “was a result of the trouble

The Pioneers will be trying to
avenge the earlier loss to Beloit
and then try to victimize Coe tor
the second time.

One hopeful note irom the two
games last weekend is the im<

Carleton the hoopsters were only

The Carleton game looked like a
parade in the first half as both
the Pioneers and the Carls freely
substituted Both played eleven
men in the first half. Unfortun-
ately, the Carl eleven was able to
build up a comfortable 49-25 lead

Leading scorer for the Pioneers

The Pioneers bounced back

for much at the game like they

half they were behind 33-30 with
about five minutes left when they
ran off thirteen straight points to
take a 43-33 lead. The half ended
with the Pioneers up 44.37,

Swimmers Hurt
By Lontz’s Burn

Sprinter Bill Lontz may be left
home When the Grinnell swim—
mers match strokes with Knox in
a Midwest Conference dual at
Galesburg, 111., Saturday.

Lontz is currently limited to
out - of . the . pool conditioning
because of a pair of burned hands,
the result of a laboratory acci-
dent. The bandages are to be tak-
en oit Friday, but even it the jun<
ior is given the go ahead signal,
he will have missed a full week
at practice.

If Lontz can’t make the trip to
Knox, Coach Irv Simone will have
only live swimmers available for
action and will probably have to
sacrifice both relay units to concen-
trate on the individual events.

Leading the Pioneers will be
Ken Adelman who remained unA

split with Carleton and so Olaf
last weekend, He also copped the
500 freestyle against the Oles.

Hero of the 4545 Win over St.
Olaf was sophomore Rick Seifert.
He placed third in the breast-
stroke, the next to the last event
of the meet, and then with only
about five minutes of rest an-
chored Grinnell‘s winning free-
style relay team in the final race
or the day. The eight points Seifert
helped to secure in the two events
were just enough for the Pioneers
to Win.

Rounding out Grinnell‘s squad
are Steve Holtze, individual med-
ley and backstroke; Bill Batsche-

Today the wrestlers take on
Monmouth, another conference ti-
tle contender, at Monmouth. After
being nipped by Cornell last week,

expected to be a close contest.

Drake Meet Next
For Track Squad

Grinnell‘s trackrnen, who pep
iormed “about up to expecta-
tions” while placing third behind
Iowa and Bradley in triangular
action last weekend, will compete
in the Drake Invitational in Des
Moines tomorrow.

“Most of the boys came close
to what i had hoped for in the
triangular," according to Coach
Dick Young. “Several of the run-
ners turned in fairly good times
for this stage at the season, but
our lack of practice in the field
events was clearly evident.”

Jeri Langham and John Kelsey
paced the Pioneers each gaining a
second and third on the track.
Steve Brintnall and Rick M204
Dowell also did a good job in run-
ning ‘events.

Young will take his full squad
to Drake and will run them under
the Pioneer Athletic Club banner,

Seeing action in addition to
Langham. Kelsey, Brintnall, and
MacDoweIl will be runners Rick
Faxon, Spencer Clark. Doug Dray
and Jim Murtfeldt, and fieldmen
Tom Wood. Walt Neal, Jon Bus-
well, and Tom Russell,

The already thin ranks were
further depleted this week when
Jim Miller the school’s record
holder in the shot put, dropped on
the squad.

Gl'innell will also be represented
by six ireshmen—runners Brian
Barnes. Dave Bray. A1 Cloud.
Mike Hanson, and Al Heimann.
and fieldman Roger Bryant. This
appearance will replace a dual
meet with the Drake yearlings
which had been Scheduled for
Wednesday.
