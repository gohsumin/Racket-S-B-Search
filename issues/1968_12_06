Cornell Reinstates Protesiors
After Six Weeks of Trials

Civil Charges
Face Students

Cornell College‘s Judiciary
Board reached a decision con-
cerning the student protesters
. ho, on October 17. occupied
, ld Sam, the college’s admin-
istration building. The Student-
Faculty Judiciary Board sus-
pended the suspensions oi the
as black protesters, and put
them on disciplinary probation.

lvll charges brought by the

inn County Attorney against
his students are still pending.

The takeover at Old Sem oc-
curred on October 17, 1968, when
36 black Students and three non-
otudants locked themselves in
the building, They presented the
’ﬁdministration with a list of
live demands, which they asked
Cornell's president Samuel

tumpf to promise to implement
within 48 hours. The demands
.were that a black activity cen-
ter be established, that at least
10% of the convocations be pre-
sented by black speakers, that
the curriculum be revised to in-
elude courses on black history
and culture, that the college
step up hiring of black instruc-
tors, and ﬁnally, that no
charges be brought against the
protestors.

President Stumpf refused to
aign the statement, believing
that he did not have the auth-
ority, and Lhat the goals could
not be accomplished in so
short period of time. Because
of pressure from non-protesting
otudents and the Cornell Admirv
istratiun's failure to persuade
the protesting students to give
up control of the building, Col-
lege Vice President and Treas-
nrer Charles Cochran Called the

Hovemnn Report
Propels Course
Revision in Dep’is.

The report of the Special Fa-
culty Committee on Educational
Policy and Curriculum, the
Haveman Report, submitted to
the faculty and President last
year, has proven to be one of
the most iatvi‘eaching reviews
of academic liie at Grinnell in
recent years. Since the report
was made, several new cour s
have been added to the curricu-
lum. and all departments have
felt its iniluences. Some propo<
sais have already been imple-
mented, others are being
planned. The general reeling is
that curricular afiairs are pre-
sently in a slate of (ion.

In the Science division, a
modification of the science re-
quirement went into eiiect this
tall. Under the new plan, stu-
dents are required to take eight
or ten hours of science before
graduation. Science I is a 4 hour
life science course taught by
the Biology department. Science
n. taught by a combined phy-
sics and chemistry statt, is ott-
ered in two lorms. This year, it
is a a credit course, being oil-
ercd both semesters. Next year
a 4 Credit version will be oli-
erad. Science I and il may be
taken in either Order.

To supplement this program.
the Physics department is p1an<
ning a course to iollow Science

Midwest Faculty
Meeting Planned
For December ll

An informal discussion among
concerned ia c ulty members
from Grinnell, C08. and Cor-
nell will take place at Grinnell,
December ii. The general topic
for this discussion is the range
of problems which affects in-
stmctors at small liberal arts
collegcs. Some problems that
may be discussed are student
unrest, student pressures, cur-
riculum reform, and social re-
sponsi lity.

Mr. betts, along with a fac-
ulty member from Cornell, has
organized this gathering. Belts
said that in addition to the
problems affecting the Colleges,
“there is a concern about the
academic development of Such
colleges and the role they might
play in an academic world
verging on change, if not revo-
lution."

“We protessors hops to in-
iorm one another on these prob-
lems and gain some insight into
them. Of course, nothing may
come out of it, but hopeiully
this discussion might lead to

Division Meeting
Poorly Attended;
Disinieresi Noied

A meeting was called Mon-
day for all Humanities division
protessors and junior and sen-
ior majors in the division, The
purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the proposal by the
Executive Council regarding
student participation on Edu-
cational Policy Committees in
the three divisions. There were
similar meetings in the other
divisions.

About thirty students and
three prolessors attended the
meeting. According to Dr, Shel-
don P. Zitner, chain'nan of the
division, those who came
were mainly those who agreed
with the ideas set forth in the
proposal, and they were those
who were interested in work-
ing on the Educational Policy
Committee. The discussion.
therefore, centered around the
finer points of the proposal,
such as the number oi students
on the taculty committee and
the role of those students,

Dr. Zitner felt that the most
significant aspect oi the meet-
ing was the lack of interest. Ho
pointed out that if the same
number of students attended.
the meetings held in the other
divisions, the total number or
juniors and seniors interested
in the educational policies gov-
erning their academic interests
would not be more than 100,

The proposal being discussed
concerned the suggestion that
students either participate on
the faculty policy committees or
that they serve on separate stu-
dent Commiitees. It also in‘
cludes suggestions tor function:
to be served by student coma

The Grinnell House, Home of College Presidents

(Continued flom last week)
By STEPHEN GROW

Designed by the Boston Archi—
tects Erainerd and Leeds, the

President's Home was patterned
after the home oi the President
ol Harvard University, it con-
tains 18 rooms and 51/2 baths
on three floors and a base-
ment. It includes such luxuries
as a central vacuum cleaning
system and a dumbwaiter.

It contains such architectural
oddities as wooden gutters,
sand-moulded brick, and spe-
cial rooi tile, differing from the
tile used on the roofs of the
men’s dormitories — Smith
through Dibble — which were
constructed in the same year,
The house still has the original
gutters and root tile, though
the tile on the dormitory roofs
has since been replaced. It also

has the original bricks; so do
the dormitories, Because Presi-

dent Main was so (all, 6'4”, two
oversized bathtubs were in
cluded,

Very little was written about
the house during the adminis-
tration of President Main, but
there are some interesting facts
related to the house. Mr. L. V.
Phelps, retired former Treas-
urer of the College, was head of
the construction crew which
built the Grinnell House. Presi-
dent Main hired him in the
same year that the house was
completed, and he Worked tor
the College until almost 19'
Dr. John Parish, a local physi-
cian, worked for President
Main when he was a student
at Grinnell in 1925, He chauf-
feurcd Mrs. Main around town
in a Hudson automobile, helped
vacuum the house, and cleaned

the numerous oriental rugs
which the Mains had collected.
At the time, it was one of the
most prized jobs on campus.
More information is available
about the life in Grinncll House
during the administration of
President John S. Noilen. Mrs.
Nollen still lives in Grinnell.
She particularly remembers
entertaining guests while living
in the President's House. “Al-
though tha stnictui-e was pat.
terned after the Harvard Uni<
versity President's home, i
thought it was nicer,” said Mrs.
Nollen. “it had a certain
charm." That was fortunate baa
cause every guest lecturer,
speaker, or college administra<
tor was housed and entertained
in the President’s home. Often
the Noilens would entertain

in the Social Studies division,
the major innovation has been
the creation of the Social Stu-
dies course, a required 2-semes-
(er course which replaces last
year‘s Historical Studies

The Haveman Report has
caused the History Department
to consider the need tor more
basic courses in European his-
tory. Such courses are being
planned. The department has
also dropped the required senior
leminar and increased the num»
ber of seminars open to Juniors.
{this semester, seminars on
Imperialism are being oilered.
Next semester the topics are
urban problems and modem
Russia. Other trends in the (le-
partment include presenting
courses with language work, and
increasing course work in Afro-
American history.

The American Studies Depart-
ment has stopped requiring that
majors take courses in an, phi-
losophy, and sociology. instead,
American Studies majors will
take upper division general edu-
cation courses in areas other
than American Studies.

Mn Nichols, a guest professor
next semester, will teach two
courses in Alrookmerican lit<
erature, which may become per-
manent parts of the curriculum.

The newest development in
the Anthropology Department
next semester will be the course
“Anthropology of the Soviet
Union and Satellites.”

Other changes brought about
by the Haveman Report have
been more subtle. In many
courses, emphasis has been
shifted as a result of the com-
mittee's work. It has been
looked upon by many iaculty
members as a mandate to
Iearch for new ways of pre-
[renting course material and
Ideas.

By JONATHAN JENKINS

The six private dining rooms
in the Forum which seat from
four to twenty people may be
reserved by campus organiza
tions, committees, and other
student or faculty groups for
lunch or dinner, Monday
through Friday, and may be
used for small group meetings
as well as tor dining. Adjoining
the dining rooms are two kitch-
enettes which students may re-
serve to prepare their own din—
hers.

Mrs. Hawk, the Forum direc-
tor, said that both the kitchen-
ettes and the dining rooms were
being used more than ever this
year. The private dining rooms
are used by the Student Allairs
committee, by dormitories that
invite faculty members and
their wives to have dinner with
them, by the ﬁnance commit-
tee, by such groups as the
Y.R.’s, Lhe Y.D.’s, the Grinnell
College Christian Fellowship,
as well as the Friars, the MM-
tar anrd, and AWS. They are
also used for discussion groups
who wish to meet with guest
speakers or lecturers, and ac-
casionally tor bridge lessons in
the evening.

Students use the kitchenettes
frequently for making dinners
with dates, and for small
parties; a few use them simply
for baking. 0n the whole, they
seem to enjoy rising them and
find them very well equipped.

One of the complaints that
students have concerns the lack
or privacy in the kitchenettes.
There is a rule that when the

‘

Carleton

Labor and management are
negotiating their ﬁrst contract
at Carleton College this year.
The non-student service em-
ployees ot the college voted to
ulllanize last month, and have
presented their tirst demands.
The position or the college is
that it granted generous wage
increases at the start of the
year and the budget lor the lis-
cal year is already set. The
union reportedly is seeking in»
creases in wages of up to forty
percent.

kitchenettes are in use. the our»
tains may not be pulled. Even
it they were closed, they are,
according to one student, like
a Iishrnet, so that it is possible
to see through them. Several
students brought this problem
111); one girl said that the
kitchenette: are “like small
ﬁshbowls which everyone can
see in.” The only other toult
which was found with them was
the ﬁve dollar deposit Which is
required betore students may
use the kitchenettes. One stu-
dent telt that there should be
some other way to get students
who have broken something to
pay.

The private dining rooms and
hitchenettes seem to be serving
a purpose in providing not only
a place where students can
meet with other students and
faculty members, but also a
place where various organiza-
tions can get together. They are
quite popular; however, it
seems that their success would
be even greater if more privacy
could be provided.

a
Bio Field Named

For Emeritus Prof.

Grinnell College‘s new biol‘
ogy lieid laboratory has been
named the Henry 5. Coriard
Environmental Research Area.

The College's Board of Trus-
tees selected the name at its
fall meeting November 2 in
honor of a 94-yearrold Grinnell
professor emeritus of biology.
A member of the Grinnell lat)-
ulty for 39 years before retiring
to emeritus status in 1944, Dr.
Canard has an international
reputation as a biyologist (ex-
pert on mosses).

immediately after the take
over. the Executive Council of
Cornell’s Trustees met and di-
rected the President to expel
all the students involved in the
takeover. Cornell's taculty met
in the afternoon at the takeov-
er, and asked the Trustees to
change the punishment to sus-
pension, with each student giv-
en a chance to have a trial, Stu<
dents Involved in the case were
allowed to return to classes as
soon as their trials came up,
and no student missed more
than a week of classes. The
sum of the individual trials
lasted 81 hours over a six
week period, and were con-
cluded November 24.

Cornell Dean of Men Robert
Hooker told The Scarlet and
Black in a telephone interview
that the 73 Students involved in
the takeover were found guilty
of Violating the college's code

or dissent. According to Mr,
Hooker, this is an “action that
would normally warrant sus—
pension," bur, because at the
motives of this action. the sus-
pensions were suspended. The
students were placed on disch
plinary probation tor the rest
or this year. This means that
they cannot hold an oilice or
represent the college in any at-
ficial way during this time.
Disciplinary probation, how-
ever, ls temporary and will not

from talks with local ofﬁcials,
that unlawful assembly is the

guests ior breakiast, lunch, and
supper. They had a housekeep-
er wllo did most of the cooking,
but when it was very busy Mrs.
Nollen helped.

Among the visitors during the
Nollen administration was {or-
mer President Harry s. Tru-
man, then a Congressman. Mr.
Truman was awarded an honor
any degree by Grinnell College
_. the ﬁrst college degree he
had ever received. That degree
still hangs in the Harry s.
Truman Library in indepen-
dence. Missouri. Mr. Truman
again visited Grinnell a few
years ago as a P.P.P,E. lec-
turer and made a famous mis<
step on the porch oi Grinnell
House where he stayed. The
picture oi Mr. Truman iallen
in the shrubbery was carried
by national Wires.

Mrs. Nollen remembers dis-
tinctly another iamous guest
whom the Nollens entertained.
Rabbi Weiss, one of the found-
ing iathers oi lsrael, once Vis<
ited Grinnell with his daughter.
The meal which the Nollens
served was a sumptuous ham
dinner. “We'd completely tor-
gotten," said Mrs. Nollen. “The
interesting thing was that
Rabbi Weiss did eat the ham.
although his daughter reiused
graciously."

During its history, Grinnell
House has been the scene of
many recitals by Grinnell fae~
nlty members and several ia-
mous musicians. Mrs. Nollen
purchased the piano which
stands in the South Lounge 0!
the Forum for the house when

she lived there. Often, as many
as two hundred people would
enjoy the marvelous acoustical
properties or the home.

The Presidents who occupied
Grinnell House were John H.
T. Main, 1917-31; John S. Nai-
len, 1931-40; Samuel N. Stevens.
1940-54; and Howard Bowen,
195561. Belore 1917 Mr. Main
resided in the Little House, and
after 1961 Mr. Bowen lived In
the new Presidential house.

Since 1961, the Grinnell House
has served as a social center.
a concert hall, a meeting place
ior the Trustees, and a sleep-
ing quarters ior guests at the
college, including prospective
students. The guest register in
the {font lobby Contains the
names oi Barry Goldwater and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Grinnell House has more
memories imbedded in it than
these. It was also the private
home or the Presidents whose
personal memories do not be-
long, all or them, on these
pages. Perhaps someday some
one will write of the Grinnell
House as Maud Little Macy did
of the Little House when it was
razed in 1917. The iollowing ap<
peared in the Grinnell Herald
Register on March 16, 1917.

”When the walls or the ark
cient structure were laid law
last summer, and the deal-
home vanished utterly irom

pirations, and to some extent

worthy achievement imbedded

A New Government

Out of the turmoil of the past
few weeks, there have arisen some
good signs. Students have shown an
interest in the community, and despite
the excessiveness of their concern for
the open visitation issue, in many
cases they have seriously worked to
understand the problems involved,
and they have tried to create a live-
able situation in the dorms. One of the
areas which most captured their in-
terest and stimulated their imagina-
tions, and, perhaps, one of the most
educational benefits derived from the
experience was the formulating of
rules and regulations the hall would
accept, and the creation of judicial
councils to handle disputes.

Students have shown a genuine
interest in the procedures and
methods of government. The sit-
uation of Grinnell is perfect for en-
couraging these interests. We live in
a small community. We have here an
opportunity for experimentation in
governmental forms that we will nev-
er have again.

There are many kinds of govern-
ment. There are even many kinds in
which there can be popular elections
and degrees of freedom. The number
of students at Grinnell is small enough
so that there is no real need for a stu-
dent senate — for the many to be rep-
resented by a few. There is no reason
why there cannot be general assem-
blies in the gymnasium of all the
students. In ancient Greece, or in the
town meetings of New England this
kind of direct democracy worked well.
In this way more students could be-
come involved in the workings of stu-
dent government. Also, 5 t u d e n t 5
would not be able to complain that
they were not represented; they
would represent themselves.

Why stop here, though? We
ought to be bold innovators and
should not shy away from loftier ex»
periments and nobler constructions
than this one, A student comes to
Grinnell College for four years. Why
not experiment with four different
kinds of government? No student
would have to live under the same
system twice, and if the issues were to
become boring, at least the diversity
would be amusing, We might have a
‘direct democracy one year, an oligar-
chy the next year, a republican form
of government one year, and then per-
haps a monarchy or tyranny,

lege became the first in the country

Royal for x

to have a political science department.
Let us be the first college in the coun~
try to institute this rotating system of
government.

The college has already had ex-
perience in the shifting forms of stu—
dent government. The number of
members of the student senate seldom
remains the same for more than a
year. But this flux is only a small in-
dication of Grinnell’s great potential
for variation and modifications. Let
us combine the best qualities of a
stern rigidity and a permissive flexi-
bility. We could have a strong and
established form of government each
year, but that form could change from
year to year. Let us cast off the chains
of dull monotony; let us be free to
learn.

Students on Committees

This college is one of the most ad-
vanced in the country in providing a
curricular stability. The faculty has
been engaged in putting students on
faculty committees for a long time.
Now that the faculty has approved the
plan at their meeting, students will
soon help to establish policy on mat-
ters of curriculum. By giving students
partial responsibility for their curric-
ulum the college is protecting itself
from the disorders that have occurred
at such places as Berkeley, when stu-
dents insisted they be given credit for
courses w h o s e significance was
doubted by college administrators.

There is a pattern to the disorders
caused by the demands of students.
First they ask for social freedom, as
they have done here at Grinnell; then
they move into other areas, such as
curriculum, By putting students on
the educational policy committees,
Grinnell will likely be spared those
disorders known to Berkeley. While
attending meetings of these commit-
tees students will feel that they are
actually influencing the curriculum.
Of course, things will not change
much, for students will easily be
persuaded to the professors’ point
of View, and besides, we will proba‘
bly choose only the most responsible
students to go on the committees, and
everybody knows that responsible
people are those with the fewest in-
novative or imaginative ideas.

More good than had will result
from the college’s new policy. Stu-
dents may not do much good for the
curriculum, but it will keep them off
the streets, and when students are
doing committee work, they cannot be
having illegal open dorms.

letters to the Editor

Rolhsteln Reveal:

2nd Stump Abortion

To the Editor:

After having read only the
first four paragraphs of Mr.
Stump’s latest intellectual abor-
tlon, l have again been moved
to write in protest. Normally,
I would not become involved
whh the question of opens, but
since our journalistic Diogenes
has resorted in his tactic of
Calling in [he “universals,” I
feel that the larger issues are
worth commenting upon. Slump
makes three basic assumplions
ln llls first four paragraphs, all
of which I find questionable, to
say the least.

First, he assumes that given
freedom, the students will mis-
use it. (“How can giving cul-
prits something widely desired
by students be anything but an
Incentive to break the rules?”)
Aside from the fact that I re
sent being considered a culprit.
I find Stump’s assumption of
basic evil as the prime compo
nent of students’ souls some
what amusing, After all, is not
he a student also? One can only
lnfer that Mr. Stump knows
that he would misuse what he
considers a privilege. Perhaps
he should be sent back for four-
more years of high school un-
tll he ls adult enough to handla
responsibility.

Second, Stump assumes that
If the dorms were allowed to
establish their own degree of
opens, students will naturally
differentiate among them In
terms of “sophistication.” It
then follows that those students
who just don’t care to live in
dorms with relatively large
amounts of time for opens will
still feel pressured socially into
living in them, Two obvious
points will refute this. On the
one hand, there is presently no
mass exodus to off-campus
apartments, which are in es-
sentially the same position as
dorms with 24 hour opens. on
the other hand, limitations on
vacancies will create a perfect-
1y plausible excuse for not be-
ing in one of these dorms —
there just wasn't enough room
for everyone. Should it lhen be
argued that these people will
nevertheless feel forced to es-
tablish more dorms with more
opens? I ask, “Should the so-
cially responsible people on
campus be forced to live under
conditions imposed by such
gutless worms, people so im-
mature that they cannot even
stick by what they feel ls
right?”

”If Dr. Leggett does not
come up with a reason why
the principle holds for soclal
rules and not academic policies,
the faculty ought to ask for his
head. . .” It may surprise Ml'.
Stump that there do exist col~
19395 that do not have any
dorms. A college is not a domi-
oils for socially backward in-
fants, The halls are here be-
cause there Is no other housing
to accommodate the students
and because the Administra-
tlon had wanted to exercise
some control over students. Not
all colleges have accepted this
attitude as being inherent to
the institution. C.C.N.Y. has no
dorms; the University of
Hawaii has almost none; I

have been told that LeMoym
College, with which we have an
exchange program, has no
dorms elther. Columbia has
just done away with all limita-
tions on visitations.

In answer to Stump’s last
question, I feel that a society
in which all truth is absolute is
a society of automatons »—<
computerized carcasses that
can do nothing new because
everything is already pre~
scribed. Such narrowed living
is anathema to liberal educa-
tion, and vice versa. You who
are reading this letter might
well ponder whether you came
here for a liberal education or
just some more of that old
horsedung dogma that you are
incapable of reason and fit only
for some little cubicle in which
you will be protected from any
contamination that exists
“elsewhere" in society.

To the Edllorl

Criticism of a enticlsm -
fn answer to Mr. Paul Roth-
mans’ reaction to Les Dnnseurs
AIrlcalns’ performance, I feel
he was expecting a sort of Ho!-
lywood type of performance on
the part of the people who were
involved. I am grateful that
these young and enthusiastic
amateurs were just what I ex-
pected even before reading the
informative programme. The
tribal dances they performed
were in existence long before
the word “Black Power" came
into being. Some of them prob-
ably go back as m as the
time the American Indian was
“the American,” period! The
audience must have felt the
same way this writer felt and
reacted to the endeavors of the
performers.

To look down one's nose at
this type of genuine and accu-
rate, it at times, not quite pro-
Iessional performance is not
necessarily a proof of being so<
phisficated or learned; it can
be a shortcoming, too.

Dancer Review Myths

Tn the Editor:

I was very amused and some-
what piqued that a while stu-
dent, apparently very misin-
formed and/or ignorant of
West African culture, could ele-
vate himself to the position of
African dance critic, We are
currently studying The Myih of
the Negro Past in Intercultural
House and Mr. Rothman's
judgments about Les Dameum
Africains are very similar to
those of numerous armchair
anthropologists who would con-
sign all Black culture to the
dungheap of vulgarity and in-
significance. Mr. Rothman evi-
dently has solid pie-conceptions
of What African dance should
be, and I can’t quite under-
stand where he derives his ab-
solute standard of comparison.
Is there an absolute of agility or
clumslness against which all

lancers are measured or are
they each culturally deter-
mined? And has it ever oo-
cuned to him that these Afri-
can dancers are not aiming for
the snappy. almost artificial
precision and coordination
characterized by popularized
American modem dancers such
as the June Taylor Dancers,
the Rockettes, etc? The Atria
can dances are more spontane-
nus and oriented toward indi-
vidual or group expressiveness
and entire involvement. They
aren’t “choreographed" in the
American sense of the word.

I choked at Mr. Rothman's
hidlcrous comparison of these
dancers with the Brotherhood
cheerleaders. Get it straight.
Iweetheart, that we Black
Americans are descendants of
Africans, not vice-versa, alld
although we Blacks have re-
tained general modes of kinesic
behavior from Africans, they
are expressed lll different ways
(different types of dancing),
For example, American Black
d a n c e is basically social,
whereas authentic A l ri c a n
dance is basically social, ritual-
istic, and communicative. So
how can Mr. Rothman compare
them? Most young Blacks re-
vere African dancing to the ex-
tent that a black who can do
African dances is highly re-
spected for his skill and agility.
Also, African music is becom-
ing even more a source of in-
spiration for Black jazz, blues,
and rhythm and blues musi-
eians.

With respect to their alleged
obsequiousness, how can Mr.
Rothman compare them with
descendants of slaves who are
oppressed economically, social-
ly, politically and hitherto spir-
itually by a white majority?
In West Africa, remember,
Blacks are a majority, and the
rulers. They aren't former
llaves who’ve been "brain~
washed” and left to wrestle
with and overcome a selfrde-
basing slave mentality. There-
fore, the phrase, “Uncle Tom"
is inapplicable to them.

There are so many state-
ments in Mr. Rothman's article
that show his ignorance about
Black culture, American or Af-

rican, that it is useless for me
to continue my criticism. But
I find it amusing that Mr. Roth-
man, a part of the sterile, ra—
tlonal, emotionally detached.
scientific “white" American
culture can accuse African
dancers, the masters of “body
celebrationists” (see Urban
Blues), of halt-heartedness, and
of simple choreography. In
other words, Mr. Rothman,
make sure you shed your own
cultural bias before you at-
tempt to evaluate the artifact
of another culture,

Bids Dancer Critic
Take Anthro Lesson

To the Editor:

I trust 1 am not the only one
who, after seeing Les Danseurs
Africains weekend before last
in Roberts Theatre, was as-
tounded by the approach and
tone of Mr. Rothman’s review
of the performance in the No-
vember 29th issue of The Scar-
let and Black, Normally 1 con.
sider critical reviews of an art
form to be only matters of
opinion and hardly worth de-
bate. Art for me is an individ-
ual experience; the same work,
be it drama, music or litera-
ture, can evoke different
thoughts from different people.
Some people have their
thoughts dignified by appearing
in print, 1 let it go at that.
However, the review was in a
profound sense so unusual that
other past precedents must be
set aside also, and I am re-
sponding to its

We are at a liberal arts in-
stitution. This gives us license
to exchange our lessons. I
would like Mr. Rothman to take
an obviously much-needed les-
son frcm anthropology. One of
the basic tenets of this wide-
ranging discipline is that of
“cultural relativism." It states
that a person’s behavior and
thought are to a very great ex-
tent a product of his cultural
environment. His attitudes, be-
llefs, mannerisms and ways of
life are prescribed for him by
his culture. The process is
called "enculturation." It. is
wrong, therefore, for a person
of one cultural heritage to criti-

cize the culturally conditioned
behavior of a “foreigner” -— it
smacks of ethnocentrism. Mr.
Rothman was not being cultur-
ally relativistic. He was judg-
ing ceremonial performances
of an African people by stand-
ards he apparently picked up
from Broadway critics. He de-
scribes the music as "lifeless,"
the choreography as “trite,”
the heats as “primitive," the
bare-breast performance as
"salacious exploitation of tie
sires” H this is utterly fantas-
ticl it really is. My first re
action was a laugh of incredul-
lty, then a snort of incredulity,
then a realization that the critic
was serious and desperately in
need of some criticism himself.

Related to his lack of cul-
tural relativity was Mr. Roth-
man's placement of all blacks
in the same cultural bag. He
failed to distinguish between
the meaning of black American
and black African. 1 accuse
him of this because of his ref-
erence to the “Uncle Tom dis-
position" of the ensemble. Mr.
Rothman failed to realize that
the same action performed by
a black American and a black
African wniild very probably
have different meanings and
implications. The behavior of
a black American which might
be construed as Tomvism is not
necessarily Tomrism when done
by a black African.

1 could go on but my points
would begin to sound the same,
due, i suspect, to the fact that
all the shortcomings of the re—
view were manitestatlons of the
same basic fault: a lack of un—
derstanding of the term “cul-
ture.” I wish Mr. Rothman well
in his further critical evalua-
tions of campus events, but
suggest that either he stick to
American productions or read

Orchestra Concert 'Uneven'

By MELISSA HAYS

Paul Zonn, conductor of the Grinnell College Orchestra, de-
manded more of his players last Saturday night than they were
able to handle — for the program included Bartuk’s Viola Con<
eerie and Brahm's Second Symphony.

The concert started with a sonatine by Devienne. The playing
of this piece for strings alone was, for the most part, merely
pleasant — the violins’ tone was sometimes harsh, while the
cellos were unnecessarily restrained.

Many concertrgoers may have wondered about the selection
of the Devienne composition. This rather innocuous piece was
neither difficult to perform nor to understand. Perhaps the lack
of technical problems made this a desirable piece to have on an
otherwise strenuous program. Although there were no memorable
moments of excitement in this number, there were enough thrills
in the remainder of the concert to compensate for this blandness.
And certainly Zonn cannot be accused of selecting old watcherses
for performance. The opportunity to hear or to play the compo-
sitions of obscure composers belongs almost exclusively to college
orchestras and their audiences.

The Bartok Viola Concerto is n difficult piece for both soloist
and orchestra. The viollst, Paul Hersh, played his part flawlessly,
and the orchestra had its good moments. At times, however, the
lack of unity in the orchestra drew attention away from the

soloist (particularly in the allegro when the winds consistently
lagged behind). Although the entrances of various sections ot
the orchestra were sometimes careless and haphazard, at the
moments when the dramatic tension was the highest, their attacks
were clean and precise. In much of the concerto many of the
sections of the orchestra have parts distinct from each other in
rhythm and general character, each of which must be brought
out, but not to the point where one overpowers another. That
these parts were somewhat muddled cannot be strongly con-
demned, for achieving the periect balance would be difficult even
for a professional orchestra. Overlooking occasional and expected
sour notes, the Small 5010 parts assigned to individual wind
players were played sensitively, picking up the tone and mood
established by the viola soloist,

I had expected the Brahms to be the weakest number on the
program, for not only is it a difficult piece of music, but there
was no brilliant soloist to give it interest. I was pleasantly sur-
prised, then, that the symphony was the best performed number
of the concert. The tone of the strings was better than it had
been previously, and almost made up for the sometimes stumbling
brass section. in the first movement, an attempt was made to
create a hushed, expectant mood, but the result was rather thin
and lifeless. The second movement was stronger, however, and
the cellos, which throughout the concert seemed to be the most
uniiied section, reached their highest intensity in this movement.
The sprightly parts of the third movement were played With
just the right amount of vigor, and the contrasting, more solemn
parts were played with as much sensitivity. The final movement
was an energetic close to a sometimes uneven performance.

Leggett Proposal
Termed Contradictory

To the Editor:

One of the several points both»
ering me about President Leg-
gett’s statement on dormitory
regulations is the limit placed
on the number of hours of opens
per week. I fully agree with
Dr. Leggett on the need for a
specified and consistent period
of time in which the hallways of
a dorm are to be closed to mem—
bers of the opposite sex (the
rooms themselves are another
question altogether), but why
then restrict the number of

He seems to be contradicting
himself—he is saying that the
hall is permitted to be open be-
tween 8 am. and 12 midnight
on weekdays, and 3 am. and 2
am. on weekends, yet he limits
the number of hours Within that
period. He is arbitrarily limit-
ing the hours for a hall after
allowing them to be open in the
first place! Why not place a
limit on the amount of time
the hall is allowed to be
opened (which he already has)
and then allow the hall to de-
termine how much it will be
open within that open period?
What sense is there in open-
ing the dorms for either
16 or 18 hours. and then clos.ng
them again by allowing only 12
hours of opens a day? Why al-
low only 34 hours of opens? lea
the halls the option to be open
all the time not specifically
closed by Dr. Leggett. Be con-
sistent, Dr. Leggett.

.Varsiiy Sandbag Frosh 72-25;
Rollins Sets New Free Record

By CLIFFORD FROLICH

In the annual Freshman-Var-
llty Swimming Meet held at
Grinneil on Friday, November
29, the varsity sandbagged the
:reshmen by a score of 72 to

5.

Bruce Rollins of the varsity
Won three events, and set a
new Grinnell record in the 200
free with a time at 1255.3. The
old record of 156.2 was set last
year by John MeBlain, who
also swam in Friday's race
against Rollins, but placed
third.

The results of the meet bode
well for the team this year.
The winning varsity times in
the 100 free, the 200 free, the
individual medley, and the hut<
terily were as good or better
t h a n Grinneil’s mid-season
times of a year ago, and the
varsity had three divers score
more than 160 points. For the
freshmen, Mike Daley, who
won the 500 free, and Steve
Ward, who won the breast-
stroke, both beat veteran var-
rity swimmers; while John
Weins, in the butterfly, and
Ward, in the individual med-
ley, nearly won their respec-
tive events, but ultimately tin-
ished second in excellent times.

Generally, the Grinnell swim
teams look very strong. and
times seem exceedingly fast
tor this early in the season.

Freshmen Lose to Varsity 85—49
After ’Suove’ Defense Fails

' ’As the semester draws to a
close. the winter sports at Grin-
nell make their debut. Novem—
ber 30 will be remembered a:
the gala event of the opening
winter season. Darby gym host-
ed the lighting Grinneil Varsity
basketball team and their op-
ponents, the fetal frosh. The
audience was able to get a sneak

review or not only the viva<
pious jocks but also the peppy
oheerieaders who led the great
Ipirit which undulated from the
midst of the multitude who wit-
nessed the game.

The first half showed the pos-
Iibiiities of a strong freshman
team this year. They hit 39%
from the floor and held the var-
aity down to only 36%. Coach
Boyd stated that if the trash
play the entile season like they

layed during the first half, the

e a m may be conference
champs.

if we look at the second half,
however, is different Christmas
light shines on our stars.

Coach Pfitsch‘s varsity began
laying an oiiensive game.
.1 hey successfully shot 70% irom
the court. The fresh completely
test their suave defense. The
. arsity appeared to be going
through their pregame warm-

ups as one player would score
with a lay-up, another would
rebound and hand the ball off
to another player for a lay-up.

For the varsity, Evenson was
top scorer totaling 12 whole
points, This feat was accom-
plished by making a out of a
field goal attempts. wingate.
Pederson, and Hanson each
scored 10 points. The entire
team saw some action during
the game and produced a val<
iant team effort. High scorers
for the frosh were Meyer, with
14 points, Hirsch, with 3 points,
and Gilbert with 6. The fresh
showed a definite inability
to hit successfully as the min-
utes flew by. In the second half,
the team hit only 14% of their
attempts. Hirsch made 3 out of
11 attempts, Gilbert 3 out or
9, Meyer 6 out of 15 (yeai) and
Jordan 2 out n! 7.

l-lalitime found the Varsity
leading 3629, and the final score
gave the varsity as points and
the fresh 49.

The varsity, however, will see
action this coming weekend in
Chicago, and the fresh won't
see conference action until late
in January. Is the Varsity ready
for VarSlty ball??? Will the
trash improve by 69”}

as the most valuable mem-
ber of Grinnell College’s 1968
varsity cross country team.

sett, were selected as the
most improved varsity dis-
tancemen.

Blades Tie Hawks
2—2 For Second
Straight Draw

The Grinnell Blades and the
Des Moines ice Hawks battled
to s 2.2 tie last Sunday at the
Des Moines Ice Arena, The Zip<
py Line of Tom Jackson, Bruce
Graham, and Mike Schaffer ac
counted for both Grinnell goals.

Both teams Were evenly
matched in the first period;
each had a total of six ShotsVon-
goal. With four minutes left in
the period, the Blades tallled the
game's first goal. Captain-Coach
Mike Schaifer chased the puck
behind the Des Moines goal
and red is pass to Leit Wing
Bruce Graham who was charg-
ing the net. Graham's shot was
blocked by the goal tender but
Schafter back-handed the re-
bound into the net,

Des Moines evened the game
at 1-1 with only a minute left in
the first period. in a scramble
in front of the Grinnell net. the
Ice Hawks pushed the puck by.

By outshooting Des Moirles ll-
4 in the second period, Grinnell
started to take command of
the game. But one of Des
Moines' shots bounced off Sigel'l
shoulder and into the net to give
the Ice Hawks in 2-1 advantage.
Two minutes later, Grinnell's
Tom Jackson intercepted :1 Des
Moines pass end skated on the
Des Mnines goal tender home
free. He fired a 15 foot shot be-
tween the goal tender'e legs to
knot this score at 2-2.

Grinnell dominated the third
period but could not score a goal
on account of the excellent play
of the Ice Hawks’ goal tender,
a former Des Moines Oak Leafs
goal tender. The second line of
Ruhe, Crandall, and Flaten and
the third line of Phelps, Much-
more, and Hemingway could
not add to the two goals of the
Zippy Line, The ice Hawks did
not have a shot on the Grinneii
goal during the iinal period.

The Blades outshor Des
Moines two-Leone. The ice
Hawks' goal tender stopped 24
Grinnell shots while Ken Slgel
blocked eleven pucks.

Greater Size, Depfll Bode Well ;
For Basketball Team This Year

By JEFF conzarr

On December 7. the Grinneli
College Pioneers will put on the
court the best basketball team
we have had in years. The two
reasons for this year's inn
proved Pioneer squad are the
increased size of the players
and a greater depth of person
nei.

For the first time in several
seasons the Pioneers will have
several players taller than as.
Accompanying Terry Holloway
will be 6—7 Greg Beckman, 8-6
Scott Henson, 8-4 Quinton Pheh,
and 64 Gary Dukes. All four
players are fine shooterl and
passers, and play good defense.
Furthermore, all four are
sophomores; so we can look
forward to three years of good
basketball.

As for depth, the presence of
senior Henry Wingete and
sophomores Gary Johnson and
Brian Carroll will let Coach
Pfitsch field two equal teams.
These two factors plus the re
turn of Thor Evenson, Whitey
Christensen, Don Peterson, and
three other lettermen leads
Coach Pfitsch to believe that
the loss of Mike Swariz, the
conference's fourth leading
scorer, will not be crippling.

Because of the team's greater
height and depth, the Pioneers
will change their style of has-

ketball to a form of fast break
end a pressing defense. Another
result of the team: changed
complexion will be more No
bounds and better shooting.

Despite these improvements,
the Pioneers will still have
trouble improving their confen
ence record because the Mid-
west Conference is the toughest
it has been in years. Beioit, last
year's champion, is favored to
repeat with Cornell and Mons
mouth, last year's second place
teams, lighting Beloit for the
top. St. Olaf, last year’s third
place finisher, and Knox are
expected to be the other top
contenders. Coe or Carleton il
picked to be the conference
derkhorse. The experts' pres
season pick for Grinnell is last
place.

Coach Piitsch neverthelesl
believe: the pro-season {om
cast is wrong for several rea-
sons. The first is that the rest
of the conference does not know
of the return of Henry Wingate
or of the addition of the strong
sophomore crop. Lastly. Coach
Pfitsch has declared that the
Pioneers’ team play and em
thusiasm are much better this
year. If the team keeps im<
proving as it has, we can look
for at least a first division ﬁne
lsh, and maybe higher. Regard-
less, we will certainly surprise
a lot of teams this year.

 

SWIMMERS EXORIATE COE 72—22

On Wednesday, December 4,
the Grinnell swimming team
excol'ieted Coo College 72 to 22.
Coo won only two events.

The outstanding performer
of the meet was again Bruce
Rollins, who broke one school
record and tied another. in the
60 free. Rollins' time of 28.0
seconds bettered the oldest ex<
isting Grinnell swimming rec‘
old, 28,2. set by Norman in
1960. in the 100 free, Rollim
tied his own record of 50.3 Seth
ands, set last year.

Another swimmer for record.
hungry rare to watch is Dan
Meyer, whose time or 1:44] in
H13 individual medley missed
the Grinnell record by only it
tenth of a second.

On Saturday, December a,
both freshmen and varsity
swimmers will travel to Gales<
burg, liiinois to compete in the
annual Knox Relays.
