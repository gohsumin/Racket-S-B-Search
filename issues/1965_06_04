Education Inquiry,
Burkle Tells Grads

“Education is not salvation,
but inquiry," Grinnell seniors
were told at Baccalaureate
services in Darby Gymnasium
last night.

The speaker was Howard R.
Burkle (philosophy and relig—
ion), who delivered the Bacca-
laureate sermon, “When Moun-
tains Are Again Mountains,"

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Howard Burkle

before more than 1,000 seniors,
parents, alumni, and other
friends of the college.

“Education is a process oc~
curring within a community of
dialogue" Burkle said. “It is
inclusive of all different shades
of opinion, It encourages dis-
sent, it prizes the sort of scepti-
cism which searches for shal-
lowness, provinciality and spe-
cious argumen ."

He continued: “Education is
open to every alternative and,
in a certain sense, continuinglyi
impartial before them. Even
when it has arrived at a con-
clusion, it remains sensitive to
new evidence and is prepared
to open up the case again, The
student, as opposed to the be-
liever, never totally surrenders
himself to his conclusions."

As French House Disappears — So Does Le Fee

student” who has acted as head»
resident at French House for the
past two years.

A native oi France, Miss LeFee
was born in Montlucon, an indus-
trial city at about 60,000,

Miss LeFee obtained a “License.
d’anglals" degree in 1963. The Li-
cenSe-d'zlnglais qualiﬁes her as an
English teacher in any French sec-
ondary school. Although compari-
sons are awkward, the License—
(le'anglais is roughly equivalent in
an American MA. degree. Though
she carries a typical Iohour class
schedule at Grinnell, most at the
courses are taken as "audits.”

The system oi higher education
in France is completely diiierent

and are presented with degrees or

SCARLET AND BLACK

Seniors leave Different famous;
(lounges Seen As Striking, Solitle

By Sue Taylor

When the class of 1965 came to
Grinnell as eager, naive freshman
in the fall of 1961, we came to a
different campus from the one we
will leave nus afternoon.

The campus looked different and
it lelt different. Some oi the
changes have been the kind that
jump out and hit you in the face,
but some of them are more subtle.

The face of the campus has
changed. The fine arts building
and Roberts Theatre were new
when we arrived. Barber Plaza

was completed that first year —
if Il'S ever been completed. The
library was just one year old —
and the science building didn‘t
have its addition _ even partially
finished.

And the Forum wasn’t here. We
were the first class [D live in three
unions. First there was the old
barracks —< We liked its “Warm"
atmosphere and its sentimental
memories. Then there was Main
hall basement. That, too, has its
memories.

But this year saw the opening
of a new millinnrdollar building
for the union—rat. We adjusted
quickly.

But it the new soon becomes fa-
miliar, there are some old things
that this class knew. Perhaps we
are dated because we really knew
Duane Frankhouse not just
heard about him. But we also knew
the era that he stood for. And it’s
an era that we have seen pass
from the scene.

Maybe it was more of a feeling
— an atmosphere, an attitude.
But it's no more.

Maybe it was enthusiasm. May
be it was just being able to have
fun — and have it wrtltout trying.
Perhaps it. \vas knowing how to

 

taught. because that’s not some-
thing you learn in school.

Our freshman year, there was a
student variety show — complete
with legs contest and a twist con-
lest # and now the twist is so out
dated that it takes courage to do it
in public.

We saw the beginning of liquor-
by~tlieri'oom, and the new permanr
ent openrhouse policy as opposed
to the Various “trial” programs of
open dorms and open moms.

And we are really dated by be-
ing able to say that we celebrated
our 2lst birthdays at the old Rex.

We Witnessed the entire life of
the Ford Foundation grant and its
matching fund. The years of our
Ford were the brunt of several
jokes, but they also brought in
$6,000,000.

There were four years of activi—

ties in politics — both kinds. Stu-‘

dent government had just been re—
organized when we came to in-
clude something new—the student
senate. And this spring witnessed
its death — and the advent of the
advisory council — just half as
much. So go cycles.

And in the world of real politics
— well, a lot happened. The names
of Humphrey. Goldwater, Truman.
Eisenhower, and others graced the
campus. The PPPE saw its great
momenu.

Our freshman year was the first
quasi-legal spring riot. This year
may have been the last spring riot
— legal or otherwise

There were changes in academia.
too. The JLA, and interim came
and went. R. R. Palmer’s History
of the Weslem World Went and
came.

We've seen the coming of a new
dean of men and a new dean of
women — and we’ve been through
the end of the term of a president.

These were years of social con.
scmusness on campus a years of
concern with the movements which
have captured the imagination of

take the tianot having to be . young people all over the nation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One of the more popular relreais from the world of the
academic is the Forum's plush green pool mom — and a.

A lot of new things have hap-
pened on campus since we came.
A lot of growth has gone on. A lot
oi progress has been made.

But there is something missing
that was here when we came.
Maybe it’s a life style. It's some-
thing that has to do with knowing
how [D have fun. It's a kind of iris
formality that just happens — it
isn‘t planned. Maybe now there is
more “inlori'nality” — fewer tra-
ditions more activities. But
there is a spirit, an attitude, an
atmosphere that isn't here any
more, And it’s too bad.

This afternoon the class of '65
is leaving. It’s too early to de-
termine whether we've left our

Award Him ’Chuir’

Sines 1959 c. Edwin Gilmnnr
(political science) has been hand-
ing not black and gold captain's
chairs to politicians in residence,
each with appropriately engraved
gold plaques on them.

Fourteen students, mostly sen-
iors, finally turned the tables (or
chairs as it were) and presented
Gilmour with a chair of his own.

The chair, presented on May 20,
is black and gold, is a captain’s
chair, and has the engraved, gold
plaque. The plaque reads:

“To Dr. c. E. Gilmour. Director
PPPE, 1959455.”

The chair was presented by his
eX-sludenls in appreciation of his
work in the PPFE.

In Strong Spring Sports Finish

Sparkling individual perform»
ances in all sports pushed Griniiell
to its best spring season in sev-
eral years.

With John TePaske and Ted Ris~
ser showing the way, the Grinnell
track and golf teams copped can
i e r e n c e championships. Mike
Greenfield was top pointmaker as
the Pioneer tennis team placed a
surprising second in the loop meet
anti the strong-armed pitching of
Dennis Hanssen carried the base-
ball nine to third place in the
Southern Division standings,

TRACK

TePaske had a hand in is of the
44 points as the Pioneers edged out
Carleton by two markers to claim
their fourth consecutive league
crown. The Pioneer captain set
both a new league and Grinnell
record of l:54.5 in winning the 880,
also set the pace in the 440, and
placed fifth in the broad jump.

Then he anchored Grinnell's mile
relay team home first in the meet’s
final event to give the track team
the five points they needed to cap-
ture the championship.

This performance capped an out-
standing season, for TePaske, He
scored points in seven‘differeiit'
events during the campaign and
collected a suitcase full of first
place ribbons and trophies.

Other consistent pointmakers
were Mike DeWitt, hurdles and re-
lays; Steve Erinmal], middle dlSr
tance and relays; Paul Patterson
and Bob Dyer, both distance and
relays; Bob Watt, sprints and re-_
lays; Clyde Smith, high jump and
relays; Tom Wood, iavelin and

For the season, Greeniield’s 7—3

the plus side of .500,

In doubles play, Greenfield and

Forty years ago, Morganl

He held the dim-meter mark

the conclusion of a story he

cerns the visit to a monas-
tery by several Grinneli stu<

Latin America. Asked by one
of the Grinnell students wheth-
er an exchange program be»
tween Grinnell and Conception
would be possible he replied
that it could be considered. This
proposal, actively supported by

outs at Boston, capturing the
400»meter event in a new world
record time of 52.0 seconds,
1.4 seconds under the recog-
nized mark,

At the Olympics, Taylor cop-1
pad the United States’ first
1924 track gold medal, winningl
by l0 yards despite knockingl
over one hurdle. He matched
his 5Z.h world record time and
wrote a new Olympic stander
al‘d.

Returning to Grinnell, Taylor
completed his Pioneer career'
in the spring of i025, starting
as a broad jumper, dashman,
and hr'gh jumper as well as a
hurdler.

The world 440yard hurdle
record came in 1925 at the nae
Lional AAU meet, the ﬁnal
event of the season, Taylor’s
53.8 clocking clipped three»
tenths off the old standard thal-
liad stood for five years.

Taylor continued his hurdling
career for seven more years,
represented the U. S. at two
more Olympics, and became
the first American trackman
to win three Olympic medals.
He placed third in the 400~meter
event at Amsterdam in 1928 and
was again third in l932 at Los
Angeles despite running with a
bad leg.

nell in 1926 as an English major

After spending a comfortablel

a brief attendance at morning‘
services and a good bl'eaklast,i
the group listened to a lecture‘
on the history and goals of "IONA
asticism by the NovicerMnsteru
Father Alexander. The ideal of
the monastic life is summar-
ized in St, Paul's appeal, “ii-ni-

poor; He did not marry; He}
gave ultimate obedience to His‘
Father; He spent a long period
in contemplation in the desen,
and depended greatly on pray»‘

the later spiritual commuiiiryi
