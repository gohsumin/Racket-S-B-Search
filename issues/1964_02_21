Jags and Juniors Converge Upon Convention

The current week has been-
one of political concentration
on campus issues and consider-
ation toward a future campus
leader, Tomorrow’s convention
will demand the serious atten-
tion of the student body for the
purpose of selecting the final
candidates for SGA president.

But a convention would be
both long and dull without the
folly produced by the “not-so-
serious” mind. For this reason
Grinnell students welcome the

.platforms and the antics of the
jag candidates.

Perhaps the most serious jag
candidate of them all was
~"Binky" Barnes, who was run-
ning in 1943. Barnes was a ser-
lous contender for president un-
til it was disCovered that he
was one credit hour short of be-
Ing eligible for office.

Sixteen years later a group
known by the mysterious ini-
tials DFVA announced, “We,
the members of the DFVA,
feel the need of an absolute

dictatorship.” Working under
the banner of the crescent and
wrench, tho DFVA advocated
appointment of all officers by
their leader known only as
-“Big Daddy.”

The year 1957 had a bumper
crop of jag candidates, 16 in
all; but back in is“ a more
unusual thing happened. Out of
10 presidential candidates only
one was male.

Perhaps the most famous jag ‘

1959. His campaign manager
reasoned, “If Mr. Gary Cooper

beat out Oberlin for first place
in the Chicago Tribune’s ‘Rank

However, Cooper declined
graciously in a telegram to the

Pictured above during final rehearsals for "Tidings Brought to Mary." are Gretchen Geyer
and Ken Freedman who will have leading roles in the performances this weekend by

lhe Grinnell Players.

Production ‘Both Human and Supernatural Drama'

Two incongruous s i s t e r s,
sweet Violaina (Gretchen Gey-
er) and jealous Mara (Susan
Monto), will command the at-
tention of local armchair t’hes-

pians Saturday and Sunday
nights when the Grinnell Col-
lege Players present the French
liturgical play, by Paul Claudel,
“The Tidings B r o u g h I To
Mary," iii-Roberts Theatre.
The action of the production,
translated into English by Wal—
lace Fowlie, revolves around
the relationship between the
two sisters, Violaine and Mara,
who are' totally different in
temperament and yet who are
indissolubly joined. Violaine is
the good sister who represents
Christian Charity in its fullest
sense. Mara, whose name
means “bitter" in Hebrew, is
the violently jealous sister who
becomes a murderess.
Claudel’s circumspect and
sensitive development of the re-

lationship between these sis-
ters helps to make “The Tid-
ings Brought To Mary" E hue
man and supernatural drama
at the same time.

Included in the small cast are
Keith Felton as Jacques, Ken
Freedman as Pierre, Sue Early
as the mother. Terence McCoy
as the father, and Karen Hardy,
Robin Kornkow, Ariane Sylva,
Howard Harned and Nan Dona—
hoe as the Woods People.

Claudel w o r k e d, reworked
and. revised this play innumer-
able times over a period of 56
years before its final version
was produced on the stage, The
first version was published in
1892, but it wasn’t until 1948
when the definItive Version used
by the Grinnell Players was fin-
ished. According to Claude] it
was ”the work I was the most
attached to, the one for which
I had the most constant afteCA
tion.”

conservatives Gather,
Form Discussion Group

Last Sunday an organization-
al meeting of the Grinnell Col-
lege Conservative Discussion
Group was held in the Burling
Library viewing room.

Led by Robin Converse, the
organization is intended as a
means by which conservatives
can gather to discuss issues
that might divide the liberal
and conservative. Likely topics
at future meetings include civil
rights, states rights, and us.
foreign relations.

The group is not limited to
the d e C l a r e d conservative.
Those who are interested in
learning more about the con-
servative viewpoint are wel-
come. The group also wel-
comes any members of the lac-
ulty and those living in the
city of Grinnell who wish to
gain from conservative opinion.

Interested persons are asked
to contact Robin Converse for
further iniormation.

The final selection of

an SGA president will de-

pend more on personalities than on issues, because the
candidates don‘t differ a great deal on the issues.

It is not particularly distressing to see that the can-
didates are crowding the middle of the road. Grinnell
students have certainly had their share of empty prom-
ises, and the fact that all three candidates can see a
common goal adds to the validity of that goal.

Generally speaking, the goal is one of attitude
change. We would agree with the candidates that the
last year has been one of conﬂict and misunderstand-
ing. Unfortunately, the conflict was necessary because
of the prevailing attitude that students and administra-
tion cannotthink alike or serve each other.

We look forward to an SGA president who not
only respects his position as a student, but who respects
the positions of those who work in administrative posts
above him. We look forward to an SGA president who
will concern himself with rule enforcement before rule
creation. We look forward to a year of accomplishment

rather than waste.

 

Faculty Articles Are in Professional Journals

Dr. John H. Burma (soc),
has had two articles published
in recent professional journals.

“The Journal of American
Folklore" has printed his
study of a secret flagellant
brotherhood found among the
Hispanos of northeastern New
Mexico, entitled, “c a c r u s
.Whips and Wooden Crosses."

His “Inlerethnic Marriage in
Los Angeles, 1948-59," a tabu-
lation and description of the in-
termarriage of whites with Ne-
g r o e s, Filipinos, Japanese
Americans, Chinese Americans,
and Indians, appears in the cur-
rent issue of “Social Forces."

. Japanese Art Work

Given by Sch romms

A group of 16 art gifts has
been presented to Grinnell by

Mr. and Mrs. James 5.
Schramm of Burlington, Iowa.

The new Collection, valued at
over $4,300, includes contem-
porary Japanese woodblock
prints, aquatints, drypoints and
lithographs. It brings to 25 the
number of pieces the Schramms
have given to the college dur»
ing the past few years.

Quartet Scheduled

String quartets by Hayden,
Mozart, and Beethoven will be
performed by the Lenox Quar-
let in ii public concert at 3 p.m.
in Herrick Chapel this Sunday.

Members of the group, who
are artists-in-residence at Grlnr
cell for the second successive

car, are Peter Marsh and

heodora Mantl, violins; Paul
ﬂersh, viola; and Donald MC'
Call, cello.

 

“Setting the Stage for Lin-
coin Theatre,” an article writ-
ten by Grinnell’s Richard D.
Meyer (theatre) and his wife,
Nancy, was a feature of the
January issue of Theatre Arts.

While on leave from Grinnell,
Meyer is working this year with
Elia Kazan at the Lincoln Cen-
ter Repertory Theatre in New
York City.

The Meyers’ article describes
the entire preparation for the
Theatre’s opening production,
“After the Fall," by Arthur

To the Editor:

As Dryden so aptly wrote:
“Errors, like straws, upon
the surface flow,
He who would search for
pearls, must dive below."
Thus the interim session.

The JLAE and bedfellows
have been subjected to won-
drous and ingenious criticism
by strange and marvelous
minds. Amid this clamor, as is
usual, no sound’or reason is
anywhere to be detected, for.
as is the liberally educated stu-
dents‘ wont. there is little com-
prehension on their part of
what education is. This, how-
ever, is not the point or this
letter, ior we’ve already heard
enough nonsense on the subject.

Meyer Sees Interim Projects Offering Four Advantages

To the Editor:

There has been a great deal
of crilicism, these past few
weeks, of lhe interim session.
Lack of student incentive,’ the
wasting of time, and so on are
the general complaints. Maybe
we are not using our lime to the
best advantage (although I
don’t feel that catching up on
reading the news, sleep, and
just talking are such a criminal
waste of time). Perhaps we
don't have much incentive—but
is whether or not we study
such a gross lack of intellectual-
Does all this really add up to
such a gross lack of intellectual-
lsm and interests?

Let me answer by making
a proposal. I suggest that in
future interim sessions each
student be required to regis-
ter with the college a particu-
larvindependent project he in-
tends to carry out during in-

 

terim. This project can he on
any topic, may or may not re-
sult in a final product, and may
he as absolutely free and in-
dependent as the student
wishes. The purpose of regis
tl‘ation is two fold: first, the
student is more likely to Carry
out his project if he has ac-
tually registered it and it is
not merely a vague idea in his
head, and secondly, this would
provide lists of students and
the general areas in which they
are studying. These lists could
be both posted, that the stu»
dents could make Contact with
others interested in the same
area, and given to faculty, so
that students could seek help
and guidance from them,
should they so desire.

There are four major advan-
tages to this kind of interim
session. First, it gives the
freshmen and sophomores a

 

friedlander Says Grant From Ford
Curtails Administration's flexibility

To the Editor:

Let us indulge in some sim-
ple arithmetic. Most of us de-
sire to attend Grinnell for four
years. For this privilege we
must , contribute $2,400 per
year, with an annual increase
of $150, so the endowment
which must progress one direc-
tion or the oLher, is not totally
depleted. Meanwhile the admin-
istration, brave souls, launch
into a campaign, soon to be
completed, to solicit (did your
parents contribute?) four mil-
lldn dollars |n less than three
years. That is about four theirs-
and for each and every stu-
dent, l.;l thousand dollars per
year per student. (We will not
here discuss to whose benefit
this \money is used but Will
Submit that the administration
is painfully anxious ro continue
the flow.)

But maybe this is not really
so bad. Are not the curtailment
of student government and the
arbitrary actions of the admin
istration the necessary price to
attain the free two million
dollars which the Ford promr
ises us. Imagine, $500 for ev»
my student! ! Yes, we may
get handsome buildings and
personable {BM machines, but
let us never forget that the
Ford has kindly. Offered us the
option on another matching
fund. The administration will,
without doubr, accept in our
name. No lower tuition, no re'
laxalion, since each new mil-
lion will be harder to court.

Now who really creates these
impressive Sums? The admin»
istration would argue for its
fine corps of busmessmen and
our fine president who expend
immeasurable quamiues of
brain energy to entice the like-
ly With the old “Grmnell stu-
dents run the college” bit. Up
on reflection, however, it may
be readily seen, that it is we,
the students, who grease the
wheel that makes the cart col-
lect.

 

 

What would the administra-
tion do without students?
Die/l 1! It is true that they
would probably, at first, initi-
ate, with the money saved
from expenditures on students,
a stupendous fund~raislng specs
tacular—“the student does not
even feel he is going to a col-
lege" bit—but we may rest as-
sured that some innocent conA
tributor will finally notice the
disappearance of all buildings
but Burling Library with its
basement.

And what would happen to
the students if the administrav
tion disappeared tomorrow? We
would, quite naturally, go to
another college. (At first. it is
true, we might try it alone; but
who would be Dean of Men,
a necessary pillar for any lib-
era] institution.) it may be
argued that the administration
would also find new jobs but
where, may we ask, could a
busmessman find such a se-
cure job. So upon cursory ex-
amination, it may be seen that
it is we, the students, not the
administration, who make the
college. We are the ones who
study. while on the basis of
our accomplishments thoy
speak of their achievements.

So let the dollars and sense
be recognized. The students
and administration have a muv
tual dependence. Should we
also not have mutual oblige»
tions and rights? Ii this is not
the case, and it most certainly
is not, the dollar sign may be
seen behind it.

(All this may sound too sim-
ple, and it is, so we must warn
anyone whose ire is unduly eler
vated to work it Off at 651: an
hour for Saga and contribute
the sum to the Ford. Work
only 4,405,881 hours and the
president will shake your hand
and know your name, too.) God
bless the faculty, may we com-
municate.

Outside of their major ﬁeld.

Second, this kind of interim

ance for those who need and
Want it. I think that part of this
lack of interest of incentive so
often mentioned in conneclion
with interim is caused by a
lack of self-discipline coupled
with a lack of knowledge about
how to do independent study.
One of the main complaints of
students is that the faculty
don’t seem interested enough in
students. The faculty reply that
they don’t have the time.

Third, in this kind of interim.
the faculty would have no
classroom responsibility and
would have more time to give
to the students. I cannot think
of a more perfect way of
getting to know a professor, or
students interested in one’l
field than through a good in-
formal discussion over coffee
during interim. Another com-
plaint often voiced is the lack
of intellectual d i a o u 55 i o n l
among students on campus.
This kind of interim would pro-
vide an excellent opportunity
to meet and talk to people who
are interested in the Sam.
kinds of things as you are.

Under this plan the basic in-
terim would not have changed.
There would be no one to check
up on you to see what you had
accomplished; there would be
no outside pressure to accom-
plish anything linal. It would
be a time of relation and of
study. There would still be
moVics, lectures, the JLA,
comps, etc. The essential dif-
ference would be that there
would be guidance for those
who wanted it. With this sort
ol interim program. 1 think you
would find that most of the so-
called Student apathy, lack of
incentive, and lack of intelleC<
tual curiosity would disappear.

Miscellany and Digression l

“Student government must
reorganize itself drastically. It
must no longer care whether
or not it is graced with admin-
istration sanction and legit-
imacy.” With these words
which appeared in a dittoed
statement distributed lastgweek
and signed “Publius,” the
source of tlte‘problems of the
Grim-tell College community
could be seen.

For in the statement by Pub-
lius is the type of reasoning
which has created the prob-
lems which are manifest on the
Grinnell campus. The thoughts
of Publius, whoever he, she or
they may be, are the product of
a selflisl‘l, unrealistic, and to-
tally irresponsible philosophy
which has developed on the
Grinnell campus.

Behind this philosophy seems
to lie a belief in some sort of
divine right of students. Free-
dom and the sanctity of the in-
diVldual appear to be corner-
stones of this philosophy. But
missing is any conception the
regulations and responsi ties
which must be present in any
society to insure freedom and
sanctity of the individual for
everybody.

This philosophy assumes that
the students possess the defini-
tive knowledge and judgment
concerning social beliefs and
practices. Thus, whatever the
students want, they should re-
ceive. The right of the faculty,
administration, and even the
Board of Trustees to have any
control over student regula-
tions is denied.

Perhaps Publius is right
when he says there should be
a reorganization of student
government. However, the fail-
ures of the present system are

 

not the ones he pictures. The
current problems in student
government certainly cannot be
blamed on an overemphasis on
rule enforcement.

Perhaps student government
has failed because it has been
guided by the same philosophy
which guides Publius. Perhaps
the administration views stu<
dent government with contempt
(a claim made by Publius) be-
cause student government has
viewed the administra 'on with
contempt.

Basically the process of stu-
dent government is analogous
to a game. But one cannot suc-
ceed at a game unless one un-
derstands and follows the rules
of that game.

Maybe more could be accom-
plished with a student govern-
ment which understands and
willingly observes the rules of
the game. For the rules of the
game are not going to be
changed simply to suit the
whims of a group of students
who will spend only four years
on the campus. And if those
who are attempting to destroy
the game succeed, they will
have destroyed their only road
to accomplishment.

Weyrauch Concocts Menu for Good Student Government
Mainlngredient—Appetizing Fare of Meaty Leadership

Lately, people have been
coming up and talking to me on
central campus about the un-
savory student government at
Grinnell. The consensus seems
to be that there is an unsatis-
fied hunger for government that
is not in bad taste.

I have applied a great deal
of thought to this problem, and

it has boiled down to the fact '
that the only way to bring good ‘

taste back into student govern-
ment is for me to run for SGA
president as SAGA’S Fayorite
Son.

After carefully studying the '

Various candidates and their
platforms, I sincerely feel that
I am the only man with the
right recipe to Vitaminize the
malnutrition which is so 'de-
spairingly evident at Grinnell,

I feel that the piece de re-
sistance in the present refec-
tion of student life is the SGA
presidency. This is THE ingred-

 

ient that needs to be spiced
up! As a very flavorful leader,
I am sure that in no time I can

 

"SKIP-IT"

find where the tasty seasonings
have been mislaid. With this
knowledge in my hands, any of-
fenders of my menu will be
stewed in their own juice.

with these more lipssmacking
measures, the first steps will be
taken towards the creation of
a new festive board for Grinnell
students, which in turn will
lead to a more culinary atmos-
phere in which the college, a la
cane, will be fed a fare of
meaty leadership that they can
really lick their chops over.

Everyone who has eaten
SAGA food knows how SAGA
reaches the heart with burning
insistency. Let me, with my
recipe for student government,
get to the heart of the probs
lems at Grinnell. If I am SGA
president, the trouble makers
in unappetizing government of-
fices will soon find their gooses
cooked.

Hannah Advocates Sinlessness via Galloping Puritanism:
Help Stamp Out Sex Alcohol, and Pseudo-lntellectualism

Before any responsible stu-
dent government is possible
there must be REVIVAL—re-
vival of the individual as a per-
so revival of the balanced in-
diVldual, campus, and govern-
ment association. I maintain
that the only possible way to
save ourselves, and our hal-
lowed school, is to repent of the
evil and wickedness to which
we have sold ourselves and
adopt the policy of Galloping
Puritanism. As earlier aspir-
ants for this office I also am
against Puritanism that merely
creeps. Concern for Puritan-
ism must not be allotted to a
Faculty - Student committee
where it will be
around for a year or two,
dropped in disgust and frus-
tration, and then forgotten as
the committee members leave
Grinnell. Galloping Puritanism
must be inspired Within each
heart so that as capable indi-
viduals we may act in a rea-
sonable and responsible way.

On this campus there are
four major vices that have
claimed the hearts, minds, and
souls of many of the brethren.
Sex, alcohol, over or pseudo-

b attered‘

 

intellectuallsm, and the desire
for the powers of government
and legislation over fellow stu-
dents. Sin, yes my brethern I
said SIN, is the selling of the
totality of the Whole person,
spirit, mind, body, and desires
to one of these evils. The only
way that it is possible for you
to wipe this evil and sin from
your hearts, minds, and ac-
tions is to adopt Galloping
Purltanism completely and
practice it until once again,
with Hannah’s help, you are
able to see in perspective the
full human possibility.

That goyernment is best
which governs, and does not
lose itself in oiling and nour-
ishing the machine. As presi-
dent Of the SGA I intend to put
this principle into practice.
Open rooms at all times that
when the brethern feel the spir-
it they may gather for hymn
sings. Weekly trips, via Cov-
ered Wagon, into various sin-
ful Grinnell suburbs that those
who have sold themselves into
intellectualism may remember
that try as they might they
are still in and of this world.
One half hour compulsory re-

vival services held before
classes that we may go forth
with the joy of salvation in our
hearts and some common relies
ious ground on which to build
a student life and government.

Oh yes Brethren, REPENT!
Forsake the ways of Main’s
passion pit and dimly lit Una
ion. Purge thyself of the evils
of alcohol, rescue thyself from
the fate of an individual traded
in for a beaker of brew. Leave
off concern for your next meal
for it is merely sustainance for
the true living experience. .
Pledge yourself to spend at
least two hours a day away
from the evils of losing your
seli in the pursuit of words,
pages, and grades. Remember
that it does not take twenty
sets of senate committees and
courts to interpret a simple one
sentence rule that we accepted
when we joined ourselves to
Grinnell and that exists simply
that there may be some order
in the chaos of existence (apol-
ogies to PGK).

REPENT! Forsake unworthy
ultimales! Follow Hannah to
the true way! Hallelujah!

 

Hallelujah Hannah

There is no reason why we can-

ParkiSon's Platform

Affirmation— not negation—
is to be the key for the year’s
activities. Affirmative ection—~
not negative response—should
be our goal.

The Grinnell College Com-
munity is bound together in the
search for knowledge. Yet, it is
this question of community
which has split this campus.
We have become involved in a
vicious circle of power tests—
not completely unlike the situa-
tion in the world with nuclear
testing. With three integral
parts to the machine, any one
of them has the ability to seri-
ously cripple the machine. This
thesis cannot be tested much
further. The machine is on the
verge of breaking down. What
is needed is a shift in attitude
on the parts of all three por-
tions involved in the machine.

 

We must all begin thinking and
acting in the best interests of
the Grinnell College Commun-

ity.

If our efforts are to be suc~
cessful, it will involve give
and take for all segments of
are community. Rules change,
individual action, and the
structure of student govern-
ment must all be considered
against the yardstick of the
communityAhy any group con-
sidering any type of action.
If ﬂie activities within the
community are functioning
smoothly, no one need worry
about the image of this college.

Student government must be-
gin working with longer range
goals. Change does not come
about in a community of this
type overnight. if one area of
interest is temporarily clogged

not talk with them, ramer than
passing resolutions and threat-
ening demonstrations. There
are problems common to all of
us, and these things should be
worked on togetherl With antag-
onism constantly present this
year, this has been difficult,
and usually impossible. Next
year will be different.

In addition to its attitude,
student government has been
plagued with some structural
problems. The biggest weak<
ness in student government is
the incompetence and disinter-
est of large numbers of student
senators. Policy is passed with
little intelligent discussion, with
little information, and with a
poor understanding of the is-
sues involved. This could be
improved by (1) attracting
more interested and competent
people into Senate seats, and
(2) forcing senators to take a

 

 

more active role in all sectors
of SGA, rather than merely at»
tending meetings on Wednes—
day nights.

This could be done by (1)
electing half of the senators
in an lit-large race before
House Council and AWS Board
elections begin, and by (1) as-
signing each senetor to work
as an ex'officio member of
one other branch of SGA. Space
here does not allow for a full
discussion of this proposal, but
I hope to be talking with each
of you during this week.

other than a change in atti-
tude and a structural reform,
one more major change is
necessary. This year student
government has been obsessed
with rules. Virtually all of the
activities of the Senate were
concentrated in this one area.
Rules and regulations are cer-
tainly an important concern of

 

student government, and they
will continue to be, but other
things are also of concern. Stu-
dent government should bee
come actively involved in the
Southern exchange program~<
so far generally ignored. Grin-
nell should be worked into the
new NSA Student Hostel Pro<
gram. A course evaluation sys<
tem should be initiated. Under
such an arrangement, each stu<
dent makes an objective eval-
ulation of each of his courses
and professors at the end of
each semester. All of these
things are legitimate matters
for student government action.

A change in attitude, a
change in structure, and a shift
in focus —these are major
changes, but they are neces-
sary if SGA is to fulfill its role
as an effective and construc-
tive part of the Grinnell comb
munity.

_ Phil Johnson

Has Affirmative Action as Goal .

in the process, we must shift
our attention to other areas.

 

PARKISON

 

One good place to start would
be the Arbor Lakeproject—
the construction of a college re-
treat nearer to the campus.

An eye must be kept on the
national scene for activities af-
fecting us in our roles as stu-
dents. There was such an op—
portunity this year with the
tax bill and its clause concern-
ing an increased deduction for
parents with dependents in col-
lege. This clause was defeated
in the Senate by three votes.
There is no way of ascertaining
what influence letters—either
from us, from our parents, or
both—could have had on that
vote. It was an opportunity
passed by.

At this time, i feel little con-
cem for the structure of stua
dent government, per se. I
should like to see the Coil-[P

and AWS Board used more, as
informal legislative bodies to
work with the Executive Cabi-
net in formulating policies and
programs to be presented to
the Student Senate. However,
this does not preclude the pos<
sibility of change; it circum-
stances should so warrant dur-
ing the year. '

We have learned much this
year; our efforts should not be
to neglect what has occurred,
but rather to realize the full
import of what has happened.
Then we must proceed with a
new approach towards achiev-
ing our objectives. The first
and most immediately neces-
sary step is the re-establish-
ment of mutual respect between
the student body, the faculty,
and the administration.

Enforcement .tlie Crux of 56A Dilemma Assert: Pi

We must decide now wheth-
er we Want ‘Student govern-
ment, or Whether we are going
to allow it to drift into obliv-
ion. Government by students
is continually requested by all.
Yet once we received the pow-
er to govern ourselves, We de-
clined to accept the responsi-
bility to do so.

The desirability of student
government from our stand-
point is that it gives us a care
tain degree of freedom within
our community and allows us to
experience the problems inher-
ent in any democracy. lt trains
us in the responslbilitles each
member of a community must
accept and in this way further
prepares us for our adult life.

From the viewpoint of the ad—
ministration and faculty, gov-
ernment by students is part of
the constant maturation pro-
cess. It'is desirable to become
accustomed to governing and
being governed by our peers.
Naturally, the framework of
student government does not
establish itself as the ultimate
authority. The framework con-
tains»a system of checks and
balances which in our case
take the form of higher author-
ities. But this does not mean
government by students is a
mirage. We are delegated spe-
cific areas in which we can act,
and within set limits, we can
act as we wish.

The open rooms question has

become the example of a stu»
dent government to many peo~
pie. it has been established as
a type of controlled experiment.
We have generally declined to
accept the responsibility given
to us, and the repercussions
have been many, up to and in-
cluding suggesting dissolution
of student government. Unfor-
tunately. this is not an isolated
example of student failure, but
rather, it pervades most areas
of student life.

Student government is worth
saving, if for no other reason
than‘that the alternativegad-
ministrative action—is undesir-
able. We must rid ourselves of
irresponsible government, ac-
cept and enforce the rules and

restrictions as they exist today,
and change those aspects we
dislike in the future. Until
changes occur in our policies,
we ‘must BcCept the responsi»
bility of enforcing them.

The i tiative is ours to take.
We wanted government by stu-

dents. If We still want it, we
must face the reality of the
present situation and do some—

thing about it. I want student ‘

government to continue, and I
intend to assure its continua<
tion in its present form. This
involves enacting responsible
government by students and
then attempting to change it to
meet our desires. This I pledge
to do.

Cagers Lose to Calls, ﬂies; Meet Beloit, Coe

By Pete Kollman

The Glinnell Pioneers, once
(lo-holders of 2nd place in Mid-
west Conference play, dropped
two heartbreakers here last
weekend to the visitors from
Northfield, Carleton and St,
Olaf.

This was the fourth Pioneer
loss in the last five conference
outings; however, all but the
Cornell game were lost by 4
points or less,

On Friday night Gi'innell
took the floor against the
Carls and it looked as if the
game would be no contest.
The Pioneers zoomed off to
B 10 point lead. The lead re-
mained around the 12 point
mark until late in the half
when the Carls began a come-
back. They cut Grimell‘s
margin to 42-37 and hit again
just before the halftime ham
to go to the dressing room
.h'ailing by just three points.

The Pioneers started out well

in the 2nd half and increased ;

their margin to 8 before Carla»
ton went to work again The
Cal‘ls edged up on Grinnell,
passed them and built up a 9
point lead, which they held un-
til the Pioneers came to life
Wlth four minutes remaining.

Aided by three missed free
Iihrows by Carleton’s Jack Ars-
do, Grinnell cut the margin to
three and were threatening at
the end before they finally suc-
cumbed, 89786.

Both teams hit very well for
the evening, Grinnell making
41 per cent of its field goal at-
tempts and Carleton 50 per
cent, including a 57 per cent
performance in the second
half. Grinnell hit 32 per Cent
(14-17) and Carleton 11 percent
(17-24) from the foul line.

Outstanding pErfonnnnces
were turned in by senior co<
captain, Jim Mifflin and soph-
nmore Jeff Frantz. Miiflin
scored 29 points, a Pioneer
season high, and Frantz hit
13 field goals, also a season
high, and lead Grinnell’s final
surge before fouling out.

The Saturday afternoon con-
test was another frustrating
one for the Pioneers. After
spurting off to an early lead,
they were caught by St. Olaf
and the game turned into a see-
saw battle. At halftime both
teams had 40 points.

Neither team was able to
amass more than a four point
lead in the second half. With
three minutes to go the Oles
had a two point lead and tried
to stall but the Pioneers stole
tho ball and Jim Mifflin put in
the tying basket with a little
less than two minutes remain-
ing. St. Olaf Stalled until 6 sec-
onds remained when Eric
Grimsrud, Ole guard popped in
the winning’ basket. Grinnell
tried in vain to get a shot off
in the seconds remaining

As the night before, both
teams scored anlequal number
of field goals, the margin com-
ing from the foul line, Grinnell
hit 42 per cent from the field;
St. Olaf connected on 43 per
cent of its tries. Once again
Mifflin and Fi‘antz led the Pio-
neers, the senior forward hit-
ting l9, and the sophomore
guard, 21.

 

 

tor:

Grinnell's John Sundell (4|) and Ted Kisser [5|] go up for

the rebound against Carleton
Darby Gym.

Midwest Conference Siale Full;
Redmen Play Host in Lawrence

In What Could be the key
games of the Week in the Mid-
west Conference, Coe will be
at Cornell and Lawrence at
league leading Ripon on Friday
night. Both Coe and Lawrence
figure to play the role of the
spoilers in this pair.

Cornell, headed by the scor-
ing of Jack Grams and Dick
Calbow, and the strong all-
around play of Dal Zierk and
John Shillinglaw, will have to
stop the onertwo scoring punch
of Coe's Wylan Witte and Skip
Swan,

The first time around, Ripon
had little trouble with neighbor-
ing Lawrence, but since then,
the Vikings have got their of-
tense rolling, with Joel Ungrodt
and Earl Hoover leading the
way, they have moved into the
thick of things If the injured
Tom Steinmetz is ready, Law-
rence could be tough

Ripon really depends on no
one in its balanced attackl Gary
Mevis is the top scorer now,
but Jack Ankerson, Jim Car
hoon, and Willie Alexander
have all racked up their share
of points,

While the Redmen have but
one league game facing them
this weekend, Cornell has to go
to Belolt on Saturday night to
face the Dave Hendricks and
Bob Rudolph led Bucs, who
find themselves right in the
middle of the pack,

Facing Beloit on Friday night
will be the slumping Grinnell
Pioneers who have had trouble
finding scoring support for its
onertwo punch of Jim Mifflin
and Jeff Frantz, who moved in-
to the league's leadingrscorer

 

list for the first time since the
first couple weeks of the sea-
son,

On Saturday night, the Pio~
neers face traditional rival C0!
in Cedar Rapids for a rematch
in the first one, Grinnell won
73-71 on a last second buckctl

Meanwhile, the Illinois pair,
Knox and Monmouth go to
Northlield, Minn, to try St Olaf
and Carleton, First on the
docket are Monmouth and Car»
latch, and Knox and St. Olaf.

Monmouth could take a big
step toward getting out of the
basement with a sweep over the
up and Coming Carls and Oles.
The bulk Of the Scot attack is
built around the shooting tal-
ents of Gary Gilliland, Harold
Rathgeb, and Dick Rodgers.

Carleton has been getting
steady performances out of
little Jack Arado. However,
coming on fast of late have been
Ron Sanders, Mike Tierney, and
Jack Chap. Both Tierney and
Chap are ever-present under
the boards

Knox is probably the hottest
offensive machine in the Mid-
west right” now with three
straight games over the 100
mark — 118, 106, and 105. ND
one in particular has been find-
ing the bucket for the Siwash,
just everyone at once, Leader
right now is Brandon Piper who
has exploded for 49 points in
the last two league games.

basketball squad now zeros in
on the thick of a three-team
race tor second place with a
two-day road trip to Beloit and
Coe. The Pioneers take on the
Bucs tonight and move on to
Cedar Rapids for another night
game against Coe tomorrow.

week that he plans to continue
to experiment to try and iind
a winning combination, John
Sundell, the league‘s leading
rebounder, appears fit again
after a bout of illness which
limited him to 21 total re-'
bounds in the last two games
— about halt his average.

.Tim Mifflln, the team’s lead-
ing scorer with a 20.4 mark, and
Jeff Frantz, who netted 47
points against the invaders
from Northficld to up his av-
erage to 17.0, appeal- to be cer-
tain starters. Pfitsch was also
pleased with the work of re-
serve Ted kisser and tabs RisV

end.

is currently tied for fifth in
the Midwest Conference and
a win over the Pioneers could
move Coach Bill Knapton’s
crew into fourth, The Bucs
are sparked by forward Bob
Rudolph and guard Dave Hen-

Odricks, both with 16 point
averages. Belait also has a
revenge motive working tor
them since Grinnell cooled
off the hot-shooting Wiscon-
sin team earlier this year by
an 83-76 count.

Coe, although mired in ninth
place with a 4.9 record, pos-
sesses perhaps the most potent
172 punch in the league this
season .in Wylan Witto (19.4
points per game) and Skip
Swan (19.3 points per game).
Moreover, the Kuhawks have
good depth Pioneer fans can
attest to this after the Grinnell
team held Witte to eight points
in their 73-71 cliffhanger win
last month, only to have guard
Bob Beckman toss in 20 points
to almost pull the game 0th of
the fire for the Kohawks.

Optimistically, Coach Pfitsch
sees a good chance for a double
victory this trip. The Pioneers .
have downed both teams before
and. oddly enough, are playing
better ball on the road so far
this year than at home.

Tankers Win Three. Lose One:
Kraoi Sets Breast Stroke Mark

By Eric Jacobson

Winding up its dual meet
season, the Grinnell team won
three and lost one meet last
weekend. In a double dual meet
in the Grinnell pool last Fri-
day the tankers downed Mon—

_ month 5748 and St. Olaf 74V;-
151/,

Again at home on Saturday
the Pioneers lost 57'” to Carle-
ton. On Monday they traveled
to Mount Pleasant to defeat
Iowa Wesleyan 61-31. Tomor-
row the tankers go to August»
aria College for the Vikings
Olympics.

In the Friday meet, in which
the three teams swam togeth»
er, is in a triangular but scored
like three duals, Monmouth
gave the Pioneérs their great-
est challenge. The Scots won
four of the first five events, but
from then on Grinnell won eye
ery event and won going away.

Winning for Grinnell were
Tony Horton in the back-
stroke, Eric Jacobson in the
butterfly, John Krﬂai in the
breaststroke, Ralph Pray in
the 500 yard freestyle and
Howie Sehein in the loll free-
style.

Against St. Olaf the tankers
won all events but the back-
stroke. Roger Abendroth won
the diving. Mlko Fort won the
60 yard freestyle, Kraai won
the individual medley and Pray
won the 200 freestyle

Carleton won bom relays
from the Pioneers but in the
individual events the two
teams were almost even. Pray
got firsts in the 200 and 500
freestyle, Schein won the 60
freestyle and Kraai won the
200 yard breaststroke in a time
of 2:333, lowering the pool rec-
ord. which he set earlier in the
year, by .2 second.

Nine teams are entered in
the Viking Olympics, August-
ana, Bradley, Coe, Knox, Illi-
nois Wesleyan, Iowa Wesleyan,
Monmouth and Bradley along
with Grinnell. All regular dual
meet events are swum With
preliminaries in the afternoon
and the finals in the evening.

Grinnell has previously de
feated Coe, Knox, Iowa Wes~
leyan and Monmouth in dual
meets. The Pioneers, however,
bowed to Augustana in a dual
meet earlier this season,

Thincluds Third
Against SUI, Purdue

By Jim Fish

Grinnell’s indoor track team
finished third last Saturday in
a triangular meet against the
University of Iowa‘and Purdue
University. The ﬁnal
found Iowa on top with 72;
points, Purdue second With 65
points and Grinnell third with
27 points.

According to Grinnell
Coach Dick Young, “The
squad as a whole did a fair-
ly good job for this early
in the season. The team had
only been working out for
two weeks. I consider this
month as our conditioning
month and the team appeared
to be in pretty good shape
for this early in the season."
Coach Young was especially
pleased with the performances
of Bruce Beckord, Ron Sella-
Chel, Mike Dewitt, John Sut-
ton, John TePaske, Jim Mil-
ler, and his high jumpers, Mike
Fox, and Tom Wood.

Beckord finished third in the
440 yard dash with a time of
:50.3, only three tenths of a
second off the winning time o!
:50 by Iowa’s Gary Hollings-
worth, last year's Big Ten
quarter mile champ.

Sophomore Jim Miller tossed
the shot 47 feet, two inches,
only a foot less than the Grin-
nell College record.

Coach Young also was
pleased with the performance
of his mile relay team of
Schachel, Jeri Langham, Te-
Paske, and Beckord, which,
although placing third, ran
the mlle ln 14:29.7, only a little
more than a second off the
Midwest Conference record.
Coach Young added‘ that
these early meets help him to
find the right combinations and
that the real season doesn't
Start until the Midwest Confer
ence Indoor Meet, March 71h.
The Pioneer Thinclads travel
tomorrow to Drake Universrty
in Des Moines where they will
meet several other Iowa col-
leges in an invitational meet.

Berg,'Frank Relate Experiences
Al Argonne National Laboratory

By John Wolf

Grinnell seniors Fred Berg
and James Frank have recent-
ly returned from a semester of
ytudy at the Argonne Nation-

1 Laboratory near Chicago.
Ewing their stay at Argonne,

ey had the opportunity of be-
ing part of a research com-
munity.

”Its almost impossible”.
Berg commented ”to do real re-
search in physics at a small col-
lege becauserthe needed equip-
rnent is so expensive. At Ar-

onnc I was able to do rewarda
Tug research in physics; al~

though of course, our freedom
in using the equipment was lim~

Ited because it was so expen-
’ sive and because we lacked the

necessary training. "

“We had three obligations
ﬁuring our stay at krgonne,”
Frank noted. ”First, each stu-
kIent selected a project and
? supervisor from among the
ull-time Argonne researchers.
’A paper concerning the project
had to be'written at the end
pf the semester.

“Second, we had to attend
Eeriodic seminars in our major
ield—either bielosy. chemistry,
or physics. In my biology sem-
inar, all seven students gave
Dnerand-one-half hours talks on
a series of general topics which
were researched in Argonne’s
.xcellent‘ libraries.

/ ‘jFinally, there were weekly

interdisciplinary seminars dur-
ing which we were exposed to
the different facets of the lab,
within the limits of our back-
ground.”

Frank’s project was the de-
termination ot the changes of
effective density of diOXyribon-
ucleic acid (DNA) at varying
pH levels. He recalled that,

”one machine, a $26 000 ultra—
centrifuge, gave me some trou-
ble. ”

Berg 5 paper was titled “The
Nuclear Zeeman Effect in
NbiiSnllQ.”

“I was trying to determine
the superconducting regions in
niobium tin, If they existed. The
experiment involved using the
Mossbauer Effect.”

Berg also assisted his adviser
in other experiments.

“We had to complete one six-
week experiment in two weeks
because they were closing down
one of the reactors for repair.
To add to the rush, the radio«
active material we were using
had a short half~life. So, each
time we needed the radioac-
tive material, I had to rush
over in a special cart, get the
material from the reactor, and
rush back. We even had people
holding open doors "

“There was generally very
little pressure on us from our
supervisors," F r a n k said.
“That doesn’t mean that we

 

had time on our hands, how-

Students participating in the
Argonne Semester live on the
grounds of the laboratory. Stu-
dents from all schools in the
Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west are eligible; those select-
ed pay tuition to their home
school and pay room and board
to Argonne. Participants re-
ceive up to 15 hours of credit
toward their _graduation re-
quirement. Each student re-
ceives $40 a week for a 20-hour
work week.

not tight, Frank‘noted. Berg
did mention, however, that
badges were required for en
trance in the evening and that
there were spot checks of em-
ployees’ cars.

Both returnees felt that their
experiences at Argonne have
given them a first-hand under
standing of the demands of re-
search. Both advised any stu-
dent at all interested in re-
search to look into the pro-
gram.

Since the Argonne program
began In 1960, eight Grinnell-
ions have participated as stu<
d e n t research associates.
James Clapp in mathematics-
chemistry and Michael Schul-
hof in physics were Grinnell’s
participants in the spring 1963
session.
