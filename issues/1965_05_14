Eisenhower Speaits Out at Press Conference

a, ,

By John Wolf

During a press conference that must certainly be coli-
sidered more satisfying than the school’s only other presi-
dential news conference former President Dwight Eisenhower
frankly answered questions on subjects from Viet Nam to
the 1968 presidential campaign to the American space pro<

ram.
g The conference was held yesterday afternoon in Robert!
Theatre, which was overflowing with more than 700 specta‘
tors and journalists ‘

The first question was from New York Times reporter
Felix Belair and concerned Eisenhower’s opinion of the
Viet Nam situation, and what side Eisenhower took in re-
gard to Ba Goldwater‘s statement that he authored the
present administration policy in Viet Nam.

Eisenhower said that at the time Goldwater made his sug.
gestions, they were a shock to the American public. “i do
agree that many things he recommended are now being done."_

“The only one single man in the United States who can
speak for us in foreign relations is the President of the United
States. If I or any other individual could recruit enough peo-
ple to make a significant inroad into the support he gets from
the United States in the Cl ical problems he has to face, it
would be doing a great disservice, because constitutionally he
has the power and we can’t do anything about it."

Because this is a critical period in America, Eisenhower
said, “I’ve got to support the President of the United States."

Johnson’s policies, he said, are firm and reasonable, and.
that he would agree, “they are about the right thing to do."
When asked what his toughest

Debate Over Salaries Causes Race
To Upset Quorum at SGA Meeting

By Ted Lemaire

The latest carnival by the ad-
visory council was hi gli-
lighted by a race between Les-
ter Tobias, attempting to leave
the room and thereby destroy
the quorum, and Keith King,
trying to “seal the chamber”
as instantaneously - appointed
sergeant-at—arms.

The epic race resulted from
the defeat of a motion recom-
mending a budget for the con»
ing academic year without the
addition of salaries for cer-
tain student officers.

A motion was subsequently
passed favoring yearly salar-
ies for student officers, among
which were social co-ordinator,
$100; SGA President, 5300;
AWS President, $300; CofHP
President, $300.

Between the numerous moves
to establish Correct parliamen-
tary procedure, by yarious ex-

perts, a motion was discussed
to provide the faculty with free
copies of the 5&3. Opposed on
the grounds that the paper
would be losing $200 from pos-
sible subscriptions and that in<
'terested faculty should buy it
themselves were Karen Lauterr
bach and Dan Bucks. Dave
Lighthourne and others contend-
ed that elsewhere faculty re-
ceive papers and that this would
provide them with more contact
with students. Finally passed
was the request that the admin-
istration consider providing
funds for free subscriptions.

Among other business dis-
cussed was the damage bill for
the May 4 impromptu riot, to-
taling $98.44, to be evenly paid
by the CDfHP and the AWS
board. The executive cabinet
requested that in the future
there be more enforcement to
prevent damage.

“I was older than most when
I came to West Point," said
Eisenhower. “1 had to work
tor a living two years and
found the cadet system not
overpowering but laughable.
You can imagine the trouble
that got me into."

Eisenhower’s reception of the
students was warm and he
ikept emphasizing that he didn't
‘want to do all or the talking.

The Republican party split
was discussed, of course. Eisen-

S&B Interview: Ike Likes’Rural Undergrad Colleges lke: Preparation for Citizen's Dulles
Will Help Further Nation's Purposes

By Bob Hodieme

Former President Dwight Eisen—
hower was hot and tired as he
rode hack to Grinnell house from
his nn-swat initiation into North
Younker and Cowles halls — but
he was still in high spirits that
had typiiied the first day of his
Visit to Grinnell.

Eisenhower, who looked like he
was having a good time all day,
admitted that he was and that the
primary reason for his enjoyment
was that he ”likes young people.”

The former president only ac-
cepts two honorary degrees every
year saying that “I don’t want to
be greedy and start collecting
them,"

“I try to choose a large college
and a small collegc ever-y year,”
said Eisenhower when asked why
Grinnell was selected as one of

‘ two schools that he would visit this
year.

“When it comes to a choice be-
tween a large university and a
small college I usually go to the
small college," he Said.

“I very much believe under-
graduate work should be done in
rural colleges with graduate work
in the larger cities.”

Eisenhower commented that he
hadn’t felt tired all (lay but that
he became tired during his speech
“It was then," he said, “that I
realized that it was tWD huurs lat-
er than I thought it was. Not only
that, but I got up early today to do
some work in my oiftce” The

liornier president was reieri‘ing to
the time difference between here
and his home in Gettysburg, Pa.

The president was asked it he
iwuilltl ever retire. “I just don’t

no when people ask you to come
to this or that affair and speak—
especially when you’ve been as en-
thusiastic about all this as I have."

lke Turns Down $1,000

Former president Dwight Eisen-
hower was altered and declined a
$1,000 honorarium from the PPPE
for his Visit to Grinnell as politi-
cian in residence yesterday and
today, according to c. Edwin Gil-
mour, director of PPPEt

“Your paramount obligation
is such preparation of yourself
for the discharge of citizenship
responsibilities that you may
play your part in furthering
the nation's purposes,” for-
mer President Dwight Eisen-
hower told an audience of 2,500
Grinnell students and the gen-
eral public last night in Darby
Gymnasium.

encourage and to lead those
about you toward wisdom and
decency and patriotism in per
forming the duties of citizen-
ship," he explained.

Eisenhower said that the
challenges of today are more
difficult than those of yestere
year because of the “almost-
instant communications that
can overnight make any fric<
tiDn abroad into an inter-con-
tinental dispute,” because “a
sharply divided world can
transform each into an ideo-
logical quarrel," and because
“every crisis of international
moment may bear Within itselt
the germ of nuclear War.”

“Remembering that a sense
less enemy could trigger an
assault aimed at annihilation,
we realize that only advanced
preparation can hold [Is to act
sanely and effectively,“ he
said. ”Such advance pi‘eparar
tion requires, from government
and private citizens alike,
study, reflection, and contem-
plation oi the lessons of history
— so that in crises there may
be promptly and effectively
rallied all the country’s
strength — material, inlellt-‘CA
tual, spiritual.”

Speaking throughout the ad-
dress to a you ng audi-
ence, Eisenhower continued,
"To meet them courageously,
to defeat whatever may threaten
our system and way or life,
will require of you far more
than emotional loyalty or in»
stinctive response,"

He outlined some of the
preparation he thought should

much in a mistaken position when
they tried to get in the way ot the
execution oi the iedcral court or-
der.
, “it made me very sad to have to
a , do this, but nevertheless i decided
to do it promptly and with enough
power so no one would be hurt."
Eisenhower next discussed the
us. space program. “Our interest
in the exploration oi space should

tific men.” He said we Should ask,
: “what do we need to know, for our
’ ' own benefit, that we can learn
trom outer space exploration and
what is the military influence of
this new science?" He Said we
ought to spend our main ettoi-t in
near space, and trom the informa-
tion we learn there, ”one day we
can go to the moon or any other
place without any great difficulty.”

President Johnson’s policy in the
Dominican Republic was deiended
by Eisenhower on grounds that
American intervention would “ale
low the genuine government to or-
ganize and gradually take over,"

Eisenhower did not like the com-
parison between the Dominican and
Cuban Situations, however. He
said that in its early stages, Fi-
del Castro's rebellion in Cuba had
received wide public support in
America. “We thought the fellow
was doing pretty well.”

When it was finally clear that
Castro was a communist, Eisene
hower said, “I definitely authorized

Yesterday afternoon Grinnell
conferred an honorary doctor

ident Dwight D. Eisenhower,
citing him as “a man who,
knowing war, made his first‘

the necessity of peace.”

l who volunteered lor military serv-
ice, armed thcin, and began to
train them.” Had we moved quick»
ly against Castro, Eisenhower ielt,
“we would have been called the
worst interventionist, imperialist,
and everything else in the works."

During the student questioning
period, Eisenhower was ﬁrst con-
fronted with the question of why he
did not authorize sending American
troops to Hungary during the 1956
revolt in that country.

“It was impossible, Hungary is
surrounded. Britain and France at
that time were preoccupied with
their difficulties in Suez and cer-
tainly didn't want to extend theme
selves. The only way we could adr
equately have handled the situa—
tion would have been going directly
to Russia with our bomb. And this
to my mind was unthinkable in that
the present state of world opinion
would have made it unwise at that
time.”

Eisenhower felt that the admin-
isti‘ation’s Viet Nam policy must
be backed, even by the academic
community, it we are not to look
weak in the eyes of the commu-
nists. “I don’t think we will get
anywhere by simply criticizing
Johnson. 1 must tell you that the
one thing the communists under.
stand and respect is torce, power,
firm will.”

on Student demonstrations, Eis-
enhower felt that they are all right
when they concern domestic policy,
but “when we go into foreign pol.
icy on a current crisis (here I’m
not talking about history or long.
range policy), then i think their
protests had better be through petl~
tion that would reach the highest
executive offices. I don’t recall, ex»
cept in one case, any great picket»
ing of the White House."

In iact, because oi the geograph»
ical layout of the White House,
Eisenhower Saitl, “A Prestdent
goes troin his back apartment over
to the White House without ever
seeing Pennsylvania Avenue for
weeks. Frequently l'tl learn about
picketiiig trom the papers,"

When questioned about whonl he
would support tor the 1968 nomina-
tion, Eisenhower said, “I’ve got a
long list that i haven’t made pub-
lie, but I’ll say this: There’s at
least one man from Iowa who’ll
have to be considered."

Following the questioning period,
Eisenhower thanked the spectators
and inquisitors tor their courtesy
and attention.

Neimen Win .Two More Dual Meets.
Enter Conference Meet at Monmouth

By Ken Clymer

The Gi'inliell tennis team capped
a successiul season last weekend
by winning two or three meets, The
netmen started their roadtrip on
Thursday afternoon. They met a
much improved Cornell team at
Mt. Vernon, but managed to edge
the Rams 5-4.

Mike Greenfield, Gi’iimell’s most
consistent Winner, was unable to
make the trip. But wins by Shan-
non (No. l), Kinsey (N0. 5}, and
Horton (No. 6), as well as Vic-
tories by No. 1 doubles (Shannon
and Hicks) and No. 3 doubles
Kinsey and Horton) gave Grinriell
the victory.

On Friday alternoon, the netrnen
met Eelmt at Belmt. The Pioneers
swept by 7.2, winning four oi six
singles and all three doubles
matches.

Winning for the Pioneers were
Shannon, Hicks, Kinsey, and Hor-
ton. clymer and Lovell, both of
whom had lost singles matches in
straight sets, came back at sec-
ond doubles to win in three hard-
fought sets. The doubles teams of
Shannon and Hicks and Kinsey and
Horton were also Victorious.

Grinnell played Iowa State on
Monday in preparation for the Con-
ference meet today and tomorrow
at Monmouth. The Pioneers were
defeated 7-2, but most of the
matches were close. The only win-
ners for Grinnell were Chip Kin-
sey, who won in three sets at No.

 

6 singles: and second doubles team
of Clymer and Greenfield, who
won so, 54, after dropping the
first set, 671.

The Pioneer tennis team Will en-
ter the conierence match today
With a very good 6-3 season mark.

Carleton will he the team to
beat. They swept by Grinnell 7-0,
and have regularly been blanking
other conference schools. Grinnell
will also have to fight Lawrence,
Cornell, St. Olaf, and Ripon for
points. Grinnell edged Cornell, 5-4,
Ripon 6-3, and has not played St.
Olaf. They lost to Lawrence, 51/2-
31/2.

Grinnell’s best hope in singles is
Mike Greenfield, Who has been de-
feated only once in Conference
play, Greenileld lost to Carleton's
man in two close sets; he was [led
by Lawrence in a marathon match
not played to completion, Although
Greenﬁeld missed the matches
against Cornell and Beloit, he
should be able to defeat opponents
from those schools.

Larry Shannan (No. l), Elija
Hicks (No. i) and Ken Clymer
could also add points to the Pin-
neers total.

Greenfield will team with Cly»
mer at No. 2 doubles. Clymei‘ and
Greenfield are undefeated since
the opening match when they lost
to Carleton. 6-3, 6-4. They have a
good Chance of reaching the final
rounds, Greenfield and Clyn-ier
won one of two matches which
Grinnell wnn against Iowa State.

Pioneers Beaten
By Coe in Ninth

The Gi’innell Pioneers near-
ly pulled an upset over the
newly crowned MidwesL con-
ference southern diviSlon cham-
pions Coe here Wednesday be-
fore dropping a 7-5 decision in
the ninth inning.

Coe jumped 10 an early 3-0
lead with single markers in the
second, fourth, and fifth in-
nings. In the bottom half of the
firm the Pioneers began to
llail the shillelaghes as they
banged out three runs with
Denny Hanssen’s two-run sin-
gle tying the score.

Again in the seventh, Coe
pushed across a tie-breaking
run for a 4-3 lead. The Pioneers
roared back in the eighth in-
ning. With two out and a run-
ner on first base, Bob Geller
took two and hit to right for a
triple and scored on a. wild
throw to third. Going into the
last inning the Pioneers held a
5.4 advantage.

In the top half of the ninth
the Coe lead-off man tripled
to center field. With one out,
a can of corn was belted to
center field and was misjudged
for an inside—the—park home
run. The next Coe batter shille-
laghed the pellet over the left
field fence to ice the ballgame
7,5.

Hanssen, one of the better
ones in the business, pitched
the route. Previously he had
handcuffed Coe with a 1-“ one-
hitter at Coe.

So ended another season on
the ball-yard.
