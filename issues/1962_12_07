Communist speaker Ruben views ;
youth's Woes in Marxist framework

By Cal Collier

l
Dan Rubin, editor of ”Comrl
inunist Viewpoint" and a mem-
ber of the executive cabinet of
the Progressive Youth Organiz—l
ing Committee, spoke before a‘
group of students and faculty in
ARH Auditorium Tuesday
Speaking on the topic, “15 Mai ,
ism Youth's Answer7,” Rubin}
outlined the problems facing
American youth and Lhen.'of-l
fer-ed causes and solutions tor,
them. i
Denying the assertion that,
most problems people face al'e‘
personal. he suggested that a:
direct connection exists between
our problems and our “capital.
society," Rubin said that one,
of our major problems, the cold,
war. is attributable to our so-i
ciety which is ’controlled byl
monopolists, i
Concentrating on the- cold want
he asserted that this Situationl
"produces tensions" in the mindsl
of young people and might have
a bearing on juvenile delinquen-l
cy. The cold war, he said. also;
deters funds which could be:
used for social welfare pro-l
grams, federal works projectsi
and federal recreation programs.
Rubin pointed out that the
cold war also instigates a seri-‘
ous threat to civil liberties.
Rubin said that the causes
of these problems can be found.
in ”the ‘very nature of the’
capital system." He singled outl
“giant monopolists" as strugglw
ing successfully to continue the.
cold war, suppress Negroes, and‘
foster ultl‘arright wing groups.
Portraying the U.. as an1
aggressor nation, Rubin stated
that our weapons are primarily-l
offensive and the Sot t Union's;
are primarily defensive. l
Rubin suggested a number oil
courses to be taken to promote
reform within the capitalist
system. Stating that. "headwayl
can be made to expand dem-l
o acy," he urged reform or
civil rights laws. unemploys‘
inent compensation laws. and‘
laws dealing with subversives.
Rubin said that in their
search for economic survival
American youth confronts the
"reactionary iiioiiopolists" ‘much
the same as the working man
does, Rubin said that youth
should consider the working
man as their ally Acting as dis
has, he asserted. certain nece
cssary reforms can be won as
concessions from the monopo»
lists.
liubin went on to briefly sug,
gest some of the obstacles fac-
ing those interested in reforms
In the civil rights area he sin
gled out the concept of “white
supremacy" as the most dangerr‘
bus, and in thc cit-ll liberties
area he contended that “the ma»
jor obstacles to all social pro-
gress are those people who be-
lieve that all communists are
Russian agents. .
Rubin concluded by singling
out various types 01' organize
lions which he feels are woi
ing towards an expansion of
democracy. Amon these he
listed the» “single issue groups,"
groups which limit their atten—
tion to a single field like civil
rights. civil liberties, and peace
He also mentioned the need for
"left wing oi-ganiaataons" and
"Radical Marxist groups” which
coulr “stimulate thought" among

Bowen worried by ‘slippage'
of stutlent concern for others

By Richard Ohleineyei‘
5&3 Asst. News Editor

Grinnoll College President
Howard R Bowen. in an ad-
dress delivered to the Student
Senate Wednesday, discussed
the reasons why the college ad-
{0615 that rule
changes u-ouid not be in order
at this time.

Specifically dealing with the
two rules that have been most
recently criticized by students.
the drinking rule and the wom»

in sampling student opinion he
has found attitudes ranging from
“authoritarian to anarchistic,"
ne expressed disappointment
in what he termed “a gradual
, slippage in the concern of stu-
i dents for the community and
l ior each other." He cannot
l complain, he said. about the
. earnest, hard work of Grin-
‘ neliians, nor about their aca-
‘ deniie honesty, nor their con-
, corn for politics. But he said
l such is not the case when “we
examine our social responsibil—
‘ ity and concern for the com—
; munity."
1 President Bowen reminded the
lsenators that the reputation of
‘the college is important to all
lot the students, graduates. trus—
llecs, faculty and other employ
,ees. The reputation has surfered.
the said, because of recent dis.
lcuss‘lon about women's hours
land the drinking rule. which has
:appeared in the Scarlet & Black.
5 “AT THIS TIME," President
gBowen suggested, ”students

fshould take stock of themselves}

remarks to a close by calling fort

, The drinking rule at that time

there has been a gradual slack.
lening of enter-cement. .

Other rules which have been
changed during the adminisll‘ar
tion of President Bowen are the

tear rule and the library rules.
Until scvcral years ago library
stacks were closed to students.
Rifles against smoking have
been maintained in some build-
ings because of the difficulties
of housekeeping and the danger
of tire. While there is no ad-
ministrative rule about pre ing,
the administration is deﬁ itely
against it on the grounds that
lprepping restricts the freedom
of those being prepped.

Some improvements that have
been made in the condition of
the campus were also mentioned
by the presidcnh Sidewalks have
been built and grass has been
planted. The campus, he pointed
out, has been transformed from
a patch of mud and weeds to a
place of some beauty,

From Jrlle President:

Since my remarks to the

lenders oi student government

on November 26 and to the
Student Senate on December
5, I have been asked: What
did you really mean?

What i meant was that 'n
the area of conduct and citi—
zenship, it is time for Gzinnell
students to be thinking about
their responsibilities as well
as their freedoms. to be con»
sidering the welfare and good
mate of the college as well
as their personal convenience.

I asked that the entire stile
dent body engage in a respon-
sible discussion of the student
way of life. This discussion
would be a prelude to any

further consideration of
changes in rules. I pointed
out that the basic objective
or this discussion should be
a consjdelgd deﬁnition of rea-
sonable norms of behavior for
a group of gifted studmits
who are destined to be future
leaders in American society,
Once our students (and tac-
ulfyl have considered this is—
sue, and have reached some
consensus as to what constit-
tutes an acceptable way of
life at Grinneil in the 1960’s.
then we shall be in a better
position to consider rules and
procedures of enforcement.

The fact is that at the present time the student lcation to stimulate and challenge

weakness lies not so much in the arguments for dents ‘

President Bowen is in a position where he can go
before the Senate and tell them that there can be no can
sideratioll ' rule changes because in his opinion there has
been a gradual slippage in the enforcement of college rules.
Itvis pretty hard to deny thé fact that many college rules,
including major rules. are being ﬂagrantly violated.

In this context, how can we even think of proposing
that liberalization: be made in rules wliell we mllst real-

Once these statements are made we should see
that enforcement is carried out. Ill the long run, the
Cole’ member who does his job by enforcing college
rules helps those who want to change those rules by
providing for the reformer an atmosphere where the
Administration and the Board of Trustees are more
receptive to student pressures.

Another step which must be taken to bring about this

By Mike Horwatt
Stu: Columnist

The recent controversy between the students
and the Administration is perhaps the most ser—
ious since President Bowen tool: office. it is more
crucial because the President is more directly
involved.

In a ivoi-,cl he has told the student govciii-
mcnt that they cannot change the rulcs. This
means that he has bccoinc the upholdcr oi the
status quo and that those who have been most
or ical or college social policy can no longer
consider President Bowen to lie‘ the adminis-
trative iigure who really understands their
position,

Whereas bciore, President Bowen was above
controversy between the students and the Ad-
ministration, he is now in the center of it Where-
as in the past hc has urged the students to govern
themselves and has declared his willingness to
let ”sensitive” isucs be dic sed frcely, he has
now taken a most risliv pos on. he. hiniscll has
virtually said “110'Y t0 the students.

CERTAINLY THE President of the College has
a right to say no. But when he says no, when
he runs counter to his 'past pronouncements, he
must expect rcsistance, and protest with an equal
degree of certainty. To avoid a serious crisis, it
would be advisable tor him to reconsider his
position.

Now lot us examine the issues which are
involved in the controversy. They are three:
establishing a balance of interests between the
students and the Administration: upholding the
autonomy ot the college; deciding what kind oi
college Grinncll ought to be,

THE FIRST: defining and balancing the ins
tcrcsts bctwcen the students and administration
is the most important of the three, Because stu-
dent government removes troni the college Iinan-
cial and administrative responsibility by its gov.
ernmental activities (hall government, social
planning, etc) it has a right to demand that
its interests be duly recognized. One of its in-
teicsls is formulating legislative policy which
they must cniorcc and which they and their
constituents ought to believe in.

THE SECOND ISSUE: is to what degree the

College will Iccl obligated, at best, to comprise,
and at worst to pander to the opinio -, attitudes
and demands oi the outside community. 0r inorc
important, what Will be the cost to the educa-
tional process and intellectual integrity of the
college.

This is an issuc because the Pl'eucloni. has
argued that the reputation of the College would
be deinangcd by changes in the rules. This is
especially true because the College's “moi-a1"
reputation is suttei-ing at the present time.

In terms of the whole College this issue has
the most lar reaching and significant implicate

tions.

Do we become a rctlcction or outside wishes,
attitudes and jpil‘ilons or do we insist that the
College is not going to sacriiice ts autonomy.
By doing the latter people get used to giving
the College money without expecting to inilucnce
it. Parents get used to sending their children
here without telling administiatois what rules
they must oi must have.

THE THIRD ISSUE is what hind 01 college
do we want? President Bowcn wants intellectual
nonmonformlly. In this sense he is a liberal and
progressive man, He has been courageous in de-
tending academic lrecdoin, He has not bowed to
the Red-baitcrs In this area he has excelled and
it is in this arca that the College has made the
most progress. '

On the other hand, he is at the same time a
social conservative l-lis morality and social plu-
losophy aie his own. He is trying to impose his
own personal standards on the personality oi
the campus The question is: is this duality ol
intellectual non-conformity but social conformity
possible for the College and, it it is possible,
is it desirable?

Now we come to the more diIlicult question
oi what kind at college the students want. Do
they want an authoritarian or aiia‘rchistio en—
vironment? Do they want authority or tree-
(10111? It they want a mixture, in what iii-o-
portions? The students have not given this
question adequate attention. They have not

taken the matter seriously.
Up to this point, we have assessed the his
poi-tance of the

present controversy, identiticcl

the mayor issues connected with it. What remains .
is to lind out why the controversy could develop
and how it is going to be resolved.

President Bowen asserted administrative
authority because of perceived pressure irom
outside sources and because cl his deeply iclt
ideals and values. He was ablc to teal free to do
so because at the tiuiidity, passivity, apathy and
lack of leadership demonstrated by the student
body.

THE APATHY is largely a product 01 either
indifference or emotional Withdraxl'al. Last year
involvement with the question of nuclear testing
drained many students of their concern, their
energy and tlicir willingness to hccome engaged.

lndiiterence has resulted primarily Ironi too
many students not caring about Grinnoll Col;
lege and/or not feeling they can do much to
bring about change. Another reason is that they
are not aware oi what is happening or what the
important issues really are.

To a lesser extent, academic pressure has
contributed to apathy and Indifference,

Indifference and apathy are. to some degree.
a product or inadequate student leadership.

Let us take the Student Government Asso-
ciation President and the President of the CotHP.
'Al Boston and Steve l-lowcll are, in many rc-
spects, creative, liberal and progressive thinkers.
They have had many constructive ideas and pro»
posals which they have attempted to implement

Why then have they tailed? They have failed
because they have addressed themselves to
select individnls and committees. Instead of
Iirst coining before the student body with their
proposals, they have gone to the administration.

For example, Howell spent seven weeks study-
ing 'the drinking rule, composed a lifleen page,
single-spaced analysis accompanied with recom-
mendations. Instead of coming before the student
body, to generate an issue, to foster discussion.
and to muster support, he went directly to the
Administration.

Briley, went to Dr. Bowen, alter the women’s

faced a tight zone which lorced
