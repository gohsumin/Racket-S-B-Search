A trilogy dealing with .the

The first drama, “A Tale of

man. “Though an undercurrent
of humanity and sadness runs
through it, it tends to laugh
away oppression.”

A tone of “gentle criticism"

Continue Russian!

Russian ranks as one of the most important
languages that American students can learn. In scienti-
fic and diplomatic areas, a knowledge of Russian is
vital. Nor does it look like this language will decrease
in popularity in the near future.

Yet Grinnell has cut down its Russian language
program. No Russian—not even first year Russian——
will be offered next year. Those students who have
completed one year of Russian will continue with a
course of Russian literature in translation. Those who
have completed two years of Russian and who need a
third year to fulfill a combination Russian studies-
Russian language major are simply out of luck.

Several aspects of the decision to drop all Russian
courses need critical examination.

First, potential Russian studies-Russian language
majors were not notified until this week that their
major seemingly had been dropped, There is little
hope for these students of transferring to another
school at this date. The only solution that could be
offered by those in charge was a change of majors. It
seems rather curious simply to ask a student to change
his plans for the future on such short notice.

Second, the claim that there is a scarcity of quali-
fied instructors can be disputed. Those in charge have
had over a year to locate a replacement for this year’s
interim instructor, Lauren Leighton. Furthermore, with
the increasing emphasis on Russian, graduate schools
are turning out more people capable of teaching Rus-
sian. Leighton has said that he believes there are a
great many qualified Russian instructors. He noted
that he knew of several persons who have completed
their Ph. D. course work and who are looking for jobs.
Some of these people have been seeking employment in
Iowa. Leighton also said that Grinnell has a good
enough reputation that it shouldn’t have trouble at-
tracting competent people to teach Russian.

Third, those in charge have said that this decision
doesn’t preclude reinstating the program in the future,
but they would make no commitments. Grinnell is a
good enough school that it should not want to damage
its image by dropping such an important course as
Russian from its curriculum, even for a year.

Because of the importance of Russian in the mod-
ern world, because several students vitally need Rus-
sian for their major, because Grinnell should be able
to attract a qualified instructor, and because Grinnell’s
image demands that this course not be dropped, we
ltrongly urge those in charge to reconsider their deci-
sion and to make an all-out effort to unploy a Russian
instructor on a permanent basisAstarting this fall.

Kurash Angered Over Student Senate Pizza Purchase;
Opposes Such ‘Theft of Student Funds' In The Future

To the Editor:

My main hope in this letter
is that my anger after reading
the article in last. week‘s 5&3
(regarding the budget passed
by the SGA) does not cause me
to go astray and obliterate the
point I plan to make.

I am referring specifically to
the paragraph concerning Mari-
lyn Alt’s motion appropriating
ten dollars for the purchase of
pizza to sustain our fine student
senate in their trials and trib-
ulations so that they could con-
Linue their outstanding work.
Following are 5 reasons why I
feel that this theft of student
funds can never be allowed to
happen again,

1) The passing of this motion,
though obviously done in time
well spent, could very conceiv-
ably lead to more and more
long, drawnrout, and bogged
down senate meetings. Any
student taking the introductory
course in psychology knows
that by positively reinforcing
the inability of [his body to
function by feeding their food-
deprived little bellies will
greatly increase the probability
of this happening again. In
deed, the senate could easily be
conditioned in this way to have
extra-long meetings all the
time.

2) The students of Grinnell
College have often and right-
lully complained about the
quality of the movies brought
here for our viewing. Ten dol-
lars for the information of the
SGA, can make the difference
between Grinnell’s usual Grade

why a student committee? Per-
haps because the students here
are alraid to voice an opinion
without the auspices of some
fatherly student committee.
Grinnell students are afraid!
The student leaders have done
llltle to remove this fear. Per-
haps they never will lead us«
lead us to lead Ourselves indi-
vidually. What, then, do the
student leaders do? Perhaps
they just stand in the limelight
for a year per office to die ben-
efit of no one except maybe
their own egos. But SGA is not
all folly. The senate drew up a
budget and neatly balanced the
last three figures to a nice,
even 5500,

The solution to ten-elevenths
of Grinnells “problems" lies
with each individual student.
Introspection rattler than cir-
cumspection. In other words,
“Grinnell students, get off your
dead ends and do’somethingl
Pull the silver spoons nut oi
your mouths and try to stand
on your own two feet.” Abolish
inactivity, abolish nonprogress,
perhaps even abolish SGA, the

anything like (hat. We must
blunder along blindly on this
road of stalemate.

Ralph Mintel ,

About ten to one. Ten stu-
dents in one member of the
faculty and/or administration.
From a purely mamematical
approach, chances are ten to
one that any given fault with
the Grinnell College commun-
ity lies with the students. In the
past two years (and possibly
even more than two years)
there has been an abundance of
criti sm of the faculty and/or
administration, While there has
been little criticism of the stu-
dent body. Perhaps it is time
for every Grinnellian to reeval-
uale the situation. On this cam-
pus there is a lack or serious
interest in progress. The solua
tion lies with each indlvidual
student here.

The lack of interest in pro-
gress is perhaps a lack of self-
motlvaiion within the students.
Most students here desire an
authoritarian director'a direer
tor to lead him from all trou-
bles, to guide and_to keep on
guiding, but never to let the
student stand for himself. An
outsider might comment that
the students sure are busy here.
Yes, we are busy—busy doing
nothing for ourselves. The so-
called “academic pressure" is
a good example of the lack of
selfvdrive. The student feels as
if he is fighting everyone else,
including the faculty. How ab-
surd! Were the students deeply
involved in work, both academ-
ic and extra-academic. there
would be no pressure. This false
atmosphere is created by the
students, not by the faculty.

SGA is a prime example of
the lack of serious interest in
progress. And SGA is made up
of studenu, not college admin-
istrators. In the past two years
there has been a big hullabaloo
over rules, changes, etc. For
two years the car rule has been
tossed back and forth. The

Student Issues Secondary To Main Business Of college

In the Editor;

This letter is a request from
one of your long time readers

gold up for the year. No, I am

that were the case this would

time during the year. It is sim<
ply that here in Karachi are

ure about June first We also

eem far removed from you in
nieresls and issues, for your
problems as reflected in the
columns of the 5&3 are very
different from those of Pakis-
tani students. Like a college,
a college here is a collection of
students (.9) and a University
is a collection of colleges, best
described by C. P. Snow in the
appendix to his book “The Mas-
iers”:

. “The University offered noth-

gig but leclul'es to which the

,oys went if they pleased.—
Their time was their own, to
talk, gamble, drink, fornicate.
,—Tlle students liked their ' e,
bul no one else did. Certainly
not the townspeople, nor the
students’ parents, nor the more
bookish and domesticated of the
gtudents themselves. So, almost

run] the origin of the Universi-
ty, there were attempts to get
them out of their lonely lodg-
ings into hoarding houses.”

Hence in the American Col-
lege the dormitory-hotel as<
geci now dominates the scene,

reates most of the student
problems, and commands most
of their attention, Not so in

 

Pakistan. There are no resi-
dences, only the University as
described by C. P. Snow and
the students’ chief concerns are
with the administration of the
university itself and with the
practical politicians who con-
trol it. It was within this setting
that Mrs. Gale, Charles and I
visited Dacca in East Pakistan
late in March. I was to partici»
pate in a Seminar at the Uni-
versity of Dacca and to lecture
at the Government College in
Sylhet, up near the Assam bor-
der,

The nonrstop flight over India

being subsidized by the govern»
merit as this is one of the main

Saturday expecting to attend
the University convocation on
Sunday with our host, a Ful-
brighter in Journalism. By the
time that he met us the Ful-
brighters, among others, had
been advised to stay away
from the convocation as the
students were planning an anti-
administration demonstration,
either during or following the
ceremony. As an alternative,
we visited the museum which
is near the University lecture
hall.

Our visit was interrupted by
the sound of gun-fire, and from
the museum Windows we could
see the mobs gathering. :itur

Rationale of Concert, Dance Choices
Explained by King, Culver - New Heads

{to the Editor:

There seems to be a misun-
derstanding on the part of
some students concerning the
dances and concerts held on
our campus. The formal
dances, in fact, are sponsored
by [lie Gadabouts committee,
an organization completely
separate in personnel and budg-
et from the Concerts commit-
fee.

The rationale behind having
8 “big name” band for dances
is as follows: Based on the
cost per student attending a
dance, it is cheaper to have a
wellrknown band than a “0.
name one. Leaving personal
preferences aside, more stu-
dents participate in formal
dances when big bands play,
especially in the spring, than
when small hands are booked.

As for the concerts, the come
mittee offers five concerts a
year, usually two in joint spon-
sorship with the music and
drama departments (this year,
“Brecht on Brecht” and the
Korean Dance Group.) Here in
Iowa it is very difficult to
find a recognized symphony or-
chestra that will tour this way,
and often the cost is very pro»
hibitlve. With the music depart-
menl, however, we have tried
to offer a symphony every oth-
or year. A year ago we had

 

the St, Louis Symphony, and
next year we are planning on
the Warsaw Philharmonic.

Jazz, too, is a difficult prob-
lenl. In the past, concerts ofr
fered by the Modern Jazz Quar~
tel. and Dizzy Gillespie were,
campusrwide, not successfull
Nor can Darby Gym be said to
be a good place to hear such
music, and more performances
in Roberts to seat everyone cost
much more money.

Vocal jazz, with groups such
as Lambert, Hendricks, and
Bavan seem to be able to trau-
scend the airplane-hangar ef-
fect better than other styles.
Furlller, since only three con-
certs remain to be scheduled
after cooperating With the
other campus departments, it
seems unwise to give more
than one concert in the jazz
idiom if a balanced program is
[0 be maintained.

It is hoped that the proposed
social increase that is to be pre»
sented to the trustees will enr
able the various social com-
mitlees to meet the rapidly l‘lS-
ing costs and to present the
campus with high quality
events.

much property was damaged,
many students badly hurt, and
as near as our journalism friend
could determine later some
students were killed, hence the
reference in the following
newspaper appeal to “murder-
ous assaults." The day follow-
ing, the University was offi-
cially closed, probably until
next September. Tlle examina-
tions for which the students
were preparing were postponed
indefinitely. Our own seminar
was rescheduled at the United
Sta t e 5 Information Service,
with only partial success, Two
weeks later, April 5, the Morn-
ing News Carried the following
appeal to the students [mm the
University teachers:

“DACCA, April 4; The teache
81‘s in the Dacca University
have appealed to the student
community to l'ealile the gravid
tyrof the present situation and ,
help create an atmosphere in

which “our alma mater can
function normally again."
in a statement signed by its
‘ teachers, they said “if the stu-
dents felt that the work of the
University was of paramount
importance to the life of the
community, they would certain-
ly, not want the forces of evil
and darkness to triumph. Ev-
eryone would like the Universi-
ty to be rescued mm this posi-

 

 

tion."

The teachers pointed out that
no one could be happy over the
‘unlonuuate’ circunls t a u c e a
which had led to the closing of
the University of patch. It was
impossible to conceive of any
‘sulle persnn’ approving of what
was done by . ‘section of stu-
dellts' at this year’s convocation

 

and thereafter. That differences
of opinion among the students
should result in ‘lnurderous as-
saults’ on one another was a
thing which ran counter to All
notions of civilized conduct.

The teachers believed that
every student shared the feet
illgs of “horror, dismay and
pain" with which they had
viewed those developments
which had “lowered the preslige
of the University in the eyes of
the world." The real issue was
whether the University should
be allowed to be wrecked in
that fashion.

Concluding, they urged the
guardians to exercise their ins
fluence with their wards so that
the University might resume
its Work and once again play its
role as a seat of learning and
cultural”

There is not time nor space
to present the grievances be-
hind the student riots, well
founded as some of them may
be. The object of my letter is
to point up student government
at its Worst. The University all
year had been obstructed by
numerous holidays, scheduled
and otherwise; prolonged vaca-
firms, often one hundred per
cent absenteeism, riots and
strikes so that our host Ful-
brighter had by this late date
in March met only 38 classes
since arriving last September
and now the University was
closed. The year before had
been similar but the authorities
had expected a better year.
Fortunately, conditions in West
Pakistan are better and the
Universities are less controlled

 

by the students.

i
This letter is prompted by
the February 28th issue of tho
5&3 which ’has just arrived,
and which is devoted to the an-
nual student elections. My n1)—
peal to you Grinnell students in
to arrive at reasonable areas
of student government which
are not too demanding of time
and energy. For whatever the
issues, be they open houses or
quad closing hours or open
cars for everybody, they are
secondary to the main business
of the college which is why you
and I are at Grinnell. It is said
here that 80 per cent of the
populace is illiterate and of the
remaining 20 per cent, eighty
per cent work for the govern<
merit and are hence pretty well
muffled. Of the twenty per cent
literate nonrgovernmeilt group
eighty per cent are students.
Eighty per cent of the students
spend eighty per cent of their
time on practical politics, devel.
oping cleavages easily coir
trolled by pressure groups.

I sometimes feel that there is
a small very vocal group of
students at Grinnell whose
minority voice is heard out of
proportion to its place on the
campus. I hope that student
government can be at its best at
Grinnell, representative of most
of you, for I have great faith
in most of you—but not all of
you,

Miscellany and Digression

By Tom Fullmer

Today we take you to a city
in Kentucky where the leaders
of an integration movement
are holding a meeting. The
group leader is speaking. Two
men listen.

LEADER: Well, gentlemen,
what are your thoughts on this
frogram of action I have out-
ined for next yearl‘

FIRST MEMBER: As I see
It, the program seems to be a
repetition and extension of last

ear’s program with the one
major change being the addi-
tion of that special target you
talked about.

SECOND MEMBER! About
that special target, I really
wonder Whether this should be
part of our program. After all,
we've never done anything this
radical before.

LEADER: This is true. How-
ever, let’s Climb the hill and
look at its from topside. There
,is perhaps no other institution
In American society as segre-
gated as this one. It has man-
aged to exploit this segregation
for profit. Even its name sug-
gests segregation

FIRST MEMBER: Yes, but
can we get our membership to
support a nationwide program
of action? Won’t they consider
this as just an isolated case of
legregation?

LEADER: I thought of that
too. But let’s follow this into
the high grass and see what it
gets. We have been constantly
emphasizing the bad publicity
which the U. 5. receives abroad
because of segregation. No
other segregated institution gets
anywhere near the publicity
abroad as our special target.
It has gotten much play behind
the Iron Curtain.

FIRST MEMBER: I see. If
we can get integration here
then the rest of the world will
believe there is nothing which
cannot be integrated.

SECOND MEMBER: Let’s
not get too confident here. Re-
member; these will be some

retty big boys we’re going to

e fighting. Every year at-
tempts are made to beat this
group. They thrive on beating

roups from a different race.

ave we got a person who can
successfully integrate them?

LEADER: When We first
dropped this into the well to see
if it would swim this was a
problem that received our ut-
most attention. I've talked to
the man I think can do the job.

‘ He realizes that he is going to
be pushed, and tripped, and el-
bowed as he tries to do his job,
but he is big and willing to lake
It.

SECOND MEMBER: The big
thing we’re going to have to
fight is the image of superior
ity they have built over the
years. We all know this is fic-
tion, but they have that record
which looks good on paper.

FIRST MEMBER: I think
everyone realizes this. Our big-
gest job will be to get this to a
court. If we can do this we Will
have succeeded.

LEADER: That’s true if Once
there we can‘get the ball to

 

bounce our way. Well, gentle-
men, can I count on your sup-
port for this special project?

BOTH: Certainly. One hun-
dred per cent.

LEADER: All right, we will
start immediately.

(At this instant a young Ne—
gro bursts breathlessly into the
room.)

NEGRO: I’m sorry I'm late.
I had a little trouble getting
served by that vending ma-
chine in our office. This is bhe
first meeting I’ve missed since
I helped organize this group.
What did we decide today?

SCARLET AND BLACK

By John Wolf

The effect of natural root
grafting in trees is being stud-
ied on a college-owned farm
northeast of Grinnell by Ben
Graham (biol.) With the help of
a grant from the National Sci»
ence Foundation.

Graham explained that "trees
in forests b e o o m e united
through their root systems.
Once united they are able to
transfer water, diseases, and
nutrients between one another.
There are as many as 25-30
trees in such a union.

“Our prime objective is to
determine the significance of
these unions. We have 5000
trees of white pine, red pine,
Austrian pine, and Norway
spruce planted in various ar-
rangements to determine the
effect of species and spacing."

The trees in the nursery were
purchased in 1960 when they
were two years old. Some root
grafting was already notice-
able. .

“We hope to work out a tech-
nique to check on the extent of
grafting without having to dig
up the roots. This summer we
will begin on a radioactive
tracing techinque.”

Graham Went on to explain
the significance of this experi»
ment. “Tile concept in the past
has been that trees are discrete
organisms. In actuality, a tree
in a forest cannot be treated
as a separate organism.

“Foresters have trouble with
‘backflash’; when thinning trees
by poison, the poison often is
circulated to neighboring trees
by root grafts, Dutch elm
disease and oak wilt are also
known to be transmitted in this
way.

”We also plan to check the
results of some Russian expere
merits in root grafting. Russian
foresters have tried ‘nest plant-
ing‘s,’ in which clumps of trees
are planted and allowed to
grow until their roots are
grafted. Then all but the most
vigorous tree are cut away.
This tree, with its extra root
systems. is studied. Some Rus-
sian reports have claimed that
the added system is beneficial;
others say this added system is
parasitic."

Jim Frank, senior, has done
an independent project on root
grafts in a stand of white pine
near Amana. Frank checked
the rate of growth in stumps
which were grafted to living
trees. To Graham's surprise,

Frank found none.

“We thought that some
growth would be detected in
those stumps,” Graham said.
“This phenomenon is observed
quite often. For example, in
New Hampshire we found that
80-year-old stumps in one
stand still had live roots
grafted to living trees. These
stumps still exhibited diamet-

Grinnell Joins National Student Drive Tomorrow
for John F. Kennedy Memorial Library in Boston

Spontaneous requests by col-
lege students on many cam-
puses have resulted in the ore
gamzation of a National Student
Committee for the proposed
$10 million John Fitzgerald
Kennedy Library in Boston.

The National Committee is
presently coordinating student
d r i v e s on 2,100 campuses
throughout the nation as their
part in the public campaign to
raise the necessary funds Dave
Evans has been appointed
chairman oi the Kennedy Li-
brary Committee to direct the
drive at Grinnell, .

Evans has announced that
the Grinnell drive will com-
mence tomorrow and close on
Saturday, May Is. The object
of the drive on the Grinnell
campus is twofold: to raise sig-
natures and funds for a special
studentgiven memorial within
the Library. Any student or
member of the iaculty or staii
that would like to actively sup-
port the construction oi this
memorial is urged to sign the

fluence on the youth of Amer-
ica are the only criteria (or
signing this book; people who
are unable to donate are still
urged to sign, When bound, the
Grinnell College book will be
deposited permanently in the
Library.

The site of the Library on the
banks of the Charles River in
Mr. Kennedy's native city was
chosen by him shortly before
his death. The building, in ad-
dition to an austere and beau—
tiful memorial room, will in-
clude several working compo-
nents: a Museum, an Archive
and an Institute. On comple-
tion, the Library will he turned
over to the United States Gov»
ernment to be operated as part
of the National Archives.

According to the Corporation

the Library will further one of
President Kennedy’s deepest
concerns — his continuing at~

The delegates issued a report
supporting 1) already existing
organizations engaged in dis-
tributing fertility regulation in-
formation, 2) the distribution
by public agencies of informa-
tion on fertility regulation to
those who request it, 3) the
legalizing of voluntary steriliza-
tion and of the distribution and
purchase of birth control de-
vices in states where such
practices are not now legal, and
4) ohe expansion of education
concerning the population situa-
tion.

While the report held that
population growth does not
pose an urgent problem in the
United States at the present
time, it concluded that in the
light of demographic predic-
tions, a population policy should
be initiated by this country.
Such policy should be based on
the concepts of voluntary par-
ticipation, recognition of indi-
vidual values, increased re-
search on fertility control meth-
ods, and careful consideration
of legalizing abortion and ster-
ilization.

The report also called for

programs to conserve scenic
areas for future generations,
opposed a suggestion that in-
come tax exemptions be denied
when families exceed some
specified number of children,
and expressed confidence in
the capacity of the U. S. econ-

.Turning to the world scene,
the report took note of the role
of population in economic de-

world peace and security, and
recommended that the U. S.
give priority in its foreign aid
program to those countries in
which economic development
is not keeping pace with popu-
lation growth. The United
States should also provide, on
request, aid to underdeveloped

Anku Investigates Ghana's Non-Alignment Foreign Policy

By Vince Anku

Some Americans believe that
small nations must either be
for them or against them. This
is not true. Ghanaians contend
that neither power block is per-
manently right and so they
cannot irrevocably belong to
either camp. Ghanaians wish to
live peaceably with all coun—
tries irrespective of their polit-
ical ideology. To this and Ghana
a nonvalignment policy. Ghana
adopts a non-alignment policy.
Ghana has not invented non-
alignment policy. "Thomas Jef-
ferson, a great American,
advocated non-alignment pol-
icy of America some 174]
years ago. He said inconnection
with American foreign policy,
‘Peace, commerce, and honest
friendship with all nations, en-
tangling alliances with none.’ ”
(Nkrumah's radio address.
Dec, 22, 1961)

Defendng Nkrumah’s “Afri-
can Socialism” against un-
founded charges of Commu-
nism, St. Clair Drake of Chica—
go made some pertinent re-
marks. Drake was a professor
of sociology in Ghana for some
two and one-half years. He is
now the director of the African
Studies Program at Roosevelt
University. He argued that

 

Ghanas foreign policy, not her
socialistic orientation, is a
more valid criterion for accu-
sation.

“. . . At the U. N. Ghana has
always voted against the Rus-
sian idea of a trolka to replace
the Secretary General, but it
also votes for admission of Red
China. It has repeatedly re<
buked both sides for dragging
heels on the banning of nuclear
tests.

During the Cuban crisis,
Ghana delegates expressed
sympathetic understanding in
the United States’ fears, but op-
posed an invasion of Cuba. It
did not go along with Cuba‘s
attempt to have a renewed Se-
curity Council debate on the is-
sue. There is absolutely no
substance at all to Senator
Dodd's charge that Nkrumah
has “consistently supported the
Soviet Union and Cuba in the
U. N.” ‘ .

Americans who object to the
policy of ‘positive nonalign—
ment,’ African socialism, the
one party state, and militant
Pan-Africanism, have a tend-
ency to label all of these orien-
tations ‘Communism’ as do
Ghanaians who prefer other
political styles. This simply
confuses the issue.

The crucial question from

 

the American foreign policy
standpoint is not whether the
Ghanian government is author-
itarian the United States sup-
ports the governments of Li-
beria and various other African
authoritarian states — nor
whether it is socialistic — the
United States helped to finance
Clement Attlee’s Labour gov-
ernment and Tito’s Commun-
ism—Pan-Africanism is not a
Communistic movement and is
no menace to the United
States.

The relevant questions are:
‘Does Ghana have an independ-
ent foreign policy not tied to
that of the U. S. S. R. or Chi-
na?’ and 'ls it likely to keep
that orientation?‘ A careful
study of Ghana and its leader
might produce a positive an-
swer to both questions. . . ."
(New York Times, July 30, 1963,
23:4)

A short while ago, speaking
on the tenth anniversary of
"Positive Action," a non-Vio-
lent-movement for independ-
ence, President Nkrumah made
a similar remark:

“I must emphasize that our
party’s foreign policy contin-
ues to be based upon positive
neutralism and non—alignment.
We are convinced that by our
policy of non-alignment we are

 

able to speak our minds, frank-
ly and without fear and favour
on issues as they arise. Our
positive stands are based on
our own convictions, complete-
1y uninfluenced by any of the
power blocs. We believe that
we could help bridge the unfor»
tunate and undesirable gap be-
tween the so-called East and
West bloc by not aligning our-
selves with either side. . . . We
hold the view that as to the
issues between them, neither
bloc can claim to be perma—
nently ,right or permanently
wrong. We should be free to
take our stand without previ-
ously committing ourselves to
any bloc on any matters which
affect the peace, progress,
and indeed, the destiny of Af-
rica. We believe that it would
be suicidal to involve our
selves in the disputes of the
great powers by taking sides.
We will continue to cultivate
and maintain friendly relations

Ghana is thus able to put for-
ward unbiased proposals for
the settlement of specific is-
sues. Ghana's policy on three
specific issues—China’s admis-
sion to the U. N., the nuclear
disarmament, and the Middle
East problem—which current-

 

ly affect World Peace can
serve as examples of Ghanian
thinking.

As regards the Middle East,
Ghana is concerned with the
long range problem of the de-
pressed masses of me Arab
countries, and the short range
problem of the Arab-Israel ten-
sion. At the 1960 General As-
sembly of the U. N. President
Nkrumah bluntly stated one‘ of
the most important underlying
conflicts in the Middle East.
He urged Western powers to
stop exploiting the oil resources
of the Middle East, for “as long
as these powers continue to ex«
ploit the oil resources of thl
Middle East on a competitive
basis, the friction resulting
from a clash of the economic
and commercial interests is
bound to endanger the peace of
mankind." Without favouring
either Israel or the Arab States.
Ghana asked the United Nan
tions to set up a committee to
study and develop political man
chinery which would make it
impossible either for Israel to
attack the Arab states or fot
the Arab States to attack
lsrael. The committee should

Jones Emphasizes Need for 'Play'.
Sequeira: Praciicaliiy of lib. Arts

By Susan Taylor

“This college might well in
this age when knowledge is
power and learning is work,
seek to retain something at the

liberating effect of play," Alan
Jones thst.) told a student and,
flicuity audience last Friday
ntorning in his chapel lecture
piesentation,

Jones and Leforne Sequeira,
Director of Placement and Stu-
dent Aid, were presented by
the Board of Religion as a part:
of a series of speakers on the
topic “The Ends and Means of
a Liberal Arts Education." Se-
qt eira took a different approach
to the subject in his address,
ailserting that “a liberal arts
education is perhaps the most
p-actical of all experience”

Jones, defining “play” as
“noneserious activity, volun-
tary free activity,‘ traced the
origins of the university back
to the Middle Ages Tradition-
ally on a university campus, he
said, one found the mood “of
Excitement and enjoyment”
with few material worries, the
“gift of an interlude" to the
young man, a ”community
where one can be free.”

Asserting that Grinnell had
its origins in this tradition, as
well as in the American Prat;
'estant tradition which poses a
challenge to it by stressing
moral action, Jones considered
the American Liberal Arts Col
lege in the twentieth century:
“The twentieth century with all
its terrible seriousness poses a
serious challenge to liberal arts
education defined as intellec»
tual play. Few colleges have
been able to resist this chal-
lenge. Grinnell has not.”

in a “world of power and
profit and professionalism," he
said, work, not play seems the
dominant note on the liberal
arts college campus. College
experience is seen as having, of
necessity, a link to the out-
side world. Students strive for
academic excellence—with an
emphasis on action and seri—
ousness of their “work”—-rath-
er than for intellectual excel-
lence and learning, in an enjoy-

able and carefree context. for
its own sake

“Much of this is inevitable
and much is good,” Jones said.
But “The emphasis on work
must, be combatted with re~
lief'réd emphasis on play."

"‘1 would plead for more hu-
mor and less seriousness" on
our college campus,“ he con»
cluded, "not because the world
is not serious, but because it
is.”

Sequeira, relating the liberal
arts education to post-graduate
activities, whether in business
or graduate school, said that
because of the vagueness of
its tradition, the benefits of a
liberal arts education are long
in coming He called this edu-
cation “something that’s much
bigger than the sum of the
parts.”

He said that in living in a
changing world, the education—
al experience which produces
a packaged skill is not as val-
uable as the liberal arts exper»
ience.

Referring to its practicality,
Sequeira said “The liberal tins
education is simply living and
learning. It becomes an explor—
ation of the world of ideas. You
get excited about wanting to
learn. The product or the end
turns out to he that kind of
man who can simply use his
head.” .

Speaking of the pressure
which always leads the student
toward the idea of success, he
questioned, “Is a Grinnell stu-
dent getting what’s necessary
to develop the capacity to fail,
and the resilience to bounce
back?”

“People who are uninformed
about their own potential as
people have missed something
of the liberal arts education,”
he said “Businesses are hir-
ing whole people with an ability
to grow and expand.”

The play necessary in this
education is that which enables
the student to relate learning to
the social context, to make
judgments and decisions, to
run the risk of making mis-
takes, he said.

“The ends and the means

’are exactly the same,” Seque-

Oificinls Announce
Housing Regulation
For Commencement

Those making housing plans
for commencement would like
to call special student attention
to the following statement from
the college catalogs:

“The college remains in ses
sion throughout the period of
Commencement and Alumni
programs During this time, col-
lege social regulations remain
in effect. All underclassmen,
except those with special per—
mission, are required to vacate
college and town residence
rooms and to leave the town of
Grinnell by the morning follow-
ing their last examination."

To permit the Housekeeping
Depaitment to prepare rooms
for guests by Thursday, June
4, students classified in the
statement above must vacate
their rooms and leave Grinnell
before noon, on the day follow-
ing their last examination.

Mary G. Jones, Alumni Sem
retary, asks all underciassmen
who are not staying throughout
Commencement day on some
special assignment to cooper-
ate promptly with this ruling
"With the size of the present
senior class. we are expecting
more parents and guests than
in other years," said Miss
Jones. “it is my hope that we
can find rooms for them as
well as for the many alumni
who return for reunions. But
unless the departing under-
classmen vacate their rooms as
quickly as possible, we shall be
hard»pressed to make our guests
comfortable.“

The last meal in the dining
room for underclassmen stu-
dents will be breakfast, Tues-
day, June 2. Badges will be
needed for entrance into the
dining room for lunch Tuesday
and throughout the remainder
of Commencement week These

Animal Life -:-

By Don Kurasch
“Rain, rain, go away;

Come again some other
day. . ."

This song was emotionally
sung in the hearts of each and
every one of the brave 1M
athletes who last weekend had
to face the nightmarish reality
of being rained. out of the Track

and Golf meets. Many a quiver
ing lip and dampened cheek
was seen on North campus, and
many of these otherwise non—
emotional men, who had so self-
lessly given up smoking and
done their pushups and squat-
thrusts daily for months and
months in preparation for this
momentous weekend, were giv-
en to uncontrollable tantrums.

Why, practically every night
I saw the golfers going out to
the golf course to daily check
the layout of the course. And
the tracksters usually joined
them for the exercise, and I
understand they made out real
well,

Just last Tuesday night I saw.
some of the really mature,
brave, aild bold lM athletes
getting into shape by pelting
Cowles hall with mudballs. and
I realized how very clever lhe

 

animals oi North campus can

be when they really try. Shame
on those who accused these
stalwart souls of regression.

Well, today and tomorrow
are the Golf and Track meets,
and if the prayers of all North
campus ainmals are answered,
there will be no rain. I do hope
those prayers are answered.

As far as softball goes, I’m
really not too sure, As near as
I can tell, the standings are
relatively unchanged; the
numbers in the win-lose col-
umn are just a little bigger.
I’ll try to ﬁnd out by next
week exactly how the animal
heap stands.

Until then, fellow animals,
cheer up—Spring Day is com-
ing soon,

Pioneers Hold Own
In Weekend Meel

By Pete Kollman

Grinnell's cindermon held
their own in the University di-
vision of the Sioux City Relays
last Friday in Sioux City, South
Dakota. Competing against such‘
schools at Drake, SCI and
South Dakota University, the
Pioneers had two 2nds, a 3rd
and a fourth in the relays they
entered.

The Also-relay team placed 3rd
behind South Dakota and SCI.
Clyde Smith, Mike Dewitt, Ron
Schachel and Tom DcBerg 00!.
cred the distance in 44.0

In the mile relay, the Pio-
neers ran into some stiff coma
petition and their 3:203 got
them only a 4th place. Bruce
Beckord, Ron Schachel, John
TeFaske and Jeri Langham
made up this team as well as
the medley relay team, which
finished 2nd in 3:3l to Drake's
new record time of 3227.2.

In the open 2-mila relay,
Grinnell was once again 2nd to
Drake. Langham, Beckord,
Winholtz and TePaska com-
bined for a time of 7:52,

There were only two individ.
ual event place winners from
Grinnell. Ron Schachel was 2nd
in the 100 yard dash, his 10.0
clocking was the same as that
of the winner, and Rod Brown,
running the best mile of his ca-
reer, was 4th in the mile run
with a time of 4:24.

Meet Knox, Monmouth

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell's diamondmen take
to the road again this weekend
as they journey to Illinois in an
attempt to get back in me win
column and sidetrack the pen-
nant hopes of the Knox Siwash.
The Pfitschrnen tangle with
Knox today and move on to
Monmouth for a doubleheader
tomorrow.

After a little over a week of
inactivity due to inclement
weather, the Pioneers took on
Coe Tuesday in a single game
at Cedar Rapids, Taking it on
the chin for the fourth straight
time, the Scarlet lost 5-1 and
are now virtually out of the
running for either of the top
two spots in the MCAC South-
em Division.

Against Coe, however, the
Grinnell hitters finally broke
out of a serious slump and.
banged out eight hits, one
more than the Kohawks, in-
cluding two doubles and a
triple. Cal Collier and John
Shierholz each chipped in a
pair of hits and accounted for
all the Scarlets' extrarbase
cloutst The only run for the
Pioneers came in the eighth on
two base hits and an error by
Coe on an attempted double
play. Denny Hanssen, who
worked the first seven innings,
took the loss. Reliefer Barry
Anderson worked the last two
frames for Grinnell.

Commenting on the game,
mentor John Piitsch said, “I
was very pleased with the bat»
ting in the Coe contest, but we
couldn't put together more than
two hits in any one inning.
We’ll have to do better than
that if we’re going to win this
weekend. Pfitsch noted that at
various times during the sea
son the Pioneers have dis-
played fine pitching and hitting
but can never synchronize the
two for any one game.

The Scarlet Will have to do
just that, however, if they want
to stop Knox today. The Purple
and Gold are riding the top
spot in the division right now
and boast an Eel conference
mark. Siwash coach Harlan:
Knosher will probably throwi

 

Doug Ziech at the Pioneers in
the game today. Ziech pitched
both ends of a twin bill here
two weeks ago and held Grin—
hell to just one run. Knosher
can also count on Marty Pschir-
rer, Tom Wingader and George
Shea to spark the hitting attack.

In the doubleheader tomor-
row the Scarlet will be fighting
it out widi Monmouth for third
place The Scots hold down a
3-6 record right now as com-
pared to Grinnelrs 3-5. Denny
Elliott and Harold Wertich, the
aces of the Scots' staff, will
most likely work Saturday’s
games. Wertich, in adition to
his 16 inning stint against Grin-
nell on April 24, is also the
leading hitter ior Monmouth
and backing him up at the plate
are Don Moore and Jerry
Young.

Pfitsch plans to start the
same lineup he’s used all sea»
son, with Steve Tilly on the
mound against Knox and Hans—
sen and Anderson to go tomorr
row.

By DAB LITTLE

The maiden form made its first appearance on the
Grinnell tennis courts April 29, in a Midwest Conference
intercollegiate contesteand this time it was legal.

Nancy McClane, 18, a Cornell freshman, played in the
number four position in the Grinnell—Cornell freshman match
and was narrowly defeated by Grinnell‘s Tim Dailey, 7v5, 3-6,
64.

The road to Nancy’s participation in that 'match could
probably be traced back through generations of female cxs
clusion from intercollegiate competition. in fact the issue
has come up more than once in the history of the Midwest
Conference,

However, the fact that Nancy played last week, and that
any female can now compete in Midwest Conference inter»
collegiate athletics, stems most recently and directly from
the furor caused one year ago by a quiet, attractive, unassum-
ing Grinnell coed named Julie Litchfield.

Julie Litchfield is a golfer—and a darn good one. She
came to Grinnell in 1963 sporting thre’e Des Moines Junior
Girls’ Golf Championships and four years of high school
girls’ golf team participation. She tried out for Grinnell’s
freshman squad and made it.

Julie played in the first match against Cornell and
whitewashed her opponent, She became the first woman ever
to participate on a Grinnell athletic team, but—her first ap~
pearance was also her last. ,

At the spring '63 meeting of the Conference Athletic
Directors it was decided that Julie was ineligible for partici
pation on the basis of a “males only” rule in the Conference
“Conduct for Sports” and an amendment to the conference
constitution was proposed that would read “all competition
in the Midwest Conference shall be limited to male athletes
only.” If passed this amendment would end all dispute—and
all female participation.

The proposed amendment was presented al the fall
meeting of faculty representatives from the ten conference
schools for ratification The amendment needed seven of the
ten votes to pass. The voting went four in favor, four against
and two abstentions. The abstentions counted as votes against
and the amendment was defeated,

Since the amendment was not ratified, Midwest Confer-
ence Commissioner Robert Ashley, Dean of Ripon College,
felt that it was the opinion of the majority of the confeience
that women ought to be allowed to compete in intercollegiate
athletic events. He overruled the “Conduct for Sports" rule
and ruled in favor of female participation.

Of course this ruling does not end the dispute. There are
many problems involved in female athletic participation and
the issue will come up for debate again and again. For the
moment, however, the women are in.

‘Escape From lnlellect'Executed;
AWS. C of HP Conveniently Absent

By Don Kurasch

In most respects, it looked
like a regular spring evening.
At 8 p.m., there were a couple
of guys playing horseshoes out—
side Younker. There were
nine or ten more playing base-

ball on Mac field. Four or five
others were practicing soccer
skills in front of Norris. But
anyone who hadn’t heard about
it by then had either been
locked in his room studying too
hard or was sick in the infirm-
ary. The word was out—“Spring
Riot tonight!”

Shortly after 8:00, a few girls
were prematur eiy being
sneaked into North campus
dorms. It was a little risky, but
it wouldn't be too long before
the C or HP and AWS were
eafely locked awayrrhe expect-
ancy was awesome; what would
it be like this year?

Then it was 8:30. Not even
the skeptics could doubt that
this was Spring Riot night now.
FI‘he house presidents were all
taken care of, the C of HP in
several of the men’s halls and
the AWS Board in the Langan

around-the bonfire on Mac
field. The important thing was
to stay in groups of two or
more so no one could be sin<
gled out as.not having a date.
Until one (he) found someone
of the opposite sex, that is.
(“I-ii." “Hi.” ”Quite a bonfire,
isn't it?" "Yeah." “Say, you
wanna come on over to the hall
with me?‘ I think there’s a
party going on, or something.”
“Sur-e.”)

Most of the girls without
dates returned home early. But
the dateless guys couldn’t let
themselves not have a,real
blast, Some talked themselves
into a drunk, A very few really
were. The “brave" ones shot
off fireworks. Several could
content themselves with bridge
games or television. Others
Went stag to the rock n’ roll
dance on the Cowles roof. A
few hid in their rooms and
dared to study.

Dorms were open—very open.
The only rules were those
“Written" then and there by
the participants.

The chances are, not many
students can be found who Will
say they didn't have a great
time, A minority really did,
The rest are convinced they
really did

In all, it was a successful
“riot." There was the antici<
pated minimum of damage and
rule breaking, But for the most
part it was reasonably well or»
ganized and executed. And if
nothing else, at least the stu-
dents could forget, just for a
precious while, what they were
working so hard to forget: they
were still at college—and. there
were still classes the next morn-
ing.
