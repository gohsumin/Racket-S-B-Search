Off-campus Residence to Close;
Dean Cites Economy, Life Style

By Jim Herzog

Grinnell‘s Dean of Men, S.
Eugene Thompson, has an-
nounced that a men’s offscamp—
us house will be closed as a
residence effective during the
college’s interim session and
that the nine male residents of
the house will be required to
move into vacant rooms on
North Campus.

in making the move, Thomp-
son said, “The house is being
closed for reasons that are
partly economic and partly
matters of good student af-
fairs administration.” He cited
the houses distance from the
campus and its difficulties in
“maintaining a wholly desir-
able style of life" as two rea-
sons lor moving the nine sen<
ior and junior men back on
campus.

The off-campus residence is
located at 1019 Park Street,
which is half a block south of
Grinnell‘s Fine Arts Center.
Like Grinnell’s three women's
and other men's off-campus
residences, the house is a ren-
ovated private home. This is
the fourth year that this house
has been used as a men's dor-
mitory.

Thompson said that the de
cision to close the off-campus
was his, and was made in con-
sultation with the business of-
fice and the acting president of
the college,

Commenting on the decision.
Thompson said the move was
a case Of “institutional neces-
sity," as “there are empty
spaces on North Campus, and
it’s thought to be good manage-
ment to move students there."

He said, “The whole idea of
residence halls is compromised
by off-campus houses,” but an
“overflow” device must be

 

used to take care of over-ad-
mission.

Thompson also said that the
change does not indicate a
move to eliminate off-campus
houses nor does it mean that
the nine men were not “taking
cane of their business."

He did, however, cite two re-
ports of rules being broken at
loll) Park Street as factors in
the decision, He said a girl had
been seen leaving the house af-
ter women’s hours and that
once the lounge had been bad-
ly messed up.

The chairman of 1019 Park
Street. Jack Hurwitz, called the
decision unfair, saying “If the

* ‘k *

excuse or reason about style
of life were real, we should
have been warned first."

Said Hurwitz, "Everything
seemed to be taking place be-
hind our backs, and we were
never sure whether the idea to
move us out of Park Street was
ﬁnancial or whether he
(Thompson) just wanted to
close up the campus. We still
don’t know whether the finan-
cial reasons were a subter-
fuge."

Hurwitz also said that the
girl seen leaving the Park
Street residence after hours
was the wife of a Grinnell
senior.

House Closed: Room Painted by 8&6;
Interior Decoration Back to Normulcy

When college officials lock

A semester-long battle be-
tween students, letter writers,
and Buildings and Grounds
over room repainting, received
a fresh touch during Christa
mas recess when Buildings and
Grounds repainted a room in
1019 Park Street.

The repainting struggle be-
gan in the fall when student
Tom Morrow, appalled by the
pink floral design of his room’s
wallpaper, painted his room
light gray, his ceiling grayish
blue, and the doors and radio-
tors black.

Equally appalled by Mor-
row’s audacity, the head of
Buildings and Grounds, Evan
H. Walden, had his organiza-
tion repaint the room in the

The bill for the repainting
will be over $40, and Morrow
will be asked to pay.

Asked about the case, Wal-
den said, ”It's not one room or
any other room; it‘s a policy."

Walden said that an interior
decorator has drawn up a color
scheme for the campus rooms,
and Morrow violated the color
schemeiwhich is bone white.

“As far as people painting
their own rooms goes, that‘s
out," said Walden, “If they go
ahead, they certainly have to
take the consequences."

Walden was particularly mif-
fed by Morrow’s use of black
trim, saying ”We don’t go
along with that sort of thing."

Morrow however said he liked
black, commenting, “Black is
even the color of the trim in the
college library and the new
union, which buildings, the lat:
ter especially, are in impec-
cably good taste.”

Morrow said also, “Of the
many ridiculous things B&G
does in the name of policy, I
feel there is a special case here
in that absurdity has generat—
ed absurdity to a degree that
challenges even the lively
imagination.

Walden, however, finds the
matter serious and said that the
painting was done in case the
house would be reopened next
year or in case it were rented
out.

This week’s 5&5 is the trial
issue for the new editor and
business manager —— John Wolf
and Harold Fuson. The next is-
sue will be published on Jan. 22
and will signal Wolf and Fuson‘s
official takeover.

 

Student Senate Proposes Changes
To Set Up New ‘Advisory Council'

By Wayne Stengel

Wednesday night the Student
Senate approved constitutional
amendments which would cre-
ate an advisory council of 21
members as the primary organ
of student government. These,
as all proposed amendments,
must be approved by 60 per
cent of those voting in a stu-
dent referendum. The Senate
vote was 32 in favor, one op-
posed, and one abstention.

If the student body approves
the amendments, in a vote to be
held early in the second semes-
tier, they will be sent to the
faculty and the President of
the college for approval.

Student government officials
said that if these amendments
receive the approval of all con-
cerned, they will be put into
effect before the end of the
present student officials’ terms.

Much of the meeting was
devoted to parliamentary dis-
cussions of amendments to the
proposed amendments.

An amendment was proposed
by SGA President Phil John-
son to replace article 15 of the
new system with a provision
that would provide for a mem-
ber of the advisory council be-
ing elected to serve as SGA
treasurer, and to be in charge
of the SGA and general budget
and reserve funds. Johnson
said that the proposal was in—
troduced at the request of Sue
Taylor, who now serves as una
official SGA treasurer even
though such an office is not
provided for in the present con-
stitution and had been over-
looked in the proposals. The
amendment was quickly adopts
ed.

Social Fund Boost
Okayed by College

An increase of ten dollars per
student per year will be added
to the social funds, according to
Palmer Hartl, SOClal Coordina—
tor. The increase is included
in the 3100 increase in the to-
tal college fees for the 196566
academic year,

$4,500.00 will be allocated to
the Forum fund, Which will
be used to program the activi-
ties of the new college Forum,

This fund Will be handled by
the student social committees.

Additional funds, amounting
to $6 00 per student per year,
less the $4,500 in the Forum
fund, (about $2,400 per year)
will be used for procuring and
maintaining equipment for the
Forum. These funds will be ad—
ministered by the college,

The additional $400 per stu-
dent per year (about $4,000)
will go into the regular social
program, “These additional
funds will meet the projected
needs outlined by the Social
Coordinating Committee last
spring," Hartl said. He added
that the general areas where
most of the funds will go are
concerts and formal dances,
but he stressed that their allot-
ment will be-at the discretion
of the Social Coordinating Com-
mittee for ’65-’66.

 

E'd. note: Miss ”ifa-ylo’rwair~ .
asked by the sea to‘cor‘d— "
ment on this proposal. She
said that though she has dis-
cussed the situation with
Johnson and Jim Parkison,
Speaker of the Senate, she
was unaware of this amend<
ment until asked for com-
ments.

Another amendment proposed
by Sue Johnson, which wa
passed over the opposition 0
some women senators, would
provide for the election of was
men representatives to the ad-
visory council within two
weeks after room drawings in
the spring, and for the elec-
tion of alternates within two
or three weeks after the begin-
ning of classes in the fall. This
would provide for a quorum so
that the council could begin its
work soon after returning to
campus in the fall While also

Wiﬂgrui Announces
Student Insurance

“This life insurance program, en-
dorsed by the United States Na-
tional Student Association, is the
best one in comparison with other
available programs,” said George
Wittgraf, campus NSA coordinator.
Interest in some kind at program
was expressed last summer and
with NSA negotiating for its mem-
ber colleges, it was able to gel:
this inexpensive policy because of
the large number of students in-
volved.

Any NSA college student is ela<
gible through age 33. The student-
terrn rate for $10,000 insurance is
$20 per year through age 24, and
increases only slightly as the stu~
dent gets older. The plan we;
change automatically to Whole
Life coverage with cash values
(and reduced rates for the first 4
years) upon graduation unless the
student prefers some other ar-
rangement.

The American Health and Life
Company guarantees:

1) Coverage is renewable and
noncancellable by the company as
long as the premiums are paid.

Z) Rates cannot be increased.

3) Restrictions cannot be added.

4) Benefits cannot be reduced.

5) Students Who enroll now but
do not finish college can continue
coverage at the term rate until
after their original expected grad-
uation date.

Coverage is open to any Grinnell
College student and the open en-
rollment period extends to Feb. 28,
1965. Grinnell College is not selling
insurance, but as a member of
NSA is simply making this pro-
gram available, For any further
information contact George Witt-
graf.

The Reorganizalion

With little notice from the campus, the Student
Senate voted to suggest to the students, who would sug-
gest to the faculty, who would suggest to the President,
that the Senate be replaced by an advisory council
which would hopefully reduce the red tape encountered
under the present student government setup.

According to Speaker of the Senate Jim Parkison,
the proposal for the new advisory council system grew
out of discussions held by the committee on student
government reorganization at last September’s encamp-
ment. Acting President James H. Stauss was a member
of that committee and originally suggested a “committee
of eleven" to act as a coordinating body for student
government and to serve as a consultative body for the
administration. The committee would have been com-
posed of the AWS president, CofHP president, SGA
president, and four at—large representatives from both
north and south campus. The plan was modified to in-
clude a 21-member council. This latter plan was carried
through by a special committee that was set up after
the encampment by SGA President Phil Johnson; this
committee made the proposals that were passed last
Wednesday by the Senate.

The new plan would leave most legislation and
such other concerns as budget allotments and nomina-
tion approval to the advisory council but would have
legislation concerning conduct regulations handled dur-
ing joint CofHP, AWS, and advisory council sessions.
To a large degree, the legislative and executive
branches of student government would be brought to-
gether. Courts, however, would remain a separate body

‘ of student government.

The backers of the constitutional amendments
have cited the advantages. There is the hoped—for re-
duction of red tape and a possible elimination of bicker-
ing among student officials. By voting overwhelmingly
for the proposals, the senators have indicated that they
share this optimism.

It should be noted, though, that there are still
many people on campus who are wary of these amend—
ments. Among them are those who feel that the propo—
sal offers a substitute that is not sufficiently different
than the present system. There are those who feel that
the judicial branch should be included in the advisory
council. There are those who simply don‘t like the way
the amendments were slipped by during a period when
student concern over such matters was at an ebb.

All in all, the proposals seem quite sound. Still, the
present system is far from being a horrible failure. A
system of changing the method of student government
every few years to meet the whims of the reigning stu-

dent administration is hardly conducive to establishing-

an effective means of making student opinions and
needs known to other segments of the college Communi—
ty. Perhaps a permanent student government organiza-
tion could be evolved if more of the people involved in

student government cared enough to want to make the=

present systcm work.

letters to Mother

(The following is an excerpt of
a letter David Lighthoume wrote
to his motherh

Rumor has it that lhe people at
1019 Park Street are filling lhe
house iull oi gorillas when they
move out. It’s a kind cl parting
gesture to assure everybcdy that
they are leaving without mom.

i don’t know why they chose
gorillas, instead or something a
little more friendly a unless lhey
really do feel disobliging about the
whole aiiair. in that case, l have

no sympalhy for them. They’ve'

been enjoying special privileges all
along, and there's no reason why
they shouldn't be “back in the
told” (an interesting metaphor).

i know there are already enough
beatniks on North campus. but
who, Mother dear, would expect
the hurling boys to tolerate more
potential headaches than their sal-
aries stipulate? Make no mistake,

l concur with [he decislon. And yer
i do consider il with mixed leci-
ings.

The decision to close down Park
Street was simply a matter of sac-
riflcing the best interests cl iiiiie
individuals lor the general cuhveii-
lence or a dogmatic. totalitarian
philosophy. You naturally lose
sight of the individual’s welfare in
‘the blind exercise pi cynical au-
lhurity. in the words oi an adminisr
tratlorl piiicial. “That's the wayi
,lhc world works."

The curious thing about higher
education these days IS rhal it is
disposed to think in patterns an-
alagous m the World Oulslde. ii we
have come a long way lrdm Aris-
tolle‘s peripatellc kind of teach-
ing, we have also come a long way
from the European university tra-
dition which we hoped to inherit.
A key facet of that lraditlon was
the notion that Colleges Should

 

stand apart from the general so
ciety and even risk notoriety or
disrepule while pursuing new
truths.

The chief factor that dislim
ngShBS the present situation from
that tradition is the presence bi
large, mock-heroic administrations,
dedicaled to their own selfrpreser-
vation, even at the expense of sill-
dents, leachers. and whatever else
you need in order to learn and
progress.

In closing Park Street the admin»
islration noted that it was “lhe
best course icr the College comr
muhity at the present time."

There's a significant error here,
for they have failed to make the
necessary distinction between their
own interests and the interests of
such things as the English depart
ment, the Drama department, and
The Grimell Review. This, or
course. is to be expected.

volved the Women’s Quadran—
gle. Ari 5&8 in early Decem-

ing in glowing terms. It was
to contain a reception area, a

air "promenade” above il. a
dining room which would seat
the entire female population of

the school, a theatre and rec—'

Editorial comment hailed the
nearing completion of the Quad-
rangle predicting “a develop
ment of the home life in the
College" and an increase in the
school's social life tending to
“give the cultural and social
finish needed in the vast social
relationships of after life.” The
common dining rom and the
equal rule enforcement brought
about by proctor: were hailed
as a means to a “broader de-
lnocracy" on lhe campus. An-
other advantage pointed out
was “the greater physical pro-
LCCllOn and Care which it will be
possible lo give (the glrls).”

Newsy freshman Girl Is Dedicated to
Being Bumfuzzled Would-Be Critic

By Anne Farrer

During one’s ireshman year at
Grinnell, oue encounters many,
trials and tribulations _ one ot‘
which may be working on theE
5&3, it one is so dedicated to thel
principles oi journalistic honesty
and/or is suckered into it. More
specifically traumatic is being
asked very nicely. if somewhat
iorceiully, to write a newsy little
bit about the recent art exhibits
scattered here and there about
campus. This is all good and well.
especially since I’m taking a fine
arts course # only it’s Intro to
Speech and Theatre. 'Thereicre,
this leaves us with one extremely
ignorant reporter with one heck
of an assignment.

So (he one bumiuzzled would-be
art critic takes pencil and heart
in hand and goes trapping over to
the Forum and blankly stares at
the exhibition of "Paul Strand's
Mexico" for the better part of a
half hour. She then admits defeat
and resorts to reading a 12 page
article on Strand written by some
one who did know what he was
talking about. She finds out a
good many interesting things about
Paul Strand — his belief in the
worth of man. his artistic appeal
for social reform, his problematic
approach, his perfectionism, his
opposition to commercial conven-
tions, his greatness. To borrow a
statement: “Paul Strand is an art-
ist oi thetpeople. They are the only

 

patrons he serves."

The critic jg, being now quite
fired up about art, photography
and Strand, charges back to the
exhibition, mutters in an awed
tone “Wow — what photos, what
a guy # wow: and tears on to
bat out her story just in time lor
the deadline.

Ed, Note; Miss Farrer got her
story in by the deadline, but she
{oi-got to mention that Strand‘:
works can be seen now until Jan.
26. Another art exhibit, iroin
Artists Equity Association or
Minnesota, is on display In
Selieali'er Gallery until Jan. 25.

SCARLET» AND ILNCK

Individuality Bowen '5 SUI Theme

From the Inaugural address of
Dr. Howard R. Bowen upon his
invutiture as president of the
University of lawn, lowa City;

"We live today in a world of
teeming population and vast urban
conglomeration. The individual is
part of immense organizations such
as corporations, labor unions, farm
organizations and government bu-

reaus. The individual becomes a
number, a cog in complex ma-
chinery, an object to be manipulat-
Id, a standardized unit that is ex-
pected to adjust to a norm. In this
atmosphere, his sense of responsi-
bility and his concern for his lei-
low man tend to be dulled. Mass
society bears down with special
force on young people.

“A university is perhaps our
most effective instrument for coun-
teracting the conformity and
anonymity that society tends to
impose. A major purpose of the
university is to draw out each per-
sonality, to, encourage expression
of particular interests, to seek out
genius, to discover and test new
ideas, to engage differing points of
view in free and fruitful discussion,
in short, to preserve and promote
individuality. The only conformity
the university requires is loyalty
to the search for truth.

"quortunately, as the university
becomes larger, it too may take on
the characteristics of the huge ore
ganiz ion. It may become bureau-
cratic, its regulations may be pon-
demos and inﬂexible, its educa»
tional program may be mechani-
cal, it may describe people and
their performances only in terms
of numbers that can be cranked
into computers.

As the university grows, it' may
lose its capacity to confront stu-
dents and faculty members as in»
dividuals, or to be concerned about
Iuch human qualities as integrity,
courage, social sensitivity, aesthe«
tic appreciation, imagination, con-
cern for fellow men, and religious
commitment. I think many of our
larger universities are in danger
of losing touch with the individual,
of emulating the factory, rather
than the alma mater.

"Our academic program should
give students ample exposure to
personal teaching. By personal
teaching I refer to discussion and

 

direct exchange of views between
a faculty member and one or more
students. Personal teaching may
take the form of small classes and
seminars, it may occur in laborav
tories or studios. or it may take
the form of informal conversations.
Personal teaching means interac-
tion and discussion. The teacher
appears as a human being whom
the students can know, and teaches
by virtue of the kind of person he
is, not merely through one-way
communication of his subject,

“We should increase emphasis
on independent study and student
writing..All our students should
write frequently, and their writing
should be criticized. We should re-
duce the number of courses stu-
dents take at any one time, and
thus encourage depth and thought-
fulness and promote independence.
By reducing the number of courses
taken and the number taught, we
could find the time for more per-
sonal teaching as well as more re-
search. . .

"The extracurricular life of the
university offers another oppor-
tunity for encouraging individuali-
ty. Through extracurricular activi-
ties, the individual student can ex-
press himself, broaden his horizons,
acquire new insights, gain experi-
encc in human relations, as well
as achieve needed recreation.

“Distinquished visiting scholars
from all parts of the world should
be brought to the campus for vary-
ing periods from a week to a year
and should be in face to face con-
tact with students. Since we are
living in a revolutionary era with
new nations and new cultures are
emerging and when the ageless
struggle for the rights of man has
intensified both at home and
abroad, our discussion should en-
compass non-Western, urban prob-
lems, and Civil rights.

“These areas inevitably intro-
duce the vital moral dimension into
our discussions. Since we are liv-
ing in an age when the ground of
existence is being questioned, our
discussion must encompass reli-
gion.

"I want no luxury and no waste.
l want the economy and beauty of
simplicity. I also want the economy
of investing wisely in our greatest
resource. namely, our young peo-
ple. There is no long-run economy

 

TASTE WHAT’S HAPPENED TO LEMON AND LIME!

 

in providing inferior education for
them.

“Finally, I should Iii-re to say a
word about prestige. A university
must be concerned about its repu-
tation. Reputation is linked with
the ability to attract students and
faculty, the power to raise money,
the morale of students and staff,
and the worth of degrees. Never-
theless, I am inclined to think that
the academic world today is over-
ly preoccupied with prestige. Too
many policies and actions are de-
signed to impress, to gain a favor-
able “image." The glamorous pro-
grams universities undertake, the
famous professors they try to lure
away from each other, the grants
they seek, the equipment and
buildings they acquire, are all de-
signed with one eye on prestige
and one eye on true education and
research. The effect of this search
for prestige has been to create lm»
balance between research and
teaching, between graduate study
and undergraduate study, between
devotion to the outside profession
and devotion to one’s university.
There is a great deal of academic
keeping up with the Joneses, lead
ing to conformity as each institu-
tion tries to emulate the next one
above in the scale of prestige.
There is need for the courage of
individuality among universities as
well as among persons.

”Now l am for prestige. i am
glad the University of lowa has a
great deal of it, and I want Iowa
to have even more. But I believe
that prestige is one of those things
—- ' like friendship, respect, and
love — which one does not get by
seeking them directly. I believe,
therefore, that our actions should
be guided toward what is right for
us, in light of our traditions and
our objectives, rather than guided
toward what University X or Y is
doing.

“I hope we shall be the kind of
university that is willing to try out
new ideas. ! also hope we shall be
the kind of university that can say
“no" to insistent social pressures
that would divert us from our true
course. I hope we shall seek in-
dividuality for the university it»
self, as well as lor the persons who
are part of it. if we are true to
ourselves, we need never worry
about our prestige.”

Editor Suspended ‘
By Roosevelt U.

The entire editorial board 0‘
bhe Roosevelt Torch, was re-
cently_ suspended by ﬁle Stu;
dant ACtivity Board. The Torch
is the student newspaper at
Roosevelt University. in Obie
cago, Ill.

The suspension resulted from
an early-December issue of the
Torch, which carried an article
alleging that Robert Pitchell
President of the university, he
been asked to resign by the
school's board of trustees. Uni-
versity officials confiscated the
issue, and later released it with
a four-page supplement deny-
ing the story.

Pitchell then suspended tho
fivestudent editorial staff and
the paper's editor, Judy Hal-
prin from their position: and
barred them from participation
in any student activities, The
board upheld the suspension.
but withdrew the activity ban.

Publication of the Toroh‘ha-
been temporarily halted, at
the students involved in tho'
suspension were the only mem-
bers of the staff with the tech;
nical ability to put out th
newspaper. A new editor wil
be chosen by the Student Ao-
tivity Board.

The six students involved are
now planning to publish a com-
peting newspaper, probably
mimeographed, which will be
entitled the Roosevelt Free
Press.

In spite of the administra-
tive denials at. the time of the
Torch‘s story, the Associated
Press Wire service carried a
story two weeks later which
stated that Pitchell had “asked
to be relieved of his duties
when his term of office empire!
Aug. 31, 1965."

‘Committee on Student Affairs
Defines Its Function. Position

For the past several weeks, the
Faculty Committee on Student‘Af-
fairs has been cooperating with the

5&1! preparing statements in an»
swer to questions prepared by the
paper in an attempt to make the
committee, its functions, and its
position in the college community
more clear to the student body.
The Committee on Student Af-
inirs is a standing committee of
the Faculty established by the
Faculty and the President.

The purpose at the Committee on
Student Affairs are (l) to advise
the President on policies, pro
eedures, rules, and penalties in the
area of student conduct and dis-
cipline; (2) to participate in the
process or changing “basic rules
and penalties," as provided by the
legislation of the Trustees; and
(a) to consider and decide cases
within its purview and, under ap-
propriate conditions, to review its
decisions. In its function of ad-
iudicating cases, the Committee
has duties specified in the legisla-
tion of the Faculty (approved by
the President) establishing the
Committee.

The Committee’s responsibility
is to use procedures which accord
with standards of fairness and
which meet the college's need for
general observance of policies and
rules pertaining to conduct in col-
lege.

The Committee on Student Af-
fairs, insofar as its duties extend
into the adjudication of cases, has
an administrative function. Specifi-
cally, its relationships to adminis-
trative officials stated in its list of
duties.

The Committee does not con-
sider every rule violation. As the
statement of its duties indicates,
it will consider and decide cases
which come to it (1) upon a recom-
mendation of suspension or dismis-
sal, or (2) upon a specification
that the case is within the Com-
mittee’s purview.

The committee may find grounds
for suspension or dismissal in the
facts of a violation of rules of Con»
duct stated in the Student Hand-
book.

The Committee will make its
ground rules for hearing cases.
This is a question that the Commit-
tee should answer with reference
details and with due regrad to
standards of fairness.

The Committee on Student Af-
fairs has authority to review its
own decisions. No formal pro-
eedure for appeal is provided.

This committee was created by
the faculty in the fall of 1963 as a
standing committee, but its duties

Students Chosen to
Leave for LeMoyne

The final selection of stu—
dents to attend LeMDyne Col-
. iege next semester was an-
nounced by Dale Terry (regis
trar) just before Christmas va-
cation. Those who will attend
are Mike Fort and Cynthia
artist, juniors, and Jim Steph-
ens .and Margaret Bluhm, soph»
ornores. They will be the first
Grinnell students to attend Le
Moyne as part of the new ex-.
._change program.

 

were substantially revised in the
fall of 1964. The committee is
standing, but its membership and
its particular concerns may he
changed by the faculty upon the
recommendation of the Committee
itself.

Faculty concern and fairly di-
rect involvement in student affairs
has been a part of the Grinnell
scene for many years. Certainly
the College is now profiting by in-
creased concern on the part of
everyone about the “style of
life” of Grinnell students (or some
Grinnell students) and about a dis-
parity that appears to exist be»
tween the academic and social ef-
fectiveness of the College.

The committee was asked also
to comment on whether they were
considering any major organiza-
tional changes for North campus.
The following is their statement
on this matter.

“Various ideas (wished - {or
changes in student government,
the presence of adults in the dorms
BS advisers, better distribution 0f
classes within the halls, less
rigidity in hall dividing-lines. etc.)
have been discussed and studied,
but at present there are no plans
as such, especially since the Com-
mittee cannot, by itself, effect or-
ganizational changes. Any changes
will no doubt come about through
the usual process of consultation
with all elements of the College
community, including students.
Such consultation is in fact now
going on (these questions and re
sponses being a part of it)."

More answers will emerge as the
Committee goes about its business
of fulfilling its duties. It cannot set
out a code or regulations designed
to specify in advance the details
of every possible Violation of rules
and the details of the solution of
every case. Law is not made that
way, either outside the college or
within the college. The Commit-
tee’s job, in considering and de-
oiding cases which come to it, is
to apply the reasonable clear rules
(stated in the Student Handbook)
in ways which will safeguard the
college and a system of living in
which Student responsibility meas-
ures up to the freedom which stu-
dents have under the rules.

All
it

By Paul Trigg

The 1964 college football season ended over Christmas
vacation with the numerous bowl games, and although Ala-
bama’s Joe Namath gave the most outstanding individual per-
formance and Texas the outstanding team performance, I
think the Rose Bowl story carried the biggest moral. In that
game a very good Michigan team soundly throttled Oregon
State 34-7i Michigan showed a well-balanced team with a
hard charging line, solne talented backs, and great depth
The out-manned Beavers never really had a chance.

The key to the story, however, was the post-game com-
ment by Michigan quarterback Bob Timberlake to the effect
that many of Michigan’s Big Ten opponents this season had
been superior to Oregon, (On their schedule this would
presumably mean Purdue, Ohio State, Michigan State, 11-
linois, perhaps Minnesota, and even Northwestern, whom Mich-
igan beat 35-0 but who defeated Oregon State 7-3.) Although
Californians are arguing that the best coast team, Southern
Cal, was not playing in the game, and although we must
not forget that great USC team of a few years ago; this game
proved that the Big Ten still plays a considerably better brand
of football than the West Coast.

Speaking of the Big Ten, their conference basketball
race got off and running this week, as did most of the
major conferences across the country. It seems as though
the Big Ten may be stronger than usual this year. There are
several excellent teams which could make a run for the title,
As of last week four conference teams, Michigan, Minnesota,
Indiana and Illinois were ranked in the top ten. Michigan
and Minnesota both have faltered somewhat in pre-conference
action, and will have to improve to fend off the challenges
of Indiana and Illinois. Ohio State, Purdue, Northwestern
and, believe it or not, Iowa could pull a few upsets. For my
own picks, I choose Michigan to win the Big Ten with Min-
nesota and Illinois close and UCLA to repeat as national
champion.

Ed. note: The following
article is a slightly adapted
version of a story appearing in
the Dec. 11 issue of Time
magazine.

The University of Iowa is a
Contented campus this fall. It
has regents who value academ-
ic freedom, faculty and stu-
dents hospitable to fresh ideas,
ever-morerliberal financial sup»
port from the legislature. More
important, the university has a
tradition of wise, long»reigning
president, recently Iowa in—
stalled a new one, the first in
24 years.

From the start, the man
seemed to match the office.
Said Howard R, Bowen, 56, in
his inaugural address: "The
University of Iowa, located al-
most literally on the edge of

SCARLET AND ILACK

a cornfield," must be “a place
that is hospitable to the individ-
ual human being, that raises
his aspirations. i hope we shall
also seek individuality for the
university itself.”

Bowen's durable predecessor,
Rhodes Scholar Virgil M. Han-
cher, has kept Iowa in the
front rank of state universities.
With Hancher approaching
mandatory retirement at 68.
the regents last year also be-
gan to think about the future.
Screening more than 130 candi-
dates, they finally chose Bow-
en, a specialist in economic
theory, whom they found only
56 miles away, where he was
president of Grinnell College.

For Bowen it was a home-
comingr He got his doctorate
from Iowa, taught there for
seven years before becoming
an expert in ﬁscal policy and

the problems of small business
tor the New Deal; After several
positions, he_came,‘to Grinnell
in 1955, When Bo’wen arrived;
the school was scratching for
students; by the time he left
they were fighting to get in.
Grinnell won one of the first
Ford Foundation matching
grants and, under Bowen, spent
$6,000,000 on construction cur-
riculum revision, faculty wage
increases.

Bowen has brought the same
vitality to Iowa since his ap-
pointment last spring. Already
in progress is $60 million worth
of new construction, including
a fine art center designed by
Harrison and Abramovitz. Plan<
ning for a big state univer-
sity was surprisingly similar to
the needs of Grinnell, Bowen
discovered. “I just had to add
another digit or two."

providing for representatives
serving the halls they live in
on South campus.

A third amendment, which
was soundly defeated, would
have provided that the SGA
President would not be the pre‘
siding officer oi the advisory
council. Roger Ferris, who pre-
sented the amendment, argued
that it would guard against too
much power being placed in
the hands of the SGA Presi-
dent. This argument was ro-
futed successfully by Dan
Bucks and Johnson.

The entire group of proposed
amendments was passed by the
Student Senate before the meet-
ing was adjourned. The son
will present an explanation of
the amendments in its next is<
sue (Jan. 22). We were caughu'
off guard when told by John-
son and Parkison that no final
action would be taken thin
week.

Whoosh! What you almost saw above was the wooiiest number in years: Oidsmobile’s 44-2. Sporting (and
standard) equipment includes a 400cm—in. 345—bp V—8 mill backed with 4-barrel carb and acoustically
tamed, chambered twin pipes. And “sticky" red-line tires. And front and rear stabilizers, heavy—duty
flame, springs and shocks that make lean and away mere memories. Three transmission availabilities, too,
including 3—speed synchromceh, A—on-thevﬂpor and Jetaway automatic. Better hurry over to your Olda
