The pace at peace

The lfour year old Grin ell ”pe‘ce movement” has
played an excitingly radical El all, crying; ollt of an intense
involvement with nuclear realties to a majority of per—
plexed, synnathetic or outraged st‘udent onlookers. The
“movement” get organized as Grinnell Students for Peace
some time back, and lots 01' people worked on the less
spectacular details of administration. But a preponderance
of wandering enthusiasm m'er practicality left the “move»
Inent” swimming between weakness and strength, between
the adherence of the barberless, faithful few and the crew
cot hundred.

This year the “movement" has hitched up its or-
ganizational belt as the Grinnell Student Peace Group,
because the “for Peace" (male might presume unfairly
that nonmlembers were ipso facto for war. The pr
ent Version has produced one at" the ﬁnest conbrete
accomplishments of the “movement‘s“ stormy ex t»

Disarmament Possible." This emphasis, which Presir

Ions for a few years, 'liltIS at focusing the insights of

Tuesday night

For many of us the intermittent eruptions of ”peace
l’ioVelnent" action stand as landmarks ill Grlnnell’s en»
coumging struggle to come alive.

It all began one fine sprlng‘ night ill 1960, when about

rty piclleting students decided to make the all-campus ,

ml itary ball their scene of protest. ROTC has seen fit to
use a Very private, women’s gym ever since. The following
fall a larger group marched at the capitol building in Des
Mojnes, and next morning’s “Register" left Iowa gaping
at this pullky threat to its peace of mind.

lst year fourteen students decided that a stand
against nuclear testing was worth a meal, or maybe even
three meal-less days making their Voices heard in Ameri‘
ca’s capitol. Over 300 Grinnell students back home skipped
a, meal to Show their solidarity. And all the time between
these valuable outbursts, the peace movement talked, dis-
cussed and collapsed into listless exhaustion.

This observer congratulates the present group for
carrying through an effort which can give continuity to
the "movement,” bllt those spasms ot’ plotest are still
damn necessarv not onlv because Grinnell needs the perie

To the Editor:

As parents of a freshman stu—
dent at Gr lnell, we thoroughly
may your publlcuhou. It gives
us a piclulc oi the school aboul
which we still have much to
learn. However the issue just
received (Oct. )) dissipated
some of the good feeling we had
in regard to general attitudes on

plum I am referring particu-
larly to the lehglhy and rather
silly comments in the letters to

an answer to the uuouluu posed

sensical ospousal of pro )ing.
Our answer i~ ‘yes" 7 tnis is
evaclly the kind of institution
we hope our son is attending.
though I must say Mr. Larson
raised a few doubts in my mind,
that is u his attitute toward
such an outdated, childish ac
tivity is representative.

To the E(l.tot.

I had to be rather amused by
the suupbuv pcech of Johns
Harlan and Pilgrim in last
week's 5&1}. Since it ignored all
the pertinent facts relating to
the Executive Cabinet's velo or
a referendum on the Mlssissi
pl resolution. I‘ve decided
must be a joke,

it

However. just to clear things
up, here are the facts:

(1) THE RESOLUTION 31'
the Senate was not, and can—
not constitutionally be, a man-
(late upon the Cabinet to hold
a referendum. It is but the
recommendation of one branch
of student government to an-
other. As a result, it is up to
the discretion of the Cabinet
whether or not it will deem
such a recommended refer-
endum necessary.

(2) THESE ARE THE rea-
sons Mr. Boston gave to the
Senate (of which both Hurr
Ian and Pilgrim are members)
for tlle.Cabinet’s vein: The
Cabinet did not feel there is
sufficieul opposition to the
Senate's passage of the l‘eso'
lution to warrant a referen—
duln on those grounds, upl-
dld it feel that a resolution

We hope that the opportun-

something more than an “aca-
demic rat race"; that “2mm

served by lav better means
(huh prepping stunts: fhut de-
pendent thinking and the abil-
ity to get along with one's
fellow man doesn’t depend on
such shallow reasoning as
these letters displayed.

One exception — our colnpli»

A Parent Reader

To the Editor:

I appreciate the opportunity
to comment as a parent on the
hurtling issue of women‘s hours
I will first answer your specific
questions. I think the Gl'innell
administration should act in RCA
cordance wifh its own judgment
in this matter. When my daughr
tor planned to go Grinnell. I
did not ask specifically about:
women's hours: I was interested
generally in the administration,
the laculty. the student body
and the alumni: I received very
favorable reports on all of
these groups then. and outside
the pages of 5&3 I receive very
favorable i‘epor on them new

AT HOME, my daughter
would not be permitted to star

boys in her bedroom, The quesV
(iuu could never arise. since
such things are not done in our
community. They are done. of

they are done generally in a
few rebellious communities, I

College has nobler purposes
than preparing a painless (mush
lion into the adult world. If
will do no harm, however, to
realize that there are few op-
portunities in that world to in-
dulge “basic rights" entirely
free from regulations. s

An Illinois parent

To the Editor:

As parents of a Grinnell co-ed
we strongly protest any move
to abolish women's hours. The
answer to your question as to
whether we would have refused
to let our daughter come to
Grinnell with no hours regulaA
tions is an unqualified yes, We
are greatly distressed because of
the increasmg trend toward be
laxation of all college rules and
regulations as evidenced by the
hazing incidents. open open
dorms, unrestricted liquor in
dor moi-(es, repons of girls in
men's dormitory rooms all night.
and how the pressure for elimi-
nation oi curfew for the women.

Everywhere we are com-
pelled to live by rules and un—
der restrictions. Society would
simply break down without
them, and life at :1 college is
no excehtion. Laws are neces—
sary for the protection of those
who want to abide by the cor-
rect standards of behavior.

We are curious. Why else do
you want to rel v the houls but
for “free love“ School activities
are over. the library and student
union closed. No hours at the
wonle s dorms would mean no
restrictions at all on boys being
in the lounges and loggi: all
night. and \‘ice versa—the girls
in the be ' dorm, How liberal
can one get?

It . our feeling that all this
agitation is being made by a
small but vociferous minority
and (hul the average level-head
cd student is not opposed to rear
sonn‘ole rcstricuons. It is too bad
that u {cw sludents can damage
the reputation and prestige of
the college, which is what. is
happening right how.

presented in the United States
during the 1340s. Described as
a ballet or ‘purc dancing,’ this
represents Balanchine's attempt
to wed classical ballet with an
abstract manner. The result is a
work which calls tor dancers ot'
high technical virtuosity.

performance will include Antony
Tudor's “Judgement of Paris,"
Ray Powell's ”One in Five,” Celia
Franco’s intcipretation of ”After-
Ashton‘s "Les Rondczevous,”

The evening performance of
Antony Tudor's “Lilac Garden"
is a representation at what might
be. in contrast to what is, as
the young brlde»tosbe, Caroliilc.‘
meets her lover in the lilac gar»
den. She is to marry another,1
but has this interlude with her
lover.

The nl:lneshQrinust-lnm'ry is
also there, along with the worn—‘

also renounce. The enectiveness
oi the ballet consists oi Tudor’s
combination or dance and panto—
mime to create a mood, to build

'Cervene speaks ,
on modern art

in lecture series

5&3 stall Writer
By Jim Terrai

Richard Cervene (are) pre-
sented a lecturc lgst Friday in
Roberts Theater, entitled “Notes.
on Action painting." Cervcne'sl

.talk was the fourth in the
Board oi Religioll’s series,
Critique ot American Cultureﬂl

“The need to communicate,”
said Cervene, “has in all men
at all times been strong. neare
ly to the point of compulsion.
For the artist, the problem oi l
communication is relatively .
simple as long as he uses iair~ 1
1y conventional iornis and ‘
color combinations." ‘l

”In such a case, it is possible
for ll‘tc artist to communicate
with his audience‘” Cel’Vellel
said, “even if the latter Commits
the Sin of insensitivity, because
the canventlonai can appeal to
the inlellect." l

CERVENE POINTED o u t ,‘
however, that many artists to,
day consciously avoid the usei
ot iamiliar object and ordinary
colors. Theresult is that com—
munication is considerably more
diiiieult and quite olten it sim-l
ply does not take place, Car—i
vene laid the blame in this on
the public. “It is the responsi-
bility oi every’sensitive Observ-i
er,” he said, “to bring with:
him a certain degree oi ilexei
ibility." l

As viewers, we are apt to‘
make communication betwccni
ourselves and the artist impose‘
siblc by our very attempts to
intellectualize the content oi a
painting, he said. The way to_
abstract art is not, Cervene
said, through our intellect or
through an understanding oi
the historical background of a
painting. although both oi these
may occasionally be of
help.

soiiic‘

"The way to abstract art is
through an emotional reac-
tion between the painting and
the observers» In deiense oi
this emotional reaction, CCr- ‘
veno observed that ”emotion
can convince us to a point ‘
where, even without ii logical .
proof, we are willing to be-
lievei”

Cervcne then came to the res
cuc oi So~called Action Painting,
which derives its name irom
the “‘moritevigol‘oussthan-u s u a 1
methods" that its exponents enle
ploy in applying paint to can
vas. "It is the end product,"
he said, ”that should be approv-
ed, not thc technique." He went
on to point out that most Crilr
ics seem ignorant oi this point,

CURVENE CONCLUDED by
quoting Henry Miller ("Tropici
oi Cancer") who said that the
artist's problem is to had, in the‘
chaos around him. a personal-i
1y meaningiul order.

(Writer's note: In view or
the last .that Cervene was
lecturing in a series entitled
”A Critique oi American Culv
true" it may be pertinent to
point out that there was no

, explicit reiercnce to this point
in his ”Notes on Action Painte ,
ing.” Although oei-venc did
not. denounce art as “bad
poetry," liis iailure to adopt a

Disarm opponents peacefully
urges Martin Luther King at Coe

By Phil Bernstein
S to E Stat: Writer

Tuesday, the ‘Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King spoke at a meeting
ot the Committee on Human
Relations of Cedar Rapids held
at the Geo College auditorium.
Dr, King is president or the
Southern Christian Leadership
Contcrencc and is recognized as
one of today's great leaders in
the ﬁght for racial equality in
America.

In his speech, Dr. King noted
that as Atricari and Asian na—
tions gain their independence,
they make it clear that they
won't accept a nation that Segrer
gates a segment of its population
along lines of color or race.

Talking with African lendr—
ers, he has become convinced
that the United States must
desegregate or face the pros-
pect ot heing demoted to the
status of a second rate powerr
fte emphasized, however, tirat
“this problem (segregation)
must be solved not only he.
cause it is diplomatically exe
pcdient hut because it is moi--
ally compelling"

Commenting on the situation
at ‘Ole Miss,” Dr King placed’
the blame for the present crisis
upon the power structure saying
no politicat,religiou or academic
leader took a pos' ve stand on
the issue before it was brought
to a head. He praised the stand
taken by the federal govern
merit as a very forthright one

IN THE EFFORT ot the Negro
to get equal rights, Di King is
a strong advocate of non—v olence'
which he claims “1 ayes the op—
ponent glutted wrth his own
harha 'ty’ He warned against

succumbing to the temptation ofl

using violent means on the
grounds this would arouse a
new hatred towards the Negro.

Though he denounced the
violence oriented Black Muslim
movement, he attacked the en-
vironmental conditions t h a t
spawned it as a worse detria
inent to the integration cause
than the movement itself. Lag-
ging standards in the Negro
community, he feels, can
laid directly at the feet ot seg-
regationr

In a qttcstionranswer period
following the lecture, Dr. King
supported the NAACP’s plan tor
achieving integration by
rather tedious means of court
litigations but. hastened to
that the success of the integt'zta

tion movement depended on the!
coordinated crforts of all groupsl

concerned.

WHEN ASKED about the ef-t
tects or church policy in the
South on the integration move-
ment he said that churches are
realizing the need for integration

he!

the l

add ‘

and have begun to uphold the
195-1 Supreme Court dcctston
and to condemn segregation. '

He made the observation,
houcver, that Sunday morning
in the South is still the most.
segregated time and place on
earth and expressed some at
pleasure at church policy {or
being what he termed “an echo‘
rather than a’ voice." t

DRo KING pointed out that.
an important result OI universal‘
Negro suftrage in the South will‘
be a liberalization of United
Statesvdomestic and foreign pols)
icy. This, he Said. will be accom
pllshcd when the Negro voter
helps to retire om oftice the
Southern D
ioi-ity in Congress enables them
to control many of the nation’s
policies,

Concluding. Dr. King reaffirms,
ed his faith that eventually sued
cess would be achieved in the
ﬁght for desegregation and aquull
rights

WITH ONLY a couple of min»

Utes gone in the first quarter, ;

Grinnell the ball on its own

Then a backfield-in-nlotion]

hmd the soccer program.

The ﬁred up hosts gave the
Grinnellialls their ﬁrst real ﬁght
of thc year by holding them to
the lone goal which was beauti—
lully cxccuted by Vincent Anku,
the leading Pioneer scorer.

The Grinnell offense was ullr
able to move the ball as well
as in the two previous matches.
This was because of the very
:strong MaCMul’r’dy iullbacks who

ithe Oles battle at Kno

both holding down second place in the MCAC w h 31
marks have only outside chances for the title.

Both men see the possibility of a Grinnell loss in
Carleton, SI. Olaf, or Cornell. “Don’t you think we‘ll
pmbahly heat Cornell?” I interjectetl. “I don’t know,”
h’ k said. “They’ve got a lot of sophomores and jllll‘

' 5 who, with a little experience, nl‘ 'ht be tough as

'15 by the last game.”

Carleton and St. Olal have almost identical schedules.
The only difference is that Carleton meets Lawrence While
. “Where is Carleton playing this
week?” risked Pfitsch‘. "Ill Olelrille,” replied Mickey, ill-
dicating that he thought Carleton would be knocked out
of the race in the collie ' The other two games for each
school are Grinnell and Monmouth.

A WORRIED LOOK came over Mickey’s face as he
retld oif the Kohtlwks remaining games with Cornell, Molk
mouth, Lawrence, and Beloit, “I can’t see Coe losing from
here on out,” he said, while Pfitsch nodded in agreement.

liipon too had a comparatively easy schedule playing
Lawl ncc, Cornell, Beloit, and Kn "So Lawrence plays
at Ripon this week,” I noted. ”Yes,” said Pfitsch, ”and
Ripon should win, but they’re shaky, and ii Laurence
plays them tight, they might fall apart like they did
against Coe."

'With the toughest remaining~ contests of any Coll<
[erellce club, meeting Ripon, Beloit, Coe, and Cilrleion,
both men expect Lawrence to lose at least one, but pick
the Vikings as (he most likely spoiler. “It certainly
would be nice to see Lawrence knocl off at least one
of the tough miles!" Mickey said optimistically. “Yes,
but we can‘t hope they‘ll go all the way,” l’filscll zldd—
ed. “because if We lose one, then the ll be in."

As the only undefeated team left in the Conference,

Women '5' low court elaborates ground rules

The Woman‘s Primary Court would like to offer the follows
ing Clarification of its method of operation in order thzit stun
dents may better understand this branch of their government
and in order that the Court may proceed more eifieienll)’ and
eii'cctil'cly. Any questions which are left unanswered by the (ol—
iowing statement {nay bl: directed to the Chief Magistrate. Myrna
Sillnption, and will be welcomed.

I. CLASSIFICATION OF CASES
Because the W'omen's Primary Court deals with Cases of two
distinct types, there are two different pi'oeedui utilized, The
two types of cases might be labelled “minOl and "major,"
based upon the relative weighting of the offenses involve , but
the chief distinguishing feature is the nature of the evidence
available.

Minor Cascs are those involving “primn fncic" evidence,
that which inconlcsiablv establishes lhc guih of the defendant.
(c. g. lalcncss cases, wherein a card signed upon late entry is
the available evidence). The question in these cases is one of
the circumstances behind the late enli-y, for example, and a
hearing is held to determine the degree of responsibility of the
defendant within the snuafion, In these cases (he prosecutor is
not necessary. However. witnesses may be produced by the de»
fendant. Cases falling into this category are late entries and
sign-in or signvout violations. those winch consiiuiic ihc orci»
whelming majority of the Court's transactions.

Major Cases are those where there is a question of the
guilt of the defendant, where there is no such incontestablc
evidence as a form signed by the defendant. In these cases
a prosecutor presents evidence on behalf of the Executive
Branch in the effort to establish guilt and ordinary trial pre-
ccdul'e is followed as it is outlined below.

II. PROCEDURE BY “’HICH A CASE COMES TO THE COURT

A. A charge is filed by the apprehending officer with the
AWS Board. ’

B. The AWS Board eltlrilics the charge and scnds it to the
Court Secrelai‘yi through the olticc of the Dean of Women:

C. The Cfiurt Secretary notifies the defendant of (hc charges
and the date of the hearing, and obtains a preliminary plea

D. The Court Secretary notifies the Prosecutor of the plea
in order that she may prepare for a hearing if the plea is
“guilty" or a trial if the plea is “not guilty".

(In cases of the “minor" type the evidence e.g. the late entry
card signed by the (lefendantris Sent directly to the office
of the Dean of Women by the Night Check Monitor and from
there is forwarded to the Court),
