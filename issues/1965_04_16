Eleven Grinnell Students left

from Cornell.

Also on the bus were Herbert F.
Hoover, one-time lowa candidate

daughter, Mrs. Joan Edgren or
near Oskaloosa, two iarmers from
northern Iowa, and one farmer
from Nebraska,

The march. organized nationally
by Students for a Democratic So-
ciety, is expected to draw 10,000
partiCipants,

In a recent report to the campus,
the Grinnell Committee on Viet
Nam noted, “in View of President
Johnson’s recent statement that
the U.S. is ready and Willing to
negotiate at this time, this march
has become a march of support for
successful negotiations as well as

.a protest against the escalation of
the war in Viet Nam."

Tile students had varied motives
tor going,

“There's something to be said
for commitment for its own sake,"
Said Steve Woolpert. who admitted
that the reason he was going was
“mostly curiosuy,”

Terry Scott. who lives in Wash-
ington and who is providing a place
for the students to stay, is taking
this chance to get home to look
for a summer job as well as dem-
onstrate.

When asked why she was pro-
testing, Muttie Meyer said that
she was protesting the war in Viet
Nam but that the “war represents
something much bigger. The much

Burma Speaks at Fourth Race Dinner,
Claims Preiudice Normal, Not Abnormal

By Pam Clay

Discrimination and prejudice
are normal rather than abnor-
mal patterns, said John Burma
(sociology) at Tuesday night's
dinner sponsored by the Board
of Religion. The dinner was
the fourth in a series designed
to educate participants on var-
ious aspects of the race prob-
lem.

“We usually do not get our
negative attitude by bad expe-
riences with a group," Burma
said. “We learn our attitudes
and values as a child, by the
tones of yoice, gestures, and

just by how things are said."

He explained that one cause
of discrimination and prejudice
in the South is that one natural-
ly fits into the normal cultural
pattern of the society of which
he is a part. A Southern child
is surrounded by only one set
of attitudes, values and be-
haviors. He is given no choice.
He necessarily accepts what is
available.

Advisory Council Holds Firsi Session;
Off-Campus Living, Budget Discussed

By Ted Lemaire

At the tirst meeting of the
Advisory Council last Wednes-
day a resolution supporting off-
campus housing for men and
upper-class women was passed.
The council also favored keep-

ing Grinnell House open
Sue Taylor. last year's SGA

treasurer. estimated that the

student government will be in
the red at the end of the cur-
rent academic year if expendi-
tures are made as budgeted.

A motion was passed provid-
ing that no picture contracts
would be signed with the Cy-
clone until the problem is
Studied. SGA owes the Cyclone
$9150 for pictures.

Also discussed was a sugges-
tion by Nord Brue to look into
the purchase of a new bus for
c a m p u s organizations, resi-
dence halls, athletic teams, and
long distance trips during va-
cations. Such an arrangement,
it was thought. would free the
college wagons for more exten-
sive use by individual students.

SGA President Jerry Goddard

reported that a proposal by the
executive cabinet which would
have eliminated payment of
damage bills from the hall so-
cial funds was turned down by
Acting President James Stauss.
The proposal provided that
when a hall was charged for
damages which it could not at-
tribute to an individual, it
would ”pass the hat.” If this
method of collection failed,
after thirty days the bill would
be taken to the treasurer’s of-
fice. where each member of
the hall would be assessed his
equal share. Goddard said that
Stauss's objection Cited irregu-
larities which would have been
caused in the Treasurer's of.
fice. The executive cabinet
will cenn'nue discussion of the
problem.

Other subjects discussed and
favored by Goddard were an
encampment at the beginning
of next September. an informal
party for last year’s CofHP, a
continuation of the book coop,
and a drive this spring for the
return of borrowed books to
the library.

 

Siauss: Prof
For Russian

An assistant professor oi
Russian has been hired by the
college to bring the Russian de-
partment back to full strength
in September, Acting President
James Stauss announced this
week.

Richard R. Sheldon of the
University of Michigan will
teach at least first year
courses. Second year offering:
will depend on enrollment.

The college did not hire a
Russian language professor this
year. In other years, Beth
Noble (Spanish) has taught
first year Russian, but this year
she has taught only Russian
literature courses,

In the some interview Stauss
discussed the proposed new
women’s dormitory. “The de-_
sign and location of a new resi-
dence hall for women is under
consideration, and the proba<
bility is that the building will
be approved. If it is approved
the expectation is that it will
be open for occupancy in Sep«
tember. 1966,” he said,

Stouss noted that the question
of continuing the Junior Liber~
al Arts examination was
brought up in this week‘s fac-
ulty meeting and will be dis-
cussed further at next week's
meeting.

He also said that the faculty
had okayed a proposal that
spells out circumstances in
which a student may defer His
torical Studies I to the second
semester of his sophomore
year.

 

leMoyne Presidenl Looks ai Exchange Program

By Sue Johnson

“Grinnell students need to
learn something of the prob-

lems of urbanization." stated
Holiis Price, president of Le
Moyne College, during his
Visit to Grinnell last Weekend.

in discussing the benefits of
the student exchange program
between LeMoyne and Grinnell

stated that Grinnell is a ”non-
problem” community. “I don’t
mean to imply that Grinneil has
no problems." he said, ”but it
has none of the social problems

ideal community." By spending

Asks Contributions for New Pool

.To the Editor:

Jim Adelman was absolutely
correct in his letter to the Scar-
let and Black in which he
pointed out that there is a great

contrast between the dilapi-
dated, totally inadequate swim»
ming pool and the rest of the
campus. The pool is too short,
too narrow, and does not have
Onough lanes. The locker rooms
Ire small and shabby, the air
is hot and muggy, and pro-
visions for audiences are poor
in every sense oi the word. We
have, without the slightest
doubt, the worst pool and pool
building in the Midwest Confer-
ence. The present pool is inade-
quate tor competitive swim-
ming, Red Cross instruction,
White Caps synchronized swim-
ming, and recreational SWlm-
ming.

The administration and Board
of Trustees are well aware of
the existing need for a new pool.
The administration has had
some tentative plans drawn up
for a swimming pool—recreation
building complex. Mr. Stauss
has told me that another capi-
tal fund drive will be launched
in three or four years with the
construction of this building
definitely in mind.

I was happy to learn that the
administration and Trustees are
going to do something about
our swimming pool dilemma.
However, I think We. the stu
dents, should also take an ac-
tive interest in the problem, We
ought to try to convince our
families and other people i -
tcrested and potentially inter-
ested in Grinnell
specify that their donation he

that we feel obligated to play a
responsible part in the improve

third and sixth graders of the
South may be reading, Burma
explained. The general content
is that God made the white and
black people dilterent; God
knows best: red and white
chickens do not intermix, and
neither should White and black
people; Americans did not want
black slaves but Were forced to

slaves; white and black people
do not use the same bathrooms
and do not want to.

Discrimination and prejudice
can also come from individual
psychological difficulties. Indi-
vidual desires may be blocked
by something against which
they cannot rebel. This free
iloating aggression may be
used against the Negroes, a
group which cannot hit back,
according to Burma.

lungu: Africa Gets Rotten Press

To the Editor:

The treatment 0| Africa and
its n‘AKlOl’I'ttl leaders by the West-
ern press, almost \vithoui ex-
ceptlon, has been little short oi
scandalous, This has been espe-
Clally true since Ghana inaugu-
rated its iirst Africanvled gov

mah.

it seems that during this pe
riod of the “Cold War” Amel'ir
cans are not willing to accept
countries and governments
that do not Conform to the
image they desire or whose
economic policies are not a
ceptable to their business i
teresm, Therefore they use the
press and other opinion-forming
agencies to support or destroy
the governments or African
leaders that. do not conform to
the leaders they desire. In the
creation or this image certain
press correspondents are notor»
ions for their animosity toward
certain countries and leaders.
Almost invariably, the leaders
that they hate are those who
seem determined to follow a
policy oi their own choosing.

The role of Correspondents in
destroying these leaders follows
a definite pattern. Although the
pattern has over and over
proved inaccurate or dissipated,
the practice still continues up
to this minute. For example, at
an earlier time Nasser was de-
picted as a "Communist."
When this did not stand up, he
was depicted as a tool for the

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

it was spring and, as it so oiien does. it had
instilled the milk OI human klndness in my veins.
I was at peace with the World and all of God’s
creatures The sun had soothed my angry brow
and robin's song and gentle breeze had calmed
my Whiter-rattled nerves.

And 1 went to the bookstore to purchase some
toilet items.

“Leave that book an the shelves."

My reverie was shaitered. “l'm sort-y,
did you say?"

With less palience, “Your book, leave it on the
shelves up there. Can’t you read the Sign” Don't
you know you can’t bring your book into the book-
store?"

“Oh, I'm sorry, i just wasn't thinking. lt’s spring
you know."

“Well, try thinking next lime.”

Her unspi-ing-likc liosnlity shocked the tram my
thoughts or the idyllic months or summer that lay
waiting oulya iew short weeks ahead.

1 put my book or verse that l had so recently
bten reading while sitting under a trce on the
shelves indicated to me,

i went about my business and selected a tooth

and my iancy had turned lightly to .

“Yeah liid, it's your turn. That hair tonic is 81

what

cents, the shaving cream 98 cents, and the tootlb
paste is 70 cents. That’s $2.55 plus three cents tax
for a total of $2.58.”

“I’ll need a check . . . from the Poweshiek Coun-
ty National Bank.“

“Didn’t they give you any or youi own?”

“Sure, sure, but I don’t have my book with me."

“Well, you should, Be sure you put your hall,
home address. ramily doctor and blood type under
your signature."

“Sure thing, lust llke always."

"And put your checking account number on it.”

"My checliing account number?” i stopped rilling
out the check,

“Yes, it's printed on your regular checks. Put
it on that one.”

“You mean all those electronic hiei-oglyphics
they have on the bottom? My God, I Can't even
read those let alone write them.” I was already
tearing up my checli.

“I’m sorry. We Citn'l cash the check unless that

number's there,"
“Don’t I even get some credit tor being able to
pronounce Poweshick correctly?" She wasn’tl
amused. 1
"it you can’t pay tor ilic purchase. put the stud
back."

I did. I went downtown and bought the slit“. They

And they smiled.

 

Communists The fact that Nash
ser had outlawed the Commu-
nist Party in Egypt and was
clearly set out on an independ
ent course made absolutely no
difference!

Incidentally. African leaders
long ago discovered that it isn't
important what steps they take
to demonstrate their independr
ence, if it fits the gimmick of
the Western press to charge
them with being “Communist”
or “Communist Stooges," truth
will have nothing to do with it.
so they pay no attention one
way or another to th ese
charges. and are not in the
least influenced by them.

Africans in the United States
eventually find out that the
American press has only one

concern about Africa as a con-
tincnt, and its leaders, and that
is: where do they tit In the
“cold war”? This is also true
of the individual leaders. If the
press determines that a leader
does not fit into their cold war
plans, they proceed to destroy
him. Felix Lungu

Individualism. Responsibility
Re-examined by Miss Smith

To the Editor

In Miss Yenawine‘s letter of‘

last week the Grinnell sludentsl

were accused of an egocentric in-l

dlvidualism which lacks the (18-:

gree oi personal responsibility
which is, according to her, desir-‘
able. Surely personal responsibi i-
ty cannot be scoffed at — and law ‘
students would I believe, deny that .
it. is desirabi but Miss Yenawinel
has used it interchangeably witbl
responsibility for others, and a dis-
tinction, I think. must be made.
The observance that the new
breed of individualism which has
cropped up in the last several‘
years lacks an element oi respon-l
sibility to others is somewhat well-
founded. There is, among many
students, an unwillingness to take:
responsibility for the behavior or
others or to be responsible to oth-
ers for their own behavior. Per?
sonal responsibility implies a will»
ingness to take responsibility iori

one’s own actions, is it possible to
have both? I doubt it. I can be re—
sponsible for my own behavior
only if i am tree to do so (note,
please, the “positive” use of the
word “free"), and I cannot be free
to do so if I am being constantly
badgered by others who reel equal-
ly called upon to be my guardian.
The only way in which the two
kinds of responsibility can be can
existent to the same degree is it
every individual evaluates his be
havior in the same way as do his
peers. Gl'innell. thank God, is still
far from that situation.

Concern for fellow students' wel-
fare is another of Miss Yenawme's
pleas. Welfare. it seems to me, re-
fers to the Creation of Cami ons

ing a reasonably stable existence.

David Lighthourne —
letters to Mother

Warren the crooks subterranean apartment
party got off to a predictably fast start when the
host made his enirance with three cases of stolen
beer. Casual and .I had been looking for a Good Life
all day and were in the process or interviewing
Ruga Snell, a recently returned wanderer. No one,
in tact, had seen Ruga since he had quit high school
and taken oh on a motorcycle tor Gallup, New
Mexico. four years ago. Ruga had explained at the
tune that Gallup was the only un»American town
left in the country. Willi that he had roared out of
town that fateful day, goggles, and a black cowboy
hat headlong into the wind. Now, as the morn
filled with pretty girls and a Rolling Stones record
began to play, our conversation continued.

”I believe it was Cervantes who said that all affec-
tations are bad, Ruga. why don’t you take nit that
cowboy hat?”

“Leave him alone, Warren the crock, We're in
the middle of an interesting conversation."

“I know. I just wanted to tell you that Lhere's a

. girl with ratted hair at Llie door who ‘says she's
looking for your friend. Should i let her In?”

”Rock stomp, man. That's my good dolly. Send
her in."

“By the way, Casual, are you ever going to tell
me uho that girl is? You've been putting me off too
long."

“0K. man, but like i can't tell you her name be—
cause she's like related to the new president and
won't tell me of it either. Now, don't tell her I

slipped you the good word, man "

“What do you mean, new president? New president
of what?"

“0! the college, man. They’re gonna announce it
pretty soon. New like excuse me, man, before
Warren trolls over and hustles my dolly. Later."

“That friend oi yours is quite a character. Where
did you ever run into him?"

“You mean Casual? He just drove into town one
day with a carload oi electric guitars and has been
living oil the college ever since. I’d like to find out
What kind of president they've finally decided (in,
but that girl probably couldn't tell me anything
anyway. It's quite a thing, you know, trying to find
a good college president."

“Yeah, I suppose it is. rm waiting for the day
when they start choosing presidents tor their pers-
pective instead of theu‘ business abilities. That’s
the whole problem these days, the way I look at it.
Colleges should be kept as separate irom the rest
of society as possible. There shouldn’t be any kind
of continuity between higher education and pro-
fessions or professional training. Colleges should
point out things like the fact that the cost of living
in our present society is simply too great.”

“I know what you mean, Ruga. but I don't know
it you're right. it all depends on whether you can
find the Good Life inside present society or in some
kind oi fringe society."

“Well, maybe your new president can answer
that."

 

Memphis ‘liberal Cily' Say LeMoyne GrinneIIians

(Ed Note: The ioilowing is the
continuation or a report trom Le-
Moyiio College by Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens, Grinnell students
who are studying at the Memphis
college this semester.)

In spite of its proximity to the

intamy oi Mississippi, Memphis
is a liberal city and most of its
citizens are proud of the pro-
gress which has been made
here. We have experienced only
a iew examples of an ardent
segregationist belief.

Our first encounter was with
a white taxi driver of the stats
ure of Ichabod Crane, who we
asked Without thinking to take
us to LeMoyne College. His imr
mediate reaction, which is still
quite clear in mind, was:
"What do y'all want to go to a
nigger school like that for?“

When coming back to Le
Moyne late one night, we
chanced to catch a bus on
which we were the only two
passengers, The bus driver’s
comments on civil rights ran
like this: “You probably don't
know any niggras. (He recog»
nized our northern accent.)
They're violent people. How’d
.you like to have one for your
boss?"

What do these people have in
common? Fear of a violent, in.
tense people. Pride in a loftier
culture. which means simply a
higher standard of living be-
cause of better economic op-
portunities. Belief in the con-
tention that the Negro is by na-
ture crude, brutal, dirty. base.
dishonest, inferior.

We asked the question, which
to us has an obviuus answer:
“But isn't the turbulence 0f the
Negro a product oi his environ
ment? If he had equal employ-
ment opportunities, wouldn’t it
be different?"

But the obviouit is denied.
Other questions are answered
as if they were being read off
the segregationist ﬂash cards.

 

Throughout the conversation
there is a painfully apparent
lack of reliance upon reason
and tact other than personal
experience. The only defense
offered for segregation is an
irrational emotional appeal and
a vague reference to a habit of
life.

There are other evidences of
segregation in Memphis, how-
ever, Two weeks ago one of the
largest churches in the city, the
Second Presbyterian Church,
with a membership of 3,600 in
wealthy east Memphis, opened
its doors for the first time to a
Negro. The papers reported the
event in the iollowing manner:
“No one seemed to pay any at-
tention to the lone Negro who
was in the balcony." However,
as a direct result of this event,
200 members quit the congrega-

tion to form a fundamentalist
Bible group. It is still to be de-
termined Whether a mixed
group will be allowed to enter
the church. As in this church,

Pepsi denerot‘ionr' ﬁuzzies It Up
To @eﬁeﬁt Foreign Student Fund

Grinnell‘s “Pepsi genera-

bottles of pop during the iast
year, and in the process has
made $3,123 for the benefit of
foreign students.

John Fisk, Ray Langham, anti

eign Student Board is ‘to as-
sist foreign students in any
way necessary — in problems
of a personal, financial, or
cultural nature."

Fisk explained that foreign
students come to Grinnell un-
der the auspices of many di -
ferent programs, and it is the
duty of the FSB to keep in
touch with them and their
needs.

“Our goal is to have each

foreign student make himself
sufficient In our society,” Fisk

 

said. “If they are self»sui‘li-
cient when they got here," he
continued, "we do not have a
great deal of concern With
them”

The_ FSB does not plan activ-
ities for the foreign students.
Rather, it works with them un-
der a policy which calls for the
board to make itself available,
and encourage foreign students
to arrange their own actiVlties.
it frequently assists foreign
students, however, with finan-
cial and cultural problems. All
of its activities are handled on
a personal and confidential ba-
SlSr

An interesting part of the
work, which the maintenance
of the Pepsi machines involves,
is that the “supply boys” who
work with Fisk find it their
duty to check the pop machines
in Loose hall basement, to see,
of course, that they are prop-
erly filled. When questioned.
these students, Wendell Webb
and Ray Langham, said that
they find their [ask not un-
pleasant.

An interesting sidelight of
the financial aspects of the pro<
gram was explained by Fisk.
Rather than the loss one might
expect on breakage of bottles.
a net gain is realized. This Si
uation arises because students
bring pop from off campus and
return the empty bottles to the
racks of the campus Pepsi ma-
chines.

The News Students’ Days ac-
tivities for foreign students are
overseen by the FSB, and it
accepts the responsibility of
seeing that all foreign students
have plans for vacations, in-
cluding travel plans, and as-
sisting them, when necessary,
in finding summer jobs.

The FSB works in close co-
operation with Dale Terry, reg-
istrar, who is the adviser for
foreign students, and Leforne
Sequeira, director of student
aid.

Editor Discovers Wild New Jag
To Fill Reporter's Spring Days

By Anne Farrer

Spring doesn’t grab you? The
weather’s great but your Rus-
sian hist exam isn’t? Your hay
feliel‘ activates every morning
from 6:00 to 9:47? The lounges
are too warm and the golf
course is too cold? Frustration,
boredom, the gods, and Dean
Slocum rule your life? You’re
panting for change and kicks?

Do not despair, for just as it
strives to report the news ac-
curately and well, the SM; feels
a responsibility toward and kin-
ship with the Grinnell student
body. Thus, compassionate edi-
tor John Wolf has devised a
new jag; although it doesn’t
have the infamous aura or sub-
sequent effects of glue-sniffing,
it does have its effects. What is
this saviour-toebe of the nor-
mal, average, wall—Crawling

sues 0f the Journal of the Pro-
ceedings of the Iowa Academy

different — whoever heard of
anyone eagerly charging to the
library to pore over and devour
journals or the Iowa Academy
of Science? Let’s face it, abso-
lutely no one However, all is
not entirely (though almost)
lost.

Perusing the musty volumes,
one encounters many facts and
statements that do much to re-
store one’s faith in man, nature,
and science. Such is the article
presenting the problem of “How
old is the Mississippi?” which
draws the truly profound Cone
clusion, “Its prototype must

have existed at a certain fixed
time in the geologic past.”
The names of the writers are
as varied as the topics they deal
with—everything from Launce-
lot Andrews to Bruce Fink;
from “Origin of the Present
Drainage System of Warren
County" (if there happens to
be any romantics or historians
around with manias for 1891
drainage systems) to “Study of
Glands in the Hop Tree" (for
anyone suffering from mono).

The prophetic value of sci
ence is welleillustrated With the
following excerpt irom an 1890
dissertation: ”In connection
with a Casual reference to the
cenological features of Central
Iowa, mention may be made
to the recent discovery in the
drift of a mass of soft ferrugi»
nous sandstone charged with
fossils," to which anyone who
has noticed the construction of
the library or has had much ex»
perience in Burling basement
will readily attest.

Any hug for homey historical
highlights would be gratified to
discover that at Ames in 1894:
“During the month of Septem»
her, Mr. G. W. Carver brought
in a fine lot of The Apple Powr
dery Mildew." This might also
prompt some patriotic Grinnel-
lian, not wishing to be outdone
by Amos, some lunch-time to
donate his apple fritter to the
cause of science.

 

In concluding his stimulating
evening, the frustrated student
might chase down all this en-
lightening information with the
“Geological Section of the
YMCA Artesian Well at Cedar
Rapids” and employ “Synopsis
of Paleozoic Echinoids” as a
night Cap. Or better yet, he
could beat it to the Rex, and
there impatiently bide his time
hoping, praying, and living for
Spring Riot.

b ‘We Don'i Serve Mixed Groups'

(Continued from Page 3)

places is only nominal, Walk
into the Pancake House down-
town in a mixed group and you
will shortly hear the words:
"I’m sorry. we don't serve
mixed groups. it you will sit at
separate tables. I'll be glad to
serve you.” Or perhaps the
waitress will put down three
plates for the three Negroes
and ignore the white person,
saying: “I have to serve them
but I don't have to serve you,"
an erroneous assumption. The
question why? is unanswerable

and out of place in this situa-
tion.

One white Mississippiau said
that all the Negroes he knew
would like to get their hands on
James Meredith for forcing the
situation the way he did. A

white middle class couple told
us of a social structure in which
a good name was the most im-
portant thing. This is the aris-
tocracy and the good name is
its tradition. Here the place of
the Negro is in the homeY the
white home. This position pm~
yides honor, security, and live-
lihood for the Negro. He is
treated with dignity and respect
in his subservient role. But
what about the Negro with a
college education? Flash cards
again, but no answer. Then they
say Negroes have only been ex

DISCOUNT CENTER

 

posed to civilization for IOU
years; consequently, their so»
cial customs and education
have not evolved to the degree
of the White institutions. But
isn't it rather that ﬂiese things
have been held back and isn't
education really something to
be gained Within the lifetime of
each individual and not some-
thing which evolves? Again the
flash cards, but no answelx

But there is light even in this
darkness. There is a feeling of
guilt about the crimes of Philae
delphia and Selma. Sheriff
Rainey and his cohorts do not
represent the South and their
actions are inexcusable and uns
justifiable. In some places there
is a certain pride attached to
having a decent relationship
with a Negro. And recently, the
most influential businessmen’s
organization in Mississippi has
ofﬁcially approved the Civil
Rights Bill as right, good. and
necessary, but perhaps only at
the threat of suspension oi fed-
eral aid.

In conclusion, as was noted
in New Orleans, the confeder-
ate flag still flies front and

center in the parade, but now
there is a Negro in the band
that is playing Dixie.

Grinnell students Meg Eluhm,
Cynthia Brust. Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens are now in resi-
dence at LeMoyne.

Rare Gas Research
Is Physicisi’s Topic

By Susan Barquist

The noble (rare. inert) gases
have intrigued chemists and
physicists since their discovery.
Tuesday evening Dr, Howard
Claassen spoke to an ACS
meeting on this interesting top-
ic. Dr. Claassen, oi the depart
ment or physics at Wheaton Col-
lege, gave a brief history or
work on the rare gas elements,
describing in detail research at
the Argonne National Labora»
iory. '

The history of rare gases be-
gan in 1894 when argon was
first isolated from air. By 1900
all the “inert" gases had been
discovered. Claassen indicated
that the notion of their ”inert-
ness” has been doubted from
time to time since their dis-
covery.

Claassen described the activ-
ity and surprises ot the re-
search lab as a group of scien-
tists worked to synthesize the
first clearly identified rare gas
compound—xenon tetrafluoride.
With a laugh he told of a by-
product which formed in the
traps of the apparatus and ex-
ploded when warmed. \

During the question period
Dr. Claassen answered the ex
pected — “What uses do these
rare gas compounds have?"—
With a calm “The research sci-
entist doesn't usually think oi
such things.

Although spring is nearly up

“The first day of school the

shut-out at Carleton last week-
end 7-0 only to come back on

ceptionally strong this year,
pulled all the stops last week
end and didn't allow a single
Grinnell win. The match was
played inside the Carleton gym

were llnplayably wet.

more in evidence, Grinnell en-
tertained Knox here in Grin-

By Don Kilrasch

Guess what, everybody? The
IM jocks have a brand new
softball field. This wonderful
new acquisition is appropriate
1y called “Stables Field,"
though the title may be some-
what inaccurate, as no self-re-
specting horse would be caught
responding to the call of nature
on that field. Stables Field Will
provide a wholly different con-
cept of softball, as leftrfielders
go cavorting downhill after long
ﬂies, and catchers tumble down
ditches after foul balls. It will
be interesting to count the num-
ber of twisted ankles that turn
up as iielders and baserunners
alike desperately try to avoid
the gopher holes and minia-
ture moats on this obstacle
course.

The beauty of this field can—
not begin to be described—you
really have to see it, If the late
Robert Frost had ever seen
Stables Field, his immediate
response would have been to
pukel Then, too, he might con-

 

ceivably have become “late" a
lot sooner.

Be that as it may, the soft-
ball season got started a day
late last Tuesday. It’s still pretr
ly early to be making any ac-
curate predictions, of course,
bilt it looks to me like West.
Clark, and maybe Smith, will
be in contention for the crown,
But don’t put any money on
it, because I also pick the Cubs
to win the National League
pennant every year.

Last Sunday saw West take
first iii the 1M Bowling tour-
ney, It was a hectic after-
noon, with each ball close on
the heels of the one before, Sec-
ond and third place went to
Dibble and Smith respectively.

Yet to be played are track
and golri There especially
seems to be a tremendous
amount oi enthusiasm ior goli,
as many of the IM golfers have
been walking out to the golf
course wini their girl iriends,
presumably to check the lay
out of the course. Good golf-
ing, iellasi *

The Pioneer baseball team
fell to Central College Tuesday
14-7, The Pioneers got behind
9-0 in the iirst three innings and
were never able to threaten

Pioneers as they gave up 8 un-
earned runs while Central only
allowed Grinnell one unearned
run.

Barry Anderson started on the
mound for the Pioneers and
gave up nine runs in the three
innings he pitched. Dave SchatZ
ﬁnished up for Grinnell by give
ing up only three hits but five
runs.
