THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN AN ERA 0F CRISIS

The symposium was initiated and planned by a
student committee All ot the maior stuclt‘nt orgal
zatrons on campus. including student government. art
supporting the program As rvplained belou. the syiw
p‘osium committee intends to arr-misc tor interested
students to wrltc background papc on all sub-topics
In this manner student interest \\‘Ill be awakened long
beiorc the iormnl plogram is presented on our turn
pus. Such paper-writing will be done with the tuli
cooperation of the incultv.

1. PURPOSE

The goal of the symposium is to provide the Gl'iii‘
nell College student body and faculty. and the
rounding community with a siiiiitilatliisv evaluation
of the democratic pi‘oce in this country Stress Will

be placed on how the process woi ks and how well
it works. .

Both or these questions are valid oncs icr consid-

ntion. As our government continues to expand in
.2e and ptnvcr, it cpnrurrcntlv seems to grow more
distant lrom the individual There is a shocking luck
ct' understanding as to how our dcmocracv iuncticns.
it is oul hope that our.symposlum can help hll this
void ot knowledge But perhaps more important we
must :rv to answer the questlnii as to how well thc
proccss is functioning. Democracy is ndcr ‘dttack irom
nu areas. Thc c at as lcvcled akaliist it come from
leads of rmer. . nations nnd leaders oi the plann-
cd socicucs. Even in the Umlcd States our own pub
licntitins cxpi . bewilderment in Chargin at the seem-
ing meiiiciency and trivclity at our representative
system

Undoubtedly, we are livilie‘ in an era of crisis Call
the slow. deliberative process at dcmocracv meat the
demands oi such rill Era" It is to answer such quess
lions that We plan this symposium,

II. BACKGROUND

The Gl'inlicll community is (in Exciting place for
such a discussion. The faculty and student body llzivc
a continuous concern with national and international
affairs, In addition to Li velV l‘lCll Series of lecture-
shlps. which this year has included Senators Golds
Water und McCarthy. Justice William 0. Douglas. Dr.
Rollo May and Dr Arnold Tovnbee, Gl'lnnell College
is lcrttlnale to have a Program in Practical Political
Education which yeal'lv provides a varied pl'escntur
tion of practical political Events This program and
the student involvement in it provides zi constant
stimuli which the symposium program will be able

to utilize.

Also. it is important to nolc that in lhc [all or
tool. the rollege sponsored u conicrcncc on Latin
American Alia Although we do not plan to strtin
tuic the symposium exactly as this conference was
Slluctured. it has providrd experience in relating
such a program to the student body, Many of. the
same techniques, such as baC'el'mmd papers written
by students, which were cmrcmely successiui then
will be used in the svmposium Diagram

ill. STRUCTURE

The symposium will be divided into (little sub-
topics Each or these shall have a planning committee
responsible for compiling bibliographies on the topic.
tiliall lug att‘angements l'or the speakers, providing
hospitality tor our guests. and all ‘lElng ior students
to write papers on the topic. Th sub-topic com-
niiltees Will be dircctlv responsible to the symposium
planning committee It is our desire to have each
pub-topic to be a complete pros in in it<elt'. yct bc
an integral part oi the total pi gram.

It -s our present plan to havc each lecturer give
at least one public lecture and their later participate
on a panrl with other guests concerned with the sum
topic Nuluialll’. utii‘ :tlesl lecturer will also nieel
with studcnl groups miormallv.

‘0 ‘;_Curl Lamb

Relaxing in a large Chair in his room at Grin-

neil House, Konyama Chiuinc. the Minister of
Education of Nyasatand, remarked on the irony
or his oiricial State Department tour of the Unite
cd States Just three years earlier. Chiume had
spent some tune in the United States upon exile
here his native country at the time his Malawi
Congress Party iinally emerged as a threat to
British rule thoie.

At that time, also, the State Department was
keeping a caretul watch over Chiumc. In the
three short years since that time. the rapid
flux or Airican politics has elevated Chitimc to
the position or Minister or Education and Social
Development of the soonstosbe independent
British protectorate oi Nyasaland.

There is one oualirication for membership
in the “power elite” of a new African nation
asserted Chiulne: “identification with the colonial
struggle." As African states finally abandon
their colonial status. the previous requirements
of an Oxford or Harvard decree hecomc “not
all that important.” Personal experience with
colonial persecution serve as a loyaltv oathsins
action to eliminate those ”shepherds" that would
“desert their flock in a storm.”

One or Mr. Chiume’s iii-st projects upon his
appointment as Minister of Education was to
embark on a ten-fold men use in secondary
school enrollment. He is also interested i In-
crcascd collece opportunities [or the M' uwi.
During the California portion oi his tour. Chiui e
hopes to observe “Disneyland and the California
Junior College system.”

Although he expects Iew insights Irom the
iormcr. the latter interests him as a means to
broaden the base or Malawi citizens with hiohci
education. Operating in an area in which “necesr
sity is ottcn the matter of invention." Chiumc
feels that the introduction at an abbreviated
college experience could prove an important
educational innovation.
> For a continent in n “terrible hurrv" cvcn
lol‘l’ years is too long to wait for desperately
needed civil servants, technicians, and govern—
ment leaders. An ”established piece or paper”
granted atter tour years or college has little
meaning when compared to the task of building
a nation ironi scratch.

The flexibility of credits and emphasts on
student initiative in the American higher ctlu»
cational system impressed Mr, chiume. He trit
that, by contrast, the British s stem was a
spoon-red, “pat-0il—the»l)ack" alter-nut . Things
British rarely rarecl well when Submltted to the
exileeinadeemin' te s close scrutiny and keen uit.

Chiumc rema :ed pointedly that in all the
years or his t a mug as a teacher he had never
studied the history of Nyasaland His education
had consisted of mastering “Victoria, ‘ both
Charles‘ and Cromwelrs, and tracing the railroad
lines from Liver-pool to Manchester"

The birth at the Malawr lstory program
took place in a rail several ycais ago when Dr
Banda, the present Prime Minister at Nyasaland
lound hiinselt imprisoned with some teachers
similarly persecuted for their political beliefs
In that cell the teachers taught Dr. Banda their
disciplines and he in turn outlined to them the
history of the country that had then relected
him but which he was later to load to inde-

Umemoto: Confusion in laos, Efﬁciency in Thailand .

‘Ed. note: The following is the last of a two»part
series by Steve Umcmoto, Gl'ilmell travel scholar.

The atmosphere in Huey Sai is rather
strange, All about are soldiers, theii poorly kept
khaki uniforms cont ting sharply with the ma-
roon barets they wear. They are the remains of
the ‘itiving army that tied the Pl llets 1 st
summer There are over 1100 of them living with
tlleir iamilies ill has ily constructed bamboo
houses along the river. While walking among
these llnl es I couldn’t help but feel that the
men had little interest ill ally war or fighting.
The uniforms they wore were the only sign they
were soldiers as most of them seemed to spend
the day lounging around their homes, sleeping
in the shade of the hat or perhaps sitting at the
edge of the road bouncing a baby on one kliee.
The most interesting thing about them, how-
ever, was the fact that they all seemed to have
the necessities of life (including new bicycles
and transistor radios) which seemed very
strange for an area cut o‘i‘l' from its political and
military headquarters alld iii a country experi-
encing severe inflation. I learned later that this
group as well as other isolated non-communist
detachments are being supported almost wholly
by U. S. military old

We paid a visit to the American doctor at
the 15-bed Thomas A. Dooley hospital net ' the
fort. He told us that from what he has gathered
iii the last few months, the soldiers have a coil-
ception of neither what they are fighting for
nor against. Every day some of these same sol-
diers, who are so poorly trained that they 1 e—
qnently shoot themselves while cleaning rifles,
go marching off into the forest, ostensibly to
hold the area against the Pathet Lao. The doc—
tor told me that he got brave one day and ueiit
Walking ill the forest and came upon the patrol

town. Why hadn’t they gone further? They were
al'i'aid. There ' really very little keeping the
Patliets from taking the whole area.

Tile things We saw iii Laos certainly tended
to emphasize the ical ineffectiveness of the
present government in dealin' vith the situ-
ation there. Apparently the o ials from the
capital ill Vienti lie cannot even reach sncli
places s Ilucv Sai The much too large group
01' oil ials ill the village must work on its own,
spending a good part of the day sleeping and
playing tennis on'the coliit z oss from the post
office where the man will hire aii‘ . stamps be-
cause only a [001 would use them on letters that
would never go anywher

In sharp contrast, Tli lid is a relative p'
ture of governmental efficiency. Because Th2 ,
lalid is still technically in a period of revloution
(since 1958) and Lin marshall law (most pecr
ple never notice); all authority comes from the
top. For the most part the government maili-
tains tight control on all activities in the public
sector (and on many considered to be ill the pri-
vate sector). Tlle fact that the present Thai
government is author an is _certainly undisA
putable but the ‘uiipopu ar with the people’ tag
which has occasionally cropped up in the Ameri-
can press reveals iil my mind a lack of under-
standing of the Thai people, I am convinced
that the average Farming people (who make up
about 75%; of the population) of Thailand do
not understand nor care about the futlire ‘demo—
cracy' that the present regime is promising. The
average farmer believes the King is the head 01'
the government and he knows that he alld his
family have for the most part not been hungry
For many years because the government has
built irrigation projects and has helped him sell

his rice.

It isn’t always easy to accept the hospit
ol' the Thai country people for one might
lliinsell' sitting eross»legged on the floor for as
long as three or four hours at a time. As I was
in this somewhat uncomfortable position in a
village near Chieligmai a couple oi' months ago
I decided to take special note of just what my
host talked about iii all attempt to learn oi" his
chicl’ concerns in life. After politely speaking
first with me because [ \ l foreigner, he then
proceeded to discuss his plans (or planting this
year’s riee crop and his interest ill several sec-
ond cropsi After this he worked around to his
friends and family. He hoped that all his young
ellildren (having 4 already) would ‘be able to
go to school for 4 years and that the boys
would come back and help lliln in the rice fields,
Ill Thailand, this man with his 2 or 3 acres of
land is average, but in most of the rest of Asia
he would be rather well-to-do. Most important
of all is the fact that this man and millions of
others ill this country like him are satisfied and
have the necessities of life.

Authoritr mism may not be a popular word,
but in Thailand it has brought the stability
which has enabled the country to develop into
one of the most advanced agricultural countries
of Asia. Perhaps Thailand’s advantage stems
from the fact that her authoritarianism has al-
n ys been interl l, for this is the only country
of Southeast Asia which never came under :0—
loninl domination. Whatever the reason the peo«
ple of Thailand are today eating, growing, and
building while so many of their neighbors are
rioting, destroying, and starving. It’s little
wonder that millions of Thai support their gov-
ernment despite its corruption, favoritism, and
authoritarialiism.

The lM board vetoed a

something like a windy rain
