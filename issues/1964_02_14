The north campus social chairman and soutll campus
:oclal chairman asked house council and baffleboard members
or a pledge to enforce open room policy last Sunday. Their
reasons were tllat they could not take responsibility for an
unenforced open room program this semester and that the
college was in serious danger of losing the program if such
a pledge were not made.

Yesterday, the two chairman met with the social planning
board to decide the fate of open rooms this semester. The
rogram of open rooms was extended to all but the four
lialls—Haines, South Younker, Dibble, and Langan—which
failed to guarantee enforcement.

The action has had some unfortunate aspects. First,
there was no claim from the administration that college of-
ficials were any more seriously concerned with enforcement
procedures recently than in past semesters.

Second, there was no pressure from the administration
for a statement of this nature if open rooms were to be
preserved; the possibility that a new dean of men might review
the program next fall and the fact that no opens were sched-
uled during the interim session (nor have there been any
during past interims) were the only “threats.”

Third, the action was poorly timed. House councils were
iven only a few days to decide whether to sign the pledge.
ad a similar proposal been raised later in the semester,

after open roolns for this semester had been scheduled and
assured, there would have been time to discuss and weigh
the alternatives.

Fourth, the purpose of the proposal was not explained
adequately. The result was widespread uncertainty in many
balls. Many house council members simply didn’t want to

ledge themselves to be ubiquitous patrolmen. Others felt
hat the pledge implied previous laxity ill enforcement Others
didn‘t feel a pledge by this year’s house councils would
guarantee a continuation of enforcement next year.

The Board of Trustees, however, has never spelled out
what steps would be requisite to making the present experi»
mental program permanent. Perhaps the reason for the unfor'
tunate present situation is that no one knows the exact mature
qualities we are supposed to be displaying. ls student re-
sponsibility to be measured by student ability to strictly en-
force present rules? Should we enforce less strictly and see
that rumors of the “irresponsible minority” aren’t spread? Or
are there other qualities the administration and the Board
of Trustees would like us to manifest?

Most students want open rooms to continue; at present
no one is sure of what we are supposed to do to insure their
continuation. J

W

Students tend to be very short-sighted when they look
[or the answer to Grinnell’s open dorm policy. Although they
can say a great deal concerning the situation, the attitude
prevails that the less done about it the better.

The head social chairman of North and South campus
must be applauded for what appears to be outstanding courage
along with an impressive amount of insight. They were not
afraid to admit that their program would most likely fail
to function properly under existing conditions. Neither did
they hide the fact. that responsible action involved positive
student enforcement. Theirs was a lonely action of self-
respollsihility. ‘

Students were shocked, at first, that they were being
called upon to act. Many had failed to acquaint themselves
with the concept that positions of leadership demanded more
than the acceptance of pUSlt10n#f01‘ in the past year there
have been many accepting positions, and few giving leadership.

The idea of students affirming that they would take that
responsibility of enforcing open dorms caused a lot of static
across campus. But, by the end of the week the majority
of students had indicated that they were willing to take the
responsibility for their positions in a new effort to enforce the
open dorm policy. If such action can be carried out, it will
add to the value of the policy itself and will undoubtedly
solve some of its problems. Perhaps in time it will lead to
an expanded and improved program.

Those who refused to affirm a position of enforcement
and gave no reason for this refusal were able to lose them-
selves in lofty phrases about the demands of the proposition,
or about self made theories on rules in general. (This does
not include those halls which didn’t sign the o iginal state-
ment out drew up propositions of their own indicating their
desire to continue enforcement.) But those refusing to sign
any document could not hide the simple facts. Their refusal
illustrated that these individuals were not willing to direct,
themselves toward the responsible action that their positions
represented.

Letters to the Editor

Abernathy Relates Editorial on Interim Session and 11A

T0 the Editor:
The editorial in the last 8&3
seemed to carry its thrust
along two main lines: (1) The
underclassmen (freshmen and
sophomores) feel little incen-
tive or necessity to study dur<
ing the interim session, since
there are no individually ogient—
ed interests; (2) the possible
interests of the juniors are con»
slructed by the requirements
of the JLA exam. In both cases
the result is a wasted interim
because of a lack of individual
focus in the session itself. I
would suggest rather that there
may be a lack of individual
focus in the individual himself.
Dr. Kuntz’s letter last week
offers the answer to point l~
“The job of learning to be your
own boss. . . . is difficult,” Col-
lege is the place to learn both
the good and the bad of wasted
time; we should stress the
promise of the interim.

With respect to point 2, 1
think the editorial has gone
awry. The JLA syllabus does
not restrain interests; indeed,
its value lies precisely in its
wide applicability, its possibil-
ity, its openness. In terms of
the purposes of the examina-
tion, this year’s syllabus was,
in my opinion, very good.

Essential elements of

Tom Fullmer /
Miscellany and Digression

This past week the North and
South Campus Social Chair-
men have proposed a new ap-
proach to rule enforcement
which could set a precedent
for not only the Grinnell can-l,»
pus but perhaps for all socie-
ties which experience problems
in rule enforcement. The social
chairmen have run up against
the impossbility of the contin-
uation of the openrdorm pro-
gram in the light of the failure
of students to live by and en-
force the rules under which the
program was set up.

As a last ditch effort to save
the openrdorm program, they
have distributed a pledge to be
signed by the members of the
house councils and baffleboards
of each hall. By signing the
pledge these students would
agree to accept thalr responsi-
bility for enforcing the open-
dorm rules as listed in the stu»
dent handbook.

Thus all problems concerning
enforcement would be solved
by the signing of a pledge
which would commit 'the
signees to Carry out the jobs
which they have previously
been selected to fulfill. Tile pos-
sibilities for this type or ap
proach are almost unlimited.

I would suggest that, as a

three schemes of order could
be mastered in two or three
days' reading; the lectures giv»
on were adequate to cement the
ideas and to suggest the possi-
bilities inherent in the ideas.
The bulk of the preparatory
task demanded Creative and
imaginative understanding of
previously learned knowledge
as related to new categories of
historical importance. The task
not only permitted but also de
manded some individually ini-
tiated focus. A student with
ideas about his major academic
interests and their relation to
the currents in intellectual his-
tory should have been well pre
pared. The interim session pro-
vided the opportunity and the
incentive for an imaginative
widening of personal interests.

it is important that there
were no correct answers to the
exam; students with a sense of
intellectual continuity should
have completed the test easily.
if the junior student desires to
he liberally educated, then the
interim and exam were oppor-
tunities:

It seems that academic de-
sire is present in students with
a sense of their own individual
focus. The focus and corres-

the pending desire must come from

safeguard, pledges might be
distributed to these same peo
ple which would pledge them to
uphold their obligations to en-
force thc regulations of the
open-dorm program.

If this plan succeeds in sav-
ing the open dorm program it
might also be used whenever
students feel enforcement of
other rules might be desirable.
Pledges might be distributed
which deal with fireworks,
liquor, or quiet hours which
would pledge the house counr
oils and baffleboards to enforce
these or any other rules which
appear in the handbook.

A more radical step would be
to have all students sign
pledges obligating them not to
break specific rules listed in
the handbook. This Would mean
that agencies for student en-
forcement could be done away
with, On second thought, the
lack of student enforcement
would not be a radical change
at all.

Just imagine the tremendous
effect such a pledging program
could have in solving problems
of all Societies. Corruption of
the police could be solved by
having all policemen sign a

responsible people on the spot. Perhaps it was an unusual
place for them to find themselves, but the reaction has been
more than interesting. It speaks not only to individual prob-
lems of leadership on campus, but also to the overall com-
munity “problems" of Gl-innell. Let’s hope that at least a

within the student. If that atti-
tude is lacking, then most 0!
Grinnell‘s highest values (in-
cluding the interim) are prob
ably wasted,

The further issue (implicit in
the editorial) is how can the
student acquire individual focus
and a desire for a liberal edu-
cation? I have no answer. I
said, however, that if a sludellt
desires to be liberally educated.
then the interim is valuable.
It is invalid to undercut the
worth of the interim by porno
ing out that some students are
not individually focused. The
solution to a lack of this kind of
attitude lies on a deeper level
than changing or scrapping the
interim.

Students Suggest
Leaders, Citizens
Respond By Doing

To the Editor:

The AWS Board and thl
CofHP were this week asked to
Sign a pledge stating that they
would, from now on, enforce
the open dorms policy. when
this statement was passed out,
it was asked how it could be re-
written so it would “ring bet-
ter" with the administration. It
was also made clear that the
signature of the president on
this document does not in any "
way obligate him to consider
enforcement of any other rules.
Maybe the time to stuff ‘ln‘
boxes is over and the time to
act is overdue. The concepts
of citizen and leaders have
gone from our community and
need to be revived.

The enforced policy of the
Grinnell community is L0 let
anything occur so long as it
does not visibly and directly in-
jure another persons. The con-
cepts of Grinnell College, acar
demic community, and society
do not enter our minds any
more. Let us try to be citizens
in the largest sense, ie. pre-
serve ond protect the ideals.
which include the rules, of the
community.

“As a starter it is suggested
that all known violators be re-
ported and dealt with in the
institutionalized manner. Fur~
that, it is suggested that the
members of the community
carry out their responsibility '
m that community. Responsi-
bility is something you do.

Sneak Preview by Donulloe on Unusual
Play to Be Given Here Feb. 22-23

Paul Claudel spent twenty
year on “Tidings Brought to
Mary” and revised it seven
times The preparations of the
Grinnell Players tor the pre.
sentatlon of this play have been
almost as elaborate, if not so
lengthyr

Cast before Christmas vaca»
tion, the play has been in re-
hearsal six weeks under the di-
rection of Nod Donahoe (dra-
mal). Sets have been designed
by guest technical adviser Wil~
liam Sherman of Bennington
College“ Sherman has also su-
pervised lighting and costumes.
The music for this presentation
of “Tidings Brought to Mary"
is the product of James Yan»
natos (music).

The story concerns Violaine
Vercours who contracts leprosy

apron and told him to chop on her
head and send In io market.

Meanwhile. tho hired hand had ra-
suniod his roareh for on improved
formula.

According to Mr, Patter-sum
the subject matter of this let-
ter concerns the Junior Li <

and interpretation is left open
to the individual student.

the play, which occurs after the
death of Violaine, explores the

Donehoe admonished, “What
happens is not what the play
is about. in a sense ityis an

“The‘play can easily slip into
a pageant; but if it does, we
will have failed, This play more
than anything must be about
real people who have hands
and feel, and entrails."

The play was chosen in part
because of its relevance to the
times. Donahoe said, “Anyone
may become a martyr when
times get rougherr”

Performances will be given
February 22 and 23 in Roberts

Helping

Students Discover Future

*

Is Objective of Placement Ofﬁce

By Karen Adkinson

“We’re in the business of sell-
lng opportunities." said Zeke
Bequeira, director of Grinnell’s
Placement Office.

The Placement Office is de-
signed to aid students in mak~
lug vocational plans. It was set
up as a separate office just
over a year ago with Sequeira
as director.

One of Sequeira’s innovations
has been the Placement Office
bulletin distributed every week.
It contains summer employ-
ment information, dates of tests
and visits of industrial recruit-
ers, and graduate fellowship
news.

He said, “We had no idea
this would flourish as it has.
We published a special bulletin
about the Peace Corps senior
program which was distributed
only to juniors and within an
hour after its distribution we
had other students calling and
coming in to ask for copies of
their own."

The Placement Office, ac-
cording to Sequeira, acts as a
counselor, adviser, and “brolc
en" It brings together recruit-
ers ahd job seekers, but more
than that it “seeks to find
means by which students can

translate their educational ex-
perlences into productive and

”Most students seem to ig-
nore vocational planning dur-
ing their underclass years, and
by their senior year it is some-
times too late. How many stu-
dents, for example, choose a
major with a thoroughly inves-
tigated vocation in mind, or
perhaps more important, how
often do they select their work
in supporting disciplines with
a direction in View? Often the
related course work can do
much to enhance a person’s lap

He continued, “This is like
buying the most beautiful Cad-

ting it sit because you won’t
spend anything on gasoline,

Arene Theatre Renewal is Complete

The modern atmosphere of
the recently remodeled arena
theatre located on the ground
floor-of ARH' will provide the
background for many future
lectures and seminars, accord-
ing to Evan H. Walden, direct-
or of the physical plant.

The new lecture room,
opened to classes on Feb. 10.
had served as a theatre arena
workshop before the construe
tion of the Fine Arts Center.
Because of the need for more
classrooms, it was decided to
put the workshop area to better
Ila.

The remodeling. in the plan-

ning stage for two and a half
years, actually began just be-
fore Christmas vacation of last
semester. Although the project
is technically finished, drapes
and permanent chairs will be
added along with a large table
for seminar discussions.

For the present the seminar
and lecture room has been
fully scheduled for classes
varying from humanities to
speech correction. Next year,
however, the use of the “old
arena” will be limited to groups
more appropriate to that type
of classroom, such as large
English and history seminars.

 

 

government, through not only
the individual personnel de-
partments but also the Depart-
ment of Labor and Civil Serv-
ice Commission, is another
source. Individual research or-
ganizations also offer a good
deal of data as do professional
and vocational associations like
the American Medical Associa-
tion.

“What to do about summer
employment is a dilemma for
us. There are two main reasons
for summer jobs; experience
and money to continue an edu-
cation. Most of the time the
two don’t coincide. It’s difficult
for us to decide which to ex-
plore, in which area to expend
the mast effort. If students
have leads or especially if they
have run up a blind alley, we
would like to know in order to
share it _with others to help
make their time and energy
spent summer job hunting pro—
ductive with a minimum of ef-
fort.”

Monroe Beardsley Evali‘iaies
Relation Movements In lirtler

By Cynthia Erust

Normative problems, “the re-
lations or order to value," were
discussed Tuesday evening by
Dr. Monroe Beardsley, His
speech, “Order and Disorder
in Art," was the eleventh of the
"Order Seminar” Series

Dr. Beardsley stressed that
order itself is not necessarily
a valuerconcept, but “. . . in
some fields, order is taken to
be a ground of goodness;
Something desirable for itself,
. . ." He cited such ancient
thinkers as Plato, Plotinus, and
St. Augustine as early perceiv—
ers of this connection in the
field of aesthetics. .

Their conception was based
on two essential principles;
“what makes a work of art
good is its beauty,” and “what
distinguishes beautiful things.
. . . is a high degree of some
kind of order.” This forms a
tradition which “. s the old-
est aesthetic tr tion in the
West." This aesthetic theory in-
cluded organization, unity, and
proportion in its definition of
order.

The major part of Dr.
Beardsley's lecture was spent
evaluating two modern move-
ments which he feels “. . . have
raised this old problem again
in an. especially challenging
way. . . .” These movements
are “. . . the increasing use of
chance, or accident, in the cre-
ation of art,” and the informa-
tion Theory of esthetics.

“Tychistic art” is the term
of Dr. Beardsley uses to de-
scribe “art produced by acci-
dent. . .” Although new meth-
ods of “composing” were in-
cluded, the discussion was lim-
ited mainly to Lhe field of
“painn'ng,” as this is the area
where tychistic art is most
common and. most easily
assessed. According to Dr.
Beardsley, “The courting of
accident has been present to
some degree in all abstract
art.” He sees the current in-
terest in “junk art" to be a nat-
ural outgrowth of this fascina—
tion, for “nothing is left to the
vagaries of fate more utterly

 

than what man casts away. . ."

Moving to contemporary mu-
sic, Dr. Beardsley described
and analyzed the Information
Theory. This he called “The
most significant attempt to
provide a precise description of
order in art. . .” This theory is
a mathematical one, based on
a series of signals and the “in-
formation” they give, which
depends upon the unpredictabil-
ity of each signal. A random
arrangement would give more
information than one following
a pattern, which would be “re-
dundant” or predictable

This theory is applied most
easily to melody. Hypotheses
can be formulated that “. . .
there is some fundamental con-
nection between musical coher-
ence and information—value,"
There appears to be a “. . .
positive correlation between
musical value and redundancy.
or order. . . The best melodies
lie somewhere . . . between
complete ’randomness and a
very tight control.”

When we judge a work of art
to be good," Beardsley contin<
ued, “it is relevant to support
this judgment by pointing out
that the work is highly unified.
Again, , . .

He concluded with the obser-
vatiOn that “. . . Intensity of
quality and perfection of form
are both involved. . . each is
an aim of art. . ‘. . The artist,
no doubt is one who rearranges
the world, and makes us some-

Mrs. Fernandez, Refugee from Cuba's Communist Regime
Arrives at Grinnell to Work as Cook for Food Service

By Susan Taylor

A charming young mother
has found her way from Cas<
tro’s Cuba to Grinnell’s Saga
Food Service since September,
1962. She is Mrsl Marie Fernan-

dez, who, with her husband and-

child, left a good home and a
law practice in Cuba to escape
the Communist government of
the island.

Mrs. Fernandez is a cook for
Saga at the Quadrangle kitch-
en. She said that they are very
happy to be in the United States
and in Grinnell, even though it
means that she must work now.
She expressed her gratitude for
the opportunity to be in the
United States and to raise her
children here

Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez
spent their first year in the
United States in‘ Miami where
their second child was born six
months ago “We miss very
much Cuba," Mrs. Fernandez
said, using the word order of
her native Spanish, "but we
have our children here, and we
are grateful to the government
and the people of the United
States to be here,”

Mrs. Fernandez explained
that the family had made plans
to settle in Indiana, but they
decided to come to Grinnell be-
cause of the urging of Mr. Fer-
nandez’s life-long friend, Vin-
cent Range], who teaches Span-
ish at Grinnell High School.

Fernandez and Rangel grew
up together and both became
attorneys in Camaguey, Cuba.
The Rangeis were brought to
Grinnell through the efforts of
the school system and the Jay-

forcing all laws equally. Inter-

national problems could be

~ UN charter.

Certainly it is about time that

a reasoned and intelligent sug-
“»gestion to the solving of our
enforcement problems such as
the pledging program be pro-
pogiI It has been obyious for

 

settes (wives of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce mem-
bers). The Rangels were so
pleased with the community
that they urged the Fernandez
family to come here.

Mrs. Fernandez vividly re-
calls the day the family came
to Grinnell. It was the day of
President Kennedy’s assassina-
tion, November 22, 1963, The
young refugee reports having
learned of the national tragedy
in Chicago, en route to Iowa.

Mrs. Fernandez explained
the one and one-half year pmr
cess she and her husband went
through in preparation for im-
migration to the United States.
They left shortly before the
October crisis in 1962, when
there were still two flights a
day from Havana to Miami.
They were allowed to bring
only one set of clothing along
with the clothes they were
wearing All of their property
had to be turned over to Cas-
tro’s government before they
left the country, ‘

Upon their arrival in the
United States, the family’s first
concern was to find milk for
their year-old son. The Cuban
officials had confiscated a
quart of milk which she had
taken to the airport for her
child.

Mrs. Fernandez left her par-
ents and her sister and family
behind in Cuba. They had origi-
nally planned to come to the
United States, but the means
of transportation was cut off
before they were able to leave.

Cuba was once a country of
middle class people, according
to Mrs. Fernandez, and the

quite some time that a group
of college students with above
average intelligence such as we
have at Grinnell cannot be ex-
pected to take seriously the
rules printed in the student
handbook of rules. It is an in-
sult to the intelligence, and
more importantly, the individ-
uality of the Grinnell student to
expect him to abide by and
enforce these rules.

if more approaches like the
institution of pledges can be of-
fered as solutions to the prob-
lems of society, the day will
come when We will no longer
have to worry about society.

Communism. The young chil-‘
dren, who started in the com-
munist schools five years ago,
are taught to believe in Com-
munism and to support Castro.
But the older people do not
support him.

"But the Cuban people can’t
do anything,” she continued.
“They are very poor, and have
no weapons or supplies. The
Children must go to Commun-
ist schools.” She explained that
her niece cannot get food or
clothing unless she attends the
Communist school,

“It is useless for us to send‘
food or other things to our rela-
tives still in Cuba because the
government takes it, or at least
half of it. Why should we make
the sacrifice for the Castro gov-
ernmen " she questioned.

(agers Fall to Rams; to Host Carleton, St. Olaf

By Andy Bushnell

Cornell gained undisputed
possession of second place in the
Midwest Conference last Sat-
urday by handing Grinnell its
third defeat of the season, 82‘
65. The loss dropped Grinnell
three full games behind league
leading Ripon which now has
won ten of its eleven confer—
ence games,

Grinnell started off fast tak-
ing a 10~Z lead in the first two
minutes, The Rams closed the
gap to 13-10 and remained on
the Pioneer’s heels most of the
first half. With less than three
minutes remaining in the first
half Cornell tied the game at
33x33 and then Went ahead 37-
3.1.

Both Jim Mifflin and John
Sundell got into foul trouble
early in the game, and it was
left Frantz’s shooting that kept
the Pioneers close behind. Grin-
nell controlled the boards for
as long as Sundell was in the
game.

Grinnell threatened to re-
take the lead early in the sec-
ond half coming within a
point at 47-46. but the Rams
again put on the pressure
and moved out ahead, Sun-
dell, Mifflin, and Clyde Smith
all fouled out late in the
game and Cornell widened
the lead and won going away.

Dal Zierk and Jack Grams
hit for 20 points apiece to pace
tile Rams. John Shillinglaw,
Dick Calbow, and John All-
[laugh added 16.14. and 10
points respectively.

Frantz paced Grinnell with 28
points and Sundell and Mifllin
added eleven apiece. Sundell
also pulled down 19 rebounds.

By Pete Kollrnan

Grinnell’s varsity basketball
team will try to get back into
the win column this weekend
as they host Carleton and St.
Olaf in Darby Gym.

The Carls, Grinnell’s oppo-
nents tonight, are in the lower
third of the Midwest Confer-
ence standings, but are defin»
itely on the upswing, as shown
by their 9542 trouncirlg of C08
College Kohawks last Weekend.

In their trip to Northfield,
the Pioneers beat the Earls,
96-82, in a game which Coach
Pfitsch termed as “the bést
game we have played this
year." At that time, how-
ever, Grinnell was led by the
performance of Gordon Kine
kead, who has since left
school.

The Carleton team is led by
an all—conference guard Jack
Arado, whose lack of height,
5.9, is otiset by his quickness
and excellent shooting eye, and
Center Mike Tierney, a junior
who was 6th man on last year’s
squad, Few fans who were at
last year’s game between these
teams at Grinnell will forget it.
With third place in the Confer-
ence at stake, the Carls edged
out the Pioneers in a double-
overtime thriller.

St. Olaf, who at the beginning
of the season was expected to
be the weaker of the Northfield
teams, was quite a thorn in the

' side of Cornell and Grinnell

when'the two Iowa teams made
their trip north earlier in the
year.

Both games are key ones for
the Pioneers, whose champion-
ship hopes remain dimly flick-
ering.

Against Iowa. Purdue

Grinnell's indoor track team
opens its 1964 season tomorrow
against the University at Iowa,
the Big Ten’s defending cham—
pions, and Purdue in a trian-
gular meet at Iowa City,

“We’re probably stepping
in a little over our heads,"
says Dick Young, coach of

Grinnell’s defending Midwest

Conference titlistsr “But'thii

one will be a great experi-

ence for the boys andrshould
help us in the long run.”

Lack of conditioning is
Young's biggest concern noW.
The Pioneer thinclads have
been working out only since
Feb. 1 and have no real indoor
track facilities.

Pacing the Grinnell efforts
will be a handful of juniors who
led the Grinnellians to the top
last year. Seeing plenty of ex-
tra duty will be Bruce Beck<
lord, Rod Brown, Paul Patten
Son. Mack erlholtz, Mike De-
Witt, John TePaske. Ron Scha—
chel and Jeri Langham.

BrOWn and Patterson are the
top distance men, While Wln<
holtz, Beckord, TePaske, Scha<
chel, and Langham specialize in
the sprints and middle distance
events. DeWitt is mainly a
sprinter and hurdler.

in the field, TePaske will be
teaming with Vince Anku and
John Kelsey, in the broad jump.
Jim Miller, a promising sopho-
more and Joel Goldman will
throw the shot, with Walt Neal
going in the pole vault. Tom

and Purdue University at Iowa City.

John Sundell, Grinnell’s

fourth in the nation in rebounding in the college division.
Sundell has been pulling down an average of 21 rebounds

LBurma and Wall Discuss Rights Bill

The main features and the
political problems of the Civil
Rights package' bill which was
passed by the House of Repre-
sentatives Monday were out
lined and discussed in a coffee

hour Tuesday afternoon in
Xounker L o u n g e. Featured
speakers about the bill were
Dr. John l-L Burma (Sociology)
and Dr. Joseph F. wall (His-
tory).

Burma started the discussion
with a factual report on the bill
as passed by the House, He
listed the major areas covered
by the bill and their provisionsi

l) DESEGREGATION OF
SCHOOLS: The bill proposes a
fact finding committee to de-
termine the actual situation,
the possibility of the federal
government ﬁling suit in cases
where individuals are not finan-
cially able to do so, and federal
funds being granted to inte<
grated schools from which
state governments have with-
drawn funds on the basis of
their integration.

2) VOTING RIGHTS: The bill
proposes a bar on discrimina-
tion in registration and voting
in federal elections, specifically
in the tests given as a prere-
quisite for registration and lit-

eracy tests; it also makes a
provision for three judges in
cases brought to the courts
This would prevent local prej-
udices of one judge and tend to
move the case faster. ‘

3) PUBLIC ACCOMMODA-
TIONS: The bill would prohibit
discrimination in those accom-
modations tied to interstate
transportation—hotels, motels,
restaurants, and probably fill-
ing stations, theaters, and re-
tail stores,

4) PUBLIC FACILITIES:
(facilities maintained by a gov-
ernment unit) The bill would
permit the attorney general to
intervene and take the financial
burden in court action,

5) FEDERAL AGENCIES:
The bill. would permit the use
of agency funds, with presi-
dential approval, for attempts
to end discrimination.

6) EMPLOYMENT: The bill
would in essence establish a
federal fair employment prac-
tices commission. lt,would also
outlaw employment discrimina-
ation because of “race, religion,
national origin, or sex," thus es-
tablishing a legislative base for
equal opportunities for women.

Burma further explained that
the bill would establish a com-
munity relations agency, a fact

 

finding and technical assist-
ance service. It would also ex-
tend the Civil Rights Commis-
sion for another four years.

Dr. Wall, in discussing the
problems the bill faces in the
Senate, said, “I'm not nearly
so pessimistic about the bill's
chances as I was a few weeks
ago. Even so, it’s going to be
very tough, and I don’t want to
paint an overly optimistic pic-
ture."

“There are two factors work-
ing for us in forcing a favor-
able Senate vote," Wall said:

1) “The ironic and tragic
death of President Kennedy has
undoubtedly contributed to the
success of the measure" by
changing the political align-
ment of some Republicans with
the liberal Democrats.

2! The Conservatives made a
tactical error in invoking clo-
ture in the liberal filibuster last
year on the American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company
satellite bill. Wall explained
that pressure to vote [or clo-
ture can be brought on those
conservative senators who
voted for it at that time,

He said that there is “no
question at all that President
Johnson will be happy to sign

A Gospel group, the Staples Singers, left, will give a concert
tomoriow in Darby gymnasium at 3:30 pm.

This family from Chicago began singing at home for fun.
Roebuck Staples, father of the group, accompanied them on the
guitar. Soon they were performing at local churches. In the 1950‘s
they organized professionally and toured the continent, singing at
churches, concert halls, colleges, and music festivals.

Two years ago the Staples Singers were selected ”New Star"
vocal group in Down Beat magazine‘s International Jazz Critics
Poll, the first time a Gospel group has received this award.

The group has not tried to discard the old spiritual and hymn
singing styles in an attempt to give their singing a more modern
sound, as have a number of others in Gospel music. Instead, the
Staples have chosen to ignore present trends, relying on the per-
manent appeal of traditional Negro folk music — songs of life,
hardship and happiness, songs of the common man and his faith
in himself, his people and his God.
