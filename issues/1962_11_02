Maturity. not
puni+ive rule

To the Editor:

What is maturity? On :1 Cole
lege campus. there are two as
pects of maturity; academic and
soeialrinterpersonal. There is lit
lle question about the degree of
academic and intellectual proﬁ-
ciency. responsibility, and free-
donl which has been achieved
here. This state or anal . while
heartening in itself. provides
one side or a rather drastic con
trast at Grinnell. We reter to
the unduly restrictive social rage
ulallons placed upon the female
students.

An individual cannot attain
personal standards or behavior-
and a personal ethic when her
actions are controlled by an
nrbitrllrlly designed punitive
system. The process or “gl'OWr
ing up" and becoming mature
necessarily in ‘olvcs the ability
to make decisions for oneself.
This ability u I not be actual»
ized i the girls are denied
the right to Ilse their own
judgment. A college girl. ii
she is considered mature.
should be trusted on all levels
or behavior. It is hoped that
her powers oi judgment are
developing They should not be

'lllled hy unnecessary regu-
ll ion, but rather should lie
:illoucd to grow in an atmose
phere of freedom and personal
integrity.

An atmosphere or more per-
sonal responsibility and self-
cohtrol is a goal to be sought
Before coming to Grinnell. the
student should have reached.
through parental and institution-
al training. a degree of nlaltllity
sunicient to prepare her lo start
making lievown decisions. In the
light of the school's demands
upon the individual academic
responsibility ol the student. how
can it deny to this some st
dent personal social l'esponsibi
ity? Do they not go hand in
hand? Relaxation of authoritar»
ion control is :1 means to great-
er maturity and self-control,

Why should the Grinv

nell College has reached the
evolutionary stage where the
development ol a knowledgeable.
tully mature. sell-slinieienl pe -
son should become the eve ll
gool or the college experience.
Th diﬁicull under
present conditions.

THE PARENTS who wrote up-
pos the proposed abolition of
womens hours base their pro-
tests on the "moral laxtty" and

“free love" likely to ensue if
such action were carried out. it
is our contention that these
well-meaning parents are incr l-
inating themselves by implying
that they have not brought up
their children to be able to cope
With the responsibility of sell-
discipline

In conclusion. a general et-
inosphcre of freedom on our
campus is to be desired. Cer-
tainly. we would grow. become
more mature and healthy, and
our college experience would
be more complete The contrast
between soeinl restrictivene
and academic freedom would di-
ininish and Grinnell could be
come the school to which it

Cowleslioos deny ‘
freedom of speech

To the Editor:

Several evenings ago when the
headwaiter at Cowles started to
read an announcement about an
emergency meeting ot the Grin»
nell Student Peace Group. he
was drowned out by a large
amount of hissing and booing.

BECAUSE of this hissing and
booing. i doubt that anybody in
the dining room was able to un-
dcrsland the announcement.

Although 1 am not a mem—
ber of the Grinnell sru, the
type or behavior exhibited by
the men oi Grinnell College in
(ll-owning out this announce-
ment disturbs me greatly.

To me this type of behavior
brings pictures into my mind of
the kind oi tactics used by ene-
mies oi democracy and free
speech everywhere when they
shout down people opposed to
them so that these people can—
not be heard.

the lounges and ioggia all night,
and vice versa," as one parent
envisions, is not necessarily true.
First, certainly the loggia could
be locked as it is now at 10:30
or 12 pm. and the women could
leave and enter through Main
door, signing in and out to in-
dicate their whereabouts to the
college.

AND THE RULES presently
in ettect about men's presence
in the women's dorms and vrcc
versa could continue to be strict—
ly enforced, There would be no
reason to continue a coniplcicly’
tree atmosphere simply because
women were allowed to remain
out beyond midnight

When objection to tree hours
is based on a moral objection
to "free love" most or us want
to ansiver with the question
posed by another parent:
“What is tiiere to do artcr
midnight, anyway, that cannot
be done bcrore?"

The same parent states that
"Rules cxrst in our home, as i
am sure they do in any home
where the parents care about
their children They should not
suddenly cease.” Many or us
agree wholeheartedly w h this
view. One solution. then. is to
allow only juniors and seniors.
or Just seniors, the privilege and
responsibility of regulating their
own hours

until alter iiours. These are l
two examples of situationsl
leading to understandable rep 1

We suggest, as one parent
proposed, that a poll oi the slur

Tension seen as essence of‘ ‘Heclcla'i

of the play can be attributed
alone neither to richness ot’ tha—

The play is stretched upon a
tramework of emotional, ideal.
ogical and aesthetic polar op-

beyond the diaphonous, mun.

stance of the play in order to

its essence.

General Gabler. She is mascu-

proach.

As there is no challenge ior
her in her husband, this drive
iinds its object in Ellcrt Low
horg and destroys him. The
will to dominate in nedda is
iriistratcd by both social and
psychological strictures: as a
descent in economic means,
and hatred oi assuming the
responsibility implicit in con-

In answer to a demand by

DESCENT

By Tom Phillips

makes

I hardly know anything about
dances, but i saw 'btllll periorm—
nccs given by the Canadian
‘National Ballet Tuesday, and i
would like to say some things
about what they did

OUT or ElCliT ballets they

periormcd, two were clioreo
graphed by George Balanchine
and three by Antony Tudor, both
oi whom i understand to be im—
portant riguies in the contem—
porary dance world. Their dances
.were distinctly dinci-ent, and l
happened to like the ones by
Balanchine much better than the
,ones by Tudor.
,i The three Tudor dances 7
“‘Judgment of Paris," "Lilac Gare
,den" and “Offenbach in the Un-
derworld”~all involved dancers
laying the parts of people. re-
‘ectcd lovers, iamous operetta
;ial's, drunken playboys and
:such. Now i can’t say that it's
bad for a ballet to have a story,
‘because “Swan Lake” has a
‘story and it‘s a good ballet, but
the trouble with these was that
they were lousy stories.

In “Lilac Garden." Tudor
takes the worn—out theme of
the dnublc triangle and adds
absolutely nothing to it. The
wrong lovers get paired off,
they dance around tor a while
throwing ﬂowers at each other
while their hearts break, and
then everybody walks off ex-
cept one or the starrcrossed
young men, who hangs his
head down and iaccs rear as
the curtain falls.
ln “Judgment oi Paris," the
myth is set in a barroom with
June, Minerva and Venus as
three slutty ladies. Paris chooses
lVenus because he is drunk Now
I'm sure this is a parody oi some
kind, but rm airaid i just don’t
get it, because it seems to me
that all Mr. Tudor has done is
to take all the signiﬁcance out
oi the myth and replace it with
a tow slightly cheap laughs.

l BUT THE Balanchine dances
ywel'cn't like that at all. There
twel‘e no stories and no real
lcharacters, so that the ballets
lalways looked like ballets, and
lnever like skits. in “Concerto
lilaroeco," the opcning work oi
lthc matinee, the two lead bal—
llerlnas weren’t princesses or oi-
‘phzm girls or anything, and all
{they did was dance a wonder-
iull-y vigorous counterpoint to
the violin parts. _

And “Serenade" was the best
t dance in the evening pcriorm—
: ance because it was the only
; one in which people could
dance together just because it
was right that way, and not
1 because they were supposed to
be Boyiricnd and Girlfriend.

l Well, I may be coniusing you.
‘All I really want to say is that
lthe meanings of Tudor's ballets
,might just as well have been
iexpi-cssed in words, but Balan—
chlnc's meanings were much too
jclear to be expressed in words.
And while we’re on the subicct,
:I’d like to say that i thought
,Gulina Saintsova was a wonder-
‘lul ballerina because she ﬂew
;like a bird and spun around so
jiast you couldn't see her,. and
‘ncver once did she wobble or
‘lcan ovcr too tar.

1Dr Amstutz presents an optimistic
1view for‘ toxic literature' readers

By Nick Murray

In a lecture delivered last
1Friday entitled “Sickness, Evil
1and Theology in Sat ~e, Camus
1and Katha," Dr. Jakob Ainstutz
or the University of Bern, Swims
zcriand, spoke of sin-called “toxic
llitel‘ature” and contrasted the
ietrects produced by it with the
intentions of three of its best
,kiiown authors: Jean-Paul Sar—
‘trc, Albert Camus, and Franz
.Kaﬂta.

Amstutz stated that by “sicle
iness” he meant a sickness oi the
1“ ill, in which men either lacked
1any development of will or had
channeled it into the service or
perverse ends- and that by “evil”
he meant the "external compul—
sion" ol will.

HE WENT 0N to deﬁne three
sicknesses produced in society
-by the misunderstanding of this
11itcrature: ( ) “snobbisln,” an
‘attitude taken by those who ac-
cept the apparently pessimistic

:message of “toxic literature” and

travel in it as fashionable, agl’eev
ing that. there is nothing to be
done, and taking sophisticated
pride in their knowledge;

(2) “deleatism.” a feeling or
hopelessness engendered in the

1gcneral’public by its acceptance
1of these books at tace value; and

(3) a “theological malady” colic

1sisting of an Eflol‘t on the part;
‘of some churchmen to take ad-

vantage of the effects produced

Grinncll's football coach, Edd

Pioneers had defeated Carleton
13-9, “You win some lucky
Ones."

That may he the understate
nicnt oi the year. Bowcr's
league leading gridders re—
mained undeieated last week
thanks to Grinnell’s good do-
tense and a Carleton end drop— .
ping two sure touchdown
passes with no one near him.

Carleton scored its first and
only touchdown of the game in
the first quarter, as the Carl:
moved 60 yards iii 12 plays, In‘
the series Dave Larson, the
Carls’ quarterback, led the
march with his roll—out running
and passing A Larson pass
thrown to Steve Duermeyer ac
counted tor the TD.

Gar Hoersehgen kicked the
extra point, and the Carls were
on to a 770 icad,

GRINNELL CAME BACK late
in the first quarter and with
Carlton Peterson carrying the
brunt oi the attack, the Pit)-
neers moved 56 yards in seven
plays to score, Carlton Peterson
scored the touchdown, sweeping
his own ioit end lor seven yards.

The Pioneers iakcd a kick tor
the conversion and went for two
points, but. an Art Peterson to

Carleton added two more‘

'polnts to its 7.6 lead on a saiety,

when Art Peterson was tackled
in the Gi-inneu end zone aiter

center.

In the second hiill Grin-roll I
