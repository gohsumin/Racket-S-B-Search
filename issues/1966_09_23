Court Rules Guilty
3 Get Conduct Pro

By HENRY WILHELM

In the first court case of the
year, two girls and one boy
were sentenced to one semester
of conduct probation for a “visi-
tation violation" by a joint ses—
sion of the Men’s and Women's
Primary courts. The boy was
caught “about haltway through
the window” of Haines Hall late
last Friday evening by the
w a t c h m a 11. He voluntarily
turned himself in to CofHP
President Bob Foote the next
morning. The girls involved
turned themselves in to AWS
Board President Karen Lauter-
bach.

The defendants pleaded guilty
to the charges against them
but asked that the penalty be
limited to conduct probation.
Karen Lauterbach had originab
1y suggested to the court that
in addition to conduct proba-
tion open dorm privileges for
the defendants should be sus-
pended ror a semester, but this
was dropped after deliberation.
The boy told the court that he
thought conduct probation would
be sufficient to deter him from
doing such a thing again. He
noted that the stated function
of the court is to be “preventa-
tive rather than punitive." its
added that in this case restrict-
ing open dorms would be “kind
of silly."

Lauterbach told the court that
this case was “just a matter or
illegal entry” and that there
were no extenuating circum-
stances. Karen told the session,
which was attended by Dean of
Men, Eugene Thompson, and
Dean of Women, Alice Low,
that the defendants “showed a
remarkable lack or judgment
and responsibility" in their ac-
tions. None of the defendants

and journalists from all over
the country The weekend is an
attempt to bring the different
groups of people comprising
the college together with the
aims of focusing attention on

The idea of a “Grinnell

Knopf's report dealt iirst with
recent faculty committee re~

an ad hoc faculty committee re-
ported that “much is wrong
with the senior comprehensive
examination, with the major
program as preparation for it
and with the senior year in gen-

studies have been launched in
recent years, but except for the
study of Speciflc questions about

Encampment Topics Broadened

The Encampment planning
committee has changed ihe ore
ganization of the small group
discussion sessions from the
six - topic division reported in
last week’s issue of the 5&3 to
a more general consideration at
three areas each to be dis-
cussed by all groups. Chairman
Kathy Jagow explains that this
is “in keeping with the more
general nature of this year's
Encampment . . . to get a more
comprehensive, overall view or
of Grinnell."

The annual leadership retreat
will be held at a camp near
Boone Sept. 30 through Oct. 2.
Leading oil the weekend of ses-
sions will be a studenttacuity
panel discussion on “The aims
and goals of a liberal arts

Questions Editorial

To The Editor:

1 was much struck by the edi»
torlal in the last issue, in which
is repeated several times the
notion that rules should rellect
reality.

The notion strikes me as both
dangerous and fallacious. It
human conduct were simply
and merely natural, like natural
laws, then rules, i.e.. scientiﬁc
laws, would be no more than re-
flections of reality, But if hu-
man conduct is a matter of
choice, of free will, then your
editorial’s thesis will be that
laws ought to correspond to
whatever human beings choose
to do. If the majority should
choose to be cruel, intolerant,
vicious, then the laws should,
by reflecting these, sanction
ouch attitudes and their conse-
quent acts.

Man’s nature is, it seems to
me, unlike nature’s nature; and
no man’s rules precede the re~
silty of his conduct. Otherwise
there would be no use in having
rules and laws.

John Crosset,

Classical Language

Blind Commitment?
To The Editor:

The Des Moines Project
raises larger, m are urgent
questions — probing questions
about ourselves and our roles
as college students and mem-
bers of society. The questions
which we raised last week
should have, we think, been
asked and answered before
Grinnell College students be«
came involved with the sock»

economic problems of Des

Moines,

Few advocate poverty. In
this country, it is simply un-
American and anti-Great Soc-
iety to brandish pro - poverty
sentiments; more importantly,
though, we recognize that the
poverty of a few is the poverty
of all. Yet each of us must
ultimately discover and define
our motives: are we joining
blindly because involvement
and commitment are now so-
cially acceptable and the 'in'
thing? Or do we commit our-
selves oiit of basically humani-
tarian and egalitarian motives?
How do we commit ourselves.

Whether to is better to be
blindly committed or uncom-
mitted is a moot question; the
issue we face is how can we
pragmaticaliy involve our-
selves in social action without
being duped and mislead? The
desire of Grinnell College stu-
dents to become involved in
social reform is not an issue.
Nor is the issue the existence
of need in this area; both are
real and do exist. Perhaps the
participants would object to
our terminology of ‘blind com-
mitment. yet, each one of us
is blindly committed to some
aspect of life without really
knowing why ~— nor do most of
us take the time to discover
why because youthful enthusi-
asm will suffice. Before we
commit ourselves, whether to
civtl relorm or to graduate
school, wouldn’t the possibili-
ties of failure be somewhat re-
duced if we assembled as much
concrete. speciiic, factual
information as possible before
embarking upon any worth
while project? The Des Moines
Project, for example, perhaps
would still exist if judicious-

Invalid Generalizations

As a young fish 1 used to wonder what going
to a liberal arts school would be like, so i decided

to go to Grinnell College.

I adjusted my scales, swam into the opaque
bowl where the school was located, and was sur-
prised tb see all of the students attached to the
sides of the bowl by tape over their fins. As soon
as I was discovered, I, too, was taped down. It
was really terrible, because I couldn’t see out
and whenever I looked in, all I saw were stnlg<
gling fish and changeless patterns of activity in

the center of the bowl.

Looking a little closer, even though I was
bound by the tape. I saw several older fish talking
heatedly about something I couldn’t understand.
They never quit talking, and oddly enough, never
moved, never changed their position, and, as far
as I could tell, had probably always been that
way. As long as I was there, I never did know
who they were, or what they were doing.

I stayed at Grinnell for my whole college
career, and teamed two things:
freedom can never be used in an unqualified
sense, and an institution is by nature an unchang-
lng thing. The only thing that l was allowed to
learn for myself was that fishbowls are unchang<

ing,

isolation is one of those
mixed blessings that was be-
stowed on this college by a
handful of visionary Congrega-
tional ministers and that minor
robber baron, J. B. Grinnell.

The lowa frontier may have
been exerting in the midrlssﬂ's:
but a century later, Grinnell

seems distant from the events.

and experiences which deeply
involve other youths of our so-
ciety. Geography may thus be
a factor limiting the involve-
ment of Grinnell students in the
civil rights demonstrations in
the South, the poverty pro—
grams of Appalachia, and the
Viet Nam policy organizations
centered in universities east of
the Mississippi and west of the
Rockies.

But geography is too simple
an explanation for the distance
between Grinnell students and
the activities of their content»
poraries, One senses that the
real cause of the non . involve-
ment of the average Grinnel-
lian in the rebellion against the
American Establishment is his
failure, on the intellectual lev-
21, to develop a critical attitude
toward the society that pro-
duced and conditioned him.

When I finally was untaped and awarded the
piece of tape for my Valiant career and per-

severance, I was given a chance to talk to a stu<

dent who didn’t stay at Grinnell but worked
loose from his tape and was washed out of the
bowl because at that. He had a few things to say
about the time he spent there.

He said that he, too, had high hopes when he
went, but that he. like all the others, was imme«
diately lettered by a tape which he called con-
vention, unimaginativeness, and unwillingness to
change. I didn’t. really understand him since I

had never been taught the value of metaphor.

Rumblings

A goal of the liberal educa<
tion, to paraphrase at least one
prolessor, is to develop indi ‘-
duals who understand them-
selves and their world and,
most importantly, who compre-
hend the changes that both the
individual and society are un-
dergoing. By this criterion of
critical awareness, most Grin<
nell students flunk the test of
a liberally educated person.

It Grinneilians understood
themselves and their world,
would they be so lax at relat-
ing their accumulated knowl<
edge to values and purposes?
It this campus were populated
with students who were acquir<
ing a liberal education, would
there be such a failure by
Grinnellians to immerse them
selves in the affairs at our
time?

Poverty in Grinnell, Des
Moines, and the Tama reserva-
tion does not activate this cam<
pus. De facto segregation in
Iowa is not even recognized.
Study groups on the Viet Nam
war, a war that is fast ap-
proaching Korean levels and
that could escalate into a ma-
jor catastrophe - are crushed
under the combined weight of
apathy and humanities papers.

Even problems that are more

He went on to say that he had been close enough
to hear the old fish in the middle talking, and
that the only topic of concern was how to build
the perlect pedestal on which to sit, He said that:
the most common topic of humor was the idea of
experimentation and responsibility for chances
taken if anything were changed. 1 chuckled, since
I knew the joke already.

He went on, and I‘ve g0! to admit that he was
a good speaker, even though he was a sophist.
After a while, I tired of listening to him and de-
cided to go home, sit down and have a good
yawn. The only thing that i wonder is if those
old fish can still see through their rosecoiored

immediate, that are located on
campus, do not inspire the stu<
dents in action. Organizations
are choked by the combined in.
fluences of bureaucracy, petty
personal concerns, and student
indifference A social structure
that restricts students from
forming their own personal
moral values does not raise
cries of objection. The call tor
students to help in welding this
college into an inspired com-
munity goes unhecded.

If Grinnell studens do not:
really understand the present
nature of themselves and their
world, how can they begin to
comprehend how the forces of
today will shape the future?

Perhaps these rumblings will
fall on deaf ears, and students
will continue to enter, in me
chanical manner, the class-
rooms and laboratories. But
hopefully, a few will begin to
understand that the times are
changing, and that indifference
to these changes results in
ignorance and confusion. if a
few understand, this campus
need not accept that world as
it is, but can begin to en-
vision the world as it ought
to be. With an awakened con-
sciousness, the students can
end their worship of fake gods.

 

ness of reason had prevailed
and fundamental questions
been asked and answered.

The Des Moines Project was
an experience which should
serve as a model in defining
motive a n d commitment.
Surely knowledge and under-
standing of a problem is pre-
requiSite to solution. Now, case
in point, did Billy King really
possess the ability to communi-
cate this knowledge to a pre-
dominantly midtlie class group
of college students? Why was-
not a more detailed, in , depth,
study made before the initial
relatively large - scale plunge
taken?

Enthusiasm, commitment. by

all means! But uninformed
involvement when informed in-
voiyement was both possible and
desirable?

D.M. Project Evaluated

To the Edltor:

A final evaluation of the Des
Moines project would be valu-
able both for interested students
and those who might consider a
comparable project in tlie fu-
titre.

i think that most people are
aware of the achievements of
the Des Moines Project. It:
started three block groups, co-

operated with three rent strikes.
and distributed information on
welfare, the poverty program,
city government, etc. through-
out the community in which it
operated. To the Grinnell stu-
dent who has had no experience
with community organizing. I
can suppose that the achieve.
merits seem minimal. But com-
munity organizers only intend
to build the groundwork for
change in a slum. Their work
involves undramatic, person-to-
person encounters; improved
education or better housing con-
ditions don’t come for years.

Real Live People Interviewed

5 By NEIL FISCHER

Generally speaking, the Blues
Project hit the Grinnell campus
last Saturday much like the Des
Moines Project hit it last
year. . . .

The two "projects," of
course, were radically differ-
ent phenomena — the only
thing, in fact, that should
juxtapose them in the popular
mind is the similarity of title.
But the projects do share one
pharacteristic: we heard a lot
from both of them, and we
heard a lot about both of
theln. But we seldom got to
know anything about the
people involved.

Audiences have a nasty habit

Al Kooper is the quiet, wild-
Iooking guy who previously
worked with Bob Dylan, He
plays the organ on all at Dy-
lan’s albums — “just the organ,
nothing but the organ." l-lis
view ol the Blues Project is
poetic:

Leaves of Iowa weather
Decrease towards evening
And here we are —

Crisp tones of twisted airplane

distortion
And San Francisco exhaustion
Have fallen on your ears
And you must decide it you

are pleased.

Danny Kolb is balding, quick
with his hands (on the guitar),
and also rather poetic.

“The Blues Project,” he
avows, “is an avocado in the
walertall or reality. As such.
it is generally regarded.”
Andy Kulberg is the man with

the flute — in fact, he's one of
the few men around with an
electric tlule. Andy attended the
University of Wisconsin lot a
time, but decided that ”neo-
classic folk-rock in the Chicago-
Butterlield tradition" was more
his style than beer blasts at
Madison.

“A direct link between all
different musics" —- that's
what Andy wants the Project
to be, and his style on the
note sure helpsl

Roy Blumfield is the drum-
mer, and drums very well in-
deed Within the basic ar-
rangements or the group, Roy
tries to “expand and change
and eventually form complete
images.” Roy has to move
those slicks pretty fast; he
has to breathe pretty hard.
“Like our music," he says,
“it breathes too."

When you sit down and talk
to the Blues Project, they blend
into a human and warm and
pleasingly s a r c a s t i c and
straithorward whole. Mostly
they're interested in music, and
they seldom are wont to men-
tion their popularity relative to
the popularity oi Christianity
“We Strive to make our sounds
bridge the gap between what is
bad and what is God," affirmed
Danny, “God, of course, being
the Beatles.” Groups of Drdi»
nary, loud melon-rollers are
condemned by the group as
merely "the most sophisticated

form of muzak to reach the
Western world."

“If our projections have
crossed your interest. we are
pleased,” AI Kooper — the
‘poet’ —— concluded, “although

Grinnellians Describe leMoyne life
‘Pride and Prejudice' Plagued

Exchangers' Role

ED. NOTE: The following
story was prepared by the ilve
Grinnell students who partici-
pated in the GrinneIi-LeMoyne
exchange program last semes-
ter. ,

The five participants were
.lanet Poland, Amy Rossman,
Pat Stern, Lynda Thumen and
Rich Lance.

After a summer oi readjust-
ing ourselves to life in the White
Power Structure, the five of us

who attended LeMoyne College
last semester have returned to
our cocoons at Grinllell. To
those of you who noticed our
absence and have been asking,
“How was it?” we would like to
present some of our impres-
sions in a bit more detail than
“Great!” which is true. but
somewhat oversimplified.

LeMoyne is an all-Negro col-
lege in Memphis, Tennessee.
Under the LeMoyne-Grinneli ex-
change program, which began
two years ago, Grinnell sends
four or five students to live and
study at LeMoyne second se»
mester, and LeMoyne sends
about the same number here.

LeMlJyne is situated deep in
the segregated Negro area of
the city, and most oi its stu-
dents consequently have very
little contact with whites. espe-
cially Nortllerners. Since most
White Grinnell students live in
eq ually segregated environ-
ments. the program aims to
promote interracial understand
ing.

identity Crisis

With this rather vague as-
signment in the backs or our
minds, the iive oi us invaded
Memphis on an unusually snowy
day last January. For the next
four months we went through a
sort of collective identity crisis
partly because we really were
uncertain as to our “role" at
~LeMDyne. If someone goes to
Selma to march and to take pies
tures, he knows he is supposed
to march and to take pictures
If a student heads for Mississip-
pi to Crusade for Human Rights,
he has an identity as a crusader.
But our role was simply “stuv
dent." Our sole specialty was

in Memphis

that we were highly visible in
crowds.

We settled down in two some-
what rickety houses near the
campus. Two girls shared one
house with a senior LeMoyne
girl: two of us lived with our
most amazmg “housemother,”
who doubled as a Russian and
French teachers She looked
about seventeen, seemed to
know everyone in Memphis, and
shared our belief that Grinnell
girls are old enough to take
care of themselves. Rich Lance
and another LeMoyne student
lived nearby in the basement at
a large, mysterious house owned
by an old, eccentric widow

The iirst day ended brightly,
even though the water pipes
froze, our boots melted on the
ancient floor furnace grates. all
the doorknohs came off, and the
housemolher’s tomcat, Boris,
came in mangled after a street-
iight.

LeMoyne's neighborhood must
be described as lower economic
level. Across the street from
our house was a Vast Federal
Housing Project and one of
Memphis’ innumerable grave-
yards. The comer (Mississippi
and Walker), nicknamed "Whis-
key Corner” by Grinnell's Ned
Donahoe when he taught at Le-
Moyne, was described in a book
or local history as the toughest
corner in Tennessee in the
lEGO’s.

To the five of us fresh from
white suburbia, the neighbor-
hood was exciting. Perhaps ii
We had lived there all our years
and stood a good chance at
spending the rest of them there,
we would have seen only the
sqltalori

The Deluge

With the beginning of classes
came the deluge of people to
meet and to get to know We
found most of the students very
friendly and as eager to get to
know us as we were to meet
them. Our welcome was warm.
One day a group of girls ap-
proached Amy and asked, “Are
you one oi the Grinnell stu-
dents?"

“Yeah," she said brightly.
“How could you tell?"

After about a week it dawned
on us that we girls were meet-
ing only boys, That seemed sort
or segregated, so we threw a
"hen party" in one oi the
houses. it was a roaring suc~
cess; it was there that we be-
came acquainted with the im-
possible dances we miss so
much now: the Philly Dog, the
Duck, and the Boogaloo.

At that- gathering and at sub-
sequent parties we sensed a
quality that differed from the
[one of Grinnell social life. At
Grinnell, social life implies
something scheduled and self-
conscious. At LeMoyne, social
lite means having a good time.
People dance and drink because
they feel like it. not for any
hidden purpose.

We realize that the social dlf<
ference is not an ‘eithernor‘ situ-
ation where LeMoyne is all right
and Grinnell's all wrong. But
we were impressed with the
students’ refusal to become
wrapped up in self-pityi

Basketball Zeal

The zeal shown at basketball
games is staggering. This is the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial. Grinneil is a rich, iso«
iated, close-knit, secular, resi<
dential college; LeMoyne is less
aliluent and more southern, ur‘
ban, sectarian, and nonresiden-
tial, Most of us at Grinnell are
(let's iace it) middle class, have
been prodded intellectually since
kindergarten, and seldom go
hungry except on Sunday after-
noon, Many of LeMoyne’s stu-
dents have unstable home situ-
ations, have to contend with the
attitudes of families fresh from
Mississippi, and hold down full
time jobs as well while they
go to school (albeit probably at
more than sac an hourl),
Academia
Academically, LeMoyne is not
exactly the Harvard of the Mid-
South. it is tangled up in ad-
ministrative difficulties and
bogged down by teachers who,
thanks to tenure, have been
there since Reconstmction, Yet
LeMoyne does have some very
good departments and some
very good professors. And al-
though most students' high
school backgrounds fall a bit
short at New Trier or Evanston.

Knopf's report suggested a

liberal arts college to larger
universities. General education.
according to Knopf, should “em-

phasize the individual under-

lives in, and the change that
will occur in himself and his
world.”

Knopf does not believe that
Grinnell is now making the most
of its position as a liberal arts

strengthening general education
in the sense of humans rele<
Vance in each of our individual
courses, as well as general edu-
cation in the sense of breadth

Knopf suggested that we
might be getting to the point
“where foreign language can be
treated as we have treated
mathematics, that is with more
stringent admissions stand-
ards.”

“In science,” Knopf recom-
mended, “serious study should
be made of the possibility of a
one-year course for the non-
science major which would pro<
vide knowledge of much that
the layman should know about

All departments, Knopf urged.
should study their courses to
“determine if the development
of the discipline and the rele-
vance of the discipline are giv.
en sufficient attention."

To further insure breadth of
study, Knopf suggested that
“maximum as well as mini-
mum credits be established for
the departmental majorr“

He suggested a program of
major-related study in which
the student has a wide range of
choice of coursesY but for which
each student with his advisor
must provide a satisfactory ra-
tionale, This might lead to the
development of course group-
ings of four or ﬁve courses.
one of which would be a senior
seminar or independent study

out course groupings could
“provide a better general edu-
cation titan the random cafe-
teria selection of introductory
courses that often is chosen
now, and because some such
senior course as suggested
would help to strengthen the
senior year."

Knopf urged special attention
to the senior year in all areas
of Curriculum study “because it
is now the weakest for many
students."

Knopf concluded the report
with a recommendation that

should do something to curtail
“the treadmill of deadlines"
faced by many students due to
the emphasis on work done out

this “treadmill” prevents what
he calls a “certain kind of inde-
pendence" on the part of the
student.

The curriculum study group
which Knopf recommended is
now in the process of formation

Glenn Leggett's program to de-
velop a comprehensive long-
range plan for the college.

Those in the project who had
worked in slum communities be-
fore considered the project val.
uable because it achieved two
results which admittedly sound
unimpressive. First, many
people in the community came
to Billy King and the students
who were in Des Moines most
often for information on Des
Moines agencies and how spe-
ciﬁc problems could be solved.
Secondly, Billy got people to
meet with each other to work
collectively on their problems.

Our overwhelming difiiculty
was finances. The attempt at
Grinnell sponsorship of the proj<
ect was impractical. We faced
a cyclic problem from the ﬁrst.
Without money the project
couldn’t operate, but without
results no one was willing to
give money.

showed a mistrust of the proj-
act. I think the doubt smse
irorn two factors that we didn’t
fully anticipate before the proj-
ect was introduced to the cam-
pus in general. The first is that
Billy King, the community or-
ganizer who lived in Des
Moines, was a slum person him
self, This, while enabling him
to communicate more effective-
ly with the people in the com-
munity, meant he could not
speak to students on the aca-
demic level to which Grinnell
is accustomed Secondly, the
project was so distant that it
had to be controlled by Billy
himself. Obviously, the mistrust
was never overcome.

I think that most people who
worked on the project would
agree that it had the potential
of being valuable as a long
term effort. but the immediate
problems were insurmountable
— Janet Rae Smith

Furthermore, the project@——

turned out to be expensive be-
yond our wildest expectations.
The basic expenses which we
had to meet constantly were
travel to and from Des Moines
once a week if not more often,
paper and printing lor the com-
munity and college both (we
probably printed an average or
500 sheets of paper per week).
and support 0! one person.

Even when we settled on sell.
lng popcorn and were thereby
able to just meet basic exa
penses, our financial difficulties
hampered the project. By that
time the project was well
enough established so that we
could expect rent strikes or per-
haps marches. A leserve fund
of bail money and money to
pay lawyer’s fees would have
been very desirable. During die
iirst rent strike, for example.
the landlord threatened to press
charges against Billy and sev-
eral students. Had he carried
out his threat or had other
threats been made, it would
have been impractical to con.
tinue the project with the lim-
ited finances on which it was
forced to operate

The Pioneers will try to prove

Drake Team Overwhelms Harriers

Hopes that Grinnell c r o s s
country harriers would be first
in the nation, ﬁrst In the Mid-
west, or even first [in lows
came to a grinding halt last;
Friday. slaughtered by a very
potent Drake team. the Pio
neers pulled down only the last
iive places in the meet, suffer.
ing a 15 - 50 defeat.

The cross country team this
weekend will be able to try to
redeem itself against a team
that should be more equally
matched to the Pioneer—Cor-
nell.

Coach Ray Obermlller, not
greatly upset over the Drake
meet, said that it was no dis<
grace to lose to a team so out<
standing. Overmiller added that

with him last 8 e a S o n. De-
partees include end Rick
Schimmel, the league’s leading
scorer, and three all - confer
ence choices: halfback Mike
Vinyard, center Bob Martin,
and tackle Jack Woodman,

Although the Rams, with
thirty - six gridders, have the
conference’s smallest squad,
there are still many excellent
players in their ranks including
all - conference halfback Duane
Schultz.

the Drake coach told him the
aim of the Bulldogs squad is
to stand among the top five
national teams by the end of
the yeart Coach Obermiller ad-
dad that he thinks Drake will
make it.

Tile top finisher for the Pit)-
neers was John Sharpe, in ninth
place. He was followed by
Doug Dray, Steve orlnmall,
Spencer Clark, and Steve Mont-
gomery, in tenth, eleventh,
thirteenth, and fourteenth re-
spectively.

Obermiller is counting on the
Cornell meet to indicate how
his team will shape up in the
conference. Running against
Drake, he feels, tells very lite
the about the Grinnell team as
far as conference action is con.
cerned.

A new rule has been added
to the conterence this year that
will help Obermiller's evaluation.
Every team will now be requir-
ed to send results of all their
meets to the ether nine teams
in the conference.

Pleased with the freshmen
results in their meet against
Drake, Obermiller remains op-
timistic. Although they last, he
noted, they averaged a gain of
abattt thirty seconds over their
best previous time.
