CARLETON UPS OPENS

from THE CARLETONIAN

Saturday night open houses
have been extended to 1 a.m.
as a result of “good arguments"
by the Open House Committee.

with this modification, the
new agreement~ which will go
into eitect tomorrow nightels
identical to last years The
East Side will have open houses
between 7:30 p.m. and man pm
Friday and on Wednesday and
Sunday afternoons.

West Side open houses will be
Saturday between 7:30 and 1:00
am. and Tuesday and Friday
afternoons. All afternoon open
houses extend from 1 through 5.

Widespread Approval

The extended hours on Satura
day night have met with wide-
5 p r e a d approval by Men’s
League, Women’s League, R.A,'s
and Proctors, who have all re»
Cel'itly approved the open house
proposal,

Aim Laws, Chairman of the
Open House committee, attribu-
ted the extended hours to “the
Deans’ willingness to listen with
open minds to our arguments,"
In its meeting with the Deans
last week, the Committee had
contended that an extenSlon of
the hours would make Saturday
open ho u s e s more flexible,
Couples would no longer have
to choose between open houses
and other activities —- they
could go to both. Also, the com
mittee pointed out, roommates
could schedule their visits to
open houses so they wouldn‘t

coincide. “Any inconvenience
which might result because of
later hours can easily be work<
ed out among roommates,"
stated Miss Laws.

Arguments ‘Convincing’
Dean Jean Phillips agreed that
the arguments were “quite con<
vincing. They made very good
arguments; with the later wom-
en's hours it makes good sense
to have longer open houses."

Joel Tibbets, assistant Dean
of Men, feels the extended
hours indicate the College is
“willing to deal with people as
human beings." and is very
happy with the new agreement.
He pointed out, though, that
proctors have been instructed
to enforce the ”No drinking by
mixed couples during open
house" rule.

Commented D e a n Phillips,
“While 21—year»old couples who
drink together outside of open
house might naturally want to
do the same during open
houses, we can't Consider that
possibility for some time. The
FA Committee was quite ex<
plicit in forbidding mixed
drinking in open houses.

“It wouldn't be wise to agi-
tate for future change on this
matter until the values of the
present social policy Change!
are confirmed."

Twenty-one year olds not in
mixed company will be able
to drink in the dorms during
open houses.

iii RADIO NEXT MONTH I

By PAUL NACHMAN

Grinnell‘s ten~watt FM radio
station will take to the air
"hopefully towards the end of
November," according to sta-
tion manager Babak Arinajani.

“The radio station will be
amateur,” he said, “but it’ll be
better than what you can get
now. We'll be stressing classi<
cal music, serious jazz, and seri-
ous folk since the airwaves are
pretty well saturated with rock,"

The station employs 133 peo-
ple—more than one-tenth of the
campus. Many or them are in-
volved in an enormous amount
of behind-the-scenes operations
including engineering, purchas<
ing, and program development.

“It’s an educational experience
for all of us," noted Armaiani,
a senior political science major,
“Few of us know much about
radio."

He stressed the educational
and creative outlets the station
will provide. “I expect there
will be something regarding
communications in the Curricu-
lum Committee’s report. Mr.
I-laveman (a member of the
committee) is very excited
about the radio and has helped
us a lot," Annalani explained.

The staff has just finished
scheduling the 120 hour broad-
cast week. Morning \vakerup
programs, rock shows, news-
casts, and delayed broadcasts
will be interspersed with the
more serious musical offerings.

”Delayed broadcasts" include

BBC transcripts of topical dis:
cussions, tapes of on—campus
gatherings such as the recent
Vietnam discussion in Gates. re<
cordings oi programs at Ex
Loco Parentis, and other gen.
eral features.

“Our news department is tre‘
mendous,” Armajani said with'
enthusiasm, ”I think the 5&1],
may concentrate more On fea<
tures once we get started since
we can get the break on any
campus story,

“We'll have excellent national
and international coverage—in
great depthaby taking full ad-
vantage of what the UPI wire
service provides."

The station has a fairly exteih
sive library of records and will
be able to draw on several pri-
vate campus collections. An
RCA Red Seal classical library,
consisting of more than 140 rec-
ord sets recently arrived unan-
nounced, Armajanl noted—i!
complete gift, he added. other
record companies make regular
contributions.

The disc jockeys for the roclf
shows will play their personal
preferences as to type of mush!
on their programs. “Rock is de.
fined in the broadest sense,“
Armaiani explained. ”We wan!
to encourage the deejays to use
their own discretion in deciding
what to play. The variety will
be a learning experience for
everyone."

The station will be quartered
in the northeast corner of Darby
on the first and second floors.

 

SENATE SEEKS PUBLICITY

The Senate meeting this wed-
nesday was one of the shortest
on record, lasting 21 minutes.
The major issue was an inquiry
by a senator from North con-
ceming the necessity for a reg-
ular column of Senate and other
student government activities to
be run weekly in the 5&1}. It
was felt that the student in-
terest in the workings ot the
government would be height-
ened by the constant exposure
to a description of these ac
tivities, and the general apathy
that is present on campus
would be counteracted.

Another prominent issue was
stimulated by Neil Fischer’s
column on the College Book
Store. An inquiry was made as
to the reason for the lack of
progress by the committee on
the store organized last year.
David Swee answered that in
the chaotic Spring-Fall Senate
changeovers it was absorbed
and smothered by the commit-
tee on the student used book
store.

The lack of visiting privileges
in the Health Center was dis-
cussed. At present, the rules
call for visits only by the North
Campus house presidents and
the South Campus hall health
chairmen. An investigation was

commissioned to d e t e r min is
whether visitation rights could
be extended to include all cases
which would not endanger the
health of the visitor or the
patient.

A Cabinet statement con-
firmed the report that the Wed-
nesday night dress rehearsal of
the Verdi Requiem Mass was
to be cancelled, due to the
professional singers' desire to
preserve their voices.

JUDICIAL COUNCIL

(“The Council will make
public a brief statement ex<
plaining the basis for any
disciplinary action taken."
SGA Constitution, 111, B, 8,
g)

The Judicial Council feels
that stealing from SAGA II
a serious offense. The Coun-
cil believes, however, that
the evidence in the case just
brought before it indicates
that the individual con-
cerned was not guilty of re
current acts of thefts. it
therefore gave him a strong
reprimand and warned him
that any further acts of
theft on his part would M
dealt with more severely.

PHILOSOPHERS
NOT PARTISAIIS

By PAUL JONES

Quite obviously. it would be a mistake to call anyone a partl-
Ian at Grinnell; if there is a place in lowa where there is a great
or diversity oi opinion and ieelings than Grinnell, nobody has
discovered it But not being a partisan does not imply that one
is necessarily a philosopher. I don’t mean a philosopher, however,
the usual man-inrthesstreet concept, but rather one who has a phil-
osophizing spirit; one who does not have opinions for the sake of
opinions, or helieis tor the sake of belief, or revolutions for the
sake of revolutions, but rather one who has a willingness to look
at a problem as reasonably as possible, one who has a passion
[or the truth, whatever it may be. Prolessor George Eastman, in
a recent letter, put it this way:

It strikes me that a genuine philosopher is one who MUST
take all knowledge as his province —- —must become iamiliar
with the conceptual frameworks and operational terminology
of the sciences, economic, soc-anthropology, the tine-arts, law,
history, political science, literature. There is the danger of
shallow dilletantism, but this is a hazard worth risking in
order to acquire it total view of a problem ~ a sense of an
inclusive context — perception of generalizations that explain
large numbers of particulars. Philosophy, I think, represents
one or the few strongholds against the excessive fragmenta-
tion and specialization or our age. it remains, in other words,
one of the low meta-disciplines, one capable or remaining
ABOVE social, cultural, economic, and academic, vested in-

Ierests.

Not every student at Grinnell obviously has this type oi passion
tor the truth; but the unfortunate thing is that veiyjew have any-
thing close to it, even many students who call themselves ‘philos-
ophy majors’.

A great deal oi the cause, of course, can be found in the edu-
cational process which calls for a cognizance of historical data
rather than a development of immediate, creative processes of
thinking But at the same time, it seems clear to me that stu-
dents, particularly at Grinnell, should be concerned with the lock
of direction of most of the educational process here, We are
trained to be good teachers, yes, but to be creative thinkers, no.

Evidently, however, there is not a lack of diilering ideas on
campus; there are rarely two people who think the same way
about anything. So, no, we are not partisans to any one, large
principle of society fostered on us from an external source. But
neither are we philosophers about the principles which we sup-
posedly seek, or the rules which we supposedly think lair or un-
fair. There are too many who are now willing at this point in time
to say that such and such a rule or way ot tile is good or bad;
but to look objectively at the causes of such beliels, the conse-
quences ol such beliels, the components oi such belieis, is out of
the question for Grinnell’s intelligentsia. As William James put it
in ‘The Moral Philosopher and the Moral LiTe’: ‘Ollr society en-
courages us not to be philosophers but partisans.’ The shame at
it is that even though Grinnell has iew partisans in James' sense,
I also hill low philosophers in any sense.

GSM ISSUES VIETNAM PETITION

The members of the Vietnam
Committee of the GSM, after
weeks oi discussions and meet-
Ings have drawn up the tol-
lowing petition, which they en<
courage their fellow students,
teachers, and college adminis-
trators to careiully consider,
and, it in substantial agreement
with, to sign.

This petition will be circulated
on the Grinnell College campus
1mm October 15, to October 29.
At the end of this period, copies
or the petition will be sent to
President Johnson, influential
Senators and Congressmen, as
well as the leading potential
Republican candidates for pres-
ident.

The members oi the Vietnam
Committee of the GSM believe
not only that the Grinnell COL
lege community should make

its views widely known on this
subject, but that these views
can and will have substantial
influence on the upcoming nom-
ination and election of presi.
dential and congressional can-
didates This petition is one
means, though certainly not the
only means, oi having the Grin-
nell College community’s views
on the war in Vietnam made
public, which the Vietnam Com-
mittee oi the GSM wholeheart-
edly supports.
PETITION ON

THE WAR IN VIETNAM

"We, the undersigned, mem-
bers of the Grinnell College
community, do not support the
Johnson Administration’s policy
in Vietnam. we believe that the
War in Vietnam is immoral in
its useless destruction

deem last week was a noblq
lailure but its essential literary,
problem which Is also a social
problem at Grinnell.

That is, how does one express
the horror—not just the cute, or
musing absurdity ot hypocrisy,
but the sheer horror—oi incomt
petent medical service in the
town of Grinnell? How does and
arouse his readers not particu.
larly to spasms oi laughter but
to plain disgust at that service

~and to a consideration oi the
distasteful implications?

Well there are many ways.
One may write some kind or
polemic, a melodrama per
haps, or a Kaika-esque contes-
sion, or perhaps a gruesome
iactual study in Capote style at
numerous cases limping around
canlpusiall oi which would
probably leave the reader al-
ready beset with such problems
as gradepoint and open dorms
with an understanding it not in- ,
lliilererlt frown.

One may try to elicit this
shock through satire which it
not done properly can make
the author look as sick as the
article, and one may always
throw in a little sex which con<
{uses some because they look‘
for sexual implications in eye
erything.

Or one may simply do noth}
ing, thinking the problem—lit-
erary and social—is not that
important to upset people—pan-
ticuiarly the administratiom-
because no one else has writ-
ten about what many have oi-
ten said, and after all, one I!
really not a good enough write!
tor that kind at thing, and what
good will it do because nothing
will be done anyway And one
may not want to think about it
because one has been lucky or
wants to target or likes to woo
ry about great issues like open
dorms.

In other words, strong inten-
tions may make lousy art, But
being neither an artist nor an
English major, in this particu-
lar case I’ll take the intentions.

DEAN'S DAY
APPROACHES

With all the publicity about
convocation Weekend, Hal-
Ioween has been somewhat left
out. in fact, it is not even men-
tloned on the student activities
calendar, except in the sym-
bolic orange and black colors.

Aiter myriad visiting dignl.
taries and parents, another try
lng rootball game, and waiting
in long lines for meals, people
are sure to be worn out and
ready for a change. Halloween
offers just such an opportunity
—unplanned, unpubliciLed ao<
tivities without the over-
hanging educational implica‘
tions.

For suggestions of places to
visit, scenic Hazelwoud Ceme<
tery and Arbor Lake come first
to mind. These surroundings
are ideal tor a complete
change in environment. The
woods and gravestones, along
with the ﬂowing spirits sure to
be present on All Saints’ Day
Eve, ought to provide anyone
with enough spooks for an eve-
ning.

To reach the cemetery, take
West Street south to Washing-
ton, tum West and you’re
bound to run into It.

Or perhaps, since Iowa is the
heart of the corn and therefore
the pumpkin belt, a real pump
kin patch might suit your de-
sires. All it takes is a little
searching and you’re bound to
come onto a few of the friendly
jack-o-ianterns.

one such place leads the
searcher south on East Street
past Lake Nyanzn. Go on past
Garfield Street and the Weath-
erworn two story house remi-
niscent or movie homes (or
ghosts. Keep going until you
reach an unassuming brown
house surrounded by the
orange symbols at Halloween,

Who knows, it you wait long
enough and are quiet enough,
you might even see the great
pumpkin arise irorn one or the
vines,

LEST WE FORGET . . .

Grinnell is residential. All but a few students live in the cola
lege's residence halls on the campus. Residence of students in
college is needed to create a sense of community, to emancipate
students from adolescent interests, to tree them from prejudices,
to foster independence, and to provide new experiences, perspeCs
lives, and aspirations.

Grlluiell Is located ill a rural setting. Its location apart irom
large population centers reduces distractions, promotes hard work,
encourages primary attention to studies. and favors participation
in the life of the campus. Flaming and execution of social activ-
ities depend to a large extent upon student leadership and initia-
tive rather than commercial entertainment. Thus, the use of leis-
ure time itself becomes a worthwhile educational experience.

Grinnell’s style at lite is simple. Social, cultural, and extra-
curricular activities flourish in number and variety on the Grin-
nell campus. Yet the style In which they are Conducted is simple
and unpretentious. Expensive wardrobes, cars, and large amounts
of spending money are not necessary {or success in the student
society. In fact, there is no social stratification among students.
and every social activity is open to all without charge, Grinnell
has no sororities or iratemities, but the advantages of small-group
living are present in its unique residence system.

Grinnell is informal Ind flexible in policies and administration.
As a small college with an exceptionally able student body, the
college is able to experiment in education, to change and to adapt
readily. it employs tiexibiiity in the organization of curriculum
and diversity in the methods oi instruction. All members of the
community, including students, participate in governing the com-
munity's aiiairs, which are conducted in a democratic and non-
bureaucratic fashion,

Griunell is independent. As an independent college Grinneli is

To the Editor:

As I now conclude my sec«
ond semester ot Humanities, I
believe that l have come to
some understanding of the ped-
agogical strategy with which
the stall approaches the
course. Between lectures and
classes, dozens oi people have
come before me in an attempt
to get me to think critically
about the readings and to em-
pathize with the characters
therein.

I have concluded that the
more one is able to understand

at this conclusion that 1 rec‘
ommend a minimum oi one
act of sexual intercourse as a
pie-requisite for all students
taking Humanities lOl»lOZ.

How can a student iully ap-
preciate the immobility ot
Odysseus after seven years or
indulgence with Kalypso, ii the
reader himself has no more
than a textbook knowledge oi
their relationship? Can the pas-
sion of Dido be iully compre«

claim to be no more than an
innocent bystander? Are not
the woes of Paolo and Frances-

the uninitiated? And as for
Donne, well, let's be realistic,

I realize, of course, that the
above statements are not sui-
iicient to warrant such a revos
Iutionary change in the admina
istration's academic policy. i
do, however. propose that Grin-
neli conduct a test which will
unquestionably prove the rela-
tive merits of my theory.

The test involves assigning
those teachers who have two
Humanities classes one section
comprised of students who
have had sexual experience
and'one section comprised or
students who have had no sex-
ual experience. During the
course of the two semesters,
simple comparison of the pen
iotmances of each class should,
'i believe. provide copious evi-
dence as to the merit of my
thesis.

SCARLET AND BLACK

GRINNELL YEARBOOK CENSORED

(In the interests of muck-
raking, we present a Carle<
tonian point or view.)

By RON FISCUS

Grinnell College has a new
nudent newspaper, and a new
yearbook. Or is it that Grinnell
has the oldest student newspa-
per and oldest yearbook west
or the Mississippi? A simple
Question? You judge.

Last tall, newspaper editor
Krystina Neuman decided to
change the name of the Scarlet
J: Block, which was indeed the
oldest college newspaper west
oi the Mississippi, to the ne—
porter. (Official Grinnell publi-
cations also boast that Grinnell
has, among other things the
oldest outdoor paddle tennis
courts west oi the Mississippi.
The unoiiicial student version
has it that certain other out-
dated Campus buildings tall in
to that category. Some even
suggest that Grinnell has the
oldest administration west of
the Mississippi (Be that as it
may, it Carls are inclined to
laugh at the College‘s preten-
tions, they might do well to take
note of the latest in Tea Room
tea bags.)

The new name for the news-
paper stuck despite vociferous
opposition from traditionalists,
and the Reporter went its way
raking all the muck that it saw

iit to print, in the iinest tra-
dition of student newspapers.
But Miss Neuman happened to
be a close iriend of, and or:-
casional model tor, photographer
Henry Wilhelm, who just hap-
pened to be one oi the co-ed-
itors oi the 196586 yearbook,
and here the plot thickens.

Wilhelm, too, had a penchant
for namechanging. having
changed the name oi the year-
book from the Cyclone (oldest
west of the. . . yeah, right) to
onnneu College 1966. The saga
of Gl'lnllell College load is some-
thing else again, Plagued by
chronically postponed deadlines,
it never reached the printer un-
til the spring oi 1967, and even
then it was whisked back to
the College with a request ior
a disclaimer of responsibility.
The yearbook, it seemed, had
changed more than its name.
It purportedly showed pictures
at a pot party and of student
couples leaving a local motel.
it contained few pictures oi
homecoming, the cheerleaders,
or any of the other more tra-
ditional aspects of campus life.

The college was advised that
It Would be risking libel suits
it the yearbook were printed
in its name. There ensued, as
one might expect, a controversy
with Grinnell landing in the

pages of Newsweek, and even
making the women's section of
the Minneapolis Star.

The College proposed that the
(mostly iaculty) Committee on
Student Publications revie W
(edit? censor?) the Copy in con-
junction with the Coiiege's le-
gal counsel, Editor Wilhelm re-
iused, retained possession oi
the copy, which was legally his,
and determined to have it pub-
lished privately.

Meanwhile. Miss Neuman (re
member her and the Reporter?)
was iuming over the College's
“inability to deal with contro«
versial s t u d e n t publications"
and perhaps even more over
her ejection irom a meeting oi
the Committee on Student Pub-
lications, of which she was a
non-voting member. of the coni-
mittee members, she was the
only one who had seen the
copy.

In protest, she resigned as
editor or the neporter, leaving
Grinnell without a newspaper
or a yearbook, but with the
biggest squabble west oi the
Mississippi.

Finally, this tall. new editors
for both the newspaper and the
yearbook were found. The news
paper has been renamed the
Scarlet Jr Black, the yearbook
the Cyclone. Grinnell College

A STUDENT OPINION

PUTS DOWN GRINNELI. MEN

"The Grinneil man must be
everything just enough, but
nothing too much —- good look-
ing enough, religious enough,
athletic enough, ablo enough.

“He must measure up to 1
standard of what has been
called a ‘handsome mediocri-
ty‘. He is a sort of youthful,
highly idealized portrait of a
Rotarian. The Grinneil girl is
all this likewise. in 8 word—
speciiic description is unneces-
sary—she is the ideal mate of
the Grinnell man.

“It can be seen that to main-
tain the eminent niceness or
this artistocracy, there is not
much room {or difference.
T h era is something in this
mild, sweet leniency that tends
to acquiescence. In tact. the
danger of becoming ‘the Grin-
neli type’ has sent many an in-
teresting youngster hot toot out
o! Grinnell. It should be added,

iege publication, will be pub-
lished before Christmas; and
Grinnell College, oldest college
west oi the you~know~what, il
at least a year older.

however, that several highly
interesting scandals have
come bursting through thin
Imiling surtace. . .

"Grinnell is not the place in
which to look for eagerness o!
inquiry, youthful audacity 01
thought or action, really stir.
ring intellectual currents. But
it has always had and doe I
still have a personal and inti-
mate charm.”

CAMPUS NOTES

Grinnell will have a new
musical experience Saturday
night in Paul Zonn’s program
of contemporary compositions.
In an effort to “open minds
and make judgments on today’s
world,” Mr. Zonn is presenting
an evening of music never heard
before in this part of the coun-
Irv.

The concert, which begins at
B pm. in Roberts Theatre, con-
tains a variety of music from
electronic to open style notation
10 the more familiar sounding
"Sonata for Solo Viola."

Electronic music comes from
a tape recorder and consists
of electronic manipulation of
sound, such as that heard in
the recent Stuart Dempster con-
cert. Open style may be called
indeterminent or aeleotoric and
will be heard in “Sonorum One,"
a sound piece performed by the
Collegium Musicum.

L’Avenulra is this weekend‘s
movie, to be shown in ARH
Friday at 10:30 13.111. and Sun-
day at 9:30 pm. It is the first
of a trilogy or black and white
films by Italian director Mich-
elangelo Antonioni, the other
two being La Nntte and L’-
Eclise. Antonioni has since been
known for his color films, The
Red Desert, and, more recently,
Blowup.

Starring Monica Vitti,
"L'Aventura" is a story of
Italy's idle rich and modern
society in which a girl myster-
iously disappears on a yachting
trip. and her lover and her best

(in a ditterent level the movie
concerns, as the other films in
the trilogy, the impermanenco
of love, the difficulty of com!-
munication. and the ease of be-
trayal of one’a self or someone
else. Again as in all the early
Antonioni tilms, the gripping
element of the film is not the
action, but the characterization.

Antonioni developed his own
style of film making, which be-
came a changing point in the
development of that art. “L’Av-
entura is perhaps the best exam»

GRAY MATTER

in nu. GRAY

There is something innately unfair about forcing athletes of
he genre to play athletes who are schooled in another sport. There
r5 also something innately llnfair about making girls play boys
in a game which is built around speed. Be that as it may, one
can hardly say that the two handicaps balance out, besides, any
one with any sense knows better than to bet against the girls‘ tield
hockey team. The game of field hockey is played on a large red
tangular field with goals at either end. One wouldn't have known
this, though, if the ﬁrst game watched turned out to be the cone
test between the girls and the boys' soccer team because the pre-
dominance of action was centered around the beleaguered goal of
the woefully outmanned (outgirled?) soccer team, The only thing
I can say to the girls is to repeat the traditional cry of the over<
,whelmed opposition: “Pick on somebody your own size (shape?)."
It has six starters over 6'3", it has three starters that weigh
over 220 pounds. Who is it? Why, it is the Langan football team
that brought glory to its hall by winning a football game this year.
It is also the team that has violated the Cardinal rule of l. M.'s by
forfeiting two of its games. While we must appreciate their con-
oern that they might get hurt (i’), we must deplore their lack of
competitive spirit which is the heart of l. M. sports.

The l. M. season is now almost over and the championship has
boiled clown to a battle between Dibble and Smith. This Showdown
will occur Sunday at 3:00 on the Soccer Field with the annual
none: Bowl.

Vitational when it hosts Knox
ill a Midwest Conference dual
Saturday.

The Pioneers finished eighth
in the 13-team field at the ln-
yitational last Saturday, and
had only one runner place

among the top in individual
finishers. Doug Dray was 18th.

The Pioneers also lost to
Carleton 16-46, and the Univer-
sity of Chicago, 27-23, in dual
meets tabulated from the in‘
dividual placing in the invita<
tional. They were losses num-
ber four and five against one
Wm.

“Despite our disappointing
record, we are making steady
progress." said Coach Ray
Oben'niller. “But, we haven‘t
been able to come up with a
really outstanding team effort
yet. In every meet. one or two
boys have performed below
par, and this has cost us at
least two victories. Hopefully,
we are saving that one out‘
standing team perfonnance for
the conference meet."

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN on

Do you play bridge just to get good hands? If you do the odds
are stacked against you. Take for example the following hypotheti-
cal situation: you are dealer and you deal yourself a hand without
looking at it. What are the. odds for getting a good hand?

One hand in four will be good enough for an opening bid (thir.
teen or more high card points). Of the other three, two hands wrli
fall between seven and twelve points, and the remaining hand in
four will have six or less points.

of your opening hands, only three iii eight will have sixteen or
more points; which is about one hand out of every ten that you
get. it you play Goren (strong) two—bids, only one hand in one
hundred and twenty-five will have the necessary twenty-one or
more high card points necessary to open that bid.

Well then, you play bridge to get distributional hands. Under
those circumstances you’re just about as bad off. one hand in three.
you Won’t have a five-card suit. Thirteen hands ill twenty Won't
have a singleton or void, where only one hand in twenty-five will
have a void. ‘i‘llree hands out of eight will have a two biddable
suits; and only one hand in seven Will have ten or more cards in
two suits. One hand in mirty»three will have at least a seven card
suit.

But all these odds are based upon it perieetly random deal
which. of course, you say. is impossible. That’s true, but a deck
is inclined to run “stale" or “cold" rather than “warm”. The
manner in which cards are played in tricks, placed together and
“insufficiently shuffled" inhibits the possibility of random deals.
To solve that situation, you can try playing a couple hands of soll<
taire, or dealing “goulash,” Le. dealing five to each player, five
again and then three. Generally speaking, though, the bridge
player is condemned to eat his staple of average hands, which
brings up a good point. Contract bridge is a game of mileage, The
better you do with the cards you get, the more miles to the gallon
in your game. Every bridge player over the long run will get about
ten points per hand, but some bridge players will score more
points.
