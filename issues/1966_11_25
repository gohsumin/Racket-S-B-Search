ln itself, the discussion was
not a particularly noteworthy
event, but the situation was
complicated by the time: It
was shortly alter midnight and
amidst the harmless discussion
of Dante the students were
committing the otiense oi illegal
visitation. The guilty persons
had already done their duty as
campus enforcement oiiiciais
and had apprehended them-
selves for the Violation. Their
case is now pending belore the
student courts,

Earlier in the same evening,
701] students gathered in ARH
auditorium to hear SGA Pres-
lder: Steve Kent explain the
rationale for a deliberate Vio-

latlun or the college’s rule on

illegal visitations.

A number of factors were in-
VDlVed in the student leaders’
decision to go through with
some kind of protest demonstra-
tion, said Kent,

The particular iactor which
forced the demonstration at this
time was what Kent called “an
unacceptable penalty" dealt to
three students by the Faculty
Committee an Student Affairs.
The students were originally
suspended for the remainder [if

By HENRY WILHELM

The controversial caseuof ll-
legal Visitatinns, which résulted
in the suspension of three stu-
dents {or the remainder of this
semester and all of next semes-
ter, is the result of a Complex
chain of events in which good
intentions on the part of many
students and some faculty mem-
bers went awry when the case
became enmeshed in me col~
lege ”policy“ on student con-
duct.

Last Friday the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs, com-
posed ot tour voting taculty

To the Editor, and that self—

We are glad to see that
there are members 01 this cams

accept restrictions which apply

ot to themselves, but to others.

2 do have several pertinent
questions:

1. of whose Well-being are
you speaking? Only the men’s,
or that of the entire campus.

2. Are the women of South
Campus responsible for your
well-being to the extent that
they should be penalized for
your immaturity?

3. Does the “some of us"
who are "incapable of hand-
ling unlimited Ireedom” re-
fer to the entire campus, or
men only?

4. As you are so willing to
accept with maturity restric-
tions placed on others, could
you with equal maturity ac»
cept the same restrictions up-
on yourself? Graduated men’s
hours?

Gran-led a plan for graduated
hours may be the best, because
it would allow students to as
rume responsibility gradually as
they reach definitions of Iheu‘
“social and moral standards."
We agree that the question of
“illicit moral behavior" should
not be the only guideline in tie»
termining miles both workable
and conducive to the develop
ment of this maturity.

We are not asking the col<
legs to “cater to the demands
of students who seek an en-
vironment where they can
practice their brand of freedom
without regards to the need of
students who one not prepared
for such a step." What we are
seeking is an environment
which will encourage the de-
velopment of mature, reasoned
behavior, rather than behavior
iii-bitrarily imposed by external
regulations.

Your suggestion of “a means
by which special permission
may he obtained to (occasion-
Illy) stay out beyond hours” is
already available when a plans

Makes Proposal

To the Edito .
The following is a short piece

submitted to the Executive
Cabinet at the all-students meet-
ing, November 22.

l have a proposal to make.
First of all, I am assuming that
we want action on the long
range issues of open dorms,
abolition of the faculty com-
mittee on student aflairs, and
increased student participation
in college policy. in accordance
with this assumption I disagree
with the proposed method of
action, namely the executive
cabinet sit-ill. lt is a very dras
tic stcp to take. We are playing
all our cards at once and we
are breaking a rule. if our
move tails our lawlessness will
be criticized by everyone. And
because there is little organiza~
tion of the student body as a
whole, our move will he likely
to fail. Because this action has

seemed virtually spontaneous lo
the student body, many will
hold back for [ear of “rushing
into things" and “going too
for.” Certainly the faculty will
be alarmed. The advantages of
orgauitation in this case out-
weigh the advantages of press
ing for our demands during a
period when martyr sympathy
runs high.

Therefore, I propose a step
by step process organized and,
lawful and rational. By escalat-
ing our methods of protest one
step at a time we solidify stu-
dent unity and we give the ad-
ministration time to think the
issue over. We give them an
opportunity to save face and
agree with us. Right now we
are backing them into a corner.

I propose the following tenta-
tive step by step plan:

. Petition

. Resolution by the Senate

. Personal appeal by the
Senate to the President

. Executive cabinet sitrin

. Campus sit-in

. Resignation by

officers

We can decide to make the
steps different. That can be
decided in deliberation later.
My main point is that we ought
to organize our movement realr
ist‘irally with some chance of
success.

This proposal was made Wed-
nesday night. Now that the ac-
tion has been taken, however,
I find that as a student I must
support the executive cabinet
and senate in their goals and
activities. Nevertheless I urge
that concrete plans he iormu-
lated with long range goals in
mind.

invalid Generalizations

Last Friday night, a professor told me that I
should be ashamed. I asked him, "Ashamed for
what?" The reply was, "Ashamed for that col-
umn you wrote in today’s 5&3." Well, I thought
about it, I did, and I finally had to agree with
him. Doggone if, I an. ashamed. The grammar
was terrible wasn’t it? The paragraphs didn’t
flow easily, did they? Yes, i am ashamed that
it was badly written. But I’m not ashamed be-
cause I wrote it. As a matter of fact, far from
being ashamed for my column, I am ashamed
for my school. I am ashamed that I have been
here so long and not become ashamed of this
school until now. Yes, by God, I’m ashamed.

So, now, “Why", you ask. Happy to oblige, of
course. There have been a great many things
said about the administration, what it’s doing,
what it’s not doing, and What it should do. My
question is now, “Has the school been acting in
conscience?” I wonder if this school has any
conscience at all. You continue to kick out the
most worthwhile and keep the most worthless
people; you maintain standards that are antiqu-
ated and expect the student to remain quiet and
go blithely about his business; you push onto

spirits.

our student leaders the responsibilities for seeing
the school function well, and watch the best ones.
the ones who try, crumble under the load, from
student government to the campus publications.
And the student who is imaginative, inventivo
and is willing to take on responsibility (which ho
can do only by inventing it at this school) doesn't
get much of a chance to stay here. As usual, a few
people do all the work. This school had better
decide whether it wants its students to read book.
or learn how to live.

Perhaps 1 did speak late in my column last week
about an issue that was already a matter of
policy decision, but even if late, at least 1 spoke.
That is one better than most of the people on this
campus. Sometimes I can’t believe you’re really
out there, you’re so silent. I'm afraid, though,
that I Can’t be blithe about this school. But let
me change something, Before, I said that l was
ashamed for my school. But I don't want to he
a martyr; I won’t shoulder the blame for what
this school does. The shame is on you, of you; i
am ashamed of you. So if you are out there, let’s
hear from you. I’m tired of a school full of blithe

leMoyne Applicants Needed

By, KRYS NEU'MAN

Students interested in particl-
pating in the exchange next se-
mester with LoMoyne College,
Memphis, Tennessee, s h o u l d
Contact Richard Winters (Asso-
ciate Dean of the College) by
next Wednesday, November an.

In a recent 8&3 survey, stu-
dents who have already partial-
pated in the program and cam-
pus administrators who have
been involved in its planning an-
swered questions about what a
Grinnell student should expect
in going to LeMoyne for a se-
mester and mode suggestions as
to desirable attributes for the
exchange 5 Lude n t. (LeMoyne
was also included in this sur-
vey, but its response was too
slight to be considered repl‘e»
senthtive.)

Responses to the survey indi-
outed dissatisfaction with the
selection process in the past.
Winters, present head of the
program on this campus, says
that not enough students apply
for the exchange to allow for
competitive selection. Last year
he had to recruit students up to
the last minute. Few men ap-

Perry Named To
Admissions Post

The appointment of Tracy B,
Perry as a Grinnell College ad-
missions counselor has been
announced by President Glenn
Leggett.

Perry, who joined the Grin.
nell admissions stafl NOV. I4,
will work principally in laws
and Illinois.

A graduate of the Nichols
School in Buffalo, N.Y., and
llebron Academy in Hebron,
Me., Perry received a B.A. de-
gree from Middlebury College
in 1961. He has done graduate
worn at the University of Var»
mom and the University of
Buffalo and has also Studied at
the Goethe Institute in Ger-
many.

Perry has held a position in
industry in Buffalo for the past
year.

plied and only one was sent to
LeMoyne with four women.
These students felt it bad policy
to send only one male.

it was also suggested in the
survey response that Grinnell is
only sending its “safe” students
— that less emphasis should be
put on accepting students with
good grades and more on those
who stand out socially, in ex.
tracurricular a C t i V l t i e s or
through a special talent.

Although one participant felt
that a special talent might
cause those around him to stand
in awe, and, therefore, create
barriers to friendship, the others
considered a talent quite useful.

One respondent suggested,
“Why don’t they send someone
controversial who would be
missed? Send someone who is
public in his way of life. He
should be one who is actively
e god in extracurricular ac<
f as on campus — in the
newspaper, drama, art, for ex;
ample. If he is the type of per-
son who stimulates those around
him here, he may do so also at
Lelvtoyne and at Grinnell again
when he comes back. More
people will gain from his expe-
rience."

The respondents generally
agreed that grades should be
either a secondary consideras
tion in accepting exchange stu-
dents or should be judged only
on a par with social attributes.
The ability to meet and get
along with people was greatly
emphasized.

One student proposed that an
applicant with less than a ‘0”
average should he considered if
other worthwhile activities were
prohibiting him from attaining
higher grades.

The qualities of sincerity,
maturity and motivation were
usually the first to be recom-
mended by those questioned.
One Student stated, “Dissatis
faction with Grinnell should not
he the major motivation.”

It was also the predominant
opinion that primary motiva<
tion for applying should be the
desire for a different cultural
experience and for the under—
standing that grows out of it.

Dale Terry (Registrar), who
helped [0 put the LeMoyne prcls
gram into effect several years
ago, mentioned that a semester
at LeMoyne should particuiar-
ly concern Lhose students inter-
ested in or majoring In the so-
cial sciences.

There was a difference of
opinion as to whether the ex-
change program should neces-
sarily affect the wider campus
community or whether its pur-
pose should be limited to that of
individual experience and gain.

One participant Said, “The im-
portant and unique thing about
the program is that it is a stu-
dent exchange, and Gzinnell
students go there as student:
and friends, not as reformers,
lecturers, crusaders.” This ra-
sponse went on to state, "I per-
sonally felt that I received more
than I gave to the program."

Another approach was that
the exchange “wastes opportu-
nity” when the available “di-
versity of background and expo-
n'ence is not shared on an ‘in-
stitutional Ievel'.” F u r t h e r
(from a different response), the
opinion was held that exchange
students should be involved in
the larger Memphis community.
This former exchange student
listed groups on the LeMoyno
Campus itself which provide in-
roads into such involvement.

Those who were of the opinion
that the exchange should have
a broader, rather man merely
individual, effect generally did
not feel this had been accom-
plished as the program now
stands.

Although one respondent said
that the exchange prevents stu-
dents from taking courses or-
taxed at Gn'nnell that they spe-
cifically want, the others em-
phasized that the experience it-
self is much more important
than classwork he might take
that semester.

When asked how graduate
schools View a student’s semes-
ter away from Grinnell on the
LeMoyne program, Mr, Terry
Said they don’t consider it det-
rimental to be involved in such
a program even though it means
interrupting the Grlnnel] course
of study.

Mike Pill, Stanley Wezelman,
and Ray Horn argued against
maintaining the initiative hind

wanted a cut in the fund “to

the halls have shown their abili-

Horn pleaded, “Don't. use the

ate ”to have Confidence in their

Wezelman sought more in-

The Real Problem

The recent suspensions of three students for
visitation: violations raise a number of important
problems for the college community. Steve Kent
dealt ably with many of these in his speech
Wednesday evening in ARH auditorium. Such

roblems as the proposed change in women’s

ours, the need for a reevaluation of the visita-
tions policy, and the weakness of the college’s
counseling program require urgent attention.

But we think one problem above all others
pervades the whole situation and makes rational
consideration of these other concerns all but im-
possible This problem has to do with the old and
much abused concept of “in loco parentis."

President Leggett told the 5&8 in September
of 1965, "I don’t believe in the ‘in loco parentis‘
concept. The time is gone when the administration
of a college can regulate student morality; besides,
I look too young to be anyone’s father.”

Obviously, President Leggett has either
changed his View or else he is conveniently not
letting it affect his administration of the college.
There can be no doubt that the matter of the sus-
pensions of the three students is a clearcut case of
penalizing students for failure to conform to a set
moral code, determined by college officials.

The only real point to the regulation which
the students violated and which makes it an of-
fense for any off-campus men to have women in
their apartments is to forbid students an oppor-
tunity for sexual activity.

The question, then, is whether the college has
any business dictating a code of sexual conduct to
its students. The role of the residential liberal arts
college in developing the "total person" does imply
a responsibility of the college to help students form
habits of personal behavior which will contribute
to the fulfillment of their lives. Still, a responsibil»
ity to help is hardly a responsibility to dictate as
{is presently being done in matters of sexual con~

uct.

Surely, there are problems, perhaps grave
problems, in our whole society’s outlook on sex.

hese problems cannot be solved by blindly ate
tempting to prevent any kind of intimate sexual
contact between students. in the first place, such
prevention is simply an impossible task. Sexual
activity goes on despite regulations and will con-
tinue to go on no matter how the rules are al-
tered. ,

But more importantly, prevention, even if ef~
lective, does nothing to alter the basic misconcep-
tions and unhealthy attitudes which people have
about sex. If they do anything at all, preventive
regulations are apt to add to guilt feelings and
compound our sexual problems. Such regulations
do nothing to educate students about the implica»
trons and consequences of sexual activity.

It seems to us that the college’s role should
be one of education not embargo. if nothing else,
the college might aim toward the minimum goal
of enabling students, administrators and faculty
members to frankly discuss sexual problems with»
out blushing. The immensity of even this simple
task should give some indication of the gravity of

the problems relating to the sexual conduct of
Gunnell students.

dents that the penalty was “un-
acceptable to the students and
to us as student leaders and by
many faculty,” Kent also said
that the penalty as later amend-
ed by Dean James Stauss to al-
low the students to get aca~
demic credit for this semester
and be suspended second semes-
ter was “in my opinion still too
severe a penalty, and a long
way from what i feel would be
a reasonable and equitable pol-
icy and penalty."

Beyond the particular cases
of the three students, Kent
felt that a number of other is-
sues had been raised in re-
cent Weeks which demanded
an expression of student con-
cern. Kent said, “We feel
several oi the implications
need to be dealt with in the
very near future." ‘

Kent pointed first to the is-
sue oi a change in women's
hours which he said seemed to
be getting “caught up in tho
bureaucratic process oi discus-
sion.” The student Senate has
already passed a resolution
calling for virtual abolition oi
women's hours and the resolu-
tion is now being considered by
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs. Student leaders
asked the Committee and other
administration officials for ac»
lion which would put the hours
change into effect by the be-
ginning oi the second semester.
The Committee and the Officials
have replied that nothing can
he done that fast,

Kent pointed also to the need
for discussion of a change in
the present visitation policy
which allows men and women
[0 Visit each other in their
rooms only on Sunday after-
noon. Administrative officials
so far have virtually ruled out
the possibility or a change in

this policy and have refused to
discuss the problem formally.
Kent said he felt the problem
was or “great enough conceni
that it. requires the whole col-
lege community to go into it in
some depth with an eye toward
changing the policy.” _

A third area to which Kent
hoped Wednesday night's dem-
onstration would draw attention
was the need for a reevalua-
tion of the college's counseling
program. Kent said, “We've
felt the need for this for a long
time." He Said that such a re
evaluation needed a “higher
priority” and that probably ma-
jor changes would be needed in
the present program

The suspension oi the three
students had particular impli-
cations for die counseling pro<
gram because the violation

of which they were convicted

come lo light as a result of
the psychological problems of

a fourth student.

Kent next pointed to the
“dual almost contradictory
role” or the faculty committee
on student affairs which has an
important part to play in policy
decisions and must also serve
as an independent judiciary in
judging violations of policy.

Kent recommended that the
faculty committee on student
Affairs be dissolved and re-
placed by a community court
system with both students and
inculty participating and that
another Committee on Student
Affairs composed of students.
faculty and deans be formed to
handle policy considerations.

Kent concluded that Wednes-
day nights' demonstration was
intended to “make vivid” the
students concern and to “torce
a particular policy decision,”
and to “impress upon people
the necessity of a reevalua-
tion.” Kent said he felt the vio-
lailon was in “the best tradi-
tion of the present student gov-

ernment." and thus reflected a
reasonable and rational ap«
proach to the problems at hand.
“After all,“ he said, “we are
certainly not advocating com—
plete anarchy."

Kent's speech was followed
by questions from the students
present. Most of the questioners
seemed equ ally concerned
about the questions of policy
Kent had raised, but some ex-
pressed the feeling that openly
violating the rule was too ex-
treme a step. Jeff Burnhan-i
suggested, “It seems to me the
demonstration is premature,"
and another student questioned
Whether the student leaders
might be jeopardizing their role
as negotiators.

The violation itself included
all but two of the AWS Board
members and all but four of
the CofHP members, as well as
four members of the Executive
Cabinet. One of the abstaining
AWS Board Members was out
of town and one of the abstain-
ing Coil-1P members feared he
might jeopardize his financial
scholarship if he participated.
The other four felt the violation
was too extreme a step to take.
The fifth Executive Cabinet
member, Bob Johnston, didn't
participate because it was felt
that as social coordinator, he
was not an enforcement official.

The need for some kind of
demonstration of the student
leaders’ concern became appar-
ent to the five members of the
Executive Cabinet earlier in the
week. The five include. besides
Kent, Bob Foote, CofnP Presi—
dent, Karen Lauterbach, AWS
Board President. Bond Faulwellv
Speaker of the Senate, and Bob
Johnston, Social Coordinator.
In discussions among them
selves und with other students
and friendly faculty members.
the Executive Cabinet finally
decided late Tuesday upon a
violation of the visitations rule
by the AWS Board and CDIHP.
The possibility of a mass stu-
dent violation was rejected as
irresponsible and uncontroll-
able. The Executive Cabinet felt
that the smaller demonstration
would be more likely to have
constructive effects as an evi-
dence of student concern.

The students participating
in the violation met Wednes-
day night shortly beiore Mid-
night in Gales Hill. Accord-
ing to college regulations it
was actually illegal for the
women to be in the hall after
10:30 pm so they were, in
effect, guilty of an offense
simply for stepping in the
door.

About 12:30, the student:
split into three groups, one go-
ing to the Clark Hall Presi-
dent's suite and the third re-
maining in Gates. They spent
the night sleeping on couches
and in sleeping bags on the
ﬂoor. The women left early
Thursday morning to return to
South Campus.

All of the women had signed
out in accordance with college
regulations, giving north Cam-
pus as their destination. Thus,
they are not technically guilty
of a violation of women’s hours
or oi illegal absence.

There has not yet been any
official college reaction to the
violation. College offices were
closed yesterday for the
Thanksgiving Holiday, and
President Glenn Leggett has
been out of town until today.

Knowlton was seen with the
girl who is now home on medi-
cal leave in the Forum on the
night of November 12. Both he
nnd the girl were slightly drunk
at the time and there was some
trouble with Forum officials but
they were not asked to leave the
Forum as has been rumored.
That night Knowlton and the
girl went to the of! campus
apartment on Sixth Avenue
where both Knowlton and Han-
enberg live.

Michele Anderson, bette r
known on campus as “Mimi,"
was also spending the night at
the apartment. Kenneth Adel.
man, a senior who until
very recently dated the girl who
was with Knowlton, became
aware that she was at the apart-
ment, and Bi about 2:30 arm.
Sunday morning went over to

EETING oi Sim Knni. Karen Lau—

in" originated.

the apartment with a iriend or
his, Nordahl Brue, senior, in an
attempt to get the girl to re—
turn to her dorm. The girl did
not want to leave and a heated
discussion followed between her
and Adelman. She told the 5&3
that some physical force was
used on her by Adelman in the
attempt to make her leave the
apartment. She said she might
have agreed to return to her
dorm ii Adelman had “not been
so pushy” and were it not tor
her tear or being caught trying
to enter the dorm through a
Window. She said that Knowlton
did not try to make her stay;
he leit the decision up to her.
During the disturbance Ander-
son was seen by both Erue and
Adeiman, although Adelman
told the 5&3 he did not know
who she was or that she was
even a student at Grinnell. He
said that he was simply not
concerned with the then uniden-
tified girl. Brue, who did know
Anderson, said that he did not
lnior—m Adelinan at her identity
until Monday morning.
Adelman told the 5&3 that he
had been concerned about the
welfare of his former girlfriend
recently because she was be-
having in a way much different
than she usually does. Adelman
had Called the girl's father sev-
eral times that weekend in an
attempt to get him to do some-
thing to help. Her father asked
her sister. it student in another

Midwest college, to come to
Grinnell to vi 't the girl. The
sister came during the week-
end and checked on the girl but
returned to college Sunday.

Adelman, still concerned about
the tact that nothing was be-
ing done to help the girl, talked
to Henrerork Steiner, English,
Monday in the early afternoon.
Steiner, a personal iriend oi
Adelman’s, told the 5&3 he
thought something should be
done and he went to see Dean
of Women Alice Law that after-
noon. Steiner told the 5&3 that
Adelmsn had mentioned the
presence of “another gir" but
that he did not know whether
she was a town girl or a stu-
dent. Steiner said he passed this
information on to Dean Low and
Dean ot Men S. Eugene Thomp-
son.

Steiner said the other two
people (l-lanenberg and Ander-
son) were Significant to Adel»
man because they would do
nothing to help. Adelman told
the 5&3 that he “was not and
is not now” concerned about
Hanenberg and Anderson.

When Steiner was asked by
the 5&3 ii he thought the then
unknown girl would be in
trouble if she was iound out he
said, "I assumed that it she
was a student and they did find
out there would be trouble —-
this was only a passing consid«
eralibn on my part. it you get
caught you get caught."

Steiner went on to say, "The
issue is not whether students
can experiment with sex — only
how they go about it. For all
practical purposes their crime
(reierrlng to l-lsnenberg and
Anderson) was getting caught. 1
think' for purposes at rationale,
in tern-lab! the committee de-
cision, their crime was that
they did not take some meas-
ures to help these people (re-
ierring tn Adelman and the
girl). I don't think the commit-
tee was upholding a moral
structure. 1 think they were re-
moving {rcm campus people
who are not contributing to the
campus or who are not beneﬁt-
ing from the campus."

Steiner explained. “I haven’t
the slightest idea if suspension
will do these individuals any
good H only time will tell. i
don't think the loss of these
two people (Hanenberg and An-
derson) will do the college any
ham.”

He added, “The major con-
sequence, ! suppose, [mm the
committee’s point at view, is
that the college is willing and
able to maintain the integrity
of its rule structure. The col-
lege is not in u position to
provide an enviromnent that
gets in the way of its primary
function, education. Unlimit-
ed visitation, visitation irom
1:00 A.M. 3:00 A.M., coedu-
cational llvmg arrangements,
are not in the best interests of
education. The college is de-
vised as primarily an institu-
tion of education — not learn-
ing how in live. i think we
can provide boys and girls
with better ways of learning
about each other, but not by
letting them play house."
When asked it he would turn
other violations in to the deans,
Steiner Said, “If I {eel that a
person is doing himselt dam-
age, others damage, or the col

lege damage. I will report him."

The Stu! has deiinite knowledge

that Steiner is personally aware
of at least three other visita-

tions and/or hours violations
that took place recently.
Early this week Steiner was
invited to explain his part in the
case to the members of James
Hall. Some of the girls present
expressed tear or talkin to a
laculty member or admi stra-
tor in a supposed “counselling
situation” about another student
in trouble, even if the student is
"obviously psychotic," w h e n
there are other people involved
that may become implicated.
The students said the chance of
suspension for innocent bystand-
ers is too much of a price to
pay-
,Atter the meeting at James
and atter a talk Tuesday or this
week with Knowlton and CoiHP
President Robert Foote about
Knowlton's part or guilt in the
case, Steiner told the 5&1?
Wednesday morning, “l am now
willing to concede that Frank
(Knowlton) did not know ~ (the
girl now on medical leave) was
sick.”

He went on to say, “I still
ﬁnd this incomprehensible
that the Committee would sus-
pend lhese students tor mere-
ly breaking the visitation rule.
I don’t really think I am ac-
cusing the Deans; i don’t
know What other evidence was
involved.“

At this interview Steiner told
the 5&3, “The Deans knew
there was someone else there
because of my advice." Steiner
added. “i am very worried
about the effect at this on coun»
seling and advising. How can i
ever again go to the Dean's oi—
iice on rule violations — if
someone else innocent is in»
Volved."

When asked about the sus-
pension ni Hanenherg and An-
derson Steiner said, “This is
a price that I‘m still willing
to pay to get help for — (the
girl). But this is an excessive
price to pay in my opinion.
The price is damn, damn,
high.”

The girl on “medical leave”
was taken out of class Monday
by Dean Low and Dean Thomp-
son and taken to a hospital in
Newton for “observation.” Her
father later came and took her
home. At this point it is thought
that Dean Thompson did not
know of the identity Elf Ander-
son, hut there has been specu~
lation that Dean Low found out
while taking the girl to New-
ton. The 5&3 has not yet been
able to verify this.

Hanenberg was called in to
talk with Dean Thompson Tues-
day and according to Hanen-
berg Thompson said, “i sup<
pose you know about this mess.

cause “too many people already

speculation that Thompson was
bluiiing lianenberg in claiming
to know the girl was Anderson.
it has been pointed out that be-
cause they had been dating tor
so long it would not be Very dif-
ticult to suspect that it Hanen-
berg had a girl in the apart-
ment it would have been Ander-
son.

Gordy MacAlplne, who lives
with Hanenberg and Knowlton,
Said Thompson Called him in at
about 1:30 PM. Tuesday and
asked him a lot of “ambiguous”
questions “as if Thompson
didn’t know anything about it."
MacAlpine said that Thompson
didn't ask him anything spe-
ciiic, “He just let me talk."
When asked by the 58:3 about
Hanenberg and Anderson, Mac-
Alpine said, “[ condone eliery-
thing they have done, because
it has been done in such a way
that It is not degrading to them
or to the caliber ol Grinnell
College students."

He added, “1 think the pen-
alty in this case was much Ion
severe. They are good stuv
dents, they enjoy studying.
they have inquiring minds and
they are serious people. i
don’t see any of them as be-
ing immature or escapist.”

The 5&3 has become aware
that Anderson's identity was
known to a number of people on
campus by Monday night. Han-
enberg and Knowlton went to
talk to Adelman in his room in
Cowles Monday evening. Dllr<
ing the conversation that fol~
lowed the name ‘Mimi” was
overheard by a member or
Cowles, but he told the 5&3
that he "didn't tell anyone
else."

Hanenberg later told the 5&3
that Adelman “promised sever
al times that he wouldn’t re-
port us." The 5&3 has been
able to find no evidence that
Adelman did not keep this
promise, Nord Brue, who knew
Anderson’s identity all along.
told the 5&3, “i think (the name
“Mimi") could have come out
in Dibble. Cowles or in Mimi’s
hall (Cleveland).” The 5&3 has
been aware of a rumor that An-
dersorl's identity “came through
a faculty member through a
student."

The Son attempted to talk
with the Deans indiVldually
about the case, and Dean Rich-
ard Winters and Dean Thompr
son, acting as spokesman tor
the Deans, reinsed to meet with
the 5&3 unless they Could all be

present at the same time. The
5&9 had individual appointo
ments with Winters, Thompson
and Low, which they cancelled
when they became aware or the
topic or discussion. As oi press
time the deans have not agreed
to talk individually with the
5&3 about their participation in
the case.

in a 5&3 interview with the
three suspended students last
Sunday, Anderson told the sap
(concerning her appearance be
fore the committee) “I was coin-
pletely open with the faculty
and deans, like you are in the
student courts, and i think this
was a mistake."

iianenberg said “The rule is
obviously intended to limit pie-
marltal intercourse". He added
"it is very hard to feel guilty
about violating a cultural lag.”
Anderson commented “Dean
Low wants us to go back and
change our morals to in the
rules.”

l-lanenberg was to have played
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto solo
in the orchestra concert tomor-
row night. As the situation
stands he will not be permitted
to do so and because of this
two members of the orchestra
have relused to periorm. Denis
tie Coleau, conductor oi the ore
chestra and chairman pt the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, said he would not bring
anyone else in to replace Han-
enberg, but the concert will
take place as planned.

Two Pioneers Get All-Conference

The Pioneer football team
placed two men on the second

Ripon, Lawrence, and st. Olaf.
Ripon had seven men on the
first team offensive and defen-
sive teams While St. Dial and
Lawrence had live each.

Coach Edd Bowers ot the Pio-
neers noted that there were
many highequality players in the
conference this year and so was
not surprised when only two

_® Pioneers made the elite teams.

He added that there was an
extra number of good backfield
men, :
“With only a 245 record and
no real outstanding player we
expected this," he concluded,

Coach Bower also had some
complimentary words tar his
team with regard to their per-

games. “Fnr [he ﬁrst time in
the year we were able to come
up with the big plays," he
noted. “Alter six straight losses

Bowers did express disap<

they should have been treated

Thornton Explores Relationship
Between Psychology and Religion

Psychological insights into the
nature oi religion were explored
by G. l... Thornton, psychology,
in a lecture and discussion last
Sunday night.

Thornton cited four essential
components or religion. These
are recognition of a superior,
controlling force; the percep-
tion or man as subject to this
power; a need to understand
and explain man's position rel-
ative to this force; and appeals
to this supernatural torce for
assistance. support and guid-
once.

He then traced the role of
psychology in explaining re-
iigion, beginning with John Wat-
son, who denied the psychologi-
cal value of consciousness, thus
separating psychology (mm re-
iiglon. The acceptance ol evolu-
tion eliminated psychology, as
well as biologyi as a way to
understand man as a religious
being, Freud treated religion as
neurosis, an explanation not
very well accepted in theologi-
cal circles.

Thornton indicated that his
thoughts would be those of a be-
haviorist psychologist, saying
that “methods. logic, techniques
and skills that have proved ei-
iective in explaining and undeb
standing many areas of human
behavior can also be applied
with no apologies to the area
or religious behavior." The psy—
chologist attempts to under-
stand and predict human beha—
vior which the individual per-
ceives as being religious, taking
as an essential premise the tact
that all religious behavior is
learned and that there is no in-
stinctive religious impulse.

Religious experience, worship
and prayer were the three areas
of religious behavior discussed.
In the first case, Thornton cited
instances of a supernatural be«
ing communicating with man,
or oi man experiencing visions
or, more appropriately, halluci-
nations. Saul’s experience of en-
countering an earthly manifes<
tation of the supernatural force
can he explained in terms oi the
physical stresses produced by a
period oi extreme heat which
has been known to cause per-
ceptual distortions. It is noted
that visions are always cultur-
ally relevant. What is halluci-
nated is some foml of what is
already known to the person.
For instance, the most devout
Hindu mystic has never con-
jured up a vision or the Blessed
Virgin. Thornton also mentioned
the use of LSD and other drugs
as producing psychologically
and physiologically similar re-
sults.

“Worship as an overt mani-
festation of religion provides the
individual with the feeling that
he is instrumental in‘ some
small way in controlling a pow-

ertiil force which is seen as
both destructive and benevo-
lent," said Thornton. “The
signs and trappings or his re-
ligious group are powertully re-
iniorcing in that they provide
a source of identity. The acts of
his religion reinlorce and
strengthen his commitment to
his particular religious group.”
Such acts initially were a re
sponse to [ear and anxiety. A
cause and effect relation was
established between the per-
forming of a certain act and
the termination at a ieariul phe-
nomenon, such as a hurricane.
Prayer operates in the same
way. “Petitiunary prayers pera
sist, not because they are ‘an-
swered,’ but because they have
value as a psychological device
to reduce anxiety, provide se-
curity, and give the individual
the impression he is doing
something.”

Debate on Viei Nam Policy:
Domino Theory vs Pluralism

Over the past two years a
raging controversy has swept
America concerning United
States policy in South Viet Nam.
Last Tuesday at the Forum’s
South Lounge this controversy
burst into the Grinnell spot.
light in a debate between
Joseph P. Kennedy and Steve
Shender on the question: Shall
We Stand in Viet Nam?

Kennedy, who supported ad-
ministrative policy, took the po-
sition that “the war in South
viet Nam does not represent an
isolated case of Communist sub-
version and that Communist
China presently constitutes a
serious threat to the peace and
security of Southeast Asia."

Shender, his opponent and
sell-proclaimed “member or the
misguided minority” maintain-
ed that "jusr because a nation
has a Communist government
does not mean it is necessarily
a puppet of Moscow or Peking,
and that while the tendency in

the Communist camp is toward
greater pluralism and dissollh
tron, we continue to posit the
existence of a monolithic Com»
munist bogey-man out to de-
stroy us all.”

To Shender the basic goals oi
our iorergn policy should be 1.
to encourage and promote an
international poliiical environ-
ment in which the Chinese will
feel free to alter their stance to
one of greater flexibility and
moderation, and 2. to promote
economic progress among the
peoples oi Southeast Asia.
Shendei‘ stated that “these goals
are not served by our present
policy which is based on a ra-
ther distorted and myopic ver~
Sion of reality.” He also assert-
ed his disbelief in the "domino
theory” and What he called
“oversimplified analogies be-
tween South Viet Nam and
Munich."

Sllender called for an oiier of
unconditional negotiations. ces-
sation of all bombing. cessation
of offensive military tactics, and
a commitment to disengage our
troops with the commencement
oi negotiations,

Kennedy, on the other hand,
stressed that “Man Tse Tung
has committed himself to the
policy that the best way to ex-
tend Communism throughout the
world is by means oi wars oi
national liberation; and that Ho
Chi Minh has stated that he
would like to lead National Lih«
elation Fronts in Thailand, Bur-
ma, Malaya, Cambodia, and
Laos." Kennedy also pointed to
the recent elections in South
Viet Nam in which 80% of the
registered voters “defied Com-
munist terror and elected a con-
stituent assembly. thus taking
a decisive step toward the even-
iual creation of a truly repre-
sentative South Vietnamese
government.

"In aiding the Ky military re-
gime we are resisting the at—
tempt ot Hanoi to take over
South Viet Nam by force of
arms; and we are attempting
to restore South Viet Nam to the
South Vietnamese people.”

speeches Mr; Charles Ransom,
