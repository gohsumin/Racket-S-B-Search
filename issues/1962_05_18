The court problem, part two

The first publicized meeting of the Scarlet and Black
editorial board was a success. .

Wednesday, twenty persons, including members of Grill-
nell’s tliree student courts and one faculty court advisor
talked into the open a number of snags in the student
tallied a number of snag-s in the student judicial system
iinto the open. ’

As the S & B suggested last week, a lnajor problem lies
in the fact thatprocedllre varies between the court ; that
a schedule of procedure has never been fully established so
that even the justices themselves are not always certain as
to “what happens next." And, in addition, it was agreed
that if the justices themselves are confused, the defendants
are often completely perplexed.

This frustration has resulted in hard feelings, charges‘

of injustice and a general feeling that the student court
system lies somewhere between Uncle Remus and Kalli;

This, of course, does not have to be the case, as the pro-
posals suggested at the Wednesday meeting indicate.

First, it was suggested that communication between the
courts and defendants be improved. A fllll description of
court procedure as it will be followed should be submitted
to each defendant with his notification to appear.

This procedure of course nicst first be standardized.
Perhaps, as High Court Chief Justice Jim Soble suggests
in an opinion handed down this week, it is not the
responsibility of the courts to establish procedure 7
this is a legislative function.

In refusing an appeal made on the grounds that the
prosecutor of the case was incorrectly appointed, Soble
says that “In the absence of any legislatively prescribed
method of governing appointment of this: post, the
specific manner by which the AWSB or CofHP selects
its official prosecutor is not open to question by the court.”

The above example is typical of the loopholes which exist
now in court operating procedure, loopholes which must be
ironed out by a committee of the Senate with advice from
court members.

A second suggestion made Wednesday was that the once
much discussed idea. of a student defender be exhumed.
Thrown out originally because it was thought by many
that the student defender function was not a necessary
one, that his presence would only bog; down the courts in
minutia, the idea now seems to be the best way of insur-
ing that each defendant is fully informed of his rights
before the court and is advised as what to expect from it.

Student defenders should be appointed on a permanent
yearly basis by the Senate. Besides seeing that justice is
done — something which cannot always be ensured when
looking at a case from a prosecutor's point of View or
even the point of view of an objective judge — the pre-
sence of a " lriend” in the court-room would make defende
ants feel that justice is being accomplished. And often
times this feeling is the thing which keeps 'I penalized
student from becoming overly bitter at his position.

The feeling here after such a meeting as \er'ednesday’s
is one of optimism, We think that the problems which
have existedjn Grinnell's courts can be overcome and that
an intelligent group of people justices, senators alld
other interested persons 7 will see them overcome soon

To the Editor:

ll is time we did away with the
infantile system of punishments
placed on Women for “hours"
violations. To say 12 pm. is a
good tilne to be in is different
from saying that if you are not
in you will be campused, The
first statement is a private at-
the second is an imposi-
tion which is neither mature
noi- trusting. The regulation
should be abolished.

Let it finally be admitted, we
need no drinking rule. Excess
can be excluded simply by im-
posing lines for pi'opcl‘ty dam-
age or disturbing lhe peace.

Though the rule remains in Iowa
law, it exists to be broken here.
Thcl‘cfore, lhci-e should be no
rule either stated or enforcd.
It should remain a problem in-
dlgcnous to the college. a prob—
lem for us to deal with as we
will,

Subjection to closed dorms,
open doors is an insult and
should be abolished. We should
be allowed privacy. The para-
noids who fear intercourse- will
be ignored, therefore their argu-
ments ought not to carry pres-
tige with us. Let us demand
open dorms and closed doors. It
copulation thrives, then let us
take measures, but only if we
feel the need.

The attitude prevalent in halls
that individuals should not do
what they think and say what
they feel is oppressive, Further,
that noise should prevail over
someone who wants to study is
perfectly ridiculous. Either the
right to study should be inVlol-v
able in a college: or we should
have no compunction abcul
smashing the noisy in their col-
lective faces.

Rules are the creations of
rulemakcrs. We have been given
the right to make oui~ own rules,
bul we have laid down our right
to make them Isn't it time to
