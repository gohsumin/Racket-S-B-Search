Trustees Increase Tuition $130;
Comprehensive Fee Now $2, 730

A 5130 increase in Grinnell’s‘
1966.67 tuition was agreed upon by
the Board of Trustees during a
meeting here last weekend.

The total rec paid by Grinnell
students next year will be $2,730.

in a letter sent to parents this
week, President Glenn Leggett ex-
plained that. “this increase in tui-
tion charges is directly related to
an expected increase or about
$225,000 in operating costs for
195676 .”

Dr. Leggett itemized the areas
in which more money needs to be
Spent next year:

“To keep raculty salaries at a
point where they are competi-
tive means that a particularly

heavy burden is placed on the
budget ior current operations

“in addition, it has been clear
to me since my arrival, and to
the deans and the faculty at
Grinneil for some time, that we
need to Improve our student per-
sonnel services, especially as
they relate to a more elicctivo
organization or the residence
halls.

“I am also persuaded that we
need to make additions to the
iaculty in certain departments.

Finally, like most of you, we
have to meet general inflation
in our costs."
in commenting on the fee in-
crease, Vico President Merritt

Ludwig said that additional fl-
nancial aid would have to be pro<
Vided students of modest means.
He said that the college has never
lelt an upperclassman financially
stranded.

Ludwig also said, “The iuturo
holds the likelihood of the con-
tinuing trend toward increased
lees; as this trend continues, one
hopes that government financtal
aid programs will help to bear a
major portion of these increases."

Concerning the recently enacted
bill to provide iederal money tor
student aid, Ludwig noted, “The
provisions are uncertain enough
that we have not been able to
evaluate iully their consequences."

The Fees 60 Up . . .

The tradition wasn’t broken this year, and students

returning to Grinnell next fall will be $130 closer to

reaching the magic $3,000

comprehensive fee (which

ought to be reached by 1969-70 if the present trends

continue) .

Last week we argued for a guaranteed compre—
hensive fee at Grinnell, a plan now in effect at three
Midwest Conference schools — St. Olaf, Coe, and Be-

loit.

The plan was discussed by the trustees, just as it

has been discussed for the

past several years, and re-

jected because the present system makes budget plan-

ning easier.

It has been suggested that guaranteed fees are of-
fered simply as selling points by some colleges and that
they offer no real advantage because students are then
paying according to four-year projected college costs,
instead of one-year projections.

But sometimes sales gimmicks have side advans
tages. The added advantage to guaranteed fees would be
a lessened chance of mass exodus which might other-
wise occur at schools insisting on reluctantly tacking on
many unpopular dollars to fees year after unending

year.

Carleton letter Creates Crisis:

'hgo Thro-

Tells Administration Where to Go

Up in the north woods, it’s open
season on college presidents.
President John Nason of Carleton
College, however, does not like to
be shot at

In a letter to the editor appear-
ing in the Carletonian of Oct. 28,
senior Jeff Long assailed Nason
and the Carleton administration
in general. He accused “Nason
and Co." of believing that "we
have not outgrown the stage where
we will be satisfied merely to be
told what makes boys different
irorn girls.”

Long expressed his feelings that
the college policy on discouraging
student sex is downright unrealis-
tic. “People are going to do it
anyway—even nice people. respon»
sible people, Christians. 4-H Club
members, and, yes, even Mary
apple pie sweetheart."

In a genuine crescendo of emo
tional outburst, Long addressed
these words to "Nason and Cor”!

“You force people to act like
dogs and then you punish them
for it. There’s something plenty
sick about that. . . .All we want
is to be able to live like normal
human beings. A person's sex
life is pure and simply none of
your damn business. So why don’t
you just leave people the hell
alone."

Long’s letter prompted a two-
hour meeting of the Board of Pub»
llshers in which the board discus-
sed the content of the letter and
Carletonian editor Pete Iverson's
responsibility in printing this let
ter.

Chemistry Professor Richard W.
Ramette’s motion to censure the
Carletonian tor publishing Long's
letter was defeated, and a motion
was tabled to exert pressure on
the newspaper to print an apology,

Ramette pointed to the letter as
being “particularly offensive,"

RIGHT
on THE

RIGHT

 

and charged that Iverson had OK~
nibited irresponsible icumalism,

In answering Ramette‘s char-
ges, lverson said that the paper
was printed primarily for an ona
campus audience, and that it was
not used, as Ramette charged, as
a “destructive tool."

The Carletonlan was besieged
with letters, some favorable to
Long, most uniavorable to the
manner in which he voiced his
objections.

One student in particular seeni~
ed to grasp the issue at hand:

”Obviously, Carleton is not a
democratic society. The adminis<
[ration can’t leave us the hell
alone. . . .There is a great need
tor personal relationships with the
opposite sex, and these cannot be
policed without destroying almost
all personal freedom, . .There is
a need. I hope the administratiou
will recognize it, and contend
with it fairly and realistically."

As for Mr. Long, he is now on
social probation. A hard blow,
but that's the way things happen
in Paul Bunyan country.

l almost hate to suggest it. but the
good sergeant seems to have ac-
quired some assumptions that he
cannotpereeivc and examine, some
inhibitions that prevent his con-
sidering anything but his own
limited viewpoint.

Look at his language tor the
elites, The military is a “family“
to him Does this suggest some-
thing? Why eannot this man ques-
tion his government7 He says it
never even occurred to him to do
so. But, further, he feels that to
protest is “Lo prostitute my pro.
fession," We all have our sex
problems; we all sublimate, etc.
But the sergeant lets his prob.
lems (whatever their cause)
interiere with his perceptions of
his own behavior, and, unable to
understand himselt, he cannot un-
derstand others.

He says (ior example) that the
war in Viet Nam is essential, The
people there live in degradation
and ignorance. The 11.5. must save
them. Yet, no matter how appar-
ently true these sentiments, when
he cites as an example of their
degradation the prostitution of the
widow ot a Vietnamese army pri-
vate, he must lose most at his case,
for he surely must realize that this
poor woman would not be a widow
it there had been no widespread
war and that she vei-y probably is
selling herself to some good Ameri
can “Joe" just like the sergeant;
hﬁit, somehow, he does not realize
t is.

when the sergeant was iaeed,
too, by the tin box or a dead
soldier and he was tilled with pity
and prayer, why did he then turn
to anger and shame at those who
sympathize with him? Why does
he react so vehemently against
those who hope to end all needless
carnage and those who want at
least to find the human justifica-
tion tor our participation in a war
so remutei He could have said, in-
stead, "Although I am a soldier. 1
hate this war. 1 will not light in it."

Every man is at the command oi
only his own conscience, but the
sergeant has “ideals and princi-
ples" those unexamined as.

Lecturer Amstutz Gives Talk
About Sickness, Evil, Theology

Jakob Amstutz, Swiss prolessol-
and theologian now a visiting prtr
tessor at Pittsburg University, lec-
tured to a near-capacity audi-
ence in Roberts Theatre last
Thursday, Nov. 4. In the first ape
peat-ance or his 4—day visit, Am-
htutl dealt with the subject “Sick-
ness. Evil, and Theology," based
on the works or Sartre, Camus,
Ind Kafka.

According to Amstutz, a great
deal of modern literature, exem-
pliiied by that DI the three au-
thors above, is “toxic" literature,
dealing with sickness and evil as
major themes. He admitted that
this type of literature had always
been with us, citing authors such
as Goethe, Rilke and Peer He
reels, however, that these early
examples were mainly unpremed.
itated explosions of intensity and
emotion, otten serving a cathartic
purpose tor the author. in con-
trasr. the last 25 years have seen
an increase in the “number and
crudeness of descriptions of sick-
ness and evil. . ,," and this “down-
ward pointing" literature seems
to be "conscious and systematic. .

.carelully constructed portrayals
or catastrophe."

He described the sickness por-
trayed in these works as a “lack
of inner control of man over him-
self. . 4" either a lack of moral
strength or a strength that con-
sists of perversion.

Evil is defined as any external
compulsion which degrades and
dehumanizes man. This may be
animalization, machinery, or an
evil person or persons

Amstutz felt this “toxic" or
“black" literature causes three
slcknesses among those who are
not trained to read it correctly,
The first is snobhishness: the cre-
ation of virtue from necessity, the
pride in pessimism as a sign of
intelligence. The defeatist has
much the same attitude as the
snob, but lacks his sense of virtue
and is left with nothing but a tech

ing of ”, . .tl'le senselessness of
opposing it."

The third sickness is a theologi-
cal one, employing black litera-
ture as support tor the view or
man's weakness and evil, and his
complete dependance on the grace
or God. This leads to rigid dogma

Phi Beta Kappa Lecturer Compares
Arthurian Legends and ‘Beasi Epics'

Professor W. T. Hr Jackson of
Columbia University spoke on
Thursday, NWT 4, at the annual
Phi Beta Kappa lecture. Jackson
spoke on the topic “Shining
Knights and VFiltby Beasts,” two
views or medieval society.

In his analysis of medieval lit-
erature, Jackson dlﬂerentiated be-
tween the two major schools of

medieval literature, the Arthurian
romance and the “beast epic."
The latter school refers to a series
or stories in which animals take
on h u m a n characteristics Al-
though the Arthurian romances
with their myths have endured, the
beast-epic presents a more realis<
tic picture of medieval society,
according to Jackson.

Freshman Grid Team Shows
Potential For Future Years

By DAVID SKINNER

This 1965 Grinnell freshman
football team should provide a
fine nucleus to replace the ll
graduating seniors from this
year's varsity, according to fresh-
man coach John Pfitsch. He sees
them as doing better than replac-
ing the current senior crop, by
potentially raising a shade the
quality or the varsity team. The
freshmen ﬁnished with a l-l WC-
am this season,

The potential of the 13 firsHeam
treshman gridders is better than
average ior a Grinnell firstayear
squad, and at least three others
should be able to achieve varsity
caliber with experience. The male
jar problem is size, for the entire
team is quite small.

Backs Tom Lower. Dun Krait—
sik. and Roger Bryant, and tackle
Bob Lillis are the men with the
greatest potential, but they are
backed up by an extremely tal-
ented learn oi varsity candidates.

because or their lack of size.

At tackle are Bob Campbell (175
lbs.) and Lillis (190 lbs.). Both
have adequate size and will surely
play next season: Campbell is
quite rugged, and Lillis is smart,
a good hitter, tough, and agile.
Ptitsch calls Llllls ”one of the
best. linemen I have ever seen on
a Grinnell freshman team. He
should be an outstanding Midwest
Conference rootbell player. Llllis
will probably be converted into a
guard next year.

Five members of the freshman
backﬁeld should play varsity ball.
The quarterback is 6' 3” Lower.

Last Saturday the Pioneers

into several disastrous mistakes
that led to Pioneer scores, [Joe

tory only twice in the first half,
both times in the second quarter-
after the Pioneers had a 144) lead.
Pioneer punter Dick Musser, who
averaged 47 yards in his four
punts, consistently forced the Ko-
hawks to start their offensive
drives deep in their own territory.
i-lis four punts ended up, respec-
tively, at the Kohawk la, 28, lo,
