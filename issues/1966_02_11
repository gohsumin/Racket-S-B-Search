Committee [lotion
Found Acceptable

Acceptance of the proposals on
Senate reorganization Wednesday
evening brought a tentative halt
to recent Senate preoccupation
ivith structure and purpose.

Proposals from the committee
on reorganization, Chaired by Dan
Bucks, provided for a return to
the old system with two senators
from all residence halls with be-
tween 31 and 70 members, three
from larger halls and one irom
smaller halls. The amendments
provide for rules and hail regula-
tions changes to originate only in
joint meetings of the aws board
and the c oi HP, subject to ap-
proval by the Senate. They also
restore the office of Speaker of
the Senate, to be nominated by
SGA president and elected by a
majority vote or the Senate. Ad-

‘ dltiohal nominations require a sec-
ond from onethird of tile Senate,

Bucks said that his committee's
plan “divides the efforts of stu-
dent government and gives to those
respective groups the responsibility
which in st concerns them.” The
respoiis‘ 'y ior rule changes is
placed with the house presidents,
while the Senate takes Care of
student services. Bucks described
this apparent weakening oi the

to the committee’s proposals was
deieated by the Senate. Drawn up
by Bob Barrow and John Black,
the amendments gave the Senate

the power to initiate rule changes,
included house presidents in the
voting body or the Senate, and
allowed the C of HP and AWS to
meet separately. Tlle Bucks pro-
posals require joint meetings.

In presenting his amendments
to the amendments, Black com-
merited “I decided to indulge in
the game we’ve all been playing
of constitution writing.”

Bucks defended his committee's
division oi power, saying “it is
my opinion that house presidents
have been here tour years and
are informed. Nonetheless house
presidenis’ primary concern is in
the rules area.” Bucks stressed
the importance or having each
branch deal with that area which
most directly concerns it.

Dick Chady differed with the
committee’s change in the Sen-
ate’s structure. “The only argu-
ment you've presented is one tor
wider participation. The arguments
we have over structure are large-
ly irrelevant, I have yet to he
convinced that we do need a

Freshman ﬁuspendcd
0n Visitation Giordes

By Bob Hotlierlle

A Read freshman woman
was suspended from school
for the remainder of the aca-

demic year this week by the
Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs.

The suspension came Tues-
day after a meeting of the
Faculty Committee The wom-
an told the 5&3 Thursday
that She has not and will not
appeal the decision.

The Suspension of the wom<
an follows last week’s sus
pension of a Smith sopho~
more man. The man was SuS<
pended when he was found in
his room with a woman by in
Buildings and Grounds elec-
tl‘ician.

Gains 0K By Faculty

Approval of the 1966-67 academ-
ic calendar was the major con-
sideratinn at last Monday's facul—
ty meeting.

The new calendar will have one
signiticnnt change: a four - day
mid . semester break in early No-
vember, one day more than this
year’s.

Dean James H. Stauss, who

. chaired the meeting, declined to
comment on the rest of the agen-
da.

legcs that the woman sus-
pended is the one who was in
the mall’s room.

The man did not at any
time identify the woman to
the committee. The woman
does not admit to being in-
volved in the incident. It is
the feeling of friends of the
students that the committee
and the deans acted upon
supposition and circumstan-
tial evidence only in suspend-
ing the woman.

The Scarlet and Black
asked the chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs, John Burma
(sociology), and the various
deans upon what they based
their identification of the
woman Suspended. All re-
fused to comment ill any way.

In the past it has been the
policy of the Faculty Conl-
nlittee and the (leans not to
comment or give justifica-
tion for suspensions.

Petitions for SGA president are
due in at 4:30 pm today. As or

Jerry Goddard indicated that no

Goddard said the deadline would

Controversy Over Privacy Continues
As Shender Defends forum Planning

To the Etlitar:

I must lake issue with one h‘
peel of Miss Kirschner's letter 01
January 28. 1 am very sorry to
see that Forumhuitingis becomr
ing a new college pastime _ e
pecially when I recall the eagei-
ncbs with which we watched the
Forum tzlko shape in ~Elli-'64, and
the excitement With which we
pressed our noses to the glass a
year ago last tall. it seems ironic
that, once inside, we Wish we
could be solllelvhel'e else. In any
case, Miss Kirschner (through no
fault 01 her own) was not here
then, and cannot but fail to per-
curve the Irony of the general 5
uation or retlcct upon the impli-
cations it otters as to the general
nature of mail. So to be fair to
her, 1 must limit myself to come
menting on the obvious ﬂaws ot
her own reasoning.

To begin with, 1 not greatly up
set by the aspcrsions which have
been cast on the intentions oi lhs
archilect, Netsch Miss Kirschller
writes, ”This sounds like ii coallr
tion of administration and archir
lect against the student's need for
a certain degree ot privacy , .
Netsch is certainly no dolt when
it comes to college architecture.
After all, he has to his Credit Bur-
ling Library, and the Fine Arts
Center, not to mention the Air
Force Academy chapel and the
entire University of Illinms Chi-
cago Cimle campus. It Netsch has
designed the Forum as he has, it
is because he has certain concopr
tions as to what purposes and
goals ii small liberal arts college
such as Gl'inllell is aiming toward.
and a general scheme as to how
to help the college achieve these
ends, as much as possible, through
the mechanics of design. I serious-
ly doubt that he acted as a Bill'-
ling Basement. stooget

Secondly, l am alraid that the
cry ot “No privacyl" is one which
is t-oiecd by people who would not
be happy unless they were com-
plaining about something, and
that the rest of us have hardly
noticed the “defect" After all. do
you suppose the people ot the
TV room really care it they are
hoiiig watched by the people in
the North Lounge? Is it possible
that the even notice when they
are eng ed in the tuner And
does any no seriously believe
that the people in the North
Lounge mind being hatched by

cause they want t’l) be seen? And
the people in the game room 7
do they care it the wallilowers

really so private going on in the

who is more embarrassed — the

people entwined around each

other on the ﬂoor oi the South

Lounge each night at l .45, or the

people ogllng them from the CM-

t'ee shop and the music room?

Perhap ltliss Kil'schller has ittit‘
really amined both sides at the

question.

Miss Kirschncr writes of the
South Lounge, “ anyone who
talks above a whisper or so much
as plays an arpeggio is booed out
by the people who have taken
over the South Lounge as a study
center." Perhaps we should erect
a sign which states-

THIS LOUNGE
FOR AUDIBLE CONVERSATION
(15-75 DECIBELS)

AND ARPEGGIOS ONLY
But then wouldn’t we be defeating
the goal of ireedom in the liberal
arts community? Atter all, it the
South Lounge is tor quiet media

students, and what is so wrong
with that? We have made it what

or the grill, the authoress says,
“My idea or a place to relax and
meet my irlends is not a restallr
rant.” In reply, there is no law
which says you must stay in the
grill to talk; there is always the
TV room, the North Lounge, and
heaven tor d, the music room or
the Coffee :ihup.

In conclusion. it appears that
hliss Kirschner has lost sight or,
or denies, the real purpose oi the
Forum in the context of the col-
lege community. Of course the
Forum was not designed for pi-i.
racy (although it attords a re
markable amount of it in spite

as a place nhere people could hide
from each other. They can do that
in their rooms. The Forum has
designed as a meeting place. as

“There are a lot of Antioclnans

many campuses have been exam-

of handling such cases individual-

Ex-Prol Talks on Social Analysis

Protessor Muni Frumhartz, lor-
merly oi the sociology and anthro
pology department here at Grinr
Hell, and now at Carleton Univer-
sity in Ottawa, Canada, lectured
Monday night on “The Role of
Comparative Analysis in the So-
ctal Sciences." There was some
contusion at the beginning as to
what was going to be discussed.
and in attempting to get it cleared
up, everyone got more contused.

Once things were straightened
out, Professor Frumhartz exA
plained the process or compara-
live analysis, from the viewpoint
of the social scientist, as the use
or the logic or experimentation
Without the actual physical act. He
stated that since it is impossible
to create cultures containing a set
number of variables, one must at-
tempt tn find existing societies, or
societies that have existed in the
past, with a large number ot sim-
ilarities. In this way, the reasons
for their differences may be de-
duced. The major dilficlllty in
pertorming what the protessor
called “intellectual or mental ex-
periments" lies in finding these
alternate SDCieties.

Professor Frumhartz went on to
note that while the United States
is the nation that is most ad-
vanced in social science technique
and. as a result the most thor-

points would help us understand

‘Square and Circle Are Alike

From Topological Viewpoinl‘

By MARY MALCOLM

Paul G Kuntz (philosophy) has
spent years now in a Search for
a geomemc object satislying both
the definition of a Circle and that
of a square—the squirkle.

Mix Kilntz. rejoice! Your Search
is over. The problem with philosor
pliers is that they look for ans
swets which are diﬂiclllt if not
impossible to find in philosophy,
when they could easily be ioiinti
in other fields, This according to
Dr. Steve Armentroui of the Uni-
versity oi Iowa who spoke Tiles-
day in the science lecture room.
Topologically seen, there is abso-
lutely no difference between a
circle and a square (both are 1-
spheres). or for that matter be
tween a sphere and a cube.

Kuntz and colleagues may are
gue that the topological viewpoint
is a somewhat technical one. Nev-
ertheless. when dealing with squir-
kles and their huge philosophical
implications, it must he rememe

 

bered that everything is point of
view.

Armenii’out's talk posed the
question of deﬁning the arsphere,
based on an attempt to under
stand geometry and analysis in
Le rm 5 of four dimensions. He
pointed out that this problem and
attempts to verify or disprove
Polncare’s conjecture (a tentative
theorem dealing with the 3.
sphere) have occupied the world's
outstanding topologists for 15
years,

Once you get into higher dimenr
sions, beyond four. there is no dif»
iiciilty in classilying objects. The
difficulty seems to lie entirely in
that loutth dimension, too compli-
cated to picture, too simple to
generalize

Topology is a branch of mathe-
matics which attempts to cone
late analysis and geometry. its
major contribution to the ﬁeld as
a whole is in strengthening the
iounolations at these other branch-
es.

Grappiers Drop Heuribreuker
After Splitting Weekend Bill

The Pioneer grapplers came
within a shade or defeating Cor-
nell Wednesday night when Ray
Mendel, normally a 152 pounder,
just missed pinning his opponent in
the heavyweight division. The win
that Ray picked up left the Pio-
neers one short of Cornell 20-19.
The Pioneers actually won one
more match than the Rams. but
two Cornell pins gave them the
victory. Others besides Mendel to
win were hill Barnes, Ken Strun—
ler, John Sharpe. and Bob Geller.
Joel Richman and Gary Wilson
tied their matches

The wrestlers also split last
weekend, losing to Upper Iowa. 14-
17. and healing Simpson, 19-16.
Winning tor Grinnell against Up-
per Iowa were Barnes, Strubier,
Sharpe, and Louis Kelley; Sharpe
won by detault after leading in the
ﬁrst period. Kelley had the best
match or this meet, heating his op-
ponent who had taken 2nd place at
the Knox Invitational last semes-
ter.

Barnes. Strubict. Sharpe, and
Kelley also won against Simpson
with Stmhler collecting the only
(all. Kelley. however. wrestled an
exhibition match. Grinnell’s other
winner against Simpson was Ray
Mendeli Gary Wilson, who would
have given a victory for Pioneers
against Upper Iowa had he wrestl—
ed, was sidelined with an eye in-
jury, Ken Augustine, however,
suffered a recurring injury from
football and will miss the rest of

 

the season, again iorcing Grinnell
to forfeit the heavyweight divis—
ion.

Last Friday the Grinnell ireshr
men wrestled against Knox at
Galesburg. A running score was
not kept because of weight dis-
crepancy; each of the four who
went also wrestled twice. Kerry
Park at 160 won both of his
matches by pins, The other three
who wrestled were Cliff Frolilich
(145), Mike Grove (Its-123), and
Kent Hampton (152): Frohlich
split tor the day, and Grove had
one draw. Randy Stare, the
ireshmen's only winner against
the Luther frosh, Jan, 22, was
sidelined with a knee injury as
was Paul Bradley. Don Kraitsik,
who won two matches - losing
none — at the Freshmen Knox
Invitation last December, was also
sidelined and will be out for the
rest of Lite season.

Tomorrow the grapplers wrestle
at Goa in a quadrangular with
Luther again, a tough Augustana
team, and Coe.

Student Voices Questions

lTo the Editor:
, why did one halt of Grinnell’s
lpernianent coaching statt resign
.within a week?

Are steps being taken to secure
lnren of equal talent and expe
ience to fill these positions or will
inexperienced assistants be given
head coach positions as in the
past in wrestling and baseball?
