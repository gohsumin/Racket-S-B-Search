ALTERNATING DORMS. N0 OPENS, SAYS LEGGETT

By ANDY ISAACS

' President Leggeti s u n d a y
night asked the college commu-
nity to consider the possibility
of a south campus of under-
class men and Women and a
similar north campus of upper-
class men and women, and of
giving upperclass students the
choice between living on com-
pus, subject to college social
regulations, or living on cam-
pus under the jurisdiction of
their landlord and the city.

The president invited “order-
ly study and response to my
suggestions for possible
Bhange” and called for other
proposals from both students
and faculty. He expressed hope
that he could present ﬁnal rec-
ommendations to the trustees
by early Spring, and begin a
new arrangement by next Fall.

Leggett noted three salient
aiiiiculties with the present
system:

(1) There is no provision for
a progressive withdrawal oi
college authority as students

advance through their under-
graduate years.

(2) The separation of men
and Women onto different cam-
puses inhibits natural and easy
meeting oi the sexes.

(3) Most students are forced
into one inflexible style of liv-
ing.

He suggested that, should his
proposal be adopted, the col-
lege recognize irankly that un-
derclass residence halls would
have more supervision than up-
perclass halls, and that lt follow
a conscious policy of permitting
more upperclass students to
live off campus.

Leggett noted of his sugges-
tion “These are only notions,
but they may introduce us to
ways we can create an envi-
ronment that 1 its the Col«
lege’s responsibility to what it
can actually be responsible for
and gives sludents not simply
the option of staying here or
leaving but the several options
oi living in diiierentiy organ-
ized residence halls under var—
ious college regulations or olf

the campus and away from in-
stitutional social sanctions com-
pletely."

The president made clear
that he opposes the extension of
open rooms now as strongly as
ever, ”I do not believe in the
extension of ‘open rooms,’ and
some of the reasons for my be
lief are in line with my dissat-
lsiaction with the hall system
in general. A program of coedu-
cational use of dormitory rooms
emphasizes the single way of
living already imposed unfortu-
nately here on most students.
At the same time it gives rise
to social expectations and con-
frontations that not all student!
are prepared to meet and se-
riously interferes with the Col-
lege's responsibilities tor the
mental health of all students.

“institutional restrictions of
coeducational use of dormitory
rooms are designed to help pre-
salve the emotional sensibilities
of all Students, not to instruct
individual students in what
choices they should make in
their out-ofecollege life. In spite

of the dissatisfaction of the pro—
ponents of ‘sexual ireedom,’
(quotes his) the College is in
no position to condone such ex-
pression of freedom in the con~
text of dormllory living, and it
sees no hypocrisy in saying so."

Further expressing his dissat-
isfaction with Grinnell’s style of
living. “This is a very unsimpls
subject; it is really a cluster
oi problems, chiei among which
are two Circumstances I think
all of us find profoundly frus-
trating: first, a hall govern-
mental system whose elected
officials are often caught in the
dilemma oi choosing between a
loyalty to their constituents and
loyalty to their responsibilitieSI
and, second, at least on north
campus an almost totally in-
flexible structure of living alld
eating and talking, irorn onn
identically - organized residence
hall to the next, so that (except
tor the small option ot offecam-
pus living) any real choice
about the way a person wishes
to live is denied to him unless
he is inclined to force himself

‘ CAMP-IN BRAVES GOLD

Last Saturday night, Grinnell
had a non - social - calendar
event. The event was billed as
A “Camp-Out," and students

ere attracted by such signs as
‘Bring your own bolt". The idea
was originated by Gates sopho-
more Tom Th 0 m a 5, who
thought that the idea was ull~
feasible at the time.

The idea came to the attena
tion at the presidents oi Gates
and Rawson, Steve MacDuwell
and Mel Thompson, wllo
thought it might be a good
Idea.

They brought it to the atten-
tion of Miss Dentel, program
director of the College, who al-
so thought it was a good idea.
The C. of HP. agreed, although
some members of the Council
privately expressed the opinion
that it might cause trouble.

Machwell and Thompson re-
alized that the event would
have to occur within a very
short time, before the weather
became cold. After iniomiiug
Dean Thompson and receiving
no objection irom him, the two
presidents proceeded w i t h
plans.

About a week before the
“Camp - Out," announcements
appeared, which Gates Presi-
dent Thompson, looking back,
described as “gross."

Shortly before the “Camp-
Out,” the two presidents
were informed that the
College could not place the e«
vent on the official calendar,
nor could it support the event
in any way with College equip«
meni.

Explaining the situation at-

SGA HEARS RAWSON’S HORN

By PAUL NACHMAN
Ray Horn's presentation oi a
concrete proposal for an open
dorms extension and a re-
quired “Human Values" course
for freshman highlighted Wed<
nesday’s Senate meeting.
Drawn up by an unoiiicial
committee in Rawson that has
been meeting regularly for a
week, the paper calls for noon
to midnight opens on Sunday
through Friday and noon to 1
am. on Saturday.
The committee further sug-

plained that the College would
never have allowed the “Camp-
Out" to occur, had it realized
exactly what was planned. He
admitted the administration
was to blame in not determin-
ing sooner what was planned.
He said the College “can’t sup-
port all night activities", fur-
ther stating that to some peo-
ple, it “had an overtone of so—
cial rules involvement."

Other objections were noise
from the band, and the in-
volvement or all of North Cam-
pus, whether other halls wished
to participate or not.

According to Dean Thomp-
son, the same type of event will
not occur again,

The occasion was attended
by a maximum of about two
hundred people at its high point
at twelve o’clock.

From then on, despite a roar-
ing bonfire in the mlddle of
Mac Field, and movies which
showed until two in the morn-
ing, the cold drove most of the
participants away.

At dawn, when the outing
ended, only five couples were
left to gather around the dying
fire.

gests that, “Each hall may re-
strict these hours as it sees ﬁt,
with the stipulation that at
least 3 hours per day be re-
tained."

Criticized for the limited
scope of the committee’s pro-
posal, Horn responded, “We re<
alized we weren't covering all
the problems, but nobody else
on campus did anything on
this We did It’s something.”

”This is the first concrete
proposal regarding open dorms
to go through student govern-
mental channels since 1962,”
he explained “Once it has been
sent out to the student body,
we’ll have some facts and fig-
ures to talk about. We’ll get
some real numbers for a
change."

Actual figures, Horn noted,
will force the administration to
be more speciiic than they
have been previously about no
jections they may have to in-
creased opens. In the past, he
explained, the deans have cited
other schools' unhappy experi-
ences with liberalized rules but
have produced no specific,
written evidence to support
their contentions.

The statement's p r e f a c 9
reads, in part: “Only the dy-
namics of decision, not the
shelter of a protective wing
will allow, and, yes, in some
cases force, students to develop
their own indivldualityr The

mature individuals can spring

on others and be aggressive
about his “rights.” Concrete in-
stances of such aggressiveness
are excessive noise-making,
bravado drinking, and brazen
illegal visiting that other stu-
dents had better accept or else.
We might list many more aux-
iliary problems connected with
our style of living, but these
are enough. in the face of such
diiilculties the fact is remark-
able that Gtinnell Student!

noted, that he first heard stu.

dence hall life, especially all
north campus. “That life, ac-
cording to what I heard, was
noisy, vulgar, and academical-
ly debilitating." South cam-
pus was more gracious, but
still so conditioned by north
that it was unsatisiactory. The
experience of the first encamp-
ment persuaded me that the
residence system here was in-
terfering with the success of
the academic program."
North campus appeared al-
most united in its opposition to
any change in the system, and
a special student-faculty com.
mittee recommended ll t t l a
change when it filed its report.
Leggett said that he swal-
lowed his disappointment, feel.
ing encouraged that, in view
of what looked like a working
system at communication be-
tween student leaders and the
administration, the residence
system might be made to work.
The president was “ecstatic"
about the possibilities oi prog.
ress in 1966 atter an encamp-
ment devoted almost exclusives
ly to academic topics. He was
very disappointed in the special
encampment issue of the 5&3.
which covered primarily worri-
en’s hours and open rooms.
Leggett said that these topics
had received only incidental
attention at the encampment.
Leggett felt that the sleep-in
of last November temporarily
destroyed the communications
system that so many thoughl
had been established. He sug-
gested that “There were two
lessons which . . . students
might have learned. First. the!
student actlon is as liable to
misinterpretation by the public
press as that of administrators“
and Second, that though the Col.
lege cannot control threats to
its institutional integrity, it will

LEGGETT’S SPEECH

We waited for two years for President Leggett to make a
definitive statement on student liie. Sunday at the open Senate
meeting the president ended the waiting with a lengthy and broad-
based commentary on campus living.

Immediate student reaction must be favorable. Students who
are willing to work within established channels to discuss the prolr
items oi Grinnell will know the president’s position on Various
matters. Students who real that the college is moving too slowly
toward rule liberalization can make reaction to the president’s
more conservative ideas a rallying cry for revolutiolL And students
who are merely curious to know What our Chief administrator has
to say about campus life are rewarded with a colorful speech.

The prospect of having men and women on both campuses
meets with our approval. It would be a first step in the alleviation
of the inhibitions on this campus about informal coeducational ac»
tivity, and would further more relaxed relationships between the
sexes.

The idea of separating students by class, however, is iii~con«
ceivedi Although class dorms would keep upperclassmen lrom im-
posing sophomoric and anti-intellectual customs on Ireshmen, they
would also prohibit the natural contact between newcomers and
more experienced students that leads to academic and social
guidance and inspiration,

Living in a freshman dorm with upperclass advisors could be
likened to New Student Days, when entering students, although
glad to have ii lew days of their own on campus, and group leaders
to help them get settled, are anxious to see what college life is
really like. Granted, upperclnssmen might be the advisors. but
the student taking the job will, by Virtue of his position, be diner-
cnt from other upperclassmeu. The naturalness of relationships
between the sexes which is sought in mixing the campuses would
be lost between the classes with separate class dormsi

Our greatest dissatisfaction is with President Leggett’s position
on open dorms. Restrictions imposed by the car rule and by lowa
weather leave the dormitory room as the only place ior coeduca-
tional privacy, or course, the study rooms and dining rooms of
the Forum are available, but the “transparent” curtains and ster-
ile decor make them unappealing. And dining rooms must be re-
served in advance, destroying the spontaneity and casualness that
is supposedly being sought in campus social life.

It seems that most of the damage to the “ motional sensibili~
ties" or students witnessing “brazen illegal vi ting” is a result
of the conflict between reasonable action and college rules, rather
than the questioning of the action. If open dorm hours were ex-
tended greatly (granted there must be limits imposed by our pres-
ent residence hall pattern of two students per room), it is our con-
lention that visiting would become more natural and intormnl,
that it would involve groups rather than just couples, that the
clandestine sexual overtones would be diminished, and that its
acceptance by non-participating hall members would be without.
reasonable objectioni

Hopefully, the president’s speech will also remind pepople that
changes need not be iorever in the planning stages. Leggeit wants
to implement some DI the changes next Fall. II we Want to have
a voice in these changes, we must act now. Encampment would be
a logical place for discussions within the college community to
Start. The Student Aflalrs committee will be Considering the
changes and making recommendations. if we have sometllilliz to
say about the way we live, or it we feel we ought to have more
day, now in the time to speak up.

EQUALITY
OF THE SEXES

To the Editor:

A certain amount of flexibil-
ity is desirable, but inconsis-
tencies in a legal system ought
to be avoided. The school has
partially eliminated the double
standard by its withdrawal of
women’s hours, but one Can<
not say that tlt school has
adopted as its oifi a] policy the
equality oi the sexes.

The greatest inequality of
which I am aware is in the
p h y sic a1 education require
ments. Men are required to
take both intramural competi-
tion and a terrifying course in
physical fitness, requirements
that do not exist for iemale
students.

if Grinneil College wishes to
appear as a truly just institu-
tion, it will have to discontinue
this inconsistency either by the
elimination of the requirements
for men. their imposition upon
the women, or the reinstltutlon
of women’s hours.

CROSSETT
ON GSM

To the Editor:

When I first read page one of
last week’s 5&3, I assumed
that the headline “Amnlphous
Group Plans Movement" was
merely another specimen of the
lovely illiteracy which students
oiten turnish to amused faculty
members. Alter all, a group is,
by deﬁnition, that which has
form; “amorphous" denotes
that which is Without form.

As I read further, however, I
began to see that the illiteracy
was only a symptom of the
confusion -— to use no stronger
a term — which underlay the
purposes of the GSM (Grinnell
Student Movement). One can-
not tell whether to attribute to
the newspaper’s grammatical
incompetence or to the GSM’!
own irrationality the statement
of Ronald Steinhom’s purpose:
“ ‘We a re trying to work
through official channels now'
to show the campus that noth—
ing will be accomplished this
way."

Any doubts, however, are
cleared up by the remarks or
Michael Penzner, who “elab-
orated" ~ as the 5&8 elegantly
puts it ~— the position held by
Messrs. Thor and Steinhoru.
“As soon as we get an explicit
refusal from the deans," Mr.
Penzner says, “we have a rally
point and can have a revolu-
tion.” Observe the honorable
and manly way in which the
speaker has made up his mind
in advance. Notice the gieeiui
determination with which he
expects — nay, even anticipates
— a “refusal from the cleans.”
As soon as the reiusal comes,
“we can have a revolution.” I
like that idiom “mye a revolue
tioii”; it‘s sort of like a party,
it real "blast”.

Mny 1 close by saying that I
run particularly amused by the
notion oi an “iiniletgrouiit”
newspaper which publicly nit-
nollnces its existence, ltcli _,
and editorial stall? Those soli-
styled revolutionaries do not;

THE MGlIllTAIN OR
THE llALE

By PAUL JONES

There is a great deal of difference between being called wrong
and being proved wrong. This is the conclusion to which I came
after studying Ron Steinhorn's student opinion in last week’s
son. Rather than merely call him wrong in tum, 1 am willing to
continue the needed discussion by attempting to prove his analysis
of ‘rule philosophy’ to be lacking in many respects, and unjustifi-
able in others

At the same time that I may not be cognizant of the justiﬁca-
tion and objectives of social reiorm, steinhorn and many others
are also not cognizant oi the means, i.e., the means from justltica<
tion to objectives. And it one does not know how to get where he
wishes to go, how can he know exactly where he will end up?

The fact or the matter is that my point of view was directed
primarily at means, not justiiication or objectives. If i did not
reel that there were both justification and proper objectives, I
would say so i, too, admit that the administration has not pm

duced a po on based on reasoned right, but, wrongly, one on
authoritarian right.

But again, let us not bypass the chance to extract this reas
soned right it at all possible. And the proper objectives are obvi-
ous: to achieve a reasoned balance of thought and action among
all of the par . oi the community. Is there not, then, a dliierencs
between having the naivete to ask for and want, and having the
naivete to expect, a statement of policy? For there are many,
instances when reason has been mistaken for naivete.

Again, there seems to be little emphasis placed on developing
reasoned means; which is it to be: principles before rules or rules
before principles? That the administration's 'actions seem to be
expedient’ on the basis oi ‘sporadic and inconsistent’ rule en.
iorcement is not proof that the administration cannot effectively
enforce rules, or indeed, that they do not have the right to one
force miles; but, rather, this proves only that their actions do not
seem to be based on principles. it is not that these actions are
necessarily immoral or unethical, but that they seem to be amoral
0r non-ethical.

It is a blatant error to equate Rousseau’s concept or ‘gov-
ernment’ with the ‘academlc community’. it is one extreme to
Say that Grinnell is not the real world, for it certainly is real; but
it is another and just as damnable extreme to say that the makeup
of this community is identical with every other type or communi.
ty including Rousseau’s ideal community based on social contract.

The academic community is diiierent; it requires a type of
hierarchy, an academic hierarchy, but not the political stnlctures
or which Rousseau speaks, This being the case, it is a miseappliu
cation of principles to use Rousseau’s philosophy in respect to
‘rule philosophy' at Grinnell. And again, there were three diner.
ent uses of 'community' evidenced in the article, all in reference
to Grinnell College, but at the same time, all conﬂicting usages.
It is necessary and good to realize that Grinnell is primarily an
academic community, and that there is a difference between an
academic, social, or political community.

Perhaps, ultimately, the students are the ‘only ones able to
legitimately exercise such a sovereign power over themselves'.
But the ability to handle such responsibilities entailed in 50V-
ereign power is also a criterion of legitimacy in an academic com-
munity. To make this point clear and also to conclude, I also will
quote from Rousseau, and perhaps with a bit more relevance:

As soon as a man attains the age of reason he becomes

his own master, because he alone can judge of What will

best assure him his continued existence (Chapter 1, Book

II).

Remember the ‘as soon as‘ and how it is relevant to the mean-
ing oi ‘academic community’.

 

even understand the vocabulary
oi their assumed profession.
And yet it is their pathetic
vaunr that they are capable of
making their own rules. One is
reminded or the poster put up
last week in the campus post
office, in which the GSM asks
“Who decides principles?” As
it principles were decided!

We shall undoubtedly have a
scandal this year which will
outdo even last year's — and
that one made the papers in
Copenhagen, Denmarlc Think
of it: little old Gl‘innell all the
AF and UPI wires! Well, ii We
do have a “revolution," at least
the students will be able to
\vithslantl the snecrs of those
who say “Grilitiell? Where's
that?" Tlitlmpllal’ltly our timer—
pllctls GSM Students will be
able to claim that they trove
achieved even more publicity
than Parsons College, on the

sound principle, no doubt, that
any publicity is better than no
publicity.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

by Neil Fischer

I’d like to enter another complaint . . . on the books.

Remembering a line from one of John Ciardi’s pl]
it easy to draw a parallel with and for my “readersh
nell:

“Sir," sald the spectacled skeletal lady back at the
desk, “in this allegory

You lead from my shelves or not at all.

Go look for yourselves: there are no bookstores. . . '

At least there are no other bookstores, and rm getting just a
little tired of a trusty monopolistic force being exercised on my
choice of reading — and for that matter writing — material.

And so, this week. I’m not sure whether l'm taking a side-
swipe at the bookstore, the library, or the faculty. But i hope who-
ever is responsible for the problem will get the idea.

Let's be more specific. Okay, you — a Grinnell sophomore or
junior or whatever e have had a book recommended to you by
your Physical Anthropology professor, namely African Genesis by
Robert Ardery, a popular, anthropomorphic, almost-satirical semi-
novel on Australoplthicine manrapes.

You go over to Carnegie basement. Yes, they have one (but
only one) copy of the book — Price, 31.95.

The same book, unexpurgeted and unabridged, is also out for
95 cents. Why does the bookstore stock the more expensive copy?

Why does it stock only higher grade. ,higher priced typing
paper?

Okay, you say, but you don't have to buy African Genesis; it’s
only recommended reading. And besides, if you are the lucky one
to get to the library first — before the other 35 in your third anthm
class 7 you're all right,

Alright, you are taking 19th Century Russian Literature.
Gogol's Dead souls is required reading a Price $2.45 in a Modern
Library edition, The same book — in the same translation and un-
abridged and, of course, unexpurguted ~— is available for 75 cents
In, I believe, a Signet Classic edition.

So why do we get stuck tor $1.70 more than we might have
paid?

Why does a III-cent box of Kleenex cost 39 cents in Camegia
basement?

of course, ii materialist bookstore is not all to blame, Al
Sam Wassom, head of the bookstore, is the first to point out: “I
only order what the professors tell me.”

But some faculty members, it seems, don‘t know much about
books or student ﬁnances.

A seminar in Press AS A Social Instrument course this semes-
ter has a $5.95 history of mass media as a required text. Reading
the entire book was the first assignment,

But after the class finished it, the good professor emphasized
it was “merely interesting as history and not very important"
and that the class would have no further use for in

So why buy it? Couldn‘t the four members of the class have
borrowed one subtly-placed reserve copy at the hurling desk? Sir,
I don't have six dollars to throw around.

Grinnell literature, history, and historical studies courses are
notorious for requiring anthologies well over two hundred pages
in length and then assigning a single twenty-page article and
nothing else from them all semester.

Couple these difﬁculties with a libra whose collections in
almost every area are constantly being on zed as inadequate by
faculty members; a faculty that hasn’t noticed that students are
not all Diamond Jim Bradys; and a privatelyowned bookstom
with no competition in the town, and you have a problem.

And, kiddies. you have another problem.

But it's not my problem, is it? i just point out what i see
.vcry week and get my kicks watching you when you never do
anything about it.

Of course, there is something you can do about it. Your student
Ienate has organized a committee to investigate the bookstore,

and you might serve on it . . . if you're not too busy earning cash
to buy books.

go on and not be influenced by
them, time-consuming and dis
ruptive as they may be, There
was also perhaps a warning tor
the College — that the gov-
ernmental system in residence
halls, in spite of the individual
competence of hall presidents,
could nnt deal rationally with
any highly controversial com
munity problem."

Leggett had hoped to discuss,
without the pressure of emer<
gency, what changes students
thought necessary. He said that
he did not get the opportunity
he sought, due to the clamor
on the part of some house
presidents for “home rule."

A STUDENT OPINION

AN ANSWER T0 LEGGETT

by AL CLOUD,
WALLY KOPSA and
MARTY WIESENFELD

We are not pleased with the
content oi the speech President
Leggett delivered to the open
Senate meeting on S u n d a y,
September 24. We appreciate
his stated intention of pmvnk—
ing student thought and action
on life at Grinnell College in
general. and the nature of the
residence halls in particular.
However, several of his sugges-
tions for change will, in our
opinion, retard the development
of an intellectually and emo-
tionally mature student body.

Mr. Leggett suggests a
“South Campus of underclass
men and women, and a North
Campus 01 upperclass men and
women in a similar arrange-
ment." This is perhaps the
single most nbhorent idea of
the speech. To quote the report
of the Ad Hoc Committee,
“Recommendations pertaining
to the residence halls,” pre-
sented to President Leggett on
May 12, 1966:

“That freshmen entering
Grinnell College under the
above stated plan, not be
delayed a full year in seg-
regated freshmen housing,
but become subject to tho
inlluences of the far great-
er variety of persons and
academic disciplines than
could be afforded through
any selectlve process of
junior . senior counsellors.
We believe that the more
realistic approach to fresh
men is through the counsel<
ling of freshmen when ex<

A STUDENT OPINION

ON THE

The author‘s name is being
withheld by request.

There is much to be said for
”an effort to present some ba~
sic facts” about the use of
drugs by college students. In a
r a c e n t memorandum the
Deans' offices attempted to do
this and more: “to separate
fact from the mass of specula-
tion"; to “describe some of
the drugs used and abused by
college students" and to “ex-
press the attitude of Grinnell
College toward the problem."

in addition, the statement ola
Iers “the full extent of Grin-
nell College’s resources in

graduated system of rules and
rule enforcement: “a frank
recognition that underclass res-
idence halls will have more
supervision than upperclass
halls." The obvious assumption
is that age can be equated with
maturity and the ability to
make rational decisionsr

We disagree. A number of ob-
vious problems seem inherent
in any graduated system or
rules. Example: A freshman
and senior are apprehended in
illegal opens Will they receive
different penalties for a mutual
violation? Tile example as-
sumes, of course, that the sys-
tem will permit a freshman and
a senior to become acquaint<
ed. We do not accept, as Presi-
dent Leggett obviously d o e s,
the Virtue of “the principle of
the progressive withdrawal of
college authority as students
progress through their four
undergraduate years.”

We heartily agree with the
suggestion that there be “a
conscious policy of permitting
more upperclassmen to live off
campus in either private homes
or apartments." We find the
motivation behind this liberal-
lzation disturbing, h o w e v e r,
The students to reside off cam-
pus are those "who do not
choose to abide by college so<
cial regulations." We fear the
consequences of making di5<
agreement with college social
regulations the major criterion
for oft-campus living We fore-
see the regrettable possibility
that those students lnclined tD<
Ward dissent, activism, and a
constant questioning of mores
will flee to the freedom of off-
campus residence, leaving a
quiet, homogenized (milk-
toast?) society on campus — a
society which never questions
but only submits. This problem
can only be solved by liberaliz-
lng social regulations in the
residence halls so that on-cam-
pus living becomes a viable
alternative to off-campus living
for these students.

The residence hall Is Inelb

meeting the concerns of stu-

dents."

It is not unknown for admin-
lstrators to be somewhat less
than frank in their public pro-
nouncements if the above we
present the real motivations
behind the memorandum,
it would be a welcome, al-
though somewhat unexpected,
document. Yet there is much
textual evidence for the View
that the Deans had other things
in mind than the welfare of
their students.

To begin with, the Deans are
not unaware of the favorable
publicity (paragraph one)
which could come from a
seemingly frank, objective and

Grinnell. Therefore, at a time
of questioning and examination
of the system, it would be u
mistake to restrict ourselves to
such issues as open rooms and
the residence halls. It is time
to question the entire philos.
ophy ol Grinnell College. we
suggest that the student body,
administration, and faculty has
gin seeking a general pliilosos
phy which, when concretely in.
stituted, would result in radical
changes in all aspects oi Grim
nell college.

Mr. Leggett asked for speclh
to proposals. We have ours.

1) The purpose of the col-

lege is to create an envir-

onment in which each indl-
vidual has the opportunity
to develop freely his intel.

Iectual and emotional capa-

bilities.

2) To implement this gen.

erai ph linsophy we

propose:

a) An integrated dorm sys<

tem. More specilicaliy, al-

ternating men's and wom-
en‘s d o r m s with no
separation of underclass.
men from upperclassmen.

b) The removal of all re-

strictions of open rooms in

the dormitories

c) An all campus room

d) The abolition of all

grades and the institution

0) The opportunity for all

juniors and seniors to par-

ticipate in an academic
program solely of seml—
hats and in d e p e ndeut
studies, it they so desire.

f) Student responsibility

for the establishment. as

well thecenforcement, of
social regulations.

Mt. Leggett called on thq
student body to have the coupe
age and energy to examine in
problems and propose some so-
lutions. We call on Mr, Leggebt
to have the courage and vision
to work for meaningful changn
es in not just the residence

Fanatical eyes, crazed plays

were presented this week in

the part of Wellington, the
dissatisfied millionaire who ii-

Greg Wallace —- as Wellinga

most humorous touches to the
play.

Ruthie Stemberg made a

However, as with Phil Miller’s
Hyman Geltfast, a rich friend

to lie with the characters as
written and not so much as
portrayed.

Krausman was dissatisfied

A STUDENT O’PINION

HELP! THE PARANOIDS ARE AFTER ME

By JIM RUDOLPH

(I write this with the hope of
continuing discussion of a prob
lem raised by Paul Jones in
“The Loneliness of the Long
Distance Runner.")

The rumors so widely circu-
lated last Tuesday night con-
cerning the existence of ﬁve
(six, twenty, who knows how
many) nareo men on the Grin—
nell campus gave birth to pro-
fuse activity by a large portion
at the college community.

The switchboard was busier
than on any past Thanksgiving,
make-shift Paul Reveres were
running imm house to house to
iniorm the students of these
m 05 t unwanted guests, and
these students were racking
their brains for new and better
hiding places. (Let's iace it,
the students, the deans, and the
narcs know that there is a lot
at grass on this, as well as ev-
ery other campus in the nation
this year.)

Paranoia seems to be a com-
mon state of mind on the Grin-
nell campus this year (eg.
ie a rs of administrative sup-
pression of student involvement
in Convocation, tears that one
of the new resident advisors is
making his living by being no
informer to the deans, etc).
What is the cause at this slate
of paranoia which seems to
plague Grinneli College stu-
dents?

Living on the west coast this

summer, I encountered a simi-
lar phenomenon among the
new leltist and hippie “move
ments." This fear was not
merely the natural iear, that
at being busted, but spread tar
and wide into almost every as-
pect of politics and human re«
lations.

Paranoia is the bud oi the
“don’t trust anyone over thir<
teen" ethic, the Communica-
tions Company publications oi
the Diggers, and of other pub-
lications such as Ramparts,
whose editors think that their
child's youth rellovvship group
is being subsidized by the CIA,

Paranoia is evidenced in the
Dean's Office latest master-
piece, Student Use at Drugs,
when tho drug phenomenon is
referred to as a “problem” by
its authors.

The problem i wish to discuss
is a common enough one to
Grinnell people, but its com-
monness by no means lowers
its importance it is communi-
cation. What is the cause of
this paranoia, ultimately, but a
misunderstanding due to a lack
of communication?

What is the cause oi the
many-sided paranoia involved
in the drug Scene but a misin-
formed body of lawmakers
writing archaic and unjust
marijuana laws, the uncertain
extent of the enforcement of
these laws, and the multitude
of rumors concerning the ef-
iects oi grass which rise out of

misinformed
sources?

I congratulate the deans on
their statement concerning
their elllorcelrlent ot drug laws
on campus, yet was appalled at
their ignorance concerning the
actual eilects at these drugs.
Their knowledge is akin to that
oi the producers of the incred-
ibly gross, sensationalist ilick,
The Weird World of LSD—Ii
movie which portrays every
trip as a bummer during which
man sees his inherent death-
wish as real.

If this communication, lie.
the dean’s statement, is to re-
ceive national attention, 1
should think that the deans
would want to do more than
reveal their ignorance on the
subject oi drug ciiects, (May-
be communication here in-
volves turningron the deans?)

What are these fears con-
cerning American centraliza-
tion turning into a police state,
controlled by our gestapo, the
CIA, except a lack oi com-
munication between govern-
mental institutions and the peo-
ple they supposedly represent?

Wllo knows what the CIA is
doing? Who knows what is hap<
pening in Viet Nam? who con-
trols mass communication in
this country?

Perhaps the reason students
today are doing their damnedest
to avoid the limit ill not that

blem by misuse oi drugs or

or drugs as having engaged in
conduct dangerous and harm-
ful to himself and others and
therefore subject to separation
from the college.

It is undeniable that certain
drugs are dangerous. Some
sedatives, stimulants and hal-
lucigens are cited as examples.
But it is widely agreed by stu-
dents that these do not consti-
tute the “drug problem" at
Grinnell. in any case, it would
seem a rather inhumane policy
to expel a student ior, say,
excessive dependency on trana
quillizersi

it is the use or marijuana, I
submit, which is the subject of
the Deans’ concern, and there-
fore it is somewhat misleading
to deal with this drug in the
same context as other, admita
tedly dangerous, drugs. Let us
consider the “iacts” presented
about marijuana:

(l) Marijuana has ele v e n
(slang) synonyms, which are
listed;

(2) it is cheap and demand
is growing;

(3) it has a characteristic
odor;

(4) it is often used under
cult-like conditions;

(5) it causes no mental or
physical deterioration;

(6) it has, by wldo Agree-
ment, no therapeutic value
for mild neuroses:

(7) “its dangers come from
the distortion of time and
space judgement, u unique
ieeIing of well-being, depres—
sion of inhibitions and ‘im-
pulse reiease.’ "

(8) users at marijuana are
sometimes led to the use of
heroin.

Fact 8 belongs in that “mass
of speculation" which the
Deans promised to avoid, Like
the domino theory, it is an an
gument no longer advanced ev-
an by the most pig-headed oi
partisans. Facts 2, a and 5 do
not concern us here Fact l is
a clumsy way oi saying that
users of pot may be regarded
as uncouth and unsavory. Fact
7, which spells out the “dang-
ers" oi using pot, is not inaC<

Friday, September 2v, my

tic effect on mild neuroses, the
Deans appeal to the testimony
at its users. it is my impres-
sion that most users would teen
tiiy to the opposite. in any
case, there is much to suggest
that individuals will not turn to
an illegal and expensive drug
which does nothing to reduce
neuroses or tensions.

The Deans are at another
opinion. Students, they suggest,
turn to pot because it is a lad
(iact 4). There is an “illusion
oi drama, excitement or myth"
about pot. “Drug experimenta-
tion or use or abuse is some-
times undertaken as a means
oi momentary escape (or) re
bellion.” Smoking pot is "a
communal enterprise," and at-
tracts students who, like chil-
dren, are fascinated with
“ ‘Cool' initiation into certain
mysteries."

This aspect of drug use sug-
gests the underlying reasons
for the administration's aver-
sion to pot smoking. 1 cannot
here go into detail why cults-
like and “antibourgeolse” be<
havior should mystify and mm
voke a reaction in a typical ad‘
ministration. But is is patently
not a concern ior pot users
which has led the administra-
tion to issue a threat to expell
them. The Deans have made
no effort to arrive at a new
solution based on “the facts."
The facts presented about mara
ljuana do not support one pol-
icy more than another, What
the memorandum represents is
an apology for a preconceived
policy. It the Deans have con-
vinced anyone of their point of
view, it has been done by puta
ting the cloak oi scholarship on
dishonesty and sophistry.

The decision of Grinneli ad<
ministrators not to remain in-
different to pot smoking is not
surprising. They have produced
a document designed to cum
vincc themselves. and others of
their mind, of the worth of an
essentially inllcxiblc policy.
Their attempts at sociological
and psychological “explana-
tions” represent little more
than ridicule of those who they
pretend to understand and are
painiul reminders that Grin.
hell's Deans have a habit of
conironting a strangs phenone<
non not with understanding but
with suppression.

it has not been my aim here
to advance an argument in:
the legalization of pot; rather,
i have sought to deny a piece
at apology and propaganda the
cloak of scholarship.

BAMPIJS
MOVIE

This weekend’s movie ls as
much a curiosity as a good
film. ll one were forced to
label it, it would be called a
“Japanese western,"

The director, Akira Kurosa-
wa, has made many films.
among them a picture about
Samurai warriors e n t I ll e (1
Seven Samurai, which was
adapted by an American direc<

tor to make an American west-
ern — The Magniﬁcent Seven.

This weekend’s movie came
about through a reverse prac<
ess: Yojimbo is a samurai plc~
lure built on the framework of
an American western. A hired
samurai killer pits two gangs
against each other, and the re
suit is an action-filled film
which is at the Same time hu-
morous, witty, dramatic, and
brilliantly Satirical.

Yojimbo was a 1962 Venice
Film Festival award winner.
It will be shown in ARI-l at
10:30 pm. Saturday and Sun-
day.

Being shown tonight at 11
p.m. is Gentleman‘s Agree.
ment, directed by Elia Kazan
and starring Gregory Peck.

Encampment applications i
are due In the box in the ‘
post oiiice by tomorrow
noon.

The irony of this subject ls
apparent in the fact that para<

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Fall is now fading from Grinnell but since it is difficult to con-
dense 55 football games in the two weeks nature allows us for
lutumn, l. M. sports continue in the cold, drab days which precede
true winter.

Last week was the first in which the form chart took a beat.
ingr East beat South, West beat East (in the annual Goldfish
Bowl), Rawson beat West and South beat Smith. All of this
proves nothing, of course, except that if one follows this logically,

. M. football turns out to be nothing more than a syllngistic flaw
In the minds of North Campus athletes.

An I, M. board meeting was held this week and it was decided
to keep flag football, raise the penalty for failing to referee as-
signed games to 20 points, eliminate any sort of cleats in the
football games and think about illstituting I. M. Wrestling.

None of this is likely to make the New York "limes but it’s the
best I can do in a rather mundane week of sports (besides, it's
hard to make things exciting when you don't get to have an artist
draw for you or you‘re forced to remain within the bounds of
decency).

In order to take advantage of the fall weather, the South
Campus (to think that next year that term will be meaningless,
sigh) l. M. program is deeply embroiled in avid softball wars.
Assuming the sun comes out again, i will attend one of the
affairs and bring back a stirringly descriptive report (i wonder if
it’s anything like the sweatshirt relay?).

HiOSH FEW
BUT FIERCE

By JEFF SCHECK‘I‘ER

As the varsity Pioneers are
fighting for Victories. the fresh-
men football team is getting
ready for their first game. in
a recent interview. Coach John
Pfitsch said that he had a
strong and highly enthusiastic
squad.

Several s e r i o u 5 problems,
however, darken the outlook
for a successful season. Coach
Pfitsch acknowledged that a
lack of depth will prove to be
a major problem. With only
twenty players on the squad,
many team members will be
forced to play offense and de-
fense. Another serious problem
is the inexperience of the back-
field, Only quarterback Gal-y
Johnson, who played for Grin-
nell High School. has adequate
game experience.

Coach Piitsch continues to
hold high hopes for the team.
The line is particularly well
fortified and is anchored by two
220 pound tackles. Another pos-
itive factor for the team is the
running of iuilbacir Roy Lewis,

The freshmen play against
Cornell, Knox and cos. Their
first game will be on October
12 at Cornell.

 

VARSITY
SPORTS

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Last Saturday was the occas«
ion of a double defeat for the
Pioneers and one can be added
since. The football team lost to
st. Olaf 28-20 and the cross
pountry team lost to the Oles
2629 last Saturday. This Tues-
pay the barriers lost to the on-
versity of Northern lowa, 17-
12.

The first seventeen minutes
of the sixty minute gridiron
battle were decisive for the top
ranked oles, During this period
,they ran the score to 2m. Plo-
neer quarterback Kent Thom-
son had two passes intercepted
to start the first and third scor-
ing drives.

The Pioneers finally started
rolling in the second half and
ran the score to within eight
points. With 2:27 left in the
game they recovered an on-
side kick. But the faint hope of
a tie was shattered three plays

tater when Mueller or St, Olaf
picked off a Tom Lower pass.
The game was filled with er<
Tors. St. Olaf lost the ball by
fumbling six times and had
one pass intercepted. Grinnell
had a sure fingered backfield
and didn't lose the ball once by
tumbling. But they made up for
this by having six passes in-
tercepted. This is two less than
the total for all of last year!
It is interesting to note that
twice Grinnell recovered Ole
fumbles only to have a pass in
tercepted in the next play.
After doing an enormous e-
mount of research I have com-
piled the following passing staa
tistics: The Pioneers attempted
22 passes; six were intercepted,
nine were completed, and seven
ate grass. This means a whop-
ping 68 percent of the passes
Were caught. (Unfortunately

Pioneer split end Mike Schwerh streaks toward six
points of Grinnell gain with a completed pass.

 

the gridder frequently had the
wrong color jersey.)

The total gain from the nine
completions was 51 yards. But
of the nine, three were for
scores. One was for a two point
conversion and the other two
were touchdown passes. That's
a profitable 52 yardsl

Less can be said about a
crossscountry meet. Naturally
coach Ray obermiller was dis-
appointed about the two losses
and feels they were due to a
lack oi conditioning and failure
of the squad to run in a pack.
He is planning to quickly rem-
edy those defects.

ished against St. Olaf:

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN RAZ

An important omission in last week’s table of zesponses is that
when responder holds second round control in the asked suit and
an Ace outside, he bids the Ace.

In responding to the first asking bid, responder often will have
a void or voids which were not covered by the table. For these ln<
stances, there are three rules to govern responder's bid: 1. When
responders hand has a void but no Ace, treat the vold as though
it were an Ace; 2. When responder’s hand has a void and an Ace
in outside suits. and second round control in the asked suit, Show
the Ace, disregard the void: 3. With an Ace in the asked suit and
a void outside, bid the voidi with void in the asked suit and all
Ace outside, bid the Ace.

In general, the first asking bid and its responses reveal either
first or second round control in the asked suit and all first round
controls in the outside suits. The second asking bid discloses infors
mation about all second round controls which have not been ro<
vealed.

Hand 1. (a) Spades are the agreed trump suit. (b) it: is the
first asking bid. Clubs is the asked suit. (c) North has neither
first nor second round control, he therefore signs off by returning
to the agreed trump suit at the lowest possible level.

Hand 2, (3) Hearts have been bid and raised, there is no
reason for South to bid clubs other than to make an asking bid
since game in hearts is the obvious target of the bidding. it: must
be an asking bid, (b) North has second round control in clubs and
the Ace of trump, he therefore jumps trump, (c) From his knowl-
edge of the Controls and distributional information in the bidding
South bids the slam. (d) North now cannot bid.

Hand 3, (a) Spades are the agreed trump suit, they have been
bid and raised. (1)) 4C is the first asking bid, clubs is the asked
suit. (c) With second round control in the asked suit and an Ace
outside you bid the Ace, therefore North bids 4]] showing the
Ace. (d) South still needs to know about North’s Kings, so he
makes a second asking bid. It is important to note that South could
have made his second asking bid in any suit but trump, but some
suits will reveal more information than others, therefore he is
cazeful to choose hearts as his second asking bid. He needs to know
if his partner has the King of Hearts. (e) Nonh has the King of
hearts and the King of spades he therefore jumps trump. (0
Against the opening lead South can lose only one club and will be
able to sluif his diamond loser on dummy's long hearts. no there-

and for the sake of revenge my
prediction is 27—23 in favor of
the Pioneers.

The barriers beat Comell 25-

ders, Last year Cornell squeak-
ed by with a 27-23 football vie-
tory. The pioneers will be out

to revenge that defeat.

A prediction for that game
would be a shot in the dark but
I will attempt it. Cornell has a
lot of depth this year having
lost only five men to gradua-
tion. They will be playing for
the home fans. Grinnell comes
to them after almost tying the
conference champs of last
year. There is bound to be a
let down and their performance
d e p e n d s on their ability to
bounce back. I think they can
and will win if they show the
spirit they had against the
Oles. It should he a close game
