Main basement to do Union duty

Major remodeling of Main Hall basement is
now underway. The remodeled space will be
used as a temporary social center during con»
stniction of the new Grinnell College Forum.
Later, the space will serve as a banquet and
party room.

The college hopes to begin construction
oi the Forum in early spring, according to
Grinncll Vice—president Merritt C. Ludwig,
necessitating demolition or the old Union
building. Occupancy of the new Forum is
plauned for September of 1994.

Principal work in Main basement will in-
volve the “Little theater” where the iloor is to
be leveled, and adjacent rooms reconstructed to
provide rest rooms and a coat check room. The
entire basement, including the Private Dining
room, will be air—conditioned. The east outside
stairway approach to the basement will also be
reconstructed. .

During construction, Ludwig said, there
will be inconvenience in reaching the Port,
but it will continue to be available for stu-
dent and faculty use. The remodeling pros-
ect is planned for completion about March
1 with the noisiest and dirtiest part at the
job being carried out during Christmas re.
cess, Cost of the overall project has been
estimated at $60,000 to 370,000.

When remodeled, the little theater will scrve
as a general lounge area, and as a place for
dancing. The stage, though reduced in depth,
ill be retained. Television, bumper pool and
'ng pong will probably be assigned to adjacent

TilE QUAD cleaning agency will be moved
its new permanent location in Loose base-

ment, and use of the women’s kitchenette in
Main basement will be curtailed “for the dura
tion," Ludwig stated.

Arrangements for grille food services in the
temporary social center will also be made. Be—
cause of lack of space to prepare and serve
food, some items may have to be offered by
vending machines located in the vestibule now
leading to the Private Dining,Room.

THE PDn itselz will iunction as the grille
seating area during hours when the Union is
open, but will also be available at meal hours
for private dining, according to present plans.
Hours of operation for the temporary union
have not yet been set.

Providing temporary quarters for oth»
er activities now housed in the Union has
been very diiiicult, Ludwig said. These ten-
tative plans have been made. Miss Georgia

as will student government offices. These ar-
rangements will be worked out in detail later.

to analyze their own viewpoint ‘

up some controversial rule
changes, These changes would

performance was first—rate. :

The first period of the game
was scoreless, although the Grlnr

THE DES MOINES team took
a 2—0 lead in the next stanza
and added another goal before
the Grinnell team came storming
back.

They scored two quick goals
before the All-Stars tallied again
and added another with about 4
minutes left in the game.

The Grinnell team threaten-
ed thereafter but could not, in
the short time remaining, come
through with the tying goal.

The Grinnell hockey team is
not intercollegiate but is a club
formed through the initiative of
a few interested students.
