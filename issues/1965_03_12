Activity Fund Allotment Cut 8%:
Hartl Claims SOiZidi Plans Suffer

Second semester budget allor-
merits from the activity fee
fund were made this week —
with an eight per cent across-
therboard cut.

The college activity fee,
which this year is $20 per stu
dent per semester, is budgeted
by SGA to social funds. student
government, and publications.
Though the budget is planned
for the entire year, the allot.
ments are made by semester,
since the student fees are pay-
able by semester.

The eight per cent cut “was

necessitated by a larger drop
in enrollment than was antici:
pated plus a series of unexr
pected expenditures and stu-
dent administrational errors,”
according to Milton Tootle.
student auditor.
.. When asked about the cut,
Phil Johnson. SGA president,
said that it had been caused by
a drop in enrollment larger
than had been planned for,

Tootle explained that the sec-
ond semester activity fee check
for $21,340 was $760 less than
had been estimated when the
budgeting was done, because

. of the enrollment drop. The
budget also expected to use $1,-
160.71 from the General Bud-
get and Reserve fund, but ex»
penses from first semester had
brought the balance of the
GBBzR down to where this was
not possible. Thus, the cut was
called fort

The regular budget is worked
out each spring by the Execu-
tive Cabinet, in consultation
with the recipients of the ac-
tivity fee allotments, and it is
then approved by the Student
Senate, ‘

Last spring, when the budget
was worked out, it was done

 

assuming an 33 per student in-
crease in the activity fee, This
increase was not approved by
the Trustees, when they, met
over the summer. Thus, when
the SGA officials returned to
campus this fall, they had to
re-work the entire budget.

It was at this time that the
funds from GB&R Were bud-
geted to the fund which the ac»
tivity ree usually covers alone.

Hardest hit ill this Cut have
been the social funds. Palmer
Hart], social Coordinator, said
that the cut would definitely af-
fect the social program for the
rest of the year, but that it is
impossible at this time to de-
termine just which areas will
be affected most.

Hartl added, however, that
“the magnitude of Spring Day
activities will depend on the

Discloses Student Government Goals

Gerald Goddard, junior political

objectives for student govcrnmcnt.

"Student government should ox.

“Student enforcement of the

“Student government should in-
vestigate the possibility or expand-
ing the present open-house pro-

ram, either in the direction of
increasing the numhcr of hall op.
tions or of broadening the weekly
program. Progress on other cam.
puses indicates that Grinnell need
no longer worry about being the
vanguard in this iron.

“The role of student government
in promoting interest in national
and international affairs should be
expanded. A regular channel
might be worked out with NSA and
Inc to investigate possihle student
action before presenting proposals
to the advisory council.

“Greater use should he made of

Ike's Visit Set
For May 13-14

Former President Dwight
Eisenhower Will definitely visit
Grinnell May 1314. This event
will give the college the un-
usual distinction of being the
only college east or west of the
Mississippi to have been visit-
ed by all the living exAPresi-
dents of the United States in
two successive years. The
highlight of last year’s PPPE
program was a visit by Presi-
dent Harry Truman.

Confirmation of the Eisen-
hower visit was received last
week from his aide. However,
travel plans are still uncertain.
If the President arrives by
plane he will be accompanied
by his valet and his aide. Mrs.
Eisenhower will accompany
the President if he travels by
rail.

During his visit, Eisen-
hower will participate in both
the politician-in-residence and
political lectureship programs
of the PPPE. He will attend
a press conference, deliver an
address in Darby, be initiated
into one of the men’s halls, and
attend meals and coffee hours
with students. The evening lec-
ture is tentatively ”Politics is
Too Important to ba Left to
the Politicians."

In announcing the schedule,
Edwin Gilmour (political sci-
ence) stressed both the
achievement of the PPPE in
obtaining both eXePresident's
in two years, and the benefits
to the college.

After the May Visit, the only
question will be: Where do we
go from here? All the way with
LBJ?

This program is the largest
private source of support for
advanced work in the liberal
arts. It has been financed,
since expansion to its present
size in 1958, by two Ford Foun~
dation grants totalling $52 mil-
lion.

The program was begun in
1945 on a small scale at
Princeton University, where
four Gl‘s were named Kemp

qualified, the faculty also de<
serves a pat on the back for
its active part in searching out
nominees and for the great ef<
fort it put forth in writing
quality letters of reference."

Cleaver: Ship 'Em Back Theory
Mighl' Well Work Both Ways

To the Edito '

A rough and rapid content analye
ll: of the last 5&3 discloses that
the most urgent question confront-
ing this community at scholars is
student government. 1 wish to
wmmend one student, however,
who seems to have got hold of I
matter that is also rather impor-
tant: race relations,

l refer to a letter by a student
who expresses his earnest desire
that I. fellow student could be
lhipped back to Africa, inasmuch
as the latter finds disagreeable
present arrangements for the Ne-
gro in the United States. I admire
the letter writer’s capacity to see
beyond the affairs of the parish;
but I would quibble with him at a
couple of points.

First, the student he refers to is
not from Africa, but from New
York, New York; nevertheless, the
suggestion that he change his
home is of the some order or gene
erosity as that tendered to his an-
cestors in Africa a century and a
half ago.

Second, although he is correct
in noticing that the white "popu-
lar majority” has generally been
able to “enforce r . , reason” (as
it has deﬁned reason) on its “pig-
mented iriends," he might not
have noticed a current theory that
the form that reason takes might
sometimes be questionable

For example, it is pointed out
by those who hold to this theory
that the popular majority has de~
Cliled (l) to guarantee the right to
vote to all citizens regardless of
race, creed, or previous condition
of servitude; and (Z) to use state
troopers, horses, sheriffs, police
dogs, hilly clubs, dirty jokes, ser-
mons, curses, tear gas, economic
pressure, whips, eniorced illiter-
acy, hiizzings by automobiles, orv
gunized humiliation, fire, fire
hoses, spit, intimidation and vio-
lence against children, law, iron
chains used as lashes, bombs, bul-

To the Editor:

Mr. Wolf should he applaud—
ed for his penetrating analysis
of the FCSA. He has a pai‘ticw
larly keen awareness or jus-
tice, indicated by his assump-
tion that surely one adminisv
trator, involved directly with
inter 'ewing students and de-
termi ng the necessity of dis-
cipline, is best qualified to
view the evidence and assign
a penalty. We should also ap»
preoiate Mrr Wolf's journalis»
tic openrml’ndedness and hue
mility in assuming: 1) That
anyone interested in student
affairs (particularly faculty
members) must subscribe tn
the Scarlet and Black; 2) If
any college organization is to
function properly it must in
form the 5&3 of all its activi-
ties. preferably by means of a
personal interview, When you
consider the fact. that the
FCSA has had only token re-
sponsibil ‘es in the past few
months, this latter request
seems quite reasonable,

Finally we must commend
Mr. Wolf for his democratic
separation of powers at Grin.
nell. The administration must
punish, the faculty must teach
and certainly the students‘ only
role is to passively accept the
products of both, Obviously we

Miss Herman Questions Grinnell's ‘liberal' Position

To the Editor:

It has become more and
more apparent to me in the
past few months the distance
and lack of sensitivity that the
students of this “liberal" in-
stitution have toward the real
goal of the Negro in American
society and in particular the
problem on this campus,

There is an assumption here
that we are all concerned and
sensitive to the sufferings of a
large body of our population,
and so the attempt is made at
Grinnell by “assimilation" and
“inclusion” to show that we
care about them as persons.
The problem to which I'm ree
ferring is manifested in a very
subtle attitude by the way in
which students try to achieve
this end of “assimilation" and
“inclusion"

Last week Doug McCormac
expressed this feeling overtly,
but for the most part. I think
this attitude is an unconscious
one. The fact is that we all
have become so aware of the
general problem >— it is some
thing which hits us in the face
everyday - that it is very
very hard to get away from the
externals. By this I mean that
it becomes extremely difficult
to forget that one is relating
to a Negro and accept him
solely as the person that he is.
When this happens, people be-
come overly conscious of their
positions and tend to exag-
gerate their "liberalism" in a
subtle benevolence which be-
comes paternalistic and con-
descending. This kind of utr

Quad Protected by
lights, Watchmen

The Quad has received in.
creased protection in recent
weeks following several cases
of stealing and reports of
prowlers around south cam-
pus.

Lighting to the east end
west of the quad has been in-
creased in intensity. Accord.
ing to Evan Walden, director
of the physical plant, a new
permanent lighting system
will be inslalled soon so that
"prowlers can be detected,"

Walden said that there have
been reports of several prowl.
ers and that the lighting is de~
signed to discourage these peo—
ple, “especially the youngsters
from town."

In another move to secure

the quad from outside entry, _

B&G has cut down the tree on

the norm end of the loggia '

which a student used to Climb
to the loggia roof in two recent
quad break-ins. Walden said
the tree "had been under sus-
picion {or quite awhile because
several branches were broken;
it wasn't any good, anyway, so
we took it out.”

Also, a second night watchv
man has been assigned to the
quad patrol for the past two or
three weeks. According to
Walden. a second night Watch-
man is "used now and then"
when the situation merits it,

 

titude is the most profound at-
front to human dignity that
exists.

On this campus, this attitude
has made itself felt so strongly
that the Negroes have respond-
ed in some cases with justified
disdain and in others with
heart-rending apology. An in
cident occurred very recently
where a Negro felt obliged to
make two other students aware
oi her presence because she
happened to be overbearing a
conversation in which she felt
something might be said to
hurt her and that she did. not
want to hear. When confronted
by the students and assured
that they were in full sympathy
with her situation, she said,
“Well, I just don’t know who

to believe anymore. When I
first heard about this place, it
was supposed to be so wonder-
ful. But since I've been here,
so many things have happened
and that letter Friday just
made me cry. 1 just wish 1

Here, at Grinnell College,
someone has to apologize for
what they are — for what they
cannot help. How reassuring
we must be — how manifestly
we must show our respect for
people as individuals — for hu-
man dignity. I think some seri-
ous questioning must be done
by each one into the_basis for
his assumed “liberal" positionr

Herzog One Up on Custer,- llis Last
Stand Will Most Likely Go on and . ..

To the Editor:

There has been some ques-
tion as to whether poor, oit-
drooling Herzog held the poi-
sonv pen responsible tor the
demagogic speech suggesting
that student government dis-
solve.

l know poor Herzog and I
like both him and his philos-
ophy. Thus, I was truly upset
that Mr, indignant Faculty
Member cleverly destroyed his
juvenile and demagogic at-
tempt to excite the rabble,

As soon as I finished reading
the Peking Review, the Scar-
let and Black, and the People‘s
World, I searched for poor Her-
zog. For a last stand, the
speech had seemed mild, and
I thought that the letter writer
may have been right in ones
tioning the authorship oi the
nelm'lous document,

But Herzog, as Iremembered
him, no longer eXisted. in-
stead, a blathel‘ing idiot hysV
lerically yelled, “When the
fighting begins, we have to
Clean out Carnegie as well as
Burling basement,” I Criiiged
at the prospect ot a tight on
two ii-onts but obligingly began
to empty beer bottles for the
Molotov cocktails,

”Hcrzog, do you think this
rather militant action is really
justified?” I murmured while
dellantly breaking windows.

Herzog straightened to his
full 5-3 and screamed, holding
his bloody and chatted wrists,
“I do not: wish to appear disc
affected; however, that letter
cleverly crushed our minor,
limited War, and escalation is
the only answer."
l-le blathered on, “They’ve got
between 150 and 200. But we’ve
got 1,100, Their troops are
trained and are our belters in
guerrilla wariare. But the open
war will bring us World-wide
student sympathy in our battle
ior human rights."

I giggled but was roused by

the crazy gleam in Hel‘zog’s
eye. Vaguely, I could picture
iriendly Herzog back beiore it
all began.

Back then he liked people,
held no animosity toward his
fellow man, and didn’t even
drool while talking. Gradually,
the poor all changed, He has
claimed that societal condi
tions have caused his fascinat-
ing but somewhat paranoic
outbursts. His latest Dut-
bursts came after an adminis-
trator asked him if he was
pregnant.

Now l—lerzog has flipped out.
In a few months he could have
leit here — homogenized and
pasteurized and stamped with
the four~year seal oi approval.
But now he's sitting here, unr
fit for the outside world: cli'OOl'
lng fiendisil‘llyv

For a long time Herzog
stared vacantly at Origins of
Totalitarianism, a book now
banned at the college pi'Dpar
ganda outlet. Then tor the
twentieth time he reread Mr.
Member's letter in awe.

l-lerzog ranted. ”Why just
yesterday I saw Mr. i. F. Mem-
ber slitheriiig across campus.
Surely, he couldn’t have utter.
ed such antlrl'evolutionary
drivel. Mr. Member showed
every sign oi being in his right
mind, with his glazed expres-
sion there as usual.

”Surely,“ Herzog spewed on,
”Mr. Member’s juvenile tirade
won’t destroy the value oi my
dialectic."

Having finished a case of
beer as a contribution to the
cause (Molotov cocktails), I
couldn't help bursting out.
l-lerzog, possibly Mr, Member
didn’t write that letter. Maybe
a leftist student wrote it, try—
ing to incite us to further ac-
tion."

That’s when Herzog ran out
the door screaming, “I don‘t
care. This is what I wanted
anyway.”

in closing let me assure the
editor there is no cause to
doubt that Herzog wrote the
speech, but let me caution you
that he has modified his posi-
tion, and 1 would advise keep»
ing all children indoors,

Freshmen Question
Student Enthusiasm

To the Editor:

The other day a question-
naire was placed into the boxes
of various selected freshmen
to formulate suggestions “for
informing more high school
students of Grinnell College.”

Question ll oi this question-
naire asks the selected stu-
dents what nonracademic fea-
ture oi the school they were
most impressed with,

A fitting answer to this ques-
tion would be a history of the
politics on the Grinnell campus
this year. This would provide
an interesting story indeed for
any prospective freshman, and
a most accurate picture of life
as it exists on this campus.

The first Chapter in this his-
tory concerns the reactions of
the Student Government to the
a d m i n is tr a tion restric-
tions placed upon that body
and itsfunctions. The Student
Government Called on the stu~
dents in a special meeting at
the Senate to "demonstrate
Clearly to all that the phrases
in the college catalogue about
the fine and independent stun
dent government are only
empty sale phrases.” The stue
dent body was further called
upon to renounce their apathy
upon this issue by ratiiying a
basic change in the Student
Senate,

This week leaders of the Stu-
dent Government showed their
further enthusiasm and lack of
apathy concerning student ai-
t'airs by not being able to pro-
vide more than one candidate
tor election to SGA president.

The contrast between these
two attitudes is so great that
an intelligent observer would
be led to question the real iac.
tors that occurred in (he decir
sions of the Various qualified
persons to run or not to run
for this office.

If student opinion is any in-
dication, then a second candle

To the Editor:

This is a reply to Felix Lun~
gu’s statement printed in the
March 5 5&3.

Dear Mr. Lungui

Since you have asked that
Americans talk to you about
America, I have decided to take
this opportunity to talk to you.
Your recent comments in the
5&3 are made with a great
deal of justification. No decent
American can justify the action
of Sheriffs Clark or Rainey, of

Wallace. No American can jus-
tify the brutality of Birming-
ham, or Jackson, or the subtle
discrimination of the North,

And indeed you as an African
can more easily see the dispar-
iLy between the noble senti-
ments expressed in the De-
claration of Independence, the
Bill of Rights, the Constitution
and the actual practices oi solne
Americans,

But I do think you overlook
the fact that there are indeed a
good many Americans, or all
races, who also
wrongs in our society. You
have made no allowance (or
the Reverend Deweys, the Jos-
eph Walls, the Senators Doug-
providing that same govern
ment with the competition nec-
essary ioi- the democratic se-
lection oi a leader chosen by
the student body, from whom
Ithese leaders derive their pow
l er.

This letter is by no means in
tended to cast any doubt on
the qualifications of the one
candidate who has placed himr
self up for liominalionr If any-
thing, he deserves praise for
being the one person with
“guts" enough to overcome
this tide oi apathy,

las and Javiis and Bayl-i. You
make no allowance for tho
Grinnell Civil Rights Group, for
SNCC, for the NAACP. for Mar-
tin Luther King’s SCLC. Thes-
too are Americans.

You rightfully deplore tho
iorces which killed John Ken-
nedy and Medgar Evers, but
you forget that Mrl Kennedy
was elected President of the
United States by Americans,
too; and when he was shot, it
was not only you who mourned,
but the vast maiorlty of Amen
icans.

Please remember that while
segregation is approved by
some Americans, those who
fight it are also Americans,
Remember that. the civil rights
drive was actually spurred by
the National Council of Church-
es, which is largely a while or-
ganizalion.

Likewise you should remem-
ber that the CiVil Rights bill of
1964 was passed in both Houses
oi Congress by an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan majority, and
the tremendous pressure exert-
ed on our legislators to pass
that bill was exerted not by Af-
ricans, but by Americans, Fi-
nally, remember that in the re-
cent Presxdential election, the
candidate who subtly appealed
to the white backlash was suc-
cessful only in the Deep South.

All I ask is that While you cori-
demn evil in our society, as in-
deed you should continue to do,
you also remember that there
are Americans who are on your
side,

Varied Choreography, Live Music
Featured in Annual Orchesis Show

“Orchesis in Concert.” will
be a “varied Show” this year,
according to president Ellie
Smith, And much of the variety
will be as apparent in the ac-
companiment as in the demo
ing.

Accompaniment will feature
live musicians on stage as in-
tegral parts of some of the
dance numbers, an original per-
cussion piece composed es-
pecially for the Orchesis show,
electronic music, and readings,
as well as more traditional
forms. There will also be a
number in the show, a study in
pure movement, which will
have no accompaniment at 311.

Another feature of the show
will be a trilogy -— a series of
three dances, throughout the
program, done to the same
piece of music. In each of
these dances, the soloist is in
conflict with various elements
in the environment.

An udagio number and a bal-
let solo will also be featured.

Advance reservations will be
required for the show which
will be presented next Friday
and Saturday nights in Rob-
erts Theatre.

Donulloe, Four Exchange Students Tell
Coffee Hour of leMoyne Experiences

By Pam Clay

Ned Donahoe (speech and
theater) began the coffee hour
about LeMoyne last Tuesday
afternoon in his customary di-
rect fashion, The mood was set
when he burst out asking
where we Were during Christ-
mas vacation while students
from Oberlin and other col-
leges went south to help re-
build churches. “There are
more things to be done than
marching,” he said. “As edur
cated people you have some-
thing to offer. Education is im-
portant, and if you want to do
something to help, that is what
you can do."

When asked why he went to
LeMoyne, Donahoe retorted,
"Why does someone go to Le-
Moyne? That’s none of your
business!” He responded to
another question with, "I
learned things at first hand. i
learned a lot of things to hate
— povertyI grubbiness.“

The four students from Le-
Moyne Lois McGowan,
Dorothy Harris, Louis Harvey,
and Frank Patterson—were al»
so present to answer questions
and comment on both LeMoyne
and Grinnell. Answers to an
inquiry as to why they came
to Grinnell ranged from curi-
osity, a Wanderlust, and a de-
sire for a superior education,
to Frank’s statement that he
was here because “the boy
who was supposed to come
couldn’tl"

Dorothy made a smiling
complaint about the Saturday
classes here and then elaborat-
ed on the LeMoyne class sche-
dule. They have several two-
hour classes, and these are
held throughout the day —- for
instance one German class
ends at 7:30 p.m. One big dif~
ference at Grinnell.that Lois
noted was that “Here kids
neck all over . . . on the stair-
way, in the lounges. . . l" The
girls both laughed but said that
at LeMoyne no one is ever
seen kissing.

All of the students from Le-
Moyne commented that they
had many friends (some had
most of their friends) outside
the college. Since LeMoyne has
no dorms, the unity of the col-
lege and the amount of activity
(e.g. student government)
which takes place within it Is
limited.

Donahue spoke of LeMoyne
students in general as the
"chosen few" and said that
many of them “did not know
where they were going but
knew they had to learn" They
realized that they will have to
be leaders and they are seri-
ous about learning LeMoyne

students have a ”double duty.”
he explained. They have to
catch up (from a generally in-
ferior high school back-
ground), and then they have to
go ahead from there.

Finally the discussion turned
to me Grinnellian at LeMoyne
and what his ourpose must be.
"Do not go down there to be
a torpedo and change Mem-
phis!" was the Clear word of
warning. Donahoe said that the
primary motive must be edu-
cation; "Then you will find
concern and find something to
do.” There is prejudice in
Memphis, not always obvious
but always there. The public
library, where ”we know we
are allowed but we know we
are not wanted," was cited as
an example of the need for a
mood of relaxation to combat
unfriendly staresr

“I wish we exchanged not
only students, but also teach-
ers," Donahoe said as he end-
ed the discussion.

A llrrtlnna report on the Sel-
ma situation, received by the son
last night by telephone from four
Grinnell students, is rested in the
Forum lobby.

Literacy Can't Go,
Father ’Ong States

“We can’t let the age of lit-
eracy go after all,” concluded
Father Walter Ong, noted scllol-
ar and teacher from St. Louis
University during the annual
Nollen L e c t u r e Wednesday
night.

Speaking on the possibility of
an end to the age of literacy
brought on by the new electron-
ic age, Father Ong said,
“Printing and writing are no
longer uniquely central but
part of a larger complex that
gives communication new or—
ganization himerto unknown.

“The human being can’t have
thinking without language be-
cause thinking implies the ex~
istence of other people," ex-
plained Father Ong in an ex-
tended discussion of communi-
cation.

“Our electronic age has
brought on a new world of
sound,” he said. “In scanning
the space age, sight will not
suffice." In thus admitting that
the manuscript age has given
way to the sound age, Father
Ong emphasized that one media
can succeed another without
canceling it, saying ”When we
started writing, we didn't stop

Pesticides Provide

By Anne Farrer

Although the speech by Dr,
0. Hale Fletchall, University of
Missouri agronomist, to Grin-
nell science bugs on March 4
may not have been considered
a topic of universal import by
most liberal arts tools, the
topic—pesticides—actually was
pertinent to the Grinnell situa-
tion.

For Instance, no one active
and responsible in student gov-
ernment would advocate fumi-
gating the entire higher heir-
archy of Grinnell; nonetheless
there are a few points that SGA
officials might find handy for
future reference.

For example,’ toxicity is a
matter of dosage, and all chem-
icals are toxic if taken in large
enough amounts. This could be

Possible Answer

a real saving in any future
SGA administration confronta-
tion, for by shrewd analysis of
the general character of an of-
ficial, the minimum dosage
could be determined readily.
H o w e ve r, Dr. Fletchall did
point out that “there is no such
things as absolute safety" in
the use of pesticides, of which
fact SGA-ers should he cogni-
zant.

One other point mentioned
by Dr. Fletchall is already quite
familiar to most Grinnellians.
In discussing the difference be
tween biological co'ntrol of pests
and the use of pesticides, Dr.
Fleichall made one last rele-
vant statement:

"It just all depends whose
drainboard the c o c k roaches
are on."

Republican Supports Two Party System
In Telephone Talk to Grinnell Students

ny Glen Ashmon

Every light in the normally
dim South Lounge was ablaze.
Microphones were scattered
around the upper level. and
giant speakers peered down at
the slowly gathering crowd.
The stage was set, the per-
former ready. It was 9 pm.
last Monday. The crowd
hushed. Only the spinning oi
tapes and the beeps of elec-
tronic machines defied Dhe si-
lance.

Then a lone human voice
penetrated through space and
imagination. Senator Jacob
Javits and the Young Republi-
cans had introduced a new con—
Cept in communication to Grin-
nell and Iowa —- the telephonic
lecture.

The Republican Senator from
New York told the Grinnell
audience, “Preservation of the
twosparty system requires that
people have a real alterna-
tive."

He continued that the 1964
brand of conservatism is not
an acceptable choice. Warning
that it is not enough to be dif-
ferent for the sake of being difr
Ierent, Javits called {or a pro-
gram which would be ”differ
ent in line with the national in-
terest.”

Javits recognized reunificar
tion and the rebuilding of the
party image as the immediate

 

problems which Republicans
must tackle. Cautionihg liber~
als against taking satisfaction
in saying. ”I told you so." he
nevertheless agreed that the
1964 election was a tragedy for
the Republicans.

He pointed out that Republi-
cans held their own at the gubr
ernatorial level only because
problems there were essential-
ly local. In Javits’ opinion. the
big question which confronts
the party is. “Can we compete
electorally With Democrats?"

Javits pointed to several
ways to compete with Demo—
crats including recruiting of
young people, mobilizing pub
lic support, and offering an al-
ternative both to President
Johnson's “government first"
approach and also to the “no-
government” approach in refs
erence 10 conservatism.

Seniors Start in last Home Game;
Hoopsters Will End Year on Road

By Bob Kat:

After watching our basket-
ball team Complete its home
season by beating Monmouth,
then losing to Knox and Core
nell, one can’t help wondering
what next year will bring.
We’ve played heads-up, hustling
ball this year. The fans have
been treated to many an excit-
ing game, regardless of the
eventual outcome. Our only
problems have been lack of ex-
perience and not putting the
ball through the basket enough
times. The two go handin-
hand. With the new confidence
and unity that this season will
hopefully instill in the team for
next year, I can see only forty
minutes a game of good, solid
basketball for next year.

It was only fitting that we
beat Monmouth. From Ted Ris-
ser'p lay-up at the opening
jump. to Clyde Smith's tap»in
with seventy seconds left to
play, the team showed more
than once that it was ready to
play serious basketball. But the
old nemesis, failure to score,
took its toll in the closing min-
utes Of the first half, as Mon-
mouth sneaked a 46-42 advan-
tage into the locker room, after
we had led for the first 19 min-
utes. Three minutes and twenty
seconds into the second half,
the score was tied. For the
next nine minutes we were in
control, until the Scots hit nine
points to our two to turn a 71-
66 deficit into I 75-73 lead, Then
Elliott Hibbs popped three
jump shots to take the game
into a 79-79 deadlock with two
minutes to go; then Clyde
Smith took matters into his
hands with the gamewinning
tap and a key steal that al-
lowed us to take a three point
lead with thirty seconds to play.
Fate was with us as we held
on for an 83-81 victory. All five
starters hit double figures,
Hibbs leading the way with 22,
Jeff Frant’t with 20, and Tom
Hill with 13.

Hill started the Knox game
all over the floor, hitting two
baskets, iorcing a jump ball
three times, and making a fine

utes. The team caught fire,
building up several eight-point
leads. but lost its edge at the
conclusion of the half, leaving
with a scant 43-41 margin.

up the score as the second half
started, and went ahead to stay

the basket, but the Swishers
finished with a ill-l outburst,
and took home an 81-66 deci-
sion. The bright note of the
game was Jeff Frantz's setting
of a new school season scor<
ing record, as he connected for
18 markers. Hibbs, Smith and
Risser also hit double figures.

Tuesday night was the final
home game of the season, and
Coach John Pfitsch started his
four seniors, along with Frantz,
in commemoration. Of the four,
Dave Seliergren, Clyde Smith,
Randy Morgan, and Dick Ul-
rich, Smith was the only regu-
lar, but the others played like

the Rams to a ten-point advan-

Matmen Pinned to Same loop Position

The varsity wrestling and
lwimming teams both ended
their seasons last weekend by
coming in third in their respec-
tive conference meets. The
swimmers, hoping to avenge
their loss to Cornell, were not
able to get any firsts, so Be-
loit along with Cornell was
able to sneak past the Pio-
neers. The wrestlers managed
one first but finished a long
way from the leaders, Cornell
and Monmouth.

The tankers captured four
aeconds, one third, four
fourths, and two fifths for

- their 51 points. Cornell won
. the meet with 71 points, fol—

lowed by Beloit With 61 points.

yard freestyle races. Rich

Barnes was the only winner
for the Pioneers. Bill recorded
a pin and a win in taking the
123 pound class. Ken Strubler
lost a heartbreaker to Larry
Swenberg of St. Olaf 4-3 in the
finals to place second. Gary
Wilson, who was subbing for
Larry Miller. who could not
compete because of his in<
juries, managed a third as did
Morgan Michel in the heavy-

the Midwest Conference indoor
meet at Chicago last Friday.
The Pioneers came from be-
hind to edge Carleton by win-
ning the last event, the mile
relay. The University of Chica—
go won the meet with 621/2
points, followed by Grinnell
with 49 points, Carleton 44, and
Coe 43, with the rest of the
conference far behind.

The Pioneers’ strength in
the relays and the hurdles gave
them the meet. The cinder<
men captured first place in
three of the five relays and
took first in both the high and
low hurdles. Besides these
events Grinnell could only mus-
ter one second, one third, and
one fourth in the thirteen
event meetl

Witt were the individual
heroes for the cindermen. De
Witt won the 60»yard high hur-
dles with a time of 7.35 seC<
onds and repeated in the 6|)-
yard low hurdles in a time of
7.2 seconds. Dewitt also ran on
two or the winning relay four-
somes. Captain John TePaske
was right behind Dewitt by
placing second in one event,
the broad jump, to a Chicago
athlete, and was a member of
all three relay teams, being
the anchor man in two of them.

Tom Wood, who was third in
the high jump, and Walt Neal,
who was fourth in the pole
vault, were the only other in-
dividual point scorers for the
Pioneers. Wood leaped five
feet-eight inches to finish two
inches behind the winner, Jay
Strouder of Carleton. Neal
vaulted eleven feet.

The Pioneers’ three relay
victories came in the sprint
medley relay, the twoAmile reA
lay, and the final mile relay.
Steve Brinmall along with Te‘.
Paske were the two runners on
all three teams The sprint-
medley team consisted of Te-
Paske, Dave Synhorst, Dewitt,
and Brintnall. The two-mile re-
lay team broke a tenryear old
meet record by covering the
distance in 8:06.!) to break the
old raccrd of 8:015 by Chicar
go. The team consisted of Bob
Dyer, Brintnall, Paul Patter—
son, and TePaske. The mile re-
lay team that brought victory
to the Pioneers was made up
