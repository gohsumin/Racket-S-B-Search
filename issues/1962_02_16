Academicdeiachmeniimplies social responsibi lily

by Mikc norwatt

This article is the sccoiid iii a
scrics on thc rcsponsibility ot'
thc acadcmic community to the
“outside" world.

Last week it was argued that
a socieL‘l's capacity to survive
rests upon its ability to accomr
modatc changing conditions. One
of thc ways in which socictics

‘ enable themselves to change is

through social criticism.

The process or- social change.
it was contended, is complicated
by the fact that societies are
reluctant to Cast,otf obsolete
means for achieving their ulti~
mate ands. .

The major reason for this
reluctance is that various indi-
viduals and groups within so~
cietics have stakes in the status
quo and are fear-tut of the con—
sequences of change. For exam-
ple, as modern capitalists began
to threaten the position of aris-
tccracies, aristocratic closse ate
tempted to halt the growth 0!
industrialism by preserving in»
stitutions incompatablc with
mechanization.

Our values. beliefs and opin-
ions about social problems
arc determined b_ a complex
at economic, sociological and
physical factors. Owing to this
fact, the chi ty of our per»
ception diminishcs as our in-
vulvcmcnt and commitment
inn-cases. As a result. the
prnbnhility of our bcing “0hr
jectivo” is reduced.

When wc find ourselves in-
volved in social problems, when
otir values, beliefs and interests
conic into conflict with oppos-
sing values, beliefs and interests,
Olll' tendency is to be defensive
side” World.

 

rauicr than open minded. Just
as wc judge others more harsh-
ly than we judge ourselves, wc
arc tar more sensitive to thc
“faults” of the opposition than
we are to our Own.

As a case in point, wc see in-
justice in the actions of other
nations more readily than we see
them in our own. When the
Soviets suppressed thc revolution
in Hungary, we judged the ac—
tion evil, When the United States
attempted to suppress revolu-
tion in Cuba, we saw an act_of

righteousness.

It all boils down to this:
truth becomes that which rec
cniorces our own values and
belicis. Falsehood is that which
contradicts them. It thus stands
to reason that the perspective
or various economic, social. and
political groups is limited. In.
deed, as the members at these
groups bccomc committed,
they act to limit themselves.
They read only magazines and
newspapers with which they
agree, listen to commentators
whose vicws are compatible
with their own.

One problem of a society is
to want to find rcliabtc inforilla»
tion about relevant social prob-
lems upon ,which to torm judg—
ments — information which .
not “propaganda". Anothc- is to
be able to find reliable infor—
mation.

This means that reliable crita
ics must be discovered and their
work must be acccssibtc to the
general public. By “reliable in-
formation", I mean material

which is not produced to sup-'

port the position of a particular
group, btit iatnci to captuie aca
tuality. Such intormation is mors
likely to come from the academic
community than from any
other sector oi the society.

The ocadcmician is less like-
ly to be blinded by economic
and political self-interest than
is, tor instance, the business
man. the labor leader or the
public polic awoken His ulti—
mate value is more likely to be
the good oi the wholc rather
than the good or a particular
group. His perspective tends to
he broader because he is ex»
posed to a wider gamut oi opiu—_
ions and richer sources of in” -
iormatiou. In a word, he is
much more likcly to see the
weakness in labor's position
than labor is. no is also much
more likely to see the strongth
at their position than manage-
ment is.

Owing to his relatively great-
er “detachment," he is more
likely to portray the real con-
flict. Often opposing groups
couch their power contlicts in
moral terms. Less restrained by
economic and political factors,
the acadciniciaii is both in a bet-
ter position to see the rcal’proh—
lem and set iortli his findings.

In View of the academic ch»
munty's unique vantage point,
and in light of the present sit—
uation in which the consequences
of public policy are so great, the
academic community has a re—

sponsibility to participate both
directly and indirectly in the
formation of public policy. One
or the ways it can do this is 1::
deal with pertinent. social prob—
lems and attempt to make its
findings available to the "out

 

and justice are the toundations
oi our society. without them
there would bo,cliaos and tlltia
matcly the destruction or our
system. The Abel—Powers ex
change has gauged a large
chink in this foundation, which
is now being strained to the
breaking point.

My posit ii, it I may state it
again, is simply that stridciits,

as plumbcrs, qua plumbers,

But it docs seem to me una
fortunate that at G inncll there
are so many socially respectable
pseud .iiitcllcctual rciugccs from
thinking, such as groups dealing
with political and international
problems.

There is Something pccullarly
dismal and repugnant to human
dignity in mass emotion mas~

groups think that I wrong them,
I can only suggest that while
thinking may ultiiiiatcl- result

May I add that i am not ino-

‘Abolition' vs. ‘Correctioh' — — —

The Grinnell Student Govern—
nicnt Association, in conjunction
with the Program in Practical
Political Education, will present
the ﬁlms “Operation Abolition"
and “Operation Correction" on,
Monday and Tuesday, Tcspeo

On Monday, "Operation Aboli-

in ARH. This is the House Un-
Aincrican Activities him which,
since its. release a little over a
year ago, has been seen by milrt
lions or people, provoking lla»l
tionwide controversy.

It purports to show that tlle‘
May is, 1960, student demon-
stration against HUAC in San
Francisco was Communislﬂnspil‘r
ed and that there is imminenti
danger or a Communist lakeow‘
er the United States.

Critics of’the film, includ—
ing some supporter-sot the
Committee, charge that the
film is a technical and mocha ,
auical mess, that it distorts
the facts to slander the stu-

‘ dents, and that it seeks to
identity all critics or the
HUAC as Communist dupes.
They charge that it makes
many deliberate sequential er-
rors, and that the narration
otters little or no proof eith—

‘an active and controversial rig-
urc’ in the light against capital

lConiniittec, spoke on the gene
‘Eiﬂl topic oi the iclevance of
religion in the modem woild.
Thuisday night the title or his
talk was "Can a Liberal Reli-
gion Help to Build a Sane So-
cietyl"

Dr. Fritchmau tirst dciincd rc—
ligion as tlmt-wliicli'“iiian cone
siders his ultimate concern and
his relationship to it" when
‘speaking of his optimism tor
man’s progless' m ,vorkmg eii
'ifectivcly ior his ultimate con-
cern he said, “man may not be
perfeciable; neither is he mcoi»
riglble" Stressing the iinpol‘-,
tance oi individual integrity in
the construction of a good so~
cicty, Dr, Fritchman quoted‘

“Only when theii
pr ate motives lead men to
seek public good can men live
in a good society”

 

in today’s world he tools that
the liberal religions are doing
ithc best job in giving "a (limelr
sion oi depth" to people‘s lives;
Dr. Fritchmaii listed iour quills
liLlCS to 'describc a liberal rec
ligion: 1) reverence ior me; 2)
belief in the “value or human
‘inquii-y“; 3) ”a moral obligation,

Fritcliman criticized organ

yi’dcd them with an ultimate
concern here on earth" He
considered “morality more
important than dogma" when
speaking at the denomination»
al coiiilicts present in tiic
United states'today.

He charged that churches had'
become “lost in red tape," and
that theyhad “lost the ability
to criticize thegovcrninent." He
claimed that “Churches are cap-
tive and must use secular voices
to speak." Finally, Dr. Fritclr
nian aiiirmcd that today “rec
ligion can and must do more to
involve man in the struggle to‘
keep human dignity alive."

Buck Tumbull of the Des Moines Register gives Grin-
nell the edge over Monmouth for the conference champsl
iOX‘iSllllL He, as most observers, attributes this to the sched-
ule advantage the Pioneers have over the Scots Grinnell
has four home and one away' contests remaining, while
Monmouth has two home and four road games, including a
pair at Carleton and St. Olaf.

 

l

Conservatism is not peculit only to politics, but is al-
so found in athletics, as is demonstrated by the currentl
controversy over the fiberglass vaulting“ pole. The loudest
cries come from former pole vault champ, Don Bragg, who
feels that; the new pole is a gimmick, and does not Show
true ability.

It seems as though Bragg would really like some more
time to husk in his former glory, instead of accepting the
fact that progress brings new and better methods of doingl
things.

Carletolt's 21-15 wrestling victory over St. Olaf has
rocketed the Cal‘ls into the position of the teanl-to-beat

nial champ Cornell, who has taken tlle top honors 20 of
