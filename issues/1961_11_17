CIVII Defense Plan i
Issued By Ludwig I

A preliminary report on cam-
pus civil deiense planning was,
Issued this week by McI‘rltt C.‘
Ludwig, vicerpresldenl

“OIYicizIs of the collcgc do not‘
believe a nuclear attack upon
our country is probable, but we
must concede that it is possible,"
Ludwig said i

“Therefore, in fulﬁllment oti
thel‘esponsibillty We feel toward
our resident students, the col.‘
legc has begun serious planningt
for their protection in the event,
this community should be
threatened by heavy radioactive
fallout.” ,

Emphasizing that detailed
planning is Inc from complete,
Ludwig said :1 Study of the
protective quality or campus ,
buildings has been made, and t
a decision reached to Ilse the I
basement of the Fine Arts
Center as the campus shelter. I
The area is large enough to
accommodate the entire Stu-
dent body plus essential op-
erating personnel, and the
building Strucun‘e aﬂords ex-
cellent shielding.

“The objective of our plans
is to provide ‘ialloul shelter for
residenl students and the shel-
tel": essential operating person-
nel [or a period of up to 14
days," Ludwwig stated. “We are
assuming that non—resident stu.
dents and college employees will
take responSlbillty for provid
ing shelter Ior themselves and
their families lll their homes OI"
elsewhere,"

Several reeks ago President
Bowen appointed an ad hot ad-
nlimsil'alive committee to dos
velop campus civil dcrensc
plans, The Committee is headed
by William A. Nevill (chemis-
try) and includes Dean James
H. SIauss, Dean Evelyn Gard

The Courlrighl Cartoon:
A Misrepresentation?

letters to tire Editor. . .

To the Editor:
I submit this cartoon (below) in licu or a 121in
Haw—T
a i
i

I,

i
i

Tlle cartoon submitted by Paul B. Courtrigllt, wllicll ‘-

appears in the Letters to the Editor column, desel es some
note, and some careful reexamination. Much as we ﬂppl'ecir
ate Courtrlght's artistic abilities it appears to lls to be
something of a misrepresentation. The young lnan pictu

ed ill the Collrtright cartoon is represented as a very un-
savory character. We are not about to deal here with the

problems of conformity or nonconfornlity, which we feel _
to be strictly the business of individuals What is important .

is that the group which went to Washington took every
precaution against just such misinterpretation.

In all effort to show that they were not merely non-
coniornlists, campus beats or wllat have you, haircuts,

suits, wllite shirts, shoe polish and the like were the order »

of the day. The group did not forget for one minute that
they would be viewed as students of Grinnell College, and
that their best purposes would be suited by a conscious at-
tempt to avoid such questions of personal appearance as
Courtright’s cartoon would suggest.

Furthermore, the appearance of the emblem of the Stu-
dent Peace, Union is not accurate as pertaining to the group
as a whole. The fourteen were careful to avoid in all pubr
licity releases, and all personal statements, any connection
between the group and national organizations. Many of
the people wllo went to Washington have no alliance with
the Grinnell Students for Peace, except a sympathy for
some of their causes. Such cartoons as the one Courtrigllt
has submitted may be dangerously misleading wllen not
qualified by accurate information.

A Fast of Support

It has been most encouraging to see the response to
the Washington trip. Whether for or against the methods
the group is advocating, the response of members of the
faculty, administration, press and the officials in Washing-
ton has been polite, tolerant, and ill almost all cases re-
spectful.

Several people, however, have been confused by the
stand the group is taking. The group is not registering a
protest against the United States Government. The group
is supporting the present presidential reluctance to test
nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Their action, we feel,
is a positive one, and a good sign of serious student feel-
ing for the matter.

Nancy Plogel

The'Edgren Resolution

Among the significant topics of conversation spa' d
by the recent flurry of activity over the Senate's “testing
resolution” and the pilgrimage to Washington by 14 of its
more \‘ocalrsupporters is tlli Does the Senate have the
right to pass a resolution which expresses an opinion con-
cerning affairs not relating specifically and solely to this
campus'.7 We think that the Senate, as a group of students,
expressing alld representing their own opinions, certainly
has this right. And most students, we feel, would agree.

The majority of current disagreement seems to lie in
whether or not the Senate, as a group charged with the
responsibility of representing the campus in a common
forum, has the right to hand down resolutions relating to
other than campus affairs, resolutions which would and
are naturally taken to be indicitive of a majority of cam—
pus feeling because they are the product of an elected
senate.

We could not give away the Senate’s right to
make resolutions concerning any affairs, campus or other—
wise, on the supposition that the senate does not represent
the feeling of the campus. If it doesn’t then the fault lies
with those who elected the “poor representatives,” Repre-
sentative government would not, as many have argued, be
representative government if it did not involve the trans—
fer of decisiolhmaking powers from a majority to an elect—
.ed minority.

However, we would not deny the right of any students
to make clear their stand on any resolution passed by the
Senate; we would not_deny them the right to demand that
their qualification or their corroboration of any resolution
be attached to it.

’ A motion which establishes a procedure for the enact-

Des Moines Register Speaks
In Favor 0f Washingh’an Trip

(Ed. Note — The rollowing editorial appeared in Wednesday's

gesﬁloines Register under the headline “Grinnellinns Speaking
1) :

Thirteen Grinnell College students are on their way to
the White House where they plan a three~day “sit and fast"
demonstration against resumption of U. S. nuclear testing
in the atmosphere They go with permission (neither ap-
proval nor disapproval, they say) of the college administra-
tion, and with the implied blessing of the Student Govern—
ment Association.

The student senate last week approved by 29 to 17 a
resolution against renewed U. S. testing The “Students
Fasting for Peace" group got together shortly afterward.
The president of the Grinnell student government said that
the demonstrators will speak for themselves and are not
sponsored by the student organization. However, the student
senate implied its approval by giving the 13 permission to
distribute the Grinnell antictest'ing resolution in Washing
ton, D. C.

During the 1950's lnuch was written about a supposed
political and philosophical apathy among college students.
They were said to have been bored with any cause beyond
$10,000 year and a good pension program. We are glad to
see that the students of Grinnell College, at least, are think-
ing now about other concerns and are speaking out. If the
“sit and fast” expedition has some aspects of a happy—go—
luchy student adventure, it also shows a concern with world
affa .

Tile 13 demonstrators may be commended for having
the courage of their convictions, the student body for con-
sidering and taking a stand on a serious national issue.
and the college administration for maintaining a tolerant
attitude toward a rather unconventional enterprise. ‘

It is to be hoped, however, that other college students
will raise questions about the wisdom of the U S, not
undertaking nuclear weapons tests in the air, so long as the
Soviet Union continues testing and will not agree to in-
ternational controls to supervise a test ban.

 

lnent of just such a l ght will come before the Senate
next week. Submitted by Gates hall representative John
Edgren, the motion requests that “For any resolution pass-
ed by the Grinnell College Student Senate of significance
beyond the college (as one dealing with national or inter»
national affairs) there shall be held a referendumto the
student body on precisely the same question upon receipt

of a petition signed by ten per cent of, the student body or,.

at the direction of the Executive Cabinet. In any publicity
the results of this referendum shall accompany the Senate's
resolution."

We think the motion is a good one, and deserves care-
ful consideration.
Jim Hatfield

To the Editor:

VVlth tllc onset or the decade
of the nineteen fifties, a new
attitude has swept American
campuses This is manifested in
the form of conservative pas-
sivlty. We seem to have cast aside
the traditional role of the dis-
scntcr, whether of thc right or
the loft. Ecchusc of the relative
lack of l'csponslbilltv of the stu-
dent to persons and institutions
savc himsclr and his ideals, he
has the opportunity and the ob-
ligation to act decisively and
unequivocally upon his beliefs.

Unlike the liberal, who must
constantly revise and compro~
mise his ends in attempting to
reconcile them with “reality,”
the radical may, and must, act‘
solely on the basis of his ideals,
regardless of their political fe
ibllity or social repcccussich..
His goals become the callot
which ehuces and stimulates
society on to new directions and
greater achievements. This is
the rule the student must as—
sume.

The students fasting in Wash-
ington deserve our highest
praise, not necessarily for the
position they espouse, but run
their courageous action. Our crit-
icism should be directed at the
letharglc students who fail either
to support their colleagues, or to
organize a counter-action.
Apathy is morally wrong.

on anyone who does not share

their God-given opinions.

These selfvrnade messiahs have
forced a seemingly mass con-

pressured the student senate to
pass resolutions and to use the
student body's money question—
ably ir not unconstitutionally for
interviews and press center-
ences. They have constantly
given false impressions to the
public or Grinnell student opin-
ion. These students who consider
themselves to be intelligent, un-
biased students have consistent»
ly been unintelligent and

To the Editor:

1 would like to congratulate
Coach Bowers and the tootball
tcam tor one ofvtlle best seasons
Grinnell College has ever had.

Many of us don’t realize the
hard work that these coaches
and players do. It takes many
hours oi hard practice totde—
velop a team such as the one
we had this year. More than
this, it takes a lot of desire on
the part or every individual. All
year, this team showed the re-
sults ot this hard work and
great team desire. Time and a.
gain, the last part ot the sea-
son, our team came rrom be»
hind to win, And when they
lost, it was not because or lack
ot desire.

We no longer have to make
excuses tor our football team
We don't have to say “Well.

We’re an intellectual school. not‘

a football school " Now We can
proudly say that We are both.

Along with being one ot the
most outstanding schools of
learning, we have good athletes
too. At Grinnell there is no
sucli thing as a “dumb iootball
player," and l think we can all
be proud of this, We combine

_ athletics with studies and come
out ahead in both. This is one
oi the many things that makes
Grinnell the great school it is.

The fact that Coach Bowers
inherited a team with a very
poor record and in. two years
built a championship team is
next to amazing. And he does
this without athletic scholar
ships!

Let's forget the big bomb and
the world situation {or a minute
and pay tribute to a good foot
ball team and a good coach.
Congratulations, coach and team

and let's get ’em again
next year.
Boll Shepherd

has becn the wording oi the
reterendum that took place
Monday, November lath. Every-
one i think should be against
atmospheric testing it proved
unnecessary and dangerous to
our health. But there was noth-
mg in the resolution that said
or hinted that it could be nece
essary, the implication being that
it was automatically dangerous
and unhealthrui The retereir
dum in my opinion was already
_setl.led before It was even voted
upon, The even more ridiculous
part oi the resolution asked if
you were in favor oi the U,S.S.R.
continuing its testing. That is
like asking the Soviets to be.
have themselves as betitting
good little comrades.

I am glad to know that these
pseudoelnlelleciuals would solve
the world's problems if given
halt a chance to do it their way.
I am further enlightened to
know that God has once again
given the Ten Commandments

to a chosen people.

by Ann Fetter

Nearly 300 persons attended a
rally last Fliday iright in the

wolncns gymnasium held by 13-

ot the M students who are now

the rally was to iniorm interest»
ed students oi the purposes be-'

port More than $200 was Col-
lected at the rally.

Mike l-lctrwatt, spokesman lor-
the group, opened the rally by

pose, He then gave a short talk,l
explaining more iully the mar
lives or the group. He also note
ed that reaction and interest on
and ol'i campus already had axe
cecdod their expectations and
this in itscli would make thel
trip worthwhile,

l-lorrvatt showed the students
a copy ol the “Des Moines
Tribune" which carried a iront
page story and picture ol the I
group. He added that these
were also being carried by

the wire services. ‘

in concluding his speech, Hol'-‘
watt said. “I would like to as-l
sure you that time and again we
have reconsidered our reasons
tor going; ‘15 it right that we,
should go" Had you been a
participant in the eight or ten
meetings lasting three to tour

Bayard Catron, who has
since joined the students in
their trip, presented a state—
ment signed by interested stu-
dents aiid iacnlty mcnlbcrs‘
outside the group, I

i

He introduced the speech by
saying, “I am here tonight to‘
present to you a Joint statement
iormulatcd and endorsed noti
only by interested students, iii-
cluding student government oiii-,
cials, but by members of the
Grrnncll college faculty. i

“Their individual positions are
mrrch broader than the scope oi
this statement and differ to a,

I
this statumcllt they have iound‘
a common basis or beliei."

The statement was signed by
(philosophy and
religion), Charles Cleaver (Eng
ish), .lill Dcnnlngton, Dan 17‘1ng
gins, Bill lialama, Carol Miller,
Linda Millerl

‘Dol‘othy Slnardaclc and Bayardi

Cdtron.

Explaining the content of the
statement. Catron emphaSlzed
the urgency and gravity oi the‘
international situation. “We haveI
been appalled by the idea that
students should not act uponl

these issues (the arms race, dis-
armament etc ) as .tudents. Wlio‘
is going to inherit this burden.-
some problem? Why are we bee
ing educated it it is not to relate
ourselves to the exterll al
world?" i

I
It was the responsibility ol‘

, liberally educated men and won

, men he continued, to take some

kind oi action against the apathy
that is all too prevalent in the
US. today. He s d that while
all would not agree with the
stand taken by the 14 Washing-
ton—bound students, they had
given a great deal ot thought to
the situation and concluded that
this was the only course of ac—
tion open to them.

Catron concluded by saying,
“It is extremely ditiicult to tace
the issues which have prompted
the concern of the students who
are going to Washington next
week. it you have tried conscien»
tiously to lace all positions
“lieadon” you know there are
no linal lacts which will bring
agreement ol views.

“The group which has signed
this statement has done so be—
cause we respect and admire
the considerations and sacritices
made by these students and we
support them in their concern
and responsible action."

Students Measure Radioactivity t:pESSn’ii‘iklﬁiplléi‘°tl
from Campus Rainwater Samples

by Staff Reporter

The radioactivity count of rain three to four times the highestl Dortunities of the

water samples taken on campus‘
has risen signiﬁcantly on at
least two dlﬁercnt occasions in;
the last several weeks, according
to Mike Schulhor, Cowles soph—i
more. i

Schullior is participating in a‘
radioactivity “monitoring pron,
grain" using a highly sellsitivo‘
scintillation counter. > The counts ,
do not approach “dangerous"
levels, however, Schulhof stress
ed.

He said the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
increase occurred Nov, 1, several‘
days after the Soviet 50-mega~',
ton nuclear explosion. A read-
ing or 450 micromicrocuries ovs
er the normal background count‘

or 1300 mmc’s was taken. l

Asecond substantial increase
was noted after last Monday’s l
rain. The count taken at that l
time was about 360 minc’s ‘
over the normal background 1

count.

Dr. william Sandman (phys-
icsl, adviser for the monitoring
program, made this comment on
the signiﬁcance of the increases:
“The increased radiation Counts
taken here are not significant
in that they forecast no imme-
diate effects which might Cause
biological damage. As to the
oiiects of increased radioactivity
in the area or genetics, no one
knows for sure yet—not cvcii,

Dr. Sandman, who lived in

proached laoo mmc’s over nor.

Mendoza Speaks
To Frosh Women 3

The last of a series of Semid

nars for freshman women Was‘
given Wednesday afternoon in
Main lounge by Guillermo
Mendoza (biology). Hss topic
was. “The Balanced Diet of Lib-
eral Arts.” l

Mendoza talked about the

purpose or a liberal education‘made for the annual Christmas,

and how a liberal arts college
differs from a specialized college.

Also participating in the disul
cussion was a pancl at three,
Grinnell women, They wcrcl

Barb Bczilci Myrna Sumption,1
and Hedda Haymond represent—l
ing thc sopbomorc, junior lind‘
senior classes. i

mal background count “This is

count we've taken here,” he
pointed out.

The monitoring program be-
gan in late October when
Schulhof, Jim Wolrson and
Don Wheeler started making
daily checks on the radioac—
tivity count in the atmosphere,
dust, ground and rain watch

l Counts monitored in rainwater

have been largest because
the rain droplets collect radio»
active dust particles as they
ran through passing dust
clouds

Data collected by the Grinnell
monitoring team has been cor—
roborated in part by informa-

tion received (rain the U 3.,

Weather Bureau conﬁrming the
presence of large dust clouds,

-possibly radioactive in the,

Grinnell area at the times the
count increases were reported.

Further information is being
sought from the Atomic Energy
Commission which will enable
them to convert their measure-
ments into terms such as roent-
gens, which are measurements
of actual bodily damage caused
by radiation.

The monitoring program will
be continued through next
spring when increased rainfall
is likely. ,

In 1929, the Pioneers finished their cfmpaign with a 5-1-2 mark,

Pioneer football coach Edd Bowers won the honor of doingt’
the best coaching job in Iowa this season, according to Buck Turne‘
hull of the ”Des Moines Register. ‘
Grinnell was also a hardsluck team, being only 1 minute 50‘
seconds and 3 points from an undefeated season In the Pioneers’
10-0 loss to C05. the Koshawks' winning field goal came with only.‘
15 seconds remaining. St, Olal scored with 1:35 showing on the

it was a week toi- upsets in college football, as four oirtlie-

In the Midwest Conference Cross—country meet last Saturday.
Jim Chesbro of Carleton, sprinting for 6th position, collapsed 50
feet from his goal. Undaunted, he pulled himself to his feet, and
staggered across the line in 22nd place. it took a great deal of
determination for him to run to complete exhaustion so near the
end, and even more guts to attempt to finish. 1

The Pioneers led the Midwest Conference in both the rushing
and total offense departments piling up 272 and 350 yards per
game, respectively. in each division. On the ground. Grinnell gains
ed 35 more yards per contest than their nearest rival, Coe. On
defense, the Pioneers ranked second behind Coe, allowing 201
yards in each game.
