The couple stated that there

' t '1)
by J. Joseph Okumu

The new age of political ad»
vanccincnt of African states
brought V\'l|.i‘i it tribal conscious-
ness in the scnse that these
tribcs wcrc indoctriiiated by
politicians into thinking that
they exist not only for social
and cultural purposes, but also
to play a leading part in na-
tional politics.

To achieve this end. politicians
organized their tribal unions in.
to Parliamentary constituencies
as a sure source of stable, loyal
votes for them. Very often these
mushroom unions became aifili<
ated to a national tribal union.
which later became part of a
political party led by a combina-
lion of political and tribal
heros.

These so-called national par
ties, very often with minority
members of Parliament in
them, go on to advocate tribal
states within the national
whole.

The National lndepcndent Par-
ty of Nigeria advocated dlu‘ing
the Nigerian Constitutional Cone
fersnce in London that the Cala-
bar, Ogoja and River Provinces
be made into a separate state.
Almost at the some time (1960)

2) To see a dnrstic modification of the college drinking

only witll regulation of where students may not drink (i. e

good of himself, his fellows and the college. We think

freedom before and have seen them respond iarortlbly to it.

These politicians have said
that their liberty as a minority
group can best be safeguarded
if they have their own state.
The truth is not that the polie
ticians are convinced that the
various tribes situntcd in a geo-
graphic region heve anything
to henclit from such a state.

On the contrary, they have
deceived their tribesmerl into
thinking that the creation of
their own state in the country
means freedom from the oppres»
sion of the larger groups. Some
schools of thought support this
line of thinking. However, the
more enlightened school has op.
posed the concept and is strug-
gling for an alternative.

Most ot the time, thcsc pole
iticians want to be masters
and thus welcome tribal slate
concepts. Very often electoral
propaganda, with “state crea~
tion" as a party slogan, be-
comes a possible means of
capturing votes for a politician

Roi'h +ells iirsi impressions

of Grinnell siuclenis, lid-sully

by Paul D. Samuel

l What are the impressions that
a person receives about Grin—
iiell College when he sees it tor
the first. ' aft leav-
ing a foreign .

does he think of the students,
the faculty and the facilities?
How does he feel in such strange
surroundingsl

A man in a position to know

the answers to these questions
is Dr. G'octz Roth, visiting pros
res r of political science at
Grinncll. Dr Roth comes from
Heidelberg, Germany, where he
is a professor at the "Inslllut
fur Fplillschc wissensehait."
' Roth arrived in Grinnell in
February and will stay until
the end of this semester, He is
teaching two courses dealing
with international politics and
politics of Germany

Gray-haired and friendly,
Roth is in his early forties.
His speech is heavily accent—
.ed. but easily understandablc.
neanswers questions pleas-
antly and openly,

“I have not been here long
enough to draw deep conclu»
slons,” Roth said upon being
asked to give his first impres—
sions of Grinnell. “But i can
say that I am very pleased with
the atmosphere of the school.
The facilities are very good,
especially the library. I have not
yet met all the faculty, but those
I have met have been friendly
and helpful. Professor Fletcher
of the political science depart»

. ment has been especially help-
rul.

“I am amazed and pleased at
the informality or contact here

between professors and students,

There is a lack of stiffness
which one does not find on the
Continent. The students, too,
have been very friendly, and i
am beginning to feel at home
already."

Roth had heard of Grinnell
through one ol his colleagues
in Heidelberg. Through this
man he began a correspondence
with Dr.
ually culminated in his invitation
to Grinneil as a visiting profes-
sor.

“But I have met other pet)»
ple abroad who have spoken
highly of Grinncll,” Roth saidr
In Europe, too, Grinnell
known as a line schoul."

That same year, he went into
the German navy. He served on
a destroyer in the Atlantic, and
from 1943 to 1945 commanded

a submarine in the Baltic Sea.’

Alter Germany's capitula—
tion Roth spent two years in
Great Britain as a prisonerrol-
war. While there. he studied

crnment and .the political sys»
tern of the Third Reich.
in 1947, he returned to Ger.
many and bccz'ime a student at
the University oi
where he studied

He specialized in prohienis oi
German post—war development
and received his PhD. in 1952,
Having taught at tile Institute,

Roth knows much about the
youth of postwar Germany,
“Alter the war," he explained,
"“the youth of Germany became
very skeptical and critical. They
were hard to inlluchce But this
was only on the surface. Basie
ally, they were idealists. Thcy
needed desperately to believe in
something after their world was
shattered. Deep down, they had,
and have today, a tremendous

lies,”

‘Gl'itlneii's Chief Librarian lleni-y
Alden and Bookstore Manager-
Samuel Wassom were asked to
comment on the problem or
‘bookstcaling on campus.

The disappearance of books
,froin the library is definitely a
problem according to Alden. “In
the past year," he commented,
"several thousand dollars worth
,of books and magazines have
disappeared permanently from
,library shelves.”

other types oi books to til
appear are those that prolcss-
ors have announced they are
planning to put on reserve and
books needed by students to
study tor examinations.

The worst thefts, according to
Alden, occurred two ye ago.
shortly after the library put»
chased a new set of the Ency-
elopcdra Britannica. when sev—
eral of the Volumesrdisappeared
and have not been found.

Whilc it is true. Alden said,
that oiten a student or professor
will abscnt-mindedly forget to
check a book out, these books
are almost invariably returned
and even so, the number of
-books to turn up missing is too
lgreat to believe that they were
:all taken unintentionally.

it

’i Alden expressed a degree oi

isurprisc about the whole situae
illon because, as he 'aicl, book
check out and rencyi l proced

llLiI‘ES are so simple, It is sufli

cicnt for a student merely to

"call the library to renew a book

Goctz Roth

'1! necessary illc book can be res
inewed indefinitely until ,somes
one else needs it.

Even if inrs rig books could
be replaced, “I r is quite
oltcn impossible as many of
the books are out of print, they
can never be replaced in time
for a needed purpose, not to

- speak of the great cost of time
and money such replacement
requires. “For every book we
are forced to replace," Alden
said, “we must subtract
money ironi our budget which
could have been used to buy a

new lliluk."
What then, can be done to p
vent the di, ippearancc ol boo
from the libidry? ii the pro
problem does not get any oer—
tor the library may be fore l,
as much as it dislikes to, to in-
stall turnstiles or guards at [he
exits,

However, Alden expi‘esed the
opinion that the Student G
ernment could set up .maehinev'y
whereby ii a student knew ol
another student poscssrng (i.
brary books illegally he could,
without acting as an iniol‘mcr,
let some member of the SGA
know. “It at all possible, we wa it
to avoid using guards or Lum—
stiles." Alden said. "since the H14
stailation of such devices scr—
iously hampers the liberal act—
dernic feeling necessary in a li—
brary."

Bookstore manager Wassom,
asked the same question about
the problem of book caling, said
that in the bookstores case steal-
ing was not a ma, problem.
“While Tm sure that . me stc
ing takes place," he said, -'
definitely minor.”

Of course stealing, when it
occurs, is not coniined solely E0
books but also to other objects
such as pens, etcr Small objects
are most likely to be stolen. The
reason for the lack of mar
stealing problem can be attrib
ed to the use of turnstiles and
the shelves provided for the stu-
dents’ books and parcels neoc
the store door. (Customers 2
expected to place all books aid

South Africa 7 Historical Dis
lcnnna," the f11st in a series of
foul lectures on Afiican affairs
was presented by R. B Ballin

ling Hay. -Whitney pr .
-on Wednesday 111 Her-
rick chapel.

Balhnger, who served as lcc-
turer in history at the Univeiu
sity of the Witwater ‘and 111
Johannesburg, South Attica, has
also been an executive member
of the South African Institute
"of Race Relations, serving as
chairman of the publications
board for the institute.

Sketching briefly the history
'of South Africa, he discussed
'the beginnings of the presents
'day Capetown Provmce, as
'established by settlers of the
Dutch East India Company 111
'1652. From the early problems
of cultural and religious gulfs
to isolation and domination by
whites, Ballinger traced the de-
velopment of the four South
African provinces —— Cape Col-
ony, Natal, Orange Free State
'and Transvaal.

. Historically significant in the
evolution of current South

African attitudes was the

meeting of native tribesmen,

Bantus, with the Dutch far.mcr

The mobility of the natives,

moving further and further

away from the settled farmer
- by Capetown, helped create
two separate societies early in

South African history.

According to Balhngcr, the
,Trek Boer was a “law unto him-
self' with an intense belief in
limitless land. the use of Afri-
gaanse as native language. and
the desire to avoid governmental
intertcl'ence. His society was
never touched by the enlighten-
rncnt, liberalism, or industrial
revolution evident in 18th and
19th century Europe.

The Cape Province people,
developing from the original
mixture of Hotentot, Malay and
white blood, provided the urban
population which was greatly
affected by the British occupa-
tion beginning in 1806.

Further sketching the de-
velopment of British influence
in South Africa, Ballinger relat»
ed incidents of the Great Trek
of 1836-38, when great numbers
of the Boer populace rounded
the eastern frontiers and set up
the free states — Transvaal and
Orange Free State. In-this light
be illustrated the growth of in-
tense African independent zeal
and the ideal of republicanism

Concluding the historical sum-
mary, he discussed the people's

opositlfm to participation in the A

World Wars as a denial of sov-
ereignty and the convention of
South Africa which set up each
state as a province with its own
franchise.

Since the union of South
African states in 1948, Bailin.
gcr cited three spectacular
developments affecting the ter-
ritory — 1) the industrial rev-
olution, 2) the urban revolu-
tion \vhirh was accentuated by
the “poor white" problem,

Hay Whitney v iting p1ofcsso1
spoke 111 He; irlc chapel Wed-
nesday on “South Airica: Apart-
held," the second 111 a series of
{our lectures on South Africa.

He concerned himself in [he
lecture with the origin of the
term “apartheid" us applying to
the separation OI race: and its
implications in Africa today. He
sald that the term, originated by
the NailO-‘I'llISL party. may have
different meanings.

A11 understanthng South
African history SinCC 194B is
necessary for a comprehension
of the connotations of “(wars
lheld.”

Ballinger explained that the
population or South Africa
consists of about 3,100,000
whites, -of which 39 per cent
speak English; 500,000 lnrtians;
about 1,500,000 colored persons
who lack lrihftl tics; and about
ten million Bantu Africans,
some of Whom are in white
urban industrial centers, some
in “native reserves,” and some
in the rest of the country
working on rural European
(arms.

In 1948 (:10 Nationalists, a par-
ty of Afrikaanci’s (South Airl—
cans of Dutch descent), came to
power. They hlld thought that
white supremacy in South Afrir
ca was about to collapse, as
Bantus had been coming into
the white “industrial complex-
CS," bu 11g shanty towns and
working there, The old laws
governing noanul‘opeans were
believed to be outmoded.

The Nationalists thought that
a new policy was needed to
strengthen the racial scpalation.
wnh the s gun, “Sul'c White
South All a,” they \ton the
election and crme to power.

The Nauonaiists put' through
lcgislauon to further their sep-
arate development idcas: laws
to prevent mixed marriages,
laws to provide separate educar
tion, laws stopping court cases
based on the ~rd ”separate”
meaning ”scparule but equal"
They did not have to reverse
former trends, said Ealhngcr.
but only “buttress" them.

Ballinger said he believes
the “development of reserves ’
is an absolute essential" on[
humanitarian and economic
grounds, but impractical as a
permanent means at future
development.

At present there are many
problems involved. There is a‘
lack of space on reserves for the

iowing quotation tossed to me byl
a Ghana rcgionalist disciple in
the course of a long interview
with him, should reveal more
of what i have described above:

“Power is the most impor- l
tant thing in the world. It I
represents health, strength,
cleanliness, and generosity, as I
conspicuously as the want of
it is the very root of dirt,
weakness and iiisiiiccrit It
tortiiics men who have it in i
the same way in which it de— l
bases those who desire to get
it but are unable to reach it.
To these pcople it is only a ,
dream. I used to dream of ‘
power — I don't need to now
— all that is necessary is to
devise ways or maintaining
it."

Many are the conclusions I,
have deduced irom this. You Cani
turn in into whichever meaningl
you care to give it. You may
evcn contemplate it until you
drop. th the way of theoriz-
ing it is not the way ci prac-
tiring it. Days,‘ months, and cveiil
