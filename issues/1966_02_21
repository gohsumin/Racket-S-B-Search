What's Expected

Today Steve Kent was elected SGA president. He
was elected by a huge margin,

Throughout the campaign Kent and the other can-
didates have spoken of lack of student involvement. It
became the key word of the election.

New Kent is faced with the problem of taking this
”Catch phrase” and turning it into some kind of work—
ing reality. His first step will be a questionnaire to find
out where the students interest is. Beyond this, what
Kent can do is a question with which we are all con-
cerned.

The lack of student involvement, according to
Kent during the election, was in part the fault of the
Goddard administration. This is a strong criticism and
we think it is important that as Kent takes office he
keeps it in mind.

It is the duty and responsibility of the SGA presi—
dent to evoke student response. He cannot find safety
in saying I can’t do anything because the student body
is apathetic. During the next few months we shall
watch and hope that Kent has some method of stimu-
lating Grinnell students, of lifting them from their
state of profound apathy. If he can’t do this then the
words of his own campaign will most assuredly come
back to haunt him — from both Goddard, who knows

how difficult a task that is, and from the 5&8, who
doesn’t know it for sure but Who suspects it strongly.

 

It Only Took Two

Convention Ballots

Saturday's convention ended rather abruptly with only two ballots.
The first or instructed ballot was almost totally jag since 161 votes were
cast for unconventional candidates and were thus termed uncommitted
0f the actual candidates running. “We love you" Er Brow won 36 votes
followed by Wittgrai with 30, Shender with 21 and Kent with 15,

The second and rinal ballot was taken more seriously and became a

whirl oi changing votes in the last few minutes.

dsSlionderDelegutionlendsSupport

By PAUL BRADLEY

Steve Kent today was elected
SGA President.

Thus ended a hectic weekend for
Steve Kent which began with the
nominating speeches in Saturday's
convention In their speeches all
three students nominating Kent
emphasized their candidates past
achievements but again reiterated
the campaign theme oi student in»
Volvement.

Nord Brue gave a delailed ac-
count of Kent’s active role in
college aiiairs, while Dorothy
Dosse spoke oi how “99 percent
talk or active strident govern-
ment, but only one percent ac-
tually do the hard work i
valved,” and that “encamp-
ments are useless unless some-
body is willing to do the work

Non-Subtle Humor

Provides Respite
From Campaign

Kicking up a clcurl oi peanut
shells and sawdust, Grinnell
plunged into the political arena
with the sen convention Saturday.

Although the Main Hall Sisters of
Salvation and Road's seamen of
the as Slo-Come proved avid
demonstrators, the backers of E.
Brow, the “intellectual” candidate,
exhibited the greatest degree of
student involvement and enthiisi»
asm during the course oi hot cam<
paigning and parleying.

Kris Nash, in his nomination
speech, succinctly stated E.
Brow's platiorm and qualifica-
tions: “He is not winning as a
member of Honor G, he is not
running as a representative and
employee oi SAGA roads, but as
a grosspolitician in support oi
intellectuals on campus."

As tar as the ﬁrst balloting
went. some of the more success-
iul attempts at wit included:

One vote to the South preps (ls
it true blondes really have more
fun?)

One vote to the William Penn
boys. who seem to think that
Grinnell is where the action is

Two to the departed members of
Read Hall, who had to leave in
order to Show that Grinnell has
not yet gone to pot

One vote to the last visible testi-
mony of Carl Otis Gray, the bad
check list in the Book Store

One vote to the Rex, the campus
retreat from the Pepsi generation

One vote to the boys in the bot—
tom half of their class

Two votes to the CIA and two
votes to AP.

ED NOTE: I’d like to take
this npportuniiy Io thank the
people who helped us put out
[his special issue of the 5&3.
John Turek and the rest of the
people at the Newton Daily
News — the people who print
the 5&3 —- were more than co-
operative. Henry Wilhelm, co-
ediinr of the Cyclone, assisted
John Wait and lne in covering
the convention photographicnlly
and in editing the over 600
pictures that we look. A special
thanks to the election board for
making Ihe results available to
us so rapidly.

 

required after the encampment
is finished,"

Finally Ray Horn spoke on the
task of Student government for “if
student government proves to the
student body that it can get re-
sults, only Ihen will the students
really become involved in campus
issues." Horn ended the Kent
nominations with, “Only elfeclive
student leadership can give ellec—
tive student government. VOTE
FOR STEVE KENT! !”

During the early part or Ihe
balloting, hopes in the convention
were not very high for Kent,
especially when he only received
ﬁfteen votes on Ihe ﬁrst ballot,
the lowest of the three candi-
dates. As preparations were be-
ing made by Kent’s iloor cam-
paigners for the second roll call,
the estimate for his strength
was around so delegates. How-
ever, as me second roll call
progressed and every hall gave
their votes it soon became ap-
parent rhat Kent and Witlgraf
were on their way to an easy
Victory.

 

When it became apparent that
Wiltgral and Kent were Ihe lu'u
victors, Steve shender, the third
candidate, appeared on the plat-
form to concede victory, Shen-
der thanked his workers for ties
voting so much lime to his cause
and said, “I didn't believe lhnl
anybody could get people fired."
In conceding victory, Steva
threw his support behind another

Candidate, "I don't think there’s

any doubt in onyone’s mind who
should be the next SGA President.

I support Steve Kent for the Pres-
idency."

Afterwards Kent said that he
was very happy about the con—
velllilnl results, and said, “1 am
thankful ior Shender‘s support,
it’s going to be a diiiicult ﬁght.”
Kent made one iinal request,
“Send people to me C of HP,
the AWS Bnal‘d and the senate
who are willing and active and
alert, and i think i can promise
you an son with a record oi
accomplishment diiiicult to
equal."

 

Wiilgraf Emerges from Conflict
Wilh lag of level-Headed Realist

By MARTHA BERKEY

George Wittgrai came out oi the
convention with solld support and
enough votes ior nomination on
roll call of [he first serious bal-
lot.

Wittgraf’s sound platiorm oi
student — faculty cooperation was
echoed in his nominating and sec-
ondlng speeches. In his speech or
nomination. Dick Reichmann
called for "a carefully reasoned
program oi student action.”

Reichmann characterized Witt-
graf‘s program as not only con-
taining “21 series or speciﬁc, pra-
gmatic goals attainable in the
immediate future," but also having
“the further merit of introducing
student opinion as a vital motor
in determining the policies oi the
college.”

Secondlng speeches were made
by Anne Hogansun, Jan Streiii,
and David Lighthourne.

Miss Hoganson stressed Wilt<
grai's record oi achievement and
his “realistic, practical steps to a
feasible goal,” While Miss Streiff
urged students to support Wiltgrai
(or a “government With students
rather than above students."

Lightboume drew a laugh irorn
the crowd as he said, “My iasci-
nation with personality politics
and SGA gamesmanship rises to
active disenchantment only when
it manages to escape proiound
apathyr"

 

Lighthourne saw that—whatever
the future course of SGA—“our
one prime consideration” must be
[0 choose “that candidate who can
carry on level-headed relations
with the administration on a daily
basis." He therefore supported
Wittgraf as “a candidate With the
intelligence and imagination to
conceive oi SGA in an entirely
new way. a candidate with the
impetus to broaden the base at
student participation in this com-
munity."

As the voting came in, Wittgrat
carried three halls completely and
had a substantial majority in
three more. Kent carried one hall
and had good support Irom others;
Shender Carried two halls. Then
vote switching began. Cowles
changed from 100 per Cent back-
ing oi E. Brow to substantially
Kent support Shender lost his two
halls, and was obviously on the
way out.

Rather than be graciously voted
out, however, Shender got up to ,
throw support to Kent and a little
mud to Wittgrai. His unexpected
method or withdrawing put a
peculiar twist on the mob enthusi—
asm and a peculiar end to the
convention. Later. Wittgral said,
"it's too bad. Personal antagon-
isms will build up over this which
will last for months; and in the
meantime, people will forget all
about SGA within a week.”

Shender Throws

Support to Kent

As Convention Stands and Cheers

By ANN KIRSCHNER

"I lived with both of them this
Bummer and I know which man I
think can best lead student govern
Item.“

That was Steve Shender’s part—
ing shot to the SGA convention
Saturday. Shender was the candi-

"Le who was eliminated Irom the
running by the convention

Shender went into Saturday’s
convention with the support of

1ilh Hall, most of Main, half of
Dibble, and most of West, Shend-
er's own hall.

Gets Twenty-One Votes

Although the first ballot was jag,
Shender got 21 serious votes, nine
less than Wittgrat and six more

an Kent. The tension grew dur-
ing the secondvand last—ballot.
Half-way through the voting hall
after hall switched their v o t e s
from Shender to the other two
candidates Just after West Norris
swung its twelve Shender votes to
Kent, Jerry Goddard recognized

liender himself.

As he approached the lectern, the
convention rose to its feet and
gave him long, loud applause.

’ Shender spoke briefly, He said,
“At the beginning of the week I
didn’t believe anyone else could do
the job, but over the week i reale
ized that there is only one person
I want [0 see at the head of SGA
next year, and that is—Steve Kenti
I will give to him all my support
and I ask you to do the same”

Rims Underdog Campaign

“Most of Steve’s support was
outside the convention. We ran an
underdog campaign that reached
its peak Thursday night, but most
or the Bucks supporters switched
to Kent and Wittgraf, and that is
when we started to lose ground.
Steve would have had a much
greater chance in a popular pri-
mary" That was the opinion of
Steve Johnson, Shender’l carn-
psign manager.

Junior Ron Gatton gave the
nominating speech for Shender. He
asked “Will student government

continue to be Ineffective, insensi-

become a viable representation of

He went on to say that Shender
would best fulfill the main pur-
poses oi an S.G.A. president: cre-
ating and sustaining active cone
com, and fostering good relations
with the administration,

otters Dynamism, Action

Gatton said that only when ser«
ious concern and popular support
are shown‘ do committees and
diplomacy take on meaning.
“Steve offers dynamism that pro-
mises action and accomplishment.
He will raise and clarify issues,
not bury them in a stiﬂing, bureau-

argue, if Bucks and Shender had
both been in the running, both
would have come from convention,

There were several manuevers
during the convention that bear
noticing.

At one point, Steve Johnson, who
was the head oi the Dibble deler
gation and who also managed
Shender's campaign, reported that
his delegation was 9-1 for Shender.
A polling was demanded and it was
learned that the actual vote at the
Dibble delegation was five for
Wittgrai, two for Kent and two for
Shender (see page iour).

ris delegation reported themselves

Alum Named as New Vice President;
Will Aid in College's Long-Range Plans

A 37 year old Grinnell graduate
has been named Vice President
for planning and development at
Grinnell. The announcement of
Russell w. Fridley's appointment
to that position was made this at-
ternoon by President Glenn Leg-
gett.

Fridley, who will join the Staff
May 1. will act as administrative
supervisor of public relations, de-
velopment and alumni departments.
In addition, he Will Work with
Leggett and Dean James H. Stauss
in long-range institutional plan-
ning, both physical and academic,

The position that Fridley will fill
is not the same one that Merritt
Ludwig now occupies. Ludwig, who
is a vice president, announced

January 14 that he was resigning
in order to take a job at the Uni-
versity of lowa. Fridley’s position
ls something of a combination of
Ludwig’s job and the job held by
John McFarland, a vice president,
who resigned last year. Ludwig
has acted as business manager of
the college, a duty that Fridley
will not handle. The position of
business manager of the college
and perhaps another position in
the development area are still open.

Fridley graduated from Grinnell
in 1950, has been associated with
the Minnesota Historical Society
tor the past 13 years, serving as
director or the society since 1955
Fridley is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, studied at Columbia Uni-

versity as a Lydia Roberts groom
ate fellow and received a Gi‘inneII
College Trustees Award for Merit
in 1957‘

“We are fortunate to obtain I
man 0! Mr. Fridley's exceptional
qualifications,” Leggett said, "A:
an alumnus, he has a thorough
knowledge of the aims and objec-
tives of the college. His adminis-
trative duties With the Minnesota
Historical Society complement his
educational background and qual-
ity him admirably ior his new
responsibilities at Grinnell."

Fridley, who is listed in “Who’l
Who in the Midwest" and “Who's
Who in Minnesota," to the author
of several books concerning Minna
sota.

ead and Shender’s campaign

Throughout the campaign,
from all of the candidates.
Jerry Goddard was blasted
for running a “non-student
government,” for excluding
vast numbers from SGA, for
accomplishing little. Goddard
chaired the convention Satur-
day and, through the myriad
of posters and placards (left),
he can be seen smiling. God~
dard, who came to head SGA
unopposed, did not have to go
through a convention.

Goddard will retire from
office at the start of spring
vacation. During his term in
office he saw reorganization
of the Senate and faced an in-
herited financial crisis from

An SGA convention is hard on a can-

his house presuient’s suite in North Younk-

out the window. Meanwhile, in Darby, his
supporters weren’t having a much easier
time. Chris Swanson, who spent much of

as she rested for a moment, her head lean-
ing against a placard for “George." Witt-
graf made it out of convention by an un-
official margin of four votes. Wittgraf got
100 votes. Ninety-six were needed. The
needed votes came mostly from halls
changing from Shender to Wittgraf. Some
observers feel that the turning point came
when West Norris reported 13 votes for
Shender and a poll of the delegates re
vealed that one vote went for Wittgraf.
West Norris is Shender's hall.
