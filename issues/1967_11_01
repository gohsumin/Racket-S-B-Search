KING PREACHES AWAKENING

By SUE MILLER

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
delivered his Sunday sermon to
a capacity audience of almost
4,000 in Darby Gymnasium.

Delayed by ﬂight trouble
en route from Chicago, King
arrived one hour past me
scheduled sermon time at
10:45.

King, ”a prophet in the twen-
tieth century“ according to
Benjamin Mays, “is one who
does not seek popular causes,
but right ones."

”Few men in our time," the

‘President Emeritus of More—-

house College slated, are “as
persuasive and as consistent
in pointing out the social injus-
tices and modern issues of our
day."

King apologized tor his com-
ing in on a “dash-in, daslwut
basis," but said he must face
ﬁve more days of jail (his 19th
jail sentence) as a result of his
action in the 1963 Birmingham
movement which brought about
the Civil Rights legislation of
1964.

Speaking or “Remaining A-
wake Through 8. Revolution,"
King compared Rip Van Winka
le's predicament to our own.

His zoycar long nap has par-
tially obscured a more import-
ant issue or the story~that or
sleeping through a revolution,
King said.

Rip Van Winkle, who passed
a picture of King George III at
England when he climbed the
mountain to sleep, King said,
came down to find that George
Washington’s picture was
there.

We are today who are finding
ourselves in a great period of so-
cial change, but who (all to de
velop a new attitude and men.
tal outlook of the social order,
The challenge today, he stated,
is to develop and maintain a
world perspective; any individ
ual .. or nation — today that
feels. he can live alone is sleep-
ing through a revolution.

“Although: we have made of
the world a neighborhood. we
have not yet developed the ethi-
cal wmmitrnent to make it n
brotherhood."

All mankind is caught up In
the “inescapable network of
mutuality." King said, “and
whatever ailects one directly,
affects all indirectly."

“Each of us lives in two
worlds, the Within and the With-
out, by which we live, gov-
em our religious and spiritual
‘within.’ We must," K i n g
concluded, “never let the means
{or which we live outdistance
the ends for which we live,”

We “must struggle passion
Ately and umelentingly to get
rid at every aspect oi racial
injustice," King continued, or
we Will bring “the current of
doom down on civilization."

HONORARY DEGREES
FOR TWENTY-ONE

Several irregularities in the
traditionally tedious ceremony
changed the tone or the Sunday
afternoon termination of Grin~
hell's Super - Weekend with an
Academic Convocation for the
awarding of Honorary Degrees
in Darby'Gym.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,
was given his Honorary Doc-

. torate of Humane Letters first

(out of alphabetical order) be
cause he had a pressing en-
gagement in Atlanta. Marshall
McLuhan Was conferred his
Honorary Doctor of Letters in
absentia because of illness.
Movie cameras ostentaciously
began whirling as Ashley Mon—
tagu received his Honorary
Doctor of Science. Robert
Rouschenberg was wearing a
flaunty pink tie and Calvin
Plimpton had to duck so that
Professors Mendoza and Dur-
kee could place his hood on
him.

in his introductory remarks,
Ric MacDowell, President of
SGA. commented that the con-
vocationees had honored Grin-
nell College by being here so
we honor them, The twenty-
one recipients oi Honorary De-
grees new are the “Doctors of

the Class oi 1967, Grinliell Col-

MONTAGU CALLS FOR
JOHNSON'S IMPEACHMENT

Alter dubbing the Vietnam
War “the most immoral and il<
legal conflict in the history of
America," Princeton, New Jer-
sey anthropologist Ashley Mona
tagu informed a capacity
crowd in ARI-l auditorium Sun-
day that President Johnson
“ought to be impeached.“

“1968 is the moth anniversary
or the impeachment of the irrst
president Johnson," Montagu
told an estimated 550 students,
visitors, and tacuity members
at Sunday’s Vietnam Rally.

“And i suggest to you that it
would be a good idea to pro-
ceed with the publishing 0i
grounds for the impeachment
of the second President John-
Son.”

Montagu outlined eleven
points as grounds tor the im-
peachment of Johnson:

1. “Violation of U. N. Char-
ter, which says that one can
legitimately only use force
against armed attack."

2. “Violation of OAS Treaty
which says that states cannot
intervene in the affairs of other
peoples without consultation."

3. "The assumption by the
executive oi unprecedented
powers for determining policy.
. . Johnson is waging a war
without a declaration of war.”

4, “Outraging the Geneva
Conventions In the use of na-
palm, the treatment ot prison<
crs, area bombing. . ., the
heating of tunnels to 1000 de-
grees to kill Viet Cong.

5. “The outraging oi the
Hague Conventions of 1399 and
1907 which speclly the rules or
war."

6. ”The breaking Oi the Ge«

7. “The complete disregard
of the principles and declara-
tions of the Nuremberg Trial.
which stated that the greatest
crime against mankind was the
waging oi an illegal war."

8. “The bombing of Cambodia
and Laos."

9. “Presence of our troops in
Bolivia."

m “The use of power promis-
cuously."

ll. "Malversation in a posi.
tion or trust."

Montagu concluded his shot!
address pointing to “the harm
this one man has done."

Montagu also gave a lecture
in Darby gym Saturday on
“Race, Science, and Humani-
ty." “Until we can regress the
wrongs we've done in educa.
tion and sociological prob-
lems," Montagu iniormed, “we
won't serve the race problem,
the human problem."

Also a keynote speaker at
the rally, sponsored by tho
Grinuell Student Movement
and its Vietnam Committee,
was Yale drama protessor and
critic Richard Gllman.

“You are a generation with
a social Consciousness, and that
is rare.” Gilman told tho
crowd. “I hope you don’t lose
it.”

Montagu and Gilmnn were in-
Lroduoed by Chairman of the
Faculty Joseph Wall. SGA
President Ric MacDowell also
addressed the rally.

Professor Ezra Mendelsohn
(history) told the rally crowd
that the peace rally was “like
it tootball rally."

“My friends already agree
with me, and my enemies won’t
be persuaded here," be ‘con.

. eluded.

The Sunday- atternoon meet-‘
ing was presided over by Viet-
nam Committee’s Ron Miller.

Over five hundred students
signed the GSM’s anti-war po-
tition, according to Miller.

Montagu, Gilmali, and about
40 iaculty members signed,
stating that the war was "rm.
moral in its useless destruction
oi human lives. . ."

The last signature on the pe-
tition, a GSM representative
told the rally, “is Martin Luth-
er King Jr."

The rally was origin-any
scheduled to be held on Barber
Plaza 12:30 - 1:30 Sunday. In<
clement weather and the late
arrival of Dr. King forced the
GSM to move it to ARE tol-
lawlng the special chapel serv-
ice in Darby Gym.

A POP IN THE CORN

We enjoyed Convocation. We didn’t enjoy the lines, the score
of the football game. the early ending of a rather undanceable
Dance, or having Saga workers and Requiem people miss many

events.

But for most people, most 01 the time, there was something

to learn, to amuse. to move.

Convocation knocked Grinnell off its usual apathetic strlde. ‘

Students reacted to the change. The Peace‘Raliy was an exciting
successr Offrcampus parties ﬂourished. We lived a different life

. . r for three days.

in a week or so, Convocation will just be a memory: I heard
this one, talked to that one, got drunk with the other.

It was it oneshot thing. A big pop in the corn.

We’d better get back to the books . . .

A STUDENT OPINION

ENLIGHTENMENT FROM OONVO

By HERBERT U. PEGUES

one historian has said, “it is
historical fact as well as bio-
logical theory that the past—of
ten the distant past—lives on in
the present."

This resounding idea hung
over the heads of hundreds this
past weekend. Some ignored it;
to others it was a shocking re-
ality, and still others, a true
awareness

The historical links were put
beinre you so plainly. i need
not repeat the slavery of the
Negro and countless injustices
toward him for some 348 years.
These in a nutshell are facts
that have bred the forms of
racial uproar in America to
hay.

This is why the Negro thinks
the way he thinks, this is why
he lives the way he does, and
this is why he revolts the way

he does. Hopefully you know
all Americans, both black and
white, suffer the consequences
oi past and present "America
the free."

Admittedly. there are some
redeeming tactors. We can 0v»
ercome the grim historical re~
minders, or at least lessen
their severity, by reevaluating
our value system. Salvation
lies in your own mind. Wisdom
is a wonderful thing.

out in all your getting, you
must get understanding. All of
you really needed those racial.
1y oriented topics or the Con-
vocation, if just for peace of
mind. The intellectual Grinnell,
with the rest of America, can-
not rise above itself without un-
derstanding, the God — given
rights of all humanity. All men
are equal, as human beings,
under the sun.

loclal progress is that legisla-
Iion cannot change people's
morals; you have to change
the heart. “The law cannot re-
strain the heartless, but it can
prevent them from lynching
me,” the Baptist mlnis~
ler mused.

The last myth assumed by
the sleepers, is that the Negro
can lift himself by his boot~
straps. Like the other imml~

ant groups coming tn the

.S., the Negro should be able
10 help himself.

“No other group has had
their color made a social stig-
ma. It is a cruel last to tell a
bootless man to lift himself up
by his bootstraps."

Riots, King cited, are neith-
er the most practical nor the
most moral way But condemned

The next issue of the 5&5

People today seem more con-
cerned with “quietude, and
the status quo, than to help ni-
leviate them"

The immorality oi the Viet-
Nam war, and the possibility
of its leading to a third World
War constituted King‘s next
comment.

in justifying his link between
the civil rights and the anti-
war movements, King said that
it is silly to be concerned about
integrated schools, and not be
concerned about the survival
01 the world to be integratedl

“These people are maladjust-
ed in society, but there are cer-
tain aspects of society that
should always merit maladjust-
meni.

Jesus Chlist was maladjust-
ed when he stated that “he who
lives by the sword shall perish
by the sword," King concluded.

lution, should be created the

I would like to comment
briefly on Mr. Marquardt's and
Mr. Tice‘s column in the Oct.
27 5&3. They refer to the seven
required courses envisioned in
the Curriculum Report as “lec-
ture courses.”

Even a hasty reading of the
report indicates, in my opinion,
that most required courses
would be taught in small sec-
tions, The proposed Humanities
course, for example, would
continue the work of the pres-
ent one, which is now taught
in sections averaging 18 stu-
dents. Emphasis in this course
is on literary analysis in depth
through the frequent writing of
papers which are thoroughly
criticized by the instructor,
and through conferences. (1
can testify that l have had stu~
dents in that course who ap-
proached literature in greater
depth than did some juniors
and seniors; hence I would
never call the course vague
and impersonal.)

Likewise the language cours-
es envisioned in the report (as
those now taught) would be of-
fered in small sections; and
the Social Studies and Humani-
ties In (Fine Arts) course!
would also involve work done
in sections.

1 am not here defending the
specific proposals of the re-
port; but I thought it might be
usetul to have someone not
connected with the committee
point out what seems to be a
factual inaccuracy in the col-
umn of Mr. Marquardt and Mr.
Tice.

that this became a red letter

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Neil Fitch!

Conscientious administrators and functionaries are constantly
doing their duties here at Grinneil.

They protect college property from misuse and abuse

They keep the college running . . . like water , . . m‘ It ,
machine

Their public relations techniques for improving the Grinnell
image are timeless and without measure.

Someday I’d like to swing a column in their praises. But this
week they ought to be cut down.

Somewhere in the midst of their concern for college prop-
erty and their concern for Grinnell P.R.. they have lost nil
concern for the general welfare of the students who live here.

Convocauon offered a case or two in point:

Now it's nice to feed all the trustees on time. and it's nice to
make a good impression on the alumni.

But it‘s even nicer to reed Saga workers, and It the Quad
that simply didn’t happen during Super Weekend.

"By the time we had time to eat." one Quad waiter told me,
"all that was left were a few stale Danish pastries, I had to miss
three meals straight so I could help lat alums feed their faces.”

One hell of a lot of Saga workers and Verdi Requiem par.
formers were finagied into weekend work and rehearsal scheduler
precluding any benefit from Convocation.

“Martin Luther King got to see more of Grinneli Convocation
than i did," a student Requiem singer stated, “and he was only
here a few hours,"

Said another Quad worker. “Some girls worked breakfast all
morning. were given a whole half-hour for I break, and then had
to work lunch for two hours"

Lack of admirdstrative concern for student welfare, horr-
ovtr, isn’t just an accident or one busy weekend.

About two weeks ago, Cleveland freshman Louise Peick had
the misfortune to trip and cut the side of her head open in the
Forum music room.

Witnesses said they thought she was about to go into shock,
In they made her lie down on the floor.

And we all know what happens when you lie down on the
floor in the Forum.

Immediately the forces of concern (for college property, that
in) surged into action

The "Forum Lady" -— that is to say. the lady who work:
the desk and makes people keep their shoes on and sit up straight
(the epithet has the same connotation as "Avon Lady" or “Fullei
Brush Man”) — instantly arrived to console Louise.

Quoth the “Forum Lady," according to one witness:

“I’m sorry you cut your head open, but could you please
try not to bleed on my carpet?”

Quoih Louise: “I really wasn’t thinking about where I was
bleeding at the time.” ’

I understand that college telephone operators are just it little
busier these days than they were at the beginning of November
last year.

They are busy because they are still looking up telephone
numbers for students.

They are still looking up telephone numbers for students
because the Herd Books haven’t been printed yet.

”Why haven’t the Herd Books been 11th yet?” you
nsk. “Why aren‘t the new 1937-68 analogues out yet?”

Well, yoii know. I’d ask Mrsr Prescott over in Public Rela-
tions about that, but I’m afraid she‘s still a little tired from
pumping out Convocation schedules, Convocation programs. Com
vocation booklets, and Convocation news releases.

But now that Super Weekend is bagged, maybe she can work
I little on something to help students here —like a catalogue or I
herd book.

Now that the slums are gone, maybe Sage will have time
to feed Saga workers too.

Now that the college is a college again and not just I
convocation cluster, maybe it can begin looking out for its
college students.

Anyway, if you crntlr your skull in the Forum try to keep
your blood off the carpet, will you? Because they’ll probably
raise my tuition to pay 3er for cleaning it up.

FOOTBALLERS FOILED

By JEFF SCHECKTER

Grinnell lost its filth football
game at the season during
Homecoming Weekend. A
capacity crowd withstood the
cold winds to watch the Pio-
neers forge ahead 15-14, only to
lose it all in the fourth quarter,
29-l5.

Once again, the game illus-
trated how the lack of depth
has hurt the team. wiui only
35 men, Coach Bowers is forced
to play men both ways. Despite
the fine physical condition of
the team, it is impossible for
them to play at their peak the
entire game. This results in the
collapse of the defense in the
last quarter and is the direct
cause of at least three Pioneer
losses.

Grinnell opened the scoring
in the first period when Doug
Fink passed to Mike Schwartz
for a 60 yard scoring play.
from Russell kicked the poinia
atter~touchdown and Grinnell
led, 7-D.

Monmouth tied the score late
in the quarter with Tony Por-
ter carrying the ball in from
the six to cap a fourteen play
drive. Larry Motzer kicked the
extra point. Monmouth scored
again in the second quarter,
sending Chuck Corie over from
the two. Motzer's kick was
good and Monmouth led, 141

Grinnell ended the first half
scoring with Brian Barnes run-
ning the ball into the end zone
and Pink passing to Schwartz
to put Grinnell ahead, 15-14.

An exciting halftime program
was presented under the di-
rection of Miss Mary Jones of
the Alumni OfiiCe, After the
Coronation of Cindy Root as
Homecoming Queen, Miss Jones
led the parents in physical ex~

 

 

erciseu requesting the rising of
parents living east of the Mir-
sissippi; parents living west oi
the Mississippi; parents living
in Minnesota who hadn't heard
of the Mississippi; parents who
had students at Grinnell; and
students at Grinnell who were
parents, The only thing mlss«
ing at the show was a prize for
the oldest parent west of the
Mississippi,

Fortunately, the teams re«
turned and put an end to all
such activities The score re-
mained 15~14 throughout the
third quarter and things looked
good {or the Pioneers. This fecl<
ing quickly disappeared in the
fourth quarter as Porter scored
from the two, giving Monmouth
the lead, 20-15.

Four plays later, Doug Fink
was dropped in his own end
zone for a safety, making the
score 2214. The final score of
the game came on a John
Schroeder run and a Motzer
FA]: The game ended with the
score, Monmouth 29, Grinnell
15.

(It is interesting to note that
while the officials are Very well
versed in the football rulebook,
it is obviously not this years
At least three times in the sec-
ond half, the coach of the Scots
could be seen on the playing
lield. This is a 15 yard penalty
and yet it was completely ig-
nored by the oificials. The
striped gods also chose to over
look the rule that only eligible
receivers an the offensive team
are permitted downlield before
a ball is punted. Had these in-
fractions been observed by the
otllmals and the proper penala
ties administered, there is no
doubt that it would have been
a different ball game.)

SHOEMAKERS' HOLIDAY REVIEW

By JOHN WILES

In the Prologue to Thomas
Dekker's comedy The Shoe-
makers’ Hollday, a spokesman
for the cast entreats the audi-
ence for “one gracious smile,‘
hoping to stave off the possible
“bitter storms of your dislike."
in response to the cast and
crew who recently staged The
Shoemakers’ Holiday for Grin-
nell Convocation audiences, one
must certainly “send . 4 _.
life," and not “sentence . . . to
death” this production or the
timeweathcred play.

The cast. and Director For-
ter Woods, seemed to have
taken as their orientation Dek—
ker's own preface, in which he
describes his work as “a merry-
conceited comedy,” for which
"nothing is purposed but
mirth." The play was indeed
performed very broadly, as a
production which finds its pri-
mary reinforcement in the
laughter of its audience.

Max Helfgott was amusing as
a harmlessly self- appreciative
shoemaker, although he seemed
less than accurate in portray-
ing Simon Eyre only as a fum-
bling antic. Heltgott convinc-
ingly played that part of Eyre
to which his own remark
“Prince am 1 none" applies,
but apparently chose to ignore
the latter half of Eyre's famous
assertion — ”yet am lprinccly
born" — as being the hint it is
to more dignified and com-
manding facets of simon Eyre's
character.

Libby Pannwitt, on the other
hand, pumped far too much
intelligence into a part which
calls more simply for a dense,
nagging, scattermraincd old
helpmate. Much of Dame Mar-
gery's colorful bluntness seem-
ed underdeveloped; shrew is
she none, yet could she more
shrewishly have been borne,

Ken Hicks made a line, dash-

Hicks seemed to abandon any
link between the two roles.
Without doubt, Hicks is capable
of superb comic antics, but it
must be remembered that
Lacy's motivation for disguise
is merely temporary conceal-
ment, not to try his hand at
playing the giddiest fool in Lon
don '

Dennis Wilson and Robert ing-
ham made an unbalanced team
as Eyre’s employees, Hodge and
Firk. Wilson was uneasy with
the Elizabethan language of his
part, and needed some invent-
iveness in order to have proj-
ected a stronger. more polished
performance.

lngharn, alas, was to be
found at the other extreme of
lively inventiveness. A polished,
superbly c o mic performance
was given, but much too much
liberty was taken with the role
of Kirk.

Firk is a character who is
funny primarily because he
himself does not realize that he
is; it is not a sophisticated, all-
knowing wit who addresses
Lacy as “corn-iorant” instead
of “colonel.” While lngham's
perfnmance was entertaining,
it was too nimble and self-com
scious to have been the char-
acter Dekket‘ created.

Fritz Schwaller, as Lincoln,
and Ned Benton, as Dtley, made
for a pair of amusing old fugies,
whose machinations to prevent
the marriage of Rose and Lacy
were funny and in no way really
Villalllous. Had both actors toned
down their stereotyped and ofa
ten strident characterizations,
no doubt they would have
easily stolen the entire show.

Art Knowles did well with the
part of l-lammon, playing him

or with an uncontrollable libido
than as a true menace who
might have seriously soured the
spirited lightness of his scenes
with Rose and Jane

Both Rose and Jane were quite
well played. Ricki Ravitts sup-
pressed an occasional temptation
to satirically overplay Rose's
sweetness, and kept her from,
becoming ludicrous as an over-
bearing saccarine stereotype.

Stephanie Lewis gave a fine
performance as Jane, especially
in her first scene as the whim-
pering, exceedingly weepy bride
whose husband is about to b!
drafted.

Bill Saylor was ill at ease
as Rafe, a role which offers
very little comic potential. and
which must be played as a sup
porting romantic hero. sayloi-

Debbie Abbott tackled the part
of Sybil, Rose‘s maid, with good '
bawdy sauciness, and despite a
lack of convincing earthiness,
was essentially capable in thin
supporting role.

Patty Loeb was delightful us
the near-omnipresent Boy, who
was smoothly almost non-played,

Murry Nelson was perhaps
the most lamentably poor in his
characterization of the King.
Nelson proved woefully weak
