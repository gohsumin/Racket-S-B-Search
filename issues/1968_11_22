Many halls decided upon
hours by floor or section, but
each hall in its entirety decid-

rules such as quiet hours, ev-

Faculty Approves

1 Course Evaluation

On Monday, Nov. 18, Theo-
dore Glick, ’71, appeared be-
fore a faculty meeting to
exp 'n, and ask for faculty co-
operation with a plan for stu-
dent evaluations oi courses. The
plan, which was heard by the
Executive Committee a week
earlier, involved a question<
naire to be sent to each stu-
dent, in it would be questions
relating to criticism of courses
and of professors instructional
methods.

The vote of the faculty ex-
pressed support for the idea of
course evaluation, but was not,
Mr. Leggett said, to be taken as
approval of the particular
group of questions proposed. in-
stead, a vote will be taken on
specifics of the questionnaire
at a later meeting.

The inclusion of students on
faculty committees (Library.
Public Events, e.g.) was also
discussed at the meeting,

Dean Stauss reread the reg-
ulations on absences before and
after holidays to the meeting
in order to remind the faculty
before Thanksgiving that the
rules still exist

 

The Monroe Hotel: The Later Years

(Continued from last week)

By MARK SABLEMAN And
PAUL ROTHMAN

The Monroe Hotel, after
ownerships and managements
by several different people, and
Grinnell College, in the 1930's
and 19405, came under the
wnership of Mr. George Hiser,

usband of Associate Professor
Mrs. Velma Hiser.

During Mr. l-liser’s manage-
ment and ownership, the ho-
tel's dlnlng room gained a na-
tional reputation Ior fine
toads, especially for its
steaks; during the 40's and
early 50's, people would come
from miles around to eat
there, Just after the end of
World War 1!, Mr. Riser redid
the floor at the hotel lobby,
and lmbedded u-lirty - two
oilver dollars in it. These sil-
ver dollars are now quite val-
«able and were removed by

the present management just
this fall.
Tunnels Under Hotel

Through the years, many
legends, some with elements
of truth, some completely
false, have grown up concern-
ing the Monroe l-lotei, Proba»
bly, the best known legendvis
that: there are tunnels under
the hotel, Mr. George Hiser,
manager of the hotel for
twenty - five years, contends
that there are no tunnels, but
others, including Police Chief
Bill Peters, say that they have
actually been in the tunnels.
As the best legend has it, the
tunnels originate in the north-
ern half of the hotel basement,
which would be under the old
site of J. B. Grinnell’s house,
and run as far as 435 East
Street, or, according to some,

New Grace Period
For Overdue Books

Burling Library has insti<
tuted an unoiiicial grace pe<
riod for overdue books. Stil-
dents will now be given 24
days to return a book with-
out being fined. After a no-
lice is sent, however, ﬁnes
must be paid.

Records will continue to
be fined beginning the day
they are due. This is because
“The demand is higher [or
records," said Mrs. Mary
Wyly, Reierence Librarian
in charge oi circulation.

Last year the library col-
lected $1,118.03 in fines for
overdue books and records.
The money pays ior the re-
pair and purchase of books.

 

Nichols, Jackson
Speak on Negro
In Literature

As part of the series on Afro-
American culture being pre-
sented, two visiting specialists
spoke Tuesday night on Afro-
American literature and Cul-
ture, Drs, Charles H. Nichols
and Blyden Jackson addressed
students in Roberts Theatre on
”How does Blackness affect the
works of the Negro American
writer?”

Dr. Jackson entitled his lec<
ture “A Bit of Comedy, Amer-
ican Style," and discussed the
changes in the American Negro
family.

He feels that over the years,
the Negro family has become a
source of strength and “a biolo‘
gical success," for they hava
iound ways and means to use
their money, and they are send<
ing more and more children to
college, and they are being fed
better.

In discussing the probable ei-
fecis of color on Negro fiction,
Jackson cited several observa-
tions. He noted that there is a
very small world for the Negro
movement and this world is
monolithic.

“The Runaway Slave and the
Golden Bough," Dr. Nichols'
lecture, placed its emphasis on
the deeply entangled problems
or the Negro who tries to redis-

cover the image at his own cul-
furor

Becomes Effective When Affairs

Committee Ok’s Hall Proposals

Yesterday President Glenn Leggett presented
the Student Affairs Committee with a proposal
which would allow each residence hall a maximum
of 84 hours for coeducational visitation. The Presi-

Grinnell to Host
African Dancers

Les Danseurs Africains, the
national ensemble of Mali, will
give 7 p.m. and 10 pm. per-
formances at Grinnell College's
Roberts Theatre tomorrow.

The Company or dancers, at:-
mbats, singers, and musicians,
which has been acclaimed as
Africa's greatest, is making its
first tour of North America and
will perform in Chicago's Audi»
torium Theatre a week after its
Grinnell appearance.

Composed of members of
more than a dozen tribes that
form the major segment of
Mali's population, the group
performs religious, sacrificial,
witchcraft, and funeral rites
that until recent years were
closed to all except a highly re-
stricted group of adult males
in each tribe.

Block Spokesman
To Visit College

Ernest Chambers, a leader of
Omaha's Black community who
has gained national recognition
as a spokesman ior young
Blacks, will spend Friday and
Saturday at Grinnell college,

Chambers will keynote a Sat-
urday alternootl conference with
representatives of Black stu-
dents' organizations in laws and
from the Associated Colleges of
the Midwest.

While on campus, he will give
a lecture; be inteerewed at a
student press conference; and
meet informally with students
and faculty members at a series
of classroom sessions, “experi-
mental classes," meals, and
coffee breaks,

dent also agreed to the San-
ate's proposal for 24-hour open
lounges which had been ap<
proved by the Student Affairs
Committee.

Leggett indicated that visita-
tinns would not be permitted
between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.
on Sunday through Thursday
and between 2 a.m. and B a.m.

The text of Mr, Leggztt’s

letter begins on page 2.

on Friday and Saturday. “The
opening of the commonause
lounges weakens any argument
for the need to have coeduca<
tional visiting in individual
rooms during the normal hours
for sleeping," said Leggett.

The proposal will go into ef-
fect in each dormitory when
that hall has submitted a state.
ntent of ball policy to the sui-
dent Affairs Committee, and
that policy has been approved.

President Leggett said there
was a need to insure all stu-
dents comfort and privacy in
the dormitories and dining
rooms, a need for expansion of
the off-campus housing option,
and a procedure for eviction
from the residence halls for
students who misbehave.

The recommendations of the
president are to cover what he
called the “interim period,”
when a deﬁnite policy can ho
worked out by the Student Af-
fairs Committee and approved
by the college's administration.

The college‘s rule has been
that the dormitories were open
to members of the opposite sex
on Sundays from 2 pm. to 5
p.m. and on one or two eve.
nings per semester, during
hours decided in conjunction
with the deans.

The President said that the
college, can no longer support
the old notion “that Residence
hail management ought chieﬂy
to reflect a kind of remedial
parenthood (in low purentls) ens
vironment.”

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee on October 15 approved the
students’ petition which would
give each hall authority on
whether or not to open up the
lounges for 24—hour coeducnn
tional use.

Transcript of President Leggeii's Letter

1 wish in this letter to take
up three matters of concern to
students, Iaculty, and the Col-
lege Administration: (1) a re-
sponse to the proposal or your
committee for coeducational
use of common-use lounges;
:(2) a statement or matters I
consider essential to a long-rim
workable solution of our resi-
dance hall "problem”; and (3)
a discussion of the “reieren-
dtlm-proposal” oi the Student
Government Assocration of 11
November lor the management
of residence halls between now
and the time (a period that
has come to be known as the
“interim”) when a definite
policy can be worked out by
your committee, then approved
by the College Administration
and then implemented. Items
2 and 3 are dililcult to keep
leparable and discrete and
lhould perhaps be taken as n
oingle statement.

1

Proposal for the
co—educational use of
common-use lounges

On 22 October your commlt~
'th referred to me the lollowing
recommendations for the co-
educational use of commoneuse
lounges:

l — All halls, each fall, shall
set their own hours {or the coed
use of their commoneuse lounge.

2 — voting on the setting or
hours tor Coed use shall be by
Iecret ballot. A simple major-
Ity oi hall members shall be re-
quired to set hours between
I:Ol] 3.111. and midnight. A 2/3
majority of hall members shall
be required to set hours of use
It other times,

3 — Upon a regular motion
In hall meetings or upon peti-
Iion of 30% of the hall, the
question of lounge use may be
reopened for possible modifi-
cation. Voting procedure lor
revision shall be the same as
outlined under No. 1

4 — After locking hours, only
those men accompanied by
women students shall be per-
mitted in women’s residence
halls.
in point 4 or the recommenda-
tion I prefer that the statement

read as follow: Alter locking
hours, only those men accom-
panied by women students shall
be permitted in the common-
use lounges oi the women’s
residence halls. The bold
phrase is the addition and is
necessary lor clarity,

With the change just indi~
cated, the recommendations
have my approval and may be
implemented as soon as you
[ind it feasible [0 (lo 504

Essentials for a
workable solution of the
resident hall “problem.”

You may recall that in my
letter to faculty and students
at 30 October regarding the de-
ciSlon about Mr. Schneirov I
included the lollowing para-
graph:

As I see It, we need in the
residence halls

i — a mode of living and
regulation consistent won the
mental and physical health of
students, one which will serve
the best interests of the aca-
demic program or the College
and so permit students to work
eﬂectively as students (that is
to say, with sufficient rest,
quiet, emotional security, and
privacy to enable them to do
their best academic work);

2 — a set of standards for
behavior, and enforcement of
such standards, that assure
the trustees, the Iaculty, the
students, and me that neither
tyranny nor anarchy can oper-
ate in the residence halls:

3 — enough variety oi living
options designed by the College
community so that n divergen-
cy in temperament and person»
:11 style can obtain in both pres-
ent and prospective students;
and

4 — a means for the Judicial
Council and, where necessary,
the deans, to deal quickly
(either by removal from the
residence halls or from the col-
lege) with a student or group
of students whn Can not abide
by any regulation, either those
oi their peers or those at the
College.

items 1 and 2 are chiefly dif-
ferent ways of saying Ihe same

thing, ior each refers to the
need to have a style or hie in
the residence halls Ihat at the
very minimum does not inter-
{are with the ability oi Students
to get their academic work
done. item Ii rclers to the need
to create and maintain enough
diilerences in the regulations
of individual halls so that both
present and prospective stu<
dents oi ditterent expectations
and sophisticanons can be ac-
commodated. Item 4 reiers to
the need tor disciplinary and
enforcement procedures which
can operate both iairly and
quickly, Though none oi the
items gets to the crucial ques-
rions or how and when, they do
add up to a statement of broad
policy which the trustees at
their meeting of Z and 3 No-
vember subscribed to as a
Board, as did the Executive
Council oi the Faculty at its 13
November meeting.

A variety of points or view
exists among students and lac-
ulty and the College Adminis-
tration about specific defini-
tions of the terms in the (our
items, as well as about what
ways oi implementing the gen~
eral policy. And this statement
leads to another: that there are
differences in concerns about
the residence halls that have
to be recognized and then taken
into account by three groups or
people — students, laculty, and
the C o l l e g e administration
(which may be said In repre-
sent not only the trustees and
the president but through them,
though imperlectly, alumul,
parents, and prospective stu-
dents).

Discussion of this three-way
net of Concerns begins with the
recognition that this College,
like almost any other or its
kind, has found It very diffi-
cult in the last decade to sup-
port the notion, which once was
a matter of lailh, that residence
hall management ought chiefly
to reﬂect Ii kind at remedial-

parenthood (in loco parentls)
environment: in other words,
that the residence halls are a
central part or a character-to
mation or finishing-school m
sion (or the institution. But this
admisston oi change is a state-
ment quite dependent on the
next one, which is that the Col-
lege cannot endorse an anarchic
system which will inevitably
result in “every man lor him-
self.” Roughly speaking, the
pattern oi residence hall regu-
lations exists lot reasons not
exclusively in [he Interests at
students or their leelings about
sell-education; there are other
reasons, the sources of which
lie in history. economics, archi-
tectural limitations, and society
tit-larger Nu matter what
changes in speciiic regulations
may become appropriate, the
College must always house the
majority of its students in a rash-
ion that attends to their mental
and physical health In such a
way that the life in the halls at
its best contributes to campus
llie and at its worst does not de-
tract from it. When it dna
work, a residence hall system
lucceeds in uniting with a de-
gree of practical reasonable
ness the essential concerns of
the faculty, the wishes of stu-
dents, and what can be Called
the “accountability of the Col-
lege administration"

Faculty concerns range from
n disinterest in the residence
halls to a concern that laculty
members themselves do all
they can individually and col-
lectively to help students and
deans bring a positive and per-
vasive “inlellectualism” into
the halls. Between the two ch
tremes are a variety ol‘ indi-
vidual faculty attitudes, all of
which are natural reﬂections of
the fact that the Grinnell lac-
ulty consists of persons of dif-
Ierent temperaments who can
be said to have varying styles
of talking with students. But it
is safe to say that whatever their

resented in the Griilnell student
body doubtless has much to do
with the problems in our pres-
ent situation. Student govern
ment tor the past several
years, tor instance, even with
good intentions, has not been
able to deal with the necessity
oi enforcing rules on a dissent~
iug minority, perhaps for the
understandable reason that
maximum exposure is now pro-
vided in the halls for particu-
larly strong personalities to ex-
ercise an exhibitionism and ag-
gi-ession.

So far as the College admin-
Islratiun is concerned, it has
suiiered from charges or stu-
dents that it cares more about
“public appearance‘Vthan about
students' emotional needs and
thus has not really made its
claim clear for the necessity of
its concerns, which include the
need for emotional and mate
rial support from alumni and
donors, the encouragement of
prospective students and their
parents, the respect and well-
wishes of current parents. and
the good-will oi the immediate

uion of interests among itself.

body. It has perhaps not talked
enough about the distribution oi
rights and obligations among
the parts oi its “community at
scholars“ but instead ["15 em-
phasized its hopes lor totality
and im- wholeness, probably
because talk about separation
oi powers and “ultimate author
ity" is not comiortable rhet-
one to deans and presidents

But it is necessary now to
admit we need to achieve a
better balance than we have
among the sometimes compet-
ing interests oi students, inc-
ulty, and College administra-
tion. We need to continue to
deiine what we expect oi one
another so that the atmos-
phere oi intellectual and emo—
tional growth that is so stead-
ily being improved at Grinnell
can be maintained, principally
by retaining the remarkably
talented and committed people
who have chosen to gather in
the College,

There are certain conditions
i regard as necessary to such
a balance. They are so pio-
ioundly and permanently inilu-
ential that they have to be
talked out simultaneously With
the formulation of the “inter-
im” period.

Management of the

residence halls during

the “interim” period.

i shall not speak at length
about the student “reieren.
dum” oi ll November. There
have been questions about its
technical validity, its timing.
and the impression it gave.

perhaps inadvertently, that stu-
dents wcre going to decnie the
“interim” arrangement With-
out any reference to the con-
cerns oi iaculty and the Col-
lege administration Bul l was
favorably impressed with the
insistence of the Student Gov-
ernment Association that
among the procedures neces-
sary to implement the rcier-
endum were (I) the need to
determine procedures ior se-
lecting house iudicial councils,
(2) the need to determine en-
iorcement procedures, and (3)
the need to formulate a “bill
at rights and obligations" CDli<
cerning individual behavior in
a dormitory situation. Tiiese all
seem to me to be constructive
and necessary iii-st steps. i
understand they are now under-
way. Many oi these steps,
when reﬁned and discussed in
your committee, will go iar
toward meeting the conditions
or balancing the concerns oi
students, iacuity, and College
administration which I dis-
cussed in general terms above
and now list here as specific
recommendations ior your con-
sidel'atinn:

l 7 The need for a minimal,
workable non-interference in
otllers‘ comiort and privacy
within the dormitories, begin-
ning with students’ lirm pledges
to one another to maintain
“quiet hours" as promised in
the student handbook (even, as
I understand it, to the level of
music. talk, slamming or doors,
and the like): in speaking about
dormitories I include the din-
ing halls, where respect for
the rights oi others is essen-
tial, particularly those rights

or being free from the intimb
dating aspects oi boisterous
behavior, pushing ahead in line'
and acting or urging others to
act in ways unbecoming to the
appetites and digestions of the
great majority oi students.

2 — The need ior expansion
as soon as possible oi the option
oi voluntary departure irom the
residence halls, now repre-
sentcd by the “offscampils”
process which this year placed
nearly a hundred students
(probably the current limit oi
available rental housing) in the
town of Grinnell, ’

:i —— The need tor a general
recognition at the process of
eviction (rain the residence
halls as an oilicial response to
behavior problems as they are
identiﬁed by student govern-
ment or resident advisers or
deans.

4 — The need tor a system
in which elected house presi-
dents provide a rule pattern
for student behavior and a
process of entorcement within
the hall that makes possible
some choice or option for stu»
dents as they are in the process
oi selecting a particular resi-
dence hall. Not all aspects
of residence hall lile can be
settled in this manner, but it
is a device necessary to meet
the needs or that minority
which now must leave the col-
lege or choose not to come to
it initially, As I said previous-
ly, it is my understanding that
SGA ofﬁcers, in consultation
with resident advisors, deans,
and iaculty members, are al-
ready attempting to formulate
such descriptions. to experi<
ment with new devices such as
judicial committees within each
hall, and to renew a commit
ment to good dormitory liie on
a new, more sell-determining
basis.

5 a The need to expand op
portunities, for coeducational
visitation in student rooms to
a maximum of 84 hours per
week provided conditions such
as the above are met and pro-
vided certain administrative
details, such as strict adher—
ence to the stated times as de-
termined by the hall's govern—
ment are attended to, and pro-
Vided that coeducational visV
iting hours will not take place
between 12 midnight and 8 a.m.
on Sunday through Thursday
and between 2 a.m. and 8 a m.
on Friday and Saturday. This
latter point is sellcxplauaiory
to parents, alumni, iacnlty,
and I suspect most students. i
believe. too, that the opening
oi the common-use lounges

weakens any argument tor the.

eta-educational

need to have

v ting in individual room:
during the normal hours ior
sleeping,

This last item, the state-
ment on “open dorms," will no
doubt he a perpetual topic on
this campus, ii ior no other
reason than that it has by now
become highly symbolic and
thus surrounded by tradition.
But i believe that the leelings
or our own student body, a
large segment of which wants
something less than “unlimited
open rooms" would argue ior
some limitation, and 84 hours
per week seems to meet reasona
ably well the iaculty require-
ment that management of the
residence halls pay a regard
to privacy and quiet; it also
serves to satisiy the “account-
ability" oi the College adminis-
tration as it explains our resi-
dence hall program to parents,
alumni, and prospective stu-
dents.

I am aware that I have
given your committee a great
deal to do, and a short time
to do it in ~ that is, Consider
ations involving workable ere
plications or my recommenda<
tions as well as implementa-
tion of judicial and enforce-
ment proceedings; discussions
oi proposals irom individual
residence halls and the relating
of them to one another: all
in all, a continuing review oi
what seems to be working and
what isn't as you attempt to
construct a realistic and Work-
anle “interim" system that
points toward a permanent
system and at the same time
meets the general require-
ments I outlined at the start
of Section II and the specific
recommendations or Conditions
I gave in Section III. But I am
also aware that much construe-
tive work is already underway.
For instance, my understand-
ing is that individual halls, to
a varying degree, have already
prepared statements for the
consideration or your commit-
tee. It remains for each one now
to begin preparing revised pro<
posals within the prescribed
limits oi 34 hours per week or
less. As soon as your commit-
tee is satisfied that an individ-
ual residence hall has its house
in order, it can be told to pro.
cecal Hopeluiiy, when all resi-
deuce halls have reported In,
enough variety in regulatioiu
will have exhibited themselves
to assure the College that we
can continue to appeal to dif-
ferent kinds of Students. Hope<
iully too, within a short time
the house councils and judicial
Councils will have demonstrated
their ability to manage matters
so that the concerns of all of
us # students, faculty, and
College administration _ are
in that reasonable balance that
will let all oi us enjoy the many
good things that make this
College so attractive.

The President’s Proposal

President Leggett has recom—
mended to the Student Affairs Com—
mittee an increase to 84 hours per
week in hours for coeducational visi-
tations in the residence halls. This is
considerably less than the 24 hours a
day the student government demand-
ed. Nevertheless, Leggett’s proposal
represents a victory for students, for
several months ago it seemed almost
inconceivable that the college would
budge on this issue.

There may be merit in the argu-
ment that to have a policy in which
there are some visiting hours is hypo-
critical; that is, only a policy of no
legal coeducational visitations or a
policy of 24 hour visitations is com-
pletely consistent and honest. Neither
“honest" policy, however, would be
workable at Grinnell College, and Mr.
Leggett has wisely chosen the expedi-
ent path. A college cannot run when a
majority of its students is so dissatis-
fied with a rule that it concerns itself
more with discussions on the rule
than with academic matters. A col-
lege administration cannot govern
when it does not have the support of
the students. Nor can a college which
has 24 hour opens survive financially
in a world which frowns upon such
use of rooms.

Mr. Leggett has tried to lead the
campus out of the confusion in which
it finds itself. He has tried to win the
support of the students, but he has al-
so tried to put together a proposal
which will be acceptable to parents
and faculty. He probably has succeed‘
ed in achieving these aims, and the
college will be the better for it.

The letter of the President is, des-
pite its virtues, somewhat deficient.
The only question on which Mr. Leg-
gett is really specific is the number of
hours to be allowed for open dorms.
On the accompanying problem of en-
forcement he offers no suggestions.
Enforcement of rules is a touchy ques-
tion, for students are not receptive
to the idea of having to enforce a rule
on their neighbors. Students general-
ly feel that what one does, if he does
not disturb another, is his own busi-
ness, and the prevalence of this feel-
ing will inhibit any enforcement of
college rules in the dormitories. It
may be that there is no way to enforce
rules outside of paid proctors, a meth-
od of dubious effectiveness.

For the past few weeks many
dormitories have been declaring

“home rule," and many dorms and
floors have adopted 24 hour opens for
themselves in the light of Mr. Leg-
gett’s proposal it would be better for
the college, and better for the resi-
dence halls if they were to undo these
do facto assertions of authority and to
accept the President’s suggestions. To
insist upon 24 hour opens when it ig~
nores the best interest of the whole
community, would be simply an ex-
pression of insolence.

It is our opinion that Mr. Leggett
has acted in the long—term interests of
the college. He has updated our resi-
dence rules so that they are similar to
those of other colleges in our category.
He has made a fair proposal and one
that ought, on account of its liberali-
ty, appeal to most students.

Yale Goes Coed

According to last Friday's New
York Times, Yale University will ad-
mit undergraduate women for the first
time next September. This action of
Yale’s may well be the beginning of
that great university’s demise. Death
is the natural lot of man, and of all
human things, but Yale seems actual—
ly to be courting death.

Never before on the grand scale
which impends has Yale had to en-
gage itself with that serpent riddle,
that fustian fuss, that immortal enig-
ma known as the visitation problem.
It is true that there are women in New
Haven, but never has woman been in
the classroom, where minds are liable,
upon occasion, to be turned, and
hearts won and lost. As romances de-
velop as male and female students
whisper to one another during lec-
tures, and as boys carry their girls'
books, and as girls become the fourths
in bridge games, Yale will be nagged
and nettled with demands for greater
student freedoms.

According to the Times, Kingman
Brewster, President of Yale, said his
decision to ieminate Yale had been
”somewhat precipitate.” if only
Brewster had read The Scarlet and
Black. He might then have waited,
and time might have killed his baleful
plan. A look at the S&B, if it did not
weary his eyes, might have created in
him second thoughts, and as he saw
this great college, oldest by far west
of the Mississippi, and long a coed
institution, continue to grapple with
the problems caused by the presence
of the gentler sex, he might have seen
the advantages in being “for men
only."

Schneirov Protests
5&8 ‘Disiorﬁon'

To the Editor:

I write this in reply to an
article that appeared last week
in the 5&3. The article was a
deliberate distortion of my
views and moreover was ob-
tained under false pretenses.
The article includes extensive
misquoting and many outright
lies.

Early last week, freshman
Paul Rolliman Called and asked
to talk (0 me about the draft
and SDS. At no time did he
say he was reporting for the
5&3. He proceeded to ask me
a lot of personal questions,
most of which I tried to answer
n-uthiully. The article in the
5&8 is similar in subject mat-
[91' though not in content to the
conversation i had with him.

First of all, the article trav-
esiies my views by taking
statements Completely out of
context, I never said that “as
a humanitarian" i would give
my life to “the cause — ‘the
great revolution.” 1 said that
1 would fight in a revolution
and ii necessary risk death,
The article makes me seem as
though I am some Sort of vis<
ioiiaiy s e e kin g martyrdom.
Nothing could be farther from
the truth.

Second, 1 never said that I
had accomplished the work of
gaining selirdetermination. This
statement in the article is Whol-
ly false. The work on hall self-
deiermination was a collective
effort on the part of a great
many students. I think that it
would be fair to say that my
case sparked the current con<
cern over self-determination.
The reason why l elected to
take the case before the Judi-
clal Council was to spark such
a concern. But this is a matter
of public knowledge known to
all who attended the open hear-
ing; it is nothing new. The ar<
ticle further states that I said
I started all the excitement
over opens. 1 never said this
because it is not true. The
opens issue is one with a long
history dating back long be-
fore I came to Gl‘inllell. Most
students don‘t need me or any-
body else to tell them how to
feel about coeducational roam
Visitation,

Third, concerning Lee Mar-
il, 1 never said that I had to
“Convince” him about opens.
Lee Mal‘il and I have differ-
ences on certain matters and
have had a few short discus<
sions on opens and related sub-
jects, but I do not claim to have
convinced him about opens or
any other matter. In fact, as
far as I know, Lea Maril has
always been for opens.

Fourth, about leaving my
room, 1 never said “I really
like people and I like to be
around people” even though
there is a large element of
truth in that statement. I
didn’t accept Leggeit’s punish-
ment about living on campus
willingly because i ielt that it
was mainly a political punish~
ment, The dual purpose oi the
punishment was to paclly con-
cerned alumni, trustees, and
donors, and to set an example
in the student body that no

one can stand up openly to tho
administration and get awa,
with it. A political move such
as this must be responded to
politically, and the decision to
move out of my dorm room
was not mine alone, but a gen.
eral one made by SDS.

The fact that the SM! anlclo
is literally a pack of lies is
not isolated from larger issues.
it is part or the sol; policy
against student selideterminao
tion and against myself. The
effect of the article is to slan-
der the serious political discus.
sion which people within SDS
including myself are trying to
engage other students in.

Schneirov Compliance
Diuppoinis 52559

To the Editor:

It appears that Richard
Schneirov has let the student
body down by compromising his
principles. In the October 4,
1968 issue of the 58:3, he was
quoted as saying “Anything less
than ‘not guilty’ Will be unac-
oeplable," Today i read in the
Des MDilles Register, and had
conﬁrmed by Grant Crandall,
that he is now living off-campus
His compliance with the will u
the administration contradicts
that which he lead the Studenl
body to believe he stood for,
Are We to assume that he has
reevaluated his position and now
feels his visitation warranted
the "sentence” that President
Leggett handed down on October
30? We, who did not completely
share his views, still greatly re-
spected him for standing up [or
something he sincerely believed
in. His actions within the week'
have possibly killed his move-
ment. because they have said to
the student body—accept con.
duct pi’obations; accept evict
tions from the residence halls;
accept the decisions of the ad-
ministration.

Critic Called Naive

tors needed to make a point
about life. To do so would take
several years, if Lhey were to
proceed at life's normal pace.
But they chose to make their
point in two hours at an exag<
gerated pace.

The critic says that those in
the audience who were offend~
ed, revolted, and shocked by
the play, should have been
warned beforehand so that

Fuson ‘5leep—in’ Role

To the Editor:

Mrs Crosscit made a serious
error in his letter which ap-
peared in the 5&1! last week
when he said: “, l .the article
was written by Harold Fuson,
the editor and one at the plan-
ners of the ‘sleep-in’. . ."

Harold Fuson did in fact at-
tend the planning meeting, but
only in the capacity as a re
porter for the 5&3. Mr. Fuson
was in tact against the sleeprin
which he thought was too ser-
ions an affront to the adminis-
tration and ‘taculty. He did not
think the sleep-in would be com
ducive to meaningful change.

Schisgct] Mini—worlds Amuse Critic

By JOHN GARDNER

Murray Schisgal’s plays, The
Typists and The Tiger, per-
iormcd on Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday of last week un-
der the direction oi guest direc<
tor John Ulmer, succeeded nice-
ly Within the limitations that
Schisgal set. They did not de~
part irotn these limitations, and,
since much of
Schisgai material
is brilliantly iunny,
his telescoped oi-
tice setting and rapist’s “pad"
became surprisingly, and per-
haps alarmingly, visible as
mini-worlds.

N0 Schisgal character, in
these two plays, or in Luv, tor
that matter, is ever out or con~
tact with the mini-world in the
play. On the contrary, great
eiiort is expended by the char-
acter into fitting into this uni-
verse more closely. The typists'
eagerness and immediacy in
plunging into their orten absurd
situations, and their competition
in this respect indicate their
essential and uncomprehending
confusion.

In The Typists, the tirst im-
pression Mrs Kimbrough gives
in the character at Gloria, is
one 0[ bitchy and mincing sure-
ness. it is a sureness that is
quite conscious, The iirst hint
or a theme that Schisgal devel»
ops in both plays comes in her
sell-characterization as an eiii<
cient worker to Bell (Charles
Kimbrough). Why stress this
seemingly tangential part oi
her personality? Because Bell
has, as yet, no claim to reality
as an oiiice Worker. This is an
advantage to Gloria. It follows
that everything that Gloria real-
izes about herseli implies some
positive or negative advantage
with respect to Ben.

The Typists‘ success depends
partly on Schisgal’s ability to
include a great number oi sit-
uations, some oi which depend
on life outside the office, in a
kind of continuum of rash wor-
Ty and false conlidence that de-
termines the minirworld of his
oitice, There is, thus, no special
decision that Schisgal creates
tor his characters which they
should include in this kind of
dialogue; this is outside the limi-
tations of his comedy. The two
typists are called on to succced
as vehicles for Schisgal‘o char-

actci'istlc themes or anxiety and
confusion and as people who
have the possibility oi talking
things out. Mary Jane and
Charles Kitnbrough succeeded in
presenting both the brisk, anx-
ioils ciphers and the periodically
wistiul people in The Typislss
They suggested an underlying
suspicion in the characters,
that one or the other, or both,
is missing something, grounded
in the tear that a great deal has
been missed already.

The Tiger, like The Typists,
does not attempt a large-scale
picture, but, unlike the first
play, depends tor its humor
more on a situation than on a
series oi imaginatively gener—
ated possibilities that are sus<
tamed by coniused characters.

Paul (Charles Kimbrough) is
the tiger, a 5Zryear-old man in
yellow pants with a peace sym-
bol, who carries Sylvia (Mary
Jane Kimbrough), a society wo-
man, to his “pad” to rape her,
The battle of gestures between
the two is more speciﬁc, more
decisive and tunnier than that
of the earlier play. No confu—
sion seems to exist for the tiger
in the beginning oi the play, as
lte carries his kicking victim to
center stage. This is, however,
the extent to which any action
not related to “communication"
oi one kiitd or another goes.

With the beginning Ol his in-
tellectual rape of Sylvia, with
which, it is obvious, he is more
preoccupied with than a sexual
one, Paul turns out—no surprise
—to be both ambivalent and de-
pressive. The nearly cathartic
urge oi Schisgal's characters to
talk about an always unbearable
past takes hold oi him. This urge
is similarly irresistible to char-
acters in Luv and The Typistss

The tiger's gestures, the Vl0<
lent command to the woman to
not talk, are diminished not by
the woman's gestures, but by his
own need to talk. In a way, the
woman, by placing, or at least
helping him into a situation of
depending on her absolute sym-
pathy, is allowing his confusion
to reduce him. Mr. Kimbrough
seemed to be particularly bril-
liant in the portrayal of Paul’s
being gradually changed into
something far less than a tiger.
Sylvia’s increasingly poweriui
aggressions, often identical to
the tiger’s were probably the
best received of her sequences.

Several years ago I took a friend to see his first Marx Eros.
picture. he was simultaneously outraged and delighted, and when
the movie was over his initial comment was, “The audacity, the
sheer audacity!" I did not understand what he meant at first, for
i had grown up with the Marx Bros. movies and their world always
seemed to me perfectly natural. I’ve since come to understand
What my friend meant «e that the Max Bros. violate our sense of
decorum by a simple and switt application oi the logical techniques
reductio ad absurdum, and its corollary expansio ad absurdum.
But I have not yet surrendered my childlike notion that the world
itseii resembles their picture of it. Events this past weekend sup
port my childhood faith.

Nature, Oscar Wilde observes, is always imitating art. Now
to many who saw the recent campus shouting oi Horseteaihers, the
situation may have seemed outmoded 0r dated: collegiate life as
presented in the movie is that of the late Twenties and early Thir-
itesithe playboy atmosphere, the emphaSls on bigtime iootbaii. the
exploitation oi both by gangsters; the problems of Prohibition. Yet
it one read the newspapers this past week, one could see nearly all
of these still at work in our society. The comic culmination came
when the New York Jets' l‘mtbﬂll game Was cut oii in the last
two minutes oi play in order to present a TV version oi Heidi. Dee
spite oiir claims to being a child-centered society, the adults at
the nation — the male adults — rose up in righteous wrath when
their ruling passion was threatened The most elaborate system
of emergency telephones in the nation, that oi New York City, was
so overloaded that iuses blew along with tempers. Old Groucho
biliis may remember a line from another of his movies: “Steps
will be taken, Wires will be pulled. Heads will fall." I saw in
Tuesday’s paper an apology from TV executives, together Willi a
promise that bigtime football will never again take second place
I assume that promise includes the outbreak of WW HI.

Just imagine What the Marx Bros. would have done with that
whole story, which would have proVided them with glorious
chances for the kind of abrupt transmons on which so much or
their comedy depends. Scenes could have shifted with the incon-
gruous rapidity oi the backdrops in A Night at the Opera. Groucllo,
as a TV executive, could have snarled his way to the absurd heart
of the situation. Chico could have been called on, together with
Harpo to soothe the injured and helpless children of the world by
means of their poignantly comic music, And Zeppo could have
played Joe Namath. Since pro football has replaced college toot-
bali as the bigtime gamblers’ chiei business, appropriate inter.
stitial scenes Could have been interwoven in all their natural im-
propriety. True, Prohibition is no longer with us; but the sharp
shrewd eyes or the Marx Bros. could have iound equivalents in the
WCTU morality of the new left.

It is the late of satire to become dated. And yet, if the par-
ticulars of time and history which the Satirist selects are universal
in kind, we can continue to enjoy the satire, as we do with Aristo-
phanes and Swiit, Tor we get a kind or double joy: we can recreate
an awareness or the historical particulars and enjoy the satire as
it was originally intended, and we can iind contemporary equiva-
lents and thus discover that our World is no less full of folly than
was theirs. The continued popularity oi the Marx Bros. indicates
that they, too, have achieved a satiric greatness.

The takeout double is used
over an opponent's bid to iind a
fit in one of the remaining suits.
Several requirements must be
met, however, in order to rub
terminate the bid from a penal-
ty double: partner must have
passed il he has had a Chalice
to enter the auction; the con-
tract being doublcd must be
fairly low; and the double of a
particular suit must be made at
the ﬁrst opportunity. In addi<
tion, there are distributional
and point count requirements
for a takeout double. The
doubler must have at least three
cards in each unbid suit, and
preieiably tour in one unbiii ma-
jor. In counting points, short-
ness in the opponent’s suit
should receive additional impor<
tance (5 points for a void, 3 for
a singleton) while low honors in
the opponent’s suit should not be
added in. Generally, it requires
11 points to double a bid of one
heart or less, thus giving part-
ner a chance to respond at the
one level. [is the level at which
partner must respond rises, the

number of points required to
double also increases. For ex-
ample, it would require 15 points
to double a bid of 2 spades.
The takeout double, however,
should not be used with opening
count and a good suit, In which
case an overcall should be
made.

Student Government Speaks

By TED CLICK
(tor TOM moms, HEATHER
FODTE, LEE MARIL)

For the past few weeks the
Student Course Evaluation Com~

inittee has been working long
and hard to develop a question-
naire which would cover the
areas of importance [or evalu-
ation and obtain the support
necessary lrom both faculty and
students. Monday night the fa-
culty voted as a unit to support
the idea of a student course
evaluation and urged all iaculty
members to Cit-operate in dis-
tribution of the questionnaire in
class. A week before, the
Student Senate had also voted
(0 support the idea of a student
course evaluation. Thus the way
has been cleared tor the ques-
tionnaire, almost in final form,
to be handed out to the protes-
Sors.

This questionnaire will be di-
vided into three parts. One part
will ask questions such as “Was
the class lecture, discussion, or
a mixture)". This section will
provide more information for a
student deciding on which
courses he might take the next
semester. This \vill be printed
for distribution to the student
body.

A second part will be con-
cerned with curricular infor-
mation about a course. Two
sample questions are; “From
the instructor's point at view
what are the objectives or the
course?". and “How successful-
ly was each or these objectives
attained?". This inlormatton
will go to those who decide on
the curriculum: the student
Curriculum committee. the de-
partment heads. and/or the edu-
cational policy committee The
information will also go to the
individual instructor.

The third part will be Ci‘iti~
clsms oi the instructor's meth-
ods of teaching, A question such
as “How open-minded was the
instructor in discussion?” is
typical of what the committee
has in mind. This section will
go only to the instructor, not to
Students,

The procedure tor all of this
will be as follows:

Firstly, the Committee, with
the help of other students and
professors experienced in the
use of questionnaires, will make
up the iinal questionnaire. Sec-
ondly, the questionnaires wdi
be distributed to the protes-
sors. Thirdly, the proiessors will
hand them out at their conven-
ience at the end of this semes-
ter- at least it is hoped that all

quired of them.

Fourthly, after the question-
naires have been filled out IN
CLASS the prot will immediately
put them into an envelope and
send them to the post. oirice, to
be stored until after grades have
been handed out. Then. next
semester, the profs will receive
the third section of the question-
naire from the student com<
mittee, which will not look at
that section. Next the stu<
dent committee AND ALL STU-
DENTS WHO WILL BE WIL-
LING TO HELP will compile the
information section and the
section for each individual
class. Lastly. these compilations
Will be distributed to the student
body in the case of the ﬁrst
section, and to the appropriate
CurrIculumrlnvestigating bodies
and the individual instructor in
the case of the second section

plaining all the intricacies of the
committee's work appropriate

or wait for the questionrand-

held soon. It will be publicized,
but watch for it.

This evaluation is for you, the
student. It should not be a cov-
ert attempt to “get" a teacher,
The purpose is to get the stu-
dent to think crttically about
his courses and thus, hopefully,
improvement of the course:
would result. The committee
hopes that this questionnaire
will not be your iirsi and last
attempt to evaluate courses;
they hope, instead. that it leads
the student to attempt to investi-
gate and be concerned with h'
courses more, through more in<
dividual contact with the pm-
fessors.

as a hotel, because it did not

operated mainly as a rooming
house, and rooms are rented
only by the month.

In the past nine years, there
have been many rumors. most
or them unsubstantiated, say-
ing that the hotel was being
used as a brothel. Talks with
the police and townpeople
seem to point out that some

‘AN OPEN LETTER TO
THE COOKS IN COWLES
KITCHEN:

SUBJECT: Your latest cull-
nary abortion.

GENTLEMEN: Although I
have eaten your cooking for
three years, I was astounded
by the poor quality or the
spaghetti-and-cheese concoction
served to the male student
body last Wednesday noon.
.You are to be congratulated on
your clever use or grease.

Also, since my spoontul of
spaghetti (about ﬁve inches
wide) was burned on one side
and tuicooked on the other, I
am convinced that you have
accomplished a rare teat in the
practice of thermodynamics.

I know most of you by your
ﬁrst names, but it is possible
that there is a leprechaun in
your kitchen. Please look into
this at your earliest opportunity.

Non-Machiavellian
“Prince" In Arena

A workshop production of An-
mine de Saint Exupery’s “The
Little Prince" will be presented
in Arena Theatre Sunday
through Wednesday.

Elizabeth Panwitt, ‘69, is di.
recting the play from her own
original script. Original music
lor the play has been composed
by Frederick s. Kuethe, ’69, ii
music major.

No advance tickets are neces-
sary for seating.

A iacet oi the Theatre De-
partment that rarely gets a

measure of its deserved alien-
tion is the modern dance sec
tion. Mrs. Betty Voertmall con-
ducts weekly modern dance
workshop, which may be used
by any student as a part of the
physical education requirement,
and oi-chcsis, the perlorming
dance group which practices
twice a week and presents a
concert once a year.

The workshops are not related
to Orchesls. That is, a student
taklllg a workshop is not re-
quired to pertorin in the con-
cert Ior credit. although he or
she may be invited to do so.
There are two workshops open
to all students each semester:
one tor beginning dancers, and
one ior those who have already
had a semester.

Orchesis (which comes trom
a Greek word meaning, “place
tor the chorus ot dancers") Is
the traditional college dance
group's name. Grinnell’s Orche-
sie has 24 members: 16 Women,
8 men. Membership in the group
is gained through an audition
which includes exercises in tech-
nique and In improvisation.
The members of Orchesis judge
the applicants. Experience in
modern dance is not absolutely
necessary, Those who have had
enough experience in various
areas to develop a love tor
dance and a tree imagination
are looked for. Creativity rather
than proliciency in perionn-
ance is encouraged. Although
students generally come with
some kind of ballet or modern
dance training, the emphasis is
on giving the students a chance
to explore movement and their
own ideas. For this Nissan I
good portion of time is spent

What in particular should

“This year," says Coach

“This year," says Coach

though the Grinneii team is

‘BROTHERS' SLAUGHTER
FACULTY ‘lAMBS' 57-37

With a strong surge in the see-
one half, the CBS “Brothers"
clamped a 51-31 defeat on the
Grinnell Faculty "Lambs" in
last Friday's Martin Luther
King, Jr. Scholarship Benefit
game.

The Brothers jumped off to a
quick 10-2 lead in the opening
minutes. But a steady attack
by the faculty and a seeming
cold spell iorced a tight game.
At the halt the Brothers led
by only two baskets.

The half-time festivities con-
sisted of the announcing of the
“Mystery Queen," Miss Odette
deLecluse. Mr. Joseph Wall,
Chairman of the Faculty, an<
nounced her selection to the sur.
prise of all—including her. The
Queen descended from the stands
and passed through a tunnel
formed by the two teams while
the crowd applauded wildly. Mn
Wall awarded her with kissel
and roses.

“1 thank you from the bottom

of my heart,” said the Queen,
addressing her over 600 subjects
present at the game, “For the
first time since i've been so
Grinneli, i’m almost speeclln

less."

The second half was over]
hit as exciting as the first.
“V-I-C~i- S. Are we vicious!
Hell yes!" was the cry or thl
CBS cheerleaders as the Broth-
ers began to gradually increasi
their lead

In spite of their gallant st-
iorls and fancy ball handling.
the faculty could not stymio
the CBS surge. The Brother!
went on to win, 57437.

The game, which
some 600 spectators, netted
$304.43 for the scholarship
fund. The fund, named in holy
or of the late Dr. King, was
initiated by the Concerned
Black Students and endorsed
by the college, It will he used
to aid needy black students.
