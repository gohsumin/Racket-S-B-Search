llmpudenli British Salire Scheduled for Roberts;

British satire invades Rob-
erts Theatre tomorrow evening,
as the Drama department and
Concerts Committee present
“Beyond the Fringe, 1965." The
production, a series of satirical
blackout sketches, will be pre-
sented twice, at 7 and 9:30 pm.
A “Caffe Interlude" in the
Formal lounge of the Forum
will be held between perform-
ances.

The show originated in Eng-
land several years ago, played
on Broadway for two years,
and is appearing at Grinnell as
part of a simeonth tour of

American colleges and univer»
sities.

“. . . They are marvelously
impudent about everybody and
everything." according to one
critic. Their subjects cover
such areas as sex, Shakes-
peare, religion, war, Queen
Elizabeth, the race issue, con-

 

cert pianists, television, and
Bertrand Russell.

The touring production stars
Robert Cessna, Donald Cullen,
Patrick Horgan and ‘James
Valentine. It was directed and

produced by Alex Cohen, who
was also responsible for the
Broadway version, which won
the Drama Critic's award in
1962.

Beyond The Fringe. 1965' Given Twice Tomorrow

The humor of the satirical
sketches is typically British,
keenedged and subtle, It is uni-
versal and sophisticated in
tone, aimed at the intellectual
audience. The players concen-
trate on the “wild inversions"
of common sense that pass for
cogent public utterance in Eng-
land and every other nation,”
and the “fatuous blather hand-
ed down as holy writ.”

Walk Right In . . .

First it was the barracks, with worn floors and
cracked windows; then it was just a hole in the ground.
And. now, It’s many things —— for the college, on im-
portant calling card that attracts the eye of the loa-
nevolent donor as well as the wistful gaze of the hope-
ful prospective; for the newcomer, an exciting addition
to the Grinnell scene; to the oldtimer, who once danced
behind the old fireplace and later stood by to look into
that large hole, a sparkling wonder; and for the cynic,
.Who will always complain first, a glass menagerie.

II’ORTS REPORTERS ”um—mm.”

But no matter what vocabulary you deal in, there’s
no doubt about one thing — tonight is the Night of the
Forum, when the new campus center opens its doors
and invites each and every one of you into its expansive

glough expensive embrace, Never before have Grinnell
allege students had such a deluxe toy placed before
them, nor has any structure been raised before, on
campus that encouraged relaxation and recreation in
such a varied social and cultural manner.

At first you probably won’t know what to do with
it. The idea of having any one of five areas in which to
lounge just might scare you into not lounging. at all,

and the idea of having espresso coffee served to you
when before one had to stand in line to beg a tea bag
might choke a few appetites. And there will be those
who will never be able to properly say Forum when
they really mean Union,

But for those of you who haven’t waited too long

Farthing Tells Conclusions About Liberal Arts Colleges

To the Editori

After four years of more or
less passive observation I have
come to the following conclu»
sion about the facts of life at
a liberal arts college:

The liberal arts college ex-
ists for two purposes; I) The
primary purpose is the glorifi-
cation of the college and all
people connected with it, in-
cluding the board of twstees,
administration, faculty, alum-
ni, and students. 2) The second»
ary purpose is to convince the
student of the value of liberal
education, and to assist him in
building a foundation of knowl~
edge, about himself as well as
his academic subjects.

Both of these purposes are
good, and they are interrelated.
For example. as the glory or
good reputation of the college
increases, the college receives
more money which can be used
to improve the educational of—
ferings, which in turn assists
In further increasing glory.

Although I do hope to gain
from the rubbing off of any
glory which Grinncll College
has attained or may in the Iu<
ture attain, I feel that I will
profit far more from the educa-

 

tional experience of my years
at Grinnell. It appears to me
that, unfortunately, what should
be the secondary purpose of
the college has become the pri-
mary purpose—that is, glory
has been placed before educa-
tion, when it should be the
other way around.

The academic and cultural
education offered at Grinnell
is good, but social education is
at a prepvschool level.

If education, in the broadest
sense of the word, were the
primary purpose of the college,
then all students would be con-
sidered as ends in themselves
and all decisions concerning
them would be made in their
own best interests and with
their participation. But, in fact,
the primary purpose of the
college is its own glorification,
and individual students are
only a means to this end. Inso-
far as students are a means
to an end and not an end in
themselves they have no rights.
(Except for the right to life
itself, in a biological rather
than popular - psychological
sense, which is guaranteed by
the state.)

The social contract idea is
useful in (his analysis. When a

 

Proctors Called Unnecessary:
Students Can GoVern Selves

To file Edilor

In the past few weeks there has
been much concern over an ex-
plosion of feeling between the ad-

ministration and student govern-
menl. The result has been a rumor,
certainly not denied by the ad-
ministration, that the long threat-

ened "system of advisers” will be.

instituted on North campus next
year. In view of the sentiments ex-
pressed by some members of the
administration on student enforce-
ment of rules, there can be little
doubt that these “advisers" will
also be proctor-s.

The philosophy behind a system
of proctors is basically repugnant,
because it implies, quite Simply,
that students old enough and in-
telligelu enough to Come to Grin
nell are still not capable of govern-
mg themselves. The administra‘
Lion’s reply ro this would seem to
be that unfortunately the students
are not capable of governing them-
selves; look at the recent viola<
tions on North campus. This, how»
ver, is not quite true. Actually,
the case is that the students are
not capable of enforcing the rules
that the adminisfl'al‘lon has pre-
scribed. 1 am referring to rules
such as those on illegal visitation.
lustlrunng a system of proctors
will not effectively solve this prob-
lem of enforcement, because it is
a simple sociological tenet that
laws which do not coincide with
the mores oi the society are very
difficult to enforce. This is the
reason why police have such a
problem With traffic violations.
The unfortunate result of attempt-
ing to enforce these rules that
rlon't cnlncide with the mores is
that eventually all law, even that

 

which has a moral foundation, he-
gins to be held in contempt.

I may be presumpluous in pre-
tending to speak for the entire
campus, but l believe that there
are two rules which the majority
of lhe’studenls feel should be an;
forced: quiet hours, and disorderly
Conduct. Other rules such as those
on illegal Visitation deal with a
person's owu morality which most
people feel should be properly left
to himself. so long as a person's
conduct does not interfere with or
injure someone else. he should be
allowed to go his own way.

What is specially irking is that
I feel that Ihe majority of-the facul-
ty and the administration also hold

,lo this philosophy. However, we

pass the buck to one another. Some
students say we must enforce
these rules because of the adminis
tration; the administration says
it’s the fruslees. and the trustees
say it’s the parents, an amorphous
group from whom it.is almost im-
posslble to obtain a statement of
opinion. It might be said here,
however, that Illef'e are many par-
ents who are more than willing to
Send their Children to schools that
have a far more liberal set of rules

than Grinnell At Northwestern, for'

example, llnderciasswomen have
2:00 AM. hours, and upperclass
women have no hours at all.

an aside from this point. it would
seem that if there is any group in
society that will stand on_princi-
ple, it should be the academic com-

‘muuity. And, we should make and,

enforce only those rules in which
we really believe. If the college
wishes to hold in this policy, I am
quite sure that the students are
capable of elliorcmg it, and that
there is no need for proctors.
Richard Tillatson

 

student enters the college he is
in effect agreeing that he will
glve up any rights which he
previously had. in return for
certain advantages. These ad-
vantages include: the advan-
tage of taking a certain nun»
ber of academic'courses each
semester; the advantage of
taking the liberal arts exam
and senior comp‘s; and finally,
if he utilizes all of these ad—
vantages and doesn’t do any-
thing naughty, the advantage
of graduating. In return for
these advantages he also has
the responsibility to study hard
enough that he doesn’t flunk
out, thus wasting someone's
money and increasing the col<
lege’s dropout rate, which
would damage its glory.

when one is a partner to a
social contract he has no rights
except those which were
agreed to in the contract. The
sovereign power may grant
certain privileges for the sake
of expediency, but these are
not rights, and can be with-
drawn at any time.

Among the rights which are
lost are: the right to stay out
past 12 pm. if you are female;
the right to know "why” if you
are kicked out; the right to
privacy, no matter who you
are; the right to drive an auto-
mobile; the right to drink liq-
uor if over 21 years old. At
the present time the last two
lost rights are returned to cer-
tain students as privileges, but
they may be withdrawn at any
time for infractions of the rules,
or for no reason. Student gov-
ernment is another privilege.

In the neverrending quest for
college rule changes it seems
that some Students think that
their rights are being violated
—they forget that at college
one has no rights,‘ But occas-
ionally, through the benevo~

'lence of the board of trustees

and the administration, more
privileges are granted: for ex
ample, the liberalization of the
drinking rule, Where privileges
are granted it must be expect-
ed by all students that their
peers will accept the conse-

South Younker
Appreciate: Still

To the Editor:

The Student Government As~ '
sociation is an often criticized or-
ganization. The efforts it makes
are not usually of a publicized na-
ture, Much of its work is done
quietly and beyond the sight of the
general student body.

In recognition of lhe vast amount
of time and energy expended by
many SGA ofﬁcials in the last few
Weeks on behalf of South Younkel'
hall, we would like to express our
appreciation publicly. We do this
not only to express our gratitude,
but also to make the Campus
aware of the dedication and hard
work displayed by our SGA lend—
ers.

quent responsibilities: for if
too many students abuse their
privileges, the privileges will
be withdrawn not only from
'tha guilty ones, but also from
the innocent ones. For this
reason, I feel that the anger
over the South Younker case
should be directed toward the
students involved and not to-
ward-the faculty committee. In
many cases rule violations are
understandable, because it is
difficult to obey rules which
seem unjust and irrelevant to
one’s own best interests—but
tn the South Younlrei- case the
rule is, I think, just, and its
yiolation is to be condemned.
I welcome almost any at-
tempt to liberalize the social
and academic rules of the col-
lege, but would—be rule-chang»
ers must realize that they have
,‘10 rights 00 Stand on. “Justice"
is irrelevant, practically speake
ing. In requesting more privi-
leges it is necessary to show
that: 1) the recommended rule
change is for the good of the
students and everyone con-
cerned; Z) the students will ac-
cept the consequent responsi-
bilities; 3) the rule change will
not damage the reputation of
the college, and if possible, will
enhance its glory. The most im»
portant is (3), where»(l) and
(2) should be the most impor-
tant, and would be if educa-
tion rather than glory were the
primary purpose of the college.
This is my view of the situa»
tlon. I don’t like it—for the'
most part I despise it. I wish
Grinnell College were a demo-
cratic society, with a student
government having linal legis-
lative and judicial power in
student affairs, instead of the
authoritarian society that it is.
But as long as this is the way
things are, we are at least better
off if we approach problems
with a realistic attitude and
don't waste time butting our

heads against brick walls.

”To the Ediior:

Time, whose course clarilies

has dealt severely but justly
with the South Younker case.

To the Editori

Having glanced at a pamph-
let in the admissions office re
cently, I discovered that the
number of native Iowans at-
tending Grinnell in 1963 was
approximately 250.

I am unaware of any radical
increase in that number this
year. Perhaps the red haze
apparently clouding the eyes of
last week’s “irate parent,” who
quoted the number as 600-700
plus, is responsible for such a
misinformed statement, as well
as for the general tone of the
letter—~one can only hope that
it was not the product or a
mind operating in its rational

University Of Iowa Issues Details Tradiﬁona' Dinner
0f Bowen's Inaugural Ceremonies

Former Grinnell President
Howard R. Bowen will be in
augurated as president of the
University of Iowa tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 in the ﬁeld
house at Iowa City. The public
is invited to the ceremony. Dr.
and Mrs. Bowen have extended
a. special invitation for the in
augural ceremony to all Grin-
nell college students and iac'ul-
ty and to their many friends
in the Grinnell area.

The inaugural ceremony will
include an address by Bowen
as he becomes the university’s
14th president. His investiture
will be by A. w. Noehren, pres-
ident of the State Board of
Regents. Following the core
mony there will be a reception
in the North gymnasium oi the
field house.

The ceremony will include a
fanfare played by the Iowa
band and composed for the oc-
casion by Richard Hervig, U.
of 1. music professor, The in-
vestiturs will feature a gold
medal created for the inaugura-
tion in the university's on de-
partment.

More than 60 universities
and colleges plan to send rep-
resentatives to the ceremony
for the new president of the na-
tion’s 25th largest university.
At least 22 other college pres-
idents will take part in the
ceremony, a wellrknown tra-
dition of higher education,

uration ceremony will be filled
with various university events
considered a part of the inaug—
ural atmosphere. Lectures, con-
certs, plays, a major art ex-
hibit, and a symposium will be
included. ,

“The University and the Fu-
ture." a theme implicit in the
inauguration of a new presi-
dent, will be the topic explored
at th e symposium, which
opens on Inaugural Day at

would like to thank Mr. William
I-lazelton oi Alexandria, Virginia
for his warm hospitality in extend»
my to me an invitation for Spring
.Vacation. I have accepted this in-
vitation tentatively, until my pass
port into Virginia is cleared

I would like to call your atten-
tion to a movie that will soon be
playing at our neighborhood thea-
tre, “One Potato," TWO Potato.”
This clearly is a rnone that has
been aimed at your lacrymal
glands and does indeed, hit the
target. With a relatively undistin—
guished cast, it manages to kill
the sacred cow of racial intermar-
riage Lhroughon unescapable ap-
peal to the emotions. No believer
in God, country and American
motherhood can remain unmoved.
The little blond coed sitting in back
of me in the Minneapolis theatre
where I saw the movie, gave me a
little hope that there was really
an America as she moaned softly
to her equally blond date, “Poor
Sammy Davis.”

For those of you out there who
are wondering why yours truly has
not joined the Grinnell Civil Rights

 

Shades of Gray.

Group: it; is not, as was rumored,
that I did not have the fifty cents
membership dues. The facts are
that I consider it totally ineffective.

There are many reasons for my
belief: 1) Although in the past and
present the officers of this group
have exhibited good judgment, i
feel that alliance with an organi-
zation such as the NAACP neces-
sarily limits the activity of the
group, 2) Since we are in Iowa —
rather, since we are in Grinnell—
the racial problem, by virtue of
the dearth of local persons of color,
is nonexistent, 3) Voter registra-
tion trips to Des Moines have not
proved to be anything more than
Saturday excursions .tor civic
minded matrons. 4) Campus speak-
ers on Civil Rights, sponsored by
the GGRG this year have been few,
in fact, none.

Now then, let's examine these
one by one, in order to clear up
any misconceptions Mr. Burnham
and his entourage may arrive at
otter reading'Gray’s 4 theses

Firstly, like it or not, the

NAACP represents the must con-'

servative 'of all the major civil
rights groups (The Urban League
and the Black Muslims are OUT).
Its conservatism is manifested
mainly in its reliance on cuurt
cases and legal procedures. These
in themselves'are well and good,

SCARLET ,AND BLACK

And Furthermore

there is a place {or them - not
here.

As students, it would seem that
we would naturally'lall into the
category of “flaming romanticists"
and reel a bit hampered by the per-
haps middle-aged moderate mud<
eratlon offered by this group. SNCC
and CORE represent what I believe
to be student thought. steeped in
mid-westernism though we are, l
believe that as students the words
“action” and “demonstration”
should have an uncontrollable ap-
peal to us.

Next, although we are limited by
our environment as to the extent
of our activities, a more active
role in a more active organization
would open new doors. A test case
here and there, a letter writing
campaign, {and raising drives
might prove to he more lruitlul
than registering white Republicans
in Des Moines.

Finally, a more extensive PR
campaign with speakers and pub-
licity galore, not only on campus
but in town. For example, after
numerous incidents the clientele
of the Dixie Inn might benefit
from a few lessons in them” of
Americanism,

Thus, Grinneil’s highest unpaid
professional Negro puts in his bid
tor the presidency’ot next year's
version of the GCRG—that is if he
can dig up titty cents to join it.

Sthwengel Calls for
Moderation in GOP

Republican Congressman Fred
Schwengel (Iowa, ﬁrst dist.) told
an audience here Wednesday night
that “the only way out at the Re-
publican dilemma Is to accept the
creed of moderation."

Speaking in Roberts Theatre as a
guest of the campus Young Repub-
licans, Schwengel said that "the
moderates did not get organized
and center on a candidate for the
Republican national convention last
summer at San Francisco They
were not sufficiently concerned I
hope they have learned their les<
son."

Schwengel was narrowly defeat-
ed In the Nov. 3 election as he
sought his sixth term in Congress
Democrats, behind Gov. Harold E.
Hughes, generally swept the state
of Iowa in that election

. Continuing his stand tor moder-
ation, Schwengel said, “We eam-
, estly believe and give to concemed
people the asurance that modera-
tion is best because it is a spirit
that does not press advantage too
far — it is an attitude that seeks
to understand and will respect the
inﬂuences that drive people to ex-
tremes — it is a reeling that senses
a need for a unity of all people -—
it is arspirit that recognizes the
common fate and aspirations of
human beings with a faith in the
sacredness of man"

Poor Shooting Leads lo Loss
As Basketball Season Siarls

By Steve Casey

Grinnell started its basketball
season with a 89-76 loss to Angus»
tana on Tuesday night. The game
was close for the iirst half with
Augustana taking a 44—40 lead, But
Grinnell let up at are beginning of
the second half and Augustana
Spurled to a fifteen point lead that
they protected for the rest of the
game.

Poor shooting was a big factor in
the loss. Grinnell got enough shots
but could not make enough of them
to keep the pressure on the Augus-
tano defense. The Grinneli defense
employed a manta-man full court
press for most of the game. This
gave Augustana some easy shots
when a small Grinnell player
Would be forced to guard a tall
Augustana player under the basket.
But Coach Pfitsch was doing some
experimenting to see if he Could de-
velop a defense for the small Pio»
neers to use against some future
tall opponents Grinllell will face.

Coach Ffitsch was pleased with
the work of his front line. Jim
Rhodes seems to have recovered
from a pro-season injury and
played well. Ted Risser and Clyde
Smith also played commendable
games. Pfitsch though was di5<
appointed with the play of the
guards whom he is relying on.

Wrestlers Open Al
Knox This Weekend

A defending champion plus third
and fourth place finishers from a
ear ago will lead the Grinnell
ollege wrestling team when it
opens its 1964455 season at Knox
Invitational in Galesbur‘g, on Fri~
day and Saturday.

Captl Larry Miller, is the defenda
ing champion The 167~pollnder has
lost only one regular season match
in two seasons as a Pioneer, that
at the Knox inVltational two sea-
sons back when he came in sec
and. In 1963, he took the title with
it pin and two decisions.

Other Grinnell placers last year
were Ken Strubler, third at 130,
and Morgan Michel, fourth at
heavyweight. Coach Edd Bowers
is counting on all three to place
high again this year.

Letterman Bill Barnes will be Rt
123 and is another likely placer,
but the rest of the lineup is a ques-
tloxl mark. Mike Deatherage, Cliff
Dowling, and Lynn Richman, all
sophomores, will probably fill the
137., 147., and lsrpounol spots, but
Bowers hasn't decided on the or-
del'.

Bob Geller, another sophomore,
is the likely 177rpounder. At 19l,
veteran Marty Ringo is a question
mark because of a knee injury.

The loss of two certain regulars
has added to Bowers woes. Ken
Clymer, last year's 157-pounder,
dropped from the squad, and Jeff
Lewis, one of the 1963M squad
leaders, hasn't come out. However,
Lewis, a 177-pounder, may join the
squad after Christmas.

Bowers also plans to take nine

rinnell freshmen to me meet.

hey are Mike Martinson, 115; Jim

Klnyon, 123; Joel Richman. 130;
Rich Segool, 137; John Sharpe, 147;
Jeff Patterson, 157; Louis Kelley,
167 Dr 177; Tom McLaughlin, 167
or 177; and Phil Jones, heavy-
Weight.

 

The starting lineup against Cor-
nell Saturday will be Jeff Franz
and Eliot Hibbs at guard, Jim
Rhodes at Center, and Ted Risser
and Tom Hill. at forwards with
Clyde Smith as the sixth marl. Sat-
urday's opponent Cornell is the top
team in the league according to
pro-season forecasts.

Pfitsch as he drills his Pio—
neers for their Midwest Con-
ference opener against Cornell

Game time is 7:30.

Pfitsch plans to stick with
the same starters he used
against Augustanar They are
lettermen Ted Risser and. Jeff
Frantz and sophomores Tom
Hill, Jim Rhodes, and Elliott
Hibbs.

Risser, Rhodes, Front: and
Hill all tallied nine or more
points, with Risser’s is the top
number.

Also due for extensive duty
are Clyde Smith, who notched
10 in‘a reserve role, Bob Watt,
Randy Morgan. and Dave Sela
lergren as Pﬁtsch continues his
search for the most effective
combination,

Cornell is one of the title fav-
orites ohough Coach Paul Maas-
ka’s erman squad includes six
sophomores. The sophs were
unbeaten as freshmen a year
ago and were ranked as one of
the top units in Cornell history.

The Ram leader is forward

developed for the first spot in
I. M. Volleyball between three
contenders—North, Smith, and
Rawson. North leads the pack

Smith (20-4) has moved up a

Ali

By Paul Trigg

I continue this week with
what, quite tragically, appears
to be the only issue which peo-
ple concerned with Grinneli can
address themselves to in our
school paper—that of the “jock
image." Again. I hope that by
delving further into this prob-
lem I will be able to make
both the context of the problem
and my own feelings more ex-
piicit.

The most obvious, and there-
fore most easily overlooked,
fact involved in this problem
is that no one is admitted to
Grinnell who is intellectually
dull. Certainly one could not be
naive and. absurd enough to
suggest that the admissions de-
partment is admitting “dumb
athletes" who do not have the
potential to add something to
this institution or are not able
to appreciate the many advan-
tages which it offers
, Secondly, as Mr. Pl H. Pat-
terson (class of 42) so adroitiy
pointed out in his letter last
week, there are many Grin—
neil athletes who attain fine
records both at and after Grin—
nelI. The oft—used grade point
comparisons (Athletes 2.7, all
North Campus 2.6), the fact
that three of seven Friars are
lettcrmen, and the many fine
individual a C hie V ements of
Grinnell athletes after gradua-
tion are evidence of this, For
mis article, however, I would
like to eliminate those athletes
with better than a B average,
for generally they are consid-
ered to be academicians rath-
er than part of the “jock
image.” Whether this is fair or
unfair is irrelevant in mis Con-
text. It is the 3‘0 and under
athletes which constitute the
‘jock image" to most students
and faculty on campus.

1 stated in my original article
that it was unfortunate that the
”jock image" was too often
nonacademic. More unfortun-
ately, I am afraid this image is
often a false one which is for-
mulated prior to adequate ex»

perience. Too often students
and faculty fail to judge these
gentlemen as individuals rath-
er than as a ‘jockﬂ‘ There is no
reason to believe that the man
with the Honor G jacket is not
as concerned with who he is and
the nature of man and society
as the long-haired rebel in
boots.

The obvious question now is
what does all this mean? It
means that although Grinnell
may admit a few people who,
except for athletics would not
have been, and as I stated last
week even this is controversial,
the athlete is too often not giv-
en a chance to become an "in-
tellectual." For reasons far be-
yond the Grinnell campus, the
word "athlete" seems to have
noninteliectuei o o n n otations.
