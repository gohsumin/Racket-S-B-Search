at a Fort Lauderdale high School, before coming to New York in 1955.

After a year’s association with .T. J. Johnson, and later with
Woody Herman, Adderly organized his present band. This association
saw Adderly's reunion with his brother Nat, also in the process of

building a career in jazz.

Adderly’s admirers attribute much or his popular appeal to his
“outgoing attitude" and his “tasteful and humorous use of the spoken

word" during concerts.

The recorded performances of the "Cannonball" Adderly Sextet

have exceeded one million sales.

House Leader
To Talia Here

November 17713 will bring this
politician in residence—
Carl Albert, House Majority Leada
er, whose major topic has been
tentatively set as the role of a
majority leader in promoting ad-
ministration legislation.

Tile 5’4” Rhodes scholar and nan
tive of Bug Tussle (since renamed
Flowery Mound), Okla., deals With
what Time dubbed “the most lop-
sided Democratic Congress since
the one that convened in 1937.”

After winning his first election
to the House in 1946. Albert
crossed the Red River to visit and
be advised by Sam Rayburn who
informed him that “muse that go
along, get along.” Albert duly apr
plied himself, studied the House
and its members carefully, and
became Whip in 1955.

The Program in Practical Politi-
cal Education is also considering a
conference on poverty, to be led
by Congressman Quie from Minne-
sets in late October, but this is
contingent on the date Congress ad-
joums.

 

Report on Encampment Released;
Student Responsibility Discussed

Now that the Encampment Plan-
ning Committee has issued a report
on the conclusions reached by the
five discussion groups, the aver-
age Grinnell student can also mull
over the problems or lite on the
campus,

The encampment at Boone Sept.
i7-i9 seemed to center attention
more on trying to understand gen-
eral problems rather than pre-
senting concrete proposals.

One of the major problems dis-
cussed was that of student re-
sponsibility. The group on Hall
Lite said in the final report that
more freedom from the college as
a whole was desirable. One way
to help achieve this, they decided,
was through open dorms. It was
realized, however, that greater
confidence would have to exist be
tween students and administration
before this would be feasible. A-
long this same line, the committee
was hopeful that action could be
taken to obtain more college wag-

Courts Consider
Drinking Charges

During a closed, joint session or
Men's and Women‘s Primary
Court Sunday, charges of drinking
in the south Lounge of the Forum
were considered against three stu-
dents.‘

The trio was charged with two
different offenses: providing liq»
uor for others and drinking in a
hall or lounge. The first of the
two charges was dropped.

The remaining charge against
one of the three defendants, in
Dibble sophomore, was dropped.
The court then considered the sin
gla charge against a Dibble sell-
ior and at Cleveland sophomore.

The two were found guilty as
charged, and the court said that
it would hand down a sentence at
a later date.

The drinking incident took place
$ept. 15 at a meeting in the South
Lounge ot a group interested in
olvil rights and Students for a
Democratic Society type groups.

There was only one prosecution
witness and that witness was un-
able to say for sure that she had
seen the drinking However. both
deleniiants had pleaded guilty.

‘. . . Virginia Woolf?’ Receives Special Recognition

By CONNIE SIMON

Freshman Theatre Workshops
performances, presented in Arena
Theatre this week, gave, on the
whole, the impression that there
is plenty or acting potential at-
mong this year’s crop oi dramatic
hopefuls.

In all, four scenes from {our dif-
ferent plays were presented.
These included Murray Schisgal’s
Luv, Arthur L. Kopit's 0h Dad,
Poor Dad, Jean Kerr's Mary, Mary
and Who‘s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf? by Edward Albee. The
quality of individual performances

varied a good deal, as could be ex-
pected, although at least one out
standing performer appeared in
each scene.

The indisputable climax of the
evening came at the end, however
with the performance of Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? 0n the
basis of overall fine characterize»
tions, dramatic intensity. and
depth of portrayal, this scene and
the people involved in it deserve
special recognition.

The scene, which required an
enormous amount of sophistication
and understanding on the part oi
its cast and director. involved the

portrayal of numerous challenging
emotions and the like. Brenda
Thomas, who had the female lead,
played the part of an alcoholic
woman driven almost mad be-
cause of her own sterility. Others
in the play, Bill Downey, Debby
Abbott, and Dennis Rich, were re
quired to create equally complex
illusions in the form of difficult
character portrayals The scene
was ably directed by Dennis
Rich, a junior drama major, who
also took over the role at George
in the play when the person orig-
inally cast became unable to per-
form. ,

ans and/or to liberalize the drlvl
ing regulations,

The possibility ot integrated
campuses was discussed by both
the committees on Hall Life and
The College and the Students,
Under the present system, the
only areas for relaxed coreducar
tional contact are the classrooms,
the library, and the Forum. By
integrating the campuses these
areas would be enlarged to include
going back and forth to classes,
dining. and meeting informally in
the residence lounges.

Perhaps the most provocative
solution offered was that of divid-
in the campus between lower
division (freshmen and sophos
mores) and upper division (itin-
iors and seniors). Such a plan, it
was felt, would abolish the present
artificial division by sex. Separate
regulations would be established,
allowing the college to place some-
what restrictive regulations on
underclassmen, but also permit:
ting a greater degree of freedom
to the upperclassmen.

Grinnellians Travel to Des Moines
To Prepare for Civil Rights Project

Last Saturday afternoon, nine
Grinnell students rode into Des
Moines to find out more about the
Grinnell Civil Rights Group’s Des
Moines Project. Originally the slu~
dents had planned to survey the
residents of the slum area. which
is just north of the downtown dis-
trict, where they will be working.
instead they decided to listen to
the project's permanent worker in
Des Moines, Billy King, describe
the local situation in relation to
the project's problems and pros-
pects ior the hiture.

Those Grinnellians who went
were: Jean Vandervoort, Jane
Prescott, John Wecktor, Ian Smith,
Sam Donohoe, Ellen Linéoln,
pruce Armstrong, Bonnie Tinker,
erlecia Oldfnther; nnd~Jeff Hort.

King and Miss Vandervoort
staged a mock interview to dem-
onstrate ta Ute students how best
to approach residents when sur-
veying dues begin. King also said
that an organization oi Des Moines
high school students called Youth
for Freedom will Work on the
project.

The main goals oi the project
will be voter registration. action
on pending urban renewal plans oi
the city and the organization at
an area board in connection with
the federal War on Poverty. Sev-
eral students mentioned that
through this project the students
hoped to relieve some of the sense
of powerlessness felt by slum resi»
dents. King said that he wanted
to show the people that they can
fight city hall.

cci-ncd, we've always “gone to the

in the past dozen years or so, and
perhaps never, have the tilm offer»

melancholy tact is that only a few

Sophs, Juniors:
Dare to Face Need

An Open Letter to Sophomores and
Juniors:
NOW is the time to stop and
think. why aren’t you going to
LeMoyne? You think it's a great
idea, don’t you; out ior someone
else. How many reasons have you
created to avoid deciding to go?
I know them all, and there are
manyAl came up with them all
myselt. It’s very easy to find ex-
cuses for staying in your comfort-
able Grinnell rut, for not having
to face yourscli in a new and
challenging position. But now, to
day, is the time to face yourself,
to dare to say "I can. i will."

No major is so inﬂexible that
you will not graduate it you miss
a semester, no class is so exclu»
sively Grinnell’s that it cannot be
taken at LeMoyne. or one oi
Memphis' other three colleges if
necessary. No organization is go-
ing to tail apart it you leave, and
ynur hall will survive with a new
bafﬂeboard or house council mem-
ber. And it you and that special
girl or guy can’t lace a semes-
ter apart. . .You are not indis-
pensible at Grinnell.

LeMoyne needs you, however.
The faculty, administration, Ind
most of all. the students, want this
exchange program to work. it is
our choice as to whether or not
it will continue. There Is another
world at LcMoyne, in Memphis; a
world waiting to be understood.
wanting to share its joys and
sorrows. Them are friends in
Memphis, waiting for you. There
are hours or conversation hanging

force you to discover yourself, for
you will be challenged to explain

dren whose eyes will glow at your

Plans Going Ahead for New College;
Si. Olaf Assists Tuskegee Negroes

By PAUL BRADLEY

Four professors from Amherst,
Smith, Mount l-loiyoke, and the
University of Massachusetts met in
the Summer of 1958 to draw up
the plan ior is new college equi-
distant from the {our existing in-
stitutions. But not until Harold F.
Johnson, Amherst class of 1918,
gave six million did these college
plans come out of storage, The
new college will be known as
Hampshire College and will oper—
ate as a coeducational liberal arts
institution. Through cooperation
oi the tour schools, Hampshire
should be completed by May of
1968.

The new institution Will serve as
a catalyst to accelerate the co-
ordination of the tour surrounding
colleges, will experiment with ed-
ucational innovations, and hope-
fully will substantially reduce the
cost or a college education without
impairing its quality. Freshmen
would attend seminars consisting

 

of twelve students each; students
would study only three courses at
a time, making possible greater
concentration of effort; and inde-
pendent and student group work
would be substantially emphtlr
sized.
it n o

Sixty~five students from St. Olaf
spent the summer in Tuskegee,
Ala. They lived with Negro fam—
ilies and tutored the adults. Many
oi the adults previously could not
write their own names and had
never heard classical music.

The tutors worked under the
s u m in e r Education Program,
which is federally financed
through the Office of EcUnomic
Opportunity and the Office at Ed-
ucation. Altogether there were six
hundred tutors, five hundred and
thirty of them Negroes, working
in the area surrounding Tuskegee
Institute. The Summer Education
Program is spoken of as a second
front to the civil rights movement,
but the tutors are forbidden to
demonstrate.

The topic immediately became
the main proposal or the “College
and the Students" group, chaired
by Rick Edwards: “D ide the
campus between low8r division and
upper division.” in other words,
house all freshmen and sopho-
mDres on one campus and the
upperclassmen on the other.

This topic monopolized the dis-
cussion ior 50 minutes. Arguments
about the relative maturity at the
campus, the desirability of con-
tact between them. and the possi-
bility of a system or graduated
regulations were presented and
refuted.

New Grinnell Professors

“The kind of education at a good
liberal arts school is as close to
one kind of an educational ideal
as possible, which is one or the
things that brought me to Grin-
nell,” Malcolm A. Nelson, new
assistant protessor of English,
said.

Nelson. who received his mas»
ler‘s and doctorate at Northwes
tern after completing undergradu-
ate work at Williams, went on to
say that the size of the school and
the outlook on undergraduate ed-
ucation which he described as
“fairly broad and general," avail
both students and teachers of the
opportunity to become more aware
of things and people outside their
own area.

niter working as a graduate as.
sistant at Northwestern and teach-
ing tor six years at Miami in
Oxford, Ohio, Nelson ﬁnds Grin-
nell a place where people are not
segregated by their specialty, and
so less limited in their approach
to education.

Dawson Studies English Economy,
Observes lomlon'siﬁglter Education

By RONALD LANE

John C, Dawson (economics)
spent his leave last year in Lon-
don doing research on the English
financial system and observing
English higher education He spent
much of his time at the London
School of Economics.

Dawson commented about the
English higher educational system
saying. “I visited classes irorn
time to time to see how they op»
ei-tited. The British undergradu-
ates in economics, especially the
seniors, are quite a bit further
along than those in the country.
They are reading the journals and
basic works of the field instead
of text books."

Graduate Level Law

“On the other hand," he went
on to say, "the graduate level ed-
ucatlon is not as well developed
[here as it is here The LDnan
School of Economics has recently
started offering a course program
tor its master's degree in econo-
mics. The school does not yet care
ry iormal graduate study as tar
as we do in the U.S.7IH fact this
can apply to all social studies and
not just to economics.

Dawson continued by saying that
"it used to be that Oxford, Cam-
bridge, and London were the only
real centers of higher learning in
England, but now the new regional
universities are looking very good
>such as the University or Sussex,
and the University at Essex."

Dawson said that there are no

 

liberal arts colleges in England
“for everyone there goes to a unl~
versity tor a particular tield or
study."

Dawson's research consisted of
working on the national financial
accounts for the United Kingdom—
in particular the statistics or var-
ious hairbank financial Institutions
such as insurance companies and
building societies.

His field or specialization is what
is called “llowofrfunds analysis."

He said that he “wanted to see
what the British were doing in
this field” and to use these data
in his analysis or the British econ-
only.

He knew they were “somewhat
behind in these developments."
but he saw that they were “prim
gressing very rapidly." However,
they had not yet put together the
particular data he was seeking.
They lacked a financial statement
for all the non-bank financial
institutions.

The “Old Lady"

Dawson contributed to the sta-
tistical work being done at the
Bank or England and observed
that the “Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street" was a “colorful institu-
tion.”

“It (the bank) is one or the
oldest central banks in the world,
much like a very inscrutable old
lady—very conservative," said
Dawson “The guards still wear
bright red vests, rosecoiored tails,
and black top hats. Although the

 

managing and the decision-making
in this batik were secret, the re-
search department was very help-
ful."

“In the‘Eank of England," com-
mented Dawson, “everyone start—
ed as a clerk and worked up irom
there. This is typical. Professional
economists are just starting to ap-
pear In business and government.
except for a few economic advise
ers in high places.”

Enormous Cultural Life

Dawson also expressed his enthuv
siasni tor London, noting that
”just by living there, one becomes
automatically interested in archi-
tecture, history. literature, and
the arts.”

“London has an enormous cula
tural life," said Dawson. "The
theaters are numerous, excellent,
and less expensive than they are
here. London has rive symphony
orchestras and the renowned CovA
enant Gardens ballet and opera."

He also noted that the “English
people are unfailingly polite, The
class structure that used to be so
pronounced IS gradually becoming
blurred. This my possibly began
in World War it when they were
all in the bombings together. The
educational system is also become
ing more and more democratic.
although there are still some very
excluswe private schools.“

Bus Serviee Good

“Many things in London don’t
appear uptodate to Americans
who are likely to be critical of
the lack or modern household ap~
pliances,” Dawson pomted out.
He went on to say that the "public
transportation system is very
good. You never have to wait
more than tive minutes for a bus,
which is good tor a sprawling
city.”

“There is one conﬂict that the
British have to face from the
point of view of the national econo-
mic level," said Dawsmi, “It they
try to develop domestically as ra-

pidly as they would like to, their
balance oi international payments
will be upselr To solve the later
they have to slow the former. They
thus call it a ‘stop and go’ economy.
International trade is, oi course,
a more important aspect of the
British economy than of the Ameiu
ican economy."

“Another problem for the Britv
ish is that, as they become more
modernized, many of the pleasant—
ei- parts at their traditional way
at life may disappear. improved
housing and highways could mar
ihe beauty oi the countryside, In
many or the older towns there
are 14th, 15th, and 16th Century
buildings that cannot remain it dea
cent roads are to be had. This is
a serious problem at Oxiord,"

Katz Works on Book

For the past year, Seymour
Katz (English) has been on leave
to carry out independent research
work for a book he wlll write.

The research work was done at
Widener Library, which is located
at Harvard University. Widener is
one of the largest research librar-
ies in the United States. Katz
stated that he found much enjoy-
ment “wandering through Willem
er's stacks and Iindlng books i
never knew existed.”

While at Harvard, Katz studied
the changes in Nathaniel Haw~
[home's distinctive conception of
character and the changes in his
technique or detailed character de-
velopment as they reach a cul—
mination in the Scarlet Letter. He
will now investigate the evolve.
ment or Hawthorne’s imagery and
narrative technique before writing
his book.

Harriers Take Les Duke Second.
Travel to S.C.|. Dual Tomorrow

By BOB KATZ

Grinnell‘s varsity cross country
squad ﬁnished runner—up to win-
ner Luther College in Saturday’s
Les Duke Invitational Meet. It
was the tirst time in the history of
the meet that Grinnell failed to
capture the Winner's trophy.

Luther had a point total of 38,
as compared to 57 tor Grinnell,
108 for St. Ambrose, 113 for Loras,
134 for Black Hawk, 149 for Cor-
nell, 171 for Central, and 233 for
Graceland. The score was not
tabulated [or either Beloit or coe.
because both teams had only tour
finishers. Five runners is the
minimum number needed to score
in cross country meets.

Bradford Ends
Yeats Study

Yeats at Work, Curtis Brad-
iord’s study of all the writings of
William Butler Yeats, was pub-
lished Monday by Southern Illi-
nois University Press.

The publication or the extensive
treatise came in the centennial
year of Yeats’ birth.

Bradford (English) exerts most
of his scholarly ellorts In the World
ot Yeats. His research has already
yielded many articles on the poet.

in 1954-1955, Bradford was a
visiting lecturer in American Lit-
erature at Trinity College in Dub-
lin, while on a Ford Faculty Fel-
lowship which enabled him to
assemble preliminary details tor
the hook. in 1960, a grant irom
the Lilly Endowment gave him
another summer in Dublin where
he was able to delve into papers
otherwise inaccessible, including
unpublished papers in Mrs. Yeats’
possession.

 

Grinnell was again led by John
Sharpe and Jeri Langhan, whose
respective times of 22:11 and 22:28
for the tour mile course were good
enough tor sixth and seventh
place. Ric McDowell ran a line
race, in placing tenth with a time
of 23:23. Hob Grant Captured iii-
teenih place, running 21 seconds
behind McDowell. Steve Brintnall,
Doug Dray. and Spence Clarke
rounded out the varsity entree in
19th, 23rd, and 28th places respec-
[ivelyr

The lootball crowd was treated
to a fine pertormanoe by Gene
Takle of Luther, The defending
NCAA small college three and six
mile champion won by a wide
margin in a time of 21:08. His
teamaies placed titth, eighth, elev-
enth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, in
clinching the team championship.
Other strong individual pertoi-m.
ers were Dennis Karnstedt of Cen-
tral, Bob Johnson of Black Hawk,
and Larry Gusman, who took sear
mid, third, and iourth place honors
respectively.

Coach Dick Young was some-
what disappointed over the team’s
lack of cohesiveness. He stressed
that he wants this team unity to
be achieved by bringing the trail.
ing runners up to the trontrun-
uers, rather than having the lead-
ers slow down.

Rain continued to hamper the
training methods of the team. The
wet turt has made it impossible
tor Coach Young’s harriers to do
the repetitive short distance speed
Work which is so vital to a run-
ner's conditioning. Overdistance
running, eight to ten miles per
day, has had to SllﬂiCEt

Tomorrow the varsity will travel
to the State College at Iowa tor

a diving catch to intercept a Jer-

got back in and ground out three
first downs and ran out the clock
to wrap-up the victory.

Coach Edd Bowers was pleased
with the over-all play of his team
in the opening contest, but noted
several areas where improvement
is needed. He was satisfied with
the way the sophomores played
and the way their enthusiasm was
able to help them and the upper»
classmen cover up some errors.

He thought there were no spac-
‘tacular tackles or defensive plays
l but that totally the play was good.
i'l‘he pass rush was effective and
the defensive backfield play was
commendable, although there were
a couple monstrous blunders. He
felt the line play against the rush
up the middle was a little weak,
bul fortunately Cornell did not ex-
ploit this weakness.

This Week the Pioneers will be
taking on another favorite for the
conference title, Ripon. Coach
Bowers mentioned that Ripon
does many at the same things it
did last year in its win over us,
it has a tough up»the-midd1e run-
ning attack to go with a good
passing game. The Redmen rolled
up 412 yards in its 3&7 win over
Knox last week. Bowers though
thinks they have no speed and only
a little size on the Pioneers.
