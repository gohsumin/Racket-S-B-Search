“I don’t believe in the ‘ln Loco
Parentis’ conceptr The time iii
gone when the administration of a
college can regulate student mor-
ality; besides. I look too young to
be anyone's father," said 47-year-
old Dr. Glenn Leggett during an
interview Monday.

Grinnell’s new president thinks
that freshmen need to be guided
through their first year; “then
regulatory controls should be red
laxed."

No specific proposals will be
coming from the president's office
for a while. Dr. Leggett says he
still needs some time up look the
situation over. He wasn’t cone
tacted about the presit’ runtll
late in May.

He was offered me post un July
9 and officially accepted on July
12. Dr. Leggett's appointment was
effective Sept. 1, but he won't be
on campus permanently until Sept.
16‘ or 17r

To get to know Grinpell better.
Drr Leggett will start talking with
the college constituency about in
promises and problems.

"My concern is mainly with the
academic environment. I want to
arrive at a definition of the aca<
demic environment at Grinnell.
Our definition will, however. need
constant reevaluation to prevent a
stagnant environment."

‘Dr. Leggett was provost of the
University of Washington in Seattle
since 1963. He had been directou'
of freshman English, special asslst-
ant to the president, and vice pro-
vost.

He has a BA. from Middlebury
College and an MA and Ph. D.
from Ohio State University. He
taught at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Ohio State be.
fore going to Washington.

In other comments, Dr. Leggett
said, "I’m not an ‘either-ar' man
in the field of education. I believe
in public education, but l recognize
the special integrity and responsi<
bility of a small liberal arts
school."

Also, Dr. Leggett sees taculty
salaries, the residence hall situa<
tion and monetary support for tho
college as some of the big issue!
that must he faced this year a!
Grinneiir

Dr. Leggett said he has observed
a healthy feeling of respect and
pride for Grinnell among all seg-
ments of the Grinneil community
without reaching the proportion:
of selfrglory found at some schools.

Dr. Leggett explained, "when
you reach a certain age. you want
to be in a situation where you are
still growing. This is why I came
tl) Grinnell. And I intend to be the
president here."

Trustee Nollen Dies

Gerard S. Nollen, 85, a trustee
emeritus oi Grinnell College and
brother of iormer Grinnell prest.
dent John Nollen, died Saturday
in Des Moines. Nollcn served as
a trustee from ion to 1927 and
from 1932 to 1955.

But it is Nice . . .

Grinnell begins the [all tcl‘m well settled, l

2-8 is the magic numbcr-punctuation—letter com-i
hination that makes any personal contact with the Viet
Nam war needless.

A new president promises he will be the president
3 a comforting thought for those who find personal
initiative too hard to take.

The 5&3 is no longer a repository for scatology.

The Albert Schweitzer Society is as close as any
Grinnellian need get to empathizing with humanitarian
work.

The new science building addition soothes our
fears that Grinnell was not meeting recent and rapid
advances in science —« and architecture.

This year’s freshmen were so well pro-adapted to
college life that they have survived even the stigma of
I peculiar graduation date.

Cries of student tumult that have sprung through
the country don’t seem to be in phase with the Grinnell
lituation.

The rules of the college are acceptable,

The student government is having little difficulty.
The campus is pretty.

The quad is safely locked. inside and out.

The Forum has been accepted.

Perhaps only Langan basement holds out against
‘he ascension of complete bliss, and maybe even that
problem will have a solution following next weekend’s
encampment.

But it is nice to be back, isn't it?

Under a new policy, iaculty
members will receive free sllbr

increase the exchange of ideas
between faculty and students.

Letter Policy

The 5&3 prints only signed

wishing to submit a letter for

This year the Forum is presenting a series of
ﬁlms that will be shown every Monday night at
10-30 in the South Lounge beginning Sept. 13.
They Wlll be (thus by independent American
rum-makers within the last twenty years. These
ﬁlms. unlike the Commercial Hollywood movies,
are short. do not necessarily follow a dramatic
plot line, and are experimental Ill that the film-
maker are exploring the infinile and complex
possibi ties oi him as an art form.

Film. as an art form, has long been ignored
in this country With the advent of Sound and tech-
nical improvements and advancements, movie
makers slrived to make ﬁlm record llfe exactly
as one sees it. Movies, unlike plays, could be
distributed and shown all over the country more
easily and less expensively. The profits to be
gained from this enterprise were great, for
mDVleS became the entertainment for and a
habit or the general public. Because of the large
protits involved. move makers could make more
elaborate productions that necessarlly catered to
the taste of the masses. From this we have the
growth of Hollywood and the star system,

The big business approach to moviemaking
in this country kept film from being realized as
an art form by serious appreciators and palrnns
of the traditional artsr Until recently American
universities have not recognized ﬁlm in the
classroom except for documentary and instruc-
tive purposes. or in their cultural programs ex-
cept as an entertaining Saturday night way of
relaxation.

The serious filmmaker has had to light for
recognition as an artist and support (rpm the
intellectuals and art lovers. They have bad to
struggle against the economic dynasty and the
gross image and concept of what him-making is
that Hollywood has built up. They have had to be
content with a minute audience for their work.
The influential critics barely acknowledge the
progress of avant garde filmmakers. The experi-
mental film-maker has had to work with a low
budget. which does have some advantages. For
instance. he doesn't have to worry about his lilm

being a commercial success — it‘s not intended
lo be. He does the creating, planning. filming.
and editing himself, so he doesn't have [0 com-
promise his al'llSUC sense in order to please the
important box office producers, stars, and movie
companies,

European experimental films have achieved
a certain status as art in this country, Hope-
luliy. this success will change Ille attitude of the
American public and the critics toward (llm,
Many universities. such as NYU, Yale. and Dark
mouth. are offering courses in film technique and
production and film appreciation. More and more
film festivals feature works of the American
avant garde ﬁlmmakers.

Through Various difficulties, the film-maker l5
defining his art form. for truly film is the an of
the 20th century. The possibilities oi the medhim
are Vast and already dislinct schools of ﬁlm are
developing. The camera can serve as a subjec-
tive eye seeking particulars in order to empha<
size their beauty or slgnificance to the universe,
or it can serve as a stationary objective Viewer
of life and nature.

Film poetry utilizes visual imagery and sym-
bollsm. Editing and the speed of action of camera
and object give film rhythm. The restrictions of
the rectangular image and the two dimensional
picture give film a discipline which film-makers
use to the advantage of their an. Leaps in time
are possible in fllm. In (his way film is like the
mind w while remaining always in the present.
it can dwell on the past and future all in a mat-
ler of seconds. A soundtrack can be used to con-
flict, contrast. 01' harmonize with the Visual
image. The use of color or black and white or
the combination ol the two adds yet another
dimension m the fllm~makers' art.

The Forum lilm program will cover a variety
of [ilmrmakers Who have explored and created
new ways of using him. Movmg-going is a habit
that we have all grown up with. These films make
us more aware of the art and technique we have
been watching for years. Like all art. they should
make us more perceptive to and conscious or our
own lives and the World around usr

Cans Replace Breakable Bottles
,In Campus Pep-Vending Machines

With the advent of the new cola
lege calendar, the new science
Wing, and the new president, a new
era of refreshment is sweeping the
campus.

No lunger will wholesome looking
coeds, avowed members ot the
Pepsi generation, be seen casually
sipping the youthtut dnnk irorn
wholesome looking bottles. instead
they will be swigging, swilling,
and guzzling trorn cans—the very
same type at cans that bear the
label of Milwaukee’s most famous
product.

The new can _ dispensing ma-
chines are bright, shiny, and ac-
cording to the Pepsi (20., almost
100 per cent trouble tree. There
is one catch, however. The going
rate for a l2—ounce Can is 15 cents,
which constitutes a 50 per cent
increase in price with only a 20
per cent increase in product.

vice President Memt Ludwig
cited a number of reasons for the
change, “in addition to acclden»
tal breakage, there is considerable
deliberate breakage. Moreover,
the housekeeping statl has to
spend too much time collecting
empties and carrying them to bot-
tle rack3#wliicli, incidentally, are
very unsightly."

However, students can console
themselves with the knowledge
that the choice was between the
15-Cent can vendors and loeent

 

cup vendors, And, as Ludwig
pointed out, “It bottles aren’t han<
dy as missiles, son's bills tor
building damages may go down!"

Leggett: Presidential Opportunity
Inspiring Privilege and Challenge

The opportunity to serve Grin-

privilege and a challenge, and i

In many ways the task i see
ahead is an inspiring one. Behind
Grinnell College is a remarkable
record of achievement in academic
excellence. Ils rocuity ot scholar

" Ieiichér-Sliidenl Relationship Exacls
Bolli Open Minds and Open Stomach:

To the Editor:
By Vii-lure of age and most iln'
poi-taut, education, the student and
cteacher stand on ditterent planes.
They have often been described as
being polenuciilly opposed: better
that they should be in juxtaposi-
tion. l am not advocating the im-
possible, a state of intellectual
rapport, but most certainly there
can and should be a point of great

or understanding. This understand-
ing is not to be reached by a blind
and uiireasoning tolerance benefir

oently bestowed by one group upou.

tiie other. but it may well be ar-
.rived at through the process ot
education itself.

Great is the professor who
through the work ot a Voltaire iiir
troduccs his students to the write

.ings ol a Marx as well. Greater
still is he who not only introduces.
but teaches opposing human con-
cepts, It is the great and constant
danger to the classroom that the

.soot ot stagnation and apathy will
descend upon the pedagogue and
the student alike—a stagnation
bred by narrowness of mind and
fruitless intellectual calesilienics.

g There is a beauty to be discov-
ered in the study of the Hegelian
dialectic; a wonder to be bestowed
up on the student or an Einstein or
Fermi: a thrill to be experienced
by the reader or a De Toqueville
or Whitehead. Untortunately. the
beauty, the wonder, and the thrill
are otten equated with a erfectlon
which is attributed to t e indivir

Oduai studied, Where the question-
ing process should begin, it is end-
ed Tile long pilgrimage which a
true education demands is trans-
formed into an abortive excursion

' or shoit mileage and few sidetrips.

The fault, dear reader. rests not
upon the shoulders of the protes-
sors alone any more than it tails

4 upon the student. The responsibili-
ty should be shared equally by
both, The teacher must offer the
challenge and guidance—the stu~
dent must have the fortitude and
desire to accept the challenge.

The citadels oi learning can
oftei- one a blanket of false se-
curity tor a tow years if one is a

1 student and for a lifetime if you
are a professor. It is a secu ' ot
bcautiful ideas beautifully written.
One day a man can be wooed by
the conservatism of Burke, the

. next day the ultraleftist Marx may
beckon him. This is good, but it is
the tirst step only.

Both pretessor and pupil must
descend the staircase of ideas and
mingle with humanity. The basic
question must be asked: Does what
we are studying have a place in
the society in which we are living?

, Pal'i ot the answer lies in the class-
room. part in the man on the street.
Some may pursue it in the alflur

for those who question. and this
is the [rile objective of education.

When student and scholar realize
this, they will have accepted for
themselves a sentiment echoed by
Alexander Pope two centuries ago,
“The proper study of mankind is
man" ll man does not live by
bread alone, neither should the
educated live by the theories which
are contained in hooks alone. it
this is taught then our campuses
will most certainly foster a deeper
understanding between the faculty
and student body and the educa-
tional process will take on a much
deeper and more rewarding signifi
cance.

science building, the nine prUles»
surs continued their research in
the (mast “show must go on" tra~
dition despite the inconvenience or
dust, noise, and electrical and wa-
ter interruptions.

The research was carried on in
the fields of biology. chemistry,
and physics under more than
$160,000 in grants. Most ot the
grants were for two or three years
and involved work during the reg-
ular school year in addition to
summer laborr

While National Science Founda-
tion grants financed a majority or
the research projects, money troni
the US. Public Health Service and
the Petrnleum Research Fund also
aided the work.

Four chemists were involved in
three ot the projects.

 

Luther Erickson and William
Nevill studied “Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance ot Metnl Complexes oi
Possible Anti~Cancer Compounds"
under 2| $60,000 U.S. Public Health

dicyanocarbelie and nitrogen ylide
chemistry by Jack swenson, while
Joseph Danmrth sought a ”Soluble
SilicaeAlumina Catalyst” under a
$10,000 National Science Foundation
allocation.

Also aiding the work conducted
by the chemists was a $9,500 NSF
undergraduate research participa-
tion allowance

in the biology department, Guil-
lermo Mendoza, Kenneth Chris-
tiansen, Benjamin Graham, Jr.,
and LaVerne Durkee all worked unv

i It's important for everybody to

cause Esquire has just done what
we've all been trying to do for
years. They’ve iinaliy placed the

Freshmen will especially value
this issue, as a guide to life more
than anything else, while uppel'r
classmen will simply decide
whether or not to have an identity
crisis over their ability to agree
with the editors’ conclusions.

In an effort to provide alternar
tives for anybody having particular,
trouble with Esquire's 28 College

the heart or the stodgy old Mldr

Gridmen Face Rebuilding As Season Opener Approaches

With only 11 lettermen ro-
turning, a big rebuilding job laces
Coach Edd Bowers in his sixth
Season as Grinnell College football
coach.

The lid—man Pioneer squad began
practice Sept. 1. On Sept. 25, the
Scarlet and Black will open a
rugged sgame Midwest Confer-
ouce schedule by hosting Cornell,
t 1564 tri-champion. And the sec—
ond outing, to week later, is at
Ripon, another tri-charnp.

Graduation dealt the Pioneers a
staggering blow. Gone from last
year‘s team, which had a 53 mark
and tied for fourth in the loop
are 15 lettermen. all but one of
them regulars on either offense or
deiense.

Especially hard hit was the in-
terior line. Eight tackles, guards,
and centers departed, and only
three veterans are back Also
missing are four backs and a trio
oi ends.

Rely on Staph:

“Our sophomores are going to
have to come through, especially
in the interior line,” Bowers points
out. “We should be strong in the
backfield and at end, but so much
is going to depend on how fast our
Bophornore linemen develop. And
we really start the season with
a bang, meeting Cornell and Ri-
pon. But it we can get by them
in good shape, we could pull some
Surprises.”

Happily, the sophomore contin-
gent is rated as Grinnell's best in
five years.

'Announcers Needed

Two student announcers are
needed for the fall sports season.
Anyone interested should contact
Roger McMullin in the public re-
lations ofﬁce,

 

The only vets in the interior
line are co—capwin Paul Thurston,
a senior who earned all-conference
recognition as a linebacker last
year though weighing only 165
pounds; Tom Lannom, a 195 pound
senior who will be at center on
offense and at linebacker on de-
tense; and Rick Anderson, a 195
pound junlor who will go at offen-
sive tackle or guard. Thurston will
probably shift to the defensive
backfield this (all.

Top sophomore prospect up
front is Tom Russell, a 195 pound
Er who will double as an often-
sive guard and linebacker. He has
the credentials to become one of
Grinneil’s allvtlme great linemen.

Still Other Sophs

Other sophs tabbed for heavy
duty in the line are Ken Augus-
tine, offensive and defensive tack-
le; Louis Kelley, oftensive center
and defensive tackle; Dick Lamb,
defensive guard: and Phil Wood-
ward, offensive guard. All spark-
led on last fall's freshman teamr

Augustine, at 210 pounds, is the
biggest man on the squad. Lamb,
who win also battle for an offen-
sivo job at fullback, is 195; Wood-
ward 135; and Kelley 175

Two others likely to see a lot
of action in the defensive line are
junior Bob Geller, 205, and senior
Nlcl-r Nonos.

Three Ends

Letterman Al Peterson, junior
college grad John Lawson, and has-
ketball ace Jeff Frantz, Will share
Offensive duties at and. Peterson
was a regular a year ago, grabbing
ll passes for 143 yards Lawson
earned junior College ail-American
recognition at Ellsworth in 1964.
All are in the 180-190 pound class.

Junior veterans Tum Hill and
Nord Brue look like the defensive
ends. Hill is 195, Brue 185.

Left Half Position

Senior Dave Synhorst and junior
Bob Watt both veterans, will has
tie for the left half job,

A 130 pounder who put most of
his time in on defense the last two
years. Synhorst is last with a fine

Inexperienced Harrier Squad
Faces Si'clie Meei Saiurdcly

Graduation and rain—both are
hindering Grinnell’s cross country
prospects.

Three of Grinnell's veteran, ﬁfth
place team graduated leaving
what coach Dick Young calls “one
of the youngest squads I’ve had in
my eight years at Grinnell.”

What Young went on to call a
“growing year” is being ham-
pered by rain and cool weather.
“We haven't had a single good
conditioning day yet," said Young.
“But, considering the weather, I
guess we are coming along as
well as can be expected."

Tomorrow opens the season for
the Pioneer runners. They'll be at
a State Federation run in Ames.
Young plans to take eight Pioneers
to the meet. Those eight are letter-
men Jeri Langharn and Steve Brint~
nall as well as newcomers Dick
Lovell, John Sharpe, Doug Dray,
Ric MacDowell, Spencer Clark, and

to challenge Carleton, the odds-on
favorite, for the conference crown.
Carleton will be seeking its fourth
