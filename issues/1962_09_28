is that it will allow students
more time to do independent re-

them.

Paul Coilrtright: I agree with

him in general about the em-

To the Editor

Last Saturday we watched one
of the water rights which have
plagucd North campus each
weekend this tall We were ini
tially disturbed .by the noise and
vulgarity oi these, but were
even more surprised at their
character

A FEW YEARS back a water
ﬁght arose spontaneously and
usually occurred only two or
three times in the spring at the
year. Many people were annoys
ed then, as now, but is was [3057
sible to rationalize this behavior
as the “college boys’” release
t'i-oni pressures of a long winter
at Grinncll.

Then a large number oi the
men on North campus either
participated or at least crawled
out oi the sack to watch. Now
these displays involve from one
to two dozen men while the
rest oi North campus turns an-
grily in bed and mutters: “1:30
and they're still at it ”

There are several perspectives
irem which these weekly events
may be viewed. One is the irri—
tation to those in slumber both
in and out of the college com.

Study made of typical county

By Sue VVnIltins
5&3 Feature Editor

Nine Giinnell students and
the faculty members partici-
pated this summer-in the second
year of a long—term research
study of Jasper County, iowa.

Thc protect, directed by Paul
A. Smith tpolitical science), ins
volves an economic, historical,
psychological and political sur-
vey or a “typical" county. 1357
per is considered such a county
because of its balance oi urban
and rural communities and its
involvement in both industry
and agriculture.

The basic idea of the sur—
vey, according to Protessor
Smith, is the developmental
study of the changes or a.
community and the iactors
which bring about those
changes.

For this reason the project
must extend over a period of
several years. The purpose is
twofold: t1) To protcssionally
study the way in which a Com»
munity decides its public pol—
icies; and (2) to turnish an
opportunity tor students and face
ully to work together on re
search.

lenox String Quartet prefers -
silent audiences more closets

By Karen Adkinson
5&3 Staff Writer

“Gl‘ilmell's Fine Arts Center
has some of the best facilities
we‘ve seen," remarked Theodore
Mantz, second violinist of the
Lenox String Quartet.

“But we'd like to make one
small additionaclosets," added
Peter Marsh, first violinist. ”All
Marsh, first violinist. “All of the
famous violinists, such as
Jascha Heitetz, became success.
ful because their mothers sllcv-
ed them in the closet to prac—
tice. Here at Grllmell it a stus
dent gave the excuse that he
didn't. have time to practice
we’d just lock him in one of the
closets," he explained.

The Lenox Quartet will
spend time at Grinncll pre—
senting a program of instruc-
tion, informal lectures and a
series of concerts including all
of Beethoven's quartets,

”Griniiell‘s program is doubly
unusual," said Donald McCall,
cellist, “because it isn't otten
that a smaller college is able to
hear the entire series of
:Beethoven quartets, especially
over a long period at time. In

Court presents

most cases they are played with-
in e period at six or seven days."

THE QUARTET chose the
Beethoven pieces because of
their consistently fine quality
and also because they will be
playing them at the Town Hall
in New York City, ln trying for
as much variation within indi-
vidual concerts as an all Beetho-
ven program would allow, they
selected works from the early,
middle and late pertods‘ oi
Beethoven's musical develop
ment, considering also the key,
and texture of the music.

The 0 iginal quartet, drawn
together by their love of cham-
ber music, began playing HF
gether informally when they
were members of the Pittsburgh
Symphony 5 years ago. Tangle-
wood, a music center in Massas
chusetts ,engaged them to be
permanent quartet as consult-
ants on technical matters, Two
years ago when the original
violist was replaced by Paul
Hersh, the group took the name
Lcnox Quartet after Lenox,
Mass. where the present group
first performed together. This
summer the ensemble spent on
a tour of Europe with five

weeks at the icstival of fine
arts in Spoleto, ltaly,

Asked how a quartet

mans ‘

ages to start and linish on tlic,

same boat and to stay together
during the piece, Donald Me-
Call responded, “It takes tech—
nical skill first of all—a mas-
tery of the instrument, and also
many years oi playing with th
same musicians so that individ
ual interpretations can be mcrgv
ed into a whole. But skillec
players cannot make a good
quartet even it they practice
together for so years ii there is
not a rapport between the mem
bers. As [or the best audiences,
the quality we most prefer it
silence” _

Perhaps the reason the
quartet came to Grinncll was
due to their introduction to
the campus. In the dead of
one of the worst winters in
Iowa's history the quartet
made its debut. The faculty
rose to the occasion with fresh
lobsters flown in ii-om Maine
and roasted outside over a
backyard borbequc.

“We have been impressed so
far with the calibre of both
faculty and students and cei»
tainly with the absence or a
stereotyped student body. it is
a great pleasure to be here,” the
quartet concluded.

Bill Winter, St. Olaf’s all-Conference football player.
last year on both offense and defense, has written another
chapter in the long- history of smalchollege players making
good in professional football. . i

WINTER CAME to the New York Giants this year on?
a tryrout contract: as their 18th draft choice. Quickly he.
established himself as a formidable defensive player and has;
started ever since in a corner linebacker slot. 1

But even though he was a starter in the fall practice‘
games, Winter had to really struggle in the pre-season prac-i
tice to make himself noticed. i

It was during these early fall work outs that I spoke .
with Winter. At this point Winter was anything but con- i
fident about making the squad, much less the starting 1
team. He had this to say, “Either you have what they i
want, or you don’t—you can’t tell. There was a guy who ‘
was on last year’s taxi; he looked real good to me, but he
was out the first wee .” i

Probably the most surprising comment Winter had to‘
make was that he felt that New York’s training program
was easier than he had experienced at St. Olaf. This was
because the Oles couldn’t accomplish in several hours \Vllilt‘
