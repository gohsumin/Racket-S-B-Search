JAMES HITS
CITY HOUSING

By SUE T. MILLER

Q: “What do you think of
public houslng In Chicago?”

A: “I would drop a bomb
on 35th through 47th Streets
and start over again."

In talking of the wrongs of
the Chicago housing project,
Director of the Waterloo Human
Rights Commission, Ronald
James addressed a group Wed-
nesday In South Lounge.

“I wouldn’t h D u s e cattle
there," he said. “I went to the
Stockyards at 63rd Street and
they are more roomy, better
built than me projects are. . .
Anyway you look at it, as a
sociological, or an architectural
proposition, those projects are
wrong,"

James was asked it he
wanted to get away from such
low rent charity housing. With
the money Chicago Mayor
Daley “has poured in," James
answered, “no doubt he could
have done better . . . those
with less money and connec-
tions have done better."

The Mayor, James cited, “is
putting Negroes in cracker-
hoxes until they explode."

James also spoke of Adam
Clayton Powell—as “an articu-
Iator of the Negro anger." And
oi Martin Luther King—as "one
remembered as “poor, naive,
ignorant, (who) walked the
streets, talking to young men
with swltchblades. saying ‘what
have you accomplished by
this.’ "

The Waterloo administrator
mentioned one case of a young-
ster with six arrests behind
him, who has “no exposure to
whites."

“No exposure," he pointed
about the South Lounge, “to
this kind of paraphernalia
here,“

“Here Grinnell goes all the
way down to Memphis to help,"
he said, “and it does nothing
in Waterloo,"

James spoke of the best in-
ﬂuence at the college in the
town of Grinnell, tor its prob-
lems in the treatment of Negro
students'there, is the pockeb
book.

“As much economic power as
the college has on the com-
munity, I'm sure there's some
pressure that can be brought
to play."

Other possible methods for
college people to improve the
situation between Negroes and
townies came from audience
comments, Taking pictures,
preaching sermons in the town
churches. and articles in the
papers of specific incidents, to

Debate raged at the Wednes-
day senate meeting over the
proposed Committee at Thirteen
(C of T) and ombudsman.
‘Thum Thomas, Gates, and
Nail Fischer, Langan, members
of the committee that drafted
the new constitution, found
themselves answering to SEV-
eral determined senators who
oppose it.

The C of T would replace the
Senate as the SGA's legislative
body. It would include the C or
HP president, the AWS presi-
dent, the SGA president, and
ten members elected at large.
Ari ombudsman, appointed by
the C of T, would be charged
with the responsibility of di-
iecnng students' ideas through
appropriate channels, and also
adVislng students as to where
they might turn for assistance
on any given matter.

One question raised was
whether there are enough well-
known people on campus to run
for c oi T in an atrlarge elec-
tion, Fischer replied that stu-
dents who are not members oi
the C of T will be statting
various committees, and can
make themselves known in this
capacity. Thus, the structure
provides a merit system at
sorts, he said.

SGA President Ric Mac-
Dowell made it clear that
he s u p p o r t s representation
by halls. To this end, he rec-
ommended an amendment to
the constitution that would give
the Senate the power to initiate
rule changes. Presently, the C
of HP and AWS Board propose
the changes and the Senate
passes them.

Several senators expressed

similar doubts, among them
Ray Horn, Rawson, who felt
that students' ideas follow the
path of least resistance and
thus are likely to come more
easily through senators whom
the students have a chance to
know better.

Thomas countered that one at
the purposes or the new con-
su'tutioii is to get away [ruin
the idea of halls as legislative
districts. Fischer added that
senators generally seek their
jobs not for the purpose of being
a liason between SGA and hail,
but to work on legislation. The
ombudsman's expressed raisori
d’etre is to keep interested
students aware of what is go-
ing on.

MacDowell’s amendment was
tabled until next week.

Doug Tolleisen, Dibble, chair~
man of the admissmns com»
mittee, announced that the com-
mittee is hoping to publish a
booklet for prospectives that
would present student views at
Grinnell. He emphasized that
the booklet would provide both
positive and ne gative view-
points. The booklet would not
be designed to replace other
admissions publications.

Students interested in Con-
tributing should send their work
to the admissions committee be-
fore Christmas. Tolletsen hopes
to have the booklet published
by February.

Ron Cogswell, c of HP presi-
dent, announced that both res-
ident advisors and student ad-
visors might be present in the
halls next year. The stu'leilt
advisors would receive more
extensive training than the cur-
rent hattleboards, and perhaps
would receive some pay.

TUITION RAISE
HIGHEST EVER

By NEIL FISCHER

President Glenn Ieggett an-
nuunced Tuesday that tuition
charges will increase an un-
precedented $200 next year,
jumping from $l925 to $2125
and making the total cost at a
year at Grinnell $3100.

In a letter to parents, Leg<
gett said that the “major rea-
sons” tor the increase are the
competition (or and rising sal-
aries or “highly qualiﬁed schol-
ar-teachers;" higher student
labor and start wages; and the
inflation of academic, service.
and physical plant costs.

“We expect therefore an in<
crease of about $350,000 in
operating costs tor leases (on
top of an increase of about
$450,000 for 1967-68, compared
with 1956-67).” Leggett ex-
plained. “Two-thirds of the
$350,000 Will be met by the in«
crease in the comprehensive
charge."

There are about 1160 stu<
dents at Grinnell. An increase
of $200 per student comes to
$232,000 — exactly two-thirds of
Leggett’s estimate for increased
costs next year.

Leggett said that the EMI—
tlonal third would hopefully he
met by “increased glits ironi
industry, alumni, and friends
or the College.”

Room, board, and fees (ao‘
tivities, college events, and
health fees) are expected to re-
main the same, Leggett noted
in the letter.

The $200 tuition increase is the
largest in the history or Grin-
nell. Tuition for 196768 was
$1925 e only $155 greater than
the 31770 figure {or 1906-67.

The lsoezn figure was only
SISO above the $1640 tuition
charge for 1965-66.

The total cost — including
room, hoard, tuition ,and fees
— of attending Grinnell College
in 1941, the year Chairman or
the Faculty Joseph Wall grad-
uated, was $720 — only one-
third of the tuition costs alono
rpr next year.

Tliition iorty years ago wal
$160. A decade ago it was $700.

Room and board costs at
Grinnell have remained sulr
stantially the same since 1961-
62 — that is, around $910. K
decade ago the ﬁgure for room.
board, and tees was $850,

Leggett said that the True.
tees have authorized an expara
sion of ﬁnancial aid to take
care of “hardship cases" re<
suiting irom the tuition in
crease,

“Though the increased tuln
tion charge is in line with typi.

TUITION INCREASE

Tuition has increased again — this time by 5200 —— and it is
assumed students will exhibit the usual aversive action.

And, if things renew the usual pattern, you will probably find
discussions or “guaranteed tuition” plans going on in the halls, the
Forum grill, the lunch and dinner lines.

“Guaranteed tuition” means that students are guaranteed as
freshmen that their room, board, tuition and fee charges will be
the same for all of their four years at school. Several colleges and
universities have such plans, and quite a few more have proposed
them.

The trouble with “guaranteed tuition” is that administrators,
who of course have to meet operational costs. tend to figure up
what costs will be over all {our years (these costs usually increase
substantially each year) and divide by iour. The iigure for the
ireshman year tends to be higher under “guaranteed tuition" than
it would be under the status quo of a place like Grinnell.

As Dean James Stauss told the 5&3: “Such “guaranteed tui-
tion" plans iavor only students who graduate — those who spend
four iull years here — while other students (those who may trans-
ier) have to pay more than they would have for each of their years
here"

But if guaranteed tuition is not desirable for a place like Grin»
hell, it seems the administration in its catalogue and other publb
cations to prospective or entering students might emphasize that
costs do increase each year and that tuition has been increasing
accordingly,

The catalogue tells us that the administration reserves the
right to raise tuition and fees and room and board charges. But
what it doesn't tell is that it is almost certain that Grinnell tuition
will increase every year ilottzoil. it it did, when tuition did in-
crease, at least it wouldn't be totally unexpected and it. wouldn’t
be the tragedy it always seems.

All MAL BEHAIIIOUII

By Neil Fischer

Three things are for sure and certain at Grinnell - Mr. CNS-
sett drives a While Valiant; President Leggett smokes True timer
and the Coil-1P president stays at Senate meetings precisely one
hour, whereupon he turns into a pumpkin

Actually the last item is Ihe most certain — as vermin u
the present student government is nominally Omnipotent and
notably impotent.

In iact, I suggest you all go to a Senate meeting (just one”?
they're very interesting, very enlightening, very Grinnellt

Take this Wednesday's meeting for example, and take an ex-
emplary iew Senate considerations:

1, Last week Debbie Friedman’s proposal that proceeds from
n Saga fast (scheduled for a week from today) go to the American
Friends Service Committee to help both North and South Vietnam
passed by a margin of a few votes.

Before passing that proposal the Senate talked at great lengths
as to whether concerned students could specify that their contribu—
tions go to North Vietnam, South Vietnam, or both.

This Wednesday the Senate couldn‘t remember what it de-
cidedr Was it in the minutes? Well . . . errr . ahhh . . a not
really. Could anyone figure out what was decided, Well . . . uhhh
. . .. no. But Senate Speaker Phil Berienlhal did a pretty good im-
promptu job of putting off remembering ior another week.

Quoth Phil: “Well, that can be decided when the ﬂyers go out
to the mailboxes and halls belor‘e the fast."

That’s iunny, I thought we decided the whole thing last week.

2. Last week the interim Committee -— headed by SGA presie
dent Ric Machwell -— decided the topics for interimr

i asked Ric why, alter the topics were decided, there were
about 150 unconsidered questionnaires (supposedly used for gaug-
ing student interest in speciiic topics) still in the Interim Box in
Carnegie Post oiiice. That was only two days alter the topics had
been decided.

' s “They didn't get them to us on time, and we had

Question: "How many of the questionnaires did you use in
selecting interim topics?”

Answer — from a committee member: "About 200 of them.”

Really now, people, couldn’t you have waited two days icr 150
more (43% more) answered questionnaires from interested stu-
dents? (Especially when they seemed to iavnr topics you didn’t
choose?) You do like representative samplings from the student
body, don’t you Ric?

3. Don Stump »— former head of a non-Senate committee to
provide a campus bike fleet —— reported that the bikes had been
purchased.

But a perceptive senator incisively noted a highly-important,
fundamental-type problem (paraphrased below):

“In Madison, Wisconsin r . . the police found similar bike:
were not owned by individuals and confiscated them all!”

Goshrarrooney, kiddies, do you think it'll happen at Grinnell?

4. The Senate then departed from its usual format and began
to discuss less signiiicant issues — like changing SGA into an efﬁ—
cient, productive, provocative, and useful body.

Oh, one addendumr Something was kind or important at the
Senate meeting (really, no kidding) at least to my mind.

Doug Tollefsen, who is heading up the student Senate Commit-
tee m1 Admissions, enthusiastically reported that a collection of
student and iaculty comment on Grinnell College will be put to
gether to give pruspectives more than a catalog description of the
college, ‘

Tolleisen said that the publication would present several per-
spectives oi salient aspects or the campus.

“Grinneli is in a slate of flux," he said, "and although there
are drawbacks to coming here we want to attract students who
will contribute constructively to Grinnell's future”

After I told him i might submit a scathing column or two dlSv
secting Grinnell irom my perspective, Tollefsen indicated that
even that sort of contribution is welcome for consideration.

The student Committee on Admissions will edit contribution!
and submit a ilnal draft to the college tor publication.

“We don't think that a true picture of Grinnell will dlSCOHl'ag.
too many applicants,” Tollefsen concluded.

So, after all, the Senate did do something this week. Thing:
seem to be happening in committees — not always good things,
but sometimes . . . like a real picture of this all-torrreal place.

Everything, i guess, happens for the best in that best or all
possible student governments.

Right, Ric?

N0 BETTER HAS TROUBIES

By JOHN WILES

The premiere of Robert Ing-
ham’s No Better was, at best,
a tedious evening of unfulfilled
potentialities. At worst, suffi-
cient potentialities just were not
there within the play itself.

No Better ooncems a Jim
Crow regiment during the Ko
rean War, although the work
lacks a basic focus of dramatic
conflict and development,

There is a morphine-addicted
medic who is out of morphine
and on the verge of going cold
turkey. There is a corporal
from Cleveland who doesn’t
know quite what to make of
the company oi Negro attitudes
in which he ﬁnds himself.

There is the White lieutenant,
who recognizes that to be lead-
er of the regiment he must
"get to” its soul leader. There
is a rebellious Negro private,
a coiled spring of bitterness
who wants to help the medic,
challenge his white command-
er, and also get the hell out of
the war and the defense of I
country he clearly hatesr

Yet nothing really happens,
True, there is some “meaning-
lul dialogue" exchanged There
are two deaths There is some
attempt to impose symbolism

in terms of the Korean cause it-
self.

it doesn’t hang togetherr

Bill Saylor has never offered
such an interesting perform-
once; one wishes that the part
of Lt, Porter ottered as much
to interest the audience.

Grady Murdock had trouble
with cmoting, but was outstand-
ing in the medic's moments of
humor.

Henry Wingate displayed real
acting talent, although he had
precious few moments in which
to display it.

Lou Kelley ranged from we-
some to awkward as Private
Brown. It seemed to be Lhe
kind of part which Kelley
should have been able to grab
hold of with effective impact.

The fault lay with the play;
Kelley was shot down long be-
fore‘his character’s death, With
little responsibility being as-
signable to him.

in fairness, there were very
bright moments — two of them.
One was a recollection by
Brown of a Negro preacher’s
firerandrbrimstone sermon. The
other involved the antics of the

GRAY MATTER

The hope of every sports-
writer is to be able to cover
the battle between the No. 1
and the No 2 teams in a certain
sport. The ideal situation is to
have a tense battle with one
strength eventually overcoming
another and asserting itself,
{This week brought about this
exact situation with South play
ing North for the volleyball
championship,

The result? A miserable 33
the which proved absolutely
nothing except that they‘re too
good for each other and much
too good for anyone else. South
now has lost 6 while North has
dropped 9.

North had the misfortune to
play Rawson in the first game
of the season when they were

While we're on the subject,

this Sunday from 7-9 pm, in
Darby Gym, This game has
much more to recommend it
than regular volleyball since
girls can’t spike as well as
boys but they’re much more
fun to Watch jumps It'll be the
last chance before finals to let
off steam.

THE KIIITZER

By JOHN RAZ

When one member of your partnership deals or when an oppo«
nent deals and passes it is possible for your partnership to employ
the Forcing Pass System of Sarcastically Obscure and Misleading
Psychological Bids. Although this system may sound as though it
should belong to the Oneupmanship variety of conventions as sug-
gested by Stephen Potter in Gamesmanship, it has a fair amount
of credibility and it is difficult to construct a logical defense with-
out deliberation and altering the structure of the Standard Amerh
can system.

When you hold
. 0-16 pts

 

You bid

One of it suit (with weaker types of
hands try to open the major, strongEr
for the minor suit openings)

Pass, which is forcing and the equiva
lent of a Shencken Club opening bid.
Partner gives negative response by
bidding 1‘: (less than 9 p18 needed for
game) or positive response: any other
bid, game forcing.

‘ Upon this basic structure can be added the Weak NoTrump
convention (14—16 pts), The Weak Two-Bid (8-12 pts and six card
suit), Preempts, etc.

The success of this system in actual practice depends upon
the quality of the defense since it is an exaggerated system of of-
fensive bidst If the defense hesitates to double at the low levels,
which is more often than not the case on this campus, the system
has a definite advantage in initiative and preventing the opponents
from arriving at their proper contract, Practice should demon-
strate certain sequences and conventions to be superior to others
and it is a matter of experimentauon to determine the best way
of handling the system.

Attention should be paid to the maintaining of limits for defen-
sive values since they will be convenient when you double the frus-
trated oppositions ovcrbidding.

The greatest difficulty of the system is reaching game on hands
which do not afford the use of the forcing pass, This could be alle-
viated by reducing the requirement for the forcing pass to a mere
opening hand but there can probably exist a system of step-relay
bids for this purpose,

Generally, this system is constructed to take advantage of an
opposition which does not base its offensive bidding on a sound
defensive bidding system; l.e., it works best against a weak or
timid defense. Although it works best against an unwary defense,
astounding results can be produced by first informing the oppo-
nents of the use of the system beforehand. And like the excellent
continental system, (e.g., the Roman and Neopnlitan Club), it can't
be used in A. C. B. L. master point tournaments.

HOOPSTERSi
HEIGHT? HOPE!

Tho Grinnoll Pioneers will be
fighting to overcome last year‘s
disasters as they take on Cul-
ver - Stockton on December 2.
The team has only won 12 of
66 games in the past three years
and has been last in the Mid-
west Conferenco since the
graduation of John Sundell in
1964.

Luck of depth seems to be a
predominant factor of Pioneer
teams and this year’s roundbait
squad is no exception Only 11
men came out for the squad,
which is barely enough for an
inter-team scrimmage, It seems
probable that a lot of the op-
position’s points will come in
the last period as the team tires.

Fortunately, the problem of
height is not as great as it was
a year ago. While still giving
away an overall height advant-
age, Coach Pfitsch has Terry
Holloway, a so" sophomore
Last year, Holloway averaged
23.2 points per game with the
trash and once pulled down 40
rebounds in one game.

Other members of last year's
fresh, now with the varsity, are
Don Peterson and Gordon Abel,
Peterson is a guard and Abel
plays both guard and forward.

Members at last year’s varsi-
ty still with the team are Mil-(e
Schwartz, Thor Evenson, and
Roger Able. Schwartz is 8 guard
and Evenson and Able are for-
words.

The team is rounded out by
forwards Greg Rankin, Ralph
Christensen, Carl Muller, and
Sam Carrell,

points; if you read my point
(1) again, you will find it para-
phrases your point (2) and (3).
Only our basic premises differ.

The main thing I want to say
is that i am concerned about
the subculture and have heard
this concern expressed by oth-
ars, and I wrote my letter to
try to express some aspects
of the situation to others who
felt the some way. You are
not concerned with the situau'onll
you applaud it as healthy. Nuv
turally, you, the people in tho
subculture, Would not feel the
same way. My article was writ
ten to suggest why you don't.
The fact that you are so on the
defensive as to feel you must
reply and justify yourselves is
indicative of less moral sure-
ness than your letter indicatesl

i wrote my letter primarily
to the white students who, like
me, believe in integration. We
are upset because it seems like
we can‘t even make integration
work at Grinnell, here where
we are so apart from the real
world.

Let me and by saying that
integration does not mean as—
Slmilatinn. And when you have
resolved the paradox of your
[WEI statements: “The ‘self isola-
tion’ that you speak of is im-
perative to the Negroes’ search
for an ethnic ‘soul’ " and
”Ethnic pride does not mean
social separation" perhaps we
will agree.

Meanwhile, my letter's chal-
lenge to the white students still
stands: we have failed to pm
vide positive and concrete re-
atﬁrmatioiis of our desire for a
genuinely non-prejudiced and
nonaracially oriented society.
We can decide apathy is easier
and let our ideals go down the
drain, or we can each decide
to do something and perhaps
succeed at Grinnell where most
of our country failss

CANADA SETS
POINT SYSTEM

WASHINGTON, (CPS) — The
factors used by Canadian offl~
clots in judging young Ameri-
cans migrating to Canada have
now been revised and codified
in a point system.

This system replaces old reg-
ulations under which some
would-be migrants could be
turned down by an immigration
officer because of a single de-
ficiency. Any immigrant scor<
ing 50 out of a possible
100 “assessment units" will
now be admitted to Canada

The scoring under the new
system is as followsl

—Education and training, 20
units. One unit for each year
of schooling or training,

—Personal assessment, 15
units. Adaptability, motivation,
initiative and other such quali-
ties as judged by an immigra-
tion officer during an interview,

—0ccupational d e m a n d, 15
units, Based on demand for Vu-
rlous skills in Canada, unim
are assessed according to the
demand for the occupation the
applicant will follow in Can-
ada.

—Age, 10 units. 10 units if the
applicant is between 18 and 35
—l.e., of draft ago — but one
units deducted for each year
over 35,

—Arranged employment, 10
units: 10 units if the applicant
has arranged employment in
Canada or has received offers
on a previous Visit.

—Knowledgs of French and
English, 10 units: Five points
for each language spoken flu-
ently. with extra points for
some knowledge of eitherl

—Relative, 5 units: granth
when the applicant has a rela-
tive in Canada willing to spon<
sor him,

—Employment opportunities
in the area of destination, it
units: a maximum of five units
if the applicant intends to go
to an area in Canada where'
them is a strong demand for
labor.

Under the new regulation:
there is also a new applica-
tion form. The main change
from the Old one is the dele-
tion of the question “Wily do
you wish to migrate?"

Shakespeare or Albee, every-
thing eise being perfect. could
