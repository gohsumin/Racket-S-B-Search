Calendar "Commitmen’rs"

Those who must plan the college social program each
year invariably face the demands of different campus fac-
tions, each supporting its own plan for guiding the students’
socio-cultural existence and each with a calendar of events
that it deems appropriate and necessary. The student com-
mittee and its coordinators, chosen especially to plan the

‘ weekend schedule of events on campus, spend hours and
hours juggling dates and features, hoping to come out with
a satisfactory program that will be beneficial to all students
and one which will be acceptable to each faction involved,
Presently, the Social Coordinating Committee finds itself in
In operational dilemma —- the result of an apparent existing
“policy" of blocking weekend programs.

Specifically, we would cite this weekend as a classic ex-
ample. The music department, in opening the Lenox Quartet
fall concert series, deemed the event important enough to
be “all campus” and for all practical purposes blocked the
calendar by forbidding the social personnel to schedule
any event opposite the Saturday night concert. Yet, this “all-
campus” event, which is scheduled for a single performance
Ind which has been announced as open to the public, will he
presented in Roberts Theatre, which has an audience capacity
of 467 people. With all due respect to the music department
and the recognized value of its programs, we must point out
that for its personnel to assume to block the entire Saturday
evening for a program that not even half the student body can
feasibly attend is ridiculous.

The operational dilemma mentioned earlier comes from
the question of just what the policy for calendar commitment
should be and just what constitutes an all-campus event, In
the years before President Bowen, blocking was considered
the thing to do to the weekend calendar. An event scheduled
for Saturday night took exclusive rights to that night and the
student choice of what to attend was limited to one.

Dr. Bowen, however, was opposed to “all-campus" block-
ing of events, except for those accessible by the entire campus
and favored by student wants, e.g. Odetta concert, Brothers
Four Concert. During the Bowen years the campus calendar
was more fluid than now — students found themselves with
several weekend events to choose from. The social program
was rich and varied. We would hate to see, during this interim
period in administration, a return to the old policy of block-
ing and the calendar limitations it would pose.

It is time for a definite policy of competitive allowance
on campus. The narrow-minded individual who can see only
his department and his performer should not be allowed to
intimidate the student social planners nor subject each stu-
dent to attend his event simply “because there wasn’t any-
thing else to do,"

We would suggest that the student social committee,
along with its adult supervisors, be given ultimate control of
the weekend calendar situation, and that they not only pre-
sent to the student body some baSlc policy objectives, but that
they work on finding out, via polls and personal contact, just
what the students want in their social program and just what
can be termed an “all-campus" event according to student
preference. As long as it is student money being spent, let
the investors have some say about the merchandise..And let’s
not limit the customers to just one brand name.

Letters to the Editor
‘Sad Freshman Don't Be Mad: We're lust Youlhful'

Dear Editor:

I am indebted to Master A.
Sad Freshman for his profound
analysis of upperolassmen’s
attitudes. I was unaware of the
immaturity on campus. I was
so moved by his plea that I
offer this letter as a “service to
my fellowmen."

This sad freshman dubs our
campus as being immature; I
characterize it as being youthr
ful. Those things he criticizes
are not really irresponsible
acts but merely innocent exub-

erances. For example, he con-
demns the prepping program as
lacking service and social re-
sponsibility. Through the pro-
gram the freshman is first in—
troduced to his upperclass hall—
mates. This is their finest hour.
Out of this and other aspects of
the hall system grows a life-
long camaraderie. Are we to
upset this noble tradition which
has worked so well in the past?
The answer is obvious.

Let us consider some of the
specifics of the program. Cal»

 

Student Requests Reprint of Article

The following is from an
article by Dr. John A. Logan
jr. president of Hollins Col-
lege, Virginia in the Hollins
College Bulletin. It appeared
in the Des Moines Register on
Monday, Sept. 14, and ap-
pears here at the requested a,
,Grinnell student.

Almost every college admin»
istration reports increasing
pressure from students to re-
lax rules and regulations on
smoking, drinking, cars, visit-
ing hours and curiews. while
the whole question of how far
the college should act in loco
parentls has been the subject
of heated debate.

Tremors from these seismic
disturbances have reached Hol-
lins in the form of a Wide-
spread concern about the effic-
acy of the honor system.

It seems to be generally con-
ceded that infractions of the
rules go unreported and there-
fore unpunished, and that there
is a general disinclination to
tell on anyone else, to be one's
sister’s keeper.

I have heard it argued that
obedience to the letter and
spirit of the honor code should
be a matter of individual con-
science only, not a matter of
corporate responsibility. Pre-
sumably, if an individual does
not agree with a rule or with
the system no one else ought
to enforce it on her.

Any system which leaves it
up to every individual to de-
cide whether a rule is just or
unjust is no system at all, but
anarchy.

An honor system differs from
any other regulatory mechan-
ism only ln the mode of en
forcement. It is enforced by
the subjects themselves rath-
er than by external authority.

The concept of honor grew
out of the medieval code of
chivalry in a steeply hierarch-
ical society. and the essence of
honor was the notion of an ob—
ligation to one's class or caste
not to bring disgrace upon oth-
ers by improper behavior.

It may be that, in the kind of
democracy that has evolved in
this country, such a sense of
corporate responsibility is an
anachronism. I do not believe
this is necessarily true, but I
do think tihat some conflict
exists between certain contemv
porary currents in American
democratic thought and prac-
tice and the idea of a self
enforcing honor code.

“has the same potential,

 

At the center of this problem
is the generally sorry condition
of the American family as a
focus of moral authority.

Haunted by ill-digested Freu-
dian strictures against parental
repression bedeviled by the
“progressive" cult of self-ex—
pression, urged toward per~
missiveness and beguiled by
false doctrines of family democ-
racy, parents have too often ab-
dicated their responsibility for
setting standards of behavior
and limitations on their Chil-
dren’s, freedom of action.

Afraid of inducing trauma, or
of being unpopular with their
Children or their children's
friends. they have yielded an
demands for privileges and lib»
erties which are clearly harm-
ful.

in so doing, these adults are
robbing their children of an es<
sential part of their education
by failing to provide clear
measures of right and wrong
and values based on something
firmer than the whims of the
crowd. It is an ethic which says
that because a good many peo-
ple are doing something, it is
normal and therefore right.

It must be made clear that
rules are made to protect
young people from hurting
themselves. not simply to keep
them from having fun.

We must also rid ourselves of
some of our worship and indul-
gence of youth and the false
notion that fun is an end in it-
self, rather than a by product
of doing hard things well, ’or
we will transform ourselves in»
to a society of adolescents.

We must also beware of the
prevalent and pernicious mlSA
conception that democracy imr
plies absolute equality. and
that any denial of equal worth
is un-Amencan.

Democracy in e a n 5 equal
rights before the law and equal
opportunity for individual devel-
opment to the limit of one’s po»
tential. and we have along way
to go in achieving these ideals;
but democracy emphatically
does not imply that everyone
that
knowledge and experience are
not to be valued above ignor»
ance and inexperience. and that
every man’s judgment is sov-
ereign and that every opinion
is as good as every other.

in other words, democracy
does not deny the principle of

isthenics are definitely benefi-
cial. Telephone speeches pro-
vide a twofold service. The
freshman learns the upperclass-
men’s names and also to an‘
swer the phone before lfwo
rings. The innocent humor of
these greetings makes the tasks
pleasant to perform. Beanies
cap off the prepping program.
By wearing his, the freshman
identifies himself with that
great institution Smith Hall (for
example).

Granted there may be a few
instances of irresponsibility on
campus. but should the vast
majority of upperclassmen suf-
fer the stamp of immaturity?
True, youth is given to excess;
but do not Confuse this with
moral laxness. With the em-
phasis on greater student re-
sponsibility given this year by
the encampment student leadA
ers and acting — president
Stauss, I am conﬁdent that a
large reservoir of individual
responsi 'lity will be tapped.
Fear not, sad freshman, Grin-
nell may not yet be perfect.
but it holds potent seeds for the
future.

A youthful upperclassman

’Sud Freshman“
Given Rebuttal

Dear Editor:
I would like to take issue with

a letter published last week in
the S and B for three reasons:
(1) the title was erroneous, (Z)
the contents show a marked
lack of maturity on the part of
the writer and (3) fhe signature
indicates that the writer doesn’t
have strong enough conviction:
to back up his words.

The title was “Frosh look at
upperclassmen." This implies
that the letter was a general
viewpoint held by all freshmen,
This is most cerminly not true
and the ~impresslon is false.
Most freshmen, perhaps ex-
cluding those who are socrally
untalented and thus are unu'lll-
ing to show themselves, are of
a totally different Opinion. Air
10W me to enlarge.

This sad freshman says that
the answer is obvious concern-
ing his queries about the use-
fulness of prepping and bean-
ies, etc., implying that they
are not useful and perhaps det-
rimental. It is truly rather obr
vious that. if a person cannot go
through what little bit was done

in the way of prepping. or if the
beannie hurts his little head or
ruffles his hair. and he cannot
take this. then he belongs no!
at college, but at home as close
to his mother as possible—at
apron string length. This sad
freshman also makes a very
witty joke about the library,
that someone is taking it. He
does not know Who this some»
one is but T. S. F. immediately
tags the whole body of upper-
Classmen with the sin. This is
not to say that some upper-
classmen may not fit the de»
scription but to condemn all, as

Poll Students an ideal President

Students in the newswriting
journalism course recently took
a poll among various students
concerning their attitudes to-
ward “the ideal college presi-
dent." Below are some of the
answers received:

Ted Lemaire, freshman, Lan-
gan: “Based on What I have
heard as a freshman, I think
the new president should be an-
other President Eowen. This is.
he should continue the policy of
improving Grinnell in itself, the
faculty and the program. rath-
er than adding many new
buildings."

N a n c y Morse, freshman,
Meats, ”The new president
should be a firm upholder of
the rules and policies of the
college. He should be friendly
and able to get out and meet
the students in order to dis-
cuss campus problems with
them.”

Tom Hartman, sophomore,
Langan, “i feel that his back-
ground should be in school and
business administration. He
should be strong enough to
keep old policies that have
served well in the past, but he
should also be willing to bring
in good new ideas. He should
make compromises between
student demands and needs,
and the reputation and ideals of
the college. Most important. he
should have the ability to work
with people.

Judy Mandelbaum, sopho-
more, Loose: “He should have
a policy of non-intervention in
student affairs, and should stick
to the basic task as mediator
between alumni and trustees.
He should in no way try to pro-
ject an image of Grinnell col-
lege or I typical Grinnell stu-
dent, He should be an educator
from an eastern school. Most
important, he should be aware
of the importance of individual-
ism in education. and treat siu<
dents as adults:"

Candy Rogers. junior.
James: "The new president
should be a threeainone man.
He should be an educator, a
businessman, and a public rela-
tions man. He should continue
to press former President Bow-
en’s plan for increased em-
phasis on learning and de-
creased emphasis on grades in
order to take competitive pres-
sure off the students.”

Wade Stevenson. senior. Lant
gen: “This is a very difficult

question to answer without
sounding nonrcomlnittal, but I
think the new president should
be fair, and yet firm. He must
be a man who draws on past
experiences, and also looks to
the future. He should hold the
interests of everyone in the
Grinnell College Community."

Ruth Unruh, senior. James:
“He should be a Midrwesterner
who has been educated in the
east. In this way he will have
both eastern flare, and Mid-
western hometown goodness.
He should be scholarly, but not
pedantic. He should be inter-
ested in the students, but should
interfere with them as little as
possible, and of course he
should continue the tradition of
academic excellence at Grin—
nell."

A of ta Free, sophomore,
Read: “The president’s main
obligation is insuring that
Grinnell fulfills its obligation
as a liberal arts college. That
means he'd have to be a man
devoted to the principles of a
liberal education, He should
also stay home more than Dr.
Bowen.” ’

Henry Wilhelm, freshman,
North Younkier: “The next
president should be a man who
is in tone wim reality as it ex-
ists today and who does not
fear new trends and new ideas
and who does not fear to imple-
ment these new trends and
ideas."

C h u c k Wall, sophomore.
North Younker: The next pres-
ident should be well-educated
and well-known in educational
circlss. He should also be con-
servative to more accurately
reflect the feelings of the board
of Trustees as well as to coun-
ternct the effect of a liberal
dean of men."

Randy Morgan, senior, West
Norris: “The next president
should have a magnetic person-
ality and should be a man who
could properly represent Grin<
nell off<campus The president’s
first obligation should be to the
Grinnell campus, however, and
he should have a more intimate
working knowledge of what ac-

tually is happening at the
school." -

Rod Owen, junior, North
Younker: “The next president
should be from 35-40 years old.
for it is in that age that the
president would have the best
combination of maturity and

he did. is pure idiocyi This
and freshman goes on to say
that he is bothered by the con-
stant question of “What are you
doing tonight, honey.” while he
is obviously attempting to study
at Burling Library. Perhaps if
he studied in his room in his
hall he wouldn't notice this, or
if he listened for the answer
to this annoying question, very
likely he would hear this, “l’m
studying for my classes tomoiu
row,” which is certainly a more
often heard Comment than the
one he quotes, and is undoubt-
edly an academic answer. This
sad freshman puts the yoke of
immaturity around his own
neck when he says that it is his
hope that his letter will chang-

the whole spirit on the campus;
he had better remember that
around here, the upperclass—
men are the leaders, and are
not to be led, especially by
this.

Finally. this sad freshman
denies us the privilege of know
ing him. 1 think perhaps this is
an indication that he is not so
sure he is right in his asser-
tions. 1, and 1 hope, you, take
as bunk any unsigned letter
which advocates reform, if the
reformer doesn't have enough
guts to show himself. I hope
this sad freshman will [recon-
sider his attitudes, and I call
upon my own class to lead him
to a new, mature conscious
mess. I frankly think he has
been reading too many college
catalogues.

openrmindedness. A man much
older than that would tend to
have fairly Well solidified ideas
and wouldn't be flexible enough
for Grinnell."

Alan Bernhardt, freshman,
Langan: “I should like a presir
dent who would strive to un<
derstand the students' prob-
lems by circulating throughout
the campus, talking to students
and professors and who would
do his best to correct any sit~
uation where there were prob-
lems."

Jacquie Morgan, sophomore.
Loose: “The new president of
Grinnell must be more than a
good administrator; he must
be able to communicate with
the student body. He must
command the respect of stu-
dents and encourage their par-
ticipation in student govern-
ment,"

Jim Stoddart, senior. Clark:
"The Grinnell president should
be vitally interested in the
process of liberal education, un-
derstanding its broader aspects
While retaining respect for its
various fields. He has to be a
parent, a money collector, an
arbitrator, a statesman. a schol—
ar, and ‘one of the guys) ”

Jane Guild, junior, Cleveland:
“We need a president with a
leadership and administrative
ability which commands great
respect and which, at the same
time, enables him to work
closely with and listen to the
ideas of students.”

Nancy Coulson, freshman,
Read: “He should be close to
the students, but not so close
that they consider him a friend
more than they admire him as
a president.”

Jeff Burnlnm, junior. Gates:
“He must be an administrator

Dominick Declares Reporters Fair,
Columnists Unfair to Goldwater

By Susan Taylor

The mam issue of the 1964
presidential campaign is cen-
tralization of power, according
to Sen, Peter Dominick (R-

, 0310.). He made this statement

in a student press conference in
Roberts Theater Tuesday of
ternobn.

Dominick answered q u e s4
tions posed by a student panel
representing Theta sigma Phi,
women's professional journal-
ism iralernity, Sigma Delta
Chi, men’s professional jour~
nalism fraternity, Young Re-
publicans, and Young Demo-
crats. Later the questioning was
thrown open to the audience oi
students, faculty and towns
people.

Power has been increasingly
concentrated in Washington and
in the Executive Department,
according to Dominick. "it we
can dispense this power and
get back to more state and lo-
cal government, we can do a
more effective job,” he said.

Dominick was asked to de-
fine a conservative. “The clas-
sical philosophical definition of
a liberal is what we believe in
as conservatives,” he said. This
involves a concept of as much
freedom as possible for the in-
dividual,

When asked about the farm
price supports program, an is-
sue with which Colorado is con-
cerned, Dominick said, “We’ve
got to move in thesdirection of
getting the government out oi
the lives of farmers.” l-le fur
ther explained that we need to
get back to the law of supply
and demand, in which he ex-
pressed strong faith.

“The breakdown of law and
order is of conSIderable con—
cern all over the country,“ the
Senator said in answer to a
question seeking an explana-

, tion of a national police force.

“Neither Scnator Goldwater
nor I feel that a national po-
lice force is necessary.” l-Ie

 

saicl that integrity ot govern-

 

ment at the national level
serves as an example for local
areas of law enforcement.

Dominick also emphasized
that there must be integrity of
the national government — es»
pecially there must be a lack of
the corruption evidenced in
such cases as Bobby Baker
and Billy Sol Estes 7 to serve
as examples for local and state
governments.

When asked about the civil
rights situation, Dominick said
"I don’t think the CiVll Rights
Bill is a partisan issue." He
voted for the bill which was re-
cently passed by Congress and
signed by President Johnson.

“I don't think you’re ever go»
ing to solve a civil rights
problem by legislation You can
create equality of opportunity,
but it‘s a situation which must
be treated on an individual ba-
sis once you have established
the legislative opportunity for
people to go forward or back-
ward as they like,” Dominick
explained. You have to get a
change in atmosphere and cli-
mate, he explained, and this is
a difficult problem which can-
not be solved by making lawsr
He termed it a problem of the
heart and mind, saying, “You
can’t legislate prejudice.”

Dominick is active in the
Goldwater campaign, but he re
fused several times to speak for
the Republican nominee for
President. He said that he feels
that on the whole the reporters
for the national news media

have been fair to the Republi-
can ticket, but that some of the
columnists have not represented
the views, statements and be
liefs of the senator fairlyr

When asked about the John
Birch Society, as an extremist
organization Dominick said,
"That’s a phony issue too. You
might think they were an atom
bomb." He referred to the so-
ciety as a “patriotic organiza-
tion trying to do something
about the course the country is
taking # especially in foreign
policy."

Dominick was asked for an
example of a federal program
which could be done more ef-
ficiently by state and local gov-
ernments. He cited the poverty
program.

He said that the election 0!
Senator Goldwater to the priest
dency would be of benefit in»
ternationally because it would
“help our allies to know where
we stand, and heaven’s knows
they don’t know where we stand
now.” He further commented
that it: was not his intention to
run an America election on the
basis of what Europeans think.

The press conference, the
sixth of its kind on campus, was
attended by about 200 students
and faculty members. It was

sponsored by Theta Sigma Phi,

Sigma Delta Chi, Young Repub-
licans, and the Program in
Practical Political Education.
Another such conference is
slated for next Tuesday and
will feature Senator Birch Bayh
(Dino).

Dominick: Issues May Be Clouded
By Concentration on Personalities

Announcing his intention to
“concentrate on the issues of
the campaign," Senator Peter
H. Dominick attacked the Ken-
nedy-Johnson Administration in
his speech Tuesday night in
Darby Gym.

Highlighting the annual Ree
publican Day activities, his ad»
dress covered morality in gov-
ernment, decentralization of
government, and foreign policy
— topics he termed “great is-
sues of the campaign some
times obscured by concentra—
tion on the personalities of
President Johnson and Senator
Goldwater."

He cited the Bobby Baker
case, involving the alleged
kickback of DC, Stadium in-
surance money to the 1960
Democratic campaign fund, as
an example of questionable
morality among high officials.

He feels the refusal of several
Democratically controlled Con—
gressional committees to in-
vestigate the case indicates that

‘ one party‘s overwhelming dome

inance in Congress may tend to
weaken its integrity

Thus he believes, ”We need
to strengthen the voice oi the
minority party.”

Moving onto the topic of de-
centralization of government,
the Senator inquired, “Why
should all the power he concen-
trated in the hands of a few
sell-anointed experts in Wash—
ington when this country has
been built on the ambition and
creativity of millions?"

He charged the Administra-

‘ lion’s War on Poverty with "ate

tempting to create a whole big—
ger than the sum of its past;”
neglecting the differences in the
problem of poverty in different
areas of the country by ”trying

‘ to put a blanket over the whole

us."

He asserted the high school
dropout section of the poverty
program ”provides the dropout
with food, housing, money, and
education." thus encouraging
more students to leave school.

“We only help the ones who

flunk the course," he said.
“Those who do the work and
stay in school get no as-
sistance."

He criticized the present Ad-
ministration‘s fiscal policies.
”Foreign officials say to us, ‘
‘Why don’t you balance your
budget?’ as if it were very sim«
ple “

"We will never balance the
budget if we reelect the Demo-
crats," he declared. drawing
applause from the audience
which included Republicans
from all over lowa. "The Dem-
ocrats have a I r e a d y pro-

grammed four inore years of
deficit spending "

“The United States has suf-
iered defeat after defeat all
over the world," he contended,
introducing the foreign policy
issue.

Although he praised Presl<
dent Kennedy's inauguration
address for its firm words
against Communism, Domin-

ick feels the late President‘s _

actions in Laos and Cuba failed
to fulfill his inaugural pro-
mises.

of Viet Nam he said, “We
don‘t have a policy as to why
We are there and What we are
going to do. Yet we keep send»
ing our soldiers over there."

He complained of the sale of
His. wheat to Russia on the
basis that the United States did .
not benefit from it enough.
“Let’s get something from them
in return instead of merely aC<
commodating our position to
their's.”

The Senator ended by quoting
Hans Morgenthau: “We walk
these empty skies from which
the gods have departed," and
expressing the desire that the
American people will not elect
a government which would lead
to such a world.

Three Grime/l Students In South America

By Sue Johnson
/“This is one of the greatest
experiences of my life,” writes
Jeri Langham, one of three
Grinnellians who are currently
doing research in the Costa Ri—

can tropics under the Central '

American Program of the As~
sociated Colleges of the Mid-
west.

Langham, a biology major,
Willard Van Horne, a Grinnell
graduate who majored in Span-
ish Literature and minored in
sociology, and John Pojman, an
economics and Latin American
studies major, are three of the
sixteen students from the Mid-
west who will carry on such
research during the 196465 Se-
mesters,

The Associated Colleges of
the Midwest, founded in 1958,
is an association composed of
ten coeducational, liberal arts
colleges: Beloit, Carleton, Coe,
Cornell, Grimell, Knox, Law-
rence, Monmouth, Ripon, St.
Olaf. It is designed to increase
the educational effectiveness
and operating efficiency of its
members by means of such pro-
grams as me Central American
Program.

cal ecology- and related scien-
tific fields It includes separate
but related studies of the tropie
cal environment from t h e
points of view of biology, geolo-
gy, anthropology» sociology,
and economics.

Theaims of‘the program are
to provide an effective means
by which faculty members can
obtain background for contin-
ued research in Latin America
and to introduce able students
to field study in the tropics
while their plans for fields of
specialization are still fluid

The ACM began developing
this program several years ago
because of the feeling that the
development of tropical science
and scientists is an important
but negleéted aspect of United
States higher education,

Drr Kenneth A. Christiansen,
(biologY) and five others com-
prised the original survey team
which made a tour of Venezu-
ala, Columbia, Panama, Costa
Rica, Guatemala, and Southern
Mexico in search of the best
area for study. Costa Rica was
determined the most acces—
sible, diversified tropical en—
vironment with the most gov-
ernment cooperation, and eight
faculty members from the ACM
went down to determine the
type of program most suitable
for the purpose.

The general design of the pro»
gram was worked out. by Dr.
Robert F. Voertman, associate
professor of economics at Grin—
nell. A fieldrresearchrseminar
program provides for investiga-
tion, and a group of tropical
scientists with significant ex~
perience'is available to serve
on the resident staff. The pro—
gram'is financed by a grant
from the National Science
Foundation, which is matched

in part by funds from non-Fed-
eral sources,

The entire Central American
Program lectures, basic
reading, and interviews of peo-
ple in the fields — is conducted
in Spanish, in which all three
Grinnellians are exceptionally
fluent. The participants begin
the program with preparation
on campus in the language, a
study of the area from the point
of view relevant to their fields
of interest, and outlines of their
research projects Upon arrival
in San Jose, they begin a six
weeks orientation program, af—
ter which they begin their field
Work and analytical reports,

Five students are in Costa
Rica for the first semester
(July 8-December 18, 1964), six
will be in Costa Rica for the
second semester (January 18-
June Ill), 1965), and five of the
students will participate in the

 

program for the entire year.
All but two of the students are
living with Costa Rican fami-
lies; the remaining two elected
to live in the pension.

The first project of field re-
search this year was a study of
biological and economic fea—
tures of pasture dairying as
practiced in Costa Rica.

For his individual project,
Langham, who will be in Costa
Rica for this Semester, chose
designing a field of methodoloe
gy for a reconnaissance study
of vegetational cover and land
vegetation in a series of eight
life zones

Van Horne, who will remain
for the whole year, is doing a
sociological study of the "hu-
aquero" in Costa Rica.
aquero" are men who engage
in excavating the contents of
pre-Colombian Indian graves,

“Hui

 

with or without government liv
censes, for gold and saleable
articles.

Pojman, while doing an ana-
lysis of the pasture dairying
study, is examining the possi-
bility of a research project on
meat production in relation to
the life zones. Pojman will also
participate for the full year.

Members of the ACM hope to
expand the Central American
program, both in numbers and
in the variety of work to be
done, and to begin a series of
on-campus research programs
to assist or correlate with the
field of studies. With expansion,
the program will help build up
a broad interest in and under-
standing of Central American
affairs and will increase the
information presented to the
students and faculty about our
neighbors in the South.

McMillan Explains Aims. Deiails
0i Arts and Crafts Workshops

By Nancy Gromko

To provide students with the
opportunity to work creatively
while developing the manual
skills traditionally associated
with arts and crafts is the aim
of the alt workshops.” states
Robert McMillan, chairman of
the program.

The program, in its fourth
year offers two hour weekly
workshops in ceramics, metal-
ry, drawing, watercolor painta
ing and printmaking. Enroll-
ment is limited to ten in each
class.

“An unfortunate division is
sometimes made between the
arts and crafts," McMillan
states. “Through participation
in the workshops one recog-
miles that working with utilitar—
ian crafts snems from the same
artistic inclination as the more
aspiring products of the fine
arts.”

in ceramics, the students
Work with basic clay bodies
and glaze. “By making simple
pots one learns the nature of
clay and how to work within
the limits of its strength and
stability."

Pencils, crayon, and charcoal
are among a great variety of
instruments employed in draw-
ing workshops. Compositions
are based on various visual re
sponses to one’s surroundings.

Using sterling silver and
ebony, teak or rosewood, stu-
dents in metalry workshops

_ may fashion pins or pendants
based on free-form designs.
"The first problem” states
Louis Zirkle, instructor “is to
get a workable design on pa
per. Then comes the problem of
craftsmanship."

Mono-prints, linoleum prints
and wood-cuts will be the pro-
?ducts of activity in the graphics
workshop. In the watercolor
group a casein medium will be
employed,

Tara Hookham art major at-
tributes her interest in the
(traits to previous participation
in the metalry and ceramics
workshops “You become a pen
fectionistl You can' just slap
something together."

"Working with metal and

ceramics satisfies two different
urges,“ Miss Hookham states.
“Metal is a resistant medium
and requires a great deal of
precision. The clay bends to
your will."
‘ She encourages participation
in the workshops. “Anyone can
make something. It‘s justa
matter of patience and precis-
ion.”

Chemistry major Mary Sue
Wilson finds the workshops a
pleasant diversion from study-‘
ing. “You can do something enl
joyable without having artistic,
talent.” l

Contrasting the difference ini

Team Plays Scots
Firsl Away Game

By Kenton Clymer

“Can Monmouth possibly de-
feat Grinnell?" was the ques—
tion posed to Edd Bowers,
coach of the fighting Pioneer
football team.

“The question should be, ‘Can
Grinnell defeat Monmouth?”

. was Bowers' quick reply. “Any

team in the Midwest Confer‘
ence could defeat Grinnell. ll
Monmouth can keep their mo-
rale up after losing their first
two games, they could be
tough.”

Opening day, the Scots took
it on the Chin from Cornell 28‘0.
Last Saturday Ripon rolled over
Monmouth 2770.

Riponrand Cornell are the two
top contenders in the confer-

- ence.

Plowing through the Knox line for a ground gain for the Pioneers is Elston

Spirited Gridmen irounce Siwas-h
For First Victory of 1964 Season

By Nick Nona:

A spark of life hit the Grin-
nell College campus Saturday
as the Pioneer gridmen, bol-
stered by an enthusiastic and
spirited crowd — a rarity at
Grinnell, trounced the Knox
Siwash 1670, chalking up their
first victory of tile 1964 came
paign.

The most impressive note of
the about»iace from last Week’s
showing by the Pioneer defen-
nve secondary, which allowed
only two pass completions of
eleven attempts, [or ten yards.
Deiensively, the P i o n e e r s
played a commendable game,
giving up only 149 total yards,
Only once were the Siwash able
to move past the Grinnell 38,
when they penetrated to the
Pioneer 16, and then lost the
ball on clowns.

Late in the ﬁrsgquaxter the
Pioneers began to move the
pigskin. With halfbacks Elston
Bowers and John .Shierholz
grinding out the yards, Grin-
nell drove from its own 46 to
the Knox 18 early in the second
quarter. With fourth down and
eight, Dave Gauger booted a
field goal from the Z7 yard line
for the only score or the first
half.

The Pioneers tallied the first
touchdown oi the game driving
46 yards for the score in the
third quarter. Fullback Marty
Ringo picked up nine to the
Knox 37, Shierholz carried the
ball to the 23 in two runs. Quar-
terback Denny Hanssen gained
three yards on a keeper play.
then hit Bowers on the next
play with an aerial on [he 11.
Ringo drove for five more yards
to the 6, but was thrown for a
loss to the 7 yard line on the
next play. Again the pioneers
came through in the clutch, as

 

Hanssen w i th fourth down
tossed a seven yard pass to
Gauger for the marker. Gauger
kicked the conversion for a 10-0
lead.

The Pioneers put the icing on
the cake late in the fourth quara
tei‘ with the final score of the
game. Chip Clarke intercepted
a Knox pass on the Grinnell 39
and returned the ball to the op»
ponent’s 22. With time running
out Hanssen fired two incom-
plete passes to Gauger in the
endzone. Barry Anderson, tak~
ing over the signal calling,
tossed a screen pass to Bowers
tor the touchdown with 34 sec-
onds remaining on the clock.

The win marked the eighth
time in the last ten meetings of
the two teams that Grinnell has
emerged victorious, with one
contest ending in a tie.

Next week the Pioneers jour-
ney to Monmouth to battle the
Scots.

Hard Hit Harrier-s
Go to Monmouth

The cross country runners,
who broke into the victory Col-
umn for the first time last week
by capturing their own Les
Duke Invitational, will be aim-
ing for win number two when
they match strides with Mon-
mouth Saturday at Monmouth,
Ill.

The meet is scheduled for
1:45 p.m. on the Scots’ three—
mile course. ,

Running for Grinnell will he
seniors Bruce Beckord, and
Clyde Smith; and sophomores
Steve Brintnall and Andy Bush-
nell.

Captain Paul Patterson, is
still sidelined with a leg injury.
He can't even do any running
for at least two more weeks.

Rod Brown is out for the next
three weeks with mononucle<
osis. He was Grinnell’s top {in-
isher in the Duke Invitational,
coming in fourﬂ'i with a 16:46.0
clocking for the three-mile run.
That's more than a minute over
the Course record he set in 1963.

Beckord was seventh in 17:04,
Brintnall was 11th in 17:13,
Bushnell was 17th in 1 '
Smith was 18th in‘ 17:40.

Monmouth, which posted an
8-0 dual meet mark in 1963 and
finished fourth in the confer-
ence (compared to Grinnell’s
second-place spot) has a sopho-
more - dominated squad this
year that includes only three
upperclassmen.

Monmouth will be led by co»
captains William Taylor; quar~
terback, and Robert Tucker,
halfback. Taylor is also an out-
standing Wrestler, and is the de—
fending coniorence champion in
the 157 lb. division.

Coach Bowers was generally
happy with the playing or the
Pioneers last week against
Knox, and expects to make no
major changes ’in the line-up.
He plans to continue using the
platoon system, which worked
well against the Siwash.

Guard Larry Miller Will still
be out of the lineup due to an
injury. Coach Bowers hopes he
will be able to take limited
workouts this week so that he
will be in shape for the Home-
coming game.

The weakest point in the Grin-
nell attack is the offense. “Our
blocking must improve,” com-
mented Bowers, although he
pointed out that Knox had an
excellent defensive squad.

With three weeks of the 1M.
football schedule in the record
books, Clark and Smith, both
holding unblemished records,
would seem to be meeting ex-
pectations as the teams to' beat,
Smith boasting a 2-0 record,
edged by a tough Langan team
on opening day. A last peiiod
touchdown proved to be the
necessary margin in this 7.0
battle. A seven point margin
was enough for Smith's second
victory also. Smith—13, South#
7. The Clark offense has proved
potent in their three wins, scor-
ing 92 points. Most impressive
Was their 4570 hard fought kit
umph over Rawson.

Dibble, having lost only to
Clark, shares third place in the
standings with West and East.
All three teams are 2 and 1.

Perhaps the most exciting
game of the season was played
between Langan and North.
North jumped out to an early
lead and led at half time by a
score of 11H). However, Langan
struck hack early in the third
quarter and cut the North lead
to six. Finally with less than
three minutes to be played
Doug McCormuck intercepted
a North pass and returned it
sixty yards to even things up,
The all important extra point
was made and the Langan de~
tense held onto the 14713 vic-
tory. North rebounded two days
later by defeating Rawson 15-0,
and gaining a tie with Langan

by Dick Lovell

Grinnell's athletic teams did a dangerous thing last
weekend. Each of them won its contest and the cross-
country team showed the results of too much deviance
from academic goals by beating four other'schools.

If this trend continues it will certainly allow our
athletes to enjoy a disproportionate amount of prestige.

People might start coming to soccer games; athletics “

might become a campus conversational topic; and

(heaven forbid!) people might go as far as to yell, ‘

scream, and carry on in a most juvenile fashion at foot-
ball games. Let this be a warning to all Pioneer athletic
teams. “Watch your winning ways!” They are the first
harbingers of the ruination of Grinnell’s healthy atmos-
phere.

I hope that through the medium of exaggerated
sarcasm, I have somewhat accurately satirized existing
feelings among many factions of the Grinnell student
body, administration, and especially the faculty. The
arguments against the vigorous pursuit of athletic ex-
cellence at Grinnell College are many, and for the most
part, I think, ill founded, or at best based upon valid
criticisms of institutions of an entirely different nature
from Grinnell. Next week I shall present a few gen-
eralizations which should serve to refute to some de-
gree some of the arguments of these “anti-athletic"
factions.

Perhaps the answer to our problem is named Gene
Mauch. We could probably find the shortest path to
athletic oblivion in no time under his guidance, al-
though ho would certainly have competition from the
city of Cincinnati. Now there’s a place which has to be
full of academic excellence. After all, only 7,000 people
turned out to see the Red’s play a crucial game with
the Pirates the other night. Isn't that somehow indi-
cative of a really healthy community sense of values?
It must be.

It was tho closest pointapan

First place in the 37 man race
was Gena Takle of Luther, who
set a new course record of

was 11th, Bushnell was 17th,
and Smith lBLh which added up
to 57 points and first place.

Soccer Team Tests
Perfect Record

The only unbeaten Pioneer
sports team, Coach Irv Si-
mone's soccer 11, will be point-
ing for win number four when
it faces always tough MacMur-
ray at Jackson, 111., on Satur-
day. l

The match will be the third
straight on the re ad for the
Pioneers. They whipped Law-
rence 4-1 and Ripon 7~l on a
Wisconsin invasion last week-
end to up their mark 3-0.

MacMurray, which fields no
football team and has soccer as
its major fall sport, represents
by iar the toughest test yet for
Grinnell and could be the turn-
ing point of the season for his
Pioneers, according to Simone.

“A victory over MacMurray‘
could give us the boost we will,

need if we hope to upset Wheat-
on and Lake Forest, two mid-
west powers, in later games,”
he stated,

“We are improving, but still
have an awful long way to go,”
Simone added.

Improved scoring balance
was one of the highlights of the
Wisconsin trip. Five Pioneers—
Vince Anku, Frank Chilingulo,
John Emery, Felix Lungu, and
Fred Miller—shared ll goals at

Paradoxical though ii: may
seem, true freedom comes
through commitment —- com-
mitment to people, to ideas, to
causes greater than oneself.

Freedom lies in being able to
choose an area of engagement
and intensive interest, it cannot
be found in aimless hedonism
or irresponsible drift.

The joys of freedom reside in

using one’s powers to the full
in the service of some worthy
enterprise that commands all
one's depth of conviction and
devotion.

We are happiest when we are
fully used, and it is the bore-
dom and frustration of disen-
gagement that makes us queiu-
lous and petty and mean.

Rawson can still claim a dozen

that they may not be too good,
