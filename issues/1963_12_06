On the basis of an extensive report submitted by
the SGA committee appointed to examine the automo«
bile rule section of the Council on Student Life’s 1963
report, the Student Senate, Wednesday night passed a
motor vehicle regulation which includes two key pro-
visions: (a) “Students of Junior and Senior class status
are permitted to maintain and operate motor vehicles”
and (b) ”Students of sophomore, junior and senior
class status may drive cars maintained and operated by
other students for social purposes with the permission
of the owner.”

The ,SGA committee’s five page report included
detailed objections to all five of the principal reasons
that were cited by the Faculty Council on Student
Life “to justify continuation of the present rule, (Only
students who are members of the senior class are per-
mitted to maintain and operate motor vehicles while in
attendance at Grinnell College).” -

The committee report also listed a number of
"positive advantages” that they felt would accompany
the liberalization of the automobile rule. Some of these
advantages are:

1. The presence of more automobiles on cam- -

pus would help minimize the disadvantages of
Grinnell’s cultural isolation.

2. An automobile would establish at least one
means for a student to obtain privacy.

3. More automobiles would facilitate and
make more economical transportation to House-
parties and other events involving the moving of
large numbers of students.

4. More automobiles at Grinnell would result
in significant decrease in the cost of transportation
to and from Grinnell for many students.

In support of the Motor Vehicle regulation as
passed by the Student Senate, we would like to make
a few additions to the SGA committee's list of “positive
Advantages” accruing to the change.

1. With the continual shift in college academic
policy toward more academic freedom for the student
through increased opportunities for independent study
in his or her major field, the greater availability of an»
tomobiles would broaden considerably the possible
scope of any such study. It should make readily avail-
table the extensive library facilities of nearby univer-
sities (SUI, Iowa State, Drake) and provide an oppor-
tunity for Grinnell students to attend lectures at these
and othervnearby schools, Other academic benefits of
a liberalized car rule would include increased oppor-
tunities for personal interviews with prominent people
in the area and direct observation of educational events
by interested students

2. Due primarily to Iowa climate conditions during
the months of December through the middle of April,
student travel, even within the confines of the campus,
is severely restricted. Students tend to become semi-
hermits, venturing out of their dormitory rooms, for
the most part, only when it is absolutely necessary.
The greater availability of cars throughout the winter
months would allow for greater student movement
and a healthier campus atmosphere.

We applaud the work of Cal Collier’s SGA com—
mittee for the fine job done on its report, as well as the
Student Senate for its speedy passage of the new
Motor Vehicle regulation. We hope to be able, in the
near future, to add our kudos to the popular acclaim
that would greet passage of this new regulation by the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, the President.
und the Board of Trustees.

Radicals Blur Political Picture

Extremists seem to dominate American
politics today. They have not captured all
of the votes and offices as yet, but extrem—
ist groups make so much noise with their
screaming that it is sometimes difficult to
hear anything else at all. The Bircllers ex-
pose half the government as “Communlst
dupes and sympathizers", While the far left
attributes all the World’s evil to Wall Street.
The right demands a withdrawal from
“dangerous internationalism" While the lelt
condemns the waste and injustice of a free
enterprlse economy. The Americans for
Democratic Action and the Americans for
Constitutional Action trade insults. The
National Review and the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee call each other ”sinister
conspiracies."

It is comforting to View these radical
groups as the creations of small minds.
They are dismissed as lairly ignorant
groups with simplistic answers, cater-
ing to the uneducated All that is needed
is a little education, and then the radi<
cal cannot stand.

Ii we accept this premise, it should follow
that a student at an institution of higher
learning should be fairly impervious to the
attractlon of their neat answers and com
spiracy theories. Theoretically he has more
knowledge than the average man, and has
more tools of analysis at his disposal. And
of course, he can always ask the opinion
of hls faculty, who are even higher on the
scale of enlightenment and judiciousness.
He should be safe.

The unpleasant fact, however, is that
radical student groups of all kinds are
rapidly spreadlng across the country.
There have always been student groups
with extreme political vlews, but never be~
fore have they managed to grow so large,
so well organized. and so well financed.

The in lelt is represented by many
groups. The Students For a Democratic So-
ciety, which started in June 01 1962, is prl<
nlarily an Eastern group, but is rapidly
spreading across the Country The Campus
Americans For Democratic Action is much
lurlher to the left than its parent organlza»
llon, the ADA. The Young Socialist Alli-
ance has a number of growing chapters
across the country. New York City has ”.5
own local group, Advance, which has now
been indicted under the Smith Act as a
CDmmlmlSerl‘Ont organization.

The right wing has only one major stu-
dent organization, the Young Americans
for Freedom, but it is the largest and best-
tlnanced of all of the racial groups, The
YAF was set up In 1960 on the private es-
tate of William Buckley, of National Re-
view iame. It now has more than 20,000
members across the country, as well as a
slate of full-time officers. Juniors and sen<
lors here will remember Fulton Lewis III,
the YAF representative who Came to GX‘m‘
hell in 1962 to delend the House UnaAmerh
can ActiVllles Committee and the film “op-
eration Abolition".

Even more disturbing is the extent to
which extremist groups have been able to
capture the natlonal conventlons ot/ the
Young Republicans and Young Democrats.
Last June's YR Conventlon in San Fran-
cisco came out with an unbelievable plat-
form, closely parallellng the views of the
John Birch Society. in September in San
Diego. the Young Democrats set ionh an
ultra~llberal platform which led several
prominent Democratic leaders, including
Governor Brown, to publicly repudiate the
whole affair.

There is probably a hlgher percentage
of students in extremist organizations toe
day than from any other age or occupa-
tional group. The question of why is large-
ly unanswered (and largely unasked). My
own hypothesis is the following:

3. Students DO have more political
information than the man on the street,
theoretical and rather superficial.
but this information is in most cases
There is lime real political insighr on
today’s campus.

11. There is a certain excitement in
challenging accepted values and ways
of doing things.

1:. There is no real responsibility for
which most student groups are held ac-
countable, ,such as running a govern-
ment. These groups are not unlike pro-
fessors in this regard.

d, There is real disillusionment‘with
the present system which allows dis-
criminalion, poverty, and violence on
the scale u-lat they exist. in this country.
These students want in change the sys-
tem, and lind the substitution of a new
system easier than muddling through
the complexities of the one that actually
exists.

Grinnell's Social Problem

Problem solved: The cause of “the
Gl‘innell SDClal problem" is individuality.
individuality is generally expressed in two
ways at Grinneli. Most students (60 per
cent) are passive individualists while a
healthy minority (35 per cent)'al:e active
individualists, ”PaSSlve" and “active”
will be defined after considering the
pressures that lead the student to choose
between them.

Grinnell’s social and philosophical posi<
tlon makes individualism almost ines-
capable. There are no permanent social
societies, athletic idolatry Suffers, and
honor societies have small enrollments.
The stutlent body has neither a common
ethnic, religious, intellectual, economic,
or social basis. Further, our stay is limited,
thereby inhibiting tradition.

Since the college offers no answers ex-
cept every possible answer in that omniv-
orous conglomeration ot interdisciplinary
cross»qualilaction, since teachers think
that personal prejudice will mislead stu~
dents more than blatant objectivity . . .
somehow believing that by suppressi g
their own feelings they will cause the stu<
dents to develop theirs, since “Well, there’s
something to that, but then on the other
hand" never ends, our students are forced
to become indiVldualists.

Now, active individualism, in healthy per-

spective, is fine. However, most Grinnell
students become passive individualists,
which is not so fine. it happens this way;
The College takes its young pedants,
scarcely out or high school, and woos their
pride by admiring their never, herctoinre,
equalled intelligence; “ . , highest Board
Scores yet!” out the new sludent soon

honesty and personal integrity are pro-
posed by the College as a greater value
than the grade point AND all tlle illrdi-
gestcd bourgeois (or whatever) Values the
student brings with him to Grinnell, But
our College does not provide the needed
replacements of society and ideals.

Honesty and integrity outside of society
loses meaning. Society without generally
recognized guides is indetinable. w. 1.
Thomas calls individualism ”a stage ot
transition between two types oi social or-
ganization," Man naturally associates With
other men, Only when his principles will
not let him iraternize is he lorced to Willi-
draw. But the passive indwldual makes a

virtue of isolation, which is really making
a Virtue ot necessity.

Passive individualism is a prideful but
empty alienation from one’s iellows. Per~
sons unable to have satisfactory social in
tercourse will substitute a solitary. ideal
for a social one. They will View With satis-
iaction their uncompromising attitudes
which they think is the only way to preserve
their integrity, Passively individualistic
people, who cannot successfully interact
with Others, use individualism as their de-
fense mechanism, It is a mask of confi-
dence worn to deceive, hopefully, even the
wearer.

The passive individualist may misread
Thoreau, by thinking there is something
inherently good in being on one's own. Yet,
Thoreau did not move to the woods to get
away trorn people, he went because he
wanted to: he was not escaping from the
town, he was going to the forest, In his
treerfurnishcd Cloister he read books (about
people), talked to itinerant bums, and pur-
sued a vigorous society With his primi-
tive friends: the icons, the railroad, et. al.
Thoreau was no more alone than Custer
Was at Bull Run. ‘

A counter to passive individualism is ac-
tive individualism. While the passive in-
dividualist seeks to protect the self, active
individualisis express the sell. This expres-
sion is social. The active individualist re-
alizes that his own position gains strength
in the concurrence of like minds. So then,
many Griiineli students not laking the path
ot solitary passivity will actively stake and
dclend their beliefs. The danger of active
individualism is that some may express
themselves only because they reject the
contusion of their present situation. They
substitute cogency ior doubt, pretering to
find some meaning (any meaning) rather
than wander in a vacuum. To find meaning
they may overcompensate, narrowing their
views, excluding alternatives.

Grinnell students. if they are to socialize
must have common grounds on which
to meet. withdrawal or a narrow preoc-
cupation does not encourage social inter—
course. Individuals should know that assa-
clation is not necessarily a form at compro-
mise or merely a usetul and comtorting
prop tor their feelings and ideas. Grinnell
students, who hope to be of service to
others, must try to iielp each other. There
is a need to eslablish norms. There is a
need to see tilt: group as an amplification
of, not an escape irom, reality. Anti so, to
conclude on a [elicltous note: there is B
need to be silly too . , . together with some-
one else.

Board of Publications Decision
Creates Demand for Reform

To the editor

Tile failure of the Faculty
Committee on Student Publica-
tions to reappoint Jim Herzog
to a second term as editor of
the Scarlet and Black seems to
be a regrettable mistake for
several reasons.

The 5&3 is presently in the
process ot making a potentially
advantageous change or print-
ers. The appointment as editor
of someone devoid of knowl-
edge at the technical Clifliculr
ties involved in this change
seems rather curious.

The 5&3 is committed by
to continue printing
at the new facilities in Newton
ior one and onehalt years, but
the paper will not, even have
gained a solid foothold there
when the complication of a new
and technically untrained edlr
tor is added.

The apparent lack of consid
eration of the opinions of the
present SKtB' staff leaves the
board open for further criti-
cism. The refusal to rename
the present editor can be inter
preted as a stricture of the
quality of the 5&3. The start is
naturally indignant over this in~
direct attack, which is ulie
called-for.

Many on the staff reel re
luctant to continue working tor
the new editor ill light of this
criticism. Should the new Edl'
tor find herself without a
trained stait next year, a ma
jor problem, for the 53:3 and

for the entire college, will de-
velop.

Another interesting outcome
or the appointment at a new
editor is the fact that the
board’s vote was tive taculty
and administration members in
tavor of the new editor, with
four student board members in
{ever at retaining the present
editor. Obviously, the faculty
members are going to have
their way; the token student
represen tion is larcical.

One final criticism can be
levied against the board. On
the whole, the present board
could not impartially select an
editor because of ltS'laCk of ac-
quaintance With, or concern
tor, Journalistic considerations.
This fact can be illustrated by
noting that most hoard mem-
bers (and this pertains mainly
to iaculty members on the
board) made no attempt to
look into the qualifications, as
demonstrated by past perform-
ance, ot the person whom they
named editor.

Thei Faculty Committee on
Student Publications has shown
itselt to be a poor arbiter or
student iournalistic etiorts. The
board should be reformed to
give students control of their
own publications.

Hidden Dissenters to SGA Policies
Sympaihize with Administration Stand

To the editor:

For over year the problem
of what rules Grinnell students
really want‘has been with us.
We have regarded the Admin-
istration as our black advere
sary, our Enemy. But is it
really? We hay: sought
changes in some or the most
controversial rules — drinking,
opensrooms, and to a lesser ex-
tent, the car rule. The officials
of the college were supposed to
understand how deeply these
rules intringe upon our Individ-
ual Freedom, to emphasize
with us, and to give us what
we want because we want it.

Yet how many or us have

sympathized, much less em-
pathized, with the position or
the administration, who is
charged with maintaining
Grinnell’s public image and
convincing fearful parents,
alumni, and friends of the
college that it is not an
amoral jungle, in order to
gain funds and support for
our progressive educational
program?

This year has seen many
changes, for example, the in
troduction of Grinnell Student
I. D. Cards, the abolition of the

10:30 night-check and the schol—
arship restriction, and, above

all, a vastly liberalized drink-
ing rule. "Other moderate,
changes are possiblei‘n the car
rule, in women's hours, and tho
signrout procedure.

Instead, however, the SGA
has chosen to press such con»
troverSlal issues as the still
temporary open-rooms pro-
gram, thus putting us all in a
very difficult position. First of
all, the suggested procedura'
seems to have latent opposition
in many quarters which has
been silent and which it seems
SGA officials have not made
great ettorts to ascertain. A
referendum would be desirable.

Secondly, such legislation
puts the student body in an un-
tenable position. Thirdly, the
p r o p o s e d open-rooms rule
places an unlair burden on
those who must enforce it.

We are living in this college

Robbins Rehukes Women

By Jean Vandervoort

The need for improved wom-
an participation on the Student
Senate. and the p r 0 pos e d
change in the Faculty Commit»
tee on Student Publications
were the topics or discussion in

the AWS Board meeting last
Monday.

“I hear continual complaints
from South Campus that; they
are underrepresented,” Ed
Robbins, Student S e n a i: e
Speaker, told the AWS Boardr
North Campus’ two vote ad-
Vantage makes little differ-
ence, he said. He Claimed, in—
stead, that the women repre-
sentatives are ineffective be-
cause they are rigidly instruct-
ed by their halls; their knowl~
edge of parliamentary proced-
ure is deficient; and they do
not make use of poliﬁcal prin
ciples.

While most of the men’s
dorms depend on individual
pressure to intluence their
senators’ votes. the women’s
dorms usually “instruct" their
senators by a group vote, Robe
bins explainedi “I’m against
instruction at all," he said.
"Individual pressure on the
senators allows them more
freedom in discussing the is-
sues and guarantees more in-
terest.”\

Robbins commented that the
women representatives seemed
to know little about parliamen-
tary procedures He added,
“it takes only three hours to
read a condensation of R0-
bert's Rules of Order.

“The women are the least
political members of the Son
ate,” Mrr Robbins said. “.They
would be more influential if
they knew what they were

doing.” Poor preparation,
weak arguments, and iailure
to unity as a group when it
would benefit them are the rear
sons he gave ior their political
ineffectiveness

Mr, Robbins suggested that
the women's halls decide at
the first or the year whether or
not they Will determine their
senators‘ votes by group vote.
The senators should be well
prepared to discuss issues of
high interest.

Marie Martin, AWS Board

president, announced that lho
Executive Cabinet has issued
a statement which calls tor a
majority of students on the
Committee on Student Publi-
cations. The committee is now
composed of five faculty mem.

said that a student majority

Peace Corps Plans
TrainingProgram

The Peace Corps announced
plans today tor tthe largest
spring training program in the
agency’s history.

Volunteers scheduled for as»
signments in 18 nations will ens
ter training at U.S. colleges
and universities in February-
March, said Peace Corps Di-
rector Sargent Shriver. An es-
timated 1,500 prospective Vol—
unteers will participate in the
training programs.

in past years, only about 400
Volunteers have entered mid-
year training programs, shri-
ver said. While the peak in-put
period will continue to be the
summer months, he said this
year’s large spring group will
fill urgent requests from coun-
tries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.

Many of the spring group will
be midyear graduates or us.
colleges and universities who
will till teaching assignments,
most of which require college
degrees. But about onethird of
the spring trainees will not be
required to have degrees.

The spring training pro-

grams will prepare Volun-

 

teers'for service in Somalia,
Malaysia, Nigeria, Ecuador,
Nepal, Thailand, india, Ja-
maica, Togo, Colombia, Pan-

serve for two years, including
training. They get a modest
living allowance designed to let
them live at a level equal to
that of the people with whom
they work — plus a $75 month-

mliun Professor of Chemistry
xamines Education at Grinneil

By Karen Adkinson

Grinnell is being scrutinized
ls semester: Tile observers
~e Thomas Barnabas, visiting
'ofessor of chemistry, and his
le.
The Barnabases are carefully
:aminlng the college to find
chniques of administration
hich might be applicable to
hmednagar College in India,
which Mr. Barnabas is prin-
pal.

Barnabas explained, “We

'ant to find out about experi-

ents in education and select

ose which will serve us. We
ave been interested in stu-
ent government, in its activi—
ies and its effect on campus.

150, the way in which physical

ducatlon fits into the academ-

pattern interests us. We have

150 been in on the college

udget and its preparation.

He went on, “The planning
of the addition to the science
building has been most in-
teresting. The chemistry de-
partment has already had
meetings to discuss its needs
and what it would like to see
included. This impresses me;
it is something new, in India
there is no extensive system
in which the man who is ac-
tually going to work in a
building has a voice in the

plans."

The educational system in
India is highly centralized. All
regional colleges including Aha
mednagar are atriliated with
the University and must use
textbooks, follow a syllabus,
and offer examinations speci-
fied by the University. No de-
grees can be COi‘ilel‘rEd except
through the University.

The tests are administered
nation-Wide and at the same
time, Grading is done not at
the college at which the tests
were taken but at another col-
legc. The grade in a course de-
pends entirely upon the exam;
there is no cumulative grade
for classwork etc.

‘We are trying to reform the
system somewhat," said Mrs,
Barnabas, “The courses are
being reworked. For example,
we are helping to rewrite the
chemistry syllabus." ‘

/

Next semester the Barna-
bases will be touring small
liberal arts colleges all over
the nation as a part of a U. S.
State Department program.
Six heads of colleges in
South East Asia are being
sent to the U. S, for this tour.

Two weeks will be spent on
each campus.

The Barnabases were here in
1949 when Mr. Barnabas was
a student at the University of
Minnesota. The changes they
noted include ‘small, silly
little things' such as more pre-
cooked foods and the disap-
pearance of pressure cookers.
Mr. Barnabas also noted,
“American people are very in»
ternationally minded now, un<
like 14 years ago. They are
more conscious of our prob-
lems and seem to feel that
what happens in other areas of
the world might affect them.
They seem to be saying. “We
cannot be uninterested specta-

tors in the world's affairs any.
more,"

The Barnabases have seen
vast changes in their own
country also, many of which
have been brought about by ed-
ucation. .

Mrs. Barnabas n o t c d,
“There is no more middle in
a change. The son of an illite
crate farmer who is earning
subsistence wages may be-
come an educated man with
a Very high income. The fa-
ther doesn‘t always under-
stand the change, but he
wants it for his child. We look
for tomorrow and for a bet-
ter life."

Mr. Barnabas added, "in the
college we can see change in
five years. There is a revolu«
tion in family structure and
economics even in the time
since independence. The col-
leges are now turning out an-
gry young men, which is a good
sign because they will provide

 

change in the future.”

 

Travel Scholar lo Ahmednagar, India.
Describes Experiences, Observations

By Nancy McCannon

Jean Gisscnass, Travel Schol.
or to India. who came to the

Younker’s Lounge discussion
last Friday wearing a bright,
blue sari, enumerated some of
lndia's main problems and
cited the part that Ahmedna-
gar, the Indian School in which
she taught last year, played in
solving them.

She listed India’s longestande
ing problems: the tendency of
students to leave the villages
after they are educated, inadea
quate transportation and com-
munication, a language barrier
caused by the many dialects
and languages spoken in lndia,
and a resulting lack of national
feeling.

Ahmednagar, she s a i d
had added a program to pro-
vide higher education in the

village life. During last
year‘s Chinese invasion the
school got news of the,situa—

 

[ion to surrounding gillagcs.

 

She felt that india itself is
taking definite steps toward
solving its difficulties with
greatly improved transporta<
tion facilities and a current
review of the problems in-
volved in a national lan-
guage.

Miss Gissenass, whose duties
included teaching advanced
English, supervising the ladies'
dormitory, and planning the
music program for the chapel
services, said that she felt she
had become a part of student
life in India, “The students
were very friendly, and ire-
quently invited me to their
homes and activities”

“The Travel Scholar pro-
gram isn’t long enough,” was
the one complaint. “I think that
much more could be accom-
plished if the Grinilell program
were two years long instead of
one year,“

Miss Gissenass is now super-
vising a YMCA program in St,
Louis.

 

Sex. Morality. Psychoanalysis
Discussed by Smith. Berryhill

By Ann Showalter

Reverend Joseph Smith of
the Presbyterian Church in
Colfax and Dr. Leroy Berry-
hill, Director of the Jasper
County Mental Health Center
in Newton, discussed “Sex,
Morality and Psychoanalysis"
Sunday in Younker ”Lounge.

Smith observed that the nat-
uralists and the dualists hold
opposing views on sex and the
physical world in general.

The adherents of naturalism
have ”an accepting attitude
towards the physical and view
the sexual nature of man with
gratitude and joy,”

The dualist, on the other
hand, shrinks from “glut-
tony, greed, lust and naked-
ness," believing the real
world to be ”invisible to the
eyes of the flesh, attainable
only lhrou g h contempla-
tion.:’

According to Smith, true
Christianity is not dualistic.
Christianity developed from
Judaism, a faith which ac-
knowledges the value of nature
in the story of the Creation.
After He created the world
and Man, “God saw that it was
good." This means that man
in his natural state is “good."

Smith belives that if people
would follow Jesus' precept,
“Love God, love your neigh~
her," they would act towards
each other out of consideration
and would not try to exploit
each other sexually.

Smith feels, “Sex is good
with the right motivations be-
hind it." He thinks that the in<
dividual who does not act with-
in the mores of society is act-
ing from the wrong motiva-
tion and will be likely to suf-
fer from anxiety causing him
to be unable to love God fully.

Berryhill stressed the imv
portance of the individual's de-
veloping for himself a “pre
martial sex ethic.”

He said that for some people,
both married and single, sex is
enjoyable and satisfactory; for
others, it seems to bring more
problems than pleasure.

Sex can create such prob-
lems as divorce, unwanted

 

pregnancy and marriage,

and “guilt feelings.” To
avoid such problems, each
person must set up a stand
ard for himself based on two
general principles: “what
seems right to him” .and
“good judgment."

“Most sexual problems re-
sult from a person’s doing
something he really thinks is
wrong,” Berryhlll Stated.

in doing what seems right a
person must use good judg-
ment which includes considera-
tion of the other person in-
volved and of the possible con.
sequences.

Berryhill thinks good judg-
ment may help a couple avoid
situations in which they might
tend to become overstimulatn
ed,

He also feels that young
people, wishing to be accepted
by their peers, may do and
say things they don’t really
think are right. A girl may be-
come promiscuous to prove
she is womanly; a boy may try
to prove his manliness by ex‘
aggerating his sexual exploits.

Berryhill thinks student!
should realize that “true mas-
culinity and femininity come
from standing up for what one
believes is right even if this
causes the individual to act
contradictory to the group
standards." '

Mr. William Doan

Discusses Film

As Being a Personal Art Form

By John Wolf

"Movie making should be-
come a more personal art
form,” advocated Mr. William
Doan last Wednesday to stu»

dents enrolled in the introduce
tion to fine arts courses. His
lecture was entitled “Film as
Art.”

Doan is a Chicago publisher
and producer, His best known
production is the 1961 semi-
documentary movie ”Good
Night Socrates.”

Doan noted that because of
the complexity of the produc<
tion of a movie, the cinematic
art has necessarily been a co-
operative venture in which the
director surrounds himself with
people who share his views and
who can carry out his ideas.

The personal approach to
movie making is now possible,
Doan said. With cheaper equip-
ment becoming more available
to the public, more people can
now creatively participate in
this art form.

“There are things Holly-
wood can’t do with one mil-
lion dollars that independent
producers can do with five
thousand d o l l a r 5,” said
Donn.

The high overhead involved
in lilming at Hollywood studios
has “made Hollywood fairly
Well defunct. It has lost a good
deal of its audiences to the in
dependent producers,” .

Dean noted that the lack of
I “tradition" in the young film

 

industry has led to a great deal
of experimenting, much of
which is poor. This lack of a
film tradition will help make
movie making become a more
personal art form if film mak-
ers take the responsibility to
destroy abortive attempts.

“The movie is becoming
more important as an art
form because the cinema au-
dience is becoming sophisti-
cated enough to accept de-
vices such as the use of mon-
tage, symbols, and several
simultanqu kinds of time.

“The audience is also more

able to accept the philosophical
interpretations; other medians
have not developed this type of

audience.”

Behind The 8-Ball

nist lor the TORCH, Witten-
berg University, Springfield,
Ohio, has discovered the versa-
tility of an 8-ball full of an-
swers. You justshake the ball
and turn it upside down for an
answer to any question.

Just to make sure. she asked
ﬂ‘le same question three times.
For instance. “Will the twist

“Yes.” “My sources say no."
"Yes, definitely.” And the
question “Will certain rumors

"Outlook not so good. “Yes.”

Get Away

(ACP) »— THE CHINOOK,
Casper College, Casper, Wy-
oming, conducted an informal
campus survey concerning the
cafeteria and came up with
many more compliments than
complaints.

The most frequent reply to
interviewers was a fear that
the survey somehow would
mean that. things would change
and second helpings would be
eliminated.

Graduate Returns
From Fifth Year

By Nancy McCannon

“‘1 never felt so useful in my
life," said Ron Dorr of his fifth
year teaching experience in
Bogota, Columbia. “I did my
most creative war ."

Dorr taught American His-
tory, American Literature, and
English at Colequio Mayor de
Cultura Femenina de Cundina-
marca, a three year girls trai
ing Sdhool for bi-lingual secre-
taries or translators.

Dorr’s reasons for going to
Bogota were: to understand
and sympathize with the people,
to lose his intellectual and geo-
graphical provincialism, and to
confront himself with greater
moral and physical suffering
than he had ever seen before.
Dorr felt he accomplished his
goals.

“I tried to become a part of
the student life, I participated
in their activities both con-
nected with the school and out-
side of it, but I couldn’t have
done it without the student’s
complete and openhearted ac-
ceptance of me,” Dorr said.
One time Dorr was arrested
in a student demonstration. “I
thought their cause was just,”
he explained.

Dorr plans to return to Co-
lumbia within a year. His ad-
vice for others who intend to
go abroad is, “Learn the lan»
guage. Learning a people’s lan-
guage is the first sign of re-
spect."

Give Legal View
Of Civil Rights

By Phil Bernstein

In a coffee hour held Wednes-
day in Yollnker Lounge, Profes-
sor W, Bonfield of the Univer—
sity of Iowa Law School spoke
on the Kennedy Civil Rights
bill as Viewed by a constitution-
e1 lawyer.

Bonfield stated that the bill‘s
passage was imperative not
only from a moral standpoint
but also in the light of the
hatred bred by discrimination
and of the financial and physi-
cal inconvenience which it
causes to all of us.

The Kennedy Bill would
make illegal any racial discrim—
ination by hotels, stores, gas
stations, etc. which are in»
volved in interstate commerce,
It would also ban discrimina-
tion in movie theaters and
other places of entertainment
if either the patrons or source
of entertainment had to cross
state boundaries.

In answer to those who would
still leave anti—discrimination
legislation up to the individual
states, Bonfield replied that
discrimination is, in
effect, a national problem and,
moreover. most state statutes
outlawing it are rarely, if ever,
enforced He pointed out that.
the Kennedy Bill draws its prec-
edent from two sections of the
Constitution —- the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Commerce
Clause.

The more important of these
is the commerce clause, for it
is recognized that discrimina-
tion in the area of public ac-
commodations has a direct and
negative bearing on interstate
commerce. The boycotts of
those fighting for equality have
the same stiﬂing effects as the
strikes of those who strive for
union recognition. That the
latter is now covered by the
National Labor Relations Act
(on the support of the comv
merce clause) gives precedent
to protecting the former under

a bill such as the Kennedy_

Civil Rights Bill.

Eonfield countered the states’
rights argument so often given
by Southerners by saying that
the {act that the Tenth Amend-
ment gives the stats only those
powers not previously dele-
gated to the Federal Govern-
ment is irrelevant here be-
cause the Kennedy Bill draws
its support from delegated
powers.

Take The Blame

nist for STUDENT LIFE, Utah
State University, Logan, has
this excuse:

“If you are expecting to

one still has to deal with the
fact of an ancient culture, dat-
ing, as an independent kingdom
in this geographical area, With
interruptions, fr 0 m approxi-
mately the thirteenth century,
which has produced, on its own
terms, great art in dancing,
poetry, sculpture, and archi
tecture, which has been and is
the home of one of the most
profound philosophies of human
history, and such “visible"
greatnesses apart, a culture
which has developed itself into
an identity visea-vis 'customs,
mores, attitudes, etc., every
bit as real and legitimate, and
a good deal older, than Ameri-
can society — one still has to
deal with this culture in con-
tact witih, for example, Elvis

shows are devoted to his sing-
ing, students buy pocket books
that have the lyrics to his
songs, his picture appears on
shopping bags, his styles of
clothes and his haircut are
aped, and his movies are
mobbed.

But Elvis is only one ex-

Klein Describes Benefits
For Fifth Year Students

By Suzanne Gelber

Naming the “grain of per-
spective personally and pro-
fessionally” as a major bene-
fit of the Fifth Year Aboard
program, returned ~Travel-Ser»
vice scholars spent last Wed-
nesday to Friday detailing
their experiences.

Phil Klein, who taught at
Sacred Heart School in Con-
cepcion, Chile, contrasted his

. life wiﬂi that of Steve Hoth and

. Dorothy (Smardak) Palmer in
the bush country of Nyasa-
land.

Now a member of the Peace
Corps, Klein plans to return to
South America before heading
ior graduate school and work
in Latin American studies.
Baseball, typing, and teaching
English language classes cov-
er just a few of his activities at
Sacred Heart School. An urban
school, the Cathollc academy
served junior and senior high
boys and with an “excellently
prepared” faculty of ”dedie
Gated” secular and religious
teachers.

Klein’s duties centered about
instruction in English conver-
sation and idioms, but extend-
ed to optional English classes
for interested students and ac-
tive social_ participation in the
lives of the three student fame
ilies with whom he boarded.

First a “curiosity,” then 'a
friend to his students, Klein
commented on the problem
of maintaining classroom
discipline in the informal at-
mosphere which he tried‘to
establish.

Departing from academic
formality, Chilean soclal life
rated a description of “liberal“
from Phil as he noted its ten-
dency toward large parties,
rather than dates in the Ameri—
can sense. In his middle class
environment, Phil observed a
“critical respect" for the Unit-
cd States among Chilean SIUv
dents, many of whom wish to
complete their higher educa-
tion in this country. Lack of li-
brary and study facilities ham-

lpers the Chilean student in his
academic life.

Though Chile has seven unl-
versities which are tuition free,
Klein explained that only
wealthy students can afford to
attend because only they can
forego the advantages of a
salaried job in order to study.

Kleln assessed Chile as "less
Hispanic than other South
Am eri c a l1 countries" and
stressed the influence of heavy
German and English immigra»
tion on Chile. Fatalism char-
acterizes the attitude Of the
Chilean peasants for whom
there is “a lot of hard work
and little hope,” Neverthe-
less,” Slated Phil, “Chilean
citizens display a sensible na-
tionalism, even in closed com-
munities."

The Travel scholar noted
that the position of an Ameri-
can in such a community is at
once "unique and ambiguous"
because of the cohesiveness of
Chilean communities.

"Can this be real?” thought
Steve Hoth and Dorothy (Smar-
dak) Palmer upon landing in
Nyasaland to teach in the bush
at Malosa School. A govern-
ment supported mission school,
Malosa ranks as one of seven
secondary schools in Nyasa-
land, a country with three mil-
lion inhabitants. Acclilnating
themselves to a pace of life far

Steve found the Nyasa culture
a "strange mixture of tribal
African and European.”

To gain independence on
January 1, 1964, Nyasaland,
now under BritisthfrIcan
rule, will be renamed

Malawi. Education of the
“new Nyasalanders” who
will grow up to “lead their
country and their people"
fell in part to the hands of
Hoth and Mrs. Palmer. Sub-
jects taught by the two range
from history, agriculture.
biology, gym, and English to
French and current affairs,
following the Cambridge syl-
labus.

Poor transportation inter-
rupts national communication,
but the tiny country is on the
road to unity, claiming a na-
tional language, trained volitiv
cal leaders, and a greatly ex-
panded educational system. Lon
cated in the populous southern
portion of Nyasaland, Malosa
School attracts a widely vary»
ing, coeducational
body.

Mrs. Palmer, who was mar-
ried at lVlalOsa, noted that
teachlng English as a foreign
language can be difficult, and
that teaching loreign language
in general required a great
deal of knowledge of the gram-
matic basis of each language.

Seen as American teachers
by the Nyasalanders, the Grin-
nell grads found it hard to be-
come culturally integrated, to
"cross the line that divides”.

Neither scarce teaching ma-

Hoth and Mrs. Palmer from

Swimmers Travel lo Knox Relays Tomorrow

By Jack Harrod

The 1963-64 edition of Grin-
nell’s swimming team opens its
long season tomorrow at Gales
burg, lllinois, in the annual
Knox College Relays. The tank-
ei-s' twelverman squad will
iield relay teams in all nine
events plus a Woman entry
in diving. This meet promises
to be a good preview of Mid-
West Conference strength this
season since all but two MCAC
members Will be entered as
Well as IllinOlS' Augustana Col-
lege and Bradley University.

St. Olaf and league title far
vorite Carleton will participate
instead in the Minnesota Time
Trials.

Following the Knox Relays
the Pioneer swimmers go
against a powerful Cornell
squad at Mount Vernon on De
cember 11 in the first dual
meet of the campaign.

Coach Irwin Simone tabs
this season as a rebuilding
year. The twelve-man team
is a numerical improvement
over last year's squad but Si»
mone will still be hard
pressed to fill the 24 spots
necessary for a dual meet.
Added to this is the fact that
many of this year’s crew, al-
though promising, lack exper-
ience. Therefore, Simone
IOI'esees a Pioneer finish of

 

no higher than fourth place.
But since all members of this

season's team will return next

year, along with several good

.freshmen, the future holds in

store a good possibility of a re
turn to the llrsl~rate Grinnell
swmiming teams of the past
lew years. ’

When asked to Comment on
the conference race, for this

season, Coach Simone replied
"We're in much better shape
than last yearibut so is the
entire conference. I look for
Carleton and Beloit to have the
strength to sit on top this time.
Lawrence is coming out of the
woods and should place third.
We Will be lucky to come off

By Len Calodney

In examining the possibility of putting face masks on the IM
football helmets, we may now consider the problem from three
aspects: 1) how other schools have solved the problem, 2) what
illie coaches. medical personnel and insurance agents for the
college think about the suggestion, and a) how much it would
cost.

The simplest way to prevent intramural football injuries is to
not play the sport. This may have been the reason why Knox
never started football, but began their volleyball season in the
fall. The school may also have felt that in this way they woud be
more likely to get all those of varsity caliber out for football.
Princeton, on the other hand, has gone one step farther and out~
fitted lM players with shoulder pads as well as helmets. This
much equipment, besides being expensive, might make the game
a bit too rough for Grinnell's bloodo

Football coach Edd Bowers is against the suggestion. He fears
that the addition of a face guard will give the IM player more
confidence for a head on charge, and Uhereby making the helmet
more of a weapon. He feels (shat if the problem is not with
broken noses or knocked-out teeth, the face guard probably
won’t help too much, even though it would ward off a direct blow.

John Pfitsch (Athletic Director) suggests that we should con-
centrate on injuries over all rather than in one specific area, and
would rather see teaching and coaching used as a means to pre-
vent iniury, Noting that football is the best part of the IM pro-
gram, Pfitsch says it teaches many boys who never played a
Contact sport in high school what it means. Pfitsch added that he
would like to see the IM chairmen come to the athletic staff for
help in running their teams, or for a clinic to be held for 1M
coaches.

As the one who is the ﬁrst to treat those fallen in battle, Mrs.
Irma Hall (Head Nurse) favors the move, She said she would
support anything to help ieduce the number or injuries.

John C. Truesdale (Physical Education) has quoted the cost of
a single bar guard at $2. 25 Therefore the total cost for the 75
to 90 helmets would be about $150 200 Since the helmets now
used are varsity castoffs, they have holes for face guard instal-
lation already drilled, so that additional work would not be
necessary.

Obviously the athletic department would not be able to budget
this much in one year for the purchase of a sulricient number of
face guards. However, the Insurance Company of North Amer-
ica, which handles Grinnell’s insurance business might be Willing
to help conduct an experiment here to see if face guards would
have some effect on injury rate,

Fred P. Ramsey (Ramsey Insurance Agency) mentioned that
the North American company had donated to Grinnell’s Ford
Foundation matching fund, but didn‘t know whether the company
would be Willing to sponsor this proposed experiment, Since this
company is paying $100 a year for head injuries at Grinneii, and
even though this figure means virtually nothing to the organiza-

tion in comparison to its total volume of business, could we iri-~

terest the company in donating the equally miniscuie sum or $50,
enough for face guards on two strings of helmets?

Bardole: liberia Changing, Full of Contrasts

Liberia is a changing nation full of contrasts,
'ome violent, some strange, and always exciting. In
the capital, Monrovia, you can see the Ducor Palace,
which ranks with the best international hotels, and
ﬁle new presidential mansion, surely as beautiful
and modern as any executive mansion in the world.
But only a few blocks away is a residential area
where the crowded homes are mud huts with
thatched roofs, »

In the streets of Monrovia one can see the big
American cars and the small European cars moving
quickly past women balancing their baskets on their
heads, and as you travel uprcountry, the large
trucks roar by natives carrying heavy logs on their
heads, or buckets of latex rubber hanging from
yokes,

As one moves from the city to the hinterlands,
.nything that is common to the Western World is in
'harp contrast to the native customs,

Here on Cuttlngton campus the girls walking
to class in heels and in Western clothes pass
native women barefooted, wearing only a lappa,
and perhaps with a baby bound to her back.
.When the soccer team, which is as fine as those
In many American schools, wait in the locker
room before a game, their pro-game preparation
Is not a speech by the coach to “psych out“ his
players; but rather the application of “bush
medicine" to the game ball. This is “plenty
strong medicine" and will help them win the
game.

My houseboy is most interested in‘getting a pair
of long pants from America, but at the time of the
devil moon, he must finish work so that he can be
home before dark - otherwise the “black boys"
will get him and carry him off to the bush as human
sacrifice for the Leopard Society. These boys live in
'constant fear of this society, now outlawed, though
by no means nonexistent, It is strange to hear an
albhfrican congregation singing traditional Chris-
tian hymns, and at the same time watch others
whose belief is in the bush devil and his occult pow-
ers. One of the important accomplishments of the
missionaries has been to erase the many fears that
surround these people in practicing their pagan
faiths.

There is a great deal of criticism of the Liberian
government, Upon my arrival I was told of all the
corruption found in all branches. After a full day of
red tape at immigration which cost me $25 for the
"correct” visa, I was in full agreement with all that
I had heard. Now after a closer examination of the

circumstances, I think my judgment was too harsh.

While Liberia has been a free country for 116
years, it was only 20 years ago that it could really
start its growth. The first century was spent iight<
ing the warlike coastal tribes. Then it was the
French and English colonialists who threatened to
take her lands, pressing over Liberia’s boundaries,
shrinking the original size of the country by over
one-third,

If We probe the early history of the United
States, we find that before controls were estab-
lished, corruption was every bit as bad as that
found in Liberia today. It must be realized that
Liberia has never had the advantages of imper<
ialism. All of her neighbors have enjoyed help
from other countries in establishing a relatively
stable and advanced government. Liberia has
had no help. Only hindrance!

What about industry that is so important to a
country's economy? Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and
omer neighbors have all had help for fifty years or
more. Liberia has had to try to establish her own
industry, but it takes money to start, and there are
industrial revolutions that must be dealt with, The
industrial changes that took one hundred years in
the United States are taking only about twenty in
Liberia: Is there any wonder that there are prob-
lems? Edmund Burke would turn over in his grave.

The answer to Liberia's problem is the same as
it was in the United States -— education. But there
are problems in bringing the Liberians education
because their culture is so different from ours, and
because ”my already have an educational system
called the bush school. A tribal endeavor, often of
four year’s duration, that is offered in great secrecy
and designed to make the youngster a weliradjusted
member of the tribe.

The Western style grade school run by the
government is available through high school,
but actually in many villages it doesn’t extend
beyond fifth or sixth grade, Other than in Mons
rovia and a few large towns, all other education
is obtained in church mission schools. The grade
school offers little more than literacy education;
still this puts the school boys in a position far
above the masses of the people. Although they
feel themselves too good to do manual labor,
still they are really not qualified to hold any
other position. More education is needed, but
how should we give it to them, or can we give it
to them?

As the white man brings his schools, he will not

allow many practices of the bush schools, some-
times called “devil bush,” to continue. The whit.
man does not understand the importance of the bush
school, and after he destroys it, he offers nothing
to replace it. True, we teach reading and writing.
but very little about living in a culture, especially
the Liberian bush culture where most of these Stu-
dents will spend a large part of their lives.

0n the other hand, the bush school, PORO
for boys and SANDE roi- girls, educates th-
child how to live in his culture. For instance
there is a thorough sex education that far sur-
passes that offered by most Western societies. It
has been found in many areas of Africa that the
rate of illegitimate births is much higher among
the youth who have had no bush training.

If someone wishes to govern a people, how bet-
ter can he understand them than by having a similar
education? If Liberians are going to communicate
and trade with the world, however, they must also
have a western education. The white man will never
be an entirely successful educator of the Liberian,
He cannot understand their culture. We can only
send our best educators to educate the Liberian edu-
cators who can then relate the best we have to offer
to the best of their own culture.

It may be difficult for the tribal people to learn
Western ways and to think in Western modes of
thought, but it is impossible for the Western man to
gain a full enough insight into the Liberian culture
so that the educators can identify with the Liberian
culture, The Liberian culture is beyond the white
man’s reach mostly because the people will not com-
municate their culture willingly.

Cuttington students strive in every way to be
non-tribal. The dressy clothes that they wear to class
separates them from the tribal people. The men
wouldn’t think of going out to play soccer without
a shirt. Nudity/is associated with tribal life. Menial
labor is also avoided at all costs. The freshmen re-
fuse to wash their oWn glassware in the chemistry
lab. This is a job for a l‘small boy." A recent
“hardtimes dance” was a failure, Girls attended in
heels, and the fellows in ties, Wearing clothes that
might indicate hard times was not novel to them —
only a few years ago it was probably a reality!
