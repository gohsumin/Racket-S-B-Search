Mrs. Goodbroil Takes Administrative
Post to Work with Tradition, Rules

By Nancy Gromko

-“The sole function of the new-
ly created Quadrangle Office
is to answer questions which
bear upon tradition and college
rule," states Mrs. Harriet
Goodbrod, assistant dean of wa-
men.

“Due to the increase in col-
lege growth, the administra-
tion felt a need for an office
devoted to Quadrangle interests
alone,” the assistant dean
stated. "This Will leave Dean
Slocum free to concentrate on
counseling and far-range plan-
ning.”

The new office, concerned
with routine aflairs, serves to
relate regulations and respon-
sibilities to the individual girl.
“Our purpose,” Mrsr Good-
brod continued, “is to help the
Grinnell women conform to the
established pattern of college
life.”

“Any institution which ac-
cepts money for the care of an
individual,” she explained,
“must know at all times where
the individual‘is. Thus one of
our biggest responsibilities is
to regulate the daily checking
in and out of students.”

This ‘»”co-ordinating office"
works closely with the quad so»
cial chairman to plan activities
for girls, such as houseparties
and divhy‘rambs.

Mrs. Goodbrod, a graduate of

 

the University of Nebraska, has

MRS. GOODBROD

been teaching in the education
department at Grinnell since
1960. For the past three years
she has supervised student
teachers in elementary educa-
tion.

Asked her reaction to the cur-
rent effectiveness of the new
office, Mrs. Goodbrod replied,
“What has impressed me most
is how long there must have
been a need for such an of-
fice.”

Mrs. Ravitts and Mrs. Main,
housemothers of Mears and
Main, will also be assuming re-
sponsibilities in the new Quad-
rangle office.

With the national election
campaign drawing to a close,
members of the Grinnell col-
lege community had a chance
to register their preferences in
a “mock election” held Tues-
clay. The Johnson - Humphrey
ticket carried nearly 64 per
cent of the student vote; with
30 per cent going for Goldwat-
er and Miller. Writerin Votes
tabulated 5‘2 per cent.

Students cast 592 votes for
the Democrats and 276 votes
for the Republicans. The 48
writerin votes were predomi-
nately for “Peace" candidate
Herbert F. Hoover, an Oska-
loosa area farmer who has
unsuccessfully sought office in
the past. over 82 per cent of
the student body voted in the
election.

The Democratic team was

 

extremely popular with the
women students, receiving a
3167111 majority while the men
went for L. B. J. and H. 1-1. H.
273—164. Johnson carried all
four classes by at least 60 per
cent. The vote by classes was:

Freshmen: Johnson, 183;
Goldwater no ,

Sophomore: Johnson, 154;
Goldwater 71

Junior: Johnson, 125; Gold-
water, 43

Senior: Johnson,.121; Gold-
water, 51

The faculty and administra<
tive staff piled up an even
bigger majority for the Demo-
crats than did the studEnts.

polled their GOP counterparts

scours REPORTERS ..

The Speaker of the Senate made it clear to us this
week that he feels the editor of the Scarlet and Black is
shirking her duties by not. reporting the activities of
Student Government officials. Such an accusation irri—
tates a thorn in our journalistic side that has been pret-
ty well salved for several months by a general aura of
good will and a lack of specific problem. Now the Stu—
dent Government has what it considers a specific prob-
lem—lack of communication with the members of the
student body. And we have again noticed that thorn in
our side—the idea among some on campus that the $813
should be a house organ for SGA.

At the beginning ofrthe semester the President of
the Student Government Association and the Speaker
of the Senate were approached by the S&B and asked
to Write a column on a regular~basis that would pre«
sent the problems and procedures of Student Govern-
ment officials as they went about their business. The
answer, returned by phone several days later, was that
the potential columnists didn't have time to write such
a piece and that it might tend to show that they “were
blowing their own horns." .

In an effort to keep students up on the activities
of SGA, the S&B made multiple inquiries into the Open
House question — contacting SGA officials as well as
administration members. Each time we were told to
wait. We have made similar inquiries into the workings
of the senate and into the various complexities of the
Forum. Each time we hit a dead-end that says — wait
until we are ready to say it. A few brave advances on
our own — the question of student administration co-
operation and the problem of proctors — have been
met by comments froln SGA officials of “why did you
say that now, just when things were going so well?"

It seems that for the 5&3 to be responsible it must
cover SGA. But we will not serve as a house organ that
dishes before the student readers what has been spoon-
fed to us by our leaders at what they consider the most
appropriate time.

To print the news on SGA available to us now
would limit our coverage to an insignificdnt article
about how each member of the executive cabinet
spends nearly 26 hours a week in meetings. Or we
could substitute in the band and blow their horns for
them. We refuse to do either.

When SGA is ready to invite us into their realm
so that we can examine all areas of inquiry and present
at our own discretion what we deem of interest to the
student and Grinnell, then we can function in a “news”
capacity rather than as a propaganda sheet. And when
SGA officials are ready to put themselves bcl'ore the
student body without their usual pomp and circum-
stance they might find the lines of communication
more opcn. LD

Grinnell Graduafefxpresses Concern Over Developments

To the Editor:

1 graducicd from Giinneli
College many years ago. and I
have spent most of my time
busily forgetting yesterdays,
but for some reason I’m finding
renewed interest in Gn‘nnell.
Perhaps it is because my boys
are reaching college age now
I’ve been doing some reading
and talking about the old place.
What I've concluded, I’ve con-
cluded hesitantly. Perhaps the
easiest way to express my con—
cern over the developments
that have taken place or Grin»
hell. I presume gradually,
mlght be to direct my remarks
to one specific, glaring incident.

A letter in last Week‘s “Scar-
la! and Black” by an irate stu-
dent, who painted his room vol-
untarily, spelled out the words
that I could only mouth.

Since time began, elders have
looked down and spoken the
hallowed maxim, “If we did it
for one, we’d have [0 do it for
all,” a statement that has i3
valid expression only before a
mass of a thousand mumbling
and gurgling morons. It seems
that if Grinnell is to continue

 

selling itself as an institution

kept purposely small, with an
Openrminded, relaxed ' atmos-
phere, an understanding faculty
and administration offering per-
sonal attention and guarantee-
ing the freedom of student
query and challenge, it cannot
allow this kind of blind reaction
to become typical.

Repainting a freshly painted
room is needless punishment.
Punishment? Punishment for
what? Aren’t there any other
jobs to be done? What about
painting the unpainted rooms,
the ones that haven’t been
painted since I was at Grinnell’.’

Your students are not
morons. They are basically in-
telligent moral human beings.
ls painting a room such an out
rageous immoral act? Was it
done in defiance? It has been
my experience mat acts of de-
fiance are destructive acts.
Constructive acts are to be en-
couraged, not discouraged. The
student should have been con»
gratulaled, Granted, if his
work is inferior, it must be Cor-
rected, elther by him or by the
school. However, I doubt that
any crew of maintenance men
could improve on the work of

 

Student Questions Validity of
Grading System. Counseling

To the Editor;

Much has been said by Dean
Stauss concerning the respon-
sibility and role of the student
at Grinnell; now, I think the

role and responsibility of the
administration Should be dis—
cussed. I am particularly con-
cerned about the apparent lack
of concern of the administra-
tion in an area most vital to
the student body—the future at»
fer Grinnell.

Two factors are involved—the
present grading system and
the ditch in adequate counsel-
ing about future education: Why
is a system continued that does
not relieve grade pressure but
expands the scale to the dis-
advantage of the student? I ap-
preciate the desire to maintain
high academic standards, but
if lhe student body and the
college has the reputation pur-
ported by the administration.
why isn't a grading system es-
tablished which favors (or, at
least, doesn’t disfavor) the slu»
dent; or is this reputation a
facade?

I recall from my impressions
as a prospective the theme of
capable, knowledgeable coun-
seling. 1 find this strikingly
lacking in graduate school guid-
ancc. Faculty committees, now
responsible for iliis lunciion,
are inudequnie. Sometimes they
are vaguely familiar with the
personality of the siudcnis in-
valved and frcquenlly arc uni,
familiar Willi schools Outsidel
of a limited Iew. If the college‘
can maintain an extensive de-
partment dealing wuh slu-
dents considering entering Grill-
ncll, why isn’t there a dcparb
merit dealing with one of the,

 

most critical concerns of the
majority of students in Grin»
nell?

I feel the students’ supposed
indifference about Grinnell’s
future is almost matched by
the administration's apparent
indifference about the future of
Grinnell students.

a student who has shown so
much interest, concern, and in—
itiative that he paints his own

imagine the caliber of improve

their disinterested efficiency;
light SWltches obscured, floors
speckled and dotted, and paint
splashed over edges, work that
would disgrace a child with a
crayon.

The school could save thous-
ands, simply by letting and en—
couraging any and all students
to paint their rooms. The same
people who seem to have such
an overbearing, parental atti-
tude could easily find time to

With this generation of stu-

’Sludenl Apathy ls
Maior Obstacle lo
Functioning of SGA’

“A Youthful Upperclassman"!
I read with interest your pm-
posal for the future of Student
Government at Grinnellf How-
ever, it did not seem that you
described any new or different
function for the leaders of Stu-
dent Government. For as long
as I have been at Grinneil, the
Student Government has been
expected to "clean up" after
the irresponsible minority. We
have expected ou r elected
leaders to convince the Admin-
istration that we are mature
and responsible enough to be
granted the privileges which
we demand. We say, “We need
more freedom” and While Stu-
dent Government is trying to
achieve this end, we abuse the
freedom we already have.

if the energies of student
leaders were channeled as you
have proposed, they would only
be doing in a literal sense what
they have been doing all along
in a figurative sense. We can
not, in either case, expect a
handful of student leaders to
clean up the mess resulting
from the irresponsibility or the
whole student body.

You have stated that the leg
islative power of the Student
Government has been usurped
by the Administration. I do not
believe this is so. In fact. it is
we, ourselves, who have
usurped this power. I do not be-
lieve that the Administration is
now, or ever will be. closed to
responsible and constructive
student legislation,

If We Wish Student Govern-
ment to ever funClJOn as it was
originally conceived, we must
first remove its biggesl ob-
Stacie, not the Administration,
but student apathy and li'l'E~
sponsibility. Let each clean up
his own “Saturday night's ref-
use, thus saving lhe hall exor-
bilanl 5&6 assessments.”

Taylor Wants Senate to ‘Retire';
feels It Is No Longer Necessary

The Student Senate has called
for its own death In its aug-
ust life of four years, it has
occupied well over 2000 man
hours a year in meetings alone
(plus all the other bunc that
Went on behind the scenes). it
has proved that no matter how
wonderful a representative leg-
islative body may seem in po-
litical theory, it is not only in-
efficient, but also entirely un-
necessary on this particular
college campus.

Let us be realistic. Grinnell
College is in the business of
educating, Grinnell students
are in the business of learn-
ing. But Grinnell College is not
In the business of providing
an outlet for pseudo—political
activities.

I do believe, however—after
too many years of experience
with this octopodal monster—
that student government has a
function on this campus—an
important function.

Those members of the col-
lege community who have
worked on it seem in agree—
ment, as am I, that student
government has two function
to carry out those responsibl »
ities assigned to the students
by the college, and to consult
with officials of the college
when student opinion is de-

, sired, _

If one must use political
theory. or its jargon, the Grin-
nell student body is not sov-
ereign, Thus it does not pos-
sess sovereign power. We, as
students, have volunteered for,
and are assigned certain rer
sponsibilities by the college. It
is the function of student gov»
ernment to carry them out.

These are properly the du»
ties of house presidents and
their assistants, and of the ap~
pointed committees,

Student leaders then, are stu-
dents who are willing to im-
plement these functions, to do
the nasty chores and go in the
meetings, in return for the
benefits of friendship and per-
sonal satisfaction which these
positions offer.

Getting back to the Student
Senate, let us be realistic again.
It's a big hunk of extra bag»
gage; it's bogging the monster
down. The following, with very

 

little exaggeration
goes on now.

I-Iall elects two senators, For-
ty senators elect speaker. Sen-
ate meets. Executive Cabinet,
aws Board, Coil-11> present
proposals for Senate to rubber
stamp. House council already
knows through house president.
Rest of hall is not at house
meeting, doesn’t care, or
doesn’t know who hall senator
is

is what

And, neally, how could any-
one consult with a body such
as this?

The situation varies, of
course, from hall to hall, but
the point is that the house
presidents and the executive
cabinet have actually worked
out everything the Senate has
passed for four years. It’s used
all that time and energy doing
nothing—except getting in ev-
eryone else’s way.

No one is trying to usurp its
power—just to get a job done.
There's no power to usurp.

I submit that we should po-
litely kill the Student Senate
and bury it with all the due
pomp and circumstance it has
lived among.

Let the AWS and the CDIHP
legislate in the first place. Then
they would only have to do it
once. Let them consult with
the administration. They ac-
tually know what is going on.
They would be much more ef-
fective. Let them have the trust
they deserve,

There need be no separation
of powers in a system that has
no sovereignty. We need a
workable, efficient system to
do a lot of chores—not A model
of the federal system. _

Since we expend so much
time and energy doing practi-
cally nothing except chores
anyway, let us rid ourselves
of this part of the monster, and
allow those students who will
take on our responsibilities the
freedom of an efficient system
in which to work.

Let us realize, also, that we
are students: Let's free our-
selves of useless meetings. .
and spend our time with books.

Shades Of Gray—w
Once Upon a Time. .

A True

By Carl Otis Gray

In years to come when I am
very old and my little brown
skinned children come and sit
upon my knees and ask for the
honest facts about black and
white, I shall sign and recount
for them amazing facts about
how they got to be what they
are. I shall tell them the fol-
lowing story about their Dad-
dy.

Once upon a time when I was
young and still in college, I
met a Black Muslims At mat
time I was young and idealis-
tic and I stopped to set this
gentleman straight about the
hats of life,

“Sir,” said 1, giving due re»
spect to his age, ”don’t you
realize that you are using ex-
tremist tactics by peddling this
hate mongering propaganda?”

“Man, you have been brain
washed by those so - called
White liberals" was his courte-
ous reply.

"Your position is just as had
as that of the Ku Klux Klan,"
I reminded him.

“Yes, man you have been
brain washed,” he continued.

”You know of course, that
all leading anthropologists re—
fute any concept of racial su-
periority," Again, I had to rev
fresh his memory.

“Tell me what good has the
white man done in this world?”

”Well, really, that‘s a fairly
obvious question to answer.
Look around you. Most of the
conveniences of the modern
world do happen to be a pro
duct of Western civilization,
which of course has most of
its heritage in the course of
European and Middle Eastern
development."

“Oh really?" he seemed in-
terested now.

“Yes. and you see as Ameri-
cans we necessarily are heirs
to this heritage . . ."

“As Americans?"

“Yes, as Americans," I had
to be patient with him, ”You
see the fourteenah and fifteenth
amendments say . . ."

”The fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments to what?”:he was
relatively dense,

“The American Constitution.
Plus there is this new Civil
Rights Bill that proves without
a doubt . . .”

“Wait a moment,” he inter-
rupted, “what are you a citizen
of?"

“America, the United States.
U.S.A.”

"What is your n ative
tongue?” he asked,

“English."

“Ho; ho!” he thought he had
me, “were your parents Eng-
Iish?"

“No. they were American."

“But they speak English . .

”In America we speak Enge
lish." 1 was impatient.

“We speak English," he
mused as if it were a new
thought. “But your skin is dark;
why don’t you speak Ibo or
Yoruba?”

“Because I’m an American,
Stupid,"

"But your skin is dark. You

 

Story

say you’re an American." He
acted as if the combination was
new to him. ‘ '

“Yes, yes, I’m a Negro Amer-
loan, a Negro American," I
repeatEd,

Suddenly there came the
light ; his face beamed, ”Man,
you‘re not a Negro or an
American, you’re a psuedo Af-
rican!" He seemed so sure.

Well! Never had anything .

come to me as such a shock.
He meant to tell me that my
parents had hidden this great
scar from me for so long. That
in reality my identity was
false, that I was laboring un-
der [these delusions of gram
deur this I couldn’t, I
wouldn't accept this. I knew
precisely who I was and what
it meant. The nerve of the idiot.
I dismissed him.
>.< e a

Surely when I am old I shall
look back on this incident and
chuckle through my long white
beard and my sunglasses, as I
tell my children about their
heritage. By that time I’m sure
the word psuedo will be out of
the American vocabulary so
that they won’t understand its
significance.

Sir Denis and lady Brogan Enio y
Grinnell's firearm], Relaxed Tone

 

By Susan Taylor

“My wife and 1 are only four-
teen hundred years apart,” Sir
Denis Brogan observed as we

: sat around his office. His wry
humor was showing again, but
he was altogether serious, tool
Both he and his wife have writ-
ten books on France; hers end-
ing in the fifth century; and his,
during th e Third Republic
(1870-1940).

Sir and Lady Brogan are both
visiting professors at Grinnell
this semester. Sir Denis holds
the Rosenneld professorship in
American studies, and he is
teaching a senior seminar.
Lady Brogan teaches two his—
tory classes: ancient civiliza-
tion and archaeology.

It is, then, their academic in-
terests that are fourteen hun-
dred years apart. Their fresh
outlook and charm are very
contemporary

Though they normally reside
in Cambridge, Where Sir Denis
is a member of the faculty of
Peterhouse, a college of about
two hundred students, they
travel to the geographic area
of their main interests each
year. Lady Brogan goes to the
Mediterranean area for a cou-
ple of months, while Sir Denis
comes to America. “We have a

SIR DENIS

 

rendezvous in England from
time to time,” he said.

This is the ﬁrst time they
have spent an extended period
at a small American college.
The C o n pl e find Grinnell
“cheerful and ‘iriendly," but
they said that it is too early in
the year to know enough about
Grinnell students. I asked if
they had heard any rumors
about “North Campus.” Sir
Denis said that he has sensed
a concern, but does not really
know much about the problem.
He said lie would ask some s'tlL
dents what was going on.

They like the relaxed atmos-
phere on campus. “You don‘t
seem to be hurried and fussed
and to think only of your
marks." Lady Brogan said, She
explained that at Grinnell there
doesn't seem to be the competi-
tion to get in things and to do
things that she had observed at
larger American universities.
They were also glad to note
that “nobody had heart failure
at football games.”

While at Grinnell, Sir Denis,
a correspondent of long stand-
ing, is doing some articles for
the London Observer. He re-
cently completed an article on
Cole Porter for the Cambridge
Review. Always busy at his

 

portable typewriter, Sir Denis
is revising his big book on
France, which he wrote in 1940.
“I haven’t read it in twenty-
four years,” he said. “it’s Very
interesting.” The new edition
will be entitled ”The Develop—
ment of Modern France,” and
will be issued in the spring.

In addition to their busy aca~
demic life, the Brogans find
time to enjoy both the college
community and the town of
Grinnell. “We enjoy being able
to walk where we want to go,”
Lady Brogan said. i‘In Cam-
bridge I get around on a bi-
cycle. Here I do all my shop
ping on my two feet." Mrs.
Brogan enjoys the grocery
store in town as much as she
does the college. a professor
told me. She shops at one of
the large supermarkets, but
asked whether it might be un-
fair to print its name.

She smiled as she said that
they enjoy the “lovely rows of
trees and little russet squir<
rels.” Lady Brogan explained
that they have never seen rus-
set squirrels beforesonly grey
ones.

Sadly, Grinnell will have to
bid farewell to (this charming

Sit and Lady Brogan study a road atlas in their home here in Grinnell, They

couple before Christmas vaca-
tion. “1 have to be home to
cook Christmas dinner,” Lady
Brogan told one of her class-
es. Sir Denis explained that the
English have caught on to the
American custom of turkey din-
ner for Christmas. They have
quite a turkey business. He
told me that just before the
holiday season there is a great
deal of hijacking of turkeys, es—
pecialiy around London. “It’s
the nearest thing we have to a
wild west,” he said bemused,
“except, of course, train rob-
beries.”

I asked Lady Brogan just
'what she teaches an archaeo-
logy claSs in the middle of
Iowa. “1 tell them about inter-
esting archaeological sights in
the Mediterranean,” she said.
Her first trip to Lybia, where
she has done a great deal of
work, was in 1948, when she
was among the first group of
British archaeologists allowed
in North Africa after World
War 11.

Though he is mainly known
as a historian and so regards
himself. Sir Denis now devotes
considerable time to surveying
contemporary life in Great
Britain, France, and the United
States. Though he is perhaps
more in touch with U. S. here
in Grinnell, I wondered if he
felt less in touch with the world
here than in London. He admit-
ted that this was the case, but
said that as far as news is con-
cerned, one is better off in
Grinnell than in North Afric

When Lady Brogan is _
Noﬂh Africa, she is sometimes
several days away from the
news. She explained that she
only learned of the assassina-
tian of President Kennedy the
following day beCause she
chanced to meet a man who
knew of it.

Sir Denis told of his exper-
ience in England in connec-

 

* ‘k *

(ion with the Kennedy assassi-
nation. He was at the London
airport when he received a
call to report immediately to
a Television Company. The
President died while he was
en route downtown. Brogan
went on the air that night with
a commentary.

He explained that, much to
its continued embarrassment,
BBC was the only network in
the world which played situa-
tion comedies for some time
after the President’s death.
This happened because all the
top men were at a party and
nobody was available with the
authority to change the pro-
gramming,

Sir Denis Brogan was also
featured in a BBC commen-
tary the next day. “1 said about
the same thing both times,” he
told me, "but,” he laughed, "1
got paid twice for it.”

I concluded then that he was
EEC's “expert on American af-
fairs.” Sir Denis smiled and
said “My son does more of
that."

“Why, Denis, you are!" his
wife corrected.

“X‘m paid for it," he replied
modestly, and smiled.

There is a majority of women
in the American studies semi-
nar which he teaches, so I
asked how he liked teaching
them. Sir Denis said that wom-
en in the classroom don’t both»
er him; indeed, one might think
he rather enjoys it. He feels
strongly that women should go
to college, and explained that
though it is harder for them to
get in most colleges at. Cam-
bridge, the university is about
one-sixth female. Oxford draws

about onerfourth of its students

from the fairer sex.

Last week when the seminar
met, Sir Brogan made a plea
that the male students, in parti-
cular, come to see him regard-
ing paper topics. He said that
since he got his office, he has

 

* ‘k *

had many female callers, but
no men. Perhaps this is a com-
ment on the Grinnell social sit-
nation

The Brogans are getting to
know more students as the
semester progresses. They en-

joyed the color of the Home-
coming weekend and comment-
ed particularly aboth the floats
and the ingenuity of them. They
even attended the football
game, which they also enjoyed
——especially since the right
team won.

Both visiting professors are
furthering their contact with
students at weekly dinner meet-
ings with'small groups of stu-
dents
room.

If you chance to meet a white
haired gentleman with a rud—
dy complexion, and probably a
red shirt or vest, accompanied
by his most charming wife, rest
assured that this time the in-
vading red»coats are welcome
and friendly. Take a few min-
utes to get to know them. You’ll
be glad you did.

Beloii Wins Game;
leam's Hope Gone

, By Pete ,Kollnian

A Fired-up crew of Beloit Burk
cancers dispelled the Pioneers
hopes of a Midwest Conference
Championshipbydefeat—
ing Griiinell, 2444 at Beloit last
Saturday. The Buccaneers don-i-
inated the game from the start,
piling up a 17-0 half-time lead
and coasting to their 4th victory
in 5 starts. The Pioneers are
now 372.

The game started well for
Grinnell, the Pioneers intercept-
ing a stray Buccaneer aerial
and movmg to the Beloit in.
But at this point, the attack
stalled and Beloit moved the
length of the field to go ahead,
adding a field goal later in the
first quarter to lead 9-0.

After the half, Dave Synhotst,
Grinnell halfback, put the Pio-
neers briefly back into conten-
tion with a touchdown punt re-
turn covering 46 yards; but Bel-
oiL tallied again to put the
game on ice. The final Pioneer
score came on an ll yard Bar-
ry Anderson to Elston Bowers
pass late in the final period.

The ferocious ground defense
of Beloit, which had plagued
many a midwest conference op-
ponent, was instrumental in the
Victory. The Pioneers could
only net 15 yards on the ground,
and 34 via the air; and 5 first
downs, Beloit gained 132 yards
both on the ground alld‘t‘hrcugh
the air and managed ll flrsl
downs.

Pioneer Soccer Team
Defeats Carleton, 6-2

Vince Anku s record tying per—
formance led the Grinnell soc-
cei team to a 6-2 victory over
Carleton last Friday Anku
scored all six Grinnell goals to
tie his own record that he set
against Northern Illinois The
game was marred by seven
penalty kicks that produced five
goals. Anku converted on three
of five Grinnell penalty kicks
and Carleton scored its only
two goals on two penalty kicks.

The action started fast after
a twenty minute delay of the
game waiting for the referees.
.Vince Anku scored the first
goal on a penalty kick with less
than a minute gone in the game.
And before the quarter was half
over there were three more
goals scored on penalty kicks,
two by Anku and one by Carle-
ton. Late in the quarter Anku
took a beautiful pass from Ted
Cole and scored his fourth goal.

Anku scored on one of the
prettiest plays of the year in
the second quarter. Ted Cole
took a pass and deflected it
With his head to Anku who
raced past the Carleton defend-
ers for his fifth goal. Later
Vince was tripped by a Carle-
ton defender and was awarded
a penalty kick, but he missed
it.

The second half became a
tough defensive battle with very
few scoring opportunities. An—
ku misseda apenal ty kick and
Carleton made one in the third
quarter. Anku scoied his rec-
ord- t-ying sixth goal in the
fourth quarter with a shot into
the cornei of the net

Two years ago in their football preview, Sports
Illustrated referred to the Midwest Conference as frat-
racidal, inferring, among other things, that only an ig-
noramus would attempt any predictions on the games
or the run for the championship. The race has now
begun‘ to take shape, however, and realizing still the
dangers of prognostica’tion I would like to discuss the
final three weeks of the football season.

With the season heading into the home stretch,
there are still six teams with a mathematical chance
for the title and four with a good shot at it. Ripon,
Cornell, Coe, Beloit, St. Olaf and Grinnell are the teams
mathematically contending, and the first four schools
are very much in the thick of it with Ripon still un-
beaten and the other three once-beaten.

This weekend should be a decisive one, as the
front-running six meet each other in three games which
will either completely muddle the race or eliminate
some of the contenders. The three games involve St.
Olaf at Ripon, Beloit at Cornell and Coe at Grinnell.
This Writer sees the Coe-Grinnell game as a toss-up,
and Cornell and Ripon as winners, Although Coe has
a more impressive record, the Pioneers still remember
that 52-0 debacle at Cedar Rapids last year, and Grin-
nell has the home field advantage. If Coe can get by
Grinnell, they finish with Lawrence and Monmouth at
home bdth of which they should win handily If Ripon
and Calnell both win tomoriow as I have piedicted,
however, all eyes will be on Ripon next weekend when
the two teams will clash in what would probably de-
cide the title.

What all these ifs boil down to is that Ripon is
still undefeated and therefore in the driver s seat>lf any
one of the three once- -beaten teams is going to win the
championship they will have to win all of theii remain-
ing games and hope for a Ripon loss, This writer sees
little chance of Ripon losing a game, with their last
game (Beloit~away) being the only possible excep-

Again fielding a full five-man

Saturday.

The return to action of Capt.
Paul Patterson after a five-

neer numbers to five for the
first time since early October.

The meat, which will precede
the Grinnell-Coe football battle,

As long as I have stuck my neck out, I can’t resist
including the following prediction:

To those avid Iowa fans who scoff at this, my season's
prediction record presently stands at 93 right 0 wrong

read a lot.

“I ride a bicycle to rehear-
ﬁals, and there is a road that
would take me there in half a
minute. But it is a one-way
street, so it takes me fifteen
minutes to get to rehearsals."

Kierek could have gone on
indefinitely, but he was called
to do the Lenoir scene.

Then it was time for Gaines.
He explained that the film be
ing produced would cost $25,»
000 and would run 45 minutes.

“Half the movie will be of the
Pittsburgh orchestra in Poland,
however. I was over there to
help him that.” Gaines has
done other overseas work and
is also in charge of producing
a weekly science series in Span-
ish and Portuguese for the
.USlA.

The sequence in the Fine

several times from different
locations since there was only

time the five‘musicians were
noticeably restless.

nell-Carleton soccer match was
supposed to arrive from Des
Moines. Also on board were
supposed to be four string play-
ers to film a jam session with
the Lenox Quartet. Neither soc-
cer spectators n o r quarter
showed up. and Gaines, now
very behind schedule, sped up
affairs.

A meeting with selected fac-
ulty was quickly carried out in
the Fine Arts Center. This was
followed by a walk to Burling
and a brief meeting with Dean
James H. Stauss.

It was now 4:30 and the film-
ing was officially over for the
day. Everyone in the entourage
was tired but the Warsaw quin-
tet. They toured the library
and admired the permanent
art collection and the Congres-
sional documents.

Even then the day wasn’t
over. The party proceeded to
the soccer game; where Gaines
got in some unexpected filming.
The five got to see Vince Anku
kick his record-tying sixth goal
during their brief stay. Kierek

noted that this game com-
pared favorably with Euro-
pean soccer.

The day ﬁnally ended with
dinner in Cowles, Before leav-
ing, the five were given copies
of the 5&8. Kierek read the
story about the Philharmonic;
his first comment was that the
name of the composer Berlioz
had been misspelled.

The hectic day was over; the
musicians had enjoyed it im-
mensely. The only people who
didn’t go home relaxed were
Gaines and his cameramen,
who still had some difficult
scenes to shoot at the matinee
concert in Roberts Theatre the
next day.
