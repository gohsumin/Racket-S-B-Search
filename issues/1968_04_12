Etudenls Jubilant

LBJ NON-GANDIDAGY ENDORSED

WASHINGTON, April I2
(CPS) — Students around the
country reacted with jubilation
10 President Johnson’s an<
liDuncement that he would not
seek another term as Presl<
dent.

But beneath the jubilation
there was an undercurrent of
suspicion oi Johnson’s motives,
among politically aware stu-
dents. A CPS survey of about
20 large campuses also showed
a slight feeling oi sympathy tor
the President and a good deal
0! contusion, especially in the
.West.

SPONTANEOUS
jg; ._.. DEMONSTRATIONS
~ There were spontaneous dem<
unstrations on several Cam-
puses and in several large
ﬁllies.

In Washington, about 150200

eople danced and sang in La-
oyette Park, across the street
from the White House About
It) policemen patrolled in front
01 the White House and 1.11m

persons were arrested for re-
tusing to move on when told
to. (Washington has strict laws
against parading in lront oi the
white l-louse without a permit.)

In Boston about 3,000 people,
most of tltem Boston Univer-
sity and Massachusetts Insti-
tute oi Technology students
marched from Harvard Square
to the steps of the Statehouse
at about 2 am. Monday. They
held a rally with speeches,
chanting. and singing on the
steps at the statehouse.

In Philadelphia about 1,000
University DI Pennsylvania Stu-
dents marched to Independence
Hall singing “God Bless Amer-
ica."

THE WITCH IS DEAD

In Chicago a couple of
groups oi about 150 students
roamed the streets. One group
on the University at Chicago
Campus sang “ding, dong, the
witch is dead,”

Al Yale University about 200

students gathered to sing the
”Star Spangled Banner" and
then marched off to the home
of Chaplain William Sloane
Cofﬁn, shouting “Coifin for
president." Coiiin did not ap-
pear to speak, however, and
the students went away chant-
in g, “McCarthy. McCarthy"

COUNSELORS

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 1
(CPS) — Five Federal Narcot-
ics agents roused students out
of bed at 5:30 a.m. in a mari-
juana raid at American Uni<
versity here Thursday.

The agents said they arrested
seven students, all allegedly
dealers in marijuana,

University oiiiClals gave var-
lous other estimates of the
number of arrests which ran as
high as 17. The campus news-
paper, the Eagle, said most
campus sources put the num-
ber at 13.

The raid had full co-operation
or University orticials. Gradu-
ate student counselors who live
in the dorms “were all in coals
and ties," according to one
student, who added that “they
got all the dealers in the
dorm."

Colonel Leggett’s Return
From The Plantation

That President Glenn Leggett was in Mississ-
ippi — the traditional bastion of White Supremacy
-— at the time of Dr. Martin Luther King‘s death is
I matter of coincidence.

That he traveled 1,100 miles from Grinnell to
the Gulf Coast for a meeting is a matter that might
have escaped all notice, were it not for the national
publicity and national remorse attending Dr. King’s
murder and funeral.

That Leggett went to the meeting in Pasca-
goula at all (see story, PAGE FIVE)) is a matter
of concern for everyone at Grinnell College.

The conference that the president attended was
a board of directors meeting of the Associated Col-
Ieges of the Midwest (ACM), an organization ~—
we need scarcely point out — that has no members
farther south than Grinnell, la. — let alone in
Southernmost Mississippi.

Whether or not Leggett was a party in decid-
ing on the site of the meeting; whether or not he
had to attend as Grinnell‘s official emissary to the
ACM; whether or not a national tragedy occurred
during his sojourn; whether or not he enjoyed his
excursion — the editors of the 5&3 agree with the
faculty members and students at Grinnell that the
trip to Pascagoula, Miss. “was not a very good idea
at all.”

If Beloit College President Miller Upton -—
the man who allegedly slated the ACM conference
at Pascagoula — or President Leggett or any other
president of an ACM college wants to spend his va-
cation in Biloxi or Pascagoula or Las Vegas or
whereever, that’s his own business —- when he’s
acting as an individual.

But as a representative of a liberal arts college
supposedly trying to keep rapport with —and re-
cruit more of — Negro students, he has no business
going to Mississippi at the time of Dr. King's death
or any other time.

And, as members of an association of Mid-
western schools, the colleges involved had no busi-
ness letting their representatives spend college
funds on the Gulf Coast.

In the world of athletics, representatives of
groups, agencies, universities, and colleges have
been known to boycott games, meets, and confer-
ences in segregated locales and at segregated estab-
lishments. When White and Negro athletes boycot-
ted the track and field meet sponsored by the seg-
regated New York Athletic Club earlier this year,
educated people everywhere applauded their ac-
tion,

The S&B would have applauded Leggett had
he boycotted last week’s ACM conference in Miss-
lssippi.

Leggett and other representatives of the ACM
were rooming in Longfellow House — an erstwhile
plantation and presently a discriminatory hotel-
motel in Mississippi. That they were there at a
time of national tragedy — tragedy particularly for
Black Americans—adds injury to insult.

Welcome home from the plantation house, Col-
onel Leggett. We hope you enjoyed your trip, and
now that you’re back on campus the editors of the
8&3 hope you don't have even more problems com-
municating with our Negro students than you had
before your Mississippi vacation.

spond to the recent statements

cessity to mainlain the right
of any person to arrive 31' his

to voice his beliefs and act
accordingly.

Yet those who seek io re»
move ROTC irom Grinnell deny
this right to persons who do

able use of the time he must

than any other department 0!
which I am aware at Grin-

If a cadet displays confusion
or objections to the program
(Mr, Walters refers to this as
a “bad attitude”), a cadel oi.
iicei . . .tries to explain why
something is done in a paroch-
lar way. It the cadei has it
suggestion, it is considered.

I spent some time talking It}
Duncan Waiters last semester.
He understood his contract
from the beginning. Although
I disagree with his statemenls
I respect his opinions and leel
that if his beliefs are sincere,
he made the right decision in
leaving ROTC.

The statements concerning
his fate in the Pierodaclyl are
highly exaggerated. Waiters
cannot be tried as a deserier
or a traitor. Skinner can ﬁnd
no laws military or civil, which
make such action legal. Tho
Ptemdactyl has engaged in mis-
representation to create their
own picture of ROTC. The slam
men: on “attitudes which make
one capable of killing in rim:
of war" and on high-school
sign-ups to eliminate cadets
with the “wrong‘ attitude are
completely false.

The ROTC course does not
attempt to prepare cadets for
killing. The curriculum aims
at preparing managers and
leaders »— not soldiers.

Let me close with one last
remark. i don‘t plan an Air
Force career and have no
great compassion for the mil~
itary and the job they must do.

i maely believe that all per-
sons are entitled to free thought
and action regardless of the
fact that ii may be considered
“conservative” and “immoral"
by the “liberals." If the 11de
cales I)! this “morality" deny
this right to others then
they seek in eliminate an op.

very act which may condemn

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

THE GARRISON CAMPUS

By PHIL SEMAS
Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON — American Students have long been second
only to American Negroes as an oppressed class in this country.
Many writers have recently iocused on that oppression—Nat lien-
toii with “Youth: the Oppressed Majority" bt Playboy and the Loo
Angeles Free Press with its widely quoted “Students are Niggers"
article.

For years students were denied basic rights available to most
other citizens, as were Negroes. Lately, colleges have been grant-
ing students more or their rights, such as authority over rules oi
conduct and sometimes even a voice in making educational policies
— just as a rapid succession oi civil rights laws have given Ne-
groes many paper rights.

But Negroes have always been faced wilh a diiiei'ent kind of
oppression: police with cattle prods, tear gas, dogs, and guns.
American students have seldom had to face that — until this year.
Now, at the same time as US. cities are arming to maintain “law
and order" this summer, many campuses are moving closer to
becoming armed garrisuns.

understandably, black students tare the greatest danger, since
they are simultaneously members oi two oppressed groups. Thus
we have several hundred police attacking the campus oI Texas
Southern University. And we have police shooting down unarmed
students at South Carolina State in Orangeburg.

Many black leaders have said that such violence will he con-
fined to black schools, that black students will continue to he shot
down but white students won’tt They may be right. But there are
some dangerous signs on white campuses; they have already seen
police violence and they could see some killing.

Last fall, in the face at dozens of disruptive dellionstrntiorls
against campus recruiting by the military and Dow Chemical
Company, administrations at the University or Wisconsin, Brook-
lyn College, and several other colleges called in outside police to
“deal" with the demonstrators. Students were teargassed, beaten,
and bullied.

Now more campuses are arming. Campus police at the Uni-
versity of Utah and Colorado State are now armed with Chemical
mace. It has actually been used on students at Colorado Stale. At
some schools the campus police now carry guns.

some administrations. oi course, don‘t want their campuses
turned into armed camps. But they otten ilnd the garrison philos-
ophy being imposed irom the outside.

Thus, San Francisco State College President John Summer-
skill was attacked by Governor Ronald Reagan, legislators and
college trustees ior not calling in the police during a disruptive
campus demonstration. ,

And California is now considering creation of n state-wide cam-
pus police, under the command or Governor Reagan, not campus
administrators.

And there is LBJ’s GIBaL Drug War. Supposedly part ot a new
effort against “crime,” his proposed legislation is aimed not at
organized underworld drug protiteers but at the people who use
drugs, mainly students. Under the new law a student who loans a
pep pill to a triend during finals is a tederal criminal. The new
legislation would make pot busts like the mass police raid at Stony
Brook, NY. an almost common occurrence. And it will also prob-
ably mean even more campus iniiltration by narcotics agean.

Just as many blacks have called Johnson‘s “crime message”
this year’s civil rights hill, so might students call it this year’s
education message

The causes of this situation should be obvious. Students have
turned to disruptive protests because they are ted up with their
schools’ complicity with what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex. That complex promulgates war and
killing ior proilt and students rightly argue that universities ought
to have nothing to do with it. Instead at providing the complex
with services such as research and a place to recruit manpower,
universities ought to be fighting it, students have argued.

But not many university administrations _ and certainly not
the military-industrial complex itself — can afford that kind of
dissent. At tirst they answered with empty words about ireedom,
the ireadom that the military-industrial complex is destroying in
America and around the world. Now they are beginning to answer
with iorce just as they have answered the Negro’s demand tor
more than paper rights with force.

Oppression of students is not yet at severe as that attire

THE RIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

1 note with sorrow that Mr: Howard K. Smith has qult tho
column-willing business because oi his general disgust with com
temporary toul'nulism. Particularly, he cites the buildup that
has been given to Stokely Carmichael, insisting that by giving
lnm such attention as we have, we are all oi us Frankensteius,
busily creating our own little monsters.

Now Mr. Smith himscli has been given to a strange produc-
tion or two, as when he invited Alger Htss ot all people to join a
television panel to discuss the tall oi Richard Nixon after his
detect in 1962. Mr. Hlss is about as qualitied to discuss the short-
comings oi lvir. Nixon as Mr. Oswald would have been to discuss
those at Mr, kennedy.

Still, he has a point worth contemplating. He gave another
example, namely the notorious photograph oi a month ago de~
picling the police Clitel's execution oi a Vet Cong. “Not even a
perinnctory acknowledgment was made at the tact that such
executtons. en masse, are the Vet Cong \Vay ot war.”

He quoted his own sun in Vietnam, leit for dead by the Com-
munists, who witnessed the execution by the enemy oi a dozen
U.S. soldiers in unilorm. Note that the Viet Cong was nut in
nnitorm, and hence was subject to execution. To be sure, aiter a
trial.

The interesting question is, how do you hold trials in a city
that is burning up with insurgency? The answer is that, as a
matter at fact, you don't usually have trials in such circumstances.
Thai. is one ot the reasons why wars are so hateiul.

It is interesting that the critics of the Vietnam war tend to
criticize it because war is dreadful, but [hell they tend to criticize
that which goes to make war dreadlul. it it were possible to wage
wars without killing people, or destroyingeiarms, houses, water-
works, and schools, then wai‘ wouldn't be dreadful. is it loo much
to ask that they at least accept the ontological structure of war,
and then criticize it?

l do not know whether, at the time Mr. Smith resigned, ho
had seen the NbC telecast, on the war, whose transcript 1 now
have, with master ot ceremonies Edwin Newman, and expert
guests. 1 should think it would have accelerated his decision.
(Professor Seymour Mclman weighed in with his criticism or
the alorementioned execution.)

The most striking aspect of it was the brief historical rum
down by Mr. Newman which went, so help me,

“National elections to reunlly Vietnam were to be held in
1955. Agreements were not signed by South Vietnam or the United
States, which (ltd not want to approve a settlement that legiti-
mized Communist rule in another country, or even half a country.
The United States did promise uni. m use iorce to overturn the
Geneva Agreement. After the division of Vietnam, Bat) Dal was
soon nudged aside by the man who was to dominate South Viet-
11am for almost a decade, Ngo Dinli Diem."

“Willi American sponsorship, advice, and economic help, he
consolidated his power around his family and his Catholic co.
religlomsts, many oi them irom the North. There seems little
doubt that Ho Chi Minh would have won the nationwide election!
scheduled for l95li, but Diem refused to hold the election. The
United States supported hurt and said the elecitons could not
possibly have been tan- in the North. Diem also continued to
crush all opposition.”

It is easier to rebuild Hue than that travesty.

No mention oi the grisly purges conducted by no that caused
a million North Vietnamese to flee south; no mention that Ho's
popularity in 1954 was like Castro's on New Year's Day 1959.
Both were popular, None, ninety clays aiter achieving power,
would have risked a tl‘uly free election. No mention that Diem
conducted two elections and won both oi them.

None that his government requested U.S. aid. No mention
that South Vlelnilm had been set up as n separate state in 1946,
and that the majority oi the United Nations were disposed to grant
it membership in 1952 and again in 1957 and would have except
for a Soviet veto.

To observe that Diem “crushed” the opposirion without men.
tioning that the North took care at its opposition by killing them,
or chasing them south; is — well, akin to staring at the picture
of the viet Cong in Saigon and cluckrcltlcklng about the cruelitlea
oi the South Vietnamese.

Mr. Smith is on to something. We seem to Want. to believe
that we are very evil people, supporttng other people who are
very evrl. some people get a kick out oi that, excluding. ! am
glad to note, Mr. Howard K, Smith.

Changes Finally Revealed

CURRICUlUM ALTERED TO FIT REPORT

By ADRlENNE LEMMONS
58x3 Staff Writer

After 5 e v er al months of
heated scrutiny, the faculty has
approved, with a few amend-
merits, nearly all of the rec<
ommendations submitted last
fall by the Committee on Edu-
cational Policy and Curriculum.

The report included changes
in course requirements, inde-
pendent study, and academic
credit for some activities now
considered extra-curricular.

Course requirements, accord-
ing to Joseph F. Wall (history),
Chairman of the Faculty, have
been altered along the lines
suggested in the curriculum re»
port. Beginning with 1968 in-
coming freshmen, students will
meet these requirements:

—Hulnanities I and II, fresh-
man year.

This course will attempt,
like the present Humanities
course, to teach techniques of
textual interpretation; the new
syllabus Will provide more study
at drama as a literary genre
and will probably include some
recent Works.

—Social Studies I and Il,

This is to be completed be
fore the end or the sophomore
year. Readings will cover
“classic texts in social thought,
including texts in philosophy,
religion, politics, economics, so-
ciology and anthropology."

The first semester, concen«
trating on periods ranging irom
classical Greece to the seven~
teenth century, will draw heav-
ily on philosophy, while the sec<
and semester, covering periods
from the French Revolution to
the present, will stress the so-
cial sciences. Emphasis will be
on intensive study at the ideas
and social issues of a new se-
lected periods rather than a
chronological survey of history.

—Sclence l and ii,

Which must be completed by
the end of the sophomore year.
The two courses will serve as
an introduction to biological
and physical sciences. Science
I is planned for the fall of

1968, with Science ll following
by spring ol 1969.

—Proﬁciency in a foreign
language equal to two years of
college study.

The present philosophy re-
quirement will remaln tor stu-
dents who have taken Histori-
cal Studies, but will not be
obligatory tor Social Studies stu-
dents.

The fate of Humanities Ill, 1:
course in music or visual arts
analogous to the present in-
troduction to Music and. intro-
duclion to Art courses, is still
undecided. A proposed change
would eliminate Introduction
to Theater as a means of
meeting the fine arts require-
ment, since Humanities I and
[I are expected to devote more
study to dramatic works.

To combat: a tendency to-
ward overspecialization, an up-
perclass general education re-
quirement has been approved.
Beginning with 1968.59 freshmen,
all students will be required
to take 16 hours either in a
special, nonrmajor program or
in electives outside the division
at the student's major, of which
at least two courses must be
Zoo-level or above.

Committees are being formed
to design special interdisciplin-
ary programs to fulfil this re-
quirement. Areas being con-
sidered include Religous Stud-
ies, Urban Studies, Internation-
al Studies, Communication Stud-
ies, and Studies in Philosophy
and Science.

In addition, 4 Credits of in-
dependent study will be re
quired (it all students begin-
ning with the graduating class
of 1972. Besides the present
2. and 4-credit independents, a
plan for course-related study is
being uttered, whereby a stu-
dent in a 4-hour course can
elect to pursue a 2-hour proj-
ect under the same teacher.
The 2- and 4-credit components
Will be graded separately, and
neither part can be taken cred-
itsfail.

Projects can be suggested
either by the instructor or by

WHERE ARE YOUR 127,000 CONSTITUENTS NOW?

(Editor‘s Note: while digging around the lie.
library at Berkeley, Ron Goodenow, '63, Grinnell's
West Coast Admissions Counselor, ran across this
item on i. o. Grinnell while doing research tor
his doctorate in the history oi education.)

In Febnlary, 1866, Grinncll, tllen serving in his second
term in the House oi Representatives, gave a speech on
the floor vehemently denouncing those Kentucky represen-
tatives who opposed the Freedmen's Bill, a proposal de-
signed to protect Southern Negroes from local violence and

discrimination.

A few months later, Representative Rousseau, one of
the Kentuckians against the bill, attacked Grinnell public—
ly in a New York speech, calling him a “pitiable politician
from lowa” who had departed so tar from “what every
body believes he ought to know and does know is the truth
that it is a degradation, not to his State, but to himself."

Grinnell shot back "When any man, I care not whether
he stands six feet high, whether he wears butt and carries
the air of a certain bird that has a more than usual ex~
tremity of tail, wanting in the other extremity — says that
he would not believe what 1 utter, I will say that l was
never born to stand under an imputatlctn of that sort."

Those were fighting words to the gentleman from Ken-

tucky. Three days later Rousseau approached Grinnell in
the east portico of the capitol and said, “I have waited
tour days tor an apology tor words spoken here upon this

floor.”

“What of that?” asked Mr. Grinnell,

“I Will teach you what of that," sold Rousseau, who
then proceeded to strike Grinnell about the head and shoul-
ders wltb a rattan cane, stopping occasionally to lecture

him in the following terms.

“Now, you d— puppy and poltroon, look at yourself."
Alter a few blows Grlnnell exclaimed, “I don't want to

hurt you."

“I don’t expect you to hurt me, you d—d Scoundrel,”
shouted Rousseau, “but you tried to injure me upon the
floor at the house, And now look at yoursell; whipped
here, whipped llke a dog, disgraced and degraded! Where
are your one hundred and twenty-seven thousand constitu-

ents now?"

Rousseau was later officially reprimanded by the
Speaker of the House. Several fellow Iowa Congressmen
presented Grinnell with a heavy cane made irom a bolt of
the historic Monitor so that he might protect himself from
further attacks. However, later that year Grinnell declined
to run for another term in the House.

LANGAN SWINE .
NATIONAL NEWS

Langan Hall's November pl
roast escapade made nations
news this month in Moderator
— “the national magazine for
leading students.”

“You’re not going to believe
this one," the magazine’s
“Grapeshot” column declared.
“The men of Langan Hall,
GRINNELL C 0 LL E G E, de‘
cided to hold a pig roast to
help raise funds for the cam-
pus charity iuod. They did it
the hard way.”

“Up early in the morning,
they went out and bought a
live pig,” the column con-
tinued, “hung it up in the dorm
shower to butcher it. Squeals
brought the director of resi-
dences, but too late."

“Grapeshot” is a column that
cites happenings at various
colleges and universities. The
column concluded with a con-
vetsation between the director
of residences and o Langan
freshman. Asked by the direc-
tor why the pig was slaughter-
ed in the shower. the lrosh re-
plied, "Where else, Mao
Field?"

In addition to picking up the
story or the Longan incident,
Moderator also attempted to
stereotype the Orinoco student
in its latest monthly issue:

“Ronald the Rad came to us
from progressive Summer Hill
High, where he called his pro—
iessors by their first names.
He has been all in favor of
ciVll rights, pot, socialism,
free love, and the rest of the
bag."

“His major is Russian,” the
Moderator description went on,
“the intorinal minor in drugs.
According to his application,
his grades are okay, but his
boards are better, which Ron
explains in a somewhat off-
hand manner, saying that
grades don’t matter, humanity
does.”

“That reminds us," the ar-
ticle concluded, “Where the
hell is Ronald?"

The computer, accordlng to
the magazine, would send him
— among other places — to
Grinnell College.

Other schools favorable to
the radical stereotype, accords
ing to the magazine, were Har-
vard, l-laveriord, Occidental,
Berkeley. and Claremont Men’l
College.

OVER 90 DEMONSTRATORS kept nearly—silent vigil outside the Science Lecture Room yesterday

banning military recruiting on campus. or protessors like Alan Jones, center, went in, students
lining the corridor walls singleille gave them copies oi a mimeographed rationale tor their protest.
“We hope our presence will reflect our concern . . . Our action is one of concern, not coercion.”

Last week the Cofl‘ passed a resolution against recruiting which comes to an all-campus relen-
lndum today. Marine recruiters, whose scheduled Jan. 26 visit was cancelled by President Leggett
— will come to Grhmell Monday. The USMC is the last recruiting session at any agency or corpor-

By NEIL FISCHER

Pascagoula Bay.

The hotel-motel and cooler-
tnce center is nominally open
on everyone. Actually, it dis-
courages Negot- guests.

Prcndent Glen Leggett re-
turned from the Gulf Coast re-
sort Sunday, and his visit to
Mississippi provoked surrepti-
tious but nonetheless hu'ious
controversy on campus her.
during the rat or the week.

leggett met Monday with
Professor Dennis do Coteeu
(Music) and visiting septist
chaplain at Harvard Ed Wright
—a iormer ministerial intern
It Grinnell.

At the meeting in Leggett's
hurling basement office, Wright
and de Coteau reportedly told
Leggett they didn't think his
trip to Pascagoula “was a very
good idea at all.”

The President went to the
Mississippi resort. to attend a
meeting or the Associated Col~
[ages of the Midwest (ACM)
board of directors, and was at
hongfellow House when news
or Dr. Martin Luther King's
ssassinotion reached the pub-
c.

At the Monday morning meet-
lng. de Coteau questioned the
choice oi Mississippi as an ap-
propriate site to: an ACM
meeting. uay definition," ho
told the 55:13, “the ACM in-
cludes only Midwestern colleges
- and oeﬂahly no college in
lliisslsslppi.”

Leggett told the 5&3 Wednes
day that the meeting was staged
in Pascagoula at the request
of Miller Upton, chairman DI
the ACM board and president
DI Beloit College (Wis), “who
grew up around those parts.”

MEETING PLANNED
BEFORE ASSASSINATION

Upton, a 1933 graduate of
Tulane University, was born
in New Orleans, La.——some 100
miles east at Pascagoula. The
Beloit president could not be
reached this week, but his
secretary, Mrs. Dorothy Knies
tutor-med the son:

"I don't know it he's ever been
there (Pascagnula), but nohody
around his office ever heard
him speak or the place until
the meeting was called there.”

Sumner Hayward, newly
chosen head of ACM, said
Thursday that the meeting in
Mississippi had been planned
as early as January.

“It was nothing more than
I coincidence," he said, “lhlt
we were there at the lime DI
Rev. King’s death — nothing
more than that."

Hayward said the ACM direc-
tors otten meet outside or the
Midwestern United States.

The last. meeting was held in
Minneapolis, Minn.

A previous meeting or the
ACM was held at Arlie House,
Washintoii, D, C., Leggcit said.

Arlie House made national
news earlier this year when
Washington 1 a w y e r William
Higgs investigated it and iuund
it to be tinanced and hugged
by The Central Intelligence
Agency.

WHITE STUDENTS QUOTED

De Coteau would not com-
ment on his meeting with Leg-
gett and Wright, he said Mon-
day night. He did add, how-

ever, tha “. . . many white
students—tint so much black
students; they didn't seem to
know that Leggett went to
Mississippi—have told me they
don't think Leggett should have
gone down there.”

It’s one thing, they say," do
Coteau continued, "for him to
vacation on the Gull Coast. But
it is quite another (or him—as
an official representative of
the College— to attend a meet-
ing all he way down In a state
noted for what Mississippi ta
noted for."

De Coteau explained he gath-
cred that while students think
Leggett should have boycotted
the ACM meeting.

LEGGETT HAS DIFFERENT
VIEW
“Like it or not," Leggett said
Tuesday, “Mississippi is 'li I
part of the United States."

“He (dc Coteau) told me he
didn't think it, my trip, was a
very good idea," Leggett ex-
plained. “M Wright seconded

”I said I didn't look it it that
Way,” Leggett added.

president Leggeit said he did-
n't think Longiellow House was
segregated and that he thought
there were some Negro guests
there during his stay.

None of the ACM members
present at the tour-day meeting,
which began last Thursday, were
Negroes. There are no ACM col-
leges, Leggett said, who have
Negro presidents.

[in 5&3 telephone inquiry to
Pascagoula Wednesday. found
that Longtellow House —- while
not actually violating the law —
was discriminatory.

“Are your iacilllies segregat-
M?’ Mrs. Betsy walker, assist.
ant manager, was asked.

Heavens know," she replied in
r iriendly, thick drawl.

“How many Negroes did you
have in residence at the time of
the ACM meeting?"

“None," she answered.

“Well. how many Negroes do
you have staying at Longfellow
House right now?"

“Well, none." she replied.

“How many Negro guests have
you had in the last four or ﬁve
months?’ the 5&3 asked.

“well, not very many . . . in
tact, none," the drawl went on,

“Why’s that?”

“Seventeen dollars I day Is
pretty steep tor most of them.”

ACM SMOCKED AT DEATH

Leggett said the ACM group
was “terribly shocked" when
they heard of Dri King's assas-
sination in Memphis. The pros
idem said he telephoned back
to Grinnell to suggat a mo-
morinl service be held Friday
on the mold.

"But," he said. "Dr. (Jo-
seph) Wall had already done
that."

Leggett had College Treasur-
er Donald Lamhie and Director
of Development James Avison
send telegrams to Mrs. King,
Randall Morgan (the Chicago
civil rights leader who was re-
sponsible ior Rev. King's visit
to campus in October), and
several congressmen — includ-
ing John Kyl, who represents
Grimell.

The telegram to (our cone
gressmen asked them to help
“report the civil rights bill

will presumably address him-
lelf to the critical situation in
the urban ghettos, a situation
made more critical by the re—
cent assassination of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King.

they may have to be content
with making "moderate” the

In the upcoming "real" conven—
tion will be or great impor-
tance,

Those two addresses will
mark the end oi any restrain—
ed air at cosinopolitanism and
the vicious infighting of con-
vention politics as it is known
at Grillnell will begin.

For the Democrats a tough
tight between McCarthy and
Kennedy is predicted. However,
LBJ’s campus campaign chair-
man Larry Fellerntan, who in»
slate that he is a serious sup-
porter oi Johnson, is not about
to throw in the towel, even
though his candidate evidently
has. Mike Dejoie’s rloor man~
aging or the Wallace candidacy
must be suspected oi being
something less than whole-
hearted,

Prominent campus political
observers, when asked about
the Republican convention,
would no more than shrug their
shoulders and ask it yoil wanle
Ed the nomination. Well known
political phrases like “wide
open convention” were banter-
ed around a lot. Names like
Rockefeller, Lindsay, and Fer-
cy got bantered around some-
what, [00.

But all ot this just goes to
show that like the “real” nomi-
nating canyentions this summer
.lt’s, anyone's ball game,

lsm of these conventions is or-
ganist wtlliam McMairis. Mo-
Mains has been the organist at
several “real" national conven-
tions.

in sketch form this is how
both of the two conventions
will run:

The keynote address will be
delivered. Then debate on the
piatiorlns by the delegates will
begin. Debate here, as noted

on the olflcial schedule, is ex- ,

pected to center around the
war in Vietnam and the war in
the Cities Amendments, in
wi‘illen form, from [he dele-
gates, will be debated and
voted upon and tinally a plat-
form will be adopted

The next order of business
will be the nominating
speeches for President. This is
lollowed, of course, by the roll
call voting of the state delega-
lions.

A light may develop over the
certain portions or the rules
governing conduct of the vot-
ing. There are two possibli
ways for a delegation to' vote:
As a whole, that is, the major»
ity of the delegation deClding
who Shall get all of that dele«
gation’s votes (culled unit rule)
or the delegation may be split,
that is live Votes (or one cans
didate, ten for another, etc. In
most conventions either the
unit rule or the split delegar
iron rule applies.

At lhe mock Conventions at
Grinnell, as [he rules read how,
each delegate votes. on each
roll call (several may be
needed to pick a winning can.
didaie), whether it shall be
governed by the unit rule or by
the split rtlle.

Following the nomination of
a Pmsldential candidate are
the nominating speeches and
voting for a Vice Presidential
candidate

The reasons tor participating
in the mock political conven-
tions- are varied. One argument
goes that it is a good way to
get publicity tor a particular
point of view. That is, a “peace
candidate" and a i‘a d i c 81
“peace" platform would be
good publicity for that point of
View. To a limited extent [his
is the case. However, press
coverage of previous conven~
lions has been limited almost
exclusively to town papers. The
more massive of the media
have been enthilSlasth in their
disregard for the political con—
cern and belief OI Grinlleil stu-
dents.

A better argument can be
made for the familiarity with
the convention system that
these mock conventions pro-
vide. The convention, with all
its Iailings, is a common
American political tool (AbeL-
CIO and the DAR both have
conventions that are governed
by much the same set of prin-
ciples — or lack thereof) and
one who anticipates taking
part in Amerlcan political life

Student press reaction was

and called on ills successor to

The Yale Daily News said
“we enthusiastically endorse
LBJ’s non-candidacy.”

Some college editors, such as
those at the UCLA Daily Bruin,
said they might find It easier
to endorse Minnesota Senator
Eugene McCall-thy now, since it
is no longer necessary to stop
Johnson.

“Johnson’s withdrawal had a

TIME’S
MOGK
PRIMARY

By PHIL SEMAS

Collegiate Press Service

In any election year there all
always numerous mock primar-
ies and elections on collegc
campuses.

In 1968 these llldivIdunI Iocol
primaries will be pushed into
the background by Choice ‘68,
a national primary to be held
April 24 on more than 1,000
college campuses.

The organizers oi the on.
mary say they already have
1,100 schools with four-anda
half million students signed up
to participate, including almost
all of the large schools. They
hope to have at least 1,500,
which would give them a potenv
tial electorate of tive-and-arhall
million. That would make it
the second largest pnmary in
the nation (after California’s).
Some have predicted that they
will get close to 2,000 schools,
which would be nearly every
college in the country.

Choice '65 is the idea of Bob
Harris, a former Michigan Stain
University student body presi-
dent. It occurred to him last
summer that, instead of a hap-
hazard group ot local primaries,
college students ought to veto
at the same time in one nation-
al primary.

He then started going to

But Harris says Time ha:
given him and his board of dis
rectors complete control over
policy. “They do exercise qua].

“but they let us decide on bash:

And on the Populist—Welfurisi Tickel‘ . . .
HE—

AN HOUR Willi GEGRGE WALLACE I.

By Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

A month or so before George
Wallace Conﬁrmed that he
would run for President on a
third party ticket, the right
wing weekly iournal, Human
Events, published the results of
a poll of “two hundred promi-
nent conservatives." The poll
unearthed a surprising hostility
towards George Wallace.” Why?
.i asked him a few weeks ago.

S Well, Mr. Buck-
ley said that two-hun-
dred prominent conser-
vatives — that‘s typical
of those who write in
mugazines — who
are these prominent
conservatives?

Moderator: Mr. Buck-
ley, did the magazine
list the conservatives?

B: No, it didn’t. But
suppose Governor Wal-
lace names one prom-
inent conservative out-
side the South who’s in
favor of him?

6W: Mr. Buckley, 1
run my politics like i do
in Alabama. l never
went to the County
Court Houses to see [he
the county governing
bodies. l just went to
the people. i go out to
the masses of the peo-
ple with the message
that l have, and i don’t
know any prominent
conservatives.

i tried to suggest that the
reason why prominent con-
servatives do not. endorse
George Wallace is because they
do not believe that his activities
are in the conservative tradi-
tinn, Sophisticated conservatives
believe that Wallace's passion
for states rights derives mm
the knowledge that this is the
only way to administer a segre-
gated state.

Mr. Wallace replied that an
enormous number or Negroes
voted for his wile. Governor
Lurleen Wallace, at the last
election, that he is no longer a
member of the ofllcial Demo-
eratic establishment, that he
broke with John Kennedy alter
his election, and did not vote
for Johnson in 1964. And any»
way, what could a conservative
ﬁnd to criticize in his program
for Alabama?:

GW: Name one thing
in Alabama that l have
supported on the govern<
mental level that you
are against.

H: You want (the
state) to take care of
hospitalization, y o u
want to take care of
old people, you want
to take care of the
poor . . .

cw: Are you against
caring [or the poor and
the old?

(i thought perhaps
that Mr. Wallace would
Ibandon the technique
if 1 ridiculed it, so I

answered mock-
solemniy, “I hate the
poor." it didn’t wor

GW: 1 am for look-
ing aiter destitute elder-
ly people. I’m not as
gainst that at all. So
if conservatlsm is
against looking alter
the elderly who are des-
titute, i might say that
no conservative in this
country who comes out
against looking after
destitute elderly peo—
ple, ought to be elected
to anything.

Moderator: Let‘s get
it deiinitely from Gover-
nor Wallace, whether he
is a conservative, or
pretends to be a con-
servative.

B: He calls himself
a populist.

cw: If you mean (by)
a populist a man of the
people, yes, I’m a pop-
ulist, if that’s what you
mean by it. . .Let’s get
back to the old age pen-
sions. Let's see, you’re
against Alabama’s look-
ing after the elderly,
destitute citizens ol the
state?

I had observed that Mr. Wal-
lace, like most. liberals, favors
tederal welfare programs — but
then resents Washington’s in-
terference. He replied that Al-
abama was only getting back
in wellare What. Alabama put
out in tederal taxes. Partly
true, I agreed, but in tact Al-
abama got more back irom the
government than Alabama gave
to the government, by a long
sight . . . He is extremely de-
iensive on this point:

GW: Where are your tig-
ures? You‘ve made ii
chnrge ngainsi Alabama,
give us the ligures . . .

b: My guess is that you
take in at least five times
Is much iroin the Federal
Government as you send
out in taxes.

6W: . . . that’s totally
untrue.

n. l happen to know the
figures ior Mississippi eit-
actly, ten to one: that’s why
I sort of cut that in hair.

ow: It’s not ten to one
in Mississippi in the iirst
place. 1’" say Ihat’s wrong

(The current tigures on Mis-
sissippi and Alabama are: Mis~
sissippi puts up ascents tor
every dollar she brings in
from the Federal Government.
Alabama puts in sl-cents, Still,
it is a good economic bargain.)

So it went. Mr. Wallace
seemed to be arguing that state
weltarism is altogether ,desir»
able, provided the relevant ad-
ministrative 'unit is the state,
not the Federal Government.

He seemed tovbe saying that

something suddenly happened
half way through John Kenna
dy's reign that justified his sud-
den disillusion with the nation-
al Democratic Party. But that
whatever it was that happened,
it had nothing to do with the
race question, and that the
vote oi so many Negroes
for Lurleen Wallace shrlves

him of any suspicion that his
program is based on race.

We have seen that George
Wallace stoutly insists that he
is not to be thought or as a rac-
lst candidate, even though he
has never explained satisiac-
torily why he was an enthusias-
tic national Democrat, in the

SuJiTEE

tradition or Roosevelt, Kennedy,
and Johnson, up until the mo-
ment when the Federal Gov-
ernment began to interiere with
the will of Alabama on the
matter of segregation,

It is not as though, when
Governor Wallace stood at the
threshhold of the University of
Alabama and defied the federal
marshal to carry out the court
order integrating the univers-
ity, he there and then repented
of his former activities, per.
ceiving the implications of state
welfarism.

"suppeors to be periecily
satisfied for Washington to col-

lect taxes and remit Ihe pro-
ceeds to the states — provided
there are no accompanying in-
structions on how that money is
to he used. He is quite prepared
to accept, for Alabama, twice
as much money as Alabama
contributes to the federal trea-
sury. What he is not prepared
to do is acquiesce in Washing-
Ion’s instructions on how Ala-

bania should run its school sys-
tem, or indeed anything else
that Alabama rims, thiit hem
(m the question of race segrega-
lion.

What will prove especially
interesting about George Wal-
lace in the months to come is
less his Views (he has adopted
the full paraphernalia of tha
conervative, even though he is
a \veltarist-populist, catalyzed
by his passion for racial segre-
gation) than his techniques.

Here, as I discovered, are a
few of them.

1. EXAGGERATING THE
SOUTH’S FLIGHT.

6W: . . . we had five
generations of people who
didn’t. go to school-because
there were no schools it)!

black or white. All they
could do is eke something
out of the ground to eat . . .

(There were public schools in
Alabama, and ior that matter
private schools, during the livl
generations in question.)

2. 50’s YOUR OLD MAN.

Buckley: . . . Certiiln poi.
iticians grew up in th- -

South and lusted tor partici-
pation in a type of govern-
ment which is (listinclively
anti-conservative, the type
oi government of which Mr.
Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy
and Mr. Johnson are (rep«
resentative). Then all of a
s u d d e n, something hap—
pened. The consequences of
that lederalization als is
meant that they couldn’t
continue in their segregated
ways, and that‘s when Gov-
emor Wallace was bom—

GW: Of course, I was not
even voting in the days that
you’re talking about, i
didn’t even vote In those
elections, but when you say
that, because of the people
of the South voted for Mr.
Roosevelt that made them
anti-conservative, Well New
York voted for Mr. Roose-
velt all four times . . .

s . . It doesn’t make any
difference to me whether
some prominent conserva~
tlve is not for me. 70% of
the people last night on a
poll on the television station
in St. Louis said they would
support me. The iact is that
i won the television poll on
WIIC in Pittsburgh Ihe oth-
er day and defeated John<
son, Kennedy, and Reagan
by almost three to one.

B: And they might have
given more votes to Peron
than they did to you, right?

6W: That‘s a real smart
mower.

a: We know that he got
many more votes in Ar-
gentina) than you got in Al—
abama.

aw: i got more in Ala-
bama than you got in New
York.

3. NOBODY-EVER~
LETS-ME-TALK.

GW: Why don’t you let
me talk? After all . . . I
thought you invited me to
get my opinion . . . Really,
i thought i was supposed to
—- you wanted my opinion.
But when you get on Ihis
show, the man that puts on
the show wants to do all
the talking. (At that point
in the program, by exact
count from a transcription,
the moderator had spoken
in words, I had spoken 169,
and Wallace 845.)

I. THERE-AlN’T—NOBODY-

Friday, April l2, I‘ibBr

By BARRY ANCONA

l have noted that touring companies performances at Grin-
hell have always produced an inordinate amount of applause. 1
think I know why. The country kids are glad to have any expo«
sure to culture, and the City kids, socially starved out here, are
keen for any reminders of home.

This may seem a very Stucksup, better-than-thou attitude.
It is.

Wicked City is a touring company — a New York show on
the road. Maybe you got a glimpse oi it Visiting the big town, but
let me tell you: New York is a great place to live, but i wouldn’t
want [0 Visit.

To really appreciate the wicked city e any wicked city —
you have to live in it; feel it in you as you try to find whztt you're
about.

When you grow up in a small town, as you get older, you
get to know more and more people in the town. When you grow
up in a city, as you get older you get to know more and more
people, but you also meet thousands of people you don’t know.
This is the challenging thing about life in the city 7 the people
you meet every day that you don’t know, that you will never
see again.

It’s trighteiiing when you are knifed, a block from your home,
by someone you have never seen before. It’s a relief to know you
may never see him again. it’s exciting to meet some girl you’ve
never seen before. And depressing to think you may never see
her again.

But that's what Wicked City is all about. The high school
pals, and girls next door, and every smalHown way of life is
there, but it's threading the maze of indifference and coincidence,
the long subway ride home, that makes the city unique.

I'm going to talk about a certain subway line. i used it fre-
quently during my senior year in high school. Mostly between
midnight and 3 am.

it would be nice to think that l was travelling long distances
to sow my wild oats far from home, but it was just coincidence
that almost every girl i knew lived in the West Bronx, just off
the Jerome Avenue line (That meant a 45 minute subway ride
Ind a lo minute walk to get home),

Of course. these were Wicked City girls, They were my age
(15) or a bit younger. They did not go to my high school (it was
all boys). They were all bright. And pretty good-looking. And all
had some screwy hang-up. i mean screwy. Nothing ordinary in
hang-ups lar them.

One girl had a mother who was trying to act the age that the
girl was, and correspondingly tried to make the girl look and act
like a iive-yearcld. One girl had a Jewish father and a Catholic
mother who got divorced. The father then married a Protestant.
The girl also wanted to be a ballet dancer. But her build (about
five feet tall, and livmg proof that the cantilever principle works),
although quite appealing. was not cut out, so to speak, for ballet.
One girl had a great home life, and was happy in her work and
play, and could have passed tor Nancy Normal, if she hadn't been
a bit hungsup because she was raped when she was eleven.

My only hangsup was that I was hung on girls with hangrups.
A real social worker. With a few ulterior motives

But back to that subway. it would be possible, I imagine, to
have three such girls living on three blocks of Main Street, Grina
hell. But to come and go with each one without detection by the
others would require travelling through the sewer system and
popping out of secluded storm drains. That’s kind of what the
subway is.

The Jerome Avenue line is not a subway at all in the Bronx
— it is an elevated. The station plattorms Vibrate as trains pass.
You can look down between the ties to the street below, or, over
your shoulder, into Somebody’s apartment. Most of the plaliorm
is uncovered — you can wait twenty minutes in a blizzard for
a train.

When you ride a subway train at night, you ride in either the
first or the middle car. The motorman is in the first, and the
conductor in the middle. This was in the days beiore policemen
rode the trains. I was five [eat four inches in those days.

it's diiierent now. When i drive my car in the city, I feel I've
turned it. It's so safe and isolated in a car. But park the Car and
walk a block and the old feeling is back.

There is a challenge to walk a straight line, with unexpected
pleasure and pain lurking right and lett. And when you realize

that y’ou’must expect the unexpected, 'you have submitted to the ,

urst initiation rite oi the Wicked- City. Enjoyt

The American Security Coun—
cil, not to he Conlused with the
National Security Council, has
its headquarters in an un-

Wacker Drive in Chicago.

There is no listing for the
first five floors on the elevator

the American Security Council
and the seventh ﬂoor, the l -

The Council was formed in
l955 as an organization through
which the private sector of the
society might help to meet the
Communist challenge in the
cold war. It is still Concerned
with meeting the Communist
challenge.

Explains John M. Fisher,

“The A m e r i c a n Security

' n fact, now its a corpor-

Tlie organization in c l u d e 3

(working together to meet their

Security checks, either on

Book Review

DADA, ART AND ANTI-ART

By ROBIN STANDISH
LIBERATION News Service

Dada, Art and Anti-Art.
Hans Richter. lvlccraw i-iili.
53.95 paperback.

Dada represents an unfin-
ished revolution in art, one
that our movement artists to-
day are continuing. Dada was
a great era when art was an
organic part or the artist‘s
life; artists were not afraid to
make a statement, they wanted
to communicate on Vital lev-
els, and art gave meaning to
their lives. Arr, llle. and rev-
olution were united. The publi-
cation ol l-lans Richter's mag-
niiicent book. Dada, Art and
Anti-Art is an important event,
for Dada raises some vital
questions not only about art,
but about life and revolution.

We who are Movement peo-
ple, following the lead of tho
anarchists and other decentra—
lists and libertarians, are be-
coming more and more coit-
cerned to live our revolution.
We are seeking to build a life
which is regenerative before
(or at least at the same time
as) i! is revolutionary, a life
which creates the new, in our
own lives, while it destroys
the decay in society (and in
our own lives). Can this be
done? Or is a whole, regen-
erative life antithetical to a
struggle for massive social
Change?

We all know what happened
in prerNazi Germany. The Da-
daists did not prevent Hitler,
and neither did deeply anti-
Nazi people who withdrew from
the struggle both psychically
and physically to live regen»
ei'ative lives in rural intentionv
al communities such as the
Bruderhot. Yet both groups af-
ter us some clues.

some people are seeking
rural communities which will

maintain Itmnz ties with tho ‘

city, with a lot or movement
back and forth, as people work
in free universities, guerilla
theater, etc, Some will manage
to make their peace With the
city, finding regenerative lives
with or without community. For
some people, art offers its
own answer, Yea—saying Dada
was concerned with the rebirth
of society. Art of this nature
is revolutionary; it gets in
people’s guts. Art as the com—
munlcation of life, art as an
extension of self to others,—
art from community in the
form or guerilla theater, music,
painting, whatever—such art of-
fers a synthesis of a regener-
ative lite and revolutionary so-
cial change. When this hap-
pens, we are picking up on the
unﬁnished revolution of Dada.

Dada, Art and Anti-Art is a
loving account by one of Dada's
creators, hence its vitality and
spirit. This is nu mere scholar-
ly history, though it possesses
that element too. The book is
filled with pictures, some in
color. There is a good selec-
tion of drawings and posters,
and even some poetry and short
plays. in addition there are
pictures of the artists, and it
is a great delight to find that
Hans Arp looks like his work.
The $3.95 paperback is a ver-
sion of a gorgeous s50 hardr
back, an awesiuspiring book
that good public libraries should
have.

Richter, with Hugo Ball,
Tzara, lluelsenbeck, Arp and
several Others originated Dada
in about 1916. Cnaracteristicale
ly, they disagreed actively about
the origin at the word “dada.”
Richter’s explanation, the love-
liest one, i think, is that it
stems from Tazara and Janco’s
Rumanlau ‘da-da,‘ an approv-
ing expression that accented

A pamphlet entitled: “Just
What is the American Security

ization:

“Key leaders of commerce
and industry recognized that pri-
vate businesses have an es
pecially urgent need to rise to
the challenge of Communism,
which is dedicated to the
DESTRUCTION oi the tree
enterprise system."

“Accordingly, the American
Security Council was organized
as a non-proﬁt business as-
sociation to increase awareness
ofthe long term Communist
objectives and to develop new
and original approaches in
countering Communism’s war
to conquer the world."

"We’ve got black suits on

5260 AT RALLY ALONE

SDS members and Thomas
then circulated through the
crowd taking contributions to
pay for the telegrams and in
send to the Memphis garbage
workers.

By the time they had {in-

rally alone.

An admtionul 370 had been
turned over to the rally plan-
ners Sunday mornlng by Col-
loge Chaplain Dennis Hous—
the collection from the weekly
service in Herrick Chapel.

“I hate being ill Grinnell to-
day," the Rev. Ed Wright, a
former ministerial intern at
Grinneil during the 1964-65
school year and now Baptist
Chaplain at Harvard, had told
the Sunday worshipers in Her-
rick.

Wright denounced the Church
In general and Grinnell churches
in particular at the Sunday
momlng service before the
rally. He had come to Grin-
hell on President Leggett’s in-
vitation, he said, and was
cheerless at Grinnell on the
national day oi mourning for
Dr. King.

EIGHT CHURCHES SAY “NO”

Only 550 was brought in irnm

churches in the town of Grlnr

twelve oi Grinnell's sixteen

churches had been called and
asked il a team or one black
girl and one white girl from
the College could attend the
Sunday services at each one
and collect money for the con-
tribution in memorial to Dr.
King.

PETITIONS AND APPEALS

Concern over Martin Luther

was not limited to colliribu~
tions at the Sunday rally.

Friday - less than twelve
hours alter King‘s assassina-
tron—Gates freshman Ted Glick
posted a petition in Cnmegie
basement calling ror “prompt,
swift action on the lair housing
bill now under consideration in
Congress.”

"We, the undersigned stua

“in despair and sorrow over
the tragic murder or Dr. Mar-
lin Luther King, ask, beseech.

and demand that ihe goveming'

body of this country act im-
mediately to end the conditions
in this country which breed
violence nl this sort.”

After asking for immediate
aclion on the tan llouslng bill,
the petition went- on to . .
desire that more measures be
enacted to bring equality and
freedom [0 all residents of the
United States, no matter what
their color may be."

During the is hours the pe-
tirion was up in the post of-
nce, no students and faculty
members signed it.

Copies of Glick's petition were
sent Monday to Speaker of the
House John W. McCormack and
Vice President Hubert Hum-
phrey.

Gllck enclosed a letter with
copies oi the petition. “No at-
tempt to recruit the signa-
tures was made," he explained.
“i am sure that many more
signatures could have been ob-

CHURCHES, CBS TO MEET

College Chaplain Dennis l-laar
was expected to reprimand the
members oi the Grinnell Min-
isterlal Association (GMA) at
a meeting Tuesday morning at
St. Paul's Episcopal Church—
Father Hedger's church — at
Sixth Ave. and State St,

According to Joe Berry. Haas
decided Monday nlght to fell the
Tuesday assembly or local mln.
isters that “as far as i am
concerned, you have completely
separated yourselves from the
College,"

At the Tuesday meeting, how-
ever, Haas didn'o have till
chance or the inclination to
deliver his reprimand. They
began the meeting by inviting
representatives of campus Con-
cenied Black Students to a
special meeting of the assocb
otion which will probably bl
scheduled for tomorrow morn-
ing, April 13.

Only about hail of the churcheo
in town are actively represented
in the GMA, which has no na-
tional alllliation; several min-
isters who are active were ab-
sent from the Tuesday meeu'ng.

Monday night about ﬁfteen
students—mostly Negroes—met
in the SGA Board Room of the
Forum basement to draft lll
letter condemning the Grlilncll
community churches. The meet-
ing was planned shortly after
the Sunday rally by Farbes,
Thomas, and Berry.

The letter—ﬁnally signed by
SDS, Forbes (representing CBS)
and Thomas (representing, he
said, only himself) said the
death “oi Rev. Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King was a loss that oh
iects every man, woman, and
child in this country."

"The spirit of that man has
been tragically violated by the
indifference of the Grlnnell lead-

tinued. “But of sixteen

presence of students to accept
donations or to announce the

“The justification given by
these pastors,” tlte letter ex-

“I never intend to adjust my-

King had told the Grinnell

ter coiideming riots it is Hebe
essaiy to condemn just as vi.

People who ignore the ciuli

told the more-than-capacity

nasium, “are sleeping through
it revolution."

"Aliy individualaor nation——

also were cancelled at many
predominately white colleges

services were being held in cam-
pus chapels.

Most black students who were

King’s assassination already has

black militant movement.

Students who remained peace-

for Kings nonviolent principles,

BARASCH, PARSELL
FACE DEFERMENT LOSS

' Four Grinnell faculty mem-
bers have been reclassiﬁed LA
in the wake of the selective
service’s crack—down on oc-
cupational deferments.

Mr. David B. Parsell, French
instructor, was reclassified l-A
March 25th.

Mr. Delmar Pettys, music
lecturer and member of the
{cum Quartet, was reclassified
‘ last summer. No action
has been taken since then.

Mr. Stephen H. liarasch, Rus-
slan instructor, was reclassi-
hed LA at the end of March.

Mr. Neal A. Milner, political
science instructor, was reclas-
siﬁed l-A in March. However,

April.

A spokesman no the Jasper
County Draft Board minimized

reclassifying them but they're
not taking them as yet,” the
lpokesman said. “i guess they
will if it becomes necessary}

“The decision is up to tho
'drait boards," said a spokes-
man at the state headquarters
of the Selective Service. The
National Advisory Committee
advised the Selective Service
that a consideration of the
present economy did not point
out a need for any essential
list of occupational deierments,
he explained.

“The number of potential
Inductees on the faculties is
small.” he said. “We don't
foresee any call for men over 26

DoiT DRUG
STATEMENT

On April iii the Committee
of Thirteen minus Debbie
Friedman, passed nnanlmously
a statement on campus drug
use.

It states that the College,
"must not restrict those free-
ihms of thought, association,
and action which are the pre~

uisites of . . . personal de-
yelopment."

ln the statcment they voiced

belief in a student's right
:3 be free from punishment by

the College for a civil offense,
f the offense does not contra-
him “the educational objectives
if the College."

They urged the College to (1)
refrain from taking action

against students or
lolely bemuse of “drug in-
yolvement." (2) “provide its.
cilities where students can seek

rofessional counseling or med-
ical attenLion without punitive
action." and (3) "protect the
rights of students from searches
without legal warrant, paid in-
formers, and legal invesﬁgntlvo
methods."

The Council urges students
In become more informed on
the effects of dnlgs. as well

Mr. Parsell also is married.

Barasch was surprised to be

he is in his 4th year.

Other faculty members have

psychology professor, was re-
classified for a short time last
year when he was 26. He was
reinstated, however, after ver-
ifying his teaching position.

One man was told by the
draft board secretary that his
employer (Grinnell College) had
been tardy in sending the nec-
essary statement to them. His
l-A classiﬁcation was given in
an attempt to speed the state
ment to the draft board.

Another reclassified gentle-
man delayed his induction a
year and one-half by showing
that the draft board only gave
8 seconds of consideration to
his case.

A well-w i s h e r complained,
“Guys aren't imaginative
enough to get out of the draft.
I Could do it easy if I had to.
They always say they couldn’t
pass as homosexuals They just
don’t want to, that's all."

Cg? DADA

(Continued from Page 9)

their conversations. “This icy-
ous slavonic affirmative," says
Richter, “seemed wholly ap-
propriate, . . . .n powerful re-
iteration, ‘da,ila,' ‘yes,yes,‘ to
life."

The anti side of Dada is

much better known. Richter
says, “Our provocations, dema
onstrations, and defiances were
only a means at arousing the
bourgeoisie to rage, and through
rage to a shame-faced self-
awareness. Our real motive
force was not rowdiness, but
the question, basic as it is now,
‘wllat next?" Dada had a
"new artistic e t h l d (which
sometimes took) a positive,
sometimes a negative form, of-
ten appearing as art, and then
again as the negation of art,
at times deeply moral and at
other times totally amoral."
No wonder then that Dada had
no unified formal characteris-
tics like other styles have.

Shock was one of the faVa
or‘lte devices of anti-art Dada.
Works like Duchamp's Bicycle
Wheel had an instant impact
on the viewer~and that was the
end of it. Such pieces belong.
Richter says, in museums, not
galleries. Duchamp would
agree. The distinction is inter-
esting. A museum in for his-
torical relics, but a gallery,
Richter says, “is not there to
be walked through, even if
there are thousands of plc<
tures in them. . . They are
there for meditation—if only
that were still possiblel" Today
galleries are “offering the pub-
lic entertainment rather than
objects of contemplation, which
is what real works of m are.
1 still tblnk that one person
who meditates before I work
of art is worth more than
thousands who just gawk."

Richter notes that the museum
pieces of Duchamp and others
had their place. The bother is
that commercially successful
artists today (erroneously re-
ferred to as Neo-Dadaists) do
not understand that the recog-
nition of shock falls flat. Rich-
ter provides a devastating quo-
tation from Duchamp, "this New
Realism, Pop, assemblage, etc.
is on easy way out, . .when
I discovered ready-mades I
thought to discourage aesthet-
ics. . r they have taken my
rcady-mades and found aes<
thetic beauty in them. I threw
the bottle-rack and the urinal
in their races as a challenge
and now they admire them for
their aesthetic beauty."

The question of why nudia
ences clamor for coke-bottle
and comicastn'p “art" is an in-
teresting one. Richter concludes
that it is a peculiarly American
phenomenon. He quotes Huel-
senback, who laments that the
tools of Dada are being used
by “sensationvhungry galleries
eager for business." Richter
odds, “Art in this xero form has
taken on n . . . soda-psych»
logic-l mooning, no longer
transcendental, but therapeu-
tic.” Such an give: in to and
reﬂects n sick, sterile, society.
It assumes we are mi! of con-
trol of our lives, that “we are
lncapable of altering a hope-
less situation.”

“Let Me Entertain You" should be the theme of the coming
week here on our campus for as it shall become obvious we are
all going to be royally entertained. This week in the offing you
will tind Hayden and Dvorak, daisies to waltz among, dinner music
and Cornish lien, the continuation of the Grinnell Weekend lec-
ture series, Six student productions in Arena. the ilairing Skirts
of whirling folk dancers, an excellent selection ol movies and the
mock cOnVemionS scheduled for next Thursday and Friday.

The Museum as Tastemaker in Contemporary Art is the theme
of Grinnell Weekend which began yesterday with lectures on “Art
Education Today” and “The signiﬁcance or the College Art Mu-
seum.” Today there will be a coffee hour in South Lounge at 4.
A discussion on m[he Museum 'as A Showcase for Tomorrow‘s
Art“ Will be led by Thomas S. Tibbs, Director of Des Moines Art
Center, and Norman Geske, Director of the Sheldon Memorial Art
Gallery, Lincoln, not.

At 8 p.111. in Robert's Theatre, Mr. Sam Hunter from Cornell
University (N.Y.) will expose “Myth and Fact about the Museum
as a Tastemakerr" And to complement the entire weekend affair,
there are contemporary paintings from India, sculpture, and
various new acquisitions to the Grinnell Permanent Collection on
exhibit in Scheaffer Gallery.

Next on your agenda you will find Saturday night, labeled
formal with a capital F, and the once a year ﬂing which Grimell
really offers for “dressing to an occasion." This Superevening
will begin at 5:45 with Dithyrnmb Formal Dinner in the Quad-
rangle.

At 8 o‘clock the Lenox Quartet will be performing in
Robert’s Theatre. The evening's program will include works of
Haydn, Irving Fine, and Dvorak.

From there, our formally attired will promenade across cen-
tral campus to Darby where the Spring Formal Dance will begin
at 9:30. The Red Saunder‘s Bond featuring guest artist Mary
Wells will be providing this evening‘s orchestral accompaniment
of danceable music.

Sunday night in Robert's Theatre at 8 pm. you will enjoy
Grinnell's annual Folk Dance Concert. The evening will include
twenty<threo national folk dances from seventeen countries and
an extra special display of some of our faculty’s agility as they
perfom the Syrtari.

Moviegoers should especially enjoy the weekend because we
have three especially good flicks. Both Friday and Saturday
night the Strand Theater in downtown Gl-innell is offering admis-
sion to Wait Until Dark for 50 cents and your activity ticket. 0n
campus at 10 pm both Friday and Saturday nights Long Days

film regardless of the fact that Speech and Theater students are
required to learn about drug addiction from it. Sunday night at
to Apnrojlto, the second pan of a Hindu trilogY. will be shown
in ARH.

During the coming week slr one acts or cuttlng of plays will be
performed in the Arm as directed by the students of Acting and

challenging today, with their
lives as well as their art. They
are searching for art forms that
provoke awareness and contrlb<
ute to a revolutionary con-
sciousness. It is these artists
who are the true descendants
ot the pro-life strain of Dada.
In poetry there is Will lnman,
who publishes the poetry maga~
zine Kauri, a beautiful, pain-
ful outpouring of hon<
esty from lnman himself as
well as many other poets.

And there is El Corno Ema
plumado (the Piumed Horn),
the magnificent journal of po-
etry, prose and art, in both
Spanish and English, published
in Mexico by Sergio Mandra-
gon and Margaret Randall (a
superb example of revolutionary
nrt appears in the January is-
sue; it is a poem for Che
Guevara, “Che Comandante,"

by the great Cuban poet Nicolas
Guillcn). There are great signs
at lite in meater, particularly
Peter Schumann's Bread and
Puppet Theater in New York,
a sensitive and powerful group.
Certainly they fulfill Richter's
concept of transcendental and
socially-relevant art.

Even in Washington, D. (I.
there is the American Play-
ground which looks promising,
particularly now that it has a
music director, the young com-
poser James Stepleton, whose
best work surpasses dint of
Kurt Weill. Richter does not
mum these artists, or Ken-
neth Patchen, or even Allen
Glmberg and the rest of the
old San Francisco Renaissance.
But it will be clear to Moves
ment readers a! Richler's book
that yea-saying Dad-ists were

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

By lonN M. cuosscrr
(classics)

It is true that personal crises
drive us to philosophy. in the
harsh particularities of our
daily lives we seek the shooting
and justifying generalization.
Most such generalizations take
forms of proverbs and truisms,
the small change of philosophy,

But sometimes a personal
crisis of such intense magni-
tude confronts us that we can-
not be content with traditional
Wisdom; such wisdom seems to
us merely crudential, the re
sult of conventional and uncrit-
ical thinking -— for in our own
sense of anguished wisdom we
feel as alienated as Achilles.
We abandon the standards of
our society, of our age, of our
culture. of the world and na<
ture, and tom instead inwards
in order to ﬁnd there some
flaming and pure standard.
That source of inner ethical
wisdom is, generally, called
conscience.

Now the "war" in Vietnam
ls just such a personal crisis
for most Amerlcaus, and espe-
cially for the young men of the
country, who are belng asked,
and ordered to run the risk of
making what is called “the su-
preme sacrifice" for a cause
about which many have doubts.
We should observe that they
are being asked only to run the
risk of making such a sacri-
fice; were it absolutely certain
that each young man would
have to die or be maimed —
or to kill and to maim — the
problem would admit of a
much easier solution, at least
in so far as ethics is concern-
ed.

Few of us have difficulty in
making, decisions where the
choices are clear-cut; it is in
that imprecise area of doubt
and uncertainty, of darkness
and bewilderment, that our
souls become lost

It has seemed to me, in the
course of the past few years,
that more and more w ll mean-

 

chdﬁbhll' did ddhbblhhch

that mere fact lies reason to
challenge the popular notion
that consciences are individual,
that each man has his own,
that it is unique and personal
and hence beyond public scru-
tiny. Those who take their
stand on conscience cannot, in
all conscience, make con-
science a mysterious entity.

Historically, etymologically,
logically “conscience" is a
form of knowledge, and of
shared knowledge. The natural
questions arise: (1) what is it
knowledge of; (2) with whom
is it shared?

The oldest definition of con-
science which I know of in the
Western world is that given by
Antiphon, the Greek orator and
statesmen, in the iitth century
before Christ: “to know with
oneself that one has not Com-
mitted a homer-tin". The word
hammla — which Aristotle
uses to define tragedy and
which means “mistake." So
conscience in our oldest defini-
tion, then, means “knowing
with oneself that one has not
made a mistake," or —— in later
Christian terms — that one has
not sinned.

As modern clergyman and
atheist unite on this point, so
did ancient pagan and Chris-
tian. The permanence of the
definition is a striking Confir-
mation of the continuity to be
found in Western civilization
Both those who support and
those who attack what the
United States are doing in Viet-
nam act as they do because
they do not wish to have a se-
rious m' take or sin on — or
rather 'n" their Con-
sciences, They do not wish to
do what is wrong

The roots of the desire for a
clear conscience may be “con-

Now 1 would suggest that we
confine the analysis, for now,
to the word “mistake,“ for the
Christian term “sin” is too con-
troversial for rational discus-
sion. All of us, however, will
admit that we make mistakes
— or practically all of us:
there will always be someone
who will deny any proposition
But mere denial is not an argu-
ment, and if anyone wishes to
deny that he makes mistakes,
and to follow out the conse-
quences of his argument, I
shall be glad to accompany
him down to that dull spot-la.

Let us, then, take as tme
that men make mistakes; and
let us follow out the conse-
quences of that argument, We
shall not, I fear, much like
where it takes us, but beggars
for truth cannot be choosers.

Mistakes are not subjectiv
if you add up your bank-state-
ment incorrectly, you cannot
avoid either the fact or its con-
sequences by claiming that 5
and 3 equal 8 or 9 at will. You
may rename 5 and 3 and 8
and 9, but the reality will not
alter — unless, of course, we
elect to practice the solitary
and insane solipsism of Dustoy-
evsky’s “Underground" man or
collective — and equally insane
k solipsism advocated by
O'Brien and the Party in Or-
well’s 1984. In short, to know
that you have made a mistake
(hamam’a) is to recognize that
reality is objective and that
propositions accurately made
in accordance with reality are
true,

A clear “conscience,” then,
consists in knowing with one-
self that one has not made a
mistake, that is, that one's pro
positions and actions have been
made in accordance with the

The question is pertinent. in
answering it, we should begin
by observing this tact: if
ethics are not objectively
grounded statements about
reality, then the word "con-
science” is not applicable No
one who denies that objectiv-
ity of ethics can claim to be
guided by his conscience, for
he will be saying that he has
conscious knowledge of what is
unknowable.

I am perlectly willing to stop
here My principal point in
writing was to get those who
misuse and abuse the word
“conscience” to stop their de-
graded and debas'lng arglo
ment. If all those — like the
editor of the Pterodactyl or the
spokesman for the Vermont
Council of Churches —- who ap-
peal to conscience in opposing
the action of the United States
in Vietnam will substitute such
word as “feeling” or even
“op' on," a great and neces-
sary step forward will have
been taken in progress toward
a solution Conscientiously
speaking, such persons ought
not to use the word “can-
science."

Such an alm may seem trlv~
fall to some, a mere qiilbbling
about words. But Words, the
icons of ideas, have conse-
quences: men who are willing
to fly to Canada or to desert to
Sweden are surely engaged in
some serious decision and ac-
tion.

“Thus conscience doth make
cowards of us all," Hamlet
says: he is speaking in his
most famous soliloquy in
Shakespeare, in English, in the
World, which begins “To be or
not to be, that is the question.“
His specific problem is sui.

man's goal at least since the
Delphic oracle.

Canada and Sweden may well
turn out to be forms of “that
undiscovered country from
whose bourne no traveller re—
turns"; and those who elect to
“hear those ills we have” but
rather to “fly to those we know
not of.”

will they, for making the
choice, be better off? “Ay.
there’s the rub." i run arguing
that only by a full examina-
tion oi the word "conscience”
can the rub be smoothed out,
or at least made tolerable.

Are "consciousness" a nd
"conscience" no more than
“the pale cast of thought," as
a result of which we are “sick-
lied o'er"? Is the action —-
even if it take the form of a
decision not to act — as found
enterprise of great pitch and
moment?

The doctrine smacks of mere
existentialism, and atheistical
existentialism at that — the
exact opposite of Hamletﬁg
Christian conscientiousness. We
must never forget that Ham-
let’s problem arises irom pro-
found awareness of the super-
natural, from a ghost. Once
again those whose “con-
sciences” deny the existence of
objective and real and true
standards — whether grounded
in a "better nature or God” —-
cut the ground out from under
their own feet.

In a recent issue of the so«
called Grinnell “underground"
paper, the editor Richard
Schneirov devoted every page
to advocating resistance to the
draft. Two editorials appeared
in that issue: in one, the edit-
tor supported his own candl-
dacy for a post in the student
government; in the other, he
stated that resistance to the

» aptly symbolized in the con-
ventional and traditional beast-
imagery of hawk and dove —
by appealing to conscience.
The conscience is treated as a
kind of ultimate arbiter on su-
preme ethical questions.

Yet upon asking many men
and women What the con-
science is. I find that few have
any sense of what the word
means, or what it is that the
word denotes. Many of the
very same people who appeal
to the conscience deny its bio-
logical and physical existence;
they assert that there are no
absolute moral standards; they
argue against the existence of
God or the soul; and — ironi<
cally _ iind themselves being
counselled and supported by
men who dilier with them point
for point on each of these mat-
ters. Clergymen and atheists
find a common ground in con-
science. clearly such a funda<
mental term deserves some
critical attention,

Though etymology be a frail
reed tor the thinking of man
to lean on, we must clutch any
reed in the winds of doctrine.
Both in Greek and Latin, the
word “conscience" means, lit-
erally, "to know with.” And in

days, where we really mean
“taught" (paideia) — but it is
a “conditioning” that dates
back at least 2500 years, to the
wellsprings of both GrecoRo
man and JudanVChl'istian cul-
ture. The desire for a clear or
clean conscience is the essence
of conscience.

nature of things. Since reality
is objective, mistakes will be
universal. With this admission,
with this recognition, one must
abandon the whole notion of
conscience as something indi-
vidual, personal, merely sub-
jective, Conscience truly does
become a matter of ‘knowing,"
and of “conscious" knowing —
the roots of the word ”con-
scious” are the Same as those
Of “conscience,” Such is what
is meant by “knowing with

Thus far, however, we have
used examples drawn from the
simpler elements of reality,
those that are mathematical
and quantitative. (me might

BERLIN PR‘OTESTS
HEAD FOR VIOLENCE

BERLIN, March 29 (LNS) --
Contrary to expectations the

stration sponsored SDS (Social-
Ist Democratic Students) In
West Berlin on Feb. 17~IB went
0“ without mass violence.

Willi a crowd much larger
than anticipated —— the police
estimated 10,000 and SDS
claimed 20,000 _. t was all un<
deniable success in shortamnge
telms. What it means ill terms
oi the future of the West. Ger-
man student movement is not
so sure.

The movement is not a peace
movement, but mainly a radi<
cal Marxist anti-imperialist or-
ganization. it is certainly the
most radical student movement
in Europe. This is in contrast,
but probably naturally so, to
the abiding conservatism and
latent Nazism oi the West Ger-
man bourgeoisie.

Tile response of Berlin Citi-
zenry and Constabulary to stu-
dellt demands has been TepNS-
slon and police brutality.

The pattern of violent coir
irontation with the police in
Berlin has Continued unbroken
since June 2, 1967, when, In
clubbing and chasing demon~
strators protesting the visit or
the Shah oi trap, the West Bei-
lin police murdered 3 students
(They shot him, unarmed, in
the hack of the head.) Since
then clashes were irequent and
SDS became committed to ac<
cepting violence as on every-
day political tactic.

PRESS DISTORTS

Adding to the dangers of the
situation is the open provoca-
tion by the press owned by Alex
Springer (70 per cent of the
West Berlin press), which reg<
ularly distorts and lies about

the student movement and Ida
cites violence against it.

Using as an excuse some
trailicstopping sitrdown dem-
oustrations of several weeks
ago, the West Berlin city gov-
ernment banned the February
18 march. As Londoners trav-
clad in West. Berlin, rumors
were about that the authorities
would prevent us from entering
the city [or the Congress, SDS
decided that the march would
go on in any case, and its path
was straight to the U.S. mill-
taiy base; helmets and sticks
as the Zengakuren use were to
be issued to all participants for
defense.

MARCH LEGALIZED

Late Saturday, with the Con—
gl'ess in session and an agi-
tated Crowd collected, the West
Berlin Senat reversed Itself
and legalized the march up in
but not into the American seer

tor. The general understanding
was that the main pressure lor
this about-iaco came from
American military officials,
anxious to avoid the embar-
rassment oi students being
beaten and probably killed.
SDS chose to interpret this as
a victory, and to adhere to a
nonyioient tactic during the
demonstration. Provocaiion was
enormous and only the discl-
phno oi the marchers prevent-
ed street war-tare.

The police, relllsing to offer
protection to the demonstraa
tors, disappeared completely.
Along the march, provocateurs
pushed, tripped and punched
the demonstrators.

Al the filial rally at the
Opera (the scene OI the killing
oi Eenno Ohnesol'g on June 2)
they seized vict Cong and red
flags planted on surrounding
buildings by the demonstrators,
set fire to them, and threw
them into the crowd. At every
threat to the order oi the dem-
onstration the students would
chant in unison: “Nicht provo-
Ziel'en lasscn, nicht provozier-
en lasscn” (Do not be pro-
voked), this breaking the

steady rhythm oi “HoHo- Hos

chants.

—————-—————____~___________

By DAVID SALTMAN

FLORENCE, Italy, April 9,
'(CPS) — The ltalian student
movement is still in embryo,
and some skeptics say it has
addied in the oviduct.

Still, the kicking and squaw-
ling oi the iniant movement is
quite instructive to those in-
terested in the care and ieed-
ing oi student protest,

There had been Virtually no
action on the Italian student
scene until this year. It's pretty
clear that the activists here
were spurred on by Successes
oi well - organized protest
movements in Germany, Hol-
land, France and England. It’s
also clear that some of the
Italians didn’t bother to ﬁnd
out how to do the spadework
necessary for efieclive action.

The center oi student protest
here is Florence. Movements of
one kind or another have arisen
In Turin, Pisa, Naples and
Rome, but the Florentine move-
ment is by far the best organ-
lzed and most effective. In all
these cities, though, the issues
are the same: more student
control of the universities.

in italy the universities are
run by an incredibly archaic
system of “occupann” — old
professors who make policy for
an entire faculty. In the Unl<
versity of Rome's education
racuity, for instance, 35 old
men are virtual slavemasters
over the private and academic
lives of 9,000 students.

Lectures in the universules
are all delivered “ex calhedra".
This means that the old expert
drones on and on and you‘re
not allowed to ask ally ques-
tions. There are no small sec-
tions later on to discuss the
lecture.

The system was okay with

everyone until this year. There
had been periodic harmmphing
about education reform in the
Parliament, but it merely gave
legislators an excuse to say
“were doing everything we
can."

The combination of p u I) I I ll
apathy, bureaucratic sluggish.
ness, bureaucratic pompousness
and student sycophancy jelled
into astonishment when lhnu-
sands of students held a dem-
onstration in Piazza San Marco
this January 30.

it was a good demonstration,
from the students’ point oi view:
it was well-organized and wella
attended, it made a fetish DI
free speech and democratic tie-
baie about university reform,
and it got the cops out. Dozens
oi cops. swinging night sticks
and asking rnr identity cards
Cop photographers snapping pic-
tures of everyone in creation
“for future reference."

It also got Nicola Bovoli, 22,
into the hospital lor eye and
shoulder injuries due to stick-
\vork.

Bovoli has ﬁled suit with the
public prosecutor against the
chiei of police and the rector
of the university, because the
rector called the caps in the
lirst place.

So in Florence the students
have an absolutely golden issue:
police brutality, cops on cam-
pus, and academic reform. The
leiioi—center parties (Social—
Ist and Communist) are stauncllv
1y allied With the students and
are raising hell daily in the
Florence city council. There
are signs of a split between
those who just want the uni-
verslly to get out of politics and
those who want a political—but

the second issue can be resolved

The Florence demonstration
immediately sparked one in Tur.

blames the “revolt" on “8X<

24 cards turned in in Philadel-
phia, eight in Los Angeles, and
14 in Minneapolis. in Minneapo-
lis one card was also burned
while two other persons burned
army discharge papers. One at
the Los Angeles resistors had
three possible determents: as a
student, a minister, and a vet-
eran.

College towns were the sight
of the other demonstrations
with 30 Cards turned in at Yale
University in New Haven.
Conn; eight at the University
at Michigan, three at Princeton
Theological Seminary in New
Jersey; two at: the University
OI North Carolina; and four at
the University of New Mexico.
in New Mexico the FBI an-
nounced it was conducting an
“appropriate investigation” and
one Air Force enlisted man who
was carrying a sign saying
“hell, no, I won't go" was ur-
rested by military police.

Demonstrations were also
planned iur Cincinnati, St.
Louis, and Syracuse, N. Y., but
all were canceled.

As expected, there was an
increase over the number of
Cards turned In in December,
probably due primarily to the
abolition of graduate student
deferments, which draft resis-
tance leaders say has greatly
increased student inlerest in
their efforts.

EX LOCO
DYING

By RUSSELL ELLIOTT
5&3 Staff Writer

Ex Loco Parentis is dying.

According to Mike Pcnzner,
Smith sophomore and manager
oi the coffeehouse, “We can no
longer atiord the present estab-
lishment at 829 Broad. Our
lease is up in May."

In the past about 32000 has
been raised, largely through
grants from the Board of Re
llglon, SGA, and the Student
Initiative Fundr Other con-
trlbulors were alumni, iaculty,
students, President Glenn beg-
gett ($100), urea churches, and
the Class of ’61.

This money has paid for little
more than the heat bill and
rent, totalling about $1700, for
the two and a halt semester:
during which the Coffeehouse
has been open.

Penzner does not anticipate
receiving the funds needed m
keep Ex Loco alive next year.
He sees the prospects of find
ing a place that is cheaper and
closer to campus as being
“very dim."

“At times we've had prob-
Iems with publicity and pro
grams,” he admitted, “but
when we’ve been successlul,
the response has been tremen-
done."

have been given complete free-
dOm to delermine which candia
dates and issues go on the bal-
lot, as well as oiher policies.

That does seem to be the way
It is working. When the board
of directors met last week In
the Washington Hilton, there
was no one from Time at the
meeting as they wrangled over
the ﬁnal candidates and issues
which will go on Ihe ballot.

The directors were In Wash-
Ington for tour days. In between
meetings with everyone 1mm
President Johnson (“He looked
like a ghost," said one) to
leaders or the Young Republl»
cans, they spent long hours
picking the candidates, choos-
lng which questions would go
on the ballot, and wording the
questions.

with mostly liberals on till
board, they need special pro-
Menu in trying to make sure
that conservatives were new
ed ruirly on the ballot For
example, they had their hardest
time working the “hawks” al-
ternatives In Vietnam, which
most of them oppose (although
they generally refuse to give
their personal pos us on the
war and are obligated not to
endorse or work for any can-
did-ate).

FOUR CONSERVATIVE
CANDIDATES

They wound up with only two
conservatives on the ballot—
Reagan and Wallace, plus Nixon
and Johnson, who Will draw
many conservative votes. The
rest of the 14 candidates are
“moderate to liberal." Having
fewer candidates may work to
the right Wing's advantage,
however, Since moderate and
liberal votes will probably be
more fragmented.

At one point, when there were
about 20 people still on the bal-
lot, only three of them hard-line
conservatives, Harris told the
board, “Sometimes I wish I
hadn‘t picked all student lead-
ers and had just picked some
students out of the middle of a
big lecture hall. That list is
balanced much too heavily to
[he left.”

The candidates will all be
listed Iogether in alphabetical
order. Students will pick their
ﬁrst, second, and third choices.
The first choices will be used
to determine the winner, while
the second and third choices
will be used ior analysis.
Write-ins will be permitted.

Listed on the ballot lor Pres-
ident will be Democrats Robert
Kennedy, and Eugene McCar-
thy; Republicans Richard
Nixon. George Romney, Nelson
Rockefeller, Ronald Reagan,
Marla Hatﬁeld, John Lindsay.
Charles Percy, and Harold
stassen; plus iormer Alabama
Gav. Gearge Wallace (Ameri—
can Independent Party) and
Fred Halstead of the Socialist
Workers Party.

The directors wound up drop-
ping several other candidates,
including J, William Fullbrigl’lt,
Texas’ conservative Sen. John
Tower, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
and Gen. James Gavin, They
decided not to pare the list too
sharply, however, because they
wanted to give students a wide
variety. “The question,” said
Wisconsin student body president
Mike Fullwaod, "in whose

my rights. One wonders, l0!
Mr. Schnerov is no Psycho.

i do not wish, in lhese pal-ab
graphs, to attack or defend the
action of Ihe United States in
Vietnam. Horrible as that ac~
tian may be, it is a transient
and local matter, beneath
which lie principles or perma-
nent importance. My point is
to expose the iallaciuus rea-
sons given by so many of those
Involved tor their decisions and
actions.

If we are going to opposq
the “war”, than we ought to
do it on sound ground. Ali
alheistical or unnatural appeal
to conscience is fallacious, 9
two edged “petard” on which
the resisters will find them-
selves hclst if they but stop
to think. Perhaps drinking will
sickly them n'er and result in
just such a devastating paraly-
sis as grips Hamlet—but at
least then they would have th
grim consolation that they ha ,
joined in with the great tragic
heroes of the Western worldI
with Achilles. with Hamlet. A!
It stands, their model is real-
ly a misunderstood and dim
wrted Aeneas.

Western culture and civiliza-
tion have given us, in the great
books. models for all forms 01
conduct. By applying con:
sciousness we will, I believe'
be able to solve this particular
problem of conscience which
now disturbs us all, both inter-
nally and externally. in Shortg
I am arguing that paldeia—even
that debased form of paidell
which is the modern small
liberal arts college—is the pro-
per means by which to reach
the end. And so far as I can
tell from the illiterate state~
merits generally made about
conscience, damned few of those
who appeal to conscience haVI
tried this means.

choice is Choice, our choice or.
the students' choice?”

AVOID RADICAL BOYCOTT

They also spend a good deal or
time trying to avoid a boycott
of the electlon by campus radi-
cals. Harris said he found radi-
cals cool to the idea in hll
visits to campuses. Most rad-
icals reject electoral politics as
a means oi changing policy.
They are also likely to be skop.
tical of an election involving
large numbers of college stu.
dents, most of whom are moder-
ale and unlikely to vote radical.

So. although a number or
doves made the ballot almost
automatically, the directors de»
cided that there might not be
enough involved radicals, As an
answer they added Fred Hal-
stad, who is running for Presi-
dent from the Socialist Worker.
Pany on a plattorm of black
power and immediate with-
drawal from Vietnam.

One of liarris’ answers to rad»
lcals is that “tworand-arhalt
million Americans ought lo be
able to have some impact on
the policy or the country." That,
then, is the key question about
Choice ’58: will it have any im-
pact on American policy and on
the election? If it doesn't (and
it has so far been ignored at
least by most of the press),
then radicals will have addition-
al prooi at their view that stu-
dents must take direct action
to inﬂuence policy.

SCARLET AND BLACK

WHERE

Grinnell started his town on
the prairie where he thought
northesouth and east-west rall-
mads would cross. A century
later, the North Western and
Rock Island trains Sllll rum-
ble through town, beckoning
the restless to travel on.

The C&NW offers two freight
trains north and south dallyt
sauth in the early morning
north in the late morning;

both ways in the middle Elf the
afternoons

The CREW alters a more
vaned dlet: twu passenger
trains (2:29 p.m. and 2:44
p.m.); two mail trams (2:22
am, and 4:21 a.m.); seven reg-
ular freight trains running
throughout the day: extra
iraights running anytime.
