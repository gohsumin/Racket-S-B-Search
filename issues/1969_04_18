Black Position Disputed

New left Panel Divided

By TED GLICK

"The enemy to all of us is the group
controlling the wealth of the world, and
this group doesn’t mind oppressing any-
one to maintain their power.” So spoke
Andrew Young, Executive Director of
the Southern Christian Leadership Con-
terence, in Herrick Chapel on Wednes<
day night.

Ernest Chambers, black militant from
Omaha, agreed with Young but was
cynical or any whites taking the steps
which he ielt necessary to achieve an
end to this oppression and exploitation.
in speaking of whites in the audience he
said, "if i were to get up and say you
should tight for tlle flag, [or A. T. Sc T.-
ror the United Fruit Company. you'd
be stonipln' and cheerin’ ”.

Chambers also [tell that Young’s belief
that those who are paying taxes are
thereby complying with the war in Vlet—
nam to be of little consequence to the
issue of “black liberation”. He said,
“How can you equate paying taxes with
being a Slaveholder?”.

in the question-and-answer session aft-
erwards, the main topic was the feasibil~
lty of Violence as opposed to non-violence
to achleve black freedom.

Chambers used the Bible to show that
the violence was not that of blacks but
rather that of whites. He said, “The

REV. ANDREW YOUNG, SCLC

Bible is like a two-edged sword — you
can use it to shackle us, but I can hand
it back to your . .The Bible is iull 01
blood and violence People who tell me
to be non-violent are the same ones who
put stock in the Bible.”

Young first stated that the use of the
word non-Violence was misleading. He
pi-eierred to use the term “unarmed
struggle" to refer to what is commonly
called non-violence. Young further be-
lieved that the issue of Violence and
"unarmed struggle" has been used to
divide the black community, He said,
"The talk of black violence has created
an atmosphere of repression The propa-
ganda oi the mass media has said that
it is the blacks that are violent, but lit-
reality it is the whites who are the vitr
lent ones.” He believed that this is evi-
dent in the white establishment’s swltt
reaction to any movement among blacks
addressing itselt to the issue or tree
dam from the slavery they have suffered
tor over 300 years.

The Wednesday night panel discussion
was part of this week’s Conference on
New Politicsi Thls afternoon at 4:15 Jer-
ry Rubin will speak, and at 8:00 tonight
I—lal Draper. of the magazine New Polb
tics, will give an address —- both talks
being so Herrick Chapel.

IN US FIRST MEETING, the Senate appointed a committee to screen appli-
cants for standing committees, and decided to put up a bulletin board in the post
oitice to uhlicize senate activities. They also appointed a committee to investigate

the possi

lily of general campus wide assemblies, and passed a resolution support-

ing the current petition regarding student attendance at faculty meetings.

‘Somebod Has to be Creative"

New Look to Senate

By ALICE ROGOFF

On Monday, April 14, approximately
66% of the student body cast their votes
and elected Lynn Aldrich, Andrew Brill,
Reggie Graham, Andy Loewi, Bill Thom~
as, Allen Hammond, Art Knowles, David
Broadwell, write-in candidates, have
Feldman, and Bill Stranger, as then“
new Senate.

The night before the Senate elections,
the candidates and about titty interested
students sprawled around the South
Lounge to exchange their Views. A clus-
ter of students surrounded each candi-
dale in an attempt to understand what
the role of the Senate could be.

Some oi the candidates suggested using
the Senate as a creative force to initiate
student interest; as a “sounding board";
or as a coordinating committee tor stu-
dent ideas. Many students questioned
how the amorphous aims tor student
participation and communication could
he changed into practical programs ol
action,

The candidates welcomed greater int
voivement in student government and
offered ways tn obtain it. Andy Loewi’s
approach would be “to go out and but-
tonhole people {or ideas." Bill Thomas

he represented about. Thomas felt that
“the Senate should serve as an lllim‘lliér
tion body to tell the student body what
they can do . Responsibility lies in
student attitudes; students have to be
made aware that they can go to the
Senate."

Proposed ways of improving communi-

cation between the student body and
the Senate included having Senators go
to hall meetings, open Senate meetings,
general assemblies, and the distribution
oi pamphlets with the questions to be
discussed at each Senate meeting before
the meeting it was generally tell. that
the Senate meetings need more publicity
to attract the attention and interest of
the student body.

Changes in both academic and hail
life were supported by the candidates.
Innovations that were discussed were a
noagrade Option, more student initiated
courses, more housing alternatives, and
inner college, and a counselling service,
It was hoped that academic life and hall
life could become more related to each
other by using residences for educational
projects. Andrew Brill summed up the

Air Force Undermines
Faculty Stand on ROTC

The Air Force recently announced
plans to discontinue ROTC at eight uni<
versities and colleges, Grlnnell included.
The minimum required Out-put of fifteen
officers had not been met at these
schools. The Air Force maintains that
this is due to lack of student interest
and denied that the Air Force is under
pressure irom anti-war groups or facility
members. The schools dispensing with
the program are: Butler University, Ins
dianapolis. lndiana, Capital University,
Columbus, Ohio, Illinois institute of
Technology, Chicago, Kenyon College,
Gambler, Ohio, Lawrence Universny oi
Wisconson. Appleton, Wisconsin. Tuits
University, Medlord, Massachusetts, and
Grinnell.

Despite the removal of ROTC ii-om sev.
eral campuses, 157 units remain on cam4
puses throughout the nation General
Westmoreland reported that Almy mid
is in demand and several new detach-
merits will be initiated within the nexl
year,

The decision of the Air Force com
tlicts slightly with the movement by
the faculty at Grinnell to discredit the
course. The committee headed by Mr.
Kissane, developed to consider the ad-
visabilicy of continuing the College's
contract with the AFROTC, wlll be dis«
solved The present problem concerns
the “phasing out” of the program. Thu
Air Force plans to withdraw by the
summer oi 1972, suspending enrollment
of new students as of September 1969.

The faculty voted to remove credit
from the ROTC unit in the fall of 1970.
A petition, signed by 445 students and
read at Monday's faculty meeting, re
quested iaculiy reconsideration of their.
decision to discredit ROTC. The petition
supported continuance of credit until the
detachment withdraws. This will allow
freshmen and sophomores now in the
program to complete the program With
credit. The faculty committee on Aem<
space will examine this possibility and
make recommendations to the iaculty.

2 Students Attend Closed Meeting

Faculty Hears Case for Open Meetings

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The proposal that students be allowed
to attend faculty meetings was formally
presented to the faculty Monday after-
noon by Mike Brandon and Dan ClleiietZ,
representing the SGA. Before the meet-
ing, copies of their proposal Were dis-
tributed to each iaculty member, stat-
ing the reasons for the request.

Brandon and Cheitetz said they be-
lieved that students “should have the
opportunity to participate in the decision-
making processes that aiiect their edu<
cation and the college community of
which they are a segment.” They feel
that student presence at faculty meetings
“would not only improve communication
between faculty and students in matters
or mutual concern, but would also pro-
mote responsible student involvement ill
academic afiairs." Open meetings would
“insure the greatest degree of student

participation and faculty-student come
munication."

Instead of asking that all students
be able to attend these meetings. they
asked that at least the Council of Thin
teen (the Senate) be allowed to attend.
They also asked that the three student
presidents (C of HP, AWS, SGA) be al-
lowed to speak at the meetings. Brandon
explained that this was a “tactical man-
euver" employed because they felt the
iaculty would he more reluctant to admit
the whole student body, rather than a
small segment. They do not see this as
an “elitist" move, but rather a minimum
request, for they actually ieei that an
students should be allowed to observe
the meetings,

The matter was discussed at consider-
able length at the Monday meeting, but
no vote was taken. Another proposal
that would allow any student to attend
the meetings was also suggested by I
faculty member.

Where the Truth Hurts

ny roivt THOMAS

Following the Playboy demonstration
and the subsequent releasing of state-
ments to the alleged demonstrators‘
parents, the Student Senate lorinally re-
quested that the Judicial CounClI examine
the actions of the Deans’ Office in this
instance. (For a copy of the letter, see
Presnient Leggett's statement, 5&B,
April 4th.) The Senate resolution 9X.-
prcssed the belief that the Deans’ actions
were not in accordance with the tenets
of accepted administrative practice and
that the present lack of stated college
policy called for an examination and
clariﬁcation of guidelines to he used in
future cases.

In a somewhat less than ringing de-
cision, the Judicial Council informed me
this Week that "after Considering your
request . this council finds no grounds
for action in this specific case.” No ex«
planation was given i believe this action,
or rather lack of action. represents an
abdication of responsibility, a submission
to administrative desires, a betrayal of
student rights, and an oversight ot riue
process. To explain:

Although the SGA constitution (ap-
proved by the faculty) gives to the col-
lege responsibility for taking tempor-
ary action in emergency situations “in-
volving student and community wel-
fare,” and it is on such grounds that
the Deans, in part, delend their actions,
the Constitution also specifically states
that the ultimate disposition of the case
shall rest with the judicial council.

As soon as the Senate resolution was
passed, several administrators declared
that they felt the judiCial council had
no right to hear the Case. This subtle
pressure increased over the two month
delay before the council actually met
to consider the issue. As one adminis»
trator ﬂatly told a judicial council mem-
ber, “I do not want this case heard."

 

A Word of Warning Abouf the Draft

By LEE MARIL

There are only a few short weeks left
until graduation. One must. somewhere
between the panic over RE. require—
ments, overdue papers, and comps, sit
down and begin to think over what is
going to happen when graduation is
over and done with. For most senior men
it means the draft and all the maze
of problems associated with it The leg-
endaiy air ot mystery and fear which
surrounds the draft remains pure myth;
everyone gets draited unless there is a
good excuse and not thinking about it,
blotting it out of one’s mind, or planning
one’s life as it it did not exist at all,
just a bunch of loolish crap

Most senior men seem to have some
idea of either enlisting or of somehow
evading the draft, But this “somehow"
grows vaguer and more abstract as the

questions get more specific. If you ex-
pect to get a physical deferment, then
you do not get one by complaining tor
two years to your friends about your
sore kneel What is needed is a complete
documentation signed by a doctor (5)
who know your case. The same may be
said for an occupational deierment or a
Conscientious Dbjector and when all is
said and done, it is up to the idiosyn-
crasies or your local board. in each
case a certain amount of work is roe
quired NOW on your part to avoid the
hassle and panic which i guarantee will
accompany you home this summer. it
is still not too late, but don’t push your
luck.

It you don’t know what you are going
to do about the draft. then I would sug-
gest three things. First, talk to some
one who really knows what it is all about,

preferably a draft counselor, for exam-
ple (mic, or others in iowa city and
Des Moines. Often just talking to some-
one in the same situation helps. Second,
get a lawyer if you can, they are utten
free and, of course, are of great value.
Third, lace the fact that the draft is
out to get you but that, nevertheless,
you need not let it; act now, not when
it is too later

Don’t put yourseil in the position or
denying personal values by getting
pushed, pressured, or shoved into the
armed services without really knowing
your legal rights. Decide what you are
going to do in the relative calm or
orinnell College where lamiiy and com-
munity pressures are at a minimum.

Evolve an active plan with alternatives,
stick to it, and trust your counselors and
lawyer,

The student Bill of Rights guarantees
(but apparently only when movement)
that a student is presumed innocent
until proven guilty, The Deans (and
hence, the college) have declared that
the students impulsively damaged the
institution without an attempt or even
subjective proof. The “identification"
process is equally open to question. The
judicial council however. would seem
to believe that the "proof of guilt” so
boldly touted is, in fact, the final deci<
sum of the Deans’ Office.

in reaching their decision not to tie
aide (is this to happen in every case?)
the JudiClal Council appears as oblivious
to accepted practice as do the Deans.
Neither the Senate nor its chairman
were informed of the “hearing." If the
council wishes to maintain even the
slightest ties to due process, One would
think they could at least exercise the
courtesy or allowing those who requested
a hearing to be present to detend that
request. Mrs. Low, of course, was pre-
sent to justify the administration posi-
tion.

This action of the judicial council
raises the fundamental question of the
viability of such a structure iii any area
other than the peripheral. Where are
students to seek recourse from adminis-
trative whims if they are barred from
the threshold of the very institution that
is constituted to afford such protection?
is the council to be but another body
to legitimate administrative decisions
before the college community. it is
the responsibility of both students and
faculty, who jointly sanction the council,
to demand a reconsideration of this
cioacal (look this one up, kiddies), sub<
servient evasion.

Shape up for Relays

Things seem to be shaping
up for the Pioneers after
a slow season start. Last Satur-
day at the Cornell Relays, by
far our toughest meet yct, Grin-
nell placed in three events and
gained a 5th and our position in
two others.

Doug Lewis placed second in

Thor Evenson took a third in
the high jump with do”, his
best effort this season (65%”
won the event).

Bill Schooler, Gordv Abel,
Gary Jones and Paul Lewis
swept to second in the BSD-yd.
relay, sixth in the din-yd. re<
lay, and 5th in the sprint med-
ley.

The irosh relay team of Jon
Stein, Carl Brennen, Neil Onet-

grabbed second in the sprint
medley. Nell, Carl, Steve Hir-

second in the mile relay.

The Pioneers travel to Cedar

provide informal recreation and
also money and equipment tot
spontaneous events. in keeping
with this philosophy, SRA do-

Change in Administrators

By DAVID swer:

This week, President Leggett oiiiclally
announced changes that will be made in
the Dean's Ofﬁce next fall. Dean Th0mp<
son (’58) will continue editing the
alumni magazine as well as handling
students' curriculum problems. But he
will no longer be called a dean, which
Is the title he has held since he came
here in ’64, and will be moved out of
his present location in the dean's oiiico
next fall,

At the same time. the college is in-
terviewing applicants tor another job.
that of Associate Dean of Students.
This dean will take on the same responsi-
bilities that Dean Low now handles. That
Is, he will be concerned with student life,
especially with respect to the residence
halls. He will also be involved in person-
al and group counseling for both men
and Women students.

Dean Low, Dr. Walker, Dean Stauss.
and President Leggett will make the
iinal selection They are fairly sure
that they want a man [or the position,
although there would be no designation
of women's and men's deans. Aside from
this, there is some controversy as to the
exact role of the new dean. For exam-
ple, a black man has been interviewed
for the job, and some members of the
administration feel that in the case that
he is hired, part of his job should be
working specifically with the black stu.
dents on campus. Others take the View
that someone else should be hired for
this role, and that the associate dean
should be solely concerned with student
life in the same manner as Mrs. 10w.
regardless of race. Obviously, the job
will be tailored, to some extent.

Siuuss To Join
Colorado College

James ii. Stauss has been appointed
executive vice president and provost of
Colorado College, beginning August 1, it
was announced last Friday.

He will become the chief administra-
tive officer under the president of the
college, Dr. Lloyd E. Worner. Stauss
will be specifically responsible for de-
velopment in addition to working closely
with the president on long-range planning
and general affairs.

“it will be a great reassuranoe to
have him with us as we move into times
which represent for the independent bol-
lege both extraordinary opportunity and
great fiscal concern", commented Presi-
dent Worner.

Friday April is, not

Is A Tea Party Obscene?

February 6 is seeming farther and
rarther away. in the Playboy demonstra<
tors' case the wheels oi justice are grind-
ing so slowly that it is questionable just
what they are grinding.

On diippinggreenhouse Monday, the
eight demonstrators hosted a post-ar-
raignment reception in Conierenco
House. The arraignment was handled by
their lawyer. Dan Johnston, Monday
morning,

Formal engraved invitations requested
the presence of people who had been
involved with the case. Raspberry red
punch with purple flowers iloatlng in it
and mamamade cookies were swal-
lowed unpremeditatedly. People, sitting
standing, and lying, talked about are
raignrnents and birth control and the
time oi day.

An “indecent exposure" trial seemed
ridiculously incongruous. But some
time between now and next {all there
will be one. The Poweshiek District
Court Judge is not sure when he will get
to hear their case. it seems that many
people are seeking justice these days.

If the trial were to be held this sum.
mer or next fall it would be unfortunate.
Witnesses and participants would have
to come lroin long distances and there
would be little chance for student sup-
port. The delay in setting a trial date,
the disproportionately intense investiga-
tion, and the unnecessary hearings raise
the question of whether the wheels of
justice are grinding at all. As it becomes
later and later, the situation takes on a
more and more Kaikacsque air, (a
Molly Malcolm term).

SAGA F lies High

Another SAGA extravaganza” A
chance for revenge on Chuckll

This Sunday afternoon, Mac Field will
be the scene of the First SAGA All-cams
pus Kite-Fly, with lots of added attrac-
tions. Prizes (events and judges to be
determined) include dinner for two at
IDs, and so, yes, thirty cream pies
to be thrown at the stationary target or
none other than SAGA Chuck himself.

A picnic supper will be served iollow.
ing the frolicking. In case of rain, the
KiteFly Will be held in Cowles Dining
Hall.
