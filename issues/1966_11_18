“Had we but world enough and time .

Marvell’s ancient

complaint will receive an intellectual answer in the form or Grin-

nell's reinstated interim Pro-
gram, ”an opportunity to pair-

the semester framework.” As
approved by the iaculty, in<

Monday, January 9, through
Friday, January 13.

On the agenda for partici-
pants are three kinds of intel-
lectual activity. Students may

dents involved in second SE-
mester independent projects);
privately organized study
groups, planned intormal semi-
nars, or B combination of
these activities.

Interim will offer coiled
hours on premarital sex, cy-
bernation and automation,

This Tuesday, Nov. 22, at 4:15
p.m. inthe South Lounge, senior
Steve Shender and sophomore
Joseph F. Kennedy will debate
the question: “Shall We Stand
in Viet Nam?" Kennedy will
take the aiflrmative and Shen-
der the negative. Charles Ran.
som, editorial writer tor the
Des Moines Register and Trib-
une, will be the moderator.

“The reason i organized this
debate,” said Kennedy, "is that
I feel only one side of the Viet
Nam question has been ade-
quately presented on this can'l~
pus. While 1 sympathize with
those who oppose our Viet Nam
policy and while some of their
reasons ore legitimate, on the
Whole l think their Views are
shortsighted. Generally I don't
think the domino theory has
been disproven and what is at
stake ill Asia is the fate of 325
million people."

Shender declined to make any
comment on the topic beiore
the debate Tuesday.

The debate will consist of two

An AWS Board-CofHP proposal eliminating women's hours
passed the Student Senate Wednesday night. The Faculty Commit-

tee on Student Ailairs, to re
ceive the resolution Tuesday,
will have 30 days In which to
recommend and refer it to
President Leggett, who will
present the measure to the
trustees.

The tollowing remarks pret-
aced the hours‘ elimination pro-
posai;

”Reassessment oi the stu-
dent role in the college com-
munity has resulted in a real<
lzalion or basic philosophic ins
consistencies regarding expec-
tations of students and a fur-
ther realization oi the need
to overcome these inconsis-
tencies by changes in the
rules governing student con-
duct. . .

“Emphasis in discus-
sion has been placed on the
individual, his needs and his
potentialities and the impor-
tance or permitting him to
express and develop them. Al<
lowing students to exercise
irecdom or choice and person-
al judgment becomes is neces-
sary, calculated risk, depend-
out upon trust and conﬁdence
in the student, and the under-
standing and cooperation oi
the other members of the col<
lege community. . .

“The demands ior uncriti-
coi acceptance oi general
standards necessitated by n
rigid social system are lacun-
slstent with the critical anal-

ysis demanded in academic
areas or the community.”

Both the AWS Board and the
Coil-lP passed resolutions ask-
ing that the change in hours be
instituted at the beglnning of
second semester. Although the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs has met with the AWS
Board and the CofHP, and the
trustees are aware that the pro-
posal is under consideration,
President Leggett has not yet
been involved in discussions of
the measure.

The principle recommenda-
tions of the Student Senate pro
posai read as ioliows:

“In line with the elimina-
tion of Women’s hours, the
following suggestions regard-
ing closing hours tor the Quad
are proposed:

The loggia will be locked at
midnight during the week and
It 1:00 AM. on Friday and

ing or returning after loggi-
ciosing hours will do so at

en’s residence halls after 10:30

The Sudan, the largest country in Africa (one million
squure miles), became independent in January, 1956, as a
result or a unilateral declaration of independence, which was
quickly recognized by the two codomini, nrltain and Egypt,
each for its own reasons. History has accidentally and artifi-
oially out the Northern and Southern Sudan into one country
—- the Sudan. The result Ill this is now one of the bloodiest
Ind most ieroclous civil wars in the world.

The outside world knows very little about what is going
on in the Southern Sudan, because, for obvious reasons, the
Khartoum government does not allow foreigners to travel
ireely in the Southern Sudan. Nevertheless, a newsman lrom
the Daily Mail whose mlcle appeared in the Washington
Post (Feb. 20, 1966) managed to go to the Southern Sudan —
illegally, oi course. He observed:

“For mile alter mile in this wlldemess, the wreck ot
civilization meets the eye: the burned-out shells of Mrlcan
villages out to the torch by Arab troops oi the Sudunese army.
Where now then worked Ind children played and cattle
grazed there Is now no sound except the coughing or baboons
and the wind rattling the dagger spikes oi thorn trees. . . .
The people or the Southern Sudan are dying in tholsande For
some death Wines via the Arab bullet, as happened in the
tub: Massacre (July less) when either 400 (government
sources) or not) people (refugee sources) were killed in one
bloody night."

The result of this mankilling has been a collapse of
trade, administration, and agriculture. Communications have
been destroyed, and the lat commercial enterprise of any
significance, that was run by a subsidiary 01 British Ameri-
can Tobacco, has been abandoned, leaving behind a crop
worth about 8 million (U.S.) dollars. A state of emergency has
been in force since I was in grade school.

From such n wild state of malls, relugees (l urn one 0!
them) have fled into nelghborhg countries: Kenya, Uganda,
Ethiopia, The Central African Republic, the Congos, and
Chad. There are estimates that over I million Southern Su-
danese have either fled the country or died. Some or these
rclugees m in camps under nominal UtN. inspection, but the
majority of them are crammed, sometimes do to a hut, in
border villages. Others are students eager to learn with no
body to support them financially. My present interest lies in
these young men. Some of my triends in Tracy, Minnesota
and San Francisco are now sponsoring eight at these rehrgee
studean in African high schools. It costs between 100 and 2M
U.S. dollars to educate a student for one year in high school:
Some of these sludents will be qualiﬁed tor U.S. college
studies by next month, and I hope to be able to find enough
tunds from sympathetic sources to bring them over to study
in the U.S. The Grinnel’l College Student Senate has already
endorsed a proposal to have a fast on campus. The money
will go toward this cause.

if you would like to help, please send your contribution,
which will be deeply appreciated and gladly received, to
Dean Richard H. Winters, Grinnell College, Grinnell, town
50112. i will gladly answer any questions to the best ot my
present knowledge of the situation in Southern Sudan.

Dunn Tells D.M. Slums'l
Needs. Accomplishments

By DAVID DlLLON

The most urgent response to the poverty of Des Moines' South-
east Bottoms is to communicate to the residents that they are hu-
man beings, according to Jim
Dunn, director or the Southeast
Side Project which has aided
the citizens in forming a com-

parks and pool halls. Their par-
ents have been reduced by the
same pressures in the Mk-

munity organization. Once they
have been led to recover the
sense of worth the power struc-
ture has denied them, they will
press for improvements in
streets, traffic control, housing.
and plumbing as a natural con—
sequence.

Dunn led a meeting in the
Forum and a later dlnner dis-
cussion with interested students
Tuesday evening. He said that
his experience in community
organization of Chicago’s West
Side had revealed to him the
extent 0! rejection sustained by
youth in poverty areas. Racial
discrimination sharpens this
despair, leading the youth to
term a society of its own in the

ways at subservience, verbaliz-
ing platitudes to the white em-
ployers and landlords on whom
their subsistence depends.

The living conditions on the
Southeast Bottoms were pur-
trayed as unlit on human oc-
cupation, Eighty per cent or
the homes are dilapidated; an
equal proportion have outdoor
toilets. in one area, forty to

holder is becoming ill because
her outdoor toilet is too close to

Valid Generalizations

When is this school going to

time the administration ended
the existence of the Grinnell {lei

sponsibility lot their own ac-
tions. it is a truly ieudal or tu-

but it is one which bears repeat-
ing.

This college is not living up
to its ideals as a liberal arts
college. These ideals should in-
clude e willingness to change,
to evolve, with respect to the
norms which exist and pass
away every moment. But what
do we have? We have a group
of men cast in a mold of Vic-

upon themselves the responsibili»
ty ot determining what the ab
solute truths of college life are.

it does make life rather easy,

though. We don't have to worry
about what we’re going to do
after midnight. it is all decided
for us. We go home and say
“hi” to our friends, study dili-
gently, and go to bed at decent
hours. And, of course, we will
all leave here as decent, up-

Speaks at SDX Convention

Gallup Calls Vlel Nam Leading Election factor

By HENRY WlLHELM

Dr. George Gallup, speaking
at the Sigma Delta Chi National
Journalism Convention, said a
"protest vole" over Viet Nam
was the most important under-
lying taetor in the nationwide
shift to the Republican Party in
the recent election.

Gallup, Director of The Amer-
lcan Institute of Public Opinion,
and well known for his “Gallup
Polls”, said this vote was not
an expression or disapproval of
the Administratiah's handling of
the war; rather, it was a symp-
tum of the desire. on the part of
the average American, that
some new leadership can be
found which will be able (O ne-
gotiate an honorable withdraw-
al irom Viet Nam. Gallup
claimed that this “Viet Nam
protest vote" was a much more
important factor than “white-
backlash" in most localities. He
said, however, that “white-
backlash” was a signiﬁcant lac—
tor in some cities such as Chi-
cago and in some of the south-
em states.

Former Editor

Dr, Gallup, who attended The
University of lowa and was edi-
tor of the campus paper. made
a sweeping attack on the Amer-
ican political system and on
politicians in general. While not
referring to any statistics, Gal-
lup said, “The public is ted up
with the way we conduct cam-
paigns in this country; they are
fed up with the length ol cam-
paigns, the amount of money
spent. the nameacaliing, and
the avoidance of serious discus-
sion of issues." Gallup sug-
gested that a limit be put on
the amount of money a candi-
date can spend, pointing out
that Rockerieller spent nearly
5 million dollars of his personal
tunds in the New York election.

Distrust of Politics

Citing the current “credibility.
gap," Gallup commented, “our
polls ﬁnd a great deal 01 disr
trust about people in political
life.” He noted that in Eng.
land, where the amount of
money that a candidate can
spend and the length of a cam-

stitute of Public Opinion. tpeaks to newsman at the
Sigma Delta Chi convention in Pittsburgh Nov. II.

paign is regulated, people gen-
erally have a great deal more
lalth in politics. In a sweeping
statement Gallup said, “Ameri-
can politicians will never, ever
write an issue on a ballot that
makes any sense. They are al-
ways up to their old tricks.
Take the case of the New York
Civilian Review Board: it was
worded in such a way that the
"No” meant “Yes” and the
“Yes” mean! “No". it took a
concerted campaign by the
newspaper's to straighten this
out."
Faith in Public

Gallup said that in his 31 years
at polling tile American public
has made him an “evangelist
of democracy.” He went on to
say “The Public’s opinion is
generally extraordinarily sound
and is generally ahead or
elected leaders in bemg pre-

Scarlel and Blue

pared to make changes in the
political system." lie said the
public is not influenced to any
great extent by billboards, spot
television ads, public handa
shaking, and kissing babies.
Again not giving any statistics,
Gallup said, “we have evidence,
tons of evidence, that bumper
stickers do not generally have
any inﬂuence on the voting pub<
llc." He said that people want
to hear what a politician has to
say on specific issues and “all
of these ancient primitive ritu-
815, such as the national con-
ventions, are a lot a! nonsense

Gallup called tor an open pri-
mary to replace the convention
system pointing out that had
there been on open primary in
the 1964 presidential election.

form of graduated restrictions

thing, but that is beside the
point.

The point is that some of

section where the City has so
far refused to place a slopligbtl

Despite these conditions, the
people have not completely lost
hope. A 9cycarcld woman re—
peats to Dunn each time she
sees him that she plans to move
away sometime. A resident who
called Dunn a “fool” two years
ago for attempting organized re-
dress now says, “I think we’ro
going to make It." What are the
causes {or this renewal of
spirit? Repeated attempts at
group protest seem to have
brought fourth a rekindled
awareness or personal dignity.
A delegation confronted a great-
ly chagnncd traffic engineer
with a demand for a stoplight;
it this is not met, the delegates
told the official they would go
into the street as human beings
and halt traffic until the light
was installed.

In another demonstration of
neighborhood seltcxpression, a
group from the Southeast side
attended a City Council meet-
ing which was considering pro<
posals tor the construction or
costly apartments in the area.
The neighborhood group pre
seemed an alternative plan, ap-
proved by an architectural con-
sultant, tor badly needed low.
cost housing in the vicinity.

Dunn believed that the atti-
tude or the municipal authori-
ties is well illustrated by a con-
versation b e t w e e n Mayor
George Whitmer and the Rev.
Frank Kroll, a supporter oi the
Southeast Side Project. The
minister was told: “I think you
should get your rabble-rousers
the hell out of here!"

Although Dunn is an advu<
bate oi non - violent social

neglect could bring severe riots
in this area of Des Memes; the

Gates lecturer Relates Religion um! Science

By MARTHA BERKEY

The Rev. Ernan McMullin,
head of the department of phil«
osophy at the University of
Notre Dame, delivered the fifty-
Second annual Gates Lectures
Novi 13-15 in a presentation
which cut broadly across cur-
ricular lines, and seemed to ap-
peal to the Grinnell pride in the
true liberal arts tradition. Sub-
jects ranging iron-i the history
of philosophy to the genetic ba-
sis of life, from mathematics to
the United Nations, and lrom
the Dead Sea Scrolls to the big
bang theory of the origin oi the
universe, were combined with
subtle amounts of Roman Cath-
olic theology under the general
theme of “Some Historical As-
pects oi the Relation oi Science
and Religion.”

in his opening iectum, “Chris-
tianity and the Origin of Natural
Science." Father McMullin em-
phasized the historical develop
ment of the questioning thought
process. From th e ancient
Greek idea of “mind" Came the
turn to the theoretical which in-
troduced a belief in the power
of man's mindi Man. through
use of his mind, could under-
stand things about his world.

This searching attitude, an im-
portant part of the Judaeo—
Christian tradition, had an im‘
ponunt influence on the devel-
opment of the scientific method.

Concept of Man

He also explored the histori-
cal context of a related concept
of man. “The idea of man l‘urm~
ing himself has always been in
Christianity. Now it is being
emphasized by existentialism,"
This theme of the questioning,
Searching, rational mind led
Father MCMullin to his conclu-

sion. “It was no accident that
science developed in the Chris-
tian West and even today finds
only an uneasy home in the
East.”

Father McMullin's second ad»
dress focused on the clash of
the scientific and religious
world views. Men pondered the
question of where man fitted
into the natural order. Was man
a spirit and therelore divorced
from nature; or was man a part
or nature? The attempt to look
at things objectively directed
man's thinking in the 16th, 17th,
and 18th centuries. This move-
ment led man away lrom the
religious view and the authority
of the new science grew.

‘The Christian religious faith
has tended upon the notion of

a revelation. The triumph of
biological and technological
science has opened up a gull,"
explained Father McMullin,

Faith and Reason

The final lecture examined
the topic of “The Contribution
of Science to Theology: A Look
to the Future.” He showed how
science has changed our picture
of ourselves and our universe.
”Christian theology today owes
a great deal to eiioris ot SCien-
tists oi all kinds.” He presented
technology as "simply an exten-
sion of ourselves. We can de-
slroy it or ennoble it. The limi-
tations now are those in man

.— his will to use the powers he

has, and to use them for the
good."

Scientilic interests and religi-
ous beliefs are both striving to-
Ward the same relationships:
man with the universe, and man
with God “We can’t cut apart
those two domains of man’s in.
terest, raith and reason, be-
cause man is a part or God. All
the fields oi science, theology,
and philosophy come to a point
in man for they all have some-
thing to say to him,

l.oy Krathong

By LIVIA DENAVS

Thul Festival of Lights .
The evening of the hill moon in November
Is set aside for the propitiation ol the guard-
ian spirits of the rivers, ponds, and water-
ways. As darkness falls and the moon comes
. up, the Thais follow the ancient Brahmanic
custom of setting afloat (loi) little river rafts
or boats (krathong) bearing lighted candles.
incense sticks, and other gifts as thank-offer-
ings and as a gesture of conciliation to en-
sure protection during the following year for

All those who bathe in the water or travel on

it. Loy Krathong is one of the most popular

or on Thai customs, enjoyed yearly by young
and old alike,

The candle on the pink paper float flickered as
if to go out A small brown hand shielded it from
the wind, and as the flame began to glow,
placed the host on ﬁle dark sluggish water. With
a joyful abandon, the ﬂame burned brighter and
brighter, ready to consume itself and the float.
The incense curled upwards in tight ringleLs,
then, stirred by the breeze, dissipated in the
moonlight like wisps of angel hair. The light will
captured and reﬂected in the small copper coin
which had been placed on the float as an offer-
ing to the spirits. Next to it, paper flowers of
dainty pastel pink, creamy white, and pale yellow
lay sprinkled with crunchy popcorn and pearl-
like grains of rice. Laden with these offering!
and the burden of a small boys' sins, the float
slowly began to move — first to the left, then to
the right, past the reeds and grasses trying to
ensnare it, then past the gnarled root, dark and
rimster in the moonlight, until finally, tree trom
restraints, it began to spin, this way and that,
faster and faster, iurther and further from the
shore, until tinally, it became lost among the
thousands of other lights — a new star in the
watery Milky Way.

Suchat, still standing knee-deep in water, his
young legs firmly braced against the current,

strained his eyes to keep the tiny pinpoint of
light in View Then, with a frown, he gave up.
He scampered up the muddy bank, darted through
h group or giggling school-girls, and nearly
knocked me down in his enthusiasm to join his
brother and sisters in the further pursuit oi
sanuk or fun.

My float had been launched successfully an
hour ago, with all due and proper ceremony, and
i had watched it disappear under the gaping
iron jaw of the Old Bridge. 1, too, was willing
to pursue sanuk a little furthers (And, in Thai—
land, sanulr and eating are almost synonymous.)
As the fragrance of spicy Thai food waited
through the air, Jungiut, the science teacher, his
triend, and I made our way across the crowded
street to the campus of the Dara branch school.

The grounds of the school, normally crowded
With children at recess or quiet and dusty on
weekends, had been transliormed through the
wild fantasy of color, sounds, and smells into a
carnival kaleidoscope, The open-air restaurant oc-
cupied the prominent central position on campus.
Low tables and chairs squatted on the dirt
“floor'ﬁ Dara students in their colorful red and
white uniforms hustled back and forth with sav-
ory dishes of steaming rice, curry, fried noodles,
and various meat dishes, as well as “foreign"

foods such as hot dogs, sizzling pancakes. vanilla .
and chocolate ice cream, and the ever-popular ‘

Coke, 7-Up, and Bairley's orange juice.
Christmas tree lights glowed in the dark tree-

tlnd illuminated the booths and entrance with

their cheerful Colors of red. green. blue, and

yellow. Here and there. young students passed .

through the holiday crowds setting 33ny colored
balloons for a tew Entangs apiece. Ping pong
halls llashed in steady rhythm across white nets,

The sound of popular music—"Tennessee Waltz", ,

“Sound of Music”, “Hang on Sleepy", the
Beatles — hlared through the loudspeakers, only
to be pierced occasionally by the still louder
shrieks and laughter ot kids having a good time.
