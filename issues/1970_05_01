Students Vo+e To Reject
Judicial Council Proposal

By Greg Butcher
Students rejected an amends
merit to the SGA Constitution
concerning the Judicial Council
Article by a narrow margin
Monday noon in the lunch lines. A
positive vote of so per cent was
needed for approval; but out of
512 ballots, 302 (59 per Cent) Voted
in favor, eight short of the
number necessary for approval.
Only 123 students (25 per cent of
those voting) opposed the
proposal, but the 75 abstentions
and seven unmarked ballots
provided the margin of defeat.
The voting followed a KDIC
editorial opposing the amend
rnent and urging the defeat of the
proposal. The editorial attacked
seven aspects of the proposal: (1)
the limit of 20 persons at open
hearings, (2) a section of the bill
of rights which allows entrance
into student rooms, (a) hall
judicial councils remaining
essentially the same as before,
(4) one section which left
defendants open to “double
jeopardy,” (5) the President‘s

veto power over judicial
decisions, (6) one section of the
amendment (had-ll which ape
pears to be contradictory, and t7)
the sloppiness and redundancy of
the entire amendment.

Tuesday night, the Senate,
which had previously approved
the amendment, deleted the
section limiting attendance at
open hearings and voted to
resubmit the proposal to
referendum. A motion to delete
the section allowing double
jeopardy was deieated
unanimously on the grounds that
no parallel could be made be
tween judicial councils and the
U.S. court system and that
therefore the objections were
invalid,

Bill Thomas and Greg Vranicar
defended the amendment against
the other KDIC attacks. Dealing
with the second objection above,
they said that entrance into
student rooms is already college
procedure and that at times it is

Dean’s Office And Senate Committee
Reveal Plans For Residence Halls

Several major changes have
been made in the residence halls
for next year, resulting in a wider
number of options for students,
particularly with respect to co-
ed balls, The changes were made
by the Student Deans office in
cooperation with the Housing
Committee of the Student Senate
in response to the results of a
questionnaire distributed by the
Committee to residents of Loose
and Younker and all other stun
dents except seniors.

Next year, Loose Hall, which
has been co-ed by floors this year,
will be coed by rooms The
rooms will not be exactly alterr
nating, but there will be approxir
mately the same number of men
and women on each floor, spread
throughout the entire iloor,

Cleveland and Langan Halls
will both be made cerd by floor.
Basement and second floor in
Cleveland will be women and
lirst and third men, In Langan,
first and second will be women
and Basement and third men.
These arrangements were made
to keep the number of bed spaces
available and the number of
singles available equal {or both
men and women

In addition to me above
changes, Younker Hall will re
main coeed by wings, and Smith
will become a men’s hall and
Dibble womens,

Mrs, Alice Low, Dean of
Students, told the SKIS that the
changes were made in accord
ance with the belief that “it is
very important to maintain a
variety of living styles on cam

pus." and the questionnaire
circulated by the Student
Housing Committee indicated
that there was a desire for more
Co~ed halls.

Freshmen will be assigned to
all halls on campus; they will be
sent a letter explaining the ale
tcrnatives, and they will have a
chance to indicate their prefer-
enccs.

For returning upperclassmen,
number drawings were held
Thursday night, and room selecr
tions will be made Saturday.

Mrs. Low said that the dormi»
tory arrangement planned for
next year was not planned as a
permanent one, and that she
thinks that ”the 1' ng situation
and use of dormitories should be
evaluated each year."

Requirements

Fast on the heels of the so-called “Betts proposal"
comes the proposal to abolish individual course require-
ments. The question is currently at the divisional level,
and, no doubt, will be presented to the faculty before
long. It seems almost inevitable that the most universal
requirement, the Humanities course, will be widely
debated. We presume that the arguments for or against
requirements in principle may be justly argued in the
specific case of the Humanities course. Let us then,
set forth some of the arguments against a required

Humanities course. .
The Humanities course requires a large faculty, some

of whom resent teaching a course in which they are
not primarily interested. For this reason some faculty
teach the course half-heartedly, thus poorly. Students
who are required to take a course which does not in-
terest them waste time which might be more profitably
spent. On the other hand, if anyone were interested
in Humanities he would not need to be required to take
the course. He would do so voluntarily. The combination
of a disinterested teacher and a number of disinterested
students makes for a very poor course.

Further, the administration does not know the needs
and interests of each student and so is not a proper
judge of what courses any student might need to pursue
his educational goal. Hence, a required Humanities
course is indiscriminately unjust. A good counselling
system would direct students to courses which fit their
needs. Thus, a Humanities course may be recom-
mended or it may not depending on the individual.

These arguments, we think, must be honestly met
by anyone defending the Humanities course require-
ment. They may be answered as follows:

It is true that some faculty would prefer not to teach
a Humanities course. It is also true that some faculty
would prefer not to teach introductory courses, other
lower level courses, and courses in which they are
not currently interested. They may still teach these
courses well. In short, a faculty members personal
preferences are important, but not essential to his doing

a good job. Good teachers will teach the Humanities
course well, bad teachers will teach it poorly.

it is also true that a number of students are not inter-
ested in Humanities when they enter the course and
are not interested in Humanities when they leave the
course. We have, however, on too many occasions
taken courses where almost everyone in the course
was there voluntarily. And in these courses we have
seen interest that was something less than overwhelm-
ing. We admit that there are a certain few students,
the very great ones and the very poor oneTt'or whom
requirements are useless, They do not need them. For
the most part. however, this College deals with students
who are neither very great nor very poor, And it is
precisely these people who can learn most from good
teachers and benefit most from required courses.

The administration certainly does not claim to know
each student’s personal needs. They are, though, justis
fied in assuming some similarity in the students. After
all, the liberal arts college presumes to offer a fairly
specific kind of education, different from, say, a
technical school. Anyone who has had any contact with
a technical school knows the large number of required
courses these institutions demand of their students.
It is true that a technical school is more “fact oriented”
than a liberal arts college, but if a liberal arts education

is a goal which means anything at all, then it would »

seem to be the case that there are certain definable
means to thatgoal.
A good counselling system, is. of course, highly desire

able. And as one well respected faculty member says,
“if you can get a good student and a good teacher to-
gether, you don’t need requirements." Now, no one
seems to know how to develop a good counselling system
among the faculty nor exactly how to bring the good
student and the good teacher together. By excluding
the Humanities requirement we reduce the number
of students taking Humanities, and so limit the contact
which the greatest number of students will have with
the greatest diversity of courses. Thus, we lessen the
possibilities for contrast between good students and
good teachers.

It is not enough simply to refute the arguments
against the Humanities requirement. One must, it
seems, have positive reasons for keeping what we
already have. There is a very old argument, but still
a very good one, tor this,

The liberal arts college is primarily concerned with
teaching students a method or a number of methods
for learning. The most important thing the college can
do is to give the student the best tools for learning,
such as the techniques of analysis, synthesis, etc. How-
ever, the method must have matter on which to work,
or else it will be like a wheel turning nothing. Now
presumably the matter on which we work is contained
largely in the texts taught in the courses. We think
it fairly obvious that it is wise, both pedagogically
and philosophically, to use the best matter available.
One of the purposes of the Humanities course is to
teach the method by means of the literature which
has been recognized as best by a large number of men
over a long period of time. If we require that the best
methods be taught, it seems that we should require
the best material be taught, specifically in the case
of Humanities.

If the proposal to eliminate requirements is adopted,
we do not anticipate the demise of excellent education
at Grinnell College. We expect only its diminution.
It seems to us, though, that we ought to try to make
the College better rather than create the conditions
in which it will become worse, For these reasons, we
believe that the required Humanities course, and by
extension, requirements in general, ought to be re-
tained.

College Approves Program To Help
Blocks To Live In Clusters In Holls

By Mark Sableman

A plan which would allow a
number of black iipperclassmen
and freshmen to live in the
same dormitory next year has
been approved by the college,
The so-called “Younker proe
posal" is designed to help ease
the problems of adjustment.
both social and academic,
which black freshmen face
when first coming to Grinnell.

As plans now stand. there
will be ten llppel‘ClaSS black
men in North Younker. arid
eight upperclass black women
in South Younker, Entering
black freshmen will be sent a
special letter, asking if they
would like to live in Younker.

Associate Dean of Students
Conney Kimbo. who has been
involved with this proposal
since its inception, plans to fill
no more than approximately
forty of the 106 spaces in Youn-
lter witll black students. Dean'
Kimbo said that black students
will be scattered throughout all
the floors in Younker.

The plan is optional for all
black students. It is the out-
growth of an earlier proposal
by the Concerned Black Stu-
dents (CBS) for an all-black
floor, and the final plan was
decided on just last Monday.

The original proposal by
CBS, an all~black floor, was
sent to the Student Housing
Committee appointed by the
Student Senate last month, It
contained a number of reasons
for the need for a living situa-
tion which would provide an
“atmosphere that would pro-
mote better adjustment to Grin-
nell by black freshmen."

The Housing Committee rer
fcrred the proposal, with their
approval, to the Student Deans
office. Last Saturday. Dean
Kintbo and President Leggett
discussed it with the CBS com-
inittee of Quinton Phea, Larry
Wright. and David Lewis,

Both Leggett and Kimbo felt
that the request for an all-black
floor was unwise. but that the
reasons given for the need for
some kind of special orienta-
tion for black students were.
in Leggett’s words. "very per-
sttasive.”

Last year, a kind of informal
“cluster arrangement" was fol—
lowed iii assigning black sttlr
dents to domiitories; for ex~
ample, several dormitories
have five or six black students.

Last week, President Leg~
gett informed several of the
Trustees who have special in-
terests in this area, of the CBS
proposal for an all black floor.
and asked for their opinions.
President Leggett spoke to
Mr. Robert Noyce (chairman
of the Board of Trustees). Mr.
Lawrence Towner (Vice-Chair-
man), and Mrs Elizabeth
Kruldenier, a trustee who has
been involved in civil rights
work in Des Moines Dean Kim4
on spoke to Mr. James Lowrey,
a Trustee who is a black gradu-
ate of Grinnell. All four of
those Trustees felt that black
freshmen would need some oriv
entatioii. but preferred to do
this without having a black
floor.

’Continued troni page 3

lee Saturday tilternoon, Dean
Kimbo met with groups of
black students and they dis-
cussed alternative proposals.

Tile plan was the major topic
of discussion at o CBS meeting
Sunday night at the Black Cut
titrat llousc, a meeting which
lasted almost seven hours. It
was at this meeting that CBS
tlccrded on the plan as it now
stands,

Dean Kimbo, who was at
that meeting, said that a num-
ber of alternatives was dis-
cussed, including simply in
creasing the current cluster
arrangements, but that the pro-
posal which was eventually de-
cided on — the Younker pro-
posal —— seemed to best meet
the goal of helping freshmen
black students adjust academa
icaily and socially to the col»
lege.

Preslclent Leggett made the
decision to accept this proposal
Monday hecause he ten it was
the best of the alternatives.
Dcan Kimbo met with the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee Mon-
day atternoon and intormed
them of the decision.

Those who were involved in
formulating it hope that the
Younkers Plan will deal effec-
lively with what President Leg-
gett called “the Very special
problems in social and academr
IC orientation" on the part or
black students. According to
Dean Kimbo, it is :l cultural
shock for black students who
have grown up in an all black
community to come into an all
white community and college
and be able to function as
students immediately, and the
Younker Plan will be important
in helping incoming black fresh-
men ”make lt” in their first
semester.

Dean Kimbo Said that much
thought went into the proposal
on the part of all those in-
volved in making it, especially
the Concerned Black Students.
”it is not a capricious type
or proposal," he said.

Presulent chgett feels that
the plan is in line with the pol-
icy the Trustees decided on
alter their special meeting
with black students in May or
last year in Chicago. Thc open-
ing sentence of the policy
statement that came out of that
meeting reads, “Grinncll Cole
ng0 is trying to fashion its
emotional and operational a".
vironmcnt so that it is in fact
a multi-racial society of stu-
dents and taeulty acting togethr

Solon lets him in on the Prizes,

“Then, Solon, you amazing

of apples and parsley and a

otit that even a youth could
procure such things at most
stores and market places at
considerably less trouble and
risk.

Solon is appropriately out-

to Grate Movingly Upon the

game in town at that point),

such a training, along with the
spectacle of virtue offered in
cockiights and the comedies oi
Aristophanes, would enable
Athens to beat all and sundry
who may hear her evil inten-
tions. The object of this gym-
nasium, in short, is to provide
the polls with a fierce and har»
dened army,

Two conclusions spring imme-
diately to mind:

(1) Sports had no intrinsic
value, even to Solon, Their
main justitieation is utility and
their principal utility is force.

(2) Solon had not heard oi
Black soup,

So i should like to question,
given the legitimacy and eter-
nal relevance of the Greek to
all and sundry of our preoccu-
palions, Much Less, just to
what extent sports is inhibitive
oi violence. Solon, in tact,

Friday. Mag l, l'?70

points out the critical Truism
of this dispute, that the capac-
lty ior Violence and iorce is
increased, rather than dimin»
ished by exercise.

Tile case of Aquinas is still
more distressing, The mother
of a friend of mine, a fine lady
who had attended a Convent
school for about as long as
such things can be endured,
put her finger right on the
problem.

“i suppose that his philosr
ophy is all right." she sighed,
"but he was just so fat.”

Now the difficulty seems here
to devolve around some am-
biguities in the translation of
Thomas' dictum (Summa con-
tra Nihilisticos XCX, cXC, etc.).
i believe that it our corres-
pondent would return to the
text of this remark he would
find the more appropriate
translation to be ”War is the
moral equivalent of Sports.”

Now the fact of the matter is
that, so far as any scholars
can ascertain, St. Thomas had
only one encounter with a Sport
or any sort whatever. As Ches-
Lerton tells it: . . . when his
brothers introduced into his
room a particularly gorgeous
and painted courtesan, with the
idea of involving him in a
scandal . . . he was very ani-
mated indeed. He sprang from
his seat and snatched a ﬂam-
ing brand from the Fire, and
stood brandishing it like a flam-
ing sword. (Get it?) The wom-
an . . . shrieked and fled. (The
Dumb 0x)

I suppose that my final word
on the subject would be in con-
cert with st. Thomas’ late.

mittee may speciry.

“Ill. College
(statement as in
catalog).

“And that the faculty im»
mediately undertake
modification of the advising
system to make it appropriate for
its new importance.

"Proposal B: That the credit-
iail option be extended to all
students with the provision that
two courses may be taken each
semester on this basis, but with
credltrfall not allowed in the
major ﬁeld except in such special
cases as have been previously
approved."

According to Mr, Clotl'elter
there is a very good reason for
doing something about the
present requirements. “It is most
difficult for a student to eXr
periment with courses in enough
areas early in his career so that
he can try out subjects in which
he might want to major,” said
Clotfelter. Mr, Clotfelter also
listed three reasons why he
thought his proposal would be a
good step for the College to take.

First, the rationale - for
requiring certain courses was to
be sure that all students had an
introduction to many different

Residence
current

areas of learning. Clotielter
pointed out that most Students
now come from high school with a
good introduction to most of the
arcas in which Courses are
presently required,

The proposed change would
likely improve the attitude of
students toward their courses,
because they would be taking
courses they felt they ought to
take rather tllan courses they
had to take. it would be the task
of the advisor to persuade his
advisees to take this or that
course

Finally, the advising system
would be improved. Advisor and
student would have to carefully
work out the program of study for
each individual student; hence,
there would be more Contact be
tween advisor and advisee.

The proposal was reierred by
the Executive Council to the Ed-
ucational Policy Committees of
the three Divisions. Their recom-
mendations were to be discussed
and acted upon by the Divisions.

According to Mr. Worley,
Philosophy. the Social Studies
Division agrees overwhelmingly
that the Clotielter proposal would
not damage any- or the depart
ments in the Division if it were
enacted. Mr, Worley believes
that most oi the departments in

meeting There is a consensus
that if such a proposal is enacted,
laculty members will have to do a
much better job oi advising
students than they are doing at
the present time. Worley felt that
the proposal is not likely to go
through this year, partly because
the staff has already been hired
ior next year based upon an
expected demand ior courses,
and partly because many
questions still remain. in
Worley’s opinion, “the key
question is: What are the re
quirements for a good
education?”

The science Division has
decided not to consider the Clot»
felter proposal this year, ac-
cording to Mr. Delong, Biology.
DeLong also said that it would be
Very difficult to estimate the
effect that the abolishment of re-
quircments would have on the
Biology Department. He did say
that many students who would
not have taken the course if it had
not been required have neverthe-
less said they felt it was a worth-
while course. Mr. Clotfelter said
that he believed there would be
little ctlec't on the total enrollr
ment in the science division. He
said that certain changes could
be made in the present Science ff
course (for instance, two sections
could be offered, one with lab and
one without) to make the courses
more attractive to students and
to conserve faculty time. Stur
dents could be persuaded to take
a broad program or studies both
by their advisors and by a series
or lectures given early each year
to entering students, outlining the

reasons for trying to get a broad
education. Said Clotfelter, ”I
believe that most Grinnell
students are mature enough that
thcy would want to take difficult
courses, even in subjects outside
the area of their immediate ins
tercst.”

Mr. Foster, English, believes
that the Humanities Division is
overwhelmingly opposcd to the
proposal as it now stands. He ielt
that the language departments
and perhaps some oi the fine arts
dopartments would be decreased
in size. The EPC did recommend
a compromise proposal by Miss
Noble, Spanish, which would re-
quire a certain distribution of
courses. According to Foster, the
Division is now considering two
questions: 1. whether or not to
recommend the Noble proposal to
the Executive Council and 2.
whether to defer the decision on
this matter until next year, when
the Divisions can more caretully
consider all the alternatives.

The proposal offered by Miss
Noble would set the following re-
quireinents:

”1. Completion of 124 credits
with an overall cumulative
grade point average of 2.0.

“2. Completion of at least 32 but
not more than 48 credits in a
major field.

“3. Completion of a distribution
requirement oi at least 28 credits
in courses in departments or
Special Programs in the Group in
which the student‘s major does
not fall. No more than 12 hours in
any one department may count
toward the fulfillment of this re
quirement.

”Group 1: American Studies,
Art, Classical Languages, Com-
munications, 'English, French,
German, Music, Philosophy.
Religious Studies, Russian.

“Group II: Anthropology,
Biology, Chemistry, Economics,
Education, History,
Mathematics, Physics, Political
Science, Psychology, Sociology.

added to the proposal, but Mr.

absolutely necessary to enter a
student‘s room, Unless
restrictions are placed on this
procedure in the Constitution,
students will have no protection
at all from illegal entrances. In
answer to the third point, they
said that the main thrust of the
proposal was to provide “cone
sistellcy and coordination"
between hall judicial councils.
Previously, these councils had
never been officially defined
campusewide.

The iitth point is a common
objection to student government
proposals; but Bill Thomas
pointed out that because the
trustees have declared that the
president has the final say in all
college affairs, students have no
say in the matter. Finally, Bill
and Greg stated that the ap-
parent inconsistency in section A-
SH does not exist upon close
examination. As for sloppiness
and redundancy in the proposal,
each student will have to decide
for himself how valid and how
important that criticism is.

The Grinnell tennis team upped
IIS overall record to 333 and its
conierence record to 2-2 ,by
winning three meets in-a rowan
by decisive margins

On April 18, the netmen
squashed South Dakota State by
an impressive 8-1 margin as they
swept all the singles and dropped
only one doubles match, Grinnell
ran up their tallies with com-
parative ease as number one Ken
Schofield pulled out a 977, 670
decision, alld the rest of the team
rolled on to victory as follows:
Jim Spell: (3-3, (H; Ed DeBu Gr

Dave Beernan: 672, 6 ; and
Carlos Mendoza: 5-2, 570. Grinnell
took two oi the three doubles
matches as DeBuS-Bonnewell
triumphed by a 672,6-2 score and
Spelerob Quint by a oi, 672

The only losing team that day
was Beeman-Mendoza who gave
up a hardriought match that went
to three sets with SDS Coming out

Continuing a rather bland
season, the Pioneer baseball
team dropped two and picked up
one over the weekend,

The Pioneers edged out Knox or

periormanee with a three run
spurt at the bottom of the ninth.
Bill Dicks started the rally with a
homer, and was followed across
the plate by Ed Hirsch and Scott
Hanson, who came in on the
strength oi a single swatted by
Roger Rowe.

The real action, however,
occurred on Saturday, when

because oi bad weather and

The Pioneers rolled on to

Concerning Authority 8t Recreation

By John Nigel Pepper

It has not been my custom in
this space even to deign so much
as a reply to the sucuillous and
reprehensible (albeit rather
,pathetic) character assas-
sinations aimed at me by my
rabid enemies, It is one thing, of
course. to attack a truth-Seeker
out or malice and ignorance But
it is quite another thing to drag
St. Thomas Aquinas, much less
the Greeks into the matter. I had
received assurances irom Lloyd
and Harry that the 5&3 would be
above that sort ot Thing.

I would like to make a few
remarks about this, starting
Much Less with the Greeks, and
then to go on to the Angelic
Proctoscopist. If there is time

and space leit over, perhaps 1 can
make some ilimsy pretense of
relevance to the need and wants
of the Grinllell Community.
Much less the Greeks, for a
start, is not a seamless whole.
There are, in fact many different
sorts of Greeks, “Some Greeks
are tall and some are small,"
“Some Greeks make us Glad and
others make us Sad." But be that
as it may, the Greeks in question,
Much Less Aristotle and Plate
were not all the Greeks. They
werehothing more than Some oi
the Athenians. Some other sorts
ufGreeks were the Spartans, who
were Kings Jock, Bar None of the
Whole Show. They used to love
nothing so much as to spend their
days running about Flailing

each other with Knouts and so on.
This was a strenuous pastime,
so at the end of their day, the
Spartans would retire to their
mess for a mess of Black Soup
before retiring to their stone beds
with blankets made of used hair
shirts It was once remarked by
an Athenian tourist that the
iierceness oi the Spartan
warriors could be accounted ior
by the Black Soup alone, and
Don't Bother about the Knouts
etc. Who could possibly be afraid
of death. after all after facing
Black Soup7

illgs, and the smoke still hasn‘t cleared from the game. From where
I saw it in left field (and the bench after committing two errors)
it looked like Read was out—psyched by the redoubtable Dave Brown
and the Homes crew, with the Machine striking out and making

errors.

Haines got 12 runs, and Read
struggled for a or 4, which
should give Haines a win. How
ever, it seems that Al Ham-
mond was illegal (which isn't
a very nice thing to say about
him), so Read has filed a pro-
test. At last report, both sides
had presented non-negotiable
demands, and Haines has lined
up Dave Horwatt to talk to
Read for them. No details of
a settlement will be released
for some time, so until further
notice, Clark is in first place.
Both Read and Haines followed
that game with losses, Read
dropping a hard-fought contest
to the Profs 87, and Haines be-
ing dumped by East 18-13. Read
didn’t ,have Amazing Mason
Klippel (The Riﬂe Arm) in

right field, and the Faculty was
real strong behind their young
phenom George Apostle and
veteran Greg Guroff. Ed Le-
vine knocked in 4 runs in East‘s
first Victory, and Brad Hanson
homered in both the Read and
East games for Haines. The
Read-Faculty game also fea-
tured a meaningful dialogue
about some strange baserun-
ning by Mahler and Farsinnen,
who demonstrated that two
bodies cannot occupy the same
space. A faculty meeting was
held on the mound as to
whether or not Andy Loewi
should be given an intentional
walk. A senate committee and
Tom Greenfield are looking
into the matter.
