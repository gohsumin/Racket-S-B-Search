SNC C Gets NSA Support

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Com-
mittee is an organization of Southern student}
devoted to the elimination of all forms of racial
discrimination. SNCC (pronounced “snic") pur-
sues this goal through non—violent but direct
action. its primary activities have been in the
area of voter registration, where the group has
done canvassing and educational work, and, when
necessnry, has organized demonstrations. sncc
also works against discrimination in educatio ,
job opportunities, the equal use of public fncili.
ties, and all of the other areas which the noble
and numerous white man has decided are not
to be shared with anyone but his fellow
W.A.S.P,’s (White AnglerSaxon Protestants).
The United States National Student Associa—
tion has for a long time recognized a common
interest with SNCC. The basic policies of USNSA,
set by the National Student Congress during the
summer of each year, have consistently taken
a firm stand in the area of civil rights, including
full support both of the goals and of the non-
violent means of SNCC. USNSA has been further
concerned with this particular organization be-
cause the people involved are students. SNCC
is a student-run, student-staffed, and students
financed organization. This sets it apart from
many of the civil rights groups now working in
the South, and this peculiar make-up demands
the careful attention of the student community.
USNSA has not had the funds to support
SNCC momentarily, but it has lent its full
weight in policy statements, and organizational
assistance wherever possible. The 1963 National
Student Congress, attended by Jim Parkison,
Vance Opperman, Dan Friedlander, and me, vol:-
ed renewed support for SNCC, and then passed
a special resolution on the situation in Americus,
Georgia, where on August a; of this yenr three
field secretaries of mm (two white and one
Negro) were arrested while leading a peacful
demonstration. They were beaten repeatedly by

Christiansen

police, jailed, charged with “incitement to insur-
rection” a a crime which carries the death
penalty in Georgia a and are being held in
lieu of $360,000 pence bond until the grand jury
can meet some time in October.

This incident is not rare one. SNCC work-
ers have been beaten, j led, and thrown out of
towns, ridiculed, threatened, and last spring a
young Negro man, Jimmy Travis, wns murdered
in Mississippi while working on s chc votei-
registration program.

Life is not pleasant for the 150 or so young
men and women who make up the full-time staff
of SNCC. They are paid about $10 a week for
subsistence, and usually have to find a part»time
job in order to eat. Transportation is as often as
not by foot or by mule. violence and brutality
are constantly waiting if they push too far. Pro-
gress is heartbreakingly slow. Yet these young
men and women remain at work because they
share a common goal _ a goal which most of
us will freely agree with, fat and happy here in
Iowa where such ideas are not very dangerous.

SNCC’s biggest problem is a lack of funds.
The Freedom Singers who sang in A,R.H. last
spring were on n tcur trying to raise funds for
SNCC. The organization is yery largely depend-
ent on contributions from campuses across the
country, but these campuses have not in the
past been overwhelmingly responsive. At least
Grinnell is safely with the majority in this score.

it would be a darn good idea if someone
actually tried to run a fund-raising campaign for
mac around here, At Grinnell I mean — here.
We probably would not lose any money for

SNcc, we might optimistically raise a nickel
or two, and it would be interesting to See if the
noble principles so freely espoused by all pro.
perly-liberallyzeducated students go far enough
below their skin to reach their pocketbooks.

it probably doesn’t interest anyone in the
slightest, but there are only eightystwo more
dsys until Christmas of which only sixty-six
are shopping days. This startling piece of mccn—
sequential news found me in a rnther apathetic
frame of mind, but nonetheless l mustered up
my courage and fortitude and embarked on my
annual sojourn into childhood via the toy de-
purtments in the local stores

Usually I wait until a few days before Christz
mas, when every business establishment from
drugstore to gas station displays such s multiz
tude and abundance of toys for the tots that the
casual observer could swear that he was look—
ing st the very inner sanctum of the venerable,
jolly old Saint Nick’s hidezawvayeat the North
Pole; however, my enthusiasm to see what brain-
storms the toy tycoons had dreamed up soon
grew to a furious pitch and throwing all rc-
straint to the wind 1 took my hand and marched
myself downtown to take just a little sneak
peek into the land of childhood memories.

Very cautiously i opened the door of a store
i was sure contained somewhere in its depths
the magic words “TOY DEPARTMENT” which
was the key that unlocked the wonderful world
of childhood fantasy. Carefully l crept to the
rear of the store where i found myself surrounds
ed by games and planes and all sorts of won-
derous things. But something was wrong, Some-
thing was alien and strange. The toys i saw
before me were not those that l rcmbered play-
ing with as a child. No, instead 1 saw before
me games and playthings which sent achill of
icy horror reverberating up and down my spine.

Carefully I read the names on the all too
bright boxes hoping that perhaps my first glance
had been hasty and inaccurate. Methodically l
mouthed the words i read, too frighened to fully
comprehend their significance. “Combat-" (in
three demension lettering on a garish yellow
exploding background) 7 “Tank Attack, Crash
Tank through Enemy Obstacles, Test Your lant—
tle Skill.” “ch Fight, Air Battle Game, shoot

down as many of the enemy as possible _ one

Army Tank and Jeep—20 pieces, stage your own
All Out Attack. Tommygunitch, Tmytommyi
59c. Tactics 1, Tactics ll, Stalingrad, Espionage."
My horror grew to fever pitch and frantically 1
reached for one of the “games” and began to
read the “simple, easy to follow instructions" in
hopes of proving my fears groundless. With
trembling lips i read the description of a “game"
entitled ”Missile Attack."

“Missile Attack . , . provides . , . enough
nuclear battle equipment for maximum effort
warfare and massive counterattack. Never
before so much actual design working model
USAF-type firepower and manpower! Your

regressed from sanity so far that even the ‘once

disillusioned, my aye caught one more box. It was

point the stench of hypocrisy grew so unbearable
that I ran out of the store and down the street

Encampment Committee Reports on ILA, Curriculum .

By Karen Adkinson
”it will be evident from (the
outline of the discussions Lhat

,we did not solve any basic
problems. It would be Pollyan—
naish to think that we would.
The problems are tough and the
answers aren’t immediate. We
did define and clarify problems,
exchange ideas and information,
and make a few tentative sug-
gestions."

This statement drom the re.
port of the Encampment oom—
mittee on the Junior Liberal
Arts Exam land Curriculum sums
up the results of the Encampa
ment in general. But willat were
the specific problems, ideas, in.
formation and suggestions dis-
cussed?

The Committee on the AMA
Exam and Curriculum, headed
by Jack Spence, covered three
main topics during its two days
of meetings—the JLA Exam, the
grading system. and the nu.
manities and Historical Studies
program. The rollowing arc cx-
cerpts from a report issued by
this committee outlining its dis.
cussion.

“We initiated this discussion
by trying to achieve a clear
description of the theoretical
purposes and benefits of the
exam. The theory underlying
the idea of a Junior Liberal
Arts Exam holds that if there

is such a concept as a Liberal ,

Arts Education and this is a
circumscribalile, finite thing,
then there should be a testing
instrument which can be used
to Show if a student has
achieved excellence in this
education.

“Assuming the theory is plau-
sible, it clearly indicates that
one 'pqupose of the exam is to
measure a student’s mastery of
a Liberal Arts Education. How»
ever, we felt that this test and
the preparation for it also
should serve an educational
function, It should give the stu—
dent a chance to synthesize his
knowledge, to recognize and
know methods and theories

which are useful in many disci-
plines, and to find similarities
and differences between discl-
plines.

'T‘urther, it should give the
student an opportunity to take
the responsibility of independ—
ently studying a broad topic. In
the future when the exam bet
comes a more reliable testingl
instrument, it is hoped that itl

edge of cross disciplinary cone
cepts . . .

“If capturing the essence
and the totality of a Liberal
Arts Education is the ideal,
all concerned with the exam
should realize that this is im-
possible.
there are certain concepts and
,methods which a liberally edu-
cated student should know and

be tested on his ability to
reason logically.

“A further problem

be convinced of the worth of
the concept and the worth of

preparation forthe exam even
while the whole concept is in
the experimental stage. In the
long run an atmosphere of ac-
!ceptance needs to be establish-
ed if the exam is to achieve its
goals of education and independ»

“of course, another problem
involved the type of exann
that should be given. Several
different types were discuss-
ed, including the following:
a) A problem type exam
which would require the stu-
dcnt to analyze the validity of
the reasoning and methodology
used in establishing some
theory . . . b) A take-home
exam which would require ri—

“The committee reached con.-

The Grading System

“Our discussion , . . involved
the question, ‘How does one

Iniuries Turn Players to Coaching

Henry, Nye Continue Football

By Tom Lane

What happens to an athlete
who, according to Coach Bowers,
“was deﬁnitely ﬁrst—string var.
sitymaterial,"when, in the ﬁrst
quarter of the ﬁrst game of his
collegiate football career, he re
ceives such a severe knee injury
that he is told never to play
again?

What happens to a halfback
who, after making all—state at
his Colorado high school and ﬁrst
team defensive back as a sopho-
more for the Grinnell Pioneers,
develops an arthritic condition in
his knees that makes even the

VISIT

simple act of running painful?

Some athletes become bitter in
their self—sympathy. many de—
velop new interests, but in the
cases of Bill Henry and Dick
Nye, they have stuck by their
ﬁrst love: football.

This fall the two seniors are
coaching the freshman Pioneer
football team. Last year they
assisted Terry Moore with the
freshmen, but since Moore
joined the Peace Corps they
have the job to themselves
it's a tribute to the two that
the coaching staff thinks well
enough of their capabilities to
give them sole control over
the team. Their job is impor—
tant, for they must teach the
freshmen Grinnell’s favored
winged—T oﬁense.

Both men bring impressive
football backgrounds to the job.
Henry played six years of jun»
ior high and high school bail
in Texas where he was an all.
conference selection in his sens

‘ior year and has coached two

years at Grinnell. Nye also play—
ed for six years before coming
to Grinnell where he has played
two years and coached for one
year.

Similar as their backgrounds
are, they difrer radically in
their approach to coaching. Nye
believes “As a coach, even one
only two years older than his
Squad, 1 feel there must be a

.mental distance between the
Iplayers and myself. It's not a
feeling of superiority, but a de—
sire to stand back from the
lplayers, to reach objectivity. I
don’t want to have a bias to—
ward any single player."

Henry dlﬂers, “I don’t want,

to put myself above them. I
would rather be one of them
and earn their respect in that
way.”
It is this some difference of I
approach toward coaching that l
makes the two such a good ‘
combination.

Nye provides the team withl
the traditional leadership imagei
of ‘the Coach.’ As backﬁeld
coach, he is an interested stu—
dent of football teaching tech
niques. This contrasts with Hen-
ry who is a coach in a more
physical manner. He leads the
team in calisthenics and active—
ly participates in all nonecontaet
drills with his linemen.

Although neither plans to
make coaching a career, they
both ﬁnd it a satisfying experi-
ence. Nye says, ”I’d just as soon
be playing, though i feel we’re
making a valuable contribution
here." Henry adds, “In the fall
it bothers me that 1 Can’t. play,
especially when the varsity has
games. Sometimes, I don’t even
want to go to see them play,
but 1 always seem to end up

 

there at the game."

field coach gives tips to two
of his charges.

by the Hamm’s hear
it is written in the Selective

the person incapable of perform—
ting his military obligation. it
seems apparent that many of
Grinneli’s 1M jocks are using
the intramural program as a
means of sustaining injuries in
the hope that they will be of the

the “Grinnell Image” but it
isn’t the true American spirit.
So stop banging beads together

Open Al Cornell

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell’s freshman football
team opens its season this aft»
ernoon at Mount Vernon, Iowa,
with the Cornell College Rams.
The ﬁrst tilt of a three—game
season, this contest pits the
young Pioneers against a peren—
nially powerful squad. Cornell
will probably go with a well.
balanced attack and plenty of
passing.

Due to the departure of Terry}
Moore to the Peace Corps, the
coaching reins have fallen this‘
year to two seniors, Dick Nye
and Bill Henry. Concentrating
on fundamentals, Nye and Hen.
ry have ﬁelded a team with a
great deal of promise. A smalll
but hardrrunning backﬁeld fee-l
turing Rick Bl‘ecunier, Lynn
Richman and Nord Brue will
highlight the oﬁense this year.

3017 Watt, ionnerly a halt—
back, took over the quarter-
back spot when Elliott Hibbs
was injured, and consequently
the freshmen do not plan to
pass a great deal, although
they are exceptionally strong
at end where Tom Hill and
Ring Johnson will start,

The Pioneerlln g s also
boast good strength in the inte—
rior line. Starting here will be
tackles George Wittgraf and
Rick Anderson, guards Len Luv
ter and John Goodenow, and
center Bob Geller.

Rounding out the squad are
linemen Jon Showe, Steve Ross,
Tom Gait, Howard Harned, Harv
ry "nitwiler and Bill Grenze—
bach and backs Jefif Garland

and Monmouth. The Pioneers
with victories at the Wabash
Invitational, and over State Cole
lege of Iowa are favored to win
the meet for the second consecu-
tive year. The strongest team
competition should come from
St. Ambrose, which has last
year’s undefeated team back
virtually intact.

The run for individual honors
should be fierce with Gene
Tackle of Luther a‘slight fav—

The Pioneers should be ready
to shift into high gear tomor-

bing of Knox last weekend at
Galesbung. First string half—
backs Elston Bowers land Chip
Clarke will be back in action,
after missing last week’s game
due to injuries, and the only

tion is Eric Miller, junior tackle
