Things will get a lot worse
it something isn’t done about
racial incidents, the City Coun<
oil was told Monday night by
Negro students irom the Col-
lege.

“Unless something is done
'now by the City Council and
the Police Department, things
are going to get a lot worse
around here and somebody is
going to get hurt,” predicted
Hubert Farbes, a North Youn-
ker junior.

More than half of the Col-
lege's ﬁfty-one Negro students
attended the meeting.

The student's complaints —-
most of which were listed in
last Week’s 5&3 — included
many instances of verbal
abuse, physical threats, at-
tempts to run them over with
automobiles, having bottles
thrown at them, and the apathy
of proprietors of local busi-
nesses where incidents have
occurred.

“This is not a case of insti-
tutional segregation,” explained
Grady Murdock. West Norris
sophomore. “Only a portion oi
the population is antagonistic.“

Murdock also Cited tavern
and Cate owners as being reluc-
tant to act impaltially when in-
cidents occur: “The manage
ment can do more than tell
Negroes to leave when trouble
starts," he said. Murdock also
told the council that a white
townsman had threatened him
with a baseball bat.

Several Negro girls irom the
South agreed that they are bet-
ter treated on the streets of
their hometowns than in Grin-
nell.

Lucy Pollard, a sophomore in
Loose. told of being propo
honed while walking don't
, The harrassment has not

been limited to students. Denis
M. deCoteau. a Negro Protes—
sor of Music, was threatened
in downtown Grinnell by sev-
eral white persons wielding
baseball bats. De Coteau’s two-
year old daughter was with
him at the time.

Other Negro members of the
faculty have also reported be-
ing threatened while in the
town.

Greg Coggs,

East Norris

sophomore, told of being called -

a "nigger" by a three-year old
girl. “I'd been told Grinnell
was a liberal town." he said,
"but now I wouldn't tell my
friends to come here.”

Farbes told the council he
didn't feel the City was aware
of the problem. Mayor Beaver
agreed noting that the council
would have discussed the prob
lem earlier it it had been
brought to their attention.

Police Chief Bill .Peters ad-
mitted that he “didn't believe
it was as had as it was,” and
added that he would do all he
could to alleviate the problem.
He indicated he thought the
blame lay in “a iack oi com-
munication between the college
students and the Police Depart<
ment," that had “allowed this
thing to get out of hand.”

A major difﬁculty, the Police
Chief noted. was that he has
had no direct complaints irom
Negro students at the time the
incidents have occurred. The
students had been making their
complaints to college authori-
ties, and the complaints often
reached the police department
two or three days later,

The council meeting was at-
tended by over 70 citizens,
some oi whom asked why the
problem had never been
brought up before in the cerr
tury Grinnell College has been
in its present location. Mayor
Floyd Beaver agreed that “this

is the first time in the 115 year
history oi the city or Grinnell
that anything of this nature has
arisen,"

Sammie Fletcher, Loose
sophomore, noted that there
were more Negroes on campus
than ever before, and that the
civil rights struggle had been
brought into national aware-
ness.

Allen Jones, Protessor of His-
tory, and a Grinnell City Coun-
cilman concurred. ”Until
now," he said, “the people or
Grinnell have been sheltered
from the problems of Negro
students.”

The Negro students asked
for better protection from the
city’s police department (Proi'.
dc Coteau said earlier in the
sat; that he thought Chiet
Peters had a tendency to play
down everything that has hap<
pened as unimportant), and al-
so improved service irom Grin-
nell businesses.

CONSTITUTION OKAYED

By DAVE HORWATT
S 8: E Special Writer

A new Student Government
constitution will come up for
ﬁnal ratification in a student
referendum on February 13th.

The work on the proposed
constitution, which would re.
organize Grinnell‘s present Sen-
ate -— House Council Student
Government into a 13 member
body, was started last Novem-
ber by Tom Thomas. Thomas,
a member at the Constitutional
Reform Committee set up by
the Senate, felt Ihat there should
be a complete restructuring of
Ihe Student Government.

Early in November, at the
second meeting of the Consti-
tutional R are rm Committee,
Thomas presented a drait of
his new constitution.

At the same meeting, the com-
mittee also considered a bill
presented to it earlier by Neil
Fischer.

Fischer's bill would have cre-
ated the position of Ombuds-
man in the Student Guvem—
ment.

An Ombudsman is a people’s
protector in Scandinavian na.
tions who scrutinize: complaints
by individuals who think they
have been wronged by the
bureaucracy. Two student gov.
ernments, N.Y.U. and the u.
of Colorado, and several states
in the Union have proposed
Ombudsman or Public Protec-
tors.

Both Fischer’s bill and Thos
mas’s drait were accepted by

the constitutional committee and
drawn up into one constitution.

tee, Phil Bertenthal, (chairman
and Speaker or the Senate)

“Nail’em up if they don’t deliver!”

We can’t Tell You What To Do

A good part of the proposed Constitution passed
by the Senate Sunday night had its origin in the
8&3 offices last semester. The idea of a Student
Ombudsman or Student Co—ordinator was bandied
about by three of the present editors as early as the
beginning of last year.

We warn you that we are vouchsafed to sup-
port the new Constitution, which is to say that the
S&B is inherently biased in favor of the new Com-
mittee of Thirteen idea and the Ombudsman-Stu-
dent Co-ordinator.

But we do point out to the student body that
even the most severe and adamant critics of the
original proposal -— SGA President Ric McDowell
and conservative senator Tom Triplett (North
Younker) — now support the revised version with
few reservations.

A small Senate, committees composed of in-
terested students, a system in which any person can
suggest legislation, and a paid co-ordinator to tie
the whole thing together seems to us a feasible start
towards solving some of the problems that make
‘tihe student government the impotent body it is to-

ay.

The 5&8, however, must be considered a spe-
cial interest group in this matter. We're biased, and
we admit we’re voting for the new proposal.

But we can’t tell you what to do.

That’s Pretty Funny, Rich

The Pterodactyl is a pretty funny newspaper,
and its name is very apropos. In terms of layout and
semblances — be there any —— of journalism, it
really is a prehistoric monster.

The Mesozoic reptile was, after all, pretty ter-
rifying, but it didn’t do much of anything. It stayed
lip in the air, and when it came down to earth it

ied.

We don’t like being stabbed in the back by
Pterodactylic misinformation, dishonesty, shoddy
satire, and puny puns.

The Paper commended us yesterday for “steal-
lng" their "old format." Since when, Mr. Schneirov,
did your format look anything like ours? We never
noticed any classic type, professional cartoons, or
syndicated columns in The Paper.

Mr. Schneirov et 21, you should be the ones
congratulated for stealing something the $81.3 has
had for a long time. At least you’ll be able to read
The Ptei-odactyl this semester without going com-
pletely blind.

But What’s funnier, Rich, is your editor’s note
condescending to print an article on the new Consti-
tution “because the editor of the official student
newspaper of Grinnell College has refused to cover
SGA constitution changes. "

That s pretty funny, Rich.

If you peer into this issue, you might see just
a little bit on the new Constitution. And remember,
please, that we went to press before you did.

Baby, next time you want to criticize try get-
ting your facts straight. And don’t try satire unless
you can hack it, Rich, because it’s obviously not
your bag.

Now we know why you went underground, Mr.
Schneirov. Your paper stinks so badly you had to
bury it.

it? OKAYED

(Continued from Page 1)

Smith, Dale Stein and Neil
Fischer, completed the final
draft of the constitution after
three meetings.

They submitted it to the San-
Ile in mid-November.

Only intermittent considera-
lion was given to the consti-
munn- up until January 24m,
when a formal motion was made
to adopt it.

An amendment was offered
by Ray Horn. who wanted to
change the proposed in mem-
ber House Council elected at
large to an is member body,
so that each house would elect
its own president.

Hom’s amendment, which
was the only major proposal to
change the constitution, was
defeated 22 to 10.

Final approval for lhe con-
stitution was given at a special
Senate meeting held on Feb
ruary 4. The vote was 25 to
is with 1 abstention.

Phil Bertenthal, said he feels
the proposed constitution is
quite an improvement over the
present structure of the Stu-
dent Govemmeuf. “Under our
present system," he explained,
“we have 4 people doing most
of the work, 23 people doing
some of the work and 43 people
doing almost none of the wor ."

Before the new constitution
can take effect, it must pass
by a 60 per cent majority in a
student referendum.

The referendum is scheduled
for February 13 from 11:00 a.m.
to 1:00 pm. at Cowles and
Quad.

DEMONSTRATORS
DECRIED

(ACP) — Campus demons
strators who disrupt speeches
and obstnict employment inter-
views are “wholly incompatible
with the basic tenets of a great
university," University of Mich-
igan president Robberl Fleming
told Michigan State University
graduates at fall commence-
ment. the MSU State News re-
ported.

For years, Fleming said, unl-
versities have fought against
restrictions on speakers and on
many campuses the fight has
been won.

“How are we to explain,” he
asked, "that while all kinds of
speakers may come to the
campus, some of them Will be
so disrupted that their views
may not be heard?”

Some argue, and with merit,
Fleming said, that employment
interviews are not an integral
part of campus life and there-
fore should be conducted off
campus.

“Obstructive tactics, how-
ever, are not directed at all in-
terviewirlg but only at selected
interViewing,” he said.

“Others, he said, resolve the
problem by invoking a ‘hlgher
morality’ to determine who
should he allowed to interview.
"The trougle With this concept
is that it is not at all Clear
who is to be in charge of judg:
ing the dictates of a higher
morality," Fleming said.

He said the demonstrators
fail to recognize the nature or
the recruiting process — that a
student who signs up tor an in-
terview does so as an “exer-
cise of individual judgment.”

Sir: As a member of the campus

lo tell you that your coverage
of and editorial on the boycott
“escapade” was shoddy and
inadequate. There is violence

Sir: Your coverage and under-

able. I happen to know most

can tell you they thought your

done under the circumstances.

Allernaling Disapproval
Sir: This is an open letter to
President Leggett and deans
Thompson and Winters in voice
my disapproval with any dorm
change that would break up the
present four-year residence sys-
tem for men. Any advantages
that a change might bring are
not only countered but are out-
weighed hy the advantages or
the present system, which are
only too well exalted in many
College publications to pros-
pective students. I protest that
if is written that Grinnell Col-
lege is to have a free and
democratic society.

I ask you how much of this
free and democratic society is
involved in the administration’s
dictating to North Campus that
a change inusr and Will be
made? You—the administration
—and the Executive Council,
which is mostly made up of
people who won’t have to live
under the new system, have been
working on some sort ni a con-
crete proposal for a new res-
idence system, and while work-
ing on it, you have never asked
us if we want it. Despite this,
you, President Leggett, recent-
ly set up a Board meeting in

February in. im

Arizona to discuss the change.
May I remind you, sir, thal
when the students wanted some-
thing back in September and
October, you put your foot down
and said that while you were
president there would be no inn
crease in open hours in the
dorms and refused to bring it
before the Board.

You really don’t care how,
North Campus feels, but are
telling us what’s good for us.
1 must congratulate you, though
on not bungling :his effort as
badly as others you have made.
By keeping publicity to a min-
imum, the outcry will not be
heard until it’s too late and
then you’ll say "what's done
is done."

And what am I asking you
to do? l'm asking you to prove
me wrong. Show me North
Campus really does want
change. Have a referendum and
see if more than fifty percent
of the classes of ’69, '70, and
'71 on N.C. really want to
change. Ask them to answer to
this. .

I Although we are also in
lhe ranks of those disap-
proving the proposed “alter-
nating dorms” system, we
are not in agleement with
the above Mr. Plennonf, who
has apparently reached a line
conclusion on misinformation
and hot air. Point One: The
Executive Council has nothing
to do with the reorganiza-
lion of the residence hall
system; the Student Affairs
Commillee — which Includes
four representatives from the
sludent government (elected
by Mr. Pienuont and his
peers) —- is the agency re
sponsible.

Point Two: North Campus
Is not the sole guardian of
Grinnell, which is to say Mr.
Pierpont seems to have for-
gotten about lhe freedom of
the daniuns of South Cam-
pus, who will also be affected
by any change. Point three-
The son knows or no special
meeting in Arizona to dis-
cuss the change. ‘

Point Four: What Presi-
deni Leggett said in October
concerned open dorms and
and not a general change in
lhe residence hall system, so
Ihathasnnthinglo do
with the issue at hand. Point
Five: Nothing has been done
yet and when anything is done
President Leggett won’t do
if, students rcpresenring
Nonh and South campuses
on the Student Affairs Com-
mittee will.

Point Six: ML Plermont
hasn‘t presented any of the
advantages of the present
system mentioned in his first
paragraph. Point Seven: The
other things Leggeil may
have bungled have nothing to
do with alternating dorms.

§AYS ATTITUDES NEED TIME
CRAWFORD ON THE PROBLEM

By ZELTE CRAWFORD
(Sociology)

Recent developments between
the Grinnell Community and the
Grinnell Negro have brought
to the surface on issue that has
existed for some time, That
issue is the apparent tension
that has been building up be.
tween the two factions for -
number of years,

Most people on Gﬂnncll’s cam-
pus will probably agree that
something should be done to
change this situation, Present-
ly, however, the disagreement

 

 

ZELTE CRAWFORD

rests on the subject of what
change should be initiated, and
who Should inltiate it,

Some circles propose that the
Negro work more or less inde«
pendently in searching for the
method he thinks most expedi-
Grit.

Other circles have encouraged
the college administration to up
ply its own authority to assure
Negro students the rights that
are rightfully theirs as Grinnell
students and as American Citi<
zens.

Still another group proposes
that the white students must
act — with the administration
and the Negro, or without them.

After these approaches have

been exhausted — and it appear:
that this is the present predict-
ament on campus —- the problem
seems icr all practical purposes
to Still exist. Negro students still
avoid traveling downtown dur-
ing the evening, and avoid cer-
tain establishments because of
the threat of verbal and physi-
cal abuses; these abuses are
very real, as the past has prov-
en.

Although for the most part the
enthusiasm for action has some-
what faded, a few studenw and
taculiy members are still work
ing. through meetings between
Negroes and town people, for a
better understanding between
the two groups.

And yet, while these meetings
are taking place, Negroes are
Still afraid to venture down-
town during the night, and the
hostility that many of the citi-
zens of the town have shown

with increased intensity.

Action to change the present
situation Should have taken
place long ago — before it
reached this point. It is some-
what ludicrous to try to place
the blame on any single group
[or inaction and apathy because
it is apparent that the entire
Grinnell College population has
been guilty of the lethargy that
has allowed Negroes to suffer
undue humiliation.

Negro students themselves
have ignored numerous occa-
sions of unpleasant encounters
in the town of Grinnell, and have
Withdrawn tn the microcosm
that the campus prowdes. They
have failed to act for them
selves in many of these cases,
and have discouraged others
from acting ior them.

In other instances the Negro
students have responded by re-
porting incidents to college
authorities and city officials, but
no action resulted.

pleaded ignorance of the situa-
tion, and have attributed their
ignorance to the inability of
Negio students to communicate
their various problems.

The validity oi this piea might
be compared to the ostrich-head
in the hole analogy. That such
a large number of white stu<
dents profess to have “Negro
iriends", but do not possess the
sensitivity or empathy to realize
the dilemma of their ”Negro
colleagues," lends doubt to the
sincerity of their concept of
iriendship.

Yet, many of these students
who have so vehemently con-
demned Negroes for their lack
of action have experienced many
similar unpleasautries in the
town or Grinnell, and have re«
acted in a Similar manner.

Also, the question that inevit<
ably comes to mind is whether
or not the white student should
act when it is necessary, with
out the consent of the Negro
students on campus. Does the
Negro dictate the consciences
of white students?

Both of the groups already
mentioned conveniently point an
accusing finger at the college
administration. At most. in
action has been sloveti until
recently, and even now the et-
iectlveness of its action is queSe
tionable. The College adminis-
tration's responsibility to its
students becomes a salient issue
when examining the Negro stu-
dent’s plight in Grinnell.

That Negro students have
been experiencing discord ior
decades, while attending college
in Grinnell, has been confirmed
by numerous black alumni. Tlils

TVS SHUFFLED

In spite at a c or HP meet-

night, the question of what will
become of North Campus tele»
visions in the iace ni integrat-
ed campuses remains unan-
swered.

In an effort to unite North
Campus, Ron Cogswell asked
each of the hall presidents to
talk the matter over with indi-
vidual hall members. He indi-
cated that he favors the idea of
all halls keeping their TV'ii
Within the men’s residence hall
system, and all but one at the
North presidents backed him
with a resolution of similar
opinion.

Most halls don't want to com-
mit themselves definitely—it's
easier to wait and See what
everybody else does — but a
tentative headcount shows six
halls (Smith, Cowles, Gates,
East and West Norris, and
Langan) in favor of retaining
their tubes, one hall (Clark) in
iavbring or selling theirs, and
four halls (Rawson, Dibble, and
North and South Younlier) still
undecided.

The fact remains that the
only way men will be guaran-
teed television in their halls
next year is by keeping them
in the men’s hall system. Ono
thing is certain m the College

THE RIGHT

BY
win. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

I have a communication here born the Saturday Evening Post,
requesting that r publicize a current issue in which is featured a
story on Senator Thomas Dodd by his former ndminstrativo
asSistant Mr. James Boyd, which under the circumstances I
gladly do.

Here is an article, the beginning of a projected series the aim
01 which is to establish that Senator Dodd is a thief, a crook, l
hypocrite, and a thoroughly obnoxious human being. These ver.
dicts are reached by techniques which are interesting to any stu-
dent oi polemics, not to say slander, You read about young, ideal-
istic, clean-living, peopleloving, pure-minded James Boyd, who
in 1958 was attracted to Thomas Dodd. W y? Because Mr. Dodd

was, in those days, also idealistic, clean ng, people-loving and
pureminded. '

But, then alter a while, James Boyd discovers that the senator
really isn’t any longer all those things. He discovers that the sena-
tor really is using money that was intended Io finance his political
campaigns for personal expenses. He discovers that the senator is
derelict In his performance of his official duties. He discovers that
the senator accepts fees for his speeches and his articles. and the
free use of private cars, airplanes, apartments, whatever.

To expose the reliance on hall-truths and distortions of tho
factual thrusts of Mr. Boyd's allegations~which by the way are
apparently received by the editors or the Post as positively scrip.
tural in authority (incredibly, the editors did not check I slngll
allegation with Senator Dodd, not one)«is a halt-morning's work.

An example of a iactual charge brought by Mr, Boyd is “the
ornate Dodd silverware“ which “had been replated gratis by a
silver company at whose behest Dodd had urged changes in the
Treasury Department's silver policy," a charge that caught my
eye because when it was first levelled a year ago i took the trouble
to telephone said silver merchant only to tind that the repiating
cost was 315, and that Senator Dodd had insisted on paying for it,

That kind of thing hurts, oi cmtrse, hurts in the eyes of those
who have not had access to, or have not remembered, the facts.
out what is finally damaging is the subjective portrait or Senator
Dodd, concerning which no factual refutations are readily pro-
ducible. Mr. Boyd says that between the first time that he met
Mr. Dodd and the time that he decided to run to Drew Pearson
with his revelations, Senator Dodd had changed. That he had
grown arrogant. That he had grown callous. Supercilious. Lazy. Ir-
responsible. l . .

Now how does one go about dealing with such judgments? It
occurs only to the unusual reader to ask himself whether it is pos-
sible that during that same period it wasn’t the senator who
changed, so much as the author. During that same period the
author, a) effected a dalliance with a lady of loose morals, whom
he put on the senator's payroll; b) became estranged from his
wife and four children, c) subsequently took up with yet another
lady, the secretary of Senator Dodd to whom he is now married:
and d) discovered that Drew Pearson is the tons et orlgo of Ameri-
can morals.

Now there is an anti-Pilgrim’s Progress for you —- Meanwhile,
from the point of view of humble residents of the United States,
as also from the point of View of energetic members of the anti-
Communist community, Senator Dodd was appraised as the man
responsible for the most sustained, exhaustive, thoughtful series of
foreign policy speeches, reports, investigations, being delivered
anywhere to say nothing of a lively record on domestic matters,
His output was equal to that of three typical senators,

Who changed? Boyd or Dodd? YES, Dodd WIS censured - on
ii technicality which most knowing people admit a majority or us.
senators would be censured for it they had been so unfortunate as
to employ James Boyd as confidential assistant. And at course, the
continued persecution by Boyd et oi oi Dodd is saleable to a na-
tlonnl magazine, in the sense that the reverse would not be, It
Senator Dodd had arrived at the editorial ofﬁce of the Saturday
Evening PDSt accompanied by the Archangel or the Divine nee.
ords, which records absolutely established that Boyd was a liar,
a phimey, a cheat —— that august journal would likely not have
bought the story. Because Boyd, though now a public figure, is un-
important; whereas Dodd is important.

By the same token, Dodd cannot, as a practical matter, sue,
because the Supreme Court has Said (Sullivan vs. the New York
Times) that public officials cannot sue barring a demonstration or
“actual malice" which — —uliless the archangel is subpoenable —
is seldom provabler

And in any case, such suits cost more to bring than Mr. Dodd
has got. That is die iinni ilony, considering that Mr. Boyd's
charges is that Mr. Dodd got rich at public expense. Mr. Dodd
isn't even rich enough to sue the pans oft Boyd, which leaves Mr.
Boyd in the unaccustomed position of keeping his pants on.

DEFENDS GOP

By SUE MILLER

"The progressive way to deal
with racial moderation in the
‘deep South is not to talk about
it,” said Alabama Congressman
Jack Edwards at a South lounge
cotiee hour Monday afternoon,

Edwards, sponsored by the
Grinnell Young Republicans, and
brought here by the RSVP (Re-
pllbllcans Speak on vital Prob-
lems) group, was asked to speak
on the problem oi “The Future
DI the GDP in the South."

“Until more Negroes are reg-
istered.” he said, “a candidate
is not going to be out preaching
integration.”

“This is not my personal teelv
ing, but a person can't preach
it and win in the deep South."
“Again,” he emphasized, “l'm
taking practical politics to you;;
the Candidate that wins is not
going to say ‘I believe in inte-
gration.‘ "

"Calloway (Beau Galloway
who ran tor Republican governor
at Georgia) ignored the racial
moderation issue and almost
won, and Richard Flowers came
closest to anyone I know talking
about racial moderation, and lost
miserably."

Edwards himself, who, when
ﬁrst elected to Congress in 1964,
"had got less than one per cent
or the Negro vote in my dia-
trici,” in his 1966 re-eleclion, got
to per cent of the Negro vote
there.

"This was not too different
irom other Republican elections
In the Sout ,” he said.

In 1964, Edwards explained.
“We didn’t know any (Negroes),
nor (lid we ask them to vote.
Those Goldwater had asked, left
the party.”

In 1966, on the other hand,
“we made a conscious to do
what was right.”

“Military appointments were
made to Negro men in our high
schools,” he cited as an ex-
ample, “and we will have Ne-
groes as members or our county
committee.”

”This may not mean much to
you,” he continued, “but it you
can understand my part at the

That's when we started writing

Before she Joined her husband
as a performer, Caroline had
never sung “except in the bath-

cent of Joan Baez, she was “dis—

heard her sing at a party.

country, its leading to the
proper inroads in doing what's
right tor the people, in assum-
ing the proper role in our gov-
erument.”

Edwards related three areas
or the Republican party group
in the deep South.

The first era, as Edwards sees
it, was the "Post Oliice Era."

“The Republicans in the South
never did anything, except meet
once a year to pick who'd go
to the national convention."

When there was a Republican
lor president (to, Eisenhower)
“they could decide who’d be
postmaster, carrier, etc.”

“They never really got inter-
ested in building the Republi-
can Party in the South.”

"They did start to build it
in 1960 in the Kennedy-Nixon
race," Edwards commented.
“Many border states and middle
states voted for Nixon."

The secund era was
Goldwater Era."

“The South’s big boost," Ed-
wards regarded the Goldwater
era as “the basic on which we
(Republicans) could start to
grow.“

“My own county, Mobile,
turned out eighty-five per cent
registered voters. In 1964 this
was unheard of in the South—
where the primaries were usual<
ly the election” — where the
person chosen by the primaries
became the candidate without
any problem."

“Many Republicans washed
right back out on that tide when
Goldwater lost. Many are now
in the Wallace campaign." he
added, bringing up the third
era — ”The Wallace Era." Bet-
ter known as "the last hoorah,"
Edwards Commented, it will ac-
culminate in Wallace’s running
for President on the Alabama
Democratic ticket.

“Wallace will head the tlc»
ket," he said, “not LBJ." “it
an the ballot at all, "LBJ will
be a third party candidate. In
1954 on the ballot in Alabama
were Wallace and Goldwater."

“Wallace can probably pick
up 45-50 electoral votes,“ he
predicted “and then they”

POLL SAYS
SAVE NORTH CAMPUS

Most of the 119 students who
responded to last week’s SEE
poll an alternating dorms
agreed that the brick walls
blocking idea was not what the
Student Affairs Committee had
originally intended for alter-
nating dorms.

Student response this week——
roughly ten per cent or the
student body~was double what
it was last week.

Five at the ill answering
question seven thought that the
brick wall separation did re-
tlect what was originally meant
by alternating dorms, and 110
said no, this was not what they
believed to be the original in-
tention. (It must be noted that
not all questions or those re-
turned in the 5&3 were tilled in,
and so me results may not
necessarily tally with the
total,

In student comments the
brick wall was regarded by one
as “a Puritan blockade.” by
another as “the Berlin wall,"
and by a third party—a girl—
as “not a deterrent (against
Iv's), but an interesting chal-
lenge.”

Basic agreement also existed
on questions six and three —_
whether there should be an all-
cnmpus relerendum, and
whether IV's warrant a reorgan-
ization or the dorm system.

JD'S ——THE SPOT T0 EOVCDTT — FOR STEAKS

By ANNE TAYLOR

oh my poor disciples or full and gaityl I sincerely bemoan
your predicament this weekend at being isolated in the social
vacuum at Grinnell campus. I might suggest bciore unveiling the
oliicial Collegerurlented events or this weekend that you begin
now trying your imaginative powers ot divining means of self
entertainment.

This weekend is so dull that it might interest you to know
that last night you missed Palrick and Joan Purswcll’s Piano
and Flute Recital in Robert’s Theatre,

If the multitude of psychedelic posters plastered all over cams
pus have not yet revealed it, let me be the iirst to tell you that
this weekend Grinnell College is devoting herself religiously to
drugs. That is not to say she has gone to pot, but rather Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday will be set aside for an indepth Drug
Symposium.

This study or the drug scene was initiated last night with ii
program on Drug Education led by Dr, Joel Fort tram the Uni-
verSlty ot Caliiornia. The seminar program will continue today
with a Panel Lecture on Drugs at 3 pm. in Robert’s. The panel-
ists will include Dr. Joel Fort, Dr. Paul E. Bodlne from Iowa
State College and Mr. Frederick Garlield, Deputy Director or the
Bureau oi Drug Abuse Control.

At 7:30 p.m. Dr, Bodiue will lecture in Robert's Theatre, and
at 9:15 individual discussion groups will term in the lounges 0!
Loose, Younkers, and Main.

On Saturday morning at 10, Mr. Garfield will lead an In-
formal discussion in the South Lounge ol the Forum, and Dr.
Loren Woods mm the University ol lowa will wrap up the Sym-
posium Willi a lecture in Robert’s Theatre at 1:30 in the afternoon.

Well, how are you coming with ideas of What to do with
yourseli for three days, other than holing up in the library with
your iavorite volume of the Congressional Record?

Suggestion: Take a census ot The Grinnell College squirrel
population. Or, just try and iigure out what on earth they're
doing running in packs irom tree to tree, trom the comiort of
your Forum chair.

All your liydrohabituaies may rejoice along with those land-
lubbers gone a-seg for open SWlmming will be available Friday
irom 8:30 to lo p.m., Saturday irom 3 to 5 p.m., and Sunday night.

You ilick addicts might stick around though, cause the Social
Co. Committee has come up With a few good ones. Friday night
at 10 p.m. and Sunday at 9, sadists and history majors alike Will
enjoy the bloody epic of czai-ist Russia, Ivan the Terrible, a ﬁlm
in two parts, in ARH auditorium.

Saturday night, Charlton Heston, as a US. Cavalry ollicer
rides to uphold Truth, Justice and the American Way in the quasi-
Blblical Western, Major Dundee. The superrfabulous ﬂick promot-
ing sex and violence will be shown at 10 pm in ARH.

At 8 pm, also Saturday night, Father Ian Mitchell will hold I
Folk Concert in Robert's Theatre.

In chapel Sunday morning (which is held at 11:00 am for
those of you who don’t normally attend), Father Mitchell will be
conducting his Folk Mass (Episcopalian in nature) with the as.
sistance of the College Choir, as he did last year,

Well, that's it for better or worse and if you still don't like
it you can aways watch TV or better yet, ﬁnd out who your fellow
students really are.

i AUTHOR VIEWS CHANGES

By TOM THOMAS

How does the new System under the proposed
SCA Constitution really work?

First, the focal point of SGA will be the face-

lifted Senate (Commute

e of Thirteen). Almost all

iunctions or student government will revolve around

this central group. This

body's activities can easily

be seen as a combination or the duties of both the
present Executive Cabinet and the present Senate.

Members or the Con“ will be required to attend
all house meetings on campus. No one member will
be responsible tor a particular hall, but rather all

members will circulate

among all halls, gathering

ideas and giving iniormation about student govern-

ment,

Minortiy opinions ignored by one Senator may
be picked up by another. and the diverse views at
Student government may give a more realistic total

picture.

’Illls new group should be able to maintain that
Small-size working efficiency (like the Executive
Cabinet), while continuing actual representation of

campus opinion.

The basic responsibi

lity of the student ombuds-

man — another major topic of concern among Stu-
dents — would be to secure adequate representa-
tion ior students with both student government and
faculty-administrative bodies (such as the Commit—
tee on Academic Standing). The ombudsman would
maintain office hours, and would work with two as»

sistants.

The ombudsman, serving as a complement to

the position of SGA President, could well .be one of
the most important positions on campus, and cen-
talnly is a key to the success of the proposed Struc-

ture,

One tinal major point _ the role or the House

President. The House Presidents will be expected to

work more closely with the new student adviser
program (Still being ﬁnalized) and the resident ad»

visors.

These changes are only a part of the entire Sys»
tern. A realistic appraisal oi the constitution can be
attained only by viewing the entire proposal as an

interrelated structure,

This constitution is no perfect system. but It is
certainly a major step in the development of a real-

istic and eilective stude
College.

Although I maintain several major reservations
against the proposed constitution changes adopted
by the Senate, 1 do not necessarily urge defeat of
the proposal through student body ieierendum.

Student government at Grinnell urgently needs
a more viable dperdting mechanism, and the rein-
vesting oi the Senate with legislative authority is
consistent with the idea of distributing govexm
mental power among the Senate and the joint
boardsi With son elections rapidly approaching, a
new method of electing hall officers in conjunction
with residence hall innovations is an immediate ne«

cessity.

I believe an additional positive factor in the pro-
posed revision is the establishment of the office of
student coordinator a position necessitated by the
ever-expanding administrative functions at the SGA
and by the lack of communication between various
faculty and student government committees and the

student body itself,

Putting aside for a moment these practical con-
sideratiuns, there are several facets of the proposed
revision which need careiul scrutinyi Electing the
ten senators tit-large will mean that thirty—one Slu<
dent ofﬁces, or nearly every inﬂuential campus pas
Iition, will be elected by the student body as a

Whole.

Personal acquaintance and an intimate knowl-
edge of views could easily cease to be determining
factors in all lndividual's election. An essential cri~
terion for election In the Senate could become,
Literature, merely the maintenance of a campus

“name” for oneself.

I must also question the ability of these ten at-
large senators to effectively ascertain campus opin-
ion on major issues. Although certain more or less
artificial means for ascertaining this opinion have
been provided, i.e. required attendance by senators
at all house meetings, I feel that hall representa-
tion is inherently better suited for the effective rep-
reseiltatlon oi student viewpoints.

I repeat that the advantages and improvements
suggested by this proposed revision are indeed nu—
merous, certainly more numerous and wellrfounded
than the practical considerations mentioned abovei

A5 Student interest,

Contact. and involvement are

essential components of an eftective student gov-
ernment organization, each student must decide
whether this new Senate and the office at student
coordinator can best promote these components.

by college administrators which

That this (act has exlsted for
such a long period of time to-
cuses attention upon Griiinell
students who allow the admin-
istration to be so complacent.

There appears to be no quick
solution to the “problem”, but
prompt and convincing action
by all three groups must be
initiated immediately to assure
the black students on campus
protection trot-rt the animosity
oi bigotry which encompasses

IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT

SMITH COOKS HOME BREW

By RUSS ELLIOT
5&3 Staff Writer

In the oldest men's residence
hall west 01' the Mississippi a
few men are trying to revwo
an aglllg tradition —- Winemak-
ing.

In recent weeks hall interest
has been running high over the
possibilities winemaklng could
otter to another North campus
tradition _ the weekly znnk-
out. The stnli is easily made.
As one fellow articulated, “any
blockhead could put it together;
you just dump everything in
and let It sit."

When the pioneer batch was
opened and sampled this week,
however, the men’s spirits
seemed in danger of being
dashed on the rocks The pro-
duct, which has no name, was
compared to everything from
sake (rice wine) to Wild Irish
Rose.

What did the tasters think of
It? A few typical reactions:

“It tastes like hell.”

“It’s about the heaviest crap
I've ever tasted.”

“It's not clear like wine
should be, it’s soupy. No, it's
not soupy — it’s syrupy."

”It’s shit.

“It's too sweet. Low alcohol
content. And It's got some suit

of obnoxious taste that burn;
your mouth out. It's not smooth
and cultured,"

And in a Candid moment:

“I don’t care What it tastes
like, if it’s got alcohol in it I'Ll
drink it."

In case you are interested In
trying it, the reclpe includes
grape juice, sugar, yeast, rai.
sins, and water. Gallon jugs,
easily attainable from town
merchants make excellent con-
tainers {or the brew.

A rubber balloon should be
placed over the neck ot the
bottle, and the mixture set in
a warm place.

And some further inimrmation
about wine — though you can't
buy it, sell it or drink it pub-
licly, if you’re under twenty.
one, no place in the 720 Chap-
ters of the Iowa Code prohibits
you horn making it (privately).

(Editor‘s Note: Last sep-
tember ii and 15, THE EVE-
NING STAR in Washington
ran a series oi two articles by
noted civil rights lawyer Wil-
liam Higgs, which revealed
how Tairlie House, a ram-
bling Virginia estate current—
ly used by government agen—
cies as a “think center”, is
actually being controlled and
linanced by the CIA.

THE EVENING STAR later
denied all responsib ty for
the articles, but Higgs re-
mains adamant in delense oi
his accusations.

In last week’s Issue 0! the

ganization of Airlie House
and gave the agencies. such

(Note: Last September 14

Washington lawyer noted (or
his work in civil rights cases,
revealed It) THE EVENING
suit in Wuhlngton docu.
ments proving beyond reas-
enable doubt that Alrlla
House, a huge conterence
center in Warienton, Va.
which is used by many gov-
ernment agencies tor “think
sessions," is tirmly under the
mntrol oi, and has been fl-
nanced by, several govern-
ment agencies, notably the
out. In addition, Higga
proved that the entire conter—
ence center is elaborately
bugged for sound and taping.

THE EVENING STAR re-
ceived a call from Richard
Helms, director oi the CIA,
and on Seplr 19, it Publicly
apologized tor its two articles
based on Higgs’ intoi-uration,
asserting that Airlic is entire-
ly financed by independent
sources. But in a letter to
THE STAR written subse-
quently, Higgs pointed out
that THE STAR had exam-
ined only the tax and rev-
enue data from Airlie’s 1935
records, and reasserted that
it is the present Control. and
not the present linancing, ot
the Center that determines
its legitimacy.

Airlie House is suddenly in
the news this week, as the
International Association of
ChIeIs 01' Police have chosen
it as their meeting place.
The police chlets employed
one Negro consultant through

have remained a completely

to confront the police but
was iumed away torcehilly.

tive In this country.)

A GOOD OLD FASHIONED EXPOSE

THE CIA AND AIRLIE HOUSE

in 1957, Kenneth T. Young,
director or the State Depart
menl's Southeast Asia Altairs
desk and a Iel‘mer ofﬁcial in
Air Force combat intelligence,
prepared a lengthy private
memo that was circulated
among top government oiiici<
als. A supplemental-y imple-
mentation memo was then sub-
mitted to the Under Secretary
at State.

The basic memo asserted
that lriendly local leadership
in the developing countries of
the world was essential to the
iirrthering at us. interests
abroad. Young advocated the
cultivation and training of a
local elite group in these coun~
tries — in his words, “Ihe nil-
ing elite." Turning to the spe-
ciﬁc Young declared:

"In View of the highly devel-
oped military and police lech—
niqucs iii the West and particu-
larly in the us. and the spirit
or comradeshlp in the protes
sion oi arms, the military es-
tablishments In the newly do.
vcloping countries are proba-
bly the most open. friendly, and
sympathetic group irom our
viewpoint.”

II: COMRADESHIP IN
THE PROFESSION 0F ARMS

Young added, “The impor-
tant’targ‘el . . r is the mouth
mum number of the future top
elite sharing goals and values
compatible with our own.”

Another- excerpt from the

‘ WASHINGTON — The Ger.
[nan SDS (Solialistischer Deut-
sheer Studentenbund) Is a lot
like the American group with
the same initials, but its mem-
bers are more radical, more
organized and less associated
with a “love" kind of culture
than their American counter-
parts.

That’s the way three German
SDSers, on tour in this country
after attending the University
Christian Movement conference
In Cleveland last month, de-
cribed their organization here
lhis week. The three are all
students at the Free University
or Berlin. They answered ques
’tions about 5135 and Germany
'during a discussion at the ln-
stitute for Policy Studies, on
Independent research institute
in Washington.

Lutz Von Werder, one of the
Itudents, described the develop-
ment of Germany’s SDS Irom
a youth wing or the Social

Democratic Party (one ol Ger-
many's two major parties) into
an independent organization of
2,500 West German students,

According to Werder, a group
IJI about 50 students decided to
make a study of socialist and
Marxist thought in 1961. After
three years of study, they
formed SDS. Thls period of
study, says Werder, has meant
that “SDS has a strong theo«
retical position.” Even now the
organization requires all mem~
hers to take part in seminars
on political theory.

Berlin is the main center 01
SDS, and it has been the scene
of most of the student protests
to date Unlike IE counterpart
in the 1.7.5., the German stu-
dent group has until recently
been more concerned with what
other countries are doing than
with strictly national aliairs.

Reinholdt Wolff, a brother of
one oi the 5135 leaders, said
that protests last year centered
around the visits of Ioreign dig.
nitaries to Berlin. When Vice

THE GERMAN SDS

President H u m p h r e y was
scheduled to arrive last April,
for example, a group of students
decided to employ tactics like
those oi the Dutch Proves.
"They planned to throw pud-
ding at the Vice President,”
Woltl explained. “They were
going to throw some smoke-
bumbs, and then under cover
of the smoke to throw the
pudding." West Berlin unthon:
ties got wind of the plan, how-
ever, and arrested the students
before they could carry it oil.
A iew students, however, did
throw some eggs and tomatoes
at him.

(In spite of the use of provo
tactics and the tact that some
Berlin students live in Kam-
munes, which are similar to
hippie communities hero, SDS
and German students generally
have no connection with hippie
phenomena like drugs, “drop-
ping out" and psychedelic
dress.)

The visit of the Shah of Iran
early last June led to a clash

between students and the police
in which a policeman shot one
student, and other police bru.
tally beat several other pro-
testers.

The excesses of the police
won considerable support {or
the participating students irom
uncommitted students at the
Free University, and from Ber.
liners generally. The case of
one student arrested for throw-
lng a stone at the police, Fritz
Teuicl, became a cause oelebrc
in the city.

Teulel was eventually ao-
quitted, Before being released
tram jail, though, he managed
to participate in the anti-war
eiiorts on October zl by typing
up leaflets in his cell and dis-
tributing them to the prisoners.
Wolff said some of Teufel’s
leaﬂets carried the legend,
“The prisoners of West Berlin
affirm their solidarity with the
Viet Cong."

Germany's SDS is beginning
to concentrate more on devel-
opments within Germany than

to Wolii. Two present targets
are the emergency laws, which
the Bonn government is ate
tempting to pass to deal with
civil disorders, and the Free

By DAVID SALTMAN

JERUSALEM (CPS) — In all
the analysis or the Middle
East spawned by the Six Day
,War, everyone has ignored a
most critical question: what is
the relationship between “Arab
Socialism” and the “Israeli
Cooperative Movement?"

Israel's economy is largely
sociali . on per cent of its ln<
Idustry and do per cent of its
agriculture are run exclusively
by 288 co-operatives called
"kibbutzim," The kibbutzim are
the most advanced socialist
societies in the world. They use
no money or physical rewards;
everyone works according to
his ability and is taken care
of according to his needs.
There is no private property.
In short, one kibbutzim is the
Marxist ideal. the high gargelo-
rum nl social organization and
above all a system that works
III the Middle East.

Now recall that the Six Day
War—from the Arab side—was
I socialist war. The Arabs (ought
to counter alleged Israeli ag<
gression, which they claim has
grown steadily since 1955. Many
kibbutzim have Arabs working
on them—Arabs who live there
with their Israeli comrades.
During and alter the Six Day
War. the Arabs deliberately
bombed Kibbutz water towers
and power plants.

So tha Arab states are try-
log to build socialism by con-
demning Israel~which has the
most complete socialist units in
the World. Arab leaders are in
the unenviable position or sup-
porting Arah socialism while
condemning Israeli socialism
and bombing socialist com-
munities with Arab members.

Curiously the solution to this
paradox also solves the prob-
lem of a lasting peace in the

Mideast. First, some back-
ground.

It is increasingly clear that
the Six Day War was not really
a war started by the Arabs and
the Israelis, but rather by the
United States and the Soviet
Union. Robert Scheer discusses
this in the November issue of
Ramparts. He writes:

“The Mideast contains be
tween so and as per cent oi the
world's pI‘DVBll oil resources,
and at the moment accounts
for a quarter of the world’s
current production. . . All the
Arab dreams Ior the eventual
development or this region cena
ter in one way or another on
the utilization of this oil once
it is ireed from Western ex-
ploitation. For this reason, ‘Ar—
ab unity- is the here noire or
those Western powers that hava
had their own way in oil exploi<
tation. For if a real Arab nation
should ever come into being,
It would demand the return or
Its birthright. This is the threat
at Nassen‘sm.

“. . . In the post~Suez period,
the main Anglo-American con-
corn with Nasser resulted from
his leap into the oilrrich Arabian
south where, through the ve-
hicle oi the Yemen war, he
has become a direct threat to
the feudal regime of Saudi
Arabia, and the oil-rich scheik-
doms of that area.

“. , ,neither the British nor
the Americans have been wor-
rylng about. . . moral and
cultural issues (in the Yemen
War), It is, rather, the presence
or a Nasserite, antiacolonialist
thrust in southern Arabia, Where
much of the oil is found, that
disturbs the West."

It disturbs the kibbutzniks
that it disturbs the West. They
seem to be the only Israelis

A NEW HOIY WAR

who aren’t so happy about the
recent war. Being quite liter-
ate, and also socialist, they
recognize Scheer’s thesis that
oil interests, coupled with a
“frantically spiraling arms
race," caused the June war, not
the Arab "madmen." Even
though they’re Israelis, the kib-
blltziliks realize that Nasser has
been an enemy oi the West ever
Since he Conceived his socialist
programs to help the wretched
“feliahin” in Egypt and since
he dared to try to muscle in
on the Western oil monoply in
Saudi Arabia.

The members of the kibbut-
zim applaud Nasser's etiorts w
relieve his internal agonies by
trying to revolutionize Arab
politics. But they just snoot at
the “Palestine" smoke screen
used by Arabs as well as ls-
raelis to cover up the gut
problem in this area: again,
the inﬂuence of the U.S. and the
U. .S.R. In short, they know
where it's at.

So there are three questions
to answer before we can see
the road to peace:

—Can we get rid at for-
eign iniluence in the
Middle East?

—Do the Arabs and Is-
raelis want peace?
—What could be the basis
for a lasting peace?

As to the tirst—loreign in-
fluence—that is mostly up to the
Soviet Union and the United
States. . . and their citizens.

Do the Arabs and Israelis
want peace? There have been
some hopeful signs lately. Je-
rusalem Post special reporter
Dan Bavly writes:

“For the first time, the
thought oi coming to terms with
an Israel Government willing
to discuss the establishment or
a Palestinian Autonomy thas

become) a possible alternative
(IOI' the Arabs). . , .

“The Palestine Arab at the
and of 1967 is gradually read-
justing himseli alter the shock
of the Arab defeat In June. He
is beginning to accept the fact
that Israel will remain a m2<
jor influence (in the Middle
East). . . Though still tar irom
enthusiastic, most Arabs on the
West Bank agree that their
best bet would be to try to
negotiate peaceiully with the
Israeli Government rather than
prolong the IsraelivArab con<
fiict."

So at least Israel's power is
being acknowledged, and at
best the Arabs are willing to
coexist peaceiully with the
Jews. ,

Now the third question: what
could the basis he {or a lash
ing peace? Stephens writes:

“President Nassers' most re-
spected adviser on Ioreign at-
Iairs envisages a settlement in
two stages. In the first stage
there could be a phased with-
drawal of Israeli forces ac-
companied by steps to clear
the Suez Canal and measures
to Insure Israeli security.

“These would include demil—
Itarized areas on both sides of
the borders, occupied by UN
forces The Arabs would rec.
ognize Israel’s existence and
her security within the pie-June
frontiers. There frontiers would
be quaranteed by the Great
Powers so that the Arabs would
be ‘punished’ if they tried to
attack Israel.

“In this first stage, the bor-
ders would be , . . ‘secul‘ed.'
In the second stage would
come the negotiation of ‘rec-
ognized' borders and with it
the other broader aspects of
the Palestine question, the set<
tiement ot the refugee problem

and the passage of ships flying
the Israeli ﬂag through the
Suez Canal.

“. . the Jordan Govemment
is prepared to grant Israel ere
traaterritorial control or the
Wailing Wall and of the access
to it—What would amount in
etiect to ceding part of the Old
City of Jerusalem to Israel. In
addition, Jordan would accept
international supervision OI the
Holy Places.”

Naturally, this Will be nego‘
tiated. Israel will not under any
circumstances give up the Go-
lan Heights, on the border with
Syria, and Jerusalem may be
internationalized. But there is
surprising agreement between
these Arab proposals and those
finding wide acceptance in Is-
rael. Many Israelis are quite.
willing to return, with the ex-
ception of the Golan Heights,
the land captured in June. The
point is, though, that, contrary
to popular beliei. both sides
want to negotiate.

The important question—the
one which knits together Arab
and Israeli socialisms—is the
question at the future.

There are various conceptions
kicking around a m o n g the
Arabs, ranging from minimal
relations to a Middle East Fed-
eration with Israel as an au-
tonomous Jewish member. But
for some reason, no one has
mentioned the strongest and
most eitective plan: one which
not only ejects the Great pow.
ers but also capitalizes on the
common aims of Israelis and
Arabs. This is a socialist Mid-
east federation.

There is a clear basis, in the
kibbulzim, for a joint Arab-
Israeli experiment ill Mideast
socialism. It will be the great-
est irony oi all it Israelis help
make the Arab revolution.

The first two weeks of basketball have now been completed

and everybody has lept into the race with all the fervor and ex-
citement that one has come to expect from LM. basketball. Cowles,
after splitting with Gates. lost two games to Rawson. Rawson,
now tied with Smith for first place in the Treusdale race, is burst-
ing with enthusiasm. They met wth a large setback, however. when
the LM. board refused to sanction Dance I. M.’s as a legitimate
North Campus sport. Langan suffered an even greater loss when
Dave Luthy was lost for the season while performing for the
Golden Horde against the ti-eshman team. Langan promptly went
out and dropped two to Dibble. East pulled the big upset or the
year, so far, when they beat the Smith “A” team. The Gates ”A"
team (which was stacked) gave up only nine points to North in
the first half and was still behind. This pretty much typifies the
year Gates is going to have (Wait ’til paddle tennis). Nothing has
been decided, though, so I'm sure my progress reports will be
awaited with eager anticipation (yawnrgaper

Rich Wickstrom has dominated the college bowling league for
the last two weeks by averaging 200 for the last six games. Tho
team captained by yours truly (subtle plug) has leaped into first
place, however, with a N mark. High point of last week's keg-
ling was Mary Kay Earl trying to get a quarter out of a pocket in
her stretch pants. The old bowling league just ain‘t what it used
to be (chucklechuckle).

SCHAFFER'S ICEMEN COMETH

By JEFF SCHECKTER

Goals by Graham, Crandall,
and Jackson gave the Grinnell
Blades a 3-1 victory over Des
Moines at the Des Moines ice
Arena Sunday.

Grinnell dominated play in a
game of excessive roughness.
Des Moines was hindered by
eight penalties, tripping, rough-
ing, crosschecking, and board-
ing, which meant that they had
to play short a man tor a total
oi 16 minutes.

Although a few Blades were
intimidated to fight by an elbow
in the mouth and by a stick
across the back of the head,
it o t h i n g developed, enabling
Grinnell to avoid penalties, and
to play the entire game at full
strength.

Grinnell’s ﬁrst line of Gra-
ham, .l ackson, and Millikin
scored in the first 44 seconds
of the contest. Grinnell con-
trolled the face-off, shooting the
puck into the offensive zone.

Jackson dug the puck out of
the right corner and fed a well-
placed pass to Graham sta<
tioned in front of the Des Moines
net. Graham then beat the goalie
on a quick eight foot shot to
give Grinnell a lo lead.

The second line of Crandall,
Schaffer and Allen upped the
score 270 two minutes later.
Detenseman Joe La Moths
passed to his partner on the
blue line. Steve Gausebeck, who
fired a 60 foot shot. Crandall,
positioned in front of the net,
t o o k Gausebeck's s h u t and
slipped the puck past the Des
Moines goalie iot‘ the 2—D ad-
vantage.

The iirst period ended 2-1 af-
ter Des Moines scored from a
distance of 25 feet on a screened
shot.

Half way into the second
period, Grinnell earned its third
goal. Bruce Graham fished the
puck out lrorn behind the Des
Moines net and passed to Tom
Jackson, standing just outside
the crease. Jackson forced the
puck off the Des Moines goal<
ie's skate into the net.

A combination of good defense,
backchecking. and goal tending
shut out Des Moines during the
second and third periods.

CJEQCJEDCJE‘D

By J. VON ERIESEN RAZ

The chess master combines a unique set of talents, personality
traits, and abstract abilities, which he fashions into a highly dif-
ferentiated system of thinking and playing methods.

initially, he is dealing in a subject matter composed of schee
matic spatial (two- dimensional) possibilities for movement.
To the chess board he brings two capacities which are relatively
discriminating: a high nun-verbal intelligence and a powerful
memory capacity. The high nonverbal intelligence is furthermore
manifested in two forms: a spatial memory and a constructive
spatial imagination. The distinction made here is that the complex
abstract images with which the player works can hardly be con-
sidered either tactile or visual. By analogy, the chess master is to
visual images as the speed reader is to pronouncing each word.

The powerful memory capacity can probably be better under-
stood when it is seen that it enables the master to learn progres<
sively by experience, to refine his operating rules constantly by
means of the mental operations of abstraction and generalization
It a high rate.

The above generalizations are commonly understood by those
who have had relatively little or no experience with the game.
There is, however, another facility possessed by the chess master
which is often overlooked and warrants our attention.

The pendant oi generating hypotheses is testing them. For ex.
ample, over the board the choice of a good move rests largely on
foreseen possibilties for action and on the evaluation of foreseen
results. The thought process is essentially an emperical investiga-
tion — there is no a priori or deductive way to establish with cer<
tainty how much can be attained or how much can be proved (at
this point the problem of chess is strikingly different from that of a
mathematics problem). It is an investigation which terminates in a
decision necessarily based upon incomplete evidence, and neces-
sarily directed towards quantative results.
