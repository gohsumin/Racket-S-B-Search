Seen As Grinnell's Greatest Need

By Lynn Denzler

The immediate campus prob
lem of finding some basis for
co-operation in administrative
procedure between 5 t u d e n t
and adult leaders emerged as
the: greatest need at Grinnell
last night during the first con<
vocation of the year.

Dean of the College James H.
Stauss, taking the reins of ad-
ministrative leadership in Lbs
absence of a college president,
spoke before a capacity audi~
ence of faculty. administration,
and students in Herrick Chapel
on the question, “Whose Col-
lege is This?”

The well-worn
tween student desire and admin-
istration providence was not
explicitly outlined for the audi-
ence, but its veteran members
were aware of the attempt to
establish a new tone for the
year ahead.

"Our need today is for many
people to be able to say. ”This
is my college,’ " said Dean
Stauss, He spoke of establish-
ing ”Grinnell constituency," or
a joint enterprise among those
having varied interests—trus-
tees, alumni, administration,
faculty, and students. a

Quoting from a. statement
made in a report by Dr, Win-
ston L. King, formerly chair-

 

conflict be- .

man of th faculty and now
serving on the faculty at Van-
derbilt University, Dean Stauss
reported that Grinnell’s lack of
a clear image of what it is
makes it difficult for a good
college to become excellent or
superlative. Reading from the
1963-64 statement on the col-
lege by Drl King. Stauss said,

“We should concern ourselves
with what Grinnell college it-
self thinks itself to be." Look-

ing at the college as faculty
chairman and statesman, Dr.
King had been disturbed by the
apparent lack of institutional
self-consciousness. “What holds
Grinnell together as an institu-
tion?" he had questioned,

“My purpose is modest,"
Stauss continued, ”I want to
look at our self-consciousness—
to provide the cement.”

Looking practically at the
needs of the college, the Dean
spoke positively about What

 

Grinnell was doing for its silk
dents on the academic level.
”What Grinnell should be do-
ing, she is doing.” he said, in
reference to a liberal arts edu-
cation which is both general
and specific.

“Your education here is tak-
ing you past the gateway of
facts," he said. “The general
education provided here can
make you an intelligent ama-
teur, while depth exploration in
the major field is making you
an intelligent apprentice in the
field of your choice." Dean
Stauss described the college as
an expert in meeting these two
requirements in liberal ethics,-
tion.

In trying to apply what the
college is offering to what the
students allow themselves to
receive, the problem of Grin-
nell inconsistency became
more definite, “Students often
fall short in exploration of a
liberal education and in the
practice of commitments,”
said the Dean afoer listing what
he considered prime commit-
ments for students seeking a
liberal education: '

1) to humane understanding

2) to reform, responsible alts
izenship

By John Wolf

When the College Forum
opens sometime after Novem-
ber 1. it will not have the anti-
septic atmosphere that might
be expected of such a modern

. structure. This assurance was

given by Vice President Merritt
Ludwig as he described the
furnishings for the Forum. In-
cluded in these plans are Kelly
green carpeting in the billiard
room and deep purple carpet—
ing in another room,

Ludwig noted that the build—
ing was designed with many
“nooks and crannies” that Will
provide semi- rivate meeting
places, There Will not be “cells"
as there were in the old union.

Ludwig further explained
that the forms into which the
concrete for the Forum was

’ poured were made of hemlock.

This wood has been found to
have the correct absorption
qualities to leave imprints of
of the wood in the hardened

 

concrete. A different technique
was used in construction of the
library and fine arts center in
order to give those structures a
monolithic effect, Ludwig said,

Ludwig could give no specific
date for the opening of the
Forum “because the last 5 per
cent of the work takes a dis
proportionate amount of time to
complete," Presently. workmen
are awaiting a shipment of eleoc
trio cables.

The building will have the of-
ficial name of the College Fon-
uml Ludwig said that the term
“union” didn't fit this building.
"This is a new departure, not
a continuation of the old,“
Ludwig commented.

Mrs. Jewell Hawk has been
named Director of the College
Foruml Previously Mrs. Hawk
was hostess at Grinnell House.

Because of the uncertainty of
the completion date, no event;
will be scheduled in the Forum
until after the Christmas tweak.

Hello Freshmen - -

I After six days on the Grinnell campus you must
feel pretty welcome. Everything has been geared to
your wants and needs; group leaders, faculty members,
college officials and various upperclassmen have been

on hand to help you keep up with the fast pace of New
Student Day activities. In short, the service has been

.wonderful.

Our purpose here is not to add any more time-worn
phrases of welcome. You know you are. We don’t need
to extol the glories of Grinnell college; the catalogue
does that; neither do we need to elaborate on the exten—
sive talents and capacities of the in-coming studentse
your own records have already done that You know

what Grinnell can do FOR you and you’re ready for it,
But are you ready for what Grinnell can do TO you?

‘ In some ways Grinnell is like a giant “self service"

store — you walk around in the midst of extensive mer—
chandise and reach out and take according to your de-
sires, Things are attractive and they're at your disposal,
if you just take the time to reach out and grab,

But soon you start to take too much time, because
there’s so much you want. And you aren’t satisfied with
what you can profitably use and benefit from. You
must take more and more from the shelf, and as you
pile it around you, you become isolated from others
Walking around the same store. You don’t have time
for them because you have to keep reaching out for
more things on the shelves. And the more you pile
around you, the less you care what the others are doing
as long as they don't interfere with your visit to the
store.

This college is an institution; you and your fellows
are its community The shelves of the institution are
well stocked; and the members of its community are
serving themselves. In order for the institution to be
able to provide anything worthwhile from its shelves,
the community must henefitas a whole after each mem-
ber has done his part to equip himself adequately to
serve as part of that whole. But look at all the parts
which are working over~time to serve only themselves.
They will eventually break down from over—exertion
and all their grabbing will have gained them nothing,
And, by then, the shelves will be empty.

3) sophisticated entertain-
ment for self and friends.
‘ He then called for a "full
consciousness of commitments”
—among the student body to
provide the image that Grin-
nell is apparently lacking,

Students who had come to
hear positive statements on
what plans were made in social
reglulations on campus didn’t
receive definite answers, but
were neverthlass aware of an
administrative tone that called
for joint effort in the area of
rules and enforcement, as well
as an appeal for Increased acv
quiescence rather than need-
less conflict.

In an opening statement be-
fore the Dean’s address, Ken~
you A. Knopf, chairman of the
faculty, stated that Grinnell’s
goal for the year should be
“liberal learning” He spoke of
responsible behavior as a ne»
cessity for survival and pro—
grass of moiety and in refer»
ence to joint effort in pursuit
of the goal of liberal learning,
asked for a workable relation-
ship between separate groups.

The same tone appeared later
in the convocation when the
Dean spoke of me Grinnell
style of living in the realm
of liberal education. "There is
a need for the style of living to
be a strong, supporting, integral
part The reSldents in liberal
education are not full in the
culture of liberal education.
There is a mixture here:‘too
much is alien to liberal educa-
tion.”

Obviously referring to the
record of dispute between stu-
dents and administration over
the social living regulations,
Stnuss Stated that in matters of
conflict, there must be an
equilibrium of policies, “The
trustees don’t get everything
they want; the faculty doesn’t
get everything it Wants; the
administration doesn't get ev-
erything it wants. and the stu-
dents don’t get everything they
want," he continued.

ministrator [oi- the college, the
Dean said that college govern-
ment, the trustees. administra-
tion, and faculty should have
primacy, while the students
have influence. Conclusions, he
stated, would come out of this
lprocess of Self-restraint and
common sense.

Sensing probably dissatisfac-
Lion among student leaders and
members who are still looking
for some definite answers to
obvious conflicts, Dean Stauss
aslced his audience for belief
in the sincerity of purpose in
his statements. He showed ex-
press concern for the health of
the college community, stating
that any role in a young per
sons life for the period of four
years is a serious assignment.
He stressed that there is 3 del-
initc place for ,conservative
guidelines, and concluded:

The convocation, a regular
feature of the New Student
Days program, featured an aca-
demic procession as well as
the addresses by Knopf and
Dean Stauss. The Grinnell Col.
lege Choir. under the direction
of Don Jones, made its first
formal appearance of the yea!
singing four selected Psalms.
Music was provided by Elbert
Smith, college organist. Do-
spite a heavy mist and consist-
ent rain, the Chapel was filled
for the occasion with many
students having to stand in the
back. It was the first official
appearance of Dean Stauss be-
fore the student body since the
resignation of former president
Howard R. Bowen July 1.

 

Next weekend leaders of stu~
dent government and faculty
and administration members
with positions which are in~
volved with student affairs
will gather at a camp near
Boone for the Student Leader-
ship Encampment.

These 40 students and 20
members of faculty and admin
istration will spend the weekend
trying to work out some of
their problems and to lay the
ground work for some of their
activities for the year. It IS
hoped that the weekend will be
profitable to all and that it will
save much time throughout the
year.

Though there will also be
some recreational activities and
free time, much of the week-
end will be devoted to discus-
sion group meetings. Each par-
ticipant has been assigned to a
discussion group in the area of
his activities and interests.

gtauss Welcomes New Students —
Stresses Maiuriiyeand Realism

l By John Wolf

l Dean of the College James
H. Stauss outlined the goals of a
ilberal education and gave
some deanly advice in a speech
welcoming this year's fresh-
man class Monday evening in
Roberts Theatre.

Staliss said that a liberal edu-
datlon liberates the mind from
i) a narrow field of informa—
tion, 2) narrow considerations
of government, and 3) boredom

f entertainmenti It further al»

ws a student to gain a come

tent understanding for select»

g a careerr

“A student’s cardinal failure
in seeking a liberal education
s indifference to educational
Mndards.” Stauss said.

Stauss drew his advice to the
freshmen from observations of
nst classes. He stressed five
Kaine.

“First of all, you should be
realistic about the mathematics
of competition. Only one stun
ilent in two can be in the top
half of the class.”

Stauss then noted the aca-
Hemic and social pressures to
which all students are exposed.
He suggested that these pres-
rures help curb the tendency to
'goof off” but. that students
lhould, in a sense, budget their
pressures by not trying to do
too much.

Profs' Promotions
Recently Approved

Three Grinnell College fac-
ulty promotions have been an-
nounced after approval by the
college's Board of Trustees

Promoted from assistant pro-
lessor to associate professor
were Dr. Luther E. Erickson,
chemistry, and Richard D.
Meyer, speech and theatre.
Meyer is also the technical di-
rector of the theatre

Instructor promoted to as:
listant professor was Arnold
Hdelberg, mathematics. All of
the promotions were effective
sent. 1.

“Look to your maturity" was
Stauss's third point of advice.
“Maturity is the capacity to
cope with the struggle between
dependence and independence,
freedom and selfrrestraint, and
dignity and personal conduct.”

“My fourth point concerns
the relationship between ma-
turity and the question of
whether you can do what is
expected- of you.

"While accepting increased
independence you can not meet
all the conflicting expectations
of you You can’t be all things
to all men. Don‘t be trapped by
what others think your abilities
to be. Declare your independ—
ence of unrealistic expecta-
tions." \

The fifth point of advice was
miscellaneous. Stauss asked
the freshmen to keep their
sense of humor, or, if they
didn’t have one, to develop oner

Finally, Stauss advised the
new students, “Don't believe
all this baloney you hear” along
the grapevine,

Following.5tauss’s address,
SGA President Phil Johnson
gave a welcoming message in
which he noted that Grinnell
has its fine reputation in part
because students in the past
have cared about the problems
outside the college community.
He cited involvement by Grin-
nellians in the nuclear test ban
Controversy, the civil rights
Struggle, and Uncle Sam's Club

By Lynn Denzler

Professor Kenneth Christian-
sen (biology) welcomed mem<
bers of the freshman Class into
the “biggest poker game in his
tory” and outlined educative
goals for them during the Lib
eral Arts lecture Monday often
noon in Roberts Theatre.

”Your role in this century

, concerns the success or failure

of humanity,” he said ”You
may be part of a force or a sin-
gle mover, but in either case
you will be a determiner."

The first of several New Stu-
dent Day programs in Roberts
found the freshmen filling al~
most all the seats in the theatre
as they heard Christiansien
speak about humanity as an ex
periment now facing the test of
survival. He encouraged the
campus newcomers to proceed
to fill their Own role in this
century by pursuing a liberal
arts education.

Five goals to come from
Grinnell experience named .dur—
ing the lecture and emphasized
by the speaker were:

1) learning how to educate
your self

2) achieving a calling

3) learning how to enjoy
life more fully

4) an awakening of social

consciousness

5) the maturation of moral
security.

“Education is something you
have to learn on your own and
with the tools you gain here,
you can remain 3 student the
rest of your life," he said.

In telling the freshmen that
they should learn to enjoy life
more fully during their years
at Grinnell he stated that
not all of life here concerns
time for “dalliance, drink. and
digestion.” Rather, he urged
them to cultivate a type of in-
sight so that they could deter
mine those “things which are
a joy forever and others which
leave a bad taste in your
mouth.”

Christiansen s p o k e out
strongly for racial equality
while urging his audience to
learn to live together. He spoke
of racial prejudice as a “can
car which must be stopped
now,” and registered hope that
the current educational genera»
tion could “pay on the prom.
issory note which Lincoln
signed years ago,”

In expressing a real concern

 

for world peace, the biologist
spoke out: against the ego-cen-
tricity or nations. “World gov-
ernment must come in your
lifetime or the prognosis is
grave indeed,” he warned.

Toward the fifth point, the
maturation or moral security,
Christiansen urged the new stu-
dents to start making their own
decisions and to set up a se»
ries of moral standards for
themselves. "Don’t: drift into
the sump or conformist moral-
ity.” he Said. “There is Consid-
erable latitude in this area."
Concerning the making of decis-
ions, he stressed that “privilege
can never be divorced from re-
sponsibility.‘!

Referring to those goals
which he had listed, and others
which confront incoming stu-
dents, Christiansen assured
them that the road would not
be entirely smooth, but that

Christiansen Outlines» Educative Goals; Challenges Frosh
To Take Their Role in Determining Fate of Humanity

they should always climb out of
the pitfalls and go on.

The proressor w a r n e d
against the “quicksand of pet-
ty activity and told the fresh-
men to “guard time as preo-
lous.”

While not degrading the spirit
of revolt, Christiansen was
Critical of misdirection in re-
voltr “Don’t, batter against
straw men such as women’s
hours or open dorms, but take
an interest in bigger issues like
race and world peace.”

Finally, he told freshmen not
to be governed by an external-
ization of their problems.
”When trouble starts, the SO:
lution starts with you, then use
sources. available here," he
said. .

“At any rate, come on strong-
ly—the future of man is in your
hands. Godspeed and good
luck,” he concluded.

Eros/2 End First Week,
Start To (lass Today

By Susan Taylor

When classes ‘started this
morning, it was with the relief
of the upperclassmen who have
been here all week and with
mixed feelings on the part of
the new students. There was
the excitement that goes with
the start of each new semester
and the promise solemnly made
to self that “I will do better
this time."

The start of classes\signified
the end of a busy week of New
Student Days for the 385 enter-
ing freshmen and transfer stua
dents who arrived last Sunday.
The five days of orientation in-
eluded testing, lectures, group
meetings, conferences with ad-
yisers and social events. L

The house presidents busily
comparing their freshmen at
early dinner, and the fresh-
men busily comparing their
house presidents at late dinner
were common sights. Every-
body seemed to adapt easily to
the geography of the campus,
but soon learned that new paths
would have to be formed since
a couple of mountains which
are impassible had grown up
on the campus during the sum-
mer.

But these were minor prob-
lems m the freshmen and
group leaders who were caught
up in the busy schedule of New
Student Days activities.

Monday morning saw the
yearly tests in
which were given to the fresh
men, but this year they only
had one morning of testing.
The reaction was varied, but
few were too disappointed to
have the test over.

Tuesday evening was the
time for the annual picnic for
new students and faculty ad<
visors and their families on
central campus. The picnic was

College" by Professor Jones.
and Thursday night was con-
votation.

Throughout the week the vari-
ous activities of New Student
Days went along smoothly, ac«
cording to one of the social
chairman. There were the tra
ditional co-ed dinners, trips into
the city of Grinnell, liberal arts
discussions. .houso meetings,
serenades, water fights, trips
to the book store, conferences
with advisors, conferences with
students about the conferences
with advisers, speeches, wel-
comes, and various not-so-tra—
ditional activities.

The moving in started all
over again with the arrival of
the upperclassmen on Wednes-
day, As they glanced around
the campus to see if the new
uniondtather, The Forum—
was finished, one was heard to
comment, ”I wish they would
clean up one mess before they
start another.”

Yesterday it was all kinda
summed up with registration,
and it was heard that the regis-
trar and the deans were re"—
lieved when it was all done.

So 'today the academic pro-
cess we call liberal education
started again for another se-
mester. For those starting their
first semester and those start—
ing their last, it was a time of
beginning and of beginning
again. There were old friends
to see, and new friends to
make. There was the news to
catch up on and the brand new
books to read. And there was
always Saga food.

Character of Grinnell
Seen Through History

, By Susan Taylor

‘ "Something of the uncom~
. romising idealism of the
ounders_ of this college is a
lpirit worth maintaining in our
me,” according to Prof. Alan
ones, history. Mr. Jones deliv-
ered the annual History of
ﬁrinnell College lecture to the
new students and other inter-
sted persons in Roberts Thea-
or Wednesday night. ’

Jones interpreted the story
at the college by studying the
thoracter it possessed under
ﬁle leadership of its various
wtstanding presidents, rather
Ihan reciting happenings which
were significant in its physical
growth.

From the beginning, as the
hunders and first trustees
ﬂesired, Grinnell was a center
of liberal ideas in learning, but
Elsa a Christian enterprise, the

'story teacher explained. He
pointed out, however, that the
foals or free inquiry and iso-
lated study which were held
by the first trustees have not
enjoyed a consistent place
here, but rather were present
under~the leadership of some
presidents more than of others

Throughout the history of the
Mllege redefinitions of these
goals have taken place. But

om the beginning Jones ex-
plained, the college “was in-
volved with the spirit of the
West, a dream of quest and of
opportunity.”

"A tradition of free inquiry
.was present from the begin-
ning,” Jones said. “The origins
D! the college as a religious
land moral as well as an intellec<
coal endeavor” were also ex-
plained

Looking back, Jones said,
one can observe the vision of
the trustees when they set up
their plan for an isolated place
[or study, away from the cares
of the world. However, he also
pointed out that as Grinnell
came more into the conscious-
ness of the nations, its involve<
lnent in the affairs of men in-
nreased.

The college, though it gained
I national reputation in the
early part of the 20th century

 

still remained a small school
struggling for its ideals, he
said.

Mr. Jones cited many ex-
amples of the writing of mem-
bers of the college commun-
ity throughout its history to il—
lustrate the ideals which have
been continually held.

He pointed out that the con
sciousness of community in-
creased with the building of the
residence halls,

”Compared to its past,"
Jones commented, “the college
is stronger than ever both in-
tellectually and morally."

Alan Jones graduated from
Grinnell College in 1950 and re-
turned as a member of the his
tory faculty in 1954. He has
been here since.

Dean Thompson:
7 Observations '

By John Won

“The students now are mov-
ing faster; they are more con-
cerned about more things, The
students of the late 50’s, when I
was attending Grinnell, were
pan of the ‘apathetic genera-
tion’; they didn’t take up social
causes," These were among
the first observations of 5. Eu-
gene Thompson, Grinnell’s new
dean of men. _

0n the matter of college reg-
ulations, Thompson explained,
“This is a horrible value judg~
merit and perhaps it is too
early to be making it, but from
What I have heard I think the
students in my time lived with
the social restrictions better
than they do now."

Concerning his policy,
Thompson said that he consid-
ered himself an administrator
of the rules of the college.

Thompson has been meeting
formally and informally with
administration representatives
and SGA members.

“I especially enjoy getting to-
gether with the faculty mem-
bers; nearly half of them were
here when l was a student at
Grinnell. It's good to be bac ."

Freshmen Greater in Number. lisi Social Studies
And Medicine High in Professional Goals - Sauers

The facts and ﬁgures of
Grinnell’s class of 1968 have
been released by Robert Sauers,
director of admissions.

Of the 356 freshmen, 53 per
cent of the men and 63 per cent
of the women were in the upper
lo per cent of their high school
graduating class. Ranking in
the upper quarter of their class
were 83 per cent of the men
and 88 per cent of the women;
94 per cent of the men and 99
per cent of the women were in
the top half.

In other categories, 20 per
cent of the men and 15 per
cent of the women were high
school class officers. Student
council posts were held by 36
per cent of the men and 28 per

cent of ilhe women. Nearly 70
per cent of the men partici-
pated in some form of athletics.
D r a m a and debate were
among the activities of 69 per
cent of the men and 65 per cent
of the women. Nearly half the
men and almost two-thirds of
the women were involved in
high school publications. Inter-
est in music and art was pro—
fessed by 63 per cent of the men
and 78 per cent of the women.
This year Sauers compiled a
list of professional goals among
the freshmen. The breakdown
is as follows: biological sci-
ences, 8 per cent; ﬁne arts, 2
per cent; languages, 9 per
cent; mathematics, 8 per cent;
physical sciences, 3 per cent;

literature, 9 per cent; pre-engi—
neering, 4 per cent; pre-law, 5
per cent; premedical, 12 per
cent; social -studies, 31 per
cent: undecided, 11 per cent.

Sauers noted that the “uncle
aided" category has decreased
from nearly 50 per cent several
years ago to 11 per cent this
yearr Sauers attributes this de
crease to the fact that liberal
arts colleges are tending to-
word a preprotessional smtus.

Sauers said that about 100
more applications were re-
oeived this year than last year.
The number of applications
varies between about 850 and
1200 from year to year and fol-
lows tha population curve very
closely.

College Meels A

Ford Program
In June. 1964

Last June Grinnell announced
successful completion of its
$6,000,000 F or d Foundation
Matching Fund program.

In a joint statement, Edwin
S, Hewitt of Libertyvllle, Ill.,
chairman of the Board of Trus-
tees, John W. Norris 0! Mar-
shalltown, 13., Chairman of the
FFMF National Committee,
and Grinnell President Howard
E. Bowen revealed a total of

' $4,250,000 raised from trustees,
alumni, and others friends—
$Z5OJJOD more than the amount
needed to quahfy for the match-

ing sum of $2,000,000 offered
by the Ford Foundation.

The foundation’s challenge—
one of eight made to selected
liberal arts colleges in Septem-
ber of IBGl—Was to give 52,-
000,000 on a one-to-two match
ing basis. The college had
three years in which to raise
$4,000,000 from sources other
than government grants.

“The successful completion
of this program serves to dram-
atize the great loyalty to and
the tremendous interest in
Grinnell College on the part of
an ever»widening circle of
friends and supporters," Hewitt
laid.

Norris spoke of quality gains
which have resulted from the
program. “These funds," he
said. “have reached every de-
partment of the college in one
Way or another, have per—
mitted exceptional advances in
the academic and cultural pro-

rams of the college, and have
ed to extensive new construc-
tion and renovation of exist-
Aug buildings”

President Bowen praised the
trustees for "Vigorous leader»
ship and dedicated generosity,"
saying that “the $1,600,000
pledged by trustees at the out-
set of the program signaled a
Successful campaign from the
yery beginning, and triggered

Campus Construction Continues:

Add New Wing To Science Hall

' The scene of campus con-
ltruction, formerly restricted
to the Forum, has now ex-
panded to include the area
around the Hall of Science
where work on a million-dollar
‘dditi‘on is now underway.

The project,.which includes
building of two new structures
4nd substantial alteration of
the existing science building,
Will add 33,500 square feet of
pace to the college’s science

cilities and is expected to be
eady for occupancy by the fall

f 1965.

The new construction will in-
niude an addition to the pres-
znt building—two levels and

a sement embracing 30,500

quare feet—and a new green-
Elouse totaling 2,863 square feet

Size.

“The present Hall of Science

only 12 years old. but we
ave already outgrown it,"
ean of the College James H.
tauss, acting president, said
day, “When this new project
a completed the college will
ave increased facilities for in-
atruction and research in the
sciences by about 6|) per cent"
He cited three urgent reasons
or expansion of science facil-
ties at Grinnell:

ll To enable the college to

 

meet increasing enrollment: in
this area of instruction.

2. To permit expansion of op-
portunities for independent
study, as well as student re-
search in collaboration with
faculty members.

3. To provide specialized re-
search and teaching facilities
which have previously been
impossible because of the lack
of space. These special facili-
ties, 'in addition to the green-
house, will include a "hot” lab-
oratory for working with radio-
active materials, and a con-
stant - temperature laboratory
for use by the biology depart-
ment.

When the project is com-
plete, the Grinnell physics de-
partment will be housed in
completely new quarters. oc-
cupying the basement and first
ﬂoor of the addition. The chem-
istry department will retain
its present quarters, but will
expand into the second floor of
the new building. Biology will
expand into the area vacated
by the physics department.

“The total science facilities
will be fully air—conditioned
when the project is completed,"
Mr. Stauss noted, “It will pro-
vide space for future faculty in-
creases in each department,
and will permit each faculty
