In Des Moines

More than 40 Grinnell Stu-
dents went to Des Moines Tues-
day to join an election day
march and rally sponsored by
Students for a Democratic So-
ciety (SDS), The reasons given
for the demonstration were: 1)
The election was a hoax, be-
oauso the positions of the major
candidates were so Similar; 2)
this “law-and—order” issue, as
used by the candidates, was a
cover-up ior racism; 3) The
US. should withdraw at once

Nations.

The 300 marchers met at 2:00
PM. Tuesday in Good Park, on
the west side oi Des Moines,

anizers of the demonstration.

lans for the march were made
with the intention of discourag-
ing any provocation ot police
by Wold or deed. "This is a

SDS member.

After some discussion. the
marchers agreed to a police

Last Saturday night the
annual charity auction was
held in Darby gym. $1,525.50
were raised for the World Una
lversities Service and the

$310 to East Norris, two of
Miss dc Lecluse’s famous
chocolate cakes which sold
for $20 a cake, and the pres-

Quad Saga Workers Settle
As Weekend Strike Concludes

Sago: Help Use

Union Tactics

The strike by Quad workers
against Saga included urging
st..::.ts s Itif‘itiDitC to the
walkout to employ various tac-
tics to put political pressure on
the food serVicer At first, these
actions took the form of in<
tentional sloppiness, but aiter
Saturday's lunch the pressuring
took on a different character,
After the work stoppage had
been called, students were
urged by the strike leaders to
eat only at the Quad. and to
“eat but don't be neat.” The
purpose was to make the
clean-up job after the meal
longer and more difficult than
usual, so that meals would iall
behind schedule, and the
strike-breakers would reconsld<
er their role in the strike. Dur-
ing lunch on Saturday, sympa-
thetic students were doing as
the Strike leaders had asked.
Dishes of food were dumped on
the floor, butter. mayonnaise,
and other types of dressings
were smeared on the tables,
and there were minor food
fights and occasional destruct.
tion of glasses and silverware
The strikers came in to eat
just beiore the regular closing
time, and by that time the
tables had been so successfully
covered that there were none
available for them. So the
strikers ate on the floor at one
end of the hall, leaving their

Gates Lecturer Foresees Campus
As New Land for Moral Activism

Dr, Bi Davie Napier. Dean of
the Chapel and Professor of
Religion at Stanford University,
was here last Sunday. Monday,
and Tuesday (0 present the loss
Gates Lectures. The theme for
his three lectures was “on New
Creation". “New Creation" re<
suits when man becomes more
conscrous of himself, both indi-
vidually and collectively. Napier
applied this to the educational
institution, to America, and to
the world.

Dr. Napier, a specialist in
Old Testament interpretation,
has gained a national reputation
in the last three years as Dean
of the Chapel at stanlord.

The theme of Di: Napier's
lectures was that man “doesn‘t
know Where he is going. but he
knows what he wants: a new
land. a new race, and a new lan-
guage.” Dri Napier labeled ”the

new land” as the American
campus, “the new race or peo-
ple" as the American people,
“transformed by the icnewcd
power of their minds.” and “the
new language" as a world with

College Reports
$137,000 Deficit
In Yearly Audit

During the academic year
1967768 Grinnell College main-
tained a $137,001] deficit accord-
ing to Mr, Donald Lambie,
Treasure of the College.

The income tor the year was
$5,019,279 and expenditures were
$5,156,883. Average enrollment
was 1140. The cost of the educa-
tion for each student was there-
fore $4,523. Since the tuition and
fees amount to $3,100, the stu-
dent who pays iull ices only
pays ior 68.5% the cost oi his
year at Grinnell.

Income from endowments and
giits make it possible for Grin-
nell to operate without charg-
ing enough tuition to cover the
operating costs, Last year the
income from endowments came
to $407,537 and gifts amounted to
$773,776.

Mr. Lambie indicated that
the college was hoping that am
(Academic Improvement Mas<
terplan) would be successful
this year in relieving the college
of last year’s deficit. The year
before last the college came out
with an $11,000 surplus.

Faculty Considers
Adding Students
To Committees

A proposal from the Executive
Council of the faculty oiiicially
to involve more students in
the educational policy of the
college departments is now be-
ing discussed, Under the plan,
two students major' in de-
partments of each division will
be placed on its Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) These
Students would review all revi<
sions and proposals within each
department oi their division.
With the students more iormally
involved, it is hoped that the
EPC will be presented with
ideas directly from the stu-
dents.

At the present time, accord-
ing to Professor Joseph Wall,
chairman of the faculty, it ap.
pears likely that this proposal
will pass. Tile biggest point or
contention now is the method of
choosing the two student repre<
sentatives for each committee.

The committee of Faculty 0r-
ganizations is considering the
addition of students to other
faculty committees as well.
Groups suggested include the

Block Times Won,
Increments Lost

Tile dispute between Quad
Saga workers and the colicge
has, after a two day strike, been
settled. Student workers re-
turned to the Quad on Monday
morning. Both sides compro-
mised in reaching the iinal a-
greement. Although wage in.
increments will be eliminated on
February 1, block times will
now be split among workers
who must hear an extra burden
when an employe is absent or
tardy.

The "block time" is an aver-
age time which a certain duty
should take when a worker is
assigned a duty be is paid at
an hourly rate ior that average
time. Previously, the official
policy of Saga was not to pay a
worker any extra money if he
had to cover, in addition to
his own job, the job of an absent
workeri However, according to
John Shaw. a mealhead at the
Quad and one oi the student
negotiators, block times were
Split “openly” at the Quadran-
gle. Under the settlement, block
times of absentees will be split,

-50% for first and 100% for:

additional absentees.

Also included in the settle«
ment was a provision to pay a
worker extra if a “schedule
feature beyond the control of
the workers extends the work
period more than two-tenths
hours beyond the normal block
time."

”The block time settlement
will cost the college no extra
money," stated Ralph Pomer-
enk, Assistant Business Manag<
er of the College, “because we

PERIODICAL BANK
FOR ACM PLANNED

A cooperative periodical
bank for the Associated Col-
leges of the Midwest is soon to
be established in the Newberry
Library, The bank will give
each college access to more
periodicals than any one li-
brary could possibly hold,

After two years planning, the
periodical bank \Vlll begin op-
erations in January. Students
will then be able to request
magazine articles irom the
bank, and in three days the col-
lege will receive microiorm
copies of it.

Tile bank will hold many
magazines unavailable in our

back copies of magazines al-

are willing to pay tor every
job that is done.” Fomerenk em-
phasized that the justiﬁcation
for not splitting block time was
to insure that a full Crew would
be at the meal.

In a separate letter to Saga
workers, new policies to control
absences were outlined.

The second major issue was a
seniority increment above the
base wage. The students asked
tor a ﬁve cent increment above
any base rate after the second
semester of work and again
lifter the liitll semester.

In a letter to Saga workers.
James Stauss, Provost oi the
College, said that the College’s
budget is already tight. Because
the College must. increase the
base wage rate to reach the
minimum wage or $1.65 in the
next three years, student labor
costs already pressure the pro-
jected budget. lithe pressure or
increments were added, the Col-
lege might have to consider a
cheaper alternative to so much
ltudent labor.

The present wage base is $1.15.
February 1, it will increase to
$1.30. At that time all existing
increments will be discontim
lled.

The students in the Quad are

the only large group of student
workers currently receiving any
increment. They had not yet
been informed that the incre«
merits would be discontinued
next semester. There was some
contusion regarding a decision
to establish the increment sys-
tem two years ago. Some
thought that the system esta-
blished then was still in effect.
on Sunday the administration
produced a copy of a letter sent
to Saga workers then. The sys—

tem was only established for
that school year.

"The administration is fairly
satisfied with the agreement,”
said Mrr Pomerenk, “but we
are sorry that the students
struck. That type or relationship
that one finds between labor
and management in industry is
not appropriate under a system
where jobs are granted as a
form of financial aid.”

“we were pleased that the
administration was willing to
compromise." stated Shaw.
"The compromise on block
times was good. We only regret
that it took four weeks of dis—
cussions and a strike to settle
instead of the filteen»rninute
meeting Friday at which the
administration showed no will-
ingness to compromise, even
when the student negotiators
demonstrated their willing-
Hess."

Draws Big Crowd

Dr. Helena Percas Ponsetl
(Spanish) lectured to a sizable
crowd or students and faculty
on “Cetvantes’ Creative Genius:
The Cave of Montesinos" in the
South Lounge of the Forum on
Wednesday night. The chapter,
from Part II or Don Quixote, is
generally considered to he one
or the most obscure and pro-

Mrs. Ponseti analyzed the
chapter in three ways: the lit-

psychological. Extensive allu<
sions to classical and other par.
allels made Ihe lecture an il-

Quixote’s character but also of

more communication and un.
derstanding.

"The New Land", the hrs!
lecture, dealt with the probleml
of students and of [he univelﬁ
sity, defined as “the whole insti<
tution of higher learning in all
its forms." Dr, Napier said that
the university, which should be
the leader in helping the indivi-
dual, the nation, and the world
“to ﬁnd himself” or itself, was
moving in “perilously slow mo-
tion” in overcoming [lie “dehu‘
manization" and “powerlessr
tiess" of students.

Speaking at student revolt.
Napier encouraged the protest,
calling student indignation at
America's immoraiity “hope
tul", At the same time, be en-
couraged restraint among young
people.

In his second lecture, “The
New People”, Drr Napier listed
the problems lacing America
and three things that he thought
we must do to begin to solve
them. Some problems named
were the tremendous differences
“between black and white, be.
tween the poor and the comforts
able, and between developing
and advanced nations”. The p05«
siblllty 0t selfrdestructmn by
nuclear weapons, the political
triction in the world, the popula<
tion explosion, air pollution,
chaotic cities, and attitudes of
“conformity and apathy, smug-
ness and hypocrisy" were also
named as problems lacing us.

Napier called for “a return
to sympathy”, more “lunctlon
of perception", and more “cor-
porate celebration or changes
in the lives of individuals and of
nations.”

Dr. Napier's final lecture, “A
New Language", explored “the
need of man in a fractured
world to find new ways of com-
municating and understanding".
He said that, in order to create
this “more humane world", the
people “are called to the now
absolutely critical leadership or
new creation, and we must be
about the business or creating a
whole new people and a whole
new language"

Nixon’s Victory

This week the country made its choice and
elected Richard Nixon president of the United
States. The country chose the worse of two evils
and will suffer for it.

The people chose to be insensible to the prob-
lems of the ghetto, the problems of unemployment,
and the other social problems of America. They
chose to prolong international tensions and the
armaments race,

Mr. Nixon has said that “We have been poure
ing billions into those Federal antipoverty programs
and we have reaped a harvest of riot, frustration
and failure.” On account of the Vietnam war, how.
ever, the first items in the budget to be out have
been the antipoverty programs. Besides, the Con-
gress has never appropriated the amount of money
the bills’ sponsors have stated was necessary for
the accomplishment of the programs. Nixon has in-
dicated that he intends to reduce the national bud-
get by scrapping most of the antipoverty programs.
His answer to the economic problems of Black peo-
ple is to provide tax incentives for “black capital-
ism," a solution hardly adequate to the magnitude
of the problem.

Nixon has suggested as a solution to the prob-
lem of inflation an increased unemployment What
kind of man would suggest a method for solving
one problem that involved the creation of another
which would mean vast misery to innumerable peo-

1e.7
p On the major issues of our time Mr. Nixon kept
silent throughout his campaign, Nixon spent only
four years in the House of Representatives and two
years in the Senate, For the last sixteen years he

as had no position of public responsibility. As vice
president to Eisenhower and as a private citizen
Nixon showed himself as neither an innovator of
legislation nor as a statesman. As a member of Con-
gress he spent most of his time warning America
about the evils of communism.

Our best hint of what the new Nixon admin-
istration will be like came when Nixon chose Spiro
Agnew, a man inexperienced in national poli-
tics, as his vice presidential running mate. Ag-
new is also a man of questionable morality consid-
ering his purchases of lands intended for public pro-
jects and his other conflicts of interest. We can also
wonder if the affection shown at the Republican
Convention between Strom Thurmond and Nixon
will continue when Nixon resides in the White
House.

In this cold war, now two decades old, there
have been few calming enterprises One of the maj-
or steps in relieving the enmity between the Soviet
Union and the United States was the sale of Ameri-
can wheat in 1963. Mr. Nixon called the sale “a
foreign policy blunder even more serious than the
fouling of the Bay of Figs.

Mr. Nixon, unlike the unsuccessful Democratic
nominee, has never indicated much interest in slow-
ing the arms race. During his campaign he claimed
that the United States was suffering a “security
gap” and losing its nuclear lead over Russia. He
has indicated that, if elected president, he will in-
crease the country’s nuclear arsenal, already large
enough to kill every Russian several times.

The United States faces hard times. But we en-
dured Eisenhower, and we even endured Johnson,
for the gods put an enduring heart in men. Perhaps
we shall survive Nixon.

Steve Kent Compares
Crosseh‘, Schneirov

I dislike the position of having
to correct another of Mr. Cross-
ett's chronic and jaded mis-
readings of history, but I would
like to set the record straight
on one matter.

Never in my time at Grinnell,
did I instigate, draft or circulate
any petitions whatsoever (ex-
cept on behalf of certain candl-
dates for office).

With regard to the numerous
petitions circulated by a variety
of well-wishers and participants
on the day of the lllriamed sleep-
in two years ago, I did not par-
ticipate in the drafting or cirr
culatlon of any of these peti-
[Ions which, I understand, gar-
nered over 800 signatures in the
space of apprDleately twelve
hours. Nor were these petitions
ever used by me, or even all
collected from their circulators,
precisely because some of them
were sloppily drawn and be-
cause the fast-pace of events
made it questionable in our
minds that all of the signers
were fully aware of the implica-
tions of signing.

Your relation of the facts sug~
gests that you may have those
petitions confused with one
widely circulated among my
class by some of my classmates
a few days before our gradua-
tion. This petition, which called
for a realistic review of the
opens policy, something i still
believe IS needed at Grinnell,
was published in the 5&3 in a
substantially altered form, to
the chagrin of a number of its
signers, including myself. who
were not given notice of the
changes. 1 had nothing to do
with the drafting or circulation
of thls petition in either its orl~
ginal or adulterated form and
was one of those who requested
that their names be removed
from the list of signers.

“Demagoguery”. “dishonest".
"mampulation" are 5 tr 0 n 3
words, particularly when associ-
ated with an incorrect relation
of the facts. Doesn't this kind of
public character assassination,
Mr. Crossett, done behind the
victim’s back and without the
decency of reasonable notice.
strike you as being just a bit
uhtalr and reprehensible — per-
haps, as you might have it, even
Schneirovian?

I have done some things that
I would be hard-pressed to de-
fend in retrospect, but gross
deception is not one of them.
And. really, Mr. Crossett, to
style me as a demagogue is not
a little like accusing Phyllis
Diller of being a sex-pot. It's
a flattering charge but one that
just can't be sustalned under
scrutiny.

My own preference always
has been for the politics of cans
ciliation and of compromise
and, l think, with the exception
of a radicalized moment or two,
I have been a fairly consistent
practitioner of that brand.

I like to think that had
some of us been better heeded
two years ago. some of the dlvls
lions that now plague the cam-
pus might have been avoided.
Yet 1 rather doubt that anything
I could have done (or not done)
in the short time available to and

would have greatly changed the
course of recent Grlnnell his-
tory. I may be a good case
study for the proposition that
"the evil men do live after
them while the good is oft ins
terred with their bones. . ." but
I hardly qualify as the commits
ter of the Original Sin.

I suspect that the. drug-cult,
the black power movement. the
politics of confrontation and
S. D. S., distasteful as they are
to me as well as to you. Mr.
Crossett. were. if f date use the
term, hlstorlcal lnevitahillties
tor Grinnell as they probably
were for the nation. I suspect
also that these phenomena will
largely modify or pass away
within a relatively Short time.
Their premises are too irration-
al and inadequate to long satis—
fy the discerning mind of the
Grinnell student.

I doubt the gross clamorings
of the S. D. S. are very repreA
senlatlve of the true proclivi-
ties of more than 8 handful
even Within the S. D. 5., al»
though I'm sure that you could
get a majority to claim that
they were it you picked the
right moment to ask.

Nor do I consider the evident
weakness of the present S.G.A.
to be representative of the true
potential of student government
at Grinnell. And I intend that
analysxs as no dlsparagemem or
our successors ln S.G.A. It is
only natural that student gov-
ernment should be in a de
pressed state. Virtually the en-
tire political and social fabric of
the student society has been
rent and lain to waste by the
abrupt and drastic “reforms"
of the past year and a half,
leaving only a void to operate
in where custom, precedent and
tradition once served as guides.
When I recall the care given in
attempting to put a compar-
atively modest reform, the also
lltlon of women’s hours, on a
posltlve footing, l shudder at the
innocence with which Gl'innell-
ians have played with institua
{ions in recent months,

p e r h a p s all administrators
as well as students have been
guilty at one time or another of
taklng too many cues from the
Revulutlon and not enough from
Burke. Still, I remam in the be-
lief that the great majority of
Grinnell’s Students are intelli-
gent enough and wise enough to
know, or to soon rediscover,
that the key to power and influ-
ence lies not in passion but in
reason. not with the politics of
confrontation but with the pull-
u'cs of compromise.

I still have confidence in the
ability of Grinnell students,
given a strong and healthy insti~
tutional undergirding, to largely
govern themselves responsibly
and tolerably well and to parti-
cipate constructively in the plan-
ning and operation of the Col-
lege.

No, Mr. Crossett, we wlll al~
ways be at odds. For it seems to
me that in your own way you
are as blind to the possibilities
of good In the students as Mr.
Schncimv is to posslbililies for
good in the administratlon.
Neither perspectlve, in my oplm
ion, is a particularly healthy or
productlve one to maintaln.

You and Mr. Schneirov,
thounh udniluodly bole: man.

are In fact two or a klno, Mr,
Crossett: dogmatic and blind
in your opinions, incapable of
reasonable compromise, so sure
of your hold on The Truth. The
College community would do
well to avoid taking either of
you too seriously.

Brotherhood Review
Called Ludicrous

To the Hilton

Mr. Stump's and the souls
Criticism of the Brotherhood,
lure the reason given for print-
ing the Wallace ad, reflects a
high degree of American intel-
lectual excretion, Do not pester
me wlth Amerlcan rhetoric,
ethics or morals for they have
been tried and proved wanting.
The son need not speak to the
Brotherhood as to what a paper
should or should not print.

What kind of game do you
think the white races have been
playing with the colored people
of this world — Hopscotchl
Your article clearly demon-
strates that you know nothing
of American political realism.
.You have unwisely rushed into
a Black area of human eXpea
rience of which you know
little. If you being white can.
not even understand the human
motivations of your own race.
then how in hell are you going
to be able to say anything in-
telligent about the human moti.
vatiuns of Blacks? In short,
when it comes to defining real-
ism for Blacks, the 5&3 staff
should keep its juvenile mouth
shut, for lts naivete has already
led to moronic utterances of
the most ludicrous nature. I!
realism makes you nauseous,
then crawl to the nearest hole
in the ground and discharge
yourself there but do not be-
come emetic at my feet.

The fetus deep within the
womb of Mother America Cries
out in wretched anguish, for
even before birth it has come
to realize that the American
by stem engenders incurable
sick blood cells which will
eventually destroy even tho
healthiest of brain Cells. Ac-
cept your mother’s blood and
go insane.

Rothsfein Rut
Rakes Review

To the Editor:

I hope I will he pardoned for
being in a rut, but it seems that
being in a rut ls very fashion-
able among certain members
of the 58:3 staff with whom I
wish to take issue.

In particular, I have in mind
that distinguished columnist,
ooh Stump. His latest calumny,
“Where the Truth Lies . . .,"
in a perfect example of what I
mean. To begin with, Mr.
Stump shows his unfailing ahll-
ity to misinterpret that which
he does not wish to agree with.
He states, with reference to
The Brotherhood, that “Most
of the paper was addressed to
fellow Black students with the
purpose of gaining unity and
political power." This ll true“

but it one takes the trouble to
read rather than merely look
at the articles, one should real-
ize that the underlying raison
d‘etre of that publication is to
make Whites think about the
condition of the Blacks in our
society, and to come to some
understanding of their living
contradiction.

"i fear that the failure to use
reason . l . will either doom or
damn them in the future."
Again we have the “right-think
tug man” syndrome. First at
all, reason implies, or rather,
the use or reason implies, that
one’s opponent is vulnerable to
it. The past hundred years oi
American history, not to men<
tion the entire period oi
slavery, has not given any in-
dication of an American public
susceptible to reasoning. The
{act that there still exists a
"race question," whether or
not it is marked by platitudes
or by riots, is the very proof
of such a dismal lack of recep-
tiveness on the part of the
White community As long as
Blacks are forced to Sit at the
back of the bus, physically,
mentally or emotionally, I do
not think that the Whites in the
trout seats have any right to
expect anything short of violent
words and actions.

Mr. Stump mentions the pD<
larization of issues and the re-
jection of the wisdom oi inte-
gration, “the goal of the entire
Civil Rights Movement.” I
ask, who has polarized the is-
sues —— the Black worker try<
ing to get a job ior which there
ts some respect, the Black stu-
dent who is denied any identity
with the society in which he
lives since he is not told at the
contributions his ethnic group
has made to it, or is it the
Wop who votes against open
housing, the Kike who insists
that he knows how and what
to teach these “deprived chil<
dren“?

I suppose that when Mr.
Stump uses an absolute such as
"entire," he really means it
And is not merely succumbing
to irrational emotional.
ism. However, his statement
about the civil right: mow

ment betrays an almost total
disregard for current events.
Few issues have been made so
plain recently as the divided
nature of that cause, And what
is the "wisdom oi integration”?
Presumably that by integration
the Black individual becomes
familiar with and accepts the
values of the society into which
he is integrated. These great
values that we have, are they
the ones that presently allow
George Wallace to attract such
a large following? Or perhaps
they are those that allow
people to ignore the murder of
a woman in the street just out-
side their windows? 0r those
that produce a sheriff who
blows a kid’s head off {or steal-
ing a car? or perhaps merely
those that create a Donald
Stump who is so willing to ig-
nore the urgency and intensity
of the plight of fellow human
beings simply because they do
not use “reason.”

Finally (at last!), there is
Mr. Stumps lack of compre-
hension oi the use Di the term
“colonial” to refer to the Black
America within White Amer-
ica. Granted, the ghettoes are
not in some far off land across
the sea; but that is hardly any
excuse ior their not being
colonies. who governs them?
Until recently, the vast major-
ity oi p 'tical and administra-
tive oificials at any advanced
level were Whites. Who em-
ployes them? Whites. Who pays
them? Whitest Are they ens
ploited? It exploited is to be
taken to mean that they are
not paid as much for the same
quality work as are Whites.
yes. ii exploited is to mean
that they are denied access to
the belterrpaying, more pres-
tigious jobs, yes. It it means
that they are not given serv-
ices ior which they pay an
as much as do Whites, yes it
it means that what money they
do earn is not allowed to ac<
cumulaie, but is removed from
their community by people who
do not live in the community,
yes. Do any more comparisons
have to be made?

I hope that Mr. Stump will
not be so attended by this let-
ter that he will not reread

emotions and their roots rather
than to make debaters points
about the logic. if The Brother
hood is to be criticized at all,
it is because it does not start
at the beginning. Knowing the
ioundations for their argu-
ments, the writers have not
thought it necessary to de-
velop them. Uniortunately, Mr.
Stump‘s views are probably
held by a number of other
people on campus and it might
be prudent for future contribu-
tors to that publication to de-
scribe in greater detail even
those views that they deem
most basic, in order that people
habitually callous to them
might begin to understand. I
think that it the first issue
was an attempt to attract at-
tention to the issue, an atten-
tion that has been woefully
lacking at Grinnell, they have
succeeded and can now proceed
to take advantage of this turn
of events.

Bressier Concert, America Hurrah
By FREDA TEPFER

We must pay for the excesses of the past by making sacrifices.
in other words. friends, this is going to he a Slow week. It’s all
right though, because there’s always a smiling face at the Strand

ready to take your money.

On Friday, November 8, the Concert Series presents Charles
Bressler, tenor, at 3:00 in Roberts Theatre. Mr. Bressler will pre.
sent a varied program —- everything irom Purcell to Debussy.
At 9:15 in ARI-l “Fury” will be Shown. Since neither of the ﬁlm
people were available for comment, I’ll just have to assume it’s
the same horse story i used to watch on Saturday mornings in my
childhood — after “Heckel and Jeckel” and beiore “Sky King." I
will gladly be proven wrong From 10:00 until midnight it will be
Freebie time in the North Lounge — the juke box will go on a
2-hour diet of tender loving care — no money. it you’ve got
nothing else to do at 11:15 you can listen to Part 1 of “John
Brown’s Body" in the cniiee house and music room.

Saturday at 1:30 the Grinnell Follies presents the ﬁghting
Pioneers in battle against the men of (Zoo. At 7:00 and 10:00 in
Roberts Theatre the Broadway play “America Hurrah” will be
presented under the auspices oi the Student Concert Committee
and the Music and Drama Department. Once again at 7:30 "Fury"
will be shown in ARI-l (no comment). At 9:30 the rocks will dancﬁ

in the North Lounge,

on Sunday at 2:30 in the Burling Viewing Room all you
Bergman buffs can attend the film Seminar. The rest of us can
go to ARH at 8:30 to see “The Silence" in blissful ignorance,

A Slow week begins on Monday. it you really crave communal
eXCltement, you can observe the ticket distribution for “The Typ-
lsts” and “The Tiger" at the Forum desk. This drama pertormed
by the Charles Kimbroughs, actors-in-residence, will be presented
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8:00 in Roberts Theatre. On
Wednesday at 10:30, the mid-week blues will be played at the Jam
Session in the Forum. Thursday at 8:00 the Grinneli Draft Infor.
mation Center will present a film and discussion in the South

were especially struck, no, struck
dumb by the statement that
"because the staii is unfamiliar
with the material, the opportu-
nity for initiative on the part of
the students is greater." The
luster of our old Historical
Studles course iaded as we read
mis exciting statement and
realized its implicit concept of
education. All the training oi

our teachers was like shackles
upon our feet; it limited our
initiative and prevented mean-
ingtul, mutual learning expe-
riences with the faculty. Just
think of the freedom we would
have had if our professors had
been completely ignorant: no
a nn o yin g preconceptions, no
categories closing in on our
minds, no cosmology to blind
our innate vision of the heavens.

In order to make the Social
Studies students as free as pos-
sible and eliminate the “ten-
dency to steer (students) in a
specific direction," we suggest
that proiessors with the great—
est possible ignorance of the
course be sought out imme-
diately. Biology proiessors,
Greek pruiessors, and English
pmiessors would liberate us
captives of knowledge even
more than the present stait.

Even better, let us accept the
demands {or student power on
this campus in the most impor-
tant tield of play, the class-
room. Since students are the
most ignorant members oi the
community, let them teach the
course.

Editorials: Worst

To the Editor:

The Scarlet and Black this SE‘

er were it not for the constancy
of its dull, reactionary, and po-
tentiaily subversive editorials.

What are you trying to do?
Sabotage the student movement?
it would appear to the normal
reader that your interest in the
past does not confine itself to
ridiculous printing of irrelevant
stories. No indeed; it is much
Worse. You would have Grinnell
operate under the rules 0i 1911.

Your last week's editorial was
iar the worst thought~out piece
to appear in what would other-
wise huve been a fair issue.
Richard Schneirov was brave
to light a rule in the only» way
in which it can be fought. The
administration and you may talk
till hell ireezes over about pro~
cedure, but where has proce-
dure gotten any of us? Schneirov
should not be expelled, he should
have been honored,

You accused Richard Schnei-
rov of acting with “haughti-
ness," a charge you neither de-
iine nor substantiate. But is it
not a worse example of haughti-
ness to presume to know the
truth, and to pretend an ins
nocence making you eligible to
cast the that stone?

You would do this community
and your readers a service by
allowing the entire editorial

inconceivable that there could
be more than one such sick
mind at Grinnell College.

“1 just don’t think Nixon has

Jon Royal, '70, was pessimistic

A proNixon Political Science

The students marched ten

anti-government slogans, such
as ”Vote no for president" and

Hockeyettes Beat lowa Wesleyan
2-] in a Bruising Moral Victory

By CINDY ROOT

The Grimell minutemen
helped the cause or icmininity
in sports as they met the lowa
Wesleyan bnlisers on home
ground Inst Friday. The striped
sweatsuited team must have
averaged 150 pounds. but they
looked and acted as it they
averaged 200 pounds.

They were all business,
though, and spurred on by the
deep rumbling yells irom their
coach on the sidelines, “Stop
her, stop her, you ldiots!” as it
it were a matter of life and
death (which it began to look
like), they provided us with the
best duel of the season.

The Grinnell delense, Kathy
Ellis, Heather Poole. Becky
DeWeiSe, Cindy Maier, Narda
Cisco, and Suzanne Griset, wth
its usual precision, kept the op
position out or the striking
Circle and fed the forwards so
that Mimi Buntz and Cindy
Root could muscle their way
down the iield ior 2 quick goals.
Debbi Eppstein, Marcy Woody,
and Jamie Rosenblatt rounded

out the forward line and put in
a good light.

At the half. the hruisers were
desperate and resorted to such
tactics as tripping, hooking,
pushing, triple guarding, and
such displays at all-around de-
ceitlulness (better known as
try » to . get . away - with - any -
thing . without - attracting - the .
umpire) which dlrtied up the
game and kept the minute—
men scoreless. But does crime
really pay? You bet your beanie
it doesn't, and even though in
the last ten seconds the bxuisers
satisﬁed their madly raving
sideline pacing coach a nd
knocked one in, to the surprise
of dauntless Connie, the Grin—
nell girls won 2»1l It was worth
the resounding thud bestowed
on our backs (although it was
all we could do to keep stand»
log) by the sporting bruiser
losers.

. . , Funny, sports seem to
be one of the few things re
maining to tire up Ior con-
structively.

Freshman Football Team ltolls
To Second Undefeated Season

By KRISTI SCHMITI‘

For the second year in his-
tory the Griiinell ireshmen were
undefeated in their regular sea-
son of competition. They rolled
over Wartburg, Knox, and Coo
and, in doing so, massed 112

omts against the 3 opponents.
ine young Pioneers, only suit-
Ing 18 players at the beginning
of the season and winding up
with 16 staunch hearted men to
compete in their last game
against Coe, were considered
one of the best prospective var-
sity teams in recent Grinnell
history

The last game, true to the
new tradition, was star-studded
in the overwhelming victory.
The young Pioneers put togeth~
or 349 yards in the air and 117
yards on the ground on their
way to a 50 to 19 wallop over
rival Coe.

The game was filled with of-
fensive heroics on the part of
the Grinnell freshmen. The first
of many touchdowns came on a

ass from quarterback Bill
gicks to tight end Scott Hanson,
followed up with the extra
point by Jim Pimlli. For the
second score, Dicks connected
with wingback Ed Hersh tor
another Grinnell touchdown, lol-
fowed again by a 1»point con-
version via the toe of Jim Pirol-
ii. Not to he denied a fourth
down on the three yard line,
Mario Eognanno plunged in for
still another score; this time

followed by a two point conver—
sion from Dicks to tight and
Scott Hansonr The team ended
the iirst hall with a 22 to 0
score in their lawn

The second half was no less
exciting, 30 minutes from vic<
tory and glory, the freshmen
again took the field. The un<
stoppable offense was too much
for Coe’s defense, Accounting
for 7 of the to points in the sec.
and half was Mario Bognanno
on a slant 0ft tackle for and
yard and followed by conver-
sion Another 7 points were con-
tributed by Randy Sarver, on a
bruising plunge from the three
yard line. The next player to
hit pay dirt was Jim Pirolli, tak-
log a pitch from Bill Dicks in
the end mm, followed by I
tricky two point conversion to
(snag (The Phantom) Bombin-
aki. This sure-handed Chica-
goan pulled in the low delivered
pass with professional finesse.
The last score In the closing
moments of the game was hand-
led with tho scoring combina-
tion 0! Dicks and Pirollir Pimlli
again added the 50th point.

The glory was not all In the
backfield. The offensive line,
with contributions from Bill
Wright, Rod Gleysteen. Dave
Cassei, Doug Watts, and Jared
Van Wagenen, played an impor.
tant part in the victory effort.
In all, thesﬂ future Grinnell
varsity team members have
proven themselves able and wills
ing to produce etiicienily.

Hard Knox Beats
Soccer Club 3-2

The Grinnell soccer team
ended its 1968 season on a sour
note as it tell to Knox, H. in a
closely fought contest. The loss,
the Pioneers’ second to the st-
wash this season, leave: Gritt-
mil with a 1&3 record.

The Pioneerl played a close
ama, holding the Siwash to I
-2 tin throughout the W minutI
of regulation playing time. out
a foul by goalie Dave Coran In
the fleeting seconds of the game
gave Knox a penalty shot with
no time romaining on the clock.
The shot was good and the Si-
wash won 3—2.

In spite of the final defeat,
the Pioneers’ season might be
termed successful. Each of
Grinnell’i losses was a single
point defeat and two of them
came in the final seconds of the
game. The Pioneers outscored
their opposition 15 to 13.

Scoring honors go to Steve
Korstad, a freshman who plays
right wing for the Pioneers, with
7 points. Bruce Graham com.
piled 6 goals to lead the team
in that department, while Kor-
stad and Dave North shared
the assist lead with 4 each.

Final scoring went as follows!

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Until the time ran out, no
one was sure that the score
would remain with Grinnell
ahead ma over Lawrence.
Neither team scored in the first
half and Lawrence was able to
keep the Pioneers in trouble
during the whole ﬁrst quarter.
The turning point was the field
goal attempt missed by Law-
renca very late in the first
quarter. Our defense kept the

the whole second quarter. Our

rec play: before the and of
the quarter Grinnall gave up,
the bail after a field goal ate
tempt by Roy Lewis went wldu
N the goal posts.

Early in the second hall Roy
Lewis kicked a field goal from
the 15. The field goal was not
up when Bruce Rollins recov-
ered a punt fumbled by Law-
rencel 0n kick off Lewin pr0<
ceeded to put the ball far past
the end zone. Four plays later
Lawrence again fumbled and
Dick Pope recovered.

Three downs later, with three
yards to go, the Pioneers scored
on a pass from Johnson to Win-
terson. Lawrence took over the
ball on the strength of two long
passes or 20 yards and 47 yards
and was able to share the Pio-
neers’ lead to 2 points (loo).
After the kickoff, the situation
became extremely tense when
Gary Johnson’s pass was
intercepted and returned to
the Grinnell 22. An unbe-
lievable defense effort, how
ever, threw Lawrence back on
each of its next three plays for
a loss of 21 yards. The Vikings
