4 Reporter- ceases publicaton: protest
ileggett censorship of '66 yearbook ,

An Editorial

 

 

With this issue of The Reporter we cease
publication. This issue does not include our nor-
mal news coverage and the staff will not put out
a commencement issue as previously planned. We
find it intolerable to continue our service to an
academic community which makes a sham of stu-
dent publications’ autonomy. If one publication
can be blanketly censored — in this case the 1966
yearbook ~ then all are in grave danger.

The cancellation of the yearbook is the latest
and most serious miscarriage of proper publica-
tions procedure. All regard for rule and reason
was ignored when:

l.) A collegesponsored book was recalled
by the college for review without the knowb
edge of the student editor.

2.) The book was cancelled due to what
the college counsel and President Glenn Leg-
gett have termed libelous material though
none of it has of yet been substantiated

3,) Cancellation of the book came before
discussion with the editor and a publications
lawyer,

4.) The college’s Student Publications
Committee — of which the duties are (accord-
ing to facility committee bylaws) “to function
as Publisher” of the college yearbook, among
other publications, and ”to exercise general
supervision of all student publications" —-
was blatantly superseded in power by admin-
istrative dictum.

5.) When the cancellation of the book was
appealed the issue was placed back in the
hands of the Committee in the form of a pro-
posal which called for Committee review and
editing of the book “for tone and balance” in
the absence of the editor. The Committee
promptly passed the proposal—voting against
their own bylaws. which outlaw prior cen-
sorship of any publication. Though a commit-
tee member later moved that the proposal
was invalid due to its illegality, other com-
mittee members refused to annul the pro
posal.

G.) A student non-voting but regular
”staff" member of the Committee (this editor)
was barred from “private” proceedings of
the Committee, which lealt with the year-
book issue, while a faculty nonvoting “ex-
officio” member. Chairman of the Faculty
Joseph Wall, participated. Publications Com-
mittee Chairman Benjamin Graham refused
a request for a vote on admission of the editor
to the meeting. In the past. Publications Com-
mittee meetings have traditionally included
all members.

But the hypocrisy and ineptness of this com-
mittee during the present crisis represents no de-
parture from its usual methods. And the sobering
fact is, similar problems are bound to recur given
the present Publications Committee structure
which allows a faculty-administration majority.
Under the present system:

1.) One administration member (to advise
on business matters) and four faculty menr
bcrs, specializing in subjects ranging from
English to science, dominate four student

members, only two of whom are involved in
actual publications; the other two are selected
by SGA. The only professor of journalism at
Grinnell refuses to sit on this committee. Last~
semester when the Committee Chairman
Henry - York Steiner assumed administrative
duties — a role causing conflicting interests
—the Committee (again ignoring lts bylaws)
allowed him to continue in his position until
repeated objections by a student member un-
seated him.

2.) Decisions of this committee originate
in a vacuum of knowledge about publications
(due to the members background and lack of
interest) and about student culture [due to the
faculty majority). The present Committee
chairman, Benjamin Graham, is a professor of
biology. Further, faculty opinions, by their
very nature, are always subject to administra.
tive pressure. The result? The recent rejec-
tion of a superior candidate for the position of
Reporter editor by Committee members unin-
volved in student publications — a decision
which rejected the advice of the Committee
minority who are actually involved in and
knowledgeable about publications.

3. The faculty chairman of the Commit-
tee assumes disproportionate power over pub-
lications affairs. In the recent dispute over
the 1966 yearbook, Chairman Graham sup-
posedly represented the Committee yet at
least the student members were left totally
in the dark as to the brewing storm.

4,) Though matters of libel are a subject
all learning writers should study and though
vague warnings about printing libelous ma-
terial have been batted about time and again
in discussion of Grinnell publications, the
Committee has made no effort to educate its
members and the students its sponsors as to
the boundaries of responsible journalism in
the real world.

Considering these problems and considering
the time'consuming nature of serious creative
work for which Grinnell refuses to award aca«
demic credit, the student at Grinnell actively dedi-
cated to the communications arts and to student
freedoms faces bleak prospects.

In light of these recurrent problems, a plan
for reorganization of Grinnell's system of publi<
cations should appear fairly apparent, Voting
membership on a publications committee should
be chiefly comprised of student representatives
from each publication and from the radio station,
possibly an additional member being elected by
the senate. A non-voting administrative advisor
should be available for consultation on business
matters, One or two faculty members could sit in
on a regular advisory basis. This committee
should restrict itself to technical, legal and fi-
nancial matters relating to publications. The col-
lege should also hire a practicing journalist (pos-
sibly from Des Moines) as a partrtime consultant.
This consultant could, for instance, advise in mat-
ters of libel. Finally, students must be encouraged
in the invaluable learning experience of publica-

Two more out on morals —

Once again the deans (Richard Winters, Alice Low and 5. Eugene
Thompson) and members or the Faculty Committee on Student Aliairs
~(tlZ'cnis de Coteau, George Zimmar, Benny Neizger, Bruce Thomas and
Joseph Wall) have thought it their place to pass personal (and prtidisli)
moral judgments on others But as modern society gives up the “in loco
parentis” concept, we will eventually reﬂect “That’s just the way people
were then . . . they couldn’t help it." (See story on page 4)

Still another ”image-maker” on cot mpus

The greatest danger of a facility and administration which has
the “good image” mania is that students themselves may begin to
(oar healthy controversy. The recent letter sent to all outside sub—
soribers or The Reporter and given to all students by SGA President
Ric MacDowell was another attempt to cover up and smooth over
something that should be of much concern to everyone at Grinneli —-
namely the men’s campus problem.

01 course we grant MacDowell the right to say what he wants
to say, but ive don’t think his “personal letter” was the best way
to go about it. A letter to the editor printed in The Reporter would
have been better; things would have been kept in context. And Mac»
Dowell's letter would not have been printed in this week’s Herald
negister, ivhose readership knows little about Grinnell and nothing
about The Reporter or "Spring Riot.” Then too, if MacDowell had
written a letter to the editor he wouldn’t have telt it necessary to
use The Reporter‘s subscription file without permission of The
Reporter. We suggest that MacDoweil try to avoid the common
Grinnell administration plight of worrying about public-relations
more than some at the real and pressing problems facing Grinneii.

There is a serious problem with the lite on North Campus and
“Spring Riot” was it Significant symptom of that problem. The
Reporter coverage of the "Riot” did, in our opinion give a tairly
accurate impression of “Riot” activities. It was not any more sen-
sational than the "Riot” itself; we didn’t show the Vomit-smeared
iloors, unsuspecting girls being bombarded with water balloons and
beer; drunken, violent students being subdued by walkie—talkie carry-

ing ColHP oificials and doors lying shattered on hall floors.

We hope that the newly elected MacDowell is not so' naive as to
be ignorant of what went on with a very large number of stu-
dents “Riot” night. We hope MacDowell has some concern for the
everyday serious problem of North Campus life.

Comment on the censorship
Ed. Note:

John \Volf wrote the prologue and
much oi the text to Grinneu College
1966. Shortly before the book was
delivered to the printers Wolf helped
Wilhelm make ﬁnal revisions and
prootread the entire manuscript.
Woii is currently a graduate student
at the University of Wisconsin with
an assistantship in science writing.

May 14, 1967
To the editor:

Having worked with Henry Wilhelm
during the iinai stages of production of
the 1966 yearbook, I can say that Grim
nell College -— 1966 is a creation that
should be read, not shunned. in its
present state — resting unpublished in a
saiedeposit box — the book represents
thousands of manrhours of work. The
editors did not spend this time thinking
up ways to libel the college or members
of the college community. They did
spend the time making numberless pho-
tographs e excellent photographs - oi
Grinneli students and their environment.
They did spend the time assemblin ,
judging. accepting and rejecting p -
titres. They did spend the time connect-
ing the final 500 pictures with a text
that provides both an explanation oi the
photos and an exploration of some as
pects of “Grinnelll — The Small Liberal

Arts College” that don’t lend themselves
to photography.

Grinnell couege — 1986 is not a super-
iicial public relations too], although
many sections at the book tell happy,
proud stories of Grinnell Students. There
are “libelous” sections, too; but to quote
5. Eugene Thompson dean of men and
former Scarlet 81 Black columnist, “I'm
cnnvrnced that this campus needs more
satire, more intelligent hell-raising,
more cussing and libel, and more dissat-
isfaction in student affairs” (58:13, Jan.
1958). Mr. Thompson will want to read
Grinnell College — 1966!

Student affairs, however, is not the
only target of intelligent hellrraislng,
cussing, libel, and dissatlsiacilon. The
editors have rightfully questioned tenets
of the college’s educational philosophy—-
ond have even agreed with several oi
them.

The book needs no further defense. It
is not legally libelous because it is not a
misrepresentation. Pictures purporting to
be or a pot party are of a pot party just
as surely as pictures purporting to be
of animal ecology students are or animal
ecology students.

President Leggett has made a mistake
in denying the college community a
chance to view and read this legitimate
essay that should provoke every Grin—
nellian. The Grinnell community should
make every eifort to facilitate the print-
ing of Grinnell College — 1966 and to
reject categorically any suggestion of
administration censorship.

Leggett is currently "considering"

Ed. Note:

At a Board or Publications meeting

Will there ever be a 1966 Cyclone?
This question is not a new one on
campus. People have been asking it
ever since the original publication date
passed last September.

Until last week, the answer had always
been yes. it had become an even more
deﬁnite yes when the completed manu-
script was delivered to the printer on
April 2, leer.

But, then, in a Smashing blow dealt
almost simultaneously to the editors, the
Committee on Student Publications, and
the Senate, President Glenn Leggett an-
nounced last Wednesday, May 10, that
publication was to be halted.

He cited legal advice that there was
“considerable libelous material in the
proofs" as the basis for his decision.

At this moment, the official position
remains as it was last Wednesday: Cy-
clone ’66 (or as its editors preier to
call it, Grinnell College — 1966 will
not appear.

Steps are still being taken, however,
in efforts to publish the book either in
its present form or with substantial
changes,

A resolution passed by the tacultystu—
dent Committee on Student. Publica-
tions, Sunday, would have made possible
the publication of the book after reView
by the voting membership at that com-
mittee wtthout the editors' participation.

The committee with the advice of the
college’s legal counsel would correct the
manuscript for potentially libelous ma-
terial. They would then review the book
for “content.”

This idea has been rejected by the
book’s editors, iohn Phillips and Henry
Wilhelm, who now have the manuscript
locked in a safe depOSlt box. Wilhelm
said of the committee’s resolution, “We
rejected that categorically.”

Wilhelm claims he was told that the
committee in its review would concern
itself with matters of “(one and bal-
ance.” He feels this would constitute a
term of censorship.

Both Wilhelm and Phillips have been
dismissed from the college for academic
reasons. Wilhelm lives in Grinnell and
Phillips, now a student at Friends World
institute, is staying with Wilhelm on a
previously planned visit.

A lawyer, Michael Homatt (a mem-
ber of the Grinnell class of 1963) of
Washington, D.C., is now acting on be-
half of the editors.

Wilhelm said, “l-lorwait is in the pro-
cess of attempting to reopen negotiations
with the administration.” Wilhelm would
not elaborate further, saying, “For,
Phillips or me to say anything about it
might hurt the negotiations.”

He added, “We naturally have very
strong feelings on the subject.” He also
said he felt there was “reason for opti-
mism."

in an intervtew yesterday, Leggett said
he had talked to Horwalt by phone on
Monday. Horwatt Said he would send
Leggett a written proposal as soon as
possible. Leggett described the call as
a “very amiable one.”

Horwatt's proposal would reportedly
call for a review of the book by the
college's legal counsel who would note
all material which he considered libel-
ous. Horwatt would then check the re-
port of the college’s lawyer. The two of
them would reach an agreement on
changes to be made. Then the manu-
script would be returned to Leggett who
would have a month to decide whether
to approve its publication.

Leggett is now awaiting Horwatt’s pro-
posal before undertaking further action.
He stressed the fact, however, that the
problem is really in the hands of the
student publications committee.

Leggeti’s letter of May 10, 1967, to the
Committee on Student Publications de«
tails the chain of events leading to his
decision to halt the book’s publication.

An Official of the American Yearbook
Company, the book’s printer, iniormed
Leggett by phone on April ll, 1967, that
he had examined the book and found
parts of it “objectionable." The oliicial
requested a statement train the college
releasing the company from any resporr
sibility.

Leggett told the official that it is “not
the present practice of college oiticials
to review manuscripts oi student publi-
cations before they were submitted to
the printer." He requested that ihs
oitlcial communicate his concerns di-
rectly to the chairman of the student
publications committee, B e n j a m in
Graham (biology)

The official wrote to Graham on April
12, 1867, His letter said, “, . . much of
the editorial content of the copy repre-
sents a major departure irom what ll
normally found in a college yearbook.

“In tact, it is our opinion that much
of the editorial content could possibly
result in libelous situations involving in-
dividual students at Grinnell College 01'
the Publications Committee at Grinnell
College.”

Graham asked the ofﬁcial to return
the manuscript to him so that he could
bring it to the “attention of the com-
mittee and others in a position to judge
whether or not its publication would be
in the best interests oi the college.”

DANANG, VIETNAM (May 7)«
In the hills north of here nearly a
thousand Marines were killed and
wounded this past week. I was
there and saw a lot of it happen
and I was lucky. At this moment
some are in aluminum caskets fly-
ing in a jet plane back to heart-
broken families. Others are
stretched out in white hospital
beds, 19 year old kids who won’t
run again because they don’t have
much left leg anymore, who won't
find the girls so friendly because
a lot of soft-hard face was torn
away.

I'm lucky because at this mo-
ment it’s 9 o'clock in the morning,
I made it back, the press bar is
nirrconditioned, and I’ve already
had two drinks.

This battle, the fight for hill 861
and 381, was especially disgusting
because more even than the whole
war, it just didn’t have to happen.
As one of only three newsmen to
actually make the assaults first
hand, I can say that this fight had

everything that is wrong with the
military.

No Marine has been able to give
a good reason why those two hills
had to be taken. Marines kept as-
saulting dug-in positions and being
shredded and wasted. Young en-
listed men and young platoon
leaders shook their heads, checked
their weapons, and did what the
old officers and sergeants said to
do. The aging colonels kept urging
them on. Korea and World War II.
Iwo Jima. Tradition. Marines don’t
leave hills untaken. They also
don‘t leave dead and wounded be-
hind which doesn‘t account for the
two and three-day old bodies we
found on the slopes.

But never mind. take that island,
take that hill. That's how it was
in the “old corps." And so some
unbending men in positions of
power drove kids into hell after
hell.

And that’s the way it has always
been. And since those old men die
and seem to he followed by still
even more old men it’s prohably
the way it always will be.

And the men who are young
today will forget their buddies in
the shiny aluminum envelopes, the
wooden legs. The moment they
forget they too will be old men and
in their turn send the young kids
against useless hills of death.

And that’s why I’m telling the
young Vietnamese girl this mom
ing to mix me another. She sum
thinks Americans drink a lot and
giggles at the order. Screw her.

Faculty Committee suspends men's hail
president and sr. girl on morals charges

By Richard Schneirov

Langan House President, Richard
Weeks, a junior, and Gretchen Brewer,
a senior, were suspended from voltage
this week for illegal visitation: (lV’s).

The decision by the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs (FCSA)
means that Weeks will have to take
his final exams off campus, be stripped
at his office of House President, and
spend the iollowing semester on conduct
probation. Gretchen Brewer will not be
allowed to take part in graduation exer-
cises.

According to Weeks, the decision pos-
sibly represents a trend toward a mum
discriminating policy concerning such
violations. "I think this indicates that the
committee in showing a little more item-
hliity. This is the most lenient punish-
ment that has ever been given."

in the past, visitation violations have
been dealt with by suspensions ior an
entire semester.

(When contacted, Chairman of the
FCSA Denis deCoteau refused to com-
ment on the committee’s decision. The
administration was also unavailable tor
comment at press time.)

Weeks said he thought the FCSA‘s rea-
Ion for giving the light penalty was
“extenuating circumstances." He exA
plained that in spite of the fact that the
visitation had been overnight, Miss Brew-
er had only been studying in his room.

in on appearance before the FCSA

__...___.——————

Weeks explained his policy of eniorce-
ment of the college regulation concern‘
ing visitation. He said that he would not,
as an enforcement oiiicial report any-
one have IV’s unless that practice was
"very blatant, repeated, and infringed
on the rights of other hall members.

“Illegal visitations are an individud
matter. People should make their own
choice as long as they don’t hurt any-
body.

“1 told the chn that it (my policy on
enforcement) was better this way until
they start establishing a little more flexi-
bility in their penalties."

Former Coil-1p President, Senior Bob
Fame, a friend of Weeks, commented an
enforcement on North Campus. “Look at
how many cases have been reported by
student oiiicials in the last two years.
It speaks ior itself. There are methods
{or dealing with illegal visitations within
the halls Enforcement has become all-
most meaningless."

“SGA officials are like anyone else.
when they‘re elected they’re not going
to stop having lV's. He added as an af-
ter thought, "Though they may be more
discreet."

Foota went on to say, "A lot of people
are getting to be much more tree in
speaking about IV's. This is a thing that
has changed in my four years. The
student body is now accepting ii. m1-
tnraliy." (See page eight statement by

Publications Chairman Graham: “You don’t need to understand why"
as Reporter editor is thrown out of special committee meeting

neporter Editor Krys Neuman was
asked to leave last Sunday’s special
meeting of the Board of Publications by
C h a i r m a n of the Committee,
Dr. Benjamin Graham (biology) because,
according to Graham, the meeting was
open to voting committee members only.
When Miss Neuman asked why the meet.
lng was open to voting members only,
Graham replied “You don't need to un-
derstand,” Miss Neuman then requested
a vote of committee members as to
whether or not she should be permitted
to attend; Dr. Graham refused to call
for the vote. Dr. Joseph Wall (history),
Chairman of the Faculty and a non-vot-

ing exeofficio member or all committees,
was permitted to attend,

The special meeting was called to con-
sider a proposal initiated by Wall and
President Leggett which concerned the
1966 yearbook. (See story elsewhere in
The Reporter). The proposal, which the
voting members of the committee ap—
proved, gave the committee unabridged
powers of censorship of the yearbook
before it would be returned to the print-
er.
The yearbook editors, Henry Wilhelm
and John Phillips, did not accept the
proposal and refused to turn the manu-
script over to the committee.

Miss Neuman, the only member of
the committee who has flrst hand knowl-
edge of the book, commented on her ex-
pulsion trom the meeting "l’ve always
considered myself an essential member
of the committee and never dreamed or
being excluded. The committee members
were wasting their time deciding on the
yearbook issue Without talking to the edi-
tors of the book H I could have told them
so. After all, who knows more about stu-
dent publications, the editor of the col-
lege newspaper or a biology professor
(chairman of the committee, Dr. Ben-
jamin Graham)."

 

} Censorship

(continued from page 2)

0n conferring with Leggett and Joseph
Wall (history), Chairman of the Faculty,
Graham agreed with them that (in Leg-
gett‘s words) “the issue was not one of
the journalistic competence or taste but
rather of the existence or nonexistence
of libelous material and that, according-
ly, there was need for a legal, not an
editorial, judgment."

it was therefore decided that the man-
uscript should be sent to Leggett who
would deliver it unopened to the Gen-
eral Legal Counsel of the College, Mr.
John F. Bierman, a local lawyer.
American Yearbook Company was in-
formed of this decision on April 17 and
the manuscript was received in Leggett’s
absence by Dean of the College James
Stauss who delivered it to Bierman.

Bietman returned the manuscript along
with his opinion on May a, the day he
tore Leggett made his action public.
Bierman concluded, “In summary, my
opinion as general counsel for the Col-
lege is that the material places the
College in a position of liability.”

He said he had found “considerable
libelous material in the proofs." As an
example he cited the use of a student’s
picture alongside copy alluding to the
use of marijuana, The student is shown
kneeling on the iloor over an empty 35-
mm film cannister. Beside the film can-
nister is shredded material of some sort.

Said Bierman, "The picture itself
would not be libelous, but the editor has
made comment as to the use of mari-
juana, and of course the inference is
there and the same then becomes libel-
oos if this were not the fact.”

It is Bierman‘s opinion that pictures
Ire not in themselves libelous, because
"the picture itself would be evidence of
the fact itself." But the picture may be-
come libelous if it is used in combina-
tion with editorial comment.

Biermao cited 33 American Jurispru-
dence, Section 55, page 75, as the basis

for his opinion. it states in part: “At
common law, it is settled that written
or printed publications, caricatures, pic-
tures or effigies which falsely tend to
bring a person into public disgrace, con-
tempt, or ridicule are libelous,”

Wilhelm maintains “It has not been
shown that anything in the book is li-
belous in that it has not been shown
anything in the book is in tact untrue.

in the light of Bierman's advice. Leg-
gett announced his decision to instruct
the committee on publications “to inform
the American Yearbook Company that
a statement of release will not be forth-
coming, that said company be paid out
of college funds whatever monies are
due it for preliminary Work on the man-
uscript, and that you instruct the Busi-
ness Officer of the College to return to
subscribers and advertisers all monies
due them. Salaries already paid to in-
dividuals on the staft of the 1966 Cyclone
need not be returned."

Wilhelm met with Leggett, Wall, and
Graham on Thursday morning. The
book's business manager, Tim Ablett, and
managing editor, Sue Barquist, accom-
panied Wilhelm,

Wilhelm reportedly offered to confer
with a lawyer, remove anything of a
libelous nature, and proceed with the
book.

Leggett felt this was insutiicient, but
agreed not to class all possibility or the
book’s publication until further discus
sions had taken place.

He said yesterday, “Nobody has seen
the manuscript except Henry and the
lawyer and ljust don’t think that's
enough. if Tim and Sue had seen the
manuscript I might feel somewhat dit-
ferently.

According to Wilhelm, the book has
been seen in its entirety by three peo-
ple: himself, Phillips, and John Wolf,
a 1966 Grinnell graduate. Woif wrote the
prologue and much of the book's text
and helped Wilhelm proofread the entire
manuscript.

Miss Barquist has reportedly seen
"substantial parts of it" and Ablett did

not feel it was his business to see the
manuscript at all.

Wilhelm said the reason other staff
members had not seen the book was
not because of any effort to keep it
secret. He said “Susie certainly would
have seen the entire book had she been
here during spring vacation when it was
completed."

When Leggett was asked if he would
be satisfied if the publications committee
or someone designated by it would re
view the book and assure him that noth-
ing in it was overtly offensive, he an-
swered yes.

But, he said, “Henry doesn’t want any-
body to see the manuscript except a
lawyer. If his material had libelous Con-
tent to begin with, I think that is reason
enough to have somebody connected
with the college at least look at it.” He
cited the fact that none of the persons
who had seen the entire manuscript
were still Grinnell students.

Leggett was reportedly reluctant to re-
turn the manuscript to Wilhelm. When
Wilhelm threatened legal action, Leggett
returned the manuscript, He did so only
after Wilhelm agreed in writing that the
book would not be published without his
consent as “on official publication of
Grinnell College."

The resolution passed by the student
publications committee on Sunday was
presented by Wall. It apparently rose
out of a discussion among Leggett, Wall,
Dean of the College James Stauss and
Graham.

The resolution as recorded in the corn:
mittee's minutes reads: “board of pub-
lications takes manuscriptv—meets with
college lawyer—deletes libelous mater-
ialigoes over it again for content-we
tell Henry about the changes and send
it straight to the publisher.”

The resolution was passed by a five
to four vote of the committee which
includes b esides Graham, Charles
cleaver (E ngllsh), M. M. Liberman
(English), William s, Cobb (philosophy),
College Business Manager and Treasurer
Donald Lambie, and students Ric Mac-

Dowell, Susan Will, Lilah Morton, and
Paul Jones. Wall is an ex officio mem-
ber of the committee.

The vote was Secret but it is reliably
reported that the vote was not a student
vs. faculty split. At least some student!
voted for the resolution, while some or
the non-students voted against it.

The point at issue seems to be whether
the committee has the right to go over
the book “for content,” and if so, exactly,
what such an examination would en-
fail.

The by-laws of the committee state
explicitly that "the committee shall not
exercise prior censorship over any pub-
lication.” Wilhelm feels the resolution
as it stands is a violation of the by-
laws. 50 do several members of tho
committee, one of whom voted for the
resolution.

Paul Jones, who admits to having
voted for the resolution, .said, “It would
be censorship. But we were presented
with two alternatives, either accept the
resolution or there would be no book,"

Other committee members deny that
it is a question or censorship. They feel
that since the yearbook has been almost
solely a “oneman job" and that since
the question of libel has arisen, such
action is necessary.

They see their review of the book as
a replacement of the “normal" editorial
process of yearbook production in which
a number of student's collaborate in
producing a “joint effort."

The name change and the removal of
the advertising as well as the accusa-
tions or libel, and the alleged “one man"
nature of the book’s production havo
created the need for the committee's
review, according to the resolution’s sup<
porters.

Wilhelm Claims that he did not know
the name change needed clearance from
the committee. He had made no secret
of the change and had used it in the
book's sales campaign.

Wilhelm said, “The only purpose for
advertising in a yearbook is to help in
financing it. We didn't feel we needed
the money. We planned, or course, to
return advertising receipts already col-
lected."

Both Leggett and some of the com-
mittee members claim to be open to an
alternative suggestion from the book’s
editors.

Leggett attaches two stipulations to
any such suggestion. First, someone del-
egated by the publications committee
would have to at least look at the man-
uscript. This would presumably be some-
one associated with the college other
than the lawyer.

Second, signed releases from person:
whose pictures appear in a potentially
libelous context in the book would not
be accepted as a sufficient correction.

Otherwise, all suggestions will report.
edly be considered.

The editors are investigating the pos.
sibility of privately publishing the book,
in the event that no agreement with
the college can be reached.

tions work by the award of major academic credit
for their creative endeavors.

Other schools have attempted to solve their
publications problems and to encourage students
in these areas through similar systems. But at:
Grinnell we flounder in an antiquated and re
pressive structure and atmosphere because we
are waiting on President Leggett. He allows the
faculty majority to prevail; he sets the tone! He
allowed the censorship of the student production
The Chairs last semester and he censored the
student book this spring. President Leggett has
not clarified the college position on censorship,
even after being encouraged to do so by The Re-
porter and others and he has broken an agree-
ment to discuss the subject with the senate,

As former 5&3 editor John Wolf warns:

“The administration can’t be allowed to
become censor of Grinnell‘s strident publica-
tions. More than any other campus organiza-
tion —- including SGA — the mililications are
concerned about the rights of individual stu-
dents. The administrators—the would~be new
sors — are concerned about the well-being of
the “image,” not of the individual. If Presi-
dcn Leggett is allowed to exercise censorship,
the individual might be “censored out” in
favor of the image,

“The fact that President Leggett even
considered censoring the yearbook is fright-
ening. The fact that he did censor it is sick-
eningl The fact that he, with the help of
Chairman of the Faculty Joseph Wall and five
of the nine members of the Board of Publica-
tions, is considering extending “supervis-
ion" to other publications is intolerable.

“Censorship is an admission by the ad-
ministratiou that it doesn’t have the ability
to deal with vigorous, controversial publica-
tions.”

An open letter

Seniors admit visitations violations;

to Grinne" college suggesl increased open dorm:

We would like to bring up one of the
major aspects of the open dorm question,
one which frequently tends to be slighted
because of it’s controversial nature. Given
Grinnell’s present open~dorm policy, and
given that display of affection is a natural
result of male-female relationships, one is
faced with three alternatives: 1) One could
display affection in public. This, however,
is a great imposition on innocent bystand-
ers Would any single person venture into
the South Lounge after 1080? Does any-
one look forward to wendilig his way
through intertwined bodies at Haines or
Main door”! Perhaps most important, there
Is the embarrassment to the couples them
selves. 2) One could seek privacy on the
golf course or in a motel, The former is
cold and wet; the latter is not only expen-
sive, inconvenient, and undesirable, but

also is inappropiate for sexual relations
other than intercourse. 3) One could par-
ticipate in illegal open dorms, thereby
gaining muchrneeded privacy, but also in-
curring the risk of suspension,

The college policy on open dorms can-
not prevent illegal visitation. In the choice
between public or private display of affec-
tion, we have chosen private, thus violat-
ing college regulations. Students will con—
tinue to make this choice. We feel that
the integrity of the student and his right
to make personal decisions should be rec-
ognized and respected by the administra-
tion, Let us not base our considerations
of the open dorm question on a suspicious
attitude toward sex, but rather let us con-
sider those reasons for more opens which
would improve the social environment] and
benefit the campus as a whole.
