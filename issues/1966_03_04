The experiment is the new way of

Bob Fooie Elected
GotHP President

“We'll have to wait until after
the Hall Reorganization Commit«
tee puts forth its proposal on
changes in the hall structure he-
fore much work can hegi ' said
Bob Foote, the new COIHP Presi-
dent. speaking of his future pro-
‘gram.

“The two areas, however, where
work can begin immediately are
I committee on student—138:6 re-
lations and a reformation oi the
men's primary court," continued
Foote. He wants to set up a
CofiiP committee to look into the
men's judicial primary court with
the object of changing it into a
judicial committee. This would do
away with many or the formalis
ties and precedents begun by the
primary court this year without
making a basic change in the stu-
dent government system. A c0<
ordinating committee between stu-
dents and 8&6 is also presently
being set up.

“Open halls are touchy because
at pressure from trustees and the
administration’s past experiences:
nothing will be done in this area
until after the Hall Reorganization
Committee brings out its propos-
at," Foote said. He will also do
nothing on extending the car rule
until the proposal is heard.

Foote, of course, is for a liber-
aliz‘lng of the open dorm program
and allowing juniors the right to
have cars on campus. He also iaw
ors giving senior women unre-
stricted hours.

the loggia are locked half an hour
before closing time with the excep.
tion of four doors, Main. Loose,
ﬂames, and Haines driveway.
Then, at hours, the nightcheck ‘giri
locks Main and the night watchman
locks the other three. The result,
argues the AWS board. is that the
doors are all closed closer to hours.
This results in fairer enforcement
of the closing hours rules, they
feel.

Under the old system, the night
watchman started locking the door:
of the women's halls at Meats and
then walked down the luggia, look-
ing doors as he went. As Dean of
women Jean Slocum pointed out.
he was a slow walker. .

Social Budget Independence Nixed
As Senate Meets for last Time

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Meeting {or the last time in its
current form Wednesday, the sen-
ate discussed a recommendation
train the social coordinating com-
mittee that its budget be separate
irom that of the student govern-
ment.

President .ierry Goddard said
that the proposal was “not in the
interests of the Grinnell student
community,“ although he ielt that
the committee’s other recommen-
dations were “thoughtful and ex-
cellent and embody the social ideas
we would like to see on this cam-
pus.”

Goddard said that the Senate is

in a good position to reflect where
the emphasis in programming
should be, because it votes on the
budget. Acceptance of the social
com in i tte e's recommendation
would mean that it would be on a
fixed fee exempt from the bud-
getry process and safe from bud-
get reductions. The means of allot-
ment would be transferred from
the Senate in the administration.

Goddard said, “The students
should have control through their
elected representatives as to how
their money is spent."

In response to a suggestion that
the social committee iclt it could
get more money trim the adminis-

 

EURIPIDES ANTI-WAR play

‘The Trojan Women'

"The Trojan Women," which
captured almost every dramatic
award possible during its long run
in New York, including the covet-

. ed Drama Critics Circle Award.

'The Troian Women' will be

presented to Grinnell students Sunday.

will be presented here Sunday. 3
and s p.m., in Roberts Theatre.

“The Trojan Women" is a pow.
eriul anti-war play as meaningtul
now as it was in 416 ac, when
it was iirst produced. The passing
years have in no way diminished
the anguished protest this tower-
ing tragedy voices e the universal
cry of outrage against the cmelties
and barbarisms or war.

The Greek tragedian, Euripides,
wrote “The Trojan Women" while
Athens was at war, a few months
alter an especially barbaric act
was committed. The people of the
island oi Melos wished to remain

neutral during the Peloponneslan'
' himself what War is like when one

War, in enraged retribution, the
Athenians enslaved the women and
children and murdered all the a-
dult males.

Euripides, horrified at this mis-
erable byproduct of war, wrote
his play of protest, using the vic-
tory of Greece over Troy as his
theme. “The Trojan Women” has

 

universal tragedies in dramatic
literature. The vanquished Trojans
become the protagonist of the
drama, helpless victims of the
horrors of \var, who, nevertheless,
valiantly strive to retain their no-
biiity.

The late Edith Hamilton, recog-
nized as one of the great scholars
at the classical world, proVided a
new translation ot “The Trojan
Women” which remains true (0 the
original spirit, and yet adapts with
stunning pliability to the demands
of a modern stage — and a mod-
ern audience. Compact, terse langr
uage carries the author’s burning
conviction through the centuries to
a living audience today.

Edith Hamilton Wrote of “The
Trojan Women"; “Euripides asked

looks straight at it. This play is
the answer. He was called the poet
oi the world’s griet. in this play
he sounded the deepest depth of
that grief.”

Tickets are available at the
Forum desk. An activtties card is
required.

 

tration than from the finance com-
mittee. Dan Bucks said it was
probably because the social com-
mittee was not well—iniormed last
year. its expectations were too
high because it thought the entire
budget increase was $11,000, when
it was only $7.000.

Bucks felt the new system 01
having two non-voting members on
the ﬁnance committee, irom the
social coordinating committee and
board of publications w 0 ul d
remedy this.

Goddard said that the social
committee has gotten more in-
creases over the past several years
than all other areas put together.
This is because of rising Costs, but
he said, “The pic is only so big,
and there are only a certain num<
ber of ways we can cut it.”

Money is always requested in ex.
cess of what is available, and the
finance committee tries to bring
the budgets into the realm of the
possible. “No one can get all the
money he wants." ,

The Senate also approved th
finance committee report. The
three items were $350 to the diihyz
ramb committee for the inaugural
Dinner on Saturday. April 15; $100
to the Grinnell Review for experi.
mentation with next year’s issues;
and $110 to send Dan Bucks and
Rick Edwards to the iniercolle<
giate Conference on the Urban
Challenge at M.i.T,

Chris Peterson told the Senate
that the grace minutes proposal
has not yet gone into etiect, al-
though temporary changes in door-
locking procedure began last weeie
end. She said that no student I'EiBP
endum was necessary to approve
the new plan, because it is not a
constitutional change. it will go to
the faculty meeting on Monday
and ii there is no objection there
it will go to the trustees.

The ‘Ad Hoc' Committee

Tentative appointments to President Leggett’s Ad Hoc,
Committee on Hall Reorganization were made this week. The ,

appointments now await Leggett’s approval. The three facul-
ty members named to the committee by chairman of the
committee, associate dean Richard Winters, are Luther Erick-
son (chemistry). R. Homer Norton (history). and Henry-York

Steiner (English) The students named to the committee byl

Jerry Goddard, SGA president, are Steve Kent, SGA president-
elect, Karen Lauterbach, AWS Board presidentelect, and
Bob Foote, CofHP president-elect.

As soon as this committee is approved and meets it will
receive from the Executive Council of the faculty a series of
proposed changes in the housing system. it is upon these
proposals that the committee will act. From these proposals
they will make recommendations to President Leggett. The
nature of these proposals will be of great interest to the en-
tire campus and when they are released it is hoped that the
student representatives on the Ad Hoc committee Will make
a real effort to consult with the students as a whole about

the recommendations.

The working of this Ad Hoc committee should, by all in-

dications, be a very difficult

task. President Leggett, who

called the committee together, has committed himself to
some sort of change in the housing system. He has gone on
the record as saying that “there is excessive moral neutrality
in the residence hall system” and that it lacks the “flexibility

it needs. Leggett has also indicated that the Executive Coun-
cil, which is making the proposals that will be the Ad Hoc com-
mittee’s raw material, feels that ”anti-intellectualisin is pretty

prevalent on Nolth Campus."

0n the other hand, the student members are just as firm-
ly committed to the opposite stands In a letter to the_editor
on October 8, 1965, SGA president-elect StevegKent said that
“Personally I have no gripes with the present hall’systern and
I think there is much to recommend it.” Foote, i_n asimilar
way, feels that the present system should be maintained ~‘
and said so while campaigning for CofHP president.

How this conflict is resolved should be interesting. i
think the Ad Hoe committee should keep the student body
posted on the progress it is making. This, after all, is a prob-
lem with which we’re all concerned.

To Study City During Break

”The Inner City Project is not
I social workers‘ convention," as-
rcrls Dennis Spencer, cochairman
oi the social action committee of
the Board of Religion.

“The students who participate
in the proiecl are not on a mission
to clean up the slums. They will
be going in order to become ac-
quainted wilh the poveriyslricken
sections at large ciries."

The program will take place' in
Chicago, Sr. Louis, and New York
over spring break, and Spencer in-
dicated lhai people who are inter-
ested in the program should con-
tact him or Charlene Ellis by
Tuesday.

Spencer emphasized that sui-
dents will have an opportunity to
go out on their own in who: he
called the “neighborhood plunge."

"They will have a chance to
really lalll with the people and un-
derstand their problems. With all
Lhe talk about the ‘secular city'
there is a growing concern about
the urban situation, The Inner City
Project provides the opporniniiy

 

lot students to leave their ivory
tower and gain an understanding
and appreciation of the problems
that face our society.”

In the ”neighborhood plunge”
studenls can go out on the streets
and just talk to people, or get a
job tor a day as a laborer and
work next lo the people they are
trying to know. Spencer told of
how two Gi'innellians, posing as a
married couple, wenr lrom door to
door last year telling landlords
rhey were looking lor an apartv
merit and talking to the people in
me buildings about living condir
tions and their outlook on life in
general.

One church in each city arranges
for living accommodations. and
while the students Work in a fairly
loose framework, there are planned
events such as a welfare tour, vis-
its to slum schools, and meeiings
w i t h community organizations.
Spencer said that students are ex-
pected to provide their own trails-
poriarion to die cities and should
bring about $25 spending money.

A curious question has arisen out oi the ashes,
dust and blood of Viet Nam. Those who have grown
used to taperrecorded screams, newsreel dismember-
menis and daily liveinch headlines are wondering
it, and those who can recall the joysome and full-
heurted spirit with which America pursued its com-
mitments in the great World Wars are asking it.
Has America become a nation or lilypanis?

Fanatics have long deplored a supposed decadence
in morality and courage, but only recently have
more educated bigots been arguing the same point.
Student prolesls and draft-card conflagrations and
other violent acts express oven hostility to the pres-
ent war effort, and some opinion polls have indicated
that even respectable people do not unanimously
consent to our great Leviathan's policies. Such eviv
dence lhen suggests that our brave soldiers also
would preler not to be in Viet Nam.

A Des Moines Register article from Valentine's
Day, l966, demonstrated dramatically the degenera-
tion from the “Over There!” spirit of WWI to the
modern altitude of “go away, unpleasant nasty
thing." in the Great War (related the article) the
military hierarchy had been so upset by a French
offer of licensed, inspected prostitutes for innocent
American doiighboys that ihey refused to let Presi-
dent Wilson even hear about such a “blatant pru«
position." preferring in let the dry rot take ils na-
tural toll along with the bombs and the bullets. TD<
day, on the contrary, we snicker lewdly and open-
ly at the rate of venereal disease in Viet Nam and
cynically note the fact that prophylactic manufac<
ture is now “essential industry."

What has caused the declenslon from former ideaL
ism and enthusiasm to present nihilism and weak
ness? Prior to World War II, America showed no
great desire to create unhappiness in the world, and
if it had not been (or Pearl Harbor, our wise leaders
would have graciously accepted the occupancy or

million Jews on the principle of self-determination of
governments. i.e., any government can determine its
own action as long as they do not interfere with
our plans. Even unprovoked violence, indeed, was in.
sufﬁcient to maintain a natural furor and hatred of
our enemy for three years. and so periodic appeals
to the loathsome innate character of the enemy had
to be made.

while biologists have discovered nothing conclu-
sive about the relative merits of the various racial
and national groups, four district factors gave pl’e»
liminary indications that the Krauts and Nips were
interior classes. (1) They looked funny. (2) They
talked runny, (3) They acted runny, (4) They were
runny. The American public did not have to take the
word or some oilicial ptopagandizer for these iacis,
either, since simpla observations or Kraut and Nip
communities within America confirmed them.

The weakness of our Viet war effort must be ri-
diculously apparent by now. Namely this: There are
no Vietnamese in America to remind us or our
hatred, to congeal our blood in constant loathing,
to foster our outrage lhaz here is one possibility at
human existence that deserves to be exterminaleri
or expunged like a cancerous blight. Not one Viet
Cong shall survive. Then we will blast North Viet
Nam back to the Stone Age. And why slop there?
The South Vietnamese are no better — perhaps worse
tor presuming to our form of govemment — and
after they have aided our victory, they shall be
thanked with an appropriate nuclear devastation
Remember (lo paraphrase the great President wu-
son) — the world that is sales: for democracy is
one without people.

Enough is enough. The suggestion of the proper
attitude has been made. “Survival, security, surplus”
is the universal hierarchy by which to measure the
achievements of nations. and America alone has
gained the topmost rank. Let us not render our great
attainment of the iinal goal worthless by ignoring
and despising the two more basic values.

 

Grace Minutes Theory
Not Progress: Reichs

To the Editor:

Carls Go For 40 (Count ‘Eml Hours C

is it possible to grant litieen
“grace minutes” in

The rider in the Senate bill indi-
cates it is. ii women are given
the grace minutes, but must of the

on weekends, rhe ones remaining
open being locked promptly at 12.
all the surplus minutes gained in

ing lite dull for the night watch»
man, not in mention Grinnell's
suir sprinters, this idea seems to
,go against the theory of grace

minutes are those coming in late;

at 12, the women may have
“gained" 15 grace minutes, but
they’ve also lost about half that

This is progress?

An expanded open house plan
has been drafted in a joint Carleton
student meeting. The meeting of
the Carleton Men’s League, Woin~
en's League, C.S.A., and me Board
of Proctors approved a proposal of
open houses in all dorms each al-
ternoon from I to 5 with closed
doors, extension of hours tn 7 p,m.
to 11:45 p.m. on Fridays, and 7
p.m. to [2:45 am. on Saturdays.
Dormitories may also choose by a
twothirds vote to have an extra
open house provided they give 2
list of signatures lrorn that dorm to
the dean forty-eight houis in ad-
Vance.

The proposal was submitted to
the StudentrFaculiy~Administration
Council for discussion a week ago.
ii the council approves the pro-
posal, lt will be submitted to the
Faculty — Administration — Tnlstee
Council for serious consideration
and perhaps modification.

An amendment to the proposal
providing the “option lor earlier
closing hours on a given open
house in an individual dorm basis"
removed the opposition of many
girls who ielt they would be incon-
venienced with the extended hours.

No WEEKEND HOURS

The principle or no hours on
weekends for senior women has
been approved by Coe’s Srudeni
Affairs Committee composed oi
iacully members. The AWS-spon~
sored proposal was approved by a
unanimous vole of the committee;
details will be Worked out later.

Coc's Dcan oi Women hopes to
pin the plan inio eilect in lime for.

needs lo iiiiri a proctor to be on

 

duty between the hours of 1 am.
and 6 am on Saturday and Sun-

for senior women was suggested
as an alternative but was rejected
by the AWS board bclore their
proposal even reached the com-
mittee.

A petition sponsoied by Antioch's
Students for a Democratic Society

mation to local draft boards.

in presenting the petition which
contained 186 student signatures
obtained over a [our-day period,
an SDS member demanded ihat

ment opposing Uls. policies in Viet

I turned over my roommate's new Simon and Gar-

The kid had been from down South somewhere.
South Carolina I think. He'd been the only one in
his outtit to get it. The paper had talked with his
parents. They said they were very sad that he was
dead but knew that he would want them to be proud
of him and that they were proud of the job he'd
done.

The kid next door came charging in to use the
phone. "You drinking on a week night? Boy, it must

be great to he an upperrclassman and not have any
responsibility.” He ordered his fourteen inch onim‘l

Students will be supervised by I
stat! of scientists, both resident

headquarters are in Costa Rica.
and students may work anywhere
in Central America, An enticing
aspect is the independent research
project undertaken by each stu-
dent, who has much latitude ill
choice and may avail himseli or
tutorial help. Two additional at-
tractions are the chance to livo
with a native ismiiy and the pub.
lication at all projects. Students
may earn up to a full semester's
credit for six months or a year'l
credit for a twelve month sojourn
with the program. The amount oi
credit is contingent upon the work
accomplished.

Gi'innell sludents who particl-

program is well illustrated by
Langham's and Pojman‘s respet‘n

Grime/lion Describes Peace [0 5 Experiences

ED. NOTE: This year ls the
Peace Corps’ iiith anniversary and
tomorrow the Peace Corps place-

‘ment exam will be administered
on Campus. Henly Wilhelm, a
sophomore and co-editor of the
Cyclone, was a volunteer. He
joined the Peace Corps arter grad-
uating from high school and served
a year in Bolivia belore he was
injured in a jeep accident. Below
‘is an interview between Wilhelm
and John Wolf about Wilhelm’s
year in the Peace Corps.

By JOHN WOLF

Q: Where did you work and
what was your job there?

A: I worked on a colonization

project (ﬁnanced by the us. Agen<
cy for international Development)
that resettled tin miners and others
from the highlands of Bolivia to
previously uninhabited areas which
are potentially very productive ag-
riculturaily. This new area was lo-
cated in the jungles in the eastern
foothills ot the Andes, My job was
that of a “Community developer,"
which is the Peace Corps’ term
for a person who goes into a com-
munity, learns to understand it,
. and then tries to work with the
people in any way that he thinks
may beneiit them. This may be
helping build roads — as We did
— teaching in schools, helping the
people organize politically, and in
some Cases, even working in coach-
ing or recreation programs. al~
though there is some doubt about
how much real good this type of
activity does.

Q: Exactly what did this en-
tail for you?

n: i was sent there to help in-
.stall electrical systems in the vil-
lages, since i had had several sum-
merS’ experience in that line, But
upon arriving, it was quickly ap-
parent that there was not going
to be electricity in this area
for years to come, This just
as well because they would prob-
. ably have had very little use ior it
anyway. So alter a frustrating
month of trying to figure out what
to do, I turned my attention to
helping people earn more money
from their Crops. This included
various activities such as intro-
ducing tomatoes as a cash crop,
setting up a tomato-box coopera-
tive, and experimenting with var-

ious tomato varieties to find which
kinds were best for that region,
and helping build roads.

Q: What did the Bolivians
think of you and your fellow
workers?

A: Most of them had previously
had little if any Contact with Amer-
icans. Generally, though, they did
have some ideas about them. such
as “All Americans are rich”
(which they are, relatively speak.
ing), “President Kennedy and
Jackie are good people." and
"America has racial problems."

Initially the villagers were some
what aloof from us. However, they

soon got used to us and we to them. _
For the most part they were sim- 2

ply a very nice people, perhaps a
bit more honest and straightforr

Iagers' help we built about eight
miles of much-needed road. The
first road was named John F. Ken-
nedy Avenue by the villagers. The
villagers threw uS a huge, drunken
brawl when the first road was fin-
ished, and the chief of one of the
villages offered his Wife to one of
the volunteers ior the night. He
didn't accept — it Wouldn’t have
been the strategic thing to do.

Q: Some people say the Peace
Corps is just a tool for bettering
the U.S. image abroad. How do
you react to this?

A: I’d say in many cases that's

ward than most Americans. Most ‘ ,

of the minor Bolivian government
officials that we worked with were,
however, often not so nice, We Vole
unteers had numerous disagree-
ments with them, and one volun-
teer, who, by the way, is now
Peace Corps administrator in Ed
Iivia, got in such a heated argu-
ment with his village government
chief that the government man
said he would quit if the volunteer
didn't leave. He didn’t leave, and
the man quit. The volunteer was
then appointed village chief.

Q: What were some other in-
teresting incidents?

A: wheu the iarmers began
growing more tomatoes than they
could carry out on their backs, it
became apparent that they needed
some roads built. Therefore, an-
other volunteer and I set out try-
ing to get a bulldozer. We asked

U.S.-A.T.D. in LaPaz for the loan ”

of a bulldozer, but they weren‘t
very hot on the idea or on us. one
of the AID. men later Said that
his group was angry that the Peace
Corps was getting all the publicity
from the press while his group
was having a hard time getting
money irom Congress for what he
considered more important work.
About a month later, still with-
out a bulldozer, I got mad and sent
a letter to Sargent Shriver asking
for help. However. the letter never
got out of Bolivia because our proj-
ect administrator intercepted it.
He said it didn’t reflect well on the
group. We had a lot of trouble with
him; however, he was eventually
"cal d to Washington for consul-
tation" and never seen again.
Meanwhile. the American am-
oassador heard about our plight
and instructed U.S.-A.I.D. to lend
us a bulldozer. We didn't know how
to operate it other than how to
make it go in a straight line, out
we soon learned. With the vil-

a valid statement. However, to
like to emphasize that a volunteer
is almost always free to assert
himself in any way that he feels is
tnlly most beneficial to the people
he iS working with. A lot of the
Peace Corps administrative per—
sonnel that I knew were in'fact
quite concerned about furthering
the 11.8. image. For example, one
volunteer who worked in Bolivia
spent most of his time going from
village to village with a portable
movie projection outfit showing

films for entertainment. These
films, more often than not, were
dubbed-in American illms showing
the better aspects of Us. life, or
at least the wealthier aspects.

Q: What did you think of the
training program for the Peace
Corps?

A: For my Bolivian group, the
training program was probably
less a training program than it
was a selection process. Eventual-
ly, we lost 40 per cent of our
group, mainly ior psychological
reasons, They didn't try to teach
us any specific skill; instead most

«out

of the time was spent learning
Spanish and some general things
about Bolivia, the 11.5., and health
problems we would encounter in
Bolivia. These health hazards in-
clude dysentery, snakebites, ven-
ereal disease, and insect-home
diseases — including Chagas dis-
ease, which is contracted from
beatles biting the victim on the lip
while asleep causing sudden death
from heart paralysis some years
later.

We also had several anthro ins
structors, who ”told us about Bo-
livian people." They were so con—
cerned with the oddities of the cul-
ture, social sou-systems, history oi.
the people that even the people
didn’t know about, and the like,
that we ended up with a very dis-

 

l

 

torted picture that the Bolivian
people were really different from
us; they weren‘t. These days. the
Peace Corps is putting less stress

on anthropological training. This
is not to say that a detailed know-
ledge of the culture is not helpful,
only that things must be kept in
proper perspective.

Q: What did you like about the
Peace Corps?

Al For a young person, the
Peace Corps is probably an unpar—
alleled opportunity to be out on
your own in an oft-times difficult
situation. it is a chance to really
apply yourseli in a practical way,
dealing with practical problems
and working with real people in a
real world. For someone who has
been in a college such as Grinnell,
it may at first be somewhat of a

_ shock to be totally responsible for
* yourselt and what you do, and ior

the people with whom you work:
much may he at stake.

Several years from now, when
a Bolivian is carrying tomatoes to
market on the road from his Vil-
loge, he may not remember much
about you or the US, but his fam-
ily will be better fed because you
were there, and you will probably
be better off, too.

Scholarships awarded to Grinneil

. Air Force ROTC cadets this fall

will be based primarily on skills

needed by the Air Force, according

to Major Albert C. Omer (new
space studies).

“Financial assistance grants will

be used to attract high quality stu-

dents with particular skills and

abilities of use to the Air Force,"
said Major Omer.

with the exception of the few
scholarships to selected senior
cadets, scholarships will again go
to cadets entering the third year of
the four-year Air Force ROTC pro-
gram. Other minimum qualiﬁca-
tions include a grade point aver-
age or at least 2.5, a 30 percentile
score on the Air Force Officer
Qualifying Test, full physical qual-
ifications, and personal and moral
nttributes expected of Air Force
officers.

Scholarships are made to the in-
dividunl cadet because of his per-
formance and qualifications. He

he transfer to a ditferent school so
long as he remains tully qualified.
His status will be reviewed each
term to determine whether he con-
tinues to be fully qualified.

Initial nominations will he made
by the selection board lat Grinnell.
The board will consist of Air Force
ROTC officers and school officials.

These nominations will be tor-
warded to AFROTC headquarters
where a central selection board
will dete mine the final scholar-
ship recipients on a best quaiitied
basis. Selected cadets will be no-
tiiied not later than May 15 by Air
Force ROTC. Those not selected by
the central board will be consid
ered as alternates for primary selr
lectees, or for scholarships which
may be later vacated by primary
selectees.

Matmen Only Hope
for Grinnell First

Midwest Conference meet
action awaits Grinnell wrest~
ling, indoor track, and swim»
ming teams this weekend with
only the matmen listed among
the championship challengers.

The biggest dog fight in
ears is expected at the wresta
ing meet in Beloit today and
tomorrow, with Grinnell,
Lawrence, Cornell, and Mon-
mouth all given a chance to
cart away the title.

Winner of both the indoor
and outdoor crowns four
straight times, Grinnell is ex-
pected to finish among the al-
So rans at this year's indoor
meet, which will be staged in
Chicago, today.

The Pioneer swimmers are
picked for a second division
spot in the competition at Ap~

leton, Wisconsin, today and
omorrow.

WRESTLING

Grinnell’s hopes in the mat
meet will be riding with Mike
Martinson, Bill Barnes, Ken
Strubler, John Sharpe,. and
Gary Wilson, All should issue
strong challenges for indivi-
dual championships,

Martinson is 10-4 for the
season at 115 and has lost to
only one conference opponent.

Step Up To

JD‘S RESTAURANT

Elevated — at my, Main. Grlnneli

The defending titlist at 123,
Barnes is 14-2 for the cam»
paign and undefeated and un-
tied in league action.

Strubler, who placed sec-
ond at 130 a year ago, has an
8»2-1 mark for the season
with a tie his only blemish
in conference competition.

The team’s top winner at
14-3-0, Sharpe has a perfect
loop mark at 145, his usual
weight, but dropped one de-
cision when he moved up to
152.

Wilson, the third place fin-
isher at 167 in 1965, is 13-3-2
overall this winter and 6-0-2
against conference foes, His
victims include last year’s 157-
and 167-pound champions.

Other Pioneers likely to
pick up points are Joel Rich-
man, 137; Ray Mendel, 152;
and Lou Kelley, 167.

Coach Terry Moore’s club
topped six conference foes—
Ripon, Beloit, Knox, Mona
mouth, Carleton, and St. Olaf
—in dual meets while losing
to Lawrence and Cornell.

INDOOR TRACK

With only six lettermen on
a 12-man squad that Coach
Dick Young calls the weakest
he’s ever had at Grinnell, the

 

Pioneers are expected to drop
several steps down the ladder.

Only three of the squad
members —— pole vaulter Walt
Neal, high jumper Tom Wood,
and sprinter-middle distance-
man Steve Brintnall—collect-
ed points a year ago as the
Pioneers edged out Carleton
by five points for the indoor
championship and by two
points for the outdoor crown.

A fourth letterman, Jeri
Langham, was one of the top
pointmen on the 1963 and
1964 championship outfits.
but missed the 1965 campaign
while in Central America on
a special study project. He
will anchor three relay teams
Friday.

Probable Pioneer entries in

individual event are:

60-yard dash —« Brintnall
and Jon Buswell; 60-yard low
hurdles »—« Brintnall; 2-mile
run — Doug Dray and Spen:
cer Clark; pole vault —- Neal;
high jump — Wood; long
jump — Buswell; and shot put
—Tom Russell.

Running on the relay units
in addition to Langham will
be Rick MacDowell, John Kel-
sey, Brintnall, and Dray.

SWIMMING
Though picked to finish

 

near the bottom of the stand
ings, Coach Irv Simone’s Pio-
neers are counting on strong
individual performances to
lift theln into the middle eche-
Ion.

Best Pioneer bets for high
placings in individual events
appear to be butterflyer Ken
Adelman and individual med-
ley specialist Steve Holtze.

Holtze has twice defeated
Cornell's Bob Reimers, the
league's defending medley
champ, this winter. Adelman
has lost two times to Phil
Gibbs of Cornell, the loop tit-
list, and Knox’s Brad Routon,
but is hoping the old “third
time a charm” adage comes
true

Sprinter Bill Lontz is anoth-
er Pioneer who could place
among the leaders. He was
second in the 50 freestyle last
winter.

These three will also see ac-
tion on Grinnell’s two relay
units, along with the other
three members of the team—
Bill Batschelet, Rich Seiiert,
and Bob Wells.

Both foursomes are potenti-
al point-getters.

 

Worst Basketball Year
.45 Pioneer: See/t 2nd,

The Pioneers dropped three
more games this past week and
assured themselves of the Worst
record a Grinnell basketball team
has ever had in the Midwest Con—
ference.

Last year's team, which had a
513 record, was the worst previous
one. If the Pioneers pick up both
wins this weekend, they will only
have a 3715 record. Wins this Week-
end will not be easy as both op-
ponents, Knox and Monmouth, own
earlier victories over the Pioneers
and are rated among the better
schools in the conference.

 

The Pioneers spent the weekend

round car care, you

can’t do any better.

STANDARD

 

in Wisconsin, visiting Lawrence
and Ripon. There they saw the
home teams pour through the near-
ly unbelievable total DE 225 points
in the two games.

PRO-LIKE FIRST HALF

Lawrence greeted them on Fri-
day night with a 66 point barrage
in the first half, a total usually only
professionals can achieve. After
cooling on to only 49 points in the
second half, Lawrence still finished
with a torrid 54% shooting average
from the field.

The Pioneers did not have a bad
night in shooting, hitting 41%, but
were thoroughly whipped in re-
bounding 63735, which kept the
game iron-t getting close. The ﬁnal
score was 1157B. Jeif Frantz's 27
points led the Pioneers.

HOSPITABLE RIPON

Ripon proved to be a little more
hospitable, Waiting until the second
halt to bury the Pioneers. The Red-
men took only a 48-33 half-time
lead, but. made up for it by poor-
ing in 62 second halt points for [he
110-72 victory. The Pioneers suf-
fcred another humiliating night on
the boards _ losing that battle

3rd Wins

One bright spot for the Pioneers
was guard Mike Schwartz who
scored 20 points.

17 STRAIGHT

Tuesday night the Pioneers trav-
eled to Mount Vernon where they
lost their seventeenth straight road
game 103-70. The last time the Pin-
neers won a road game was the
opening game of last season when
they beat Cornell. This time the
Rams showed no mercy and as-
sured the Pioneers of thelr ﬁrst
undisputed last-place ﬁnish in the
Midwest Conference.

The Pioneers stayed close for a
while. It was tied at 12712 once.
but then Cornell ran off twelve
straight points and were never
again headed.

The halt-time score was 5640
and in the second half the Rams
pushed over the century mark ~
the third straight opponent to do
so — to win 103-70. Cornell was
also the third straight opponent to
enjoy a healthy margin in re-
bounds. The Rams won this battle
63-33.

Leading the Pioneers were Mike
Schwartz with I7, Ted Risser wlth
12, and Greg Rankin won 10.

Calls. Oles
Fall Victim
To Malmen

The Grinnell wrestlers won their
last two dual meets of the year,
beating St. Olaf 23-19 and Wallop‘
ing Carleton 37-8. The two Victories
bring the grapplets' dual meet sea-
son record to an 8 and 6 mark.

Bill Barnes, Gary Wilson, and
Louis Kelley led the Pioneers to
their triumphs with a pair of wins ,
for each. Bames collected two falls
in times of 4:42 and 2125; Wilson
and Kelley each pinned one oppon-
ent with Wilson gaining the fastest
fall or the day in 1:32. ..

Mike Martinson and Bob Gelle
won on one forfeit and one deci-
sion. Ken Stmhler tied in his first
match and won by decision in his
second. Splitting for the altemoon
were John Sharpe and Ray Men<
del: Mendel pinned his Carleton
opponent.

With a look, now, at all the con.
terence teams, Grinnell enters the
Midwest Conference ”1' o u r n a-
mom with promising expectations.
in the past, a pre-lournament tav-
orite to take home the crown has
never been difficult to select;
Cornell has had a long-standing
supremacy that dates back over
more than 20 years. Last year.
however, Cornell won the tourna-
ment by only one point over Mon-
mouth with Grinnell a more dls«
tant third. And this year a light
battle appears even more likely,
for no one is expected to run away
with it.

with a cautious optimism, how-
ever, Coach Moore believes Grin-
nell has the best chance of cup-
ping the first place trophy.

Girls Wipe Parsons;
