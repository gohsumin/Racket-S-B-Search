A Grinnell College audieneel
Monday was told that since the.
human mind cannot take in that

patchwork mental picture oi
the universe must be a mis—
leading picture of the indivisible
reality.

The speaker was Arnold J.]
Teynbee. visiting Heath profes-
sor of history. in the iii-st of a
series of tour lectures on “The
Philosophy ol History.” Mr.
Toynbee said:

"Owing to this imperleoted.

we cannot avoid partitioning.

verse into disciplines,

“Human affairs are merely

which includes all the nonchu-
man phenomena too. Man, like
other living creatures, is in-
separable trom his total en-
vironment, and is unintelligible

mental setting"

Using “The lndivisibility and
Unpredictability of Human At—
fairs” as his topic, Dr, Toynbee,
pointed out that the study ot
human altairs is broken down,
into a number or sub-disciplines
such as psychology, anthropol—
ogy, sociology, history, etc. I

“We cannot avoid dividingl
human affairs up into compare,
merits and concentrating on
some single compartment," he‘
said, “but we must never let
ourselves take the dividing

“The partitioning into disv

ing.”

Although he argued that we
should study the universe as a
whole all of the time, the his

disciplines

_torian conceded that, as human

beings the humanities have the
tirst call on us,

“The proper study of manv
kind is man," he said, “in the
sense that the first business on
our agenda is to live with olli’~
selves and with each other If
we lail in this, we cannot suc-
ceed in anything else Human
affairs matter supremely to us,
because they are our affairs "

Asserting that “challenge and
response" is a more realistic
rormula than "cause and ettect"
when dealing in human attairs,
the historian said that in hu-
man allairs, unlike astronomy,

but a treedom of choice—that is

Al'ter citing scrcral “unc

in hu-

One of the i din l :isoiis I feel that Grin-

It is growing — and growth means change.
This change must collie not only from a prop
g‘i'es e. aleit administration, but is to a great
extent the responsibll y of the most vital part
of any institution of learning, tlle students. The
students must be aware enough to make their
college iears conform to their personal academe
ie. intellectual and cultural interests. It is my
contention not that the student IUIOW best how
to educate tllemselves, rather that the student
should be allowed to be or should be viewed as
being mature enough to indicate to lIiilIsell and
‘Jollow tor himself the Collise and manner of
study he desires; otherwise learning' becomes
colllpulsory r ther than soun'ht after, sedentary
instead of vital and stimulating:
