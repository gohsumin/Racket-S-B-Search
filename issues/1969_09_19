Statement on Drug Problem

T0: Students and Faculty
FROMl Glenn Leggett

Below is a statement describing the basic position and pro-
eedures under which the College will proceed with the “drug
ﬁi'oblem." it should be read as a supplement to the already pub-

shed statement in the Student Handbook, pages 18—19.

This supplementary statement was prepared in consultation
with representative faculty and students, with resident advisers,
and With the legal counsel of the College. The problems surround~
ing drug use are very complicated, and I am aware that this
statement is imperfect. Events and continuing discussion will
bring iorth suggestions for improving it; they will he welcome
and considered for incorporation into future Statements. In the
t‘neantime, however, I believe this supplementary statement, which
is effective as of this date, provides us with a defensible position
and a useful series of procedures for supporting it.

Alter the first paragraph, which is largely a rte-statement of
the material in the Grinnell Student Handbook, pages 18-19, the
following is designed to describe the general procedures by which
the College will implement its established position on the illegal
drug problem:

The College expresses deep concern over the possible harm to
Kiudents who may be involved in the use of dangerous and unlawful
drugs, and wishes to make its attitude toward the use of such
drugs as clear as possible. The major concerns are the serious
possibility or damage to the mental and physical health of users,
the legal consequences of involvement in the possession or distri-
bution of drugs, the effect oi drug use on the academic well-being
of students, and the likelihood that drug users will encourage others
in the campus community to become involved. The College will
make efforts to inform students about drug use, by providing both
individual counselling and outside speakers and reading materials.

Students are reminded that private and conﬁdential help
concerning drug problems is available, They are encouraged to
use the confidential services of the Jasper-Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Center; or, if they wish, they may talk with a resident
ldvlser or staff coumellor or student dean or faculty person of
their choice. They will be given all the private and confidential
help the college can provide, and this confidentiality will be
respected. .

with these considerations in mind, the College will proceed as
follows with students involved in illegal drug use:

(1) If there ls alleged to be substantial knowledge that a stu«
dent is using any kind of illegal drug in the residence halls or on
campus, he will be asked to confer with I group composed of
the student deans, a faculty member or a student’of his own
choosing, and a faculty member appointed by the Chairman of
the Faculty.

As a result of this private discussion, the group may decide
on any or more of the following:

(A) The allegations about drug use may not be true, or

(B) The student may be told to seek professional counselling,
or

(C) The student may be told to seek psychiatric help, or

(D) The student may be reprimanded, or
(in 'event of any of these latter three results, the parents or
guardians oi ihe student may be notified if circumstances appear
lo make such action advisable.)

(E) The student may be recommended for disciplinary action
to the president of the College. Any disciplinary action, if
so recommended, may range from social probation through
removal from the residence halls to dismissal from col-
lege. In any of these possibilities, and in accordance with
usual practice in disciplinary matters, the parents or
guardians oi the student will be notified. This practice of
notification is part or the College‘s obligation to parents
and guardians.

Recommendations for disciplinary action will he sent to the
resident of the College. The student so recommended may appeal
is case to the president, or he may first ask for 3 Judicial Coun-

cll hearing. In the latter evem, all information made available to
the private discussion group will in turn be made available to
the Judicial Council. Depending on the recommendation of the
Judicial Council, the student may appeal his ease to the president
of the College.

(2) If a student has an adverse reaction to any drug he should

Bdilﬁ Pal/{Y S REVISEE

President Glenn Leggett to-
day issued a supplementary
statement to the Student Hand-
book ”designed to describe the
general procedures by which
the college will implement its
established position on the ille-
gal drug problem."

“I believe this supplementary
statement, which is effective as
of this date, provides us with a
defensible position and a useful
series of procedures for sup-
porting it," Leggett said in a
cover letter released with the
statement,

STATEMENT “lMPERFECT”

Citing the complexity of the
drug problem, Leggett called
the statement “imperfect" and
emphasized that it is subject to
revision as “events and Continu-
ing discussion” make it neces:
sary.

“My essential problem in
writing the statement was to
express all the obligations of
the college in the fairest man-
ner,” Leggett told the 5&3
earlier this week.

Leggett issued the statement
following recent actions by the
deans in three unrelated cases
of student drug involvement.
In those cases, two students
were placed on conduct pro-
bation alter being treated for
adverse reactions to illegal
drugs, and another student
who was allegedly dealing in
mescaline voluntarily withdrew
from the college after consulta-
tion with the deans.

Encouraging students w i t h
drug problems to use the coun-
selling services provided by the
college, Leggett pledged in the
statement that the college will
protect the privacy of students
who seek help,

“They will be given all the
private and confidential help

the college can provide, and
this confidentiality will be re-
spected,” Leggett emphasized.

However, Leggett also said
that the college will take action
“if there is alleged to be Sub-
stantial knowledge that a stu~
dent is using any kind of illegal
drug in the residence halls or
on campus." The statement
outlines the general procedures
the college will follow in deal-
ing with students it suspects of
involvement with illegal drugs.

SEEK MEDICAL All)

Leggett recommended in the
statement that students suffer-
ing from adverse drug reac-
tions be taken directly to the
emergency room of Grinnell
HospitaleeSt and not to the
Health Center, which is made
qualely equipped to handle
such problems,

The president also cautioned

that students should not try to
administer antidotes or rem-
edies oi their own when they
find a fellow student Complains
ing of adverse drug effects.

Warning of the legal hazards
of drug involvement, Leggett
said that the college cannot
protect involved students from
legal consequences if civil
authorities decide to make in<
vestigations on campus.

In an interview last Tuesday,
Leggett expressed c o n c e r it
about Grinneli’s growing drug
problem. “Evidently we have

_ some hardcore users," he said.

“There's no doubt about it

Citing the many difiiculties
involved in handling the drug
problem, Leggett commented,
“The only easy solution is for
students not to use drugs, but
that's no solution because they
do use them,"

 

 

Faculty Discusses Open Meetings;
Eommiiiee Proposes Student Votes

By John Gardner

The faculty in a general meet-
ing last Monday tabled a 4‘
monthsoid proposal for student
participation in faculty meek
ings. in so doing, the faculty
left the matter open for discus-
sion at future meetings

in question at the meeting
were both the wording of the
proposal submitted by the Fa—
culty Organization Committee
and the concept behind it. The
committee, chaired by Profes~
sor Raymond F, Betts, present-
ed its recommendations as the
first overall summary of vary-

Senate Names Dog College Mascot

By ii Siaff Writer

The college that last year pro-
duced the world’s first male
homecoming queen has now
adopted a peacetiik pooch as its
mascot.

“Tory Pioneer," a big,
brown hound owned by student
senator William Stranger, was
appointed by the senate to fill
the Office of Grinnell College
Mascot late Tuesday night.

The senate allotted $15 for the
construction of Tory Pioneer's
dog house, and an additional
$5 to pay [or mascot food.

Tory Pioneer may be the
world's iirst canine pacifist. ACs
cording to the dog's owner, Tory
suffered a broken rear leg last
year when a police car ran into
him at a peace vigil.

Stranger said that ever since
his traumatic runsin with the
law, Tory has dedicated his life
to radical activism

“Tory Pioneer would like to
ilee many reforms made at Grin-

nell," Stranger told the see.
“He wants to have an allspet
coeducational dorm, and he is
very concerned about the ab-
sence of tirehydrarits on cam«
pug”

According to Stranger, the
four-year-old hound is “half Af-
ghan and half wolf, but he inher-
ited the tamer traits of his Af-
ghan mother."

bitch, likes maids, students, and
other breeds of people.

   

year by student Senators Mich-
ael Brandon and Daniel Clleifetz.
Their appearance at a May fa-
culty meeting touched off a de-
bate among the faculty which
was inconcluswe, since it came
at such a late point in the year.

Brandon and Cheiletz's origin-
al proposal was that some stu<
dents be allowed to attend all
faculty meetings, and, if rc-
cognized by the chair, to spealt
at the meetings. At the time, the
proposal was in a very general
form, requesting support of the
principle that students should be
permitted to attend iaculty
meetings, which are now closed
to them. The proposal passed
by an overwhelming voice vote
in the session in which it was
introduced The question then
was reduced to the problem of
deciding how many students
would be allowed to attend the
meetings, and how those stur
dents would be selected.
in the last faculty meeting oi
last year, President Leggett in-
structed the Committee on Fa-
culty Organization to work on a
proposal tor the specincs oi stu-
dent admission to faculty meet-
ings. The report of Mr. Betts‘
meeting, was the response to
Leggeit's instructions.

The recommendations were
that ten student representa-
tives should have the right to
participate in, and vote at, any
regular faculty meeting; that
they would be given one vote
each, and that the ten would
include 9 students elected at-
large, plus the SGA president.
Probably the most controver-
sial mandate was that voting
privileges be given to the stu-
dents, sinea the basin idea
that students would be allowed
to attend faculty meetings. a:

to provide adequate medical
care for these kinds of cases.
Upon admittance ol the student
to the hospital for any reason,
procedures followed will be the
some as they have been for
several years. The hospital will
notify the College at the stu-
dent’s admittance, his doctor'-
name and phone number, and
the reason for admission, To
fulfill its responsibility to stu-
dents and parents or guardians
and to protect itself against
possible lawsuits, the College is
obligated to call the parents of
all students who are hospital-

ized. The parents will be re-
quested to call the doctor di-
rectly tor a medical diagnosis
and report.

(a) If a student or students
come upon one of their class
males who appears to be suf—

actions to a drug, they are ad-

merit, a SAGA SIeep—ln(!),
complete with flicks and food,

many more of your favorite
movie stars will begin the ever

ly scheduled for 9:30, with the

that are expected.

sible, should call a doctor or

(A) in its natural concern for
the well-being of its students,
the College has to make un-
equivocably Clear the legal
hazards of drug involvement.
Any person involved in the
possession, use, or distribution
of drugs, except through legiti-
mate drug channels, is poten-
tially subject to serious pen-
alties under federal, state.
and/or local laws; and any stu-
dent involved in illegal drug
use should be aware that at
any time a person or persons
either within or outside of the
campus community may be—
lieve they have such evidence
and thus report it directly or
indirectly to the Civil authoria
ties. It is neither the intention
nor the business at the College
to decide Whether evidence ol
drug use on campus is legally
actionable by civil authorities.
But if the civil authorities do
decide to make investigations.
the College is then in a position
where it cannot protect in-
volved students from the legal
consequences.

Senate Debates Prof Actions,
Criticizes Health Center

By HENRY SCHEFF

Last Tuesday’s Senate meet-
ing was characterized by long-
windedl debate and few deci-
sions, but several matters were
discussed.

Significant debate revolved
around the Organization Com-
millee’s proposal before the fac-
ulty to allow 10 students, prob-
ably elected at large, to attend
faculty meetings as voting mem-
bers. Senate debate indicated
that there was considerable op-
position to the Committee’s plan,
but a motion asking the Senate
to go on record against the mo-
tion was tabled.

Former SGA President Tom
Thomas asserted that 10 Stu-
dents would make a decisive
difference in only two or three
faculty votes a year, and that
implementation of the proposal
would be male tokenism.
Thomas also cited the difficulty
in finding 10 representative stu-
dents to attend faculty meet-
lugs.

Senator Andrew Loelvl said
that the proposal was side-
stepping a more important issue,
that Of the right of all students
to attend faculty meetings.

Senator William Stranger con-
jeetured that the proposal, it
passed, would weaken the pow-
er of the laculty vis-a-vis the
administration and the trustees.
Stranger asserted that close
votes in faculty meetings might
be Viewed as decisions deter—
mined by the in voting students,
and thus would not he given the
same weight as iacultydomi-
nated decisions. A Senate reso-
lution on the matter or student
participation at iaculty meet
ings will be discussed at next
week’s senate meeting.

In other actions, Senator An-
drew Brill expressed dissatisfae

tion with service at the Health
Center and a three-man com-
mittee was set up to investigat'
the situation and to talk to Mrs.
Irma M. Hall, Administrative
Supervisor of the Health Ser-
vice, the administration, and
other appropriate persons. Com-
mittee members are Senators
Brill, Stranger, and William
Thomas.

Student Coordinator Franlt‘
Thomas announced \ that the
position of Social (bordnator is
unoccupied, following the resig»
nation of senior Lee Shamberg.
Studentsrinterested in applying
tor the position should contact
Frank Thomas or SGA President
James Lew.

In other Senate activity,
Brill outlined the policy for
this year‘s initiative fund.
Because individual residence
halls received smaller allot<
merits than in the past, the ini-
tiative funds will he more avail-
able for hall social events this
year. Brill said that while in
previous years some 65 per
cent of the amount of
money requested was allotted,
this year the initiative Fund
Committee will try to allot 85

and the wording oi the proposal

One outstanding objection,
voiced later in an interview with
Prolessor John R. Kleinschmidt,
chairman oi the iaculty, is that
to allow student mg would

scltmidt Said, “a public meeting

Wall commented that another

objection voiced by some ia-
cuity members was that the
two parts—faculty and students
#maklng up the “new” iaculty

dents to lacuity would be 1 to 12.

The Bells committee stood on
the other Side, firmly behind
the idea ol students expressing
student viewpoints in a body di—
rectly concerned with their
courses and daily routines. On
the committee, besides Belts,
are Professor Kenneth A, Chris-
tianson (Bio.),'Associate Pro—
fessor Eugene A, Harman
(Mathematics), Associate Pm<
lessor Karl DeLorig (Bio,), and
Asst. Protessot‘ Neal A. Milner
(Political Science).

in the course oi the debate,
an amendment came up to de-
lete the se ion on voting, and
both the original motion and the
amendment were totally tabled
following a motion by win Klein-
schmidt; the debate was
terminated.

In an interview with an 5&3
reporter on Tuesday, Klein-
schmidt responded to questions
about students in iaculty meet-
ings. One question was what
kinds of restrictions he sees as
necessary (or attendance. His
answer:

”Suppose someone, some pro-
iessor proposes a plan which is
popular, catches on ~ it gets out
as an idea — an outside group
runs with that ball, and expecta-

tions arise among the student:
mat certain things are going to
happen. 1! it's not. approved in
the long run, there will he re-
sentment, protest, a feeling or
‘why not?’. At best, that kind or
protest creates a divisiveness
that is not necessary," Klein-
schmidt also commented upon
an incident at Harvard Univer-
sity several years ago when the
lacuity there passed a rule
against publicizing any decision
until it was acted upon.

“I don‘t advocate this," Klein-
schmidt said, “but. I can see a
certain sense in reducing pre-
mature expectations and reac-
tions to things that have not
been worked out iully.”

Does Kleinschmidt see any
parallels between the current
controversy at Grinnell and
those occurring at other
schools? He told the 5&3:

“There has been a great deal
OT discussion and action in col-
leges and universities here and
in Canada, for example, to pro«
vide mechanisms such as stu-
dents on the boards of trustees.
it may be. on both sides, some-
thing or riding a popular idea,
a lad. . , .Although i think the
iaculty here could live with stu-
dents attending its meetings. I
personally can't get my mind
around to the proposal or a
student vote. This makes it an
entirely different ball-game."

Dean Wall expects that this
student, attendance proposal
might come up tor raculty dis-
cussion several times before it
is ultimately acted upon. He
said, ”It’s all up in the air now,
because the (acuity tabled it —
it will no doubt come up at the
October 6 meeting (the next
one)."

which he said students should
"find political contests and is-
sues that exist in the commu-
nity, When an issue is raised,
they ought to get involved,"

The black legislator also com-
mented on the Black Panthers.
“They are leading in the politi-
calization ut black people,"
Bond asserted. "They are mov-
ing toward an economic analy—
sis rather than just a political
analysis or the problems.”

"To build another party in
this Country, I think you would
have to do it over a period or
years," Bond told the press.

Looking towards the future,
he is “more optimistic about
the political future of black
people than about their ecu<
nomic future. I see black
people taking power in their
communities."

This theme was echoed in his
address when he told the audia
ence that southern blacks have
“begun to organize political and
economic g r o u p s responsive
and responsible to themselves
and themselves alone.”

Bond was highly critical of
the Nixon welfare proposals.
He said the answer would be
tor “the lederal government to
take over all welfare.“ Com-
menting on Daniel Moynihan's
projection that even if the
Vietnam war were ended, there
would be no additional iunds
tor domestic problems, sond
said it was as though America
was now “spending inr war
while the nation looks for new
worlds to conquer."

When asked about the con-

spiracy trials scheduled to be-
gin in Chicago on September
24th, Bond said they were “po-
litical trials or people the gov-
ernment wants to crush.”

“it people are interested in
expressing their toelings that
people should be able to dem-
onstrate and speak treely, per-
haps they should go to Chi-
cago." (Demonstrations are
planned during the trial.)

Concluding his speech, Band
told the predominantly white
audience, “the choice is, after
all, yours. It has never been
ours.”

AWARE Outlines Activities for Second Year

An organization created to
work with racial attitudes on
the local level, the Association
of Whites for the Advancement
oi Racial Equality (AWARE),
held its ﬁrst meeting at the
year on Sunday, September 14,
in the South Lounge. Some 40
students gathered to discuss the
problems involved in educating
the college and town toward
racial awareness. In its efforts
to reach the town, AWARE
last year initiated I study-
group, town-college movies,
and on extensive bibliography
ot race-relations hooks drawn

This year, says senior Karen
Frank, an AWARE organizer,
most of the procedures and
methods of the organization will

The Student Coordinator’s Of-

Karen Frank said there may

Faculty Proposal “twist

The {aculty is presently considering n recommendation by its
Organization Committee that would allow ten ”representative"
students to vote at faculty meetings, which are presently closed
to students. Implementation of the Committee’s plan would be un-
WiSe tor the faculty and inimical to the student position

Allowing ten students to vote would be no more than a gesture
ot_tokenism that would subvert the Students’ role in College de~
cision-making. Ten student votes, even ii cast together, would
rarely decide an issue beiore the faculty

Establishing a student voting privilege would endanger the
concept oi a “iaculty decision." The College’s “wider constituen-
Cy” could easily disregard faculty opinion as being too heavily
shaped by the student voters.

Aside irom the obvious diificulty oi iinding ten tnily repre
sentative students, permitting Selected students to Vote Wollld
possibly discourage iaculty members from seeking the opinions
of other students. ,

The proposal seems to assume a mythical “harmony of in-
terests and direction,” a notion that was popular in college gov-
ernance several years ago. In reality, the interests oi students,
faculty, and administrators are divergent at several points. A
student point of view could be more clearly and equitably articu-
lated if it were tormulated as such and then presented to the ap-
propriate hody, rather than falling to the province of ten small
voices.

The compromise or the student position inherent in the present
proposal is readily apparent. Appeasement is not the issue; par-
ticipation is not synonymous with power. Student dissidence
could too easily be dismissed with the argument, “You had a
vote." it must be realized that a token voting privilege for stue
dents would actually be antithetical to positive political Conse«
quence.

There are other options that the faculty must Consider. A tar
more satisiactory proposal would be as follows:

1.) All students should have the right to attend faculty meet-
lngs.

2.) The student senate should have the permanent privilege to
speak and to present motions at facility meetings, but not to vote.

3.) Other students should he allowed to speak and present
motions at the discretion of the faculty’s preSIding officerl

There may be a time when many college decisions can be
made under the tenets oi participatory democracy with students,
faculty and administrators working together. That time will not
come until all parties can be truly and equitably represented.
Until that time, permitting a iew students to vote at faculty meet-
ings is of no help. The faculty should defeat the Betts' committee
recommendation and take immediate steps to open faculty meet-
ings to all students and to grant them limited speaking privileges.

Former Griiiiiell Prof Charges
Discrimination of Local Hotel

By Henry Schett

Last summer a Farmer pro-
lessor at Grinnell alleged that
he was discriminated against
at a local hotel. On Tuesday,
August 12, Mr. John \Villis, a
former instructor in Anthropol-
ogy at the college, filed a com-
plaint with Mrs. C. Edwin G
mour of the Iowa State Ada
visory Committee to the us.
Commission on Civil Rights. in
the complaint he alleged that
Mrs. Ann l-loyer, Manager of
the Park Hotel. Elﬁ Broad St.
refused to rent him a room on
the previous night because of
his race. Willis is black.

According to Willis' com-
plaint. Mrs. Hoyer had accepted
a telephone reservation, but
had no room available when he
arrived at the hotel. Willis said
that he was told the room had
already been “rented". His
complaint stated in part: ”I
iind it hard to believe that this
room could be rented within the
period that had elapsed be.
tween the time I called and
when I appeared. r d It is
my opinion that the manager
or lady I dealt With was re-
tusing me rental of the hotel
room because of race"

Willis was in Grinnell that
Monday to pack up the last or

his belongings before leaving
ior Kalamazoo, M i c h i g a n.
where he has accepted an as
sistant prolessorship in anthro—
pology at Western Michigan
University. l-le was visiting two
friends, Mr, and Mrs. Tom Mat<
tailscli of Grinnell. Willis had
planned to leave Grinnell that
eveningpbut when it became
apparent that he had more to
do than he had anticipated, he
decided to spend the night in
town

He called the Park Hotel at
approximately 10:50 p.m. and
made a reservation, saying he
would arrive in 15 minutes. He
was late, arriving at the Hotel
at 11:30.

Mrs. Hoyer said later, “He
called me and asked for a room
and he said he would be here
in ﬁfteen minutes. But it was
a lot longer than that, sn l
rented the room before he
came."

Mrs. Hoyer denied that she
was discriminatory “I have
rented to colored people in the
past and surely will in the tu—
ture ii there are rooms avail<
able," she was quoted in the
Grinnell Herald-Register.

Max“theFIyingGrandpa” Conrad Visits Grinnell

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

Still ﬂying high at a craity
67, veteran pilot Max Conrad
touched down briefly in Grinnell
last Monday to tell the story
of his attempt last winter to
circle the globe using a new
route—ilying over the North and
South polesr

Conrad, better known as "the
Flying Grandfather," holds sev-
eral light-craft aviation records,
and he has saloed across the
Atlantic Ocean more than 140
times

Ever since he learned to fly
after leaving college, Conrad
has made his living through his
love of ﬂying. For several years
be operated a ierry service that
delivered planes manufactured
in the us. to Europe, and lie
thus accumulated many of the

transatlantic flights on his re-
Cord,

Conrad made his ﬁrst record-
breaking flight in 1959 when he
ﬂew non-stop from Casablanca

to Los Angeles, a 7,683mile trip
that kept him high (in the air)
ior so hours, as minutes. That
night broke all previous distance
records tor light planes.

Looking young despite his
white crew cut and tanned
weather-beaten skin, the tall,
transplanted - Mlnnesotan spoke
to some 100 persons at the Vet-
erans Memorial Center Monday
during a program sponsored by
the Grinnell Airport Promotion
Committee.

Conrad began his talk describ—
ing the planning that led to his
iirst attempt at the polar ilight.
Although the trip was unsuccess—
tul, (he only made it half way«
from St. Louis to the North Pole
to Africa to the South Pole,
where he ran into engine trou—
ble), the slides he took while
aloft provided exciting illustra-
tions for his traveloguelike nar-
ration about the completed leg of
his journey. His casual delivery
held the attention of the audi»
ence for more than two hours as
he told about his adventures.
surprises, and memories of the
polar flight.

Undaunted by failure, Conrad
has committed himself to try-
ing the polar ilight again. He
is determined to be the ilrst
man to pilot a light cratt around
the world, over the poles.

“After all," he explained,
‘‘who could I live with if I
couldn’t live with myself? That
would be the Case if I didn’t
give it another chance."

This time, the Flying Grand-

father is going to take oil from

his Winona, Minn, birthplace on
November 30, in a “reverse di-
rection," heading south ﬁrst,
rather than north like he did
last time.

Although he has spent much
of his lite soaring around the
World, Conrad somehow found
the time to help raise [en Chile
dren. He acquired his nickname
twelve years ago when his ﬁrst
grandchild was born.

Before he was dubbed “the
Flying Grandfather.” Conrad
was known to many as “the Fly-
ing Songwriter,” because he
habitually composed songs dur-
ing his long, lonely hours aloit.
Several years ago he produced
an album featuring some of his
many songs to help finance his
[light around the world attempt.
(This time, he plans to sell 12
thousand postcards, which he
will mail to die purchasers when
he teaches the South Pole.)

Recognizing that he isn't the
only flying grandiather around
(Federal Aviation Agency sta-
tistics list some 150 thousand in
the us.) Conrad is now ionning
an exclusive club called “Flying
Crandiathers Unlimited,” whose
home base will be at Max Con-
rad Field in Winona, Conrad
says he has already received
numerous checks paying for $100
charter memberships, despite-
the iact that the club isn't even
organized yet.

Before ilying out of Grinnell,
Max Conrad explained that the
“adventure and personal chal—
lenge" his kind at ilying otters
is preferable to the “comic“;-
able, protitable, but boring" life
or a commercial airline pilot.

”Besides,” the Flying Grand-
father pointcd out, “commercval
pilots are done flying at age 60."

For Saturday concert

Tomorrow at 9 o’clock in the

as a one-man hand during the

played music for more than a
halfrcenturty.

Fuller simultaneously plays a

pearances by blues greats T-
bone Walker and Oils Spann),
The night before his Grinnell
appearance, he gave a concert
In St. Louis; the night after
his Grimell concert he did a
gig in Chicago. in other words,
Grinnell was not exactly the
highlight of his itinerary # but
you couldn’t have told that

King's performance was a
triumph from the moment he
walked on stage; in fact, he
received a standing ovation
just for appearing, and it was
uphill from there. When he
picked up his guitar, Lucille,
and started playing “Everyday

two hours.

oi couise, it was B. B. who
knocked everyone out, with
his singing, his guitar playing,
and his amazing ability to com

rock freak friend of mine said
to me the next day, “it's in<
credible . . .he actually talks

best guitarist in the world] He

he does.

Almost as amazing as his
performance was the fact that,
after the concert, he sat around
for over an hour rapping casu-
ally for n KDIC interview.
There's no telling how long he
would have talked if we hadn't
all been asked to leave Darby

Civil Rights Commission acted
upon the complaint, and iound
the situation suspicious enough
to warrant precautions against
possible occurrences of discrim-
ination. Mrs. Hoyer signed an
agreement pledging to accept
non-white applicants for rooms
in her hntel. She also agreed to
report the names of all non<
white registrants at her hotel
once a month for a period of
six months.

Mrs. Hoyer said, “I was told
that ! have to report the names
of all nun-whites who register
at the hotel. It the rooms are
tilled, I’m supposed to obtain
names and inform the com—
mission of the circumstances.”

She said that the slimmer
season is a busy one for her
and that it is hotel policy to
rent out rooms which have not
been claimed on time. The
room in question was, she said,
the only one available.

There is no absolute proof
that Willis’s rights were vio-
lated, but there were a num
ber of suspicious occurrences
that evening. After Willis was
refused a room at the hotel,
he went back to the Mattausch’s
and told them his impressions
Then, according to Mr. Mat-
tnusch's report to the commis-
sion, Mrs. Mattausch called the
hotel and asked for a reserva-
tion for herself and her hus-
band. Mrs. Hoyer, perhaps
suspicious atter the incident,
told her that she didn’t accept
telephone reservations, but to
come down ti) the hotel since
there could .be a cancellation.

Mrs. Hoyer denied that she
ever said this. Mattausch’s re-
port iurther states that he and
his Wife went down to the
hotel and asked for a mom for
himself and his wife. Mrs.
Hoyer questioned the Mat-
tauschs, asking who the room
was for, where were they
irom, why so late, etc. The
Mattausclis said they were
somewhat intimidated by Mrs.
Hoyer, and that they were ti-
nally intormed that there were
no rooms available. Mrs. Hoyer
alsﬂ denies this. She said that
she didn't question anyone and
simply had no rooms. She
called the entire incident a
"misunderstanding".

denied that she was discrimina-

While the {acts in the case
are somewhat unclear since
there is no way to prove that

tel, the Willis incident is per-
haps typical of the type or dis-
crimination that has existed in
Grinnell tor as long as there
have been black students and
professors at the college. Re-
cent incidents of discrimination
in Grinnell have been more
covert than incidents that OC-
curred several years ago, but

"This year it’s been one long

social committees are rather
self-sufficient this year. and that
the chairman doesn’t have much

When asked whether pressure
