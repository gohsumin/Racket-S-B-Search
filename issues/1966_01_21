No Immediate Decision

It will be the end of Febl‘ual _.
at the earliest—belore a ﬁnal de-
cision is reached on revisions in
the housing system on North Cam-
pus. This according to Gl’innell’s
president Glenn Leggett.

was the indication Leggett gave of
what the change might entail, He
also said that he was “just think-
ing aloud" when he spoke in these
terms and that this was not final.
’The procedure to be tollowed in
making the decision, according to
Leggeti, would be to have the Ex-
ecutive Council make recom-
mendations to Leggctr from the
opinions they have gathered. Leg<
gett then will cooler with the
deans and student leaders and pro
sent a “White Paper" at the end
at February.

Leggett indicated that the
changes will probably go into ei-
fect next fall.

The changes Leggett wants in
the housing system should, in his
words, make the system more
“flexible" than it is now and be
“loose enough so that it's exper-
imental."

Administration and faculty
members also tend to be dissatis-
fied with rule eillorccment on
North Campus by the elected oi-
iicials. This prompted Leggett to
say that proposals {or senior ad-
visurs or preceptors appointed by
the administration would be con-
sidered along witll other changes
in the housing rules.

Desire for, greater efficiency.
uniformity, and respect [or SGA
was voiced Wednesday night dur-
ing a Student Senate discussion or
proposed student government re-
organization which would, among
other things, abolish the body
which gave life to the changes.

As reported by SGA President
I e rry Goddard, the Executive
Cabinet of the SGA feels that hav-
ing the Cam? and AWS Serve as
combined executive, legislative,
and perhaps judicial branch oi SGA
would eliminate the inefﬁciency
in maintaining three separate
branches.

The proposed System, according
to Senator Rick Heilbron, would
draw more respect from the col-
lege administration by the ensuing
uniformity between the rules and
their eniorcement.

Senator Robert Barrow ques-
tioned the supposition oi unilorm

 

 

entorcement by Claiming that
house presidents would he likely
to ignore unpopular rules, no mat-
ter which body iorinulated them.

Senator Jane Stracke agreed
that the proposed system would be
more cliicient, but she added. “Dic-
tatorships are efficient, too."

After opposition arose to the
elimination of the two student pri-
mary courts under the proposed
changes Goddard took time to ex-
plain that the proposal was made
because he “feels the student
court system should begin to act
more on the order of a committee
than a legal body” This, he said,
would be accomplished by having
the house presidents rather than
"magistrates” handle misconduct
cases.

More objection was raised to the
court changes, and Goddard av
greed to add some sort or pri«
moi-y court system .when iormal
proposals tor son reor - '

proposals will be in the form of

Senator Dan Bucks took the
floor to criticize the Senate as it
artists He said, “Generally, the

nough so that it okays policies de-
cided on beforehand by the E»
ecutive Cabinet, the COIHP, or the
AWS Board. Otherwise, it has been
little else than a legislative nui-
sance.”

Bucks said that he felt the Sen-
ate, it retained, could play its big-
gest role in the area of service
rather than in policy decisions,

Senator Dick Chady took a jab
at the proposals by questioning

Leggett said he was "very

approved, “What we want to do
is make all of our resources avail-
able tu Grinnell students. We want
to make sure that a science major
will not feel that he is hurting his

A student may not elect to talio

after his final registration for the
course. He may, however, change

deadline for adding courses. ‘

Grades received for courses tak-

ignated “credit” ,or “fail”. A
grade of “Credit" will not be in-

Pass-Fail Examined

Well, it’s not the first “pass~fail" grading system
west of the Mississippi and, while it represents a step

in the right direction, there are several points which
must be considered.

The system the faculty adpoted (they insist on
calling it “credit-fail") is a half-way sort of thing. In
this case, half-way may be worse than nothing at all,
The intention of the system, as stated by chairman of
the faculty Kenyon Knopf, is to encourage students to
reduce the "emphasis on particular grades.” The effect
of this compromise pass-fail system will more than
likely be sloppy, half-way work in the course elected
for pass-fail. Under the current system — grades in all
courses — the motivation for grades is equal in all
classes. Under a total “pass-fail" system the motiva-
tion resulting from grades is equal in all courses. Under
Grinnell’s hesitant step toward “pass-fail," the motiva-
tion is unequal. Why work toward a “C” level of
achievement in a graded course and a passfail course
when there’s the possibility of working more in the
graded course and getting a “B" and working less in

the pass~fai1 course and getting the same mark,

“credit”? The example, obviously, is exaggerated It
does, however, present the case.

The fault with the case stated above is that the stu-
dents may well be mature and self-disciplined enough
to work in their pass-fail course for the sheer sake of
knowledge, They may well resist the temptation to use
the paSS<fail system to lighten their work load and do
just what the faculty and administration is against,

' fight for grades for grades’ sake.

I think it’s curious that the faculty and administra-
tion seem to have this attitude about the students of
Grinnell. I find it curious in light of their attitude to-
ward the student’s maturity and self-discipline with
regard to their non~academic life (we might stretch a
point and call it their social life). I’m referring, of
course, to the so-called North Campus problem.

It’s the feeling on the part of the administration
and faculty that the “style of life" on North Campus is
not conducive to study, They offer solutions which in-
clude replacing student»elected enforcement officers
with administration~appointed "senior advisers” or
“preceptors.” They suggest isolating freshman from the
“corrupting” influence of upperclassmen. These solu-
tions all indicate that the faculty and administration
have the lowest regard for the maturity and self—disci-
pline of students when it comes to regulating their “out
of class affairs.”

It is this uncertain view the administration and
faculty have of students that concerns me They seem
to view us“ on the one hand as responsible and on the
other irresponsible. It seems unlikely to me that a stu—
dent responsible enough to use the "pass-fail” system
with integrity would be guilty of the gross irresponsi-
bility that faculty and administration fee] exists in his
social life.

I think that before the faculty and administration
go further with their reforms they ought to form some
concrete, coherent, and consistent View of the student
bOdy.

Jenks’ Journal

I have been accused ol’ overwriting. Overwriling
I take to mean a disparity between the level of dis-
course and the subject matter. My only problem is
that I‘ve been trying to drive Cadillacs through corn-
fields,

In this. my filth entry, 1 am going to write about
a subject that most dearly affects the minds and
hearts of even the most insensitive among us, a sub-
ject more grave than genius, war, or selllessness.
Humble though it may seem, it is a precursor in
the most overwhelming and implacable immensiues
of the universe that emerge from the hidden anony-
mities of external and impossible objective existence.
A hard and brutal fact that brings grief and sorrow.
in the utmost privacy, to each one of us. and through
whatever machinations we may attempt to conceal
our woes from our heartless fellows, however we
might attempt to contort the natural but dark in-
clinslions of our faces, it pierces and is ever-present
and uncontrollable, a tragedy that strikes daily with-
in our midst, known to all but unknown to any.

Morning breaks intrusively and unconditionally,
and we are lorn by the eternal and nameless forces
of the cosmos to rise, to encounter of our own in-
ternal resources and blind necessity and incessant
blows of consciousness, or to remain in the wet.
warm and maternal unconsciousness where fancies
and vain imagining: sport and play upon the table
of our minds_ that abstract field of pathos and de-
sire. Here we are unborn and immersed in utter sat-
isfaction, there we are cold and defenseless against
the ruthless insults of infinite nature. But the shriek-
ing and mechanical bursts that eminate from the
most heinous of man’s devices, the alarm clock,
hastens to the extreme of mortal shock our re-
sponse to the necessity of decision. As it moved by
the sell-same electricity that charges with motion
the planets themselves, those heavenly and myster-
ious Christmas tree ornaments, we leap with a
force that in a space of time immeasurable by (he
most precise of instruments sternly dictates our as-
cent to the pristine level of the ceiling, upon which,
in great consternation and belligerence against the
malevolent powers to which man is servant, we
bump our heads, Ripped from the intensely soft and
silky hands of sleep! Desperately we grape and fur-
age through the vast wasteland of our undigniﬁed
and degraded language, crying for a curse that has
clung to meaning, one appropriate to these most
dire of circumstances. But none, alas. is to be found.
The ages have worn away the razor edge of meaning,
leaving only the most blunt and ineffective, archaic
and dim reminder of those subterranean chamber]

that once struck the most profound oi terrors into
the hearts of sinful men: “Dammit."

But the harsh realities. low temperature and in-
tense light, of our insurmountable monotony of walls,
the unsympathetic geometries of human artifacts
and edifices, burgeun and iorlily our power lo en-
dure, yea. even willfully encounter, with a noble and
rebellious spirit, zhe tasks and ceremonies of living,
that sublime and cosmic dance upon the brow of an
Omnipotent and omnipresent W. C. Fields. We are
simple men, doleful humankind, paradoxes of bestial
and angelic, carrying within us the tension that is
the source of all fruition and of death, of rebirth and
even of love. oh love! oh God! From whence comes
this unkind necessity? We get up. We scratch our
armpits.

But the terror and harrowing footlalls of our
nightly voyage have infected our mouths and indeed.
our viscera. the stronghold of our passions and most
intimate of satisfactions, with various and sundry
poisons. Our tongues, arbiter: of rumor and truth,
undying flames of wickedness and righteousness.

ments of modern technology, Crest toothpaste, purges
us of the potential corruption, the tarnished smile
and repulsive breath, that the evils of the night

to those tasks too intimate to mention, too satisfy-
ing for description. Thus prepared, we set out into
the day 4

But the greatest sorrows, the subject of my entry.
lay ahead. In the unioreseeable and unfathomable
distance that separates the present from the future
in perfldious time and unconquerable space, waits a
death more to be feared than death itself. A priva-
uon and disappointment that daily challenges the ell-
pectancy of the most noble heart. Passing apprehen-
sively through the unrecognizable and unlormed
faces of earlysmorning humanity, we move unalter-
ably, obsessed by a single goal. At that goal lies
the significance or an entire universe outside of our
own, one which nourishes our hopes and dreams,
fulfills our need for love and our craving for identity.
As we move closer we silently pray for a bountiful
outcome. Then, reinforcing our entire being against
the likelihood of profound disappointment. we face
the bleak but unquenchable truth: an empty mail-
box, 0h heavens] What great sorrows we endure!

‘Fitth Year' Student Describes
A ‘Typical Day' at Ahmednagar

By DONALD BOGUE

Edi Note: Donald nogue is l
Travel-Service Scholar spend-
lng his ‘Fifth Year Abroad!

As many of you probably already
know, Ahmednagar College is an
Indian college which is located
about 150 miles inland from Bom-
hay and has a student body of
about 2500, The connections be
tween this college and Grinneli
are quite close, since for the last
tour or five years, Grinnell grad-
uates have had the opportunity [0
come to this college and work for
a year. This year not only i. but
also Professor Wayne Denny (phy-
sics) and his wife are spending a
year here,

For the last week or so, I have
been debating as to what the best
method oi telling you what lndia
is like or at least giving you an
idea of what I am doing here at
Ahmednagar. Maybe the best
method would be to give you a
run-down on how i spend a day
here at this college. Take today,
Saturday, November 27th, for in-
stance. ln one way, Saturdays are
unusual days for me, because ev—
ery Saturday at 7:30 arm, I be-
come a professor for one hour and
a half and conduct a Class for
the senior psychology students. I
teach an experimental psychology
practical (laboratory). During the
year the students are supposed to
learn how to do twenty-rive ex-
periments so that they can per-
fan-n them Well on their final elk
aminations next March. 50 after
a quick breakfast in my room, I
went oil to class to try to teach
my fifteen psychology students
how to do an experiment which
tests a person's manual dexterity.
i always have a little trouble com-
municating my ideas to these stu-
dents. They don’t know English
very well, and l imow very little
Marathi. HOWBVBI‘. after listening
to me talk to them in English
and then talking among them-
selves in Marathi, the students us-
ually figur- out fairly well how to

 

do the experiments and how to
write them up afterwards. Today’l
lesson wasn’t too difficult to ex-
plain, so i think the students um
dersmnd it fairly well.

After my class was over, i went
over to the iaculty tea, which
takes place every morning at I
a.rn. Tea is the most important
drink around here, and every good
Indian stops work in the middl'
oi the morning and in the middle
of the afternoon in order to hav.
a cup of tea loaded with milk land
sugar (just like the American coi-
lee break),

After tea I went back to my
room to bone-up on a little Maia
athi (the language oi this region)‘
were my lesson in this language
at if a.m. A student is now leaclr
ing nie Marathi tor a short period
each day, so i have succeeded in
learning a few words and phrases.
Marathi is fairly difficult because
the script and some or the sound-
are very diiterent than English, but
it is worth the effort in he abln
to carry on simple conversation!
with the students and the sen-
vants.

At 11:30 one ot my trienao

interested in religion, so I decided

Credit-Fail Explained

The iollowing proposal on the credit-tail system was approved
in a meeting at the general raculty Monday attemoon:

“Beginning with the 1956—67 academic year, students classi-
ﬁed as sophomores, juniors, or seniors may elect to receive a
credit-fail grade rather than a letter grade in one of their
courses in each semester, subject to the following regulations:

“1. in a course elected for grading on the credit-tail basis the
student’s grade shall be designated “credit” or “fail". A grade
Di “credit" shall not be included in the student‘s semester or cumu-
lative grade-point average; a grade oi “fail” shall be included
at our grade points per credit.

“2. No course elected for grading on the credit-fail basis shall
satisty any part or a general requirement for graduation. The stu-
dent must meet the general requirements by courses graded on
the letter basis.

“3. No course in the student’s major iield shall be elecled for
grading on the credit~iail basis. Any course elected ior such grad-
ing prior to the student’s declaration of his major shall not count
inward the minimum credit requirement for the major. In case of
a student's inability to meet the minimum credit requirement for
his major, the major department and the Dean or the College may
waive this regulation

“4. The student shall not elect the credit-fail basis Di grading
alter his tinal registration tor a course. However, he may change
his election to the letter basis or grading at any time prior to the
deadline for adding courses.

“5. The Registrar shall indicate on the class rolls those stun
dents who have elected the credit-tail hasis of grading. instructors
shall report to the Registrar only a grade or “credit" or “fail", and
this grade shall appear as such on the student’s transcript."

Fill-ll'Year Abroad Deodline’Near:
Ollers Service. Travel Possibility

The deadline tor application for
a TravelSer-vice Scholarship for a
“Fifth Year Abroad" in 1966-67 is
January 25.

Each year crinnell sends grad-
uates to teach and help in extra-
curricular actiVlties at colleges or
high schools in underdeveloped
countries. The Travel - Service
Scholarships are a recent out-
growth oi the old Grinnellrianhina
program. Aiter a small start in
1959, the number oi scholars has
expanded irom one to as many
as eight in 1962, The school would
like to send three abroad lol' the
academic year 1966-67.

The form of service has been
wide. Grinnell graduates have
taught, either in their major field
or English, have directed musical
groups, coached a sport, worked
in the extracurricular lite oi the
host institution or have served as
a resident director or “counselor”
in a dormitory

Glinneiiians in the program
have lived in Brazil, Ceylon, Chile,
Columha, Greece, India. Liberia,
Nyasaland, Tanganykia, Thailand
and Turkey. India, Thailand and
Latin America are the areas be-
ing considered for 1966—67. The
preference of a particular student
selected will be Considered but it
may be impossible to send him
or her to that country.

While abroad the student selves
as a correspondent for the 5&3
(see stories in this issue on Co-

 

 

lumbia and lndia). Upon his or
her return to this country the stu-
dent may be asked to return to
Grinnell tor a short time to share
experiences with ci-innell stu-
dents.

To apply, a student must suh-
mit a two or three page paper in-
dicating why the student wishes to
spend a year abroad and what it is
the student has to crier in the way
at services. lnlormation regarding
experience in camping, project
work, hobbies, etc, should also be
included. A student should ask his
major adviser and two other pro-
iessors for recommendations.

The scholarship provides for the
roulld trip transportation from
Grinnell, or the student's home,
to the receiving college, computed
at tourist rate. In addition, $250

is granted to cover such items as
passports, visas, baggage, insur-
ance, and expenses en route. The
host institution provides free room
and board during the academic
year and usually a small amount
for "pocket money." Each scho-
lar must agree to raise an addi-
tional $250 on his own prior to
the date of departure to ensure
the coverage or incidental expens-
es and possible emergencies. Ad—
ditionai travel and purchase of
foreign handicrafts has lead pest
scholars to estimate that they
spent $500 of their own money.

College Forum Gains Recognition
For Modern Architectural Design

The Forum, beginning its second
year as social center and common
haven for Grinnell students, has
ﬁnally been recognized by the out—
side world~tor its modern archi<
tectural design,

In December our newest build
ing on campus was cited in fear
ture stories in two magazines. An
article acclaiming our Forum as
"College Building of the Month"
appeared in "College and Univer-
Iity Business.” In the story, guest

writer Merritt C. Ludwig, vice
president at Grinnell, describes
the special designing of the build-
ing. l-le comments that the Forum
is like other college unions in its
design as the hllb of student re<
creation and social life,”. . .but
with the emphasis an informal ac-
tivity as opposed to elaborate
planning.”

”Progressive Architecture," a
monthly magazine, also published
a story about the Grinnell Forum.

t Eais Lunch With Dennys

(Continued from Page 3)

Guest House. where the Dennys
are staying. and eat lunch with
them. By eating with them, i am
able to get somewhat better iood
than I would be getting in the local
canteens, pllis the fact that there
is a lot less chance of me getting
sick.

After lunch I came back to my
room for a short rest and a look
at my new TIME magazine, which
comes every Saturday. TIME
might not be the greatest maga-
zine in the world, but I read it
from cover to cover every week,
because it is the only written
news I have that tells me about
what is taking place in America,

' besides the iniormation sent [a me
every once in a while by the
United States Information Service.
I am able to listen to radio broad-
casts from Voice of America and
the British Broadcasting System,
as well as English language
broadcasts from India, Pakistan,
and China on a radio the college
has loaned me, so I do have other
sources of news. I also get an
lndian newspaper, which tells me
what is happening in India, but
not much about the rest: of the
world.

At about 3 pm i got up and
started to wash my clothes. One
either sends his clothes to laun-
drymen (dhohis), who beat the
clothes against rocks or cement
beside a waterhole to get them
clean, or does them himself with
the use of buckets of cold water
and detergent. I use the latter
method for most of my clothes.
However, I do usually send my
shirts and trousers to the dhobi,
because he does iron them after
he finishes beating them against
the rocks.

 

After doing the laundry, I de-
cided to straighten up my room a
little bit. Since I live right next to
the college hostels (dormitories),
I do have various college servants
that come to my room each day
to do various cleaning jobs. One
cleans the bathroom every day;
another sweeps the floor about
every third day; still another one
brings me good drinking water.
makes my bed, and shines my
shoes. However, there are certain
other jobs, like dusting the furni-
ture and straightening up my
books, which must be done by me
or they don’t get done at all. This
means that most of the time they
don’t get done at all. but once in
a while I do get around to doing
these tasks.

At 4:30 this Saturday afternoon
a Catholic priest was scheduled to
talk to the college Student Christa
ian Movement. The SCM is made
up of all the Christian Protestant
students that go to school here
and is quite active, at least com-
pared to any similar groups at
Gl‘innell, Since I am an adviser
to this group, at about 4:25 I took
the bicycle the college has loaned
to me and pedalleti over to the
college’s beautiful new chapel.
When 1 arrived, the guest speak-
er was there, but not a student
was in sight. However, there was
no reason to panic, for such things
otten happen around here. Even in
my psychology class, which is sup-
posed to start at 7:30, I am never
able to start until 7:40 or even
later because the students don’t
arrive until then. After about It)
minutes to 5:00, torty or so students
had arrived, so We were able to
start the priest's talk.

easy job with some of the stu-
dents, but with others I have to
work quite hard and often never
really do succeed.

After spending about half an
hour with these students, I was
free to go back to room, talk to
some of the students informally,
and listen to the radio. A little
later, I went over to the Guest
House for my evening meal. After
my meal I walked over to the
middle of campus to watch an old
Gary Cooper movie which was be—
ing shown outside to the college
students, Marathi, Hindi, or Eng-
lish movies are shown on many
weekends during the year.

When the movie was over, I
went back to my room, recruited
some of the members of the hostel
English Society, and they and I
hustled over to the auditorium
and stage where we worked on a
couple of skits that were going to
be put on for Hostel Day on De-
cember 4th. The English Society is
a group of boys who are trying to
learn how to speak and think in
English better. Some of them
know English quite Well; others
have trouble expressing themsel-
ves in simple sentences. They
used to meet with me two or
three nights a week to hold dis—
cussions and give talks in Eng-
lish. Now we are working togeth-
er in order to ﬁgure out: how to
put on some skits for the rest of
the boys in the hostel.

After a short practice, we all
walked downtown to one of the
restaurants there so that we could
have some lunch. India has a great
variety of sweet and spicy snacks.
Although a few are a little too
spicy tor the Western tongue, most
of them are Very delicious. TD-
night I had some "gulab jambu“,
which are little egg-shaped wheat
cakes drenched in sugary syrup. or
course, as usual, a cup of tea an
companied the snacks. Then it
was time to head back to the col-
lege.

The boys split up, Some went
to bed; others had studying to do.
As ior myself, I can hardly keep
my eyes open. And when 1 think
about tomorrow morning, I am all
the more ready for bed. Two col<
lege boys from one of the color-tul
nomadic tribes that populate rur»

my room at 6:30 am. and take
me to visit. some of their tribes-

Goddard Explains Proposed lie-vamp;

Efficient, Effective

By GERALD GODDARD
SGA President

It Is the business of student gov-
ernment above all else to govern
as efficiently and as effectively
as possible within the context of
the campus community. This must
be Its major task and it 15 toward
this end that student government
must move In the next few weeks,

The Executive Cabinet proposed
to the Senate Wednesday a plan
for general student government
reorganization which will reduce
the personnel and steps which now
impede a rapid response to im-
mediate problems. This plan re-
places the Senate with a joint
council of the AWS Board and the
CofI-IP and transfers to this council
the present Senate functions of
policy- tormation, budgeting, and
nominations. The result is that
those who are most immediately
affected by changes in student gov-
ernment policy, the Cam? and
the AWS Board, will play a total
role in the formation of that policy.
The structure of student govern-
ment is changed to the working
realities of the existing system,
concentrating power over policy
in those groups, the AWS Board
and CofHP, who actually carry
on the important business of stu-
dent government at Grinnell.

The functions of the SGA Presi-
dent and the Executive Cabinet Will
remain the same as under the pre—
sent system. They will continue
to serve as liason between student
government and college oitioials,
and coordinate the work of the
various offices and Committees of
student govemment.

After lengthy discussion in the
Senate over the court system, it
was tentatively decided to retain
the present system of three inde-
pendent courts rather than inte-
grate the primary court tunction
into the joint council.

The Executive Cabinet proposed
these changes in very general form

men who are camping on the out-
skirts of town. It will probably be
a very enjoyable experience, but
a good sleep in my bed seems
like it would be an even more en-
joyable experience right now. So,
aiter l iinish writing this last Sen~
teuce, t can take a quick bath
using the bucket of water that is
now heating on nty stove, and then
I can settle down on my hard bed
to dream about television, choice
beef steaks, hot Water heaters,
and homogenized milk, all of
which seem more like a tigment
at my imagination than anything
that really exists.

proposals.

During the discussion on the
matter, Senator Roger Clow noted
that there was no way of limiting
the number of candidates and
that any number might run just
to collect the subsidy.

Cllrls Peterson countered Clow’:
contention. saying, “I don’t see
that there is a chance that so many
people will run, because they aL

.Vleggeii Talks About Hall System
To Chicago-Area Alumni. Friends

' By SUE TAYLOR, '65

CHICAGO — An estimated 300
Chicago area alumni and friends
,of the college recently attended a
dinner and reception December 10
honoring Dr. Glenn Leggett, Grin<
‘oell’s eighth president. Dllring a
brief address, Dr. Leggett discus-
sed the college’s residence hall
system and promised that some
.recammendations regarding pro-
posed changes in the system
would be coming from his office
by spring. ,

Leggett stressed his desire to
rid the system at its inflexibility.
"The residence hall system ought
to be ﬂexible enough to provide
for various kinds of students” he
said. He explained, for example,
that there are two distinct kinds
or, senior men—those seriously
preparing tor graduate school and
those who are devoted to the res-
idence hall system. Leggett said
that provisions should be made to
accommodate both in the dormi-
tories.

Dr. Leggett assured his audi-
ence that the concern over the
residence halls began several
years ago with the iaculty, and
that both Lhe investigation and

. concernY and his recommenda-
tions are on “academic grounds.”
He said that the problem has
been discussed at length with stil-
dents and iaeulty.

 

When asked about u proposal
that would place all juniors and
seniors on north campus and all
sophomores and ireshmen on
smith campus, Leggett said, “I
think it's sate to say that we have
tabled the idea." However, he
said, there is some thinking about
the possibility of a senior dorm.

Leggett's remants were primar-
ily concerned with north campus.
“We’ve given up the thought of
doing anything about the south
campus problem,” he said. ”It we
can solve the north campus prob-
lem, a good many or the problems
on south campus will disappearr"
He explained that south campus
problems are a reﬂection of north
campus problems, and added that
women generally manage their
Social problems better than men.

However, he added, “We’re al»
most ready now to make a recom-
mendation on a new (women’s)
residence hall.”

The alumni gathering was held
in suburban Hinsdale. In addition
to Dr, and Mrs. Leggett, the Cole
lege community was represented
by Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Wall (his-
tory), Coach and Mrs. Edd BowA
ers (men's physical education),
Dr. and Mrs. Grant Gale (physics),
and Alumni Secretary Mary G.
Jones. Alumni present ranged
from Ihe class of ’65 to the class

scholar. This is a report of her
work In a girls‘ school.

The Colegio Mayor de Cultura

guta, where i am now teaching
American history, American liter-
ature, and English conversation
and grammar, can be iound on a
hill in back of Colombia's national
museum and in What was once a

lege.

Grinneil Travel»Service scholars
are sent to the junior college's
school or languages where the Stu»
dents enter one or two programs.
They learn to be either bi-lingual
aecretaries or translators.

The girls are between sixteen
and twenty-one years of age. They
are interested in Rock Hudson, El-
vis Presley, all their iriends' “no-
vins” (boytritmds), and any new
hair style.rSome are interested in

Q. Why?

‘There was silence. Then 1 few

eryone laughed and everyone un-
derstood. if it weren't tor the
"coca colds" the learning or Eng-

times sleepy proposition. Perhaps
it is better thisty.

When there il a topic that all
are interested in, however. even
the “novios” an iorgotten mo<

they are not opinionless creatures
who are the products oi a tradition
and whose only purpose is the altar.
Recently a couple of de—irecked
priests have been making head-
lines in Colombia by suggesting
that divorce and birth control
should have government approval.
in English conversation we dis-
cussed these idens. The girls made
It clear that their opinions differ-
ed {rem those of their parents and
then went on to tell me that they
supported the proposals,

1 was surprised to learn that
even the birth control pills are
being sold illegally in the drug-
stores. Many were adamant on the
subject or divorce. They are no
longer passively accepting a hu5<
band's inlidelity. Here the prob
lem is so widespread that men
are no longer even discreet about
it. The girls are angry and war»
ried. Those who had personally
encountered the problem stood up
and struggled to get it out in Eng.
hslt and shouted their support or

irom personal dignity to inlluence
on children. Even in my limited

 

position, I can sea change occur-
ring in Columbia.

The only other discussion that
was more heated was one that
occurred in a history class when
I thought i would give a calm
lecture on a comparison and cone
trsst oi Presidents Kennedy and
Johnsoni quickly learned that
there is only contrast. Kennedy
was a god about to save the world
and we killed this god. When I
mentioned Johnson 1 saw disgust
and anger on their races. It did
no good to try.to reason out 8
comparison between the Bay of
Pigs and Santo Domingo, to show
the great domestic advances
Johnson has achieved in Con-
gress, and to explain that Kenne-
dy did not know how to handle
his Congress in this way.

Politics here is not something
that is reasoned out. The national
political program is chaotic and
ineiiicient, with a romantic poet
presently occupying the role of
president, a man who admittedly
would rather write poetry than
laws. Colombians are attracted by
saviors, by personalities. Kennedy
was both ior them. Johnson is pro
jecting his “great helper" image
no farther than the Texas border.

The discussion was not going
well. I tried to help the situation
by mentioning the Peace Corps.
This was definitely a mistake. The
Peace Corps, according to them,
is a group of spies disguised as
idealistic young Americans, sent by
the US. government to find out
what the Colombians Rethinking,
send reports back to Washington.
and thus help the Colossus of the
North better control the already
dependent Latin American coun-
tries. Examples at people i know
who are in the Peace Corps did
little good. Again it was an argu-
ment based on rumors and emo
tion rather than reason, on argu-
ment based on-iear and dislike of
the US. (it did little good (or me
to talk to a iormer Peace Corps
volunteer to find out how much
or what the girls said was true, He
told me that his- group was sent
to the University at Tunja by the
C.l.A. to collect information on
student attitudes.) It must be
pointed out that not all Colom-
bians feel his way, that those
who have personally known the
Peace Corps community develop-
ment worker or who have been
to tho US. are able to see things
a little more clearly. And the
girls gave me an argument that
i have heard used so olten in the
us. against the u.s.s.lt.: “We

open and iriendly. It's the govern-
ment we dislike."

So now my strongest impres-
sion is that “gringus” who have
the us. government seal or ap-
proval are not liked or trusted.
A part of the trouble is misunder—
standing. Some of it we have
earned. The Peace Corps does not
help its cause by having the new
Volunteers iill out questionnaires
based on opinions they have gath-
ered in a particular town. Also,
Johnson can not talk to these peo-
ple the way Kennedy could. He
can say the some words, but he
says them in a different way, and
here the presentation is all-impor-
tant. I have learned to be [hank-
iul that I am here because of
some “friendly Americans" and
not because of their government.
Ii nothing else, it means that my
classes at least listen to me.

The Pioneer basketball t e a m
picked up its first win of the year
over the Christmas break by heat-

tournament, 5445. The Pioneers

The Pioneers then dropped a pair
of games to Carleton and St. Olaf.
Last Saturday the Pioneers lost
to Cornell 75-71.

The Pioneers‘ rebounding was
improved, and they also cut down
the number of turnovers at the
Chicago meet. The rebounding was
especially pleasing because the
Pioneer starting lineup averaged
under six feet both nights,

Unfortunately the Pioneers were
not so proficient in their shooting.
The Pioneers hit only 34 per cent
