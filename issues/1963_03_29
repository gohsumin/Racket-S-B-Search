Average Grinnetl

Student Spends

91 Hours Working and Sleeping

How does the Grinnell student
spend his time?

The average student, accord-
ing to a report issued last Fr
day by Grinnell President How-
ard R. Bowen, spends 39 hours
a week studying and conferring
with professors. He spends an
average of 5 hours a week in
class and 52 hours a week sleep-
lug.

Meals and personal care take
21 hours a week, while free time
takes a 41 hour chunk out of
the student’s week.

Dr, Bowen’s report was based
on a survey taken of a test
group of 64 students, on a sur—
vey to see where all students
were during the week, and by
his conversations with scores of
students.

"The great majority of stu—
dents study from 5 to 8 hours
a day," reported Dr. Bowen.
“And the average work week
about 54 hours,”

 

noted, is “considerably longer
than the ‘forty-haur \veek’ com-
mon in business. However, Grin.
nell students do not spend time
in commuting have relatively
few household responsibilities."

From the 41 hours a week
which were found to be “free
time” comes time for “employ-
ment, relaxation, recreation,
public events, and extracurricu—
lar actiivties."

In the week that Dr. Bowen
took his survey the average
student spent 42 hours in the
union, 2.5 attending public
events, and 2.2 participating in
sports.

“The work load of Grinnell
students appears to be heavy,
but is generally accepted." Dr.
Bowen concluded. “However,
there is a great need for careful
management of time and sched—
uling . . . Many studentscan.

Boston Views SGA'S Year;

McCarran Act

by itichard 0hleineycr

This word came from Donna

she reported to the senate Wed-
nesday.

In his final report to the Sen-
ate, Ai Boston. Student Govern»
ment Association president,

the government of committees
that we had this year. In men-
tioning several committees he
remarked that the information
and programming services of the
National 5 t u d e n t Association
committee had improved since
last year. He felt that there was
still more room for expansion
of NSA programming. Boston
suggested that the foreign stu—
dent program should be examin-
ed by the senate. He expressed
doubt as to whether two more
foreign students would improve
our program in proportion to
the amount of money spent on
them. As an alternative use of
funds be mentioned a campus
charity chest. While on the sub-
ject of money, Boston said that
in his opinion too much of the
SGA budget was spent for so»
cial purposes. Out of a $45,168
total, social activities received a
$35,178 budget last year.
Boston addressed himself to
the new sGA personnel when
he emphasized that to insist
that we win not obey the

Finally he admonished the

selves and not wait for isms

ecutive cabinet.

Steve Howell, President of the
Council of House Presidents,
Confined his remarks to three
areas. On men’s hall constitu-
tions, he reported that some sec-
tions of the ten constitutions re»
ceived Were not constitutional
under the SGA Constitution and
should be reveiwed. 0n the
drinking rule, he called for a
constant enforcement procedure
that would not vary from hall to
hell. On new student orienta-
tion, he stated that most of the
halls had good programs but an
unsuccessful approach.

The sum of 333090 was ap-
propriated to send two dele-
gates to the Massachusetts Insti—
tute of Technology conference.

A Loud Silence -- KG

A "wired-wireless” radio operation at Grinnell Col-
lege gained the approval of the college hierarchy in May of
1948. Late the following fall the ﬂickering voice of KGRW
travelled through the heating tunnels and into campus ra-
dios. The station was small in budget and operation, broad-
casting for an hour and a half five evenings a week.

KGRW grew steadily for a few years, and then its
voice slowly faded into its present silence. A driving force
behind KG’s inception was a student named Peter Hackes,
now an NBC news commentator, who found his biggest
job was to sell the feasibility of a campus radio to stu-
dents, faculty, and “most of all the administration."

KGRW started off on a small scale, but by 1951 a
staff of 130 participated in the operation of the station. A
confident station manager, Bill Calm, said in 1951, “If we
keep growing at this rate, in five years KGRW will be

Grinnell College, with every student a member." He added,‘

“The future looks high indeed for this adolescent organ-
ganism."

Calm was wrong. KGRW never really made it at Grin-
nell. Generally, the interest in a college radio remained
high. But the equipment and technical quality of the
closed-circuit broadcasting hurt the station. Also under the
“wired-Wireless" the Norris Halls couldn‘t be reached.

Last year the station manager of the now offrthe-air
KGRW proposed that the college turn to a FM set-up,
broadcasting over the air. A Board of Publications com-
mittee prepared a report rﬂavoring a FM set-up, the report
being sent to Grinnell President Howard B. Bowen.

In the absence of President Bowen, James H. Stauss,
dean of the college, presented the proposal to the faculty
which reportedly approved the program in principle. At
the time President Bowen cited the need for further study
on the program.

The Glinnell College student senate passed a resolution
in the spring of 1962 unanimously in favor of an FM sta<
tion Between 800 and 900 students last spring signed a
pet ion calling for an FM station, yet the future of an FM
college radio is not bright.

Monday President Bowen said that even should an FM
proposal be approved by a faculty committee (which he is
in the process of selecting for the purpose of studying the
FM proposal), he doubted if an FM station could be worked
into next year’s college budget. A station would necessitate
an initial outlay of between $5000 and $7000, according to
the station manager of the defunct KGRW.

President Bowennoted that if the FM proposal receives
the support of a faculty committee, he would “give it
serious consideration."

“I feel that the radio station from a public relations
stand point has little to offer us,” President Bowen added.
He noted that the station‘s value would be for educational
purposes only.

Stephen E. Wood, dean of men, in reference to a ra«
dio station said, “I don’t believe a student can accept the
responsib ty of managing and programming." His reason
for this feeling was the amount of time involved in such
work.

KGRW-FM would be a frill, another extracurricular ad-
dition to Grinnell. According to Wood, the question boils
down to “priorities," or to which extras in Grinnell is go-
ing to incorporate into its program.

We think that an FM station at Grinnell should have
priority over other frills suc'h as two or three highly ex-
pensive concerts a year or a ski slope constructed for the
Snow Carnival. An FM Station could ’be successful. It has
educational value and could also provide a welcome change
lfrom the commercial programming of most Iowa stations.

KGRW-FM is needed.

To the Editor;

In a report of a coffee hour
in the 5&8 of Friday, March is,
the question was raised whether
the 5&3 exists primarily as a
crusading college newspaper or
as merely a publicity arm of the
college. You have stated that
the 8&3 should crusade. As the
article puts it: .. . . l the Sam.
should be the manipulator of.
college opinion.” I would submit
to you that the ‘SSzB should be
far more than an issue—makeP
what it is now, Our college
newspaper she be a source of
pragmatic criticism, the real
analyst of the campus issues.

Up to now, the 5&3 has taken
stands that are more emphatic
and dogmatic than pragmatic.
Therefore, the editors should
produce a better thought out
editorial policy, or, as the col-

should stop its irresponsible cru-
sade. I would suggest a positive
substitution for the sensational
unthoughts we have been get-
ting; namely, conﬁne editorial
output to the thoughtful opin-
ions of non-staff members.
There is a distinction between
thoughtful newspaper crusades
and irresponsible journalism,one
which is a pseudo-idealism of
sorts. This distinction was hinted
at in the ﬁrst paragraphs of the
letter. An example of a thought-
In! crusade in American journal-
ism is the expose by the Chica<
go Daily News of the abhorrent
conditions in Illinois mental hos-
pitals. In their thoughtful attack,

ragmatic

the editors of the Daily News
developed a powerful set of
counter-arguments to all Lhe stal-
wart positions; they were never
open to an attack by intelligent
public opinion. If you would ar-
gue that indeed the Daily News
used sensationalism, 1 would re-
tort by saying that every ounce
of their passionate attack was
backed up by a well taken, log-
lcal position.

1 would argue that the Scarlet
and Black editorials have been
lacking in such a logical back-
ing. it seems to many of us that
the editorials have rather seem-
ed take any old kind of a liberal
stand, which has. time after
time, been deemed ridiculous by
the bulk of readers. I cite the
omnipresent grumbling on cam-

pus—directed towards the 5&3.’

The editorials have not been
careful appeals to reason, as
long as passions could be arous»
ed. These actions constitute ir-
responsible journalism. For ex-
ample, great student feeling was
stirred up over the drinking
rule question, Plenty of printer’s
ink. miles of banner headlines,
and almost no real discussion of
the issues.

in reality, the drinking rule

position, if properly publicized!

could be very favorable to the
college trustees. It will, in fact.
make drinking on campus much
more tightly enforced. That is

c .t. .
provoked a much different ac-
tion. When Dr. Bowen replied
to the wave of hysteria that
was precipitated by the yellow
journalism campaign. the declin-
ing prestige of the college res
sulting from “widespread sensa-
tionalism” was one of his major
arguments. Remember that fate-
ful night in the Student Senate?
The student body would give
the 5&3 a ﬁrm round of aP‘
plause for some intelligent edi-
torial positions. 1 daresay, after
the gems of the past three edi-
torial pages (on elections), the
paper would get a standing ova-
tion. Not that the picture is all
bad. Articles by Dan Friedlander
and Ron Goodenow stood out
as excellent work. They stood
out because they were thought
out. But as long as the 58:3
continues to use sloppy word-
ings. their position will be hope-
lessly blurred. For example. one
only has to look at the ﬁrst line
of the article that this letter
comments on (March 15, p. 5):
“The question of Whether the
5&3 has the right to be the
‘manipulator of campus opinion."
“Manipulator” is a poor choice
Iof Words. It easily implies dem-
ugoguery, systematized propa-
gandizing efforts, and emotional
ihyper-appeals. Indeed, that ill-
chosen word implies many things
that the 581B editorials have

Blast Against Court Countered

To the Editor:

The Grimell College High
Court has been charged with
incompetence, impotency. and
acts of absurdity in a letter to
the editor in the Scarlct&Black.
These charges have come not
from outside the Court, but
from one of its own member5#
or better, emmembors. (See the
5&3 March 22).

For the record let me state
that the final decision of the
Court was 2.2, not 2.1 as Nan-
cy Lee Norton stated in her let-
ter. The decision of the Court
had been recorded in the Sec—
retary's minutes and had been
made public prior to Miss Nor-
ton’s “abstention." Furthermore.
the decision to withdraw her
vote was made after the High
Court had disbanded from its
consideration of the case.

1 am surely aware of the
nature of the community in

 

 

which we all live, as do the
other memhels of the Court.
And indeed, “all that can he
expected of any court menu
her is that he honestly try to
hear both sides of the case."
This is exactly what the High
Court was asked to do in de-
ciding' the case of Martin vs.
awsn. And I believe it was
done.

I feel that it is the responsi<

bility of each member of the-

Court, and this includes the
Men's and Women’s Primary
Courts. to listen to and decide
a case as his or her conscience
dictates; a decision not based
on partiality to one side or thel
other. but merely on the pre—
sentaticn of the facts by both
parties to the case. However, i

do not mean to exclude the fact,

that individual justices may hold
differing judicial philosophies,
but rather, that each justice

 

Sena’re Busy With Red Tape:
LiHIe Meaningful Discussion

To the Editor:

As a Senator I am continually
appalled at the lack of meaning-
ful discussion on matters before
the Senate. The issue which
precipitated my present disgust
was list night’s consideration of
the McCarral-l Act Resolution.

During the debate the Senate
saw an attempt to table the
resolution because the students
had not educated themselves.
which was defeated. Then an
amendment was proposed to
change the resolution from ad-
vacating ”repeal" of the Act to
a “reconsideration” of this Act.
The chair was overruled during
the debate on this motion to
keep the Senators debating the
issue of repeal versus reconsid~
erotion. After all this, the
amendment was withdrawn!

A mandate was then proposed
for amendment but it, too, was
withdrawn when it was pointed
out that the mandate would
cost $50 if passed. A more mod-
est mandate was proposed after
a suggestion by adviser Paul
Smith, and then an amendment

 

 

to the mandate was proposed.

This amendment to the amend-
merit was defeated; the man-
date was then passed and added
to the resolution. The repeal, re-
consideration wos again moved
and finally defeated. Then the
full resolution came up for de-
hate and not one single Sen—
ator, including myself, brought
up a single point which touch-
ed on the essence of the resoA
lution, i.e. is the McCarran Act
a danger to American freedom.

This resolution was formulated
in the hopes that ii. would slim»
ulato discussion on the Act.
Coffee hours were held, straw
votes were taken, and the cul-
mination should have come in
Senate when a rational discus—
sicn of the pros and cons of the
bill should have taken place,
Instead the discussion took the
form of legalistic maneuvers and
petty bickering.

Amendments were carelessly
introduced and withdrawn with
about the same amount of care.
This is the representative body
of mature, intelligent Grinncll
students?

render an opinion opemmind-
edly, and in good conscience.
based on fact and rule of law.

i state in closing. that the
High Court has been and will
remain a highly competent and
responsible group of students,
seeking to do only what to them
seems right. We invite criticism
when it is justified, but we can-
not absorb unfounded attacks
based on isolated and out of
context material.

Individual Evaluation Might Lead
to Eltra curricular Participation

To the Editor.

This is a time of evaluation
on campus, All of the various
organizations are involved in an
evaluation and a culmination of
the year’s activities before the
transition at spring vacation.

This evaluation process is
good. Organizations will proﬁt
from it. But it must be accom—
panied by a similar process on
the part of the individual stus
dent. This is the time of year
when he must do some evaluat—
ing of his "Grinnell experience."

Four years at a small liberal
arts college in the middle of
Iowa will make a big differenc
in his life. The person he has
become when he receives that
coveted B.A. is partly determin—
ed by what he has done during
the four preceding years. Actvi—
ties both in and out of the class—
room are important.

SOME or THE latent abili-
ties of an entering student are

developed at Crinnell. The im-,

portant thing to realize, though,
is that the choice as to whether

his latent abilities are developed,

rests with each individual stu-
dent. His choice of activities, or
his choice of no activities, is his
own. However, when he says.
“I’ll wait and see how much
time I have.” and then, rather
unconsciously, never gets involv—
ed, he’s putting off a decision.
By deciding not to decide. he
usually makes a decision not to
participate.

Our college community has a
wealth of ﬁne extra—curricular
activities. Each offers many op—
portunities for service and lead—
ership. Now each organization
is concerned with the problem
of student apathy. It‘s a tragic

situation, but the tragedy is on,

the individual level. ln the long
run, not the organization, but
the individual student, suffers.
Four years at Grinnell cost
exactly the same in time and
dollars no matter what one does
while he’s here. It’s easy to
pass up opportunities, or to put
off the decision. The hard thing
to do, it seems, is to make that
active decision to participate;

This is not a plea for a com—
munity of ioiners. Nor is it an
anti- Burling treatise. But it is
inspired by a real concern that
Imany students are passing up
once in a- lifetime opportun' ies
by just never making a positive
decision to get into extracurric-
ular activities.

The way to get to know peo—
ple and the way to develop la—
tent personal qualities is to
jump in with both feet, to do
some work, and to make a real
contribution to the community.
Active participation in selected
extracurricular activities will in-
lﬁnitely enrich our Grinnell ex-
perience. It's a necessary sup-
plement to academic activities.
Let’s bring the beforesspring-va-

sonally and actively launch the

Ultra-conservative Beliefs

By John Wolf
5&3 Ass’t News Editor
The visitor to Des Momes lastl
Friday evening could find manyl
things to do Besides hosting,
the semiﬁnals in the boys statel
basketball tournament, the city
was also the site of an ultra-
conservative political rally. The
main attractions of the rally,
“Operation Midnight Ride,"were
General Edwin A. Walker—for.
mer army general who resigned
following a controversy over
his John Birch views and more
recently involved in rioting at‘
the University of Mississippiil
and Dr. Billy James Hargis, head

Even the basketball semiﬁnals
were not enough competition for
Walker and Hargis. Approxi-
mately 1400 people, including
ﬁve from Grinnell College, ﬁlled
Hoyt—Sherman auditorium to
hear the threc»hour marathon.

Hargis spoke ﬁrst on the in-
ternal threat of communism (ac-
tually going beyond communism
to include all organizations
which are “anti»Chl‘ist">.

l-largis covered a variety of
topics in the hour he had left.
He complained that too many
communists were being allowed
on college campuses because this
is “academic freedom." On the
other hand, it is “nnscholarly”
to allow anti-communists to
speak.

Expounding on another sub—
ect, Hargis exclaimed that he
Couldn’t think of a worse paper

liberal Des Moines Register-

General Walker concluded the

‘program with a ll/zAhOLIX‘ disser-

tation on external
threats.

The UN. came in for the bit-

Among other things, Walker as-
serted that “The UN. has no
future, because no future is in-
tended. it is only a propaganda

claimed that that organization
has laid the U. 5. "wide open to
invasion and occupation” (un-
doubtedly referring to Alaska,
which he said earlier is not hard
to take and which we are not
prepared to defend).

The constant reference to the
U.N. brought applause
some of the more liberal mem—
bers of the audience. Walker
drew the largest ovation of the
evening from the generally re.
ceptive audience when he said
that the hecklers just proved his
internal subversion
was possible in this country.

Following the talks, this re-
porter collected some literature,
including a copy of the propos-
ed “Liberty Amendment,” which
would repeal income tax and
take government out of “free

would hopefully offset one an-

Bill Herman Goes Ethnic, Tours Africa in a Jeep

_ The Arabintiuence is everywhere and it seems
like stepping into the pages of the past. In our two
days we see the full array of palaces, forts, clove
farms and relics. One spacious palace housed the 49
wives of the Sultan, but i guess those days are gone
forever. Then it was back to the mainland on anr
othei all night dhow ride with the same stiff back
resu s.

Christmas catches us here in Dar and to celebrate
we book in at a local Beach Club. After several
parties and all the trimmings, we sack out on the
beach. Strangely enough, no snow falls. but the rain
comes in its place. For lovers oi a “White Christmas"
I wouldn’t recommend this location.

Next we head north toward the “Snows of Kiln
minjaro.” Road conditions are not the best and at one
spot we come across a mud hole about a mile long.
It is most amusing to watch the numerous vehicles
come ﬂying in from both ends only to slowly grind
to a halt and settle into the sticky goo. The Gray
Gern. equipped with useful four wheel drive, plows
through in proud form, Being gentlemen in the true
Grinnell sense of the word, we offer our services in
removing many of our not-seclucky fellow travelers.

Kilimanjaro itself is located in the rich and well
developed northern section of Tanganyika. The moun-
.tain is quite remarkable because. being a volcano, it
sticks up out of a relatively ﬂat land to a height of
over 19,000 feet: Even though located only a few de-
grees south of the equator, the top is covered with
snow and ice. Unlike most mountains there are no
rocky proiections so that one can actually hike. not

ney and after all, the air does get a bit thin up here.
The view is quite spectacular so we are happy we
came as far as we did. Down hill she goes like a
charm and once more we point our noses north and
push on to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.

In the midst of the wealth and development of
this area live a people who seem to have escaped the
forces of civilization, They are called the Masai, and
although very popular with the tourists. they com-
prise a leach on society. This is the true wild African

Nairobi, new, booming and very impressive; the
symbol of the white man in East Africa. The symbol
will remain but the white mcn may not so one can
only hope that it will now become the center of a
new multracial society. rounded only 60 years ago,
this city is more modern than anyplace in the States.

camped behind it and watchcd the show from our
beds in the Gray Gern. Of course we had in all the
sights of the city as well as the surrounding area. To
the north lies another section of the Great itirt Val»
lay with tremendous scenery and wild game.

Time and moncy now demand that we head south
for home. As we moved back into Tanganyika we
passed through some of the best wild game country
in Africa and needless to say we took advantage of
the opportunity. It is just like the movies to drive

there are numerous other smaller game. Coming
around a corner we nearly collide with a giraffe
that then proceeded to race down the road ahcad of
us about 25 miles per hour. We now have many pice
tures to prove our talc.

After live days of ups and downs we again reach
the Nyasaland border but here our luck is to fail.
Three miles from the customs there is a sharp crack
and gears arc out of operation. Luckily for us we
get a tow hack to the customs wherc we are destined
to spend the next four days, Never having taken
the car repair course at Grinnell, we find ourselves in
a bit of a fix. Finally managing to remove the gear
box and find the problem, a broken gear shaft, We
make an 80 mile trip to the nearcst town and after
many greasy hours the Gray Gcrn is ready to roll
once again. A rather interesting assortment of people
manage to get stuck at the border for a variety of
reasons so that by the time we left the collection
numbers nine; three English. two South Alricans, one
German, one israeli, and two Americans. This makes
for some interesting nights in the bar.

Back through Nyasalaiid we drive like the devil
himself and alter 400!) miles and 30 days we arrive
in one piece. except of course the Grey Gerri who is
now missing a few parts. After a bath, first in 10
days, we once again feel like humans.

In SlmplE retrospect, I can truthfully Say that
Safari East Africa was a most interesting and stimr
ulating experience and I can only look forward to
many more. While fulfilling the service function as

“For a college the size of
Grinnell to have an IBM setup
is most unusual; and even more
‘unusual is the fact that it is
available to students and faculty
,for use in independent projects,”
said Dale Terry, registrar and
administrative supervisor of the‘
IBM data processing service.

Gi'innell‘s IBM equipment con-
sists of a key punch, which punr
ches coded information on the
cards, a sorter which can sepa-
rate 450 cards per minute, and
a #402 accounting machine.
which will print out so lines per)
minute. ,

“The 402 works by means oil
brushes,” said c. r. Pugh, sue
pervisor oi the IBM service, who
manages the technical end. “The
cards, punched in code, are sent
through the 402 and the holesl
in the cards allow the brushes
to complete a speciﬁc circuit to
a type bar. There are 43 type'
bars, each bearing an alphabet
and numerals, The circuits send
,the type bars up to print a line
lof decoded information."

The machines are housed in‘

Terry.

For each student there are
from in to 15 cards hearing
such information as high school

ther’s occupation, classes tak-
en, and advisers name. There

these cards now on ﬁle.

Work. Before IBM installation,
it took a secretary all summer
to get grades posted on perma—
nent records. Now it will take
about one half a day.

The machine also aids advisers
by cutting down the number of
forms issued on each student as
well as by making information
more readily available to them.
Because each bit of information
must be coded, obvious errors in
dates and other information are
caught and corrected so that the
information is more reliable.
Registration, grade reports and
the issuing of class lists are
speeded up immeasurably. With-
out IBM the class lists went out
about two weeks after classes
had begun. Now the professors
have the lists on the opening
day of class.

Terry stated emphatically,
"When people think of machr

ality. However, the IBM mix—
chines actually aiiow for more

true that everyone is a num—

this ready iniormation frees us
to learn more about the name
and face behind the number. I
would say that there has been
more personal attention since
we got the machines than
before,"

He continued, “We have ab-
solutely no intention of chang—
ing college functions to ﬁt the
workings of the machines. if a
function lends itself to the use
of the IBM equipment _ ﬁne,
we’re happy to do it by ma-
lchine; but there are some areas
'in which machines are useless.
We try to maintain ﬂexibility
even in machine programs so
that we don’t start thinking, ‘we
can’t do it this way because it

BASEBALL

Grinnell’s varsity baseball
team has been readying itself
for the upcoming season with a
four-week session of indoor and
outdoor practices.

Coach John Pfitsch, taking
over head duties again after a
one-year absence, will have to re-
place three regulars lost through
graduation, in addition to last
years leading hitters. ,

Dale Furnish, Dick Mittel-
bushei' and Roger Miller have
departed and slugging outﬁeld-
ers Bob McIntyre and Thomas
A. Wanner are not out for the
team. Also missing is Chris
Sprung. Furnish was an all-
conference selection at second
base, Miller was catcher and
team captain, and Mittelbusher
was the team’s most valuable
player as pitcher. Wenner and
Mclntyre ranked 1-2 in hitting,
both having batting averages
well above «ha .300 mark. Sprung
was invaluable at third and on
the mound.

Pfitsch has, however, an out»
standing bunch of sophomores
to go along with an experienced
core of veterans. Captain Art
Peterson, ﬁrst baseman Jim
Ienks, outﬁelder Bruce Bell,
pitcher-outﬁelder Cal Collier and
inﬁelder-outﬁelder Jim Fl 5 h e I'
are the returning lettermen. Out-
standing among the players up
from last season’s undefeated
freshman squad are pitchers
Denny Hanssen and Barry An-
derson and inﬁelder Dick Ulrich.

The starting lineup has not
been set, but good bets are
Jenks at ﬁrst, Peterson at short,
Ulrich at third, with second base
being contested among John
McDonald, Phil King and Howie
Bunton. Joe Thompson, Upton
Ethelbah and Bill MCKlveen are
also well up in lhe race for an
inﬁeld berth.

Collier, when not pitching,
along with Bell, Fisher, Vern

Robinson and Randy Morgan,
will form the nucleus of the
outﬁeld.

Don MCWethy and Wayne
Gano will handle the catching
duties. Hanssen, Anderson and
Collier form an outstanding, al-
though shallow, pitching staff.

Other players include Mel
Chilewich, Masakatso Kate and
Bob Glass.

An addition who will bolster
the squad is Guy Ashton. As a
sophmore, Ashton won the con-

Tracksters Second at SCI

On Friday night the Pioneer
cinderman face State College of

Iowa in a dual meet about
which Coach Dick Young said,
“This is the first time I have
felt that, with loo per cent per—
formance and a few breaks, we
could beat sol."

Last Saturday in s. nine team
meet, the Pioneers finished sec-
ond to SCT, scoring 54 points.
while the Panthers collected 80.
This is not exactly indicative of
the respective team strengths,
however, since the team balance
of the Pioneers is a greater fac-
tor in a dual meet.

At SCI, the Pioneers were
first in the sprint medley,
with the relay team composed
of Fred Berg, Tom DeBei-g,
John Edgren and Jeri Lang-
ham. The 24.1ap relay team,
consisting of Paul Patterson,

Several good sophomores make
the outlook for the team bright.

Justification for FM Given

By Bruce Porter
KGEW station Manager

Ed, note: Bruce Porter with this article he-
' a four-article sequence on the status at
the Silent KGRW.

Until last spring Grinnell had a campus radio
station. As one closely connected with the old
1(th 1 think 1 am qualiﬁed to say it stank.

In the beginning when the station was gross-
ly violating Federal Communications Commission
regulations — and hence could actually be heard
— it was a viable institution. And last year a
successful attempt was made to again produce
quality programming. However, it was too_ late.
With no legal cure possible for the transmission
system’s impotence (as Well as being burdened
with a recent history of mediocrity) the' wired-
wireless operation was judged hopeless. It was
buried.

Before the station was put to rest, however.
the Committee on Student Publications unani—
mously approved and forwarded to President
Bowen two reports recommending a complete
reconstitution of KGRW and changeover to FM
operation.- The first report was aimed at. outlining
the potentialities of FM radio at Grinnellr The
second dealt with equipment requirements, pros
gramming, staff organization and administration.

Shortly alter this second report was submitt—
ed to President Bowen. the student Senate unan-
imously passed a resolution urging the college
administration to “accept the proposals contained
in the FM report." In addition over eight hundred
signatures on petitions favoring FM were pre—
sented at the spring meeting of the Board of
’l‘rutsees.

What then is the present status of the FM
proposal? It is to be studied by a faculty com-
mlttee now in the process of being formed by

President Bowel-l. This committee is to study the
“costs, controls, content and responsibilities in-
volved” if an FM station is created.
The\facu1ty has decided to recommend this
committee's formation, postponing its decision on
FM until the committee reports. This is a modifir
lcation of its stand last spring endorsing the Pub-
lication Committee's report favoring FM. To un-
derstand the faculty’s present hesitancy on FM

and the contmuing reluctance of the administra-
tion, the key objections to the proposal should be
examined. The remainder of this week’s article
will develop the framework for an assessment
of the value of FM radio to Grinnell. followed in
iuture weeks by a detailed analysis of various
aspects.

First must come a justification of the five to
seven thousand dollar initial expenditure and
the approximately two thousand dollar ‘annual
expense. This must be based on an assessment of
the relative efficacy of a radio operation in terms
fo Grinnell’s goals H stated and implicit. Such
an assessment could best be made in terms of
educational value furnished, although a case
could be partially based on the entertainment
runction.

it is certainly true that the college spends a
significant amount on projects and functions of
a purely entertainment orientation. The other
criticism of the proposed FM station is that it not
educational, Neglecting the obvious fact that not
everything in the college budget is educational
one wonders what is not educational about good
music; recorded lectures and discussions. furnish»
cd for example by the Center for the study of
Democratic Institutions: The British Broadcast-
ing Corporation’s recordings of the Shakespeare
festivals; and much more. A more detailed study
of the depth and scope of program sources will
come next week.

secondly, even if it is admitted that FM would.
through good programming, serve to help enrich
the cultural and intellectual environment, one
serious criticism remains: are Grinnell students
capable of operating a station which can be heard
outside the confines of the Campus? This is a
harder objection to deal with, Perhaps the best
way is to cite the experience of other schools
similar to Grinnell. as well as the on-the-air re—
sponsibility of the KGRW staff last year. Again
this is a matter to be discussed more fully in
the next weeks.

FM has proved its values at such schools as
Carleton, Amherst. Williams and —~. excuse me e
Harvard. That it can be just as valuable at
Grinnell is the proposition 1 shall try to prove
in the next three articles on FM radio.

Sample Schedule
Shows FM Uses

Above is a\sample program
submitted to the Scarlet and
Black by Bruce Porter, station
manager of the voiceless KGRW,
for the station of the future.

According to Porter, this sam-
ple schedule illustrates the im-
mediate advantages a college
radio has over other mediums.
He noted that live and record-
ed music, lectures, faculty and
student group discussions are
among the possible uses a KG-
RW-FM could have.
