Fast Date changed
To Lucrative Meal

The evening meal last originally
scheduled for today has been post-
poned until March 10, according to
Des Moines Project Chairman Bill
Downey.

anney said the reason for
changing the last was to save
SAGA a more expensive meal
and obtain more money from the
fast for the project.

Downey Said he was satisfied
with present rinancial arrange-
ments, but declined to give any
details. He Said SAGA’S Fred Hug-
gins did not want the exact ﬁg-
ures publicized because of possible
changes. Downey added that the
proiect is receiving nearly twice the
original amount SAGA altered for
the fast.

The fast, in which over 700
Grinneii students have pledged to
participate, aroused some contro-
versy because SAGA agreed to
pay only 40 cents per student, con-
siderably less than it was rumored
to have paid tor the Civil Rights
Club iast last year. Apparently
the discrepancy was due to the dif-
ferences in load cost of various
meals.

CoiHP Field Narrowed To Two.
Conduct Pro Disqualifies Paff

Proposal Now Needs
Student Body Vote

Grinneii women may soon have
15 extra minutes a semester to
get back.!o the Quad at night.

The Student Senate voted “yes" to
an AWS “grace minutes" propos-
al at its Wednesday meeting.

The proposal still has to be put
before the students in the form at

a referendum. If given student OK,
the plan will then go to the faculty
and administration for their ap-
proval.

li use Senate-passed plan is giv-
en final approval, women will be
given 15 “grade minutes" a sem—
ester. After the allotted minutes
have been used up, the late or-
riVBls will receive a punishment of
three nights hall confinement plus
one night {or each ﬁve minutes
or lateness

A rider to the late minutes bill
was also approved. It provides
that all but tour loggia doors be
locked before hours on weekends
and that the night watchman lock
the doors beginning with Main and
ending with Loose.

Also, the last door is supposed
to be locked promptly at midnight

Residence Hall System

the Next Step

1 The next step in the move toward hall reorgan—
ization was taken yesterday. President Leggett sent the
letter that is published below to Jerry Goddard, Student
Government President.

>i< >i<
Dear Mr. Goddard:

i Very shortly, I expect to receive from the faculty
its proposal on the residence-hall system, and when I
do, I should like it to be carefully considered by a com—
mittee of faculty and students, a committee which, in
turn, would make recommendations to me about the
ﬁreposal. Such a committee, which We can call the Ad
0c Committee on the Residence Hall System, is to be
chaired by Dean Winters, with yourself as ,co-chairman
and to consist of three faculty persons nominated by
Dean Winters and three students nominated by you.
Will you, accordingly, give me your nominations, which
you can select in any way you think appropriate?

' I expect that Deans Slocum and Thompson will be
asked to meet with the committee frequently, and I
think you may want to ask the AWS president, Miss
Chris Peterson, and the Chairman of the House Presi-
dents, Mr. Nick Nonas, to serve in a similar capacity

‘ Hopefully, the Ad Hoc Committee will be able to
give me its recommendations Within six or eight weeks,
so that a decision can be announced before the semes-
ter is over. Work on the committee will require a good
deal of dedication and perception, as well as good will
and understanding. I know you agree with me that it is
_very important to the College that the task be done

The Grudge Pot

(Continued from last week)

Minnie Twerp had been wandering blindly tor
days in the dark tunnel, and already she had shrunk
another inch, Slle lrcmbled and wept at the thought
oi disappearing lorever in h mouse hole, and wildly
she struggled in regain even her old, iamiliar
basement cell.

Suddenly, a “click, click, click” echoed in the
blackness behind herd Toenails! Rats! Hordes Di
clawed, sharp-toothed, vicious, mangy rats were
galloping inexorably, fatally inward her.

Their heady eyes appeared like not red coals in
the distance, and their warm stinking breath swept
like a wind before them. The rhythm of their claws.
the panting, an almost musical mumbling increased
(0 unbearable intensity.

Minnie ran, and tell, She ran again and came to
a dead end. The savage creatures were upon her,
and she heard distinctly their bestial grunts.

“Hi»ho! Hi-ho! it's off to Steal we go!” A dwarf-
lSl1 hand lit a tiny lantern, and Minnie Twerp saw
twelve ugly, cheerful little Wretches in mouse-hide
coats carrying mounds oi glittering rubies,

My goodness, but. you gave me a fright," sighed
Minnie.

After the Dozen Dwarls had led Minnie Twerp
to their quaint cottage and she had ireshened up a
bit, they showed her a huge bed covered by a iilmy
veil. The curtain was drawn, revealing the hand
somest prince that ever creased a Sadly-Posture-
pedic.

Minnie at once knew her role. and the dwarfs
helped her onlo rhe luxuriant spread. She crawled
across the prince’s forehead and made an innocent
peck at his mouth. Even now, she could almost
taste the charmed apple upon his lips,

The somber snoring ceased. The prince yawned

and nearly swallowed Minnie Twerp. As she held for
dear liie onto his nose, she saw the lllrny eyelids
open to a new — renewed — lire.

"om my iairy princess," said he, grabbing her
about the ankles and holding her in his adoring
sight, “it only our lover’s lips could meet, 1 gladly
would a thousand years~a thousand lifetimes of
empty wakeiuliiess trade for that one embrace." lie
caught a tear on one linger and pushed back her
mussed hair

“But i never hissed you. i missed,” conicssed
M'nnie.

“1 know, most radiant maidr i never was asleep.
it was a gimmick to ensnare a beautiful lass, and
behold, what success! Now let your warm my lips
lose their innocence.”

As the lovers kissed the prince turned mm a
frog. “My lord,” said Minnie in amazement, “linw
comes this transiiguratlon?”

“Croak, croak," replied the prince in frustration.

Minnie paused, then smiled wonderiuliy. “My
lord, my lord! This emerald skin, these eyes bright-
er than the disks of harvest moons, lips enough tor
is dozen lovers and legs lo make an athlete green
with envy — all these are blessings in disguise
Now, you are my size. We are equal. We are one!”

The frog tenderly took the princess in his arms.
Hts quavering llps slowly paned as they neared,
and involuntarily he let out another croak,

The Dozen Dwarfs, Minnie Twerp, and the Frog
prince all laughed wilh joy, and rho royal couple
hopped on logeiher.

in a few years, of course, Minnie ﬁnally dis-
appeared altogether, but the marriage had been
pure bliss while it had lasted. And her demise did
not matter all that much, anyway, since irogs don't
live too long either.

The Senate reorganization plan

al by the voting siudeni body in

Tl: e are {our major areas of
clia-ge in the revamp idea. First,
the referendum calls for an in-
crease in the number of senators
from each hall. Tile hall will have
[Wt] or thlee seiialcirs depending on
the number of sludenis living in
the hall. No hall will have fewer
than two senalors.

Second, There Will now be a
Speaker of ihe Senate who will be
noni'naisd by llie so»r pl‘CiSldElil

and approved by the Senate. Any
additional nominations must have
a second from one third of the
Senate. The entire Senate will Vote
on the Speaker.

Third, any changes in rules must
originate in me Executive Council,

'that is, the Coil-1P and lhe AWS

Board. These mics must meet with
the approval or the Senate.

Finally, Batileboald members
will now be allowed to run {or

To the Editor:

This letter is I replyrla two
letters in last week's 5&3. The

first, sent by a disenchanted plr-
ent, raises some rather apparent
doubt as to whom the term
“naive" an be hpplicd. 'rhis por-
ent prefers anonymity » fear of
retribution or only distaste or IC-
tual involvement? The parent
wishes to make the exceptions
(“bottles under pillows . . . bodies

document his highly irrational out»
burst with more than einouvoly
charged phrases, someone would
take ihe letter seriously. Perhaps,
also, this parent doesn‘t realize
that the dephrlure of many profess
sors is for much more complex
reasons: many times faculty-ad-
minislraliou conflicl rather than
iacully-sludcnl conﬂict.

in number letter, Steve Eber-

Foote, who now serves as presi-
dent of Gates, thinks that some in-
dependent appeals board should be

set up in regard to 5&6 charges.
"I think it is necessary to lift
the mystique about BaG ‘as an
autonomous power," He mentioned
the possibility of the resident ad-
visors acting as liasons between
the students and

Form: is for liberalization of the
car and open dorms rules, and
thinks that one of the best ways
to approach the administration
would be to point to Carleton,
which now enjoys a fairly exten-
live open dorms program.

“I have had experience working
with Dean Thompson and the ad-
ministration," Foote said, “Arid
having served as a house presi«
dent ! think that i would be able
to appreciate the problems that all
the house presidents face.“

Kurasch wants to sit down with
the powers that be. “Only when
we Sit down with the administra-

tion to present carefully-planned,
wellsthought-out proposals will we
cease being the ‘North Campus
problem’ and resume our position
as the Men of North Campus.”

He feels that the “North Campus
problem” has not been sufficient-
1y defined or discussed. “The resi-
dence hall system has become a
whipping‘ boy or scapegoat for
problems which really do exist.
Admittedly there are faults with
the residence hall system. but
these problems can be worked, out
within the system.”

Kurasch proposes a meeting on
a grand'scale, a meeting which
would involve the Coil-KP, AWS
board, SGA president, President
Leggett, the new vice president,
Dean Stauss, the student deans,
the chairman of the faculty, and
the chairman of the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs.

Kurasch feels that a meeting of
this type would have some aspects
of an encampment but with the ad-
ded advantage of bringing togeth-
er those people—in student gov-
ernment, on the faculty, and in

lites than juniors, juniors more
than sophomores

How late the late minutes should '

be is a matter that “can be talked
about" — to use Miss Lauterv
bach’s Words.

The late minutes of which Miss
Lauterbach refers would be simi-
lar to the fifteen minutes of
"grace" tor women that the Sen-
ate passed Wednesday. it would
allow a woman to be a speciﬁed
number of minutes late without
incurring penalty. For seniors, Miss
Lauterbach suggested that there
possibly be two such periods of
“grace" a month.

When asked about the Women’s
Primary Court, Miss Lauterbach
had nothing but praise saying that
the court “has the respect or most
or South Campus."

The new president doesn’t see
the main duty of her nifickand
the offices of hall president»as en-
forcing the rules. “Enforcement
cannot be done away with realisti-
cally," she said. More importantly.
she said, the president should
“make the consequences known.”

At a question and answer period
for the two candidates Tuesday
afternoon. Miss Lauterbach was
asked about the possibility of hav-
ing sophomores as Baffleboard.

She replied that “I wouldn’t like
to see the position changed in this
way. Rather, I’d like to see one
good junior baitleboard per iloor
than two sophomores if there aren't
enough juniors available.” _

Another question from the floor
concerned the power oasis of stu-
dent government. 'The questioner
said that during the campaign tor
SGA presidency it was pointed out
that the power basis, for student
government was the power to quit
enforcing rules. Lauterbach was
asked what issues were important
enough to merit the use of this
power, l-ler answer was that the
step was "drastic” and she “hoped
it won't be used.”

Grinnell Visitors Seek Insights

Into Indian College's Problems

Visiting on campus this week
were Mr. and Mrs, S J. Savar-
trayan, [mm the American College
in Madurai, South India,

Savarirayan wound up the ma-
JOr stops in his two month United
States [Our Willi his visit here, after
spending time at Beioit, Carleton,
and Oberlin.

He summed up the purpose of
the trip as an chart “to learn
from colleges ot a size similar to
ours and aims Similar to Ours.” As
mericztn College is a small liberal
arts college in lndia, originally
founded by United States mission-
arics.

Savarirayan has been studying
American colleges irom tour main

. vantage points, he said. First, he
is observing what colleges here
are doing along the line or student
guidance and counseling, and how
successfully. Second, he is inter-
ested in studying the position ot
religion on a campus. He has no«
[iced similar tendencies in India
and the United States tor reiigion's
role to change, it not diminish,
even in schools that are religious
in Origin.

A survey of instructional facilities
is the Indian educator’s third in-
terest Finally, and most impor-
tant, he is trying to discover what

 

methods United States colleges
employ to make students think ior
themselves, express their own
ideas, and become intellectually
aware

The examination system in india
presents a real barrier to cultivat-
ing intellectual awareness, he
pointed out. Students become Ol'iA
ented toward passing exams rath-
er than educating themselves. He
said he was particularity interest-
ed in Grinnell‘s limited ci'edit-iztil
system.

In addition to these speciﬁc pur-
poses, Savarirayan said that his
trip was directed in a more gen-
eral way towards getting a reeling
about the whole American way oi
life and attitudes.

He said that he has already
gained more insights irom the tour
than he had originaliy expected.

in addition to visiting college
campuses, Savarirayan and his
wife have seen Harvard, Columbia,
and Rochester universities, and
plans a stop at Staniord before l'e-
turning to india.

India’s s p e C i f i 0 educational
problems include the language
problem, the relative newness or
higher education in lndia, the dif-
iicuity of a central control board
over all Indian colleges, and the
dominance of examinations.

Steiner's Independent Drama Proiect
Will Be Williams' ‘Glass Menagerie’

Henry - York Steiner is directing
an independent theatre project this
semester, The Glass Menagerie.
Th'i'e cast is Karyn Zimmerman as
Amanda Wingfield; Ken Hicks and
Debbie Abbott as Amanda’s chil-
dren Tom and Laura; and Chuck
Burns as Jim, the gentleman call-
er.

The play is set in St. Louis, now
and the past. Tennessee Williams
describes his characters in the
tollowing way:

Amanda - “A little woman oi
great but coniused vitality cling-
ing frantically to another time
and place.”

Laura - “Laura's separation
(from reality) increases till she is
like a piece or her own glass col-

lection, too exquisitely fragile to
move from the shelf.”

Tom - ”A poet with a job in a
warehouse. His nature is not.re-‘
morseless, but to escape from I
trap he has to act without pity."

Jim - “A nice, ordinary, young
man.”

The action centers around A-
manda's desperate attempts to
hold on to the past, She tries to
relive her life as a vivacious belle
through her shy. crippled daugh-
ter, telling her that she is not really
crippled, but only has a “slight
deformity". She asks, “So what
are we going to do the rest of our
lives? Stay home and watch the
parades go by? Amuse ourselves
with the glass rnenagerie, dar-
ling?“

AWS Board President Chris Pets
arson said that she was not sure
whether the new weekend loggi-

this weekend.

Only Four Open

The new system calls for only
four South Campus inggia doors to
be open at hours on weekends.
These doors will be Main, Hairles,
Haines driveway, and Loose. The
other doors will be closed prior to
hours, the exact time to be desig-
nated later.

The Senate also considered a
proposal by Clark hall senator Ron
Ficus that phone home on North
and South Campus be extended to

said that it would take “many
committees and many, many weeks
before we could get anywhere"
with extending phone hours. He
agreed. however, to discuss the
plan with the deans‘ committee.

Cagers Fall to 1-12 Conference Mark

Pioneers Succumb
To Beloit and Coe

’ The Pioneer basketball
team, experiencing another
frigid weekend in shooting,
lost twice more to fall to 1-12
in the conference.

Friday Beloit humiliated
the Pioneers 98-70 and Satur-
day Coe avenged their earlier
defeat 76-68.

Lawrence and Ripon
This weekend the hoopsters
will travel to Lawrence and
Ripon, two teams that have
ﬁlready registered wins at
arby.
The team is hopeful of at

least a win at Lawrence, be-
cause they are one of the
weaker teams in the confer-
ence.

Any dreams of an upset of
Beloit were overturned early
as the Bucs roared out to a
commanding lead right away
and then held it for the rest
of the game.

The ha me score was 49-
24, while in the second half
with substitutes going for
both sides, the Pioneers were
only outscored 49-46.

Pool" Shooting

Poor shooting was again
the villain. Beloit only took
one more shot than the Pio-
neers but made twelve more
field goals. The rebounding

was good though — the Pio-
neers matched the Bucs 45-45.

The Ode game was close
most of the way until the K0-
hawks’ John Valentine sank
a coupleof baskets near the
end of the game.

At the half the Pioneers
were down 39-36. While stay-
ing close in the second half,
the hoopsters were never able
to tie or take the lead. Finally
Coe pulled away for the 76-
68 win.

This time the Pioneers got
only five fewer field goals
than their opponent, but they
shot thirteen more times.

Leading scorer over the
weekend was Elliott Hibbs
who notched 27 points. Tom
Hill was next with 24.

Mermen Face ‘0lympic' Challenge

Final Meet Serves

As League Tune-up

Rapped by Knox and Cornell in
their last two outings, the Grinnell
Collegeswimmers will be trying to
get back on the beam when they
compete in Augustana's viking o-
lympics at Rock Island, 111., to-
morrow.

The Olympics close Grinnelrs
regular season schedule and pro
vide a final tuneup for the Mid-
west Conference meet March 45.

Through Experimenting

“We’re through experimenting,"
said Coach lrv Simone. “We now
know what we want to do for the
conference meet and will concen-
trate on those areas at Augustana
and in practice next week, it we
can get ourselves untracked psy-
chologically and put the final edge
on our physical conditioning, we
could pull a few surprises at the
conference."

Top Pioneer bets for points at
the Augustana meat, which always
draws a strong field, appear to be
Ken Adelman and Steve Holtze.

Holtze Gets First

Holtze edged out Bob Reimers.
medley champ, for Grinnell's only
first at Cornell.

After having a bad day at Knox.
butterflyer Adelman rebounded for
a good race at Cornell and was
just touched out by Phil Gibbs, also

 

a defending league tltlist. The set»
backs were the first for Adelman
in two seasons of dual meet com-
petition.

The Olympics will also offer
sprinter Bill Lontz some of the
action he badly needs after miss-
ing a week of practice because or
two burned hands. Though the time
he lost came at the most critical
stage of the season, Simone is hop-
ing Lontz can regain enough of
his conditioning to be a threat at
the conierence meet.

was accepted at the 123 lb. divis-
ion.
Strubler, Sharpe Win

Ken Strubler and John Sharpe
won easily by identical 14-3 scores.
Gary Wilson also won by decision
heating last year's conference
champion. 8-4. Bob Geller drew at
the 177 lb. level,

The season's last dual meets
prior to conference will take place
here Saturday at 1:00. Grinnell
Will host a double dual with Cornell
and Grinnell vs, Carleton and St.
Olaf.

Coach Moore, pleased with the
turnout and support given the mat-
men against Cornell earlier this
month, hopes to see an even larger
crowd tomorrow afternoon.

Title Contenders

With three conference title can
tenders purportedly on hand,
Moore ensures an eventful day.

Carleton, too, may prove tough,
for in the past they have proven
themselves comparable to St, Olaf
scorewise when both wrestled the
same team.

St, Olaf, though considered A
power, is also still somewhat of a
question mark. They do have a
fine team, but just where there
strength lies is uncertain.

Saturday will enable Grinnell to
evaluate more accurately just
what its chances tor a conterence
crown are next week at Beloii.

 

Four-Way Battle to

Four teams remained snarled a-
top the overall standings as the
LM. basketball season neared its
close this week. Crucial action in
the ‘A' division sow Dibble and
Cowles shaded out of contention,
while Smith‘s resurgent ‘B’ squad
boosted them into second place.
Clark's ‘A' unlt rode Bill Lee's 23
points past Smith, 66-58, to keep its
hopes olive, and North held on by
sweeping a pair from Cowles.
Darkhorse Rawsun has already finA
ished with a surprising record of
1+6, including a soar upset or
North's undefeated ‘3' team.

In one of the most bitterly-con-
tested (and liberallyofficiated) bat-
ties of the year, Smith‘s or group
